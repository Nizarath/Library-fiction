<p>Since I came to this place I have been very restless, wasting my</p>
<p>energies in the futile beginning of ill-conceived books. One does</p>
<p>not settle down very readily at two and forty to a new way of</p>
<p>living, and I have found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1">myself</a> with the teeming interests of the</p>
<p>life I have abandoned still buzzing like a swarm of homeless bees in</p>
<p>my head. My <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2">mind</a> has been full of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3">confused</a> protests and</p>
<p>justifications. In any case I should have found difficulties enough</p>
<p>in expressing the complex thing I have to tell, but it has added</p>
<p>greatly to my trouble that I have a great analogue, that a certain</p>
<p>Niccolo Machiavelli chanced to fall out of politics at very much the</p>
<p>age I have reached, and wrote a book to engage the restlessness of</p>
<p>his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2">mind</a>, very much as I have wanted to do. He wrote about the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4">relation</a> of the great constructive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_5">spirit</a> in politics to individual</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_6">character</a> and weaknesses, and so far his achievement lies like a</p>
<p>deep rut in the road of my intention. It has taken me far astray.</p>
<p>It is a matter of many weeks now-diversified indeed by some long</p>
<p>drives into the mountains behind us and a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_7">memorable</a> sail to Genoa</p>
<p>across the blue and purple waters that drowned Shelley-since I</p>
<p>began a laboured and futile imitation of "The Prince." I sat up</p>
<p>late last night with the jumbled accumulation; and at last made a</p>
<p>little fire of olive twigs and burnt it all, sheet by sheet-to</p>
<p>begin again clear this morning.</p>
<p>But incidentally I have re-read most of Machiavelli, not excepting</p>
<p>those scandalous letters of his to Vettori, and it seems to me, now</p>
<p>that I have released <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_8">myself</a> altogether from his literary precedent,</p>
<p>that he still has his use for me. In spite of his vast prestige I</p>
<p>claim kindred with him and set his name upon my title-page, in</p>
<p>partial intimation of the matter of my story. He takes me with</p>
<p>sympathy not only by reason of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_9">dream</a> he pursued and the humanity</p>
<p>of his politics, but by the mixture of his nature. His vices come</p>
<p>in, essential to my issue. He is dead and gone, all his immediate</p>
<p>correlations to party and faction have faded to insignificance,</p>
<p>leaving only on the one hand his broad method and conceptions, and</p>
<p>upon the other his intimate living personality, exposed down to its</p>
<p>salacious corners as the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_10">soul</a> of no contemporary can ever be</p>
<p>exposed. Of those double strands it is I have to write, of the</p>
<p>subtle protesting perplexing play of instinctive passion and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_11">desire</a></p>
<p>against too abstract a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_9">dream</a> of statesmanship. But things that</p>
<p>seemed to lie very far apart in Machiavelli's time have come near to</p>
<p>one another; it is no simple story of white passions struggling</p>
<p>against the red that I have to tell.</p>
<p>The state-making <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_12">dream</a> is a very old <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_12">dream</a> indeed in the world's</p>
<p>history. It plays too small a part in novels. Plato and Confucius</p>
<p>are but the highest of a great host of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_13">minds</a> that have had a kindred</p>
<p>aspiration, have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_12">dreamt</a> of a world of men better ordered, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_14">happier</a>,</p>
<p>finer, securer. They imagined cities <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_15">grown</a> more powerful and</p>
<p>peoples made rich and multitudinous by their efforts, they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_16">thought</a></p>
<p>in terms of harbours and shining navies, great roads engineered</p>
<p>marvellously, jungles cleared and deserts conquered, the ending of</p>
<p>muddle and diseases and dirt and misery; the ending of confusions</p>
<p>that waste human possibilities; they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_16">thought</a> of these things with</p>
<p>passion and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_17">desire</a> as other men <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_18">think</a> of the soft lines and tender</p>
<p>beauty of women. Thousands of men there are to-day almost mastered</p>
<p>by this white passion of statecraft, and in nearly every one who</p>
<p>reads and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_16">thinks</a> you could find, I suspect, some sort of answering</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_19">response</a>. But in every one it presents itself extraordinarily</p>
<p>entangled and mixed up with other, more intimate things.</p>
<p>It was so with Machiavelli. I picture him at San Casciano as he</p>
<p>lived in retirement upon his property after the fall of the</p>
<p>Republic, perhaps with a twinge of the torture that punished his</p>
<p>conspiracy still lurking in his limbs. Such twinges could not stop</p>
<p>his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_20">dreaming</a>. Then it was "The Prince" was written. All day he</p>
<p>went about his personal affairs, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_21">saw</a> homely neighbours, dealt with</p>
<p>his family, gave vent to everyday passions. He would sit in the</p>
<p>shop of Donato del Corno gossiping curiously among vicious company,</p>
<p>or pace the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_22">lonely</a> woods of his estate, book in hand, full of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_23">bitter</a></p>
<p>meditations. In the evening he returned home and went to his study.</p>
<p>At the entrance, he says, he pulled off his peasant clothes covered</p>
<p>with the dust and dirt of that immediate life, washed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_24">himself</a>, put</p>
<p>on his "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_25">noble</a> court dress," closed the door on the world of toiling</p>
<p>and getting, private loving, private <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_26">hating</a> and personal regrets,</p>
<p>sat down with a sigh of contentment to those wider <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_20">dreams</a>.</p>
<p>I like to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_27">think</a> of him so, with brown books before him lit by the</p>
<p>light of candles in silver candlesticks, or heading some new chapter</p>
<p>of "The Prince," with a grey quill in his clean fine hand.</p>
<p>So writing, he becomes a symbol for me, and the less none because of</p>
<p>his animal humour, his queer indecent side, and because of such</p>
<p>lapses into utter meanness as that which made him sound the note of</p>
<p>the begging-letter writer even in his "Dedication," reminding His</p>
<p>Magnificence very urgently, as if it were the gist of his matter, of</p>
<p>the continued malignity of fortune in his affairs. These flaws</p>
<p>complete him. They are my reason for preferring him as a symbol to</p>
<p>Plato, of whose indelicate side we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_28">know</a> nothing, and whose</p>
<p>correspondence with Dionysius of Syracuse has perished; or to</p>
<p>Confucius who travelled China in search of a Prince he might</p>
<p>instruct, with lapses and indignities now lost in the mists of ages.</p>
<p>They have achieved the apotheosis of individual forgetfulness, and</p>
<p>Plato has the added glory of that acquired beauty, that bust of the</p>
<p>Indian Bacchus which is now indissolubly mingled with his tradition.</p>
<p>They have passed into the world of the ideal, and every humbug takes</p>
<p>his freedoms with their names. But Machiavelli, more recent and</p>
<p>less popular, is still all human and earthly, a fallen brother-and</p>
<p>at the same time that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_29">nobly</a> dressed and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_29">nobly</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_30">dreaming</a> writer at the</p>
<p>desk.</p>
<p>That vision of the strengthened and perfected <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_31">state</a> is protagonist</p>
<p>in my story. But as I re-read "The Prince" and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_32">thought</a> out the</p>
<p>manner of my now abandoned project, I came to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_33">perceive</a> how that stir</p>
<p>and whirl of human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_32">thought</a> one calls by way of embodiment the French</p>
<p>Revolution, has altered absolutely the approach to such a question.</p>
<p>Machiavelli, like Plato and Pythagoras and Confucius two hundred odd</p>
<p>decades before him, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_34">saw</a> only one method by which a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_35">thinking</a> man,</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_36">himself</a> not powerful, might do the work of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_31">state</a> building, and that</p>
<p>was by seizing the imagination of a Prince. Directly these men</p>
<p>turned their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_32">thoughts</a> towards realisation, their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_37">attitudes</a> became-</p>
<p>what shall I call it?-secretarial. Machiavelli, it is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_38">true</a>, had</p>
<p>some little <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_39">doubts</a> about the particular Prince he wanted, whether it</p>
<p>was Caesar Borgia of Giuliano or Lorenzo, but a Prince it had to be.</p>
<p>Before I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_34">saw</a> clearly the differences of our own time I searched my</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_40">mind</a> for the modern equivalent of a Prince. At various times I</p>
<p>redrafted a parallel dedication to the Prince of Wales, to the</p>
<p>Emperor William, to Mr. Evesham, to a certain newspaper proprietor</p>
<p>who was once my schoolfellow at City Merchants', to Mr. J. D.</p>
<p>Rockefeller-all of them men in their several ways and circumstances</p>
<p>and possibilities, princely. Yet in every case my pen bent of its</p>
<p>own accord towards irony because-because, although at first I did</p>
<p>not realise it, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_41">myself</a> am just as free to be a prince. The appeal</p>
<p>was unfair. The old sort of Prince, the old little principality has</p>
<p>vanished from the world. The commonweal is one man's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_42">absolute</a></p>
<p>estate and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_43">responsibility</a> no more. In Machiavelli's time it was</p>
<p>indeed to an extreme degree one man's affair. But the days of the</p>
<p>Prince who planned and directed and was the source and centre of all</p>
<p>power are ended. We are in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_44">condition</a> of affairs infinitely more</p>
<p>complex, in which every prince and statesman is something of a</p>
<p>servant and every intelligent human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_45">being</a> something of a Prince. No</p>
<p>magnificent pensive Lorenzos remain any more in this world for</p>
<p>secretarial hopes.</p>
<p>In a sense it is wonderful how power has vanished, in a sense</p>
<p>wonderful how it has increased. I sit here, an unarmed discredited</p>
<p>man, at a small writing-table in a little defenceless dwelling among</p>
<p>the vines, and no human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_46">being</a> can stop my pen except by the</p>
<p>deliberate self-immolation of murdering me, nor destroy its fruits</p>
<p>except by theft and crime. No King, no council, can seize and</p>
<p>torture me; no Church, no nation silence me. Such powers of</p>
<p>ruthless and complete suppression have vanished. But that is not</p>
<p>because power has diminished, but because it has increased and</p>
<p>become multitudinous, because it has dispersed itself and</p>
<p>specialised. It is no longer a negative power we have, but</p>
<p>positive; we cannot prevent, but we can do. This age, far beyond</p>
<p>all previous ages, is full of powerful men, men who might, if they</p>
<p>had the will for it, achieve stupendous things.</p>
<p>The things that might be done to-day! The things indeed that are</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_47">being</a> done! It is the latter that give one so vast a sense of the</p>
<p>former. When I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_48">think</a> of the progress of physical and mechanical</p>
<p>science, of medicine and sanitation during the last century, when I</p>
<p>measure the increase in general education and average efficiency,</p>
<p>the power now available for human service, the merely physical</p>
<p>increment, and compare it with anything that has ever been at man's</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_49">disposal</a> before, and when I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_48">think</a> of what a little straggling,</p>
<p>incidental, undisciplined and uncoordinated minority of inventors,</p>
<p>experimenters, educators, writers and organisers has achieved this</p>
<p>development of human possibilities, achieved it in spite of the</p>
<p>disregard and aimlessness of the huge majority, and the passionate</p>
<p>resistance of the active dull, my imagination <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_50">grows</a> giddy with</p>
<p>dazzling intimations of the human splendours the justly organised</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_51">state</a> may yet <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_52">attain</a>. I glimpse for a bewildering instant the</p>
<p>heights that may be scaled, the splendid enterprises made possible.</p>
<p>But the appeal goes out now in other <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_53">forms</a>, in a book that catches</p>
<p>at thousands of readers for the eye of a Prince diffused. It is the</p>
<p>old appeal indeed for the unification of human effort, the ending of</p>
<p>confusions, but instead of the Machiavellian deference to a</p>
<p>flattered lord, a man cries out of his heart to the unseen</p>
<p>fellowship about him. The last written dedication of all those I</p>
<p>burnt last night, was to no single man, but to the socially</p>
<p>constructive passion-in any man…</p>
<p>There is, moreover, a second great difference in kind between my</p>
<p>world and Machiavelli's. We are discovering women. It is as if</p>
<p>they had come across a vast interval since his time, into the very</p>
<p>chamber of the statesman.</p>
</section>

</title>
<p>In Machiavelli's outlook the interest of womanhood was in a region</p>
<p>of life almost infinitely remote from his statecraft. They were the</p>
<p>vehicle of children, but only Imperial Rome and the new world of to-</p>
<p>day have ever had an inkling of the significance that might give</p>
<p>them in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_54">state</a>. They did their work, he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_55">thought</a>, as the ploughed</p>
<p>earth bears its crops. Apart from their function of fertility they</p>
<p>gave a humorous twist to life, stimulated worthy men to toil, and</p>
<p>wasted the hours of Princes. He left the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_55">thought</a> of women outside</p>
<p>with his other dusty things when he went into his study to write,</p>
<p>dismissed them from his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_56">mind</a>. But our modern world is burthened</p>
<p>with its sense of the immense, now half articulate, significance of</p>
<p>women. They stand now, as it were, close beside the silver</p>
<p>candlesticks, speaking as Machiavelli writes, until he stays his pen</p>
<p>and turns to discuss his writing with them.</p>
<p>It is this gradual discovery of sex as a thing collectively</p>
<p>portentous that I have to mingle with my statecraft if my picture is</p>
<p>to be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_57">true</a> which has turned me at length from a treatise to the</p>
<p>telling of my own story. In my life I have paralleled very closely</p>
<p>the slow realisations that are going on in the world about me. I</p>
<p>began life ignoring women, they came to me at first perplexing and</p>
<p>dishonouring; only very slowly and very late in my life and after</p>
<p>misadventure, did I gauge the power and beauty of the love of man</p>
<p>and woman and learnt how it must needs frame a justifiable vision of</p>
<p>the ordered world. Love has brought me to disaster, because my</p>
<p>career had been planned regardless of its possibility and value.</p>
<p>But Machiavelli, it seems to me, when he went into his study, left</p>
<p>not only the earth of life outside but its unsuspected <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_58">soul</a>.</p>

</title>
<p>Like Machiavelli at San Casciano, if I may take this analogy one</p>
<p>step further, I too am an exile. Office and leading are closed to</p>
<p>me. The political career that promised so much for me is shattered</p>
<p>and ended for ever.</p>
<p>I look out from this vine-wreathed veranda under the branches of a</p>
<p>stone pine; I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_59">see</a> wide and far across a purple valley whose sides</p>
<p>are terraced and set with houses of pine and ivory, the Gulf of</p>
<p>Liguria gleaming sapphire blue, and cloud-like baseless mountains</p>
<p>hanging in the sky, and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_60">think</a> of lank and coaly steamships heaving</p>
<p>on the grey rollers of the English Channel and darkling streets wet</p>
<p>with rain, I recall as if I were back there the busy exit from</p>
<p>Charing Cross, the cross and the money-changers' offices, the</p>
<p>splendid grime of giant London and the crowds going perpetually to</p>
<p>and fro, the lights by night and the urgency and eventfulness of</p>
<p>that great rain-swept heart of the modern world.</p>
<p>It is difficult to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_61">think</a> we have left that-for many years if not</p>
<p>for ever. In <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_62">thought</a> I walk once more in Palace Yard and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_63">hear</a> the</p>
<p>clink and clatter of hansoms and the quick <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_64">quiet</a> whirr of motors; I</p>
<p>go in vivid recent <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_65">memories</a> through the stir in the lobbies, I sit</p>
<p>again at eventful dinners in those old dining-rooms like cellars</p>
<p>below the House-dinners that ended with shrill division bells, I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_61">think</a> of huge clubs swarming and excited by the bulletins of that</p>
<p>electoral battle that was for me the opening opportunity. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_66">see</a> the</p>
<p>stencilled names and numbers go up on the green baize, constituency</p>
<p>after constituency, amidst murmurs or loud shouting…</p>
<p>It is over for me now and vanished. That opportunity will come no</p>
<p>more. Very probably you have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_67">heard</a> already some crude inaccurate</p>
<p>version of our story and why I did not take office, and have formed</p>
<p>your partial judgement on me. And so it is I sit now at my stone</p>
<p>table, half out of life already, in a warm, large, shadowy leisure,</p>
<p>splashed with sunlight and hung with vine tendrils, with paper</p>
<p>before me to distil such <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_68">wisdom</a> as I can, as Machiavelli in his</p>
<p>exile sought to do, from the things I have learnt and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_69">felt</a> during</p>
<p>the career that has ended now in my divorce.</p>
<p>I climbed high and fast from small beginnings. I had the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_70">mind</a> of my</p>
<p>party. I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_71">know</a> where I might not have ended, but for this red</p>
<p>blaze that came out of my unguarded nature and closed my career for</p>
<p>ever.</p>

<p>1</p>
</title>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_72">dreamt</a> first of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_73">states</a> and cities and political things when I was</p>
<p>a little boy in knickerbockers.</p>
<p>When I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_74">think</a> of how such things began in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_75">mind</a>, there comes back</p>
<p>to me the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_76">memory</a> of an enormous bleak room with its ceiling going up</p>
<p>to heaven and its floor covered irregularly with patched and</p>
<p>defective oilcloth and a dingy mat or so and a "surround" as they</p>
<p>call it, of dark stained wood. Here and there against the wall are</p>
<p>trunks and boxes. There are cupboards on either side of the</p>
<p>fireplace and bookshelves with books above them, and on the wall and</p>
<p>rather tattered is a large yellow-varnished geological map of the</p>
<p>South of England. Over the mantel is a huge lump of white coral</p>
<p>rock and several big fossil bones, and above that hangs the portrait</p>
<p>of a brainy gentleman, sliced in half and displaying an interior of</p>
<p>intricate detail and much vigour of coloring. It is the floor I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_74">think</a> of chiefly; over the oilcloth of which, assumed to be land,</p>
<p>spread towns and villages and forts of wooden bricks; there are</p>
<p>steep square hills (geologically, volumes of Orr's CYCLOPAEDIA OF</p>
<p>THE SCIENCES) and the cracks and spaces of the floor and the bare</p>
<p>brown surround were the water channels and open sea of that</p>
<p>continent of mine.</p>
<p>I still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_77">remember</a> with infinite gratitude the great-uncle to whom I</p>
<p>owe my bricks. He must have been one of those rare adults who have</p>
<p>not forgotten the chagrins and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_78">dreams</a> of childhood. He was a</p>
<p>prosperous west of England builder; including my father he had three</p>
<p>nephews, and for each of them he caused a box of bricks to be made</p>
<p>by an out-of-work carpenter, not the insufficient supply of the</p>
<p>toyshop, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_79">understand</a>, but a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_80">really</a> adequate quantity of bricks</p>
<p>made out of oak and shaped and smoothed, bricks about five inches by</p>
<p>two and a half by one, and half-bricks and quarter-bricks to</p>
<p>correspond. There were hundreds of them, many hundreds. I could</p>
<p>build six towers as high as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_81">myself</a> with them, and there seemed quite</p>
<p>enough for every engineering project I could undertake. I could</p>
<p>build whole towns with streets and houses and churches and citadels;</p>
<p>I could bridge every gap in the oilcloth and make causeways over</p>
<p>crumpled spaces (which I feigned to be morasses), and on a keel of</p>
<p>whole bricks it was possible to construct ships to push over the</p>
<p>high seas to the remotest port in the room. And a disciplined</p>
<p>population, that rose at last by sedulous begging on birthdays and</p>
<p>all convenient occasions to well over two hundred, of lead sailors</p>
<p>and soldiers, horse, foot and artillery, inhabited this world.</p>
<p>Justice has never been done to bricks and soldiers by those who</p>
<p>write about toys. The praises of the toy theatre have been a common</p>
<p>theme for essayists, the planning of the scenes, the painting and</p>
<p>cutting out of the caste, penny plain twopence coloured, the stink</p>
<p>and glory of the performance and the final conflagration. I had</p>
<p>such a theatre once, but I never loved it nor hoped for much from</p>
<p>it; my bricks and soldiers were my perpetual drama. I recall an</p>
<p>incessant variety of interests. There was the mystery and charm of</p>
<p>the complicated buildings one could make, with long passages and</p>
<p>steps and windows through which one peeped into their intricacies,</p>
<p>and by means of slips of card one could make slanting ways in them,</p>
<p>and send marbles rolling from top to base and thence out into the</p>
<p>hold of a waiting ship. Then there were the fortresses and gun</p>
<p>emplacements and covered ways in which one's soldiers went. And</p>
<p>there was commerce; the shops and markets and store-rooms full of</p>
<p>nasturtium seed, thrift seed, lupin beans and suchlike provender</p>
<p>from the garden; such stuff one stored in match-boxes and pill-</p>
<p>boxes, or packed in sacks of old glove fingers tied up with thread</p>
<p>and sent off by waggons along the great military road to the</p>
<p>beleaguered fortress on the Indian frontier beyond the worn places</p>
<p>that were dismal swamps. And there were battles on the way.</p>
<p>That great road is still clear in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_82">memory</a>. I was given, I forget</p>
<p>by what benefactor, certain particularly fierce red Indians of lead-</p>
<p>I have never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_83">seen</a> such soldiers since-and for these my father</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_84">helped</a> me to make tepees of brown paper, and I settled them in a</p>
<p>hitherto desolate country under the frowning nail-studded cliffs of</p>
<p>an ancient trunk. Then I conquered them and garrisoned their land.</p>
<p>(Alas! they died, no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_85">doubt</a> through contact with civilisation-one my</p>
<p>mother trod on-and their land became a wilderness again and was</p>
<p>ravaged for a time by a clockwork crocodile of vast proportions.)</p>
<p>And out towards the coal-scuttle was a region near the impassable</p>
<p>thickets of the ragged hearthrug where lived certain china Zulus</p>
<p>brandishing spears, and a mountain country of rudely piled bricks</p>
<p>concealing the most devious and enchanting caves and several mines</p>
<p>of gold and silver paper. Among these rocks a number of survivors</p>
<p>from a Noah's Ark made a various, dangerous, albeit frequently</p>
<p>invalid and crippled fauna, and I was wont to increase the</p>
<p>uncultivated wildness of this region further by trees of privet-</p>
<p>twigs from the garden hedge and box from the garden borders. By</p>
<p>these territories went my Imperial Road carrying produce to and fro,</p>
<p>bridging gaps in the oilcloth, tunnelling through Encyclopaedic</p>
<p>hills-one tunnel was three volumes long-defended as occasion</p>
<p>required by camps of paper tents or brick blockhouses, and ending at</p>
<p>last in a magnificently engineered ascent to a fortress on the</p>
<p>cliffs commanding the Indian reservation.</p>
<p>My games upon the floor must have spread over several years and</p>
<p>developed from small beginnings, incorporating now this suggestion</p>
<p>and now that. They stretch, I suppose, from seven to eleven or</p>
<p>twelve. I played them intermittently, and they bulk now in the</p>
<p>retrospect far more significantly than they did at the time. I</p>
<p>played them in bursts, and then forgot them for long periods;</p>
<p>through the spring and summer I was mostly out of doors, and school</p>
<p>and classes caught me early. And in the retrospect I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_86">see</a> them all</p>
<p>not only magnified and transfigured, but fore-shortened and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_87">confused</a></p>
<p>together. A clockwork railway, I seem to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_88">remember</a>, came and went;</p>
<p>one or two clockwork boats, toy sailing ships that, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_89">being</a> keeled,</p>
<p>would do nothing but lie on their beam ends on the floor; a</p>
<p>detestable lot of cavalrymen, undersized and gilt all over, given me</p>
<p>by a maiden aunt, and very much what one might expect from an aunt,</p>
<p>that I used as Nero used his Christians to ornament my public</p>
<p>buildings; and I finally melted some into fratricidal bullets, and</p>
<p>therewith blew the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_90">rest</a> to flat splashes of lead by means of a brass</p>
<p>cannon in the garden.</p>
<p>I find this empire of the floor much more vivid and detailed in my</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_91">memory</a> now than many of the owners of the skirts and legs and boots</p>
<p>that went gingerly across its territories. Occasionally, alas! they</p>
<p>stooped to scrub, abolishing in one universal destruction the slow</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_92">growth</a> of whole days of civilised development. I still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_93">remember</a> the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_94">hatred</a> and disgust of these catastrophes. Like Noah I was given</p>
<p>warnings. Did I disregard them, coarse red hands would descend,</p>
<p>plucking garrisons from fortresses and sailors from ships, jumbling</p>
<p>them up in their wrong boxes, clumsily so that their rifles and</p>
<p>swords were broken, sweeping the splendid curves of the Imperial</p>
<p>Road into heaps of ruins, casting the jungle <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_92">growth</a> of Zululand into</p>
<p>the fire.</p>
<p>Well, Master Dick," the voice of this cosmic calamity would say,</p>
<p>"you ought to have put them away last night. No! I can't wait until</p>
<p>you've sailed them all away in ships. I got my work to do, and do</p>
<p>it I will."</p>
<p>And in no time all my continents and lands were swirling water and</p>
<p>swiping strokes of house-flannel.</p>
<p>That was the worst of my giant visitants, but my mother too, dear</p>
<p>lady, was something of a terror to this microcosm. She wore spring-</p>
<p>sided boots, a kind of boot now vanished, I believe, from the world,</p>
<p>with dull bodies and shiny toes, and a silk dress with flounces that</p>
<p>were very destructive to the more hazardous viaducts of the Imperial</p>
<p>Road. She was always, I seem to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_95">remember</a>, fetching me; fetching me</p>
<p>for a meal, fetching me for a walk or, detestable absurdity!</p>
<p>fetching me for a wash and brush up, and she never seemed to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_96">understand</a> anything whatever of the political Systems across which</p>
<p>she came to me. Also she forbade all toys on Sundays except the</p>
<p>bricks for church-building and the soldiers for church parade, or a</p>
<p>Scriptural use of the remains of the Noah's Ark mixed up with a</p>
<p>wooden Swiss dairy farm. But she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_97">really</a> did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_98">know</a> whether a</p>
<p>thing was a church or not unless it positively bristled with cannon,</p>
<p>and many a Sunday afternoon have I played Chicago (with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_99">fear</a> of</p>
<p>God in my heart) under an infidel pretence that it was a new sort of</p>
<p>ark rather elaborately done.</p>
<p>Chicago, I must explain, was based upon my father's description of</p>
<p>the pig slaughterings in that city and certain pictures I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_100">seen</a>.</p>
<p>You made your beasts-which were all the ark lot <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_101">really</a>,</p>
<p>provisionally conceived as pigs-go up elaborate approaches to a</p>
<p>central pen, from which they went down a cardboard slide four at a</p>
<p>time, and dropped most <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_102">satisfyingly</a> down a brick shaft, and pitter-</p>
<p>litter over some steep steps to where a head slaughterman (ne Noah)</p>
<p>strung a cotton loop round their legs and sent them by pin hooks</p>
<p>along a wire to a second slaughterman with a chipped foot (formerly</p>
<p>Mrs. Noah) who, if I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_103">remember</a> rightly, converted them into Army</p>
<p>sausage by means of a portion of the inside of an old alarum clock.</p>
<p>My mother did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_104">understand</a> my games, but my father did. He wore</p>
<p>bright-coloured socks and carpet slippers when he was indoors-my</p>
<p>mother disliked boots in the house-and he would sit down on my</p>
<p>little chair and survey the microcosm on the floor with admirable</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_105">understanding</a> and sympathy.</p>
<p>It was he gave me most of my toys and, I more than suspect, most of</p>
<p>my ideas. "Here's some corrugated iron," he would say, "suitable</p>
<p>for roofs and fencing," and hand me a lump of that stiff crinkled</p>
<p>paper that is used for packing medicine bottles. Or, "Dick, do you</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_106">see</a> the tiger loose near the Imperial Road?-won't do for your</p>
<p>cattle ranch." And I would find a bright new lead tiger like a</p>
<p>special creation at large in the world, and demanding a hunting</p>
<p>expedition and much elaborate effort to get him safely housed in the</p>
<p>city menagerie beside the captured dragon crocodile, tamed now, and</p>
<p>his key lost and the heart and spring gone out of him.</p>
<p>And to the various irregular reading of my father I owe the</p>
<p>inestimable blessing of never having a boy's book in my boyhood</p>
<p>except those of Jules Verne. But my father used to get books for</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_107">himself</a> and me from the Bromstead Institute, Fenimore Cooper and</p>
<p>Mayne Reid and illustrated histories; one of the Russo-Turkish war</p>
<p>and one of Napier's expedition to Abyssinia I read from end to end;</p>
<p>Stanley and Livingstone, lives of Wellington, Napoleon and</p>
<p>Garibaldi, and back volumes of PUNCH, from which I derived</p>
<p>conceptions of foreign and domestic politics it has taken years of</p>
<p>adult reflection to correct. And at home permanently we had Wood's</p>
<p>NATURAL HISTORY, a brand-new illustrated Green's HISTORY OF THE</p>
<p>ENGLISH PEOPLE, Irving's COMPANIONS OF COLUMBUS, a great number of</p>
<p>unbound parts of some geographical work, a VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_108">think</a> it was called, with pictures of foreign places, and Clarke's</p>
<p>NEW TESTAMENT with a map of Palestine, and a variety of other</p>
<p>informing books bought at sales. There was a Sowerby's BOTANY also,</p>
<p>with thousands of carefully tinted pictures of British plants, and</p>
<p>one or two other important works in the sitting-room. I was allowed</p>
<p>to turn these over and even lie on the floor with them on Sundays</p>
<p>and other occasions of exceptional cleanliness.</p>
<p>And in the attic I found one day a very old forgotten map after the</p>
<p>fashion of a bird's-eye view, representing the Crimea, that</p>
<p>fascinated me and kept me for hours navigating its waters with a</p>
<p>pin.</p>

</title>
<p>My father was a lank-limbed man in easy shabby tweed clothes and</p>
<p>with his hands in his trouser pockets. He was a science teacher,</p>
<p>taking a number of classes at the Bromstead Institute in Kent under</p>
<p>the old Science and Art Department, and "visiting" various schools;</p>
<p>and our resources were eked out by my mother's income of nearly a</p>
<p>hundred pounds a year, and by his inheritance of a terrace of three</p>
<p>palatial but structurally unsound stucco houses near Bromstead</p>
<p>Station.</p>
<p>They were big clumsy residences in the earliest Victorian style,</p>
<p>interminably high and with deep damp basements and downstairs</p>
<p>coal-cellars and kitchens that suggested an architect</p>
<p>vindictively devoted to the discomfort of the servant class. If so,</p>
<p>he had overreached <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_109">himself</a> and defeated his end, for no servant</p>
<p>would stay in them unless for exceptional wages or exceptional</p>
<p>tolerance of inefficiency or exceptional freedom in repartee. Every</p>
<p>storey in the house was from twelve to fifteen feet high (which</p>
<p>would have been cool and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_110">pleasant</a> in a hot climate), and the stairs</p>
<p>went steeply up, to end at last in attics too inaccessible for</p>
<p>occupation. The ceilings had vast plaster cornices of classical</p>
<p>design, fragments of which would sometimes fall unexpectedly, and</p>
<p>the wall-papers were bold and gigantic in pattern and much</p>
<p>variegated by damp and ill-mended rents.</p>
<p>As my father was quite unable to let more than one of these houses</p>
<p>at a time, and that for the most part to eccentric and undesirable</p>
<p>tenants, he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_111">thought</a> it politic to live in one of the two others, and</p>
<p>devote the rent he received from the let one, when it was let, to</p>
<p>the incessant necessary repairing of all three. He also did some of</p>
<p>the repairing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_112">himself</a> and, smoking a bull-dog pipe the while, which</p>
<p>my mother would not allow him to do in the house, he cultivated</p>
<p>vegetables in a sketchy, unpunctual and not always successful manner</p>
<p>in the unoccupied gardens. The three houses faced north, and the</p>
<p>back of the one we occupied was covered by a grape-vine that</p>
<p>yielded, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_113">remember</a>, small green grapes for pies in the spring, and</p>
<p>imperfectly ripe black grapes in favourable autumns for the purposes</p>
<p>of dessert. The grape-vine played an important part in my life, for</p>
<p>my father broke his neck while he was pruning it, when I was</p>
<p>thirteen.</p>
<p>My father was what is called a man of ideas, but they were not</p>
<p>always <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_114">good</a> ideas. My grandfather had been a private schoolmaster</p>
<p>and one of the founders of the College of Preceptors, and my father</p>
<p>had assisted him in his school until increasing competition and</p>
<p>diminishing attendance had made it evident that the days of small</p>
<p>private schools kept by unqualified persons were numbered.</p>
<p>Thereupon my father had roused <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_115">himself</a> and had qualified as a</p>
<p>science teacher under the Science and Art Department, which in these</p>
<p>days had charge of the scientific and artistic education of the mass</p>
<p>of the English population, and had thrown <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_115">himself</a> into science</p>
<p>teaching and the earning of government grants therefor with great if</p>
<p>transitory zeal and success.</p>
<p>I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_116">remember</a> anything of my father's earlier and more energetic</p>
<p>time. I was the child of my parents' middle years; they married</p>
<p>when my father was thirty-five and my mother past forty, and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_117">saw</a></p>
<p>only the last decadent phase of his educational career.</p>
<p>The Science and Art Department has vanished altogether from the</p>
<p>world, and people are forgetting it now with the utmost readiness</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_118">generosity</a>. Part of its substance and staff and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_119">spirit</a> survive,</p>
<p>more or less completely digested into the Board of Education.</p>
<p>The world does move on, even in its government. It is wonderful how</p>
<p>many of the clumsy and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_120">limited</a> governing bodies of my youth and</p>
<p>early manhood have given place now to more scientific and efficient</p>
<p>machinery. When I was a boy, Bromstead, which is now a borough, was</p>
<p>ruled by a strange body called a Local Board-it was the Age of</p>
<p>Boards-and I still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_121">remember</a> indistinctly my father rejoicing at the</p>
<p>breakfast-table over the liberation of London from the corrupt and</p>
<p>devastating control of a Metropolitan Board of Works. Then there</p>
<p>were also School Boards; I was already practically in politics</p>
<p>before the London School Board was absorbed by the spreading</p>
<p>tentacles of the London County Council.</p>
<p>It gives a measure of the newness of our modern ideas of the State</p>
<p>to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_122">remember</a> that the very beginnings of public education lie within</p>
<p>my father's lifetime, and that many most intelligent and patriotic</p>
<p>people were shocked beyond measure at the State doing anything of</p>
<p>the sort. When he was born, totally illiterate people who could</p>
<p>neither read a book nor write more than perhaps a clumsy signature,</p>
<p>were to be found everywhere in England; and great masses of the</p>
<p>population were getting no instruction at all. Only a few schools</p>
<p>flourished upon the patronage of exceptional parents; all over the</p>
<p>country the old endowed grammar schools were to be found sinking and</p>
<p>dwindling; many of them had closed altogether. In the new great</p>
<p>centres of population multitudes of children were sweated in the</p>
<p>factories, darkly ignorant and wretched and the under-equipped and</p>
<p>under-staffed National and British schools, supported by voluntary</p>
<p>contributions and sectarian rivalries, made an ineffectual fight</p>
<p>against this festering darkness. It was a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_123">condition</a> of affairs</p>
<p>clamouring for remedies, but there was an immense amount of</p>
<p>indifference and prejudice to be overcome before any remedies were</p>
<p>possible. Perhaps some day some industrious and lucid historian</p>
<p>will disentangle all the muddle of impulses and antagonisms, the</p>
<p>commercialism, utilitarianism, obstinate conservatism, humanitarian</p>
<p>enthusiasm, out of which our present educational organisation arose.</p>
<p>I have long since come to believe it necessary that all new social</p>
<p>institutions should be born in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_124">confusion</a>, and that at first they</p>
<p>should present chiefly crude and ridiculous aspects. The distrust</p>
<p>of government in the Victorian days was far too great, and the</p>
<p>general intelligence far too low, to permit the State to go about</p>
<p>the new business it was taking up in a businesslike way, to train</p>
<p>teachers, build and equip schools, endow pedagogic research, and</p>
<p>provide properly written school-books. These things it was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_125">felt</a></p>
<p>MUST be provided by individual and local effort, and since it was</p>
<p>manifest that it was individual and local effort that were in</p>
<p>default, it was reluctantly agreed to stimulate them by money</p>
<p>payments. The State set up a machinery of examination both in</p>
<p>Science and Art and for the elementary schools; and payments, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_126">known</a></p>
<p>technically as grants, were made in accordance with the examination</p>
<p>results <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_127">attained</a>, to such schools as Providence might <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_128">see</a> fit to</p>
<p>send into the world. In this way it was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_125">felt</a> the Demand would be</p>
<p>established that would, according to the beliefs of that time,</p>
<p>inevitably ensure the Supply. An industry of "Grant earning" was</p>
<p>created, and this would give education as a necessary by-product.</p>
<p>In the end this belief was found to need qualification, but Grant-</p>
<p>earning was still in full activity when I was a small boy. So far</p>
<p>as the Science and Art Department and my father are concerned, the</p>
<p>task of examination was entrusted to eminent scientific men, for the</p>
<p>most part quite unaccustomed to teaching. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_129">see</a>, if they also</p>
<p>were teaching similar classes to those they examined, it was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_130">feared</a></p>
<p>that injustice might be done. Year after year these eminent persons</p>
<p>set questions and employed subordinates to read and mark the</p>
<p>increasing thousands of answers that ensued, and having no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_131">doubt</a> the</p>
<p>national ideal of fairness well developed in their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_132">minds</a>, they were</p>
<p>careful each year to re-read the preceding papers before composing</p>
<p>the current one, in order to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_129">see</a> what it was usual to ask. As a</p>
<p>result of this, in the course of a few years the recurrence and</p>
<p>permutation of questions became almost calculable, and since the</p>
<p>practical <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_133">object</a> of the teaching was to teach people not science,</p>
<p>but how to write answers to these questions, the industry of Grant-</p>
<p>earning assumed a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_134">form</a> easily distinguished from any kind of genuine</p>
<p>education whatever.</p>
<p>Other remarkable compromises had also to be made with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_135">spirit</a> of</p>
<p>the age. The unfortunate conflict between Religion and Science</p>
<p>prevalent at this time was mitigated, if I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_136">remember</a> rightly, by</p>
<p>making graduates in arts and priests in the established church</p>
<p>Science Teachers EX OFFICIO, and leaving local and private</p>
<p>enterprise to provide schools, diagrams, books, material, according</p>
<p>to the conceptions of efficiency prevalent in the district. Private</p>
<p>enterprise made a particularly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_137">good</a> thing of the books. A number of</p>
<p>competing firms of publishers sprang into <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_138">existence</a> specialising in</p>
<p>Science and Art Department work; they set <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_139">themselves</a> to produce</p>
<p>text-books that should supply exactly the quantity and quality of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_140">knowledge</a> necessary for every stage of each of five and twenty</p>
<p>subjects into which <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_141">desirable</a> science was divided, and copies and</p>
<p>models and instructions that should give precisely the method and</p>
<p>gestures esteemed as proficiency in art. Every section of each book</p>
<p>was written in the idiom found to be most <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_142">satisfactory</a> to the</p>
<p>examiners, and test questions extracted from papers set in former</p>
<p>years were appended to every chapter. By means of these last the</p>
<p>teacher was able to train his class to the very highest level of</p>
<p>grant-earning efficiency, and very naturally he cast all other</p>
<p>methods of exposition aside. First he posed his pupils with</p>
<p>questions and then dictated model replies.</p>
<p>That was my father's method of instruction. I attended his classes</p>
<p>as an elementary grant-earner from the age of ten until his death,</p>
<p>and it is so I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_143">remember</a> him, sitting on the edge of a table,</p>
<p>smothering a yawn occasionally and giving out the infallible</p>
<p>formulae to the industriously scribbling class sitting in rows of</p>
<p>desks before him. Occasionally be would slide to his feet and go to</p>
<p>a blackboard on an easel and draw on that very slowly and</p>
<p>deliberately in coloured chalks a diagram for the class to copy in</p>
<p>coloured pencils, and sometimes he would display a specimen or</p>
<p>arrange an experiment for them to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_144">see</a>. The room in the Institute in</p>
<p>which he taught was equipped with a certain amount of apparatus</p>
<p>prescribed as necessary for subject this and subject that by the</p>
<p>Science and Art Department, and this my father would supplement with</p>
<p>maps and diagrams and drawings of his own.</p>
<p>But he never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_145">really</a> did experiments, except that in the class in</p>
<p>systematic botany he sometimes made us tease common flowers to</p>
<p>pieces. He did not do experiments if he could possibly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_146">help</a> it,</p>
<p>because in the first place they used up time and gas for the Bunsen</p>
<p>burner and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_147">good</a> material in a ruinous fashion, and in the second</p>
<p>they were, in his rather careless and sketchy hands, apt to endanger</p>
<p>the apparatus of the Institute and even the lives of his students.</p>
<p>Then thirdly, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_148">real</a> experiments involved washing up. And moreover</p>
<p>they always turned out wrong, and sometimes misled the too observant</p>
<p>learner very seriously and opened demoralising controversies. Quite</p>
<p>early in life I acquired an almost ineradicable sense of the</p>
<p>unscientific perversity of Nature and the impassable gulf that is</p>
<p>fixed between systematic science and elusive fact. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_149">knew</a>, for</p>
<p>example, that in science, whether it be subject XII., Organic</p>
<p>Chemistry, or subject XVII., Animal Physiology, when you blow into a</p>
<p>glass of lime water it instantly becomes cloudy, and if you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_150">continue</a></p>
<p>to blow it clears again, whereas in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_151">truth</a> you may blow into the</p>
<p>stuff from the lime-water bottle until you are crimson in the face</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_152">painful</a> under the ears, and it never becomes cloudy at all. And</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_149">knew</a>, too, that in science if you put potassium chlorate into a</p>
<p>retort and heat it over a Bunsen burner, oxygen is disengaged and</p>
<p>may be collected over water, whereas in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_148">real</a> life if you do anything</p>
<p>of the sort the vessel cracks with a loud report, the potassium</p>
<p>chlorate descends sizzling upon the flame, the experimenter says</p>
<p>"Oh! Damn!" with astonishing heartiness and distinctness, and a lady</p>
<p>student in the back seats gets up and leaves the room.</p>
<p>Science is the organised conquest of Nature, and I can quite</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_153">understand</a> that ancient libertine refusing to cooperate in her own</p>
<p>undoing. And I can quite <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_153">understand</a>, too, my father's preference</p>
<p>for what he called an illustrative experiment, which was simply an</p>
<p>arrangement of the apparatus in front of the class with nothing</p>
<p>whatever by way of material, and the Bunsen burner clean and cool,</p>
<p>and then a slow luminous description of just what you did put in it</p>
<p>when you were so ill-advised as to carry the affair beyond</p>
<p>illustration, and just exactly what ought anyhow to happen when you</p>
<p>did. He had considerable powers of vivid expression, so that in</p>
<p>this way he could make us <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_154">see</a> all he described. The class, freed</p>
<p>from any unpleasant nervous tension, could draw this still life</p>
<p>without flinching, and if any part was too difficult to draw, then</p>
<p>my father would produce a simplified version on the blackboard to be</p>
<p>copied instead. And he would also write on the blackboard any</p>
<p>exceptionally difficult but grant-earning words, such as</p>
<p>"empyreumatic" or "botryoidal."</p>
<p>Some words in constant use he rarely explained. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_155">remember</a> once</p>
<p>sticking up my hand and asking him in the full flow of description,</p>
<p>"Please, sir, what is flocculent?"</p>
<p>"The precipitate is."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, but what does it mean?"</p>
<p>"Oh! flocculent! " said my father, "flocculent! Why-" he extended</p>
<p>his hand and arm and twiddled his fingers for a second in the air.</p>
<p>"Like that," he said.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_156">thought</a> the explanation sufficient, but he paused for a moment</p>
<p>after giving it. "As in a flock bed, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_157">know</a>," he added and</p>
<p>resumed his discourse.</p>

<p>My father, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_158">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_159">am</a> afraid, carried a natural incompetence in practical</p>
<p>affairs to an exceptionally high level. He combined practical</p>
<p>incompetence, practical enterprise and a thoroughly sanguine</p>
<p>temperament, in a manner that I have never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_160">seen</a> paralleled in any</p>
<p>human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_161">being</a>. He was always trying to do new things in the briskest</p>
<p>manner, under the suggestion of books or papers or his own</p>
<p>spontaneous imagination, and as he had never been trained to do</p>
<p>anything whatever in his life properly, his futilities were</p>
<p>extensive and thorough. At one time he nearly gave up his classes</p>
<p>for intensive culture, so enamoured was he of its possibilities; the</p>
<p>peculiar pungency of the manure he got, in pursuit of a chemical</p>
<p>theory of his own, has scarred my olfactory <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_162">memories</a> for a lifetime.</p>
<p>The intensive culture phase is very clear in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_162">memory</a>; it came near</p>
<p>the end of his career and when I was between eleven and twelve. I</p>
<p>was mobilised to gather caterpillars on several occasions, and</p>
<p>assisted in nocturnal raids upon the slugs by lantern-light that</p>
<p>wrecked my preparation work for school next day. My father dug up</p>
<p>both lawns, and trenched and manured in spasms of immense vigour</p>
<p>alternating with periods of paralysing distaste for the garden. And</p>
<p>for weeks he talked about eight hundred pounds an acre at every</p>
<p>meal.</p>
<p>A garden, even when it is not exasperated by intensive methods, is a</p>
<p>thing as exacting as a baby, its moods have to he watched; it does</p>
<p>not wait upon the cultivator's convenience, but has times of its</p>
<p>own. Intensive culture greatly increases this <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_163">disposition</a> to</p>
<p>trouble mankind; it makes a garden <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_164">touchy</a> and hysterical, a drugged</p>
<p>and demoralised and over-irritated garden. My father got at cross</p>
<p>purposes with our two patches at an early stage. Everything <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_165">grew</a></p>
<p>wrong from the first to last, and if my father's manures intensified</p>
<p>nothing else, they certainly intensified the Primordial Curse. The</p>
<p>peas were eaten in the night before they were three inches high, the</p>
<p>beans bore nothing but blight, the only apparent result of a</p>
<p>spraying of the potatoes was to develop a PENCHANT in the cat for</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_166">being</a> ill indoors, the cucumber frames were damaged by the</p>
<p>catapulting of boys going down the lane at the back, and all your</p>
<p>cucumbers were mysteriously embittered. That lane with its</p>
<p>occasional passers-by did much to wreck the intensive scheme,</p>
<p>because my father always stopped work and went indoors if any one</p>
<p>watched him. His special manure was apt to arouse a troublesome</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_167">spirit</a> of inquiry in hardy natures.</p>
<p>In digging his rows and shaping his patches he neglected the guiding</p>
<p>string and trusted to his eye altogether too much, and the</p>
<p>consequent obliquity and the various wind-breaks and scare-crows he</p>
<p>erected, and particularly an irrigation contrivance he began and</p>
<p>never finished by which everything was to be watered at once by</p>
<p>means of pieces of gutter from the roof and outhouses of Number 2,</p>
<p>and a large and particularly obstinate clump of elder-bushes in the</p>
<p>abolished hedge that he had failed to destroy entirely either by axe</p>
<p>or by fire, combined to give the gardens under intensive culture a</p>
<p>singularly desolate and disorderly appearance. He took steps</p>
<p>towards the diversion of our house drain under the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_168">influence</a> of the</p>
<p>Sewage Utilisation Society; but <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_169">happily</a> he stopped in time. He</p>
<p>hardly completed any of the operations he began; something else</p>
<p>became more urgent or simply he tired; a considerable area of the</p>
<p>Number 2 territory was never even dug up.</p>
<p>In the end the affair irritated him beyond endurance. Never was a</p>
<p>man less horticulturally-minded. The clamour of these vegetables he</p>
<p>had launched into the world for his service and assistance, wore out</p>
<p>his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_170">patience</a>. He would walk into the garden the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_171">happiest</a> of men</p>
<p>after a day or so of disregard, talking to me of history perhaps or</p>
<p>social organisation, or summarising some book he had read. He</p>
<p>talked to me of anything that interested him, regardless of my</p>
<p>limitations. Then he would begin to note the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_172">growth</a> of the weeds.</p>
<p>"This won't do," he would say and pull up a handful.</p>
<p>More weeding would follow and the talk would become fragmentary.</p>
<p>His hands would become earthy, his nails black, weeds would snap off</p>
<p>in his careless grip, leaving the roots behind. The world would</p>
<p>darken. He would look at his fingers with disgusted astonishment.</p>
<p>"CURSE these weeds!" he would say from his heart. His discourse was</p>
<p>at an end.</p>
<p>I have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_173">memories</a>, too, of his sudden unexpected charges into the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_174">tranquillity</a> of the house, his hands and clothes intensively</p>
<p>enriched. He would come in like a whirlwind. "This damned stuff</p>
<p>all over me and the Agricultural Chemistry Class at six! Bah!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AAAAAAH!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>My mother would never learn not to attempt to break him of swearing</p>
<p>on such occasions. She would remain standing a little stiffly in</p>
<p>the scullery refusing to assist him to the adjectival towel he</p>
<p>sought.</p>
<p>"If you say such things-"</p>
<p>He would dance with rage and hurl the soap about. "The towel!" he</p>
<p>would cry, flicking suds from big fingers in every direction; "the</p>
<p>towel! I'll let the blithering class slide if you don't give me the</p>
<p>towel! I'll give up everything, I tell you-everything!"…</p>
<p>At last with the failure of the lettuces came the breaking point. I</p>
<p>was in the little arbour learning Latin irregular verbs when it</p>
<p>happened. I can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_175">see</a> him still, his peculiar tenor voice still</p>
<p>echoes in my brain, shouting his opinion of intensive culture for</p>
<p>all the world to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_176">hear</a>, and slashing away at that abominable mockery</p>
<p>of a crop with a hoe. We had tied them up with bast only a week or</p>
<p>so before, and now half were rotten and half had shot up into tall</p>
<p>slender growths. He had the hoe in both hands and slogged. Great</p>
<p>wipes he made, and at each stroke he said, "Take that!"</p>
<p>The air was thick with flying fragments of abortive salad. It was a</p>
<p>fantastic massacre. It was the French Revolution of that cold</p>
<p>tyranny, the vindictive overthrow of the pampered vegetable</p>
<p>aristocrats. After he had assuaged his passion upon them, he turned</p>
<p>for other prey; he kicked holes in two of our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_177">noblest</a> marrows,</p>
<p>flicked off the heads of half a row of artichokes, and shied the hoe</p>
<p>with a splendid smash into the cucumber frame. Something of the awe</p>
<p>of that moment returns to me as I write of it.</p>
<p>Well, my boy," he said, approaching with an expression of beneficent</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_178">happiness</a>, "I've done with gardening. Let's go for a walk like</p>
<p>reasonable beings. I've had enough of this"-his face was convulsed</p>
<p>for an instant with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_179">bitter</a> resentment-" Pandering to cabbages."</p>

<p>That afternoon's walk sticks in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_180">memory</a> for many reasons. One is</p>
<p>that we went further than I had ever been before; far beyond Keston</p>
<p>and nearly to Seven-oaks, coming back by train from Dunton Green,</p>
<p>and the other is that my father as he went along talked about</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_181">himself</a>, not so much to me as to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_181">himself</a>, and about life and what he</p>
<p>had done with it. He monologued so that at times he produced an</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_182">effect</a> of weird world-forgetfulness. I listened puzzled, and at</p>
<p>that time not upderstanding many things that afterwards became plain</p>
<p>to me. It is only in recent years that I have discovered the pathos</p>
<p>of that monologue; how friendless my father was and uncompanioned in</p>
<p>his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_183">thoughts</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_184">feelings</a>, and what a hunger he may have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_185">felt</a> for</p>
<p>the sympathy of the undeveloped youngster who trotted by his side.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_186">I'm</a> no gardener," he said, "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_186">I'm</a> no anything. Why the devil did I</p>
<p>start gardening?</p>
<p>"I suppose man was created to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_187">mind</a> a garden… But the Fall let</p>
<p>us out of that! What was I created for? God! what was I created</p>
<p>for?…</p>
<p>"Slaves to matter! <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_188">Minding</a> inanimate things! It doesn't suit me,</p>
<p>you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_189">know</a>. I've got no hands and no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_190">patience</a>. I've mucked about</p>
<p>with life. Mucked about with life." He suddenly addressed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_191">himself</a></p>
<p>to me, and for an instant I started like an eavesdropper discovered.</p>
<p>"Whatever you do, boy, whatever you do, make a Plan. Make a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_192">good</a></p>
<p>Plan and stick to it. Find out what life is about-I never have-</p>
<p>and set <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_193">yourself</a> to do whatever you ought to do. I admit it's a</p>
<p>puzzle…</p>
<p>"Those damned houses have been the curse of my life. Stucco white</p>
<p>elephants! Beastly cracked stucco with stains of green-black and</p>
<p>green. Conferva and soot… Property, they are!… Beware</p>
<p>of Things, Dick, beware of Things! Before you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_194">know</a> where you are</p>
<p>you are waiting on them and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_195">minding</a> them. They'll eat your life up.</p>
<p>Eat up your hours and your blood and energy! When those houses came</p>
<p>to me, I ought to have sold them-or fled the country. I ought to</p>
<p>have cleared out. Sarcophagi-eaters of men! Oh! the hours and</p>
<p>days of work, the nights of anxiety those vile houses have cost me!</p>
<p>The painting! It worked up my arms; it got all over me. I stank of</p>
<p>it. It made me ill. It isn't living-it's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_195">minding</a>…</p>
<p>"Property's the curse of life. Property! Ugh! Look at this</p>
<p>country all cut up into silly little parallelograms, look at all</p>
<p>those villas we passed just now and those potato patches and that</p>
<p>tarred shanty and the hedge! Somebody's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_196">minding</a> every bit of it</p>
<p>like a dog tied to a cart's tail. Patching it and bothering about</p>
<p>it. Bothering! Yapping at every passer-by. Look at that notice-</p>
<p>board! One rotten worried little beast wants to keep us other</p>
<p>rotten little beasts off HIS patch,-God <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_197">knows</a> why! Look at the</p>
<p>weeds in it. Look at the mended fence!… There's no property</p>
<p>worth having, Dick, but money. That's only <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_198">good</a> to spend. All</p>
<p>these things. Human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_199">souls</a> buried under a cartload of blithering</p>
<p>rubbish…</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_200">I'm</a> not a fool, Dick. I have qualities, imagination, a sort of go.</p>
<p>I ought to have made a better thing of life.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_201">I'm</a> sure I could have done things. Only the old people pulled my</p>
<p>leg. They started me wrong. They never started me at all. I only</p>
<p>began to find out what life was like when I was nearly forty.</p>
<p>"If I'd gone to a university; if I'd had any sort of sound training,</p>
<p>if I hadn't slipped into the haphazard places that came easiest…</p>
<p>"Nobody warned me. Nobody. It isn't a world we live in, Dick; it's</p>
<p>a cascade of accidents; it's a chaos exasperated by policemen! YOU</p>
<p>be warned in time, Dick. You stick to a plan. Don't wait for any</p>
<p>one to show you the way. Nobody will. There isn't a way till you</p>
<p>make one. Get education, get a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_202">good</a> education. Fight your way to</p>
<p>the top. It's your only chance. I've watched you. You'll do no</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_202">good</a> at digging and property <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_203">minding</a>. There isn't a neighbour in</p>
<p>Bromstead won't be able to skin you at suchlike games. You and I</p>
<p>are the brainy unstable kind, topside or nothing. And if ever those</p>
<p>blithering houses come to you-don't have 'em. Give them away!</p>
<p>Dynamite 'em-and off! LIVE, Dick! I'll get rid of them for you if</p>
<p>I can, Dick, but <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_204">remember</a> what I say."…</p>
<p>So it was my father discoursed, if not in those particular words,</p>
<p>yet exactly in that manner, as he slouched along the southward road,</p>
<p>with resentful eyes becoming less resentful as he talked, and</p>
<p>flinging out clumsy illustrative motions at the outskirts of</p>
<p>Bromstead as we passed along them. That afternoon he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_205">hated</a></p>
<p>Bromstead, from its foot-tiring pebbles up. He had no illusions</p>
<p>about Bromstead or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_206">himself</a>. I have the clearest impression of him</p>
<p>in his garden-stained tweeds with a deer-stalker hat on the back of</p>
<p>his head and presently a pipe sometimes between his teeth and</p>
<p>sometimes in his gesticulating hand, as he became diverted by his</p>
<p>talk from his original exasperation…</p>
<p>This particular afternoon is no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_207">doubt</a> mixed up in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_208">memory</a> with</p>
<p>many other afternoons; all sorts of things my father said and did at</p>
<p>different times have got <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_209">themselves</a> referred to it; it filled me at</p>
<p>the time with a great unprecedented sense of fellowship and it has</p>
<p>become the symbol now for all our intercourse together. If I didn't</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_210">understand</a> the things he said, I did the mood he was in. He gave me</p>
<p>two very broad ideas in that talk and the talks I have mingled with</p>
<p>it; he gave them to me very clearly and they have remained</p>
<p>fundamental in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_211">mind</a>; one a sense of the extraordinary <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_212">confusion</a></p>
<p>and waste and planlessness of the human life that went on all about</p>
<p>us; and the other of a great ideal of order and economy which he</p>
<p>called variously Science and Civilisation, and which, though I do</p>
<p>not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_213">remember</a> that he ever used that word, I suppose many people</p>
<p>nowadays would identify with Socialism,-as the Fabians expound it.</p>
<p>He was not very definite about this Science, you must <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_214">understand</a>,</p>
<p>but he seemed always to be waving his hand towards it,-just as his</p>
<p>contemporary Tennyson seems always to be doing-he belonged to his</p>
<p>age and mostly his talk was destructive of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_215">limited</a> beliefs of</p>
<p>his time, he led me to infer rather than actually told me that this</p>
<p>Science was coming, a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_216">spirit</a> of light and order, to the rescue of a</p>
<p>world groaning and travailing in muddle for the want of it…</p>

</title>
<p>When I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_217">think</a> of Bromstead nowadays I find it inseparably bound up</p>
<p>with the disorders of my father's gardening, and the odd patchings</p>
<p>and paintings that disfigured his houses. It was all of a piece</p>
<p>with that.</p>
<p>Let me try and give something of the quality of Bromstead and</p>
<p>something of its history. It is the quality and history of a</p>
<p>thousand places round and about London, and round and about the</p>
<p>other great centres of population in the world. Indeed it is in a</p>
<p>measure the quality of the whole of this modern world from which we</p>
<p>who have the statesman's passion struggle to evolve, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_218">dream</a> still</p>
<p>of evolving order.</p>
<p>First, then, you must <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_219">think</a> of Bromstead a hundred and fifty years</p>
<p>ago, as a narrow irregular little street of thatched houses strung</p>
<p>out on the London and Dover Road, a little mellow sample unit of a</p>
<p>social order that had a kind of completeness, at its level, of its</p>
<p>own. At that time its population numbered a little under two</p>
<p>thousand people, mostly engaged in agricultural work or in trades</p>
<p>serving agriculture. There was a blacksmith, a saddler, a chemist,</p>
<p>a doctor, a barber, a linen-draper (who brewed his own beer); a</p>
<p>veterinary surgeon, a hardware shop, and two capacious inns. Round</p>
<p>and about it were a number of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_220">pleasant</a> gentlemen's seats, whose</p>
<p>owners went frequently to London town in their coaches along the</p>
<p>very tolerable high-road. The church was big enough to hold the</p>
<p>whole population, were people <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_221">minded</a> to go to church, and indeed a</p>
<p>large proportion did go, and all who married were married in it, and</p>
<p>everybody, to begin with, was christened at its font and buried at</p>
<p>last in its yew-shaded graveyard. Everybody <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_222">knew</a> everybody in the</p>
<p>place. It was, in fact, a definite place and a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_223">real</a> human community</p>
<p>in those days. There was a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_220">pleasant</a> old market-house in the middle</p>
<p>of the town with a weekly market, and an annual fair at which much</p>
<p>cheerful merry making and homely intoxication occurred; there was a</p>
<p>pack of hounds which hunted within five miles of London Bridge, and</p>
<p>the local gentry would occasionally enliven the place with valiant</p>
<p>cricket matches for a hundred guineas a side, to the vast excitement</p>
<p>of the entire population. It was very much the same sort of place</p>
<p>that it had been for three or four centuries. A Bromstead Rip van</p>
<p>Winkle from 1550 returning in 1750 would have found most of the old</p>
<p>houses still as he had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_224">known</a> them, the same trades a little improved</p>
<p>and differentiated one from the other, the same roads rather more</p>
<p>carefully tended, the Inns not very much altered, the ancient</p>
<p>familiar market-house. The occasional wheeled traffic would have</p>
<p>struck him as the most remarkable difference, next perhaps to the</p>
<p>swaggering painted stone monuments instead of brasses and the</p>
<p>protestant severity of the communion-table in the parish church,-</p>
<p>both from the material point of view very little things. A Rip van</p>
<p>Winkle from 1350, again, would have noticed scarcely greater</p>
<p>changes; fewer clergy, more people, and particularly more people of</p>
<p>the middling sort; the glass in the windows of many of the houses,</p>
<p>the stylish chimneys springing up everywhere would have impressed</p>
<p>him, and suchlike details. The place would have had the same</p>
<p>boundaries, the same broad essential features, would have been still</p>
<p>itself in the way that a man is still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_225">himself</a> after he has "filled</p>
<p>out" a little and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_226">grown</a> a longer beard and changed his clothes.</p>
<p>But after 1750 something got hold of the world, something that was</p>
<p>destined to alter the scale of every human affair.</p>
<p>That something was machinery and a vague energetic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_227">disposition</a> to</p>
<p>improve material things. In another part of England ingenious</p>
<p>people were beginning to use coal in smelting iron, and were</p>
<p>producing metal in abundance and metal castings in sizes that had</p>
<p>hitherto been <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_228">unattainable</a>. Without warning or preparation,</p>
<p>increment involving countless possibilities of further increment was</p>
<p>coming to the strength of horses and men. "Power," all</p>
<p>unsuspected, was flowing like a drug into the veins of the social</p>
<p>body.</p>
<p>Nobody seems to have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_229">perceived</a> this coming of power, and nobody had</p>
<p>calculated its probable consequences. Suddenly, almost</p>
<p>inadvertently, people found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_230">themselves</a> doing things that would have</p>
<p>amazed their ancestors. They began to construct wheeled vehicles</p>
<p>much more easily and cheaply than they had ever done before, to make</p>
<p>up roads and move things about that had formerly been esteemed too</p>
<p>heavy for locomotion, to join woodwork with iron nails instead of</p>
<p>wooden pegs, to achieve all sorts of mechanical possibilities, to</p>
<p>trade more freely and manufacture on a larger scale, to send goods</p>
<p>abroad in a wholesale and systematic way, to bring back commodities</p>
<p>from overseas, not simply spices and fine commodities, but goods in</p>
<p>bulk. The new <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_231">influence</a> spread to agriculture, iron appliances</p>
<p>replaced wooden, breeding of stock became systematic, paper-making</p>
<p>and printing increased and cheapened. Roofs of slate and tile</p>
<p>appeared amidst and presently prevailed over the original Bromstead</p>
<p>thatch, the huge space of Common to the south was extensively</p>
<p>enclosed, and what had been an ill-defined horse-track to Dover,</p>
<p>only passable by adventurous coaches in dry weather, became the</p>
<p>Dover Road, and was presently the route first of one and then of</p>
<p>several daily coaches. The High Street was discovered to be too</p>
<p>tortuous for these <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_232">awakening</a> energies, and a new road cut off its</p>
<p>worst contortions. Residential villas appeared occupied by retired</p>
<p>tradesmen and widows, who esteemed the place healthy, and by others</p>
<p>of a strange new unoccupied class of people who had money invested</p>
<p>in joint-stock enterprises. First one and then several boys'</p>
<p>boarding-schools came, drawing their pupils from London,-my</p>
<p>grandfather's was one of these. London, twelve miles to the north-</p>
<p>west, was making itself <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_233">felt</a> more and more.</p>
<p>But this was only the beginning of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_234">growth</a> period, the first</p>
<p>trickle of the coming flood of mechanical power. Away in the north</p>
<p>they were casting iron in bigger and bigger <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_235">forms</a>, working their way</p>
<p>to the production of steel on a large scale, applying power in</p>
<p>factories. Bromstead had almost <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_236">doubted</a> in size again long before</p>
<p>the railway came; there was hardly any thatch left in the High</p>
<p>Street, but instead were houses with handsome brass-knockered front</p>
<p>doors and several windows, and shops with shop-fronts all of square</p>
<p>glass panes, and the place was lighted publicly now by oil lamps-</p>
<p>previously only one flickering lamp outside each of the coaching</p>
<p>inns had broken the nocturnal darkness. And there was talk, it long</p>
<p>remained talk,-of gas. The gasworks came in 1834, and about that</p>
<p>date my father's three houses must have been built convenient for</p>
<p>the London Road. They mark nearly the beginning of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_237">real</a></p>
<p>suburban quality; they were let at first to City people still</p>
<p>engaged in business.</p>
<p>And then hard on the gasworks had come the railway and cheap coal;</p>
<p>there was a wild outbreak of brickfields upon the claylands to the</p>
<p>east, and the Great <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_238">Growth</a> had begun in earnest. The agricultural</p>
<p>placidities that had formerly come to the very borders of the High</p>
<p>Street were broken up north, west and south, by new roads. This</p>
<p>enterprising person and then that began to "run up" houses,</p>
<p>irrespective of every other enterprising person who was doing the</p>
<p>same thing. A Local Board came into <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_239">existence</a>, and with much</p>
<p>hesitation and penny-wise economy inaugurated drainage works. Rates</p>
<p>became a common topic, a fact of accumulating importance. Several</p>
<p>chapels of zinc and iron appeared, and also a white new church in</p>
<p>commercial Gothic upon the common, and another of red brick in the</p>
<p>residential district out beyond the brickfields towards Chessington.</p>
<p>The population doubled again and doubled again, and became</p>
<p>particularly teeming in the prolific "working-class" district about</p>
<p>the deep-rutted, muddy, coal-blackened roads between the gasworks,</p>
<p>Blodgett's laundries, and the railway goods-yard. Weekly</p>
<p>properties, that is to say small houses built by small property</p>
<p>owners and let by the week, sprang up also in the Cage Fields, and</p>
<p>presently extended right up the London Road. A single national</p>
<p>school in an inconvenient situation set itself inadequately to</p>
<p>collect subscriptions and teach the swarming, sniffing, grimy</p>
<p>offspring of this dingy new population to read. The villages of</p>
<p>Beckington, which used to be three miles to the west, and Blamely</p>
<p>four miles to the east of Bromstead, were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_240">experiencing</a> similar</p>
<p>distensions and proliferations, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_241">grew</a> out to meet us. All <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_242">effect</a></p>
<p>of locality or community had gone from these places long before I</p>
<p>was born; hardly any one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_243">knew</a> any one; there was no general meeting</p>
<p>place any more, the old fairs were just common nuisances haunted by</p>
<p>gypsies, van showmen, Cheap Jacks and London roughs, the churches</p>
<p>were incapable of a quarter of the population. One or two local</p>
<p>papers of shameless veniality reported the proceedings of the local</p>
<p>Bench and the local Board, compelled tradesmen who were interested</p>
<p>in these affairs to advertise, used the epithet "Bromstedian" as one</p>
<p>expressing peculiar <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_244">virtues</a>, and so maintained in the general <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_245">mind</a> a</p>
<p>weak tradition of some local quality that embraced us all. Then the</p>
<p>parish graveyard filled up and became a scandal, and an ambitious</p>
<p>area with an air of appetite was walled in by a Bromstead Cemetery</p>
<p>Company, and planted with suitably high-minded and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_246">sorrowful</a></p>
<p>varieties of conifer. A stonemason took one of the earlier villas</p>
<p>with a front garden at the end of the High Street, and displayed a</p>
<p>supply of urns on pillars and headstones and crosses in stone,</p>
<p>marble, and granite, that would have sufficed to commemorate in</p>
<p>elaborate detail the entire population of Bromstead as one found it</p>
<p>in 1750.</p>
<p>The cemetery was made when I was a little boy of five or six; I was</p>
<p>in the full tide of building and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_247">growth</a> from the first; the second</p>
<p>railway with its station at Bromstead North and the drainage</p>
<p>followed when I was ten or eleven, and all my childish <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_248">memories</a> are</p>
<p>of digging and wheeling, of woods invaded by building, roads gashed</p>
<p>open and littered with iron pipes amidst a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_249">fearful</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_250">smell</a> of gas, of</p>
<p>men peeped at and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_251">seen</a> toiling away deep down in excavations, of</p>
<p>hedges broken down and replaced by planks, of wheelbarrows and</p>
<p>builders' sheds, of rivulets overtaken and swallowed up by drain-</p>
<p>pipes. Big trees, and especially elms, cleared of undergrowth and</p>
<p>left standing amid such things, acquired a peculiar tattered</p>
<p>dinginess rather in the quality of needy widow women who have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_251">seen</a></p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_252">happier</a> days.</p>
<p>The Ravensbrook of my earlier <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_253">memories</a> was a beautiful stream. It</p>
<p>came into my world out of a mysterious Beyond, out of a garden,</p>
<p>splashing brightly down a weir which had once been the weir of a</p>
<p>mill. (Above the weir and inaccessible there were bulrushes <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_254">growing</a></p>
<p>in splendid clumps, and beyond that, pampas grass, yellow and</p>
<p>crimson spikes of hollyhock, and blue suggestions of wonderland.)</p>
<p>From the pool at the foot of this initial cascade it flowed in a</p>
<p>leisurely fashion beside a footpath,-there were two pretty thatchcd</p>
<p>cottages on the left, and here were ducks, and there were willows on</p>
<p>the right,-and so came to where great trees <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_255">grew</a> on high banks on</p>
<p>either hand and bowed closer, and at last met overhead. This part</p>
<p>was difficult to reach because of an old fence, but a little boy</p>
<p>might glimpse that long cavern of greenery by wading. Either I have</p>
<p>actually <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_256">seen</a> kingfishers there, or my father has described them so</p>
<p>accurately to me that he inserted them into my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_253">memory</a>. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_257">remember</a></p>
<p>them there anyhow. Most of that overhung part I never penetrated at</p>
<p>all, but followed the field path with my mother and met the stream</p>
<p>again, where beyond there were flat meadows, Roper's meadows. The</p>
<p>Ravensbrook went meandering across the middle of these, now between</p>
<p>steep banks, and now with wide shallows at the bends where the</p>
<p>cattle waded and drank. Yellow and purple loose-strife and ordinary</p>
<p>rushes <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_255">grew</a> in clumps along the bank, and now and then a willow. On</p>
<p>rare occasions of rapture one might <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_258">see</a> a rat cleaning his whiskers</p>
<p>at the water's edge. The deep places were rich with tangled weeds,</p>
<p>and in them fishes lurked-to me they were big fishes-water-boatmen</p>
<p>and water-beetles traversed the calm surface of these still deeps;</p>
<p>in one pool were yellow lilies and water-soldiers, and in the shoaly</p>
<p>places hovering fleets of small fry basked in the sunshine-to</p>
<p>vanish in a flash at one's shadow. In one place, too, were Rapids,</p>
<p>where the stream <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_259">woke</a> with a start from a dreamless brooding into</p>
<p>foaming panic and babbled and hastened. Well do I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_257">remember</a> that</p>
<p>half-mile of rivulet; all other rivers and cascades have their</p>
<p>reference to it for me. And after I was eleven, and before we left</p>
<p>Bromstead, all the delight and beauty of it was destroyed.</p>
<p>The volume of its water decreased abruptly-I suppose the new</p>
<p>drainage works that linked us up with Beckington, and made me first</p>
<p>acquainted with the geological quality of the London clay, had to do</p>
<p>with that-until only a weak uncleansing trickle remained. That at</p>
<p>first did not strike me as a misfortune. An adventurous small boy</p>
<p>might walk dryshod in places hitherto inaccessible. But hard upon</p>
<p>that came the pegs, the planks and carts and devastation. Roper's</p>
<p>meadows, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_260">being</a> no longer in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_261">fear</a> of floods, were now to be slashed</p>
<p>out into parallelograms of untidy road, and built upon with rows of</p>
<p>working-class cottages. The roads came,-horribly; the houses</p>
<p>followed. They seemed to rise in the night. People moved into them</p>
<p>as soon as the roofs were on, mostly workmen and their young wives,</p>
<p>and already in a year some of these raw houses stood empty again</p>
<p>from defaulting tenants, with windows broken and wood-work warping</p>
<p>and rotting. The Ravensbrook became a dump for old iron, rusty</p>
<p>cans, abandoned boots and the like, and was a river only when</p>
<p>unusual rains filled it for a day or so with an inky flood of</p>
<p>surface water…</p>
<p>That indeed was my most striking <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_262">perception</a> in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_263">growth</a> of</p>
<p>Bromstead. The Ravensbrook had been important to my imaginative</p>
<p>life; that way had always been my first choice in all my walks with</p>
<p>my mother, and its rapid swamping by the new urban <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_263">growth</a> made it</p>
<p>indicative of all the other things that had happened just before my</p>
<p>time, or were still, at a less dramatic pace, happening. I realised</p>
<p>that building was the enemy. I began to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_264">understand</a> why in every</p>
<p>direction out of Bromstead one walked past scaffold-poles into</p>
<p>litter, why fragments of broken brick and cinder mingled in every</p>
<p>path, and the significance of the universal notice-boards, either</p>
<p>white and new or a year old and torn and battered, promising sites,</p>
<p>proffering houses to be sold or let, abusing and intimidating</p>
<p>passers-by for fancied trespass, and protecting rights of way.</p>
<p>It is difficult to disentangle now what I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_265">understood</a> at this time</p>
<p>and what I have since come to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_266">understand</a>, but it seems to me that</p>
<p>even in those childish days I was acutely aware of an invading and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_267">growing</a> disorder. The serene rhythms of the old established</p>
<p>agriculture, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_268">see</a> now, were everywhere <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_269">being</a> replaced by</p>
<p>cultivation under notice and snatch crops; hedges <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_270">ceased</a> to be</p>
<p>repaired, and were replaced by cheap iron railings or chunks of</p>
<p>corrugated iron; more and more hoardings sprang up, and contributed</p>
<p>more and more to the nomad tribes of filthy paper scraps that flew</p>
<p>before the wind and overspread the country. The outskirts of</p>
<p>Bromstead were a maze of exploitation roads that led nowhere, that</p>
<p>ended in tarred fences studded with nails (I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_271">remember</a> barbed</p>
<p>wire in those days; I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_272">think</a> the Zeitgeist did not produce that until</p>
<p>later), and in trespass boards that used vehement language. Broken</p>
<p>glass, tin cans, and ashes and paper abounded. Cheap glass, cheap</p>
<p>tin, abundant fuel, and a free untaxed Press had rushed upon a world</p>
<p>quite unprepared to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_273">dispose</a> of these blessings when the fulness of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_274">enjoyment</a> was past.</p>
<p>I suppose one might have persuaded oneself that all this was but the</p>
<p>replacement of an ancient <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_275">tranquillity</a>, or at least an ancient</p>
<p>balance, by a new order. Only to my eyes, quickened by my father's</p>
<p>intimations, it was manifestly no order at all. It was a multitude</p>
<p>of incoordinated fresh starts, each more sweeping and destructive</p>
<p>than the last, and none of them ever <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_276">really</a> worked out to a ripe and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_277">satisfactory</a> completion. Each left a legacy of products, houses,</p>
<p>humanity, or what not, in its <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_278">wake</a>. It was a sort of progress that</p>
<p>had bolted; it was change out of hand, and going at an unprecedented</p>
<p>pace nowhere in particular.</p>
<p>No, the Victorian epoch was not the dawn of a new era; it was a</p>
<p>hasty, trial experiment, a gigantic experiment of the most slovenly</p>
<p>and wasteful kind. I suppose it was necessary; I suppose all things</p>
<p>are necessary. I suppose that before men will discipline <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_279">themselves</a></p>
<p>to learn and plan, they must first <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_280">see</a> in a hundred convincing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_281">forms</a></p>
<p>the folly and muddle that come from headlong, aimless and haphazard</p>
<p>methods. The nineteenth century was an age of demonstrations, some</p>
<p>of them very impressive demonstrations, of the powers that have come</p>
<p>to mankind, but of permanent achievement, what will our descendants</p>
<p>cherish? It is hard to estimate what grains of precious metal may</p>
<p>not be found in a mud torrent of human production on so large a</p>
<p>scale, but will any one, a hundred years from now, consent to live</p>
<p>in the houses the Victorians built, travel by their roads or</p>
<p>railways, value the furnishings they made to live among or esteem,</p>
<p>except for curious or historical reasons, their prevalent art and</p>
<p>the clipped and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_282">limited</a> literature that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_283">satisfied</a> their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_284">souls</a>?</p>
<p>That age which bore me was indeed a world full of restricted and</p>
<p>undisciplined people, overtaken by power, by possessions and great</p>
<p>new freedoms, and unable to make any civilised use of them whatever;</p>
<p>stricken now by this idea and now by that, tempted first by one</p>
<p>possession and then another to ill-considered attempts; it was my</p>
<p>father's exploitahon of his villa gardens on the wholesale level.</p>
<p>The whole of Bromstead as I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_285">remember</a> it, and as I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_286">saw</a> it last-it is</p>
<p>a year ago now-is a dull useless boiling-up of human activities, an</p>
<p>immense clustering of futilities. It is as unfinished as ever; the</p>
<p>builders' roads still run out and end in mid-field in their old</p>
<p>fashion; the various enterprises jumble in the same hopeless</p>
<p>contradiction, if anything intensified. Pretentious villas jostle</p>
<p>slums, and public-house and tin tabernacle glower at one another</p>
<p>across the cat-haunted lot that intervenes. Roper's meadows are now</p>
<p>quite frankly a slum; back doors and sculleries gape towards the</p>
<p>railway, their yards are hung with tattered washing unashamed; and</p>
<p>there seem to be more boards by the railway every time I pass,</p>
<p>advertising pills and pickles, tonics and condiments, and suchlike</p>
<p>solicitudes of a people with no natural health nor appetite left in</p>
<p>them…</p>
<p>Well, we have to do better. Failure is not failure nor waste wasted</p>
<p>if it sweeps away illusion and lights the road to a plan.</p>

<p>Chaotic indiscipline, ill-adjusted effort, spasmodic aims, these</p>
<p>give the quality of all my Bromstead <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_287">memories</a>. The crowning one of</p>
<p>them all rises to desolating tragedy. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_288">remember</a> now the wan spring</p>
<p>sunshine of that Sunday morning, the stiff <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_289">feeling</a> of best clothes</p>
<p>and aggressive cleanliness and formality, when I and my mother</p>
<p>returned from church to find my father dead. He had been pruning</p>
<p>the grape vine. He had never had a ladder long enough to reach the</p>
<p>sill of the third-floor windows-at house-painting times he had</p>
<p>borrowed one from the plumber who mixed his paint-and he had in his</p>
<p>own happy-go-lucky way contrived a combination of the garden fruit</p>
<p>ladder with a battered kitchen table that served all sorts of odd</p>
<p>purposes in an outhouse. He had stayed up this arrangement by means</p>
<p>of the garden roller, and the roller had at the critical moment-</p>
<p>rolled. He was lying close by the garden door with his head queerly</p>
<p>bent back against a broken and twisted rainwater pipe, an expression</p>
<p>of pacific contentment on his face, a bamboo curtain rod with a</p>
<p>tableknife tied to end of it, still gripped in his hand. We had</p>
<p>been rapping for some time at the front door unable to make him</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_290">hear</a>, and then we came round by the door in the side trellis into</p>
<p>the garden and so discovered him.</p>
<p>"Arthur!" I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_291">remember</a> my mother crying with the strangest break in</p>
<p>her voice, "What are you doing there? Arthur! And-SUNDAY!"</p>
<p>I was coming behind her, musing remotely, when the quality of her</p>
<p>voice roused me. She stood as if she could not go near him. He had</p>
<p>always puzzled her so, he and his ways, and this seemed only another</p>
<p>enigma. Then the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_292">truth</a> dawned on her, she shrieked as if afraid of</p>
<p>him, ran a dozen steps back towards the trellis door and stopped and</p>
<p>clasped her ineffectual gloved hands, leaving me staring blankly,</p>
<p>too astonished for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_293">feeling</a>, at the carelessly flung limbs.</p>
<p>The same idea came to me also. I ran to her. "Mother!" I cried,</p>
<p>pale to the depths of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_294">spirit</a>, "IS HE DEAD?"</p>
<p>I had been <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_295">thinking</a> two minutes before of the cold fruit pie that</p>
<p>glorified our Sunday dinner-table, and how I might perhaps get into</p>
<p>the tree at the end of the garden to read in the afternoon. Now an</p>
<p>immense fact had come down like a curtain and blotted out all my</p>
<p>childish world. My father was lying dead before my eyes… I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_296">perceived</a> that my mother was helpless and that things must he done.</p>
<p>"Mother!" I said, "we must get Doctor Beaseley,-and carry him</p>
<p>indoors."</p>

<p>CHAPTER THE THIRD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCHOLASTIC</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>1</p>
</title>
<p>My formal education began in a small preparatory school in</p>
<p>Bromstead. I went there as a day boy. The charge for my</p>
<p>instruction was mainly set off by the periodic visits of my father</p>
<p>with a large bag of battered fossils to lecture to us upon geology.</p>
<p>I was one of those fortunate youngsters who take readily to school</p>
<p>work, I had a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_297">good</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_298">memory</a>, versatile interests and a considerable</p>
<p>appetite for commendation, and when I was barely twelve I got a</p>
<p>scholarship at the City Merchants School and was entrusted with a</p>
<p>scholar's railway season ticket to Victoria. After my father's</p>
<p>death a large and very animated and solidly built uncle in tweeds</p>
<p>from Staffordshire, Uncle Minter, my mother's sister's husband, with</p>
<p>a remarkable accent and remarkable vowel sounds, who had plunged</p>
<p>into the Bromstead home once or twice for the night but who was</p>
<p>otherwise unknown to me, came on the scene, sold off the three gaunt</p>
<p>houses with the utmost gusto, invested the proceeds and my father's</p>
<p>life insurance money, and got us into a small villa at Penge within</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_299">sight</a> of that immense facade of glass and iron, the Crystal Palace.</p>
<p>Then he retired in a mood of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_300">good-natured</a> contempt to his native</p>
<p>habitat again. We stayed at Penge until my mother's death.</p>
<p>School became a large part of the world to me, absorbing my time and</p>
<p>interest, and I never acquired that detailed and intimate <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_301">knowledge</a></p>
<p>of Penge and the hilly villadom round about, that I have of the town</p>
<p>and outskirts of Bromstead.</p>
<p>It was a district of very much the same <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_302">character</a>, but it was more</p>
<p>completely urbanised and nearer to the centre of things; there were</p>
<p>the same unfinished roads, the same occasional disconcerted hedges</p>
<p>and trees, the same butcher's horse grazing under a builder's</p>
<p>notice-board, the same incidental lapses into slum. The Crystal</p>
<p>Palace grounds cut off a large part of my walking radius to the west</p>
<p>with impassable fences and forbiddingly expensive turnstiles, but it</p>
<p>added to the ordinary spectacle of meteorology a great variety of</p>
<p>gratuitous fireworks which banged and flared away of a night after</p>
<p>supper and drew me abroad to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_303">see</a> them better. Such walks as I took,</p>
<p>to Croydon, Wembledon, West Wickham and Greenwich, impressed upon me</p>
<p>the interminable extent of London's residential suburbs; mile after</p>
<p>mile one went, between houses, villas, rows of cottages, streets of</p>
<p>shops, under railway arches, over railway bridges. I have forgotten</p>
<p>the detailed local characteristics-if there were any-of much of</p>
<p>that region altogether. I was only there two years, and half my</p>
<p>perambulations occurred at dusk or after dark. But with Penge I</p>
<p>associate my first realisations of the wonder and beauty of twilight</p>
<p>and night, the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_304">effect</a> of dark walls reflecting lamplight, and the</p>
<p>mystery of blue haze-veiled hillsides of houses, the glare of shops</p>
<p>by night, the glowing steam and streaming sparks of railway trains</p>
<p>and railway signals lit up in the darkness. My first rambles in the</p>
<p>evening occurred at Penge-I was becoming a big and independent-</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_305">spirited</a> boy-and I began my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_306">experience</a> of smoking during these</p>
<p>twilight prowls with the threepenny packets of American cigarettes</p>
<p>then just appearing in the world.</p>
<p>My life centred upon the City Merchants School. Usually I caught</p>
<p>the eight-eighteen for Victoria, I had a midday meal and tea; four</p>
<p>nights a week I stayed for preparation, and often I was not back</p>
<p>home again until within an hour of my bedtime. I spent my half</p>
<p>holidays at school in order to play cricket and football. This, and</p>
<p>a pretty voracious appetite for miscellaneous reading which was</p>
<p>fostered by the Penge Middleton Library, did not leave me much</p>
<p>leisure for local topography. On Sundays also I sang in the choir</p>
<p>at St. Martin 's Church, and my mother did not like me to walk out</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_307">alone</a> on the Sabbath afternoon, she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_308">herself</a> slumbered, so that I</p>
<p>wrote or read at home. I must confess I was at home as little as I</p>
<p>could contrive.</p>
<p>Home, after my father's death, had become a very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_309">quiet</a> and</p>
<p>uneventful place indeed. My mother had either an unimaginative</p>
<p>temperament or her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_310">mind</a> was greatly occupied with private religious</p>
<p>solicitudes, and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_311">remember</a> her talking to me but little, and that</p>
<p>usually upon topics I was anxious to evade. I had developed my own</p>
<p>view about low-Church theology long before my father's death, and my</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_312">meditation</a> upon that event had finished my secret estrangement from</p>
<p>my mother's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_313">faith</a>. My reason would not permit even a remote chance</p>
<p>of his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_314">being</a> in hell, he was so manifestly not evil, and this</p>
<p>religion would not permit him a remote chance of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_314">being</a> out yet.</p>
<p>When I was a little boy my mother had taught me to read and write</p>
<p>and pray and had done many things for me, indeed she persisted in</p>
<p>washing me and even in making my clothes until I rebelled against</p>
<p>these things as indignities. But our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_310">minds</a> parted very soon. She</p>
<p>never began to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_315">understand</a> the mental processes of my play, she never</p>
<p>interested <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_316">herself</a> in my school life and work, she could not</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_315">understand</a> things I said; and she came, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_317">think</a>, quite insensibly to</p>
<p>regard me with something of the same hopeless perplexity she had</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_318">felt</a> towards my father.</p>
<p>Him she must have wedded under considerable delusions. I do not</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_319">think</a> he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_320">deceived</a> her, indeed, nor do I suspect him of mercenariness</p>
<p>in their union; but no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_321">doubt</a> he played up to her requirements in the</p>
<p>half ingenuous way that was and still is the quality of most wooing,</p>
<p>and presented <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_322">himself</a> as a very brisk and orthodox young man. I</p>
<p>wonder why nearly all lovemaking has to be fraudulent. Afterwards</p>
<p>he must have disappointed her cruelly by letting one aspect after</p>
<p>another of his careless, sceptical, experimental temperament appear.</p>
<p>Her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_323">mind</a> was fixed and definite, she embodied all that confidence in</p>
<p>church and decorum and the assurances of the pulpit which was</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_324">characteristic</a> of the large mass of the English people-for after</p>
<p>all, the rather low-Church section WAS the largest single mass-in</p>
<p>early Victorian times. She had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_325">dreams</a>, I suspect, of going to</p>
<p>church with him side by side; she in a little poke bonnet and a</p>
<p>large flounced crinoline, all mauve and magenta and starched under a</p>
<p>little lace-trimmed parasol, and he in a tall silk hat and peg-top</p>
<p>trousers and a roll-collar coat, and looking rather like the Prince</p>
<p>Consort,-white angels almost visibly raining benedictions on their</p>
<p>amiable progress. Perhaps she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_325">dreamt</a> gently of much-belaced babies</p>
<p>and an interestingly pious (but not too dissenting or fanatical)</p>
<p>little girl or boy or so, also angel-haunted. And I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_319">think</a>, too, she</p>
<p>must have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_326">seen</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_327">herself</a> ruling a seemly "home of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_328">taste</a>," with a</p>
<p>vivarium in the conservatory that opened out of the drawing-room, or</p>
<p>again, making preserves in the kitchen. My father's science-</p>
<p>teaching, his diagrams of disembowelled humanity, his pictures of</p>
<p>prehistoric beasts that contradicted the Flood, his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_329">disposition</a></p>
<p>towards soft shirts and loose tweed suits, his inability to use a</p>
<p>clothes brush, his spasmodic reading fits and his bulldog pipes,</p>
<p>must have jarred cruelly with her rather unintelligent</p>
<p>anticipations. His wild moments of violent temper when he would</p>
<p>swear and smash things, absurd almost lovable storms that passed</p>
<p>like summer thunder, must have been starkly dreadful to her. She</p>
<p>was constitutionally inadaptable, and certainly made no attempt to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_330">understand</a> or tolerate these outbreaks. She tried them by her</p>
<p>standards, and by her standards they were wrong. Her standards hid</p>
<p>him from her. The blazing things he said rankled in her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_323">mind</a></p>
<p>unforgettably.</p>
<p>As I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_331">remember</a> them together they chafed constantly. Her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_332">attitude</a> to</p>
<p>nearly all his moods and all his enterprises was a sceptical</p>
<p>disapproval. She treated him as something that belonged to me and</p>
<p>not to her. "YOUR father," she used to call him, as though I had</p>
<p>got him for her.</p>
<p>She had married late and she had, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_333">think</a>, become mentally self-</p>
<p>subsisting before her marriage. Even in those Herne Hill days I</p>
<p>used to wonder what was going on in her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_334">mind</a>, and I find that old</p>
<p>speculative curiosity return as I write this. She took a</p>
<p>considerable interest in the housework that our generally</p>
<p>servantless <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_335">condition</a> put upon her-she used to have a charwoman in</p>
<p>two or three times a week-but she did not do it with any great</p>
<p>skill. She covered most of our furniture with flouncey ill-fitting</p>
<p>covers, and she cooked plainly and without very much judgment. The</p>
<p>Penge house, as it contained nearly all our Bromstead things, was</p>
<p>crowded with furniture, and is chiefly associated in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_334">mind</a> with</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_336">smell</a> of turpentine, a condiment she used very freely upon the</p>
<p>veneered mahogany pieces. My mother had an equal dread of "blacks"</p>
<p>by day and the "night air," so that our brightly clean windows were</p>
<p>rarely open.</p>
<p>She took a morning paper, and she would open it and glance at the</p>
<p>headlines, but she did not read it until the afternoon and then, I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_337">think</a>, she was interested only in the more violent crimes, and in</p>
<p>railway and mine disasters and in the minutest domesticities of the</p>
<p>Royal Family. Most of the books at home were my father's, and I do</p>
<p>not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_337">think</a> she opened any of them. She had one or two volumes that</p>
<p>dated from her own youth, and she tried in vain to interest me in</p>
<p>them; there was Miss Strickland's QUEENS OF ENGLAND, a book I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_338">remember</a> with particular animosity, and QUEECHY and the WIDE WIDE</p>
<p>WORLD. She made these books of hers into a class apart by sewing</p>
<p>outer covers upon them of calico and figured muslin. To me in these</p>
<p>habiliments they seemed not so much books as confederated old</p>
<p>ladies.</p>
<p>My mother was also very punctual with her religious duties, and</p>
<p>rejoiced to watch me in the choir.</p>
<p>On winter evenings she occupied an armchair on the other side of the</p>
<p>table at which I sat, head on hand reading, and she would be darning</p>
<p>stockings or socks or the like. We achieved an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_339">effect</a> of rather</p>
<p>stuffy <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_340">comfortableness</a> that was soporific, and in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_341">passive</a> way I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_342">think</a> she found these among her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_343">happy</a> times. On such occasions she</p>
<p>was wont to put her work down on her knees and fall into a sort of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_344">thoughtless</a> musing that would last for long intervals and rouse my</p>
<p>curiosity. For like most young people I could not imagine mental</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_345">states</a> without definite <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_346">forms</a>.</p>
<p>She carried on a correspondence with a number of cousins and</p>
<p>friends, writing letters in a slanting Italian hand and dealing</p>
<p>mainly with births, marriages and deaths, business starts (in the</p>
<p>vaguest terms) and the distresses of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>And yet, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_347">know</a>, she did have a curious intimate life of her own</p>
<p>that I suspected nothing of at the time, that only now becomes</p>
<p>credible to me. She kept a diary that is still in my possession, a</p>
<p>diary of fragmentary entries in a miscellaneous collection of pocket</p>
<p>books. She put down the texts of the sermons she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_348">heard</a>, and queer</p>
<p>stiff little comments on casual visitors,-" Miss G. and much noisy</p>
<p>shrieking talk about games and such frivolities and CROQUAY. A.</p>
<p>delighted and VERY ATTENTIVE." Such little human entries abound.</p>
<p>She had an odd way of never writing a name, only an initial; my</p>
<p>father is always "A.," and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_349">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_350">am</a> always "D." It is manifest she</p>
<p>followed the domestic events in the life of the Princess of Wales,</p>
<p>who is now Queen Mother, with peculiar interest and sympathy. "Pray</p>
<p>G. all may be well," she writes in one such crisis.</p>
<p>But there are things about <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_351">myself</a> that I still find too poignant to</p>
<p>tell easily, certain <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_352">painful</a> and clumsy circumstances of my birth in</p>
<p>very great detail, the distresses of my infantile ailments. Then</p>
<p>later I find such things as this: "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_353">Heard</a> D. s--." The "s" is</p>
<p>evidently "swear "-" G. bless and keep my boy from evil." And</p>
<p>again, with the thin handwriting shaken by distress: "D. would not</p>
<p>go to church, and hardened his heart and said wicked infidel things,</p>
<p>much disrespect of the clergy. The anthem is tiresome!!! That men</p>
<p>should set up to be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_354">wiser</a> than their maker!!!" Then trebly</p>
<p>underlined: "I FEAR HIS FATHER'S TEACHING." Dreadful little tangle</p>
<p>of misapprehensions and false judgments! More <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_355">comforting</a> for me to</p>
<p>read, "D. very kind and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_356">good</a>. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_357">grows</a> more <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_358">thoughtful</a> every day."</p>
<p>I suspect <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_351">myself</a> of forgotten hypocrisies.</p>
<p>At just one point my mother's papers seem to dip deeper. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_359">think</a></p>
<p>the death of my father must have stirred her for the first time for</p>
<p>many years to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_359">think</a> for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_360">herself</a>. Even she could not go on living in</p>
<p>any peace at all, believing that he had indeed been flung headlong</p>
<p>into hell. Of this gnawing solicitude she never spoke to me, never,</p>
<p>and for her diary also she could find no phrases. But on a loose</p>
<p>half-sheet of notepaper between its pages I find this passage that</p>
<p>follows, written very carefully. I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_361">know</a> whose lines they are</p>
<p>nor how she came upon them. They run:-</p>
<p>"And if there be no meeting past the grave;</p>
<p>If all is darkness, silence, yet 'tis <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_362">rest</a>.</p>
<p>Be not afraid ye waiting hearts that weep,</p>
<p>For God still giveth His beloved sleep,</p>
<p>And if an endless sleep He wills, so best."</p>
<p>That scrap of verse amazed me when I read it. I could even wonder</p>
<p>if my mother <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_363">really</a> grasped the import of what she had copied out.</p>
<p>It affected me as if a stone-deaf person had suddenly turned and</p>
<p>joined in a whispered conversation. It set me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_364">thinking</a> how far a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_365">mind</a> in its general <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_366">effect</a> quite hopelessly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_367">limited</a>, might range.</p>
<p>After that I went through all her diaries, trying to find something</p>
<p>more than a conventional term of tenderness for my father. But I</p>
<p>found nothing. And yet somehow there <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_368">grew</a> upon me the realisation</p>
<p>that there had been love… Her love for me, on the other hand,</p>
<p>was abundantly expressed.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_369">knew</a> nothing of that secret life of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_370">feeling</a> at the time; such</p>
<p>expression as it found was all beyond my schoolboy range. I did not</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_371">know</a> when I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_372">pleased</a> her and I did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_371">know</a> when I distressed her.</p>
<p>Chiefly I was aware of my mother as rather dull company, as a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_373">mind</a></p>
<p>thorny with irrational conclusions and incapable of explication, as</p>
<p>one believing quite wilfully and irritatingly in impossible things.</p>
<p>So I suppose it had to be; life was coming to me in new <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_374">forms</a> and</p>
<p>with new requirements. It was essential to our situation that we</p>
<p>should fail to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_375">understand</a>. After this space of years I have come to</p>
<p>realisations and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_376">attitudes</a> that dissolve my estrangement from her, I</p>
<p>can pierce these barriers, I can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_377">see</a> her and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_378">feel</a> her as a loving</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_370">feeling</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_379">desiring</a> and muddle-headed person. There are times</p>
<p>when I would have her alive again, if only that I might be kind to</p>
<p>her for a little while and give her some return for the narrow</p>
<p>intense affection, the tender <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_379">desires</a>, she evidently lavished so</p>
<p>abundantly on me. But then again I ask how I could make that</p>
<p>return? And I realise the futility of such <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_380">dreaming</a>. Her demand</p>
<p>was rigid, and to meet it I should need to act and lie.</p>
<p>So she whose blood fed me, whose body made me, lies in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_381">memory</a> as</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_382">saw</a> her last, fixed, still, infinitely intimate, infinitely</p>
<p>remote…</p>
<p>My own case with my mother, however, does not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_383">awaken</a> the same regret</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_384">feel</a> when I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_385">think</a> of how she misjudged and irked my father, and</p>
<p>turned his weaknesses into thorns for her own tormenting. I wish I</p>
<p>could look back without that little twinge to two people who were</p>
<p>both in their different quality so <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_386">good</a>. But <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_387">goodness</a> that is</p>
<p>narrow is a pedestrian and ineffectual <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_387">goodness</a>. Her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_388">attitude</a> to my</p>
<p>father seems to me one of the essentially tragic things that have</p>
<p>come to me personally, one of those things that nothing can</p>
<p>transfigure, that REMAIN <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_389">sorrowful</a>, that I cannot soothe with any</p>
<p>explanation, for as I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_390">remember</a> him he was indeed the most lovable of</p>
<p>weak spasmodic men. But my mother had been trained in a hard and</p>
<p>narrow system that made evil out of many things not in the least</p>
<p>evil, and inculcated neither kindliness nor charity. All their</p>
<p>estrangement followed from that.</p>
<p>These cramping cults do indeed take an enormous toll of human love</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_391">happiness</a>, and not only that but what we Machiavellians must</p>
<p>needs consider, they make frightful breaches in human solidarity. I</p>
<p>suppose <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_392">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_393">am</a> a deeply religious man, as men of my quality go, but I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_394">hate</a> more and more, as I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_395">grow</a> older, the shadow of intolerance cast</p>
<p>by religious organisations. All my life has been darkened by</p>
<p>irrational intolerance, by arbitrary irrational prohibitions and</p>
<p>exclusions. Mahometanism with its fierce proselytism, has, I</p>
<p>suppose, the blackest record of uncharitableness, but most of the</p>
<p>Christian sects are tainted, tainted to a degree beyond any of the</p>
<p>anterior paganisms, with this same <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_396">hateful</a> quality. It is their</p>
<p>exclusive claim that sends them wrong, the vain ambition that</p>
<p>inspires them all to teach a uniform one-sided God and be the one</p>
<p>and only gateway to salvation. Deprecation of all outside the</p>
<p>household of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_397">faith</a>, an organised undervaluation of heretical</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_398">goodness</a> and lovableness, follows, necessarily. Every petty</p>
<p>difference is exaggerated to the quality of a saving grace or a</p>
<p>damning defect. Elaborate precautions are taken to shield the</p>
<p>believer's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_399">mind</a> against broad or amiable suggestions; the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_400">faithful</a></p>
<p>are deterred by dark allusions, by sinister warnings, from books,</p>
<p>from theatres, from worldly conversation, from all the kindly</p>
<p>instruments that mingle human sympathy. For only by isolating its</p>
<p>flock can the organisation survive.</p>
<p>Every month there came to my mother a little magazine called, if I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_401">remember</a> rightly, the HOME CHURCHMAN, with the combined authority of</p>
<p>print and clerical commendation. It was the most evil thing that</p>
<p>ever came into the house, a very devil, a thin little pamphlet with</p>
<p>one woodcut illustration on the front page of each number; now the</p>
<p>uninviting visage of some exponent of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_402">real</a> and only doctrine and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_403">attitudes</a>, now some coral strand in act of welcoming the</p>
<p>missionaries of God's mysterious preferences, now a new church in</p>
<p>the Victorian Gothic. The vile rag it was! A score of vices that</p>
<p>shun the policeman have nothing of its subtle wickedness. It was an</p>
<p>outrage upon the natural kindliness of men. The contents were all</p>
<p>admirably adjusted to keep a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_404">spirit</a> in prison. Their force of</p>
<p>sustained suggestion was tremendous. There would be dreadful</p>
<p>intimations of the swift retribution that fell upon individuals for</p>
<p>Sabbath-breaking, and upon nations for weakening towards Ritualism,</p>
<p>or treating Roman Catholics as tolerable human beings; there would</p>
<p>be great rejoicings over the conversion of alleged Jews, and</p>
<p>terrible descriptions of the death-beds of prominent infidels with</p>
<p>boldly invented last words,-the most unscrupulous lying; there</p>
<p>would be the appallingly edifying careers of "early piety"</p>
<p>lusciously described, or stories of condemned criminals who traced</p>
<p>their final ruin unerringly to early laxities of the kind that leads</p>
<p>people to give up subscribing to the HOME CHURCHMAN.</p>
<p>Every month that evil <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_405">spirit</a> brought about a slump in our mutual</p>
<p>love. My mother used to read the thing and become <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_406">depressed</a> and</p>
<p>anxious for my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_407">spiritual</a> welfare, used to be stirred to</p>
<p>unintelligent pestering…</p>

</title>
<p>A few years ago I met the editor of this same HOME CHURCHMAN. It</p>
<p>was at one of the weekly dinners of that Fleet Street dining club,</p>
<p>the Blackfriars.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_408">heard</a> the paper's name with a queer little shock and surveyed the</p>
<p>man with interest. No <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_409">doubt</a> he was only a successor of the purveyor</p>
<p>of discords who darkened my boyhood. It was amazing to find an</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_410">influence</a> so terrible embodied in a creature so palpably petty. He</p>
<p>was seated some way down a table at right angles to the one at which</p>
<p>I sat, a man of mean appearance with a greyish complexion, thin,</p>
<p>with a square nose, a heavy wiry moustache and a big Adam's apple</p>
<p>sticking out between the wings of his collar. He ate with</p>
<p>considerable appetite and unconcealed relish, and as his jaw was</p>
<p>underhung, he chummed and made the moustache wave like reeds in the</p>
<p>swell of a steamer. It gave him a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_411">conscientious</a> look. After dinner</p>
<p>he a little forced <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_412">himself</a> upon me. At that time, though the shadow</p>
<p>of my scandal was already upon me, I still seemed to be shaping for</p>
<p>great successes, and he was glad to be in conversation with me and</p>
<p>anxious to intimate political sympathy and support. I tried to make</p>
<p>him talk of the HOME CHURCHMAN and the kindred publications he ran,</p>
<p>but he was manifestly ashamed of his job so far as I was concerned.</p>
<p>"One wants," he said, pitching <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_413">himself</a> as he supposed in my key, "to</p>
<p>put constructive ideas into our readers, but they are narrow, you</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_414">know</a>, very narrow. Very." He made his moustache and lips express</p>
<p>judicious regret. "One has to consider them carefully, one has to</p>
<p>respect their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_415">attitudes</a>. One dare not go too far with them. One</p>
<p>has to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_416">feel</a> one's way."</p>
<p>He chummed and the moustache bristled.</p>
<p>A hireling, beyond question, catering for a demand. I gathered</p>
<p>there was a home in Tufnell Park, and three boys to be fed and</p>
<p>clothed and educated…</p>
<p>I had the curiosity to buy a copy of his magazine afterwards, and it</p>
<p>seemed much the same sort of thing that had worried my mother in my</p>
<p>boyhood. There was the usual Christian hero, this time with mutton-</p>
<p>chop whiskers and a long bare upper lip. The Jesuits, it seemed,</p>
<p>were still hard at it, and Heaven frightfully upset about the Sunday</p>
<p>opening of museums and the falling birth-rate, and as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_417">touchy</a> and</p>
<p>vindictive as ever. There were two vigorous paragraphs upon the</p>
<p>utter damnableness of the Rev. R. J. Campbell, a contagious</p>
<p>damnableness I gathered, one wasn't safe within a mile of Holborn</p>
<p>Viaduct, and a foul-mouthed attack on poor little Wilkins the</p>
<p>novelist-who was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_418">being</a> baited by the moralists at that time for</p>
<p>making one of his big women <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_419">characters</a>, not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_418">being</a> in holy wedlock,</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_420">desire</a> a baby and say so…</p>
<p>The broadening of human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_421">thought</a> is a slow and complex process. We</p>
<p>do go on, we do get on. But when one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_421">thinks</a> that people are living</p>
<p>and dying now, quarrelling and sulking, misled and misunderstanding,</p>
<p>vaguely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_422">fearful</a>, condemning and thwarting one another in the close</p>
<p>darknesses of these narrow cults-Oh, God! one wants a gale out of</p>
<p>Heaven, one wants a great wind from the sea!</p>

<p>While I lived at Penge two little things happened to me, trivial in</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_423">themselves</a> and yet in their quality profoundly significant. They</p>
<p>had this in common, that they pierced the texture of the life I was</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_424">quietly</a> taking for granted and let me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_425">see</a> through it into realities-</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_426">realities</a> I had indeed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_427">known</a> about before but never realised. Each</p>
<p>of these <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_428">experiences</a> left me with a sense of shock, with all the</p>
<p>values in my life perplexingly altered, attempting readjustment.</p>
<p>One of these disturbing and illuminating events was that I was</p>
<p>robbed of a new pocket-knife and the other that I fell in love. It</p>
<p>was altogether surprising to me to be robbed. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_425">see</a>, as an only</p>
<p>child I had always been fairly well looked after and protected, and</p>
<p>the result was an amazing confidence in the practical <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_429">goodness</a> of</p>
<p>the people one met in the world. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_430">knew</a> there were robbers in the</p>
<p>world, just as I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_430">knew</a> there were tigers; that I was ever likely to</p>
<p>meet robber or tiger face to face seemed equally impossible.</p>
<p>The knife as I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_431">remember</a> it was a particularly jolly one with all</p>
<p>sorts of instruments in it, tweezers and a thing for getting a stone</p>
<p>out of the hoof of a horse, and a corkscrew; it had cost me a</p>
<p>carefuly accumulated half-crown, and amounted indeed to a new</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_432">experience</a> in knives. I had had it for two or three days, and then</p>
<p>one afternoon I dropped it through a hole in my pocket on a footpath</p>
<p>crossing a field between Penge and Anerley. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_433">heard</a> it fall in the</p>
<p>way one does without at the time appreciating what had happened,</p>
<p>then, later, before I got home, when my hand wandered into my pocket</p>
<p>to embrace the still dear new possession I found it gone, and</p>
<p>instantly that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_434">memory</a> of something hitting the ground sprang up into</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_435">consciousness</a>. I went back and commenced a search. Almost</p>
<p>immediately I was accosted by the leader of a little gang of four or</p>
<p>five extremely dirty and ragged boys of assorted sizes and slouching</p>
<p>carriage who were coming from the Anerley direction.</p>
<p>"Lost anythink, Matey?" said he.</p>
<p>I explained.</p>
<p>"'E's dropped 'is knife," said my interlocutor, and joined in the</p>
<p>search.</p>
<p>"What sort of 'andle was it, Matey?" said a small white-faced</p>
<p>sniffing boy in a big bowler hat.</p>
<p>I supplied the information. His sharp little face scrutinised the</p>
<p>ground about us.</p>
<p>"GOT it," he said, and pounced.</p>
<p>"Give it 'ere," said the big boy hoarsely, and secured it.</p>
<p>I walked towards him serenely confident that he would hand it over</p>
<p>to me, and that all was for the best in the best of all possible</p>
<p>worlds.</p>
<p>"No bloomin' <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_436">fear</a>!" he said, regarding me obliquely. "Oo said it</p>
<p>was your knife?"</p>
<p>Remarkable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_437">doubts</a> assailed me. "Of course it's my knife," I said.</p>
<p>The other boys gathered round me.</p>
<p>"This ain't your knife," said the big boy, and spat casually.</p>
<p>"I dropped it just now."</p>
<p>"Findin's keepin's, I believe," said the big boy.</p>
<p>"Nonsense," I said. "Give me my knife."</p>
<p>"'Ow many blades it got?"</p>
<p>"Three."</p>
<p>"And what sort of 'andle?"</p>
<p>"Bone."</p>
<p>"Got a corkscrew like?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Ah! This ain't your knife no'ow. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_438">See</a>?"</p>
<p>He made no offer to show it to me. My breath went.</p>
<p>"Look here!" I said. "I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_439">saw</a> that kid pick it up. It IS my knife."</p>
<p>"Rot!" said the big boy, and slowly, deliberately put my knife into</p>
<p>his trouser pocket.</p>
<p>I braced my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_440">soul</a> for battle. All civilisation was behind me, but I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_441">doubt</a> if it kept the colour in my face. I buttoned my jacket and</p>
<p>clenched my fists and advanced on my antagonist-he had, I suppose,</p>
<p>the advantage of two years of age and three inches of height. "Hand</p>
<p>over that knife," I said.</p>
<p>Then one of the smallest of the band assailed me with extraordinary</p>
<p>vigour and swiftness from behind, had an arm round my neck and a</p>
<p>knee in my back before I had the slightest intimation of attack, and</p>
<p>so got me down. "I got 'im, Bill," squeaked this amazing little</p>
<p>ruffian. My nose was flattened by a dirty hand, and as I struck out</p>
<p>and hit something like sacking, some one kicked my elbow. Two or</p>
<p>three seemed to be at me at the same time. Then I rolled over and</p>
<p>sat up to discover them all making off, a ragged flight, footballing</p>
<p>my cap, my City Merchants' cap, amongst them. I leapt to my feet in</p>
<p>a passion of indignation and pursued them.</p>
<p>But I did not overtake them. We are beings of mixed composition,</p>
<p>and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_442">doubt</a> if mine was a single-minded pursuit. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_443">knew</a> that honour</p>
<p>required me to pursue, and I had a vivid impression of having just</p>
<p>been down in the dust with a very wiry and active and dirty little</p>
<p>antagonist of disagreeable odour and incredible and incalculable</p>
<p>unscrupulousness, kneeling on me and gripping my arm and neck. I</p>
<p>wanted of course to be even with him, but also I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_442">doubted</a> if catching</p>
<p>him would necessarily involve that. They kicked my cap into the</p>
<p>ditch at the end of the field, and made off compactly along a cinder</p>
<p>lane while I turned aside to recover my dishonoured headdress. As I</p>
<p>knocked the dust out of that and out of my jacket, and brushed my</p>
<p>knees and readjusted my very crumpled collar, I tried to focus this</p>
<p>startling occurrence in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_444">mind</a>.</p>
<p>I had vague ideas of going to a policeman or of complaining at a</p>
<p>police station, but some boyish instinct against informing prevented</p>
<p>that. No <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_445">doubt</a> I entertained ideas of vindictive pursuit and</p>
<p>murderous reprisals. And I was acutely enraged whenever I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_446">thought</a></p>
<p>of my knife. The thing indeed rankled in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_447">mind</a> for weeks and</p>
<p>weeks, and altered all the flavour of my world for me. It was the</p>
<p>first time I glimpsed the simple brute violence that lurks and peeps</p>
<p>beneath our civilisation. A certain kindly complacency of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_448">attitude</a></p>
<p>towards the palpably lower classes was qualified for ever</p>
</section>

</title>
<p>But the other <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_449">experience</a> was still more cardinal. It was the first</p>
<p>clear intimation of a new motif in life, the sex motif, that was to</p>
<p>rise and increase and accumulate power and enrichment and interweave</p>
<p>with and at last dominate all my life.</p>
<p>It was when I was nearly fifteen this happened. It is inseparably</p>
<p>connected in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_450">mind</a> with the dusk of warm September evenings. I</p>
<p>never met the girl I loved by daylight, and I have forgotten her</p>
<p>name. It was some insignificant name.</p>
<p>Yet the peculiar quality of the adventure keeps it shining darkly</p>
<p>like some deep coloured gem in the common setting of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_451">memories</a>.</p>
<p>It came as something new and strange, something that did not join on</p>
<p>to anything else in my life or connect with any of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_452">thoughts</a> or</p>
<p>beliefs or habits; it was a wonder, a mystery, a discovery about</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_453">myself</a>, a discovery about the whole world. Only in after years did</p>
<p>sexual <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_454">feeling</a> lose that isolation and spread itself out to</p>
<p>illuminate and pervade and at last possess the whole broad vision of</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>It was in that phase of an urban youth's development, the phase of</p>
<p>the cheap cigarette, that this thing happened. One evening I came</p>
<p>by chance on a number of young people promenading by the light of a</p>
<p>row of shops towards Beckington, and, with all the glory of a</p>
<p>glowing cigarette between my lips, I joined their strolling number.</p>
<p>These twilight parades of young people, youngsters chiefly of the</p>
<p>lower middle-class, are one of the odd social developments of the</p>
<p>great suburban growths-unkindly critics, blind to the inner</p>
<p>meanings of things, call them, I believe, Monkeys' Parades-the shop</p>
<p>apprentices, the young work girls, the boy clerks and so forth,</p>
<p>stirred by mysterious intimations, spend their first-earned money</p>
<p>upon collars and ties, chiffon hats, smart lace collars, walking-</p>
<p>sticks, sunshades or cigarettes, and come valiantly into the vague</p>
<p>transfiguring mingling of gaslight and evening, to walk up and down,</p>
<p>to eye meaningly, even to accost and make friends. It is a queer</p>
<p>instinctive revolt from the narrow <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_455">limited</a> friendless homes in which</p>
<p>so many find <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_456">themselves</a>, a going out towards something, romance if</p>
<p>you will, beauty, that has suddenly become a need-a need that</p>
<p>hitherto has lain dormant and unsuspected. They promenade.</p>
<p>Vulgar!-it is as vulgar as the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_457">spirit</a> that calls the moth abroad in</p>
<p>the evening and lights the body of the glow-worm in the night. I</p>
<p>made my way through the throng, a little contemptuously as became a</p>
<p>public schoolboy, my hands in my pockets-none of your cheap canes</p>
<p>for me!-and very careful of the lie of my cigarette upon my lips.</p>
<p>And two girls passed me, one a little taller than the other, with</p>
<p>dim warm-tinted faces under clouds of dark hair and with dark eyes</p>
<p>like pools reflecting stars.</p>
<p>I half turned, and the shorter one glanced back at me over her</p>
<p>shoulder-I could draw you now the pose of her cheek and neck and</p>
<p>shoulder-and instantly I was as passionately in love with the girl</p>
<p>as I have ever been before or since, as any man ever was with any</p>
<p>woman. I turned about and followed them, I flung away my cigarette</p>
<p>ostentatiously and lifted my school cap and spoke to them.</p>
<p>The girl answered shyly with her dark eyes on my face. What I said</p>
<p>and what she said I cannot <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_458">remember</a>, but I have little <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_459">doubt</a> it was</p>
<p>something absolutely vapid. It <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_460">really</a> did not matter; the thing was</p>
<p>we had met. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_461">felt</a> as I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_462">think</a> a new-hatched moth must <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_461">feel</a> when</p>
<p>suddenly its urgent headlong searching brings it in tremulous</p>
<p>amazement upon its mate.</p>
<p>We met, covered from each other, with all the nets of civilisation</p>
<p>keeping us apart. We walked side by side.</p>
<p>It led to scarcely more than that. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_463">think</a> we met four or five</p>
<p>times altogether, and always with her nearly silent elder sister on</p>
<p>the other side of her. We walked on the last two occasions arm in</p>
<p>arm, furtively caressing each other's hands, we went away from the</p>
<p>glare of the shops into the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_464">quiet</a> roads of villadom, and there we</p>
<p>whispered instead of talking and looked closely into one another's</p>
<p>warm and shaded face. "Dear," I whispered very daringly, and she</p>
<p>answered, "Dear!" We had a vague sense that we wanted more of that</p>
<p>quality of intimacy and more. We wanted each other as one wants</p>
<p>beautiful music again or to breathe again the scent of flowers.</p>
<p>And that is all there was between us. The events are nothing, the</p>
<p>thing that matters is the way in which this <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_465">experience</a> stabbed</p>
<p>through the common stuff of life and left it pierced, with a light,</p>
<p>with a huge new interest shining through the rent.</p>
<p>When I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_466">think</a> of it I can recall even now the warm mystery of her</p>
<p>face, her lips a little apart, lips that I never kissed, her soft</p>
<p>shadowed throat, and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_467">feel</a> again the sensuous stir of her</p>
<p>proximity…</p>
<p>Those two girls never told me their surname nor let me approach</p>
<p>their house. They made me leave them at the corner of a road of</p>
<p>small houses near Penge Station. And quite abruptly, without any</p>
<p>intimation, they vanished and came to the meeting place no more,</p>
<p>they vanished as a moth goes out of a window into the night, and</p>
<p>left me possessed of an intolerable want…</p>
<p>The affair pervaded my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_468">existence</a> for many weeks. I could not do my</p>
<p>work and I could not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_469">rest</a> at home. Night after night I promenaded</p>
<p>up and down that Monkeys' Parade full of an unappeasable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_470">desire</a>,</p>
<p>with a thwarted sense of something just begun that ought to have</p>
<p>gone on. I went backwards and forwards on the way to the vanishing</p>
<p>place, and at last explored the forbidden road that had swallowed</p>
<p>them up. But I never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_471">saw</a> her again, except that later she came to</p>
<p>me, my symbol of womanhood, in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_472">dreams</a>. How my blood was stirred! I</p>
<p>lay <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_473">awake</a> of nights whispering in the darkness for her. I prayed</p>
<p>for her.</p>
<p>Indeed that girl, who probably forgot the last vestiges of me when</p>
<p>her first <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_474">real</a> kiss came to her, ruled and haunted me, gave a Queen</p>
<p>to my imagination and a texture to all my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_475">desires</a> until I became a</p>
<p>man.</p>
<p>I generalised her at last. I suddenly discovered that poetry was</p>
<p>about her and that she was the key to all that had hitherto seemed</p>
<p>nonsense about love. I took to reading novels, and if the heroine</p>
<p>could not possibly be like her, dusky and warm and starlike, I put</p>
<p>the book aside…</p>
<p>I hesitate and add here one other confession. I want to tell this</p>
<p>thing because it seems to me we are altogether too restrained and</p>
<p>secretive about such matters. The cardinal thing in life sneaks in</p>
<p>to us darkly and shamefully like a thief in the night.</p>
<p>One day during my Cambridge days-it must have been in my first year</p>
<p>before I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_476">knew</a> Hatherleigh-I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_477">saw</a> in a print-shop window near the</p>
<p>Strand an engraving of a girl that reminded me sharply of Penge and</p>
<p>its dusky encounter. It was just a half length of a bare-</p>
<p>shouldered, bare-breasted Oriental with arms akimbo, smiling</p>
<p>faintly. I looked at it, went my way, then turned back and bought</p>
<p>it. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_478">felt</a> I must have it. The odd thing is that I was more than a</p>
<p>little shamefaced about it. I did not have it framed and hung in my</p>
<p>room open to the criticism of my friends, but I kept it in the</p>
<p>drawer of my writing-table. And I kept that drawer locked for a</p>
<p>year. It speedily merged with and became identified with the dark</p>
<p>girl of Penge. That engraving became in a way my mistress. Often</p>
<p>when I had sported my oak and was supposed to be reading, I was</p>
<p>sitting with it before me.</p>
<p>Obeying some instinct I kept the thing very secret indeed. For a</p>
<p>time nobody suspected what was locked in my drawer nor what was</p>
<p>locked in me. I seemed as sexless as my world required.</p>
</section>

</title>
<p>These things stabbed through my life, intimations of things above</p>
<p>and below and before me. They had an air of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_479">being</a> no more than</p>
<p>incidents, interruptions.</p>
<p>The broad substance of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_480">existence</a> at this time was the City</p>
<p>Merchants School. Home was a place where I slept and read, and the</p>
<p>mooning explorations of the south-eastern postal district which</p>
<p>occupied the restless evenings and spare days of my vacations mere</p>
<p>interstices, giving glimpses of enigmatical lights and distant</p>
<p>spaces between the woven threads of a school-boy's career. School</p>
<p>life began for me every morning at Herne Hill, for there I was</p>
<p>joined by three or four other boys and the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_481">rest</a> of the way we went</p>
<p>together. Most of the streets and roads we traversed in our</p>
<p>morning's walk from Victoria are still intact, the storms of</p>
<p>rebuilding that have submerged so much of my boyhood's London have</p>
<p>passed and left them, and I have revived the impression of them</p>
<p>again and again in recent years as I have clattered dinnerward in a</p>
<p>hansom or hummed along in a motor cab to some engagement. The main</p>
<p>gate still looks out with the same expression of ancient well-</p>
<p>proportioned kindliness upon St. Margaret's Close. There are</p>
<p>imposing new science laboratories in Chambers Street indeed, but the</p>
<p>old playing fields are unaltered except for the big electric trams</p>
<p>that go droning and spitting blue flashes along the western</p>
<p>boundary. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_482">know</a> Ratten, the new Head, very well, but I have not</p>
<p>been inside the school to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_483">see</a> if it has changed at all since I went</p>
<p>up to Cambridge.</p>
<p>I took all they put before us very readily as a boy, for I had a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_484">mind</a> of vigorous appetite, but since I have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_485">grown</a> mentally to man's</p>
<p>estate and developed a more and more comprehensive view of our</p>
<p>national process and our national needs, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_486">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_487">am</a> more and more struck</p>
<p>by the oddity of the educational methods pursued, their aimless</p>
<p>disconnectedness from the constructive forces in the community. I</p>
<p>suppose if we are to view the public school as anything more than an</p>
<p>institution that has just chanced to happen, we must treat it as</p>
<p>having a definite function towards the general scheme of the nation,</p>
<p>as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_488">being</a> in a sense designed to take the crude young male of the</p>
<p>more or less <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_489">responsible</a> class, to correct his harsh egotisms,</p>
<p>broaden his outlook, give him a grasp of the contemporary</p>
<p>developments he will presently be called upon to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_490">influence</a> and</p>
<p>control, and send him on to the university to be made a leading and</p>
<p>ruling social man. It is easy enough to carp at schoolmasters and</p>
<p>set up for an Educational Reformer, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_491">know</a>, but still it is</p>
<p>impossible not to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_492">feel</a> how infinitely more effectually-given</p>
<p>certain impossibilities perhaps-the job might be done.</p>
<p>My <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_493">memory</a> of school has indeed no hint whatever of that quality of</p>
<p>elucidation it seems reasonable to demand from it. Here all about</p>
<p>me was London, a vast inexplicable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_494">being</a>, a vortex of gigantic</p>
<p>forces, that filled and overwhelmed me with impressions, that</p>
<p>stirred my imagination to a perpetual vague enquiry; and my school</p>
<p>not only offered no key to it, but had practically no comment to</p>
<p>make upon it at all. We were within three miles of Westminster and</p>
<p>Charing Cross, the government offices of a fifth of mankind were all</p>
<p>within an hour's stroll, great economic changes were going on under</p>
<p>our eyes, now the hoardings flamed with election placards, now the</p>
<p>Salvation Army and now the unemployed came trailing in procession</p>
<p>through the winter-grey streets, now the newspaper placards outside</p>
<p>news-shops told of battles in strange places, now of amazing</p>
<p>discoveries, now of sinister crimes, abject squalor and poverty,</p>
<p>imperial splendour and luxury, Buckingham Palace, Rotten Row,</p>
<p>Mayfair, the slums of Pimlico, garbage-littered streets of bawling</p>
<p>costermongers, the inky silver of the barge-laden Thames-such was</p>
<p>the background of our days. We went across St. Margaret's Close and</p>
<p>through the school gate into a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_495">quiet</a> puerile world apart from all</p>
<p>these things. We joined in the earnest acquirement of all that was</p>
<p>necessary for Greek epigrams and Latin verse, and for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_496">rest</a></p>
<p>played games. We dipped down into something clear and elegantly</p>
<p>proportioned and time-worn and for all its high resolve of stalwart</p>
<p>virility a little feeble, like our blackened and decayed portals by</p>
<p>Inigo Jones.</p>
<p>Within, we were taught as the chief subjects of instruction, Latin</p>
<p>and Greek. We were taught very badly because the men who taught us</p>
<p>did not habitually use either of these languages, nobody uses them</p>
<p>any more now except perhaps for the Latin of a few Levantine</p>
<p>monasteries. At the utmost our men read them. We were taught these</p>
<p>languages because long ago Latin had been the language of</p>
<p>civilisation; the one way of escape from the narrow and localised</p>
<p>life had lain in those days through Latin, and afterwards Greek had</p>
<p>come in as the vehicle of a flood of new and amazing ideas. Once</p>
<p>these two languages had been the sole means of initiation to the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_497">detached</a> criticism and partial comprehension of the world. I can</p>
<p>imagine the fierce zeal of our first Heads, Gardener and Roper,</p>
<p>teaching Greek like passionate missionaries, as a progressive</p>
<p>Chinaman might teach English to the boys of Pekin, clumsily,</p>
<p>impatiently, with rod and harsh urgency, but sincerely,</p>
<p>patriotically, because they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_498">felt</a> that behind it lay revelations, the</p>
<p>irresistible stimulus to a new phase of history. That was long ago.</p>
<p>A new great world, a vaster Imperialism had arisen about the school,</p>
<p>had assimilated all these amazing and incredible ideas, had gone on</p>
<p>to new and yet more amazing developments of its own. But the City</p>
<p>Merchants School still made the substance of its teaching Latin and</p>
<p>Greek, still, with no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_499">thought</a> of rotating crops, sowed in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_500">dream</a></p>
<p>amidst the harvesting.</p>
<p>There is no fierceness left in the teaching now. Just after I went</p>
<p>up to Trinity, Gates, our Head, wrote a review article in defence of</p>
<p>our curriculum. In this, among other indiscretions, he asserted</p>
<p>that it was impossible to write <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_501">good</a> English without an illuminating</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_502">knowledge</a> of the classic tongues, and he split an infinitive and</p>
<p>failed to button up a sentence in saying so. His main argument</p>
<p>conceded every objection a reasonable person could make to the City</p>
<p>Merchants' curriculum. He admitted that translation had now placed</p>
<p>all the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_503">wisdom</a> of the past at a common man's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_504">disposal</a>, that scarcely</p>
<p>a field of endeavour remained in which modern work had not long</p>
<p>since passed beyond the ancient achievement. He disclaimed any</p>
<p>utility. But there was, he said, a peculiar magic in these</p>
<p>grammatical exercises no other subjects of instruction possessed.</p>
<p>Nothing else provided the same strengthening and orderly discipline</p>
<p>for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_505">mind</a>.</p>
<p>He said that, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_506">knowing</a> the Senior Classics he did, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_507">himself</a> a Senior</p>
<p>Classic!</p>
<p>Yet in a dim <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_508">confused</a> way I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_509">think</a> be was making out a case. In</p>
<p>schools as we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_510">knew</a> them, and with the sort of assistant available,</p>
<p>the sort of assistant who has been trained entirely on the old</p>
<p>lines, he could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_511">see</a> no other teaching so <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_512">effectual</a> in developing</p>
<p>attention, restraint, sustained constructive effort and various yet</p>
<p>systematic adjustment. And that was as far as his imagination could</p>
<p>go.</p>
<p>It is infinitely easier to begin organised human affairs than end</p>
<p>them; the curriculum and the social organisation of the English</p>
<p>public school are the crowning instances of that. They go on</p>
<p>because they have begun. Schools are not only immortal institutions</p>
<p>but reproductive ones. Our founder, Jabez Arvon, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_513">knew</a> nothing, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_514">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_515">am</a></p>
<p>sure, of Gates' pedagogic values and would, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_516">feel</a> certain, have</p>
<p>dealt with them disrespectfully. But public schools and university</p>
<p>colleges sprang into <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_517">existence</a> correlated, the scholars went on to</p>
<p>the universities and came back to teach the schools, to teach as</p>
<p>they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_518">themselves</a> had been taught, before they had ever made any <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_519">real</a></p>
<p>use of the teaching; the crowd of boys herded together, a crowd</p>
<p>perpetually renewed and unbrokenly the same, adjusted itself by</p>
<p>means of spontaneously developed institutions. In a century, by its</p>
<p>very success, this revolutionary innovation of Renascence public</p>
<p>schools had become an immense tradition woven closely into the</p>
<p>fabric of the national life. Intelligent and powerful people <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_520">ceased</a></p>
<p>to talk Latin or read Greek, they had got what was wanted, but that</p>
<p>only left the schoolmaster the freer to elaborate his point. Since</p>
<p>most men of any importance or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_521">influence</a> in the country had been</p>
<p>through the mill, it was naturally a little difficult to persuade</p>
<p>them that it was not quite the best and most <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_522">ennobling</a> mill the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_523">wit</a></p>
<p>of man could devise. And, moreover, they did not want their</p>
<p>children made strange to them. There was all the machinery and all</p>
<p>the men needed to teach the old subjects, and none to teach whatever</p>
<p>new the critic might propose. Such science instruction as my father</p>
<p>gave seemed indeed the uninviting alternative to the classical</p>
<p>grind. It was certainly an altogether inferior instrument at that</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>So it was I occupied my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_524">mind</a> with the exact study of dead languages</p>
<p>for seven long years. It was the strangest of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_525">detachments</a>. We</p>
<p>would sit under the desk of such a master as Topham like creatures</p>
<p>who had fallen into an enchanted pit, and he would do his</p>
<p>considerable best to work us up to enthusiasm for, let us say, a</p>
<p>Greek play. If we flagged he would lash <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_526">himself</a> to revive us. He</p>
<p>would walk about the class-room mouthing great lines in a rich roar,</p>
<p>and asking us with a flushed face and shining eyes if it was not</p>
<p>"GLORIOUS." The very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_527">sight</a> of Greek letters brings back to me the</p>
<p>dingy, faded, ink-splashed quality of our class-room, the banging of</p>
<p>books, Topham's disordered hair, the sheen of his alpaca gown, his</p>
<p>deep unmusical intonations and the wide striding of his creaking</p>
<p>boots. Glorious! And <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_528">being</a> plastic human beings we would consent</p>
<p>that it was glorious, and some of us even achieved an answering</p>
<p>reverberation and a sympathetic flush. I at times <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_529">responded</a> freely.</p>
<p>We all <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_530">accepted</a> from him unquestioningly that these melodies, these</p>
<p>strange sounds, exceeded any possibility of beauty that lay in the</p>
<p>Gothic intricacy, the splash and glitter, the jar and recovery, the</p>
<p>stabbing lights, the heights and broad distances of our English</p>
<p>tongue. That indeed was the chief sin of him. It was not that he</p>
<p>was for Greek and Latin, but that he was fiercely against every</p>
<p>beauty that was neither classic nor deferred to classical canons.</p>
<p>And what exactly did we make of it, we seniors who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_531">understood</a> it</p>
<p>best? We visualised dimly through that dust and the grammatical</p>
<p>difficulties, the spectacle of the chorus chanting grotesquely,</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_532">helping</a> out protagonist and antagonist, masked and buskined, with</p>
<p>the telling of incomprehensible parricides, of inexplicable incest,</p>
<p>of gods faded beyond symbolism, of that Relentless Law we did not</p>
<p>believe in for a moment, that no modern western European can believe</p>
<p>in. We <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_533">thought</a> of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_534">characters</a> in the unconvincing wigs and</p>
<p>costumes of our school performance. No Gilbert Murray had come as</p>
<p>yet to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_535">touch</a> these things to life again. It was like the ghost of</p>
<p>an antiquarian's toy theatre, a ghost that crumbled and condensed</p>
<p>into a gritty dust of construing as one looked at it.</p>
<p>Marks, shindies, prayers and punishments, all flavoured with the</p>
<p>leathery stuffiness of time-worn Big Hall…</p>
<p>And then out one would come through our grey old gate into the</p>
<p>evening light and the spectacle of London hurrying like a cataract,</p>
<p>London in black and brown and blue and gleaming silver, roaring like</p>
<p>the very loom of Time. We came out into the new world no teacher</p>
<p>has yet had the power and courage to grasp and expound. Life and</p>
<p>death sang all about one, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_536">joys</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_537">fears</a> on such a scale, in such an</p>
<p>intricacy as never Greek nor Roman <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_538">knew</a>. The interminable</p>
<p>procession of horse omnibuses went lumbering past, bearing countless</p>
<p>people we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_538">knew</a> not whence, we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_538">knew</a> not whither. Hansoms clattered,</p>
<p>foot passengers jostled one, a thousand appeals of shop and boarding</p>
<p>caught the eye. The multi-coloured lights of window and street</p>
<p>mingled with the warm glow of the declining day under the softly</p>
<p>flushing London skies; the ever-changing placards, the shouting</p>
<p>news-vendors, told of a kaleidoscopic drama all about the globe.</p>
<p>One did not realise what had happened to us, but the voice of Topham</p>
<p>was suddenly drowned and lost, he and his minute, remote</p>
<p>gesticulations…</p>
<p>That submerged and isolated curriculum did not even join on to</p>
<p>living interests where it might have done so. We were left</p>
<p>absolutely to the hints of the newspapers, to casual political</p>
<p>speeches, to the cartoons of the comic papers or a chance reading of</p>
<p>some Socialist pamphlet for any general ideas whatever about the</p>
<p>huge swirling world process in which we found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_539">ourselves</a>. I always</p>
<p>look back with particular exasperation to the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_540">cessation</a> of our</p>
<p>modern history at the year 1815. There it pulled up abruptly, as</p>
<p>though it had come upon something indelicate…</p>
<p>But, after all, what would Topham or Flack have made of the huge</p>
<p>adjustments of the nineteenth century? Flack was the chief</p>
<p>cricketer on the staff; he belonged to that great cult which</p>
<p>pretends that the place of this or that county in the struggle for</p>
<p>the championship is a matter of supreme importance to boys. He</p>
<p>obliged us to affect a passionate interest in the progress of county</p>
<p>matches, to work up unnatural enthusiasms. What a fuss there would</p>
<p>be when some well-trained boy, panting as if from Marathon, appeared</p>
<p>with an evening paper! "I say, you chaps, Middlesex all out for a</p>
<p>hundred and five!"</p>
<p>Under Flack's pressure I became, I confess, a cricket humbug of the</p>
<p>first class. I applied <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_541">myself</a> industriously year by year to</p>
<p>mastering scores and averages; I pretended that Lords or the Oval</p>
<p>were the places nearest Paradise for me. (I never went to either.)</p>
<p>Through a slight mistake about the county boundary I adopted Surrey</p>
<p>for my loyalty, though as a matter of fact we were by some five</p>
<p>hundred yards or so in Kent. It did quite as well for my purposes.</p>
<p>I bowled rather straight and fast, and spent endless hours acquiring</p>
<p>the skill to bowl Flack out. He was a bat in the Corinthian style,</p>
<p>rich and voluminous, and succumbed very easily to a low shooter or</p>
<p>an unexpected Yorker, hut usually he was caught early by long leg.</p>
<p>The difficulty was to bowl him before he got caught. He loved to</p>
<p>lift a ball to leg. After one had clean bowled him at the practice</p>
<p>nets one deliberately gave him a ball to leg just to make him <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_542">feel</a></p>
<p>nice again.</p>
<p>Flack went about a world of marvels <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_543">dreaming</a> of leg hits. He has</p>
<p>been observed, going across the Park on his way to his highly</p>
<p>respectable club in Piccadilly, to break from profound musings into</p>
<p>a strange brief dance that ended with an imaginary swipe with his</p>
<p>umbrella, a roofer, over the trees towards Buckingham Palace. The</p>
<p>hit accomplished, Flack resumed his way.</p>
<p>Inadequately instructed foreigners would pass him in terror,</p>
<p>needlessly alert.</p>

<p>These schoolmasters move through my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_544">memory</a> as always a little</p>
<p>distant and more than a little incomprehensible. Except when they</p>
<p>wore flannels, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_545">saw</a> them almost always in old college caps and</p>
<p>gowns, a uniform which greatly increased their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_546">detachment</a> from the</p>
<p>world of actual men. Gates, the head, was a lean loose-limbed man,</p>
<p>rather stupid I discovered when I reached the Sixth and came into</p>
<p>contact with him, but honest, simple and very eager to be liberal-</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_547">minded</a>. He was bald, with an almost conical baldness, with a</p>
<p>grizzled pointed beard, small featured and, under the stresses of a</p>
<p>Zeitgeist that demanded liberality, with an expression of puzzled</p>
<p>but resolute resistance to his own unalterable opinions. He made a</p>
<p>tall dignified figure in his gown. In my junior days he spoke to me</p>
<p>only three or four times, and then he annoyed me by giving me a</p>
<p>wrong surname; it was a sore point because I was an outsider and not</p>
<p>one of the old school families, the Shoesmiths, the Naylors, the</p>
<p>Marklows, the Tophams, the Pevises and suchlike, who came generation</p>
<p>after generation. I recall him most vividly against the background</p>
<p>of faded brown book-backs in the old library in which we less</p>
<p>destructive seniors were trusted to work, with the light from the</p>
<p>stained-glass window falling in coloured patches on his face. It</p>
<p>gave him the appearance of having no colour of his own. He had a</p>
<p>habit of scratching the beard on his cheek as he talked, and he used</p>
<p>to come and consult us about things and invariably do as we said.</p>
<p>That, in his phraseology, was "maintaining the traditions of the</p>
<p>school."</p>
<p>He had indeed an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_548">effect</a> not of a man directing a school, but of a</p>
<p>man captured and directed by a school. Dead and gone Elizabethans</p>
<p>had begotten a monster that could carry him about in its mouth.</p>
<p>Yet <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_549">being</a> a man, as I say, with his hair a little stirred by a</p>
<p>Zeitgeist that made for change, Gates did at times display a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_550">disposition</a> towards developments. City Merchants had no modern</p>
<p>side, and utilitarian <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_551">spirits</a> were carping in the PALL MALL GAZETTE</p>
<p>and elsewhere at the omissions from our curriculum, and particularly</p>
<p>at our want of German. Moreover, four classes still worked</p>
<p>together with much clashing and uproar in the old Big Hall that had</p>
<p>once held in a common tumult the entire school. Gates used to come</p>
<p>and talk to us older fellows about these things.</p>
<p>"I don't wish to innovate unduly," he used to say. But we ought to</p>
<p>get in some German, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_552">know</a>,-for those who like it. The army men</p>
<p>will be wanting it some of these days."</p>
<p>He referred to the organisation of regular evening preparation for</p>
<p>the lower boys in Big Hall as a "revolutionary change," but he</p>
<p>achieved it, and he declared he began the replacement of the hacked</p>
<p>wooden tables, at which the boys had worked since Tudor days, by</p>
<p>sloping desks with safety inkpots and scientifically adjustable</p>
<p>seats, "with grave misgivings." And though he never birched a boy</p>
<p>in his life, and was, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_553">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_554">am</a> convinced, morally incapable of such a</p>
<p>scuffle, he retained the block and birch in the school through all</p>
<p>his term of office, and spoke at the Headmasters' Conference in</p>
<p>temperate approval of corporal chastisement, comparing it, dear</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_555">soul</a>! to the power of the sword…</p>
<p>I wish I could, in some measure and without tediousness, convey the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_556">effect</a> of his discourses to General Assembly in Big Hall. But that</p>
<p>is like trying to draw the obverse and reverse of a sixpence worn to</p>
<p>complete illegibility. His tall fine figure stood high on the days,</p>
<p>his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_557">thoughtful</a> tenor filled the air as he steered his hazardous way</p>
<p>through sentences that dragged inconclusive tails and dropped</p>
<p>redundant prepositions. And he pleaded ever so urgently, ever so</p>
<p>finely, that what we all <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_558">knew</a> for Sin was sinful, and on the whole</p>
<p>best avoided altogether, and so went on with deepening notes and</p>
<p>even with short arresting gestures of the right arm and hand, to</p>
<p>stir and exhort us towards <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_559">goodness</a>, towards that modern,</p>
<p>unsectarian <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_559">goodness</a>, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_559">goodness</a> in general and nothing in particular,</p>
<p>which the Zeitgeist seemed to indicate in those transitional years.</p>

<p>The school never quite got hold of me. Partly I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_560">think</a> that was</p>
<p>because I was a day-boy and so freer than most of the boys, partly</p>
<p>because of a temperamental <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_561">disposition</a> to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_562">see</a> things in my own way</p>
<p>and have my private <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_563">dreams</a>, partly because I was a little</p>
<p>antagonised by the family traditions that ran through the school. I</p>
<p>was made to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_564">feel</a> at first that I was a rank outsider, and I never</p>
<p>quite forgot it. I suffered very little bullying, and I never had a</p>
<p>fight-in all my time there were only three fights-but I followed</p>
<p>my own curiosities. I was already a very keen theologian and</p>
<p>politician before I was fifteen. I was also intensely interested in</p>
<p>modern warfare. I read the morning papers in the Reading Room</p>
<p>during the midday recess, never missed the illustrated weeklies, and</p>
<p>often when I could afford it I bought a PALL MALL GAZETTE on my way</p>
<p>home.</p>
<p>I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_565">think</a> that I was very exceptional in that; most intelligent</p>
<p>boys, I believe, want naturally to be men, and are keenly interested</p>
<p>in men's affairs. There is not the universal passion for a</p>
<p>magnified puerility among them it is customary to assume. I was</p>
<p>indeed a voracious reader of everything but boys' books-which I</p>
<p>detested-and fiction. I read histories, travel, popular science</p>
<p>and controversy with particular zest, and I loved maps. School work</p>
<p>and school games were quite subordinate affairs for me. I worked</p>
<p>well and made a passable figure at games, and I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_565">think</a> I was</p>
<p>abnormally insensitive to the fine quality of our school, to the</p>
<p>charm of its mediaeval nucleus, its Gothic cloisters, its scraps of</p>
<p>Palladian and its dignified Georgian extensions; the contrast of the</p>
<p>old <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_566">quiet</a>, that in spite of our presence pervaded it everywhere,</p>
<p>with the rushing and impending London all about it, was indeed a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_567">continual</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_568">pleasure</a> to me. But these things were certainly not the</p>
<p>living and central interests of my life.</p>
<p>I had to conceal my wider outlook to a certain extent-from the</p>
<p>masters even more than from the boys. Indeed I only let <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_569">myself</a> go</p>
<p>freely with one boy, Britten, my especial chum, the son of the</p>
<p>Agent-General for East Australia. We two discovered in a chance</p>
<p>conversation A PROPOS of a map in the library that we were both of</p>
<p>us curious why there were Malays in Madagascar, and how the Mecca</p>
<p>pilgrims came from the East Indies before steamships were available.</p>
<p>Neither of us had suspected that there was any one at all in the</p>
<p>school who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_570">knew</a> or cared a rap about the Indian Ocean, except as</p>
<p>water on the way to India. But Britten had come up through the Suez</p>
<p>Canal, and his ship had spoken a pilgrim ship on the way. It gave</p>
<p>him a startling quality of living <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_571">knowledge</a>. From these pilgrims we</p>
<p>got to a comparative treatment of religions, and from that, by a</p>
<p>sudden plunge, to entirely sceptical and disrespectful confessions</p>
<p>concerning Gates' last outbreak of simple piety in School Assembly.</p>
<p>We became congenial intimates from that hour.</p>
<p>The discovery of Britten happened to me when we were both in the</p>
<p>Lower Fifth. Previously there had been a watertight compartment</p>
<p>between the books I read and the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_572">thoughts</a> they begot on the one hand</p>
<p>and human intercourse on the other. Now I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_573">really</a> began my higher</p>
<p>education, and aired and examined and developed in conversation the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_574">doubts</a>, the ideas, the interpretations that had been <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_575">forming</a> in my</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_576">mind</a>. As we were both day-boys with a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_577">good</a> deal of control over our</p>
<p>time we organised walks and expeditions together, and my habit of</p>
<p>solitary and rather vague prowling gave way to much more definite</p>
<p>joint enterprises. I went several times to his house, he was the</p>
<p>youngest of several brothers, one of whom was a medical student and</p>
<p>let us assist at the dissection of a cat, and once or twice in</p>
<p>vacation time he came to Penge, and we went with parcels of</p>
<p>provisions to do a thorough day in the grounds and galleries of the</p>
<p>Crystal Palace, ending with the fireworks at close quarters. We</p>
<p>went in a river steamboat down to Greenwich, and fired by that made</p>
<p>an excursion to Margate and back; we explored London docks and</p>
<p>Bethnal Green Museum, Petticoat Lane and all sorts of out-of-the-way</p>
<p>places together.</p>
<p>We confessed shyly to one another a common secret vice, "Phantom</p>
<p>warfare." When we walked <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_578">alone</a>, especially in the country, we had</p>
<p>both developed the same practice of fighting an imaginary battle</p>
<p>about us as we walked. As we went along we were generals, and our</p>
<p>attacks pushed along on either side, crouching and gathering behind</p>
<p>hedges, cresting ridges, occupying copses, rushing open spaces,</p>
<p>fighting from house to house. The hillsides about Penge were</p>
<p>honeycombed in my imagination with the pits and trenches I had</p>
<p>created to cheek a victorious invader coming out of Surrey. For him</p>
<p>West Kensington was chiefly important as the scene of a desperate</p>
<p>and successful last stand of insurrectionary troops (who had seized</p>
<p>the Navy, the Bank and other advantages) against a royalist army-</p>
<p>reinforced by Germans-advancing for reasons best <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_579">known</a> to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_580">themselves</a> by way of Harrow and Ealing. It is a secret and solitary</p>
<p>game, as we found when we tried to play it together. We made a</p>
<p>success of that only once. All the way down to Margate we schemed</p>
<p>defences and assailed and fought them as we came back against the</p>
<p>sunset. Afterwards we recapitulated all that conflict by means of a</p>
<p>large scale map of the Thames and little paper ironclads in plan cut</p>
<p>out of paper.</p>
<p>A subsequent revival of these imaginings was brought about by</p>
<p>Britten's luck in getting, through a friend of his father's,</p>
<p>admission for us both to the spectacle of volunteer officers</p>
<p>fighting the war game in Caxton Hall. We developed a war game of</p>
<p>our own at Britten's home with nearly a couple of hundred lead</p>
<p>soldiers, some excellent spring cannons that shot hard and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_581">true</a> at</p>
<p>six yards, hills of books and a constantly elaborated set of rules.</p>
<p>For some months that occupied an immense proportion of our leisure.</p>
<p>Some of our battles lasted several days. We kept the game a</p>
<p>profound secret from the other fellows. They would not have</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_582">understood</a>.</p>
<p>And we also began, it was certainly before we were sixteen, to</p>
<p>write, for the sake of writing. We liked writing. We had</p>
<p>discovered Lamb and the best of the middle articles in such weeklies</p>
<p>as the SATURDAY GAZETTE, and we imitated them. Our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_583">minds</a> were full</p>
<p>of dim uncertain things we wanted to drag out into the light of</p>
<p>expression. Britten had got hold of IN MEMORIAM, and I had</p>
<p>disinterred Pope's ESSAY ON MAN and RABBI BEN EZRA, and these things</p>
<p>had set our theological and cosmic solicitudes talking. I was</p>
<p>somewhere between sixteen and eighteen, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_584">know</a>, when he and I walked</p>
<p>along the Thames Embankment confessing shamefully to one another</p>
<p>that we had never read Lucretius. We <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_585">thought</a> every one who mattered</p>
<p>had read Lucretius.</p>
<p>When I was nearly sixteen my mother was taken ill very suddenly, and</p>
<p>died of some perplexing complaint that involved a post-mortem</p>
<p>examination; it was, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_586">think</a>, the trouble that has since those days</p>
<p>been recognised as appendicitis. This led to a considerable change</p>
<p>in my circumstances; the house at Penge was given up, and my</p>
<p>Staffordshire uncle arranged for me to lodge during school terms</p>
<p>with a needy solicitor and his wife in Vicars Street, S. W., about a</p>
<p>mile and a half from the school. So it was I came right into</p>
<p>London; I had almost two years of London before I went to Cambridge.</p>
<p>Tehose were our great days together. Afterwards we were torn apart;</p>
<p>Britten went to Oxford, and our circumstances never afterwards threw</p>
<p>us <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_587">continuously</a> together until the days of the BLUE WEEKLY.</p>
<p>As boys, we walked together, read and discussed the same books,</p>
<p>pursued the same enquiries. We got a reputation as inseparables and</p>
<p>the nickname of the Rose and the Lily, for Britten was short and</p>
<p>thick-set with dark close curling hair and a ruddy Irish type of</p>
<p>face; I was lean and fair-haired and some inches taller than he.</p>
<p>Our talk ranged widely and yet had certain very definite</p>
<p>limitations. We were amazingly free with politics and religion, we</p>
<p>went to that little meeting-house of William Morris's at Hammersmith</p>
<p>and worked out the principles of Socialism pretty thoroughly, and we</p>
<p>got up the Darwinian theory with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_588">help</a> of Britten's medical-</p>
<p>student brother and the galleries of the Natural History Museum in</p>
<p>Cromwell Road. Those wonderful cases on the ground floor</p>
<p>illustrating mimicry, dimorphism and so forth, were new in our</p>
<p>times, and we went through them with earnest industry and tried over</p>
<p>our Darwinism in the light of that. Such topics we did</p>
<p>exhaustively. But on the other hand I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_589">remember</a> any</p>
<p>discussion whatever of human sex or sexual relationships. There, in</p>
<p>spite of intense secret curiosities, our lips were sealed by a</p>
<p>peculiar shyness. And I do not believe we ever had occasion either</p>
<p>of us to use the word "love." It was not only that we were</p>
<p>instinctively shy of the subject, but that we were mightily ashamed</p>
<p>of the extent of our ignorance and uncertainty in these matters. We</p>
<p>evaded them elaborately with an assumption of exhaustive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_590">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>We certainly had no shyness about theology. We marked the</p>
<p>emancipation of our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_591">spirits</a> from the frightful teachings that had</p>
<p>oppressed our boyhood, by much indulgence in blasphemous <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_592">wit</a>. We</p>
<p>had a secret literature of irreverent rhymes, and a secret art of</p>
<p>theological caricature. Britten's father had delighted his family</p>
<p>by reading aloud from Dr. Richard Garnett's TWILIGHT OF THE GODS,</p>
<p>and Britten conveyed the precious volume to me. That and the BAB</p>
<p>BALLADS were the inspiration of some of our earliest lucubrations.</p>
<p>For an imaginative boy the first <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_593">experience</a> of writing is like a</p>
<p>tiger's first <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_594">taste</a> of blood, and our literary flowerings led very</p>
<p>directly to the revival of the school magazine, which had been</p>
<p>comatose for some years. But there we came upon a disappointment.</p>

<p>In that revival we associated certain other of the Sixth <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_595">Form</a> boys,</p>
<p>and notably one for whom our enterprise was to lay the foundations</p>
<p>of a career that has ended in the House of Lords, Arthur Cossington,</p>
<p>now Lord Paddockhurst. Cossington was at that time a rather heavy,</p>
<p>rather good-looking boy who was chiefly eminent in cricket, an</p>
<p>outsider even as we were and preoccupied no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_596">doubt</a>, had we been</p>
<p>sufficiently <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_597">detached</a> to observe him, with private imaginings very</p>
<p>much of the same quality and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_598">spirit</a> as our own. He was, we were</p>
<p>inclined to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_599">think</a>, rather a sentimentalist, rather a poseur, he</p>
<p>affected a concise emphatic styl, played chess very well, betrayed</p>
<p>a belief in will-power, and earned Britten's secret hostility,</p>
<p>Britten <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_600">being</a> a sloven, by the invariable neatness of his collars</p>
<p>and ties. He came into our magazine with a vigour that we found</p>
<p>extremely surprising and unwelcome.</p>
<p>Britten and I had wanted to write. We had indeed figured our</p>
<p>project modestly as a manuscript magazine of satirical, liberal and</p>
<p>brilliant literature by which in some rather inexplicable way the</p>
<p>vague tumult of ideas that teemed within us was to find <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_601">form</a> and</p>
<p>expression; Cossington, it was manifest from the outset, wanted</p>
<p>neither to write nor writing, but a magazine. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_602">remember</a> the</p>
<p>inaugural meeting in Shoesmith major's study-we had had great</p>
<p>trouble in getting it together-and how <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_603">effectually</a> Cossington</p>
<p>bolted with the proposal.</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_604">think</a> we fellows ought to run a magazine," said Cossington. "The</p>
<p>school used to have one. A school like this ought to have a</p>
<p>magazine."</p>
<p>"The last one died in '84," said Shoesmith from the hearthrug.</p>
<p>"Called the OBSERVER. Rot rather."</p>
<p>"Bad title," said Cossington.</p>
<p>"There was a TATLER before that," said Britten, sitting on the</p>
<p>writing table at the window that was closed to deaden the cries of</p>
<p>the Lower School at play, and clashing his boots together.</p>
<p>"We want something suggestive of City Merchants."</p>
<p>"CITY MERCHANDIZE," said Britten.</p>
<p>"Too fanciful. What of ARVONIAN? Richard Arvon was our founder,</p>
<p>and it seems almost a duty-"</p>
<p>"They call them all -usians or -onians," said Britten.</p>
<p>"I like CITY MERCHANDIZE," I said. "We could probably find a</p>
<p>quotation to suggest-oh! mixed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_605">good</a> things."</p>
<p>Cossington regarded me abstractedly.</p>
<p>Don't want to put the accent on the City, do we?" said Shoesmith,</p>
<p>who had a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_606">feeling</a> for county families, and Naylor supported him by a</p>
<p>murmur of approval.</p>
<p>"We ought to call it the ARVONIAN," decided Cossington, "and we</p>
<p>might very well have underneath, 'With which is incorporated the</p>
<p>OBSERVER.' That picks up the old traditions, makes an appeal to old</p>
<p>boys and all that, and it gives us something to print under the</p>
<p>title."</p>
<p>I still held out for CITY MERCHANDIZE, which had taken my fancy.</p>
<p>"Some of the chaps' people won't like it," said Naylor, "certain not</p>
<p>to. And it sounds Rum."</p>
<p>"Sounds Weird," said a boy who had not hitherto spoken.</p>
<p>"We aren't going to do anything Queer," said Shoesmith, pointedly</p>
<p>not looking at Britten.</p>
<p>The question of the title had manifestly gone against us. "Oh! HAVE</p>
<p>it ARVONIAN," I said.</p>
<p>"And next, what size shall we have?" said Cossington.</p>
<p>"Something like MACMILLAN'S MAGAZINE-or LONGMANS'; LONGMANS' is</p>
<p>better because it has a whole page, not columns. It makes no end of</p>
<p>difference to one's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_607">effects</a>."</p>
<p>"What <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_608">effects</a>?" asked Shoesmith abruptly.</p>
<p>"Oh! a pause or a white line or anything. You've got to write</p>
<p>closer for a double column. It's nuggetty. You can't get a swing</p>
<p>on your prose." I had discussed this thoroughly with Britten.</p>
<p>"If the fellows are going to write-" began Britten.</p>
<p>"We ought to keep off fine writing," said Shoesmith. "It's cheek.</p>
<p>I vote we don't have any."</p>
<p>"We sha'n't get any," said Cossington, and then as an olive branch</p>
<p>to me, "unless Remington does a bit. Or Britten. But it's no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_609">good</a></p>
<p>making too much space for it."</p>
<p>"We ought to be very careful about the writing," said Shoesmith.</p>
<p>"We don't want to give <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_610">ourselves</a> away."</p>
<p>"I vote we ask old Topham to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_611">see</a> us through," said Naylor.</p>
<p>Britten groaned aloud and every one regarded him. "Greek epigrams</p>
<p>on the fellows' names," he said. " Small beer in ancient bottles.</p>
<p>Let's get a stuffed broody hen to SIT on the magazine."</p>
<p>"We might do worse than a Greek epigram," said Cossington. "One in</p>
<p>each number. It-it impresses parents and keeps up our classieal</p>
<p>tradition. And the masters CAN <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_612">help</a>. We don't want to antagonise</p>
<p>them. Of course-we've got to dcpartmentalise. Writing is only one</p>
<p>section of the thing. The ARVONIAN has to stand for the school.</p>
<p>There's questions of space and questions of expense. We can't turn</p>
<p>out a great chunk of printed prose like-like wet cold toast and</p>
<p>call it a magazine."</p>
<p>Britten writhed, appreciating the image.</p>
<p>"There's to be a section of sports. YOU must do that."</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_613">I'm</a> not going to do any fine writing," said Shoesmith.</p>
<p>"What you've got to do is just to list all the chaps and put a note</p>
<p>to their play:-'Naylor minor must pass more. Football isn't the</p>
<p>place for extreme individualism.' 'Ammersham shapes well as half-</p>
<p>back.' Things like that."</p>
<p>"I could do that all right," said Shoesmith, brightening and</p>
<p>manifestly hecoming pregnant with judgments.</p>
<p>"One great thing about a magazine of this sort," said Cossington,</p>
<p>"is to mention just as many names as you can in each number. It</p>
<p>keeps the interest alive. Chaps will turn it over looking for their</p>
<p>own little bit. Then it all lights up for them."</p>
<p>"Do you want any reports of matches?" Shoesmith broke from his</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_614">meditation</a>.</p>
<p>"Rather. With comments."</p>
<p>"Naylor surpassed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_615">himself</a> and negotiated the lemon safely home,"</p>
<p>said Shoesmith.</p>
<p>"Shut it," said Naylor modestly.</p>
<p>"Exactly," said Cossington. "That gives us three features,"</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_616">touching</a> them off on his fingers, "Epigram, Literary Section,</p>
<p>Sports. Then we want a section to shove anything into, a joke, a</p>
<p>notice of anything that's going on. So on. Our Note Book."</p>
<p>"Oh, Hell!" said Britten, and clashed his boots, to the silent</p>
<p>disapproval of every one.</p>
<p>"Then we want an editorial."</p>
<p>"A WHAT?" cried Britten, with a note of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_617">real</a> terror in his voice.</p>
<p>"Well, don't we? Unless we have our Note Book to begin on the front</p>
<p>page. It gives a scrappy <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_618">effect</a> to do that. We want something</p>
<p>manly and straightforward and a bit <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_619">thoughtful</a>, about Patriotism,</p>
<p>say, or ESPRIT DE CORPS, or After-Life."</p>
<p>I looked at Britten. Hitherto we had not considered Cossington</p>
<p>mattered very much in the world.</p>
<p>He went over us as a motor-car goes over a dog. There was a sort of</p>
<p>energy about him, a new sort of energy to us; we had never realised</p>
<p>that anything of the sort <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_620">existed</a> in the world. We were hopelessly</p>
<p>at a disadvantage. Almost instantly we had developed a clear and</p>
<p>detailed vision of a magazine made up of everything that was most</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_621">acceptable</a> in the magazines that flourished in the adult world about</p>
<p>us, and had determined to make it a success. He had by a kind of</p>
<p>instinct, as it were, synthetically plagiarised every successful</p>
<p>magazine and breathed into this dusty mixture the breath of life.</p>
<p>He was elected at his own suggestion managing director, with the</p>
<p>earnest support of Shoesmith and Naylor, and conducted the magazine</p>
<p>so successfully and brilliantly that he even got a whole back page</p>
<p>of advertisements from the big sports shop in Holborn, and made the</p>
<p>printers pay at the same rate for a notice of certain books of their</p>
<p>own which they said they had inserted by inadvertency to fill up</p>
<p>space. The only literary contribution in the first number was a</p>
<p>column by Topham in faultless stereotyped English in depreciation of</p>
<p>some fancied evil called Utilitarian Studies and ending with that</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_622">noble</a> old quotation:-</p>
<p>"To the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome."</p>
<p>And Flack crowded us out of number two with a bright little paper on</p>
<p>the "Humours of Cricket," and the Head <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_623">himself</a> was profusely</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_624">thoughtful</a> all over the editorial under the heading of "The School</p>
<p>Chapel; and How it Seems to an Old Boy."</p>
<p>Britten and I found it difficult to express to each other with any</p>
<p>grace or precision what we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_625">felt</a> about that magazine.</p>

<p>CHAPTER THE FOURTH</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ADOLESCENCE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>1</p>
</title>
<p>I find it very difficult to trace how <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_626">form</a> was added to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_626">form</a> and</p>
<p>interpretation followed interpretation in my ever-spreading, ever-</p>
<p>deepening, ever-multiplying and enriching vision of this world into</p>
<p>which I had been born. Every day added its impressions, its hints,</p>
<p>its subtle explications to the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_627">growing</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_628">understanding</a>. Day after day</p>
<p>the living interlacing threads of a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_629">mind</a> weave together. Every</p>
<p>morning now for three weeks and more (for to-day is Thursday and I</p>
<p>started on a Tuesday) I have been trying to convey some idea of the</p>
<p>factors and early <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_630">influences</a> by which my particular scrap of</p>
<p>subjective tapestry was shaped, to show the child playing on the</p>
<p>nursery floor, the son perplexed by his mother, gazing aghast at his</p>
<p>dead father, exploring interminable suburbs, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_631">touched</a> by first</p>
<p>intimations of the sexual mystery, coming in with a sort of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_632">confused</a></p>
<p>avidity towards the centres of the life of London. It is only by</p>
<p>such an effort to write it down that one realises how marvellously</p>
<p>crowded, how marvellously analytical and synthetic those ears must</p>
<p>be. One begins with the little child to whom the sky is a roof of</p>
<p>blue, the world a screen of opaque and disconnected facts, the home</p>
<p>a thing eternal, and "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_633">being</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_634">good</a>" just simple obedience to</p>
<p>unquestioned authority; and one comes at last to the vast world of</p>
<p>one's adult <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_635">perception</a>, pierced deep by flaring searchlights of</p>
<p>partial <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_628">understanding</a>, here masked by mists, here refracted and</p>
<p>distorted through half translucent veils, here showing broad</p>
<p>prospects and limitless vistas and here impenetrably dark.</p>
<p>I recall phases of deep speculation, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_636">doubts</a> and even prayers by</p>
<p>night, and strange occasions when by a sort of hypnotic</p>
<p>contemplation of nothingness I sought to pierce the web of</p>
<p>appearances about me. It is hard to measure these things in</p>
<p>receding perspective, and now I cannot trace, so closely has mood</p>
<p>succeeded and overlaid and obliterated mood, the phases by which an</p>
<p>utter horror of death was replaced by the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_637">growing</a> realisation of its</p>
<p>necessity and dignity. Difficulty of the imagination with infinite</p>
<p>space, infinite time, entangled my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_638">mind</a>; and moral distress for the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_639">pain</a> and suffering of bygone ages that made all <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_640">thought</a> of</p>
<p>reformation in the future seem but the grimmest irony upon now</p>
<p>irreparable wrongs. Many an intricate perplexity of these</p>
<p>broadening years did not so much get settled as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_641">cease</a> to matter.</p>
<p>Life crowded me away from it.</p>
<p>I have confessed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_642">myself</a> a temerarious theologian, and in that</p>
<p>passage from boyhood to manhood I ranged widely in my search for</p>
<p>some permanently <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_643">satisfying</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_644">Truth</a>. That, too, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_645">ceased</a> after a time</p>
<p>to be urgently interesting. I came at last into a phase that</p>
<p>endures to this day, of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_646">absolute</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_647">tranquillity</a>, of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_646">absolute</a></p>
<p>confidence in whatever that Incomprehensible Comprehensive which</p>
<p>must needs be the substratum of all things, may be. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_648">Feeling</a> OF IT,</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_648">feeling</a> BY IT, I cannot <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_649">feel</a> afraid of it. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_650">think</a> I had got quite</p>
<p>clearly and finally to that adjustment long before my Cambridge days</p>
<p>were done. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_651">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_652">am</a> sure that the evil in life is transitory and finite</p>
<p>like an accident or distress in the nursery; that God is my Father</p>
<p>and that I may trust Him, even though life hurts so that one must</p>
<p>needs cry out at it, even though it shows no consequence but</p>
<p>failure, no promise but <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_653">pain</a>…</p>
<p>But while I was fearless of theology I must confess it was</p>
<p>comparatively late before I faced and dared to probe the secrecies</p>
<p>of sex. I was afraid of sex. I had an instinctive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_654">perception</a> that</p>
<p>it would be a large and difficult thing in my life, but my early</p>
<p>training was all in the direction of regarding it as an irrelevant</p>
<p>thing, as something disconnected from all the broad significances of</p>
<p>life, as hostile and disgraceful in its quality. The world was</p>
<p>never so emasculated in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_655">thought</a>, I suppose, as it was in the</p>
<p>Victorian time…</p>
<p>I was afraid to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_656">think</a> either of sex or (what I have always found</p>
<p>inseparable from a kind of sexual <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_657">emotion</a>) beauty. Even as a boy I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_658">knew</a> the thing as a haunting and alluring mystery that I tried to</p>
<p>keep away from. Its dim presence obsessed me none the less for</p>
<p>all the extravagant decency, the stimulating silences of my</p>
<p>upbringing…</p>
<p>The plaster Venuses and Apollos that used to adorn the vast aisle</p>
<p>and huge grey terraces of the Crystal Palace were the first</p>
<p>intimations of the beauty of the body that ever came into my life.</p>
<p>As I write of it I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_659">feel</a> again the shameful attraction of those</p>
<p>gracious <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_660">forms</a>. I used to look at them not simply, but curiously</p>
<p>and askance. Once at least in my later days at Penge, I spent a</p>
<p>shilling in admission chiefly for the sake of them…</p>
<p>The strangest thing of all my odd and solitary upbringing seems to</p>
<p>me now that swathing up of all the splendours of the flesh, that</p>
<p>strange combination of fanatical terrorism and shyness that fenced</p>
<p>me about with prohibitions. It caused me to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_661">grow</a> up, I will not say</p>
<p>blankly ignorant, but with an ignorance blurred and dishonoured by</p>
<p>shame, by enigmatical warnings, by cultivated aversions, an</p>
<p>ignorance in which a fascinated curiosity and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_662">desire</a> struggled like</p>
<p>a thing in a net. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_663">knew</a> so little and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_664">felt</a> so much. There was</p>
<p>indeed no Aphrodite at all in my youthful Pantheon, but instead</p>
<p>there was a mysterious and minatory gap. I have told how at last a</p>
<p>new Venus was born in my imagination out of gas lamps and the</p>
<p>twilight, a Venus with a cockney accent and dark eyes shining out of</p>
<p>the dusk, a Venus who was a warm, passion-stirring atmosphere rather</p>
<p>than incarnate in a body. And I have told, too, how I bought a</p>
<p>picture.</p>
<p>All this was a thing apart from the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_665">rest</a> of my life, a locked</p>
<p>avoided chamber…</p>
<p>It was not until my last year at Trinity that I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_666">really</a> broke down</p>
<p>the barriers of this unwholesome silence and brought my secret</p>
<p>broodings to the light of day. Then a little set of us plunged</p>
<p>suddenly into what we called at first sociological discussion. I</p>
<p>can still recall even the physical <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_667">feeling</a> of those first tentative</p>
<p>talks. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_668">remember</a> them mostly as occurring in the rooms of Ted</p>
<p>Hatherleigh, who kept at the corner by the Trinity great gate, but</p>
<p>we also used to talk a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_669">good</a> deal at a man's in King's, a man named,</p>
<p>if I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_668">remember</a> rightly, Redmayne. The atmosphere of Hatherleigh's</p>
<p>rooms was a haze of tobacco smoke against a background brown and</p>
<p>deep. He professed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_670">himself</a> a socialist with anarchistic leanings-</p>
<p>he had suffered the martyrdom of ducking for it-and a huge French</p>
<p>May-day poster displaying a splendid proletarian in red and black on</p>
<p>a barricade against a flaring orange sky, dominated his decorations.</p>
<p>Hatherleigh affected a fine untidiness, and all the place, even the</p>
<p>floor, was littered with books, for the most part open and face</p>
<p>downward; deeper darknesses were supplied by a discarded gown and</p>
<p>our caps, all <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_671">conscientiously</a> battered, Hatherleigh's flopped like</p>
<p>an elephant's ear and inserted quill pens supported the corners of</p>
<p>mine; the highlights of the picture came chiefly as reflections from</p>
<p>his chequered blue mugs full of audit ale. We sat on oak chairs,</p>
<p>except the four or five who crowded on a capacious settle, we drank</p>
<p>a lot of beer and were often fuddled, and occasionally quite drunk,</p>
<p>and we all smoked reckless-looking pipes,-there was a transient</p>
<p>fashion among us for corn cobs for which Mark Twain, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_672">think</a>, was</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_673">responsible</a>. Our little excesses with liquor were due far more to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_674">conscience</a> than appetite, indicated chiefly a resolve to break away</p>
<p>from restraints that we suspected were keeping us off the</p>
<p>instructive knife-edges of life. Hatherleigh was a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_669">good</a> Englishman</p>
<p>of the premature type with a red face, a lot of hair, a deep voice</p>
<p>and an explosive plunging manner, and it was he who said one</p>
<p>evening-Heaven <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_675">knows</a> how we got to it-" Look here, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_676">know</a>, it's</p>
<p>all Rot, this Shutting Up about Women. We OUGHT to talk about them.</p>
<p>What are we going to do about them? It's got to come. We're all</p>
<p>festering inside about it. Let's out with it. There's too much</p>
<p>Decency altogether about this Infernal University!"</p>
<p>We rose to his challenge a little awkwardly and our first talk was</p>
<p>clumsy, there were flushed faces and red ears, and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_677">remember</a></p>
<p>Hatherleigh broke out into a monologue on decency. "Modesty and</p>
<p>Decency," said Hatherleigh, "are Oriental vices. The Jews brought</p>
<p>them to Europe. They're Semitic, just like our monasticism here and</p>
<p>the seclusion of women and mutilating the dead on a battlefield.</p>
<p>And all that sort of thing."</p>
<p>Hatherleigh's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_678">mind</a> progressed by huge leaps, leaps that were usually</p>
<p>wildly inaccurate, and for a time we engaged hotly upon the topic of</p>
<p>those alleged mutilations and the Semitic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_679">responsibility</a> for</p>
<p>decency. Hatherleigh tried hard to saddle the Semitic race with the</p>
<p>less elegant war customs of the Soudan and the northwest frontier of</p>
<p>India, and quoted Doughty, at that time a little-known author, and</p>
<p>Cunninghame Graham to show that the Arab was worse than a county-</p>
<p>town spinster in his regard for respectability. But his case was</p>
<p>too preposterous, and Esmeer, with his shrill penetrating voice and</p>
<p>his way of pointing with all four long fingers flat together,</p>
<p>carried the point against him. He quoted Cato and Roman law and the</p>
<p>monasteries of Thibet.</p>
<p>"Well, anyway," said Hatherleigh, escaping from our hands like an</p>
<p>intellectual frog, "Semitic or not, I've got no use for decency."</p>
<p>We argued points and Hatherleigh professed an unusually balanced and</p>
<p>tolerating <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_680">attitude</a>. "I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_681">mind</a> a certain refinement and</p>
<p>dignity," he admitted <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_682">generously</a>. "What I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_683">object</a> to is this</p>
<p>spreading out of decency until it darkens the whole sky, until it</p>
<p>makes a man's father afraid to speak of the most important things,</p>
<p>until it makes a man afraid to look a frank book in the face or</p>
<p>think-even <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_684">think</a>! until it leads to our coming to-to the business</p>
<p>at last with nothing but a few prohibitions, a few hints, a lot of</p>
<p>dirty jokes and, and "-he waved a hand and seemed to seek and catch</p>
<p>his image in the air-" oh, a confounded buttered slide of</p>
<p>sentiment, to guide us. I tell you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_685">I'm</a> going to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_684">think</a> about it and</p>
<p>talk about it until I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_686">see</a> a little more daylight than I do at</p>
<p>present. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_685">I'm</a> twenty-two. Things might happen to me anywhen. You</p>
<p>men can go out into the world if you like, to sin like fools and</p>
<p>marry like fools, not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_687">knowing</a> what you are doing and ashamed to ask.</p>
<p>You'll take the consequences, too, I expect, pretty meekly,</p>
<p>sniggering a bit, sentimentalising a bit, like-like Cambridge</p>
<p>humorists… I mean to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_688">know</a> what <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_685">I'm</a> doing."</p>
<p>He paused to drink, and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_689">think</a> I cut in with ideas of my own. But</p>
<p>one is apt to forget one's own share in a talk, I find, more than</p>
<p>one does the clear-cut <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_690">objectivity</a> of other people's, and I do not</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_691">know</a> how far I contributed to this discussion that followed. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_692">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_693">am</a>,</p>
<p>however, pretty certain that it was then that ideal that we were</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_694">pleased</a> to call aristocracy and which soon became the common</p>
<p>property of our set was developed. It was Esmeer, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_691">know</a>, who laid</p>
<p>down and maintained the proposition that so far as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_695">minds</a> went there</p>
<p>were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_696">really</a> only two sorts of man in the world, the aristocrat and</p>
<p>the man who subdues his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_695">mind</a> to other people's.</p>
<p>"'I couldn't THINK of it, Sir,'" said Esmeer in his elucidatory</p>
<p>tones; "that's what a servant says. His <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_697">mind</a> even is broken in to</p>
<p>run between fences, and he admits it. WE'VE got to he able to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_698">think</a></p>
<p>of anything. And 'such things aren't for the Likes of Us!' That's</p>
<p>another servant's saying. Well, everything IS for the Likes of Us.</p>
<p>If we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_699">see</a> fit, that is."</p>
<p>A small fresh-coloured man in grey objected.</p>
<p>"Well," exploded Hatherleigh, "if that isn't so what the deuce are</p>
<p>we up here for? Instead of working in mines? If some things aren't</p>
<p>to be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_700">thought</a> about ever! We've got the privilege of all these</p>
<p>extra years for getting things straight in our heads, and then we</p>
<p>won't use 'em. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_701">Good</a> God! what do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_702">think</a> a university's for?"…</p>
<p>Esmeer's idea came with an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_703">effect</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_704">real</a> emancipation to several of</p>
<p>us. We were not going to be afraid of ideas any longer, we were</p>
<p>going to throw down every barrier of prohibition and take them in</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_705">see</a> what came of it. We became for a time even intemperately</p>
<p>experimental, and one of us, at the bare suggestion of an eminent</p>
<p>psychic investigator, took hashish and very nearly died of it within</p>
<p>a fortnight of our great elucidation.</p>
<p>The chief matter of our interchanges was of course the discussion of</p>
<p>sex. Once the theme had been opened it became a sore place in our</p>
<p>intercourse; none of us seemed able to keep away from it. Our</p>
<p>imaginations got astir with it. We made up for lost time and went</p>
<p>round it and through it and over it exhaustively. I recall</p>
<p>prolonged discussion of polygamy on the way to Royston, muddy</p>
<p>November tramps to Madingley, when amidst much profanity from</p>
<p>Hatherleigh at the serious treatment of so obsolete a matter, we</p>
<p>weighed the reasons, if any, for the institution of marriage. The</p>
<p>fine dim night-time spaces of the Great Court are bound up with the</p>
<p>inconclusive finales of mighty hot-eared wrangles; the narrows of</p>
<p>Trinity Street and Petty Cury and Market Hill have their particular</p>
<p>associations for me with that spate of confession and free speech,</p>
<p>that almost <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_706">painful</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_707">goal</a> delivery of long pent and crappled and</p>
<p>sometimes crippled ideas.</p>
<p>And we went on a reading party that Easter to a place called</p>
<p>Pulborough in Sussex, where there is a fishing inn and a river that</p>
<p>goes under a bridge. It was a late Easter and a blazing one, and we</p>
<p>boated and bathed and talked of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_708">being</a> Hellenic and the beauty of the</p>
<p>body until at moments it seemed to us that we were destined to</p>
<p>restore the Golden Age, by the simple abolition of tailors and</p>
<p>outfitters.</p>
<p>Those undergraduate talks! how rich and glorious they seemed, how</p>
<p>splendidly new the ideas that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_709">grew</a> and multiplied in our seething</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_710">minds</a>! We made long afternoon and evening raids over the Downs</p>
<p>towards Arundel, and would come tramping back through the still keen</p>
<p>moonlight singing and shouting. We formed romantic friendships with</p>
<p>one another, and grieved more or less convincingly that there were</p>
<p>no splendid women fit to be our companions in the world. But</p>
<p>Hatherleigh, it seemed, had once <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_711">known</a> a girl whose hair was</p>
<p>gloriously red. "My God!" said Hatherleigh to convey the quality of</p>
<p>her; just simply and with projectile violence: "My God!</p>
<p>Benton had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_712">heard</a> of a woman who lived with a man refusing to be</p>
<p>married to him-we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_713">thought</a> that splendid beyond measure,-I cannot</p>
<p>now imagine why. She was "like a tender goddess," Benton said. A</p>
<p>sort of shame came upon us in the dark in spite of our liberal</p>
<p>intentions when Benton committed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_714">himself</a> to that. And after such</p>
<p>talk we would fall upon great pauses of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_715">emotional</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_716">dreaming</a>, and if</p>
<p>by chance we passed a girl in a governess cart, or some farmer's</p>
<p>daughter walking to the station, we became alertly silent or</p>
<p>obstreperously indifferent to her. For might she not be just that</p>
<p>one exception to the banal decency, the sickly pointless</p>
<p>conventionality, the sham modesty of the times in which we lived?</p>
<p>We <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_717">felt</a> we stood for a new movement, not realising how perennially</p>
<p>this same emancipation returns to those ancient courts beside the</p>
<p>Cam. We were the anti-decency party, we discovered a catch phrase</p>
<p>that we flourished about in the Union and made our watchword,</p>
<p>namely, "stark fact." We hung nude pictures in our rooms much as if</p>
<p>they had been flags, to the earnest concern of our bedders, and I</p>
<p>disinterred my long-kept engraving and had it framed in fumed oak,</p>
<p>and found for it a completer and less restrained companion, a</p>
<p>companion I never cared for in the slightest degree…</p>
<p>This efflorescence did not prevent, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_718">think</a> indeed it rather <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_719">helped</a>,</p>
<p>our more formal university work, for most of us took firsts, and</p>
<p>three of us got Fellowships in one year or another. There was</p>
<p>Benton who had a Research Fellowship and went to Tubingen, there was</p>
<p>Esmeer and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_720">myself</a> who both became Residential Fellows. I had taken</p>
<p>the Mental and Moral Science Tripos (as it was then), and three</p>
<p>years later I got a lectureship in political science. In those days</p>
<p>it was disguised in the cloak of Political Economy.</p>

</title>
<p>It was our affectation to be a little <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_721">detached</a> from the main stream</p>
<p>of undergraduate life. We worked pretty hard, but by <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_722">virtue</a> of our</p>
<p>beer, our socialism and suchlike heterodoxy, held <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_723">ourselves</a> to be</p>
<p>differentiated from the swatting reading man. None of us, except</p>
<p>Baxter, who was a rowing blue, a rather abnormal blue with an</p>
<p>appetite for ideas, took games seriously enough to train, and on the</p>
<p>other hand we intimated contempt for the rather mediocre,</p>
<p>deliberately humorous, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_724">consciously</a> gentlemanly and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_724">consciously</a> wild</p>
<p>undergraduate men who made up the mass of Cambridge life. After the</p>
<p>manner of youth we were altogether too hard on our contemporaries.</p>
<p>We battered our caps and tore our gowns lest they should seem new,</p>
<p>and we despised these others extremely for doing exactly the same</p>
<p>things; we had an idea of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_723">ourselves</a> and resented beyond measure a</p>
<p>similar weakness in these our brothers.</p>
<p>There was a type, or at least there seemed to us to be a type-I'm a</p>
<p>little <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_725">doubtful</a> at times now whether after all we didn't create it-</p>
<p>for which Hatherleigh invented the nickname the "Pinky Dinkys,"</p>
<p>intending thereby both contempt and abhorrence in almost equal</p>
<p>measure. The Pinky Dinky summarised all that we particularly did</p>
<p>not want to be, and also, I now <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_726">perceive</a>, much of what we were and</p>
<p>all that we secretly dreaded becoming.</p>
<p>But it is hard to convey the Pinky Dinky idea, for all that it meant</p>
<p>so much to us. We spent one evening at least during that reading</p>
<p>party upon the Pinky Dinky; we sat about our one fire after a walk</p>
<p>in the rain-it was our only wet day-smoked our excessively virile</p>
<p>pipes, and elaborated the natural history of the Pinky Dinky. We</p>
<p>improvised a sort of Pinky Dinky litany, and Hatherleigh supplied</p>
<p>deep notes for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_727">responses</a>.</p>
<p>"The Pinky Dinky extracts a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_728">good</a> deal of amusement from life," said</p>
<p>some one.</p>
<p>"Damned prig! " said Hatherleigh.</p>
<p>"The Pinky Dinky arises in the Union and treats the question with a</p>
<p>light gay <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_729">touch</a>. He makes the weird ones mad. But sometimes he</p>
<p>cannot go on because of the amusement he extracts."</p>
<p>"I want to shy books at the giggling swine," said Hatherleigh.</p>
<p>"The Pinky Dinky says suddenly while he is making the tea, 'We're</p>
<p>all <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_730">being</a> frightfully funny. It's time for you to say something</p>
<p>now.'"</p>
<p>"The Pinky Dinky shakes his head and says: 'I'm afraid I shall never</p>
<p>be a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_731">responsible</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_732">being</a>.' And he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_733">really</a> IS frivolous."</p>
<p>"Frivolous but not vulgar," said Esmeer.</p>
<p>"Pinky Dinkys are chaps who've had their buds nipped," said</p>
<p>Hatherleigh. "They're Plebs and they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_734">know</a> it. They haven't the</p>
<p>Guts to get hold of things. And so they worry up all those silly</p>
<p>little jokes of theirs to carry it off."…</p>
<p>We tried bad ones for a time, viciously flavoured.</p>
<p>Pinky Dinkys are due to over-production of the type that ought to</p>
<p>keep outfitters' shops. Pinky Dinkys would like to keep outfitters'</p>
<p>shops with whimsy 'scriptions on the boxes and make your bill out</p>
<p>funny, and not be snobs to customers, no!-not even if they had</p>
<p>titles."</p>
<p>"Every Pinky Dinky's people are rather <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_735">good</a> people, and better than</p>
<p>most Pinky Dinky's people. But he does not put on side."</p>
<p>"Pinky Dinkys become playful at the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_736">sight</a> of women."</p>
<p>"'Croquet's my game,' said the Pinky Dinky, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_737">felt</a> a man</p>
<p>condescended."</p>
<p>"But what the devil do they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_738">think</a> they're up to, anyhow?" roared old</p>
<p>Hatherleigh suddenly, dropping plump into bottomless <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_739">despair</a>.</p>
<p>We <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_740">felt</a> we had still failed to get at the core of the mystery of the</p>
<p>Pinky Dinky.</p>
<p>We tried over things about his religion. "The Pinky Dinky goes to</p>
<p>King's Chapel, and sits and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_741">feels</a> in the dusk. Solemn things! Oh</p>
<p>HUSH! He wouldn't tell you-"</p>
<p>"He COULDN'T tell you."</p>
<p>"Religion is so sacred to him he never talks about it, never reads</p>
<p>about it, never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_742">thinks</a> about it. Just <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_743">feels</a>!"</p>
<p>"But in his heart of hearts, oh! ever so deep, the Pinky Dinky has a</p>
<p>doubt-"</p>
<p>Some one protested.</p>
<p>"Not a vulgar <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_744">doubt</a>," Esmeer went on, "but a kind of hesitation</p>
<p>whether the Ancient of Days is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_745">really</a> exactly what one would call</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_746">good</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_747">form</a>… There's a lot of horrid coarseness got into the</p>
<p>world somehow. SOMEBODY put it there… And anyhow there's no</p>
<p>particular reason why a man should be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_748">seen</a> about with Him. He's</p>
<p>jolly Awful of course and all that-"</p>
<p>"The Pinky Dinky for all his fun and levity has a clean <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_749">mind</a>."</p>
<p>"A thoroughly clean <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_750">mind</a>. Not like Esmeer's-the Pig!"</p>
<p>"If once he began to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_751">think</a> about sex, how could he be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_752">comfortable</a> at</p>
<p>croquet?"</p>
<p>"It's their Damned Modesty," said Hatherleigh suddenly, "that's</p>
<p>what's the matter with the Pinky Dinky. It's Mental Cowardice</p>
<p>dressed up as a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_753">virtue</a> and taking the poor dears in. Cambridge is</p>
<p>soaked with it; it's some confounded local bacillus. Like the thing</p>
<p>that gives a flavour to Havana cigars. He comes up here to be made</p>
<p>into a man and a ruler of the people, and he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_754">thinks</a> it shows a nice</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_755">disposition</a> not to take on the job! How the Devil is a great Empire</p>
<p>to be run with men like him?"</p>
<p>"All his little jokes and things," said Esmeer regarding his feet on</p>
<p>the fender, "it's just a nervous sniggering-because he's afraid…</p>
<p>Oxford's no better."</p>
<p>"What's he afraid of?" said I.</p>
<p>"God <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_756">knows</a>!" exploded Hatherleigh and stared at the fire.</p>
<p>"LIFE!" said Esmeer. "And so in a way are we," he added, and made a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_757">thoughtful</a> silence for a time.</p>
<p>"I say," began Carter, who was doing the Natural Science Tripos,</p>
<p>"what is the adult <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_758">form</a> of the Pinky Dinky?"</p>
<p>But there we were checked by our ignorance of the world.</p>
<p>"What is the adult <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_759">form</a> of any of us?" asked Benton, voicing the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_760">thought</a> that had arrested our flow.</p>

</title>
<p>I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_761">remember</a> that we ever lifted our criticism to the dons and</p>
<p>the organisation of the University. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_762">think</a> we took them for</p>
<p>granted. When I look back at my youth <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_763">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_764">am</a> always astonished by the</p>
<p>multitude of things that we took for granted. It seemed to us that</p>
<p>Cambridge was in the order of things, for all the world like having</p>
<p>eyebrows or a vermiform appendix. Now with the larger scepticism of</p>
<p>middle age I can entertain very fundamental <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_765">doubts</a> about these old</p>
<p>universities. Indeed I had a scheme-</p>
<p>I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_766">see</a> what harm I can do now by laying bare the purpose of</p>
<p>the political combinations I was trying to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_767">effect</a>.</p>
<p>My educational scheme was indeed the starting-point of all the big</p>
<p>project of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_768">conscious</a> public reconstruction at which I aimed. I</p>
<p>wanted to build up a new educational machine altogether for the</p>
<p>governing class out of a consolidated system of special public</p>
<p>service schools. I meant to get to work upon this whatever office I</p>
<p>was given in the new government. I could have begun my plan from</p>
<p>the Admiralty or the War Office quite as easily as from the</p>
<p>Education Office. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_769">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_770">am</a> firmly convinced it is hopeless to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_771">think</a> of</p>
<p>reforming the old public schools and universities to meet the needs</p>
<p>of a modern <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_772">state</a>, they send their roots too deep and far, the cost</p>
<p>would exceed any <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_773">good</a> that could possibly be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_774">effected</a>, and so I have</p>
<p>sought a way round this invincible obstacle. I do <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_771">think</a> it would be</p>
<p>quite practicable to side-track, as the Americans say, the whole</p>
<p>system by creating hardworking, hard-living, modern and scientific</p>
<p>boys' schools, first for the Royal Navy and then for the public</p>
<p>service generally, and as they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_775">grew</a>, opening them to the public</p>
<p>without any <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_776">absolute</a> obligation to subsequent service.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with this it would not be impossible to develop a new</p>
<p>college system with strong faculties in modern philosophy, modern</p>
<p>history, European literature and criticism, physical and biological</p>
<p>science, education and sociology.</p>
<p>We could in fact create a new liberal education in this way, and cut</p>
<p>the umbilicus of the classical languages for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_777">good</a> and all. I should</p>
<p>have set this going, and trusted it to correct or kill the old</p>
<p>public schools and the Oxford and Cambridge tradition altogether. I</p>
<p>had men in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_778">mind</a> to begin the work, and I should have found</p>
<p>others. I should have aimed at making a hard-trained, capable,</p>
<p>intellectually active, proud type of man. Everything else would</p>
<p>have been made subservient to that. I should have kept my grip on</p>
<p>the men through their vacation, and somehow or other I would have</p>
<p>contrived a young woman to match them. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_779">think</a> I could have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_780">seen</a> to</p>
<p>it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_781">effectually</a> enough that they didn't get at croquet and tennis</p>
<p>with the vicarage daughters and discover sex in the Peeping Tom</p>
<p>fashion I did, and that they realised quite early in life that it</p>
<p>isn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_782">really</a> virile to reek of tobacco. I should have had military</p>
<p>manoeuvres, training ships, aeroplane work, mountaineering and so</p>
<p>forth, in the place of the solemn trivialities of games, and I</p>
<p>should have fed and housed my men clean and very hard-where there</p>
<p>wasn't any audit ale, no credit tradesmen, and plenty of high</p>
<p>pressure douches…</p>
<p>I have revisited Cambridge and Oxford time after time since I came</p>
<p>down, and so far as the Empire goes, I want to get clear of those</p>
<p>two places…</p>
<p>Always I renew my old <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_783">feelings</a>, a physical oppression, a sense of</p>
<p>lowness and dampness almost exactly like the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_783">feeling</a> of an</p>
<p>underground room where paper moulders and leaves the wall, a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_783">feeling</a></p>
<p>of ineradicable contagion in the Gothic buildings, in the narrow</p>
<p>ditch-like rivers, in those roads and roads of stuffy little villas.</p>
<p>Those little villas have destroyed all the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_784">good</a> of the old monastic</p>
<p>system and none of its evil…</p>
<p>Some of the most charming people in the world live in them, but</p>
<p>their collective <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_785">effect</a> is below the quality of any individual among</p>
<p>them. Cambridge is a world of subdued tones, of excessively subtle</p>
<p>humours, of prim conduct and free <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_786">thinking</a>; it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_787">fears</a> the Parent, but</p>
<p>it has no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_787">fear</a> of God; it offers amidst surroundings that vary</p>
<p>between disguises and antiquarian charm the inflammation of</p>
<p>literature's purple draught; one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_788">hears</a> there a peculiar thin scandal</p>
<p>like no other scandal in the world-a covetous scandal-so that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_789">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_790">am</a></p>
<p>always reminded of Ibsen in Cambridge. In Cambridge and the plays</p>
<p>of Ibsen <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_791">alone</a> does it seem appropriate for the heroine before the</p>
<p>great crisis of life to "enter, take off her overshoes, and put her</p>
<p>wet umbrella upon the writing desk."…</p>
<p>We have to make a new Academic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_792">mind</a> for modern needs, and the last</p>
<p>thing to make it out of, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_793">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_794">am</a> convinced, is the old Academic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_792">mind</a>.</p>
<p>One might as soon try to fake the old VICTORY at Portsmouth into a</p>
<p>line of battleship again. Besides which the old Academic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_792">mind</a>, like</p>
<p>those old bathless, damp Gothic colleges, is much too delightful in</p>
<p>its peculiar and distinctive way to damage by futile patching.</p>
<p>My heart warms to a sense of affectionate absurdity as I recall dear</p>
<p>old Codger, surely the most "unleaderly" of men. No more than from</p>
<p>the old Schoolmen, his kindred, could one get from him a School for</p>
<p>Princes. Yet apart from his teaching he was as curious and adorable</p>
<p>as a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_795">good</a> Netsuke. Until quite recently he was a power in</p>
<p>Cambridge, he could make and bar and destroy, and in a way he has</p>
<p>become the quintessence of Cambridge in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_796">thoughts</a>.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_797">see</a> him on his way to the morning's lecture, with his plump</p>
<p>childish face, his round innocent eyes, his absurdly non-prehensile</p>
<p>fat hand carrying his cap, his grey trousers braced up much too</p>
<p>high, his feet a trifle inturned, and going across the great court</p>
<p>with a queer tripping pace that seemed cultivated even to my naive</p>
<p>undergraduate eye. Or I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_797">see</a> him lecturing. He lectured walking up</p>
<p>and down between the desks, talking in a fluting rapid voice, and</p>
<p>with the utmost lucidity. If he could not walk up and down he could</p>
<p>not lecture. His <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_798">mind</a> and voice had precisely the fluid quality of</p>
<p>some clear subtle liquid; one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_799">felt</a> it could flow round anything and</p>
<p>overcome nothing. And its nimble eddies were wonderful! Or again I</p>
<p>recall him drinking port with little muscular movements in his neck</p>
<p>and cheek and chin and his brows knit-very judicial, very</p>
<p>concentrated, preparing to say the apt just thing; it was the last</p>
<p>thing he would have told a lie about.</p>
<p>When I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_800">think</a> of Codger <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_801">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_802">am</a> reminded of an inscription I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_803">saw</a> on some</p>
<p>occasion in Regent's Park above two eyes scarcely more limpidly</p>
<p>innocent than his-"Born in the Menagerie." Never once since Codger</p>
<p>began to display the early promise of scholarship at the age of</p>
<p>eight or more, had he been outside the bars. His utmost travel had</p>
<p>been to lecture here and lecture there. His student phase had</p>
<p>culminated in papers of quite exceptional brilliance, and he had</p>
<p>gone on to lecture with a cheerful combination of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_804">wit</a> and mannerism</p>
<p>that had made him a success from the beginning. He has lectured</p>
<p>ever since. He lectures still. Year by year he has become plumper,</p>
<p>more rubicund and more and more of an item for the intelligent</p>
<p>visitor to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_805">see</a>. Even in my time he was pointed out to people as</p>
<p>part of our innumerable enrichments, and obviously he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_806">knew</a> it. He</p>
<p>has become now almost the leading <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_807">Character</a> in a little donnish</p>
<p>world of much too intensely appreciated <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_808">Characters</a>.</p>
<p>He boasted he took no exercise, and also of his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_809">knowledge</a> of port</p>
<p>wine. Of other wines he confessed quite frankly he had no "special</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_809">knowledge</a>." Beyond these things he had little pride except that he</p>
<p>claimed to have read every novel by a woman writer that had ever</p>
<p>entered the Union Library. This, however, he held to be remarkable</p>
<p>rather than <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_810">ennobling</a>, and such boasts as he made of it were tinged</p>
<p>with playfulness. Certainly he had a scholar's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_809">knowledge</a> of the</p>
<p>works of Miss Marie Corelli, Miss Braddon, Miss Elizabeth Glyn and</p>
<p>Madame Sarah Grand that would have astonished and flattered those</p>
<p>ladies enormously, and he loved nothing so much in his hours of</p>
<p>relaxation as to propound and answer difficult questions upon their</p>
<p>books. Tusher of King's was his ineffectual rival in this field,</p>
<p>their bouts were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_811">memorable</a> and rarely other than glorious for</p>
<p>Codger; but then Tusher spread <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_812">himself</a> too much, he also undertook</p>
<p>to rehearse whole pages out of Bradshaw, and tell you with all the</p>
<p>changes how to get from any station to any station in Great Britain</p>
<p>by the nearest and cheapest routes…</p>
<p>Codger lodged with a little deaf innocent old lady, Mrs. Araminta</p>
<p>Mergle, who was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_813">understood</a> to be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_814">herself</a> a very redoubtable</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_815">Character</a> in the Gyp-Bedder class; about her he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_816">related</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_817">quietly</a></p>
<p>absurd anecdotes. He displayed a marvellous invention in ascribing</p>
<p>to her plausible expressions of opinion entirely identical in import</p>
<p>with those of the Oxford and Harvard Pragmatists, against whom he</p>
<p>waged a fierce obscure war…</p>
<p>It was Codger's function to teach me philosophy, philosophy! the</p>
<p>intimate <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_818">wisdom</a> of things. He dealt in a variety of Hegelian stuff</p>
<p>like nothing else in the world, but marvellously consistent with</p>
<p>itself. It was a wonderful web he spun out of that queer big active</p>
<p>childish brain that had never lusted nor <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_819">hated</a> nor grieved nor</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_820">feared</a> nor passionately loved,-a web of iridescent threads. He had</p>
<p>luminous final theories about Love and Death and Immortality, odd</p>
<p>matters they seemed for him to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_821">think</a> about! and all his woven</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_822">thoughts</a> lay across my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_823">perception</a> of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_824">realities</a> of things, as</p>
<p>flimsy and irrelevant and clever and beautiful, oh!-as a dew-wet</p>
<p>spider's web slung in the morning sunshine across the black mouth of</p>
<p>a gun…</p>

<p>All through those years of development I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_825">perceive</a> now there must</p>
<p>have been <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_826">growing</a> in me, slowly, irregularly, assimilating to itself</p>
<p>all the phrases and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_827">forms</a> of patriotism, diverting my religious</p>
<p>impulses, utilising my esthetic tendencies, my dominating idea, the</p>
<p>statesman's idea, that idea of social service which is the</p>
<p>protagonist of my story, that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_828">real</a> though complex passion for</p>
<p>Making, making widely and greatly, cities, national order,</p>
<p>civilisation, whose interplay with all those other factors in life I</p>
<p>have set out to present. It was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_826">growing</a> in me-as one's bones <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_829">grow</a>,</p>
<p>no man intending it.</p>
<p>I have tried to show how, quite early in my life, the fact of</p>
<p>disorderliness, the conception of social life as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_830">being</a> a</p>
<p>multitudinous <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_831">confusion</a> out of hand, came to me. One always of</p>
<p>course simplifies these things in the telling, but I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_832">think</a> I</p>
<p>ever <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_833">saw</a> the world at large in any other terms. I never at any</p>
<p>stage entertamed the idea which sustained my mother, and which</p>
<p>sustains so many people in the world,-the idea that the universe,</p>
<p>whatever superficial discords it may present, is as a matter of fact</p>
<p>"all right," is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_830">being</a> steered to definite ends by a serene and</p>
<p>unquestionable God. My mother <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_834">thought</a> that Order prevailed, and</p>
<p>that disorder was just incidental and foredoomed rebellion; I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_835">feel</a></p>
<p>and have always <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_835">felt</a> that order rebels against and struggles against</p>
<p>disorder, that order has an up-hill job, in gardens, experiments,</p>
<p>suburbs, everything alike; from the very beginnings of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_836">experience</a></p>
<p>I discovered hostility to order, a constant escaping from control.</p>
<p>The current of living and contemporary ideas in which my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_837">mind</a> was</p>
<p>presently swimming made all in the same direction; in place of my</p>
<p>mother's attentive, meticulous but occasionally extremely irascible</p>
<p>Providence, the talk was all of the Struggle for Existenc and the</p>
<p>survival not of the Best-that was nonsense, but of the fittest to</p>
<p>survive.</p>
<p>The attempts to rehabilitate <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_838">Faith</a> in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_839">form</a> of the</p>
<p>Individualist's LAISSEZ FAIRE never won upon me. I disliked Herbert</p>
<p>Spencer all my life until I read his autobiography, and then I</p>
<p>laughed a little and loved him. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_840">remember</a> as early as the City</p>
<p>Merchants' days how Britten and I scoffed at that pompous question-</p>
<p>begging word "Evolution," having, so to speak, found it out.</p>
<p>Evolution, some illuminating talker had remarked at the Britten</p>
<p>lunch table, had led not only to man, but to the liver-fluke and</p>
<p>skunk, obviously it might lead anywhere; order came into things only</p>
<p>through the struggling <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_841">mind</a> of man. That lit things wonderfully for</p>
<p>us. When I went up to Cambridge I was perfectly clear that life was</p>
<p>a various and splendid disorder of forces that the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_842">spirit</a> of man</p>
<p>sets itself to tame. I have never since fallen away from that</p>
<p>persuasion.</p>
<p>I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_843">think</a> I was exceptionally precocious in reaching these</p>
<p>conclusions and a sort of religious finality for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_844">myself</a> by eighteen</p>
<p>or nineteen. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_845">know</a> men and women vary very much in these matters,</p>
<p>just as children do in learning to talk. Some will chatter at</p>
<p>eighteen months and some will hardly speak until three, and the</p>
<p>thing has very little to do with their subsequent mental quality.</p>
<p>So it is with young people; some will begin their religious, their</p>
<p>social, their sexual interests at fourteen, some not until far on in</p>
<p>the twenties. Britten and I belonged to one of the precocious</p>
<p>types, and Cossington very probably to another. It wasn't that</p>
<p>there was anything priggish about any of us; we should have been</p>
<p>prigs to have concealed our spontaneous interests and ape the</p>
<p>theoretical boy.</p>
<p>The world of man centred for my imagination in London, it still</p>
<p>centres there; the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_846">real</a> and present world, that is to say, as</p>
<p>distinguished from the wonder-lands of atomic and microscopic</p>
<p>science and the stars and future time. I had travelled scarcely at</p>
<p>all, I had never crossed the Channel, but I had read copiously and I</p>
<p>had formed a very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_847">good</a> working idea of this round globe with its</p>
<p>mountains and wildernesses and forests and all the sorts and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_848">conditions</a> of human life that were scattered over its surface. It</p>
<p>was all alive, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_849">felt</a>, and changing every day; how it was changing,</p>
<p>and the changes men might bring about, fascinated my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_850">mind</a> beyond</p>
<p>measure.</p>
<p>I used to find a charm in old maps that showed The World as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_851">Known</a> to</p>
<p>the Ancients, and I wish I could now without any suspicion of self-</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_852">deception</a> write down compactly the world as it was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_851">known</a> to me at</p>
<p>nineteen. So far as extension went it was, I fancy, very like the</p>
<p>world I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_853">know</a> now at forty-two; I had practically all the mountains</p>
<p>and seas, boundaries and races, products and possibilities that I</p>
<p>have now. But its intension was very different. All the interval</p>
<p>has been increasing and deepening my social <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_854">knowledge</a>, replacing</p>
<p>crude and second-hand impressions by <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_855">felt</a> and realised distinctions.</p>
<p>In 1895-that was my last year with Britten, for I went up to</p>
<p>Cambridge in September-my vision of the world had much the same</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_856">relation</a> to the vision I have to-day that an ill-drawn daub of a</p>
<p>mask has to the direct vision of a human face. Britten and I looked</p>
<p>at our world and saw-what did we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_857">see</a>? <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_858">Forms</a> and colours side by</p>
<p>side that we had no suspicion were interdependent. We had no</p>
<p>conception of the roots of things nor of the reaction of things. It</p>
<p>did not seem to us, for example, that business had anything to do</p>
<p>with government, or that money and means affected the heroic issues</p>
<p>of war. There were no wagons in our war game, and where there were</p>
<p>guns, there it was assumed the ammunition was gathered together.</p>
<p>Finance again was a sealed book to us; we did not so much connect it</p>
<p>with the broad aspects of human affairs as regard it as a sort of</p>
<p>intrusive nuisance to be earnestly ignored by all right-minded men.</p>
<p>We had no conception of the quality of politics, nor how "interests"</p>
<p>came into such affairs; we believed men were swayed by purely</p>
<p>intellectual convictions and were either right or wrong, honest or</p>
<p>dishonest (in which ease they deserved to be shot), <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_859">good</a> or bad. We</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_860">knew</a> nothing of mental inertia, and could imagine the opinion of a</p>
<p>whole nation changed by one lucid and convincing exposition. We</p>
<p>were capable of the most incongruous transfers from the scroll of</p>
<p>history to our own times, we could suppose Brixton ravaged and</p>
<p>Hampstead burnt in civil wars for the succession to the throne, or</p>
<p>Cheapside a lane of death and the front of the Mansion House set</p>
<p>about with guillotines in the course of an accurately transposed</p>
<p>French Revolution. We rebuilt London by Act of Parliament, and once</p>
<p>in a mood of hygienic enterprise we transferred its population EN</p>
<p>MASSE to the North Downs by an order of the Local Government Board.</p>
<p>We <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_861">thought</a> nothing of throwing religious organisations out of</p>
<p>employment or superseding all the newspapers by freely distributed</p>
<p>bulletins. We could contemplate the possibility of laws abolishing</p>
<p>whole classes; we were equal to such a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_862">dream</a> as the peaceful and</p>
<p>orderly proclamation of Communism from the steps of St. Paul's</p>
<p>Cathedral, after the passing of a simply worded bill,-a close and</p>
<p>not unnaturally an exciting division carrying the third reading. I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_863">remember</a> quite distinctly evolving that vision. We were then fully</p>
<p>fifteen and we were perfectly serious about it. We were not fools;</p>
<p>it was simply that as yet we had gathered no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_864">experience</a> at all of</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_865">limits</a> and powers of legislation and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_866">conscious</a> collective</p>
<p>intention…</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_867">think</a> this statement does my boyhood justice, and yet I have my</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_868">doubts</a>. It is so hard now to say what one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_869">understood</a> and what one</p>
<p>did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_870">understand</a>. It isn't only that every day changed one's</p>
<p>general outlook, but also that a boy fluctuates between phases of</p>
<p>quite adult <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_871">understanding</a> and phases of tawdrily magnificent</p>
<p>puerility. Sometimes I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_872">myself</a> was in those tumbrils that went along</p>
<p>Cheapside to the Mansion House, a Sydney Cartonesque figure, a white</p>
<p>defeated Mirabean; sometimes it was I who sat judging and condemning</p>
<p>and ruling (sleeping in my clothes and feeding very simply) the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_873">soul</a></p>
<p>and autocrat of the Provisional Government, which occupied, of all</p>
<p>inconvenient places! the General Post Office at St. Martin's-le-</p>
<p>Grand!…</p>
<p>I cannot trace the development of my ideas at Cambridge, but I</p>
<p>believe the mere physical fact of going two hours' journey away from</p>
<p>London gave that place for the first time an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_874">effect</a> of unity in my</p>
<p>imagination. I got outside London. It became tangible instead of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_875">being</a> a frame almost as universal as sea and sky.</p>
<p>At Cambridge my ideas <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_876">ceased</a> to live in a duologue; in exchange for</p>
<p>Britten, with whom, however, I corresponded lengthily, stylishly and</p>
<p>self-consciously for some years, I had now a set of congenial</p>
<p>friends. I got talk with some of the younger dons, I learnt to</p>
<p>speak in the Union, and in my little set we were all pretty busily</p>
<p>sharpening each other's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_877">wits</a> and correcting each other's</p>
<p>interpretations. Cambridge made politics personal and actual. At</p>
<p>City Merchants' we had had no sense of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_878">effective</a> contact; we</p>
<p>boasted, it is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_879">true</a>, an under secretary and a colonial governor</p>
<p>among our old boys, but they were never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_880">real</a> to us; such</p>
<p>distinguished sons as returned to visit the old school were allusive</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_881">pleasant</a> in the best Pinky Dinky style, and pretended to be in</p>
<p>earnest about nothing but our football and cricket, to mourn the</p>
<p>abolition of "water," and find a shuddering personal interest in the</p>
<p>ancient swishing block. At Cambridge I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_882">felt</a> for the first time that</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_883">touched</a> the thing that was going on. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_880">Real</a> living statesmen came</p>
<p>down to debate in the Union, the older dons had been their college</p>
<p>intimates, their sons and nephews expounded them to us and made them</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_880">real</a> to us. They invited us to entertain ideas; I found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_884">myself</a> for</p>
<p>the first time in my life expected to read and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_885">think</a> and discuss, my</p>
<p>secret vice had become a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_886">virtue</a>.</p>
<p>That combination-room world is at last larger and more populous and</p>
<p>various than the world of schoolmasters. The Shoesmiths and Naylors</p>
<p>who had been the aristocracy of City Merchants' fell into their</p>
<p>place in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_887">mind</a>; they became an undistinguished mass on the more</p>
<p>athletic side of Pinky Dinkyism, and their hostility to ideas and to</p>
<p>the expression of ideas <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_888">ceased</a> to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_889">limit</a> and trouble me. The</p>
<p>brighter men of each generation stay up; these others go down to</p>
<p>propagate their tradition, as the fathers of families, as mediocre</p>
<p>professional men, as assistant masters in schools. Cambridge which</p>
<p>perfects them is by the nature of things least oppressed by them,-</p>
<p>except when it comes to a vote in Convocation.</p>
<p>We were still in those days under the shadow of the great</p>
<p>Victorians. I never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_890">saw</a> Gladstone (as I never set eyes on the old</p>
<p>Queen), but he had resigned office only a year before I went up to</p>
<p>Trinity, and the Combination Rooms were full of personal gossip</p>
<p>about him and Disraeli and the other big figures of the gladiatorial</p>
<p>stage of Parlimentary history, talk that leaked copiously into such</p>
<p>sets as mine. The ceiling of our guest chamber at Trinity was</p>
<p>glorious with the arms of Sir William Harcourt, whose Death Duties</p>
<p>had seemed at first like a socialist dawn. Mr. Evesham we asked to</p>
<p>come to the Union every year, Masters, Chamberlain and the old Duke</p>
<p>of Devonshire; they did not come indeed, but their polite refusals</p>
<p>brought us all, as it were, within personal <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_891">touch</a> of them. One</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_892">heard</a> of cabinet councils and meetings at country houses. Some of</p>
<p>us, pursuing such interests, went so far as to read political</p>
<p>memoirs and the novels of Disraeli and Mrs. Humphry Ward. From</p>
<p>gossip, example and the illustrated newspapers one learnt something</p>
<p>of the way in which parties were split, coalitions formed, how</p>
<p>permanent officials worked and controlled their ministers, how</p>
<p>measures were brought forward and projects modified.</p>
<p>And while I was getting the great leading figures on the political</p>
<p>stage, who had been presented to me in my schooldays not so much as</p>
<p>men as the pantomimic monsters of political caricature, while I was</p>
<p>getting them reduced in my imagination to the stature of humanity,</p>
<p>and their motives to the quality of impulses like my own, I was also</p>
<p>acquiring in my Tripos work a constantly developing and enriching</p>
<p>conception of the world of men as a complex of economic,</p>
<p>intellectual and moral processes…</p>

<p>Socialism is an intellectual Proteus, but to the men of my</p>
<p>generation it came as the revolt of the workers. Rodbertus we never</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_893">heard</a> of and the Fabian Society we did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_894">understand</a>; Marx and</p>
<p>Morris, the Chicago Anarchists, JUSTICE and Social Democratic</p>
<p>Federation (as it was then) presented socialism to our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_895">minds</a>.</p>
<p>Hatherleigh was the leading exponent of the new doctrines in</p>
<p>Trinity, and the figure upon his wall of a huge-muscled, black-</p>
<p>haired toiler swaggering sledgehammer in hand across a revolutionary</p>
<p>barricade, seemed the quintessence of what he had to expound.</p>
<p>Landlord and capitalist had robbed and enslaved the workers, and</p>
<p>were driving them quite automatically to inevitable insurrection.</p>
<p>They would arise and the capitalist system would flee and vanish</p>
<p>like the mists before the morning, like the dews before the sunrise,</p>
<p>giving place in the most simple and obvious manner to an era of</p>
<p>Right and Justice and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_896">Virtue</a> and Well <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_897">Being</a>, and in short a</p>
<p>Perfectly Splendid Time.</p>
<p>I had already discussed this sort of socialism under the guidance of</p>
<p>Britten, before I went up to Cambridge. It was all mixed up with</p>
<p>ideas about freedom and natural <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_898">virtue</a> and a great scorn for kings,</p>
<p>titles, wealth and officials, and it was symbolised by the red ties</p>
<p>we wore. Our simple verdict on <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_899">existing</a> arrangements was that they</p>
<p>were "all wrong." The rich were robbers and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_900">knew</a> it, kings and</p>
<p>princes were usurpers and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_900">knew</a> it, religious teachers were impostors</p>
<p>in league with power, the economic system was an elaborate plot on</p>
<p>the part of the few to expropriate the many. We went about <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_901">feeling</a></p>
<p>scornful of all the current <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_902">forms</a> of life, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_902">forms</a> that esteemed</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_903">themselves</a> solid, that were, we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_900">knew</a>, no more than shapes painted on</p>
<p>a curtain that was presently to be torn aside…</p>
<p>It was Hatherleigh's poster and his capacity for overstating things,</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_904">think</a>, that first qualified my simple revolutionary enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Perhaps also I had met with Fabian publications, but if I did I</p>
<p>forget the circumstances. And no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_905">doubt</a> my innate constructiveness</p>
<p>with its practical corollary of an analytical treatment of the</p>
<p>material supplied, was bound to push me on beyond this melodramatic</p>
<p>interpretation of human affairs.</p>
<p>I compared that Working Man of the poster with any sort of working</p>
<p>man I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_906">knew</a>. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_907">perceived</a> that the latter was not going to change,</p>
<p>and indeed could not under any stimulus whatever be expected to</p>
<p>change, into the former. It crept into my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_908">mind</a> as slowly and surely</p>
<p>as the dawn creeps into a room that the former was not, as I had at</p>
<p>first rather glibly assumed, an "ideal," but a complete</p>
<p>misrepresentation of the quality and possibilities of things.</p>
<p>I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_909">know</a> now whether it was during my school-days or at</p>
<p>Cambridge that I first began not merely to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_910">see</a> the world as a great</p>
<p>contrast of rich and poor, but to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_911">feel</a> the massive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_912">effect</a> of that</p>
<p>multitudinous majority of people who toil <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_913">continually</a>, who are for</p>
<p>ever anxious about ways and means, who are restricted, ill clothed,</p>
<p>ill fed and ill housed, who have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_914">limited</a> outlooks and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_913">continually</a></p>
<p>suffer misadventures, hardships and distresses through the want of</p>
<p>money. My lot had fallen upon the fringe of the possessing</p>
<p>minority; if I did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_909">know</a> the want of necessities I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_915">knew</a></p>
<p>shabbiness, and the world that let me go on to a university</p>
<p>education intimated very plainly that there was not a thing beyond</p>
<p>the primary needs that my stimulated imagination might demand that</p>
<p>it would not be an effort for me to secure. A certain aggressive</p>
<p>radicalism against the ruling and propertied classes followed almost</p>
<p>naturally from my circumstances. It did not at first connect itself</p>
<p>at all with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_916">perception</a> of a planless disorder in human affairs</p>
<p>that had been forced upon me by the atmosphere of my upbringing, nor</p>
<p>did it link me in sympathy with any of the profounder <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_917">realities</a> of</p>
<p>poverty. It was a personal independent thing. The dingier people</p>
<p>one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_918">saw</a> in the back streets and lower quarters of Bromstead and</p>
<p>Penge, the drift of dirty children, ragged old women, street</p>
<p>loafers, grimy workers that made the social background of London,</p>
<p>the stories one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_919">heard</a> of privation and sweating, only joined up very</p>
<p>slowly with the general propositions I was making about life. We</p>
<p>could become splendidly eloquent about the social revolution and the</p>
<p>triumph of the Proletariat after the Class war, and it was only by a</p>
<p>sort of inspiration that it came to me that my bedder, a garrulous</p>
<p>old thing with a dusty black bonnet over one eye and an</p>
<p>ostentatiously clean apron outside the dark mysteries that clothed</p>
<p>her, or the cheeky little ruffians who yelled papers about the</p>
<p>streets, were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_920">really</a> material to such questions.</p>
<p>Directly any of us young socialists of Trinity found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_921">ourselves</a> in</p>
<p>immediate contact with servants or cadgers or gyps or bedders or</p>
<p>plumbers or navvies or cabmen or railway porters we became</p>
<p>unconsciously and unthinkingly aristocrats. Our voices altered, our</p>
<p>gestures altered. We <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_922">behaved</a> just as all the other men, rich or</p>
<p>poor, swatters or sportsmen or Pinky Dinkys, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_922">behaved</a>, and exactly as</p>
<p>we were expected to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_923">behave</a>. On the whole it is a population of poor</p>
<p>quality round about Cambridge, rather stunted and spiritless and</p>
<p>very difficult to idealise. That theoretical Working Man of ours!-</p>
<p>if we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_924">felt</a> the clash at all we explained it, I suppose, by assuming</p>
<p>that he came from another part of the country; Esmeer, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_925">remember</a>,</p>
<p>who lived somewhere in the Fens, was very eloquent about the Cornish</p>
<p>fishermen, and Hatherleigh, who was a Hampshire man, assured us we</p>
<p>ought to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_926">know</a> the Scottish miner. My private fancy was for the</p>
<p>Lancashire operative because of his co-operative societies, and</p>
<p>because what Lancashire <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_927">thinks</a> to-day England <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_927">thinks</a> to-morrow…</p>
<p>And also I had never been in Lancashire.</p>
<p>By little increments of realisation it was that the profounder</p>
<p>verities of the problem of socialism came to me. It <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_928">helped</a> me very</p>
<p>much that I had to go down to the Potteries several times to discuss</p>
<p>my future with my uncle and guardian; I walked about and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_929">saw</a> Bursley</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_930">Wakes</a> and much of the human aspects of organised industrialism at</p>
<p>close quarters for the first time. The picture of a splendid</p>
<p>Working Man cheated out of his innate glorious possibilities, and</p>
<p>presently to arise and dash this scoundrelly and scandalous system</p>
<p>of private ownership to fragments, began to give place to a</p>
<p>limitless spectacle of inefficiency, to a conception of millions of</p>
<p>people not organised as they should be, not educated as they should</p>
<p>be, not simply prevented from but incapable of nearly every sort of</p>
<p>beauty, mostly kindly and well meaning, mostly incompetent, mostly</p>
<p>obstinate, and easily humbugged and easily diverted. Even the</p>
<p>tragic and inspiring idea of Marx, that the poor were nearing a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_931">limit</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_932">painful</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_933">experience</a>, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_934">awakening</a> to a sense of intolerable</p>
<p>wrongs, began to develop into the more appalling conception that the</p>
<p>poor were simply in a witless uncomfortable inconclusive way-</p>
<p>"muddling along"; that they wanted nothing very definitely nor very</p>
<p>urgently, that mean <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_935">fears</a> enslaved them and mean satisfactions</p>
<p>decoyed them, that they took the very gift of life itself with a</p>
<p>spiritless lassitude, hoarding it, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_936">being</a> rather anxious not to lose</p>
<p>it than to use it in any way whatever.</p>
<p>The complete development of that realisation was the work of many</p>
<p>years. I had only the first intimations at Cambridge. But I did</p>
<p>have intimations. Most acutely do I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_937">remember</a> the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_938">doubts</a> that</p>
<p>followed the visit of Chris Robinson. Chris Robinson was heralded</p>
<p>by such heroic anticipations, and he was so entirely what we had not</p>
<p>anticipated.</p>
<p>Hatherleigh got him to come, arranged a sort of meeting for him at</p>
<p>Redmayne's rooms in King's, and was very proud and proprietorial.</p>
<p>It failed to stir Cambridge at all profoundly. Beyond a futile</p>
<p>attempt to screw up Hatherleigh made by some inexpert duffers who</p>
<p>used nails instead of screws and gimlets, there was no attempt to</p>
<p>rag. Next day Chris Robinson went and spoke at Bennett Hall in</p>
<p>Newnham College, and left Cambridge in the evening amidst the cheers</p>
<p>of twenty men or so. Socialism was at such a low ebb politically in</p>
<p>those days that it didn't even rouse men to opposition.</p>
<p>And there sat Chris under that flamboyant and heroic Worker of the</p>
<p>poster, a little wrinkled grey-bearded apologetic man in ready-made</p>
<p>clothes, with watchful innocent brown eyes and a persistent and</p>
<p>invincible air of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_939">being</a> out of his element. He sat with his stout</p>
<p>boots tucked up under his chair, and clung to a teacup and saucer</p>
<p>and looked away from us into the fire, and we all sat about on</p>
<p>tables and chair-arms and windowsills and boxes and anywhere except</p>
<p>upon chairs after the manner of young men. The only other chair</p>
<p>whose seat was occupied was the one containing his knitted woollen</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_940">comforter</a> and his picturesque old beach-photographer's hat. We were</p>
<p>all shy and didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_941">know</a> how to take hold of him now we had got him,</p>
<p>and, which was disconcertingly unanticipated, he was manifestly</p>
<p>having the same difficulty with us. We had expected to be gripped.</p>
<p>"I'll not be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_942">knowing</a> what to say to these Chaps," he repeated with a</p>
<p>north-country quality in his speech.</p>
<p>We made reassuring noises.</p>
<p>The Ambassador of the Workers stirred his tea earnestly through an</p>
<p>uncomfortable pause.</p>
<p>"I'd best tell 'em something of how things are in Lancashire, what</p>
<p>with the new machines and all that," he speculated at last with red</p>
<p>reflections in his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_943">thoughtful</a> eyes.</p>
<p>We had an inexcusable dread that perhaps he would make a mess of the</p>
<p>meeting.</p>
<p>But when he was no longer in the unaccustomed meshes of refined</p>
<p>conversation, but speaking with an audience before him, he became a</p>
<p>different man. He declared he would explain to us just exactly what</p>
<p>socialism was, and went on at once to an impassioned contrast of</p>
<p>social <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_944">conditions</a>. "You young men," he said "come from homes of</p>
<p>luxury; every need you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_945">feel</a> is supplied-"</p>
<p>We sat and stood and sprawled about him, occupying every inch of</p>
<p>Redmayne's floor space except the hearthrug-platform, and we</p>
<p>listened to him and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_946">thought</a> him over. He was the voice of wrongs</p>
<p>that made us indignant and eager. We forgot for a time that he had</p>
<p>been shy and seemed not a little incompetent, his provincial accent</p>
<p>became a beauty of his earnest speech, we were carried away by his</p>
<p>indignations. We looked with shining eyes at one another and at the</p>
<p>various dons who had dropped in and were striving to maintain a</p>
<p>front of judicious severity. We <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_947">felt</a> more and more that social</p>
<p>injustice must <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_948">cease</a>, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_948">cease</a> forthwith. We <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_947">felt</a> we could not</p>
<p>sleep upon it. At the end we clapped and murmured our applause and</p>
<p>wanted badly to cheer.</p>
<p>Then like a lancet stuck into a bladder came the heckling. Denson,</p>
<p>that indolent, liberal-minded sceptic, did most of the questioning.</p>
<p>He lay contorted in a chair, with his ugly head very low, his legs</p>
<p>crossed and his left boot very high, and he pointed his remarks with</p>
<p>a long thin hand and occasionally adjusted the unstable glasses that</p>
<p>hid his watery eyes. "I don't want to carp," he began. "The</p>
<p>present system, I admit, stands condemned. Every present system</p>
<p>always HAS stood condemned in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_949">minds</a> of intelligent men. But</p>
<p>where it seems to me you get thin, is just where everybody has been</p>
<p>thin, and that's when you come to the remedy."</p>
<p>"Socialism," said Chris Robinson, as if it answered everything, and</p>
<p>Hatherleigh said "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_950">Hear</a>! <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_950">Hear</a>!" very resolutely.</p>
<p>"I suppose I OUGHT to take that as an answer," said Denson, getting</p>
<p>his shoulder-blades well down to the seat of his chair; "but I</p>
<p>don't. I don't, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_951">know</a>. It's rather a shame to cross-examine you</p>
<p>after this fine address of yours"-Chris Robinson on the hearthrug</p>
<p>made acquiescent and inviting noises-"but the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_952">real</a> question</p>
<p>remains how exactly are you going to end all these wrongs? There</p>
<p>are the admimstrative questions. If you abolish the private owner,</p>
<p>I admit you abolish a very complex and clumsy way of getting</p>
<p>businesses run, land controlled and things in general administered,</p>
<p>but you don't get rid of the need of administration, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_951">know</a>."</p>
<p>"Democracy," said Chris Robinson.</p>
<p>"Organised somehow," said Denson. "And it's just the How perplexes</p>
<p>me. I can quite easily imagine a socialist <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_953">state</a> administered in a</p>
<p>sort of scrambling tumult that would be worse than anything we have</p>
<p>got now.</p>
<p>"Nothing could be worse than things are now," said Chris Robinson.</p>
<p>"I have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_954">seen</a> little children-"</p>
<p>"I submit life on an ill-provisioned raft, for example, could easily</p>
<p>be worse-or life in a beleagured town."</p>
<p>Murmurs.</p>
<p>They wrangled for some time, and it had the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_955">effect</a> upon me of coming</p>
<p>out from the glow of a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_956">good</a> matinee performance into the cold</p>
<p>daylight of late afternoon. Chris Robinson did not shine in</p>
<p>conflict with Denson; he was an orator and not a dialectician, and</p>
<p>he missed Denson's points and displayed a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_957">disposition</a> to plunge into</p>
<p>untimely pathos and indignation. And Denson hit me curiously hard</p>
<p>with one of his shafts. "Suppose," he said, "you found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_958">yourself</a></p>
<p>prime minister-"</p>
<p>I looked at Chris Robinson, bright-eyed and his hair a little</p>
<p>ruffled and his whole <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_959">being</a> rhetorical, and measured him against the</p>
<p>huge machine of government muddled and mysterious. Oh! but I was</p>
<p>perplexed!</p>
<p>And then we took him back to Hatherleigh's rooms and drank beer and</p>
<p>smoked about him while he nursed his knee with hairy wristed hands</p>
<p>that protruded from his flannel shirt, and drank lemonade under the</p>
<p>cartoon of that emancipated Worker, and we had a great discursive</p>
<p>talk with him.</p>
<p>"Eh! you should <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_960">see</a> our big meetings up north?" he said.</p>
<p>Denson had ruffled him and worried him a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_961">good</a> deal, and ever and</p>
<p>again he came back to that discussion. "It's all very easy for your</p>
<p>learned men to sit and pick holes," he said, "while the children</p>
<p>suffer and die. They don't pick holes up north. They mean</p>
<p>business."</p>
<p>He talked, and that was the most interesting part of it all, of his</p>
<p>going to work in a factory when he was twelve-" when you Chaps were</p>
<p>all with your mammies "-and how he had educated <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_962">himself</a> of nights</p>
<p>until he would fall asleep at his reading.</p>
<p>"It's made many of us keen for all our lives," he remarked, "all</p>
<p>that clemming for education. Why! I longed all through one winter</p>
<p>to read a bit of Darwin. I must <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_963">know</a> about this Darwin if I die for</p>
<p>it, I said. And I couldno' get the book."</p>
<p>Hatherleigh made an enthusiastic noise and drank beer at him with</p>
<p>round eyes over the mug.</p>
<p>"Well, anyhow I wasted no time on Greek and Latin," said Chris</p>
<p>Robinson. "And one learns to go straight at a thing without</p>
<p>splitting straws. One gets hold of the Elementals."</p>
<p>(Well, did they? That was the gist of my perplexity.)</p>
<p>"One doesn't quibble," he said, returning to his rankling <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_964">memory</a> of</p>
<p>Denson, "while men decay and starve."</p>
<p>"But suppose," I said, suddenly dropping into opposition, "the</p>
<p>alternatve is to risk a worse disaster-or do something patently</p>
<p>futile."</p>
<p>"I don't follow that," said Chris Robinson. "We don't propose</p>
<p>anything futile, so far as I can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_965">see</a>."</p>

</title>
<p>The prevailing force in my undergraduate days was not Socialism but</p>
<p>Kiplingism. Our set was quite exceptional in its socialistic</p>
<p>professions. And we were all, you must <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_966">understand</a>, very distinctly</p>
<p>Imperialists also, and professed a vivid sense of the "White Man's</p>
<p>Burden."</p>
<p>It is a little difficult now to get back to the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_967">feelings</a> of that</p>
<p>period; Kipling has since been so mercilessly and exhaustively</p>
<p>mocked, criticised and torn to shreds;-never was a man so violently</p>
<p>exalted and then, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_968">himself</a> assisting, so relentlessly called down.</p>
<p>But in the middle nineties this spectacled and moustached little</p>
<p>figure with its heavy chin and its general <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_969">effect</a> of vehement</p>
<p>gesticulation, its wild shouts of boyish enthusiasm for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_970">effective</a></p>
<p>force, its lyric delight in the sounds and colours, in the very</p>
<p>odours of empire, its wonderful discovery of machinery and cotton</p>
<p>waste and the under officer and the engineer, and "shop" as a poetic</p>
<p>dialect, became almost a national symbol. He got hold of us</p>
<p>wonderfully, he filled us with tinkling and haunting quotations, he</p>
<p>stirred Britten and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_971">myself</a> to futile imitations, he coloured the</p>
<p>very idiom of our conversation. He rose to his climax with his</p>
<p>"Recessional," while I was still an undergraduate.</p>
<p>What did he give me exactly?</p>
<p>He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_972">helped</a> to broaden my geographical sense immensely, and he</p>
<p>provided phrases for just that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_973">desire</a> for discipline and devotion</p>
<p>and organised effort the Socialism of our time failed to express,</p>
<p>that the current socialist movement still fails, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_974">think</a>, to</p>
<p>express. The sort of thing that follows, for example, tore</p>
<p>something out of my inmost nature and gave it a shape, and I took it</p>
<p>back from him shaped and let much of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_975">rest</a> of him, the tumult and</p>
<p>the bullying, the hysteria and the impatience, the incoherence and</p>
<p>inconsistency, go uncriticised for the sake of it:-</p>
<p>"Keep ye the Law-be swift in all obedience-</p>
<p>Clear the land of evil, drive the road and bridge the ford,</p>
<p>Make ye sure to each his own</p>
<p>That he reap where he hath sown;</p>
<p>By the peace among Our peoples let men <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_976">know</a> we serve the Lord!"</p>
<p>And then again, and for all our later criticism, this sticks in my</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_977">mind</a>, sticks there now as quintessential <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_978">wisdom</a>:</p>
<p>The 'eathen in 'is blindness bows down to wood an' stone;</p>
<p>'E don't obey no orders unless they is 'is own;</p>
<p>'E keeps 'is side-arms awful: 'e leaves 'em all about</p>
<p>An' then comes up the regiment an' pokes the 'eathen out.</p>
<p>All along o' dirtiness, all along o' mess,</p>
<p>All along o' doin' things rather-more-or-less,</p>
<p>All along of abby-nay, kul, an' hazar-ho,</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_979">Mind</a> you keep your rifle an' <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_980">yourself</a> jus' so!"</p>
<p>It is after all a secondary matter that Kipling, not having been</p>
<p>born and brought up in Bromstead and Penge, and the war in South</p>
<p>Africa <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_981">being</a> yet in the womb of time, could quite honestly entertain</p>
<p>the now remarkable delusion that England had her side-arms at that</p>
<p>time kept anything but "awful." He learnt better, and we all learnt</p>
<p>with him in the dark years of exasperating and humiliating struggle</p>
<p>that followed, and I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_982">see</a> that we fellow learners are</p>
<p>justified in turning resentfully upon him for a common ignorance and</p>
<p>assumption…</p>
<p>South Africa seems always painted on the back cloth of my Cambridge</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_983">memories</a>. How immense those disasters seemed at the time, disasters</p>
<p>our facile English world has long since contrived in any edifying or</p>
<p>profitable sense to forget! How we thrilled to the shouting</p>
<p>newspaper sellers as the first false flush of victory gave place to</p>
<p>the realisation of defeat. Far away there our army showed itself</p>
<p>human, mortal and human in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_984">sight</a> of all the world, the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_985">pleasant</a></p>
<p>officers we had imagined would change to wonderful heroes at the</p>
<p>first crackling of rifles, remained the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_985">pleasant</a>, rather incompetent</p>
<p>men they had always been, failing to imagine, failing to plan and</p>
<p>co-operate, failing to grip. And the common soldiers, too, they</p>
<p>were just what our streets and country-side had made them, no sudden</p>
<p>magic came out of the war bugles for them. Neither splendid nor</p>
<p>disgraceful were they,-just ill-trained and fairly plucky and</p>
<p>wonderfully <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_986">good-tempered</a> men-paying for it. And how it lowered</p>
<p>our vitality all that first winter to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_987">hear</a> of Nicholson's Nek, and</p>
<p>then presently close upon one another, to realise the bloody waste</p>
<p>of Magersfontein, the shattering retreat from Stormberg, Colenso-</p>
<p>Colenso, that blundering battle, with White, as it seemed, in</p>
<p>Ladysmith near the point of surrender! and so through the long</p>
<p>unfolding catalogue of bleak disillusionments, of aching,</p>
<p>unconcealed anxiety lest worse should follow. To advance upon your</p>
<p>enemy singing about his lack of cleanliness and method went out of</p>
<p>fashion altogether! The dirty retrogressive Boer vanished from our</p>
<p>scheme of illusion.</p>
<p>All through my middle Cambridge period, the guns boomed and the</p>
<p>rifles crackled away there on the veldt, and the horsemen rode and</p>
<p>the tale of accidents and blundering went on. Men, mules, horses,</p>
<p>stores and money poured into South Africa, and the convalescent</p>
<p>wounded streamed home. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_988">see</a> it in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_989">memory</a> as if I had looked at</p>
<p>it through a window instead of through the pages of the illustrated</p>
<p>papers; I recall as if I had been there the wide open spaces, the</p>
<p>ragged hillsides, the open order attacks of helmeted men in khaki,</p>
<p>the scarce visible smoke of the guns, the wrecked trains in great</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_990">lonely</a> places, the burnt isolated farms, and at last the blockhouses</p>
<p>and the fences of barbed wire uncoiling and spreading for endless</p>
<p>miles across the desert, netting the elusive enemy until at last,</p>
<p>though he broke the meshes again and again, we had him in the toils.</p>
<p>If one's attention strayed in the lecture-room it wandered to those</p>
<p>battle-fields.</p>
<p>And that imagined panorama of war unfolds to an accompaniment of</p>
<p>yelling newsboys in the narrow old Cambridge streets, of the flicker</p>
<p>of papers hastily bought and torn open in the twilight, of the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_991">doubtful</a> reception of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_991">doubtful</a> victories, and the insensate</p>
<p>rejoicings at last that seemed to some of us more shameful than</p>
<p>defeats…</p>

<p>A book that stands out among these <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_992">memories</a>, that stimulated me</p>
<p>immensely so that I forced it upon my companions, half in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_993">spirit</a></p>
<p>of propaganda and half to test it by their comments, was Meredith's</p>
<p>ONE OF OUR CONQUERORS. It is one of the books that have made me.</p>
<p>In that I got a supplement and corrective of Kipling. It was the</p>
<p>first <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_994">detached</a> and adverse criticism of the Englishman I had ever</p>
<p>encountered. It must have been published already nine or ten years</p>
<p>when I read it. The country had paid no heed to it, had gone on to</p>
<p>the expensive lessons of the War because of the dull aversion our</p>
<p>people <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_995">feel</a> for all such intimations, and so I could read it as a</p>
<p>book justified. The war endorsed its every word for me, underlined</p>
<p>each warning indication of the gigantic dangers that gathered</p>
<p>against our system across the narrow seas. It discovered Europe to</p>
<p>me, as watching and critical.</p>
<p>But while I could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_996">respond</a> to all its criticisms of my country's</p>
<p>intellectual indolence, of my country's want of training and</p>
<p>discipline and moral courage, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_997">remember</a> that the idea that on the</p>
<p>continent there were other peoples going ahead of us, mentally alert</p>
<p>while we fumbled, disciplined while we slouched, aggressive and</p>
<p>preparing to bring our Imperial pride to a reckoning, was extremely</p>
<p>novel and distasteful to me. It set me worrying of nights. It put</p>
<p>all my projects for social and political reconstruction upon a new</p>
<p>uncomfortable footing. It made them no longer merely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_998">desirable</a> but</p>
<p>urgent. Instead of pride and the love of making one might own to a</p>
<p>baser motive. Under Kipling's sway I had a little forgotten the</p>
<p>continent of Europe, treated it as a mere envious echo to our own</p>
<p>world-wide display. I began now to have a disturbing sense as it</p>
<p>were of busy searchlights over the horizon…</p>
<p>One consequence of the patriotic chagrin Meredith produced in me was</p>
<p>an attempt to belittle his merit. "It isn't a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_999">good</a> novel, anyhow,"</p>
<p>I said.</p>
<p>The charge I brought against it was, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1000">remember</a>, a lack of unity.</p>
<p>It professed to be a study of the English situation in the early</p>
<p>nineties, but it was all deflected, I said, and all the interest was</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1001">confused</a> by the story of Victor Radnor's fight with society to</p>
<p>vindicate the woman he had loved and never married. Now in the</p>
<p>retrospect and with a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1002">mind</a> full of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1003">bitter</a> enlightenment, I can do</p>
<p>Meredith justice, and admit the conflict was not only essential but</p>
<p>cardinal in his picture, that the terrible inflexibility of the rich</p>
<p>aunts and the still more terrible claim of Mrs. Burman Radnor, the</p>
<p>"infernal punctilio," and Dudley Sowerby's limitations, were the</p>
<p>central substance of that inalertness the book set itself to assail.</p>
<p>So many things have been brought together in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1002">mind</a> that were once</p>
<p>remotely separated. A people that will not valiantly face and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1004">understand</a> and admit love and passion can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1004">understand</a> nothing</p>
<p>whatever. But in those days what is now just obvious <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1005">truth</a> to me</p>
<p>was altogether outside my range of comprehension…</p>

<p>As I seek to recapitulate the interlacing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1006">growth</a> of my apprehension</p>
<p>of the world, as I flounder among the half-remembered developments</p>
<p>that found me a crude schoolboy and left me a man, there comes out,</p>
<p>as if it stood for all the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1007">rest</a>, my first holiday abroad. That did</p>
<p>not happen until I was twenty-two. I was a fellow of Trinity, and</p>
<p>the Peace of Vereeniging had just been signed.</p>
<p>I went with a man named Willersley, a man some years senior to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1008">myself</a>, who had just missed a fellowship and the higher division of</p>
<p>the Civil Service, and who had become an enthusiastic member of the</p>
<p>London School Board, upon which the cumulative vote and the support</p>
<p>of the "advanced" people had placed him. He had, like <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1008">myself</a>, a</p>
<p>small independent income that relieved him of any necessity to earn</p>
<p>a living, and he had a kindred craving for social theorising and</p>
<p>some <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1009">form</a> of social service. He had sought my acquaintance after</p>
<p>reading a paper of mine (begotten by the visit of Chris Robinson) on</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1010">limits</a> of pure democracy. It had marched with some <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1011">thoughts</a> of</p>
<p>his own.</p>
<p>We went by train to Spiez on the Lake of Thun, then up the Gemmi,</p>
<p>and thence with one or two halts and digressions and a little modest</p>
<p>climbing we crossed over by the Antrona pass (on which we were</p>
<p>benighted) into Italy, and by way of Domo D'ossola and the Santa</p>
<p>Maria Maggiore valley to Cannobio, and thence up the lake to Locarno</p>
<p>(where, as I shall tell, we stayed some eventful days) and so up the</p>
<p>Val Maggia and over to Airolo and home.</p>
<p>As I write of that long tramp of ours, something of its freshness</p>
<p>and enlargement returns to me. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1012">feel</a> again the faint <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1013">pleasant</a></p>
<p>excitement of the boat train, the trampling procession of people</p>
<p>with hand baggage and laden porters along the platform of the</p>
<p>Folkestone pier, the scarcely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1014">perceptible</a> swaying of the moored boat</p>
<p>beneath our feet. Then, very obvious and simple, the little <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1015">emotion</a></p>
<p>of standing out from the homeland and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1016">seeing</a> the long white Kentish</p>
<p>cliffs recede. One walked about the boat doing one's best not to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1012">feel</a> absurdly adventurous, and presently a movement of people</p>
<p>directed one's attention to a white lighthouse on a cliff to the</p>
<p>east of us, coming up suddenly; and then one turned to scan the</p>
<p>little different French coast villages, and then, sliding by in a</p>
<p>pale sunshine came a long wooden pier with oddly dressed children</p>
<p>upon it, and the clustering town of Boulogne.</p>
<p>One took it all with the outward calm that became a young man of</p>
<p>nearly three and twenty, but one was alive to one's finger-tips with</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1017">pleasing</a> little stimulations. The custom house examination excited</p>
<p>one, the strangeness of a babble in a foreign tongue; one found the</p>
<p>French of City Merchants' and Cambridge a shy and viscous flow, and</p>
<p>then one was standing in the train as it went slowly through the</p>
<p>rail-laid street to Boulogne Ville, and one looked out at the world</p>
<p>in French, porters in blouses, workmen in enormous purple trousers,</p>
<p>police officers in peaked caps instead of helmets and romantically</p>
<p>cloaked, big carts, all on two wheels instead of four, green</p>
<p>shuttered casements instead of sash windows, and great numbers of</p>
<p>neatly dressed women in economical mourning.</p>
<p>"Oh! there's a priest!" one said, and was betrayed into suchlike</p>
<p>artless cries.</p>
<p>It was a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1018">real</a> other world, with different government and different</p>
<p>methods, and in the night one was roused from uneasy slumbers and</p>
<p>sat blinking and surly, wrapped up in one's couverture and with</p>
<p>one's oreiller all awry, to encounter a new social phenomenon, the</p>
<p>German official, so different in manner from the British; and when</p>
<p>one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1019">woke</a> again after that one had come to Bale, and out one tumbled</p>
<p>to get coffee in Switzerland…</p>
<p>I have been over that route dozens of times since, but it still</p>
<p>revives a certain lingering youthfulness, a certain sense of</p>
<p>cheerful release in me.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1020">remember</a> that I and Willersley became very sociological as we ran</p>
<p>on to Spiez, and made all sorts of generalisations from the steeply</p>
<p>sloping fields on the hillsides, and from the people we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1021">saw</a> on</p>
<p>platforms and from little differences in the way things were done.</p>
<p>The clean prosperity of Bale and Switzerland, the big clean</p>
<p>stations, filled me with patriotic misgivings, as I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1022">thought</a> of the</p>
<p>vast dirtiness of London, the mean dirtiness of Cambridgeshire. It</p>
<p>came to me that perhaps my scheme of international values was all</p>
<p>wrong, that quite stupendous possibilities and challenges for us and</p>
<p>our empire might be developing here-and I recalled Meredith's</p>
<p>Skepsey in France with a new <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1023">understanding</a>.</p>
<p>Willersley had dressed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1024">himself</a> in a world-worn Norfolk suit of</p>
<p>greenish grey tweeds that ended unfamiliarly at his rather</p>
<p>impending, spectacled, intellectual visage. I didn't, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1025">remember</a>,</p>
<p>like the contrast of him with the drilled Swiss and Germans about</p>
<p>us. Convict coloured stockings and vast hobnail boots finished him</p>
<p>below, and all his luggage was a borrowed rucksac that he had tied</p>
<p>askew. He did not want to shave in the train, but I made him at one</p>
<p>of the Swiss stations-I dislike these Oxford slovenlinesses-and</p>
<p>then confound him! he cut <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1024">himself</a> and bled…</p>
<p>Next morning we were breathing a thin exhilarating air that seemed</p>
<p>to have washed our very veins to an incredible cleanliness, and</p>
<p>eating hard-boiled eggs in a vast clear space of rime-edged rocks,</p>
<p>snow-mottled, above a blue-gashed glacier. All about us the</p>
<p>monstrous rock surfaces rose towards the shining peaks above, and</p>
<p>there were winding moraines from which the ice had receded, and then</p>
<p>dark clustering fir trees far below.</p>
<p>I had an extraordinary <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1026">feeling</a> of having come out of things, of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1027">being</a> outside.</p>
<p>"But this is the round world!" I said, with a sense of never having</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1028">perceived</a> it before; "this is the round world!"</p>

<p>That holiday was full of big comprehensive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1029">effects</a>; the first view</p>
<p>of the Rhone valley and the distant Valaisian Alps, for example,</p>
<p>which we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1030">saw</a> from the shoulder of the mountain above the Gemmi, and</p>
<p>the early summer dawn breaking over Italy as we moved from our</p>
<p>night's crouching and munched bread and chocolate and stretched our</p>
<p>stiff limbs among the tumbled and precipitous rocks that hung over</p>
<p>Lake Cingolo, and surveyed the winding tiring rocky track going down</p>
<p>and down to Antronapiano.</p>
<p>And our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1031">thoughts</a> were as comprehensive as our impressions.</p>
<p>Willersley's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1032">mind</a> abounded in historical matter; he had an</p>
<p>inaccurate abundant habit of topographical reference; he made me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1033">see</a></p>
<p>and trace and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1033">see</a> again the Roman Empire sweep up these winding</p>
<p>valleys, and the coming of the first great Peace among the warring</p>
<p>tribes of men…</p>
<p>In the retrospect each of us seems to have been talking about our</p>
<p>outlook almost <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1034">continually</a>. Each of us, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1035">see</a>, was full of the</p>
<p>same question, very near and altogether predominant to us, the</p>
<p>question: "What am I going to do with my life?" He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1036">saw</a> it almost as</p>
<p>importantly as I, but from a different angle, because his choice was</p>
<p>largely made and mine still hung in the balance.</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1037">feel</a> we might do so many things," I said, "and everything that</p>
<p>calls one, calls one away from something else."</p>
<p>Willersley agreed without any modest disavowals.</p>
<p>"We have got to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1038">think</a> out," he said, "just what we are and what we</p>
<p>are up to. We've got to do that now. And then-it's one of those</p>
<p>questions it is inadvisable to reopen subsequently."</p>
<p>He beamed at me through his glasses. The sententious use of long</p>
<p>words was a playful habit with him, that and a slight deliberate</p>
<p>humour, habits occasional Extension Lecturing was doing very much to</p>
<p>intensify.</p>
<p>"You've made your decision?"</p>
<p>He nodded with a peculiar forward movement of his head.</p>
<p>"How would you put it?"</p>
<p>"Social Service-education. Whatever else matters or doesn't</p>
<p>matter, it seems to me there is one thing we MUST have and increase,</p>
<p>and that is the number of people who can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1039">think</a> a little-and have "-</p>
<p>he beamed again-" an adequate sense of causation."</p>
<p>"You're sure it's worth while."</p>
<p>"For me-certainly. I don't discuss that any more."</p>
<p>"I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1040">limit</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1041">myself</a> too narrowly," he added. "After all, the work</p>
<p>is all one. We who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1042">know</a>, we who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1043">feel</a>, are building the great modern</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1044">state</a>, joining wall to wall and way to way, the new great England</p>
<p>rising out of the decaying old… we are the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1045">real</a> statesmen-I</p>
<p>like that use of 'statesmen.'…"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said with many <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1046">doubts</a>. "Yes, of course…"</p>
<p>Willersley is middle-aged now, with silver in his hair and a</p>
<p>deepening <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1047">benevolence</a> in his always amiable face, and he has very</p>
<p>fairly kept his word. He has lived for social service and to do</p>
<p>vast masses of useful, undistinguished, fertilising work. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1048">Think</a> of</p>
<p>the days of arid administrative plodding and of contention still</p>
<p>more arid and unrewarded, that he must have spent! His little</p>
<p>affectations of gesture and manner, imitative affectations for the</p>
<p>most part, have increased, and the humorous beam and the humorous</p>
<p>intonations have become a thing he puts on every morning like an old</p>
<p>coat. His devotion is mingled with a considerable whimsicality, and</p>
<p>they say he is easily flattered by subordinates and easily offended</p>
<p>into opposition by colleagues; he has made mistakes at times and</p>
<p>followed wrong courses, still there he is, a flat contradiction to</p>
<p>all the ordinary doctrine of motives, a man who has foregone any</p>
<p>chances of wealth and profit, foregone any easier paths to</p>
<p>distinction, foregone marriage and parentage, in order to serve the</p>
<p>community. He does it without any fee or reward except his personal</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1049">self-satisfaction</a> in doing this work, and he does it without any</p>
<p>hope of future <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1050">joys</a> and punishments, for he is an implacable</p>
<p>Rationalist. No <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1051">doubt</a> he idealises <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1052">himself</a> a little, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1053">dreams</a> of</p>
<p>recognition. No <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1051">doubt</a> he gets his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1054">pleasure</a> from a sense of power,</p>
<p>from the spending and husbanding of large sums of public money, and</p>
<p>from the inevitable proprietorship he must <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1055">feel</a> in the fair, fine,</p>
<p>well-ordered schools he has done so much to develop. "But for me,"</p>
<p>he can say, "there would have been a Job about those diagrams, and</p>
<p>that subject or this would have been less ably taught."…</p>
<p>The fact remains that for him the rewards have been adequate, if not</p>
<p>to content at any rate to keep him working. Of course he covets the</p>
<p>notice of the world he has served, as a lover covets the notice of</p>
<p>his mistress. Of course he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1056">thinks</a> somewhere, somewhen, he will get</p>
<p>credit. Only last year I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1057">heard</a> some men talking of him, and they</p>
<p>were noting, with little mean smiles, how he had shown <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1058">himself</a> self-</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1059">conscious</a> while there was talk of some honorary degree-giving or</p>
<p>other; it would, I have no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1060">doubt</a>, please him greatly if his work</p>
<p>were to flower into a crimson gown in some Academic parterre. Why</p>
<p>shouldn't it? But that is incidental vanity at the worst; he goes</p>
<p>on anyhow. Most men don't.</p>
<p>But we had our walk twenty years and more ago now. He was oldish</p>
<p>even then as a young man, just as he is oldish still in middle age.</p>
<p>Long may his industrious elderliness flourish for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1061">good</a> of the</p>
<p>world! He lectured a little in conversation then; he lectures more</p>
<p>now and listens less, toilsomely disentangling what you already</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1062">understand</a>, giving you in detail the data you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1063">know</a>; these are things</p>
<p>like callosities that come from a man's work.</p>
<p>Our long three weeks' talk comes back to me as a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1064">memory</a> of ideas and</p>
<p>determinations slowly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1065">growing</a>, all mixed up with a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1066">smell</a> of wood</p>
<p>smoke and pine woods and huge precipices and remote gleams of snow-</p>
<p>fields and the sound of cascading torrents rushing through deep</p>
<p>gorges far below. It is mixed, too, with gossips with waitresses</p>
<p>and fellow travellers, with my first essays in colloquial German and</p>
<p>Italian, with disputes about the way to take, and other things that</p>
<p>I will tell of in another section. But the white passion of human</p>
<p>service was our dominant theme. Not simply perhaps nor altogether</p>
<p>unselfishly, but quite honestly, and with at least a frequent self-</p>
<p>forgetfulness, did we want to do fine and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1067">noble</a> things, to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1068">help</a> in</p>
<p>their developing, to lessen misery, to broaden and exalt life. It</p>
<p>is very hard-perhaps it is impossible-to present in a page or two</p>
<p>the substance and quality of nearly a month's conversation,</p>
<p>conversation that is casual and discursive in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1069">form</a>, that ranges</p>
<p>carelessly from triviality to immensity, and yet is constantly</p>
<p>resuming a constructive process, as workmen on a wall loiter and</p>
<p>jest and go and come back, and all the while build.</p>
<p>We got it more and more definite that the core of our purpose</p>
<p>beneath all its varied aspects must needs be order and discipline.</p>
<p>"Muddle," said I, "is the enemy." That remains my belief to this</p>
<p>day. Clearness and order, light and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1070">foresight</a>, these things I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1071">know</a></p>
<p>for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1072">Good</a>. It was muddle had just given us all the still freshly</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1073">painful</a> disasters and humiliations of the war, muddle that gives us</p>
<p>the visibly sprawling disorder of our cities and industrial country-</p>
<p>side, muddle that gives us the waste of life, the limitations,</p>
<p>wretchedness and unemployment of the poor. Muddle! I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1074">remember</a></p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1075">myself</a> quoting Kipling-</p>
<p>"All along o' dirtiness, all along o' mess,</p>
<p>All along o' doin' things rather-more-or-less."</p>
<p>"We build the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1076">state</a>," we said over and over again. "That is what we</p>
<p>are for-servants of the new reorganisation!"</p>
<p>We planned half in earnest and half Utopianising, a League of Social</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>We talked of the splendid world of men that might <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1077">grow</a> out of such</p>
<p>unpaid and ill-paid work as we were setting our faces to do. We</p>
<p>spoke of the intricate difficulties, the monstrous <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1078">passive</a></p>
<p>resistances, the hostilities to such a development as we conceived</p>
<p>our work subserved, and we spoke with that underlying confidence in</p>
<p>the invincibility of the causes we adopted that is natural to young</p>
<p>and scarcely tried men.</p>
<p>We talked much of the detailed life of politics so far as it was</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1079">known</a> to us, and there Willersley was more <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1080">experienced</a> and far</p>
<p>better informed than I; we discussed possible combinations and</p>
<p>possible developments, and the chances of some great constructive</p>
<p>movement coming from the heart-searchings the Boer war had</p>
<p>occasioned. We would sink to gossip-even at the Suetonius level.</p>
<p>Willersley would decline towards illuminating anecdotes that I</p>
<p>capped more or less loosely from my private reading. We were</p>
<p>particularly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1081">wise</a>, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1082">remember</a>, upon the management of newspapers,</p>
<p>because about that we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1083">knew</a> nothing whatever. We <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1084">perceived</a> that</p>
<p>great things were to be done through newspapers. We talked of</p>
<p>swaying opinion and moving great classes to massive action.</p>
<p>Men are egotistical even in devotion. All our splendid projects</p>
<p>were thickset with the first personal pronoun. We both could write,</p>
<p>and all that we said in general terms was reflected in the</p>
<p>particular in our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1085">minds</a>; it was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1086">ourselves</a> we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1087">saw</a>, and no others,</p>
<p>writing and speaking that moving word. We had already produced</p>
<p>manuscript and passed the initiations of proof reading; I had been a</p>
<p>frequent speaker in the Union, and Willersley was an active man on</p>
<p>the School Board. Our feet were already on the lower rungs that led</p>
<p>up and up. He was six and twenty, and I twenty-two. We intimated</p>
<p>our individual careers in terms of bold expectation. I had</p>
<p>prophetic glimpses of walls and hoardings clamorous with "Vote for</p>
<p>Remington," and Willersley no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1088">doubt</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1087">saw</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1089">himself</a> chairman of this</p>
<p>committee and that, saying a few slightly ironical words after the</p>
<p>declaration of the poll, and then sitting friendly beside me on the</p>
<p>government benches. There was nothing impossible in such <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1090">dreams</a>.</p>
<p>Why not the Board of Education for him? My preference at that time</p>
<p>wavered between the Local Government Board-I had great ideas about</p>
<p>town-planning, about revisions of municipal areas and re-organised</p>
<p>internal transit-and the War Office. I swayed strongly towards the</p>
<p>latter as the journey progressed. My educational bias came later.</p>
<p>The swelling ambitions that have tramped over Alpine passes! How</p>
<p>many of them, like mine, have come almost within <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1091">sight</a> of</p>
<p>realisation before they failed?</p>
<p>There were times when we posed like young gods (of unassuming</p>
<p>exterior), and times when we were full of the absurdest little</p>
<p>solicitudes about our prospects. There were times when one surveyed</p>
<p>the whole world of men as if it was a little thing at one's feet,</p>
<p>and by way of contrast I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1092">remember</a> once lying in bed-it must have</p>
<p>been during this holiday, though I cannot for the life of me fix</p>
<p>where-and speculating whether perhaps some day I might not be a</p>
<p>K. C. B., Sir Richard Remington, K. C. B., M. P.</p>
<p>But the big style prevailed…</p>
<p>We could not tell from minute to minute whether we were planning for</p>
<p>a world of solid <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1093">reality</a>, or telling <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1094">ourselves</a> fairy tales about</p>
<p>this prospect of life. So much seemed possible, and everything we</p>
<p>could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1095">think</a> of so improbable. There were lapses when it seemed to</p>
<p>me I could never be anything but just the entirely unimportant and</p>
<p>undistinguished young man I was for ever and ever. I couldn't even</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1095">think</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1096">myself</a> as five and thirty.</p>
<p>Once I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1097">remember</a> Willersley going over a list of failures, and why</p>
<p>they had failed-but young men in the twenties do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1098">know</a> much</p>
<p>about failures.</p>

<p>Willersley and I professed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1099">ourselves</a> Socialists, but by this time I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1100">knew</a> my Rodbertus as well as my Marx, and there was much in our</p>
<p>socialism that would have shocked Chris Robinson as much as anything</p>
<p>in life could have shocked him. Socialism as a simple democratic</p>
<p>cry we had done with for ever. We were socialists because</p>
<p>Individualism for us meant muddle, meant a crowd of separated,</p>
<p>undisciplined little people all obstinately and ignorantly doing</p>
<p>things jarringly, each one in his own way. "Each," I said quoting</p>
<p>words of my father's that rose apt in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1101">memory</a>, "snarling from his</p>
<p>own little bit of property, like a dog tied to a cart's tail."</p>
<p>"Essentially," said Willersley, "essentially we're for conscription,</p>
<p>in peace and war alike. The man who owns property is a public</p>
<p>official and has to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1102">behave</a> as such. That's the gist of socialism as</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1103">understand</a> it."</p>
<p>"Or be dismissed from his post," I said, " and replaced by some</p>
<p>better sort of official. A man's none the less an official because</p>
<p>he's irresponsible. What he does with his property affects people</p>
<p>just the same. Private! No one is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1104">really</a> private but an outlaw…</p>
<p>Order and devotion were the very essence of our socialism, and a</p>
<p>splendid collective vigour and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1105">happiness</a> its end. We projected an</p>
<p>ideal <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1106">state</a>, an organised <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1106">state</a> as confident and powerful as modern</p>
<p>science, as balanced and beautiful as a body, as beneficent as</p>
<p>sunshine, the organised <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1106">state</a> that should end muddle for ever; it</p>
<p>ruled all our ideals and gave <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1107">form</a> to all our ambitions.</p>
<p>Every man was to be definitely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1108">related</a> to that, to have his</p>
<p>predominant duty to that. Such was the England renewed we had in</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1109">mind</a>, and how to serve that end, to subdue undisciplined worker and</p>
<p>undisciplined wealth to it, and make the Scientific Commonweal,</p>
<p>King, was the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1110">continuing</a> substance of our intercourse.</p>

<p>Every day the wine of the mountains was stronger in our blood, and</p>
<p>the flush of our youth deeper. We would go in the morning sunlight</p>
<p>along some narrow Alpine mule-path shouting large suggestions for</p>
<p>national re-organisation, and weighing considerations as lightly as</p>
<p>though the world was wax in our hands. "Great England," we said in</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1111">effect</a>, over and over again, "and we will be among the makers!</p>
<p>England renewed! The country has been warned; it has learnt its</p>
<p>lesson. The disasters and anxieties of the war have sunk in.</p>
<p>England has become serious… Oh! there are big things before</p>
<p>us to do; big enduring things!"</p>
<p>One evening we walked up to the loggia of a little pilgrimage</p>
<p>church, I forget its name, that stands out on a conical hill at the</p>
<p>head of a winding stair above the town of Locarno. Down below the</p>
<p>houses clustered amidst a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1112">confusion</a> of heat-bitten greenery. I had</p>
<p>been sitting silently on the parapet, looking across to the purple</p>
<p>mountain masses where Switzerland passes into Italy, and the drift</p>
<p>of our talk seemed suddenly to gather to a head.</p>
<p>I broke into speech, giving <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1113">form</a> to the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1114">thoughts</a> that had been</p>
<p>accumulating. My words have long since passed out of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1115">memory</a>, the</p>
<p>phrases of familiar expression have altered for me, but the</p>
<p>substance remains as clear as ever. I said how we were in our</p>
<p>measure emperors and kings, men undriven, free to do as we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1116">pleased</a></p>
<p>with life; we classed among the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1117">happy</a> ones, our bread and common</p>
<p>necessities were given us for nothing, we had abilities,-it wasn't</p>
<p>modesty but cowardice to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1118">behave</a> as if we hadn't-and Fortune watched</p>
<p>us to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1119">see</a> what we might do with opportunity and the world.</p>
<p>"There are so many things to do, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1120">see</a>," began Willersley, in his</p>
<p>judicial lecturer's voice.</p>
<p>"So many things we may do," I interrupted, "with all these years</p>
<p>before us… We're exceptional men. It's our place, our duty,</p>
<p>to do things."</p>
<p>"Here anyhow," I said, answering the faint amusement of his face;</p>
<p>"I've got no modesty. Everything conspires to set me up. Why</p>
<p>should I run about like all those grubby little beasts down there,</p>
<p>seeking nothing but mean little vanities and indulgencies-and then</p>
<p>take credit for modesty? I KNOW <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1121">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1122">am</a> capable. I KNOW I have</p>
<p>imagination. Modesty! I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1123">know</a> if I don't attempt the very biggest</p>
<p>things in life <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1121">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1122">am</a> a damned shirk. The very biggest! Somebody has</p>
<p>to attempt them. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1124">feel</a> like a loaded gun that is only a little</p>
<p>perplexed because it has to find out just where to aim itself…"</p>
<p>The lake and the frontier villages, a white puff of steam on the</p>
<p>distant railway to Luino, the busy boats and steamers trailing</p>
<p>triangular <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1125">wakes</a> of foam, the long vista eastward towards</p>
<p>battlemented Bellinzona, the vast mountain distances, now tinged</p>
<p>with sunset light, behind this nearer landscape, and the southward</p>
<p>waters with remote coast towns shining dimly, waters that merged at</p>
<p>last in a luminous golden haze, made a broad panoramic spectacle.</p>
<p>It was as if one surveyed the world,-and it was like the games I</p>
<p>used to set out upon my nursery floor. I was exalted by it; I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1126">felt</a></p>
<p>larger than men. So kings should <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1126">feel</a>.</p>
<p>That sense of largness came to me then, and it has come to me since,</p>
<p>again and again, a splendid intimation or a splendid vanity. Once,</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1127">remember</a>, when I looked at Genoa from the mountain crest behind</p>
<p>the town and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1128">saw</a> that multitudinous place in all its beauty of width</p>
<p>and abundance and clustering human effort, and once as I was</p>
<p>steaming past the brown low hills of Staten Island towards the</p>
<p>towering vigour and clamorous vitality of New York City, that mood</p>
<p>rose to its quintessence. And once it came to me, as I shall tell,</p>
<p>on Dover cliffs. And a hundred times when I have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1129">thought</a> of England</p>
<p>as our country might be, with no wretched poor, no wretched rich, a</p>
<p>nation armed and ordered, trained and purposeful amidst its vales</p>
<p>and rivers, that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1130">emotion</a> of collective ends and collective purposes</p>
<p>has returned to me. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1131">felt</a> as great as humanity. For a brief</p>
<p>moment I was humanity, looking at the world I had made and had still</p>
<p>to make…</p>

<p>12</p>
</title>
<p>And mingled with these <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1132">dreams</a> of power and patriotic service there</p>
<p>was another series of a different quality and a different colour,</p>
<p>like the antagonistic colour of a shot silk. The white life and the</p>
<p>red life, contrasted and interchanged, passing swiftly at a turn</p>
<p>from one to another, and refusing ever to mingle peacefully one with</p>
<p>the other. I was asking <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1133">myself</a> openly and distinctly: what are you</p>
<p>going to do for the world? What are you going to do with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1134">yourself</a>?</p>
<p>and with an increasing strength and persistence Nature in spite of</p>
<p>my averted attention was asking me in penetrating undertones: what</p>
<p>are you going to do about this other fundamental matter, the beauty</p>
<p>of girls and women and your <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1135">desire</a> for them?</p>
<p>I have told of my sisterless youth and the narrow circumstances of</p>
<p>my upbringing. It made all women-kind mysterious to me. If it had</p>
<p>not been for my Staffordshire cousins I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1136">think</a> I should have</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1137">known</a> any girls at all until I was twenty. Of Staffordshire I will</p>
<p>tell a little later. But I can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1138">remember</a> still how through all those</p>
<p>ripening years, the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1139">thought</a> of women's beauty, their magic presence</p>
<p>in the world beside me and the unknown, untried reactions of their</p>
<p>intercourse, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1140">grew</a> upon me and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1140">grew</a>, as a strange presence <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1141">grows</a> in a</p>
<p>room when one is occupied by other things. I busied <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1142">myself</a> and</p>
<p>pretended to be wholly occupied, and there the woman stood, full</p>
<p>half of life neglected, and it seemed to my averted <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1143">mind</a> sometimes</p>
<p>that she was there clad and dignified and divine, and sometimes</p>
<p>Aphrodite shining and commanding, and sometimes that Venus who</p>
<p>stoops and allures.</p>
<p>This travel abroad seemed to have released a multitude of things in</p>
<p>my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1144">mind</a>; the clear air, the beauty of the sunshine, the very blue of</p>
<p>the glaciers made me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1145">feel</a> my body and quickened all those</p>
<p>disregarded <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1146">dreams</a>. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1147">saw</a> the sheathed beauty of women's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1148">forms</a> all</p>
<p>about me, in the cheerful waitresses at the inns, in the pedestrians</p>
<p>one encountered in the tracks, in the chance fellow travellers at</p>
<p>the hotel tables. "Confound it!" said I, and talked all the more</p>
<p>zealously of that greater England that was calling us.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1149">remember</a> that we passed two Germans, an old man and a tall fair</p>
<p>girl, father and daughter, who were walking down from Saas. She</p>
<p>came swinging and shining towards us, easy and strong. I worshipped</p>
<p>her as she approached.</p>
<p>"Gut Tag!" said Willersley, removing his hat.</p>
<p>"Morgen!" said the old man, saluting.</p>
<p>I stared stockishly at the girl, who passed with an indifferent</p>
<p>face.</p>
<p>That sticks in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1150">mind</a> as a picture remains in a room, it has kept</p>
<p>there bright and fresh as a thing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1151">seen</a> yesterday, for twenty</p>
<p>years…</p>
<p>I flirted hesitatingly once or twice with comely serving girls, and</p>
<p>was a little ashamed lest Willersley should detect the keen interest</p>
<p>I took in them, and then as we came over the pass from Santa Maria</p>
<p>Maggiore to Cannobio, my secret preoccupation took me by surprise</p>
<p>and flooded me and broke down my pretences.</p>
<p>The women in that valley are very beautiful-women vary from valley</p>
<p>to valley in the Alps and are plain and squat here and divinities</p>
<p>five miles away-and as we came down we passed a group of five or</p>
<p>six of them <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1152">resting</a> by the wayside. Their burthens were beside</p>
<p>them, and one like Ceres held a reaping hook in her brown hand. She</p>
<p>watched us approaching and smiled faintly, her eyes at mine.</p>
<p>There was some greeting, and two of them laughed together.</p>
<p>We passed.</p>
<p>"Glorious girls they were," said Willersley, and suddenly an immense</p>
<p>sense of boredom enveloped me. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1153">saw</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1154">myself</a> striding on down that</p>
<p>winding road, talking of politics and parties and bills of</p>
<p>parliament and all sorts of dessicated things. That road seemed to</p>
<p>me to wind on for ever down to dust and infinite dreariness. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1155">knew</a></p>
<p>it for a way of death. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1156">Reality</a> was behind us.</p>
<p>Willersley set <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1157">himself</a> to draw a sociological moral. "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1158">I'm</a> not so</p>
<p>sure," he said in a voice of intense discriminations, "after all,</p>
<p>that agricultural work isn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1159">good</a> for women."</p>
<p>"Damn agricultural work!" I said, and broke out into a vigorous</p>
<p>cursing of all I held dear. "Fettered things we are!" I cried. "I</p>
<p>wonder why I stand it!"</p>
<p>"Stand what?"</p>
<p>"Why don't I go back and make love to those girls and let the world</p>
<p>and you and everything go hang? Deep breasts and rounded limbs-and</p>
<p>we poor emasculated devils go tramping by with the blood of youth in</p>
<p>us!…"</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1160">I'm</a> not quite sure, Remington," said Willersley, looking at me with</p>
<p>a deliberately quaint expression over his glasses, "that picturesque</p>
<p>scenery is altogether <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1161">good</a> for your morals."</p>
<p>That fever was still in my blood when we came to Locarno.</p>

</title>
<p>Along the hot and dusty lower road between the Orrido of Traffiume</p>
<p>and Cannobio Willersley had developed his first blister. And partly</p>
<p>because of that and partly because there was a bag at the station</p>
<p>that gave us the refreshment of clean linen and partly because of</p>
<p>the lazy lower air into which we had come, we decided upon three or</p>
<p>four days' sojourn in the Empress Hotel.</p>
<p>We dined that night at a table-d'hote, and I found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1162">myself</a> next to an</p>
<p>Englishwoman who began a conversation that was resumed presently in</p>
<p>the hotel lounge. She was a woman of perhaps thirty-three or</p>
<p>thirty-four, slenderly built, with a warm reddish skin and very</p>
<p>abundant fair golden hair, the wife of a petulant-looking heavy-</p>
<p>faced man of perhaps fifty-three, who smoked a cigar and dozed over</p>
<p>his coffee and presently went to bed. "He always goes to bed like</p>
<p>that," she confided startlingly. "He sleeps after all his meals. I</p>
<p>never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1163">knew</a> such a man to sleep."</p>
<p>Then she returned to our talk, whatever it was.</p>
<p>We had begun at the dinner table with itineraries and the usual</p>
<p>topographical talk, and she had envied our pedestrian travel. "My</p>
<p>husband doesn't walk," she said. "His heart is weak and he cannot</p>
<p>manage the hills."</p>
<p>There was something friendly and adventurous in her manner; she</p>
<p>conveyed she liked me, and when presently Willersley drifted off to</p>
<p>write letters our talk sank at once to easy confidential undertones.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1164">felt</a> enterprising, and indeed it is easy to be daring with people</p>
<p>one has never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1165">seen</a> before and may never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1166">see</a> again. I said I loved</p>
<p>beautiful scenery and all beautiful things, and the pointing note in</p>
<p>my voice made her laugh. She told me I had bold eyes, and so far as</p>
<p>I can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1167">remember</a> I said she made them bold. "Blue they are," she</p>
<p>remarked, smiling archly. "I like blue eyes." Then I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1168">think</a> we</p>
<p>compared ages, and she said she was the Woman of Thirty, "George</p>
<p>Moore's Woman of Thirty."</p>
<p>I had not read George Moore at the time, but I pretended to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1169">understand</a>.</p>
<p>That, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1170">think</a>, was our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1171">limit</a> that evening. She went to bed, smiling</p>
<p>good-night quite prettily down the big staircase, and I and</p>
<p>Willersley went out to smoke in the garden. My head was full of</p>
<p>her, and I found it necessary to talk about her. So I made her a</p>
<p>problem in sociology. "Who the deuce are these people?" I said, and</p>
<p>how do they get a living? They seem to have plenty of money. He</p>
<p>strikes me as being-Willersley, what is a drysalter? I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1170">think</a> he's</p>
<p>a retired drysalter."</p>
<p>Willersley theorised while I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1172">thought</a> of the woman and that</p>
<p>provocative quality of dash she had displayed. The next day at</p>
<p>lunch she and I met like old friends. A huge mass of private</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1173">thinking</a> during the interval had been added to our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1174">effect</a> upon one</p>
<p>another. We talked for a time of insignificant things.</p>
<p>"What do you do," she asked rather quickly, "after lunch? Take a</p>
<p>siesta?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes," I said, and hung for a moment eye to eye.</p>
<p>We hadn't a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1175">doubt</a> of each other, but my heart was beating like a</p>
<p>steamer propeller when it lifts out of the water.</p>
<p>"Do you get a view from your room?" she asked after a pause.</p>
<p>"It's on the third floor, Number seventeen, near the staircase. My</p>
<p>friend's next door."</p>
<p>She began to talk of books. She was interested in Christian</p>
<p>Science, she said, and spoke of a book. I forget altogether what</p>
<p>that book was called, though I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1176">remember</a> to this day with the utmost</p>
<p>exactness the purplish magenta of its cover. She said she would</p>
<p>lend it to me and hesitated.</p>
<p>Wlllersley wanted to go for an expedition across the lake that</p>
<p>afternoon, but I refused. He made some other proposals that I</p>
<p>rejected abruptly. " I shall write in my room," I said.</p>
<p>"Why not write down here?"</p>
<p>"I shall write in my room," I snarled like a thwarted animal, and he</p>
<p>looked at me curiously. "Very well," he said; "then I'll make some</p>
<p>notes and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1177">think</a> about that order of ours out under the magnolias."</p>
<p>I hovered about the lounge for a time buying postcards and</p>
<p>feverishly restless, watching the movements of the other people.</p>
<p>Finally I went up to my room and sat down by the windows, staring</p>
<p>out. There came a little tap at the unlocked door and in an</p>
<p>instant, like the go of a taut bowstring, I was up and had it open.</p>
<p>"Here is that book," she said, and we hesitated.</p>
<p>"COME IN!" I whispered, trembling from head to foot.</p>
<p>"You're just a boy," she said in a low tone.</p>
<p>I did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1178">feel</a> a bit like a lover, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1178">felt</a> like a burglar with the</p>
<p>safe-door nearly opened. "Come in," I said almost impatiently, for</p>
<p>anyone might be in the passage, and I gripped her wrist and drew her</p>
<p>towards me.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" she answered with a faint smile on her lips, and</p>
<p>awkward and yielding.</p>
<p>I shut the door behind her, still holding her with one hand, then</p>
<p>turned upon her-she was laughing nervously-and without a word drew</p>
<p>her to me and kissed her. And I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1179">remember</a> that as I kissed her she</p>
<p>made a little noise almost like the purring miaow with which a cat</p>
<p>will greet one and her face, close to mine, became solemn and</p>
<p>tender.</p>
<p>She was suddenly a different <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1180">being</a> from the discontented wife who</p>
<p>had tapped a moment since on my door, a woman transfigured…</p>
<p>That evening I came down to dinner a monster of pride, for behold! I</p>
<p>was a man. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1181">felt</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1182">myself</a> the most wonderful and unprecedented of</p>
<p>adventurers. It was hard to believe that any one in the world</p>
<p>before had done as much. My mistress and I met smiling, we carried</p>
<p>things off admirably, and it seemed to me that Willersley was the</p>
<p>dullest old dog in the world. I wanted to give him advice. I</p>
<p>wanted to give him derisive pokes. After dinner and coffee in the</p>
<p>lounge I was too excited and hilarious to go to bed, I made him come</p>
<p>with me down to the cafe under the arches by the pier, and there</p>
<p>drank beer and talked extravagant nonsense about everything under</p>
<p>the sun, in order not to talk about the happenings of the afternoon.</p>
<p>All the time something shouted within me: "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1183">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1184">am</a> a man! <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1183">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1184">am</a> a</p>
<p>man!"…</p>
<p>"What shall we do to-morrow?" said he.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1185">I'm</a> for loafing," I said. "Let's row in the morning and spend to-</p>
<p>morrow afternoon just as we did to-day."</p>
<p>"They say the church behind the town is worth <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1186">seeing</a>."</p>
<p>"We'll go up about sunset; that's the best time for it. We can</p>
<p>start about five."</p>
<p>We <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1187">heard</a> music, and went further along the arcade to discover a</p>
<p>place where girls in operatic Swiss peasant costume were singing and</p>
<p>dancing on a creaking, protesting little stage. I eyed their</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1188">generous</a> display of pink neck and arm with the seasoned eye of a man</p>
<p>who has lived in the world. Life was perfectly simple and easy, I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1189">felt</a>, if one took it the right way.</p>
<p>Next day Willersley wanted to go on, but I delayed. Altogether I</p>
<p>kept him back four days. Then abruptly my mood changed, and we</p>
<p>decided to start early the following morning. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1190">remember</a>, though a</p>
<p>little indistinctly, the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1191">feeling</a> of my last talk with that woman</p>
<p>whose surname, odd as it may seem, either I never learnt or I have</p>
<p>forgotten. (Her christian name was Milly.) She was tired and</p>
<p>rather low-spirited, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1192">disposed</a> to be sentimental, and for the</p>
<p>first time in our intercourse I found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1193">myself</a> liking her for the sake</p>
<p>of her own personality. There was something kindly and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1194">generous</a></p>
<p>appearing behind the veil of naive and uncontrolled sensuality she</p>
<p>had worn. There was a curious quality of motherliness in her</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1195">attitude</a> to me that something in my nature answered and approved.</p>
<p>She didn't pretend to keep it up that she had yielded to my</p>
<p>initiative. "I've done you no harm," she said a little <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1196">doubtfully</a>,</p>
<p>an odd note for a man's victim! And, "we've had a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1197">good</a> time. You</p>
<p>have liked me, haven't you?"</p>
<p>She interested me in her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1198">lonely</a> dissatisfied life; she was childless</p>
<p>and had no hope of children, and her husband was the only son of a</p>
<p>rich meat salesman, very mean, a mighty smoker-"he reeks of it,"</p>
<p>she said, "always"-and interested in nothing but golf, billiards</p>
<p>(which he played very badly), pigeon shooting, convivial Free</p>
<p>Masonry and Stock Exchange punting. Mostly they drifted about the</p>
<p>Riviera. Her mother had contrived her marriage when she was</p>
<p>eighteen. They were the first samples I ever encountered of the</p>
<p>great multitude of functionless property owners which encumbers</p>
<p>modern civilisation-but at the time I didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1199">think</a> much of that</p>
<p>aspect of them…</p>
<p>I tell all this business as it happened without comment, because I</p>
<p>have no comment to make. It was all strange to me, strange rather</p>
<p>than wonderful, and, it may be, some <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1200">dream</a> of beauty died for ever</p>
<p>in those furtive meetings; it happened to me, and I could scarcely</p>
<p>have been more irresponsible in the matter or controlled events less</p>
<p>if I had been suddenly pushed over a cliff into water. I swam, of</p>
<p>course-finding <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1201">myself</a> in it. Things tested me, and I reacted, as I</p>
<p>have told. The bloom of my innocence, if ever there had been such a</p>
<p>thing, was gone. And here is the remarkable thing about it; at the</p>
<p>time and for some days I was over-weeningly proud; I have never been</p>
<p>so proud before or since; I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1202">felt</a> I had been promoted to virility; I</p>
<p>was unable to conceal my exultation from Willersley. It was a mood</p>
<p>of shining shameless ungracious self-approval. As he and I went</p>
<p>along in the cool morning sunshine by the rice fields in the throat</p>
<p>of the Val Maggia a silence fell between us.</p>
<p>"You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1203">know</a>?" I said abruptly,-"about that woman?"</p>
<p>Willersley did not answer for a moment. He looked at me over the</p>
<p>corner of his spectacles.</p>
<p>"Things went pretty far?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh! all the way!" and I had a twinge of fatuous pride in my</p>
<p>unpremeditated achievement.</p>
<p>"She came to your room?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1204">heard</a> her. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1204">heard</a> her whispering… The whispering and</p>
<p>rustling and so on. I was in my room yesterday… Any one</p>
<p>might have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1204">heard</a> you."</p>
<p>I went on with my head in the air.</p>
<p>"You might have been caught, and that would have meant endless</p>
<p>trouble. You might have incurred all sorts of consequences. What</p>
<p>did you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1205">know</a> about her?… We have wasted four days in that hot</p>
<p>close place. When we found that League of Social Service we were</p>
<p>talking about," he said with a determined eye upon me, "chastity</p>
<p>will be first among the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1206">virtues</a> prescribed."</p>
<p>"I shall <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1207">form</a> a rival league," I said a little damped. "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1208">I'm</a> hanged</p>
<p>if I give up a single <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1209">desire</a> in me until I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1210">know</a> why."</p>
<p>He lifted his chin and stared before him through his glasses at</p>
<p>nothing. "There are some things," he said, "that a man who means to</p>
<p>work-to do great public services-MUST turn his back upon. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1211">I'm</a> not</p>
<p>discussing the rights or wrongs of this sort of thing. It happens</p>
<p>to be the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1212">conditions</a> we work under. It will probably always be so.</p>
<p>If you want to experiment in that way, if you want even to discuss</p>
<p>it,-out you go from political life. You must <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1213">know</a> that's so…</p>
<p>You're a strange man, Remington, with a kind of kink in you. You've</p>
<p>a sort of force. You might happen to do immense things…</p>
<p>Only-"</p>
<p>He stopped. He had said all that he had forced <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1214">himself</a> to say.</p>
<p>"I mean to take <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1215">myself</a> as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1216">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1217">am</a>," I said. "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1218">I'm</a> going to get</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1219">experience</a> for humanity out of all my talents-and bury nothing."</p>
<p>Willersley twisted his face to its humorous expression. "I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1220">doubt</a> if</p>
<p>sexual proclivities," he said drily, come within the scope of the</p>
<p>parable."</p>
<p>I let that go for a little while. Then I broke out. "Sex!" said I,</p>
<p>"is a fundamental thing in life. We went through all this at</p>
<p>Trinity. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1221">I'm</a> going to look at it, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1222">experience</a> it, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1223">think</a> about it-</p>
<p>and get it square with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1224">rest</a> of life. Career and Politics must</p>
<p>take their chances of that. It's part of the general English</p>
<p>slackness that they won't look this in the face. Gods! what a</p>
<p>muffled time we're coming out of! Sex means breeding, and breeding</p>
<p>is a necessary function in a nation. The Romans broke up upon that.</p>
<p>The Americans fade out amidst their successes. Eugenics-"</p>
<p>"THAT wasn't Eugenics," said Willersley.</p>
<p>"It was a woman," I said after a little interval, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1225">feeling</a> oddly that</p>
<p>I had failed altogether to answer him, and yet had a strong dumb</p>
<p>case against him.</p>

</title>
<p>I must go back a little way with my story. In the previous book I</p>
<p>have described the kind of education that happens to a man of my</p>
<p>class nowadays, and it has been convenient to leap a phase in my</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1226">experience</a> that I must now set out at length. I want to tell in</p>
<p>this second hook how I came to marry, and to do that I must give</p>
<p>something of the atmosphere in which I first met my wife and some</p>
<p>intimations of the forces that went to her making. I met her in</p>
<p>Staffordshire while I was staying with that uncle of whom I have</p>
<p>already spoken, the uncle who sold my father's houses and settled my</p>
<p>mother in Penge. Margaret was twenty then and I was twenty-two.</p>
<p>It was just before the walking tour in Switzerland that opened up so</p>
<p>much of the world to me. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1227">saw</a> her once, for an afternoon, and</p>
<p>circumstances so threw her up in relief that I formed a very vivid</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1228">memory</a> of her. She was in the sharpest contrast with the industrial</p>
<p>world about her; she impressed me as a dainty blue flower might do,</p>
<p>come upon suddenly on a clinker heap. She remained in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1229">mind</a> at</p>
<p>once a perplexing interrogation and a symbol…</p>
<p>But first I must tell of my Staffordshire cousins and the world that</p>
<p>served as a foil for her.</p>

</title>
<p>I first went to stay with my cousins when I was an awkward youth of</p>
<p>sixteen, wearing deep mourning for my mother. My uncle wanted to</p>
<p>talk things over with me, he said, and if he could, to persuade me</p>
<p>to go into business instead of going up to Cambridge.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1230">remember</a> that visit on account of all sorts of novel things, but</p>
<p>chiefly, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1231">think</a>, because it was the first time I encountered</p>
<p>anything that deserves to be spoken of as wealth. For the first</p>
<p>time in my life I had to do with people who seemed to have endless</p>
<p>supplies of money, unlimited <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1232">good</a> clothes, numerous servants; whose</p>
<p>daily life was made up of things that I had hitherto considered to</p>
<p>be treats or exceptional extravagances. My cousins of eighteen and</p>
<p>nineteen took cabs, for instance, with the utmost freedom, and</p>
<p>travelled first-class in the local trains that run up and down the</p>
<p>district of the Five Towns with an entire unconsciousness of the</p>
<p>magnificence, as it seemed to me, of such a proceeding.</p>
<p>The family occupied a large villa in Newcastle, with big lawns</p>
<p>before it and behind, a shrubbery with quite a lot of shrubs, a</p>
<p>coach house and stable, and subordinate dwelling-places for the</p>
<p>gardener and the coachman. Every bedroom contained a gas heater and</p>
<p>a canopied brass bedstead, and had a little bathroom attached</p>
<p>equipped with the porcelain baths and fittings my uncle</p>
<p>manufactured, bright and sanitary and stamped with his name, and the</p>
<p>house was furnished throughout with chairs and tables in bright</p>
<p>shining wood, soft and prevalently red Turkish carpets, cosy</p>
<p>corners, curtained archways, gold-framed landscapes, overmantels, a</p>
<p>dining-room sideboard like a palace with a large Tantalus, and</p>
<p>electric light fittings of a gay and expensive quality. There was a</p>
<p>fine billiard-room on the ground floor with three <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1233">comfortable</a> sofas</p>
<p>and a rotating bookcase containing an excellent collection of the</p>
<p>English and American humorists from THREE MEN IN A BOAT to the</p>
<p>penultimate Mark Twain. There was also a conservatory opening out</p>
<p>of the dining-room, to which the gardener brought potted flowers in</p>
<p>their season…</p>
<p>My aunt was a little woman with a scared look and a cap that would</p>
<p>get over one eye, not very like my mother, and nearly eight years</p>
<p>her junior; she was very much concerned with keeping everything</p>
<p>nice, and unmercifully bullied by my two cousins, who took after</p>
<p>their father and followed the imaginations of their own hearts.</p>
<p>They were tall, dark, warmly flushed girls handsome rather than</p>
<p>pretty. Gertrude, the eldest and tallest, had eyes that were almost</p>
<p>black; Sibyl was of a stouter build, and her eyes, of which she was</p>
<p>shamelessly proud, were dark blue. Sibyl's hair waved, and</p>
<p>Gertrude's was severely straight. They treated me on my first visit</p>
<p>with all the contempt of the adolescent girl for a boy a little</p>
<p>younger and infinitely less expert in the business of life than</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1234">herself</a>. They were very busy with the writings of notes and certain</p>
<p>mysterious goings and comings of their own, and left me very much to</p>
<p>my own devices. Their speech in my presence was full of</p>
<p>unfathomable allusions. They were the sort of girls who will talk</p>
<p>over and through an uninitiated stranger with the pleasantest sense</p>
<p>of superiority.</p>
<p>I met them at breakfast and at lunch and at the half-past six</p>
<p>o'clock high tea that formed the third chief meal of the day. I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1235">heard</a> them rattling off the compositions of Chaminade and Moskowski,</p>
<p>with great decision and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1236">effect</a>, and hovered on the edge of tennis</p>
<p>foursomes where it was manifest to the dullest intelligence that my</p>
<p>presence was unnecessary. Then I went off to find some readable</p>
<p>book in the place, but apart from miscellaneous popular novels, some</p>
<p>veterinary works, a number of comic books, old bound volumes of THE</p>
<p>ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS and a large, popular illustrated History of</p>
<p>England, there was very little to be found. My anut talked to me in</p>
<p>a casual feeble way, chiefly about my motber's last illness. The</p>
<p>two bad <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1237">seen</a> very little of each other for many years; she made no</p>
<p>secret of it that the ineligible qualities of my father were the</p>
<p>cause of the estrangement. The only other society in the house</p>
<p>during the day was an old and rather decayed Skye terrier in</p>
<p>constant conflict with what were no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1238">doubt</a> imaginary fleas. I took</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1239">myself</a> off for a series of walks, and acquired a considerable</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1240">knowledge</a> of the scenery and topography of the Potteries.</p>
<p>It puzzled my aunt that I did not go westward, where it was country-</p>
<p>side and often quite pretty, with hedgerows and fields and copses</p>
<p>and flowers. But always I went eastward, where in a long valley</p>
<p>industrialism smokes and sprawls. That was the stuff to which I</p>
<p>turned by nature, to the human effort, and the accumulation and jar</p>
<p>of men's activities. And in such a country as that valley social</p>
<p>and economic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1241">relations</a> were simple and manifest. Instead of the</p>
<p>limitless <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1242">confusion</a> of London's population, in which no man can</p>
<p>trace any but the most slender correlation between rich and poor, in</p>
<p>which everyone seems disconnected and adrift from everyone, you can</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1243">see</a> here the works, the potbank or the ironworks or what not, and</p>
<p>here close at hand the congested, meanly-housed workers, and at a</p>
<p>little distance a small middle-class quarter, and again remoter, the</p>
<p>big house of the employer. It was like a very simplified diagram-</p>
<p>after the untraceable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1242">confusion</a> of London.</p>
<p>I prowled <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1244">alone</a>, curious and interested, through shabby back streets</p>
<p>of mean little homes; I followed canals, sometimes canals of</p>
<p>mysteriously heated waters with ghostly wisps of steam rising</p>
<p>against blackened walls or a distant prospect of dustbin-fed</p>
<p>vegetable gardens, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1245">saw</a> the women pouring out from the potbanks,</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1246">heard</a> the hooters summoning the toilers to work, lost my way upon</p>
<p>slag heaps as big as the hills of the south country, dodged trains</p>
<p>at manifestly dangerous level crossings, and surveyed across dark</p>
<p>intervening spaces, the flaming uproar, the gnome-like activities of</p>
<p>iron foundries. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1246">heard</a> talk of strikes and rumours of strikes, and</p>
<p>learnt from the columns of some obscure labour paper I bought one</p>
<p>day, of the horrors of the lead poisoning that was in those days one</p>
<p>of the normal risks of certain sorts of pottery workers. Then back</p>
<p>I came, by the ugly groaning and clanging steam tram of that period,</p>
<p>to my uncle's house and lavish abundance of money and more or less</p>
<p>furtive flirtations and the tinkle of Moskowski and Chaminade. It</p>
<p>was, I say, diagrammatic. One <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1245">saw</a> the expropriator and the</p>
<p>expropriated-as if Marx had arranged the picture. It was as</p>
<p>jumbled and far more dingy and disastrous than any of the confusions</p>
<p>of building and development that had surrounded my youth at</p>
<p>Bromstead and Penge, but it had a novel quality of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1247">being</a> explicable.</p>
<p>I found great <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1248">virtue</a> in the word "exploitation."</p>
<p>There stuck in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1249">mind</a> as if it was symbolical of the whole thing</p>
<p>the twisted figure of a man, whose face had been horribly scalded-I</p>
<p>can't describe how, except that one eye was just expressionless</p>
<p>white-and he ground at an organ bearing a card which told in weak</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1250">bitterly</a> satirical phrasing that he had been scalded by the hot</p>
<p>water from the tuyeres of the blast furnace of Lord Pandram's works.</p>
<p>He had been scalded and quite inadequately compensated and</p>
<p>dismissed. And Lord Pandram was worth half a million.</p>
<p>That upturned <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1251">sightless</a> white eye of his took possession of my</p>
<p>imagination. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1252">think</a> that even then I was swayed by any crude</p>
<p>melodramatic conception of injustice. I was quite prepared to</p>
<p>believe the card wasn't a punctiliously accurate statement of fact,</p>
<p>and that a case could be made out for Lord Pandram. Still there in</p>
<p>the muddy gutter, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1253">painfully</a> and dreadfully, was the man, and he was</p>
<p>smashed and scalded and wretched, and he ground his dismal</p>
<p>hurdygurdy with a weary arm, calling upon Heaven and the passer-by</p>
<p>for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1254">help</a>, for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1254">help</a> and some sort of righting-one could not imagine</p>
<p>quite what. There he was as a fact, as a by-product of the system</p>
<p>that heaped my cousins with trinkets and provided the comic novels</p>
<p>and the abundant cigars and spacious billiard-room of my uncle's</p>
<p>house. I couldn't disconnect him and them.</p>
<p>My uncle on his part did nothing to conceal the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1255">state</a> of war that</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1256">existed</a> between <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1257">himself</a> and his workers, and the mingled contempt</p>
<p>and animosity he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1258">felt</a> from them.</p>

<p>Prosperity had overtaken my uncle. So quite naturally he believed</p>
<p>that every man who was not as prosperous as he was had only <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1259">himself</a></p>
<p>to blame. He was rich and he had left school and gone into his</p>
<p>father's business at fifteen, and that seemed to him the proper age</p>
<p>at which everyone's education should terminate. He was very anxious</p>
<p>to dissuade me from going up to Cambridge, and we argued</p>
<p>intermittently through all my visit.</p>
<p>I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1260">remembered</a> him as a big and buoyant man, striding</p>
<p>destructively about the nursery floor of my childhood, and saluting</p>
<p>my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1261">existence</a> by slaps, loud laughter, and questions about half</p>
<p>herrings and half eggs subtly framed to puzzle and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1262">confuse</a> my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1263">mind</a>.</p>
<p>I didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1264">see</a> him for some years until my father's death, and then he</p>
<p>seemed rather smaller, though still a fair size, yellow instead of</p>
<p>red and much less radiantly aggressive. This altered <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1265">effect</a> was due</p>
<p>not so much to my own changed perspectives, I fancy, as to the facts</p>
<p>that he was suffering for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1266">continuous</a> cigar smoking, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1267">being</a> taken</p>
<p>in hand by his adolescent daughters who had just returned from</p>
<p>school.</p>
<p>During my first visit there was a perpetual series of-the only word</p>
<p>is rows, between them and him. Up to the age of fifteen or</p>
<p>thereabouts, he had maintamed his ascendancy over them by simple</p>
<p>old-fashioned physical chastisement. Then after an interlude of a</p>
<p>year it had dawned upon them that power had mysteriously departed</p>
<p>from him. He had tried stopping their pocket money, but they found</p>
<p>their mother financially amenable; besides which it was fundamental</p>
<p>to my uncle's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1268">attitude</a> that he should give them money freely. Not</p>
<p>to do so would seem like admitting a difficulty in making it. So</p>
<p>that after he had stopped their allowances for the fourth time Sybil</p>
<p>and Gertrude were prepared to face beggary without a qualm. It had</p>
<p>been his pride to give them the largest allowance of any girls at</p>
<p>the school, not even excepting the granddaughter of Fladden the</p>
<p>Borax King, and his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1269">soul</a> recoiled from this discipline as it had</p>
<p>never recoiled from the ruder method of the earlier phase. Both</p>
<p>girls had developed to a high pitch in their mutual recriminations a</p>
<p>gift for damaging retort, and he found it an altogether deadlier</p>
<p>thing than the power of the raised voice that had always cowed my</p>
<p>aunt. Whenever he became heated with them, they frowned as if</p>
<p>involuntarily, drew in their breath sharply, said: "Daddy, you</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1270">really</a> must not say -" and corrected his pronunciation. Then, at a</p>
<p>great advantage, they resumed the discussion…</p>
<p>My uncle's views about Cambridge, however, were perfectly clear and</p>
<p>definite. It was waste of time and money. It was all damned</p>
<p>foolery. Did they make a man a better business man? Not a bit of</p>
<p>it. He gave instances. It spoilt a man for business by giving him</p>
<p>"false ideas." Some men said that at college a man formed useful</p>
<p>friendships. What use were friendships to a business man? He might</p>
<p>get to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1271">know</a> lords, but, as my uncle pointed out, a lord's</p>
<p>requirements in his line of faience were little greater than a</p>
<p>common man's. If college introduced him to hotel proprietors there</p>
<p>might be something in it. Perhaps it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1272">helped</a> a man into Parliament,</p>
<p>Parliament still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1273">being</a> a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1274">confused</a> retrogressive corner in the world</p>
<p>where lawyers and suchlike sheltered <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1275">themselves</a> from the onslaughts</p>
<p>of common-sense behind a fog of Latin and Greek and twaddle and</p>
<p>tosh; but I wasn't the sort to go into Parliament, unless I meant to</p>
<p>be a lawyer. Did I mean to be a lawyer? It cost no end of money,</p>
<p>and was full of uncertainties, and there were no judges nor great</p>
<p>solicitors among my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1276">relations</a>. "Young chaps <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1277">think</a> they get on by</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1275">themselves</a>," said my uncle. It isn't so. Not unless they take</p>
<p>their coats off. I took mine off before I was your age by nigh a</p>
<p>year."</p>
<p>We were at cross purposes from the outset, because I did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1278">think</a></p>
<p>men lived to make money; and I was obtuse to the hints he was</p>
<p>throwing out at the possibilities of his own potbank, not willfully</p>
<p>obtuse, but just failing to penetrate his meaning. Whatever City</p>
<p>Merchants had or had not done for me, Flack, Topham and old Gates</p>
<p>had certainly barred my mistaking the profitable production and sale</p>
<p>of lavatory basins and bathroom fittings for the highest <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1279">good</a>. It</p>
<p>was only upon reflection that it dawned upon me that the splendid</p>
<p>chance for a young fellow with my uncle, "me, having no son of my</p>
<p>own," was anything but an illustration for comparison with my own</p>
<p>chosen career.</p>
<p>I still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1280">remember</a> very distinctly my uncle's talk,-he loved to speak</p>
<p>"reet Staffordshire"-his rather flabby face with the mottled</p>
<p>complexion that told of crude ill-regulated appetites, his clumsy</p>
<p>gestures-he kept emphasising his points by prodding at me with his</p>
<p>finger-the ill-worn, costly, grey tweed clothes, the watch chain of</p>
<p>plain solid gold, and soft <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1281">felt</a> hat thrust back from his head. He</p>
<p>tackled me first in the garden after lunch, and then tried to raise</p>
<p>me to enthusiasm by taking me to his potbank and showing me its</p>
<p>organisation, from the dusty grinding mills in which whitened men</p>
<p>worked and coughed, through the highly ventilated glazing room in</p>
<p>which strangely masked girls looked ashamed of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1282">themselves</a>,-"They'll</p>
<p>risk death, the fools, to show their faces to a man," said my uncle,</p>
<p>quite audibly-to the firing kilns and the glazing kilns, and so</p>
<p>round the whole place to the railway siding and the gratifying</p>
<p>spectacle of three trucks laden with executed orders.</p>
<p>Then we went up a creaking outside staircase to his little office,</p>
<p>and he showed off before me for a while, with one or two</p>
<p>subordinates and the telephone.</p>
<p>"None of your Gas," he said, "all this. It's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1283">Real</a> every bit of it.</p>
<p>Hard cash and hard glaze."</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1284">memories</a> of a carelessly read pamphlet in my</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1285">mind</a>, and without any satirical intention, "I suppose you MUST use</p>
<p>lead in your glazes?"</p>
<p>Whereupon I found I had tapped the ruling grievance of my uncle's</p>
<p>life. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1286">hated</a> leadless glazes more than he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1286">hated</a> anything, except</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1287">benevolent</a> people who had organised the agitation for their use.</p>
<p>"Leadless glazes ain't only fit for buns," he said. "Let me tell</p>
<p>you, my boy-"</p>
<p>He began in a voice of bland persuasiveness that presently warmed to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1288">anger</a>, to explain the whole matter. I hadn't the rights of the</p>
<p>matter at all. Firstly, there was practically no such thing as lead</p>
<p>poisoning. Secondly, not everyone was liable to lead poisoning, and</p>
<p>it would be quite easy to pick out the susceptible types-as soon as</p>
<p>they had it-and put them to other work. Thirdly, the evil <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1289">effects</a></p>
<p>of lead poisoning were much exaggerated. Fourthly, and this was in</p>
<p>a particularly confidential undertone, many of the people liked to</p>
<p>get lead poisoning, especially the women, because it caused</p>
<p>abortion. I might not believe it, but he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1290">knew</a> it for a fact.</p>
<p>Fifthly, the work-people simply would not learn the gravity of the</p>
<p>danger, and would eat with unwashed hands, and incur all sorts of</p>
<p>risks, so that as my uncle put it: "the fools deserve what they</p>
<p>get." Sixthly, he and several associated firms had organised a</p>
<p>simple and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1291">generous</a> insurance scheme against lead-poisoning risks.</p>
<p>Seventhly, he never wearied in rational (as distinguished from</p>
<p>excessive, futile and expensive) precautions against the disease.</p>
<p>Eighthly, in the ill-equipped shops of his minor competitors lead</p>
<p>poisoning was a frequent and virulent evil, and people had</p>
<p>generalised from these exceptional cases. The small shops, he</p>
<p>hazarded, looking out of the cracked and dirty window at distant</p>
<p>chimneys, might be advantageously closed…</p>
<p>"But what's the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1292">good</a> of talking?" said my uncle, getting off the</p>
<p>table on which he had been sitting. "Seems to me there'll come a</p>
<p>time when a master will get fined if he don't run round the works</p>
<p>blowing his girls noses for them. That's about what it'll come to."</p>
<p>He walked to the black mantelpiece and stood on the threadbare rug,</p>
<p>and urged me not to be misled by the stories of prejudiced and</p>
<p>interested enemies of our national industries.</p>
<p>"They'll get a strike one of these days, of employers, and then</p>
<p>we'll <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1293">see</a> a bit," he said. "They'll drive Capital abroad and then</p>
<p>they'll whistle to get it back again."…</p>
<p>He led the way down the shaky wooden steps and cheered up to tell me</p>
<p>of his way of checking his coal consumption. He exchanged a</p>
<p>ferocious greeting with one or two workpeople, and so we came out of</p>
<p>the factory gates into the ugly narrow streets, paved with a</p>
<p>peculiarly hard diapered brick of an unpleasing inky-blue colour,</p>
<p>and bordered with the mean and squalid homes of his workers. Doors</p>
<p>stood open and showed grimy interiors, and dirty ill-clad children</p>
<p>played in the kennel.</p>
<p>We passed a sickly-looking girl with a sallow face, who dragged her</p>
<p>limbs and peered at us dimly with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1294">painful</a> eyes. She stood back, as</p>
<p>partly blinded people will do, to allow us to pass, although there</p>
<p>was plenty of room for us.</p>
<p>I glanced back at her.</p>
<p>"THAT'S ploombism " said my uncle casually.</p>
<p>"What?" said I.</p>
<p>"Ploombism. And the other day I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1295">saw</a> a fool of a girl, and what</p>
<p>d'you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1296">think</a>? She'd got a basin that hadn't been fired, a cracked</p>
<p>piece of biscuit it was, up on the shelf over her head, just all</p>
<p>over glaze, killing glaze, man, and she was putting up her hand if</p>
<p>you please, and eating her dinner out of it. Got her dinner in it!</p>
<p>"Eating her dinner out of it," he repeated in loud and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1297">bitter</a> tones,</p>
<p>and punched me hard in the ribs.</p>
<p>"And then they comes to THAT-and grumbles. And the fools up in</p>
<p>Westminster want you to put in fans here and fans there-the Longton</p>
<p>fools have… And then eating their dinners out of it all the</p>
<p>time!"…</p>
<p>At high tea that night-my uncle was still holding out against</p>
<p>evening dinner-Sibyl and Gertrude made what was evidently a</p>
<p>concerted demand for a motorcar.</p>
<p>"You've got your mother's brougham," he said, that's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1298">good</a> enough for</p>
<p>you." But he seemed shaken by the fact that some Burslem rival was</p>
<p>launching out with the new invention. "He spoils his girls," he</p>
<p>remarked. "He's a fool," and became <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1299">thoughtful</a>.</p>
<p>Afterwards he asked me to come to him into his study; it was a room</p>
<p>with a writing-desk and full of pieces of earthenware and suchlike</p>
<p>litter, and we had our great row about Cambridge.</p>
<p>"Have you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1300">thought</a> things over, Dick?" he said.</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1301">think</a> I'll go to Trinity, Uncle," I said firmly. "I want to go</p>
<p>to Trinity. It is a great college."</p>
<p>He was manifestly chagrined. "You're a fool," he said.</p>
<p>I made no answer.</p>
<p>"You're a damned fool," he said. "But I suppose you've got to do</p>
<p>it. You could have come here-That don't matter, though, now…</p>
<p>You'll have your time and spend your money, and be a poor half-</p>
<p>starved clergyman, mucking about with the women all the day and</p>
<p>afraid to have one of your own ever, or you'll be a schoolmaster or</p>
<p>some such fool for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1302">rest</a> of your life. Or some newspaper chap.</p>
<p>That's what you'll get from Cambridge. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1303">I'm</a> half a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1304">mind</a> not to let</p>
<p>you. Eh? More than half a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1304">mind</a>…"</p>
<p>"You've got to do the thing you can," he said, after a pause, "and</p>
<p>likely it's what you're fitted for."</p>

<p>4</p>
</title>
<p>I paid several short visits to Staffordshire during my Cambridge</p>
<p>days, and always these <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1305">relations</a> of mine produced the same <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1306">effect</a> of</p>
<p>hardness. My uncle's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1307">thoughts</a> had neither atmosphere nor mystery.</p>
<p>He lived in a different universe from the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1308">dreams</a> of scientific</p>
<p>construction that filled my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1309">mind</a>. He could as easily have</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1310">understood</a> Chinese poetry. His motives were made up of intense</p>
<p>rivalries with other men of his class and kind, a few vindictive</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1311">hates</a> springing from <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1312">real</a> and fancied slights, a habit of</p>
<p>acquisition that had become a second nature, a keen love both of</p>
<p>efficiency and display in his own affairs. He seemed to me to have</p>
<p>no sense of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1313">state</a>, no sense and much less any love of beauty, no</p>
<p>charity and no sort of religious <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1314">feeling</a> whatever. He had strong</p>
<p>bodily appetites, he ate and drank freely, smoked a great deal, and</p>
<p>occasionally was carried off by his passions for a "bit of a spree"</p>
<p>to Birmingham or Liverpool or Manchester. The indulgences of these</p>
<p>occasions were usually followed by a period of reaction, when he was</p>
<p>urgent for the suppression of nudity in the local Art Gallery and a</p>
<p>harsh and forcible elevation of the superficial morals of the</p>
<p>valley. And he spoke of the ladies who ministered to the delights</p>
<p>of his jolly-dog period, when he spoke of them at all, by the</p>
<p>unprintable feminine equivalent. My aunt he treated with a kindly</p>
<p>contempt and considerable financial <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1315">generosity</a>, but his daughters</p>
<p>tore his heart; he was so proud of them, so glad to find them money</p>
<p>to spend, so resolved to own them, so instinctively <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1316">jealous</a> of every</p>
<p>man who came near them.</p>
<p>My uncle has been the clue to a great number of men for me. He was</p>
<p>an illuminating extreme. I have learnt what not to expect from them</p>
<p>through him, and to comprehend resentments and dangerous sudden</p>
<p>antagonisms I should have found incomprehensible in their more</p>
<p>complex <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1317">forms</a>, if I had not first <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1318">seen</a> them in him in their feral</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1319">state</a>.</p>
<p>With his soft <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1320">felt</a> hat at the back of his head, his rather heavy,</p>
<p>rather mottled face, his rationally thick boots and slouching tweed-</p>
<p>clad <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1321">form</a>, a little round-shouldered and very obstinate looking, he</p>
<p>strolls through all my speculations sucking his teeth audibly, and</p>
<p>occasionally throwing out a shrewd aphorism, the intractable</p>
<p>unavoidable ore of the new civilisation.</p>
<p>Essentially he was simple. Generally speaking, he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1322">hated</a> and</p>
<p>despised in equal measure whatever seemed to suggest that he</p>
<p>personally was not the most perfect human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1323">being</a> conceivable. He</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1322">hated</a> all education after fifteen because he had had no education</p>
<p>after fifteen, he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1322">hated</a> all people who did not have high tea until</p>
<p>he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1324">himself</a> under duress gave up high tea, he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1322">hated</a> every game except</p>
<p>football, which he had played and could judge, he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1322">hated</a> all people</p>
<p>who spoke foreign languages because he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1325">knew</a> no language but</p>
<p>Staffordshire, he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1322">hated</a> all foreigners because he was English, and</p>
<p>all foreign ways because they were not his ways. Also he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1322">hated</a></p>
<p>particularly, and in this order, Londoner's, Yorkshiremen, Scotch,</p>
<p>Welch and Irish, because they were not "reet Staffordshire," and he</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1322">hated</a> all other Staffordshire men as insufficiently "reet." He</p>
<p>wanted to have all his own women inviolate, and to fancy he had a</p>
<p>call upon every other woman in the world. He wanted to have the</p>
<p>best cigars and the best brandy in the world to consume or give away</p>
<p>magnificently, and every one else to have inferior ones. (His</p>
<p>billiard table was an extra large size, specially made and very</p>
<p>inconvenient.) And he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1322">hated</a> Trade Unions because they interfered</p>
<p>with his autocratic direction of his works, and his workpeople</p>
<p>because they were not obedient and untiring mechanisms to do his</p>
<p>bidding. He was, in fact, a very naive, vigorous human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1323">being</a>. He</p>
<p>was about as much civilised, about as much tamed to the ideas of</p>
<p>collective action and mutual consideration as a Central African</p>
<p>negro.</p>
<p>There are hordes of such men as he throughout all the modern</p>
<p>industrial world. You will find the same type with the slightest</p>
<p>modifications in the Pas de Calais or Rhenish Prussia or New Jersey</p>
<p>or North Italy. No <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1326">doubt</a> you would find it in New Japan. These men</p>
<p>have raised <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1327">themselves</a> up from the general mass of untrained,</p>
<p>uncultured, poorish people in a hard industrious <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1328">selfish</a> struggle.</p>
<p>To drive others they have had first to drive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1327">themselves</a>. They have</p>
<p>never yet had occasion nor leisure to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1329">think</a> of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1330">state</a> or social</p>
<p>life as a whole, and as for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1331">dreams</a> or beauty, it was a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1332">condition</a> of</p>
<p>survival that they should ignore such cravings. All the distinctive</p>
<p>qualities of my uncle can be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1333">thought</a> of as dictated by his</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1332">conditions</a>; his success and harshness, the extravagances that</p>
<p>expressed his pride in making money, the uncongenial luxury that</p>
<p>sprang from rivalry, and his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1334">self-reliance</a>, his contempt for broad</p>
<p>views, his contempt for everything that he could not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1335">understand</a>.</p>
<p>His daughters were the inevitable children of his life. Queer girls</p>
<p>they were! Curiously "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1336">spirited</a>" as people phrase it, and curiously</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1337">limited</a>. During my Cambridge days I went down to Staffordshire</p>
<p>several times. My uncle, though he still resented my refusal to go</p>
<p>into his business, was also in his odd way proud of me. I was his</p>
<p>nephew and poor <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1338">relation</a>, and yet there I was, a young gentleman</p>
<p>learning all sorts of unremunerative things in the grandest manner,</p>
<p>"Latin and mook," while the sons of his neighhours, not nephews</p>
<p>merely, but sons, stayed unpolished in their native town. Every</p>
<p>time I went down I found extensive changes and altered <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1339">relations</a>,</p>
<p>and before I had settled down to them off I went again. I don't</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1340">think</a> I was one person to them; I was a series of visitors. There</p>
<p>is a gulf of ages between a gaunt schoolboy of sixteen in unbecoming</p>
<p>mourning and two vividly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1341">self-conscious</a> girls of eighteen and</p>
<p>nineteen, but a Cambridge "man" of two and twenty with a first and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1342">good</a> tennis and a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1343">growing</a> social <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1344">experience</a>, is a fair contemporary</p>
<p>for two girls of twenty-three and twenty-four.</p>
<p>A motor-car appeared, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1345">think</a> in my second visit, a bottle-green</p>
<p>affair that opened behind, had dark purple cushions, and was</p>
<p>controlled mysteriously by a man in shiny black costume and a flat</p>
<p>cap. The high tea had been shifted to seven and rechristened</p>
<p>dinner, but my uncle would not dress nor consent to have wine; and</p>
<p>after one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1346">painful</a> experiment, I gathered, and a scene, he put his</p>
<p>foot down and prohibited any but high-necked dresses.</p>
<p>"Daddy's perfectly impossible," Sybil told me.</p>
<p>The foot had descended vehemently! "My own daughters!" he had said,</p>
<p>"dressed up like -"-and had arrested <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1347">himself</a> and fumbled and</p>
<p>decided to say-"actresses, and showin' their fat arms for every</p>
<p>fool to stare at!" Nor would he have any people invited to dinner.</p>
<p>He didn't, he had explained, want strangers poking about in his</p>
<p>house when he came home tired. So such calling as occurred went on</p>
<p>during his absence in the afternoon.</p>
<p>One of the peculiarities of the life of these ascendant families of</p>
<p>the industrial class to which wealth has come, is its tremendous</p>
<p>insulations. There were no customs of intercourse in the Five</p>
<p>Towns. All the isolated prosperities of the district sprang from</p>
<p>economising, hard driven homes, in which there was neither time nor</p>
<p>means for hospitality. Social intercourse centred very largely upon</p>
<p>the church or chapel, and the chapels were better at bringing people</p>
<p>together than the Establishment to which my cousins belonged. Their</p>
<p>chief outlet to the wider world lay therefore through the</p>
<p>acquaintances they had formed at school, and through two much less</p>
<p>prosperous families of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1348">relations</a> who lived at Longton and Hanley. A</p>
<p>number of gossiping friendships with old school mates were "kept</p>
<p>up," and my cousins would "spend the afternoon" or even spend the</p>
<p>day with these; such occasions led to other encounters and</p>
<p>interlaced with the furtive correspondences and snatched meetings</p>
<p>that formed the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1349">emotional</a> thread of their lives. When the billiard</p>
<p>table had been new, my uncle had taken to asking in a few approved</p>
<p>friends for an occasional game, but mostly the billiard-room was for</p>
<p>glory and the girls. Both of them played very well. They never, so</p>
<p>far as I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1350">know</a>, dined out, and when at last after <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1351">bitter</a> domestic</p>
<p>conflicts they began to go to dances, they went with the quavering</p>
<p>connivance of my aunt, and changed into ball frocks at friends'</p>
<p>houses on the way. There was a tennis club that formed a convenient</p>
<p>afternoon rendezvous, and I recall that in the period of my earlier</p>
<p>visits the young bloods of the district found much <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1352">satisfaction</a> in</p>
<p>taking girls for drives in dog-carts and suchlike high-wheeled</p>
<p>vehicles, a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1353">disposition</a> that died in tangled tandems at the</p>
<p>apparition of motor-car's.</p>
<p>My aunt and uncle had conceived no plans in life for their daughters</p>
<p>at all. In the undifferentiated industrial community from which</p>
<p>they had sprung, girls got married somehow, and it did not occur to</p>
<p>them that the concentration of property that had made them wealthy,</p>
<p>had cut their children off from the general social sea in which</p>
<p>their own awkward meeting had occurred, without necessarily opening</p>
<p>any other world in exchange. My uncle was too much occupied with</p>
<p>the works and his business affairs and his private vices to</p>
<p>philosophise about his girls; he wanted them just to keep girls,</p>
<p>preferably about sixteen, and to be a sort of animated flowers and</p>
<p>make home bright and be given things. He was irritated that they</p>
<p>would not remain at this, and still more irritated that they failed</p>
<p>to suppress altogether their natural interest in young men. The</p>
<p>tandems would be steered by weird and devious routes to evade the</p>
<p>bare chance of his bloodshot eye. My aunt seemed to have no ideas</p>
<p>whatever about what was likely to happen to her children. She had</p>
<p>indeed no ideas about anything; she took her husband and the days as</p>
<p>they came.</p>
<p>I can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1354">see</a> now the pathetic difficulty of my cousins' position in</p>
<p>life; the absence of any guidance or instruction or provision for</p>
<p>their development. They supplemented the silences of home by the</p>
<p>conversation of schoolfellows and the suggestions of popular</p>
<p>fiction. They had to make what they could out of life with such</p>
<p>hints as these. The church was far too modest to offer them any</p>
<p>advice. It was obtruded upon my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1355">mind</a> upon my first visit that they</p>
<p>were both carrying on correspondences and having little furtive</p>
<p>passings and seeings and meetings with the mysterious owners of</p>
<p>certain initials, S. and L. K., and, if I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1356">remember</a> rightly, "the R.</p>
<p>N." brothers and cousins, I suppose, of their friends. The same</p>
<p>thing was going on, with a certain intensification, at my next</p>
<p>visit, excepting only that the initials were different. But when I</p>
<p>came again their methods were maturer or I was no longer a</p>
<p>negligible quantity, and the notes and the initials were no longer</p>
<p>flaunted quite so openly in my face.</p>
<p>My cousins had worked it out from the indications of their universe</p>
<p>that the end of life is to have a "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1357">good</a> time." They used the</p>
<p>phrase. That and the drives in dog-carts were only the first of</p>
<p>endless points of resemblance between them and the commoner sort of</p>
<p>American girl. When some years ago I paid my first and only visit</p>
<p>to America I seemed to recover my cousins' atmosphere as soon as I</p>
<p>entered the train at Euston. There were three girls in my</p>
<p>compartment supplied with huge decorated cases of sweets, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1358">being</a></p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1359">seen</a> off by a company of friends, noisily arch and eager about the</p>
<p>"steamer letters" they would get at Liverpool; they were the very</p>
<p>soul-sisters of my cousins. The chief elements of a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1357">good</a> time, as</p>
<p>my cousins judged it, as these countless thousands of rich young</p>
<p>women judge it, are a petty eventfulness, laughter, and to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1360">feel</a> that</p>
<p>you are looking well and attracting attention. Shopping is one of</p>
<p>its leading <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1361">joys</a>. You buy things, clothes and trinkets for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1362">yourself</a></p>
<p>and presents for your friends. Presents always seemed to be flying</p>
<p>about in that circle; flowers and boxes of sweets were common</p>
<p>currency. My cousins were always getting and giving, my uncle</p>
<p>caressed them with parcels and cheques. They kissed him and he</p>
<p>exuded sovereigns as a stroked APHIS exudes honey. It was like the</p>
<p>new language of the Academy of Lagado to me, and I never learnt how</p>
<p>to express <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1363">myself</a> in it, for nature and training make me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1360">feel</a></p>
<p>encumbered to receive presents and embarrassed in giving them. But</p>
<p>then, like my father, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1364">hate</a> and distrust possessions.</p>
<p>Of the quality of their private imagination I never learnt anything;</p>
<p>I suppose it followed the lines of the fiction they read and was</p>
<p>romantic and sentimental. So far as marriage went, the married</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1365">state</a> seemed at once very attractive and dreadfully serious to them,</p>
<p>composed in equal measure of becoming important and becoming old. I</p>
<p>don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1366">know</a> what they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1367">thought</a> about children. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1368">doubt</a> if they</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1367">thought</a> about them at all. It was very secret if they did.</p>
<p>As for the poor and dingy people all about them, my cousins were</p>
<p>always ready to take part in a Charitable Bazaar. They were unaware</p>
<p>of any economic correlation of their own prosperity and that</p>
<p>circumambient poverty, and they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1369">knew</a> of Trade Unions simply as</p>
<p>disagreeable external things that upset my uncle's temper. They</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1369">knew</a> of nothing wrong in social life at all except that there were</p>
<p>"Agitators." It surprised them a little, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1370">think</a>, that Agitators</p>
<p>were not more drastically put down. But they had a sort of</p>
<p>instinctive dread of social discussion as of something that might</p>
<p>breach the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1371">happiness</a> of their ignorance…</p>

<p>My cousins did more than illustrate Marx for me; they also undertook</p>
<p>a stage of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1372">emotional</a> education. Their method in that as in</p>
<p>everything else was extremely simple, but it took my inexperience by</p>
<p>surprise.</p>
<p>It must have been on my third visit that Sybil took me in hand.</p>
<p>Hitherto I seemed to have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1373">seen</a> her only in profile, but now she</p>
<p>became almost completely full face, manifestly regarded me with</p>
<p>those violet eyes of hers. She passed me things I needed at</p>
<p>breakfast-it was the first morning of my visit-before I asked for</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>When young men are looked at by pretty cousins, they become</p>
<p>intensely aware of those cousins. It seemed to me that I had</p>
<p>always admired Sybil's eyes very greatly, and that there was</p>
<p>something in her temperament congenial to mine. It was odd I had</p>
<p>not noted it on my previous visits.</p>
<p>We walked round the garden somewhen that morning, and talked about</p>
<p>Cambridge. She asked quite a lot of questions about my work and my</p>
<p>ambitions. She said she had always <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1374">felt</a> sure I was clever.</p>
<p>The conversation languished a little, and we picked some flowers for</p>
<p>the house. Then she asked if I could run. I conceded her various</p>
<p>starts and we raced up and down the middle garden path. Then, a</p>
<p>little breathless, we went into the new twenty-five guinea summer-</p>
<p>house at the end of the herbaceous border.</p>
<p>We sat side by side, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1375">pleasantly</a> hidden from the house, and she</p>
<p>became anxious about her hair, which was slightly and prettily</p>
<p>disarranged, and asked me to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1376">help</a> her with the adjustment of a</p>
<p>hairpin. I had never in my life been so near the soft curly hair</p>
<p>and the dainty eyebrow and eyelid and warm soft cheek of a girl, and</p>
<p>I was stirred-</p>
<p>It stirs me now to recall it.</p>
<p>I became a battleground of impulses and inhibitions.</p>
<p>"Thank you," said my cousin, and moved a little away from me.</p>
<p>She began to talk about friendship, and lost her thread and forgot</p>
<p>the little electric stress between us in a rather meandering</p>
<p>analysis of her principal girl friends.</p>
<p>But afterwards she resumed her purpose.</p>
<p>I went to bed that night with one propostion overshadowing</p>
<p>everything else in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1377">mind</a>, namely, that kissing my cousin Sybil was</p>
<p>a difficult, but not impossible, achievement. I do not recall any</p>
<p>shadow of a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1378">doubt</a> whether on the whole it was worth doing. The</p>
<p>thing had come into my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1379">existence</a>, disturbing and interrupting its</p>
<p>flow exactly as a fever does. Sybil had infected me with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1380">herself</a>.</p>
<p>The next day matters came to a crisis in the little upstairs</p>
<p>sitting-room which had been assigned me as a study during my visit.</p>
<p>I was working up there, or rather trying to work in spite of the</p>
<p>outrageous capering of some very primitive elements in my brain,</p>
<p>when she came up to me, under a transparent pretext of looking for a</p>
<p>book.</p>
<p>I turned round and then got up at the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1381">sight</a> of her. I quite forget</p>
<p>what our conversation was about, but I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1382">know</a> she led me to believe I</p>
<p>might kiss her. Then when I attempted to do so she averted her</p>
<p>face.</p>
<p>"How COULD you?" she said; "I didn't mean that!"</p>
<p>That remained the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1383">state</a> of our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1384">relations</a> for two days. I developed</p>
<p>a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1385">growing</a> irritation with and resentment against cousin Sybil,</p>
<p>combined with an intense <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1386">desire</a> to get that kiss for which I</p>
<p>hungered and thirsted. Cousin Sybil went about in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1387">happy</a></p>
<p>persuasion that I was madly in love with her, and her game, so far</p>
<p>as she was concerned, was played and won. It wasn't until I had</p>
<p>fretted for two days that I realised that I was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1388">being</a> used for the</p>
<p>commonest <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1389">form</a> of excitement possible to a commonplace girl; that</p>
<p>dozens perhaps of young men had played the part of Tantalus at</p>
<p>cousin Sybil's lips. I walked about my room at nights, damning her</p>
<p>and calling her by terms which on the whole she rather deserved,</p>
<p>while Sybil went to sleep <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1390">pitying</a> "poor old Dick!"</p>
<p>"Damn it!" I said, "I WILL be equal with you."</p>
<p>But I never did equalise the disadvantage, and perhaps it's as well,</p>
<p>for I fancy that sort of revenge cuts both people too much for a</p>
<p>rational man to seek it…</p>
<p>"Why are men so silly?" said cousin Sybil next morning, wriggling</p>
<p>back with down-bent head to release <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1391">herself</a> from what should have</p>
<p>been a compelling embrace.</p>
<p>"Confound it!" I said with a flash of clear vision. "You STARTED</p>
<p>this game."</p>
<p>"Oh!"</p>
<p>She stood back against a hedge of roses, a little flushed and</p>
<p>excited and interested, and ready for the delightful defensive if I</p>
<p>should renew my attack.</p>
<p>"Beastly hot for scuffling," I said, white with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1392">anger</a>. "I don't</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1393">know</a> whether <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1394">I'm</a> so keen on kissing you, Sybil, after all. I just</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1395">thought</a> you wanted me to."</p>
<p>I could have whipped her, and my voice stung more than my words.</p>
<p>Our eyes met; a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1396">real</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1397">hatred</a> in hers leaping up to meet mine.</p>
<p>"Let's play tennis," I said, after a moment's pause.</p>
<p>"No," she answered shortly, "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1398">I'm</a> going indoors."</p>
<p>"Very well."</p>
<p>And that ended the affair with Sybil.</p>
<p>I was still in the full glare of this disillusionment when Gertrude</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1399">awoke</a> from some preoccupation to an interest in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1400">existence</a>. She</p>
<p>developed a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1401">disposition</a> to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1402">touch</a> my hand by accident, and let her</p>
<p>fingers <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1403">rest</a> in contact with it for a moment,-she had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1404">pleasant</a> soft</p>
<p>hands;-she began to drift into summer houses with me, to let her</p>
<p>arm <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1403">rest</a> trustfully against mine, to ask questions about Cambridge.</p>
<p>They were much the same questions that Sybil had asked. But I</p>
<p>controlled <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1405">myself</a> and maintained a profile of intelligent and</p>
<p>entirely civil indifference to her blandishments.</p>
<p>What Gertrude made of it came out one evening in some talk-I forget</p>
<p>about what-with Sybil.</p>
<p>"Oh, Dick!" said Gertrude a little impatiently, "Dick's Pi."</p>
<p>And I never disillusioned her by any subsequent levity from this</p>
<p>theory of my innate and virginal piety.</p>

</title>
<p>It was against this harsh and crude Staffordshire background that I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1406">think</a> I must have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1407">seen</a> Margaret for the first time. I say I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1406">think</a></p>
<p>because it is quite possible that we had passed each other in the</p>
<p>streets of Cambridge, no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1408">doubt</a> with that affectation of mutual</p>
<p>disregard which was once customary between undergraduates and</p>
<p>Newnham girls. But if that was so I had noted nothing of the</p>
<p>slender graciousness that shone out so <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1409">pleasingly</a> against the</p>
<p>bleaker midland surroundings.</p>
<p>She was a younger schoolfellow of my cousins', and the step-daughter</p>
<p>of Seddon, a prominent solicitor of Burslem. She was not only not</p>
<p>in my cousins' generation but not in their set, she was one of a</p>
<p>small hardworking group who kept immaculate note-books, and did as</p>
<p>much as is humanly possible of that insensate pile of written work</p>
<p>that the Girls' Public School movement has inflicted upon school-</p>
<p>girls. She <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1410">really</a> learnt French and German admirably and</p>
<p>thoroughly, she got as far in mathematics as an unflinching industry</p>
<p>can carry any one with no great natural aptitude, and she went up to</p>
<p>Bennett Hall, Newnham, after the usual conflict with her family, to</p>
<p>work for the History Tripos.</p>
<p>There in her third year she made <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1411">herself</a> thoroughly ill through</p>
<p>overwork, so ill that she had to give up Newnham altogether and go</p>
<p>abroad with her stepmother. She made <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1411">herself</a> ill, as so many girls</p>
<p>do in those university colleges, through the badness of her home and</p>
<p>school training. She <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1412">thought</a> study must needs be a hard straining</p>
<p>of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1413">mind</a>. She worried her work, she gave <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1411">herself</a> no leisure to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1414">see</a> it as a whole, she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1415">felt</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1411">herself</a> not making headway and she cut</p>
<p>her games and exercise in order to increase her hours of toil, and</p>
<p>worked into the night. She carried a knack of laborious</p>
<p>thoroughness into the blind alleys and inessentials of her subject.</p>
<p>It didn't need the badness of the food for which Bennett Hall is</p>
<p>celebrated and the remarkable dietary of nocturnal cocoa, cakes and</p>
<p>soft biscuits with which the girls have supplemented it, to ensure</p>
<p>her collapse. Her mother brought her home, fretting and distressed,</p>
<p>and then finding her hopelessly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1416">unhappy</a> at home, took her and her</p>
<p>half-brother, a rather ailing youngster of ten who died three years</p>
<p>later, for a journey to Italy.</p>
<p>Italy did much to assuage Margaret's chagrin. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1417">think</a> all three of</p>
<p>them had a very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1418">good</a> time there. At home Mr. Seddon, her step-</p>
<p>father, played the part of a well-meaning blight by reason of the</p>
<p>moods that arose from nervous dyspepsia. They went to Florence,</p>
<p>equipped with various introductions and much sound advice from</p>
<p>sympathetic Cambridge friends, and having acquired an ease in Italy</p>
<p>there, went on to Siena, Orvieto, and at last Rome. They returned,</p>
<p>if I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1419">remember</a> rightly, by Pisa, Genoa, Milan and Paris. Six months</p>
<p>or more they had had abroad, and now Margaret was back in Burslem,</p>
<p>in health again and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1420">consciously</a> a very civilised person.</p>
<p>New ideas were abroad, it was Maytime and a spring of abundant</p>
<p>flowers-daffodils were particularly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1421">good</a> that year-and Mrs. Seddon</p>
<p>celebrated her return by giving an afternoon reception at short</p>
<p>notice, with the clear intention of letting every one out into the</p>
<p>garden if the weather held.</p>
<p>The Seddons had a big old farmhouse modified to modern ideas of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1422">comfort</a> on the road out towards Misterton, with an orchard that had</p>
<p>been rather <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1423">pleasantly</a> subdued from use to ornament. It had rich</p>
<p>blossoming cherry and apple trees. Large patches of grass full of</p>
<p>nodding yellow trumpets had been left amidst the not too precisely</p>
<p>mown grass, which was as it were grass path with an occasional lapse</p>
<p>into lawn or glade. And Margaret, hatless, with the fair hair above</p>
<p>her thin, delicately pink face very simply done, came to meet our</p>
<p>rather too <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1424">consciously</a> dressed party,-we had come in the motor four</p>
<p>strong, with my aunt in grey silk. Margaret wore a soft flowing</p>
<p>flowered blue dress of diaphanous material, all unconnected with the</p>
<p>fashion and tied with pretty ribbons, like a slenderer, unbountiful</p>
<p>Primavera.</p>
<p>It was one of those May days that ape the light and heat of summer,</p>
<p>and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1425">remember</a> disconnectedly quite a number of brightly lit figures</p>
<p>and groups walking about, and a white gate between orchard and</p>
<p>garden and a large lawn with an oak tree and a red Georgian house</p>
<p>with a verandah and open French windows, through which the tea</p>
<p>drinking had come out upon the moss-edged flagstones even as Mrs.</p>
<p>Seddon had planned.</p>
<p>The party was almost entirely feminine except for a little curate</p>
<p>with a large head, a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1426">good</a> voice and a radiant manner, who was</p>
<p>obviously attracted by Margaret, and two or three young husbands</p>
<p>still sufficiently addicted to their wives to accompany them. One</p>
<p>of them I recall as a quite romantic figure with abundant blond</p>
<p>curly hair on which was poised a grey <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1427">felt</a> hat encircled by a</p>
<p>refined black band. He wore, moreover, a loose rich shot silk tie</p>
<p>of red and purple, a long frock coat, grey trousers and brown shoes,</p>
<p>and presently he removed his hat and carried it in one hand. There</p>
<p>were two tennis-playing youths besides <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1428">myself</a>. There was also one</p>
<p>father with three daughters in anxious control, a father of the old</p>
<p>school scarcely half broken in, reluctant, rebellious and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1429">consciously</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1430">conscientiously</a> "reet Staffordshire." The daughters</p>
<p>were all alert to suppress the possible plungings, the undesirable</p>
<p>humorous impulses of this almost feral guest. They nipped his very</p>
<p>gestures in the bud. The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1431">rest</a> of the people were mainly mothers</p>
<p>with daughters-daughters of all ages, and a scattering of aunts,</p>
<p>and there was a tendency to clotting, parties kept together and</p>
<p>regarded parties suspiciously. Mr. Seddon was in hiding, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1432">think</a>,</p>
<p>all the time, though not formally absent.</p>
<p>Matters centred upon the tea in the long room of the French windows,</p>
<p>where four trim maids went to and fro busily between the house and</p>
<p>the clumps of people seated or standing before it; and tennis and</p>
<p>croquet were intermittently visible and audible beyond a bank of</p>
<p>rockwork rich with the spikes and cups and bells of high spring.</p>
<p>Mrs. Seddon presided at the tea urn, and Margaret partly assisted</p>
<p>and partly talked to me and my cousin Sibyl-Gertrude had found a</p>
<p>disused and faded initial and was partnering him at tennis in a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1433">state</a> of gentle revival-while their mother exercised a divided</p>
<p>chaperonage from a seat near Mrs. Seddon. The little curate,</p>
<p>stirring a partially empty cup of tea, mingled with our party, and</p>
<p>preluded, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1434">remember</a>, every observation he made by a vigorous</p>
<p>resumption of stirring.</p>
<p>We talked of Cambridge, and Margaret kept us to it. The curate was</p>
<p>a Selwyn man and had taken a pass degree in theology, but Margaret</p>
<p>had come to Gaylord's lecturers in Trinity for a term before her</p>
<p>breakdown, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1435">understood</a> these differences. She had the eagerness</p>
<p>of an exile to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1436">hear</a> the old familiar names of places and</p>
<p>personalities. We capped familiar anecdotes and were enthusiastic</p>
<p>about Kings' Chapel and the Backs, and the curate, addressing</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1437">himself</a> more particularly to Sibyl, told a long <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1438">confused</a> story</p>
<p>illustrative of his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1439">disposition</a> to reckless devilry (of a pure-</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1440">minded</a> kindly sort) about upsetting two canoes quite needlessly on</p>
<p>the way to Grantchester.</p>
<p>I can still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1441">see</a> Margaret as I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1442">saw</a> her that afternoon, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1441">see</a> her fresh</p>
<p>fair face, with the little obliquity of the upper lip, and her brow</p>
<p>always slightly knitted, and her manner as of one breathlessly shy</p>
<p>but determined. She had rather open blue eyes, and she spoke in an</p>
<p>even musical voice with the gentlest of stresses and the ghost of a</p>
<p>lisp. And it was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1443">true</a>, she gathered, that Cambridge still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1444">existed</a>.</p>
<p>"I went to Grantchester," she said, "last year, and had tea under</p>
<p>the apple-blossom. I didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1445">think</a> then I should have to come down."</p>
<p>(It was that started the curate upon his anecdote.)</p>
<p>"I've <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1446">seen</a> a lot of pictures, and learnt a lot about them-at the</p>
<p>Pitti and the Brera,-the Brera is wonderful-wonderful places,-but</p>
<p>it isn't like <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1447">real</a> study," she was saying presently… "We</p>
<p>bought bales of photographs," she said.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1448">thought</a> the bales a little out of keeping.</p>
<p>But fair-haired and quite simply and yet graciously and fancifully</p>
<p>dressed, talking of art and beautiful things and a beautiful land,</p>
<p>and with so much manifest regret for learning denied, she seemed a</p>
<p>different kind of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1449">being</a> altogether from my smart, hard, high-</p>
<p>coloured, black-haired and resolutely hatted cousin; she seemed</p>
<p>translucent beside Gertrude. Even the little twist and droop of her</p>
<p>slender body was a grace to me.</p>
<p>I liked her from the moment I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1450">saw</a> her, and set <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1451">myself</a> to interest</p>
<p>and please her as well as I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1452">knew</a> how.</p>
<p>We recalled a case of ragging that had rustled the shrubs of</p>
<p>Newnham, and then Chris Robinson's visit-he had given a talk to</p>
<p>Bennett Hall also-and our impression of him.</p>
<p>"He disappointed me, too," said Margaret.</p>
<p>I was moved to tell Margaret something of my own views in the matter</p>
<p>of social progress, and she listened-oh! with a kind of urged</p>
<p>attention, and her brow a little more knitted, very earnestly. The</p>
<p>little curate desisted from the appendices and refuse heaps and</p>
<p>general debris of his story, and made <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1453">himself</a> look very alert and</p>
<p>intelligent.</p>
<p>"We did a lot of that when I was up in the eighties," he said. "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1454">I'm</a></p>
<p>glad Imperialism hasn't swamped you fellows altogether."</p>
<p>Gertrude, looking bright and confident, came to join our talk from</p>
<p>the shrubbery; the initial, a little flushed and evidently in a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1455">state</a> of refreshed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1456">relationship</a>, came with her, and a cheerful lady</p>
<p>in pink and more particularly distinguished by a pink bonnet joined</p>
<p>our little group. Gertrude had been sipping admiration and was not</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1457">disposed</a> to play a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1458">passive</a> part in the talk.</p>
<p>"Socialism!" she cried, catching the word. "It's well Pa isn't</p>
<p>here. He has Fits when people talk of socialism. Fits!"</p>
<p>The initial laughed in a general kind of way.</p>
<p>The curate said there was socialism AND socialism, and looked at</p>
<p>Margaret to gauge whether he had been too bold in this utterance.</p>
<p>But she was all, he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1459">perceived</a>, for broad-mindness, and he stirred</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1460">himself</a> (and incidentally his tea) to still more liberality of</p>
<p>expression. He said the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1461">state</a> of the poor was appalling, simply</p>
<p>appalling; that there were times when he wanted to shatter the whole</p>
<p>system, "only," he said, turning to me appealingly, "What have we</p>
<p>got to put in its place?"</p>
<p>"The thing that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1462">exists</a> is always the more evident alternative," I</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>The little curate looked at it for a moment. "Precisely," he said</p>
<p>explosively, and turned stirring and with his head a little on one</p>
<p>side, to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1463">hear</a> what Margaret was saying.</p>
<p>Margaret was saying, with a swift blush and an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1464">effect</a> of daring,</p>
<p>that she had no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1465">doubt</a> she was a socialist.</p>
<p>"And wearing a gold chain!" said Gertrude, "And drinking out of</p>
<p>eggshell! I like that!"</p>
<p>I came to Margaret's rescue. "It doesn't follow that because one's</p>
<p>a socialist one ought to dress in sackcloth and ashes."</p>
<p>The initial coloured deeply, and having secured my attention by</p>
<p>prodding me slightly with the wrist of the hand that held his</p>
<p>teacup, cleared his throat and suggested that "one ought to be</p>
<p>consistent."</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1466">perceived</a> we were embarked upon a discussion of the elements. We</p>
<p>began an interesting little wrangle one of those crude discussions</p>
<p>of general ideas that are dear to the heart of youth. I and</p>
<p>Margaret supported one another as socialists, Gertrude and Sybil and</p>
<p>the initial maintained an anti-socialist position, the curate</p>
<p>attempted a cross-bench position with an air of intending to come</p>
<p>down upon us presently with a casting vote. He reminded us of a</p>
<p>number of useful principles too often overlooked in argument, that</p>
<p>in a big question like this there was much to be said on both sides,</p>
<p>that if every one did his or her duty to every one about them there</p>
<p>would be no difficulty with social problems at all, that over and</p>
<p>above all enactments we needed moral changes in people <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1467">themselves</a>.</p>
<p>My cousin Gertrude was a difficult controversialist to manage, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1468">being</a></p>
<p>unconscious of inconsistency in statement and absolutely impervious</p>
<p>to reply. Her standpoint was essentially materialistic; she didn't</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1469">see</a> why she shouldn't have a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1470">good</a> time because other people didn't;</p>
<p>they would have a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1470">good</a> time, she was sure, if she didn't. She said</p>
<p>that if we did give up everything we had to other people, they</p>
<p>wouldn't very likely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1471">know</a> what to do with it. She asked if we were</p>
<p>so fond of work-people, why we didn't go and live among them, and</p>
<p>expressed the inflexible persuasion that if we HAD socialism,</p>
<p>everything would be just the same again in ten years' time. She</p>
<p>also threw upon us the imputation of ingratitude for a beautiful</p>
<p>world by saying that so far as she was concerned she didn't want to</p>
<p>upset everything. She was contented with things as they were, thank</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>The discussion led in some way that I don't in the least recall now,</p>
<p>and possibly by abrupt transitions, to a croquet foursome in which</p>
<p>Margaret involved the curate without involving <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1472">herself</a>, and then</p>
<p>stood beside me on the edge of the lawn while the others played. We</p>
<p>watched silently for a moment.</p>
<p>"I HATE that sort of view," she said suddenly in a confidential</p>
<p>undertone, with her delicate pink flush returning.</p>
<p>"It's want of imagination," I said.</p>
<p>"To <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1473">think</a> we are just to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1474">enjoy</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1475">ourselves</a>," she went on; "just to go</p>
<p>on dressing and playing and having meals and spending money!" She</p>
<p>seemed to be referring not simply to my cousins, but to the whole</p>
<p>world of industry and property about us. "But what is one to do?"</p>
<p>she asked. "I do wish I had not had to come down. It's all so</p>
<p>pointless here. There seems to be nothing going forward, no ideas,</p>
<p>no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1476">dreams</a>. No one here seems to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1477">feel</a> quite what I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1477">feel</a>, the sort of</p>
<p>need there is for MEANING in things. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1478">hate</a> things without</p>
<p>meaning."</p>
<p>"Don't you do-local work?"</p>
<p>"I suppose I shall. I suppose I must find something. Do you think-</p>
<p>if one were to attempt some sort of propaganda?"</p>
<p>"Could you-?" I began a little <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1479">doubtfully</a>.</p>
<p>"I suppose I couldn't," she answered, after a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1480">thoughtful</a> moment. "I</p>
<p>suppose it would come to nothing. And yet I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1481">feel</a> there is so much</p>
<p>to be done for the world, so much one ought to be doing… I</p>
<p>want to do something for the world."</p>
<p>I can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1482">see</a> her now as she stood there with her brows nearly frowning,</p>
<p>her blue eyes looking before her, her mouth almost petulant. "One</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1483">feels</a> that there are so many things going on-out of one's reach,"</p>
<p>she said.</p>
<p>I went back in the motor-car with my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1484">mind</a> full of her, the quality</p>
<p>of delicate discontent, the suggestion of exile. Even a kind of</p>
<p>weakness in her was sympathetic. She told tremendously against her</p>
<p>background. She was, I say, like a protesting blue flower upon a</p>
<p>cinder heap. It is curious, too, how she connects and mingles with</p>
<p>the furious quarrel I had with my uncle that very evening. That</p>
<p>came absurdly. Indirectly Margaret was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1485">responsible</a>. My <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1484">mind</a> was</p>
<p>running on ideas she had revived and questions she had set</p>
<p>clamouring, and quite inadvertently in my attempt to find solutions</p>
<p>I talked so as to outrage his profoundest <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1486">feelings</a>…</p>

<p>What a preposterous shindy that was!</p>
<p>I sat with him in the smoking-room, propounding what I considered to</p>
<p>be the most indisputable and non-contentious propositions</p>
<p>conceivable-until, to my infinite amazement, he exploded and called</p>
<p>me a "damned young puppy."</p>
<p>It was seismic.</p>
<p>"Tremendously interesting time," I said, "just in the beginning of</p>
<p>making a civilisation."</p>
<p>"Ah!" he said, with an averted face, and nodded, leaning forward</p>
<p>over his cigar.</p>
<p>I had not the remotest <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1487">thought</a> of annoying him.</p>
<p>"Monstrous muddle of things we have got," I said, "jumbled streets,</p>
<p>ugly population, ugly factories-"</p>
<p>"You'd do a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1488">sight</a> better if you had to do with it," said my uncle,</p>
<p>regarding me askance.</p>
<p>"Not me. But a world that had a collective plan and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1489">knew</a> where it</p>
<p>meant to be going would do a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1490">sight</a> better, anyhow. We're all</p>
<p>swimming in a flood of ill-calculated chances-"</p>
<p>"You'll be making out I organised that business down there-by</p>
<p>chance-next," said my uncle, his voice thick with challenge.</p>
<p>I went on as though I was back in Trinity.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of chance in the making of all great businesses," I</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>My uncle remarked that that showed how much I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1491">knew</a> about businesses.</p>
<p>If chance made businesses, why was it that he always succeeded and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1492">grew</a> while those fools Ackroyd and Sons always took second place?</p>
<p>He showed a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1493">disposition</a> to tell the glorious history of how once</p>
<p>Ackroyd's overshadowed him, and how now he could buy up Ackroyd's</p>
<p>three times over. But I wanted to get out what was in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1494">mind</a>.</p>
<p>"Oh!" I said, "as between man and man and business and business,</p>
<p>some of course get the pull by this quality or that-but it's forces</p>
<p>quite outside the individual case that make the big part of any</p>
<p>success under modern <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1495">conditions</a>. YOU never invented pottery, nor</p>
<p>any process in pottery that matters a rap in your works; it wasn't</p>
<p>YOUR <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1496">foresight</a> that joined all England up with railways and made it</p>
<p>possible to organise production on an altogether different scale.</p>
<p>You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1497">really</a> at the utmost can't take credit for much more than <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1498">being</a></p>
<p>the sort of man who happened to fit what happened to be the</p>
<p>requirements of the time, and who happened to be in a position to</p>
<p>take advantage of them-"</p>
<p>It was then my uncle cried out and called me a damned young puppy,</p>
<p>and became involved in some unexpected trouble of his own.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1499">woke</a> up as it were from my analysis of the situation to discover</p>
<p>him bent over a splendid spittoon, cursing incoherently, retching a</p>
<p>little, and spitting out the end of his cigar which he had bitten</p>
<p>off in his last attempt at <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1500">self-control</a>, and withal fully prepared</p>
<p>as soon as he had cleared for action to give me just all that he</p>
<p>considered to be the contents of his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1501">mind</a> upon the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1502">condition</a> of</p>
<p>mine.</p>
<p>Well, why shouldn't I talk my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1503">mind</a> to him? He'd never had an</p>
<p>outside view of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1504">himself</a> for years, and I resolved to stand up to</p>
<p>him. We went at it hammer and tongs! It became clear that he</p>
<p>supposed me to be a Socialist, a zealous, embittered <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1505">hater</a> of all</p>
<p>ownership-and also an educated man of the vilest, most</p>
<p>pretentiously superior description. His principal grievance was</p>
<p>that I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1506">thought</a> I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1507">knew</a> everything; to that he recurred again and</p>
<p>again…</p>
<p>We had been maintaining an armed truce with each other since my</p>
<p>resolve to go up to Cambridge, and now we had out all that had</p>
<p>accumulated between us. There had been stupendous accumulations…</p>
<p>The particular things we said and did in that bawlmg encounter</p>
<p>matter nothing at all in this story. I can't now estimate how near</p>
<p>we came to fisticuffs. It ended with my saying, after a pungent</p>
<p>reminder of benefits conferred and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1508">remembered</a>, that I didn't want to</p>
<p>stay another hour in his house. I went upstairs, in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1509">state</a> of</p>
<p>puerile fury, to pack and go off to the Railway Hotel, while he,</p>
<p>with ironical civility, telephoned for a cab.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1510">Good</a> riddance!" shouted my uncle, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1511">seeing</a> me off into the night.</p>
<p>On the face of it our row was preposterous, but the underlying</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1512">reality</a> of our quarrel was the essential antagonism, it seemed to</p>
<p>me, in all human affairs, the antagonism between ideas and the</p>
<p>established method, that is to say, between ideas and the rule of</p>
<p>thumb. The world I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1513">hate</a> is the rule-of-thumb world, the thing I and</p>
<p>my kind of people <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1514">exist</a> for primarily is to battle with that, to</p>
<p>annoy it, disarrange it, reconstruct it. We question everything,</p>
<p>disturb anything that cannot give a clear justification to our</p>
<p>questioning, because we believe inherently that our sense of</p>
<p>disorder implies the possibility of a better order. Of course we</p>
<p>are detestable. My uncle was of that other vaster mass who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1515">accept</a></p>
<p>everything for the thing it seems to be, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1513">hate</a> enquiry and analysis</p>
<p>as a tramp <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1513">hates</a> washing, dread and resist change, oppose</p>
<p>experiment, despise science. The world is our battleground; and all</p>
<p>history, all literature that matters, all science, deals with this</p>
<p>conflict of the thing that is and the speculative "if" that will</p>
<p>destroy it.</p>
<p>But that is why I did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1516">see</a> Margaret Seddon again for five years.</p>

<p>CHAPTER THE SECOND</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARGARET IN LONDON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>1</p>
</title>
<p>I was twenty-seven when I met Margaret again, and the intervening</p>
<p>five years had been years of vigorous activity for me, if not of</p>
<p>very remarkable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1517">growth</a>. When I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1518">saw</a> her again, I could count <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1519">myself</a></p>
<p>a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1520">grown</a> man. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1521">think</a>, indeed, I counted <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1519">myself</a> more completely</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1520">grown</a> than I was. At any rate, by all ordinary standards, I had</p>
<p>"got on" very well, and my ideas, if they had not changed very</p>
<p>greatly, had become much more definite and my ambitions clearer and</p>
<p>bolder.</p>
<p>I had long since abandoned my fellowship and come to London. I had</p>
<p>published two books that had been talked about, written several</p>
<p>articles, and established a regular <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1522">relationship</a> with the WEEKLY</p>
<p>REVIEW and the EVENING GAZETTE. I was a member of the Eighty Club</p>
<p>and learning to adapt the style of the Cambridge Union to larger</p>
<p>uses. The London world had opened out to me very readily. I had</p>
<p>developed a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1523">pleasant</a> variety of social connections. I had made the</p>
<p>acquaintance of Mr. Evesham, who had been attracted by my NEW RULER,</p>
<p>and who talked about it and me, and so did a very great deal to make</p>
<p>a way for me into the company of prominent and amusing people. I</p>
<p>dined out quite frequently. The glitter and interest of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1524">good</a> London</p>
<p>dinner parties became a common <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1525">experience</a>. I liked the sort of</p>
<p>conversation one got at them extremely, the little glow of duologues</p>
<p>burning up into more general discussions, the closing-in of the men</p>
<p>after the going of the women, the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1526">sage</a>, substantial masculine</p>
<p>gossiping, the later resumption of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1527">effective</a> talk with some <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1523">pleasant</a></p>
<p>woman, graciously at her best. I had a wide range of houses;</p>
<p>Cambridge had linked me to one or two correlated sets of artistic</p>
<p>and literary people, and my books and Mr. Evesham and opened to me</p>
<p>the big vague world of "society." I wasn't aggressive nor</p>
<p>particularly snobbish nor troublesome, sometimes I talked well, and</p>
<p>if I had nothing interesting to say I said as little as possible,</p>
<p>and I had a youthful gravity of manner that was liked by hostesses.</p>
<p>And the other side of my nature that first flared through the cover</p>
<p>of restraints at Locarno, that too had had opportunity to develop</p>
<p>along the line London renders practicable. I had had my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1525">experiences</a></p>
<p>and secrets and adventures among that fringe of ill-mated or erratic</p>
<p>or discredited women the London world possesses. The thing had long</p>
<p>ago <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1528">ceased</a> to be a matter of magic or mystery, and had become a</p>
<p>question of appetites and excitement, and among other things the</p>
<p>excitement of not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1529">being</a> found out.</p>
<p>I write rather <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1530">doubtfully</a> of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1531">growing</a> during this period. Indeed</p>
<p>I find it hard to judge whether I can say that I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1532">grew</a> at all in any</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1533">real</a> sense of the word, between three and twenty and twenty-seven.</p>
<p>It seems to me now to have been rather a phase of realisation and</p>
<p>clarification. All the broad lines of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1534">thought</a> were laid down, I</p>
<p>am sure, by the date of my Locarno adventure, but in those five</p>
<p>years I discussed things over and over again with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1535">myself</a> and others,</p>
<p>filled out with concrete fact <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1536">forms</a> I had at first apprehended</p>
<p>sketchily and conversationally, measured my powers against my ideals</p>
<p>and the forces in the world about me. It was evident that many men</p>
<p>no better than <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1535">myself</a> and with no greater advantages than mine had</p>
<p>raised <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1537">themselves</a> to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1538">influential</a> and even decisive positions in the</p>
<p>worlds of politics and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1534">thought</a>. I was gathering the confidence and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1539">knowledge</a> necessary to attack the world in the large manner; I found</p>
<p>I could write, and that people would let me write if I chose, as one</p>
<p>having authority and not as the scribes. Socially and politically</p>
<p>and intellectually I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1540">knew</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1535">myself</a> for an honest man, and that quite</p>
<p>without any deliberation on my part this showed and made things easy</p>
<p>for me. People trusted my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1541">good</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1542">faith</a> from the beginning-for all</p>
<p>that I came from nowhere and had no better position than any</p>
<p>adventurer.</p>
<p>But the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1543">growth</a> process was arrested, I was nothing bigger at twenty-</p>
<p>seven than at twenty-two, however much saner and stronger, and any</p>
<p>one looking closely into my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1544">mind</a> during that period might well have</p>
<p>imagined <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1543">growth</a> finished altogether. It is particularly evident to</p>
<p>me now that I came no nearer to any <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1545">understanding</a> of women during</p>
<p>that time. That Locarno affair was infinitely more to me than I had</p>
<p>supposed. It ended something-nipped something in the bud perhaps-</p>
<p>took me at a stride from a vague, fine, ignorant, closed world of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1546">emotion</a> to intrigue and a perfectly definite and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1547">limited</a> sensuality.</p>
<p>It ended my youth, and for a time it prevented my manhood. I had</p>
<p>never yet even peeped at the sweetest, profoundest thing in the</p>
<p>world, the heart and meaning of a girl, or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1548">dreamt</a> with any quality</p>
<p>of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1549">reality</a> of a wife or any such thing as a friend among womanhood.</p>
<p>My vague anticipation of such things in life had vanished</p>
<p>altogether. I turned away from their possibility. It seemed to me</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1550">knew</a> what had to be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1551">known</a> about womankind. I wanted to work hard,</p>
<p>to get on to a position in which I could develop and forward my</p>
<p>constructive projects. Women, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1552">thought</a>, had nothing to do with</p>
<p>that. It seemed clear I could not marry for some years; I was</p>
<p>attractive to certain types of women, I had vanity enough to give me</p>
<p>an agreeable confidence in love-making, and I went about seeking a</p>
<p>convenient mistress quite deliberately, some one who should serve my</p>
<p>purpose and say in the end, like that kindly first mistress of mine,</p>
<p>"I've done you no harm," and so release me. It seemed the only <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1553">wise</a></p>
<p>way of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1554">disposing</a> of urgencies that might otherwise entangle and</p>
<p>wreck the career I was intent upon.</p>
<p>I don't apologise for, or defend my mental and moral phases. So it</p>
<p>was I appraised life and prepared to take it, and so it is a</p>
<p>thousand ambitious men <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1555">see</a> it to-day…</p>
<p>For the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1556">rest</a> these five years were a period of definition. My</p>
<p>political conceptions were perfectly plain and honest. I had one</p>
<p>constant <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1557">desire</a> ruling my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1558">thoughts</a>. I meant to leave England and</p>
<p>the empire better ordered than I found it, to organise and</p>
<p>discipline, to build up a constructive and controlling State out of</p>
<p>my world's confusions. We had, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1559">saw</a>, to suffuse education with</p>
<p>public intention, to develop a new better-living generation with a</p>
<p>collectivist habit of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1558">thought</a>, to link now chaotic activities in</p>
<p>every human affair, and particularly to catch that escaped, world-</p>
<p>making, world-ruining, dangerous thing, industrial and financial</p>
<p>enterprise, and bring it back to the service of the general <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1560">good</a>. I</p>
<p>had then the precise image that still serves me as a symbol for all</p>
<p>I wish to bring about, the image of an engineer building a lock in a</p>
<p>swelling torrent-with water pressure as his only source of power.</p>
<p>My <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1558">thoughts</a> and acts were habitually turned to that enterprise; it</p>
<p>gave shape and direction to all my life. The problem that most</p>
<p>engaged my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1561">mind</a> during those years was the practical and personal</p>
<p>problem of just where to apply <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1562">myself</a> to serve this almost innate</p>
<p>purpose. How was I, a child of this <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1563">confusion</a>, struggling upward</p>
<p>through the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1563">confusion</a>, to take hold of things? Somewhere between</p>
<p>politics and literature my grip must needs be found, but where?</p>
<p>Always I seem to have been looking for that in those opening years,</p>
<p>and disregarding everything else to discover it.</p>

<p>The Baileys, under whose auspices I met Margaret again, were in the</p>
<p>sharpest contrast with the narrow industrialism of the Staffordshire</p>
<p>world. They were indeed at the other extreme of the scale, two</p>
<p>active self-centred people, excessively devoted to the public</p>
<p>service. It was natural I should gravitate to them, for they seemed</p>
<p>to stand for the maturer, more disciplined, better informed</p>
<p>expression of all I was then urgent to attempt to do. The bulk of</p>
<p>their friends were politicians or public officials, they described</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1564">themselves</a> as publicists-a vague yet sufficiently significant term.</p>
<p>They lived and worked in a hard little house in Chambers Street,</p>
<p>Westminster, and made a centre for quite an astonishing amount of</p>
<p>political and social activity.</p>
<p>Willersley took me there one evening. The place was almost</p>
<p>pretentiously matter-of-fact and unassuming. The narrow passage-</p>
<p>hall, papered with some ancient yellowish paper, grained to imitate</p>
<p>wood, was choked with hats and cloaks and an occasional feminine</p>
<p>wrap. Motioned rather than announced by a tall Scotch servant</p>
<p>woman, the only domestic I ever <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1565">remember</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1566">seeing</a> there, we made our</p>
<p>way up a narrow staircase past the open door of a small study packed</p>
<p>with blue-books, to discover Altiora Bailey receiving before the</p>
<p>fireplace in her drawing-room. She was a tall commanding figure,</p>
<p>splendid but a little untidy in black silk and red beads, with dark</p>
<p>eyes that had no depths, with a clear hard voice that had an almost</p>
<p>visible prominence, aquiline features and straight black hair that</p>
<p>was apt to get astray, that was now astray like the head feathers of</p>
<p>an eagle in a gale. She stood with her hands behind her back, and</p>
<p>talked in a high tenor of a projected Town Planning Bill with Blupp,</p>
<p>who was practically in those days the secretary of the local</p>
<p>Government Board. A very short broad man with thick ears and fat</p>
<p>white hands writhing intertwined behind him, stood with his back to</p>
<p>us, eager to bark interruptions into Altiora's discourse. A slender</p>
<p>girl in pale blue, manifestly a young political wife, stood with one</p>
<p>foot on the fender listening with an expression of entirely puzzled</p>
<p>propitiation. A tall sandy-bearded bishop with the expression of a</p>
<p>man in a trance completed this central group.</p>
<p>The room was one of those long apartments once divided by folding</p>
<p>doors, and reaching from back to front, that are common upon the</p>
<p>first floors of London houses. Its walls were hung with two or</p>
<p>three indifferent water colours, there was scarcely any furniture</p>
<p>but a sofa or so and a chair, and the floor, severely carpeted with</p>
<p>matting, was crowded with a curious medley of people, men</p>
<p>predominating. Several were in evening dress, but most had the</p>
<p>morning garb of the politician; the women were either severely</p>
<p>rational or radiantly magnificent. Willersley pointed out to me the</p>
<p>wife of the Secretary of State for War, and I recognised the Duchess</p>
<p>of Clynes, who at that time cultivated intellectuality. I looked</p>
<p>round, identifying a face here or there, and stepping back trod on</p>
<p>some one's toe, and turned to find it belonged to the Right Hon. G.</p>
<p>B. Mottisham, dear to the PUNCH caricaturists. He received my</p>
<p>apology with that intentional charm that is one of his most</p>
<p>delightful traits, and resumed his discussion. Beside him was</p>
<p>Esmeer of Trinity, whom I had not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1567">seen</a> since my Cambridge days…</p>
<p>Willersley found an ex-member of the School Board for whom he had</p>
<p>affinities, and left me to exchange <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1568">experiences</a> and comments upon</p>
<p>the company with Esmeer. Esmeer was still a don; but he was</p>
<p>nibbling, he said, at certain negotiations with the TIMES that might</p>
<p>bring him down to London. He wanted to come to London. "We peep at</p>
<p>things from Cambridge," he said.</p>
<p>"This sort of thing," I said, "makes London necessary. It's the</p>
<p>oddest gathering."</p>
<p>"Every one comes here," said Esmeer. "Mostly we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1569">hate</a> them like</p>
<p>poison-jealousy-and little irritations-Altiora can be a horror at</p>
<p>times-but we HAVE to come."</p>
<p>"Things are <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1570">being</a> done?"</p>
<p>"Oh!-no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1571">doubt</a> of it. It's one of the parts of the British</p>
<p>machinery-that doesn't show… But nobody else could do it.</p>
<p>"Two people," said Esmeer, "who've planned to be a power-in an</p>
<p>original way. And by Jove! they've done it!"</p>
<p>I did not for some time pick out Oscar Bailey, and then Esmeer</p>
<p>showed him to me in elaborately confidential talk in a corner with a</p>
<p>distinguished-looking stranger wearing a ribbon. Oscar had none of</p>
<p>the fine appearance of his wife; he was a short sturdy figure with a</p>
<p>rounded protruding abdomen and a curious broad, flattened, clean-</p>
<p>shaven face that seemed nearly all forehead. He was of Anglo-</p>
<p>Hungarian extraction, and I have always fancied something Mongolian</p>
<p>in his type. He peered up with reddish swollen-looking eyes over</p>
<p>gilt-edged glasses that were divided horizontally into portions of</p>
<p>different refractive power, and he talking in an ingratiating</p>
<p>undertone, with busy thin lips, an eager lisp and nervous movements</p>
<p>of the hand.</p>
<p>People say that thirty years before at Oxford he was almost exactly</p>
<p>the same eager, clever little man he was when I first met him. He</p>
<p>had come up to Balliol bristling with extraordinary degrees and</p>
<p>prizes capturned in provincial and Irish and Scotch universities-</p>
<p>and had made a name for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1572">himself</a> as the most formidable dealer in</p>
<p>exact fact the rhetoricians of the Union had ever had to encounter.</p>
<p>From Oxford he had gone on to a position in the Higher Division of</p>
<p>the Civil Service, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1573">think</a> in the War Office, and had speedily made</p>
<p>a place for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1572">himself</a> as a political journalist. He was a</p>
<p>particularly neat controversialist, and very full of political and</p>
<p>sociological ideas. He had a quite astounding <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1574">memory</a> for facts and</p>
<p>a mastery of detailed analysis, and the time afforded scope for</p>
<p>these gifts. The later eighties were full of politico-social</p>
<p>discussion, and he became a prominent name upon the contents list of</p>
<p>the NINETEENTH CENTURY, the FORTNIGHTLY and CONTEMPORARY chiefly as</p>
<p>a half sympathetic but frequently very damaging critic of the</p>
<p>socialism of that period. He won the immense respect of every one</p>
<p>specially interested in social and political questions, he soon</p>
<p>achieved the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1575">limited</a> distinction that is awarded such capacity, and</p>
<p>at that I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1573">think</a> he would have remained for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1576">rest</a> of his life if</p>
<p>he had not encountered Altiora.</p>
<p>But Altiora Macvitie was an altogether exceptional woman, an</p>
<p>extraordinary mixture of qualities, the one woman in the world who</p>
<p>could make something more out of Bailey than that. She had much of</p>
<p>the vigour and handsomeness of a slender impudent young man, and an</p>
<p>unscrupulousness altogether feminine. She was one of those women</p>
<p>who are waiting in-what is the word?-muliebrity. She had courage</p>
<p>and initiative and a philosophical way of handling questions, and</p>
<p>she could be bored by regular work like a man. She was entirely</p>
<p>unfitted for her sex's sphere. She was neither uncertain, coy nor</p>
<p>hard to please, and altogether too stimulating and aggressive for</p>
<p>any gentleman's hours of ease. Her cookery would have been about as</p>
<p>sketchy as her handwriting, which was generally quite illegible, and</p>
<p>she would have made, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1577">feel</a> sure, a shocking bad nurse. Yet you</p>
<p>mustn't imagine she was an inelegant or unbeautiful woman, and she</p>
<p>is inconceivable to me in high collars or any sort of masculine</p>
<p>garment. But her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1578">soul</a> was bony, and at the base of her was a vanity</p>
<p>gaunt and greedy! When she wasn't in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1579">state</a> of personal untidiness</p>
<p>that was partly a protest against the waste of hours exacted by the</p>
<p>toilet and partly a natural disinclination, she had a gypsy</p>
<p>splendour of black and red and silver all her own. And somewhen in</p>
<p>the early nineties she met and married Bailey.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1580">know</a> very little about her early years. She was the only daughter</p>
<p>of Sir Deighton Macvitie, who applied the iodoform process to</p>
<p>cotton, and only his subsequent unfortunate attempts to become a</p>
<p>Cotton King prevented her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1581">being</a> a very rich woman. As it was she</p>
<p>had a tolerable independence. She came into prominence as one of</p>
<p>the more able of the little shoal of young women who were led into</p>
<p>politico-philanthropic activities by the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1582">influence</a> of the earlier</p>
<p>novels of Mrs. Humphry Ward-the Marcella crop. She went</p>
<p>"slumming" with distinguished vigour, which was quite usual in those</p>
<p>days-and returned from her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1583">experiences</a> as an amateur flower girl</p>
<p>with clear and original views about the problem-which is and always</p>
<p>had been unusual. She had not married, I suppose because her</p>
<p>standards were high, and men are cowards and with an instinctive</p>
<p>appetite for muliebrity. She had kept house for her father by</p>
<p>speaking occasionally to the housekeeper, butler and cook her mother</p>
<p>had left her, and gathering the most interesting dinner parties she</p>
<p>could, and had married off four orphan nieces in a harsh and</p>
<p>successful manner. After her father's smash and death she came out</p>
<p>as a writer upon social questions and a scathing critic of the</p>
<p>Charity Organisation Society, and she was three and thirty and a</p>
<p>little at loose ends when she met Oscar Bailey, so to speak, in the</p>
<p>CONTEMPORARY REVIEW. The lurking woman in her nature was fascinated</p>
<p>by the ease and precision with which the little man rolled over all</p>
<p>sorts of important and authoritative people, she was the first to</p>
<p>discover a sort of imaginative bigness in his still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1584">growing</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1585">mind</a>,</p>
<p>the forehead perhaps carried him off physically, and she took</p>
<p>occasion to meet and subjugate him, and, so soon as he had</p>
<p>sufficiently recovered from his abject humility and a certain panic</p>
<p>at her attentions, marry him.</p>
<p>This had opened a new phase in the lives of Bailey and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1586">herself</a>. The</p>
<p>two supplemented each other to an extraordinary extent. Their</p>
<p>subsequent career was, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1587">think</a>, almost entirely her invention. She</p>
<p>was aggressive, imaginative, and had a great capacity for ideas,</p>
<p>while he was almost destitute of initiative, and could do nothing</p>
<p>with ideas except <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1588">remember</a> and discuss them. She was, if not exact,</p>
<p>at least indolent, with a strong <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1589">disposition</a> to save energy by</p>
<p>sketching-even her handwriting showed that-while he was</p>
<p>inexhaustibly industrious with a relentless invariable caligraphy</p>
<p>that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1590">grew</a> larger and clearer as the years passed by. She had a</p>
<p>considerable power of charming; she could be just as nice to people-</p>
<p>and incidentally just as nasty-as she wanted to be. He was always</p>
<p>just the same, a little confidential and SOTTO VOCE, artlessly rude</p>
<p>and egoistic in an undignified way. She had considerable social</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1591">experience</a>, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1592">good</a> social connections, and considerable social</p>
<p>ambition, while he had none of these things. She <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1593">saw</a> in a flash her</p>
<p>opportunity to redeem his defects, use his powers, and do large,</p>
<p>novel, rather startling things. She ran him. Her marriage, which</p>
<p>shocked her friends and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1594">relations</a> beyond measure-for a time they</p>
<p>would only speak of Bailey as "that gnome"-was a stroke of genius,</p>
<p>and forthwith they proceeded to make <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1595">themselves</a> the most formidable</p>
<p>and distinguished couple conceivable. P. B. P., she boasted, was</p>
<p>engraved inside their wedding rings, Pro Bono Publico, and she meant</p>
<p>it to be no idle threat. She had discovered very early that the</p>
<p>last thing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1596">influential</a> people will do is to work. Everything in</p>
<p>their lives tends to make them dependent upon a supply of</p>
<p>confidently administered detail. Their business is with the window</p>
<p>and not the stock behind, and in the end they are dependent upon the</p>
<p>stock behind for what goes into the window. She linked with that</p>
<p>the fact that Bailey had a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1597">mind</a> as orderly as a museum, and an</p>
<p>invincible power over detail. She <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1593">saw</a> that if two people took the</p>
<p>necessary <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1598">pains</a> to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1599">know</a> the facts of government and administration</p>
<p>with precision, to gather together <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1600">knowledge</a> that was dispersed and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1601">confused</a>, to be able to say precisely what had to be done and what</p>
<p>avoided in this eventuality or that, they would necessarily become a</p>
<p>centre of reference for all sorts of legislative proposals and</p>
<p>political expedients, and she went unhesitatingly upon that.</p>
<p>Bailey, under her vigorous direction, threw up his post in the Civil</p>
<p>Service and abandoned sporadic controversies, and they devoted</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1602">themselves</a> to the elaboration and realisation of this centre of</p>
<p>public information she had conceived as their role. They set out to</p>
<p>study the methods and organisation and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1603">realities</a> of government in</p>
<p>the most elaborate manner. They did the work as no one had ever</p>
<p>hitherto <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1604">dreamt</a> of doing it. They planned the research on a</p>
<p>thoroughly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1605">satisfying</a> scale, and arranged their lives almost</p>
<p>entirely for it. They took that house in Chambers Street and</p>
<p>furnished it with severe economy, they discovered that Scotch</p>
<p>domestic who is destined to be the guardian and tyrant of their</p>
<p>declining years, and they set to work. Their first book, "The</p>
<p>Permanent Official," fills three plump volumes, and took them and</p>
<p>their two secretaries upwards of four years to do. It is an</p>
<p>amazingly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1606">good</a> book, an enduring achievement. In a hundred</p>
<p>directions the history and the administrative treatment of the</p>
<p>public service was clarified for all time…</p>
<p>They worked regularly every morning from nine to twelve, they</p>
<p>lunched lightly but severely, in the afternoon they "took exercise"</p>
<p>or Bailey attended meetings of the London School Board, on which he</p>
<p>served, he said, for the purposes of study-he also became a railway</p>
<p>director for the same end. In the late afternoon Altiora was at</p>
<p>home to various callers, and in the evening came dinner or a</p>
<p>reception or both.</p>
<p>Her dinners and gatherings were a very important feature in their</p>
<p>scheme. She got together all sorts of interesting people in or</p>
<p>about the public service, she mixed the obscurely efficient with the</p>
<p>ill-instructed famous and the rudderless rich, got together in one</p>
<p>room more of the factors in our strange jumble of a public life than</p>
<p>had ever met easily before. She fed them with a shameless austerity</p>
<p>that kept the conversation brilliant, on a soup, a plain fish, and</p>
<p>mutton or boiled fowl and milk pudding, with nothing to drink but</p>
<p>whisky and soda, and hot and cold water, and milk and lemonade.</p>
<p>Everybody was soon very glad indeed to come to that. She boasted</p>
<p>how little her housekeeping cost her, and sought constantly for</p>
<p>fresh economies that would enable her, she said, to sustain an</p>
<p>additional private secretary. Secretaries were the Baileys' one</p>
<p>extravagance, they loved to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1607">think</a> of searches going on in the</p>
<p>British Museum, and letters <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1608">being</a> cleared up and precis made</p>
<p>overhead, while they sat in the little study and worked together,</p>
<p>Bailey with a clockwork industry, and Altiora in splendid flashes</p>
<p>between intervals of cigarettes and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1609">meditation</a>. "All efficient</p>
<p>public careers," said Altiora, "consist in the proper direction of</p>
<p>secretaries."</p>
<p>"If everything goes well I shall have another secretary next year,"</p>
<p>Altiora told me. "I wish I could refuse people dinner napkins.</p>
<p>Imagine what it means in washing! I dare most things… But as</p>
<p>it is, they stand a lot of hardship here."</p>
<p>"There's something of the miser in both these people," said Esmeer,</p>
<p>and the thing was perfectly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1610">true</a>. For, after all, the miser is</p>
<p>nothing more than a man who either through want of imagination or</p>
<p>want of suggestion misapplies to a base use a natural power of</p>
<p>concentration upon one end. The concentration itself is neither</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1611">good</a> nor evil, but a power that can be used in either way. And the</p>
<p>Baileys gathered and reinvested usuriously not money, but <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1612">knowledge</a></p>
<p>of the utmost value in human affairs. They produced an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1613">effect</a> of</p>
<p>having found themselves-completely. One envied them at times</p>
<p>extraordinarily. I was attracted, I was dazzled-and at the same</p>
<p>time there was something about Bailey's big wrinkled forehead, his</p>
<p>lisping broad mouth, the gestures of his hands and an uncivil</p>
<p>preoccupation I could not endure…</p>

<p>Their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1614">effect</a> upon me was from the outset very considerable.</p>
<p>Both of them found occasion on that first visit of mine to talk to</p>
<p>me about my published writings and particularly about my then just</p>
<p>published book THE NEW RULER, which had interested them very much.</p>
<p>It fell in indeed so closely with their own way of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1615">thinking</a> that I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1616">doubt</a> if they ever <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1617">understood</a> how independently I had arrived at my</p>
<p>conclusions. It was their weakness to claim excessively. That</p>
<p>irritation, however, came later. We discovered each other</p>
<p>immensely; for a time it produced a tremendous sense of kindred and</p>
<p>cooperation.</p>
<p>Altiora, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1618">remember</a>, maintained that there <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1619">existed</a> a great army of</p>
<p>such constructive-minded people as ourselves-as yet undiscovered by</p>
<p>one another.</p>
<p>"It's like boring a tunnel through a mountain," said Oscar, "and</p>
<p>presently <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1620">hearing</a> the tapping of the workers from the other end."</p>
<p>"If you didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1621">know</a> of them beforehand," I said, "it might be a</p>
<p>rather badly joined tunnel."</p>
<p>"Exactly," said Altiora with a high note, "and that's why we all</p>
<p>want to find out each other…"</p>
<p>They didn't talk like that on our first encounter, but they urged me</p>
<p>to lunch with them next day, and then it was we went into things. A</p>
<p>woman Factory Inspector and the Educational Minister for New</p>
<p>Banksland and his wife were also there, but I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1622">remember</a> they</p>
<p>made any contribution to the conversation. The Baileys <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1623">saw</a> to that.</p>
<p>They kept on at me in an urgent litigious way.</p>
<p>"We have read your book," each began-as though it had been a joint</p>
<p>function. "And we consider-"</p>
<p>"Yes," I protested, "I think-"</p>
<p>That was a secondary matter.</p>
<p>"They did not consider," said Altiora, raising her voice and going</p>
<p>right over me, that I had allowed sufficiently for the inevitable</p>
<p>development of an official administrative class in the modern</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1624">state</a>."</p>
<p>"Nor of its importance," echoed Oscar.</p>
<p>That, they explained in a sort of chorus, was the cardinal idea of</p>
<p>their lives, what they were up to, what they stood for. "We want to</p>
<p>suggest to you," they said-and I found this was a stock opening of</p>
<p>theirs-"that from the mere necessities of convenience elected</p>
<p>bodies MUST avail <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1625">themselves</a> more and more of the services of expert</p>
<p>officials. We have that very much in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1626">mind</a>. The more complicated</p>
<p>and technical affairs become, the less confidence will the elected</p>
<p>official have in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1627">himself</a>. We want to suggest that these expert</p>
<p>officials must necessarily develop into a new class and a very</p>
<p>powerful class in the community. We want to organise that. It may</p>
<p>be THE power of the future. They will necessarily have to have very</p>
<p>much of a common training. We consider <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1628">ourselves</a> as amateur unpaid</p>
<p>precursors of such a class."…</p>
<p>The vision they displayed for my consideration as the aim of public-</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1629">spirited</a> endeavour, seemed like a harder, narrower, more specialised</p>
<p>version of the idea of a trained and disciplined <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1630">state</a> that</p>
<p>Willersley and I had worked out in the Alps. They wanted things</p>
<p>more organised, more correlated with government and a collective</p>
<p>purpose, just as we did, but they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1631">saw</a> it not in terms of a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1632">growing</a></p>
<p>collective <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1633">understanding</a>, but in terms of functionaries, legislative</p>
<p>change, and methods of administration…</p>
<p>It wasn't clear at first how we differed. The Baileys were very</p>
<p>anxious to win me to co-operation, and I was quite prepared at first</p>
<p>to identify their distinctive expressions with phrases of my own,</p>
<p>and so we came very readily into an alliance that was to last some</p>
<p>years, and break at last very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1634">painfully</a>. Altiora manifestly liked</p>
<p>me, I was soon discussing with her the perplexity I found in placing</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1635">myself</a> efficiently in the world, the problem of how to take hold of</p>
<p>things that occupied my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1636">thoughts</a>, and she was sketching out careers</p>
<p>for my consideration, very much as an architect on his first visit</p>
<p>sketches houses, considers requirements, and puts before you this</p>
<p>example and that of the more or less similar thing already done…</p>

<p>It is easy to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1637">see</a> how much in common there was between the Baileys</p>
<p>and me, and how natural it was that I should become a constant</p>
<p>visitor at their house and an ally of theirs in many enterprises.</p>
<p>It is not nearly so easy to define the profound antagonism of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1638">spirit</a></p>
<p>that also held between us. There was a difference in texture, a</p>
<p>difference in quality. How can I express it? The shapes of our</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1639">thoughts</a> were the same, but the substance quite different. It was</p>
<p>as if they had made in china or cast iron what I had made in</p>
<p>transparent living matter. (The comparison is manifestly from my</p>
<p>point of view.) Certain things never seemed to show through their</p>
<p>ideas that were visible, refracted perhaps and distorted, but</p>
<p>visible always through mine.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1640">thought</a> for a time the essential difference lay in our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1641">relation</a> to</p>
<p>beauty. With me beauty is quite primary in life; I like <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1642">truth</a>,</p>
<p>order and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1643">goodness</a>, wholly because they are beautiful or lead</p>
<p>straight to beautiful consequences. The Baileys either hadn't got</p>
<p>that or they didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1644">see</a> it. They seemed at times to prefer things</p>
<p>harsh and ugly. That puzzled me extremely. The esthetic quality of</p>
<p>many of their proposals, the "manners" of their work, so to speak,</p>
<p>were at times as dreadful as-well, War Office barrack architecture.</p>
<p>A caricature by its exaggerated statements will sometimes serve to</p>
<p>point a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1642">truth</a> by antagonising falsity and falsity. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1645">remember</a></p>
<p>talking to a prominent museum official in need of more public funds</p>
<p>for the work he had in hand. I mentioned the possibility of</p>
<p>enlisting Bailey's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1646">influence</a>.</p>
<p>"Oh, we don't want Philistines like that infernal Bottle-Imp running</p>
<p>us," he said hastily, and would <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1647">hear</a> of no concerted action for the</p>
<p>end he had in view. "I'd rather not have the extension.</p>
<p>"You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1648">see</a>," he went on to explain, "Bailey's wanting in the</p>
<p>essentials."</p>
<p>"What essentials?" said I.</p>
<p>"Oh! he'd be like a nasty oily efficient little machine for some</p>
<p>merely subordinate necessity among all my delicate stuff. He'd do</p>
<p>all we wanted no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1649">doubt</a> in the way of money and powers-and he'd do</p>
<p>it wrong and mess the place for ever. Hands all black, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1650">know</a>.</p>
<p>He's just a means. Just a very aggressive and unmanageable means.</p>
<p>This isn't a plumber's job…"</p>
<p>I stuck to my argument.</p>
<p>"I don't LIKE him," said the official conclusively, and it seemed to</p>
<p>me at the time he was just blind prejudice speaking…</p>
<p>I came nearer the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1651">truth</a> of the matter as I came to realise that our</p>
<p>philosophies differed profoundly. That isn't a very curable</p>
<p>difference,-once people have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1652">grown</a> up. Theirs was a philosophy</p>
<p>devoid of FINESSE. Temperamentally the Baileys were specialised,</p>
<p>concentrated, accurate, while <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1653">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1654">am</a> urged either by some Inner force</p>
<p>or some entirely assimilated <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1655">influence</a> in my training, always to</p>
<p>round off and shadow my outlines. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1656">hate</a> them hard. I would</p>
<p>sacrifice detail to modelling always, and the Baileys, it seemed to</p>
<p>me, loved a world as flat and metallic as Sidney Cooper's cows. If</p>
<p>they had the universe in hand I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1657">know</a> they would take down all the</p>
<p>trees and put up stamped tin green shades and sunlight accumulators.</p>
<p>Altiora <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1658">thought</a> trees hopelessly irregular and sea cliffs a great</p>
<p>mistake… I got things clearer as time went on. Though it</p>
<p>was an Hegelian mess of which I had partaken at Codger's table by</p>
<p>way of a philosophical training, my sympathies have always been</p>
<p>Pragmatist. I belong almost by nature to that school of Pragmatism</p>
<p>that, following the medieval Nominalists, bases itself upon a denial</p>
<p>of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1659">reality</a> of classes, and of the validity of general laws. The</p>
<p>Baileys classified everything. They were, in the scholastic sense-</p>
<p>which so oddly contradicts the modern use of the word-"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1660">Realists</a>."</p>
<p>They believed classes were REAL and independent of their</p>
<p>individuals. This is the common habit of all so-called educated</p>
<p>people who have no metaphysical aptitude and no metaphysical</p>
<p>training. It leads them to a progressive misunderstanding of the</p>
<p>world. It was a favourite trick of Altiora's to speak of everybody</p>
<p>as a "type"; she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1661">saw</a> men as samples moving; her dining-room became a</p>
<p>chamber of representatives. It gave a tremendously scientific air</p>
<p>to many of their generalisations, using "scientific" in its</p>
<p>nineteenth-century uncritical Herbert Spencer sense, an air that</p>
<p>only began to disappear when you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1658">thought</a> them over again in terms of</p>
<p>actuality and the people one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1662">knew</a>…</p>
<p>At the Baileys' one always seemed to be getting one's hands on the</p>
<p>very strings that guided the world. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1663">heard</a> legislation projected</p>
<p>to affect this "type" and that; statistics marched by you with sin</p>
<p>and shame and injustice and misery reduced to quite manageable</p>
<p>percentages, you found men who were to frame or amend bills in grave</p>
<p>and intimate exchange with Bailey's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1664">omniscience</a>, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1663">heard</a> Altiora</p>
<p>canvassing approaching resignations and possible appointments that</p>
<p>might make or mar a revolution in administrative methods, and doing</p>
<p>it with a vigorous directness that manifestly swayed the decision;</p>
<p>and you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1665">felt</a> you were in a sort of signal box with levers all about</p>
<p>you, and the world outside there, albeit a little dark and</p>
<p>mysterious beyond the window, running on its lines in ready</p>
<p>obedience to these unhesitating lights, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1666">true</a> and steady to trim</p>
<p>termini.</p>
<p>And then with all this administrative fizzle, this pseudo-scientific</p>
<p>administrative chatter, dying away in your head, out you went into</p>
<p>the limitless grimy chaos of London streets and squares, roads and</p>
<p>avenues lined with teeming houses, each larger than the Chambers</p>
<p>Street house and at least equally alive, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1667">saw</a> the chaotic clamour</p>
<p>of hoardings, the jumble of traffic, the coming and going of</p>
<p>mysterious myriads, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1668">heard</a> the rumble of traffic like the noise</p>
<p>of a torrent; a vague incessant murmur of cries and voices, wanton</p>
<p>crimes and accidents bawled at you from the placards; imperative</p>
<p>unaccountable fashions swaggered triumphant in dazzling windows of</p>
<p>the shops; and you found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1669">yourself</a> swaying back to the opposite</p>
<p>conviction that the huge <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1670">formless</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1671">spirit</a> of the world it was that</p>
<p>held the strings and danced the puppets on the Bailey stage…</p>
<p>Under the lamps you were jostled by people like my Staffordshire</p>
<p>uncle out for a spree, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1672">saw</a> shy youths conversing with</p>
<p>prostitutes, you passed young lovers pairing with an entire</p>
<p>disregard of the social suitability of the "types" they might blend</p>
<p>or create, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1672">saw</a> men leaning drunken against lamp-posts whom you</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1673">knew</a> for the "type" that will charge with fixed bayonets into the</p>
<p>face of death, and you found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1674">yourself</a> unable to imagine little</p>
<p>Bailey achieving either drunkenness or the careless defiance of</p>
<p>annihilation. You realised that quite a lot of types were</p>
<p>underrepresented in Chambers Street, that feral and obscure and</p>
<p>altogether monstrous forces must be at work, as yet altogether</p>
<p>unassimilated by those neat administrative reorganisations.</p>

</title>
<p>Altiora, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1675">remember</a>, preluded Margaret's reappearance by announcing</p>
<p>her as a "new type."</p>
<p>I was accustomed to go early to the Baileys' dinners in those days,</p>
<p>for a preliminary gossip with Altiora in front of her drawing-room</p>
<p>fire. One got her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1676">alone</a>, and that early arrival was a little sign</p>
<p>of appreciation she valued. She had every woman's need of followers</p>
<p>and servants.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1677">I'm</a> going to send you down to-night," she said, "with a very</p>
<p>interesting type indeed-one of the new generation of serious gals.</p>
<p>Middle-class origin-and quite well off. Rich in fact. Her step-</p>
<p>father was a solicitor and something of an ENTREPRENEUR towards the</p>
<p>end, I fancy-in the Black Country. There was a little brother</p>
<p>died, and she's lost her mother quite recently. Quite on her own,</p>
<p>so to speak. She's never been out into society very much, and</p>
<p>doesn't seem <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1678">really</a> very anxious to go… Not exactly an</p>
<p>intellectual person, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1679">know</a>, but <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1680">quiet</a>, and great force of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1681">character</a>. Came up to London on her own and came to us-someone had</p>
<p>told her we were the sort of people to advise her-to ask what to</p>
<p>do. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1677">I'm</a> sure she'll interest you."</p>
<p>"What CAN people of that sort do?" I asked. "Is she capable of</p>
<p>investigation?"</p>
<p>Altiora compressed her lips and shook her head. She always did</p>
<p>shake her head when you asked that of anyone.</p>
<p>"Of course what she ought to do," said Altiora, with her silk dress</p>
<p>pulled back from her knee before the fire, and with a lift of her</p>
<p>voice towards a chuckle at her daring way of putting things, "is to</p>
<p>marry a member of Parliament and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1682">see</a> he does his work…</p>
<p>Perhaps she will. It's a very exceptional gal who can do anything</p>
<p>by herself-quite exceptional. The more serious they are-without</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1683">being</a> exceptional-the more we want them to marry."</p>
<p>Her exposition was truncated by the entry of the type in question.</p>
<p>"Well!" cried Altiora turning, and with a high note of welcome,</p>
<p>"HERE you are!"</p>
<p>Margaret had gained in dignity and prettiness by the lapse of five</p>
<p>years, and she was now very beautifully and richly and simply</p>
<p>dressed. Her fair hair had been done in some way that made it seem</p>
<p>softer and more abundant than it was in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1684">memory</a>, and a gleam of</p>
<p>purple velvet-set diamonds showed amidst its mist of little golden</p>
<p>and brown lines. Her dress was of white and violet, the last trace</p>
<p>of mourning for her mother, and confessed the gracious droop of her</p>
<p>tall and slender body. She did not suggest Staffordshire at all,</p>
<p>and I was puzzled for a moment to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1685">think</a> where I had met her. Her</p>
<p>sweetly shaped mouth with the slight obliquity of the lip and the</p>
<p>little kink in her brow were extraordinarily familiar to me. But</p>
<p>she had either been prepared by Altiora or she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1684">remembered</a> my name.</p>
<p>"We met," she said, "while my step-father was alive-at Misterton.</p>
<p>You came to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1686">see</a> us"; and instantly I recalled the sunshine between</p>
<p>the apple blossom and a slender pale blue girlish shape among the</p>
<p>daffodils, like something that had sprung from a bulb itself. I</p>
<p>recalled at once that I had found her very interesting, though I did</p>
<p>not clearly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1687">remember</a> how it was she had interested me.</p>
<p>Other guests arrived-it was one of Altiora's boldly blended</p>
<p>mixtures of people with ideas and people with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1688">influence</a> or money who</p>
<p>might perhaps be expected to resonate to them. Bailey came down</p>
<p>late with an air of hurry, and was introduced to Margaret and said</p>
<p>absolutely nothing to her-there <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1689">being</a> no information either to</p>
<p>receive or impart and nothing to do-but stood snatching his left</p>
<p>cheek until I rescued him and her, and left him free to congratulate</p>
<p>the new Lady Snape on her husband's K. C. B.</p>
<p>I took Margaret down. We achieved no feats of mutual expression,</p>
<p>except that it was abundantly clear we were both very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1690">pleased</a> and</p>
<p>interested to meet again, and that we had both kept <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1691">memories</a> of each</p>
<p>other. We made that Misterton tea-party and the subsequent</p>
<p>marriages of my cousins and the world of Burslem generally, matter</p>
<p>for quite an agreeable conversation until at last Altiora, following</p>
<p>her invariable custom, called me by name imperatively out of our</p>
<p>duologue. "Mr. Remington," she said, "we want your opinion-" in</p>
<p>her entirely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1692">characteristic</a> effort to get all the threads of</p>
<p>conversation into her own hands for the climax that always wound up</p>
<p>her dinners. How the other women used to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1693">hate</a> those concluding</p>
<p>raids of hers! I forget most of the other people at that dinner,</p>
<p>nor can I recall what the crowning rally was about. It didn't in</p>
<p>any way join on to my impression of Margaret.</p>
<p>In the drawing-room of the matting floor I rejoined her, with</p>
<p>Altiora's manifest connivance, and in the interval I had been</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1694">thinking</a> of our former meeting.</p>
<p>"Do you find London," I asked, "give you more opportunity for doing</p>
<p>things and learning things than Burslem?"</p>
<p>She showed at once she appreciated my allusion to her former</p>
<p>confidences. "I was very discontented then," she said and paused.</p>
<p>"I've <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1695">really</a> only been in London for a few months. It's so</p>
<p>different. In Burslem, life seems all business and getting-without</p>
<p>any reason. One went on and it didn't seem to mean anything. At</p>
<p>least anything that mattered… London seems to be so full of</p>
<p>meanings-all mixed up together."</p>
<p>She knitted her brows over her words and smiled appealingly at the</p>
<p>end as if for consideration for her inadequate expression,</p>
<p>appealingly and almost humorously.</p>
<p>I looked <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1696">understandingly</a> at her. "We have all," I agreed, "to come</p>
<p>to London."</p>
<p>"One <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1697">sees</a> so much distress," she added, as if she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1698">felt</a> she had</p>
<p>completely omitted something, and needed a codicil.</p>
<p>"What are you doing in London?"</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1699">I'm</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1700">thinking</a> of studying. Some social question. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1701">thought</a> perhaps</p>
<p>I might go and study social <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1702">conditions</a> as Mrs. Bailey did, go</p>
<p>perhaps as a work-girl or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1703">see</a> the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1704">reality</a> of living in, but Mrs.</p>
<p>Bailey <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1701">thought</a> perhaps it wasn't quite my work."</p>
<p>"Are you studying?"</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1705">I'm</a> going to a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1706">good</a> many lectures, and perhaps I shall take up a</p>
<p>regular course at the Westminster School of Politics and Sociology.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Bailey doesn't seem to believe very much in that either."</p>
<p>Her faintly whimsical smile returned. "I seem rather indefinite,"</p>
<p>she apologised, "but one does not want to get entangled in things</p>
<p>one can't do. One-one has so many advantages, one's life seems to</p>
<p>be such a trust and such a responsibility-"</p>
<p>She stopped.</p>
<p>"A man gets driven into work," I said.</p>
<p>"It must be splendid to be Mrs. Bailey," she replied with a glance</p>
<p>of envious admiration across the room.</p>
<p>"SHE has no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1707">doubts</a>, anyhow," I remarked.</p>
<p>"She HAD," said Margaret with the pride of one who has received</p>
<p>great confidences.</p>

<p>"You've met before?" said Altiora, a day or so later.</p>
<p>I explained when.</p>
<p>"You find her interesting?"</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1708">saw</a> in a flash that Altiora meant to marry me to Margaret.</p>
<p>Her intention became much clearer as the year developed. Altiora</p>
<p>was systematic even in matters that evade system. I was to marry</p>
<p>Margaret, and freed from the need of making an income I was to come</p>
<p>into politics-as an exponent of Baileyism. She put it down with</p>
<p>the other excellent and advantageous things that should occupy her</p>
<p>summer holiday. It was her pride and glory to put things down and</p>
<p>plan them out in detail beforehand, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1709">I'm</a> not quite sure that she</p>
<p>did not even mark off the day upon which the engagement was to be</p>
<p>declared. If she did, I disappointed her. We didn't come to an</p>
<p>engagement, in spite of the broadest hints and the glaring</p>
<p>obviousness of everything, that summer.</p>
<p>Every summer the Baileys went out of London to some house they hired</p>
<p>or borrowed, leaving their secretaries toiling behind, and they went</p>
<p>on working hard in the mornings and evenings and taking exercise in</p>
<p>the open air in the afternoon. They <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1710">cycled</a> assiduously and went for</p>
<p>long walks at a trot, and raided and studied (and incidentally</p>
<p>explained <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1711">themselves</a> to) any social "types" that lived in the</p>
<p>neighbourhood. One invaded type, resentful under research,</p>
<p>described them with a dreadful aptness as Donna Quixote and Sancho</p>
<p>Panza-and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1712">himself</a> as a harmless windmill, hurting no one and</p>
<p>signifying nothing. She did rather tilt at things. This particular</p>
<p>summer they were at a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1713">pleasant</a> farmhouse in level country near</p>
<p>Pangbourne, belonging to the Hon. Wilfrid Winchester, and they asked</p>
<p>me to come down to rooms in the neighbourhood-Altiora took them for</p>
<p>a month for me in August-and board with them upon extremely</p>
<p>reasonable terms; and when I got there I found Margaret sitting in a</p>
<p>hammock at Altiora's feet. Lots of people, I gathered, were coming</p>
<p>and going in the neighbourhood, the Ponts were in a villa on the</p>
<p>river, and the Rickhams' houseboat was to moor for some days; but</p>
<p>these irruptions did not impede a great deal of duologue between</p>
<p>Margaret and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1714">myself</a>.</p>
<p>Altiora was efficient rather than artistic in her match-making. She</p>
<p>sent us off for long walks together-Margaret was a fairly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1715">good</a></p>
<p>walker-she exhumed some defective croquet things and incited us to</p>
<p>croquet, not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1716">understanding</a> that detestable game is the worst</p>
<p>stimulant for lovers in the world. And Margaret and I were always</p>
<p>getting left about, and finding <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1717">ourselves</a> for odd half-hours in the</p>
<p>kitchen-garden with nothing to do except talk, or we were told with</p>
<p>a wave of the hand to run away and amuse each other.</p>
<p>Altiora even tried a picnic in canoes, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1718">knowing</a> from fiction rather</p>
<p>than imagination or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1719">experience</a> the conclusive nature of such</p>
<p>excursions. But there she fumbled at the last moment, and elected</p>
<p>at the river's brink to share a canoe with me. Bailey showed so</p>
<p>much zeal and so little skill-his hat fell off and he became</p>
<p>miraculously nothing but paddle-clutching hands and a vast wrinkled</p>
<p>brow-that at last he had to be paddled ignominiously by Margaret,</p>
<p>while Altiora, after a phase of rigid discretion, as nearly as</p>
<p>possible drowned herself-and me no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1720">doubt</a> into the bargain-with a</p>
<p>sudden lateral gesture of the arm to emphasise the high note with</p>
<p>which she dismissed the efficiency of the Charity Organisation</p>
<p>Society. We shipped about an inch of water and sat in it for the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1721">rest</a> of the time, an inconvenience she disregarded heroically. We</p>
<p>had difficulties in landing Oscar from his frail craft upon the ait</p>
<p>of our feasting,-he didn't balance sideways and was much alarmed,</p>
<p>and afterwards, as Margaret had a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1722">pain</a> in her back, I took him in my</p>
<p>canoe, let him hide his shame with an ineffectual but not positively</p>
<p>harmful paddle, and towed the other by means of the joined painters.</p>
<p>Still it was the fault of the inadequate information supplied in the</p>
<p>books and not of Altiora that that was not the date of my betrothal.</p>
<p>I find it not a little difficult to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1723">state</a> what kept me back from</p>
<p>proposing marriage to Margaret that summer, and what urged me</p>
<p>forward at last to marry her. It is so much easier to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1724">remember</a></p>
<p>one's resolutions than to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1724">remember</a> the moods and suggestions that</p>
<p>produced them.</p>
<p>Marrying and getting married was, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1725">think</a>, a pretty simple affair to</p>
<p>Altiora; it was something that happened to the adolescent and</p>
<p>unmarried when you threw them together under the circumstances of</p>
<p>health, warmth and leisure. It happened with the kindly and</p>
<p>approving smiles of the more <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1726">experienced</a> elders who had organised</p>
<p>these proximities. The young people married, settled down, children</p>
<p>ensued, and father and mother turned their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1727">minds</a>, now decently and</p>
<p>properly disillusioned, to other things. That to Altiora was the</p>
<p>normal sexual life, and she believed it to be the quality of the</p>
<p>great bulk of the life about her.</p>
<p>One of the great barriers to human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1728">understanding</a> is the wide</p>
<p>temperamental difference one finds in the values of things <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1729">relating</a></p>
<p>to sex. It is the issue upon which people most need training in</p>
<p>charity and imaginative sympathy. Here are no universal standards</p>
<p>at all, and indeed for no single man nor woman does there seem to be</p>
<p>any fixed standard, so much do the accidents of circumstances and</p>
<p>one's physical phases affect one's interpretations. There is</p>
<p>nothing in the whole range of sexual fact that may not seem</p>
<p>supremely beautiful or humanly jolly or magnificently wicked or</p>
<p>disgusting or trivial or utterly insignificant, according to the eye</p>
<p>that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1730">sees</a> or the mood that colours. Here is something that may fill</p>
<p>the skies and every <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1731">waking</a> hour or be almost completely banished</p>
<p>from a life. It may be everything on Monday and less than nothing</p>
<p>on Saturday. And we make our laws and rules as though in these</p>
<p>matters all men and women were commensurable one with another, with</p>
<p>an equal steadfast passion and an equal constant duty…</p>
<p>I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1732">know</a> what <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1733">dreams</a> Altiora may have had in her schoolroom</p>
<p>days, I always suspected her of suppressed and forgotten phases, but</p>
<p>certainly her general <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1734">effect</a> now was of an entirely passionless</p>
<p>worldliness in these matters. Indeed so far as I could get at her,</p>
<p>she regarded sexual passion as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1735">being</a> hardly more legitimate in a</p>
<p>civilised person than-let us say-homicidal mania. She must have</p>
<p>forgotten-and Bailey too. I suspect she forgot before she married</p>
<p>him. I don't suppose either of them had the slightest intimation of</p>
<p>the dimensions sexual love can take in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1736">thoughts</a> of the great</p>
<p>majority of people with whom they come in contact. They loved in</p>
<p>their way-an intellectual way it was and a fond way-but it had no</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1737">relation</a> to beauty and physical sensation-except that there seemed</p>
<p>a decree of exile against these things. They got their glow in high</p>
<p>moments of altruistic ambition-and in moments of vivid worldly</p>
<p>success. They sat at opposite ends of their dinner table with so</p>
<p>and so "captured," and so and so, flushed with a mutual approval.</p>
<p>They <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1738">saw</a> people in love forgetful and distraught about them, and</p>
<p>just put it down to forgetfulness and distraction. At any rate</p>
<p>Altiora manifestly viewed my situation and Margaret's with an</p>
<p>abnormal and entirely misleading simplicity. There was the girl,</p>
<p>rich, with an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1739">acceptable</a> claim to be beautiful, shiningly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1740">virtuous</a>,</p>
<p>quite capable of political interests, and there was I, talented,</p>
<p>ambitious and full of political and social passion, in need of just</p>
<p>the money, devotion and regularisation Margaret could provide. We</p>
<p>were both unmarried-white sheets of uninscribed paper. Was there</p>
<p>ever a simpler situation? What more could we possibly want?</p>
<p>She was even a little offended at the inconclusiveness that did not</p>
<p>settle things at Pangbourne. I seemed to her, I suspect, to reflect</p>
<p>upon her judgment and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1741">good</a> intentions.</p>

<p>I didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1742">see</a> things with Altiora's simplicity.</p>
<p>I admired Margaret very much, I was fully aware of all that she and</p>
<p>I might give each other; indeed so far as Altiora went we were quite</p>
<p>in agreement. But what seemed solid ground to Altiora and the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1743">ultimate</a> footing of her emasculated world, was to me just the</p>
<p>superficial covering of a gulf-oh! abysses of vague and dim, and</p>
<p>yet stupendously significant things.</p>
<p>I couldn't dismiss the interests and the passion of sex as Altiora</p>
<p>did. Work, I agreed, was important; career and success; but deep</p>
<p>unanalysable instincts told me this preoccupation was a thing quite</p>
<p>as important; dangerous, interfering, destructive indeed, but none</p>
<p>the less a dominating interest in life. I have told how flittingly</p>
<p>and uninvited it came like a moth from the outer twilight into my</p>
<p>life, how it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1744">grew</a> in me with my manhood, how it found its way to</p>
<p>speech and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1744">grew</a> daring, and led me at last to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1745">experience</a>. After</p>
<p>that adventure at Locarno sex and the interests and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1746">desires</a> of sex</p>
<p>never left me for long at peace. I went on with my work and my</p>
<p>career, and all the time it was like-like someone talking ever and</p>
<p>again in a room while one tries to write.</p>
<p>There were times when I could have wished the world a world all of</p>
<p>men, so greatly did this unassimilated series of motives and</p>
<p>curiosities hamper me; and times when I could have wished the world</p>
<p>all of women. I seemed always to be seeking something in women, in</p>
<p>girls, and I was never clear what it was I was seeking. But never-</p>
<p>even at my coarsest-was I moved by physical <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1747">desire</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1748">alone</a>. Was I</p>
<p>seeking <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1749">help</a> and fellowship? Was I seeking some intimacy with</p>
<p>beauty? It was a thing too <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1750">formless</a> to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1751">state</a>, that I seemed always</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1747">desiring</a> to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1752">attain</a> and never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1753">attaining</a>. Waves of gross sensuousness</p>
<p>arose out of this preoccupation, carried me to a crisis of</p>
<p>gratification or disappointment that was clearly not the needed</p>
<p>thing; they passed and left my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1754">mind</a> free again for a time to get on</p>
<p>with the permanent pursuits of my life. And then presently this</p>
<p>solicitude would have me again, an irrelevance as it seemed, and yet</p>
<p>a constantly recurring demand.</p>
<p>I don't want particularly to dwell upon things that are disagreeable</p>
<p>for others to read, but I cannot leave them out of my story and get</p>
<p>the right proportions of the forces <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1755">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1756">am</a> balancing. I was no</p>
<p>abnormal man, and that world of order we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1757">desire</a> to make must be</p>
<p>built of such stuff as I was and am and can beget. You cannot have</p>
<p>a world of Baileys; it would end in one orderly generation.</p>
<p>Humanity is begotten in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1757">Desire</a>, lives by <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1757">Desire</a>.</p>
<p>"Love which is lust, is the Lamp in the Tomb;</p>
<p>Love which is lust, is the Call from the Gloom."</p>
<p>I echo Henley.</p>
<p>I suppose the life of celibacy which the active, well-fed, well-</p>
<p>exercised and imaginatively stirred young man of the educated</p>
<p>classes is supposed to lead from the age of nineteen or twenty, when</p>
<p>Nature certainly meant him to marry, to thirty or more, when</p>
<p>civilisation permits him to do so, is the most impossible thing in</p>
<p>the world. We deal here with facts that are kept secret and</p>
<p>obscure, but I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1758">doubt</a> for my own part if more than one man out of</p>
<p>five in our class <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1759">satisfies</a> that ideal demand. The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1760">rest</a> are even as</p>
<p>I was, and Hatherleigh and Esmeer and all the men I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1761">knew</a>. I draw no</p>
<p>lessons and offer no panacea; I have to tell the quality of life,</p>
<p>and this is how it is. This is how it will remain until men and</p>
<p>women have the courage to face the facts of life.</p>
<p>I was no systematic libertine, you must <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1762">understand</a>; things happened</p>
<p>to me and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1763">desire</a> drove me. Any young man would have served for that</p>
<p>Locarno adventure, and after that what had been a mystic and</p>
<p>wonderful thing passed rapidly into a gross, manifestly misdirected</p>
<p>and complicating one. I can count a meagre tale of five illicit</p>
<p>loves in the days of my youth, to include that first <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1764">experience</a>, and</p>
<p>of them all only two were sustained relationships. Besides these</p>
<p>five "affairs," on one or two occasions I dipped so low as the inky</p>
<p>dismal sensuality of the streets, and made one of those pairs of</p>
<p>correlated figures, the woman in her squalid finery sailing</p>
<p>homeward, the man modestly aloof and behind, that every night in the</p>
<p>London year flit by the score of thousands across the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1765">sight</a> of the</p>
<p>observant…</p>
<p>How ugly it is to recall; ugly and shameful now without</p>
<p>qualification! Yet at the time there was surely something not</p>
<p>altogether ugly in it-something that has vanished, some fine thing</p>
<p>mortally ailing.</p>
<p>One such occasion I recall as if it were a vision deep down in a</p>
<p>pit, as if it had happened in another <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1766">state</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1767">existence</a> to someone</p>
<p>else. And yet it is the sort of thing that has happened, once or</p>
<p>twice at least, to half the men in London who have been in a</p>
<p>position to make it possible. Let me try and give you its peculiar</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1768">effect</a>. Man or woman, you ought to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1769">know</a> of it.</p>
<p>Figure to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1770">yourself</a> a dingy room, somewhere in that network of</p>
<p>streets that lies about Tottenham Court Road, a dingy bedroom lit by</p>
<p>a solitary candle and carpeted with scraps and patches, with</p>
<p>curtains of cretonne closing the window, and a tawdry ornament of</p>
<p>paper in the grate. I sit on a bed beside a weary-eyed, fair-</p>
<p>haired, sturdy young woman, half undressed, who is telling me in</p>
<p>broken German something that my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1771">knowledge</a> of German is at first</p>
<p>inadequate to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1772">understand</a>…</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1773">thought</a> she was boasting about her family, and then slowly the</p>
<p>meaning came to me. She was a Lett from near Libau in Courland, and</p>
<p>she was telling me-just as one tells something too strange for</p>
<p>comment or emotion-how her father had been shot and her sister</p>
<p>outraged and murdered before her eyes.</p>
<p>It was as if one had dipped into something primordial and stupendous</p>
<p>beneath the smooth and trivial surfaces of life. There was I, you</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1774">know</a>, the promising young don from Cambridge, who wrote quite</p>
<p>brilliantly about politics and might presently get into Parliament,</p>
<p>with my collar and tie in my hand, and a certain sense of shameful</p>
<p>adventure fading out of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1775">mind</a>.</p>
<p>"Ach Gott!" she sighed by way of comment, and mused deeply for a</p>
<p>moment before she turned her face to me, as to something forgotten</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1776">remembered</a>, and assumed the half-hearted meretricious smile.</p>
<p>"Bin ich eine hubsche?" she asked like one who repeats a lesson.</p>
<p>I was moved to crave her pardon and come away.</p>
<p>"Bin ich eine hubsche?" she asked a little anxiously, laying a</p>
<p>detaining hand upon me, and evidently not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1777">understanding</a> a word of</p>
<p>what I was striving to say.</p>

<p>I find it extraordinarily difficult to recall the phases by which I</p>
<p>passed from my first admiration of Margaret's earnestness and</p>
<p>unconscious daintiness to an intimate acquaintance. The earlier</p>
<p>encounters stand out clear and hard, but then the impressions become</p>
<p>crowded and mingle not only with each other but with all the</p>
<p>subsequent developments of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1778">relationship</a>, the enormous evolutions of</p>
<p>interpretation and comprehension between husband and wife. Dipping</p>
<p>into my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1779">memories</a> is like dipping into a ragbag, one brings out this</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1779">memory</a> or that, with no intimation of how they came in time or what</p>
<p>led to them and joined them together. And they are all mixed up</p>
<p>with subsequent associations, with sympathies and discords, habits</p>
<p>of intercourse, surprises and disappointments and discovered</p>
<p>misunderstandings. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1780">know</a> only that always my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1781">feelings</a> for Margaret</p>
<p>were complicatel <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1781">feelings</a>, woven of many and various strands.</p>
<p>It is one of the curious neglected aspects of life how at the same</p>
<p>time and in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1782">relation</a> to the same <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1783">reality</a> we can have in our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1784">minds</a></p>
<p>streams of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1785">thought</a> at quite different levels. We can be at the same</p>
<p>time idealising a person and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1786">seeing</a> and criticising that person</p>
<p>quite coldly and clearly, and we slip unconsciously from level to</p>
<p>level and produce all sorts of inconsistent acts. In a sense I had</p>
<p>no illusions about Margaret; in a sense my conception of Margaret</p>
<p>was entirely poetic illusion. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1787">think</a> I was ever blind to</p>
<p>certain defects of hers, and quite as certainly they didn't seem to</p>
<p>matter in the slightest degree. Her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1784">mind</a> had a curious want of</p>
<p>vigour, "flatness" is the only word; she never seemed to escape from</p>
<p>her phrase; her way of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1788">thinking</a>, her way of doing was indecisive;</p>
<p>she remained in her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1789">attitude</a>, it did not flow out to easy,</p>
<p>confirmatory action.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1790">saw</a> this quite clearly, and when we walked and talked together I</p>
<p>seemed always trying for animation in her and never finding it. I</p>
<p>would <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1791">state</a> my ideas. "I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1792">know</a>," she would say, "I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1792">know</a>."</p>
<p>I talked about <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1793">myself</a> and she listened wonderfully, but she made no</p>
<p>answering revelations. I talked politics, and she remarked with her</p>
<p>blue eyes wide and earnest: "Every WORD you say seems so just."</p>
<p>I admired her appearance tremendously but-I can only express it by</p>
<p>saying I didn't want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1794">touch</a> her. Her fair hair was always</p>
<p>delectably done. It flowed beautifully over her pretty small ears,</p>
<p>and she would tie its fair coilings with fillets of black or blue</p>
<p>velvet that carried pretty buckles of silver and paste. The light,</p>
<p>the faint down on her brow and cheek was delightful. And it was</p>
<p>clear to me that I made her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1795">happy</a>.</p>
<p>My sense of her deficiencies didn't stand in the way of my falling</p>
<p>at last very deeply in love with her. Her very shortcomings seemed</p>
<p>to offer me something…</p>
<p>She stood in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1796">mind</a> for goodness-and for things from which it</p>
<p>seemed to me my hold was slipping.</p>
<p>She seemed to promise a way of escape from the deepening opposition</p>
<p>in me between physical passions and the constructive career, the</p>
<p>career of wide aims and human service, upon which I had embarked.</p>
<p>All the time that I was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1797">seeing</a> her as a beautiful, fragile, rather</p>
<p>ineffective girl, I was also <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1797">seeing</a> her just as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1798">consciously</a> as a</p>
<p>shining slender figure, a radiant reconciliation, coming into my</p>
<p>darkling disorders of lust and impulse. I could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1799">understand</a> clearly</p>
<p>that she was incapable of the most necessary subtleties of political</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1800">thought</a>, and yet I could contemplate praying to her and putting all</p>
<p>the intricate troubles of my life at her feet.</p>
<p>Before the reappearance of Margaret in my world at all an unwonted</p>
<p>disgust with the consequences and quality of my passions had arisen</p>
<p>in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1801">mind</a>. Among other things that moment with the Lettish girl</p>
<p>haunted me persistently. I would <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1802">see</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1803">myself</a> again and again sitting</p>
<p>amidst those sluttish surroundings, collar and tie in hand, while</p>
<p>her heavy German words grouped <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1804">themselves</a> to a slowly apprehended</p>
<p>meaning. I would <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1805">feel</a> again with a fresh stab of remorse, that this</p>
<p>was not a flash of adventure, this was not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1806">seeing</a> life in any</p>
<p>permissible sense, but a dip into tragedy, dishonour, hideous</p>
<p>degradation, and the pitiless cruelty of a world as yet uncontrolled</p>
<p>by any ordered will.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1807">Good</a> God!" I put it to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1808">myself</a>, "that I should finish the work those</p>
<p>Cossacks had begun! I who want order and justice before everything!</p>
<p>There's no way out of it, no decent excuse! If I didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1809">think</a>, I</p>
<p>ought to have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1810">thought</a>!"…</p>
<p>How did I get to it?"… I would ransack the phases of my</p>
<p>development from the first shy unveiling of a hidden wonder to the</p>
<p>last extremity as a man will go through muddled account books to</p>
<p>find some disorganising error…</p>
<p>I was also involved at that time-I find it hard to place these</p>
<p>things in the exact order of their dates because they were so</p>
<p>disconnected with the regular progress of my work and life-in an</p>
<p>intrigue, a clumsy, sensuous, pretentious, artificially stimulated</p>
<p>intrigue, with a Mrs. Larrimer, a woman living separated from her</p>
<p>husband. I will not go into particulars of that episode, nor how we</p>
<p>quarrelled and chafed one another. She was at once unfaithful and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1811">jealous</a> and full of whims about our meetings; she was careless of</p>
<p>our secret, and vulgarised our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1812">relationship</a> by intolerable</p>
<p>interpretations; except for some glowing moments of gratification,</p>
<p>except for the recurrent and essentially vicious <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1813">desire</a> that drew us</p>
<p>back to each other again, we both fretted at a vexatious and</p>
<p>unexpectedly binding intimacy. The interim was full of the quality</p>
<p>of work delayed, of time and energy wasted, of insecure precautions</p>
<p>against scandal and exposure. Disappointment is almost inherent in</p>
<p>illicit love. I had, and perhaps it was part of her recurrent</p>
<p>irritation also, a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1814">feeling</a> as though one had followed something fine</p>
<p>and beautiful into a net-into bird lime! These furtive scuffles,</p>
<p>this sneaking into shabby houses of assignation, was what we had</p>
<p>made out of the suggestion of pagan beauty; this was the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1815">reality</a> of</p>
<p>our vision of nymphs and satyrs dancing for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1816">joy</a> of life amidst</p>
<p>incessant sunshine. We had laid hands upon the wonder and glory of</p>
<p>bodily love and wasted them…</p>
<p>It was the sense of waste, of finely beautiful possibilities getting</p>
<p>entangled and marred for ever that oppressed me. I had missed, I</p>
<p>had lost. I did not turn from these things after the fashion of the</p>
<p>Baileys, as one turns from something low and embarrassing. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1817">felt</a></p>
<p>that these great organic forces were still to be wrought into a</p>
<p>harmony with my constructive passion. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1817">felt</a> too that I was not</p>
<p>doing it. I had not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1818">understood</a> the forces in this struggle nor its</p>
<p>nature, and as I learnt I failed. I had been started wrong, I had</p>
<p>gone on wrong, in a world that was muddled and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1819">confused</a>, full of</p>
<p>false counsel and erratic shames and twisted temptations. I learnt</p>
<p>to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1820">see</a> it so by failures that were perhaps destroying any chance of</p>
<p>profit in my lessons. Moods of clear keen industry alternated with</p>
<p>moods of relapse and indulgence and moods of dubiety and remorse. I</p>
<p>was not going on as the Baileys <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1821">thought</a> I was going on. There were</p>
<p>times when the blindness of the Baileys irritated me intensely.</p>
<p>Beneath the ostensible success of those years, between twenty-three</p>
<p>and twenty-eight, this rottenness, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1822">known</a> to scarcely any one but</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1823">myself</a>, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1824">grew</a> and spread. My sense of the probability of a collapse</p>
<p>intensified. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1825">knew</a> indeed now, even as Willersley had prophesied</p>
<p>five years before, that I was entangling <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1823">myself</a> in something that</p>
<p>might smother all my uses in the world. Down there among those</p>
<p>incommunicable difficulties, I was puzzled and blundering. I was</p>
<p>losing my hold upon things; the chaotic and adventurous element in</p>
<p>life was spreading upward and getting the better of me, over-</p>
<p>mastering me and all my will to rule and make… And the</p>
<p>strength, the drugging urgency of the passion!</p>
<p>Margaret shone at times in my imagination like a radiant angel in a</p>
<p>world of mire and disorder, in a world of cravings, hot and dull red</p>
<p>like scars inflamed…</p>
<p>I suppose it was because I had so great a need of such <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1826">help</a> as her</p>
<p>whiteness proffered, that I could ascribe impossible perfections to</p>
<p>her, a power of intellect, a moral power and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1827">patience</a> to which she,</p>
<p>poor fellow mortal, had indeed no claim. If only a few of us WERE</p>
<p>angels and freed from the tangle of effort, how easy life might be!</p>
<p>I wanted her so badly, so very badly, to be what I needed. I wanted</p>
<p>a woman to save me. I forced <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1828">myself</a> to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1829">see</a> her as I wished to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1829">see</a></p>
<p>her. Her tepidities became infinite delicacies, her mental</p>
<p>vagueness an atmospheric <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1830">realism</a>. The harsh precisions of the</p>
<p>Baileys and Altiora's blunt directness threw up her fineness into</p>
<p>relief and made a grace of every weakness.</p>
<p>Mixed up with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1831">memory</a> of times when I talked with Margaret as one</p>
<p>talks politely to those who are hopelessly inferior in mental</p>
<p>quality, explaining with a false lucidity, welcoming and encouraging</p>
<p>the feeblest <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1832">response</a>, when possible moulding and directing, are</p>
<p>times when I did indeed, as the old phrase goes, worship the ground</p>
<p>she trod on. I was equally honest and unconscious of inconsistency</p>
<p>at each extreme. But in neither phase could I find it easy to make</p>
<p>love to Margaret. For in the first I did not want to, though I</p>
<p>talked abundantly to her of marriage and so forth, and was a little</p>
<p>puzzled at <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1833">myself</a> for not going on to some personal application, and</p>
<p>in the second she seemed inaccessible, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1834">felt</a> I must make</p>
<p>confessions and put things before her that would be the grossest</p>
<p>outrage upon the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1835">noble</a> purity I attributed to her.</p>

</title>
<p>I went to Margaret at last to ask her to marry me, wrought up to the</p>
<p>mood of one who stakes his life on a cast. Separated from her, and</p>
<p>with the resonance of an evening of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1836">angry</a> recriminations with Mrs.</p>
<p>Larrimer echoing in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1837">mind</a>, I discovered <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1838">myself</a> to be quite</p>
<p>passionately in love with Margaret. Last shreds of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1839">doubt</a> vanished.</p>
<p>It has always been a feature of our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1840">relationship</a> that Margaret</p>
<p>absent means more to me than Margaret present; her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1841">memory</a> distils</p>
<p>from its dross and purifies in me. All my criticisms and</p>
<p>qualifications of her vanished into some dark corner of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1837">mind</a>.</p>
<p>She was the lady of my salvation; I must win my way to her or</p>
<p>perish.</p>
<p>I went to her at last, for all that I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1842">knew</a> she loved me, in</p>
<p>passionate <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1843">self-abasement</a>, white and a-tremble. She was staying</p>
<p>with the Rockleys at Woking, for Shena Rockley had been at Bennett</p>
<p>Hall with her and they had resumed a close intimacy; and I went down</p>
<p>to her on an impulse, unheralded. I was kept waiting for some</p>
<p>minutes, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1844">remember</a>, in a little room upon which a conservatory</p>
<p>opened, a conservatory full of pots of large mauve-edged, white</p>
<p>cyclamens in flower. And there was a big lacquer cabinet, a Chinese</p>
<p>thing, I suppose, of black and gold against the red-toned wall. To</p>
<p>this day the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1845">thought</a> of Margaret is inseparably bound up with the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1846">sight</a> of a cyclamen's back-turned petals.</p>
<p>She came in, looking pale and drooping rather more than usual. I</p>
<p>suddenly realised that Altiora's hint of a disappointment leading to</p>
<p>positive illness was something more than a vindictive comment. She</p>
<p>closed the door and came across to me and took and dropped my hand</p>
<p>and stood still. "What is it you want with me?" she asked.</p>
<p>The speech I had been turning over and over in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1847">mind</a> on the way</p>
<p>vanished at the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1848">sight</a> of her.</p>
<p>"I want to talk to you," I answered lamely.</p>
<p>For some seconds neither of us said a word.</p>
<p>"I want to tell you things about my life," I began.</p>
<p>She answered with a scarcely audible "yes."</p>
<p>"I almost asked you to marry me at Pangbourne," I plunged. "I</p>
<p>didn't. I didn't because-because you had too much to give me."</p>
<p>"Too much!" she echoed, "to give you!" She had lifted her eyes to</p>
<p>my face and the colour was coming into her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Don't misunderstand me," I said hastily. "I want to tell you</p>
<p>things, things you don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1849">know</a>. Don't answer me. I want to tell</p>
<p>you."</p>
<p>She stood before the fireplace with her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1850">ultimate</a> answer shining</p>
<p>through the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1851">quiet</a> of her face. "Go on," she said, very softly. It</p>
<p>was so pitilessly manifest she was resolved to idealise the</p>
<p>situation whatever I might say. I began walking up and down the</p>
<p>room between those cyclamens and the cabinet. There were little</p>
<p>gold fishermen on the cabinet fishing from little islands that each</p>
<p>had a pagoda and a tree, and there were also men in boats or</p>
<p>something, I couldn't determine what, and some obscure sub-office in</p>
<p>my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1852">mind</a> concerned itself with that quite intently. Yet I seem to</p>
<p>have been striving with all my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1853">being</a> to get words for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1854">truth</a> of</p>
<p>things. "You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1855">see</a>," I emerged, "you make everything possible to me.</p>
<p>You can give me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1856">help</a> and sympathy, support, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1857">understanding</a>. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1858">know</a></p>
<p>my political ambitions. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1858">know</a> all that I might do in the world.</p>
<p>I do so intensely want to do constructive things, big things</p>
<p>perhaps, in this wild jumble… Only you don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1858">know</a> a bit what</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1859">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1860">am</a>. I want to tell you what <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1859">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1860">am</a>. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1861">I'm</a> complex… <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1861">I'm</a></p>
<p>streaked."</p>
<p>I glanced at her, and she was regarding me with an expression of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1862">blissful</a> disregard for any meaning I was seeking to convey.</p>
<p>"You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1863">see</a>," I said, "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1864">I'm</a> a bad man."</p>
<p>She sounded a note of valiant incredulity.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to be slipping away from me. I pushed on to the</p>
<p>ugly facts that remained over from the wreck of my interpretation.</p>
<p>"What has held me back," I said, "is the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1865">thought</a> that you could not</p>
<p>possibly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1866">understand</a> certain things in my life. Men are not pure as</p>
<p>women are. I have had love affairs. I mean I have had affairs.</p>
<p>Passion-desire. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1867">see</a>, I have had a mistress, I have been</p>
<p>entangled-"</p>
<p>She seemed about to speak, but I interrupted. "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1868">I'm</a> not telling</p>
<p>you," I said, "what I meant to tell you. I want you to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1869">know</a> clearly</p>
<p>that there is another side to my life, a dirty side. Deliberately I</p>
<p>say, dirty. It didn't seem so at first-"</p>
<p>I stopped blankly. "Dirty," I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1870">thought</a>, was the most idiotic choice</p>
<p>of words to have made.</p>
<p>I had never in any tolerable sense of the word been dirty.</p>
<p>"I drifted into this-as men do," I said after a little pause and</p>
<p>stopped again.</p>
<p>She was looking at me with her wide blue eyes.</p>
<p>"Did you imagine," she began, "that I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1871">thought</a> you-that I expected-"</p>
<p>"But how can you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1872">know</a>?"</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1873">know</a>. I do <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1873">know</a>."</p>
<p>"But-" I began.</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1874">know</a>," she persisted, dropping her eyelids. "Of course I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1874">know</a>,"</p>
<p>and nothing could have convinced me more completely that she did not</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1874">know</a>.</p>
<p>"All men-" she generalised. "A woman does not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1875">understand</a> these</p>
<p>temptations."</p>
<p>I was astonished beyond measure at her way of taking my confession.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>"Of course," she said, hesitating a little over a transparent</p>
<p>difficulty, "it is all over and past."</p>
<p>"It's all over and past," I answered.</p>
<p>There was a little pause.</p>
<p>"I don't want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1876">know</a>," she said. "None of that seems to matter now</p>
<p>in the slightest degree."</p>
<p>She looked up and smiled as though we had exchanged some <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1877">acceptable</a></p>
<p>commonplaces. "Poor dear!" she said, dismissing everything, and put</p>
<p>out her arms, and it seemed to me that I could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1878">hear</a> the Lettish girl</p>
<p>in the background-doomed safety valve of purity in this intolerable</p>
<p>world-telling something in indistinguishable German-I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1879">know</a> not</p>
<p>what nor why…</p>
<p>I took Margaret in my arms and kissed her. Her eyes were wet with</p>
<p>tears. She clung to me and was near, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1880">felt</a>, to sobbing.</p>
<p>"I have loved you," she whispered presently, "Oh! ever since we met</p>
<p>in Misterton-six years and more ago."</p>

<p>CHAPTER THE THIRD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARGARET IN VENICE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>1</p>
</title>
<p>There comes into my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1881">mind</a> a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1882">confused</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1883">memory</a> of conversations with</p>
<p>Margaret; we must have had dozens altogether, and they mix in now</p>
<p>for the most part inextricably not only with one another, but with</p>
<p>later talks and with things we discussed at Pangbourne. We had the</p>
<p>immensest anticipations of the years and opportunities that lay</p>
<p>before us. I was now very deeply in love with her indeed. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1884">felt</a></p>
<p>not that I had cleaned up my life but that she had. We called each</p>
<p>other "confederate" I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1885">remember</a>, and made during our brief engagement</p>
<p>a series of visits to the various legislative bodies in London, the</p>
<p>County Council, the House of Commons, where we dined with Villiers,</p>
<p>and the St. Pancras Vestry, where we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1886">heard</a> Shaw speaking. I was</p>
<p>full of plans and so was she of the way in which we were to live and</p>
<p>work. We were to pay back in public service whatever excess of</p>
<p>wealth beyond his merits old Seddon's economic advantage had won for</p>
<p>him from the toiling people in the potteries. The end of the Boer</p>
<p>War was so recent that that blessed word "efficiency" echoed still</p>
<p>in people's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1881">minds</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1887">thoughts</a>. Lord Roseberry in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1888">memorable</a></p>
<p>oration had put it into the heads of the big outer public, but the</p>
<p>Baileys with a certain show of justice claimed to have set it going</p>
<p>in the channels that took it to him-if as a matter of fact it was</p>
<p>taken to him. But then it was their habit to make claims of that</p>
<p>sort. They certainly did their share to keep "efficient" going.</p>
<p>Altiora's highest praise was "thoroughly efficient." We were to be</p>
<p>a "thoroughly efficient" political couple of the "new type." She</p>
<p>explained us to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1889">herself</a> and Oscar, she explained us to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1890">ourselves</a>,</p>
<p>she explained us to the people who came to her dinners and</p>
<p>afternoons until the world was highly charged with explanation and</p>
<p>expectation, and the proposal that I should be the Liberal candidate</p>
<p>for the Kinghamstead Division seemed the most natural development in</p>
<p>the world.</p>
<p>I was full of the ideal of hard restrained living and relentless</p>
<p>activity, and throughout a beautiful November at Venice, where</p>
<p>chiefly we spent our honeymoon, we turned over and over again and</p>
<p>discussed in every aspect our conception of a life tremendously</p>
<p>focussed upon the ideal of social service.</p>
<p>Most clearly there stands out a picture of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1891">ourselves</a> talking in a</p>
<p>gondola on our way to Torcella. Far away behind us the smoke of</p>
<p>Murano <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1892">forms</a> a black stain upon an immense shining prospect of</p>
<p>smooth water, water as unruffled and luminous as the sky above, a</p>
<p>mirror on which rows of posts and distant black high-stemmed, swan-</p>
<p>necked boats with their minutely clear swinging gondoliers, float</p>
<p>aerially. Remote and low before us rises the little tower of our</p>
<p>destination. Our men swing together and their oars swirl leisurely</p>
<p>through the water, hump back in the rowlocks, splash sharply and go</p>
<p>swishing back again. Margaret lies back on cushions, with her face</p>
<p>shaded by a holland parasol, and I sit up beside her.</p>
<p>"You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1893">see</a>," I say, and in spite of Margaret's note of perfect</p>
<p>acquiescence I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1894">feel</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1895">myself</a> reasoning against an indefinable</p>
<p>antagonism, "it is so easy to fall into a slack way with life.</p>
<p>There may seem to be something priggish in a meticulous discipline,</p>
<p>but otherwise it is so easy to slip into indolent habits-and to be</p>
<p>distracted from one's purpose. The country, the world, wants men to</p>
<p>serve its constructive needs, to work out and carry out plans. For</p>
<p>a man who has to make a living the enemy is immediate necessity; for</p>
<p>people like <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1896">ourselves</a> it's-it's the constant small opportunity of</p>
<p>agreeable things."</p>
<p>"Frittering away," she says, "time and strength."</p>
<p>"That is what I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1897">feel</a>. It's so <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1898">pleasant</a> to pretend one is simply</p>
<p>modest, it looks so foolish at times to take one's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1899">self</a> too</p>
<p>seriously. We've GOT to take <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1900">ourselves</a> seriously."</p>
<p>She endorses my words with her eyes.</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1901">feel</a> I can do great things with life."</p>
<p>"I KNOW you can."</p>
<p>"But that's only to be done by concentrating one's life upon one</p>
<p>main end. We have to plan our days, to make everything subserve our</p>
<p>scheme."</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1902">feel</a>," she answers softly, "we ought to give-every hour."</p>
<p>Her face becomes <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1903">dreamy</a>. "I WANT to give every hour," she adds.</p>

</title>
<p>That holiday in Venice is set in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1904">memory</a> like a little artificial</p>
<p>lake in uneven <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1905">confused</a> country, as something very bright and</p>
<p>skylike, and discontinuous with all about it. The faded quality of</p>
<p>the very sunshine of that season, the mellow discoloured palaces and</p>
<p>places, the huge, time-ripened paintings of departed splendours, the</p>
<p>whispering, nearly noiseless passage of hearse-black gondolas, for</p>
<p>the horrible steam launch had not yet ruined Venice, the stilled</p>
<p>magnificences of the depopulated lagoons, the universal autumn, made</p>
<p>me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1906">feel</a> altogether in recess from the teeming uproars of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1907">reality</a>.</p>
<p>There was not a dozen people all told, no Americans and scarcely any</p>
<p>English, to dine in the big cavern of a dining-room, with its vistas</p>
<p>of separate tables, its distempered walls and its swathed</p>
<p>chandeliers. We went about <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1908">seeing</a> beautiful things, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1909">accepting</a></p>
<p>beauty on every hand, and taking it for granted that all was well</p>
<p>with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1910">ourselves</a> and the world. It was ten days or a fortnight before</p>
<p>I became fretful and anxious for action; a long <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1911">tranquillity</a> for</p>
<p>such a temperament as mine.</p>
<p>Our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1912">pleasures</a> were curiously impersonal, a succession of shared</p>
<p>aesthetic appreciation threads all that time. Our honeymoon was no</p>
<p>exultant coming together, no mutual shout of "YOU!" We were almost</p>
<p>shy with one another, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1913">felt</a> the relief of even a picture to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1914">help</a></p>
<p>us out. It was entirely in my conception of things that I should be</p>
<p>very watchful not to shock or distress Margaret or press the</p>
<p>sensuous note. Our love-making had much of the tepid smoothness of</p>
<p>the lagoons. We talked in delicate innuendo of what should be</p>
<p>glorious freedoms. Margaret had missed Verona and Venice in her</p>
<p>previous Italian journey-fear of the mosquito had driven her mother</p>
<p>across Italy to the westward route-and now she could fill up her</p>
<p>gaps and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1915">see</a> the Titians and Paul Veroneses she already <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1916">knew</a> in</p>
<p>colourless photographs, the Carpaccios, (the St. George series</p>
<p>delighted her beyond measure,) the Basaitis and that great statue of</p>
<p>Bartolomeo Colleoni that Ruskin praised.</p>
<p>But since <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1917">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1918">am</a> not a man to look at pictures and architectural</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1919">effects</a> day after day, I did watch Margaret very closely and store a</p>
<p>thousand <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1920">memories</a> of her. I can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1921">see</a> her now, her long body drooping</p>
<p>a little forward, her sweet face upraised to some discovered</p>
<p>familiar masterpiece and shining with a delicate enthusiasm. I can</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1922">hear</a> again the soft cadences of her voice murmuring commonplace</p>
<p>comments, for she had no gift of expressing the shapeless</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1923">satisfaction</a> these things gave her.</p>
<p>Margaret, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1924">perceived</a>, was a cultivated person, the first cultivated</p>
<p>person with whom I had ever come into close contact. She was</p>
<p>cultivated and moral, and I, I now realise, was never either of</p>
<p>these things. She was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1925">passive</a>, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1926">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1927">am</a> active. She did not simply</p>
<p>and naturally look for beauty but she had been incited to look for</p>
<p>it at school, and took perhaps a keener interest in books and</p>
<p>lectures and all the organisation of beautiful things than she did</p>
<p>in beauty itself; she found much of her delight in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1928">being</a> guided to</p>
<p>it. Now a thing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1929">ceases</a> to be beautiful to me when some finger points</p>
<p>me out its merits. Beauty is the salt of life, but I take my beauty</p>
<p>as a wild beast gets its salt, as a constituent of the meal…</p>
<p>And besides, there was that between us that should have seemed more</p>
<p>beautiful than any picture…</p>
<p>So we went about Venice tracking down pictures and spiral staircases</p>
<p>and such-like things, and my brains were busy all the time with such</p>
<p>things as a comparison of Venice and its nearest modern equivalent,</p>
<p>New York, with the elaboration of schemes of action when we returned</p>
<p>to London, with the development of a theory of Margaret.</p>
<p>Our marriage had done this much at least, that it had fused and</p>
<p>destroyed those two independent ways of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1930">thinking</a> about her that had</p>
<p>gone on in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1931">mind</a> hitherto. Suddenly she had become very near to</p>
<p>me, and a very big thing, a sort of comprehensive generalisation</p>
<p>behind a thousand questions, like the sky or England. The judgments</p>
<p>and understandings that had worked when she was, so to speak, miles</p>
<p>away from my life, had now to be altogether revised. Trifling</p>
<p>things began to matter enormously, that she had a weak and easily</p>
<p>fatigued back, for example, or that when she knitted her brows and</p>
<p>stammered a little in talking, it didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1932">really</a> mean that an</p>
<p>exquisite significance struggled for utterance.</p>
<p>We visited pictures in the mornings chiefly. In the afternoon,</p>
<p>unless we were making a day-long excursion in a gondola, Margaret</p>
<p>would <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1933">rest</a> for an hour while I prowled about in search of English</p>
<p>newspapers, and then we would go to tea in the Piazza San Marco and</p>
<p>watch the drift of people feeding the pigeons and going into the</p>
<p>little doors beneath the sunlit arches and domes of Saint Mark's.</p>
<p>Then perhaps we would stroll on the Piazzetta, or go out into the</p>
<p>sunset in a gondola. Margaret became very interested in the shops</p>
<p>that abound under the colonnades and decided at last to make an</p>
<p>extensive purchase of table glass. "These things," she said, are</p>
<p>quite beautiful, and far cheaper than anything but the most ordinary</p>
<p>looking English ware." I was interested in her idea, and a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1934">good</a></p>
<p>deal charmed by the delightful qualities of tinted shape, slender</p>
<p>handle and twisted stem. I suggested we should get not simply</p>
<p>tumblers and wineglasses but bedroom waterbottles, fruit- and sweet-</p>
<p>dishes, water-jugs, and in the end we made quite a business-like</p>
<p>afternoon of it.</p>
<p>I was beginning now to long quite definitely for events. Energy was</p>
<p>accumulating in me, and worrying me for an outlet. I found the</p>
<p>TIMES and the DAILY TELEGRAPH and the other papers I managed to get</p>
<p>hold of, more and more stimulating. I nearly wrote to the former</p>
<p>paper one day in answer to a letter by Lord Grimthorpe-I forget now</p>
<p>upon what point. I chafed secretly against this life of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1935">tranquil</a></p>
<p>appreciations more and more. I found my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1936">attitudes</a> of restrained and</p>
<p>delicate affection for Margaret increasingly difficult to sustain.</p>
<p>I surprised <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1937">myself</a> and her by little gusts of irritability, gusts</p>
<p>like the catspaws before a gale. I was alarmed at these symptoms.</p>
<p>One night when Margaret had gone up to her room, I put on a light</p>
<p>overcoat, went out into the night and prowled for a long time</p>
<p>through the narrow streets, smoking and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1938">thinking</a>. I returned and</p>
<p>went and sat on the edge of her bed to talk to her.</p>
<p>"Look here, Margaret," I said; "this is all very well, but <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1939">I'm</a></p>
<p>restless."</p>
<p>"Restless! " she said with a faint surprise in her voice.</p>
<p>"Yes. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1940">think</a> I want exercise. I've got a sort of feeling-I've</p>
<p>never had it before-as though I was getting fat."</p>
<p>"My dear!" she cried.</p>
<p>"I want to do things;-ride horses, climb mountains, take the devil</p>
<p>out of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1941">myself</a>."</p>
<p>She watched me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1942">thoughtfully</a>.</p>
<p>"Couldn't we DO something?" she said.</p>
<p>Do what?</p>
<p>"I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1943">know</a>. Couldn't we perhaps go away from here soon-and walk</p>
<p>in the mountains-on our way home."</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1944">thought</a>. "There seems to be no exercise at all in this place."</p>
<p>"Isn't there some walk?"</p>
<p>"I wonder," I answered. "We might walk to Chioggia perhaps, along</p>
<p>the Lido." And we tried that, but the long stretch of beach</p>
<p>fatigued Margaret's back, and gave her blisters, and we never got</p>
<p>beyond Malamocco…</p>
<p>A day or so after we went out to those <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1945">pleasant</a> black-robed, bearded</p>
<p>Armenians in their monastery at Saint Lazzaro, and returned towards</p>
<p>sundown. We fell into silence. "PIU LENTO," said Margaret to the</p>
<p>gondolier, and released my accumulated resolution.</p>
<p>"Let us go back to London," I said abruptly.</p>
<p>Margaret looked at me with surprised blue eyes.</p>
<p>"This is beautiful beyond measure, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1946">know</a>," I said, sticking to my</p>
<p>point, "but I have work to do."</p>
<p>She was silent for some seconds. "I had forgotten," she said.</p>
<p>"So had I," I sympathised, and took her hand. "Suddenly I have</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1947">remembered</a>."</p>
<p>She remained quite still. "There is so much to be done," I said,</p>
<p>almost apologetically.</p>
<p>She looked long away from me across the lagoon and at last sighed,</p>
<p>like one who has drunk deeply, and turned to me.</p>
<p>"I suppose one ought not to be so <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1948">happy</a>," she said. "Everything has</p>
<p>been so beautiful and so simple and splendid. And clean. It has</p>
<p>been just With You-the time of my life. It's a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1949">pity</a> such things</p>
<p>must end. But the world is calling you, dear… I ought not to</p>
<p>have forgotten it. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1950">thought</a> you were resting-and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1951">thinking</a>. But</p>
<p>if you are <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1952">rested</a>.-Would you like us to start to-morrow?"</p>
<p>She looked at once so fragile and so devoted that on the spur of the</p>
<p>moment I relented, and we stayed in Venice four more days.</p>

<p>CHAPTER THE FOURTH</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THE HOUSE IN WESTMINSTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>1</p>
</title>
<p>Margaret had already taken a little house in Radnor Square,</p>
<p>Westminster, before our marriage, a house that seemed particularly</p>
<p>adaptable to our needs as public-spirited efficients; it had been</p>
<p>very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1953">pleasantly</a> painted and papered under Margaret's instructions,</p>
<p>white paint and clean open purples and green predominating, and now</p>
<p>we set to work at once upon the interesting business of arranging</p>
<p>and-with our Venetian glass as a beginning-furnishing it. We had</p>
<p>been fairly fortunate with our wedding presents, and for the most</p>
<p>part it was open to us to choose just exactly what we would have and</p>
<p>just precisely where we would put it.</p>
<p>Margaret had a sense of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1954">form</a> and colour altogether superior to mine,</p>
<p>and so quite apart from the fact that it was her money equipped us,</p>
<p>I stood aside from all these matters and obeyed her summons to a</p>
<p>consultation only to endorse her judgment very readily. Until</p>
<p>everything was settled I went every day to my old rooms in Vincent</p>
<p>Square and worked at a series of papers that were originally</p>
<p>intended for the FORTNIGHTLY REVIEW, the papers that afterwards</p>
<p>became my fourth book, "New Aspects of Liberalism."</p>
<p>I still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1955">remember</a> as delightful most of the circumstances of getting</p>
<p>into 79, Radnor Square. The thin flavour of indecision about</p>
<p>Margaret disappeared altogether in a shop; she had the precisest</p>
<p>ideas of what she wanted, and the devices of the salesman did not</p>
<p>sway her. It was very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1956">pleasant</a> to find her taking things out of my</p>
<p>hands with a certain masterfulness, and showing the distinctest</p>
<p>determination to make a house in which I should be able to work in</p>
<p>that great project of "doing something for the world."</p>
<p>"And I do want to make things pretty about us," she said. "You</p>
<p>don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1957">think</a> it wrong to have things pretty?"</p>
<p>"I want them so."</p>
<p>"Altiora has things hard."</p>
<p>"Altiora," I answered, "takes a pride in standing ugly and</p>
<p>uncomfortable things. But I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1958">see</a> that they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1959">help</a> her. Anyhow</p>
<p>they won't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1959">help</a> me."</p>
<p>So Margaret went to the best shops and got everything very simple</p>
<p>and very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1960">good</a>. She bought some pictures very well indeed; there was</p>
<p>a little Sussex landscape, full of wind and sunshine, by Nicholson,</p>
<p>for my study, that hit my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1961">taste</a> far better than if I had gone out to</p>
<p>get some such expression for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1962">myself</a>.</p>
<p>"We will buy a picture just now and then," she said, "sometimes-</p>
<p>when we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1963">see</a> one."</p>
<p>I would come back through the January mire or fog from Vincent</p>
<p>Square to the door of 79, and reach it at last with a quite childish</p>
<p>appreciation of the fact that its solid Georgian proportions and its</p>
<p>fine brass furnishings belonged to MY home; I would use my latchkey</p>
<p>and discover Margaret in the warm-lit, spacious hall with a</p>
<p>partially opened packing-case, fatigued but <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1964">happy</a>, or go up to have</p>
<p>tea with her out of the right tea things, "come at last," or be told</p>
<p>to notice what was fresh there. It wasn't simply that I had never</p>
<p>had a house before, but I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1965">really</a> never been, except in the most</p>
<p>transitory way, in any house that was nearly so delightful as mine</p>
<p>promised to be. Everything was fresh and bright, and softly and</p>
<p>harmoniously toned. Downstairs we had a green dining-room with</p>
<p>gleaming silver, dark oak, and English colour-prints; above was a</p>
<p>large drawing-room that could be made still larger by throwing open</p>
<p>folding doors, and it was all carefully done in greys and blues, for</p>
<p>the most part with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1966">real</a> Sheraton supplemented by Sheraton so</p>
<p>skilfully imitated by an expert Margaret had discovered as to be</p>
<p>indistinguishable except to a minute scrutiny. And for me, above</p>
<p>this and next to my bedroom, there was a roomy study, with specially</p>
<p>thick stair-carpet outside and thick carpets in the bedroom overhead</p>
<p>and a big old desk for me to sit at and work between fire and</p>
<p>window, and another desk specially made for me by that expert if I</p>
<p>chose to stand and write, and open bookshelves and bookcases and</p>
<p>every sort of convenient fitting. There were electric heaters</p>
<p>beside the open fire, and everything was put for me to make tea at</p>
<p>any time-electric kettle, infuser, biscuits and fresh butter, so</p>
<p>that I could get up and work at any hour of the day or night. I</p>
<p>could do no work in this apartment for a long time, I was so</p>
<p>interested in the perfection of its arrangements. And when I</p>
<p>brought in my books and papers from Vincent Square, Margaret seized</p>
<p>upon all the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1965">really</a> shabby volumes and had them re-bound in a fine</p>
<p>official-looking leather.</p>
<p>I can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1967">remember</a> sitting down at that desk and looking round me and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1968">feeling</a> with a queer <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1969">effect</a> of surprise that after all even a place</p>
<p>in the Cabinet, though infinitely remote, was nevertheless in the</p>
<p>same large world with these fine and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1970">quietly</a> expensive things.</p>
<p>On the same floor Margaret had a "den," a very neat and pretty den</p>
<p>with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1971">good</a> colour-prints of Botticellis and Carpaccios, and there was</p>
<p>a third apartment for sectarial purposes should the necessity for</p>
<p>them arise, with a severe-looking desk equipped with patent files.</p>
<p>And Margaret would come flitting into the room to me, or appear</p>
<p>noiselessly standing, a tall gracefully drooping <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1972">form</a>, in the wide</p>
<p>open doorway. "Is everything right, dear?" she would ask.</p>
<p>"Come in," I would say, "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1973">I'm</a> sorting out papers."</p>
<p>She would come to the hearthrug.</p>
<p>"I mustn't disturb you," she would remark.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1974">I'm</a> not busy yet."</p>
<p>"Things are getting into order. Then we must make out a time-table</p>
<p>as the Baileys do, and BEGIN!"</p>
<p>Altiora came in to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1975">see</a> us once or twice, and a number of serious</p>
<p>young wives <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1976">known</a> to Altiora called and were shown over the house,</p>
<p>and discussed its arrangements with Margaret. They were all</p>
<p>tremendously keen on efficient arrangements.</p>
<p>"A little pretty," said Altiora, with the faintest disapproval,</p>
<p>"still-"</p>
<p>It was clear she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1977">thought</a> we should <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1978">grow</a> out of that. From the day</p>
<p>of our return we found other people's houses open to us and eager</p>
<p>for us. We went out of London for week-ends and dined out, and</p>
<p>began discussing our projects for reciprocating these hospitalities.</p>
<p>As a single man unattached, I had had a wide and miscellaneous</p>
<p>social range, but now I found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1979">myself</a> falling into place in a set.</p>
<p>For a time I acquiesced in this. I went very little to my clubs,</p>
<p>the Climax and the National Liberal, and participated in no bachelor</p>
<p>dinners at all. For a time, too, I dropped out of the garrulous</p>
<p>literary and journalistic circles I had frequented. I put up for</p>
<p>the Reform, not so much for the use of the club as a sign of serious</p>
<p>and substantial political standing. I didn't go up to Cambridge, I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1980">remember</a>, for nearly a year, so occupied was I with my new</p>
<p>adjustments.</p>
<p>The people we found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1981">ourselves</a> among at this time were people, to put</p>
<p>it roughly, of the Parliamentary candidate class, or people already</p>
<p>actually placed in the political world. They ranged between very</p>
<p>considerable wealth and such a hard, bare independence as old</p>
<p>Willersley and the sister who kept house for him possessed. There</p>
<p>were quite a number of young couples like <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1981">ourselves</a>, a little</p>
<p>younger and more artless, or a little older and more established.</p>
<p>Among the younger men I had a sort of distinction because of my</p>
<p>Cambridge reputation and my writing, and because, unlike them, I was</p>
<p>an adventurer and had won and married my way into their circles</p>
<p>instead of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1982">being</a> naturally there. They couldn't quite reckon upon</p>
<p>what I should do; they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1983">felt</a> I had reserves of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1984">experience</a> and</p>
<p>incalculable traditions. Close to us were the Cramptons, Willie</p>
<p>Crampton, who has since been Postmaster-General, rich and very</p>
<p>important in Rockshire, and his younger brother Edward, who has</p>
<p>specialised in history and become one of those unimaginative men of</p>
<p>letters who are the glory of latter-day England. Then there was</p>
<p>Lewis, further towards Kensington, where his cousins the Solomons</p>
<p>and the Hartsteins lived, a brilliant representative of his race,</p>
<p>able, industrious and invariably uninspired, with a wife a little in</p>
<p>revolt against the racial tradition of feminine servitude and</p>
<p>inclined to the suffragette point of view, and Bunting Harblow, an</p>
<p>old blue, and with an erratic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1985">disposition</a> well under the control of</p>
<p>the able little cousin he had married. I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1986">known</a> all these men,</p>
<p>but now (with Altiora floating angelically in benediction) they</p>
<p>opened their hearts to me and took me into their order. They were</p>
<p>all like <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1987">myself</a>, prospective Liberal candidates, with a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1988">feeling</a> that</p>
<p>the period of wandering in the wilderness of opposition was drawing</p>
<p>near its close. They were all tremendously keen upon social and</p>
<p>political service, and all greatly under the sway of the ideal of a</p>
<p>simple, strenuous life, a life finding its satisfactions in</p>
<p>political achievements and distinctions. The young wives were as</p>
<p>keen about it as the young husbands, Margaret most of all, and I-</p>
<p>whatever elements in me didn't march with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1989">attitudes</a> and habits</p>
<p>of this set were very much in the background during that time.</p>
<p>We would give little dinners and have evening gatherings at which</p>
<p>everything was very simple and very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1990">good</a>, with a slight but</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1991">perceptible</a> austerity, and there was more <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1990">good</a> fruit and flowers and</p>
<p>less perhaps in the way of savouries, patties and entrees than was</p>
<p>customary. Sherry we banished, and Marsala and liqueurs, and there</p>
<p>was always <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1990">good</a> home-made lemonade available. No men waited, but</p>
<p>very expert parlourmaids. Our meat was usually Welsh mutton-I</p>
<p>don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1992">know</a> why, unless that mountains have ever been the last refuge</p>
<p>of the severer <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1993">virtues</a>. And we talked politics and books and ideas</p>
<p>and Bernard Shaw (who was a department by <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1994">himself</a> and supposed in</p>
<p>those days to be ethically sound at bottom), and mingled with the</p>
<p>intellectuals-I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1995">myself</a> was, as it were, a promoted intellectual.</p>
<p>The Cramptons had a tendency to read <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1996">good</a> things aloud on their less</p>
<p>frequented receptions, but I have never been able to participate</p>
<p>submissively in this hyper-digestion of written matter, and</p>
<p>generally managed to provoke a disruptive debate. We were all very</p>
<p>earnest to make the most of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1997">ourselves</a> and to be and do, and I wonder</p>
<p>still at times, with an unassuaged perplexity, how it is that in</p>
<p>that phase of utmost earnestness I have always seemed to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1998">myself</a> to</p>
<p>be most remote from <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1999">reality</a>.</p>
</section>

<title>

</title>
<p>I look back now across the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2000">detaching</a> intervention of sixteen crowded</p>
<p>years, critically and I fancy almost impartially, to those</p>
<p>beginnings of my married life. I try to recall something near to</p>
<p>their proper order the developing phases of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2001">relationship</a>. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2002">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2003">am</a></p>
<p>struck most of all by the immense unpremeditated, generous-spirited</p>
<p>insincerities upon which Margaret and I were building.</p>
<p>It seems to me that here I have to tell perhaps the commonest</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2004">experience</a> of all among married educated people, the deliberate,</p>
<p>shy, complex effort to fill the yawning gaps in temperament as they</p>
<p>appear, the sustained, failing attempt to bridge abysses, level</p>
<p>barriers, evade violent pressures. I have come these latter years</p>
<p>of my life to believe that it is possible for a man and woman to be</p>
<p>absolutely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2005">real</a> with one another, to stand naked <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2006">souled</a> to each</p>
<p>other, unashamed and unafraid, because of the natural all-glorifying</p>
<p>love between them. It is possible to love and be loved untroubling,</p>
<p>as a bird flies through the air. But it is a rare and intricate</p>
<p>chance that brings two people within <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2007">sight</a> of that essential union,</p>
<p>and for the majority marriage must adjust itself on other terms.</p>
<p>Most coupled people never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2008">really</a> look at one another. They look a</p>
<p>little away to preconceived ideas. And each from the first days of</p>
<p>love-making HIDES from the other, is afraid of disappointing, afraid</p>
<p>of offending, afraid of discoveries in either sense. They build not</p>
<p>solidly upon the rock of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2009">truth</a>, but upon arches and pillars and</p>
<p>queer provisional supports that are needed to make a common</p>
<p>foundation, and below in the imprisoned darknesses, below the fine</p>
<p>fabric they sustain together begins for each of them a cavernous</p>
<p>hidden life. Down there things may be prowling that scarce ever</p>
<p>peep out to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2010">consciousness</a> except in the grey half-light of sleepless</p>
<p>nights, passions that flash out for an instant in an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2011">angry</a> glance</p>
<p>and are <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2012">seen</a> no more, starved victims and beautiful <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2013">dreams</a> bricked</p>
<p>up to die. For the most of us there is no jail delivery of those</p>
<p>inner depths, and the life above goes on to its honourable end.</p>
<p>I have told how I loved Margaret and how I came to marry her.</p>
<p>Perhaps already unintentionally I have indicated the quality of the</p>
<p>injustice our marriage did us both. There was no kindred between us</p>
<p>and no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2014">understanding</a>. We were drawn to one another by the</p>
<p>unlikeness of our quality, by the things we misunderstood in each</p>
<p>other. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2015">know</a> a score of couples who have married in that fashion.</p>
<p>Modern <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2016">conditions</a> and modern ideas, and in particular the intenser</p>
<p>and subtler perceptions of modern life, press more and more heavily</p>
<p>upon a marriage tie whose fashion comes from an earlier and less</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2017">discriminating</a> time. When the wife was her husband's subordinate,</p>
<p>meeting him simply and uncritically for simple ends, when marriage</p>
<p>was a purely domestic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2018">relationship</a>, leaving <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2019">thought</a> and the vivid</p>
<p>things of life almost entirely to the unencumbered man, mental and</p>
<p>temperamental incompatibilities mattered comparatively little. But</p>
<p>now the wife, and particularly the loving childless wife,</p>
<p>unpremeditatedly makes a relentless demand for a complete</p>
<p>association, and the husband exacts unthought of delicacies of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2020">understanding</a> and co-operation. These are stupendous demands.</p>
<p>People not only <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2021">think</a> more fully and elaborately about life than</p>
<p>they ever did before, but marriage obliges us to make that ever more</p>
<p>accidented progress a three-legged race of carelessly assorted</p>
<p>couples…</p>
<p>Our very mental texture was different. I was rough-minded, to use</p>
<p>the phrase of William James, primary and intuitive and illogical;</p>
<p>she was tender-minded, logical, refined and secondary. She was</p>
<p>loyal to pledge and persons, sentimental and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2022">faithful</a>; <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2023">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2024">am</a> loyal to</p>
<p>ideas and instincts, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2025">emotional</a> and scheming. My imagination moves</p>
<p>in broad gestures; her's was delicate with a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2026">real</a> dread of</p>
<p>extravagance. My quality is sensuous and ruled by warm impulses;</p>
<p>hers was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2027">discriminating</a> and essentially inhibitory. I like the</p>
<p>facts of the case and to mention everything; I like naked bodies and</p>
<p>the jolly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2028">smells</a> of things. She abounded in reservations, in</p>
<p>circumlocutions and evasions, in keenly appreciated secondary</p>
<p>points. Perhaps the reader <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2029">knows</a> that Tintoretto in the National</p>
<p>Gallery, the Origin of the Milky Way. It is an admirable test of</p>
<p>tempera-mental quality. In spite of my early training I have come</p>
<p>to regard that picture as altogether delightful; to Margaret it has</p>
<p>always been "needlessly offensive." In that you have our</p>
<p>fundamental breach. She had a habit, by no means rare, of damning</p>
<p>what she did not like or find sympathetic in me on the score that it</p>
<p>was not my "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2030">true</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2031">self</a>," and she did not so much <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2032">accept</a> the universe</p>
<p>as select from it and do her best to ignore the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2033">rest</a>. And also I</p>
<p>had far more initiative than had she. This is no catalogue of</p>
<p>rights and wrongs, or superiorities and inferiorities; it is a</p>
<p>catalogue of differences between two people linked in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2034">relationship</a></p>
<p>that constantly becomes more intolerant of differences.</p>
<p>This is how we stood to each other, and none of it was clear to</p>
<p>either of us at the outset. To begin with, I found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2035">myself</a> reserving</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2035">myself</a> from her, then slowly apprehending a jarring between our</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2036">minds</a> and what seemed to me at first a queer little habit of</p>
<p>misunderstanding in her…</p>
<p>It did not hinder my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2037">being</a> very fond of her…</p>
<p>Where our system of reservation became at once most usual and most</p>
<p>astounding was in our personal <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2038">relations</a>. It is not too much to say</p>
<p>that in that regard we never for a moment achieved sincerity with</p>
<p>one another during the first six years of our life together. It</p>
<p>goes even deeper than that, for in my effort to realise the ideal of</p>
<p>my marriage I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2039">ceased</a> even to attempt to be sincere with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2040">myself</a>. I</p>
<p>would not admit my own perceptions and interpretations. I tried to</p>
<p>fit <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2040">myself</a> to her thinner and finer determinations. There are</p>
<p>people who will say with a note of approval that I was learning to</p>
<p>conquer <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2040">myself</a>. I record that much without any note of approval…</p>
<p>For some years I never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2041">deceived</a> Margaret about any concrete fact</p>
<p>nor, except for the silence about my earlier life that she had</p>
<p>almost forced upon me, did I hide any concrete fact that seemed to</p>
<p>affect her, but from the outset I was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2042">guilty</a> of immense <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2043">spiritual</a></p>
<p>concealments, my very marriage was based, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2044">see</a> now, on a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2043">spiritual</a></p>
<p>subterfuge; I hid moods from her, pretended <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2045">feelings</a>…</p>

<p>The interest and excitement of setting-up a house, of walking about</p>
<p>it from room to room and from floor to floor, or sitting at one's</p>
<p>own dinner table and watching one's wife control conversation with a</p>
<p>pretty, timid resolution, of taking a place among the secure and</p>
<p>free people of our world, passed almost insensibly into the interest</p>
<p>and excitement of my Parliamentary candidature for the Kinghamstead</p>
<p>Division, that shapeless chunk of agricultural midland between the</p>
<p>Great Western and the North Western railways. I was going to "take</p>
<p>hold" at last, the Kinghamstead Division was my appointed handle. I</p>
<p>was to find my place in the rather indistinctly sketched</p>
<p>constructions that were implicit in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2046">minds</a> of all our circle.</p>
<p>The precise place I had to fill and the precise functions I had to</p>
<p>discharge were not as yet very clear, but all that, we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2047">felt</a> sure,</p>
<p>would become plain as things developed.</p>
<p>A few brief months of vague activities of "nursing" gave place to</p>
<p>the excitements of the contest that followed the return of Mr.</p>
<p>Camphell-Bannerman to power in 1905. So far as the Kinghamstead</p>
<p>Division was concerned it was a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2048">depressed</a> and tepid battle. I went</p>
<p>about the constituency making three speeches that were soon</p>
<p>threadbare, and an odd little collection of people worked for me;</p>
<p>two solicitors, a cheap photographer, a democratic parson, a number</p>
<p>of dissenting ministers, the Mayor of Kinghamstead, a Mrs. Bulger,</p>
<p>the widow of an old Chartist who had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2049">grown</a> rich through electric</p>
<p>traction patents, Sir Roderick Newton, a Jew who had bought</p>
<p>Calersham Castle, and old Sir Graham Rivers, that sturdy old</p>
<p>soldier, were among my chief supporters. We had headquarters in</p>
<p>each town and village, mostly there were empty shops we leased</p>
<p>temporarily, and there at least a sort of fuss and a coming and</p>
<p>going were maintained. The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2050">rest</a> of the population stared in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2051">state</a></p>
<p>of suspended judgment as we went about the business. The country</p>
<p>was supposed to be in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2051">state</a> of intellectual conflict and</p>
<p>deliberate decision, in history it will no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2052">doubt</a> figure as a</p>
<p>momentous conflict. Yet except for an occasional flare of bill-</p>
<p>sticking or a bill in a window or a placard-plastered motor-car or</p>
<p>an argumentative group of people outside a public-house or a</p>
<p>sluggish movement towards the schoolroom or village hall, there was</p>
<p>scarcely a sign that a great empire was revising its destinies. Now</p>
<p>and then one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2053">saw</a> a canvasser on a doorstep. For the most part</p>
<p>people went about their business with an entirely irresponsible</p>
<p>confidence in the stability of the universe. At times one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2054">felt</a> a</p>
<p>little absurd with one's flutter of colours and one's air of saving</p>
<p>the country.</p>
<p>My opponent was a quite undistinguished Major-General who relied</p>
<p>upon his advocacy of Protection, and was particularly anxious we</p>
<p>should avoid "personalities" and fight the constituency in a</p>
<p>gentlemanly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2055">spirit</a>. He was always writing me notes, apologising for</p>
<p>excesses on the part of his supporters, or pointing out the</p>
<p>undesirability of some course taken by mine.</p>
<p>My speeches had been planned upon broad lines, but they lost <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2056">touch</a></p>
<p>with these as the polling approached. To begin with I made a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2057">real</a></p>
<p>attempt to put what was in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2058">mind</a> before the people I was to supply</p>
<p>with a political voice. I spoke of the greatness of our empire and</p>
<p>its destinies, of the splendid projects and possibilities of life</p>
<p>and order that lay before the world, of all that a resolute and</p>
<p>constructive effort might do at the present time. "We are building</p>
<p>a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2059">state</a>," I said, "secure and splendid, we are in the dawn of the</p>
<p>great age of mankind." Sometimes that would get a solitary "'Ear!</p>
<p>'ear!" Then having created, as I imagined, a fine atmosphere, I</p>
<p>turned upon the history of the last Conservative administration and</p>
<p>brought it into contrast with the wide occasions of the age;</p>
<p>discussed its failure to control the grasping financiers in South</p>
<p>Africa, its failure to release public education from sectarian</p>
<p>squabbles, its misconduct of the Boer War, its waste of the world's</p>
<p>resources…</p>
<p>It soon became manifest that my opening and my general spaciousness</p>
<p>of method bored my audiences a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2060">good</a> deal. The richer and wider my</p>
<p>phrases the thinner sounded my voice in these non-resonating</p>
<p>gatherings. Even the platform supporters <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2061">grew</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2062">restive</a></p>
<p>unconsciously, and stirred and coughed. They did not recognise</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2063">themselves</a> as mankind. Building an empire, preparing a fresh stage</p>
<p>in the history of humanity, had no appeal for them. They were</p>
<p>mostly everyday, toiling people, full of small personal solicitudes,</p>
<p>and they came to my meetings, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2064">think</a>, very largely as a relaxation.</p>
<p>This stuff was not relaxing. They did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2064">think</a> politics was a</p>
<p>great constructive process, they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2065">thought</a> it was a kind of dog-fight.</p>
<p>They wanted fun, they wanted spice, they wanted hits, they wanted</p>
<p>also a chance to say "'Ear', 'ear!" in an intelligent and honourable</p>
<p>manner and clap their hands and drum with their feet. The great</p>
<p>constructive process in history gives so little scope for clapping</p>
<p>and drumming and saying "'Ear, 'ear!" One might as well <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2064">think</a> of</p>
<p>hounding on the solar system.</p>
<p>So after one or two attempts to lift my audiences to the level of</p>
<p>the issues involved, I began to adapt <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2066">myself</a> to them. I cut down my</p>
<p>review of our imperial outlook and destinies more and more, and</p>
<p>developed a series of hits and anecdotes and-what shall I call</p>
<p>them?-"crudifications" of the issue. My helper's congratulated me</p>
<p>on the rapid improvement of my platform style. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2067">ceased</a> to speak of</p>
<p>the late Prime Minister with the respect I bore him, and began to</p>
<p>fall in with the popular caricature of him as an artful rabbit-</p>
<p>witted person intent only on keeping his leadership, in spite of the</p>
<p>vigorous attempts of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain to oust him therefrom.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2067">ceased</a> to qualify my statement that Protection would make food</p>
<p>dearer for the agricultural labourer. I began to speak of Mr.</p>
<p>Alfred Lyttelton as an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2068">influence</a> at once insane and diabolical, as a</p>
<p>man inspired by a passionate <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2069">desire</a> to substitute manacled but still</p>
<p>criminal Chinese for honest British labourers throughout the world.</p>
<p>And when it came to the mention of our own kindly leader, of Mr.</p>
<p>John Burns or any one else of any prominence at all on our side I</p>
<p>fell more and more into the intonation of one who mentions the high</p>
<p>gods. And I had my reward in brighter meetings and readier and</p>
<p>readier applause.</p>
<p>One goes on from phase to phase in these things.</p>
<p>"After all," I told <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2070">myself</a>, "if one wants to get to Westminster one</p>
<p>must follow the road that leads there," but I found the road</p>
<p>nevertheless rather unexpectedly distasteful. "When one gets</p>
<p>there," I said, "then it is one begins."</p>
<p>But I would lie <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2071">awake</a> at nights with that sore throat and headache</p>
<p>and fatigue which come from speaking in ill-ventilated rooms, and</p>
<p>wondering how far it was possible to educate a whole people to great</p>
<p>political ideals. Why should political work always rot down to</p>
<p>personalities and personal appeals in this way? Life is, I suppose,</p>
<p>to begin with and end with a matter of personalities, from</p>
<p>personalities all our broader interests arise and to personalities</p>
<p>they return. All our social and political effort, all of it, is</p>
<p>like trying to make a crowd of people fall into <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2072">formation</a>. The</p>
<p>broader lines appear, but then come a rush and excitement and</p>
<p>irrelevancy, and forthwith the incipient order has vanished and the</p>
<p>marshals must begin the work over again!</p>
<p>My <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2073">memory</a> of all that time is essentially <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2074">confusion</a>. There was a</p>
<p>frightful lot of tiresome locomotion in it; for the Kinghamstead</p>
<p>Division is extensive, abounding in ill-graded and badly metalled</p>
<p>cross-roads and vicious little hills, and singularly unpleasing to</p>
<p>the eye in a muddy winter. It is sufficiently near to London to</p>
<p>have undergone the same process of ill-regulated expansion that made</p>
<p>Bromstead the place it is. Several of its overgrown villages have</p>
<p>developed strings of factories and sidings along the railway lines,</p>
<p>and there is an abundance of petty villas. There seemed to be no</p>
<p>place at which one could take hold of more than this or that element</p>
<p>of the population. Now we met in a meeting-house, now in a Masonic</p>
<p>Hall or Drill Hall; I also did a certain amount of open-air speaking</p>
<p>in the dinner hour outside gas-works and groups of factories. Some</p>
<p>special sort of people was, as it were, secreted in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2075">response</a> to each</p>
<p>special appeal. One said things carefully adjusted to the</p>
<p>distinctive limitations of each gathering. Jokes of an incredible</p>
<p>silliness and shallowness drifted about us. Our advisers made us</p>
<p>declare that if we were elected we would live in the district, and</p>
<p>one hasty agent had bills printed, "If Mr. Remington is elected he</p>
<p>will live here." The enemy obtained a number of these bills and</p>
<p>stuck them on outhouses, pigstyes, dog-kennels; you cannot imagine</p>
<p>how irksome the repetition of that jest became. The vast drifting</p>
<p>indifference in between my meetings impressed me more and more. I</p>
<p>realised the vagueness of my own plans as I had never done before I</p>
<p>brought them to the test of this <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2076">experience</a>. I was perplexed by the</p>
<p>riddle of just how far I was, in any sense of the word, taking hold</p>
<p>at all, how far I wasn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2077">myself</a> flowing into an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2078">accepted</a> groove.</p>
<p>Margaret was troubled by no such <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2079">doubts</a>. She was clear I had to go</p>
<p>into Parliament on the side of Liberalism and the light, as against</p>
<p>the late Government and darkness. Essential to the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2080">memory</a> of my</p>
<p>first contest, is the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2080">memory</a> of her clear bright face, very resolute</p>
<p>and grave, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2081">helping</a> me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2082">consciously</a>, steadfastly, with all her</p>
<p>strength. Her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2083">quiet</a> confidence, while I was so dissatisfied, worked</p>
<p>curiously towards the alienation of my sympathies. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2084">felt</a> she had</p>
<p>no business to be so sure of me. I had moments of vivid resentment</p>
<p>at <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2085">being</a> thus marched towards Parliament.</p>
<p>I seemed now always to be discovering alien forces of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2086">character</a> in</p>
<p>her. Her way of taking life diverged from me more and more. She</p>
<p>sounded amazing, independent notes. She bought some particularly</p>
<p>costly furs for the campaign that roused enthusiasm whenever she</p>
<p>appeared. She also made me a birthday present in November of a</p>
<p>heavily fur-trimmed coat and this she would make me remove as I went</p>
<p>on to the platform, and hold over her arm until I was ready to</p>
<p>resume it. It was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2087">fearfully</a> heavy for her and she liked it to be</p>
<p>heavy for her. That act of servitude was in essence a towering</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2088">self-assertion</a>. I would glance sideways while some chairman</p>
<p>floundered through his introduction and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2089">see</a> the clear blue eye with</p>
<p>which she regarded the audience, which <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2090">existed</a> so far as she was</p>
<p>concerned merely to return me to Parliament. It was a friendly eye,</p>
<p>provided they were not silly or troublesome. But it kindled a</p>
<p>little at the hint of a hostile question. After we had come so far</p>
<p>and taken so much trouble!</p>
<p>She constituted <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2091">herself</a> the dragoman of our political travels. In</p>
<p>hotels she was serenely resolute for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2092">quietest</a> and the best, she</p>
<p>rejected all their proposals for meals and substituted a severely</p>
<p>nourishing dietary of her own, and even in private houses she</p>
<p>astonished me by her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2093">tranquil</a> insistence upon special <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2094">comforts</a> and</p>
<p>sustenance. I can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2095">see</a> her face now as it would confront a hostess,</p>
<p>a little intent, but sweetly resolute and assured.</p>
<p>Since our marriage she had read a number of political memoirs, and</p>
<p>she had been particularly impressed by the career of Mrs. Gladstone.</p>
<p>I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2096">think</a> it occurred to her to compare and contrast my quality</p>
<p>with that of Mrs. Gladstone's husband. I suspect her of a</p>
<p>deliberate intention of achieving parallel results by parallel</p>
<p>methods. I was to be Gladstonised. Gladstone it appeared used to</p>
<p>lubricate his speeches with a mixture-if my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2097">memory</a> serves me right-</p>
<p>of egg beaten up in sherry, and Margaret was very anxious I should</p>
<p>take a leaf from that celebrated book. She wanted, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2098">know</a>, to hold</p>
<p>the glass in her hand while I was speaking.</p>
<p>But here I was firm. "No," I said, very decisively, "simply I won't</p>
<p>stand that. It's a matter of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2099">conscience</a>. I shouldn't feel-</p>
<p>democratic. I'll take my chance of the common water in the carafe</p>
<p>on the chairman's table."</p>
<p>"I DO wish you wouldn't," she said, distressed.</p>
<p>It was absurd to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2100">feel</a> irritated; it was so admirable of her, a</p>
<p>little childish, infinitely womanly and devoted and fine-and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2101">see</a></p>
<p>now how pathetic. But I could not afford to succumb to her. I</p>
<p>wanted to follow my own leading, to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2101">see</a> things clearly, and this</p>
<p>reassuring pose of a high destiny, of an almost terribly efficient</p>
<p>pursuit of a fixed end when as a matter of fact I had a very</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2102">doubtful</a> end and an aim as yet by no means fixed, was all too</p>
<p>seductive for dalliance…</p>

<p>And into all these things with the manner of a trifling and casual</p>
<p>incident comes the figure of Isabel Rivers. My first impressions of</p>
<p>her were of a rather ugly and ungainly, extraordinarily interesting</p>
<p>schoolgirl with a beautiful quick flush under her warm brown skin,</p>
<p>who said and did amusing and surprising things. When first I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2103">saw</a></p>
<p>her she was riding a very old bicycle downhill with her feet on the</p>
<p>fork of the frame-it seemed to me to the public danger, but</p>
<p>afterwards I came to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2104">understand</a> the quality of her nerve better-and</p>
<p>on the third occasion she was for her own private <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2105">satisfaction</a></p>
<p>climbing a tree. On the intervening occasion we had what seems now</p>
<p>to have been a long sustained conversation about the political</p>
<p>situation and the books and papers I had written.</p>
<p>I wonder if it was.</p>
<p>What a delightful mixture of child and grave woman she was at that</p>
<p>time, and how little I reckoned on the part she would play in my</p>
<p>life! And since she has played that part, how impossible it is to</p>
<p>tell now of those early days! Since I wrote that opening paragraph</p>
<p>to this section my idle pen has been, as it were, playing by itself</p>
<p>and sketching faces on the blotting pad-one impish wizened visage</p>
<p>is oddly like little Bailey-and I have been <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2106">thinking</a> cheek on fist</p>
<p>amidst a limitless wealth of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2107">memories</a>. She sits below me on the low</p>
<p>wall under the olive trees with our little child in her arms. She</p>
<p>is now the central fact in my life. It still seems a little</p>
<p>incredible that that should be so. She has destroyed me as a</p>
<p>politician, brought me to this belated rebeginning of life. When I</p>
<p>sit down and try to make her a girl again, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2108">feel</a> like the Arabian</p>
<p>fisherman who tried to put the genius back into the pot from which</p>
<p>it had spread gigantic across the skies…</p>
<p>I have a very clear vision of her rush downhill past our labouring</p>
<p>ascendant car-my colours fluttered from handle-bar and shoulder-</p>
<p>knot-and her waving hand and the sharp note of her voice. She</p>
<p>cried out something, I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2109">know</a> what, some greeting.</p>
<p>"What a pretty girl!" said Margaret.</p>
<p>Parvill, the cheap photographer, that industrious organiser for whom</p>
<p>by way of repayment I got those magic letters, that knighthood of</p>
<p>the underlings, "J. P." was in the car with us and explained her to</p>
<p>us. "One of the best workers you have," he said…</p>
<p>And then after a toilsome troubled morning we came, rather cross</p>
<p>from the strain of sustained amiability, to Sir Graham Rivers'</p>
<p>house. It seemed all softness and quiet-I recall dead white</p>
<p>panelling and oval mirrors horizontally set and a marble fireplace</p>
<p>between white marble-blind Homer and marble-blind Virgil, very grave</p>
<p>and fine-and how Isabel came in to lunch in a shapeless thing like</p>
<p>a blue smock that made her bright quick-changing face seem yellow</p>
<p>under her cloud of black hair. Her step-sister was there, Miss</p>
<p>Gamer, to whom the house was to descend, a well-dressed lady of</p>
<p>thirty, amiably disavowing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2110">responsibility</a> for Isabel in every phrase</p>
<p>and gesture. And there was a very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2111">pleasant</a> doctor, an Oxford man,</p>
<p>who seemed on excellent terms with every one. It was manifest that</p>
<p>he was in the habit of sparring with the girl, but on this occasion</p>
<p>she wasn't sparring and refused to be teased into a display in spite</p>
<p>of the taunts of either him or her father. She was, they discovered</p>
<p>with rising eyebrows, shy. It seemed an opportunity too rare for</p>
<p>them to miss. They proclaimed her enthusiasm for me in a way that</p>
<p>brought a flush to her cheek and a look into her eye between appeal</p>
<p>and defiance. They declared she had read my books, which I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2112">thought</a></p>
<p>at the time was exaggeration, their dry political quality was so</p>
<p>distinctly not what one was accustomed to regard as schoolgirl</p>
<p>reading. Miss Gamer protested to protect her, "When once in a blue</p>
<p>moon Isabel is well-behaved…!"</p>
<p>Except for these attacks I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2113">remember</a> much of the conversation</p>
<p>at table; it was, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2114">know</a>, discursive and concerned with the sort of</p>
<p>topographical and social and electioneering fact natural to such a</p>
<p>visit. Old Rivers struck me as a delightful person, modestly</p>
<p>unconscious of his doubly-earned V. C. and the plucky defence of</p>
<p>Kardin-Bergat that won his baronetcy. He was that excellent type,</p>
<p>the soldier radical, and we began that day a friendship that was</p>
<p>only ended by his death in the hunting-field three years later. He</p>
<p>interested Margaret into a disregard of my plate and the fact that I</p>
<p>had secured the illegal indulgence of Moselle. After lunch we went</p>
<p>for coffee into another low room, this time brown panelled and</p>
<p>looking through French windows on a red-walled garden, graceful even</p>
<p>in its winter desolation. And there the conversation suddenly</p>
<p>picked up and became <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2115">good</a>. It had fallen to a pause, and the</p>
<p>doctor, with an air of definitely throwing off a mask and wrecking</p>
<p>an established <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2116">tranquillity</a>, remarked: "Very probably you Liberals</p>
<p>will come in, though <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2117">I'm</a> not sure you'll come in so mightily as you</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2118">think</a>, but what you do when you do come in passes my comprehension."</p>
<p>"There's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2119">good</a> work sometimes," said Sir Graham, "in undoing."</p>
<p>"You can't govern a great empire by amending and repealing the Acts</p>
<p>of your predecessors," said the doctor.</p>
<p>There came that kind of pause that happens when a subject is</p>
<p>broached too big and difficult for the gathering. Margaret's blue</p>
<p>eyes regarded the speaker with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2120">quiet</a> disapproval for a moment, and</p>
<p>then came to me in the not too confident hope that I would snub him</p>
<p>out of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2121">existence</a> with some prompt rhetorical stroke. A voice spoke</p>
<p>out of the big arm-chair.</p>
<p>"We'll do things," said Isabel.</p>
<p>The doctor's eye lit with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2122">joy</a> of the fisherman who strikes his</p>
<p>fish at last. "What will you do?" he asked her.</p>
<p>"Every one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2123">knows</a> we're a mixed lot," said Isabel.</p>
<p>"Poor old chaps like me!" interjected the general.</p>
<p>"But that's not a programme," said the doctor.</p>
<p>"But Mr. Remington has published a programme," said Isabel.</p>
<p>The doctor cocked half an eye at me.</p>
<p>"In some review," the girl went on. "After all, we're not going to</p>
<p>elect the whole Liberal party in the Kinghamstead Division. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2124">I'm</a> a</p>
<p>Remington-ite!"</p>
<p>"But the programme," said the doctor, "the programme-"</p>
<p>"In front of Mr. Remington!"</p>
<p>"Scandal always comes home at last," said the doctor. "Let him <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2125">hear</a></p>
<p>the worst."</p>
<p>"I'd like to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2126">hear</a>," I said. "Electioneering shatters convictions</p>
<p>and enfeebles the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2127">mind</a>."</p>
<p>"Not mine," said Isabel stoutly. "I mean-Well, anyhow I take it</p>
<p>Mr. Remington stands for constructing a civilised <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2128">state</a> out of this</p>
<p>muddle."</p>
<p>"THIS muddle," protested the doctor with an appeal of the eye to the</p>
<p>beautiful long room and the ordered garden outside the bright clean</p>
<p>windows.</p>
<p>"Well, THAT muddle, if you like! There's a slum within a mile of us</p>
<p>already. The dust and blacks get worse and worse, Sissie?"</p>
<p>"They do," agreed Miss Gamer.</p>
<p>"Mr. Remington stands for construction, order, education, discipline."</p>
<p>"And you?" said the doctor.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2129">I'm</a> a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2130">good</a> Remington-ite."</p>
<p>"Discipline!" said the doctor.</p>
<p>"Oh!" said Isabel. "At times one has to be-Napoleonic. They want</p>
<p>to libel me, Mr. Remington. A political worker can't always be in</p>
<p>time for meals, can she? At times one has to make-splendid cuts."</p>
<p>Miss Gamer said something indistinctly.</p>
<p>"Order, education, discipline," said Sir Graham. "Excellent things!</p>
<p>But I've a sort of memory-in my young days-we talked about</p>
<p>something called liberty."</p>
<p>"Liberty under the law," I said, with an unexpected approving murmur</p>
<p>from Margaret, and took up the defence. "The old Liberal definition</p>
<p>of liberty was a trifle uncritical. Privilege and legal</p>
<p>restrictions are not the only enemies of liberty. An uneducated,</p>
<p>underbred, and underfed propertyless man is a man who has lost the</p>
<p>possibility of liberty. There's no liberty worth a rap for him. A</p>
<p>man who is swimming hopelessly for life wants nothing but the</p>
<p>liberty to get out of the water; he'll give every other liberty for</p>
<p>it-until he gets out."</p>
<p>Sir Graham took me up and we fell into a discussion of the changing</p>
<p>qualities of Liberalism. It was a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2131">good</a> give-and-take talk,</p>
<p>extraordinarily refreshing after the nonsense and crowding secondary</p>
<p>issues of the electioneering outside. We all contributed more or</p>
<p>less except Miss Gamer; Margaret followed with knitted brows and</p>
<p>occasional interjections. "People won't SEE that," for example, and</p>
<p>"It all seems so plain to me." The doctor showed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2132">himself</a> clever but</p>
<p>unsubstantial and inconsistent. Isabel sat back with her black mop</p>
<p>of hair buried deep in the chair looking quickly from face to face.</p>
<p>Her colour came and went with her vivid intellectual excitement;</p>
<p>occasionally she would dart a word, usually a very apt word, like a</p>
<p>lizard's tongue into the discussion. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2133">remember</a> chiefly that a</p>
<p>chance illustration betrayed that she had read Bishop Burnet…</p>
<p>After that it was not surprising that Isabel should ask for a lift</p>
<p>in our car as far as the Lurky Committee Room, and that she should</p>
<p>offer me quite sound advice EN ROUTE upon the intellectual</p>
<p>temperament of the Lurky gasworkers.</p>
<p>On the third occasion that I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2134">saw</a> Isabel she was, as I have said,</p>
<p>climbing a tree-and a very creditable tree-for her own private</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2135">satisfaction</a>. It was a lapse from the high seriousness of politics,</p>
<p>and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2136">perceived</a> she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2137">felt</a> that I might regard it as such and attach</p>
<p>too much importance to it. I had some difficulty in reassuring her.</p>
<p>And it's odd to note now-it has never occurred to me before-that</p>
<p>from that day to this I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2138">think</a> I have ever reminded Isabel of</p>
<p>that encounter.</p>
<p>And after that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2139">memory</a> she seems to be flickering about always in the</p>
<p>election, an inextinguishable flame; now she flew by on her bicycle,</p>
<p>now she dashed into committee rooms, now she appeared on doorsteps</p>
<p>in animated conversation with dubious voters; I took every chance I</p>
<p>could to talk to her-I had never met anything like her before in</p>
<p>the world, and she interested me immensely-and before the polling</p>
<p>day she and I had become, in the frankest simplicity, fast</p>
<p>friends…</p>
<p>That, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2140">think</a>, sets out very fairly the facts of our early</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2141">relationship</a>. But it is hard to get it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2142">true</a>, either in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2143">form</a> or</p>
<p>texture, because of the bright, translucent, coloured, and</p>
<p>refracting <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2144">memories</a> that come between. One forgets not only the</p>
<p>tint and quality of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2145">thoughts</a> and impressions through that</p>
<p>intervening haze, one forgets them altogether. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2146">remember</a> now</p>
<p>that I ever <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2145">thought</a> in those days of passionate love or the</p>
<p>possibility of such love between us. I may have done so again and</p>
<p>again. But I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2147">doubt</a> it very strongly. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2140">think</a> I ever <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2145">thought</a></p>
<p>of such aspects. I had no more sense of any danger between us,</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2148">seeing</a> the years and things that separated us, than I could have had</p>
<p>if she had been an intelligent bright-eyed bird. Isabel came into</p>
<p>my life as a new sort of thing; she didn't join on at all to my</p>
<p>previous <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2149">experiences</a> of womanhood. They were not, as I have</p>
<p>laboured to explain, either very wide or very penetrating</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2149">experiences</a>, on the whole, "strangled dinginess" expresses them, but</p>
<p>I do not believe they were narrower or shallower than those of many</p>
<p>other men of my class. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2145">thought</a> of women as pretty things and</p>
<p>beautiful things, pretty rather than beautiful, attractive and at</p>
<p>times disconcertingly attractive, often bright and witty, but,</p>
<p>because of the vast reservations that hid them from me, wanting,</p>
<p>subtly and inevitably wanting, in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2150">understanding</a>. My idealisation of</p>
<p>Margaret had evaporated insensibly after our marriage. The shrine I</p>
<p>had made for her in my private <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2145">thoughts</a> stood at last undisguisedly</p>
<p>empty. But Isabel did not for a moment admit of either idealisation</p>
<p>or interested contempt. She opened a new sphere of womanhood to me.</p>
<p>With her steady amber-brown eyes, her unaffected interest in</p>
<p>impersonal things, her upstanding waistless blue body, her energy,</p>
<p>decision and courage, she seemed rather some new and infinitely</p>
<p>finer <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2143">form</a> of boyhood than a feminine creature, as I had come to</p>
<p>measure femininity. She was my perfect friend. Could I have</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2151">foreseen</a>, had my world been more <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2152">wisely</a> planned, to this day we</p>
<p>might have been such friends.</p>
<p>She seemed at that time unconscious of sex, though she has told me</p>
<p>since how full she was of protesting curiosities and restrained</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2153">emotions</a>. She spoke, as indeed she has always spoken, simply,</p>
<p>clearly, and vividly; schoolgirl slang mingled with words that</p>
<p>marked ample voracious reading, and she moved quickly with the free</p>
<p>directness of some graceful young animal. She took many of the easy</p>
<p>freedoms a man or a sister might have done with me. She would <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2154">touch</a></p>
<p>my arm, lay a hand on my shoulder as I sat, adjust the lapel of a</p>
<p>breast-pocket as she talked to me. She says now she loved me always</p>
<p>from the beginning. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2155">doubt</a> if there was a suspicion of that in her</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2156">mind</a> those days. I used to find her regarding me with the clearest,</p>
<p>steadiest gaze in the world, exactly like the gaze of some nice</p>
<p>healthy innocent animal in a forest, interested, inquiring,</p>
<p>speculative, but singularly untroubled…</p>

<p>Polling day came after a last hoarse and dingy crescendo. The</p>
<p>excitement was not of the sort that makes one forget one is tired</p>
<p>out. The waiting for the end of the count has left a long blank</p>
<p>mark on my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2157">memory</a>, and then everyone was shaking my hand and</p>
<p>repeating: "Nine hundred and seventy-six."</p>
<p>My success had been a foregone conclusion since the afternoon, but</p>
<p>we all <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2158">behaved</a> as though we had not been anticipating this result</p>
<p>for hours, as though any other figures but nine hundred and seventy-</p>
<p>six would have meant something entirely different. "Nine hundred</p>
<p>and seventy-six!" said Margaret. "They didn't expect three</p>
<p>hundred."</p>
<p>"Nine hundred and seventy-six," said a little short man with a</p>
<p>paper. "It means a big turnover. Two dozen short of a thousand,</p>
<p>you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2159">know</a>."</p>
<p>A tremendous hullaboo began outside, and a lot of fresh people came</p>
<p>into the room.</p>
<p>Isabel, flushed but not out of breath, Heaven <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2160">knows</a> where she had</p>
<p>sprung from at that time of night! was running her hand down my</p>
<p>sleeve almost caressingly, with the innocent bold affection of a</p>
<p>girl. "Got you in!" she said. "It's been no end of a lark."</p>
<p>"And now," said I, "I must go and be constructive."</p>
<p>"Now you must go and be constructive," she said.</p>
<p>"You've got to live here," she added.</p>
<p>"By Jove! yes," I said. "We'll have to house hunt."</p>
<p>"I shall read all your speeches."</p>
<p>She hesitated.</p>
<p>"I wish I was you," she said, and said it as though it was not</p>
<p>exactly the thing she was meaning to say.</p>
<p>"They want you to speak," said Margaret, with something unsaid in</p>
<p>her face.</p>
<p>"You must come out with me," I answered, putting my arm through</p>
<p>hers, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2161">felt</a> someone urging me to the French windows that gave on</p>
<p>the balcony.</p>
<p>"If you think-" she said, yielding gladly</p>
<p>"Oh, RATHER!" said I.</p>
<p>The Mayor of Kinghamstead, a managing little man with no great</p>
<p>belief in my oratorical powers, was sticking his face up to mine.</p>
<p>"It's all over," he said, " and you've won. Say all the nice things</p>
<p>you can and say them plainly."</p>
<p>I turned and handed Margaret out through the window and stood</p>
<p>looking over the Market-place, which was more than half filled with</p>
<p>swaying people. The crowd set up a roar of approval at the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2162">sight</a> of</p>
<p>us, tempered by a little booing. Down in one corner of the square a</p>
<p>fight was going on for a flag, a fight that even the prospect of a</p>
<p>speech could not instantly check. "Speech!" cried voices, "Speech!"</p>
<p>and then a brief "boo-oo-oo" that was drowned in a cascade of shouts</p>
<p>and cheers. The conflict round the flag culminated in the smashing</p>
<p>of a pane of glass in the chemist's window and instantly sank to</p>
<p>peace.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen voters of the Kinghamstead Division," I began.</p>
<p>"Votes for Women!" yelled a voice, amidst laughter-the first time I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2163">remember</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2164">hearing</a> that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2165">memorable</a> war-cry.</p>
<p>"Three cheers for Mrs. Remington!"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Remington asks me to thank you," I said, amidst further uproar</p>
<p>and reiterated cries of "Speech!"</p>
<p>Then silence came with a startling swiftness.</p>
<p>Isabel was still in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2166">mind</a>, I suppose. "I shall go to</p>
<p>Westminster," I began. I sought for some compelling phrase and</p>
<p>could not find one. "To do my share," I went on, "in building up a</p>
<p>great and splendid civilisation."</p>
<p>I paused, and there was a weak gust of cheering, and then a renewal</p>
<p>of booing.</p>
<p>"This election," I said, " has been the end and the beginning of</p>
<p>much. New ideas are abroad-"</p>
<p>"Chinese labour," yelled a voice, and across the square swept a</p>
<p>wildfire of booting and bawling.</p>
<p>It is one of the few occasions when I quite lost my hold on a</p>
<p>speech. I glanced sideways and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2167">saw</a> the Mayor of Kinghamstead</p>
<p>speaking behind his hand to Parvill. By a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2168">happy</a> chance Parvill</p>
<p>caught my eye.</p>
<p>"What do they want?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Eh?"</p>
<p>"What do they want?"</p>
<p>"Say something about general fairness-the other side," prompted</p>
<p>Parvill, flattered but a little surprised by my appeal. I pulled</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2169">myself</a> hastily into a more popular strain with a gross eulogy of my</p>
<p>opponent's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2170">good</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2171">taste</a>.</p>
<p>"Chinese labour!" cried the voice again.</p>
<p>"You've given that notice to quit," I answered.</p>
<p>The Market-place roared delight, but whether that delight expressed</p>
<p>hostility to Chinamen or hostility to their practical enslavement no</p>
<p>student of the General Election of 1906 has ever been able to</p>
<p>determine. Certainly one of the most <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2172">effective</a> posters on our side</p>
<p>displayed a hideous yellow face, just that and nothing more. There</p>
<p>was not even a legend to it. How it impressed the electorate we did</p>
<p>not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2173">know</a>, but that it impressed the electorate profoundly there can</p>
<p>be no disputing.</p>

<p>Kinghamstead was one of the earliest constituencies fought, and we</p>
<p>came back-it must have been Saturday-triumphant but very tired, to</p>
<p>our house in Radnor Square. In the train we read the first</p>
<p>intimations that the victory of our party was likely to be a</p>
<p>sweeping one.</p>
<p>Then came a period when one was going about receiving and giving</p>
<p>congratulations and watching the other men arrive, very like a boy</p>
<p>who has returned to school with the first batch after the holidays.</p>
<p>The London world reeked with the General Election; it had invaded</p>
<p>the nurseries. All the children of one's friends had got big maps</p>
<p>of England cut up into squares to represent constituencies and were</p>
<p>busy sticking gummed blue labels over the conquered red of Unionism</p>
<p>that had hitherto submerged the country. And there were also orange</p>
<p>labels, if I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2174">remember</a> rightly, to represent the new Labour party,</p>
<p>and green for the Irish. I engaged <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2175">myself</a> to speak at one or two</p>
<p>London meetings, and lunched at the Reform, which was fairly tepid,</p>
<p>and dined and spent one or two tumultuous evenings at the National</p>
<p>Liberal Club, which was in active eruption. The National Liberal</p>
<p>became feverishly congested towards midnight as the results of the</p>
<p>counting came dropping in. A big green-baize screen had been fixed</p>
<p>up at one end of the large smoking-room with the names of the</p>
<p>constituencies that were voting that day, and directly the figures</p>
<p>came to hand, up they went, amidst cheers that at last lost their</p>
<p>energy through sheer repetition, whenever there was record of a</p>
<p>Liberal gain. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2174">remember</a> what happened when there was a</p>
<p>Liberal loss; I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2176">think</a> that any were announced while I was</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>How packed and noisy the place was, and what a reek of tobacco and</p>
<p>whisky fumes we made! Everybody was excited and talking, making</p>
<p>waves of harsh <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2177">confused</a> sound that beat upon one's ears, and every</p>
<p>now and then hoarse voices would shout for someone to speak. Our</p>
<p>little set was much in evidence. Both the Cramptons were in, Lewis,</p>
<p>Bunting Harblow. We gave brief addresses attuned to this excitement</p>
<p>and the late hour, amidst much enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Now we can DO things!" I said amidst a rapture of applause. Men I</p>
<p>did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2178">know</a> from Adam held up glasses and nodded to me in solemn</p>
<p>fuddled approval as I came down past them into the crowd again.</p>
<p>Men were betting whether the Unionists would lose more or less than</p>
<p>two hundred seats.</p>
<p>"I wonder just what we shall do with it all," I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2179">heard</a> one sceptic</p>
<p>speculating…</p>
<p>After these orgies I would get home very tired and excited, and find</p>
<p>it difficult to get to sleep. I would lie and speculate about what</p>
<p>it was we WERE going to do. One hadn't anticipated quite such a</p>
<p>tremendous accession to power for one's party. Liberalism was</p>
<p>swirling in like a flood…</p>
<p>I found the next few weeks very unsatisfactory and distressing. I</p>
<p>don't clearly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2180">remember</a> what it was I had expected; I suppose the</p>
<p>fuss and strain of the General Election had built up a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2181">feeling</a> that</p>
<p>my return would in some way put power into my hands, and instead I</p>
<p>found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2182">myself</a> a mere undistinguished unit in a vast but rather vague</p>
<p>majority. There were moments when I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2183">felt</a> very distinctly that a</p>
<p>majority could be too big a crowd altogether. I had all my work</p>
<p>still before me, I had achieved nothing as yet but opportunity, and</p>
<p>a very crowded opportunity it was at that. Everyone about me was</p>
<p>chatting Parliament and appointments; one breathed distracting and</p>
<p>irritating speculations as to what would be done and who would be</p>
<p>asked to do it. I was chiefly impressed by what was unlikely to be</p>
<p>done and by the absence of any general plan of legislation to hold</p>
<p>us all together. I found the talk about Parliamentary procedure and</p>
<p>etiquette particularly trying. We dined with the elder Cramptons</p>
<p>one evening, and old Sir Edward was lengthily <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2184">sage</a> about what the</p>
<p>House liked, what it didn't like, what made a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2185">good</a> impression and</p>
<p>what a bad one. "A man shouldn't speak more than twice in his first</p>
<p>session, and not at first on too contentious a topic," said Sir</p>
<p>Edward. "No."</p>
<p>"Very much depends on manner. The House <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2186">hates</a> a lecturer. There's</p>
<p>a sort of airy earnestness-"</p>
<p>He waved his cigar to eke out his words.</p>
<p>"Little peculiarities of costume count for a great deal. I could</p>
<p>name one man who spent three years living down a pair of</p>
<p>spatterdashers. On the other hand-a thing like that-if it catches</p>
<p>the eye of the PUNCH man, for example, may be your making."</p>
<p>He went off into a lengthy speculation of why the House had come to</p>
<p>like an originally unpopular Irishman named Biggar…</p>
<p>The opening of Parliament gave me some peculiar moods. I began to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2187">feel</a> more and more like a branded sheep. We were sworn in in</p>
<p>batches, dozens and scores of fresh men, trying not to look too</p>
<p>fresh under the inspection of policemen and messengers, all of us</p>
<p>carrying new silk hats and wearing magisterial coats. It is one of</p>
<p>my vivid <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2188">memories</a> from this period, the sudden outbreak of silk hats</p>
<p>in the smoking-room of the National Liberal Club. At first I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2189">thought</a> there must have been a funeral. Familiar faces that one had</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2190">grown</a> to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2191">know</a> under soft <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2187">felt</a> hats, under bowlers, under liberal-</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2192">minded</a> wide brims, and above artistic ties and tweed jackets,</p>
<p>suddenly met one, staring with the stern gaze of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2193">self-consciousness</a>,</p>
<p>from under silk hats of incredible glossiness. There was a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2194">disposition</a> to wear the hat much too forward, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2189">thought</a>, for a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2195">good</a></p>
<p>Parliamentary style.</p>
<p>There was much play with the hats all through; a tremendous</p>
<p>competition to get in first and put hats on coveted seats. A <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2196">memory</a></p>
<p>hangs about me of the House in the early afternoon, an inhumane</p>
<p>desolation inhabited almost entirely by silk hats. The current use</p>
<p>of cards to secure seats came later. There were yards and yards of</p>
<p>empty green benches with hats and hats and hats distributed along</p>
<p>them, resolute-looking top hats, lax top hats with a kind of shadowy</p>
<p>grin under them, sensible top bats brim upward, and one scandalous</p>
<p>incontinent that had rolled from the front Opposition bench right to</p>
<p>the middle of the floor. A headless hat is surely the most soulless</p>
<p>thing in the world, far worse even than a skull…</p>
<p>At last, in a leisurely muddled manner we got to the Address; and I</p>
<p>found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2197">myself</a> packed in a dense elbowing crowd to the right of the</p>
<p>Speaker's chair; while the attenuated Opposition, nearly leaderless</p>
<p>after the massacre, tilted its brim to its nose and sprawled at its</p>
<p>ease amidst its empty benches.</p>
<p>There was a tremendous hullaboo about something, and I craned to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2198">see</a></p>
<p>over the shoulder of the man in front. ''Order, order, order!"</p>
<p>"What's it about?" I asked.</p>
<p>The man in front of me was clearly no better informed, and then I</p>
<p>gathered from a slightly contemptuous Scotchman beside me that it</p>
<p>was Chris Robinson had walked between the bonourable member in</p>
<p>possession of the house and the Speaker. I caught a glimpse of him</p>
<p>blushingly whispering about his misadventure to a colleague. He was</p>
<p>just that same little figure I had once assisted to entertain at</p>
<p>Cambridge, but grey-haired now, and still it seemed with the same</p>
<p>knitted muffler he had discarded for a reckless half-hour while he</p>
<p>talked to us in Hatherleigh's rooms.</p>
<p>It dawned upon me that I wasn't particularly wanted in the House,</p>
<p>and that I should get all I needed of the opening speeches next day</p>
<p>from the TIMES.</p>
<p>I made my way out and was presently walking rather aimlessly through</p>
<p>the outer lobby.</p>
<p>I caught <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2199">myself</a> regarding the shadow that spread itself out before</p>
<p>me, multiplied itself in blue tints of various intensity, shuffled</p>
<p>itself like a pack of cards under the many lights, the square</p>
<p>shoulders, the silk hat, already worn with a parliamentary tilt</p>
<p>backward; I found I was surveying this statesmanlike outline with a</p>
<p>weak approval. "A MEMBER!" I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2200">felt</a> the little cluster of people that</p>
<p>were scattered about the lobby must be saying.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2201">Good</a> God!" I said in hot reaction, "what am I doing here?"</p>
<p>It was one of those moments infinitely trivial in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2202">themselves</a>, that</p>
<p>yet are cardinal in a man's life. It came to me with extreme</p>
<p>vividness that it wasn't so much that I had got hold of something as</p>
<p>that something had got hold of me. I distinctly recall the rebound</p>
<p>of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2203">mind</a>. Whatever happened in this Parliament, I at least would</p>
<p>attempt something. "By God!" I said, "I won't be overwhelmed. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2204">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2205">am</a></p>
<p>here to do something, and do something I will!"</p>
<p>But I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2206">felt</a> that for the moment I could not remain in the House.</p>
<p>I went out by <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2207">myself</a> with my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2208">thoughts</a> into the night. It was a</p>
<p>chilling night, and rare spots of rain were falling. I glanced over</p>
<p>my shoulder at the lit windows of the Lords. I walked, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2209">remember</a>,</p>
<p>westward, and presently came to the Grosvenar Embankment and</p>
<p>followed it, watching the glittering black rush of the river and the</p>
<p>dark, dimly lit barges round which the water swirled. Across the</p>
<p>river was the hunched sky-line of Doulton's potteries, and a kiln</p>
<p>flared redly. Dimly luminous trams were gliding amidst a dotted</p>
<p>line of lamps, and two little trains crawled into Waterloo station.</p>
<p>Mysterious black figures came by me and were suddenly changed to the</p>
<p>commonplace at the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2210">touch</a> of the nearer lamps. It was a big <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2211">confused</a></p>
<p>world, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2212">felt</a>, for a man to lay his hands upon.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2213">remember</a> I crossed Vauxhall Bridge and stood for a time watching</p>
<p>the huge black shapes in the darkness under the gas-works. A shoal</p>
<p>of coal barges lay indistinctly on the darkly shining mud and water</p>
<p>below, and a colossal crane was perpetually hauling up coal into</p>
<p>mysterious blacknesses above, and dropping the empty clutch back to</p>
<p>the barges. Just one or two minute black featureless figures of men</p>
<p>toiled amidst these monster shapes. They did not seem to be</p>
<p>controlling them but only moving about among them. These gas-works</p>
<p>have a big chimney that belches a lurid flame into the night, a</p>
<p>livid shivering bluish flame, shot with strange crimson streaks…</p>
<p>On the other side of Lambeth Bridge broad stairs go down to the</p>
<p>lapping water of the river; the lower steps are luminous under the</p>
<p>lamps and one treads unwarned into thick soft Thames mud. They seem</p>
<p>to be purely architectural steps, they lead nowhere, they have an</p>
<p>air of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2214">absolute</a> indifference to mortal ends.</p>
<p>Those shapes and large inhuman places-for all of mankind that one</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2215">sees</a> at night about Lambeth is minute and pitiful beside the</p>
<p>industrial monsters that snort and toil there-mix up inextricably</p>
<p>with my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2216">memories</a> of my first days as a legislator. Black figures</p>
<p>drift by me, heavy vans clatter, a newspaper rough tears by on a</p>
<p>motor bicycle, and presently, on the Albert Embankment, every seat</p>
<p>has its one or two outcasts huddled together and slumbering.</p>
<p>"These things come, these things go," a whispering voice urged upon</p>
<p>me, "as once those vast unmeaning Saurians whose bones encumber</p>
<p>museums came and went rejoicing noisily in fruitless lives."…</p>
<p>Fruitless lives!-was that the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2217">truth</a> of it all?…</p>
<p>Later I stood within <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2218">sight</a> of the Houses of Parliament in front of</p>
<p>the colonnades of St Thomas's Hospital. I leant on the parapet</p>
<p>close by a lamp-stand of twisted dolphins-and I prayed!</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2219">remember</a> the swirl of the tide upon the water, and how a string of</p>
<p>barges presently came swinging and bumping round as high-water</p>
<p>turned to ebb. That sudden change of position and my brief</p>
<p>perplexity at it, sticks like a paper pin through the substance of</p>
<p>my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2220">thoughts</a>. It was then I was moved to prayer. I prayed that</p>
<p>night that life might not be in vain, that in particular I might not</p>
<p>live in vain. I prayed for strength and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2221">faith</a>, that the monstrous</p>
<p>blundering forces in life might not overwhelm me, might not beat me</p>
<p>back to futility and a meaningless acquiescence in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2222">existent</a> things.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2223">knew</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2224">myself</a> for the weakling I was, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2223">knew</a> that nevertheless it</p>
<p>was set for me to make such order as I could out of these disorders,</p>
<p>and my task cowed me, gave me at the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2220">thought</a> of it a sense of</p>
<p>yielding feebleness.</p>
<p>"Break me, O God," I prayed at last, "disgrace me, torment me,</p>
<p>destroy me as you will, but save me from <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2225">self-complacency</a> and little</p>
<p>interests and little successes and the life that passes like the</p>
<p>shadow of a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2226">dream</a>."</p>

<p>I have been planning and replanning, writing and rewriting, this</p>
<p>next portion of my book for many days. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2227">perceive</a> I must leave it</p>
<p>raw edged and ill joined. I have learnt something of the</p>
<p>impossibility of History. For all I have had to tell is the story</p>
<p>of one man's convictions and aims and how they reacted upon his</p>
<p>life; and I find it too subtle and involved and intricate for the</p>
<p>doing. I find it taxes all my powers to convey even the main <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2228">forms</a></p>
<p>and forces in that development. It is like looking through moving</p>
<p>media of changing hue and variable refraction at something vitally</p>
<p>unstable. Broad theories and generalisations are mingled with</p>
<p>personal <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2229">influences</a>, with prevalent prejudices; and not only</p>
<p>coloured but altered by phases of hopefulness and moods of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2230">depression</a>. The web is made up of the most diverse elements, beyond</p>
<p>treatment multitudinous… For a week or so I desisted</p>
<p>altogether, and walked over the mountains and returned to sit</p>
<p>through the warm soft mornings among the shaded rocks above this</p>
<p>little perched-up house of ours, discussing my difficulties with</p>
<p>Isabel and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2231">think</a> on the whole complicating them further in the</p>
<p>effort to simplify them to manageable and stateable elements.</p>
<p>Let me, nevertheless, attempt a rough preliminary analysis of this</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2232">confused</a> process. A main strand is quite easily traceable. This</p>
<p>main strand is the story of my obvious life, my life as it must have</p>
<p>looked to most of my acquaintances. It presents you with a young</p>
<p>couple, bright, hopeful, and energetic, starting out under Altiora's</p>
<p>auspices to make a career. You figure us well dressed and active,</p>
<p>running about in motor-cars, visiting in great people's houses,</p>
<p>dining amidst brilliant companies, going to the theatre, meeting in</p>
<p>the lobby. Margaret wore hundreds of beautiful dresses. We must</p>
<p>have had an air of succeeding meritoriously during that time.</p>
<p>We did very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2233">continually</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2234">faithfully</a> serve our joint career. I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2235">thought</a> about it a great deal, and did and refrained from doing ten</p>
<p>thousand things for the sake of it. I kept up a solicitude for it,</p>
<p>as it were by inertia, long after things had happened and changes</p>
<p>occurred in me that rendered its completion impossible. Under</p>
<p>certain very artless pretences, we wanted steadfastly to make a</p>
<p>handsome position in the world, achieve respect, SUCCEED. Enormous</p>
<p>unseen changes had been in progress for years in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2236">mind</a> and the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2237">realities</a> of my life, before our general circle could have had any</p>
<p>inkling of their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2238">existence</a>, or suspected the appearances of our</p>
<p>life. Then suddenly our proceedings began to be deflected, our</p>
<p>outward unanimity visibly strained and marred by the insurgence of</p>
<p>these so long-hidden developments.</p>
<p>That career had its own hidden side, of course; but when I write of</p>
<p>these unseen factors I do not mean that but something altogether</p>
<p>broader. I do not mean the everyday pettinesses which gave the</p>
<p>cynical observer scope and told of a narrower, baser aspect of the</p>
<p>fair but <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2239">limited</a> ambitions of my ostensible <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2240">self</a>. This "sub-</p>
<p>careerist" element noted little things that affected the career,</p>
<p>made me suspicious of the rivalry of so-and-so, propitiatory to so-</p>
<p>and-so, whom, as a matter of fact, I didn't respect or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2241">feel</a> in the</p>
<p>least sympathetic towards; guarded with that man, who for all his</p>
<p>charm and interest wasn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2242">helpful</a>, and a little <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2243">touchy</a> at the</p>
<p>appearance of neglect from that. No, I mean something greater and</p>
<p>not something smaller when I write of a hidden life.</p>
<p>In the ostensible <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2244">self</a> who glowed under the approbation of Altiora</p>
<p>Bailey, and was envied and discussed, praised and depreciated, in</p>
<p>the House and in smoking-room gossip, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2245">really</a> have as much of a</p>
<p>man as usually figures in a novel or an obituary notice. But <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2246">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2247">am</a></p>
<p>tremendously impressed now in the retrospect by the realisation of</p>
<p>how little that frontage represented me, and just how little such</p>
<p>frontages do represent the complexities of the intelligent</p>
<p>contemporary. Behind it, yet struggling to disorganise and alter</p>
<p>it, altogether, was a far more essential <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2248">reality</a>, a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2244">self</a> less</p>
<p>personal, less individualised, and broader in its references. Its</p>
<p>aims were never simply to get on; it had an altogether different</p>
<p>system of demands and satisfactions. It was critical, curious, more</p>
<p>than a little unfeeling-and relentlessly illuminating.</p>
<p>It is just the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2249">existence</a> and development of this more generalised</p>
<p>self-behind-the-frontage that is making modern life so much more</p>
<p>subtle and intricate to render, and so much more hopeful in its</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2250">relations</a> to the perplexities of the universe. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2251">see</a> this mental</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2252">spiritual</a> hinterland vary enormously in the people about me,</p>
<p>from a type which seems to keep, as people say, all its goods in the</p>
<p>window, to others who, like <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2253">myself</a>, come to regard the ostensible</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2249">existence</a> more and more as a mere experimental feeder and agent for</p>
<p>that greater personality behind. And this back-self has its history</p>
<p>of phases, its crises and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2254">happy</a> accidents and irrevocable</p>
<p>conclusions, more or less distinct from the adventures and</p>
<p>achievements of the ostensible <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2255">self</a>. It meets persons and phrases,</p>
<p>it assimilates the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2256">spirit</a> of a book, it is startled into new</p>
<p>realisations by some accident that seems altogether irrelevant to</p>
<p>the general tenor of one's life. Its increasing independence of the</p>
<p>ostensible career makes it the organ of corrective criticism; it</p>
<p>accumulates disturbing energy. Then it breaks our overt promises</p>
<p>and repudiates our pledges, coming down at last like an overbearing</p>
<p>mentor upon the small engagements of the pupil.</p>
<p>In the life of the individual it takes the role that the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2257">growth</a> of</p>
<p>philosophy, science, and creative literature may play in the</p>
<p>development of mankind.</p>

</title>
<p>It is curious to recall how Britten <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2258">helped</a> shatter that obvious,</p>
<p>lucidly explicable presentation of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2259">myself</a> upon which I had embarked</p>
<p>with Margaret. He returned to revive a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2260">memory</a> of adolescent <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2261">dreams</a></p>
<p>and a habit of adolescent frankness; he reached through my shallow</p>
<p>frontage as no one else seemed capable of doing, and dragged that</p>
<p>back-self into <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2262">relation</a> with it.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2263">remember</a> very distinctly a dinner and a subsequent walk with him</p>
<p>which presents itself now as altogether typical of the quality of</p>
<p>his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2264">influence</a>.</p>
<p>I had come upon him one day while lunching with Somers and Sutton at</p>
<p>the Playwrights' Club, and had asked him to dinner on the spur of</p>
<p>the moment. He was oddly the same curly-headed, red-faced</p>
<p>ventriloquist, and oddly different, rather seedy as well as untidy,</p>
<p>and at first a little inclined to make comparisons with my sleek</p>
<p>successfulness. But that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2265">disposition</a> presently evaporated, and his</p>
<p>talk was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2266">good</a> and fresh and provocative. And something that had</p>
<p>long been straining at its checks in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2267">mind</a> flapped over, and he</p>
<p>and I found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2268">ourselves</a> of one accord.</p>
<p>Altiora wasn't at this dinner. When she came matters were apt to</p>
<p>become <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2269">confusedly</a> strenuous. There was always a slight and</p>
<p>ineffectual struggle at the end on the part of Margaret to</p>
<p>anticipate Altiora's overpowering tendency to a rally and the</p>
<p>establishment of some entirely unjustifiable conclusion by a COUP-</p>
<p>DE-MAIN. When, however, Altiora was absent, the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2270">quieter</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2271">influence</a></p>
<p>of the Cramptons prevailed; temperance and information for its own</p>
<p>sake prevailed excessively over dinner and the play of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2272">thought</a>…</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2273">Good</a> Lord! what bores the Cramptons were! I wonder I endured</p>
<p>them as I did. They had all of them the trick of lying in wait</p>
<p>conversationally; they had no sense of the self-exposures, the</p>
<p>gallant experiments in statement that are necessary for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2273">good</a></p>
<p>conversation. They would watch one talking with an expression</p>
<p>exactly like peeping through bushes. Then they would, as it were,</p>
<p>dash out, dissent succinctly, contradict some secondary fact, and</p>
<p>back to cover. They gave one twilight nerves. Their wives were</p>
<p>easier but still difficult at a stretch; they talked a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2273">good</a> deal</p>
<p>about children and servants, but with an air caught from Altiora of</p>
<p>making observations upon sociological types. Lewis gossiped about</p>
<p>the House in an entirely finite manner. He never raised a</p>
<p>discussion; nobody ever raised a discussion. He would ask what we</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2272">thought</a> of Evesham's question that afternoon, and Edward would say</p>
<p>it was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2273">good</a>, and Mrs. Willie, who had been behind the grille, would</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2274">think</a> it was very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2273">good</a>, and then Willie, parting the branches, would</p>
<p>say rather conclusively that he didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2274">think</a> it was very much <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2273">good</a>,</p>
<p>and I would deny <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2275">hearing</a> the question in order to evade a profitless</p>
<p>statement of views in that vacuum, and then we would cast about in</p>
<p>our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2276">minds</a> for some other topic of equal interest…</p>
<p>On this occasion Altiora was absent, and to qualify our Young</p>
<p>Liberal bleakness we had Mrs. Millingham, with her white hair and</p>
<p>her fresh <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2277">mind</a> and complexion, and Esmeer. Willie Crampton was with</p>
<p>us, but not his wife, who was having her third baby on principle;</p>
<p>his brother Edward was present, and the Lewises, and of course the</p>
<p>Bunting Harblows. There was also some other lady. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2278">remember</a> her</p>
<p>as pale blue, but for the life of me I cannot <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2278">remember</a> her name.</p>
<p>Quite early there was a little breeze between Edward Crampton and</p>
<p>Esmeer, who had ventured an opinion about the partition of Poland.</p>
<p>Edward was at work then upon the seventh volume of his monumental</p>
<p>Life of Kosciusko, and a little impatient with views perhaps not</p>
<p>altogether false but betraying a lamentable ignorance of accessible</p>
<p>literature. At any rate, his correction of Esmeer was magisterial.</p>
<p>After that there was a distinct and not altogether delightful pause,</p>
<p>and then some one, it may have been the pale-blue lady, asked Mrs.</p>
<p>Lewis whether her aunt Lady Carmixter had returned from her rest-</p>
<p>and-sun-cure in Italy. That led to a rather anxiously sustained</p>
<p>talk about regimen, and Willie told us how he had profited by the</p>
<p>no-breakfast system. It had increased his power of work enormously.</p>
<p>He could get through ten hours a day now without inconvenience.</p>
<p>"What do you do?" said Esmeer abruptly.</p>
<p>"Oh! no end of work. There's all the estate and looking after</p>
<p>things."</p>
<p>"But publicly?"</p>
<p>"I asked three questions yesterday. And for one of them I had to</p>
<p>consult nine books!"</p>
<p>We were drifting, I could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2279">see</a>, towards Doctor Haig's system of</p>
<p>dietary, and whether the exclusion or inclusion of fish and chicken</p>
<p>were most conducive to high efficiency, when Britten, who had</p>
<p>refused lemonade and claret and demanded Burgundy, broke out, and</p>
<p>was discovered to be demanding in his throat just what we Young</p>
<p>Liberals <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2280">thought</a> we were up to?</p>
<p>"I want," said Britten, repeating his challenge a little louder, "to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2281">hear</a> just exactly what you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2282">think</a> you are doing in Parliament?"</p>
<p>Lewis laughed nervously, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2283">thought</a> we were "Seeking the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2284">Good</a> of</p>
<p>the Community."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"HOW?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Beneficient Legislation," said Lewis.</p>
<p>"Beneficient in what direction?" insisted Britten. "I want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2285">know</a></p>
<p>where you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2286">think</a> you are going."</p>
<p>"Amelioration of Social <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2287">Conditions</a>," said Lewis.</p>
<p>"That's only a phrase!"</p>
<p>"You wouldn't have me sketch bills at dinner?"</p>
<p>"I'd like you to indicate directions," said Britten, and waited.</p>
<p>"Upward and On," said Lewis with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2288">conscious</a> neatness, and turned to</p>
<p>ask Mrs. Bunting Harblow about her little boy's French.</p>
<p>For a time talk frothed over Britten's head, but the natural</p>
<p>mischief in Mrs. Millingham had been stirred, and she was presently</p>
<p>echoing his demand in lisping, quasi-confidential undertones. "What</p>
<p>ARE we Liberals doing?" Then Esmeer fell in with the</p>
<p>revolutionaries.</p>
<p>To begin with, I was a little shocked by this clamour for</p>
<p>fundamentals-and a little disconcerted. I had the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2289">experience</a> that</p>
<p>I suppose comes to every one at times of discovering oneself</p>
<p>together with two different sets of people with whom one has</p>
<p>maintained two different sets of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2290">attitudes</a>. It had always been, I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2291">perceived</a>, an instinctive suppression in our circle that we</p>
<p>shouldn't be more than vague about our political ideals. It had</p>
<p>almost become part of my morality to respect this convention. It</p>
<p>was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2292">understood</a> we were all working hard, and keeping <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2293">ourselves</a> fit,</p>
<p>tremendously fit, under Altiora's inspiration, Pro Bono Publico.</p>
<p>Bunting Harblow had his under-secretaryship, and Lewis was on the</p>
<p>verge of the Cabinet, and these things we considered to be in the</p>
<p>nature of confirmations… It added to tbe discomfort of the</p>
<p>situation that these plunging enquiries were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2294">being</a> made in the</p>
<p>presence of our wives.</p>
<p>The rebel section of our party forced the talk.</p>
<p>Edward Crampton was presently declaring-I forget in what <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2295">relation</a>:</p>
<p>"The country is with us."</p>
<p>My long-controlled <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2296">hatred</a> of the Cramptons' stereotyped phrases</p>
<p>about the Country and the House got the better of me. I showed my</p>
<p>cloven hoof to my friends for the first time.</p>
<p>"We don't respect the Country as we used to do," I said. "We</p>
<p>haven't the same belief we used to have in the will of the people.</p>
<p>It's no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2297">good</a>, Crampton, trying to keep that up. We Liberals <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2298">know</a> as</p>
<p>a matter of fact-nowadays every one knows-that the monster that</p>
<p>brought us into power has, among other deficiencies, no head. We've</p>
<p>got to give it one-if possible with brains and a will. That lies</p>
<p>in the future. For the present if the country is with us, it means</p>
<p>merely that we happen to have hold of its tether."</p>
<p>Lewis was shocked. A "mandate" from the Country was sacred to his</p>
<p>system of pretences.</p>
<p>Britten wasn't subdued by his first rebuff; presently he was at us</p>
<p>again. There were several attempts to check his outbreak of</p>
<p>interrogation; I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2299">remember</a> the Cramptons asked questions about the</p>
<p>welfare of various cousins of Lewis who were unknown to the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2300">rest</a> of</p>
<p>us, and Margaret tried to engage Britten in a sympathetic discussion</p>
<p>of the Arts and Crafts exhibition. But Britten and Esmeer were</p>
<p>persistent, Mrs. Millingham was mischievous, and in the end our</p>
<p>rising hopes of Young Liberalism took to their thickets for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2301">good</a>,</p>
<p>while we talked all over them of the prevalent vacuity of political</p>
<p>intentions. Margaret was perplexed by me. It is only now I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2302">perceive</a> just how perplexing I must have been. "Of course, she said</p>
<p>with that faint stress of apprehension in her eyes, one must have</p>
<p>aims." And, "it isn't always easy to put everything into phrases."</p>
<p>"Don't be long," said Mrs. Edward Crampton to her hsuband as the</p>
<p>wives trooped out. And afterwards when we went upstairs I had an</p>
<p>indefinable persuasion that the ladies had been criticising</p>
<p>Britten's share in our talk in an altogether unfavourable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2303">spirit</a>.</p>
<p>Mrs. Edward evidently <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2304">thought</a> him aggressive and impertinent, and</p>
<p>Margaret with a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2305">quiet</a> firmness that brooked no resistance, took him</p>
<p>at once into a corner and showed him Italian photographs by Coburn.</p>
<p>We dispersed early.</p>
<p>I walked with Britten along the Chelsea back streets towards</p>
<p>Battersea Bridge-he lodged on the south side.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Millingham's a dear," he began.</p>
<p>"She's a dear."</p>
<p>"I liked her demand for a hansom because a four-wheeler was too</p>
<p>safe."</p>
<p>"She was worked up," I said. "She's a woman of faultless <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2306">character</a>,</p>
<p>but her instincts, as Altiora would say, are anarchistic-when she</p>
<p>gives them a chance."</p>
<p>"So she takes it out in hansom cabs."</p>
<p>"Hansom cabs."</p>
<p>"She's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2307">wise</a>," said Britten…</p>
<p>"I hope, Remington," he went on after a pause, "I didn't rag your</p>
<p>other guests too much. I've a sort of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2308">feeling</a> at moments-</p>
<p>Remington, those chaps are so infernally not-not bloody. It's part</p>
<p>of a man's duty sometimes at least to eat red beef and get drunk.</p>
<p>How is he to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2309">understand</a> government if he doesn't? It scares me to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2310">think</a> of your lot-by a sort of misapprehension-being in power. A</p>
<p>kind of neuralgia in the head, by way of government. I don't</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2309">understand</a> where YOU come in. Those others-they've no lusts.</p>
<p>Their ideal is anaemia. You and I, we had at least a lust to take</p>
<p>hold of life and make something of it. They-they want to take hold</p>
<p>of life and make nothing of it. They want to cut out all the</p>
<p>stimulants. Just as though life was anything else but a reaction to</p>
<p>stimulation!"…</p>
<p>He began to talk of his own life. He had had ill-fortune through</p>
<p>most of it. He was poor and unsuccessful, and a girl he had been</p>
<p>very fond of had been attacked and killed by a horse in a field in a</p>
<p>very horrible manner. These things had wounded and tortured him,</p>
<p>but they hadn't broken him. They had, it seemed to me, made a kind</p>
<p>of crippled and ugly demigod of him. He was, I began to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2311">perceive</a>,</p>
<p>so much better than I had any right to expect. At first I had been</p>
<p>rather struck by his unkempt look, and it made my reaction all the</p>
<p>stronger. There was about him something, a kind of raw and bleeding</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2312">faith</a> in the deep things of life, that stirred me profoundly as he</p>
<p>showed it. My set of people had irritated him and disappointed him.</p>
<p>I discovered at his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2313">touch</a> how they irritated him. He reproached me</p>
<p>boldly. He made me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2314">feel</a> ashamed of my easy acquiescences as I</p>
<p>walked in my sleek tall neatness beside his rather old coat, his</p>
<p>rather battered hat, his sturdier shorter shape, and listened to his</p>
<p>denunciations of our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2315">self-satisfied</a> New Liberalism and</p>
<p>Progressivism.</p>
<p>"It has the same <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2316">relation</a> to progress-the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2317">reality</a> of progress-that</p>
<p>the things they paint on door panels in the suburbs have to art and</p>
<p>beauty. There's a sort of filiation… Your Altiora's just the</p>
<p>political equivalent of the ladies who sell traced cloth for</p>
<p>embroidery; she's a dealer in Refined Social Reform for the Parlour.</p>
<p>The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2318">real</a> progress, Remington, is a graver thing and a painfuller</p>
<p>thing and a slower thing altogether. Look! THAT"-and he pointed</p>
<p>to where under a boarding in the light of a gas lamp a dingy</p>
<p>prostitute stood lurking-" was in Babylon and Nineveh. Your little</p>
<p>lot make believe there won't be anything of the sort after this</p>
<p>Parliament! They're going to vanish at a few top notes from Altiora</p>
<p>Bailey! Remington!-it's foolery. It's prigs at play. It's make-</p>
<p>believe, make-believe! Your people there haven't got hold of</p>
<p>things, aren't beginning to get hold of things, don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2319">know</a> anything</p>
<p>of life at all, shirk life, avoid life, get in little bright clean</p>
<p>rooms and talk big over your bumpers of lemonade while the Night</p>
<p>goes by outside-untouched. Those Crampton fools slink by all</p>
<p>this,"-he waved at the woman again-"pretend it doesn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2320">exist</a>, or</p>
<p>is going to be banished root and branch by an Act to keep children</p>
<p>in the wet outside public-houses. Do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2321">think</a> they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2322">really</a> care,</p>
<p>Remington? I don't. It's make-believe. What they want to do, what</p>
<p>Lewis wants to do, what Mrs. Bunting Harblow wants her husband to</p>
<p>do, is to sit and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2323">feel</a> very grave and necessary and respected on the</p>
<p>Government benches. They <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2321">think</a> of putting their feet out like</p>
<p>statesmen, and tilting shiny hats with becoming brims down over</p>
<p>their successful noses. Presentation portrait to a club at fifty.</p>
<p>That's their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2317">Reality</a>. That's their scope. They don't, it's</p>
<p>manifest, WANT to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2321">think</a> beyond that. The things there ARE,</p>
<p>Remington, they'll never face! the wonder and the depth of life,-</p>
<p>lust, and the night-sky,-pain."</p>
<p>"But the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2324">good</a> intention," I pleaded, "the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2324">Good</a> Will!"</p>
<p>"Sentimentality," said Britten. "No <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2325">Good</a> Will is anything but</p>
<p>dishonesty unless it frets and burns and hurts and destroys a man.</p>
<p>That lot of yours have nothing but a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2325">good</a> will to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2326">think</a> they have</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2325">good</a> will. Do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2326">think</a> they lie <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2327">awake</a> of nights searching their</p>
<p>hearts as we do? Lewis? Crampton? Or those neat, admiring,</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2328">satisfied</a> little wives? <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2329">See</a> how they shrank from the probe!"</p>
<p>"We all," I said, "shrink from the probe."</p>
<p>"God <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2330">help</a> us!" said Britten…</p>
<p>"We are but vermin at the best, Remington," he broke out," and the</p>
<p>greatest saint only a worm that has lifted its head for a moment</p>
<p>from the dust. We are damned, we are meant to be damned, coral</p>
<p>animalculae building upward, upward in a sea of damnation. But of</p>
<p>all the damned things that ever were damned, your damned shirking,</p>
<p>temperate, sham-efficient, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2331">self-satisfied</a>, respectable, make-</p>
<p>believe, Fabian-spirited Young Liberal is tbe utterly damnedest."</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, and resumed in an entirely different note:</p>
<p>"Which is why I was so surprised, Remington, to find YOU in this</p>
<p>set!"</p>
<p>"You're just the old plunger you used to be, Britten," I said. "</p>
<p>You're going too far with all your might for the sake of the damns.</p>
<p>Like a donkey that drags its cart up a bank to get thistles.</p>
<p>There's depths in Liberalism-"</p>
<p>"We were talking about Liberals."</p>
<p>"Liberty!"</p>
<p>"Liberty! What do YOOR little lot <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2332">know</a> of liberty?"</p>
<p>"What does any little lot <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2333">know</a> of liberty?"</p>
<p>"It waits outside, too big for our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2334">understanding</a>. Like the night</p>
<p>and the stars. And lust, Remington! lust and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2335">bitterness</a>! Don't I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2336">know</a> them? with all the sweetness and hope of life bitten and</p>
<p>trampled, the dear eyes and the brain that loved and understood-and</p>
<p>my poor mumble of a life going on! <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2337">I'm</a> within <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2338">sight</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2339">being</a> a</p>
<p>drunkard, Remington! <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2337">I'm</a> a failure by most standards! Life has cut</p>
<p>me to the bone. But <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2337">I'm</a> not afraid of it any more. I've paid</p>
<p>something of the price, I've <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2340">seen</a> something of the meaning."</p>
<p>He flew off at a tangent. "I'd rather die in Delirium Tremens," he</p>
<p>cried, "than be a Crampton or a Lewis…"</p>
<p>"Make-believe. Make-believe." The phrase and Britten's squat</p>
<p>gestures haunted me as I walked homeward <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2341">alone</a>. I went to my room</p>
<p>and stood before my desk and surveyed papers and files and</p>
<p>Margaret's admirable equipment of me.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2342">perceived</a> in the lurid light of Britten's suggestions that so it</p>
<p>was Mr. George Alexander would have mounted a statesman's private</p>
<p>room…</p>
</section>

<title>
<p>3</p>
</title>
<p>I was never at any stage a loyal party man. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2343">doubt</a> if party will</p>
<p>ever again be the force it was during the eighteenth and nineteenth</p>
<p>centuries. Men are becoming increasingly constructive and</p>
<p>selective, less <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2344">patient</a> under tradition and the bondage of initial</p>
<p>circumstances. As education becomes more universal and liberating,</p>
<p>men will sort <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2345">themselves</a> more and more by their intellectual</p>
<p>temperaments and less and less by their accidental associations.</p>
<p>The past will rule them less; the future more. It is not simply</p>
<p>party but school and college and county and country that lose their</p>
<p>glamour. One does not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2346">hear</a> nearly as much as our forefathers did of</p>
<p>the "old Harrovian," "old Arvonian," "old Etonian" claim to this or</p>
<p>that unfair advantage or unearnt sympathy. Even the Scotch and the</p>
<p>Devonians weaken a little in their clannishness. A widening sense</p>
<p>of fair play destroys such things. They follow freemasonry down-</p>
<p>freemasonry of which one is chiefly reminded nowadays in England by</p>
<p>propitiatory symbols outside shady public-houses…</p>
<p>There is, of course, a type of man which clings very obstinately to</p>
<p>party ties. These are the men with strong reproductive imaginations</p>
<p>and no imaginative initiative, such men as Cladingbowl, for example,</p>
<p>or Dayton. They are the scholars-at-large in life. For them the</p>
<p>fact that the party system has been essential in the history of</p>
<p>England for two hundred years gives it an overwhelming glamour.</p>
<p>They have read histories and memoirs, they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2347">see</a> the great grey pile</p>
<p>of Westminster not so much for what it is as for what it was, rich</p>
<p>with dramatic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2348">memories</a>, populous with glorious ghosts, phrasing</p>
<p>itself inevitably in anecdotes and quotations. It seems almost</p>
<p>scandalous that new things should <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2349">continue</a> to happen, swamping with</p>
<p>strange qualities the savour of these old associations.</p>
<p>That Mr. Ramsay Macdonald should walk through Westminster Hall,</p>
<p>thrust <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2350">himself</a>, it may be, through the very piece of space that once</p>
<p>held Charles the Martyr pleading for his life, seems horrible</p>
<p>profanation to Dayton, a last posthumous outrage; and he would, I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2351">think</a>, like to have the front benches left empty now for ever, or at</p>
<p>most adorned with laureated ivory tablets: "Here Dizzy sat," and "On</p>
<p>this Spot William Ewart Gladstone made his First Budget Speech."</p>
<p>Failing this, he demands, if only as signs of modesty and respect on</p>
<p>the part of the survivors, meticulous imitation. "Mr. G.," he</p>
<p>murmurs, "would not have done that," and laments a vanished subtlety</p>
<p>even while Mr. Evesham is speaking. He is always gloomily <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2352">disposed</a></p>
<p>to lapse into wonderings about what things are coming to, wonderings</p>
<p>that have no grain of curiosity. His conception of perfect conduct</p>
<p>is industrious persistence along the worn-down, well-marked grooves</p>
<p>of the great recorded days. So infinitely more important to him is</p>
<p>the documented, respected thing than the elusive present.</p>
<p>Cladingbowl and Dayton do not shine in the House, though Cladingbowl</p>
<p>is a sound man on a committee, and Dayton keeps the OLD COUNTRY</p>
<p>GAZETTE, the most gentlemanly paper in London. They prevail,</p>
<p>however, in their clubs at lunch time. There, with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2353">pleasant</a></p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2354">consciousness</a> of a morning's work free from either zeal or shirking,</p>
<p>they mingle with permanent officials, prominent lawyers, even a few</p>
<p>of the soberer type of business men, and relax their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2355">minds</a> in the</p>
<p>discussion of the morning paper, of the architecture of the West</p>
<p>End, and of the latest public appointments, of golf, of holiday</p>
<p>resorts, of the last judicial witticisms and forensic "crushers."</p>
<p>The New Year and Birthday honours lists are always very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2356">sagely</a> and</p>
<p>exhaustively considered, and anecdotes are popular and keenly</p>
<p>judged. They do not talk of the things that are <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2357">really</a> active in</p>
<p>their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2355">minds</a>, but in the formal and habitual manner they suppose to</p>
<p>be proper to intelligent but still honourable men. Socialism,</p>
<p>individual money matters, and religion are forbidden topics, and sex</p>
<p>and women only in so far as they appear in the law courts. It is to</p>
<p>me the strangest of conventions, this assumption of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2358">unreal</a> loyalties</p>
<p>and traditional respects, this repudiation and concealment of</p>
<p>passionate interests. It is like wearing gloves in summer fields,</p>
<p>or bathing in a gown, or falling in love with the heroine of a</p>
<p>novel, or writing under a pseudonym, or becoming a masked Tuareg…</p>
<p>It is not, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2359">think</a>, that men of my species are insensitive to the</p>
<p>great past that is embodied in Westminster and its traditions; we</p>
<p>are not so much wanting in the historical sense as alive to the</p>
<p>greatness of our present opportunities and the still vaster future</p>
<p>that is possible to us. London is the most interesting, beautiful,</p>
<p>and wonderful city in the world to me, delicate in her incidental</p>
<p>and multitudinous littleness, and stupendous in her pregnant</p>
<p>totality; I cannot bring <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2360">myself</a> to use her as a museum or an old</p>
<p>bookshop. When I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2359">think</a> of Whitehall that little affair on the</p>
<p>scaffold outside the Banqueting Hall seems trivial and remote in</p>
<p>comparison with the possibilities that offer <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2361">themselves</a> to my</p>
<p>imagination within the great grey Government buildings close at</p>
<p>hand.</p>
<p>It gives me a qualm of nostalgia even to name those places now. I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2362">think</a> of St. Stephen's tower streaming upwards into the misty London</p>
<p>night and the great wet quadrangle of New Palace Yard, from which</p>
<p>the hansom cabs of my first <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2363">experiences</a> were ousted more and more by</p>
<p>taxicabs as the second Parliament of King Edward the Seventh aged; I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2362">think</a> of the Admiralty and War office with their tall Marconi masts</p>
<p>sending out invisible threads of direction to the armies in the</p>
<p>camps, to great fleets about the world. The crowded, darkly shining</p>
<p>river goes flooding through my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2364">memory</a> once again, on to those narrow</p>
<p>seas that part us from our rival nations; I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2365">see</a> quadrangles and</p>
<p>corridors of spacious grey-toned offices in which undistinguished</p>
<p>little men and little files of papers link us to islands in the</p>
<p>tropics, to frozen wildernesses gashed for gold, to vast temple-</p>
<p>studded plains, to forest worlds and mountain worlds, to ports and</p>
<p>fortresses and lighthouses and watch-towers and grazing lands and</p>
<p>corn lands all about the globe. Once more I traverse Victoria</p>
<p>Street, grimy and dark, where the Agents of the Empire jostle one</p>
<p>another, pass the big embassies in the West End with their flags and</p>
<p>scutcheons, follow the broad avenue that leads to Buckingham Palace,</p>
<p>witness the coming and going of troops and officials and guests</p>
<p>along it from every land on earth… Interwoven in the texture</p>
<p>of it all, mocking, perplexing, stimulating beyond measure, is the</p>
<p>gleaming <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2366">consciousness</a>, the challenging <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2367">knowledge</a>: "You and your</p>
<p>kind might still, if you could but grasp it here, mould all the</p>
<p>destiny of Man!"</p>

<p>My first three years in Parliament were years of active discontent.</p>
<p>The little group of younger Liberals to which I belonged was very</p>
<p>ignorant of the traditions and qualities of our older leaders, and</p>
<p>quite out of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2368">touch</a> with the mass of the party. For a time</p>
<p>Parliament was enormously taken up with moribund issues and old</p>
<p>quarrels. The early Educational legislation was sectarian and</p>
<p>unenterprising, and the Licensing Bill went little further than the</p>
<p>attempted rectification of a Conservative mistake. I was altogether</p>
<p>for the nationalisation of the public-houses, and of this end the</p>
<p>Bill gave no intimations. It was just beer-baiting. I was</p>
<p>recalcitrant almost from the beginning, and spoke against the</p>
<p>Government so early as the second reading of the first Education</p>
<p>Bill, the one the Lords rejected in 1906. I went a little beyond my</p>
<p>intention in the heat of speaking,-it is a way with inexperienced</p>
<p>man. I called the Bill timid, narrow, a mere sop to the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2369">jealousies</a></p>
<p>of sects and little-minded people. I contrasted its aim and methods</p>
<p>with the manifest needs of the time.</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2370">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2371">am</a> not a particularly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2372">good</a> speaker; after the manner of a writer I</p>
<p>worry to find my meaning too much; but this was one of my successes.</p>
<p>I spoke after dinner and to a fairly full House, for people were</p>
<p>already a little curious about me because of my writings. Several</p>
<p>of the Conservative leaders were present and stayed, and Mr.</p>
<p>Evesham, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2373">remember</a>, came ostentatiously to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2374">hear</a> me, with that</p>
<p>engaging friendliness of his, and gave me at the first chance an</p>
<p>approving "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2374">Hear</a>, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2374">Hear</a>!" I can still recall quite distinctly my two</p>
<p>futile attempts to catch the Speaker's eye before I was able to</p>
<p>begin, the nervous quiver of my rather too prepared opening, the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2375">effect</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2376">hearing</a> my own voice and my subconscious wonder as to what</p>
<p>I could possibly be talking about, the realisation that I was</p>
<p>getting on fairly well, the immense <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2377">satisfaction</a> afterwards of</p>
<p>having on the whole brought it off, and the absurd gratitude I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2378">felt</a></p>
<p>for that encouraging cheer.</p>
<p>Addressing the House of Commons is like no other public speaking in</p>
<p>the world. Its semi-colloquial methods give it an air of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2379">being</a></p>
<p>easy, but its shifting audience, the comings and goings and</p>
<p>hesitations of members behind the chair-not mere audience units,</p>
<p>but men who matter-the desolating emptiness that spreads itself</p>
<p>round the man who fails to interest, the little compact, disciplined</p>
<p>crowd in the strangers' gallery, the light, elusive, flickering</p>
<p>movements high up behind the grill, the wigged, attentive, weary</p>
<p>Speaker, the table and the mace and the chapel-like Gothic</p>
<p>background with its sombre shadows, conspire together, produce a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2380">confused</a>, uncertain <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2381">feeling</a> in me, as though I was walking upon a</p>
<p>pavement full of trap-doors and patches of uncovered morass. A</p>
<p>misplaced, well-meant "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2382">Hear</a>, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2382">Hear</a>!" is apt to be extraordinarily</p>
<p>disconcerting, and under no other circumstances have I had to speak</p>
<p>with quite the same sideways twist that the arrangement of the House</p>
<p>imposes. One does not recognise one's own voice threading out into</p>
<p>the stirring brown. Unless I was excited or speaking to the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2383">mind</a> of</p>
<p>some particular person in the house, I was apt to lose my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2381">feeling</a> of</p>
<p>an auditor. I had no sense of whither my sentences were going, such</p>
<p>as one has with a public meeting well under one's eye. And to lose</p>
<p>one's sense of an auditor is for a man of my temperament to lose</p>
<p>one's sense of the immediate, and to become prolix and vague with</p>
<p>qualifications.</p>

<p>My discontents with the Liberal party and my mental exploration of</p>
<p>the quality of party generally is curiously mixed up with certain</p>
<p>impressions of things and people in the National Liberal Club. The</p>
<p>National Liberal Club is Liberalism made visible in the flesh-and</p>
<p>Doultonware. It is an extraordinary big club done in a bold,</p>
<p>wholesale, shiny, marbled style, richly furnished with numerous</p>
<p>paintings, steel engravings, busts, and full-length statues of the</p>
<p>late Mr. Gladstone; and its spacious dining-rooms, its long, hazy,</p>
<p>crowded smoking-room with innumerable little tables and groups of</p>
<p>men in armchairs, its magazine room and library upstairs, have just</p>
<p>that undistinguished and unconcentrated diversity which is for me</p>
<p>the Liberal note. The pensive member sits and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2384">hears</a> perplexing</p>
<p>dialects and even fragments of foreign speech, and among the</p>
<p>clustering masses of less insistent whites his roving eye catches</p>
<p>profiles and complexions that send his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2385">mind</a> afield to Calcutta or</p>
<p>Rangoon or the West Indies or Sierra Leone or the Cape…</p>
<p>I was not infrequently that pensive member. I used to go to the</p>
<p>Club to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2386">doubt</a> about Liberalism.</p>
<p>About two o'clock in the day the great smoking-room is crowded with</p>
<p>countless little groups. They sit about small round tables, or in</p>
<p>circles of chairs, and the haze of tobacco seems to prolong the</p>
<p>great narrow place, with its pillars and bays, to infinity. Some of</p>
<p>the groups are big, as many as a dozen men talk in loud tones; some</p>
<p>are duologues, and there is always a sprinkling of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2387">lonely</a>,</p>
<p>dissociated men. At first one gets an impression of men going from</p>
<p>group to group and as it were linking them, but as one watches</p>
<p>closely one finds that these men just visit three or four groups at</p>
<p>the outside, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2388">know</a> nothing of the others. One begins to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2389">perceive</a></p>
<p>more and more distinctly that one is dealing with a sort of human</p>
<p>mosaic; that each patch in that great place is of a different</p>
<p>quality and colour from the next and never to be mixed with it.</p>
<p>Most clubs have a common link, a lowest common denominator in the</p>
<p>Club Bore, who spares no one, but even the National Liberal bores</p>
<p>are specialised and sectional. As one looks round one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2390">sees</a> here a</p>
<p>clump of men from the North Country or the Potteries, here an island</p>
<p>of South London politicians, here a couple of young Jews ascendant</p>
<p>from Whitechapel, here a circle of journalists and writers, here a</p>
<p>group of Irish politicians, here two East Indians, here a priest or</p>
<p>so, here a clump of old-fashioned Protestants, here a little knot of</p>
<p>eminent Rationalists indulging in a blasphemous story SOTTO VOCE.</p>
<p>Next them are a group of anglicised Germans and highly specialised</p>
<p>chess-players, and then two of the oddest-looking persons-bulging</p>
<p>with documents and intent upon extraordinary business transactions</p>
<p>over long cigars…</p>
<p>I would listen to a stormy sea of babblement, and try to extract</p>
<p>some constructive intimations. Every now and then I got a whiff of</p>
<p>politics. It was clear they were against the Lords-against</p>
<p>plutocrats-against Cossington's newspapers-against the brewers…</p>
<p>It was tremendously clear what they were against. The trouble</p>
<p>was to find out what on earth they were for!…</p>
<p>As I sat and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2391">thought</a>, the streaked and mottled pillars and wall, the</p>
<p>various views, aspects, and portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone, the</p>
<p>partitions of polished mahogany, the yellow-vested waiters, would</p>
<p>dissolve and vanish, and I would have a vision of this sample of</p>
<p>miscellaneous men of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2392">limited</a>, diverse interests and a universal</p>
<p>littleness of imagination enlarged, unlimited, no longer a sample</p>
<p>but a community, spreading, stretching out to infinity-all in</p>
<p>little groups and duologues and circles, all with their special and</p>
<p>narrow concerns, all with their backs to most of the others.</p>
<p>What but a common antagonism would ever keep these multitudes</p>
<p>together? I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2393">understood</a> why modern electioneering is more than half</p>
<p>of it denunciation. Let us condemn, if possible, let us obstruct</p>
<p>and deprive, but not let us do. There is no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2394">real</a> appeal to the</p>
<p>commonplace <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2395">mind</a> in "Let us do." That calls for the creative</p>
<p>imagination, and few have been accustomed to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2396">respond</a> to that call.</p>
<p>The other merely needs <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2397">jealousy</a> and bate, of which there are great</p>
<p>and easily accessible reservoirs in every human heart…</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2398">remember</a> that vision of endless, narrow, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2399">jealous</a> individuality</p>
<p>very vividly. A seething limitlessness it became at last, like a</p>
<p>waste place covered by crawling locusts that men sweep up by the</p>
<p>sackload and drown by the million in ditches…</p>
<p>Grotesquely against it came the lean features, the sidelong shy</p>
<p>movements of Edward Crampton, seated in a circle of talkers close at</p>
<p>hand. I had a whiff of his strained, unmusical voice, and behold!</p>
<p>he was saying something about the "Will of the People…"</p>
<p>The immense and wonderful disconnectednesses of human life! I</p>
<p>forgot the smoke and jabber of the club altogether; I became a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2400">lonely</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2401">spirit</a> flung aloft by some queer accident, a stone upon a</p>
<p>ledge in some high and rocky wilderness, and below as far as the eye</p>
<p>could reach stretched the swarming infinitesimals of humanity, like</p>
<p>grass upon the field, like pebbles upon unbounded beaches. Was</p>
<p>there ever to be in human life more than that endless struggling</p>
<p>individualism? Was there indeed some giantry, some immense valiant</p>
<p>synthesis, still to come-or present it might be and still unseen by</p>
<p>me, or was this the beginning and withal the last phase of</p>
<p>mankind?…</p>
<p>I glimpsed for a while the stupendous impudence of our ambitions,</p>
<p>the tremendous enterprise to which the modern statesman is</p>
<p>implicitly addressed. I was as it were one of a little swarm of</p>
<p>would-be reef builders looking back at the teeming slime upon the</p>
<p>ocean floor. All the history of mankind, all the history of life,</p>
<p>has been and will be the story of something struggling out of the</p>
<p>indiscriminated abyss, struggling to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2402">exist</a> and prevail over and</p>
<p>comprehend individual lives-an effort of insidious attraction, an</p>
<p>idea of invincible appeal. That something greater than <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2403">ourselves</a>,</p>
<p>which does not so much <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2402">exist</a> as seek <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2404">existence</a>, palpitating between</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2405">being</a> and not-being, how marvellous it is! It has worn the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2406">form</a> and</p>
<p>visage of ten thousand different gods, sought a shape for itself in</p>
<p>stone and ivory and music and wonderful words, spoken more and more</p>
<p>clearly of a mystery of love, a mystery of unity, dabbling meanwhile</p>
<p>in blood and cruelty beyond the common impulses of men. It is</p>
<p>something that comes and goes, like a light that shines and is</p>
<p>withdrawn, withdrawn so completely that one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2407">doubts</a> if it has ever</p>
<p>been…</p>

<p>I would mark with a curious interest the stray country member of the</p>
<p>club up in town for a night or so. My <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2408">mind</a> would be busy with</p>
<p>speculations about him, about his home, his family, his reading, his</p>
<p>horizons, his innumerable fellows who didn't belong and never came</p>
<p>up. I would fill in the outline of him with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2409">memories</a> of my uncle</p>
<p>and his Staffordshire neighbours. He was perhaps Alderman This or</p>
<p>Councillor That down there, a great man in his ward, J. P. within</p>
<p>seven miles of the boundary of the borough, and a God in his home.</p>
<p>Here he was nobody, and very shy, and either a little too <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2410">arrogant</a></p>
<p>or a little too meek towards our very democratic mannered but still</p>
<p>livened waiters. Was he perhaps the backbone of England? He over-</p>
<p>ate <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2411">himself</a> lest he should appear mean, went through our Special</p>
<p>Dinner <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2412">conscientiously</a>, drank, unless he was teetotal, of unfamiliar</p>
<p>wines, and did his best, in spite of the rules, to tip. Afterwards,</p>
<p>in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2413">state</a> of flushed repletion, he would have old brandy, black</p>
<p>coffee, and a banded cigar, or in the name of temperance omit the</p>
<p>brandy and have rather more coffee, in the smoking-room. I would</p>
<p>sit and watch that stiff dignity of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2414">self-indulgence</a>, and wonder,</p>
<p>wonder…</p>
<p>An infernal clairvoyance would come to me. I would have visions of</p>
<p>him in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2415">relation</a> to his wife, checking always, sometimes bullying,</p>
<p>sometimes <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2416">being</a> ostentatiously "kind"; I would <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2417">see</a> him glance</p>
<p>furtively at his domestic servants upon his staircase, or stiffen</p>
<p>his upper lip against the reluctant, protesting business employee.</p>
<p>We imaginative people are base enough, heaven <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2418">knows</a>, but it is only</p>
<p>in rare moods of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2419">bitter</a> penetration that we pierce down to the baser</p>
<p>lusts, the viler shames, the everlasting lying and muddle-headed</p>
<p>self-justification of the dull.</p>
<p>I would turn my eyes down the crowded room and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2420">see</a> others of him and</p>
<p>others. What did he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2421">think</a> he was up to? Did he for a moment</p>
<p>realise that his presence under that ceramic glory of a ceiling with</p>
<p>me meant, if it had any rational meaning at all, that we were</p>
<p>jointly doing something with the nation and the empire and</p>
<p>mankind?… How on earth could any one get hold of him, make</p>
<p>any <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2422">noble</a> use of him? He didn't read beyond his newspaper. He</p>
<p>never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2423">thought</a>, but only followed imaginings in his heart. He never</p>
<p>discussed. At the first hint of discussion his temper gave way.</p>
<p>He was, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2424">knew</a>, a deep, thinly-covered tank of resentments and</p>
<p>quite irrational moral rages. Yet withal I would have to resist</p>
<p>an impulse to go over to him and nudge him and say to him, "Look</p>
<p>here! What indeed do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2421">think</a> we are doing with the nation and</p>
<p>the empire and mankind? You know-MANKIND!"</p>
<p>I wonder what reply I should have got.</p>
<p>So far as any average could be struck and so far as any backbone</p>
<p>could be located, it seemed to me that this silent, shy, replete,</p>
<p>sub-angry, middle-class sentimentalist was in his endless species</p>
<p>and varieties and dialects the backbone of our party. So far as I</p>
<p>could be considered as representing anything in the House, I</p>
<p>pretended to sit for the elements of HIM…</p>

<p>For a time I turned towards the Socialists. They at least had an</p>
<p>air of coherent intentions. At that time Socialism had come into</p>
<p>politics again after a period of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2425">depression</a> and obscurity, with a</p>
<p>tremendous ECLAT. There was visibly a following of Socialist</p>
<p>members to Chris Robinson; mysteriously uncommunicative gentlemen in</p>
<p>soft <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2426">felt</a> hats and short coats and square-toed boots who replied to</p>
<p>casual advances a little surprisingly in rich North Country</p>
<p>dialects. Members became aware of a "seagreen incorruptible," as</p>
<p>Colonel Marlow put it to me, speaking on the Address, a slender</p>
<p>twisted figure supporting itself on a stick and speaking with a fire</p>
<p>that was altogether revolutionary. This was Philip Snowden, the</p>
<p>member for Blackburn. They had come in nearly forty strong</p>
<p>altogether, and with an air of presently meaning to come in much</p>
<p>stronger. They were only one aspect of what seemed at that time a</p>
<p>big national movement. Socialist societies, we gathered, were</p>
<p>springing up all over the country, and every one was inquiring about</p>
<p>Socialism and discussing Socialism. It had taken the Universities</p>
<p>with particular force, and any youngster with the slightest</p>
<p>intellectual pretension was either actively for or brilliantly</p>
<p>against. For a time our Young Liberal group was ostentatiously</p>
<p>sympathetic…</p>
<p>When I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2427">think</a> of the Socialists there comes a vivid <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2428">memory</a> of certain</p>
<p>evening gatherings at our house…</p>
<p>These gatherings had been organised by Margaret as the outcome of a</p>
<p>discussion at the Baileys'. Altiora had been very emphatic and</p>
<p>uncharitable upon the futility of the Socialist movement. It seemed</p>
<p>that even the leaders fought shy of dinner-parties.</p>
<p>"They never meet each other," said Altiora, "much less people on the</p>
<p>other side. How can they begin to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2429">understand</a> politics until they do</p>
<p>that?"</p>
<p>"Most of them have totally unpresentable wives," said Altiora,</p>
<p>"totally!" and quoted instances, "and they WILL bring them. Or they</p>
<p>won't come! Some of the poor creatures have scarcely learnt their</p>
<p>table manners. They just make holes in the talk…"</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2430">thought</a> there was a great deal of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2431">truth</a> beneath Altiora's</p>
<p>outburst. The presentation of the Socialist case seemed very</p>
<p>greatly crippled by the want of a common intimacy in its leaders;</p>
<p>the want of intimacy didn't at first appear to be more than an</p>
<p>accident, and our talk led to Margaret's attempt to get acquaintance</p>
<p>and easy intercourse afoot among them and between them and the Young</p>
<p>Liberals of our group. She gave a series of weekly dinners,</p>
<p>planned, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2432">think</a>, a little too accurately upon Altiora's model, and</p>
<p>after each we had as catholic a reception as we could contrive.</p>
<p>Our receptions were indeed, I should <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2433">think</a>, about as catholic as</p>
<p>receptions could be. Margaret found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2434">herself</a> with a weekly houseful</p>
<p>of insoluble problems in intercourse. One did one's best, but one</p>
<p>got a nightmare <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2435">feeling</a> as the evening wore on.</p>
<p>It was one of the few unanimities of these parties that every one</p>
<p>should be a little odd in appearance, funny about the hair or the</p>
<p>tie or the shoes or more generally, and that bursts of violent</p>
<p>aggression should alternate with an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2436">attitude</a> entirely defensive. A</p>
<p>number of our guests had an air of waiting for a clue that never</p>
<p>came, and stood and sat about silently, mildly amused but not a bit</p>
<p>surprised that we did not discover their distinctive Open-Sesames.</p>
<p>There was a sprinkling of manifest seers and prophetesses in</p>
<p>shapeless garments, far too many, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2437">thought</a>, for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2438">really</a> easy social</p>
<p>intercourse, and any conversation at any moment was liable to become</p>
<p>oracular. One was in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2439">state</a> of tension from first to last; the</p>
<p>most innocent remark seemed capable of exploding resentment, and</p>
<p>replies came out at the most unexpected angles. We Young Liberals</p>
<p>went about puzzled but polite to the gathering we had evoked. The</p>
<p>Young Liberals' tradition is on the whole wonderfully discreet,</p>
<p>superfluous steam is let out far away from home in the Balkans or</p>
<p>Africa, and the neat, stiff figures of the Cramptons, Bunting</p>
<p>Harblow, and Lewis, either in extremely well-cut morning coats</p>
<p>indicative of the House, or in what is sometimes written of as</p>
<p>"faultless evening dress," stood about on those evenings, they and</p>
<p>their very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2440">quietly</a> and simply and expensively dressed little wives,</p>
<p>like a datum line amidst lakes and mountains.</p>
<p>I didn't at first <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2441">see</a> the connection between systematic social</p>
<p>reorganisation and arbitrary novelties in dietary and costume, just</p>
<p>as I didn't realise why the most comprehensive constructive projects</p>
<p>should appear to be supported solely by odd and exceptional</p>
<p>personalities. On one of these evenings a little group of rather</p>
<p>jolly-looking pretty young people seated <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2442">themselves</a> for no</p>
<p>particular reason in a large circle on the floor of my study, and</p>
<p>engaged, so far as I could judge, in the game of Hunt the Meaning,</p>
<p>the intellectual equivalent of Hunt the Slipper. It must have been</p>
<p>that same evening I came upon an unbleached young gentleman before</p>
<p>the oval mirror on the landing engaged in removing the remains of an</p>
<p>anchovy sandwich from his protruded tongue-visible ends of cress</p>
<p>having misled him into the belief that he was dealing with</p>
<p>doctrinally permissible food. It was not unusual to be given hand-</p>
<p>bills and printed matter by our guests, but there I had the</p>
<p>advantage over Lewis, who was too tactful to refuse the stuff, too</p>
<p>neatly dressed to pocket it, and had no writing-desk available upon</p>
<p>which he could relieve <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2443">himself</a> in a manner flattering to the giver.</p>
<p>So that his hands got fuller and fuller. A relentless, compact</p>
<p>little woman in what Margaret declared to be an extremely expensive</p>
<p>black dress has also printed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2444">herself</a> on my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2445">memory</a>; she had set her</p>
<p>heart upon my contributing to a weekly periodical in the lentil</p>
<p>interest with which she was associated, and I spent much time and</p>
<p>care in evading her.</p>
<p>Mingling with the more hygienic types were a number of Anti-Puritan</p>
<p>Socialists, bulging with bias against temperance, and breaking out</p>
<p>against austere methods of living all over their faces. Their</p>
<p>manner was packed with heartiness. They were apt to choke the</p>
<p>approaches to the little buffet Margaret had set up downstairs, and</p>
<p>there engage in discussions of Determinism-it always seemed to be</p>
<p>Determinism-which became heartier and noisier, but never</p>
<p>acrimonious even in the small hours. It seemed impossible to settle</p>
<p>about this Determinism of theirs-ever. And there were worldly</p>
<p>Socialists also. I particularly recall a large, active, buoyant,</p>
<p>lady-killing individual with an eyeglass borne upon a broad black</p>
<p>ribbon, who swam about us one evening. He might have been a</p>
<p>slightly frayed actor, in his large frock-coat, his white waistcoat,</p>
<p>and the sort of black and white check trousers that twinkle. He had</p>
<p>a high-pitched voice with aristocratic intonations, and he seemed to</p>
<p>be in a perpetual <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2446">state</a> of interrogation. "What are we all he-a</p>
<p>for?" he would ask only too audibly. "What are we doing he-a?</p>
<p>What's the connection?"</p>
<p>What WAS the connection?</p>
<p>We made a special effort with our last assembly in June, 1907. We</p>
<p>tried to get something like a representative collection of the</p>
<p>parliamentary leaders of Socialism, the various exponents of</p>
<p>Socialist <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2447">thought</a> and a number of Young Liberal thinkers into one</p>
<p>room. Dorvil came, and Horatio Bulch; Featherstonehaugh appeared</p>
<p>for ten minutes and talked charmingly to Margaret and then vanished</p>
<p>again; there was Wilkins the novelist and Toomer and Dr. Tumpany.</p>
<p>Chris Robinson stood about for a time in a new <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2448">comforter</a>, and</p>
<p>Magdeberg and Will Pipes and five or six Labour members. And on our</p>
<p>side we had our particular little group, Bunting Harblow, Crampton,</p>
<p>Lewis, all looking as broad-minded and open to conviction as they</p>
<p>possibly could, and even occasionally talking out from their bushes</p>
<p>almost boldly. But the gathering as a whole refused either to</p>
<p>mingle or dispute, and as an experiment in intercourse the evening</p>
<p>was a failure. Unexpected dissociations appeared between Socialists</p>
<p>one had supposed friendly. I could not have imagined it was</p>
<p>possible for half so many people to turn their backs on everybody</p>
<p>else in such small rooms as ours. But the unsaid things those backs</p>
<p>expressed broke out, I remarked, with refreshed virulence in the</p>
<p>various organs of the various sections of the party next week.</p>
<p>I talked, I rememher, with Dr. Tumpany, a large young man in a still</p>
<p>larger professional frock-coat, and with a great shock of very fair</p>
<p>hair, who was candidate for some North Country constituency. We</p>
<p>discussed the political outlook, and, like so many Socialists at</p>
<p>that time, he was full of vague threatenings against the Liberal</p>
<p>party. I was struck by a thing in him that I had already observed</p>
<p>less vividly in many others of these Socialist leaders, and which</p>
<p>gave me at last a clue to the whole business. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2449">behaved</a> exactly</p>
<p>like a man in possession of valuable patent rights, who wants to be</p>
<p>dealt with. He had an air of having a corner in ideas. Then it</p>
<p>flashed into my head that the whole Socialist movement was an</p>
<p>attempted corner in ideas…</p>

</title>
<p>Late that night I found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2450">myself</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2451">alone</a> with Margaret amid the debris</p>
<p>of the gathering.</p>
<p>I sat before the fire, hands in pockets, and Margaret, looking white</p>
<p>and weary, came and leant upon the mantel.</p>
<p>"Oh, Lord!" said Margaret.</p>
<p>I agreed. Then I resumed my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2452">meditation</a>.</p>
<p>"Ideas," I said, "count for more than I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2453">thought</a> in the world."</p>
<p>Margaret regarded me with that neutral expression behind which she</p>
<p>was accustomed to wait for clues.</p>
<p>"When you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2454">think</a> of the height and depth and importance and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2455">wisdom</a> of</p>
<p>the Socialist ideas, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2456">see</a> the men who are running them," I</p>
<p>explained… "A big system of ideas like Socialism <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2457">grows</a> up out</p>
<p>of the obvious common sense of our present <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2458">conditions</a>. It's as</p>
<p>impersonal as science. All these men-They've given nothing to it.</p>
<p>They're just people who have pegged out claims upon a big</p>
<p>intellectual No-Man's-Land-and don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2459">feel</a> quite sure of the law.</p>
<p>There's a sort of quarrelsome uneasiness… If we professed</p>
<p>Socialism do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2454">think</a> they'd welcome us? Not a man of them!</p>
<p>They'd <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2459">feel</a> it was burglary…"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Margaret, looking into the fire. "That is just what I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2460">felt</a> about them all the evening… Particularly Dr. Tumpany."</p>
<p>"We mustn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2461">confuse</a> Socialism with the Socialists, I said; "that's</p>
<p>the moral of it. I suppose if God were to find He had made a</p>
<p>mistake in dates or something, and went back and annihilated</p>
<p>everybody from Owen onwards who was in any way <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2462">known</a> as a Socialist</p>
<p>leader or teacher, Socialism would be exactly where it is and what</p>
<p>it is to-day-a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2463">growing</a> realisation of constructive needs in every</p>
<p>man's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2464">mind</a>, and a little corner in party politics. So, I suppose,</p>
<p>it will always be… But they WERE a damned lot, Margaret!"</p>
<p>I looked up at the little noise she made. "TWICE!" she said,</p>
<p>smiling indulgently, "to-day!" (Even the smile was Altiora's.)</p>
<p>I returned to my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2465">thoughts</a>. They WERE a damned human lot. It was an</p>
<p>excellent word in that connection…</p>
<p>But the ideas marched on, the ideas marched on, just as though men's</p>
<p>brains were no more than stepping-stones, just as though some great</p>
<p>brain in which we are all little cells and corpuscles was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2466">thinking</a></p>
<p>them!…</p>
<p>"I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2467">think</a> there is a man among them who makes me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2468">feel</a> he is</p>
<p>trustworthy," said Margaret; "unless it is Featherstonehaugh."</p>
<p>I sat taking in this proposition.</p>
<p>"They'll never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2469">help</a> us, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2470">feel</a>," said Margaret.</p>
<p>"Us?"</p>
<p>"The Liberals."</p>
<p>"Oh, damn the Liberals!" I said. "They'll never even <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2471">help</a></p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2472">themselves</a>."</p>
<p>"I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2473">think</a> I could possibly get on with any of those people,"</p>
<p>said Margaret, after a pause.</p>
<p>She remained for a time looking down at me and, I could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2474">feel</a>,</p>
<p>perplexed by me, but I wanted to go on with my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2475">thinking</a>, and so I</p>
<p>did not look up, and presently she stooped to my forehead and kissed</p>
<p>me and went rustling softly to her room.</p>
<p>I remained in my study for a long time with my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2476">thoughts</a></p>
<p>crystallising out…</p>
<p>It was then, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2477">think</a>, that I first apprehended clearly how that</p>
<p>opposition to which I have already alluded of the immediate life and</p>
<p>the mental hinterland of a man, can be applied to public and social</p>
<p>affairs. The ideas go on-and no person or party succeeds in</p>
<p>embodying them. The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2478">reality</a> of human progress never comes to the</p>
<p>surface, it is a power in the deeps, an undertow. It goes on in</p>
<p>silence while men <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2477">think</a>, in studies where they write self-</p>
<p>forgetfully, in laboratories under the urgency of an impersonal</p>
<p>curiosity, in the rare illumination of honest talk, in moments of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2479">emotional</a> insight, in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2480">thoughtful</a> reading, but not in everyday</p>
<p>affairs. Everyday affairs and whatever is made an everyday affair,</p>
<p>are transactions of the ostensible <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2481">self</a>, the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2482">being</a> of habits,</p>
<p>interests, usage. Temper, vanity, hasty reaction to imitation,</p>
<p>personal <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2483">feeling</a>, are their substance. No man can abolish his</p>
<p>immediate <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2481">self</a> and specialise in the depths; if he attempt that, he</p>
<p>simply turns <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2484">himself</a> into something a little less than the common</p>
<p>man. He may have an immense hinterland, but that does not absolve</p>
<p>him from a frontage. That is the essential error of the specialist</p>
<p>philosopher, the specialist teacher, the specialist publicist. They</p>
<p>repudiate frontage; claim to be pure hinterland. That is what</p>
<p>bothered me about Codger, about those various schoolmasters who had</p>
<p>prepared me for life, about the Baileys and their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2485">dream</a> of an</p>
<p>official ruling class. A human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2482">being</a> who is a philosopher in the</p>
<p>first place, a teacher in the first place, or a statesman in the</p>
<p>first place, is thereby and inevitably, though he bring God-like</p>
<p>gifts to the pretence-a quack. These are attempts to live deep-</p>
<p>side shallow, inside out. They produce merely a new pettiness. To</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2486">understand</a> Socialism, again, is to gain a new breadth of outlook; to</p>
<p>join a Socialist organisation is to join a narrow cult which is not</p>
<p>even tolerably serviceable in presenting or spreading the ideas for</p>
<p>which it stands…</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2487">perceived</a> I had got something quite fundamental here. It had</p>
<p>taken me some years to realise the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2488">true</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2489">relation</a> of the great</p>
<p>constructive ideas that swayed me not only to political parties, but</p>
<p>to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2490">myself</a>. I had been <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2491">disposed</a> to identify the formulae of some one</p>
<p>party with social construction, and to regard the other as</p>
<p>necessarily anti-constructive, just as I had been inclined to follow</p>
<p>the Baileys in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2492">self-righteousness</a> of supposing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2490">myself</a> to be</p>
<p>wholly constructive. But I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2493">saw</a> now that every man of intellectual</p>
<p>freedom and vigour is necessarily constructive-minded nowadays, and</p>
<p>that no man is disinterestedly so. Each one of us repeats in</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2494">himself</a> the conflict of the race between the splendour of its</p>
<p>possibilities and its immediate associations. We may be shaping</p>
<p>immortal things, but we must sleep and answer the dinner gong, and</p>
<p>have our salt of flattery and self-approval. In politics a man</p>
<p>counts not for what he is in moments of imaginative expansion, but</p>
<p>for his common workaday, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2495">selfish</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2496">self</a>; and political parties are</p>
<p>held together not by a community of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2497">ultimate</a> aims, but by the</p>
<p>stabler bond of an accustomed life. Everybody almost is for</p>
<p>progress in general, and nearly everybody is opposed to any change,</p>
<p>except in so far as gross increments are change, in his particular</p>
<p>method of living and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2498">behaviour</a>. Every party stands essentially for</p>
<p>the interests and mental usages of some definite class or group of</p>
<p>classes in the exciting community, and every party has its</p>
<p>scientific-minded and constructive leading section, with well-</p>
<p>defined hinterlands formulating its social functions in a public-</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2499">spirited</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2500">form</a>, and its superficial-minded following confessing its</p>
<p>meannesses and vanities and prejudices. No class will abolish</p>
<p>itself, materially alter its way of life, or drastically reconstruct</p>
<p>itself, albeit no class is indisposed to co-operate in the unlimited</p>
<p>socialisation of any other class. In that capacity for aggression</p>
<p>upon other classes lies the essential driving force of modern</p>
<p>affairs. The instincts, the persons, the parties, and vanities sway</p>
<p>and struggle. The ideas and understandings march on and achieve</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2501">themselves</a> for all-in spite of every one…</p>
<p>The methods and traditions of British politics maintain the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2502">form</a> of</p>
<p>two great parties, with rider groups seeking to gain specific ends</p>
<p>in the event of a small Government majority. These two main parties</p>
<p>are more or less heterogeneous in composition. Each, however, has</p>
<p>certain necessary characteristics. The Conservative Party has</p>
<p>always stood quite definitely for the established propertied</p>
<p>interests. The land-owner, the big lawyer, the Established Church,</p>
<p>and latterly the huge private monopoly of the liquor trade which has</p>
<p>been created by temperance legislation, are the essential</p>
<p>Conservatives. Interwoven now with the native wealthy are the</p>
<p>families of the great international usurers, and a vast</p>
<p>miscellaneous mass of financial enterprise. Outside the range of</p>
<p>resistance implied by these interests, the Conservative Party has</p>
<p>always shown itself just as constructive and collectivist as any</p>
<p>other party. The great landowners have been as well-disposed</p>
<p>towards the endowment of higher education, and as willing to co-</p>
<p>operate with the Church in protective and mildly educational</p>
<p>legislation for children and the working class, as any political</p>
<p>section. The financiers, too, are adventurous-spirited and eager</p>
<p>for mechanical progress and technical efficiency. They are prepared</p>
<p>to spend public money upon research, upon ports and harbours and</p>
<p>public communications, upon sanitation and hygienic organisation. A</p>
<p>certain rude <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2503">benevolence</a> of public intention is equally</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2504">characteristic</a> of the liquor trade. Provided his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2505">comfort</a> leads to</p>
<p>no excesses of temperance, the liquor trade is quite eager to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2506">see</a></p>
<p>the common man prosperous, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2507">happy</a>, and with money to spend in a bar.</p>
<p>All sections of the party are aggressively patriotic and favourably</p>
<p>inclined to the idea of an upstanding, well-fed, and well-exercised</p>
<p>population in uniform. Of course there are reactionary landowners</p>
<p>and old-fashioned country clergy, full of localised <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2508">self-importance</a>,</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2509">jealous</a> even of the cottager who can read, but they have neither the</p>
<p>power nor the ability to retard the constructive forces in the party</p>
<p>as a whole. On the other hand, when matters point to any definitely</p>
<p>confiscatory proposal, to the public ownership and collective</p>
<p>control of land, for example, or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2510">state</a> mining and manufactures, or</p>
<p>the nationalisation of the so-called public-house or extended</p>
<p>municipal enterprise, or even to an increase of the taxation of</p>
<p>property, then the Conservative Party presents a nearly adamantine</p>
<p>bar. It does not stand for, it IS, the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2511">existing</a> arrangement in</p>
<p>these affairs.</p>
<p>Even more definitely a class party is the Labour Party, whose</p>
<p>immediate interest is to raise wages, shorten hours of labor,</p>
<p>increase employment, and make better terms for the working-man</p>
<p>tenant and working-man purchaser. Its leaders are no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2512">doubt</a></p>
<p>constructive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2513">minded</a>, but the mass of the following is naturally</p>
<p>suspicious of education and discipline, hostile to the higher</p>
<p>education, and-except for an obvious antagonism to employers and</p>
<p>property owners-almost destitute of ideas. What else can it be?</p>
<p>It stands for the expropriated multitude, whose whole situation and</p>
<p>difficulty arise from its individual lack of initiative and</p>
<p>organising power. It favours the nationalisation of land and</p>
<p>capital with no sense of the difficulties involved in the process;</p>
<p>but, on the other hand, the equally reasonable socialisation of</p>
<p>individuals which is implied by military service is steadily and</p>
<p>quite naturally and quite illogically opposed by it. It is only in</p>
<p>recent years that Labour has emerged as a separate party from the</p>
<p>huge hospitable caravanserai of Liberalism, and there is still a</p>
<p>very marked tendency to step back again into that multitudinous</p>
<p>assemblage.</p>
<p>For multitudinousness has always been the Liberal <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2514">characteristic</a>.</p>
<p>Liberalism never has been nor ever can be anything but a diversified</p>
<p>crowd. Liberalism has to voice everything that is left out by these</p>
<p>other parties. It is the party against the predominating interests.</p>
<p>It is at once the party of the failing and of the untried; it is the</p>
<p>party of decadence and hope. From its nature it must be a vague and</p>
<p>planless association in comparison with its antagonist, neither so</p>
<p>constructive on the one hand, nor on the other so competent to</p>
<p>hinder the inevitable constructions of the civilised <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2515">state</a>.</p>
<p>Essentially it is the party of criticism, the "Anti" party. It is a</p>
<p>system of hostilities and objections that somehow achieves at times</p>
<p>an elusive common <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2516">soul</a>. It is a gathering together of all the</p>
<p>smaller interests which find <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2517">themselves</a> at a disadvantage against</p>
<p>the big established classes, the leasehold tenant as against the</p>
<p>landowner, the retail tradesman as against the merchant and the</p>
<p>moneylender, the Nonconformist as against the Churchman, the small</p>
<p>employer as against the demoralising hospitable publican, the man</p>
<p>without introductions and broad connections against the man who has</p>
<p>these things. It is the party of the many small men against the</p>
<p>fewer prevailing men. It has no more essential reason for loving</p>
<p>the Collectivist <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2515">state</a> than the Conservatives; the small dealer is</p>
<p>doomed to absorption in that just as much as the large owner; but it</p>
<p>resorts to the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2515">state</a> against its antagonists as in the middle ages</p>
<p>common men pitted <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2517">themselves</a> against the barons by siding with the</p>
<p>king. The Liberal Party is the party against "class privilege"</p>
<p>because it represents no class advantages, but it is also the party</p>
<p>that is on the whole most set against Collective control because it</p>
<p>represents no established responsilibity. It is constructive only</p>
<p>so far as its antagonism to the great owner is more powerful than</p>
<p>its <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2518">jealousy</a> of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2515">state</a>. It organises only because organisation</p>
<p>is forced upon it by the organisation of its adversaries. It lapses</p>
<p>in and out of alliance with Labour as it sways between hostility to</p>
<p>wealth and hostility to public expenditure…</p>
<p>Every modern European <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2519">state</a> will have in some <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2520">form</a> or other these</p>
<p>three parties: the resistent, militant, authoritative, dull, and</p>
<p>unsympathetic party of establishment and success, the rich party;</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2521">confused</a>, sentimental, spasmodic, numerous party of the small,</p>
<p>struggling, various, undisciplined men, the poor man's party; and a</p>
<p>third party sometimes <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2522">detaching</a> itself from the second and sometimes</p>
<p>reuniting with it, the party of the altogether expropriated masses,</p>
<p>the proletarians, Labour. Change Conservative and Liberal to</p>
<p>Republican and Democrat, for example, and you have the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2523">conditions</a> in</p>
<p>the United States. The Crown or a dethroned dynasty, the</p>
<p>Established Church or a dispossessed church, nationalist secessions,</p>
<p>the personalities of party leaders, may break up, complicate, and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2524">confuse</a> the self-expression of these three necessary divisions in</p>
<p>the modern social drama, the analyst will make them out none the</p>
<p>less for that…</p>
<p>And then I came back as if I came back to a refrain;-the ideas go</p>
<p>on-as though we are all no more than little cells and corpuscles in</p>
<p>some great brain beyond our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2525">understanding</a>…</p>
<p>So it was I sat and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2526">thought</a> my problem out… I still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2527">remember</a></p>
<p>my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2528">satisfaction</a> at <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2529">seeing</a> things plainly at last. It was like</p>
<p>clouds dispersing to show the sky. Constructive ideas, of course,</p>
<p>couldn't hold a party together <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2530">alone</a>, "interests and habits, not</p>
<p>ideas," I had that now, and so the great constructive scheme of</p>
<p>Socialism, invading and inspiring all parties, was necessarily</p>
<p>claimed only by this collection of odds and ends, this residuum of</p>
<p>disconnected and exceptional people. This was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2531">true</a> not only of the</p>
<p>Socialist idea, but of the scientific idea, the idea of veracity-of</p>
<p>human confidence in humanity-of all that mattered in human life</p>
<p>outside the life of individuals… The only <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2532">real</a> party that</p>
<p>would ever profess Socialism was the Labour Party, and that in the</p>
<p>entirely one-sided <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2533">form</a> of an irresponsible and non-constructive</p>
<p>attack on property. Socialism in that mutilated <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2533">form</a>, the teeth and</p>
<p>claws without the eyes and brain, I wanted as little as I wanted</p>
<p>anything in the world.</p>
<p>Perfectly clear it was, perfectly clear, and why hadn't I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2534">seen</a> it</p>
<p>before?… I looked at my watch, and it was half-past two.</p>
<p>I yawned, stretched, got up and went to bed.</p>

<p>My ideas about statecraft have passed through three main phases to</p>
<p>the final convictions that remain. There was the first immediacy of</p>
<p>my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2535">dream</a> of ports and harbours and cities, railways, roads, and</p>
<p>administered territories-the vision I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2536">seen</a> in the haze from</p>
<p>that little church above Locarno. Slowly that had passed into a</p>
<p>more elaborate legislative constructiveness, which had led to my</p>
<p>uneasy association with the Baileys and the professedly constructive</p>
<p>Young Liberals. To get that ordered life I had realised the need of</p>
<p>organisation, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2537">knowledge</a>, expertness, a wide movement of co-ordinated</p>
<p>methods. On the individual side I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2538">thought</a> that a life of urgent</p>
<p>industry, temperance, and close attention was indicated by my</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2539">perception</a> of these ends. I married Margaret and set to work. But</p>
<p>something in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2540">mind</a> refused from the outset to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2541">accept</a> these</p>
<p>determinations as final. There was always a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2542">doubt</a> lurking below,</p>
<p>always a faint resentment, a protesting criticism, a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2543">feeling</a> of</p>
<p>vitally important omissions.</p>
<p>I arrived at last at the clear realisation that my political</p>
<p>associates, and I in my association with them, were oddly narrow,</p>
<p>priggish, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2544">unreal</a>, that the Socialists with whom we were</p>
<p>attempting co-operation were preposterously irrelevant to their own</p>
<p>theories, that my political life didn't in some way comprehend more</p>
<p>than itself, that rather perplexingly I was missing the thing I was</p>
<p>seeking. Britten's footnotes to Altiora's self-assertions, her fits</p>
<p>of energetic planning, her quarrels and rallies and vanities, his</p>
<p>illuminating attacks on Cramptonism and the heavy-spirited</p>
<p>triviality of such Liberalism as the Children's Charter, served to</p>
<p>point my way to my present conclusions. I had been trying to deal</p>
<p>all along with human progress as something immediate in life,</p>
<p>something to be immediately attacked by political parties and groups</p>
<p>pointing primarily to that end. I now began to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2545">see</a> that just as in</p>
<p>my own <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2546">being</a> there was the rather shallow, rather vulgar, self-</p>
<p>seeking careerist, who wore an admirable silk hat and bustled self-</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2547">consciously</a> through the lobby, and a much greater and indefinitely</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2548">growing</a> unpublished personality behind him-my hinterland, I have</p>
<p>called it-so in human affairs generally the permanent <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2549">reality</a> is</p>
<p>also a hinterland, which is never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2550">really</a> immediate, which draws</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2551">continually</a> upon human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2552">experience</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2553">influences</a> human action more</p>
<p>and more, but which is itself never the actual player upon the</p>
<p>stage. It is the unseen dramatist who never takes a call. Now it</p>
<p>was just through the fact that our group about the Baileys didn't</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2554">understand</a> this, that with a sort of frantic energy they were trying</p>
<p>to develop that sham expert officialdom of theirs to plan, regulate,</p>
<p>and direct the affairs of humanity, that the perplexing note of</p>
<p>silliness and shallowness that I had always <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2555">felt</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2555">felt</a> now most</p>
<p>acutely under Britten's gibes, came in. They were neglecting human</p>
<p>life altogether in social organisation.</p>
<p>In the development of intellectual modesty lies the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2556">growth</a> of</p>
<p>statesmanship. It has been the chronic mistake of statecraft and</p>
<p>all organising <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2557">spirits</a> to attempt immediately to scheme and arrange</p>
<p>and achieve. Priests, schools of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2558">thought</a>, political schemers,</p>
<p>leaders of men, have always slipped into the error of assuming that</p>
<p>they can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2559">think</a> out the whole-or at any rate completely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2559">think</a> out</p>
<p>definite parts-of the purpose and future of man, clearly and</p>
<p>finally; they have set <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2560">themselves</a> to legislate and construct on that</p>
<p>assumption, and, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2561">experiencing</a> the perplexing obduracy and evasions</p>
<p>of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2562">reality</a>, they have taken to dogma, persecution, training,</p>
<p>pruning, secretive education; and all the stupidities of self-</p>
<p>sufficient energy. In the passion of their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2563">good</a> intentions they</p>
<p>have not hesitated to conceal fact, suppress <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2558">thought</a>, crush</p>
<p>disturbing initiatives and apparently detrimental <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2564">desires</a>. And so</p>
<p>it is blunderingly and wastefully, destroying with the making, that</p>
<p>any extension of social organisation is at present achieved.</p>
<p>Directly, however, this idea of an emancipation from immediacy is</p>
<p>grasped, directly the dominating importance of this critical, less</p>
<p>personal, mental hinterland in the individual and of the collective</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2565">mind</a> in the race is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2566">understood</a>, the whole problem of the statesman</p>
<p>and his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2567">attitude</a> towards politics gain a new significance, and</p>
<p>becomes accessible to a new series of solutions. He wants no longer</p>
<p>to "fix up," as people say, human affairs, but to devote his forces</p>
<p>to the development of that needed intellectual life without which</p>
<p>all his shallow attempts at fixing up are futile. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2568">ceases</a> to</p>
<p>build on the sands, and sets <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2569">himself</a> to gather foundations.</p>
<p>You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2570">see</a>, I began in my teens by wanting to plan and build cities and</p>
<p>harbours for mankind; I ended in the middle thirties by <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2571">desiring</a></p>
<p>only to serve and increase a general process of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2572">thought</a>, a process</p>
<p>fearless, critical, real-spirited, that would in its own time give</p>
<p>cities, harbours, air, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2573">happiness</a>, everything at a scale and quality</p>
<p>and in a light altogether beyond the match-striking imaginations of</p>
<p>a contemporary <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2574">mind</a>. I wanted freedom of speech and suggestion,</p>
<p>vigour of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2572">thought</a>, and the cultivation of that impulse of veracity</p>
<p>that lurks more or less discouraged in every man. With that I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2575">felt</a></p>
<p>there must go an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2576">emotion</a>. I hit upon a phrase that became at last</p>
<p>something of a refrain in my speech and writings, to convey the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2577">spirit</a> that I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2575">felt</a> was at the very heart of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2578">real</a> human progress-</p>
<p>love and fine <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2579">thinking</a>.</p>
<p>(I suppose that nowadays no newspaper in England gets through a week</p>
<p>without the repetition of that phrase.)</p>
<p>My convictions crystallised more and more definitely upon this. The</p>
<p>more of love and fine <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2580">thinking</a> the better for men, I said; the less,</p>
<p>the worse. And upon this fresh basis I set <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2581">myself</a> to examine what I</p>
<p>as a politician might do. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2582">perceived</a> I was at last finding an</p>
<p>adequate expression for all that was in me, for those forces that</p>
<p>had rebelled at the crude presentations of Bromstead, at the</p>
<p>secrecies and suppressions of my youth, at the dull <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2583">unrealities</a> of</p>
<p>City Merchants, at the conventions and timidities of the Pinky</p>
<p>Dinkys, at the philosophical recluse of Trinity and the phrases and</p>
<p>tradition-worship of my political associates. None of these things</p>
<p>were half alive, and I wanted life to be intensely alive and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2584">awake</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2585">thought</a> like an edge of steel and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2586">desire</a> like a flame. The</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2587">real</a> work before mankind now, I realised once and for all, is the</p>
<p>enlargement of human expression, the release and intensification of</p>
<p>human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2585">thought</a>, the vivider utilisation of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2588">experience</a> and the</p>
<p>invigoration of research-and whatever one does in human affairs has</p>
<p>or lacks value as it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2589">helps</a> or hinders that.</p>
<p>With that I had got my problem clear, and the solution, so far as I</p>
<p>was concerned, lay in finding out the point in the ostensible life</p>
<p>of politics at which I could most subserve these ends. I was still</p>
<p>against the muddles of Bromstead, but I had hunted them down now to</p>
<p>their essential <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2590">form</a>. The jerry-built slums, the roads that went</p>
<p>nowhere, the tarred fences, litigious notice-boards and barbed wire</p>
<p>fencing, the litter and the heaps of dump, were only the outward</p>
<p>appearances whose <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2591">ultimate</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2592">realities</a> were jerry-built conclusions,</p>
<p>hasty purposes, aimless habits of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2593">thought</a>, and imbecile bars and</p>
<p>prohibitions in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2593">thoughts</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2594">souls</a> of men. How are we through</p>
<p>politics to get at that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2595">confusion</a>?</p>
<p>We want to invigorate and reinvigorate education. We want to create</p>
<p>a sustained counter effort to the perpetual tendency of all</p>
<p>educational organisations towards classicalism, secondary issues,</p>
<p>and the evasion of life.</p>
<p>We want to stimulate the expression of life through art and</p>
<p>literature, and its exploration through research.</p>
<p>We want to make the best and finest <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2596">thought</a> accessible to every one,</p>
<p>and more particularly to create and sustain an enormous free</p>
<p>criticism, without which art, literature, and research alike</p>
<p>degenerate into tradition or imposture.</p>
<p>Then all the other problems which are now so insoluble, destitution,</p>
<p>disease, the difficulty of maintaining international peace, the</p>
<p>scarcely faced possibility of making life generally and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2597">continually</a></p>
<p>beautiful, become-EASY…</p>
<p>It was clear to me that the most vital activities in which I could</p>
<p>engage would be those which most directly affected the Church,</p>
<p>public habits of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2598">thought</a>, education, organised research, literature,</p>
<p>and the channels of general discussion. I had to ask <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2599">myself</a> how my</p>
<p>position as Liberal member for Kinghamstead squared with and</p>
<p>conduced to this essential work.</p>

<p>I have told of my gradual abandonment of the pretensions and habits</p>
<p>of party Liberalism. In a sense I was moving towards aristocracy.</p>
<p>Regarding the development of the social and individual mental</p>
<p>hinterland as the essential thing in human progress, I passed on</p>
<p>very naturally to the practical assumption that we wanted what I may</p>
<p>call "hinterlanders." Of course I do not mean by aristocracy the</p>
<p>changing unorganised medley of rich people and privileged people who</p>
<p>dominate the civilised world of to-day, but as opposed to this, a</p>
<p>possibility of co-ordinating the will of the finer individuals, by</p>
<p>habit and literature, into a broad common aim. We must have an</p>
<p>aristocracy-not of privilege, but of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2600">understanding</a> and purpose-or</p>
<p>mankind will fail. I find this dawning more and more clearly when I</p>
<p>look through my various writings of the years between 1903 and 1910.</p>
<p>I was already emerging to plain statements in 1908.</p>
<p>I reasoned after this fashion. The line of human improvement and</p>
<p>the expansion of human life lies in the direction of education and</p>
<p>finer initiatives. If humanity cannot develop an education far</p>
<p>beyond anything that is now provided, if it cannot collectively</p>
<p>invent devices and solve problems on a much richer, broader scale</p>
<p>than it does at the present time, it cannot hope to achieve any very</p>
<p>much finer order or any more general <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2601">happiness</a> than it now <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2602">enjoys</a>.</p>
<p>We must believe, therefore, that it CAN develop such a training and</p>
<p>education, or we must abandon secular constructive hope. And here</p>
<p>my peculiar difficulty as against crude democracy comes in. If</p>
<p>humanity at large is capable of that high education and those</p>
<p>creative freedoms our hope demands, much more must its better and</p>
<p>more vigorous types be so capable. And if those who have power and</p>
<p>leisure now, and freedom to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2603">respond</a> to imaginative appeals, cannot</p>
<p>be won to the idea of collective self-development, then the whole of</p>
<p>humanity cannot be won to that. From that one passes to what has</p>
<p>become my general conception in politics, the conception of the</p>
<p>constructive imagination working upon the vast complex of powerful</p>
<p>people, clever people, enterprising people, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2604">influential</a> people,</p>
<p>amidst whom power is diffused to-day, to produce that self-</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2605">conscious</a>, highly selective, open-minded, devoted aristocratic</p>
<p>culture, which seems to me to be the necessary next phase in the</p>
<p>development of human affairs. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2606">see</a> human progress, not as the</p>
<p>spontaneous product of crowds of raw <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2607">minds</a> swayed by elementary</p>
<p>needs, but as a natural but elaborate result of intricate human</p>
<p>interdependencies, of human energy and curiosity liberated and</p>
<p>acting at leisure, of human passions and motives, modified and</p>
<p>redirected by literature and art…</p>
<p>But now the reader will <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2608">understand</a> how it came about that,</p>
<p>disappointed by the essential littleness of Liberalism, and</p>
<p>disillusioned about the representative quality of the professed</p>
<p>Socialists, I turned my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2609">mind</a> more and more to a scrutiny of the big</p>
<p>people, the wealthy and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2610">influential</a> people, against whom Liberalism</p>
<p>pits its forces. I was asking <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2611">myself</a> definitely whether, after all,</p>
<p>it was not my particular job to work through them and not against</p>
<p>them. Was I not altogether out of my element as an Anti-? Weren't</p>
<p>there big bold qualities about these people that common men lack,</p>
<p>and the possibility of far more splendid <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2612">dreams</a>? Were they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2613">really</a></p>
<p>the obstacles, might they not be rather the vehicles of the possible</p>
<p>new braveries of life?</p>

<p>The faults of the Imperialist movement were obvious enough. The</p>
<p>conception of the Boer War had been clumsy and puerile, the costly</p>
<p>errors of that struggle appalling, and the subsequent campaign of</p>
<p>Mr. Chamberlain for Tariff Reform seemed calculated to combine the</p>
<p>financial adventurers of the Empire in one vast conspiracy against</p>
<p>the consumer. The cant of Imperialism was easy to learn and use; it</p>
<p>was speedily adopted by all sorts of base enterprises and turned to</p>
<p>all sorts of base ends. But a big child is permitted big mischief,</p>
<p>and my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2614">mind</a> was now <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2615">continually</a> returning to the persuasion that</p>
<p>after all in some development of the idea of Imperial patriotism</p>
<p>might be found that wide, rough, politically <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2616">acceptable</a> expression</p>
<p>of a constructive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2617">dream</a> capable of sustaining a great educational</p>
<p>and philosophical movement such as no formula of Liberalism</p>
<p>supplied. The fact that it readily took vulgar <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2618">forms</a> only witnessed</p>
<p>to its strong popular appeal. Mixed in with the noisiness and</p>
<p>humbug of the movement there appeared a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2619">real</a> regard for social</p>
<p>efficiency, a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2619">real</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2620">spirit</a> of animation and enterprise. There</p>
<p>suddenly appeared in my world-I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2621">saw</a> them first, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2622">think</a>, in 1908-a</p>
<p>new sort of little boy, a most agreeable development of the</p>
<p>slouching, cunning, cigarette-smoking, town-bred youngster, a small</p>
<p>boy in a khaki hat, and with bare knees and athletic bearing,</p>
<p>earnestly engaged in wholesome and invigorating games up to and</p>
<p>occasionally a little beyond his strength-the Boy Scout. I liked</p>
<p>the Boy Scout, and I find it difficult to express how much it</p>
<p>mattered to me, with my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2623">growing</a> bias in favour of deliberate</p>
<p>national training, that Liberalism hadn't been able to produce, and</p>
<p>had indeed never attempted to produce, anything of this kind.</p>

<p>In those days there <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2624">existed</a> a dining club called-there was some</p>
<p>lost allusion to the exorcism of party <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2625">feeling</a> in its title-the</p>
<p>Pentagram Circle. It included Bailey and Dayton and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2626">myself</a>, Sir</p>
<p>Herbert Thorns, Lord Charles Kindling, Minns the poet, Gerbault the</p>
<p>big railway man, Lord Gane, fresh from the settlement of Framboya,</p>
<p>and Rumbold, who later became Home Secretary and left us. We were</p>
<p>men of all parties and very various <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2627">experiences</a>, and our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2628">object</a> was</p>
<p>to discuss the welfare of the Empire in a disinterested <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2629">spirit</a>. We</p>
<p>dined monthly at the Mermaid in Westminster, and for a couple of</p>
<p>years we kept up an average attendance of ten out of fourteen. The</p>
<p>dinner-time was given up to desultory conversation, and it is odd</p>
<p>how warm and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2630">good</a> the social atmosphere of that little gathering</p>
<p>became as time went on; then over the dessert, so soon as the</p>
<p>waiters had swept away the crumbs and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2631">ceased</a> to fret us, one of us</p>
<p>would open with perhaps fifteen or twenty minutes' exposition of</p>
<p>some specially prepared question, and after him we would deliver</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2632">ourselves</a> in turn, each for three or four minutes. When every one</p>
<p>present had spoken once talk became general again, and it was rare</p>
<p>we emerged upon Hendon Street before midnight. Sometimes, as my</p>
<p>house was conveniently near, a knot of men would come home with me</p>
<p>and go on talking and smoking in my dining-room until two or three.</p>
<p>We had Fred Neal, that wild Irish journalist, among us towards the</p>
<p>end, and his stupendous flow of words materially prolonged our</p>
<p>closing discussions and made our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2633">continuance</a> impossible.</p>
<p>I learned very much and very many things at those dinners, but more</p>
<p>particularly did I become familiarised with the habits of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2634">mind</a> of</p>
<p>such men as Neal, Crupp, Gane, and the one or two other New</p>
<p>Imperialists who belonged to us. They were nearly all like Bailey</p>
<p>Oxford men, though mostly of a younger generation, and they were all</p>
<p>mysteriously and inexplicably advocates of Tariff Reform, as if it</p>
<p>were the principal instead of at best a secondary aspect of</p>
<p>constructive policy. They seemed obsessed by the idea that streams</p>
<p>of trade could be diverted violently so as to link the parts of the</p>
<p>Empire by common interests, and they were persuaded, I still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2635">think</a></p>
<p>mistakenly, that Tariff Reform would have an immense popular appeal.</p>
<p>They were also very keen on military organisation, and with a</p>
<p>curious little martinet twist in their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2634">minds</a> that boded ill for that</p>
<p>side of public liberty. So much against them. But they were</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2636">disposed</a> to spend money much more <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2637">generously</a> on education and</p>
<p>research of all sorts than our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2638">formless</a> host of Liberals seemed</p>
<p>likely to do; and they were altogether more accessible than the</p>
<p>Young Liberals to bold, constructive ideas affecting the</p>
<p>universities and upper classes. The Liberals are abjectly afraid of</p>
<p>the universities. I found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2639">myself</a> constantly falling into line with</p>
<p>these men in our discussions, and more and more hostile to Dayton's</p>
<p>sentimentalising evasions of definite schemes and Minns' trust in</p>
<p>such things as the "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2640">Spirit</a> of our People" and the "General Trend of</p>
<p>Progress." It wasn't that I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2641">thought</a> them very much righter than</p>
<p>their opponents; I believe all definite party "sides" at any time</p>
<p>are bound to be about equally right and equally lop-sided; but that</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2641">thought</a> I could get more out of them and what was more important</p>
<p>to me, more out of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2639">myself</a> if I co-operated with them. By 1908 I had</p>
<p>already arrived at a point where I could be definitely considering a</p>
<p>transfer of my political allegiance.</p>
<p>These abstract questions are inseparably interwoven with my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2642">memory</a></p>
<p>of a shining long white table, and our hock bottles and burgundy</p>
<p>bottles, and bottles of Perrier and St. Galmier and the disturbed</p>
<p>central trophy of dessert, and scattered glasses and nut-shells and</p>
<p>cigarette-ends and menu-cards used for memoranda. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2643">see</a> old Dayton</p>
<p>sitting back and cocking his eye to the ceiling in a way he had</p>
<p>while he threw warmth into the ancient platitudes of Liberalism, and</p>
<p>Minns leaning forward, and a little like a cockatoo with a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2644">taste</a> for</p>
<p>confidences, telling us in a hushed voice of his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2645">faith</a> in the</p>
<p>Destiny of Mankind. Thorns lounges, rolling his round face and</p>
<p>round eyes from speaker to speaker and sounding the visible depths</p>
<p>of misery whenever Neal begins. Gerbault and Gane were given to</p>
<p>conversation in undertones, and Bailey pursued mysterious purposes</p>
<p>in lisping whispers. It was Crupp attracted me most. He had, as</p>
<p>people say, his eye on me from the beginning. He used to speak at</p>
<p>me, and drifted into a custom of coming home with me very regularly</p>
<p>for an after-talk.</p>
<p>He opened his heart to me.</p>
<p>"Neither of us," he said, "are dukes, and neither of us are horny-</p>
<p>handed sons of toil. We want to get hold of the handles, and to do</p>
<p>that, one must go where the power is, and give it just as</p>
<p>constructive a twist as we can. That's MY Toryism."</p>
<p>"Is it Kindling's-or Gerbault's?"</p>
<p>"No. But theirs is soft, and mine's hard. Mine will wear theirs</p>
<p>out. You and I and Bailey are all after the same thing, and why</p>
<p>aren't we working together?"</p>
<p>"Are you a Confederate?" I asked suddenly.</p>
<p>"That's a secret nobody tells," he said.</p>
<p>"What are the Confederates after?"</p>
<p>"Making aristocracy work, I suppose. Just as, I gather, you want to</p>
<p>do."…</p>
<p>The Confederates were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2646">being</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2647">heard</a> of at that time. They were at</p>
<p>once attractive and repellent to me, an odd secret society whose</p>
<p>membership nobody <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2648">knew</a>, pledged, it was said, to impose Tariff</p>
<p>Reform and an ample constructive policy upon the Conservatives. In</p>
<p>the press, at any rate, they had an air of deliberately organised</p>
<p>power. I have no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2649">doubt</a> the rumour of them greatly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2650">influenced</a> my</p>
<p>ideas…</p>
<p>In the end I made some very rapid decisions, but for nearly two</p>
<p>years I was hesitating. Hesitations were inevitable in such a</p>
<p>matter. I was not dealing with any simple question of principle,</p>
<p>but with elusive and fluctuating estimates of the trend of diverse</p>
<p>forces and of the nature of my own powers. All through that period</p>
<p>I was asking over and over again: how far are these Confederates</p>
<p>mere dreamers? How far-and this was more vital-are they rendering</p>
<p>lip-service to social organisations? Is it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2651">true</a> they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2652">desire</a> war</p>
<p>because it confirms the ascendency of their class? How far can</p>
<p>Conservatism be induced to plan and construct before it resists the</p>
<p>thrust towards change. Is it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2653">really</a> in bulk anything more than a</p>
<p>mass of prejudice and conceit, cynical indulgence, and a hard</p>
<p>suspicion of and hostility to the expropriated classes in the</p>
<p>community?</p>
<p>That is a research which yields no statistics, an enquiry like</p>
<p>asking what is the ruling colour of a chameleon. The shadowy answer</p>
<p>varied with my health, varied with my mood and the conduct of the</p>
<p>people I was watching. How fine can people be? How <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2654">generous</a>?-not</p>
<p>incidentally, but all round? How far can you educate sons beyond</p>
<p>the outlook of their fathers, and how far lift a rich, proud, self-</p>
<p>indulgent class above the protests of its business agents and</p>
<p>solicitors and its own habits and vanity? Is chivalry in a class</p>
<p>possible?-was it ever, indeed, or will it ever indeed be possible?</p>
<p>Is the progress that seems <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2655">attainable</a> in certain directions worth</p>
<p>the retrogression that may be its price?</p>

<p>4</p>
</title>
<p>It was to the Pentagram Circle that I first broached the new</p>
<p>conceptions that were developing in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2656">mind</a>. I count the evening of</p>
<p>my paper the beginning of the movement that created the BLUE WEEKLY</p>
<p>and our wing of the present New Tory party. I do that without any</p>
<p>excessive egotism, because my essay was no solitary man's</p>
<p>production; it was my reaction to forces that had come to me very</p>
<p>large through my fellow-members; its quick reception by them showed</p>
<p>that I was, so to speak, merely the first of the chestnuts to pop.</p>
<p>The atmospheric quality of the evening stands out very vividly in my</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2657">memory</a>. The night, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2658">remember</a>, was warmly foggy when after midnight</p>
<p>we went to finish our talk at my house.</p>
<p>We had recently changed the rules of the club to admit visitors, and</p>
<p>so it happened that I had brought Britten, and Crupp introduced</p>
<p>Arnold Shoesmith, my former schoolfellow at City Merchants, and now</p>
<p>the wealthy successor of his father and elder brother. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2659">remember</a></p>
<p>his heavy, inexpressively handsome face lighting to his rare smile</p>
<p>at the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2660">sight</a> of me, and how little I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2661">dreamt</a> of the tragic</p>
<p>entanglement that was destined to involve us both. Gane was</p>
<p>present, and Esmeer, a newly-added member, but I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2662">think</a> Bailey was</p>
<p>absent. Either he was absent, or he said something so entirely</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2663">characteristic</a> and undistinguished that it has left no impression on</p>
<p>my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2664">mind</a>.</p>
<p>I had broken a little from the traditions of the club even in my</p>
<p>title, which was deliberately a challenge to the liberal idea: it</p>
<p>was, "The World <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2665">Exists</a> for Exceptional People." It is not the title</p>
<p>I should choose now-for since that time I have got my phrase of</p>
<p>"mental hinterlander" into journalistic use. I should say now, "The</p>
<p>World <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2665">Exists</a> for Mental Hinterland."</p>
<p>The notes I made of that opening have long since vanished with a</p>
<p>thousand other papers, but some odd chance has preserved and brought</p>
<p>with me to Italy the menu for the evening; its back black with the</p>
<p>scrawled notes I made of the discussion for my reply. I found it</p>
<p>the other day among some letters from Margaret and a copy of the</p>
<p>1909 Report of the Poor Law Commission, also rich with pencilled</p>
<p>marginalia.</p>
<p>My opening was a criticism of the democratic idea and method, upon</p>
<p>lines such as I have already sufficiently indicated in the preceding</p>
<p>sections. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2666">remember</a> how old Dayton fretted in his chair, and</p>
<p>tushed and pished at that, even as I gave it, and afterwards we were</p>
<p>treated to one of his platitudinous harangues, he sitting back in</p>
<p>his chair with that small obstinate eye of his fixed on the ceiling,</p>
<p>and a sort of cadaverous glow upon his face, repeating-quite</p>
<p>regardless of all my reasoning and all that had been said by others</p>
<p>in the debate-the sacred empty phrases that were his soul's refuge</p>
<p>from <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2667">reality</a>. "You may <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2668">think</a> it very clever," he said with a nod of</p>
<p>his head to mark his sense of his point, "not to Trust in the</p>
<p>People. I do." And so on. Nothing in his life or work had ever</p>
<p>shown that he did trust in the people, but that was beside the mark.</p>
<p>He was the party Liberal, and these were the party incantations.</p>
<p>After my preliminary attack on vague democracy I went on to show</p>
<p>that all human life was virtually aristocratic; people must either</p>
<p>recognise aristocracy in general or else follow leaders, which is</p>
<p>aristocracy in particular, and so I came to my point that the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2669">reality</a> of human progress lay necessarily through the establishment</p>
<p>of freedoms for the human best and a collective receptivity and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2670">understanding</a>. There was a disgusted grunt from Dayton, "Superman</p>
<p>rubbish-Nietzsche. Shaw! Ugh!" I sailed on over him to my next</p>
<p>propositions. The prime essential in a progressive civilisation was</p>
<p>the establishment of a more <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2671">effective</a> selective process for the</p>
<p>privilege of higher education, and the very highest educational</p>
<p>opportunity for the educable. We were too apt to patronise</p>
<p>scholarship winners, as though a scholarship was toffee given as a</p>
<p>reward for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2672">virtue</a>. It wasn't any reward at all; it was an</p>
<p>invitation to capacity. We had no more right to drag in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2672">virtue</a>, or</p>
<p>any merit but quality, than we had to involve it in a search for the</p>
<p>tallest man. We didn't want a mere process for the selection of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2673">good</a> as distinguished from gifted and able boys-"No, you DON'T,"</p>
<p>from Dayton-we wanted all the brilliant stuff in the world</p>
<p>concentrated upon the development of the world. Just to exasperate</p>
<p>Dayton further I put in a plea for gifts as against <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2674">character</a> in</p>
<p>educational, artistic, and legislative work. "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2673">Good</a> teaching," I</p>
<p>said, "is better than <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2673">good</a> conduct. We are becoming idiotic about</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2674">character</a>."</p>
<p>Dayton was too moved to speak. He slewed round upon me an eye of</p>
<p>agonised aversion.</p>
<p>I expatiated on the small proportion of the available ability that</p>
<p>is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2675">really</a> serving humanity to-day. "I suppose to-day all the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2676">thought</a>, all the art, all the increments of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2677">knowledge</a> that matter,</p>
<p>are supplied so far as the English-speaking community is concerned</p>
<p>by-how many?-by three or four thousand individuals. ('Less,' said</p>
<p>Thorns.) To be more precise, by the mental hinterlands of three or</p>
<p>four thousand individuals. We who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2678">know</a> some of the band entertain</p>
<p>no illusions as to their innate rarity. We <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2678">know</a> that they are just</p>
<p>the few out of many, the few who got in our world of chance and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2679">confusion</a>, the timely stimulus, the apt suggestion at the fortunate</p>
<p>moment, the needed training, the leisure. The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2680">rest</a> are lost in the</p>
<p>crowd, fail through the defects of their qualities, become</p>
<p>commonplace workmen and second-rate professional men, marry</p>
<p>commonplace wives, are as much waste as the driftage of superfluous</p>
<p>pollen in a pine forest is waste."</p>
<p>"Decent honest lives!" said Dayton to his bread-crumbs, with his</p>
<p>chin in his necktie. "WASTE!"</p>
<p>"And the people who do get what we call opportunity get it usually</p>
<p>in extremely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2681">limited</a> and cramping <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2682">forms</a>. No man lives a life of</p>
<p>intellectual productivity <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2683">alone</a>; he needs not only material and</p>
<p>opportunity, but <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2684">helpers</a>, resonators. Round and about what I might</p>
<p>call the REAL men, you want the sympathetic cooperators, who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2685">help</a> by</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2686">understanding</a>. It isn't that our-SALT of three or four thousand is</p>
<p>needlessly rare; it is sustained by far too small and</p>
<p>undifferentiated a public. Most of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2687">good</a> men we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2688">know</a> are not</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2689">really</a> doing the very best work of their gifts; nearly all are a</p>
<p>little adapted, most are shockingly adapted to some second-best use.</p>
<p>Now, I take it, this is the very centre and origin of the muddle,</p>
<p>futility, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2690">unhappiness</a> that distresses us; it's the cardinal</p>
<p>problem of the state-to discover, develop, and use the exceptional</p>
<p>gifts of men. And I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2691">see</a> that best done-I drift more and more away</p>
<p>from the common stuff of legislative and administrative activity-by</p>
<p>a quite revolutionary development of the educational machinery, but</p>
<p>by a still more unprecedented attempt to keep science going, to keep</p>
<p>literature going, and to keep what is the necessary spur of all</p>
<p>science and literature, an intelligent and appreciative criticism</p>
<p>going. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2688">know</a> none of these things have ever been kept going</p>
<p>hitherto; they've come unexpectedly and inexplicably."</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2692">Hear</a>, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2692">hear</a>!" from Dayton, cough, nodding of the head, and an</p>
<p>expression of mystical profundity.</p>
<p>"They've lit up a civilisation and vanished, to give place to</p>
<p>darkness again. Now the modern <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2693">state</a> doesn't mean to go back to</p>
<p>darkness again-and so it's got to keep its light burning." I went</p>
<p>on to attack the present organisation of our schools and</p>
<p>universities, which seemed elaborately designed to turn the well-</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2694">behaved</a>, uncritical, and uncreative men of each generation into the</p>
<p>authoritative leaders of the next, and I suggested remedies upon</p>
<p>lines that I have already indicated in the earlier chapters of this</p>
<p>story…</p>
<p>So far I had the substance of the club with me, but I opened new</p>
<p>ground and set Crupp agog by confessing my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2695">doubt</a> from which party or</p>
<p>combination of groups these developments of science and literature</p>
<p>and educational organisation could most reasonably be expected. I</p>
<p>looked up to find Crupp's dark little eye intent upon me.</p>
<p>There I left it to them.</p>
<p>We had an astonishingly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2696">good</a> discussion; Neal burst once, but we</p>
<p>emerged from his flood after a time, and Dayton had his interlude.</p>
<p>The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2697">rest</a> was all close, keen examination of my problem.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2698">see</a> Crupp now with his arm bent before him on the table in a way</p>
<p>we had, as though it was jointed throughout its length like a</p>
<p>lobster's antenna, his plump, short-fingered hand crushing up a</p>
<p>walnut shell into smaller and smaller fragments. "Remington," he</p>
<p>said, "has given us the data for a movement, a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2699">really</a> possible</p>
<p>movement. It's not only possible, but necessary-urgently</p>
<p>necessary, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2700">think</a>, if the Empire is to go on."</p>
<p>"We're working altogether too much at the social basement in</p>
<p>education and training," said Gane. "Remington is right about our</p>
<p>neglect of the higher levels."</p>
<p>Britten made a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2701">good</a> contribution with an analysis of what he called</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2702">spirit</a> of a country and what made it. "The modern community</p>
<p>needs its serious men to be artistic and its artists to be taken</p>
<p>seriously," I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2703">remember</a> his saying. "The day has gone by for either</p>
<p>dull <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2704">responsibility</a> or merely witty art."</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2705">remember</a> very vividly how Shoesmith harped on an idea I had thrown</p>
<p>out of using some sort of review or weekly to express and elaborate</p>
<p>these conceptions of a new, severer, aristocratic culture.</p>
<p>"It would have to be done amazingly well," said Britten, and my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2706">mind</a></p>
<p>went back to my school days and that ancient enterprise of ours, and</p>
<p>how Cossington had rushed it. Well, Cossington had too many papers</p>
<p>nowadays to interfere with us, and we perhaps had learnt some</p>
<p>defensive devices.</p>
<p>"But this thing has to be linked to some political party," said</p>
<p>Crupp, with his eye on me. "You can't get away from that. The</p>
<p>Liberals," he added, "have never done anything for research or</p>
<p>literature."</p>
<p>"They had a Royal Commission on the Dramatic Censorship," said</p>
<p>Thorns, with a note of minute fairness. "It shows what they were</p>
<p>made of," he added.</p>
<p>"It's what I've told Remington again and again," said Crupp, "we've</p>
<p>got to pick up the tradition of aristocracy, reorganise it, and make</p>
<p>it work. But he's certainly suggested a method."</p>
<p>"There won't be much aristocracy to pick up," said Dayton, darkly to</p>
<p>the ceiling, "if the House of Lords throws out the Budget."</p>
<p>"All the more reason for picking it up," said Neal. "For we can't</p>
<p>do without it."</p>
<p>"Will they go to the bad, or will they rise from the ashes,</p>
<p>aristocrats indeed-if the Liberals come in overwhelmingly?" said</p>
<p>Britten.</p>
<p>"It's we who might decide that," said Crupp, insidiously.</p>
<p>"I agree," said Gane.</p>
<p>"No one can tell," said Thorns. "I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2707">doubt</a> if they will get beaten."</p>
<p>It was an odd, fragmentary discussion that night. We were all with</p>
<p>ideas in our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2708">minds</a> at once fine and imperfect. We threw out</p>
<p>suggestions that showed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2709">themselves</a> at once far inadequate, and we</p>
<p>tried to qualify them by minor self-contradictions. Britten, I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2710">think</a>, got more said than any one. "You all seem to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2710">think</a> you want</p>
<p>to organise people, particular groups and classes of individuals,"</p>
<p>he insisted. "It isn't that. That's the standing error of</p>
<p>politicians. You want to organise a culture. Civilisation isn't a</p>
<p>matter of concrete groupings; it's a matter of prevailing ideas.</p>
<p>The problem is how to make bold, clear ideas prevail. The question</p>
<p>for Remington and us is just what groups of people will most <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2711">help</a></p>
<p>this culture forward."</p>
<p>"Yes, but how are the Lords going to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2712">behave</a>?" said Crupp. "You</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2713">yourself</a> were asking that a little while ago."</p>
<p>"If they win or if they lose," Gane maintained, "there will be a</p>
<p>movement to reorganise aristocracy-Reform of the House of Lords,</p>
<p>they'll call the political <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2714">form</a> of it."</p>
<p>"Bailey <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2715">thinks</a> that," said some one.</p>
<p>"The labour people want abolition," said some one. "Let 'em," said</p>
<p>Thorns.</p>
<p>He became audible, sketching a possibility of action.</p>
<p>"Suppose all of us were able to work together. It's just one of</p>
<p>those indeterminate, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2716">confused</a>, eventful times ahead when a steady</p>
<p>jet of ideas might produce enormous results."</p>
<p>"Leave me out of it," said Dayton, "IF you please."</p>
<p>"We should," said Thorns under his breath.</p>
<p>I took up Crupp's initiative, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2717">remember</a>, and expanded it.</p>
<p>"I believe we could do-extensive things," I insisted.</p>
<p>"Revivals and revisions of Toryism have been tried so often," said</p>
<p>Thorns, "from the Young England movement onward."</p>
<p>"Not one but has produced its enduring <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2718">effects</a>," I said. "It's the</p>
<p>peculiarity of English conservatism that it's persistently</p>
<p>progressive and rejuvenescent."</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2719">think</a> it must have been about that point that Dayton fled our</p>
<p>presence, after some clumsy sentence that I decided upon reflection</p>
<p>was intended to remind me of my duty to my party.</p>
<p>Then I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2720">remember</a> Thorns firing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2721">doubts</a> at me obliquely across the</p>
<p>table. "You can't run a country through its spoilt children," he</p>
<p>said. "What you call aristocrats are <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2722">really</a> spoilt children.</p>
<p>They've had too much of everything, except bracing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2723">experience</a>."</p>
<p>"Children can always be educated," said Crupp.</p>
<p>"I said SPOILT children," said Thorns.</p>
<p>"Look here, Thorns!" said I. "If this Budget row leads to a storm,</p>
<p>and these big people get their power clipped, what's going to</p>
<p>happen? Have you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2724">thought</a> of that? When they go out lock, stock,</p>
<p>and barrel, who comes in?"</p>
<p>"Nature abhors a Vacuum," said Crupp, supporting me.</p>
<p>"Bailey's trained officials," suggested Gane.</p>
<p>"Quacks with a certificate of approval from Altiora," said Thorns.</p>
<p>"I admit the horrors of the alternative. There'd be a massacre in</p>
<p>three years."</p>
<p>"One may go on trying possibilities for ever," I said. "One thing</p>
<p>emerges. Whatever accidents happen, our civilisation needs, and</p>
<p>almost <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2725">consciously</a> needs, a culture of fine creative <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2726">minds</a>, and all</p>
<p>the necessary tolerances, opennesses, considerations, that march</p>
<p>with that. For my own part, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2727">think</a> that is the Most Vital Thing.</p>
<p>Build your ship of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2728">state</a> as you will; get your men as you will; I</p>
<p>concentrate on what is clearly the affair of my sort of man,-I want</p>
<p>to ensure the quality of the quarter deck."</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2729">Hear</a>, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2729">hear</a>!" said Shoesmith, suddenly-his first remark for a long</p>
<p>time. "A first-rate figure," said Shoesmith, gripping it.</p>
<p>"Our danger is in missing that," I went on. "Muddle isn't ended by</p>
<p>transferring power from the muddle-headed few to the muddle-headed</p>
<p>many, and then cheating the many out of it again in the interests of</p>
<p>a bureaucracy of sham experts. But that seems the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2730">limit</a> of the</p>
<p>liberal imagination. There is no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2731">real</a> progress in a country, except</p>
<p>a rise in the level of its free intellectual activity. All other</p>
<p>progress is secondary and dependant. If you take on Bailey's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2732">dreams</a></p>
<p>of efficient machinery and a sort of fanatical discipline with no</p>
<p>free-moving brains behind it, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2733">confused</a> ugliness becomes rigid</p>
<p>ugliness,-that's all. No <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2734">doubt</a> things are moving from looseness to</p>
<p>discipline, and from irresponsible controls to organised controls-</p>
<p>and also and rather contrariwise everything is becoming as people</p>
<p>say, democratised; but all the more need in that, for an ark in</p>
<p>which the living element may be saved."</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2735">Hear</a>, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2735">hear</a>!" said Shoesmith, faint but pursuing.</p>
<p>It must have been in my house afterwards that Shoesmith became</p>
<p>noticeable. He seemed trying to say something vague and difficult</p>
<p>that he didn't get said at all on that occasion. "We could do</p>
<p>immense things with a weekly," he repeated, echoing Neal, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2736">think</a>.</p>
<p>And there he left off and became a mute expressiveness, and it was</p>
<p>only afterwards, when I was in bed, that I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2737">saw</a> we had our capitalist</p>
<p>in our hands…</p>
<p>We parted that night on my doorstep in a tremendous glow-but in</p>
<p>that sort of glow one doesn't act upon without much reconsideration,</p>
<p>and it was some months before I made my decision to follow up the</p>
<p>indications of that opening talk.</p>

</title>
<p>I find my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2738">thoughts</a> lingering about the Pentagram Circle. In my</p>
<p>developments it played a large part, not so much by starting new</p>
<p>trains of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2738">thought</a> as by confirming the practicability of things I</p>
<p>had already hesitatingly entertained. Discussion with these other</p>
<p>men so prominently involved in current affairs endorsed views that</p>
<p>otherwise would have seemed only a little less remote from actuality</p>
<p>than the guardians of Plato or the labour laws of More. Among other</p>
<p>questions that were never very distant from our discussions, that</p>
<p>came apt to every topic, was the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2739">true</a> significance of democracy,</p>
<p>Tariff Reform as a method of international hostility, and the</p>
<p>imminence of war. On the first issue I can still recall little</p>
<p>Bailey, glib and winking, explaining that democracy was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2740">really</a> just</p>
<p>a dodge for getting assent to the ordinances of the expert official</p>
<p>by means of the polling booth. "If they don't like things," said</p>
<p>he, "they can vote for the opposition candidate and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2741">see</a> what happens</p>
<p>then-and that, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2741">see</a>, is why we don't want proportional</p>
<p>representation to let in the wild men." I opened my eyes-the lids</p>
<p>had dropped for a moment under the caress of those smooth sounds-to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2741">see</a> if Bailey's artful forefinger wasn't at the side of his</p>
<p>predominant nose.</p>
<p>The international situation exercised us greatly. Our meetings were</p>
<p>pervaded by the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2742">feeling</a> that all things moved towards a day of</p>
<p>reckoning with Germany, and I was largely instrumental in keeping up</p>
<p>the suggestion that India was in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2743">state</a> of unstable equilibrium,</p>
<p>that sooner or later something must happen there-something very</p>
<p>serious to our Empire. Dayton frankly detested these topics. He</p>
<p>was full of that old Middle Victorian persuasion that whatever is</p>
<p>inconvenient or disagreeable to the English <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2744">mind</a> could be</p>
<p>annihilated by not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2745">thinking</a> about it. He used to sit low in his</p>
<p>chair and look mulish. "Militarism," he would declare in a tone of</p>
<p>the utmost moral fervour, is a curse. It's an unmitigated curse."</p>
<p>Then he would cough shortly and twitch his head back and frown, and</p>
<p>seem astonished beyond measure that after this conclusive statement</p>
<p>we could still go on talking of war.</p>
<p>All our Imperialists were obsessed by the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2746">thought</a> of international</p>
<p>conflict, and their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2747">influence</a> revived for a time those uneasinesses</p>
<p>that had been aroused in me for the first time by my continental</p>
<p>journey with Willersley and by Meredith's "One of Our Conquerors."</p>
<p>That quite justifiable dread of a punishment for all the slackness,</p>
<p>mental dishonesty, presumption, mercenary respectability and</p>
<p>sentimentalised commercialism of the Victorian period, at the hands</p>
<p>of the better organised, more vigorous, and now far more highly</p>
<p>civilised peoples of Central Europe, seemed to me to have both a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2748">good</a> and bad series of consequences. It seemed the only thing</p>
<p>capable of bracing English <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2749">minds</a> to education, sustained</p>
<p>constructive effort and research; but on the other hand it produced</p>
<p>the quality of a panic, hasty preparation, impatience of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2746">thought</a>, a</p>
<p>wasteful and sometimes quite futile immediacy. In 1909, for</p>
<p>example, there was a vast clamour for eight additional Dreadnoughts-</p>
<p>"We want eight</p>
<p>And we won't wait,"</p>
<p>but no clamour at all about our national waste of inventive talent,</p>
<p>our mean standard of intellectual <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2750">attainment</a>, our disingenuous</p>
<p>criticism, and the consequent failure to distinguish men of the</p>
<p>quality needed to carry on the modern type of war. Almost</p>
<p>universally we have the wrong men in our places of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2751">responsibility</a></p>
<p>and the right men in no place at all, almost universally we have</p>
<p>poorly qualified, hesitating, and resentful subordinates, because</p>
<p>our criticism is worthless and, so habitually as to be now almost</p>
<p>unconsciously, dishonest. Germany is beating England in every</p>
<p>matter upon which competition is possible, because she attended</p>
<p>sedulously to her collective <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2752">mind</a> for sixty pregnant years, because</p>
<p>in spite of tremendous defects she is still far more anxious for</p>
<p>quality in achievement than we are. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2753">remember</a> saying that in my</p>
<p>paper. From that, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2753">remember</a>, I went on to an image that had</p>
<p>flashed into my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2752">mind</a>. "The British Empire," I said, "is like some</p>
<p>of those early vertebrated monsters, the Brontosaurus and the</p>
<p>Atlantosaurus and such-like; it sacrifices intellect to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2754">character</a>;</p>
<p>its backbone, that is to say,-especially in the visceral region-is</p>
<p>bigger than its cranium. It's no accident that things are so.</p>
<p>We've worked for backbone. We brag about backbone, and if the</p>
<p>joints are anchylosed so much the better. We're still but only half</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2755">awake</a> to our error. You can't change that suddenly."</p>
<p>"Turn it round and make it go backwards," interjected Thorns.</p>
<p>"It's trying to do that," I said, "in places."</p>
<p>And afterwards Crupp declared I had begotten a nightmare which</p>
<p>haunted him of nights; he was trying desperately and belatedly to</p>
<p>blow a brain as one blows soap-bubbles on such a mezoroic saurian as</p>
<p>I had conjured up, while the clumsy monster's fate, all teeth and</p>
<p>brains, crept nearer and nearer…</p>
<p>I've <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2756">grown</a>, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2757">think</a>, since those days out of the urgency of that</p>
<p>apprehension. I still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2757">think</a> a European war, and conceivably a very</p>
<p>humiliating war for England, may occur at no very distant date, but</p>
<p>I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2757">think</a> there is any such heroic quality in our governing</p>
<p>class as will make that war catastrophic. The prevailing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2758">spirit</a> in</p>
<p>English life-it is one of the essential secrets of our imperial</p>
<p>endurance-is one of underbred aggression in prosperity and</p>
<p>diplomatic compromise in moments of danger; we bully haughtily where</p>
<p>we can and assimilate where we must. It is not for nothing that our</p>
<p>upper and middle-class youth is educated by teachers of the highest</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2759">character</a>, scholars and gentlemen, men who can pretend quite</p>
<p>honestly that Darwinism hasn't upset the historical fall of man,</p>
<p>that cricket is moral training, and that Socialism is an outrage</p>
<p>upon the teachings of Christ. A sort of dignified dexterity of</p>
<p>evasion is the national reward. Germany, with a larger population,</p>
<p>a vigorous and irreconcilable proletariat, a bolder intellectual</p>
<p>training, a harsher <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2758">spirit</a>, can scarcely fail to drive us at last to</p>
<p>a realisation of intolerable strain. So we may never fight at all.</p>
<p>The war of preparations that has been going on for thirty years may</p>
<p>end like a sham-fight at last in an umpire's decision. We shall</p>
<p>proudly but very firmly take the second place. For my own part,</p>
<p>since I love England as much as I detest her present lethargy of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2760">soul</a>, I pray for a chastening war-I wouldn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2761">mind</a> her flag in the</p>
<p>dirt if only her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2758">spirit</a> would come out of it. So I was able to</p>
<p>shake off that earlier <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2762">fear</a> of some final and irrevocable</p>
<p>destruction truncating all my schemes. At the most, a European war</p>
<p>would be a dramatic episode in the reconstruction I had in view.</p>
<p>In India, too, I no longer <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2763">foresee</a>, as once I was inclined to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2764">see</a>,</p>
<p>disaster. The English rule in India is surely one of the most</p>
<p>extraordinary accidents that has ever happened in history. We are</p>
<p>there like a man who has fallen off a ladder on to the neck of an</p>
<p>elephant, and doesn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2765">know</a> what to do or how to get down. Until</p>
<p>something happens he remains. Our functions in India are absurd.</p>
<p>We English do not own that country, do not even rule it. We make</p>
<p>nothing happen; at the most we prevent things happening. We</p>
<p>suppress our own literature there. Most English people cannot even</p>
<p>go to this land they possess; the authorities would prevent it. If</p>
<p>Messrs. Perowne or Cook organised a cheap tour of Manchester</p>
<p>operatives, it would be stopped. No one dare bring the average</p>
<p>English voter face to face with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2766">reality</a> of India, or let the</p>
<p>Indian native have a glimpse of the English voter. In my time I</p>
<p>have talked to English statesmen, Indian officials and ex-officials,</p>
<p>viceroys, soldiers, every one who might be supposed to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2765">know</a> what</p>
<p>India signifies, and I have prayed them to tell me what they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2767">thought</a></p>
<p>we were up to there. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2768">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2769">am</a> not writing without my book in these</p>
<p>matters. And beyond a phrase or so about "even-handed justice"-and</p>
<p>look at our sedition trials!-they told me nothing. Time after time</p>
<p>I have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2770">heard</a> of that apocryphal native ruler in the north-west, who,</p>
<p>when asked what would happen if we left India, replied that in a</p>
<p>week his men would be in the saddle, and in six months not a rupee</p>
<p>nor a virgin would he left in Lower Bengal. That is always given as</p>
<p>our conclusive justification. But is it our business to preserve</p>
<p>the rupees and virgins of Lower Bengal in a sort of magic</p>
<p>inconclusiveness? Better plunder than paralysis, better fire and</p>
<p>sword than futility. Our flag is spread over the peninsula, without</p>
<p>plans, without intentions-a vast preventive. The sum total of our</p>
<p>policy is to arrest any discussion, any conferences that would</p>
<p>enable the Indians to work out a tolerable scheme of the future for</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2771">themselves</a>. But that does not arrest the resentment of men held</p>
<p>back from life. Consider what it must be for the educated Indian</p>
<p>sitting at the feast of contemporary possibilities with his mouth</p>
<p>gagged and his hands bound behind him! The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2772">spirit</a> of insurrection</p>
<p>breaks out in spite of espionage and seizures. Our conflict for</p>
<p>inaction develops stupendous absurdities. The other day the British</p>
<p>Empire was taking off and examining printed cotton stomach wraps for</p>
<p>seditious emblems and inscriptions…</p>
<p>In some manner we shall have to come out of India. We have had our</p>
<p>chance, and we have demonstrated nothing but the appalling dulness</p>
<p>of our national imagination. We are not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2773">good</a> enough to do anything</p>
<p>with India. Codger and Flack, and Gates and Dayton, Cladingbowl in</p>
<p>the club, and the HOME CHURCHMAN in the home, cant about</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2774">character</a>," worship of strenuous force and contempt of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2775">truth</a>; for</p>
<p>the sake of such men and things as these, we must abandon in fact,</p>
<p>if not in appearance, that empty domination. Had we great schools</p>
<p>and a powerful teaching, could we boast great men, had we the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2776">spirit</a></p>
<p>of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2775">truth</a> and creation in our lives, then indeed it might be</p>
<p>different. But a race that bears a sceptre must carry gifts to</p>
<p>justify it.</p>
<p>It does not follow that we shall be driven catastrophically from</p>
<p>India. That was my earlier mistake. We are not proud enough in our</p>
<p>bones to be ruined by India as Spain was by her empire. We may be</p>
<p>able to abandon India with an air of still remaining there. It is</p>
<p>our new method. We train our future rulers in the public schools to</p>
<p>have a very wholesome respect for strength, and as soon as a power</p>
<p>arises in India in spite of us, be it a man or a culture, or a</p>
<p>native <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2777">state</a>, we shall he willing to deal with it. We may or may</p>
<p>not have a war, but our governing class will be quick to learn when</p>
<p>we are beaten. Then they will repeat our South African diplomacy,</p>
<p>and arrange for some settlement that will abandon the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2778">reality</a>, such</p>
<p>as it is, and preserve the semblance of power. The conqueror DE</p>
<p>FACTO will become the new "loyal Briton," and the democracy at home</p>
<p>will be invited to celebrate our recession-triumphantly. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2779">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2780">am</a> no</p>
<p>believer in the imminent dissolution of our Empire; <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2779">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2780">am</a> less and</p>
<p>less inclined to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2781">see</a> in either India or Germany the probability of</p>
<p>an abrupt truncation of those slow intellectual and moral</p>
<p>constructions which are the essentials of statecraft.</p>

</title>
<p>I sit writing in this little loggia to the sound of dripping water-</p>
<p>this morning we had rain, and the roof of our little casa is still</p>
<p>not dry, there are pools in the rocks under the sweet chestnuts, and</p>
<p>the torrent that crosses the salita is full and boastful,-and I try</p>
<p>to recall the order of my impressions during that watching, dubious</p>
<p>time, before I went over to the Conservative Party. I was trying-</p>
<p>chaotic task-to gauge the possibilities inherent in the quality of</p>
<p>the British aristocracy. There comes a broad spectacular <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2782">effect</a> of</p>
<p>wide parks, diversified by woods and bracken valleys, and dappled</p>
<p>with deer; of great smooth lawns shaded by ancient trees; of big</p>
<p>facades of sunlit buildings dominating the country side; of large</p>
<p>fine rooms full of handsome, easy-mannered people. As a sort of</p>
<p>representative picture to set off against those other pictures of</p>
<p>Liberals and of Socialists I have given, I recall one of those huge</p>
<p>assemblies the Duchess of Clynes inaugurated at Stamford House. The</p>
<p>place itself is one of the vastest private houses in London, a huge</p>
<p>clustering mass of white and gold saloons with polished floors and</p>
<p>wonderful pictures, and staircases and galleries on a Gargantuan</p>
<p>scale. And there she sought to gather all that was most</p>
<p>representative of English activities, and did, in fact, in those</p>
<p>brilliant nocturnal crowds, get samples of nearly every section of</p>
<p>our social and intellectual life, with a marked predominance upon</p>
<p>the political and social side.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2783">remember</a> sitting in one of the recesses at the end of the big</p>
<p>saloon with Mrs. Redmondson, one of those sharp-minded, beautiful</p>
<p>rich women one meets so often in London, who seem to have done</p>
<p>nothing and to be capable of everything, and we watched the crowd-</p>
<p>uniforms and splendours were streaming in from a State ball-and</p>
<p>exchanged information. I told her about the politicians and</p>
<p>intellectuals, and she told me about the aristocrats, and we</p>
<p>sharpened our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2784">wit</a> on them and counted the percentage of beautiful</p>
<p>people among the latter, and wondered if the general <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2785">effect</a> of</p>
<p>tallness was or was not an illusion.</p>
<p>They were, we agreed, for the most part bigger than the average of</p>
<p>people in London, and a handsome lot, even when they were not subtly</p>
<p>individualised. "They look so well nurtured," I said, "well cared</p>
<p>for. I like their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2786">quiet</a>, well-trained movements, their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2787">pleasant</a></p>
<p>consideration for each other."</p>
<p>"Kindly, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2788">good</a> tempered, and at bottom utterly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2789">selfish</a>," she said,</p>
<p>"like big, rather carefully trained, rather pampered children. What</p>
<p>else can you expect from them?"</p>
<p>"They are <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2790">good</a> tempered, anyhow," I witnessed, "and that's an</p>
<p>achievement. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2791">think</a> I could ever be content under a bad-</p>
<p>tempered, sentimentalism, strenuous Government. That's why I</p>
<p>couldn't stand the Roosevelt REGIME in America. One's chief</p>
<p>surprise when one comes across these big people for the first time</p>
<p>is their admirable easiness and a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2792">real</a> personal modesty. I confess</p>
<p>I admire them. Oh! I like them. I wouldn't at all <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2793">mind</a>, I believe,</p>
<p>giving over the country to this aristocracy-given SOMETHING-"</p>
<p>"Which they haven't got."</p>
<p>"Which they haven't got-or they'd be the finest sort of people in</p>
<p>the world."</p>
<p>"That something?" she inquired.</p>
<p>"I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2794">know</a>. I've been puzzling my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2795">wits</a> to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2794">know</a>. They've done</p>
<p>all sorts of things-"</p>
<p>"That's Lord Wrassleton," she interrupted, "whose leg was broken-</p>
<p>you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2796">remember</a>?-at Spion Kop."</p>
<p>"It's healed very well. I like the gold lace and the white glove</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2797">resting</a>, with quite a nice awkwardness, on the sword. When I was a</p>
<p>little boy I wanted to wear clothes like that. And the stars! He's</p>
<p>got the V. C. Most of these people here have at any rate shown</p>
<p>pluck, you know-brought something off."</p>
<p>"Not quite enough," she suggested.</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2798">think</a> that's it," I said. "Not quite enough-not quite hard</p>
<p>enough," I added.</p>
<p>She laughed and looked at me. "You'd like to make us," she said.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Hard."</p>
<p>"I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2799">think</a> you'll go on if you don't get hard."</p>
<p>"We shan't be so <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2800">pleasant</a> if we do."</p>
<p>"Well, there my puzzled <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2801">wits</a> come in again. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2802">see</a> why an</p>
<p>aristocracy shouldn't be rather hard trained, and yet kindly. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2803">I'm</a></p>
<p>not convinced that the resources of education are exhausted. I want</p>
<p>to better this, because it already looks so <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2804">good</a>."</p>
<p>"How are we to do it?" asked Mrs. Redmondson.</p>
<p>"Oh, there you have me! I've been spending my time lately in trying</p>
<p>to answer that! It makes me quarrel with"-I held up my fingers and</p>
<p>ticked the items off-"the public schools, the private tutors, the</p>
<p>army exams, the Universities, the Church, the general <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2805">attitude</a> of</p>
<p>the country towards science and literature-"</p>
<p>"We all do," said Mrs. Redmondson. "We can't begin again at the</p>
<p>beginning," she added.</p>
<p>"Couldn't one," I nodded at the assembly in general, start a</p>
<p>movement?</p>
<p>"There's the Confederates," she said, with a faint smile that masked</p>
<p>a gleam of curiosity… "You want," she said, "to say to the</p>
<p>aristocracy, 'Be aristocrats. NOBLESSE OBLIGE.' Do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2806">remember</a></p>
<p>what happened to the monarch who was told to 'Be a King'?"</p>
<p>"Well," I said, "I want an aristocracy."</p>
<p>"This," she said, smiling, "is the pick of them. The backwoodsmen</p>
<p>are off the stage. These are the brilliant ones-the smart and the</p>
<p>blues… They cost a lot of money, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2807">know</a>."</p>
<p>So far Mrs. Redmondson, but the picture remained full of things not</p>
<p>stated in our speech. They were on the whole handsome people,</p>
<p>charitable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2808">minded</a>, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2809">happy</a>, and easy. They led spacious lives, and</p>
<p>there was something free and fearless about their bearing that I</p>
<p>liked extremely. The women particularly were wide-reading, fine-</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2810">thinking</a>. Mrs. Redmondson talked as fully and widely and boldly as</p>
<p>a man, and with those flashes of intuition, those startling, sudden</p>
<p>delicacies of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2811">perception</a> few men display. I liked, too, the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2812">relations</a> that held between women and men, their general tolerance,</p>
<p>their antagonism to the harsh <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2813">jealousies</a> that are the essence of the</p>
<p>middle-class order…</p>
<p>After all, if one's aim resolved itself into the development of a</p>
<p>type and culture of men, why shouldn't one begin at this end?</p>
<p>It is very easy indeed to generalise about a class or human beings,</p>
<p>but much harder to produce a sample. Was old Lady Forthundred, for</p>
<p>instance, fairly a sample? I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2814">remember</a> her as a smiling, magnificent</p>
<p>presence, a towering accumulation of figure and wonderful shimmering</p>
<p>blue silk and black lace and black hair, and small fine features and</p>
<p>chins and chins and chins, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2815">disposed</a> in a big cane chair with wraps</p>
<p>and cushions upon the great terrace of Champneys. Her eye was blue</p>
<p>and hard, and her accent and intonation were exactly what you would</p>
<p>expect from a rather commonplace dressmaker pretending to be</p>
<p>aristocratic. I was, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2816">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2817">am</a> afraid, posing a little as the</p>
<p>intelligent but respectful inquirer from below investigating the</p>
<p>great world, and she was certainly posing as my informant. She</p>
<p>affected a cynical coarseness. She developed a theory on the</p>
<p>governance of England, beautifully frank and simple. "Give 'um all</p>
<p>a peerage when they get twenty thousand a year," she maintained.</p>
<p>"That's my remedy."</p>
<p>In my new role of theoretical aristocrat I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2818">felt</a> a little abashed.</p>
<p>"Twenty thousand," she repeated with conviction.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that I was in the presence of the aristocratic</p>
<p>theory currently working as distinguished from my as yet</p>
<p>unformulated intentions.</p>
<p>"You'll get a lot of loafers and scamps among 'um," said Lady</p>
<p>Forthundred. "You get loafers and scamps everywhere, but you'll get</p>
<p>a lot of men who'll work hard to keep things together, and that's</p>
<p>what we're all after, isn't ut?</p>
<p>"It's not an ideal arrangement."</p>
<p>"Tell me anything better," said Lady Forthundred.</p>
<p>On the whole, and because she refused emphatically to believe in</p>
<p>education, Lady Forthundred scored.</p>
<p>We had been discussing Cossington's recent peerage, for Cossington,</p>
<p>my old schoolfellow at City Merchants', and my victor in the affair</p>
<p>of the magazine, had clambered to an amazing wealth up a piled heap</p>
<p>of energetically pushed penny and halfpenny magazines, and a group</p>
<p>of daily newspapers. I had expected to find the great lady hostile</p>
<p>to the new-comer, but she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2819">accepted</a> him, she gloried in him.</p>
<p>"We're a peerage," she said, "but none of us have ever had any</p>
<p>nonsense about <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2820">nobility</a>."</p>
<p>She turned and smiled down on me. "We English," she said, "are a</p>
<p>practical people. We assimilate 'um."</p>
<p>"Then, I suppose, they don't give trouble?"</p>
<p>"Then they don't give trouble."</p>
<p>"They learn to shoot?"</p>
<p>"And all that," said Lady Forthundred. "Yes. And things go on.</p>
<p>Sometimes better than others, but they go on-somehow. It depends</p>
<p>very much on the sort of butler who pokes 'um about."</p>
<p>I suggested that it might be possible to get a secure twenty</p>
<p>thousand a year by at least detrimental methods-socially speaking.</p>
<p>"We must take the bad and the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2821">good</a> of 'um," said Lady Forthundred,</p>
<p>courageously…</p>
<p>Now, was she a sample? It happened she talked. What was there in</p>
<p>the brains of the multitude of her first, second, third, fourth, and</p>
<p>fifth cousins, who didn't talk, who shone tall, and bearing</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2822">themselves</a> finely, against a background of deft, attentive maids and</p>
<p>valets, on every spacious social scene? How did things look to</p>
<p>them?</p>

</title>
<p>Side by side with Lady Forthundred, it is curious to put Evesham</p>
<p>with his tall, bent body, his little-featured almost elvish face,</p>
<p>his unequal mild brown eyes, his gentle manner, his sweet, amazing</p>
<p>oratory. He led all these people wonderfully. He was always</p>
<p>curious and interested about life, wary beneath a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2823">pleasing</a></p>
<p>frankness-and I tormented my brain to get to the bottom of him.</p>
<p>For a long time he was the most powerful man in England under the</p>
<p>throne; he had the Lords in his hand, and a great majority in the</p>
<p>Commons, and the discontents and intrigues that are the concomitants</p>
<p>of an overwhelming party advantage broke against him as waves break</p>
<p>against a cliff. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2824">foresaw</a> so far in these matters that it seemed</p>
<p>he scarcely troubled to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2825">foresee</a>. He brought political art to the</p>
<p>last triumph of naturalness. Always for me he has been the typical</p>
<p>aristocrat, so typical and above the mere <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2826">forms</a> of aristocracy, that</p>
<p>he remained a commoner to the end of his days.</p>
<p>I had met him at the beginning of my career; he read some early</p>
<p>papers of mine, and asked to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2827">see</a> me, and I conceived a flattered</p>
<p>liking for him that strengthened to a very strong <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2828">feeling</a> indeed.</p>
<p>He seemed to me to stand <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2829">alone</a> without an equal, the greatest man in</p>
<p>British political life. Some men one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2830">sees</a> through and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2831">understands</a>,</p>
<p>some one cannot <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2827">see</a> into or round because they are of opaque clay,</p>
<p>but about Evesham I had a sense of things hidden as it were by depth</p>
<p>and mists, because he was so big and atmospheric a personality. No</p>
<p>other contemporary has had that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2832">effect</a> upon me. I've sat beside him</p>
<p>at dinners, stayed in houses with him-he was in the big house party</p>
<p>at Champneys-talked to him, sounded him, watching him as I sat</p>
<p>beside him. I could talk to him with extraordinary freedom and a</p>
<p>rare sense of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2833">being</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2834">understood</a>. Other men have to be treated in a</p>
<p>special manner; approached through their own mental dialect,</p>
<p>flattered by a minute regard for what they have said and done.</p>
<p>Evesham was as widely and charitably receptive as any man I have</p>
<p>ever met. The common politicians beside him seemed like rows of</p>
<p>stuffy little rooms looking out upon the sea.</p>
<p>And what was he up to? What did HE <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2835">think</a> we were doing with</p>
<p>Mankind? That I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2836">thought</a> worth <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2837">knowing</a>.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2838">remember</a> his talking on one occasion at the Hartsteins', at a</p>
<p>dinner so tremendously floriferous and equipped that we were almost</p>
<p>forced into duologues, about the possible common constructive</p>
<p>purpose in politics.</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2839">feel</a> so much," he said, "that the best people in every party</p>
<p>converge. We don't differ at Westminster as they do in the country</p>
<p>towns. There's a sort of extending common policy that goes on under</p>
<p>every government, because on the whole it's the right thing to do,</p>
<p>and people <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2840">know</a> it. Things that used to be matters of opinion</p>
<p>become matters of science-and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2841">cease</a> to be party questions."</p>
<p>He instanced education.</p>
<p>"Apart," said I, "from the religious question."</p>
<p>"Apart from the religious question."</p>
<p>He dropped that aspect with an easy grace, and went on with his</p>
<p>general theme that political conflict was the outcome of</p>
<p>uncertainty. "Directly you get a thing established, so that people</p>
<p>can say, 'Now this is Right,' with the same conviction that people</p>
<p>can say water is a combination of oxygen and hydrogen, there's no</p>
<p>more to be said. The thing has to be done…"</p>
<p>And to put against this <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2842">effect</a> of Evesham, broad and humanely</p>
<p>tolerant, posing as the minister of a steadily developing</p>
<p>constructive conviction, there are other <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2843">memories</a>.</p>
<p>Have I not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2844">seen</a> him in the House, persistent, persuasive,</p>
<p>indefatigable, and by all my standards wickedly perverse, leaning</p>
<p>over the table with those insistent movements of his hand upon it,</p>
<p>or swaying forward with a grip upon his coat lapel, fighting with a</p>
<p>diabolical skill to preserve what are in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2845">effect</a> religious tests,</p>
<p>tests he must have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2846">known</a> would outrage and humiliate and injure the</p>
<p>consciences of a quarter-and that perhaps the best quarter-of the</p>
<p>youngsters who come to the work of elementary education?</p>
<p>In playing for points in the game of party advantage Evesham</p>
<p>displayed at times a quite wicked unscrupulousness in the use of his</p>
<p>subtle <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2847">mind</a>. I would sit on the Liberal benches and watch him, and</p>
<p>listen to his urbane voice, fascinated by him. Did he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2848">really</a> care?</p>
<p>Did anything matter to him? And if it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2848">really</a> mattered nothing, why</p>
<p>did he trouble to serve the narrowness and passion of his side? Or</p>
<p>did he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2849">see</a> far beyond my scope, so that this petty iniquity was</p>
<p>justified by greater, remoter ends of which I had no intimation?</p>
<p>They accused him of nepotism. His friends and family were certainly</p>
<p>well cared for. In private life he was full of an affectionate</p>
<p>intimacy; he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2850">pleased</a> by <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2851">being</a> charmed and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2850">pleased</a>. One might <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2852">think</a></p>
<p>at times there was no more of him than a clever man <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2853">happily</a></p>
<p>circumstanced, and finding an interest and occupation in politics.</p>
<p>And then came a glimpse of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2854">thought</a>, of imagination, like the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2855">sight</a></p>
<p>of a soaring eagle through a staircase skylight. Oh, beyond</p>
<p>question he was great! No other contemporary politician had his</p>
<p>quality. In no man have I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2856">perceived</a> so sympathetically the great</p>
<p>contrast between warm, personal things and the white <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2857">dream</a> of</p>
<p>statecraft. Except that he had it seemed no hot passions, but only</p>
<p>interests and fine affections and indolences, he paralleled the</p>
<p>conflict of my life. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2858">saw</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2854">thought</a> widely and deeply; but at</p>
<p>times it seemed to me his greatness stood over and behind the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2859">reality</a> of his life, like some splendid servant, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2860">thinking</a> his own</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2854">thoughts</a>, who waits behind a lesser master's chair…</p>

</title>
<p>Of course, when Evesham talked of this ideal of the organised <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2861">state</a></p>
<p>becoming so finely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2862">true</a> to practicability and so clearly stated as</p>
<p>to have the compelling conviction of physical science, he spoke</p>
<p>quite after my heart. Had he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2863">really</a> embodied the attempt to realise</p>
<p>that, I could have done no more than follow him blindly. But</p>
<p>neither he nor I embodied that, and there lies the gist of my story.</p>
<p>And when it came to a study of others among the leading Tories and</p>
<p>Imperialists the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2864">doubt</a> increased, until with some at last it was</p>
<p>possible to question whether they had any imaginative conception of</p>
<p>constructive statecraft at all; whether they didn't opaquely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2865">accept</a></p>
<p>the world for what it was, and set <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2866">themselves</a> single-mindedly to</p>
<p>make a place for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2866">themselves</a> and cut a figure in it.</p>
<p>There were some very fine personalities among them: there were the</p>
<p>great peers who had administered Egypt, India, South Africa,</p>
<p>Framboya-Cromer, Kitchener, Curzon, Milner, Gane, for example. So</p>
<p>far as that easier task of holding sword and scales had gone, they</p>
<p>had shown the finest qualities, but they had returned to the</p>
<p>perplexing and exacting problem of the home country, a little</p>
<p>glorious, a little too simply bold. They wanted to arm and they</p>
<p>wanted to educate, but the habit of immediate necessity made them</p>
<p>far more eager to arm than to educate, and their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2867">experience</a> of</p>
<p>heterogeneous controls made them overrate the need for obedience in</p>
<p>a homogeneous country. They didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2868">understand</a> raw men, ill-trained</p>
<p>men, uncertain <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2869">minds</a>, and intelligent women; and these are the</p>
<p>things that matter in England… There were also the great</p>
<p>business adventurers, from Cranber to Cossington (who was now Lord</p>
<p>Paddockhurst). My <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2869">mind</a> remained unsettled, and went up and down the</p>
<p>scale between a belief in their far-sighted purpose and the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2870">perception</a> of crude vanities, coarse ambitions, vulgar</p>
<p>competitiveness, and a mere habitual persistence in the pursuit of</p>
<p>gain. For a time I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2871">saw</a> a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2872">good</a> deal of Cossington-I wish I had kept</p>
<p>a diary of his talk and gestures, to mark how he could vary from day</p>
<p>to day between a POSEUR, a smart tradesman, and a very bold and</p>
<p>wide-thinking political schemer. He had a vanity of sweeping</p>
<p>actions, motor car pounces, Napoleonic rushes, that led to violent</p>
<p>ineffectual changes in the policy of his papers, and a haunting</p>
<p>pursuit by parallel columns in the liberal press that never abashed</p>
<p>him in the slightest degree. By an accident I plumbed the folly in</p>
<p>him-but I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2873">feel</a> I never plumbed his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2874">wisdom</a>. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2875">remember</a> him one day</p>
<p>after a lunch at the Barhams' saying suddenly, out of profound</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2876">meditation</a> over the end of a cigar, one of those sentences that seem</p>
<p>to light the whole interior <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2877">being</a> of a man. "Some day," he said</p>
<p>softly, rather to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2878">himself</a> than to me, and A PROPOS of nothing-"some</p>
<p>day I will raise the country."</p>
<p>"Why not?" I said, after a pause, and leant across him for the</p>
<p>little silver spirit-lamp, to light my cigarette…</p>
<p>Then the Tories had for another section the ancient creations, and</p>
<p>again there were the financial peers, men accustomed to reserve, and</p>
<p>their big lawyers, accustomed to-well, qualified statement. And</p>
<p>below the giant personalities of the party were the young bloods,</p>
<p>young, adventurous men of the type of Lord Tarvrille, who had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2879">seen</a></p>
<p>service in South Africa, who had travelled and hunted; explorers,</p>
<p>keen motorists, interested in aviation, active in army organisation.</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2880">Good</a>, brown-faced stuff they were, but impervious to ideas outside</p>
<p>the range of their activities, more ignorant of science than their</p>
<p>chaffeurs, and of the quality of English people than welt-</p>
<p>politicians; contemptuous of school and university by reason of the</p>
<p>Gateses and Flacks and Codgers who had come their way, witty, light-</p>
<p>hearted, patriotic at the Kipling level, with a certain aptitude for</p>
<p>bullying. They varied in insensible gradations between the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2881">noble</a></p>
<p>sportsmen on the one hand, and men like Gane and the Tories of our</p>
<p>Pentagram club on the other. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2882">perceive</a> how a man might exercise</p>
<p>his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2883">mind</a> in the attempt to strike an average of public</p>
<p>serviceability in this miscellany! And mixed up with these, mixed</p>
<p>up sometimes in the same man, was the pure reactionary, whose</p>
<p>predominant idea was that the village schools should confine</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2884">themselves</a> to teaching the catechism, hat-touching and courtesying,</p>
<p>and be given a holiday whenever beaters were in request…</p>
<p>I find now in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2885">mind</a> as a sort of counterpoise to Evesham the</p>
<p>figure of old Lord Wardingham, asleep in the largest armchair in the</p>
<p>library of Stamford Court after lunch. One foot <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2886">rested</a> on one of</p>
<p>those things-I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2887">think</a> they are called gout stools. He had been</p>
<p>playing golf all the morning and wearied a weak instep; at lunch he</p>
<p>had sat at my table and talked in the overbearing manner permitted</p>
<p>to irascible important men whose insteps are <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2888">painful</a>. Among other</p>
<p>things he had flouted the idea that women would ever <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2889">understand</a></p>
<p>statecraft or be more than a nuisance in politics, denied flatly</p>
<p>that Hindoos were capable of anything whatever except excesses in</p>
<p>population, regretted he could not censor picture galleries and</p>
<p>circulating libraries, and declared that dissenters were people who</p>
<p>pretended to take theology seriously with the express purpose of</p>
<p>upsetting the entirely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2890">satisfactory</a> compromise of the Established</p>
<p>Church. "No sensible people, with anything to gain or lose, argue</p>
<p>about religion," he said. "They mean mischief." Having delivered</p>
<p>his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2891">soul</a> upon these points, and silenced the little conversation to</p>
<p>the left of him from which they had arisen, he became, after an</p>
<p>appreciative encounter with a sanguinary woodcock, more amiable,</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2892">responded</a> to some respectful initiatives of Crupp's, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2893">related</a> a</p>
<p>number of classical anecdotes of those blighting snubs, vindictive</p>
<p>retorts and scandalous miscarriages of justice that are so dear to</p>
<p>the forensic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2885">mind</a>. Now he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2894">reposed</a>. He was breathing heavily with</p>
<p>his mouth a little open and his head on one side. One whisker was</p>
<p>turned back against the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2895">comfortable</a> padding. His plump strong hands</p>
<p>gripped the arms of his chair, and his frown was a little assuaged.</p>
<p>How tremendously fed up he looked! Honours, wealth, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2896">influence</a>,</p>
<p>respect, he had them all. How scornful and hard it had made his</p>
<p>unguarded expression!</p>
<p>I note without comment that it didn't even occur to me then to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2897">wake</a></p>
<p>him up and ask him what HE was up to with mankind.</p>

</title>
<p>One countervailing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2898">influence</a> to my drift to Toryism in those days</p>
<p>was Margaret's quite religious <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2899">faith</a> in the Liberals. I realised</p>
<p>that slowly and with a mild astonishment. It set me, indeed, even</p>
<p>then questioning my own change of opinion. We came at last</p>
<p>incidentally, as our way was, to an exchange of views. It was as</p>
<p>nearly a quarrel as we had before I came over to the Conservative</p>
<p>side. It was at Champneys, and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2900">think</a> during the same visit that</p>
<p>witnessed my exploration of Lady Forthundred. It arose indirectly,</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2900">think</a>, out of some comments of mine upon our fellow-guests, but it</p>
<p>is one of those <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2901">memories</a> of which the scene and quality remain more</p>
<p>vivid than the things said, a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2901">memory</a> without any very definite</p>
<p>beginning or end. It was afternoon, in the pause between tea and</p>
<p>the dressing bell, and we were in Margaret's big silver-adorned,</p>
<p>chintz-bright room, looking out on the trim Italian garden…</p>
<p>Yes, the beginning of it has escaped me altogether, but I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2902">remember</a></p>
<p>it as an odd exceptional little wrangle.</p>
<p>At first we seem to have split upon the moral quality of the</p>
<p>aristocracy, and I had an odd sense that in some way too feminine</p>
<p>for me to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2903">understand</a> our hostess had aggrieved her. She said, I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2904">know</a>, that Champneys distressed her; made her "eager for work and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2905">reality</a> again."</p>
<p>"But aren't these people <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2906">real</a>?"</p>
<p>"They're so superficial, so extravagant!"</p>
<p>I said I was not shocked by their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2907">unreality</a>. They seemed the least</p>
<p>affected people I had ever met. "And are they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2908">really</a> so</p>
<p>extravagant?" I asked, and put it to her that her dresses cost quite</p>
<p>as much as any other woman's in the house.</p>
<p>"It's not only their dresses," Margaret parried. "It's the scale</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2909">spirit</a> of things."</p>
<p>I questioned that. "They're cynical," said Margaret, staring before</p>
<p>her out of the window.</p>
<p>I challenged her, and she quoted the Brabants, about whom there had</p>
<p>been an ancient scandal. She'd <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2910">heard</a> of it from Altiora, and it was</p>
<p>also Altiora who'd given her a horror of Lord Carnaby, who was also</p>
<p>with us. "You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2911">know</a> his reputation," said Margaret. "That Normandy</p>
<p>girl. Every one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2912">knows</a> about it. I shiver when I look at him. He</p>
<p>seems-oh! like something not of OUR civilisation. He WILL come and</p>
<p>say little things to me."</p>
<p>"Offensive things?"</p>
<p>"No, politenesses and things. Of course his manners are-quite</p>
<p>right. That only makes it worse, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2913">think</a>. It shows he might have</p>
<p>helped-all that happened. I do all I can to make him <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2914">see</a> I don't</p>
<p>like him. But none of the others make the slightest objection to</p>
<p>him."</p>
<p>"Perhaps these people imagine something might be said for him."</p>
<p>"That's just it," said Margaret.</p>
<p>"Charity," I suggested.</p>
<p>"I don't like that sort of toleration."</p>
<p>I was oddly annoyed. "Like eating with publicans and sinners," I</p>
<p>said. "No!…</p>
<p>But scandals, and the contempt for rigid standards their condonation</p>
<p>displayed, weren't more than the sharp edge of the trouble. "It's</p>
<p>their whole position, their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2915">selfish</a> predominance, their class</p>
<p>conspiracy against the mass of people," said Margaret. "When I sit</p>
<p>at dinner in that splendid room, with its glitter and white</p>
<p>reflections and candlelight, and its flowers and its wonderful</p>
<p>service and its candelabra of solid gold, I seem to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2916">feel</a> the slums</p>
<p>and the mines and the over-crowded cottages stuffed away under the</p>
<p>table."</p>
<p>I reminded Margaret that she was not altogether innocent of unearned</p>
<p>increment.</p>
<p>"But aren't we doing our best to give it back?" she said.</p>
<p>I was moved to question her. "Do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2917">really</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2918">think</a>," I asked, "that</p>
<p>the Tories and peers and rich people are to blame for social</p>
<p>injustice as we have it to-day? Do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2917">really</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2919">see</a> politics as a</p>
<p>struggle of light on the Liberal side against darkness on the Tory?"</p>
<p>"They MUST <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2920">know</a>," said Margaret.</p>
<p>I found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2921">myself</a> questioning that. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2922">see</a> now that to Margaret it must</p>
<p>have seemed the perversest carping against manifest things, but at</p>
<p>the time I was concentrated simply upon the elucidation of her view</p>
<p>and my own; I wanted to get at her conception in the sharpest,</p>
<p>hardest lines that were possible. It was perfectly clear that she</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2923">saw</a> Toryism as the diabolical element in affairs. The thing showed</p>
<p>in its hopeless untruth all the clearer for the fine, clean <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2924">emotion</a></p>
<p>with which she gave it out to me. My sleeping peer in the library</p>
<p>at Stamford Court and Evesham talking luminously behind the</p>
<p>Hartstein flowers embodied the devil, and my replete citizen sucking</p>
<p>at his cigar in the National Liberal Club, Willie Crampton</p>
<p>discussing the care and management of the stomach over a specially</p>
<p>hygienic lemonade, and Dr. Tumpany in his aggressive frock-coat</p>
<p>pegging out a sort of right in Socialism, were the centre and</p>
<p>wings of the angelic side. It was nonsense. But how was I to put</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2925">truth</a> to her?</p>
<p>"I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2926">see</a> things at all as you do," I said. "I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2926">see</a> things</p>
<p>in the same way."</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2927">Think</a> of the poor," said Margaret, going off at a tangent.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2928">Think</a> of every one," I said. "We Liberals have done more mischief</p>
<p>through well-intentioned <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2929">benevolence</a> than all the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2930">selfishness</a> in the</p>
<p>world could have done. We built up the liquor interest."</p>
<p>"WE!" cried Margaret. "How can you say that? It's against us."</p>
<p>"Naturally. But we made it a monopoly in our clumsy efforts to</p>
<p>prevent people drinking what they liked, because it interfered with</p>
<p>industrial regularity-"</p>
<p>"Oh!" cried Margaret, stung; and I could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2931">see</a> she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2932">thought</a> I was</p>
<p>talking mere wickedness.</p>
<p>"That's it," I said.</p>
<p>"But would you have people drink whatever they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2933">pleased</a>?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. What right have I to dictate to other men and women?"</p>
<p>"But <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2934">think</a> of the children!"</p>
<p>"Ah! there you have the folly of modern Liberalism, its half-</p>
<p>cunning, half-silly way of getting at everything in a roundabout</p>
<p>fashion. If neglecting children is an offence, and it IS an</p>
<p>offence, then deal with it as such, but don't go badgering and</p>
<p>restricting people who sell something that may possibly in some</p>
<p>cases lead to a neglect of children. If drunkenness is an offence,</p>
<p>punish it, but don't punish a man for selling honest drink that</p>
<p>perhaps after all won't make any one drunk at all. Don't intensify</p>
<p>the viciousness of the public-house by assuming the place isn't fit</p>
<p>for women and children. That's either spite or folly. Make the</p>
<p>public-house FIT for women and children. Make it a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2935">real</a> public-</p>
<p>house. If we Liberals go on as we are going, we shall presently</p>
<p>want to stop the sale of ink and paper because those things tempt</p>
<p>men to forgery. We do already threaten the privacy of the post</p>
<p>because of betting tout's letters. The drift of all that kind of</p>
<p>thing is narrow, unimaginative, mischievous, stupid…"</p>
<p>I stopped short and walked to the window and surveyed a pretty</p>
<p>fountain, facsimile of one in Verona, amidst trim-cut borderings of</p>
<p>yew. Beyond, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2936">seen</a> between the stems of ilex trees, was a great</p>
<p>blaze of yellow flowers…</p>
<p>"But prevention," I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2937">heard</a> Margaret behind me, "is the essence of our</p>
<p>work."</p>
<p>I turned. "There's no prevention but education. There's no</p>
<p>antiseptics in life but love and fine <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2938">thinking</a>. Make people fine,</p>
<p>make fine people. Don't be afraid. These Tory leaders are better</p>
<p>people individually than the average; why cast them for the villains</p>
<p>of the piece? The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2939">real</a> villain in the piece-in the whole human</p>
<p>drama-is the muddle-headedness, and it matters very little if it's</p>
<p>virtuous-minded or wicked. I want to get at muddle-headedness. If</p>
<p>I could do that I could let all that you call wickedness in the</p>
<p>world run about and do what it jolly well <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2940">pleased</a>. It would matter</p>
<p>about as much as a slightly neglected dog-in an otherwise well-</p>
<p>managed home."</p>
<p>My <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2941">thoughts</a> had run away with me.</p>
<p>"I can't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2942">understand</a> you," said Margaret, in the profoundest</p>
<p>distress. "I can't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2942">understand</a> how it is you are coming to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2943">see</a></p>
<p>things like this."</p>

<p>The moods of a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2944">thinking</a> man in politics are curiously evasive and</p>
<p>difficult to describe. Neither the public nor the historian will</p>
<p>permit the statesman moods. He has from the first to assume he has</p>
<p>an Aim, a definite Aim, and to pretend to an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2945">absolute</a> consistency</p>
<p>with that. Those subtle questionings about the very fundamentals of</p>
<p>life which plague us all so relentlessly nowadays are supposed to be</p>
<p>silenced. He lifts his chin and pursues his Aim explicitly in the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2946">sight</a> of all men. Those who have no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2947">real</a> political <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2948">experience</a> can</p>
<p>scarcely imagine the immense mental and moral strain there is</p>
<p>between one's everyday acts and utterances on the one hand and the</p>
<p>"thinking-out" process on the other. It is perplexingly difficult</p>
<p>to keep in your <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2949">mind</a>, fixed and firm, a scheme essentially complex,</p>
<p>to keep balancing a swaying possibility while at the same time under</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2950">jealous</a>, hostile, and stupid observation you tread your part in the</p>
<p>platitudinous, quarrelsome, ill-presented march of affairs…</p>
<p>The most impossible of all autobiographies is an intellectual</p>
<p>autobiography. I have thrown together in the crudest way the</p>
<p>elements of the problem I struggled with, but I can give no record</p>
<p>of the subtle details; I can tell nothing of the long vacillations</p>
<p>between Protean values, the talks and re-talks, the meditations, the</p>
<p>bleak lucidities of sleepless nights…</p>
<p>And yet these things I have struggled with must be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2951">thought</a> out, and,</p>
<p>to begin with, they must be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2951">thought</a> out in this muddled,</p>
<p>experimenting way. To go into a study to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2952">think</a> about statecraft is</p>
<p>to turn your back on the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2953">realities</a> you are constantly needing to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2954">feel</a> and test and sound if your <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2955">thinking</a> is to remain vital; to</p>
<p>choose an aim and pursue it in despite of all subsequent</p>
<p>questionings is to bury the talent of your <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2956">mind</a>. It is no use</p>
<p>dealing with the intricate as though it were simple, to leap</p>
<p>haphazard at the first course of action that presents itself; the</p>
<p>whole world of politicians is far too like a man who snatches a</p>
<p>poker to a failing watch. It is easy to say he wants to "get</p>
<p>something done," but the only sane thing to do for the moment is to</p>
<p>put aside that poker and take <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2951">thought</a> and get a better implement…</p>
<p>One of the results of these fundamental preoccupations of mine was a</p>
<p>curious irritability towards Margaret that I found difficult to</p>
<p>conceal. It was one of the incidental cruelties of our position</p>
<p>that this should happen. I was in such <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2957">doubt</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2958">myself</a>, that I had no</p>
<p>power to phrase things for her in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2959">form</a> she could use. Hitherto I</p>
<p>had stage-managed our "serious" conversations. Now I was too much</p>
<p>in earnest and too uncertain to go on doing this. I avoided talk</p>
<p>with her. Her serene, sustained confidence in vague formulae and</p>
<p>sentimental aspirations exasperated me; her want of sympathetic</p>
<p>apprehension made my few efforts to indicate my changing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2960">attitudes</a></p>
<p>distressing and futile. It wasn't that I was always <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2961">thinking</a> right,</p>
<p>and that she was always saying wrong. It was that I was struggling</p>
<p>to get hold of a difficult thing that was, at any rate, half <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2962">true</a>, I</p>
<p>could not gauge how <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2962">true</a>, and that Margaret's habitual phrasing</p>
<p>ignored these elusive elements of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2963">truth</a>, and without premeditation</p>
<p>fitted into the weaknesses of my new intimations, as though they had</p>
<p>nothing but weaknesses. It was, for example, obvious that these big</p>
<p>people, who were the backbone of Imperialism and Conservatism, were</p>
<p>temperamentally lax, much more indolent, much more sensuous, than</p>
<p>our deliberately <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2964">virtuous</a> Young Liberals. I didn't want to be</p>
<p>reminded of that, just when I was in full effort to realise the</p>
<p>finer elements in their composition. Margaret classed them and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2965">disposed</a> of them. It was our incurable differences in habits and</p>
<p>gestures of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2966">thought</a> coming between us again.</p>
<p>The desert of misunderstanding widened. I was forced back upon</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2967">myself</a> and my own secret councils. For a time I went my way <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2968">alone</a>;</p>
<p>an unmixed evil for both of us. Except for that Pentagram evening,</p>
<p>a series of talks with Isabel Rivers, who was now becoming more and</p>
<p>more important in my intellectual life, and the arguments I</p>
<p>maintained with Crupp, I never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2969">really</a> opened my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2970">mind</a> at all during</p>
<p>that period of indecisions, slow abandonments, and slow</p>
<p>acquisitions.</p>

<p>SECESSION</p>

<p>1</p>
</title>
<p>At last, out of a vast accumulation of impressions, decision</p>
<p>distilled quite suddenly. I succumbed to Evesham and that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2971">dream</a> of</p>
<p>the right thing triumphant through expression. I determined I would</p>
<p>go over to the Conservatives, and use my every gift and power on the</p>
<p>side of such forces on that side as made for educational</p>
<p>reorganisation, scientific research, literature, criticism, and</p>
<p>intellectual development. That was in 1909. I judged the Tories</p>
<p>were driving straight at a conflict with the country, and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2972">thought</a></p>
<p>them bound to incur an electoral defeat. I under-estimated their</p>
<p>strength in the counties. There would follow, I calculated, a</p>
<p>period of profound reconstruction in method and policy alike. I was</p>
<p>entirely at one with Crupp in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2973">perceiving</a> in this an immense</p>
<p>opportunity for the things we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2974">desired</a>. An aristocracy quickened by</p>
<p>conflict and on the defensive, and full of the idea of justification</p>
<p>by reconstruction, might prove altogether more apt for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2972">thought</a> and</p>
<p>high professions than Mrs. Redmondson's spoilt children. Behind the</p>
<p>now inevitable struggle for a reform of the House of Lords, there</p>
<p>would be great heart searchings and educational endeavour. On that</p>
<p>we reckoned…</p>
<p>At last we talked it out to the practical pitch, and Crupp and</p>
<p>Shoesmith, and I and Gane, made our definite agreement together…</p>
<p>I emerged from enormous silences upon Margaret one evening.</p>
<p>She was just back from the display of some new musicians at the</p>
<p>Hartsteins. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2975">remember</a> she wore a dress of golden satin, very rich-</p>
<p>looking and splendid. About her slender neck there was a rope of</p>
<p>gold-set amber beads. Her hair caught up and echoed and returned</p>
<p>these golden notes. I, too, was in evening dress, but where I had</p>
<p>been escapes me,-some forgotten dinner, I suppose. I went into her</p>
<p>room. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2975">remember</a> I didn't speak for some moments. I went across to</p>
<p>the window and pulled the blind aside, and looked out upon the</p>
<p>railed garden of the square, with its shrubs and shadowed turf</p>
<p>gleaming pallidly and irregularly in the light of the big electric</p>
<p>standard in the corner.</p>
<p>"Margaret," I said, "I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2976">think</a> I shall break with the party."</p>
<p>She made no answer. I turned presently, a movement of enquiry.</p>
<p>"I was afraid you meant to do that," she said.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2977">I'm</a> out of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2978">touch</a>," I explained. "Altogether."</p>
<p>"Oh! I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2979">know</a>."</p>
<p>"It places me in a difficult position," I said.</p>
<p>Margaret stood at her dressing-table, looking steadfastly at <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2980">herself</a></p>
<p>in the glass, and with her fingers playing with a litter of</p>
<p>stoppered bottles of tinted glass. "I was afraid it was coming to</p>
<p>this," she said.</p>
<p>"In a way," I said, "we've been allies. I owe my seat to you. I</p>
<p>couldn't have gone into Parliament…"</p>
<p>"I don't want considerations like that to affect us," she</p>
<p>interrupted.</p>
<p>There was a pause. She sat down in a chair by her dressing-table,</p>
<p>lifted an ivory hand-glass, and put it down again.</p>
<p>"I wish," she said, with something like a sob in her voice, "it were</p>
<p>possible that you shouldn't do this." She stopped abruptly, and I</p>
<p>did not look at her, because I could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2981">feel</a> the effort she was making</p>
<p>to control <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2982">herself</a>.</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2983">thought</a>," she began again, "when you came into Parliament-"</p>
<p>There came another silence. "It's all gone so differently," she</p>
<p>said. "Everything has gone so differently."</p>
<p>I had a sudden <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2984">memory</a> of her, shining triumphant after the</p>
<p>Kinghampstead election, and for the first time I realised just how</p>
<p>perplexing and disappointing my subsequent career must have been to</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2985">I'm</a> not doing this without consideration," I said.</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2986">know</a>," she said, in a voice of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2987">despair</a>, "I've <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2988">seen</a> it coming.</p>
<p>But-I still don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2989">understand</a> it. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2989">understand</a> how you can go</p>
<p>over."</p>
<p>"My ideas have changed and developed," I said.</p>
<p>I walked across to her bearskin hearthrug, and stood by the mantel.</p>
<p>"To <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2990">think</a> that you," she said; "you who might have been leader-"</p>
<p>She could not finish it. "All the forces of reaction," she threw</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>"I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2991">think</a> they are the forces of reaction," I said. "I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2991">think</a> I</p>
<p>can find work to do-better work on that side."</p>
<p>"Against us!" she said. "As if progress wasn't hard enough! As if</p>
<p>it didn't call upon every able man!"</p>
<p>"I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2992">think</a> Liberalism has a monopoly of progress."</p>
<p>She did not answer that. She sat quite still looking in front of</p>
<p>her. "WHY have you gone over?" she asked abruptly as though I had</p>
<p>said nothing.</p>
<p>There came a silence that I was impelled to end. I began a stiff</p>
<p>dissertation from the hearthrug. "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2993">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2994">am</a> going over, because I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2995">think</a></p>
<p>I may join in an intellectual renascence on the Conservative side.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2995">think</a> that in the coming struggle there will be a partial and</p>
<p>altogether <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2996">confused</a> and demoralising victory for democracy, that</p>
<p>will stir the classes which now dominate the Conservative party into</p>
<p>an energetic revival. They will set out to win back, and win back.</p>
<p>Even if my estimate of con-temporary forces is wrong and they win,</p>
<p>they will still be forced to reconstruct their outlook. A war</p>
<p>abroad will supply the chastening if home politics fail. The effort</p>
<p>at renascence is bound to come by either alternative. I believe I</p>
<p>can do more in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2997">relation</a> to that effort than in any other connexion</p>
<p>in the world of politics at the present time. That's my case,</p>
<p>Margaret."</p>
<p>She certainly did not grasp what I said. "And so you will throw</p>
<p>aside all the beginnings, all the beliefs and pledges-" Again her</p>
<p>sentence remained incomplete. "I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2998">doubt</a> if even, once you have gone</p>
<p>over, they will welcome you."</p>
<p>"That hardly matters."</p>
<p>I made an effort to resume my speech.</p>
<p>"I came into Parliament, Margaret," I said, "a little prematurely.</p>
<p>Still-I suppose it was only by coming into Parliament that I could</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2999">see</a> things as I do now in terms of personality and imaginative</p>
<p>range…" I stopped. Her stiff, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3000">unhappy</a>, unlistening silence</p>
<p>broke up my disquisition.</p>
<p>"After all," I remarked, "most of this has been implicit in my</p>
<p>writings."</p>
<p>She made no sign of admission.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Keep my seat for a time and make the reasons of my breach clear.</p>
<p>Then either I must resign or-probably this new Budget will lead to</p>
<p>a General Election. It's evidently meant to strain the Lords and</p>
<p>provoke a quarrel."</p>
<p>"You might, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3001">think</a>, have stayed to fight for the Budget."</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3002">I'm</a> not," I said, "so keen against the Lords."</p>
<p>On that we halted.</p>
<p>"But what are you going to do?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I shall make my quarrel over some points in the Budget. I can't</p>
<p>quite tell you yet where my chance will come. Then I shall either</p>
<p>resign my seat-or if things drift to dissolution I shall stand</p>
<p>again."</p>
<p>"It's political suicide."</p>
<p>"Not altogether."</p>
<p>"I can't imagine you out of Parliament again. It's just like-like</p>
<p>undoing all we have done. What will you do?"</p>
<p>"Write. Make a new, more definite place for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3003">myself</a>. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3004">know</a>, of</p>
<p>course, there's already a sort of group about Crupp and Gane."</p>
<p>Margaret seemed lost for a time in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3005">painful</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3006">thought</a>.</p>
<p>"For me," she said at last, "our political work has been a religion-</p>
<p>it has been more than a religion."</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3007">heard</a> in silence. I had no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3008">form</a> of protest available against the</p>
<p>implications of that.</p>
<p>"And then I find you turning against all we aimed to do-talking of</p>
<p>going over, almost lightly-to those others."…</p>
<p>She was white-lipped as she spoke. In the most curious way she had</p>
<p>captured the moral values of the situation. I found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3009">myself</a></p>
<p>protesting ineffectually against her fixed conviction. "It's</p>
<p>because I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3010">think</a> my duty lies in this change that I make it," I said.</p>
<p>"I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3011">see</a> how you can say that," she replied <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3012">quietly</a>.</p>
<p>There was another pause between us.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she said and clenched her hand upon the table. "That it</p>
<p>should have come to this!"</p>
<p>She was extraordinarily dignified and extraordinarily absurd. She</p>
<p>was hurt and thwarted beyond measure. She had no place in her</p>
<p>ideas, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3013">thought</a>, for me. I could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3014">see</a> how it appeared to her, but I</p>
<p>could not make her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3014">see</a> anything of the intricate process that had</p>
<p>brought me to this divergence. The opposition of our intellectual</p>
<p>temperaments was like a gag in my mouth. What was there for me to</p>
<p>say? A flash of intuition told me that behind her white dignity was</p>
<p>a passionate disappointment, a shattering of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3015">dreams</a> that needed</p>
<p>before everything else the relief of weeping.</p>
<p>"I've told you," I said awkwardly, "as soon as I could."</p>
<p>There was another long silence. "So that is how we stand," I said</p>
<p>with an air of having things defined. I walked slowly to the door.</p>
<p>She had risen and stood now staring in front of her.</p>
<p>"Good-night," I said, making no movement towards our habitual kiss.</p>
<p>"Good-night," she answered in a tragic note…</p>
<p>I closed the door softly. I remained for a moment or so on the big</p>
<p>landing, hesitating between my bedroom and my study. As I did so I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3016">heard</a> the soft rustle of her movement and the click of the key in</p>
<p>her bedroom door. Then everything was still…</p>
<p>She hid her tears from me. Something gripped my heart at the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3017">thought</a>.</p>
<p>"Damnation!" I said wincing. "Why the devil can't people at least</p>
<p>THINK in the same manner?"</p>

<p>And that insufficient colloquy was the beginning of a prolonged</p>
<p>estrangement between us. It was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3018">characteristic</a> of our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3019">relations</a></p>
<p>that we never reopened the discussion. The thing had been in the</p>
<p>air for some time; we had recognised it now; the widening breach</p>
<p>between us was confessed. My own <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3020">feelings</a> were curiously divided.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that my very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3021">real</a> affection for Margaret only</p>
<p>became evident to me with this quarrel. The changes of the heart</p>
<p>are very subtle changes. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3022">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3023">am</a> quite unaware how or when my early</p>
<p>romantic love for her purity and beauty and high-principled devotion</p>
<p>evaporated from my life; but I do <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3024">know</a> that quite early in my</p>
<p>parliamentary days there had come a vague, unconfessed resentment at</p>
<p>the tie that seemed to hold me in servitude to her standards of</p>
<p>private living and public act. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3025">felt</a> I was caught, and none the</p>
<p>less so because it had been my own act to rivet on my shackles. So</p>
<p>long as I still held <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3026">myself</a> bound to her that resentment <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3027">grew</a>. Now,</p>
<p>since I had broken my bonds and taken my line it withered again, and</p>
<p>I could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3028">think</a> of Margaret with a returning kindliness.</p>
<p>But I still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3029">felt</a> embarrassment with her. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3029">felt</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3030">myself</a> dependent</p>
<p>upon her for house room and food and social support, as it were</p>
<p>under false pretences. I would have liked to have separated our</p>
<p>financial affairs altogether. But I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3031">knew</a> that to raise the issue</p>
<p>would have seemed a last brutal indelicacy. So I tried almost</p>
<p>furtively to keep my personal expenditure within the scope of the</p>
<p>private income I made by writing, and we went out together in her</p>
<p>motor brougham, dined and made appearances, met politely at</p>
<p>breakfast-parted at night with a kiss upon her cheek. The locking</p>
<p>of her door upon me, which at that time I quite <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3032">understood</a>, which I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3033">understand</a> now, became for a time in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3034">mind</a>, through some obscure</p>
<p>process of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3035">soul</a>, an offence. I never crossed the landing to her</p>
<p>room again.</p>
<p>In all this matter, and, indeed, in all my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3036">relations</a> with Margaret,</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3037">perceive</a> now I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3038">behaved</a> badly and foolishly. My manifest blunder</p>
<p>is that I, who was several years older than she, much subtler and in</p>
<p>many ways <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3039">wiser</a>, never in any measure sought to guide and control</p>
<p>her. After our marriage I treated her always as an equal, and let</p>
<p>her go her way; held her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3040">responsible</a> for all the weak and</p>
<p>ineffective and unfortunate things she said and did to me. She</p>
<p>wasn't clever enough to justify that. It wasn't fair to expect her</p>
<p>to sympathise, anticipate, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3041">understand</a>. I ought to have taken</p>
<p>care of her, roped her to me when it came to crossing the difficult</p>
<p>places. If I had loved her more, and wiselier and more tenderly, if</p>
<p>there had not been the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3042">consciousness</a> of my financial dependence on</p>
<p>her always stiffening my pride, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3043">think</a> she would have moved with me</p>
<p>from the outset, and left the Liberals with me. But she did not get</p>
<p>any inkling of the ends I sought in my change of sides. It must</p>
<p>have seemed to her inexplicable perversity. She had, I knew-for</p>
<p>surely I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3044">knew</a> it then-an immense capacity for loyalty and devotion.</p>
<p>There she was with these treasures untouched, neglected and</p>
<p>perplexed. A woman who loves wants to give. It is the duty and</p>
<p>business of the man she has married for love to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3045">help</a> her to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3045">help</a> and</p>
<p>give. But I was stupid. My eyes had never been opened. I was</p>
<p>stiff with her and difficult to her, because even on my wedding</p>
<p>morning there had been, deep down in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3046">soul</a>, voiceless though</p>
<p>present, something weakly protesting, a faint <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3047">perception</a> of wrong-</p>
<p>doing, the infinitesimally small, slow-multiplying germs of shame.</p>

<p>I made my breach with the party on the Budget.</p>
<p>In many ways I was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3048">disposed</a> to regard the 1909 Budget as a fine</p>
<p>piece of statecraft. Its production was certainly a very unexpected</p>
<p>display of vigour on the Liberal side. But, on the whole, this</p>
<p>movement towards collectivist organisation on the part of the</p>
<p>Liberals rather strengthened than weakened my resolve to cross the</p>
<p>floor of the house. It made it more necessary, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3049">thought</a>, to leaven</p>
<p>the purely obstructive and reactionary elements that were at once</p>
<p>manifest in the opposition. I assailed the land taxation proposals</p>
<p>in one main speech, and a series of minor speeches in committee.</p>
<p>The line of attack I chose was that the land was a great public</p>
<p>service that needed to be controlled on broad and far-sighted lines.</p>
<p>I had no objection to its nationalisation, but I did <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3050">object</a> most</p>
<p>strenuously to the idea of leaving it in private hands, and</p>
<p>attempting to produce beneficial social results through the pressure</p>
<p>of taxation upon the land-owning class. That might break it up in</p>
<p>an utterly disastrous way. The drift of the government proposals</p>
<p>was all in the direction of sweating the landowner to get immediate</p>
<p>values from his property, and such a course of action was bound to</p>
<p>give us an irritated and vindictive land-owning class, the class</p>
<p>upon which we had hitherto relied-not unjustifiably-for certain</p>
<p>broad, patriotic services and an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3051">influence</a> upon our collective</p>
<p>judgments that no other class seemed prepared to exercise. Abolish</p>
<p>landlordism if you will, I said, buy it out, but do not drive it to</p>
<p>a defensive fight, and leave it still sufficiently strong and</p>
<p>wealthy to become a malcontent element in your <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3052">state</a>. You have</p>
<p>taxed and controlled the brewer and the publican until the outraged</p>
<p>Liquor Interest has become a national danger. You now propose to do</p>
<p>the same thing on a larger scale. You turn a class which has many</p>
<p>fine and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3053">truly</a> aristocratic traditions towards revolt, and there is</p>
<p>nothing in these or any other of your proposals that shows any sense</p>
<p>of the need for leadership to replace these traditional leaders you</p>
<p>are ousting. This was the substance of my case, and I hammered at</p>
<p>it not only in the House, but in the press…</p>
<p>The Kinghampstead division remained for some time insensitive to my</p>
<p>defection.</p>
<p>Then it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3054">woke</a> up suddenly, and began, in the columns of the</p>
<p>KINGSHAMPSTEAD GUARDIAN, an indignant, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3055">confused</a> outcry. I was</p>
<p>treated to an open letter, signed Junius Secundus," and I replied in</p>
<p>provocative terms. There were two thinly attended public meetings</p>
<p>at different ends of the constituency, and then I had a</p>
<p>correspondence with my old friend Parvill, the photographer, which</p>
<p>ended in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3056">seeing</a> a deputation.</p>
<p>My impression is that it consisted of about eighteen or twenty</p>
<p>people. They had had to come upstairs to me and they were</p>
<p>manifestly full of indignation and a little short of breath. There</p>
<p>was Parvill <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3057">himself</a>, J.P., dressed wholly in black-I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3058">think</a> to mark</p>
<p>his sense of the occasion-and curiously suggestive in his respect</p>
<p>for my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3059">character</a> and his concern for the honourableness of the</p>
<p>KINGHAMPSTEAD GUARDIAN editor, of Mark Antony at the funeral of</p>
<p>Cesar. There was Mrs. Bulger, also in mourning; she had never</p>
<p>abandoned the widow's streamers since the death of her husband ten</p>
<p>years ago, and her loyalty to Liberalism of the severest type was</p>
<p>part as it were of her weeds. There was a nephew of Sir Roderick</p>
<p>Newton, a bright young Hebrew of the graver type, and a couple of</p>
<p>dissenting ministers in high collars and hats that stopped halfway</p>
<p>between the bowler of this world and the shovel-hat of heaven.</p>
<p>There was also a young solicitor from Lurky done in the horsey</p>
<p>style, and there was a very little nervous man with a high brow and</p>
<p>a face contracting below as though the jawbones and teeth had been</p>
<p>taken out and the features compressed. The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3060">rest</a> of the deputation,</p>
<p>which included two other public-spirited ladies and several</p>
<p>ministers of religion, might have been raked out of any omnibus</p>
<p>going Strandward during the May meetings. They thrust Parvill</p>
<p>forward as spokesman, and manifested a strong <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3061">disposition</a> to say</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3062">Hear</a>, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3062">hear</a>!" to his more strenuous protests provided my eye wasn't</p>
<p>upon them at the time.</p>
<p>I regarded this appalling deputation as Parvill's apologetic but</p>
<p>quite definite utterances drew to an end. I had a moment of vision.</p>
<p>Behind them I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3063">saw</a> the wonderful array of skeleton forces that stand</p>
<p>for public opinion, that are as much public opinion as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3064">exists</a> indeed</p>
<p>at the present time. The whole process of politics which bulks so</p>
<p>solidly in history seemed for that clairvoyant instant but a froth</p>
<p>of petty motives above abysms of indifference…</p>
<p>Some one had finished. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3065">perceived</a> I had to speak.</p>
<p>"Very well," I said, "I won't keep you long in replying. I'll</p>
<p>resign if there isn't a dissolution before next February, and if</p>
<p>there is I shan't stand again. You don't want the bother and</p>
<p>expense of a bye-election (approving murmurs) if it can be avoided.</p>
<p>But I may tell you plainly now that I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3066">think</a> it will be</p>
<p>necessary for me to resign, and the sooner you find my successor the</p>
<p>better for the party. The Lords are in a corner; they've got to</p>
<p>fight now or never, and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3066">think</a> they will throw out the Budget.</p>
<p>Then they will go on fighting. It is a fight that will last for</p>
<p>years. They have a sort of social discipline, and you haven't. You</p>
<p>Liberals will find <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3067">yourselves</a> with a country behind you, vaguely</p>
<p>indignant perhaps, but totally unprepared with any ideas whatever in</p>
<p>the matter, face to face with the problem of bringing the British</p>
<p>constitution up-to-date. Anything may happen, provided only that it</p>
<p>is sufficiently absurd. If the King backs the Lords-and I don't</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3068">see</a> why he shouldn't-you have no Republican movement whatever to</p>
<p>fall back upon. You lost it during the Era of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3069">Good</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3070">Taste</a>. The</p>
<p>country, I say, is destitute of ideas, and you have no ideas to give</p>
<p>it. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3068">see</a> what you will do… For my own part, I mean to</p>
<p>spend a year or so between a window and my writingdesk."</p>
<p>I paused. "I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3071">think</a>, gentlemen," began Parvill, "that we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3072">hear</a> all</p>
<p>this with very great regret…"</p>

<p>My estrangement from Margaret stands in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3073">memory</a> now as something</p>
<p>that played itself out within the four walls of our house in Radnor</p>
<p>Square, which was, indeed, confined to those <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3074">limits</a>. I went to and</p>
<p>fro between my house and the House of Commons, and the dining-rooms</p>
<p>and clubs and offices in which we were preparing our new</p>
<p>developments, in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3075">state</a> of aggressive and energetic dissociation,</p>
<p>in the nascent <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3075">state</a>, as a chemist would say. I was free now, and</p>
<p>greedy for fresh combination. I had a tremendous sense of released</p>
<p>energies. I had got back to the sort of thing I could do, and to</p>
<p>the work that had been shaping itself for so long in my imagination.</p>
<p>Our purpose now was plain, bold, and extraordinarily congenial. We</p>
<p>meant no less than to organise a new movement in English <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3076">thought</a> and</p>
<p>life, to resuscitate a Public Opinion and prepare the ground for a</p>
<p>revised and renovated ruling culture.</p>
<p>For a time I seemed quite wonderfully able to do whatever I wanted</p>
<p>to do. Shoesmith <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3077">responded</a> to my first advances. We decided to</p>
<p>create a weekly paper as our nucleus, and Crupp and I set to work</p>
<p>forthwith to collect a group of writers and speakers, including</p>
<p>Esmeer, Britten, Lord Gane, Neal, and one or two younger men, which</p>
<p>should constitute a more or less definite editorial council about</p>
<p>me, and meet at a weekly lunch on Tuesday to sustain our general co-</p>
<p>operations. We marked our claim upon Toryism even in the colour of</p>
<p>our wrapper, and spoke of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3078">ourselves</a> collectively as the Blue</p>
<p>Weeklies. But our lunches were open to all sorts of guests, and our</p>
<p>deliberations were never of a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3079">character</a> to control me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3080">effectively</a> in</p>
<p>my editorial decisions. My only <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3081">influential</a> councillor at first was</p>
<p>old Britten, who became my sub-editor. It was curious how we two</p>
<p>had picked up our ancient intimacy again and resumed the easy give</p>
<p>and take of our speculative <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3082">dreaming</a> schoolboy days.</p>
<p>For a time my life centred altogether upon this journalistic work.</p>
<p>Britten was an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3083">experienced</a> journalist, and I had most of the</p>
<p>necessary instincts for the business. We meant to make the paper</p>
<p>right and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3084">good</a> down to the smallest detail, and we set <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3085">ourselves</a> at</p>
<p>this with extraordinary zeal. It wasn't our intention to show our</p>
<p>political motives too markedly at first, and through all the dust</p>
<p>storm and tumult and stress of the political struggle of 1910, we</p>
<p>made a little intellectual oasis of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3084">good</a> art criticism and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3084">good</a></p>
<p>writing. It was the firm belief of nearly all of us that the Lords</p>
<p>were destined to be beaten badly in 1910, and our game was the</p>
<p>longer game of reconstruction that would begin when the shouting and</p>
<p>tumult of that immediate conflict were over. Meanwhile we had to</p>
<p>get into <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3086">touch</a> with just as many <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3084">good</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3087">minds</a> as possible.</p>
<p>As we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3088">felt</a> our feet, I developed slowly and carefully a broadly</p>
<p>conceived and consistent political <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3089">attitude</a>. As I will explain</p>
<p>later, we were feminist from the outset, though that caused</p>
<p>Shoesmith and Gane great searching of heart; we developed Esmeer's</p>
<p>House of Lords reform scheme into a general cult of the aristocratic</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3090">virtues</a>, and we did much to humanise and liberalise the narrow</p>
<p>excellencies of that Break-up of the Poor Law agitation, which had</p>
<p>been organised originally by Beatrice and Sidney Webb. In addition,</p>
<p>without any very definite explanation to any one but Esmeer and</p>
<p>Isabel Rivers, and as if it was quite a small matter, I set <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3091">myself</a></p>
<p>to secure a uniform philosophical quality in our columns.</p>
<p>That, indeed, was the peculiar <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3092">virtue</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3093">characteristic</a> of the BLUE</p>
<p>WEEKLY. I was now very definitely convinced that much of the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3094">confusion</a> and futility of contemporary <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3095">thought</a> was due to the</p>
<p>general need of metaphysical training… The great mass of</p>
<p>people-and not simply common people, but people active and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3096">influential</a> in intellectual things-are still quite untrained in the</p>
<p>methods of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3095">thought</a> and absolutely innocent of any criticism of</p>
<p>method; it is scarcely a caricature to call their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3097">thinking</a> a crazy</p>
<p>patchwork, discontinuous and chaotic. They arrive at conclusions by</p>
<p>a kind of accident, and do not suspect any other way may be found to</p>
<p>their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3098">attainment</a>. A stage above this general <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3099">condition</a> stands that</p>
<p>minority of people who have at some time or other discovered general</p>
<p>terms and a certain use for generalisations. They are-to fall back</p>
<p>on the ancient technicality-Realists of a crude sort. When I say</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3100">Realist</a> of course I mean <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3100">Realist</a> as opposed to Nominalist, and not</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3100">Realist</a> in the almost diametrically different sense of opposition to</p>
<p>Idealist. Such are the Baileys; such, to take their great</p>
<p>prototype, was Herbert Spencer (who couldn't read Kant); such are</p>
<p>whole regiments of prominent and entirely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3101">self-satisfied</a></p>
<p>contemporaries. They go through queer little processes of</p>
<p>definition and generalisation and deduction with the completest</p>
<p>belief in the validity of the intellectual instrument they are</p>
<p>using. They are Realists-Cocksurists-in matter of fact;</p>
<p>sentimentalists in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3102">behaviour</a>. The Baileys having got to this</p>
<p>glorious stage in mental development-it is glorious because it has</p>
<p>no doubts-were always talking about training "Experts" to apply the</p>
<p>same simple process to all the affairs of mankind. Well, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3103">Realism</a></p>
<p>isn't the last word of human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3104">wisdom</a>. Modest-minded people, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3105">doubtful</a></p>
<p>people, subtle people, and the like-the kind of people William</p>
<p>James writes of as "tough-minded," go on beyond this methodical</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3106">happiness</a>, and are forever after critical of premises and terms.</p>
<p>They are truer-and less confident. They have reached scepticism</p>
<p>and the artistic method. They have emerged into the new Nominalism.</p>
<p>Both Isabel and I believe firmly that these differences of</p>
<p>intellectual method matter profoundly in the affairs of mankind,</p>
<p>that the collective <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3107">mind</a> of this intricate complex modern <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3108">state</a> can</p>
<p>only function properly upon neo-Nominalist lines. This has always</p>
<p>been her side of our mental co-operation rather than mine. Her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3107">mind</a></p>
<p>has the light movement that goes so often with natural mental power;</p>
<p>she has a wonderful art in illustration, and, as the reader probably</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3109">knows</a> already, she writes of metaphysical matters with a rare charm</p>
<p>and vividness. So far there has been no collection of her papers</p>
<p>published, but they are to be found not only in the BLUE WEEKLY</p>
<p>columns but scattered about the monthlies; many people must be</p>
<p>familiar with her style. It was an intention we did much to realise</p>
<p>before our private downfall, that we would use the BLUE WEEKLY to</p>
<p>maintain a stream of suggestion against crude <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3110">thinking</a>, and at last</p>
<p>scarcely a week passed but some popular distinction, some large</p>
<p>imposing generalisation, was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3111">touched</a> to flaccidity by her pen or</p>
<p>mine…</p>
<p>I was at great <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3112">pains</a> to give my philosophical, political, and social</p>
<p>matter the best literary and critical backing we could get in</p>
<p>London. I hunted sedulously for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3113">good</a> descriptive writing and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3113">good</a></p>
<p>criticism; I was indefatigable in my readiness to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3114">hear</a> and consider,</p>
<p>if not to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3115">accept</a> advice; I watched every corner of the paper, and</p>
<p>had a dozen men alert to get me special matter of the sort that</p>
<p>draws in the unattached reader. The chief danger on the literary</p>
<p>side of a weekly is that it should fall into the hands of some</p>
<p>particular school, and this I watched for closely. It seems</p>
<p>impossible to get vividness of apprehension and breadth of view</p>
<p>together in the same critic. So it falls to the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3116">wise</a> editor to</p>
<p>secure the first and impose the second. Directly I detected the</p>
<p>shrill partisan note in our criticism, the attempt to puff a poor</p>
<p>thing because it was "in the right direction," or damn a vigorous</p>
<p>piece of work because it wasn't, I tackled the man and had it out</p>
<p>with him. Our pay was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3113">good</a> enough for that to matter a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3113">good</a> deal…</p>
<p>Our distinctive little blue and white poster kept up its neat</p>
<p>persistent appeal to the public eye, and before 1911 was out, the</p>
<p>BLUE WEEKLY was printing twenty pages of publishers' advertisements,</p>
<p>and went into all the clubs in London and three-quarters of the</p>
<p>country houses where week-end parties gather together. Its sale by</p>
<p>newsagents and bookstalls <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3117">grew</a> steadily. One got more and more the</p>
<p>reassuring sense of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3118">being</a> discussed, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3119">influencing</a> discussion.</p>

<p>Our office was at the very top of a big building near the end of</p>
<p>Adelphi Terrace; the main window beside my desk, a big undivided</p>
<p>window of plate glass, looked out upon Cleopatra's Needle, the</p>
<p>corner of the Hotel Cecil, the fine arches of Waterloo Bridge, and</p>
<p>the long sweep of south bank with its shot towers and chimneys, past</p>
<p>Bankside to the dimly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3120">seen</a> piers of the great bridge below the</p>
<p>Tower. The dome of St. Paul's just floated into view on the left</p>
<p>against the hotel facade. By night and day, in every light and</p>
<p>atmosphere, it was a beautiful and various view, alive as a</p>
<p>throbbing heart; a perpetual flow of traffic ploughed and splashed</p>
<p>the streaming silver of the river, and by night the shapes of things</p>
<p>became velvet black and grey, and the water a shining mirror of</p>
<p>steel, wearing coruscating gems of light. In the foreground the</p>
<p>Embankment trams sailed glowing by, across the water advertisements</p>
<p>flashed and flickered, trains went and came and a rolling drift of</p>
<p>smoke reflected unseen fires. By day that spectacle was sometimes a</p>
<p>marvel of shining wet and wind-cleared atmosphere, sometimes a</p>
<p>mystery of drifting fog, sometimes a miracle of crowded details,</p>
<p>minutely fine.</p>
<p>As I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3121">think</a> of that view, so variously spacious in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3122">effect</a>, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3123">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3124">am</a> back</p>
<p>there, and this sunlit paper might be lamp-lit and lying on my old</p>
<p>desk. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3125">see</a> it all again, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3126">feel</a> it all again. In the foreground is</p>
<p>a green shaded lamp and crumpled galley slips and paged proofs and</p>
<p>letters, two or three papers in manuscript, and so forth. In the</p>
<p>shadows are chairs and another table bearing papers and books, a</p>
<p>rotating bookcase dimly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3127">seen</a>, a long window seat black in the</p>
<p>darkness, and then the cool unbroken spectacle of the window. How</p>
<p>often I would watch some tram-car, some string of barges go from me</p>
<p>slowly out of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3128">sight</a>. The people were black animalculae by day,</p>
<p>clustering, collecting, dispersing, by night, they were phantom</p>
<p>face-specks coming, vanishing, stirring obscurely between light and</p>
<p>shade.</p>
<p>I recall many hours at my desk in that room before the crisis came,</p>
<p>hours full of the peculiar <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3129">happiness</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3130">effective</a> strenuous work.</p>
<p>Once some piece of writing went on, holding me intent and forgetful</p>
<p>of time until I looked up from the warm circle of my electric lamp</p>
<p>to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3131">see</a> the eastward sky above the pale silhouette of the Tower</p>
<p>Bridge, flushed and banded brightly with the dawn.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>THE BESETTING OF SEX</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>1</p>
</title>
<p>Art is selection and so is most autobiography. But <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3132">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3133">am</a> concerned</p>
<p>with a more tangled business than selection, I want to show a</p>
<p>contemporary man in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3134">relation</a> to the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3135">state</a> and social usage, and the</p>
<p>social organism in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3134">relation</a> to that man. To tell my story at all I</p>
<p>have to simplify. I have given now the broad lines of my political</p>
<p>development, and how I passed from my initial liberal-socialism to</p>
<p>the conception of a constructive aristocracy. I have tried to set</p>
<p>that out in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3136">form</a> of a man discovering <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3137">himself</a>. Incidentally</p>
<p>that self-development led to a profound breach with my wife. One</p>
<p>has read stories before of husband and wife speaking severally two</p>
<p>different languages and coming to an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3138">understanding</a>. But Margaret</p>
<p>and I began in her dialect, and, as I came more and more to use my</p>
<p>own, diverged.</p>
<p>I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3139">thought</a> when I married that the matter of womankind had ended</p>
<p>for me. I have tried to tell all that sex and women had been to me</p>
<p>up to my married life with Margaret and our fatal entanglement,</p>
<p>tried to show the queer, crippled, embarrassed and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3140">limited</a> way in</p>
<p>which these interests break upon the life of a young man under</p>
<p>contemporary <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3141">conditions</a>. I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3142">think</a> my lot was a very</p>
<p>exceptional one. I missed the chance of sisters and girl playmates,</p>
<p>but that is not an uncommon misadventure in an age of small</p>
<p>families; I never came to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3143">know</a> any woman at all intimately until I</p>
<p>was married to Margaret. My earlier love affairs were encounters of</p>
<p>sex, under <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3141">conditions</a> of furtiveness and adventure that made them</p>
<p>things in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3144">themselves</a>, restricted and unilluminating. From a boyish</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3145">disposition</a> to be mystical and worshipping towards women I had</p>
<p>passed into a disregardful <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3146">attitude</a>, as though women were things</p>
<p>inferior or irrelevant, disturbers in great affairs. For a time</p>
<p>Margaret had blotted out all other women; she was so different and</p>
<p>so near; she was like a person who stands suddenly in front of a</p>
<p>little window through which one has been surveying a crowd. She</p>
<p>didn't become womankind for me so much as eliminate womankind from</p>
<p>my world… And then came this secret separation…</p>
<p>Until this estrangement and the rapid and uncontrollable development</p>
<p>of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3147">relations</a> with Isabel which chanced to follow it, I seemed to</p>
<p>have solved the problem of women by marriage and disregard. I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3148">thought</a> these things were over. I went about my career with</p>
<p>Margaret beside me, her brow slightly knit, her manner faintly</p>
<p>strenuous, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3149">helping</a>, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3149">helping</a>; and if we had not altogether abolished</p>
<p>sex we had at least so circumscribed and isolated it that it would</p>
<p>not have affected the general tenor of our lives in the slightest</p>
<p>degree if we had.</p>
<p>And then, clothing itself more and more in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3150">form</a> of Isabel and</p>
<p>her problems, this old, this fundamental obsession of my life</p>
<p>returned. The thing stole upon my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3151">mind</a> so that I was unaware of its</p>
<p>invasion and how it was changing our long intimacy. I have already</p>
<p>compared the lot of the modern publicist to Machiavelli writing in</p>
<p>his study; in his day women and sex were as disregarded in these</p>
<p>high affairs as, let us say, the chemistry of air or the will of the</p>
<p>beasts in the fields; in ours the case has altogether changed, and</p>
<p>woman has come now to stand beside the tall candles, half in the</p>
<p>light, half in the mystery of the shadows, besetting, interrupting,</p>
<p>demanding unrelentingly an altogether unprecedented attention. I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3152">feel</a> that in these matters my life has been almost typical of my</p>
<p>time. Woman insists upon her presence. She is no longer a mere</p>
<p>physical need, an aesthetic bye-play, a sentimental background; she</p>
<p>is a moral and intellectual necessity in a man's life. She comes to</p>
<p>the politician and demands, Is she a child or a citizen? Is she a</p>
<p>thing or a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3153">soul</a>? She comes to the individual man, as she came to me</p>
<p>and asks, Is she a cherished weakling or an equal mate, an</p>
<p>unavoidable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3154">helper</a>? Is she to be tried and trusted or guarded and</p>
<p>controlled, bond or free? For if she is a mate, one must at once</p>
<p>trust more and exact more, exacting toil, courage, and the hardest,</p>
<p>most necessary thing of all, the clearest, most shameless,</p>
<p>explicitness of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3155">understanding</a>…</p>

</title>
<p>In all my earlier imaginings of statecraft I had tacitly assumed</p>
<p>either that the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3156">relations</a> of the sexes were all right or that anyhow</p>
<p>they didn't concern the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3157">state</a>. It was a matter they, whoever "they"</p>
<p>were, had to settle among <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3158">themselves</a>. That sort of disregard was</p>
<p>possible then. But even before 1906 there were endless intimations</p>
<p>that the dams holding back great reservoirs of discussion were</p>
<p>crumbling. We political schemers were ploughing wider than any one</p>
<p>had ploughed before in the field of social reconstruction. We had</p>
<p>also, we realised, to plough deeper. We had to plough down at last</p>
<p>to the passionate elements of sexual <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3156">relationship</a> and examine and</p>
<p>decide upon them.</p>
<p>The signs multiplied. In a year or so half the police of the</p>
<p>metropolis were scarce sufficient to protect the House from one</p>
<p>clamorous aspect of the new problem. The members went about</p>
<p>Westminster with an odd, new sense of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3159">being</a> beset. A <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3160">good</a></p>
<p>proportion of us kept up the pretence that the Vote for Women was an</p>
<p>isolated fad, and the agitation an epidemic madness that would</p>
<p>presently pass. But it was manifest to any one who sought more than</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3161">comfort</a> in the matter that the streams of women and sympathisers and</p>
<p>money forthcoming marked far deeper and wider things than an idle</p>
<p>fancy for the franchise. The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3162">existing</a> laws and conventions of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3163">relationship</a> between Man and Woman were just as unsatisfactory a</p>
<p>disorder as anything else in our tumbled <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3164">confusion</a> of a world, and</p>
<p>that also was coming to bear upon statecraft.</p>
<p>My first parliament was the parliament of the Suffragettes. I don't</p>
<p>propose to tell here of that amazing campaign, with its absurdities</p>
<p>and follies, its courage and devotion. There were aspects of that</p>
<p>unquenchable agitation that were absolutely heroic and aspects that</p>
<p>were absolutely pitiful. It was unreasonable, unwise, and, except</p>
<p>for its one central insistence, astonishingly incoherent. It was</p>
<p>amazingly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3165">effective</a>. The very incoherence of the demand witnessed,</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3166">think</a>, to the forces that lay behind it. It wasn't a simple</p>
<p>argument based on a simple assumption; it was the first crude</p>
<p>expression of a great mass and mingling of convergent <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3167">feelings</a>, of a</p>
<p>widespread, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3168">confused</a> persuasion among modern educated women that the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3169">conditions</a> of their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3170">relations</a> with men were oppressive, ugly,</p>
<p>dishonouring, and had to be altered. They had not merely adopted</p>
<p>the Vote as a symbol of equality; it was fairly manifest to me that,</p>
<p>given it, they meant to use it, and to use it perhaps even</p>
<p>vindictively and blindly, as a weapon against many things they had</p>
<p>every reason to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3171">hate</a>…</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3172">remember</a>, with exceptional vividness, that great night early in</p>
<p>the session of 1909, when-I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3173">think</a> it was-fifty or sixty women went</p>
<p>to prison. I had been dining at the Barham's, and Lord Barham and I</p>
<p>came down from the direction of St. James's Park into a crowd and a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3174">confusion</a> outside the Caxton Hall. We found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3175">ourselves</a> drifting with</p>
<p>an immense multitude towards Parliament Square and parallel with a</p>
<p>silent, close-packed column of girls and women, for the most part</p>
<p>white-faced and intent. I still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3172">remember</a> the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3176">effect</a> of their faces</p>
<p>upon me. It was quite different from the general <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3176">effect</a> of staring</p>
<p>about and divided attention one gets in a political procession of</p>
<p>men. There was an expression of heroic tension.</p>
<p>There had been a pretty deliberate appeal on the part of the women's</p>
<p>organisers to the Unemployed, who had been demonstrating throughout</p>
<p>that winter, to join forces with the movement, and the result was</p>
<p>shown in the quality of the crowd upon the pavement. It was an</p>
<p>ugly, dangerous-looking crowd, but as yet <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3177">good-tempered</a> and</p>
<p>sympathetic. When at last we got within <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3178">sight</a> of the House the</p>
<p>square was a seething seat of excited people, and the array of</p>
<p>police on horse and on foot might have been assembled for a</p>
<p>revolutionary outbreak. There were dense masses of people up</p>
<p>Whitehall, and right on to Westminster Bridge. The scuffle that</p>
<p>ended in the arrests was the poorest explosion to follow such</p>
<p>stupendous preparations…</p>

<p>Later on in that year the women began a new attack. Day and night,</p>
<p>and all through the long nights of the Budget sittings, at all the</p>
<p>piers of the gates of New Palace Yard and at St. Stephen's Porch,</p>
<p>stood women pickets, and watched us silently and reproachfully as we</p>
<p>went to and fro. They were women of all sorts, though, of course,</p>
<p>the independent worker-class predominated. There were grey-headed</p>
<p>old ladies standing there, sturdily charming in the rain; battered-</p>
<p>looking, ambiguous women, with something of the desperate <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3179">bitterness</a></p>
<p>of battered women showing in their eyes; north-country factory</p>
<p>girls; cheaply-dressed suburban women; trim, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3180">comfortable</a> mothers of</p>
<p>families; valiant-eyed girl graduates and undergraduates; lank,</p>
<p>hungry-looking creatures, who stirred one's imagination; one very</p>
<p>dainty little woman in deep mourning, I recall, grave and steadfast,</p>
<p>with eyes fixed on distant things. Some of those women looked</p>
<p>defiant, some timidly aggressive, some full of the stir of</p>
<p>adventure, some drooping with cold and fatigue. The supply never</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3181">ceased</a>. I had a mortal <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3182">fear</a> that somehow the supply might halt or</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3183">cease</a>. I found that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3184">continual</a> siege of the legislature</p>
<p>extraordinarily impressive-infinitely more impressive than the</p>
<p>feeble-forcible "ragging" of the more militant section. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3185">thought</a></p>
<p>of the appeal that must be going through the country, summoning the</p>
<p>women from countless scattered homes, rooms, colleges, to</p>
<p>Westminster.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3186">remember</a> too the petty little difficulty I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3187">felt</a> whether I should</p>
<p>ignore these pickets altogether, or lift a hat as I hurried past</p>
<p>with averted eyes, or look them in the face as I did so. Towards</p>
<p>the end the House evoked an etiquette of salutation.</p>

<p>There was a tendency, even on the part of its sympathisers, to treat</p>
<p>the whole suffrage agitation as if it were a disconnected issue,</p>
<p>irrelevant to all other broad developments of social and political</p>
<p>life. We struggled, all of us, to ignore the indicating finger it</p>
<p>thrust out before us. "Your schemes, for all their bigness," it</p>
<p>insisted to our reluctant, averted <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3188">minds</a>, "still don't go down to</p>
<p>the essential things…"</p>
<p>We have to go deeper, or our inadequate children's insufficient</p>
<p>children will starve amidst harvests of earless futility. That</p>
<p>conservatism which works in every class to preserve in its</p>
<p>essentials the habitual daily life is all against a profounder</p>
<p>treatment of political issues. The politician, almost as absurdly</p>
<p>as the philosopher, tends constantly, in spite of magnificent</p>
<p>preludes, vast intimations, to specialise <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3189">himself</a> out of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3190">reality</a></p>
<p>he has so stupendously summoned-he bolts back to littleness. The</p>
<p>world has to be moulded anew, he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3191">continues</a> to admit, but without, he</p>
<p>adds, any risk of upsetting his week-end visits, his morning cup of</p>
<p>tea…</p>
<p>The discussion of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3192">relations</a> of men and women disturbs every one.</p>
<p>It reacts upon the private life of every one who attempts it. And</p>
<p>at any particular time only a small minority have a personal</p>
<p>interest in changing the established <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3193">state</a> of affairs. Habit and</p>
<p>interest are in a constantly recruited majority against <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3194">conscious</a></p>
<p>change and adjustment in these matters. Drift rules us. The great</p>
<p>mass of people, and an overwhelming proportion of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3195">influential</a></p>
<p>people, are people who have banished their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3196">dreams</a> and made their</p>
<p>compromise. Wonderful and beautiful possibilities are no longer to</p>
<p>be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3197">thought</a> about. They have given up any aspirations for intense</p>
<p>love, their splendid offspring, for keen delights, have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3198">accepted</a> a</p>
<p>cultivated kindliness and an uncritical sense of righteousness as</p>
<p>their compensation. It's a settled affair with them, a settled,</p>
<p>dangerous affair. Most of them <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3199">fear</a>, and many <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3200">hate</a>, the slightest</p>
<p>reminder of those abandoned <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3196">dreams</a>. As Dayton once said to the</p>
<p>Pentagram Circle, when we were discussing the problem of a universal</p>
<p>marriage and divorce law throughout the Empire, "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3201">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3202">am</a> for leaving</p>
<p>all these things <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3203">alone</a>." And then, with a groan in his voice,</p>
<p>"Leave them <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3203">alone</a>! Leave them all <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3203">alone</a>!"</p>
<p>That was his whole speech for the evening, in a note of suppressed</p>
<p>passion, and presently, against all our etiquette, he got up and</p>
<p>went out.</p>
<p>For some years after my marriage, I too was for leaving them <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3204">alone</a>.</p>
<p>I developed a dread and dislike for romance, for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3205">emotional</a> music,</p>
<p>for the human figure in art-turning my heart to landscape. I</p>
<p>wanted to sneer at lovers and their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3206">ecstasies</a>, and was uncomfortable</p>
<p>until I found the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3207">effective</a> sneer. In matters of private morals</p>
<p>these were my most uncharitable years. I didn't want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3208">think</a> of</p>
<p>these things any more for ever. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3209">hated</a> the people whose talk or</p>
<p>practice showed they were not of my opinion. I wanted to believe</p>
<p>that their views were immoral and objectionable and contemptible,</p>
<p>because I had decided to treat them as at that level. I was, in</p>
<p>fact, falling into the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3210">attitude</a> of the normal decent man.</p>
<p>And yet one cannot <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3211">help</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3212">thinking</a>! The sensible moralised man finds</p>
<p>it hard to escape the stream of suggestion that there are still</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3213">dreams</a> beyond these commonplace acquiescences,-the appeal of beauty</p>
<p>suddenly shining upon one, the mothlike stirrings of serene summer</p>
<p>nights, the sweetness of distant music…</p>
<p>It is one of the paradoxical factors in our public life at the</p>
<p>present time, which penalises abandonment to love so abundantly and</p>
<p>so heavily, that power, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3214">influence</a> and control fall largely to</p>
<p>unencumbered people and sterile people and people who have married</p>
<p>for passionless purposes, people whose very deficiency in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3215">feeling</a></p>
<p>has left them free to follow ambition, people beautyblind, who don't</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3216">understand</a> what it is to fall in love, what it is to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3217">desire</a> children</p>
<p>or have them, what it is to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3218">feel</a> in their blood and bodies the</p>
<p>supreme claim of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3219">good</a> births and selective births above all other</p>
<p>affairs in life, people almost of necessity averse from this most</p>

<p>It wasn't, however, my deepening sympathy with and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3221">understanding</a> of</p>
<p>the position of women in general, or the change in my ideas about</p>
<p>all these intimate things my fast friendship with Isabel was</p>
<p>bringing about, that led me to the heretical views I have in the</p>
<p>last five years dragged from the region of academic and timid</p>
<p>discussion into the field of practical politics. Those <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3222">influences</a>,</p>
<p>no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3223">doubt</a>, have converged to the same end, and given me a powerful</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3224">emotional</a> push upon my road, but it was a broader and colder view of</p>
<p>things that first determined me in my attempt to graft the Endowment</p>
<p>of Motherhood in some <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3225">form</a> or other upon British Imperialism. Now</p>
<p>that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3226">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3227">am</a> exiled from the political world, it is possible to</p>
<p>estimate just how <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3228">effectually</a> that grafting has been done.</p>
<p>I have explained how the ideas of a trained aristocracy and a</p>
<p>universal education <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3229">grew</a> to paramount importance in my political</p>
<p>scheme. It is but a short step from this to the question of the</p>
<p>quantity and quality of births in the community, and from that again</p>
<p>to these forbidden and fear-beset topics of marriage, divorce, and</p>
<p>the family organisation. A sporadic discussion of these aspects had</p>
<p>been going on for years, a Eugenic society <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3230">existed</a>, and articles on</p>
<p>the Falling Birth Rate, and the Rapid Multiplication of the Unfit</p>
<p>were staples of the monthly magazines. But beyond an intermittent</p>
<p>scolding of prosperous childless people in general-one never</p>
<p>addressed them in particular-nothing was done towards arresting</p>
<p>those adverse processes. Almost against my natural inclination, I</p>
<p>found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3231">myself</a> forced to go into these things. I came to the</p>
<p>conclusion that under modern <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3232">conditions</a> the isolated private family,</p>
<p>based on the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3230">existing</a> marriage contract, was failing in its work.</p>
<p>It wasn't producing enough children, and children <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3233">good</a> enough and</p>
<p>well trained enough for the demands of the developing civilised</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3234">state</a>. Our civilisation was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3235">growing</a> outwardly, and decaying in its</p>
<p>intimate substance, and unless it was presently to collapse, some</p>
<p>very extensive and courageous reorganisation was needed. The old</p>
<p>haphazard system of pairing, qualified more and more by worldly</p>
<p>discretions, no longer secures a young population numerous enough or</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3233">good</a> enough for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3235">growing</a> needs and possibilities of our Empire.</p>
<p>Statecraft sits weaving splendid garments, no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3236">doubt</a>, but with a</p>
<p>puny, ugly, insufficient baby in the cradle.</p>
<p>No one so far has dared to take up this problem as a present</p>
<p>question for statecraft, but it comes unheralded, unadvocated, and</p>
<p>sits at every legislative board. Every improvement is provisional</p>
<p>except the improvement of the race, and it became more and more</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3237">doubtful</a> to me if we were improving the race at all! Splendid and</p>
<p>beautiful and courageous people must come together and have</p>
<p>children, women with their fine senses and glorious devotion must be</p>
<p>freed from the net that compels them to be celibate, compels them to</p>
<p>be childless and useless, or to bear children ignobly to men whom</p>
<p>need and ignorance and the treacherous pressure of circumstances</p>
<p>have forced upon them. We all <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3238">know</a> that, and so few dare even to</p>
<p>whisper it for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3239">fear</a> that they should seem, in seeking to save the</p>
<p>family, to threaten its <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3240">existence</a>. It is as if a party of pigmies</p>
<p>in a not too capacious room had been joined by a carnivorous giant-</p>
<p>and decided to go on living <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3241">happily</a> by cutting him dead…</p>
<p>The problem the developing civilised <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3242">state</a> has to solve is how it</p>
<p>can get the best possible increase under the best possible</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3243">conditions</a>. I became more and more convinced that the independent</p>
<p>family unit of to-day, in which the man is master of the wife and</p>
<p>owner of the children, in which all are dependent upon him,</p>
<p>subordinated to his enterprises and liable to follow his fortunes up</p>
<p>or down, does not supply anything like the best conceivable</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3243">conditions</a>. We want to modernise the family footing altogether. An</p>
<p>enormous premium both in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3244">pleasure</a> and competitive efficiency is put</p>
<p>upon voluntary childlessness, and enormous inducements are held out</p>
<p>to women to subordinate instinctive and selective preferences to</p>
<p>social and material considerations.</p>
<p>The practical reaction of modern <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3245">conditions</a> upon the old tradition</p>
<p>of the family is this: that beneath the pretence that nothing is</p>
<p>changing, secretly and with all the unwholesomeness of secrecy</p>
<p>everything is changed. Offspring fall away, the birth rate falls</p>
<p>and falls most among just the most efficient and active and best</p>
<p>adapted classes in the community. The species is recruited from</p>
<p>among its failures and from among less civilised aliens.</p>
<p>Contemporary civilisations are in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3246">effect</a> burning the best of their</p>
<p>possible babies in the furnaces that run the machinery. In the</p>
<p>United States the native Anglo-American strain has scarcely</p>
<p>increased at all since 1830, and in most Western European countries</p>
<p>the same is probably <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3247">true</a> of the ablest and most energetic elements</p>
<p>in the community. The women of these classes still remain legally</p>
<p>and practically dependent and protected, with the only natural</p>
<p>excuse for their dependence gone…</p>
<p>The modern world becomes an immense spectacle of unsatisfactory</p>
<p>groupings; here childless couples bored to death in the hopeless</p>
<p>effort to sustain an incessant honeymoon, here homes in which a</p>
<p>solitary child <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3248">grows</a> unsocially, here small two or three-child homes</p>
<p>that do no more than <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3249">continue</a> the culture of the parents at a great</p>
<p>social cost, here numbers of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3250">unhappy</a> educated but childless married</p>
<p>women, here careless, decivilised fecund homes, here orphanages and</p>
<p>asylums for the heedlessly begotten. It is just the disorderly</p>
<p>proliferation of Bromstead over again, in lives instead of in</p>
<p>houses.</p>
<p>What is the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3251">good</a>, what is the common sense, of rectifying</p>
<p>boundaries, pushing research and discovery, building cities,</p>
<p>improving all the facilities of life, making great fleets, waging</p>
<p>wars, while this aimless decadence remains the quality of the</p>
<p>biological outlook?…</p>
<p>It is difficult now to trace how I changed from my early aversion</p>
<p>until I faced this mass of problems. But so far back as 1910 I had</p>
<p>it clear in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3252">mind</a> that I would rather fail utterly than</p>
<p>participate in all the surrenders of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3252">mind</a> and body that are implied</p>
<p>in Dayton's snarl of "Leave it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3253">alone</a>; leave it all <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3253">alone</a>!" Marriage</p>
<p>and the begetting and care of children, is the very ground substance</p>
<p>in the life of the community. In a world in which everything</p>
<p>changes, in which fresh methods, fresh adjustments and fresh ideas</p>
<p>perpetually renew the circumstances of life, it is preposterous that</p>
<p>we should not even examine into these matters, should <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3254">rest</a> content</p>
<p>to be ruled by the uncriticised traditions of a barbaric age.</p>
<p>Now, it seems to me that the solution of this problem is also the</p>
<p>solution of the woman's individual problem. The two go together,</p>
<p>are right and left of one question. The only conceivable way out</p>
<p>from our IMPASSE lies in the recognition of parentage, that is to</p>
<p>say of adequate mothering, as no longer a chance product of</p>
<p>individual passions but a service rendered to the State. Women must</p>
<p>become less and less subordinated to individual men, since this</p>
<p>works out in a more or less complete <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3255">limitation</a>, waste, and</p>
<p>sterilisation of their essentially social function; they must become</p>
<p>more and more subordinated as individually independent citizens to</p>
<p>the collective purpose. Or, to express the thing by a familiar</p>
<p>phrase, the highly organised, scientific <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3256">state</a> we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3257">desire</a> must, if it</p>
<p>is to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3258">exist</a> at all, base itself not upon the irresponsible man-ruled</p>
<p>family, but upon the matriarchal family, the citizen-ship and</p>
<p>freedom of women and the public endowment of motherhood.</p>
<p>After two generations of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3259">confused</a> and experimental revolt it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3260">grows</a></p>
<p>clear to modern women that a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3261">conscious</a>, deliberate motherhood and</p>
<p>mothering is their special function in the State, and that a</p>
<p>personal subordination to an individual man with an unlimited power</p>
<p>of control over this intimate and supreme duty is a degradation. No</p>
<p>contemporary woman of education put to the test is willing to</p>
<p>recognise any claim a man can make upon her but the claim of her</p>
<p>freely-given devotion to him. She wants the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3262">reality</a> of her choice</p>
<p>and she means "family" while a man too often means only possession.</p>
<p>This alters the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3263">spirit</a> of the family relationships fundamentally.</p>
<p>Their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3264">form</a> remains just what it was when woman was esteemed a</p>
<p>pretty, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3265">desirable</a>, and incidentally a child-producing, chattel.</p>
<p>Against these time-honoured ideas the new <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3263">spirit</a> of womanhood</p>
<p>struggles in shame, astonishment, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3266">bitterness</a>, and tears…</p>
<p>I confess <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3267">myself</a> altogether feminist. I have no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3268">doubts</a> in the</p>
<p>matter. I want this coddling and browbeating of women to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3269">cease</a>. I</p>
<p>want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3270">see</a> women come in, free and fearless, to a full</p>
<p>participation in the collective purpose of mankind. Women, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3271">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3272">am</a></p>
<p>convinced, are as fine as men; they can be as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3273">wise</a> as men; they are</p>
<p>capable of far greater devotion than men. I want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3270">see</a> them</p>
<p>citizens, with a marriage law framed primarily for them and for</p>
<p>their protection and the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3274">good</a> of the race, and not for men's</p>
<p>satisfactions. I want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3270">see</a> them bearing and rearing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3274">good</a> children</p>
<p>in the State as a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3275">generously</a> rewarded public duty and service,</p>
<p>choosing their husbands freely and discerningly, and in no way</p>
<p>enslaved by or subordinated to the men they have chosen. The social</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3276">consciousness</a> of women seems to me an unworked, an almost untouched</p>
<p>mine of wealth for the constructive purpose of the world. I want to</p>
<p>change the respective values of the family group altogether, and</p>
<p>make the home indeed the women's kingdom and the mother the owner</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3277">responsible</a> guardian of her children.</p>
<p>It is no use pretending that this is not novel and revolutionary; it</p>
<p>is. The Endowment of Motherhood implies a new method of social</p>
<p>organization, a rearrangement of the social unit, untried in human</p>
<p>expericnce-as untried as electric traction was or flying in 1800.</p>
<p>Of course, it may work out to modify men's ideas of marriage</p>
<p>profoundly. To me that is a secondary consideration. I do not</p>
<p>believe that particular assertion <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3278">myself</a>, because <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3279">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3280">am</a> convinced</p>
<p>that a practical monogamy is a psychological necessity to the mass</p>
<p>of civilised people. But even if I did believe it I should still</p>
<p>keep to my present line, because it is the only line that will</p>
<p>prevent a highly organised civilisation from ending in biological</p>
<p>decay. The public Endowment of Motherhood is the only possible way</p>
<p>which will ensure the permanently developing civilised <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3281">state</a> at</p>
<p>which all constructive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3282">minds</a> are aiming. A point is reached in the</p>
<p>life-history of a civilisation when either this reconstruction must</p>
<p>be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3283">effected</a> or the quality and MORALE of the population prove</p>
<p>insufficient for the needs of the developing organisation. It is</p>
<p>not so much moral decadence that will destroy us as moral</p>
<p>inadaptability. The old code fails under the new needs. The only</p>
<p>alternative to this profound reconstruction is a decay in human</p>
<p>quality and social collapse. Either this unprecedented</p>
<p>rearrangement must be achieved by our civilisation, or it must</p>
<p>presently come upon a phase of disorder and crumble and perish, as</p>
<p>Rome perished, as France declines, as the strain of the Pilgrim</p>
<p>Fathers dwindles out of America. Whatever hope there may be in the</p>
<p>attempt therefore, there is no alternative to the attempt.</p>

<p>I wanted political success now dearly enough, but not at the price</p>
<p>of constructive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3284">realities</a>. These questions were no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3285">doubt</a></p>
<p>monstrously dangerous in the political world; there wasn't a</p>
<p>politician alive who didn't look scared at the mention of "The</p>
<p>Family," but if raising these issues were essential to the social</p>
<p>reconstructions on which my life was set, that did not matter. It</p>
<p>only implied that I should take them up with deliberate caution.</p>
<p>There was no release because of risk or difficulty.</p>
<p>The question of whether I should commit <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3286">myself</a> to some open project</p>
<p>in this direction was going on in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3287">mind</a> concurrently with my</p>
<p>speculations about a change of party, like bass and treble in a</p>
<p>complex piece of music. The two drew to a conclusion together. I</p>
<p>would not only go over to Imperialism, but I would attempt to</p>
<p>biologise Imperialism.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3288">thought</a> at first that I was undertaking a monstrous uphill task.</p>
<p>But as I came to look into the possibilities of the matter, a strong</p>
<p>persuasion <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3289">grew</a> up in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3290">mind</a> that this panic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3291">fear</a> of legislative</p>
<p>proposals affecting the family basis was excessive, that things were</p>
<p>much riper for development in this direction than old-experienced</p>
<p>people out of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3292">touch</a> with the younger generation imagined, that to</p>
<p>phrase the thing in a parliamentary fashion, "something might be</p>
<p>done in the constituencies" with the Endowment of Motherhood</p>
<p>forthwith, provided only that it was made perfectly clear that</p>
<p>anything a sane person could possibly intend by "morality" was left</p>
<p>untouched by these proposals.</p>
<p>I went to work very carefully. I got Roper of the DAILY TELEPHONE</p>
<p>and Burkett of the DIAL to try over a silly-season discussion of</p>
<p>State <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3293">Help</a> for Mothers, and I put a series of articles on eugenics,</p>
<p>upon the fall in the birth-rate, and similar topics in the BLUE</p>
<p>WEEKLY, leading up to a tentative and generalised advocacy of the</p>
<p>public endowment of the nation's children. I was more and more</p>
<p>struck by the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3294">acceptance</a> won by a sober and restrained presentation</p>
<p>of this suggestion.</p>
<p>And then, in the fourth year of the BLUE WEEKLY'S career, came the</p>
<p>Handitch election, and I was forced by the clamour of my antagonist,</p>
<p>and very willingly forced, to put my convictions to the test. I</p>
<p>returned triumphantly to Westminster with the Public Endowment of</p>
<p>Motherhood as part of my open profession and with the full approval</p>
<p>of the party press. Applauding benches of Imperialists cheered me</p>
<p>on my way to the table between the whips.</p>
<p>That second time I took the oath I was not one of a crowd of new</p>
<p>members, but salient, an event, a symbol of profound changes and new</p>
<p>purposes in the national life.</p>
<p>Here it is my political book comes to an end, and in a sense my book</p>
<p>ends altogether. For the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3295">rest</a> is but to tell how I was swept out of</p>
<p>this great world of political possibilities. I close this Third</p>
<p>Book as I opened it, with an admission of difficulties and</p>
<p>complexities, but now with a pile of manuscript before me I have to</p>
<p>confess them unsurmounted and still entangled.</p>
<p>Yet my aim was a final simplicity. I have sought to show my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3296">growing</a></p>
<p>realisation that the essential quality of all political and social</p>
<p>effort is the development of a great race <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3297">mind</a> behind the interplay</p>
<p>of individual lives. That is the collective human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3298">reality</a>, the</p>
<p>basis of morality, the purpose of devotion. To that our lives must</p>
<p>be given, from that will come the perpetual fresh release and</p>
<p>further <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3299">ennoblement</a> of individual lives…</p>
<p>I have wanted to make that idea of a collective <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3300">mind</a> play in this</p>
<p>book the part United Italy plays in Machiavelli's PRINCE. I have</p>
<p>called it the hinterland of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3301">reality</a>, shown it accumulating a</p>
<p>dominating <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3302">truth</a> and rightness which must force men's now sporadic</p>
<p>motives more and more into a disciplined and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3303">understanding</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3304">relation</a></p>
<p>to a plan. And I have tried to indicate how I sought to serve this</p>
<p>great clarification of our confusions…</p>
<p>Now I come back to personality and the story of my self-betrayal,</p>
<p>and how it is I have had to leave all that far-reaching scheme of</p>
<p>mine, a mere project and beginning for other men to take or leave as</p>
<p>it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3305">pleases</a> them.</p>

</title>
<p>I come to the most evasive and difficult part of my story, which is</p>
<p>to tell how Isabel and I have made a common wreck of our joint</p>
<p>lives.</p>
<p>It is not the telling of one simple disastrous accident. There was</p>
<p>a vein in our natures that led to this collapse, gradually and at</p>
<p>this point and that it crept to the surface. One may indeed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3306">see</a> our</p>
<p>destruction-for indeed politically we could not be more extinct if</p>
<p>we had been shot dead-in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3307">form</a> of a catastrophe as disconnected</p>
<p>and conclusive as a meteoric stone falling out of heaven upon two</p>
<p>friends and crushing them both. But I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3308">think</a> that is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3309">true</a> to</p>
<p>our situation or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3310">ourselves</a>. We were not taken by surprise. The</p>
<p>thing was in us and not from without, it was akin to our way of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3311">thinking</a> and our habitual <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3312">attitudes</a>; it had, for all its impulsive</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3313">effect</a>, a certain necessity. We might have escaped no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3314">doubt</a>, as two</p>
<p>men at a hundred yards may shoot at each other with pistols for a</p>
<p>considerable time and escape. But it isn't particularly reasonable</p>
<p>to talk of the contrariety of fate if they both get hit.</p>
<p>Isabel and I were dangerous to each other for several years of</p>
<p>friendship, and not quite unwittingly so.</p>
<p>In writing this, moreover, there is a very great difficulty in</p>
<p>steering my way between two equally undesirable tones in the</p>
<p>telling. In the first place I do not want to seem to confess my</p>
<p>sins with a penitence <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3315">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3316">am</a> very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3317">doubtful</a> if I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3318">feel</a>. Now that I have</p>
<p>got Isabel we can no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3319">doubt</a> count the cost of it and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3318">feel</a></p>
<p>unquenchable regrets, but <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3315">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3316">am</a> not sure whether, if we could be put</p>
<p>back now into such circumstances as we were in a year ago, or two</p>
<p>years ago, whether with my eyes fully open I should not do over</p>
<p>again very much as I did. And on the other hand I do not want to</p>
<p>justify the things we have done. We are two bad people-if there is</p>
<p>to be any classification of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3320">good</a> and bad at all, we have acted</p>
<p>badly, and quite apart from any other considerations we've largely</p>
<p>wasted our own very great possibilities. But it is part of a queer</p>
<p>humour that underlies all this, that I find <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3321">myself</a> slipping again</p>
<p>and again into a sentimental treatment of our case that is as</p>
<p>unpremeditated as it is insincere. When <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3315">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3316">am</a> a little tired after a</p>
<p>morning's writing I find the faint suggestion getting into every</p>
<p>other sentence that our blunders and misdeeds embodied, after the</p>
<p>fashion of the prophet Hosea, profound moral <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3322">truths</a>. Indeed, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3318">feel</a></p>
<p>so little confidence in my ability to keep this altogether out of my</p>
<p>book that I warn the reader here that in spite of anything he may</p>
<p>read elsewhere in the story, intimating however shyly an esoteric</p>
<p>and exalted <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3323">virtue</a> in our proceedings, the plain <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3322">truth</a> of this</p>
<p>business is that Isabel and I wanted each other with a want entirely</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3324">formless</a>, inconsiderate, and overwhelming. And though I could tell</p>
<p>you countless delightful and beautiful things about Isabel, were</p>
<p>this a book in her praise, I cannot either analyse that want or</p>
<p>account for its extreme intensity.</p>
<p>I will confess that deep in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3325">mind</a> there is a belief in a sort of</p>
<p>wild rightness about any love that is fraught with beauty, but that</p>
<p>eludes me and vanishes again, and is not, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3326">feel</a>, to be put with the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3327">real</a> veracities and righteousnesses and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3328">virtues</a> in the paddocks and</p>
<p>menageries of human reason…</p>
<p>We have already a child, and Margaret was childless, and I find</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3329">myself</a> prone to insist upon that, as if it was a justification.</p>
<p>But, indeed, when we became lovers there was small <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3330">thought</a> of</p>
<p>Eugenics between us. Ours was a mutual and not a philoprogenitive</p>
<p>passion. Old Nature behind us may have had such purposes with us,</p>
<p>but it is not for us to annex her intentions by a moralising</p>
<p>afterthought. There isn't, in fact, any decent justification for us</p>
<p>whatever-at that the story must stand.</p>
<p>But if there is no justification there is at least a very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3331">effective</a></p>
<p>excuse in the mental <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3332">confusedness</a> of our time. The evasion of that</p>
<p>passionately thorough exposition of belief and of the grounds of</p>
<p>morality, which is the outcome of the mercenary religious</p>
<p>compromises of the late Vatican period, the stupid suppression of</p>
<p>anything but the most timid discussion of sexual morality in our</p>
<p>literature and drama, the pervading cultivated and protected muddle-</p>
<p>headedness, leaves mentally vigorous people with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3333">relatively</a> enormous</p>
<p>possibilities of destruction and little <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3331">effective</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3334">help</a>. They find</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3335">themselves</a> confronted by the habits and prejudices of manifestly</p>
<p>commonplace people, and by that extraordinary patched-up</p>
<p>Christianity, the cult of a "Bromsteadised" deity, diffused,</p>
<p>scattered, and aimless, which hides from examination and any</p>
<p>possibility of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3336">faith</a> behind the plea of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3337">good</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3338">taste</a>. A god about</p>
<p>whom there is delicacy is far worse than no god at all. We are</p>
<p>FORCED to be laws unto <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3339">ourselves</a> and to live experimentally. It is</p>
<p>inevitable that a considerable fraction of just that bolder, more</p>
<p>initiatory section of the intellectual community, the section that</p>
<p>can least be spared from the collective life in a period of trial</p>
<p>and change, will drift into such <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3340">emotional</a> crises and such disaster</p>
<p>as overtook us. Most perhaps will escape, but many will go down,</p>
<p>many more than the world can spare. It is the unwritten law of all</p>
<p>our public life, and the same holds <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3341">true</a> of America, that an honest</p>
<p>open scandal ends a career. England in the last quarter of a</p>
<p>century has wasted half a dozen statesmen on this score; she would,</p>
<p>I believe, reject Nelson now if he sought to serve her. Is it</p>
<p>wonderful that to us fretting here in exile this should seem the</p>
<p>cruellest as well as the most foolish elimination of a necessary</p>
<p>social element? It destroys no vice; for vice hides by nature. It</p>
<p>not only rewards dullness as if it were positive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3342">virtue</a>, but sets an</p>
<p>enormous premium upon hypocrisy. That is my case, and that is why I</p>
<p>am telling this side of my story with so much explicitness.</p>

<p>Ever since the Kinghamstead election I had maintained what seemed a</p>
<p>desultory friendship with Isabel. At first it was rather Isabel</p>
<p>kept it up than I. Whenever Margaret and I went down to that villa,</p>
<p>with its three or four acres of garden and shrubbery about it, which</p>
<p>fulfilled our election promise to live at Kinghamstead, Isabel would</p>
<p>turn up in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3343">state</a> of frank cheerfulness, rejoicing at us, and talk</p>
<p>all she was reading and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3344">thinking</a> to me, and stay for all the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3345">rest</a> of</p>
<p>the day. In her shameless liking for me she was as natural as a</p>
<p>savage. She would exercise me vigorously at tennis, while Margaret</p>
<p>lay and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3345">rested</a> her back in the afternoon, or guide me for some long</p>
<p>ramble that dodged the suburban and congested patches of the</p>
<p>constituency with amazing skill. She took possession of me in that</p>
<p>unabashed, straight-minded way a girl will sometimes adopt with a</p>
<p>man, chose my path or criticised my game with a motherly solicitude</p>
<p>for my welfare that was absurd and delightful. And we talked. We</p>
<p>discussed and criticised the stories of novels, scraps of history,</p>
<p>pictures, social questions, socialism, the policy of the Government.</p>
<p>She was young and most unevenly informed, but she was amazingly</p>
<p>sharp and quick and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3346">good</a>. Never before in my life had I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3347">known</a> a</p>
<p>girl of her age, or a woman of her quality. I had never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3348">dreamt</a></p>
<p>there was such talk in the world. Kinghamstead became a lightless</p>
<p>place when she went to Oxford. Heaven <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3349">knows</a> how much that may not</p>
<p>have precipitated my abandonment of the seat!</p>
<p>She went to Ridout College, Oxford, and that certainly weighed with</p>
<p>me when presently after my breach with the Liberals various little</p>
<p>undergraduate societies began to ask for lectures and discussions.</p>
<p>I favoured Oxford. I declared openly I did so because of her. At</p>
<p>that time I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3350">think</a> we neither of us suspected the possibility of</p>
<p>passion that lay like a coiled snake in the path before us. It</p>
<p>seemed to us that we had the quaintest, most delightful friendship</p>
<p>in the world; she was my pupil, and I was her guide, philosopher,</p>
<p>and friend. People smiled indulgently-even Margaret smiled</p>
<p>indulgently-at our attraction for one another.</p>
<p>Such friendships are not uncommon nowadays-among easy-going,</p>
<p>liberal-minded people. For the most part, there's no sort of harm,</p>
<p>as people say, in them. The two persons concerned are never</p>
<p>supposed to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3351">think</a> of the passionate love that hovers so close to the</p>
<p>friendship, or if they do, then they banish the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3352">thought</a>. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3351">think</a> we</p>
<p>kept the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3352">thought</a> as permanently in exile as any one could do. If it</p>
<p>did in odd moments come into our heads we pretended elaborately it</p>
<p>wasn't there.</p>
<p>Only we were both very easily <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3353">jealous</a> of each other's attention, and</p>
<p>tremendously insistent upon each other's preference.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3354">remember</a> once during the Oxford days an intimation that should</p>
<p>have set me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3355">thinking</a>, and I suppose discreetly disentangling <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3356">myself</a>.</p>
<p>It was one Sunday afternoon, and it must have been about May, for</p>
<p>the trees and shrubs of Ridout College were gay with blossom, and</p>
<p>fresh with the new sharp greens of spring. I had walked talking</p>
<p>with Isabel and a couple of other girls through the wide gardens of</p>
<p>the place, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3357">seen</a> and criticised the new brick pond, nodded to the</p>
<p>daughter of this friend and that in the hammocks under the trees,</p>
<p>and picked a way among the scattered tea-parties on the lawn to our</p>
<p>own circle on the grass under a Siberian crab near the great bay</p>
<p>window. There I sat and ate great quantities of cake, and discussed</p>
<p>the tactics of the Suffragettes. I had made some comments upon the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3358">spirit</a> of the movement in an address to the men in Pembroke, and it</p>
<p>had got abroad, and a group of girls and women dons were now having</p>
<p>it out with me.</p>
<p>I forget the drift of the conversation, or what it was made Isabel</p>
<p>interrupt me. She did interrupt me. She bad been lying prone on</p>
<p>the ground at my right hand, chin on fists, listening <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3359">thoughtfully</a>,</p>
<p>and I was sitting beside old Lady Evershead on a garden seat. I</p>
<p>turned to Isabel's voice, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3360">saw</a> her face uplifted, and her dear</p>
<p>cheeks and nose and forehead all splashed and barred with sunlight</p>
<p>and the shadows of the twigs of the trees behind me. And something-</p>
<p>an infinite tenderness, stabbed me. It was a keen physical</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3361">feeling</a>, like nothing I had ever <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3362">felt</a> before. It had a quality of</p>
<p>tears in it. For the first time in my narrow and concentrated life</p>
<p>another human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3363">being</a> had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3364">really</a> thrust into my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3363">being</a> and gripped my</p>
<p>very heart.</p>
<p>Our eyes met perplexed for an extraordinary moment. Then I turned</p>
<p>back and addressed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3365">myself</a> a little stiffly to the substance of her</p>
<p>intervention. For some time I couldn't look at her again.</p>
<p>From that time forth I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3366">knew</a> I loved Isabel beyond measure.</p>
<p>Yet it is curious that it never occurred to me for a year or so that</p>
<p>this was likely to be a matter of passion between us. I have told</p>
<p>how definitely I put my imagination into harness in those matters at</p>
<p>my marriage, and I was living now in a world of big interests, where</p>
<p>there is neither much time nor inclination for deliberate love-</p>
<p>making. I suppose there is a large class of men who never meet a</p>
<p>girl or a woman without <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3367">thinking</a> of sex, who meet a friend's</p>
<p>daughter and decide: "Mustn't get friendly with her-wouldn't DO,"</p>
<p>and set invisible bars between <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3368">themselves</a> and all the wives in the</p>
<p>world. Perhaps that is the way to live. Perhaps there is no other</p>
<p>method than this <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3369">effectual</a> annihilation of half-and the most</p>
<p>sympathetic and attractive half-of the human beings in the world,</p>
<p>so far as any frank intercourse is concerned. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3370">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3371">am</a> quite convinced</p>
<p>anyhow that such a qualified intimacy as ours, such a drifting into</p>
<p>the sense of possession, such untrammeled conversation with an</p>
<p>invisible, implacable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3372">limit</a> set just where the intimacy glows, it is</p>
<p>no kind of tolerable compromise. If men and women are to go so far</p>
<p>together, they must be free to go as far as they may want to go,</p>
<p>without the vindictive destruction that has come upon us. On the</p>
<p>basis of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3373">accepted</a> codes the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3374">jealous</a> people are right, and the</p>
<p>liberal-minded ones are playing with fire. If people are not to</p>
<p>love, then they must be kept apart. If they are not to be kept</p>
<p>apart, then we must prepare for an unprecedented toleration of</p>
<p>lovers.</p>
<p>Isabel was as unforeseeing as I to begin with, but sex marches into</p>
<p>the life of an intelligent girl with demands and challenges far more</p>
<p>urgent than the mere call of curiosity and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3375">satiable</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3376">desire</a> that</p>
<p>comes to a young man. No woman yet has dared to tell the story of</p>
<p>that unfolding. She attracted men, and she encouraged them, and</p>
<p>watched them, and tested them, and dismissed them, and concealed the</p>
<p>substance of her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3377">thoughts</a> about them in the way that seems</p>
<p>instinctive in a natural-minded girl. There was even an engagement-</p>
<p>amidst the protests and disapproval of the college authorities. I</p>
<p>never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3378">saw</a> the man, though she gave me a long history of the affair,</p>
<p>to which I listened with a forced and insincere sympathy. She</p>
<p>struck me oddly as taking the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3379">relationship</a> for a thing in itself,</p>
<p>and regardless of its consequences. After a time she became silent</p>
<p>about him, and then threw him over; and by that time, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3380">think</a>, for</p>
<p>all that she was so much my junior, she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3381">knew</a> more about <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3382">herself</a> and</p>
<p>me than I was to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3383">know</a> for several years to come.</p>
<p>We didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3384">see</a> each other for some months after my resignation, but</p>
<p>we kept up a frequent correspondence. She said twice over that she</p>
<p>wanted to talk to me, that letters didn't convey what one wanted to</p>
<p>say, and I went up to Oxford pretty definitely to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3384">see</a> her-though I</p>
<p>combined it with one or two other engagements-somewhere in</p>
<p>February. Insensibly she had become important enough for me to make</p>
<p>journeys for her.</p>
<p>But we didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3385">see</a> very much of one another on that occasion. There</p>
<p>was something in the air between us that made a faint embarrassment;</p>
<p>the mere fact, perhaps, that she had asked me to come up.</p>
<p>A year before she would have dashed off with me quite unscrupulously</p>
<p>to talk <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3386">alone</a>, carried me off to her room for an hour with a minute</p>
<p>of chaperonage to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3387">satisfy</a> the rules. Now there was always some one</p>
<p>or other near us that it seemed impossible to exorcise.</p>
<p>We went for a walk on the Sunday afternoon with old Fortescue, K.</p>
<p>C., who'd come up to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3388">see</a> his two daughters, both great friends of</p>
<p>Isabel's, and some mute inglorious don whose name I forget, but who</p>
<p>was in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3389">state</a> of marked admiration for her. The six of us played a</p>
<p>game of conversational entanglements throughout, and mostly I was</p>
<p>impressing the Fortescue girls with the want of mental concentration</p>
<p>possible in a rising politician. We went down Carfex, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3390">remember</a>,</p>
<p>to Folly Bridge, and inspected the Barges, and then back by way of</p>
<p>Merton to the Botanic Gardens and Magdalen Bridge. And in the</p>
<p>Botanic Gardens she got almost her only chance with me.</p>
<p>"Last months at Oxford," she said.</p>
<p>"And then?" I asked.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3391">I'm</a> coming to London," she said.</p>
<p>"To write?"</p>
<p>She was silent for a moment. Then she said abruptly, with that</p>
<p>quick flush of hers and a sudden boldness in her eyes: "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3392">I'm</a> going to</p>
<p>work with you. Why shouldn't I?"</p>
</section>

</title>
<p>Here, again, I suppose I had a fair warning of the drift of things.</p>
<p>I seem to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3393">remember</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3394">myself</a> in the train to Paddington, sitting with a</p>
<p>handful of papers-galley proofs for the BLUE WEEKLY, I suppose-on</p>
<p>my lap, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3395">thinking</a> about her and that last sentence of hers, and</p>
<p>all that it might mean to me.</p>
<p>It is very hard to recall even the main outline of anything so</p>
<p>elusive as a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3396">meditation</a>. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3397">know</a> that the idea of working with her</p>
<p>gripped me, fascinated me. That my value in her life seemed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3398">growing</a></p>
<p>filled me with pride and a kind of gratitude. I was already in no</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3399">doubt</a> that her value in my life was tremendous. It made it none the</p>
<p>less, that in those days I was obsessed by the idea that she was</p>
<p>transitory, and bound to go out of my life again. It is no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3400">good</a></p>
<p>trying to set too fine a face upon this complex business, there is</p>
<p>gold and clay and sunlight and savagery in every love story, and a</p>
<p>multitude of elvish elements peeped out beneath the fine rich</p>
<p>curtain of affection that masked our future. I've never properly</p>
<p>weighed how immensely my vanity was gratified by her clear</p>
<p>preference for me. Nor can I for a moment determine how much</p>
<p>deliberate intention I hide from <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3401">myself</a> in this affair.</p>
<p>Certainly I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3402">think</a> some part of me must have been saying in the</p>
<p>train: "Leave go of her. Get away from her. End this now." I</p>
<p>can't have been so stupid as not to have had that in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3403">mind</a>…</p>
<p>If she had been only a beautiful girl in love with me, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3404">think</a> I</p>
<p>could have managed the situation. Once or twice since my marriage</p>
<p>and before Isabel became of any significance in my life, there had</p>
<p>been incidents with other people, flashes of temptation-no telling</p>
<p>is possible of the thing resisted. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3404">think</a> that mere beauty and</p>
<p>passion would not have taken me. But between <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3405">myself</a> and Isabel</p>
<p>things were incurably complicated by the intellectual sympathy we</p>
<p>had, the jolly march of our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3406">minds</a> together. That has always</p>
<p>mattered enormously. I should have wanted her company nearly as</p>
<p>badly if she had been some crippled old lady; we would have hunted</p>
<p>shoulder to shoulder, as two men. Only two men would never have had</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3407">patience</a> and readiness for one another we two had. I had never</p>
<p>for years met any one with whom I could be so carelessly sure of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3408">understanding</a> or to whom I could listen so easily and fully. She</p>
<p>gave me, with an extraordinary completeness, that rare, precious</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3409">effect</a> of always saying something fresh, and yet saying it so that</p>
<p>it filled into and folded about all the little recesses and corners</p>
<p>of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3406">mind</a> with an infinite, soft familiarity. It is impossible to</p>
<p>explain that. It is like trying to explain why her voice, her voice</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3410">heard</a> speaking to any one-heard speaking in another room-pleased</p>
<p>my ears.</p>
<p>She was the only Oxford woman who took a first that year. She spent</p>
<p>the summer in Scotland and Yorkshire, writing to me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3411">continually</a> of</p>
<p>all she now meant to do, and stirring my imagination. She came to</p>
<p>London for the autumn session. For a time she stayed with old Lady</p>
<p>Colbeck, but she fell out with her hostess when it became clear she</p>
<p>wanted to write, not novels, but journalism, and then she set every</p>
<p>one talking by taking a flat near Victoria and installing as her</p>
<p>sole protector an elderly German governess she had engaged through a</p>
<p>scholastic agency. She began writing, not in that copious flood the</p>
<p>undisciplined young woman of gifts is apt to produce, but in exactly</p>
<p>the manner of an able young man, experimenting with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3412">forms</a>,</p>
<p>developing the phrasing of opinions, taking a definite line. She</p>
<p>was, of course, tremendously discussed. She was disapproved of, but</p>
<p>she was invited out to dinner. She got rather a reputation for the</p>
<p>management of elderly distinguished men. It was an odd <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3413">experience</a></p>
<p>to follow Margaret's soft rustle of silk into some big drawing-room</p>
<p>and discover my snub-nosed girl in the blue sack <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3414">transformed</a> into a</p>
<p>shining creature in the soft splendour of pearls and ivory-white and</p>
<p>lace, and with a silver band about her dusky hair.</p>
<p>For a time we did not meet very frequently, though always she</p>
<p>professed an unblushing preference for my company, and talked my</p>
<p>views and sought me out. Then her usefulness upon the BLUE WEEKLY</p>
<p>began to link us closelier. She would come up to the office, and</p>
<p>sit by the window, and talk over the proofs of the next week's</p>
<p>articles, going through my intentions with a keen investigatory</p>
<p>scalpel. Her talk always puts me in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3415">mind</a> of a steel blade. Her</p>
<p>writing became rapidly very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3416">good</a>; she had a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3417">wit</a> and a turn of the</p>
<p>phrase that was all her own. We seemed to have forgotten the little</p>
<p>shadow of embarrassment that had fallen over our last meeting at</p>
<p>Oxford. Everything seemed natural and easy between us in those</p>
<p>days; a little unconventional, but that made it all the brighter.</p>
<p>We developed something like a custom of walks, about once a week or</p>
<p>so, and letters and notes became frequent. I won't pretend things</p>
<p>were not keenly personal between us, but they had an air of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3418">being</a></p>
<p>innocently mental. She used to call me "Master" in our talks, a</p>
<p>monstrous and engaging flattery, and I was inordinately proud to</p>
<p>have her as my pupil. Who wouldn't have been? And we went on at</p>
<p>that distance for a long time-until within a year of the Handitch</p>
<p>election.</p>
<p>After Lady Colbeck threw her up as altogether too "intellectual" for</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3419">comfortable</a> control, Isabel was taken up by the Balfes in a less</p>
<p>formal and compromising manner, and week-ended with them and their</p>
<p>cousin Leonora Sparling, and spent large portions of her summer with</p>
<p>them in Herefordshire. There was a lover or so in that time, men</p>
<p>who came a little timidly at this brilliant young person with the</p>
<p>frank manner and the Amazonian <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3420">mind</a>, and, she declared, received her</p>
<p>kindly refusals with manifest relief. And Arnold Shoesmith struck</p>
<p>up a sort of friendship that oddly imitated mine. She took a liking</p>
<p>to him because he was clumsy and shy and inexpressive; she embarked</p>
<p>upon the dangerous interest of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3421">helping</a> him to find his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3422">soul</a>. I had</p>
<p>some twinges of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3423">jealousy</a> about that. I didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3424">see</a> the necessity of</p>
<p>him. He invaded her time, and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3425">thought</a> that might interfere with</p>
<p>her work. If their friendship stole some hours from Isabel's</p>
<p>writing, it did not for a long while interfere with our walks or our</p>
<p>talks, or the close intimacy we had together.</p>

</title>
<p>Then suddenly Isabel and I found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3426">ourselves</a> passionately in love.</p>
<p>The change came so entirely without warning or intention that I find</p>
<p>it impossible now to tell the order of its phases. What disturbed</p>
<p>pebble started the avalanche I cannot trace. Perhaps it was simply</p>
<p>that the barriers between us and this masked aspect of life had been</p>
<p>wearing down unperceived.</p>
<p>And there came a change in Isabel. It was like some change in the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3427">cycle</a> of nature, like the onset of spring-a sharp brightness, an</p>
<p>uneasiness. She became restless with her work; little encounters</p>
<p>with men began to happen, encounters not quite in the quality of the</p>
<p>earlier proposals; and then came an odd incident of which she told</p>
<p>me, but somehow, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3428">felt</a>, didn't tell me completely. She told me all</p>
<p>she was able to tell me. She had been at a dance at the Ropers',</p>
<p>and a man, rather well <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3429">known</a> in London, had kissed her. The thing</p>
<p>amazed her beyond measure. It was the sort of thing immediately</p>
<p>possible between any man and any woman, that one never expects to</p>
<p>happen until it happens. It had the surprising <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3430">effect</a> of a judge</p>
<p>generally <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3429">known</a> to be bald suddenly whipping off his wig in court.</p>
<p>No absolutely unexpected revelation could have quite the same</p>
<p>quality of shock. She went through the whole thing to me with a</p>
<p>remarkable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3431">detachment</a>, told me how she had felt-and the odd things</p>
<p>it seemed to open to her.</p>
<p>"I WANT to be kissed, and all that sort of thing," she avowed. "I</p>
<p>suppose every woman does."</p>
<p>She added after a pause: "And I don't want any one to do it."</p>
<p>This struck me as queerly expressive of the woman's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3432">attitude</a> to</p>
<p>these things. "Some one presently will-solve that," I said.</p>
<p>"Some one will perhaps."</p>
<p>I was silent.</p>
<p>"Some one will," she said, almost viciously. "And then we'll have</p>
<p>to stop these walks and talks of ours, dear Master… I'll be</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3433">sorry</a> to give them up."</p>
<p>"It's part of the requirements of the situation," I said, "that he</p>
<p>should be-oh, very interesting! He'll start, no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3434">doubt</a>, all sorts</p>
<p>of new topics, and open no end of attractive vistas… You</p>
<p>can't, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3435">know</a>, always go about in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3436">state</a> of pupillage."</p>
<p>"I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3437">think</a> I can," said Isabel. "But it's only just recently</p>
<p>I've begun to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3438">doubt</a> about it."</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3439">remember</a> these things <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3440">being</a> said, but just how much we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3441">saw</a> and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3442">understood</a>, and just how far we were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3443">really</a> keeping opaque to each</p>
<p>other then, I cannot <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3439">remember</a>. But it must have been quite soon</p>
<p>after this that we spent nearly a whole day together at Kew Gardens,</p>
<p>with the curtains up and the barriers down, and the thing that had</p>
<p>happened plain before our eyes. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3439">remember</a> we ever made any</p>
<p>declaration. We just assumed the new footing…</p>
<p>It was a day early in that year-I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3444">think</a> in January, because there</p>
<p>was thin, crisp snow on the grass, and we noted that only two other</p>
<p>people had been to the Pagoda that day. I've a curious impression</p>
<p>of greenish colour, hot, moist air and huge palm fronds about very</p>
<p>much of our talk, as though we were nearly all the time in the</p>
<p>Tropical House. But I also <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3445">remember</a> very vividly looking at certain</p>
<p>orange and red spray-like flowers from Patagonia, which could not</p>
<p>have been there. It is a curious thing that I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3445">remember</a> we</p>
<p>made any profession of passionate love for one another; we talked as</p>
<p>though the fact of our intense love for each other had always been</p>
<p>patent between us. There was so long and frank an intimacy between</p>
<p>us that we talked far more like brother and sister or husband and</p>
<p>wife than two people engaged in the war of the sexes. We wanted to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3446">know</a> what we were going to do, and whatever we did we meant to do in</p>
<p>the most perfect concert. We both <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3447">felt</a> an extraordinary accession</p>
<p>of friendship and tenderness then, and, what again is curious, very</p>
<p>little passion. But there was also, in spite of the perplexities we</p>
<p>faced, an immense <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3448">satisfaction</a> about that day. It was as if we had</p>
<p>taken off something that had hindered our view of each other, like</p>
<p>people who unvizard to talk more easily at a masked ball.</p>
<p>I've had since to view our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3449">relations</a> from the standpoint of the</p>
<p>ordinary observer. I find that vision in the most preposterous</p>
<p>contrast with all that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3450">really</a> went on between us. I suppose there I</p>
<p>should figure as a wicked seducer, while an unprotected girl</p>
<p>succumbed to my fascinations. As a matter of fact, it didn't occur</p>
<p>to us that there was any personal inequality between us. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3451">knew</a> her</p>
<p>for my equal mentally; in so many things she was beyond comparison</p>
<p>cleverer than I; her courage outwent mine. The quick leap of her</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3452">mind</a> evoked a flash of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3453">joy</a> in mine like the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3454">response</a> of an induction</p>
<p>wire; her way of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3455">thinking</a> was like watching sunlight reflected from</p>
<p>little waves upon the side of a boat, it was so bright, so mobile,</p>
<p>so variously and easily <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3456">true</a> to its law. In the back of our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3452">minds</a></p>
<p>we both had a very definite belief that making love is full of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3457">joyous</a>, splendid, tender, and exciting possibilities, and we had to</p>
<p>discuss why we shouldn't be to the last degree lovers.</p>
<p>Now, what I should like to print here, if it were possible, in all</p>
<p>the screaming emphasis of red ink, is this: that the circumstances</p>
<p>of my upbringing and the circumstances of Isabel's upbringing had</p>
<p>left not a shadow of belief or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3458">feeling</a> that the utmost passionate</p>
<p>love between us was in itself intrinsically WRONG. I've told with</p>
<p>the fullest particularity just all that I was taught or found out</p>
<p>for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3459">myself</a> in these matters, and Isabel's reading and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3460">thinking</a>, and</p>
<p>the fierce silences of her governesses and the breathless warnings</p>
<p>of teachers, and all the social and religious <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3461">influences</a> that had</p>
<p>been brought to bear upon her, had worked out to the same void of</p>
<p>conviction. The code had failed with us altogether. We didn't for</p>
<p>a moment consider anything but the expediency of what we both, for</p>
<p>all our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3462">quiet</a> faces and steady eyes, wanted most passionately to do.</p>
<p>Well, here you have the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3463">state</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3464">mind</a> of whole brigades of people,</p>
<p>and particularly of young people, nowadays. The current morality</p>
<p>hasn't gripped them; they don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3465">really</a> believe in it at all. They</p>
<p>may render it lip-service, but that is quite another thing. There</p>
<p>are scarcely any tolerable novels to justify its prohibitions; its</p>
<p>prohibitions do, in fact, remain unjustified amongst these ugly</p>
<p>suppressions. You may, if you choose, silence the admission of this</p>
<p>in literature and current discussion; you will not prevent it</p>
<p>working out in lives. People come up to the great moments of</p>
<p>passion crudely unaware, astoundingly unprepared as no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3465">really</a></p>
<p>civilised and intelligently planned community would let any one be</p>
<p>unprepared. They find <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3466">themselves</a> hedged about with customs that</p>
<p>have no organic hold upon them, and mere discretions all <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3467">generous</a></p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3468">spirits</a> are <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3469">disposed</a> to despise.</p>
<p>Consider the infinite absurdities of it! Multitudes of us are</p>
<p>trying to run this complex modern community on a basis of "Hush"</p>
<p>without explaining to our children or discussing with them anything</p>
<p>about love and marriage at all. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3470">Doubt</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3471">knowledge</a> creep about in</p>
<p>enforced darknesses and silences. We are living upon an ancient</p>
<p>tradition which everybody <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3470">doubts</a> and nobody has ever analysed. We</p>
<p>affect a tremendous and cultivated shyness and delicacy about</p>
<p>imperatives of the most arbitrary appearance. What ensues? What</p>
<p>did ensue with us, for example? On the one hand was a great <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3472">desire</a>,</p>
<p>robbed of any appearance of shame and grossness by the power of</p>
<p>love, and on the other hand, the possible <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3473">jealousy</a> of so and so, the</p>
<p>disapproval of so and so, material risks and dangers. It is only in</p>
<p>the retrospect that we have been able to grasp something of the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3474">effectual</a> case against us. The social prohibition lit by the</p>
<p>intense glow of our passion, presented itself as preposterous,</p>
<p>irrational, arbitrary, and ugly, a monster fit only for mockery. We</p>
<p>might be ruined! Well, there is a phase in every love affair, a</p>
<p>sort of heroic hysteria, when death and ruin are agreeable additions</p>
<p>to the prospect. It gives the business a gravity, a solemnity.</p>
<p>Timid people may hesitate and draw back with a vague instinctive</p>
<p>terror of the immensity of the oppositions they challenge, but</p>
<p>neither Isabel nor I are timid people.</p>
<p>We weighed what was against us. We decided just exactly as scores</p>
<p>of thousands of people have decided in this very matter, that if it</p>
<p>were possible to keep this thing to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3475">ourselves</a>, there was nothing</p>
<p>against it. And so we took our first step. With the hunger of love</p>
<p>in us, it was easy to conclude we might be lovers, and still keep</p>
<p>everything to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3475">ourselves</a>. That cleared our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3476">minds</a> of the one</p>
<p>persistent obstacle that mattered to us-the haunting presence of</p>
<p>Margaret.</p>
<p>And then we found, as all those scores of thousands of people</p>
<p>scattered about us have found, that we could not keep it to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3477">ourselves</a>. Love will out. All the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3478">rest</a> of this story is the</p>
<p>chronicle of that. Love with sustained secrecy cannot be love. It</p>
<p>is just exactly the point people do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3479">understand</a>.</p>

<p>5</p>
</title>
<p>But before things came to that pass, some months and many phases and</p>
<p>a sudden journey to America intervened.</p>
<p>"This thing spells disaster," I said. "You are too big and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3480">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3481">am</a> too</p>
<p>big to attempt this secrecy. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3482">Think</a> of the intolerable possibility</p>
<p>of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3483">being</a> found out! At any cost we have to stop-even at the cost</p>
<p>of parting."</p>
<p>"Just because we may be found out!"</p>
<p>"Just because we may be found out."</p>
<p>"Master, I shouldn't in the least <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3484">mind</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3485">being</a> found out with you.</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3486">I'm</a> afraid-I'd be proud."</p>
<p>"Wait till it happens."</p>
<p>There followed a struggle of immense insincerity between us. It is</p>
<p>hard to tell who urged and who resisted.</p>
<p>She came to me one night to the editorial room of the BLUE WEEKLY,</p>
<p>and argued and kissed me with wet salt lips, and wept in my arms;</p>
<p>she told me that now passionate longing for me and my intimate life</p>
<p>possessed her, so that she could not work, could not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3487">think</a>, could</p>
<p>not endure other people for the love of me…</p>
<p>I fled absurdly. That is the secret of the futile journey to</p>
<p>America that puzzled all my friends.</p>
<p>I ran away from Isabel. I took hold of the situation with all my</p>
<p>strength, put in Britten with sketchy, hasty instructions to edit</p>
<p>the paper, and started headlong and with luggage, from which, among</p>
<p>other things, my shaving things were omitted, upon a tour round the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>Preposterous flight that was! I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3488">remember</a> as a thing almost farcical</p>
<p>my explanations to Margaret, and how frantically anxious I was to</p>
<p>prevent the remote possibility of her coming with me, and how I</p>
<p>crossed in the TUSCAN, a bad, wet boat, and mixed seasickness with</p>
<p>ungovernable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3489">sorrow</a>. I wept-tears. It was inexpressibly queer and</p>
<p>ridiculous-and, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3490">good</a> God! how I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3491">hated</a> my fellow-passengers!</p>
<p>New York inflamed and excited me for a time, and when things</p>
<p>slackened, I whirled westward to Chicago-eating and drinking, I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3492">remember</a>, in the train from shoals of little dishes, with a sort of</p>
<p>desperate voracity. I did the queerest things to distract myself-</p>
<p>no novelist would dare to invent my mental and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3493">emotional</a> muddle.</p>
<p>Chicago also held me at first, amazing lapse from civilisation that</p>
<p>the place is! and then abruptly, with hosts expecting me, and</p>
<p>everything settled for some days in Denver, I found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3494">myself</a> at the</p>
<p>end of my renunciations, and turned and came back headlong to</p>
<p>London.</p>
<p>Let me confess it wasn't any sense of perfect and incurable trust</p>
<p>and confidence that brought me back, or any idea that now I had</p>
<p>strength to refrain. It was a sudden realisation that after all the</p>
<p>separation might succeed; some careless phrasing in one of her</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3495">jealously</a> read letters set that idea going in my mind-the haunting</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3496">perception</a> that I might return to London and find it empty of the</p>
<p>Isabel who had pervaded it. Honour, discretion, the careers of both</p>
<p>of us, became nothing at the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3497">thought</a>. I couldn't conceive my life</p>
<p>resuming there without Isabel. I couldn't, in short, stand it.</p>
<p>I don't even excuse my return. It is inexcusable. I ought to have</p>
<p>kept upon my way westward-and held out. I couldn't. I wanted</p>
<p>Isabel, and I wanted her so badly now that everything else in the</p>
<p>world was phantom-like until that want was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3498">satisfied</a>. Perhaps you</p>
<p>have never wanted anything like that. I went straight to her.</p>
<p>But here I come to untellable things. There is no describing the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3499">reality</a> of love. The shapes of things are nothing, the actual</p>
<p>happenings are nothing, except that somehow there falls a light upon</p>
<p>them and a wonder. Of how we met, and the thrill of the adventure,</p>
<p>the curious bright sense of defiance, the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3500">joy</a> of having dared, I</p>
<p>can't tell-I can but hint of just one aspect, of what an amazing</p>
<p>LARK-it's the only word-it seemed to us. The beauty which was the</p>
<p>essence of it, which justifies it so far as it will bear</p>
<p>justification, eludes statement.</p>
<p>What can a record of contrived meetings, of sundering difficulties</p>
<p>evaded and overcome, signify here? Or what can it convey to say</p>
<p>that one looked deep into two dear, steadfast eyes, or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3501">felt</a> a heart</p>
<p>throb and beat, or gripped soft hair softly in a trembling hand?</p>
<p>Robbed of encompassing love, these things are of no more value than</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3502">taste</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3503">good</a> wine or the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3504">sight</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3503">good</a> pictures, or the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3505">hearing</a></p>
<p>of music,-just sensuality and no more. No one can tell love-we</p>
<p>can only tell the gross facts of love and its consequences. Given</p>
<p>love-given mutuality, and one has <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3506">effected</a> a supreme synthesis and</p>
<p>come to a new level of life-but only those who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3507">know</a> can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3507">know</a>. This</p>
<p>business has brought me more <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3508">bitterness</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3509">sorrow</a> than I had ever</p>
<p>expected to bear, but even now I will not say that I regret that</p>
<p>wilful home-coming altogether. We loved-to the uttermost. Neither</p>
<p>of us could have loved any one else as we did and do love one</p>
<p>another. It was ours, that beauty; it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3510">existed</a> only between us when</p>
<p>we were close together, for no one in the world ever to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3507">know</a> save</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3511">ourselves</a>.</p>
<p>My return to the office sticks out in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3512">memory</a> with an extreme</p>
<p>vividness, because of the wild eagle of pride that screamed within</p>
<p>me. It was Tuesday morning, and though not a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3513">soul</a> in London <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3514">knew</a> of</p>
<p>it yet except Isabel, I had been back in England a week. I came in</p>
<p>upon Britten and stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>"GOD!" he said at the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3515">sight</a> of me.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3516">I'm</a> back," I said.</p>
<p>He looked at my excited face with those red-brown eyes of his.</p>
<p>Silently I defied him to speak his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3517">mind</a>.</p>
<p>"Where did you turn back?" he said at last.</p>
</section>
<section>

</title>
<p>I had to tell what were, so far as I can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3518">remember</a> my first positive</p>
<p>lies to Margaret in explaining that return. I had written to her</p>
<p>from Chicago and again from New York, saying that I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3519">felt</a> I ought to</p>
<p>be on the spot in England for the new session, and that I was coming</p>
<p>back-presently. I concealed the name of my boat from her, and made</p>
<p>a calculated prevarication when I announced my presence in London.</p>
<p>I telephoned before I went back for my rooms to be prepared. She</p>
<p>was, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3520">knew</a>, with the Bunting Harblows in Durham, and when she came</p>
<p>back to Radnor Square I had been at home a day.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3521">remember</a> her return so well.</p>
<p>My going away and the vivid secret of the present had wiped out from</p>
<p>my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3522">mind</a> much of our long estrangement. Something, too, had changed</p>
<p>in her. I had had some hint of it in her letters, but now I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3523">saw</a> it</p>
<p>plainly. I came out of my study upon the landing when I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3524">heard</a> the</p>
<p>turmoil of her arrival below, and she came upstairs with a quickened</p>
<p>gladness. It was a cold March, and she was dressed in unfamiliar</p>
<p>dark furs that suited her extremely and reinforced the delicate</p>
<p>flush of her sweet face. She held out both her hands to me, and</p>
<p>drew me to her unhesitatingly and kissed me.</p>
<p>"So glad you are back, dear," she said. "Oh! so very glad you are</p>
<p>back."</p>
<p>I returned her kiss with a queer <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3525">feeling</a> at my heart, too</p>
<p>undifferentiated to be even a definite sense of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3526">guilt</a> or meanness.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3527">think</a> it was chiefly amazement-at the universe-at <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3528">myself</a>.</p>
<p>"I never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3529">knew</a> what it was to be away from you," she said.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3530">perceived</a> suddenly that she had resolved to end our estrangement.</p>
<p>She put <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3531">herself</a> so that my arm came caressingly about her.</p>
<p>"These are jolly furs," I said.</p>
<p>"I got them for you."</p>
<p>The parlourmaid appeared below dealing with the maid and the luggage</p>
<p>cab.</p>
<p>"Tell me all about America," said Margaret. "I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3532">feel</a> as though you'd</p>
<p>been away six year's."</p>
<p>We went arm in arm into our little sitting-room, and I took off the</p>
<p>fur's for her and sat down upon the chintz-covered sofa by the fire.</p>
<p>She had ordered tea, and came and sat by me. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3533">know</a> what I</p>
<p>had expected, but of all things I had certainly not expected this</p>
<p>sudden abolition of our distances.</p>
<p>"I want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3534">know</a> all about America," she repeated, with her eyes</p>
<p>scrutinising me. "Why did you come back?"</p>
<p>I repeated the substance of my letters rather lamely, and she sat</p>
<p>listening.</p>
<p>"But why did you turn back-without going to Denver?"</p>
<p>"I wanted to come back. I was restless."</p>
<p>"Restlessness," she said, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3535">thought</a>. "You were restless in</p>
<p>Venice. You said it was restlessness took you to America."</p>
<p>Again she studied me. She turned a little awkwardly to her tea</p>
<p>things, and poured needless water from the silver kettle into the</p>
<p>teapot. Then she sat still for some moments looking at the equipage</p>
<p>with expressionless eyes. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3536">saw</a> her hand upon the edge of the table</p>
<p>tremble slightly. I watched her closely. A vague uneasiness</p>
<p>possessed me. What might she not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3537">know</a> or guess?</p>
<p>She spoke at last with an effort. "I wish you were in Parliament</p>
<p>again," she said. "Life doesn't give you events enough."</p>
<p>"If I was in Parliament again, I should be on the Conservative</p>
<p>side."</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3538">know</a>," she said, and was still more <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3539">thoughtful</a>.</p>
<p>"Lately," she began, and paused. "Lately I've been reading-you."</p>
<p>I didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3540">help</a> her out with what she had to say. I waited.</p>
<p>"I didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3541">understand</a> what you were after. I had misjudged. I</p>
<p>didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3542">know</a>. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3543">think</a> perhaps I was rather stupid." Her eyes were</p>
<p>suddenly shining with tears. "You didn't give me much chance to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3541">understand</a>."</p>
<p>She turned upon me suddenly with a voice full of tears.</p>
<p>"Husband," she said abruptly, holding her two hands out to me, "I</p>
<p>want to begin over again!"</p>
<p>I took her hands, perplexed beyond measure. "My dear!" I said.</p>
<p>"I want to begin over again."</p>
<p>I bowed my head to hide my face, and found her hand in mine and</p>
<p>kissed it.</p>
<p>"Ah!" she said, and slowly withdrew her hand. She leant forward</p>
<p>with her arm on the sofa-back, and looked very intently into my</p>
<p>face. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3544">felt</a> the most damnable scoundrel in the world as I returned</p>
<p>her gaze. The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3545">thought</a> of Isabel's darkly shining eyes seemed like a</p>
<p>physical presence between us…</p>
<p>"Tell me," I said presently, to break the intolerable tension, "tell</p>
<p>me plainly what you mean by this."</p>
<p>I sat a little away from her, and then took my teacup in hand, with</p>
<p>an odd <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3546">effect</a> of defending <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3547">myself</a>. "Have you been reading that old</p>
<p>book of mine?" I asked.</p>
<p>"That and the paper. I took a complete set from the beginning down</p>
<p>to Durham with me. I have read it over, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3548">thought</a> it over. I didn't</p>
<p>understand-what you were teaching."</p>
<p>There was a little pause.</p>
<p>"It all seems so plain to me now," she said, "and so <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3549">true</a>."</p>
<p>I was profoundly disconcerted. I put down my teacup, stood up in</p>
<p>the middle of the hearthrug, and began talking. "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3550">I'm</a> tremendously</p>
<p>glad, Margaret, that you've come to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3551">see</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3550">I'm</a> not altogether</p>
<p>perverse," I began. I launched out into a rather trite and windy</p>
<p>exposition of my views, and she sat close to me on the sofa, looking</p>
<p>up into my face, hanging on my words, a deliberate and invincible</p>
<p>convert.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, "yes."…</p>
<p>I had never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3552">doubted</a> my new conceptions before; now I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3552">doubted</a> them</p>
<p>profoundly. But I went on talking. It's the grim irony in the</p>
<p>lives of all politicians, writers, public teachers, that once the</p>
<p>audience is at their feet, a new loyalty has gripped them. It isn't</p>
<p>their business to admit <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3552">doubt</a> and imperfections. They have to go on</p>
<p>talking. And I was now so accustomed to Isabel's vivid interruptions,</p>
<p>qualifications, restatements, and confirmations…</p>
<p>Margaret and I dined together at home. She made me open out my</p>
<p>political projects to her. "I have been foolish," she said. "I</p>
<p>want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3553">help</a>."</p>
<p>And by some excuse I have forgotten she made me come to her room. I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3554">think</a> it was some book I had to take her, some American book I had</p>
<p>brought back with me, and mentioned in our talk. I walked in with</p>
<p>it, and put it down on the table and turned to go.</p>
<p>"Husband!" she cried, and held out her slender arms to me. I was</p>
<p>compelled to go to her and kiss her, and she twined them softly</p>
<p>about my neck and drew me to her and kissed me. I disentangled them</p>
<p>very gently, and took each wrist and kissed it, and the backs of her</p>
<p>hands.</p>
<p>"Good-night," I said. There came a little pause. "Good-night,</p>
<p>Margaret," I repeated, and walked very deliberately and with a kind</p>
<p>of sham preoccupation to the door.</p>
<p>I did not look at her, but I could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3555">feel</a> her standing, watching me.</p>
<p>If I had looked up, she would, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3556">knew</a>, have held out her arms to</p>
<p>me…</p>
<p>At the very outset that secret, which was to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3557">touch</a> no one but Isabel</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3558">myself</a>, had reached out to stab another human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3559">being</a>.</p>

<p>The whole world had changed for Isabel and me; and we tried to</p>
<p>pretend that nothing had changed except a small matter between us.</p>
<p>We believed quite honestly at that time that it was possible to keep</p>
<p>this thing that had happened from any reaction at all, save perhaps</p>
<p>through some magically enhanced vigour in our work, upon the world</p>
<p>about us! <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3560">Seen</a> in retrospect, one can realise the absurdity of this</p>
<p>belief; within a week I realised it; but that does not alter the</p>
<p>fact that we did believe as much, and that people who are deeply in</p>
<p>love and unable to marry will <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3561">continue</a> to believe so to the very end</p>
<p>of time. They will <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3561">continue</a> to believe out of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3562">existence</a> every</p>
<p>consideration that separates them until they have come together.</p>
<p>Then they will count the cost, as we two had to do.</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3563">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3564">am</a> telling a story, and not propounding theories in this book; and</p>
<p>chiefly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3563">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3564">am</a> telling of the ideas and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3565">influences</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3566">emotions</a> that</p>
<p>have happened to me-me as a sort of sounding board for my world.</p>
<p>The moralist is at liberty to go over my conduct with his measure</p>
<p>and say, "At this point or at that you went wrong, and you ought to</p>
<p>have done"-so-and-so. The point of interest to the statesman is</p>
<p>that it didn't for a moment occur to us to do so-and-so when the</p>
<p>time for doing it came. It amazes me now to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3567">think</a> how little either</p>
<p>of us troubled about the established rights or wrongs of the</p>
<p>situation. We hadn't an atom of respect for them, innate or</p>
<p>acquired. The guardians of public morals will say we were very bad</p>
<p>people; I submit in defence that they are very bad guardians-</p>
<p>provocative guardians… And when at last there came a claim</p>
<p>against us that had an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3568">effective</a> validity for us, we were in the</p>
<p>full tide of passionate intimacy.</p>
<p>I had a night of nearly sleepless perplexity after Margaret's</p>
<p>return. She had suddenly presented <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3569">herself</a> to me like something</p>
<p>dramatically recalled, fine, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3570">generous</a>, infinitely capable of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3571">feeling</a>. I was amazed how much I had forgotten her. In my contempt</p>
<p>for vulgarised and conventionalised honour I had forgotten that for</p>
<p>me there was such a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3572">reality</a> as honour. And here it was, warm and</p>
<p>near to me, living, breathing, unsuspecting. Margaret's pride was</p>
<p>my honour, that I had had no right even to imperil.</p>
<p>I do not now <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3573">remember</a> if I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3574">thought</a> at that time of going to Isabel</p>
<p>and putting this new aspect of the case before her. Perhaps I did.</p>
<p>Perhaps I may have considered even then the possibility of ending</p>
<p>what had so freshly and passionately begun. If I did, it vanished</p>
<p>next day at the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3575">sight</a> of her. Whatever regrets came in the</p>
<p>darkness, the daylight brought an obstinate confidence in our</p>
<p>resolution again. We would, we declared, "pull the thing off."</p>
<p>Margaret must not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3576">know</a>. Margaret should not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3576">know</a>. If Margaret did</p>
<p>not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3576">know</a>, then no harm whatever would be done. We tried to sustain</p>
<p>that…</p>
<p>For a brief time we had been like two people in a magic cell,</p>
<p>magically cut off from the world and full of a light of its own, and</p>
<p>then we began to realise that we were not in the least cut off, that</p>
<p>the world was all about us and pressing in upon us, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3577">limiting</a> us,</p>
<p>threatening us, resuming possession of us. I tried to ignore the</p>
<p>injury to Margaret of her unreciprocated advances. I tried to</p>
<p>maintain to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3578">myself</a> that this hidden love made no difference to the</p>
<p>now irreparable breach between husband and wife. But I never spoke</p>
<p>of it to Isabel or let her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3579">see</a> that aspect of our case. How could</p>
<p>I? The time for that had gone…</p>
<p>Then in new shapes and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3580">relations</a> came trouble. Distressful elements</p>
<p>crept in by reason of our unavoidable furtiveness; we ignored them,</p>
<p>hid them from each other, and attempted to hide them from <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3581">ourselves</a>.</p>
<p>Successful love is a thing of abounding pride, and we had to be</p>
<p>secret. It was delightful at first to be secret, a whispering, warm</p>
<p>conspiracy; then presently it became irksome and a little shameful.</p>
<p>Her essential frankness of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3582">soul</a> was all against the masks and</p>
<p>falsehoods that many women would have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3583">enjoyed</a>. Together in our</p>
<p>secrecy we relaxed, then in the presence of other people again it</p>
<p>was tiresome to have to watch for the careless, too easy phrase, to</p>
<p>snatch back one's hand from the limitless betrayal of a light,</p>
<p>familiar <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3584">touch</a>.</p>
<p>Love becomes a poor thing, at best a poor beautiful thing, if it</p>
<p>develops no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3585">continuing</a> and habitual intimacy. We were always</p>
<p>meeting, and most gloriously loving and beginning-and then we had</p>
<p>to snatch at remorseless ticking watches, hurry to catch trains, and</p>
<p>go back to this or that. That is all very well for the intrigues of</p>
<p>idle people perhaps, but not for an intense personal <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3586">relationship</a>.</p>
<p>It is like lighting a candle for the sake of lighting it, over and</p>
<p>over again, and each time blowing it out. That, no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3587">doubt</a>, must be</p>
<p>very amusing to children playing with the matches, but not to people</p>
<p>who love warm light, and want it in order to do fine and honourable</p>
<p>things together. We had achieved-I give the ugly phrase that</p>
<p>expresses the increasing discolouration in my mind-"illicit</p>
<p>intercourse." To end at that, we now <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3588">perceived</a>, wasn't in our</p>
<p>style. But where were we to end?…</p>
<p>Perhaps we might at this stage have given it up. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3589">think</a> if we</p>
<p>could have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3590">seen</a> ahead and around us we might have done so. But the</p>
<p>glow of our cell blinded us… I wonder what might have</p>
<p>happened if at that time we had given it up… We propounded</p>
<p>it, we met again in secret to discuss it, and our overpowering</p>
<p>passion for one another reduced that meeting to absurdity…</p>
<p>Presently the idea of children crept between us. It came in from</p>
<p>all our conceptions of life and public service; it was, we found, in</p>
<p>the quality of our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3591">minds</a> that physical love without children is a</p>
<p>little weak, timorous, more than a little shameful. With</p>
<p>imaginative people there very speedily comes a time when that</p>
<p>realisation is inevitable. We hadn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3592">thought</a> of that before-it</p>
<p>isn't natural to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3593">think</a> of that before. We hadn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3594">known</a>. There is</p>
<p>no literature in English dealing with such things.</p>
<p>There is a necessary sequence of phases in love. These came in</p>
<p>their order, and with them, unanticipated tarnishings on the first</p>
<p>bright perfection of our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3595">relations</a>. For a time these developing</p>
<p>phases were no more than a secret and private trouble between us,</p>
<p>little shadows spreading by imperceptible degrees across that vivid</p>
<p>and luminous cell.</p>

<p>The Handitch election flung me suddenly into prominence.</p>
<p>It is still only two years since that struggle, and I will not</p>
<p>trouble the reader with a detailed history of events that must be</p>
<p>quite sufficiently present in his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3596">mind</a> for my purpose already. Huge</p>
<p>stacks of journalism have dealt with Handitch and its significance.</p>
<p>For the reader very probably, as for most people outside a</p>
<p>comparatively small circle, it meant my emergence from obscurity.</p>
<p>We obtruded no editor's name in the BLUE WEEKLY; I had never as yet</p>
<p>been on the London hoardings. Before Handitch I was a journalist</p>
<p>and writer of no great public standing; after Handitch, I was</p>
<p>definitely a person, in the little group of persons who stood for</p>
<p>the Young Imperialist movement. Handitch was, to a very large</p>
<p>extent, my affair. I realised then, as a man comes to do, how much</p>
<p>one can still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3597">grow</a> after seven and twenty. In the second election I</p>
<p>was a man taking hold of things; at Kinghamstead I had been simply a</p>
<p>young candidate, a party unit, led about the constituency, told to</p>
<p>do this and that, and finally washed in by the great Anti-</p>
<p>Imperialist flood, like a starfish rolling up a beach.</p>
<p>My feminist views had earnt the mistrust of the party, and I do not</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3598">think</a> I should have got the chance of Handitch or indeed any chance</p>
<p>at all of Parliament for a long time, if it had not been that the</p>
<p>seat with its long record of Liberal victories and its Liberal</p>
<p>majority of 3642 at the last election, offered a hopeless contest.</p>
<p>The Liberal dissensions and the belated but by no means contemptible</p>
<p>Socialist candidate were providential interpositions. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3598">think</a>,</p>
<p>however, the conduct of Gane, Crupp, and Tarvrille in coming down to</p>
<p>fight for me, did count tremendously in my favour. "We aren't going</p>
<p>to win, perhaps," said Crupp, "but we are going to talk." And until</p>
<p>the very eve of victory, we treated Handitch not so much as a</p>
<p>battlefield as a hoarding. And so it was the Endowment of</p>
<p>Motherhood as a practical <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3599">form</a> of Eugenics got into English</p>
<p>politics.</p>
<p>Plutus, our agent, was scared out of his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3600">wits</a> when the thing began.</p>
<p>"They're ascribing all sorts of queer ideas to you about the</p>
<p>Family," he said.</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3601">think</a> the Family <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3602">exists</a> for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3603">good</a> of the children," I said;</p>
<p>"is that queer?"</p>
<p>"Not when you explain it-but they won't let you explain it. And</p>
<p>about marriage-?"</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3604">I'm</a> all right about marriage-trust me."</p>
<p>"Of course, if YOU had children," said Plutus, rather</p>
<p>inconsiderately…</p>
<p>They opened fire upon me in a little electioneering rag call the</p>
<p>HANDITCH SENTINEL, with a string of garbled quotations and</p>
<p>misrepresentations that gave me an admirable text for a speech. I</p>
<p>spoke for an hour and ten minutes with a more and more crumpled copy</p>
<p>of the SENTINEL in my hand, and I made the fullest and completest</p>
<p>exposition of the idea of endowing motherhood that I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3605">think</a> had ever</p>
<p>been made up to that time in England. Its <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3606">effect</a> on the press was</p>
<p>extraordinary. The Liberal papers gave me quite unprecedented space</p>
<p>under the impression that I had only to be given rope to hang</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3607">myself</a>; the Conservatives cut me down or tried to justify me; the</p>
<p>whole country was talking. I had had a pamphlet in type upon the</p>
<p>subject, and I revised this carefully and put it on the book-stalls</p>
<p>within three days. It sold enormously and brought me bushels of</p>
<p>letters. We issued over three thousand in Handitch <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3608">alone</a>. At</p>
<p>meeting after meeting I was heckled upon nothing else. Long before</p>
<p>polling day Plutus was converted.</p>
<p>"It's catching on like old age pensions," he said. "We've dished</p>
<p>the Liberals! To <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3609">think</a> that such a project should come from our</p>
<p>side!"</p>
<p>But it was only with the declaration of the poll that my battle was</p>
<p>won. No one expected more than a snatch victory, and I was in by</p>
<p>over fifteen hundred. At one bound Cossington's papers passed from</p>
<p>apologetics varied by repudiation to triumphant praise. "A</p>
<p>renascent England, breeding men," said the leader in his chief daily</p>
<p>on the morning after the polling, and claimed that the Conservatives</p>
<p>had been ever the pioneers in sanely bold constructive projects.</p>
<p>I came up to London with a weary but rejoicing Margaret by the night</p>
<p>train.</p>

<p>To any one who did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3610">know</a> of that glowing secret between Isabel</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3611">myself</a>, I might well have appeared at that time the most</p>
<p>successful and enviable of men. I had recovered rapidly from an</p>
<p>uncongenial start in political life; I had become a considerable</p>
<p>force through the BLUE WEEKLY, and was shaping an increasingly</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3612">influential</a> body of opinion; I had re-entered Parliament with quite</p>
<p>dramatic distinction, and in spite of a certain faltering on the</p>
<p>part of the orthodox Conservatives towards the bolder elements in</p>
<p>our propaganda, I had loyal and unenvious associates who were making</p>
<p>me a power in the party. People were coming to our group,</p>
<p>understandings were developing. It was clear we should play a</p>
<p>prominent part in the next general election, and that, given a</p>
<p>Conservative victory, I should be assured of office. The world</p>
<p>opened out to me brightly and invitingly. Great schemes took shape</p>
<p>in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3613">mind</a>, always more concrete, always more practicable; the years</p>
<p>ahead seemed falling into order, shining with the credible promise</p>
<p>of immense achievement.</p>
<p>And at the heart of it all, unseen and unsuspected, was the secret</p>
<p>of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3614">relations</a> with Isabel-like a seed that germinates and</p>
<p>thrusts, thrusts relentlessly.</p>
<p>From the onset of the Handitch contest onward, my meetings with her</p>
<p>had been more and more pervaded by the discussion of our situation.</p>
<p>It had innumerable aspects. It was very present to us that we</p>
<p>wanted to be together as much as possible-we were beginning to long</p>
<p>very much for actual living together in the same house, so that one</p>
<p>could come as it were carelessly-unawares-upon the other, busy</p>
<p>perhaps about some trivial thing. We wanted to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3615">feel</a> each other in</p>
<p>the daily atmosphere. Preceding our imperatively sterile passion,</p>
<p>you must <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3616">remember</a>, outside it, altogether greater than it so far as</p>
<p>our individual lives were concerned, there had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3617">grown</a> and still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3618">grew</a></p>
<p>an enormous affection and intellectual sympathy between us. We</p>
<p>brought all our impressions and all our ideas to each other, to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3619">see</a></p>
<p>them in each other's light. It is hard to convey that quality of</p>
<p>intellectual unison to any one who has not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3620">experienced</a> it. I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3621">thought</a> more and more in terms of conversation with Isabel; her</p>
<p>possible comments upon things would flash into my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3622">mind</a>, oh!-with</p>
<p>the very sound of her voice.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3623">remember</a>, too, the odd <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3624">effect</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3625">seeing</a> her in the distance going</p>
<p>about Handitch, like any stranger canvasser; the queer <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3626">emotion</a> of</p>
<p>her approach along the street, the greeting as she passed. The</p>
<p>morning of the polling she vanished from the constituency. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3627">saw</a></p>
<p>her for an instant in the passage behind our Committee rooms.</p>
<p>"Going?" said I.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"Stay it out. I want you to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3628">see</a> the fun. I remember-the other</p>
<p>time."</p>
<p>She didn't answer for a moment or so, and stood with face averted.</p>
<p>"It's Margaret's show," she said abruptly. "If I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3629">see</a> her smiling</p>
<p>there like a queen by your side-! She did-last time. I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3630">remember</a>." She caught at a sob and dashed her hand across her face</p>
<p>impatiently. "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3631">Jealous</a> fool, mean and petty, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3631">jealous</a> fool!…</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3632">Good</a> luck, old man, to you! You're going to win. But I don't want</p>
<p>to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3629">see</a> the end of it all the same…"</p>
<p>"Good-bye!" said I, clasping her hand as some supporter appeared in</p>
<p>the passage…</p>
<p>I came back to London victorious, and a little flushed and coarse</p>
<p>with victory; and so soon as I could break away I went to Isabel's</p>
<p>flat and found her white and worn, with the stain of secret weeping</p>
<p>about her eyes. I came into the room to her and shut the door.</p>
<p>"You said I'd win," I said, and held out my arms.</p>
<p>She hugged me closely for a moment.</p>
<p>"My dear," I whispered, "it's nothing-without you-nothing!"</p>
<p>We didn't speak for some seconds. Then she slipped from my hold.</p>
<p>"Look!" she said, smiling like winter sunshine. "I've had in all</p>
<p>the morning papers-the pile of them, and you-resounding."</p>
<p>"It's more than I dared hope."</p>
<p>"Or I."</p>
<p>She stood for a moment still smiling bravely, and then she was</p>
<p>sobbing in my arms. "The bigger you are-the more you show," she</p>
<p>said-" the more we are parted. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3633">know</a>, I know-"</p>
<p>I held her close to me, making no answer.</p>
<p>Presently she became still. "Oh, well," she said, and wiped her</p>
<p>eyes and sat down on the little sofa by the fire; and I sat down</p>
<p>beside her.</p>
<p>"I didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3634">know</a> all there was in love," she said, staring at the</p>
<p>coals, "when we went love-making."</p>
<p>I put my arm behind her and took a handful of her dear soft hair in</p>
<p>my hand and kissed it.</p>
<p>"You've done a great thing this time," she said. "Handitch will</p>
<p>make you."</p>
<p>"It opens big chances," I said. "But why are you weeping, dear</p>
<p>one?"</p>
<p>"Envy," she said, "and love."</p>
<p>"You're not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3635">lonely</a>?"</p>
<p>"I've plenty to do-and lots of people."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"I want you."</p>
<p>"You've got me."</p>
<p>She put her arm about me and kissed me. "I want you," she said,</p>
<p>"just as if I had nothing of you. You don't understand-how a woman</p>
<p>wants a man. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3636">thought</a> once if I just gave <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3637">myself</a> to you it would</p>
<p>be enough. It was nothing-it was just a step across the threshold.</p>
<p>My dear, every moment you are away I ache for you-ache! I want to</p>
<p>be about when it isn't love-making or talk. I want to be doing</p>
<p>things for you, and watching you when you're not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3638">thinking</a> of me.</p>
<p>All those safe, careless, intimate things. And something else-"</p>
<p>She stopped. "Dear, I don't want to bother you. I just want you to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3639">know</a> I love you…"</p>
<p>She caught my head in her hands and kissed it, then stood up</p>
<p>abruptly.</p>
<p>I looked up at her, a little perplexed.</p>
<p>"Dear heart," said I, "isn't this enough? You're my councillor, my</p>
<p>colleague, my right hand, the secret <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3640">soul</a> of my life-"</p>
<p>"And I want to darn your socks," she said, smiling back at me.</p>
<p>"You're insatiable."</p>
<p>She smiled "No," she said. "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3641">I'm</a> not insatiable, Master. But <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3641">I'm</a> a</p>
<p>woman in love. And <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3641">I'm</a> finding out what I want, and what is</p>
<p>necessary to me-and what I can't have. That's all."</p>
<p>"We get a lot."</p>
<p>"We want a lot. You and I are greedy people for the things we like,</p>
<p>Master. It's very evident we've got nearly all we can ever have of</p>
<p>one another-and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3642">I'm</a> not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3643">satisfied</a>."</p>
<p>"What more is there?</p>
<p>"For you-very little. I wonder. For me-every thing. Yes-</p>
<p>everything. You didn't mean it, Master; you didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3644">know</a> any more</p>
<p>than I did when I began, but love between a man and a woman is</p>
<p>sometimes very one-sided. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3645">Fearfully</a> one-sided! That's all…"</p>
<p>"Don't YOU ever want children?" she said abruptly.</p>
<p>"I suppose I do."</p>
<p>"You don't!"</p>
<p>"I haven't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3646">thought</a> of them."</p>
<p>"A man doesn't, perhaps. But I have… I want them-like</p>
<p>hunger. YOUR children, and home with you. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3647">Really</a>, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3648">continually</a> you!</p>
<p>That's the trouble… I can't have 'em, Master, and I can't</p>
<p>have you."</p>
<p>She was crying, and through her tears she laughed.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3649">I'm</a> going to make a scene," she said, "and get this over. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3649">I'm</a> so</p>
<p>discontented and miserable; I've got to tell you. It would come</p>
<p>between us if I didn't. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3649">I'm</a> in love with you, with everything-with</p>
<p>all my brains. I'll pull through all right. I'll be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3650">good</a>, Master,</p>
<p>never you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3651">fear</a>. But to-day <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3649">I'm</a> crying out with all my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3652">being</a>. This</p>
<p>election-You're going up; you're going on. In these papers-you're</p>
<p>a great big fact. It's suddenly come home to me. At the back of my</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3653">mind</a> I've always had the idea I was going to have you somehow</p>
<p>presently for myself-I mean to have you to go long tramps with, to</p>
<p>keep house for, to get meals for, to watch for of an evening. It's</p>
<p>a sort of habitual background to my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3654">thought</a> of you. And it's</p>
<p>nonsense-utter nonsense!" She stopped. She was crying and</p>
<p>choking. "And the child, you know-the child!"</p>
<p>I was troubled beyond measure, but Handitch and its intimations were</p>
<p>clear and strong.</p>
<p>"We can't have that," I said.</p>
<p>"No," she said, "we can't have that."</p>
<p>"We've got our own things to do."</p>
<p>"YOUR things," she said.</p>
<p>"Aren't they yours too?"</p>
<p>"Because of you," she said.</p>
<p>"Aren't they your very own things?"</p>
<p>"Women don't have that sort of very own thing. Indeed, it's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3655">true</a>!</p>
<p>And <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3656">think</a>! You've been down there preaching the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3657">goodness</a> of</p>
<p>children, telling them the only <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3658">good</a> thing in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3659">state</a> is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3660">happy</a>,</p>
<p>hopeful children, working to free mothers and children-"</p>
<p>"And we give our own children to do it?" I said.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said. "And sometimes I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3661">think</a> it's too much to give-too</p>
<p>much altogether… Children get into a woman's brain-when she</p>
<p>mustn't have them, especially when she must never hope for them.</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3661">Think</a> of the child we might have now!-the little creature with</p>
<p>soft, tender skin, and little hands and little feet! At times it</p>
<p>haunts me. It comes and says, Why wasn't I given life? I can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3662">hear</a></p>
<p>it in the night… The world is full of such little ghosts,</p>
<p>dear lover-little things that asked for life and were refused.</p>
<p>They clamour to me. It's like a little fist beating at my heart.</p>
<p>Love children, beautiful children. Little cold hands that tear at</p>
<p>my heart! Oh, my heart and my lord!" She was holding my arm with</p>
<p>both her hands and weeping against it, and now she drew <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3663">herself</a> to</p>
<p>my shoulder and wept and sobbed in my embrace. "I shall never sit</p>
<p>with your child on my knee and you beside me-never, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3664">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3665">am</a> a woman</p>
<p>and your lover!…"</p>

<p>2</p>
</title>
<p>But the profound impossibility of our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3666">relation</a> was now becoming more</p>
<p>and more apparent to us. We found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3667">ourselves</a> seeking justification,</p>
<p>clinging passionately to a situation that was coldly, pitilessly,</p>
<p>impossible and fated. We wanted quite intensely to live together</p>
<p>and have a child, but also we wanted very many other things that</p>
<p>were incompatible with these <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3668">desires</a>. It was extraordinarily</p>
<p>difficult to weigh our political and intellectual ambitions against</p>
<p>those intimate wishes. The weights kept altering according as one</p>
<p>found oneself grasping this valued thing or that. It wasn't as if</p>
<p>we could throw everything aside for our love, and have that as we</p>
<p>wanted it. Love such as we bore one another isn't altogether, or</p>
<p>even chiefly, a thing in itself-it is for the most part a value set</p>
<p>upon things. Our love was interwoven with all our other interests;</p>
<p>to go out of the world and live in isolation seemed to us like</p>
<p>killing the best parts of each other; we loved the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3669">sight</a> of each</p>
<p>other engaged finely and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3670">characteristically</a>, we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3671">knew</a> each other best</p>
<p>as activities. We had no delusions about material facts; we didn't</p>
<p>want each other alive or dead, we wanted each other fully alive. We</p>
<p>wanted to do big things together, and for us to take each other</p>
<p>openly and desperately would leave us nothing in the world to do.</p>
<p>We wanted children indeed passionately, but children with every</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3672">helpful</a> chance in the world, and children born in scandal would be</p>
<p>handicapped at every turn. We wanted to share a home, and not a</p>
<p>solitude.</p>
<p>And when we were at this stage of realisation, began the intimations</p>
<p>that we were found out, and that scandal was afoot against us…</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3673">heard</a> of it first from Esmeer, who deliberately mentioned it, with</p>
<p>that steady grey eye of his watching me, as an instance of the</p>
<p>preposterous falsehoods people will circulate. It came to Isabel</p>
<p>almost simultaneously through a married college friend, who made it</p>
<p>her business to demand either confirmation or denial. It filled us</p>
<p>both with consternation. In the surprise of the moment Isabel</p>
<p>admitted her secret, and her friend went off "reserving her freedom</p>
<p>of action."</p>
<p>Discovery broke out in every direction. Friends with grave faces</p>
<p>and an atmosphere of infinite tact invaded us both. Other friends</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3674">ceased</a> to invade either of us. It was manifest we had become-we</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3675">knew</a> not how-a private scandal, a subject for duologues, an</p>
<p>amazement, a perplexity, a vivid interest. In a few brief weeks it</p>
<p>seemed London passed from <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3676">absolute</a> unsuspiciousness to a chattering</p>
<p>exaggeration of its <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3677">knowledge</a> of our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3678">relations</a>.</p>
<p>It was just the most inappropriate time for that disclosure. The</p>
<p>long smouldering antagonism to my endowment of motherhood ideas had</p>
<p>flared up into an active campaign in the EXPURGATOR, and it would be</p>
<p>altogether disastrous to us if I should be convicted of any personal</p>
<p>irregularity. It was just because of the manifest and challenging</p>
<p>respectability of my position that I had been able to carry the</p>
<p>thing as far as I had done. Now suddenly my fortunes had sprung a</p>
<p>leak, and scandal was pouring in… It chanced, too, that a</p>
<p>wave of moral intolerance was sweeping through London, one of those</p>
<p>waves in which the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3679">bitterness</a> of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3680">consciously</a> just finds an ally</p>
<p>in the panic of the undiscovered. A certain Father Blodgett had</p>
<p>been preaching against social corruption with extraordinary force,</p>
<p>and had roused the Church of England people to a kind of competition</p>
<p>in denunciation. The old methods of the Anti-Socialist campaign had</p>
<p>been renewed, and had offered far too wide a scope and too tempting</p>
<p>an opportunity for private animosity, to be restricted to the</p>
<p>private affairs of the Socialists. I had intimations of an</p>
<p>extensive circulation of "private and confidential" letters…</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3681">think</a> there can be nothing else in life quite like the unnerving</p>
<p>realisation that rumour and scandal are afoot about one. Abruptly</p>
<p>one's confidence in the solidity of the universe disappears. One</p>
<p>walks silenced through a world that one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3682">feels</a> to be full of</p>
<p>inaudible accusations. One cannot challenge the assault, get it out</p>
<p>into the open, separate <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3683">truth</a> and falsehood. It slinks from you,</p>
<p>turns aside its face. Old acquaintances suddenly evaded me, made</p>
<p>extraordinary excuses; men who had presumed on the verge of my world</p>
<p>and pestered me with an intrusive enterprise, now took the bold step</p>
<p>of flat repudiation. I became <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3684">doubtful</a> about the return of a nod,</p>
<p>retracted all those tentacles of easy civility that I had hitherto</p>
<p>spread to the world. I still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3685">grow</a> warm with amazed indignation when</p>
<p>I recall that Edward Crampton, meeting me full on the steps of the</p>
<p>Climax Club, cut me dead. "By God!" I cried, and came near catching</p>
<p>him by the throat and wringing out of him what of all <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3686">good</a> deeds and</p>
<p>bad, could hearten him, a younger man than I and empty beyond</p>
<p>comparison, to dare to play the judge to me. And then I had an open</p>
<p>slight from Mrs. Millingham, whom I had counted on as one counts</p>
<p>upon the sunrise. I had not expected things of that sort; they were</p>
<p>disconcerting beyond measure; it was as if the world were giving way</p>
<p>beneath my feet, as though something failed in the essential</p>
<p>confidence of life, as though a hand of wet ice had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3687">touched</a> my</p>
<p>heart. Similar things were happening to Isabel. Yet we went on</p>
<p>working, visiting, meeting, trying to ignore this gathering of</p>
<p>implacable forces against us.</p>
<p>For a time I was perplexed beyond measure to account for this</p>
<p>campaign. Then I got a clue. The centre of diffusion was the</p>
<p>Bailey household. The Baileys had never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3688">forgiven</a> me my abandonment</p>
<p>of the young Liberal group they had done so much to inspire and</p>
<p>organise; their dinner-table had long been a scene of hostile</p>
<p>depreciation of the BLUE WEEKLY and all its allies; week after week</p>
<p>Altiora proclaimed that I was "doing nothing," and found other</p>
<p>causes for our bye-election triumphs; I counted Chambers Street a</p>
<p>dangerous place for me. Yet, nevertheless, I was astonished to find</p>
<p>them using a private scandal against me. They did. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3689">think</a></p>
<p>Handitch had filled up the measure of their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3690">bitterness</a>, for I had</p>
<p>not only abandoned them, but I was succeeding beyond even their</p>
<p>power of misrepresentation. Always I had been a wasp in their</p>
<p>spider's web, difficult to claim as a tool, uncritical,</p>
<p>antagonistic. I admired their work and devotion enormously, but I</p>
<p>had never concealed my contempt for a certain childish vanity they</p>
<p>displayed, and for the frequent puerility of their political</p>
<p>intrigues. I suppose contempt galls more than injuries, and anyhow</p>
<p>they had me now. They had me. Bailey, I found, was warning fathers</p>
<p>of girls against me as a "reckless libertine," and Altiora, flushed,</p>
<p>roguish, and dishevelled, was sitting on her fender curb after</p>
<p>dinner, and pledging little parties of five or six women at a time</p>
<p>with infinite gusto not to let the matter go further. Our cell was</p>
<p>open to the world, and a bleak, distressful daylight streaming in.</p>
<p>I had a gleam of a more intimate motive in Altiora from the reports</p>
<p>that came to me. Isabel had been doing a series of five or six</p>
<p>articles in the POLITICAL REVIEW in support of our campaign, the</p>
<p>POLITICAL REVIEW which had hitherto been loyally Baileyite. Quite</p>
<p>her best writing up to the present, at any rate, is in those papers,</p>
<p>and no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3691">doubt</a> Altiora had had not only to read her in those invaded</p>
<p>columns, but listen to her praises in the mouths of the tactless</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3692">influential</a>. Altiora, like so many people who rely on gesture and</p>
<p>vocal insistence in conversation, writes a poor and slovenly prose</p>
<p>and handles an argument badly; Isabel has her University training</p>
<p>behind her and wrote from the first with the stark power of a clear-</p>
<p>headed man. "Now we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3693">know</a>," said Altiora, with just a gleam of</p>
<p>malice showing through her brightness, "now we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3693">know</a> who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3694">helps</a> with</p>
<p>the writing!"</p>
<p>She revealed astonishing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3695">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>For a time I couldn't for the life of me discover her sources. I</p>
<p>had, indeed, a desperate intention of challenging her, and then I</p>
<p>bethought me of a youngster named Curmain, who had been my</p>
<p>supplemental typist and secretary for a time, and whom I had sent on</p>
<p>to her before the days of our breach. "Of course!" said I,</p>
<p>"Curmain!" He was a tall, drooping, sidelong youth with sandy hair,</p>
<p>a little forward head, and a long thin neck. He stole stamps, and,</p>
<p>I suspected, rifled my private letter drawer, and I found him one</p>
<p>day on a turn of the stairs looking <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3696">guilty</a> and ruffled with a pretty</p>
<p>Irish housemaid of Margaret's manifestly in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3697">state</a> of hot</p>
<p>indignation. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3698">saw</a> nothing, but I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3699">felt</a> everything in the air</p>
<p>between them. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3700">hate</a> this pestering of servants, but at the same</p>
<p>time I didn't want Curmain wiped out of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3701">existence</a>, so I had packed</p>
<p>him off without unnecessary discussion to Altiora. He was quick and</p>
<p>cheap anyhow, and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3702">thought</a> her general austerity ought to redeem</p>
<p>him if anything could; the Chambers Street housemaid wasn't for any</p>
<p>man's kissing and showed it, and the stamps and private letters were</p>
<p>looked after with an efficiency altogether surpassing mine. And</p>
<p>Altiora, I've no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3703">doubt</a> left now whatever, pumped this young</p>
<p>undesirable about me, and scenting a story, had him to dinner <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3704">alone</a></p>
<p>one evening to get to the bottom of the matter. She got quite to</p>
<p>the bottom of it,-it must have been a queer duologue. She read</p>
<p>Isabel's careless, intimate letters to me, so to speak, by this</p>
<p>proxy, and she wasn't ashamed to use this information in the service</p>
<p>of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3705">bitterness</a> that had sprung up in her since our political</p>
<p>breach. It was essentially a personal <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3705">bitterness</a>; it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3706">helped</a> no</p>
<p>public purpose of theirs to get rid of me. My downfall in any</p>
<p>public sense was sheer waste,-the loss of a man. She <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3707">knew</a> she was</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3708">behaving</a> badly, and so, when it came to remonstrance, she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3708">behaved</a></p>
<p>worse. She'd got names and dates and places; the efficiency of her</p>
<p>information was irresistible. And she set to work at it</p>
<p>marvellously. Never before, in all her pursuit of efficient ideals,</p>
<p>had Altiora achieved such levels of efficiency. I wrote a protest</p>
<p>that was perhaps ill-advised and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3709">angry</a>, I went to her and tried to</p>
<p>stop her. She wouldn't listen, she wouldn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3710">think</a>, she denied and</p>
<p>lied, she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3708">behaved</a> like a naughty child of six years old which has</p>
<p>made up its <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3711">mind</a> to be hurtful. It wasn't only, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3710">think</a>, that she</p>
<p>couldn't bear our political and social <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3712">influence</a>; she also-I</p>
<p>realised at that interview couldn't bear our loving. It seemed to</p>
<p>her the sickliest thing,-a thing quite unendurable. While such</p>
<p>things were, the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3713">virtue</a> had gone out of her world.</p>
<p>I've the vividest <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3714">memory</a> of that call of mine. She'd just come in</p>
<p>and taken off her hat, and she was grey and dishevelled and tired,</p>
<p>and in a business-like dress of black and crimson that didn't suit</p>
<p>her and was muddy about the skirts; she'd a cold in her head and</p>
<p>sniffed penetratingly, she avoided my eye as she talked and</p>
<p>interrupted everything I had to say; she kept stabbing fiercely at</p>
<p>the cushions of her sofa with a long hat-pin and pretending she was</p>
<p>overwhelmed with grief at the DEBACLE she was deliberately</p>
<p>organising.</p>
<p>"Then part," she cried, "part. If you don't want a smashing up,-</p>
<p>part! You two have got to be parted. You've got never to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3715">see</a> each</p>
<p>other ever, never to speak." There was a zest in her voice. "We're</p>
<p>not circulating stories," she denied. "No! And Curmain never told</p>
<p>us anything-Curmain is an EXCELLENT young man; oh! a quite</p>
<p>excellent young man. You misjudged him altogether."…</p>
<p>I was equally unsuccessful with Bailey. I caught the little wretch</p>
<p>in the League Club, and he wriggled and lied. He wouldn't say where</p>
<p>he had got his facts, he wouldn't admit he had told any one. When I</p>
<p>gave him the names of two men who had come to me astonished and</p>
<p>incredulous, he attempted absurdly to make me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3716">think</a> they had told</p>
<p>HIM. He did his horrible little best to suggest that honest old</p>
<p>Quackett, who had just left England for the Cape, was the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3717">real</a></p>
<p>scandalmonger. That struck me as mean, even for Bailey. I've still</p>
<p>the odd vivid impression of his fluting voice, excusing the</p>
<p>inexcusable, his big, shifty face evading me, his perspiration-</p>
<p>beaded forehead, the shrugging shoulders, and the would-be</p>
<p>exculpatory gestures-Houndsditch gestures-of his enormous ugly</p>
<p>hands.</p>
<p>"I can assure you, my dear fellow," he said; "I can assure you we've</p>
<p>done everything to shield you-everything."…</p>

<p>Isabel came after dinner one evening and talked in the office. She</p>
<p>made a white-robed, dusky figure against the deep blues of my big</p>
<p>window. I sat at my desk and tore a quill pen to pieces as I</p>
<p>talked.</p>
<p>"The Baileys don't intend to let this drop," I said. "They mean</p>
<p>that every one in London is to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3718">know</a> about it."</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3719">know</a>."</p>
<p>"Well!" I said.</p>
<p>"Dear heart," said Isabel, facing it, "it's no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3720">good</a> waiting for</p>
<p>things to overtake us; we're at the parting of the ways."</p>
<p>"What are we to do?"</p>
<p>"They won't let us go on."</p>
<p>"Damn them!"</p>
<p>"They are ORGANISING scandal."</p>
<p>"It's no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3721">good</a> waiting for things to overtake us," I echoed; "they</p>
<p>have overtaken us." I turned on her. "What do you want to do?"</p>
<p>"Everything," she said. "Keep you and have our work. Aren't we</p>
<p>Mates?"</p>
<p>"We can't."</p>
<p>"And we can't!"</p>
<p>"I've got to tell Margaret," I said.</p>
<p>"Margaret!"</p>
<p>"I can't bear the idea of any one else getting in front with it.</p>
<p>I've been wincing about Margaret secretly-"</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3722">know</a>. You'll have to tell her-and make your peace with her."</p>
<p>She leant back against the bookcases under the window.</p>
<p>"We've had some <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3723">good</a> times, Master;" she said, with a sigh in her</p>
<p>voice.</p>
<p>And then for a long time we stared at one another in silence.</p>
<p>"We haven't much time left," she said.</p>
<p>"Shall we bolt?" I said.</p>
<p>"And leave all this?" she asked, with her eyes going round the room.</p>
<p>"And that?" And her head indicated Westminster. "No!"</p>
<p>I said no more of bolting.</p>
<p>"We've got to screw <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3724">ourselves</a> up to surrender," she said.</p>
<p>"Something."</p>
<p>"A lot."</p>
<p>"Master," she said, "it isn't all sex and stuff between us?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"I can't give up the work. Our work's my life."</p>
<p>We came upon another long pause.</p>
<p>"No one will believe we've <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3725">ceased</a> to be lovers-if we simply do,"</p>
<p>she said.</p>
<p>"We shouldn't."</p>
<p>"We've got to do something more parting than that."</p>
<p>I nodded, and again we paused. She was coming to something.</p>
<p>"I could marry Shoesmith," she said abruptly.</p>
<p>"But-" I objected.</p>
<p>"He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3726">knows</a>. It wasn't fair. I told him."</p>
<p>"Oh, that explains," I said. "There's been a kind of sulkiness-</p>
<p>But-you told him?"</p>
<p>She nodded. "He's rather badly hurt," she said. "He's been a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3727">good</a></p>
<p>friend to me. He's curiously loyal. But something, something he</p>
<p>said one day-forced me to let him <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3728">know</a>… That's been the</p>
<p>beastliness of all this secrecy. That's the beastliness of all</p>
<p>secrecy. You have to spring surprises on people. But he keeps on.</p>
<p>He's steadfast. He'd already suspected. He wants me very badly to</p>
<p>marry him…"</p>
<p>"But you don't want to marry him?"</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3729">I'm</a> forced to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3730">think</a> of it."</p>
<p>"But does he want to marry you at that? Take you as a present from</p>
<p>the world at large?-against your will and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3731">desire</a>?… I don't</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3732">understand</a> him."</p>
<p>"He cares for me."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3733">thinks</a> this is a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3734">fearful</a> mess for me. He wants to pull it</p>
<p>straight."</p>
<p>We sat for a time in silence, with imaginations that obstinately</p>
<p>refused to take up the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3735">realities</a> of this proposition.</p>
<p>"I don't want you to marry Shoesmith," I said at last.</p>
<p>"Don't you like him?"</p>
<p>"Not as your husband."</p>
<p>"He's a very clever and sturdy person-and very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3736">generous</a> and devoted</p>
<p>to me."</p>
<p>"And me?"</p>
<p>"You can't expect that. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3737">thinks</a> you are wonderful-and,</p>
<p>naturally, that you ought not to have started this."</p>
<p>"I've a curious dislike to any one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3738">thinking</a> that but <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3739">myself</a>. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3740">I'm</a></p>
<p>quite ready to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3741">think</a> it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3739">myself</a>."</p>
<p>"He'd let us be friends-and meet."</p>
<p>"Let us be friends!" I cried, after a long pause. "You and me!"</p>
<p>"He wants me to be engaged soon. Then, he says, he can go round</p>
<p>fighting these rumours, defending us both-and force a quarrel on</p>
<p>the Baileys."</p>
<p>"I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3742">understand</a> him," I said, and added, "I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3742">understand</a></p>
<p>you."</p>
<p>I was staring at her face. It seemed white and set in the dimness.</p>
<p>"Do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3743">really</a> mean this, Isabel?" I asked.</p>
<p>"What else is there to do, my dear?-what else is there to do at</p>
<p>all? I've been <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3744">thinking</a> day and night. You can't go away with me.</p>
<p>You can't smash <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3745">yourself</a> suddenly in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3746">sight</a> of all men. I'd</p>
<p>rather die than that should happen. Look what you are becoming in</p>
<p>the country! Look at all you've built up!-me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3747">helping</a>. I wouldn't</p>
<p>let you do it if you could. I wouldn't let you-if it were only for</p>
<p>Margaret's sake. THIS… closes the scandal, closes everything."</p>
<p>"It closes all our life together," I cried.</p>
<p>She was silent.</p>
<p>"It never ought to have begun," I said.</p>
<p>She winced. Then abruptly she was on her knees before me, with her</p>
<p>hands upon my shoulder and her eyes meeting mine.</p>
<p>"My dear," she said very earnestly, "don't misunderstand me! Don't</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3748">think</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3749">I'm</a> retreating from the things we've done! Our love is the</p>
<p>best thing I could ever have had from life. Nothing can ever equal</p>
<p>it; nothing could ever equal the beauty and delight you and I have</p>
<p>had together. Never! You have loved me; you do love me…</p>
<p>No one could ever <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3750">know</a> how to love you as I have loved you; no one</p>
<p>could ever love me as you have loved me, my king. And it's just</p>
<p>because it's been so splendid, dear; it's just because I'd die</p>
<p>rather than have a tithe of all this wiped out of my life again-for</p>
<p>it's made me, it's all I am-dear, it's years since I began loving</p>
<p>you-it's just because of its <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3751">goodness</a> that I want not to end in</p>
<p>wreckage now, not to end in the smashing up of all the big things I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3752">understand</a> in you and love in you…</p>
<p>"What is there for us if we keep on and go away?" she went on. "All</p>
<p>the big interests in our lives will vanish-everything. We shall</p>
<p>become specialised people-people overshadowed by a situation. We</p>
<p>shall be an elopement, a romance-all our breadth and meaning gone!</p>
<p>People will always <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3753">think</a> of it first when they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3753">think</a> of us; all our</p>
<p>work and aims will be warped by it and subordinated to it. Is it</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3754">good</a> enough, dear? Just to specialise… I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3753">think</a> of you.</p>
<p>We've got a case, a passionate case, the best of cases, but do we</p>
<p>want to spend all our lives defending it and justifying it? And</p>
<p>there's that other life. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3755">know</a> now you care for Margaret-you care</p>
<p>more than you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3753">think</a> you do. You have said fine things of her. I've</p>
<p>watched you about her. Little things have dropped from you. She's</p>
<p>given her life for you; she's nothing without you. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3756">feel</a> that to</p>
<p>your marrow all the time you are <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3757">thinking</a> about these things. Oh,</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3758">I'm</a> not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3759">jealous</a>, dear. I love you for loving her. I love you in</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3760">relation</a> to her. But there it is, an added weight against us,</p>
<p>another thing worth saving."</p>
<p>Presently, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3761">remember</a>, she sat back on her heels and looked up into</p>
<p>my face. "We've done wrong-and parting's paying. It's time to</p>
<p>pay. We needn't have paid, if we'd kept to the track… You</p>
<p>and I, Master, we've got to be men."</p>
<p>"Yes," I said; "we've got to be men."</p>

<p>I was driven to tell Margaret about our situation by my intolerable</p>
<p>dread that otherwise the thing might come to her through some stupid</p>
<p>and clumsy informant. She might even meet Altiora, and have it from</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>I can still recall the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3762">feeling</a> of sitting at my desk that night in</p>
<p>that large study of mine in Radnor Square, waiting for Margaret to</p>
<p>come home. It was oddly like the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3762">feeling</a> of a dentist's reception-</p>
<p>room; only it was for me to do the dentistry with clumsy, cruel</p>
<p>hands. I had left the door open so that she would come in to me.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3763">heard</a> her silken rustle on the stairs at last, and then she was in</p>
<p>the doorway. "May I come in?" she said.</p>
<p>"Do," I said, and turned round to her.</p>
<p>"Working?" she said.</p>
<p>"Hard," I answered. "Where have YOU been?"</p>
<p>"At the Vallerys'. Mr. Evesham was talking about you. They were</p>
<p>all talking. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3764">think</a> everybody <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3765">knew</a> who I was. Just Mrs.</p>
<p>Mumble I'd been to them. Lord Wardenham doesn't like you."</p>
<p>"He doesn't."</p>
<p>"But they all <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3766">feel</a> you're rather big, anyhow. Then I went on to</p>
<p>Park Lane to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3767">hear</a> a new pianist and some other music at Eva's."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then I looked in at the Brabants' for some midnight tea before I</p>
<p>came on here. They'd got some writers-and Grant was there."</p>
<p>"You HAVE been flying round…"</p>
<p>There was a little pause between us.</p>
<p>I looked at her pretty, unsuspecting face, and at the slender grace</p>
<p>of her golden-robed body. What gulfs there were between us!</p>
<p>"You've been amused," I said.</p>
<p>"It's been amusing. You've been at the House?"</p>
<p>"The Medical Education Bill kept me."…</p>
<p>After all, why should I tell her? She'd got to a way of living that</p>
<p>fulfilled her requirements. Perhaps she'd never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3768">hear</a>. But all that</p>
<p>day and the day before I'd been making up my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3769">mind</a> to do the thing.</p>
<p>"I want to tell you something," I said. "I wish you'd sit down for</p>
<p>a moment or so."…</p>
<p>Once I had begun, it seemed to me I had to go through with it.</p>
<p>Something in the quality of my voice gave her an intimation of</p>
<p>unusual gravity. She looked at me steadily for a moment and sat</p>
<p>down slowly in my armchair.</p>
<p>"What is it?" she said.</p>
<p>I went on awkwardly. "I've got to tell you-something</p>
<p>extraordinarily distressing," I said.</p>
<p>She was manifestly altogether unaware.</p>
<p>"There seems to be a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3770">good</a> deal of scandal abroad-I've only recently</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3771">heard</a> of it-about myself-and Isabel."</p>
<p>"Isabel!"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"What do they say?" she asked.</p>
<p>It was difficult, I found, to speak.</p>
<p>"They say she's my mistress."</p>
<p>"Oh! How abominable!"</p>
<p>She spoke with the most natural indignation. Our eyes met.</p>
<p>"We've been great friends," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes. And to make THAT of it. My poor dear! But how can they?"</p>
<p>She paused and looked at me. It's so incredible. How can any one</p>
<p>believe it? I couldn't."</p>
<p>She stopped, with her distressed eyes regarding me. Her expression</p>
<p>changed to dread. There was a tense stillness for a second,</p>
<p>perhaps.</p>
<p>I turned my face towards the desk, and took up and dropped a handful</p>
<p>of paper fasteners.</p>
<p>"Margaret," I said, " <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3772">I'm</a> afraid you'll have to believe it."</p>
</section>

<p>Margaret sat very still. When I looked at her again, her face was</p>
<p>very white, and her distressed eyes scrutinised me. Her lips</p>
<p>quivered as she spoke. "You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3773">really</a> mean-THAT?" she said.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"I never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3774">dreamt</a>."</p>
<p>"I never meant you to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3775">dream</a>."</p>
<p>"And that is why-we've been apart?"</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3776">thought</a>. "I suppose it is."</p>
<p>"Why have you told me now?"</p>
<p>"Those rumours. I didn't want any one else to tell you."</p>
<p>"Or else it wouldn't have mattered?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>She turned her eyes from me to the fire. Then for a moment she</p>
<p>looked about the room she had made for me, and then quite silently,</p>
<p>with a childish quivering of her lips, with a sort of dismayed</p>
<p>distress upon her face, she was weeping. She sat weeping in her</p>
<p>dress of cloth of gold, with her bare slender arms dropped limp over</p>
<p>the arms of her chair, and her eyes averted from me, making no</p>
<p>effort to stay or staunch her tears. "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3777">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3778">am</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3779">sorry</a>, Margaret," I</p>
<p>said. "I was in love… I did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3780">understand</a>…"</p>
<p>Presently she asked: "What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>"You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3781">see</a>, Margaret, now it's come to be your affair-I want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3782">know</a></p>
<p>what you-what you want."</p>
<p>"You want to leave me?"</p>
<p>"If you want me to, I must."</p>
<p>"Leave Parliament-leave all the things you are doing,-all this</p>
<p>fine movement of yours?"</p>
<p>"No." I spoke sullenly. "I don't want to leave anything. I want to</p>
<p>stay on. I've told you, because I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3783">think</a> we-Isabel and I, I mean-</p>
<p>have got to drive through a storm of scandal anyhow. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3784">know</a></p>
<p>how far things may go, how much people may <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3785">feel</a>, and I can't, I</p>
<p>can't have you unconscious, unarmed, open to any revelation-"</p>
<p>She made no answer.</p>
<p>"When the thing began-I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3786">knew</a> it was stupid but I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3787">thought</a> it was a</p>
<p>thing that wouldn't change, wouldn't be anything but itself,</p>
<p>wouldn't unfold-consequences… People have got hold of these</p>
<p>vague rumours… Directly it reached any one else but-but us</p>
<p>two-I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3788">saw</a> it had to come to you."</p>
<p>I stopped. I had that distressful <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3789">feeling</a> I have always had with</p>
<p>Margaret, of not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3790">being</a> altogether sure she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3791">heard</a>, of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3790">being</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3792">doubtful</a></p>
<p>if she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3793">understood</a>. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3794">perceived</a> that once again I had struck at her</p>
<p>and shattered a thousand unsubstantial pinnacles. And I couldn't</p>
<p>get at her, to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3795">help</a> her, or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3796">touch</a> her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3797">mind</a>! I stood up, and at my</p>
<p>movement she moved. She produced a dainty little handkerchief, and</p>
<p>made an effort to wipe her face with it, and held it to her eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh, my Husband!" she sobbed.</p>
<p>"What do you mean to do?" she said, with her voice muffled by her</p>
<p>handkerchief.</p>
<p>"We're going to end it," I said.</p>
<p>Something gripped me tormentingly as I said that. I drew a chair</p>
<p>beside her and sat down. "You and I, Margaret, have been partners,"</p>
<p>I began. "We've built up this life of ours together; I couldn't</p>
<p>have done it without you. We've made a position, created a work-"</p>
<p>She shook her head. "You," she said.</p>
<p>"You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3798">helping</a>. I don't want to shatter it-if you don't want it</p>
<p>shattered. I can't leave my work. I can't leave you. I want you</p>
<p>to have-all that you have ever had. I've never meant to rob you.</p>
<p>I've made an immense and tragic blunder. You don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3799">know</a> how things</p>
<p>took us, how different they seemed! My <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3800">character</a> and accident have</p>
<p>conspired-We'll pay-in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3801">ourselves</a>, not in our public service."</p>
<p>I halted again. Margaret remained very still.</p>
<p>"I want you to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3802">understand</a> that the thing is at an end. It is</p>
<p>definitely at an end. We-we talked-yesterday. We mean to end it</p>
<p>altogether." I clenched my hands. "She's-she's going to marry</p>
<p>Arnold Shoesmith."</p>
<p>I wasn't looking now at Margaret any more, but I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3803">heard</a> the rustle of</p>
<p>her movement as she turned on me.</p>
<p>"It's all right," I said, clinging to my explanation. "We're doing</p>
<p>nothing shabby. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3804">knows</a>. He will. It's all as right-as things</p>
<p>can be now. We're not cheating any one, Margaret. We're doing</p>
<p>things straight-now. Of course, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3805">know</a>… We shall-we</p>
<p>shall have to make sacrifices. Give things up pretty completely.</p>
<p>Very completely… We shall have not to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3806">see</a> each other for a</p>
<p>time, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3805">know</a>. Perhaps not a long time. Two or three years. Or</p>
<p>write-or just any of that sort of thing ever-"</p>
<p>Some subconscious barrier gave way in me. I found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3807">myself</a> crying</p>
<p>uncontrollably-as I have never cried since I was a little child. I</p>
<p>was amazed and horrified at <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3807">myself</a>. And wonderfully, Margaret was</p>
<p>on her knees beside me, with her arms about me, mingling her weeping</p>
<p>with mine. "Oh, my Husband!" she cried, my poor Husband! Does it</p>
<p>hurt you so? I would do anything! Oh, the fool <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3808">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3809">am</a>! Dear, I love</p>
<p>you. I love you over and away and above all these <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3810">jealous</a> little</p>
<p>things!"</p>
<p>She drew down my head to her as a mother might draw down the head of</p>
<p>a son. She caressed me, weeping <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3811">bitterly</a> with me. "Oh! my dear,"</p>
<p>she sobbed, "my dear! I've never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3812">seen</a> you cry! I've never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3812">seen</a> you</p>
<p>cry. Ever! I didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3813">know</a> you could. Oh! my dear! Can't you have</p>
<p>her, my dear, if you want her? I can't bear it! Let me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3814">help</a> you,</p>
<p>dear. Oh! my Husband! My Man! I can't bear to have you cry!" For</p>
<p>a time she held me in silence.</p>
<p>"I've <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3815">thought</a> this might happen, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3816">dreamt</a> it might happen. You two,</p>
<p>I mean. It was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3816">dreaming</a> put it into my head. When I've <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3817">seen</a> you</p>
<p>together, so glad with each other… Oh! Husband mine, believe</p>
<p>me! believe me! <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3818">I'm</a> stupid, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3818">I'm</a> cold, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3818">I'm</a> only beginning to realise</p>
<p>how stupid and cold, but all I want in all the world is to give my</p>
<p>life to you."…</p>

<p>"We can't part in a room," said Isabel.</p>
<p>"We'll have one last talk together," I said, and planned that we</p>
<p>should meet for a half a day between Dover and Walmer and talk</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3819">ourselves</a> out. I still recall that day very well, recall even the</p>
<p>curious exaltation of grief that made our mental atmosphere</p>
<p>distinctive and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3820">memorable</a>. We had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3821">seen</a> so much of one another, had</p>
<p>become so intimate, that we talked of parting even as we parted with</p>
<p>a sense of incredible remoteness. We went together up over the</p>
<p>cliffs, and to a place where they fall towards the sea, past the</p>
<p>white, quaint-lanterned lighthouses of the South Foreland. There,</p>
<p>in a kind of niche below the crest, we sat talking. It was a</p>
<p>spacious day, serenely blue and warm, and on the wrinkled water</p>
<p>remotely below a black tender and six hooded submarines came</p>
<p>presently, and engaged in mysterious manoeuvers. Shrieking gulls</p>
<p>and chattering jackdaws circled over us and below us, and dived and</p>
<p>swooped; and a skerry of weedy, fallen chalk appeared, and gradually</p>
<p>disappeared again, as the tide fell and rose.</p>
<p>We talked and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3822">thought</a> that afternoon on every aspect of our</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3823">relations</a>. It seems to me now we talked so wide and far that</p>
<p>scarcely an issue in the life between man and woman can arise that</p>
<p>we did not at least <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3824">touch</a> upon. Lying there at Isabel's feet, I</p>
<p>have become for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3825">myself</a> a symbol of all this world-wide problem</p>
<p>between duty and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3826">conscious</a>, passionate love the world has still to</p>
<p>solve. Because it isn't solved; there's a wrong in it either way..</p>
<p>.. The sky, the wide horizon, seemed to lift us out of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3827">ourselves</a></p>
<p>until we were something representative and general. She was</p>
<p>womanhood become articulate, talking to her lover.</p>
<p>"I ought," I said, "never to have loved you."</p>
<p>"It wasn't a thing planned," she said.</p>
<p>"I ought never to have let our talk slip to that, never to have</p>
<p>turned back from America."</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3828">I'm</a> glad we did it," she said. "Don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3829">think</a> I repent."</p>
<p>I looked at her.</p>
<p>"I will never repent," she said. "Never!" as though she clung to</p>
<p>her life in saying it.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3830">remember</a> we talked for a long time of divorce. It seemed to us</p>
<p>then, and it seems to us still, that it ought to have been possible</p>
<p>for Margaret to divorce me, and for me to marry without the</p>
<p>scandalous and ugly publicity, the taint and ostracism that follow</p>
<p>such a readjustment. We went on to the whole perplexing riddle of</p>
<p>marriage. We criticised the current code, how muddled and</p>
<p>conventionalised it had become, how modified by subterfuges and</p>
<p>concealments and new necessities, and the increasing freedom of</p>
<p>women. "It's all like Bromstead when the building came," I said;</p>
<p>for I had often talked to her of that early impression of purpose</p>
<p>dissolving again into chaotic forces. "There is no clear right in</p>
<p>the world any more. The world is Byzantine. The justest man to-day</p>
<p>must practise a tainted <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3831">goodness</a>."</p>
<p>These questions need discussion-a magnificent frankness of</p>
<p>discussion-if any standards are again to establish an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3832">effective</a></p>
<p>hold upon educated people. Discretions, as I have said already,</p>
<p>will never hold any one worth holding-longer than they held us.</p>
<p>Against every "shalt not" there must be a "why not" plainly put,-</p>
<p>the "why not" largest and plainest, the law deduced from its</p>
<p>purpose. "You and I, Isabel," I said, "have always been a little</p>
<p>disregardful of duty, partly at least because the idea of duty comes</p>
<p>to us so ill-clad. Oh! I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3833">know</a> there's an extravagant insubordinate</p>
<p>strain in us, but that wasn't all. I wish humbugs would leave duty</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3834">alone</a>. I wish all duty wasn't covered with slime. That's where the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3835">real</a> mischief comes in. Passion can always contrive to clothe</p>
<p>itself in beauty, strips itself splendid. That carried us. But for</p>
<p>all its mean associations there is this duty…</p>
<p>"Don't we come rather late to it?"</p>
<p>"Not so late that it won't be atrociously hard to do."</p>
<p>"It's queer to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3836">think</a> of now," said Isabel. "Who could believe we</p>
<p>did all we have done honestly? Well, in a manner honestly. Who</p>
<p>could believe we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3837">thought</a> this might be hidden? Who could trace it</p>
<p>all step by step from the time when we found that a certain boldness</p>
<p>in our talk was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3838">pleasing</a>? We talked of love… Master, there's</p>
<p>not much for us to do in the way of Apologia that any one will</p>
<p>credit. And yet if it were possible to tell the very heart of our</p>
<p>story…</p>
<p>"Does Margaret <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3839">really</a> want to go on with you?" she asked-"shield</p>
<p>you-knowing of… THIS?"</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3840">I'm</a> certain. I don't understand-just as I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3841">understand</a></p>
<p>Shoesmith, but she does. These people walk on solid ground which is</p>
<p>just thin air to us. They've got something we haven't got.</p>
<p>Assurances? I wonder."…</p>
<p>Then it was, or later, we talked of Shoesmith, and what her life</p>
<p>might be with him.</p>
<p>"He's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3842">good</a>," she said; "he's kindly. He's everything but magic.</p>
<p>He's the very image of the decent, sober, honourable life. You</p>
<p>can't say a thing against him or I-except that something-something</p>
<p>in his imagination, something in the tone of his voice-fails for</p>
<p>me. Why don't I love him?-he's a better man than you! Why don't</p>
<p>you? IS he a better man than you? He's usage, he's honour, he's</p>
<p>the right thing, he's the breed and the tradition,-a gentleman.</p>
<p>You're your erring, incalculable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3843">self</a>. I suppose we women will</p>
<p>trust this sort and love your sort to the very end of time…"</p>
<p>We lay side by side and nibbled at grass stalks as we talked. It</p>
<p>seemed enormously unreasonable to us that two people who had come to</p>
<p>the pitch of easy and confident affection and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3844">happiness</a> that held</p>
<p>between us should be obliged to part and shun one another, or murder</p>
<p>half the substance of their lives. We <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3845">felt</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3846">ourselves</a> crushed and</p>
<p>beaten by an indiscriminating machine which destroys <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3844">happiness</a> in</p>
<p>the service of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3847">jealousy</a>. "The mass of people don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3845">feel</a> these</p>
<p>things in quite the same manner as we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3845">feel</a> them," she said. "Is it</p>
<p>because they're different in grain, or educated out of some</p>
<p>primitive instinct?"</p>
<p>"It's because we've explored love a little, and they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3848">know</a> no more</p>
<p>than the gateway," I said. "Lust and then <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3849">jealousy</a>; their simple</p>
<p>conception-and we have gone past all that and wandered hand in</p>
<p>hand…"</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3850">remember</a> that for a time we watched two of that larger sort of</p>
<p>gull, whose wings are brownish-white, circle and hover against the</p>
<p>blue. And then we lay and looked at a band of water mirror clear</p>
<p>far out to sea, and wondered why the breeze that rippled all the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3851">rest</a> should leave it so serene.</p>
<p>"And in this State of ours," I resumed.</p>
<p>"Eh!" said Isabel, rolling over into a sitting posture and looking</p>
<p>out at the horizon. "Let's talk no more of things we can never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3852">see</a>.</p>
<p>Talk to me of the work you are doing and all we shall do-after we</p>
<p>have parted. We've said too little of that. We've had our red</p>
<p>life, and it's over. Thank Heaven!-though we stole it! Talk about</p>
<p>your work, dear, and the things we'll go on doing-just as though we</p>
<p>were still together. We'll still be together in a sense-through</p>
<p>all these things we have in common."</p>
<p>And so we talked of politics and our outlook. We were interested to</p>
<p>the pitch of self-forgetfulness. We weighed persons and forces,</p>
<p>discussed the probabilities of the next general election, the steady</p>
<p>drift of public opinion in the north and west away from Liberalism</p>
<p>towards us. It was very manifest that in spite of Wardenham and the</p>
<p>EXPURGATOR, we should come into the new Government strongly. The</p>
<p>party had no one else, all the young men were formally or informally</p>
<p>with us; Esmeer would have office, Lord Tarvrille, I… and very</p>
<p>probably there would be something for Shoesmith. "And for my own</p>
<p>part," I said, "I count on backing on the Liberal side. For the</p>
<p>last two years we've been forcing competition in constructive</p>
<p>legislation between the parties. The Liberals have not been long in</p>
<p>following up our Endowment of Motherhood lead. They'll have to give</p>
<p>votes and lip service anyhow. Half the readers of the BLUE WEEKLY,</p>
<p>they say, are Liberals…</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3853">remember</a> talking about things of this sort with old Willersley,"</p>
<p>I said, "ever so many years ago. It was some place near Locarno,</p>
<p>and we looked down the lake that shone weltering-just as now we</p>
<p>look over the sea. And then we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3854">dreamt</a> in an indistinct featureless</p>
<p>way of all that you and I are doing now."</p>
<p>"I!" said Isabel, and laughed.</p>
<p>"Well, of some such thing," I said, and remained for awhile silent,</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3855">thinking</a> of Locarno.</p>
<p>I recalled once more the largeness, the release from small personal</p>
<p>things that I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3856">felt</a> in my youth; statecraft became <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3857">real</a> and</p>
<p>wonderful again with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3858">memory</a>, the gigantic handling of gigantic</p>
<p>problems. I began to talk out my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3859">thoughts</a>, sitting up beside her,</p>
<p>as I could never talk of them to any one but Isabel; began to</p>
<p>recover again the purpose that lay under all my political ambitions</p>
<p>and adjustments and anticipations. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3860">saw</a> the State, splendid and</p>
<p>wide as I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3861">seen</a> it in that first travel of mine, but now it was</p>
<p>no mere distant prospect of spires and pinnacles, but populous with</p>
<p>fine-trained, bold-thinking, bold-doing people. It was as if I had</p>
<p>forgotten for a long time and now <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3858">remembered</a> with amazement.</p>
<p>At first, I told her, I had been altogether at a loss how I could do</p>
<p>anything to battle against the aimless muddle of our world; I had</p>
<p>wanted a clue-until she had come into my life questioning,</p>
<p>suggesting, unconsciously illuminating. "But I have done nothing,"</p>
<p>she protested. I declared she had done everything in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3862">growing</a> to</p>
<p>education under my eyes, in reflecting again upon all the processes</p>
<p>that had made <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3863">myself</a>, so that instead of abstractions and blue-books</p>
<p>and bills and devices, I had realised the world of mankind as a</p>
<p>crowd needing before all things fine women and men. We'd spoilt</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3864">ourselves</a> in learning that, but anyhow we had our lesson. Before</p>
<p>her I was in a nineteenth-century darkness, dealing with the nation</p>
<p>as if it were a crowd of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3865">selfish</a> men, forgetful of women and</p>
<p>children and that shy wild thing in the hearts of men, love, which</p>
<p>must be drawn upon as it has never been drawn upon before, if the</p>
<p>State is to live. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3866">saw</a> now how it is possible to bring the loose</p>
<p>factors of a great realm together, to create a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3867">mind</a> of literature</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3868">thought</a> in it, and the expression of a purpose to make it self-</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3869">conscious</a> and fine. I had it all clear before me, so that at a</p>
<p>score of points I could presently begin. The BLUE WEEKLY was a</p>
<p>centre of force. Already we had given Imperialism a criticism, and</p>
<p>leavened half the press from our columns. Our movement consolidated</p>
<p>and spread. We should presently come into power. Everything moved</p>
<p>towards our hands. We should be able to get at the schools, the</p>
<p>services, the universities, the church; enormously increase the</p>
<p>endowment of research, and organise what was sorely wanted, a</p>
<p>criticism of research; contrive a closer contact between the press</p>
<p>and creative intellectual life; foster literature, clarify,</p>
<p>strengthen the public <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3870">consciousness</a>, develop social organisation and</p>
<p>a sense of the State. Men were coming to us every day, brilliant</p>
<p>young peers like Lord Dentonhill, writers like Carnot and Cresswell.</p>
<p>It filled me with pride to win such men. "We stand for so much more</p>
<p>than we seem to stand for," I said. I opened my heart to her, so</p>
<p>freely that I hesitate to open my heart even to the reader, telling</p>
<p>of projects and ambitions I cherished, of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3870">consciousness</a> of great</p>
<p>powers and widening opportunities…</p>
<p>Isabel watched me as I talked.</p>
<p>She too, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3871">think</a>, had forgotten these things for a while. For it is</p>
<p>curious and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3871">think</a> a very significant thing that since we had</p>
<p>become lovers, we had talked very little of the broader things that</p>
<p>had once so strongly gripped our imaginations.</p>
<p>"It's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3872">good</a>," I said, "to talk like this to you, to get back to youth</p>
<p>and great ambitions with you. There have been times lately when</p>
<p>politics has seemed the pettiest game played with mean tools for</p>
<p>mean ends-and none the less so that the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3873">happiness</a> of three hundred</p>
<p>million people might be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3874">touched</a> by our follies. I talk to no one</p>
<p>else like this… And now I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3875">think</a> of parting, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3875">think</a> but of</p>
<p>how much more I might have talked to you."…</p>
<p>Things drew to an end at last, but after we had spoken of a thousand</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>"We've talked away our last half day," I said, staring over my</p>
<p>shoulder at the blazing sunset sky behind us. "Dear, it's been the</p>
<p>last day of our lives for us… It doesn't seem like the last</p>
<p>day of our lives. Or any day."</p>
<p>"I wonder how it will <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3876">feel</a>?" said Isabel.</p>
<p>"It will be very strange at first-not to be able to tell you</p>
<p>things."</p>
<p>"I've a superstition that after-after we've parted-if ever I go</p>
<p>into my room and talk, you'll <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3877">hear</a>. You'll be-somewhere."</p>
<p>"I shall be in the world-yes."</p>
<p>"I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3878">feel</a> as though these days ahead were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3879">real</a>. Here we are,</p>
<p>here we remain."</p>
<p>"Yes, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3880">feel</a> that. As though you and I were two immortals, who</p>
<p>didn't live in time and space at all, who never met, who couldn't</p>
<p>part, and here we lie on Olympus. And those two poor creatures who</p>
<p>did meet, poor little Richard Remington and Isabel Rivers, who met</p>
<p>and loved too much and had to part, they part and go their ways, and</p>
<p>we lie here and watch them, you and I. She'll cry, poor dear."</p>
<p>"She'll cry. She's crying now!"</p>
<p>"Poor little beasts! I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3881">think</a> he'll cry too. He winces. He could-</p>
<p>for tuppence. I didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3882">know</a> he had lachrymal glands at all until a</p>
<p>little while ago. I suppose all love is hysterical-and a little</p>
<p>foolish. Poor mites! Silly little pitiful creatures! How we have</p>
<p>blundered! <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3881">Think</a> how we must look to God! Well, we'll <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3883">pity</a> them,</p>
<p>and then we'll inspire him to stiffen up again-and do as we've</p>
<p>determined he shall do. We'll <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3884">see</a> it through,-we who lie here on</p>
<p>the cliff. They'll be mean at times, and horrid at times; we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3882">know</a></p>
<p>them! Do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3884">see</a> her, a poor little fine lady in a great house,-</p>
<p>she sometimes goes to her room and writes."</p>
<p>"She writes for his BLUE WEEKLY still."</p>
<p>"Yes. Sometimes-I hope. And he's there in the office with a bit</p>
<p>of her copy in his hand."</p>
<p>"Is it as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3885">good</a> as if she still talked it over with him before she</p>
<p>wrote it? Is it?"</p>
<p>"Better, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3886">think</a>. Let's play it's better-anyhow. It may be that</p>
<p>talking over was rather mixed with love-making. After all, love-</p>
<p>making is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3887">joy</a> rather than magic. Don't let's pretend about that</p>
<p>even… Let's go on watching him. (I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3888">see</a> why her writing</p>
<p>shouldn't be better. Indeed I don't.) <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3888">See</a>! There he goes down</p>
<p>along the Embankment to Westminster just like a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3889">real</a> man, for all</p>
<p>that he's smaller than a grain of dust. What is running round</p>
<p>inside that speck of a head of his? Look at him going past the</p>
<p>Policemen, specks too-selected large ones from the country. I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3886">think</a> he's going to dinner with the Speaker-some old thing like</p>
<p>that. Is his face harder or commoner or stronger?-I can't quite</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3888">see</a>… And now he's up and speaking in the House. Hope he'll</p>
<p>hold on to the thread. He'll have to plan his speeches to the very</p>
<p>end of his days-and learn the headings."</p>
<p>"Isn't she up in the women's gallery to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3890">hear</a> him?"</p>
<p>"No. Unless it's by accident."</p>
<p>"She's there," she said.</p>
<p>"Well, by accident it happens. Not too many accidents, Isabel.</p>
<p>Never any more adventures for us, dear, now. No!… They play</p>
<p>the game, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3891">know</a>. They've begun late, but now they've got to.</p>
<p>You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3892">see</a> it's not so very hard for them since you and I, my dear, are</p>
<p>here always, always <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3893">faithfully</a> here on this warm cliff of love</p>
<p>accomplished, watching and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3894">helping</a> them under high heaven. It isn't</p>
<p>so VERY hard. Rather <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3895">good</a> in some ways. Some people HAVE to be</p>
<p>broken a little. Can you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3892">see</a> Altiora down there, by any chance?"</p>
<p>"She's too little to be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3896">seen</a>," she said.</p>
<p>"Can you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3897">see</a> the sins they once committed?"</p>
<p>"I can only <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3898">see</a> you here beside me, dear-for ever. For all my</p>
<p>life, dear, till I die. Was that-the sin?"…</p>
<p>I took her to the station, and after she had gone I was to drive to</p>
<p>Dover, and cross to Calais by the night boat. I couldn't, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3899">felt</a>,</p>
<p>return to London. We walked over the crest and down to the little</p>
<p>station of Martin Mill side by side, talking at first in broken</p>
<p>fragments, for the most part of unimportant things.</p>
<p>"None of this," she said abruptly, "seems in the slightest degree</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3900">real</a> to me. I've got no sense of things ending."</p>
<p>"We're parting," I said.</p>
<p>"We're parting-as people part in a play. It's distressing. But I</p>
<p>don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3901">feel</a> as though you and I were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3902">really</a> never to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3903">see</a> each other</p>
<p>again for years. Do you?"</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3904">thought</a>. "No," I said.</p>
<p>"After we've parted I shall look to talk it over with you."</p>
<p>"So shall I."</p>
<p>"That's absurd."</p>
<p>"Absurd."</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3905">feel</a> as if you'd always he there, just about where you are now.</p>
<p>Invisible perhaps, but there. We've spent so much of our lives</p>
<p>joggling elbows."…</p>
<p>"Yes. Yes. I don't in the least realise it. I suppose I shall</p>
<p>begin to when the train goes out of the station. Are we wanting in</p>
<p>imagination, Isabel?"</p>
<p>"I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3906">know</a>. We've always assumed it was the other way about."</p>
<p>"Even when the train goes out of the station-! I've <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3907">seen</a> you into</p>
<p>so many trains."</p>
<p>"I shall go on <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3908">thinking</a> of things to say to you-things to put in</p>
<p>your letters. For years to come. How can I ever stop <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3908">thinking</a> in</p>
<p>that way now? We've got into each other's brains."</p>
<p>"It isn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3909">real</a>," I said; "nothing is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3909">real</a>. The world's no more than</p>
<p>a fantastic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3910">dream</a>. Why are we parting, Isabel?"</p>
<p>"I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3911">know</a>. It seems now supremely silly. I suppose we have to.</p>
<p>Can't we meet?-don't you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3912">think</a> we shall meet even in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3913">dreams</a>?"</p>
<p>"We'll meet a thousand times in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3914">dreams</a>," I said.</p>
<p>"I wish we could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3915">dream</a> at the same time," said Isabel… "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3915">Dream</a></p>
<p>walks. I can't believe, dear, I shall never have a walk with you</p>
<p>again."</p>
<p>"If I'd stayed six months in America," I said, "we might have walked</p>
<p>long walks and talked long talks for all our lives."</p>
<p>"Not in a world of Baileys," said Isabel. "And anyhow-"</p>
<p>She stopped short. I looked interrogation.</p>
<p>"We've loved," she said.</p>
<p>I took her ticket, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3916">saw</a> to her luggage, and stood by the door of the</p>
<p>compartment. "Good-bye," I said a little stiffly, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3917">conscious</a> of the</p>
<p>people upon the platform. She bent above me, white and dusky,</p>
<p>looking at me very steadfastly.</p>
<p>"Come here," she whispered. "Never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3918">mind</a> the porters. What can they</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3919">know</a>? Just one time more-I must."</p>
<p>She <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3920">rested</a> her hand against the door of the carriage and bent down</p>
<p>upon me, and put her cold, moist lips to mine.</p>

<p>CHAPTER THE THIRD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THE BREAKING POINT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>1</p>
</title>
<p>And then we broke down. We broke our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3921">faith</a> with both Margaret and</p>
<p>Shoesmith, flung career and duty out of our lives, and went away</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>It is only now, almost a year after these events, that I can begin</p>
<p>to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3922">see</a> what happened to me. At the time it seemed to me I was a</p>
<p>rational, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3923">responsible</a> creature, but indeed I had not parted from her</p>
<p>two days before I became a monomaniac to whom nothing could matter</p>
<p>but Isabel. Every <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3924">truth</a> had to be squared to that obsession, every</p>
<p>duty. It astounds me to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3925">think</a> how I forgot Margaret, forgot my</p>
<p>work, forgot everything but that we two were parted. I still</p>
<p>believe that with better chances we might have escaped the</p>
<p>consequences of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3926">emotional</a> storm that presently seized us both.</p>
<p>But we had no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3927">foresight</a> of that, and no preparation for it, and our</p>
<p>circumstances betrayed us. It was partly Shoesmith's unwisdom in</p>
<p>delaying his marriage until after the end of the session-partly my</p>
<p>own amazing folly in returning within four days to Westminster. But</p>
<p>we were all of us intent upon the defeat of scandal and the complete</p>
<p>restoration of appearances. It seemed necessary that Shoesmith's</p>
<p>marriage should not seem to be hurried, still more necessary that I</p>
<p>should not vanish inexplicably. I had to be visible with Margaret</p>
<p>in London just as much as possible; we went to restaurants, we</p>
<p>visited the theatre; we could even contemplate the possibility of my</p>
<p>presence at the wedding. For that, however, we had schemed a</p>
<p>weekend visit to Wales, and a fictitious sprained ankle at the last</p>
<p>moment which would justify my absence…</p>
<p>I cannot convey to you the intolerable wretchedness and rebellion of</p>
<p>my separation from Isabel. It seemed that in the past two years all</p>
<p>my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3928">thoughts</a> had spun commisures to Isabel's brain and I could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3929">think</a></p>
<p>of nothing that did not lead me surely to the need of the one</p>
<p>intimate I had found in the world. I came back to the House and the</p>
<p>office and my home, I filled all my days with appointments and duty,</p>
<p>and it did not save me in the least from a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3930">lonely</a> emptiness such as</p>
<p>I had never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3931">felt</a> before in all my life. I had little sleep. In the</p>
<p>daytime I did a hundred things, I even spoke in the House on two</p>
<p>occasions, and by my own low standards spoke well, and it seemed to</p>
<p>me that I was going about in my own brain like a hushed survivor in</p>
<p>a house whose owner lies dead upstairs.</p>
<p>I came to a crisis after that wild dinner of Tarvrille's. Something</p>
<p>in that stripped my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3932">soul</a> bare.</p>
<p>It was an occasion made absurd and strange by the odd accident that</p>
<p>the house caught fire upstairs while we were dining below. It was a</p>
<p>men's dinner-" A dinner of all sorts," said Tarvrille, when he</p>
<p>invited me; "everything from Evesham and Gane to Wilkins the author,</p>
<p>and Heaven <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3933">knows</a> what will happen!" I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3934">remember</a> that afterwards</p>
<p>Tarvrille was accused of having planned the fire to make his dinner</p>
<p>a marvel and a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3935">memory</a>. It was indeed a wonderful occasion, and I</p>
<p>suppose if I had not been altogether drenched in misery, I should</p>
<p>have found the same wild amusement in it that glowed in all the</p>
<p>others. There were one or two university dons, Lord George Fester,</p>
<p>the racing man, Panmure, the artist, two or three big City men,</p>
<p>Weston Massinghay and another prominent Liberal whose name I can't</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3934">remember</a>, the three men Tarvrille had promised and Esmeer, Lord</p>
<p>Wrassleton, Waulsort, the member for Monckton, Neal and several</p>
<p>others. We began a little coldly, with duologues, but the</p>
<p>conversation was already becoming general-so far as such a long</p>
<p>table permitted-when the fire asserted itself.</p>
<p>It asserted itself first as a penetrating and emphatic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3936">smell</a> of</p>
<p>burning rubber,-it was caused by the fusing of an electric wire.</p>
<p>The reek forced its way into the discussion of the Pekin massacres</p>
<p>that had sprung up between Evesham, Waulsort, and the others at the</p>
<p>end of the table. "Something burning," said the man next to me.</p>
<p>"Something must be burning," said Panmure.</p>
<p>Tarvrille <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3937">hated</a> undignified interruptions. He had a particularly</p>
<p>imperturbable butler with a cadaverous sad face and an eye of rigid</p>
<p>disapproval. He spoke to this individual over his shoulder. "Just</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3938">see</a>, will you," he said, and caught up the pause in the talk to his</p>
<p>left.</p>
<p>Wilkins was asking questions, and I, too, was curious. The story of</p>
<p>the siege of the Legations in China in the year 1900 and all that</p>
<p>followed upon that, is just one of those disturbing interludes in</p>
<p>history that refuse to join on to that general scheme of</p>
<p>protestation by which civilisation is maintained. It is a break in</p>
<p>the general flow of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3939">experience</a> as disconcerting to statecraft as the</p>
<p>robbery of my knife and the scuffle that followed it had been to me</p>
<p>when I was a boy at Penge. It is like a tear in a curtain revealing</p>
<p>quite unexpected backgrounds. I had never given the business a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3940">thought</a> for years; now this talk brought back a string of pictures</p>
<p>to my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3941">mind</a>; how the reliefs arrived and the plundering began, how</p>
<p>section after section of the International Army was drawn into</p>
<p>murder and pillage, how the infection spread upward until the wives</p>
<p>of Ministers were busy looting, and the very sentinels stripped and</p>
<p>crawled like snakes into the Palace they were set to guard. It did</p>
<p>not stop at robbery, men were murdered, women, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3942">being</a> plundered, were</p>
<p>outraged, children were butchered, strong men had found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3943">themselves</a></p>
<p>with arms in a lawless, defenceless city, and this had followed.</p>
<p>Now it was all recalled.</p>
<p>"Respectable ladies addicted to district visiting at home were as</p>
<p>bad as any one," said Panmure. "Glazebrook told me of one-flushed</p>
<p>like a woman at a bargain sale, he said-and when he pointed out to</p>
<p>her that the silk she'd got was bloodstained, she just said, 'Oh,</p>
<p>bother!' and threw it aside and went back…"</p>
<p>We became aware that Tarvrille's butler had returned. We tried not</p>
<p>to seem to listen.</p>
<p>"Beg pardon, m'lord," he said. "The house IS on fire, m'lord."</p>
<p>"Upstairs, m'lord."</p>
<p>"Just overhead, m'lord."</p>
<p>"The maids are throwing water, m'lord, and I've telephoned FIRE."</p>
<p>"No, m'lord, no immediate danger."</p>
<p>"It's all right," said Tarvrille to the table generally. Go on!</p>
<p>It's not a general conflagration, and the fire brigade won't be five</p>
<p>minutes. Don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3944">see</a> that it's our affair. The stuff's insured.</p>
<p>They say old Lady Paskershortly was dreadful. Like a harpy. The</p>
<p>Dowager Empress had shown her some little things of hers. Pet</p>
<p>things-hidden away. Susan went straight for them-used to take an</p>
<p>umbrella for the silks. Born shoplifter."</p>
<p>It was evident he didn't want his dinner spoilt, and we played up</p>
<p>loyally.</p>
<p>"This is recorded history," said Wilkins,-" practically. It makes</p>
<p>one wonder about unrecorded history. In India, for example."</p>
<p>But nobody <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3945">touched</a> that.</p>
<p>"Thompson," said Tarvrille to the imperturbable butler, and</p>
<p>indicating the table generally, "champagne. Champagne. Keep it</p>
<p>going."</p>
<p>"M'lord," and Thompson marshalled his assistants.</p>
<p>Some man I didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3946">know</a> began to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3947">remember</a> things about Mandalay.</p>
<p>"It's queer," he said, "how people break out at times;" and told his</p>
<p>story of an army doctor, brave, public-spirited, and, as it</p>
<p>happened, deeply religious, who was caught one evening by the</p>
<p>excitement of plundering-and stole and hid, twisted the wrist of a</p>
<p>boy until it broke, and was afterwards overcome by wild remorse.</p>
<p>I watched Evesham listening intently. "Strange," he said, "very</p>
<p>strange. We are such stuff as thieves are made of. And in China,</p>
<p>too, they murdered people-for the sake of murdering. Apart, so to</p>
<p>speak, from mercenary considerations. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3948">I'm</a> afraid there's no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3949">doubt</a></p>
<p>of it in certain cases. No <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3949">doubt</a> at all. Young soldiers fresh from</p>
<p>German high schools and English homes!"</p>
<p>"Did OUR people?" asked some patriot.</p>
<p>"Not so much. But <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3950">I'm</a> afraid there were cases… Some of the</p>
<p>Indian troops were pretty bad."</p>
<p>Gane picked up the tale with confirmations.</p>
<p>It is all printed in the vividest way as a picture upon my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3951">memory</a>,</p>
<p>so that were I a painter I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3952">think</a> I could give the deep rich browns</p>
<p>and warm greys beyond the brightly lit table, the various</p>
<p>distinguished faces, strongly illuminated, interested and keen,</p>
<p>above the black and white of evening dress, the alert menservants</p>
<p>with their heavier, clean-shaved faces indistinctly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3953">seen</a> in the</p>
<p>dimness behind. Then this was coloured <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3954">emotionally</a> for me by my</p>
<p>aching sense of loss and sacrifice, and by the chance trend of our</p>
<p>talk to the breaches and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3955">unrealities</a> of the civilised scheme. We</p>
<p>seemed a little transitory circle of light in a universe of darkness</p>
<p>and violence; an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3956">effect</a> to which the diminishing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3957">smell</a> of burning</p>
<p>rubber, the trampling of feet overhead, the swish of water, added</p>
<p>enormously. Everybody-unless, perhaps, it was Evesham-drank</p>
<p>rather carelessly because of the suppressed excitement of our</p>
<p>situation, and talked the louder and more freely.</p>
<p>"But what a flimsy thing our civilisation is!" said Evesham; "a mere</p>
<p>thin net of habits and associations!"</p>
<p>"I suppose those men came back," said Wilkins.</p>
<p>"Lady Paskershortly did!" chuckled Evesham.</p>
<p>"How do they fit it in with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3958">rest</a> of their lives?" Wilkins</p>
<p>speculated. "I suppose there's Pekin-stained police officers,</p>
<p>Pekin-stained J. P.'s-trying petty pilferers in the severest</p>
<p>manner."…</p>
<p>Then for a time things became preposterous. There was a sudden</p>
<p>cascade of water by the fireplace, and then absurdly the ceiling</p>
<p>began to rain upon us, first at this point and then that. "My new</p>
<p>suit!" cried some one. "Perrrrrr-up pe-rr"-a new vertical line of</p>
<p>blackened water would establish itself and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3959">form</a> a spreading pool</p>
<p>upon the gleaming cloth. The men nearest would arrange catchment</p>
<p>areas of plates and flower bowls. "Draw up!" said Tarvrille, "draw</p>
<p>up. That's the bad end of the table!" He turned to the</p>
<p>imperturbable butler. "Take round bath towels," he said; and</p>
<p>presently the men behind us were offering-with inflexible dignity-</p>
<p>"Port wine, Sir. Bath towel, Sir!" Waulsort, with streaks of</p>
<p>blackened water on his forehead, was suddenly reminded of a wet year</p>
<p>when he had followed the French army manoeuvres. An animated</p>
<p>dispute sprang up between him and Neal about the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3960">relative</a> efficiency</p>
<p>of the new French and German field guns. Wrassleton joined in and a</p>
<p>little drunken shrivelled Oxford don of some sort with a black-</p>
<p>splashed shirt front who presently silenced them all by the</p>
<p>immensity and particularity of his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3961">knowledge</a> of field artillery.</p>
<p>Then the talk drifted to Sedan and the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3962">effect</a> of dead horses upon</p>
<p>drinking-water, which brought Wrassleton and Weston Massinghay into</p>
<p>a dispute of great vigour and emphasis. "The trouble in South</p>
<p>Africa," said Weston Massinghay, "wasn't that we didn't boil our</p>
<p>water. It was that we didn't boil our men. The Boers drank the</p>
<p>same stuff we did. THEY didn't get dysentery."</p>
<p>That argument went on for some time. I was attacked across the</p>
<p>table by a man named Burshort about my Endowment of Motherhood</p>
<p>schemes, but in the gaps of that debate I could still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3963">hear</a> Weston</p>
<p>Massinghay at intervals repeat in a rather thickened voice: "THEY</p>
<p>didn't get dysentery."</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3964">think</a> Evesham went early. The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3965">rest</a> of us clustered more and more</p>
<p>closely towards the drier end of the room, the table was pushed</p>
<p>along, and the area beneath the extinguished conflagration abandoned</p>
<p>to a tinkling, splashing company of pots and pans and bowls and</p>
<p>baths. Everybody was now <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3966">disposed</a> to be hilarious and noisy, to say</p>
<p>startling and aggressive things; we must have sounded a queer</p>
<p>clamour to a listener in the next room. The devil inspired them to</p>
<p>begin baiting me. "Ours isn't the Tory party any more," said</p>
<p>Burshort. "Remington has made it the Obstetric Party."</p>
<p>"That's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3967">good</a>!" said Weston Massinghay, with all his teeth gleaming;</p>
<p>"I shall use that against you in the House!"</p>
<p>"I shall denounce you for abusing private confidences if you do,"</p>
<p>said Tarvrille.</p>
<p>"Remington wants us to give up launching Dreadnoughts and launch</p>
<p>babies instead," Burshort urged. "For the price of one Dreadnought-"</p>
<p>The little shrivelled don who had been <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3968">omniscient</a> about guns joined</p>
<p>in the baiting, and displayed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3969">himself</a> a venomous creature.</p>
<p>Something in his eyes told me he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3970">knew</a> Isabel and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3971">hated</a> me for it.</p>
<p>"Love and fine <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3972">thinking</a>," he began, a little thickly, and knocking</p>
<p>over a wine-glass with a too easy gesture. "Love and fine <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3972">thinking</a>.</p>
<p>Two things don't go together. No philosophy worth a damn ever came</p>
<p>out of excesses of love. Salt Lake City-Piggott-Ag-Agapemone</p>
<p>again-no works to matter."</p>
<p>Everybody laughed.</p>
<p>"Got to rec'nise these facts," said my assailant. "Love and fine</p>
<p>think'n pretty phrase-attractive. Suitable for p'litical</p>
<p>dec'rations. Postcard, Christmas, gilt lets, in a wreath of white</p>
<p>flow's. Not oth'wise valu'ble."</p>
<p>I made some remark, I forget what, but he overbore me.</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3973">Real</a> things we want are Hate-Hate and COARSE think'n. I b'long to</p>
<p>the school of Mrs. F's Aunt-"</p>
<p>"What?" said some one, intent.</p>
<p>"In 'Little Dorrit,'" explained Tarvrille; "go on!"</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3974">Hate</a> a fool," said my assailant.</p>
<p>Tarvrille glanced at me. I smiled to conceal the loss of my temper.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3975">Hate</a>," said the little man, emphasising his point with a clumsy</p>
<p>fist. "Hate's the driving force. What's m'rality?-hate of rotten</p>
<p>goings on. What's patriotism?-hate of int'loping foreigners.</p>
<p>What's Radicalism?-hate of lords. What's Toryism?-hate of</p>
<p>disturbance. It's all hate-hate from top to bottom. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3975">Hate</a> of a</p>
<p>mess. Remington owned it the other day, said he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3975">hated</a> a mu'll.</p>
<p>There you are! If you couldn't get <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3975">hate</a> into an election, damn it</p>
<p>(hic) people wou'n't poll. Poll for love!-no' me!"</p>
<p>He paused, but before any one could speak he had resumed.</p>
<p>"Then this about fine <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3976">thinking</a>. Like going into a bear pit armed</p>
<p>with a tagle-talgent-talgent galv'nometer. Like going to fight a</p>
<p>mad dog with Shasepear and the Bible. Fine thinking-what we want</p>
<p>is the thickes' <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3976">thinking</a> we can get. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3976">Thinking</a> that stands up <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3977">alone</a>.</p>
<p>Taf Reform means work for all, thassort of thing."</p>
<p>The gentleman from Cambridge paused. "YOU a flag!" he said. "I'd</p>
<p>as soon go to ba'ell und' wet tissue paper!"</p>
<p>My best answer on the spur of the moment was:</p>
<p>"The Japanese did." Which was absurd.</p>
<p>I went on to some other reply, I forget exactly what, and the talk</p>
<p>of the whole table drew round me. It was an extraordinary</p>
<p>revelation to me. Every one was unusually careless and outspoken,</p>
<p>and it was amazing how manifestly they echoed the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3978">feeling</a> of this</p>
<p>old Tory spokesman. They were quite friendly to me, they regarded</p>
<p>me and the BLUE WEEKLY as valuable party assets for Toryism, but it</p>
<p>was clear they attached no more importance to what were my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3979">realities</a></p>
<p>than they did to the remarkable therapeutic claims of Mrs. Eddy.</p>
<p>They were flushed and amused, perhaps they went a little too far in</p>
<p>their resolves to draw me, but they left the impression on my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3980">mind</a></p>
<p>of men irrevocably set upon narrow and cynical views of political</p>
<p>life. For them the political struggle was a game, whose counters</p>
<p>were human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3981">hate</a> and human credulity; their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3982">real</a> aim was just every</p>
<p>one's aim, the preservation of the class and way of living to which</p>
<p>their lives were attuned. They did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3983">know</a> how tired I was, how</p>
<p>exhausted mentally and morally, nor how cruel their convergent</p>
<p>attack on me chanced to be. But my temper gave way, I became tart</p>
<p>and fierce, perhaps my replies were a trifle absurd, and Tarvrille,</p>
<p>with that quick eye and sympathy of his, came to the rescue. Then</p>
<p>for a time I sat silent and drank port wine while the others talked.</p>
<p>The disorder of the room, the still dripping ceiling, the noise, the</p>
<p>displaced ties and crumpled shirts of my companions, jarred on my</p>
<p>tormented nerves…</p>
<p>It was long past midnight when we dispersed. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3984">remember</a> Tarvrille</p>
<p>coming with me into the hall, and then suggesting we should go</p>
<p>upstairs to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3985">see</a> the damage. A manservant carried up two flickering</p>
<p>candles for us. One end of the room was gutted, curtains, hangings,</p>
<p>several chairs and tables were completely burnt, the panelling was</p>
<p>scorched and warped, three smashed windows made the candles flare</p>
<p>and gutter, and some scraps of broken china still lay on the puddled</p>
<p>floor.</p>
<p>As we surveyed this, Lady Tarvrille appeared, back from some party,</p>
<p>a slender, white-cloaked, satin-footed figure with amazed blue eyes</p>
<p>beneath her golden hair. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3986">remember</a> how stupidly we laughed at her</p>
<p>surprise.</p>

<p>I parted from Panmure at the corner of Aldington Street, and went my</p>
<p>way <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3987">alone</a>. But I did not go home, I turned westward and walked for</p>
<p>a long way, and then struck northward aimlessly. I was too</p>
<p>miserable to go to my house.</p>
<p>I wandered about that night like a man who has discovered his Gods</p>
<p>are dead. I can look back now <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3988">detached</a> yet sympathetic upon that</p>
<p>wild <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3989">confusion</a> of moods and impulses, and by it I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3990">think</a> I can</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3991">understand</a>, oh! half the wrongdoing and blundering in the world.</p>
<p>I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3992">feel</a> now the logical force of the process that must have</p>
<p>convinced me then that I had made my sacrifice and spent my strength</p>
<p>in vain. At no time had I been under any illusion that the Tory</p>
<p>party had higher ideals than any other party, yet it came to me like</p>
<p>a thing newly discovered that the men I had to work with had for the</p>
<p>most part no such <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3993">dreams</a>, no sense of any collective purpose, no</p>
<p>atom of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3994">faith</a> I held. They were just as immediately intent upon</p>
<p>personal ends, just as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3995">limited</a> by habits of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3996">thought</a>, as the men in</p>
<p>any other group or party. Perhaps I had slipped unawares for a time</p>
<p>into the delusions of a party man-but I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3997">think</a> so.</p>
<p>No, it was the mood of profound despondency that had followed upon</p>
<p>the abrupt <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3998">cessation</a> of my familiar intercourse with Isabel, that</p>
<p>gave this fact that had always been present in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3999">mind</a> its quality</p>
<p>of devastating revelation. It seemed as though I had never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4000">seen</a></p>
<p>before nor suspected the stupendous gap between the chaotic aims,</p>
<p>the routine, the conventional acquiescences, the vulgarisations of</p>
<p>the personal life, and that clearly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4001">conscious</a> development and</p>
<p>service of a collective <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4002">thought</a> and purpose at which my efforts</p>
<p>aimed. I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4002">thought</a> them but a little way apart, and now I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4003">saw</a></p>
<p>they were separated by all the distance between earth and heaven. I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4003">saw</a> now in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4004">myself</a> and every one around me, a concentration upon</p>
<p>interests close at hand, an inability to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4005">detach</a> oneself from the</p>
<p>provocations, tendernesses, instinctive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4006">hates</a>, dumb lusts and shy</p>
<p>timidities that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4007">touched</a> one at every point; and, save for rare</p>
<p>exalted moments, a regardlessness of broader aims and remoter</p>
<p>possibilities that made the white passion of statecraft seem as</p>
<p>unearthly and irrelevant to human life as the story an astronomer</p>
<p>will tell, half proven but altogether incredible, of habitable</p>
<p>planets and answering intelligences, suns' distances uncounted</p>
<p>across the deep. It seemed to me I had aspired too high and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4002">thought</a></p>
<p>too far, had mocked my own littleness by presumption, had given the</p>
<p>uttermost dear <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4008">reality</a> of life for a theoriser's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4009">dream</a>.</p>
<p>All through that wandering agony of mine that night a dozen threads</p>
<p>of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4010">thought</a> interwove; now I was a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4011">soul</a> speaking in protest to God</p>
<p>against a task too cold and high for it, and now I was an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4012">angry</a> man,</p>
<p>scorned and pointed upon, who had let life cheat him of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4013">ultimate</a></p>
<p>pride of his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4011">soul</a>. Now I was the fool of ambition, who opened his</p>
<p>box of gold to find blank emptiness, and now I was a spinner of</p>
<p>flimsy <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4010">thoughts</a>, whose web tore to rags at a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4014">touch</a>. I realised for</p>
<p>the first time how much I had come to depend upon the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4015">mind</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4016">faith</a></p>
<p>of Isabel, how she had confirmed me and sustained me, how little</p>
<p>strength I had to go on with our purposes now that she had vanished</p>
<p>from my life. She had been the incarnation of those great</p>
<p>abstractions, the saving <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4017">reality</a>, the voice that answered back.</p>
<p>There was no support that night in the things that had been. We</p>
<p>were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4018">alone</a> together on the cliff for ever more!-that was very</p>
<p>pretty in its way, but it had no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4019">truth</a> whatever that could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4020">help</a> me</p>
<p>now, no ounce of sustaining value. I wanted Isabel that night, no</p>
<p>sentiment or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4021">memory</a> of her, but Isabel alive,-to talk to me, to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4014">touch</a> me, to hold me together. I wanted unendurably the dusky</p>
<p>gentleness of her presence, the consolation of her voice.</p>
<p>We were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4022">alone</a> together on the cliff! I startled a passing cabman</p>
<p>into interest by laughing aloud at that magnificent and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4023">characteristic</a> sentimentality. What a lie it was, and how</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4024">satisfying</a> it had been! That was just where we shouldn't remain.</p>
<p>We of all people had no distinction from that humanity whose lot is</p>
<p>to forget. We should go out to other interests, new <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4025">experiences</a>,</p>
<p>new demands. That tall and intricate fabric of ambitious</p>
<p>understandings we had built up together in our intimacy would be the</p>
<p>first to go; and last perhaps to endure with us would be a few gross</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4026">memories</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4027">sights</a> and sounds, and trivial incidental excitements…</p>
<p>I had a curious <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4028">feeling</a> that night that I had lost <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4029">touch</a> with life</p>
<p>for a long time, and had now been reminded of its quality. That</p>
<p>infernal little don's parody of my ruling phrase, "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4030">Hate</a> and coarse</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4031">thinking</a>," stuck in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4032">thoughts</a> like a poisoned dart, a centre of</p>
<p>inflammation. Just as a man who is debilitated has no longer the</p>
<p>vitality to resist an infection, so my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4033">mind</a>, slackened by the crisis</p>
<p>of my separation from Isabel, could find no resistance to his</p>
<p>emphatic suggestion. It seemed to me that what he had said was</p>
<p>overpoweringly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4034">true</a>, not only of contemporary life, but of all</p>
<p>possible human life. Love is the rare thing, the treasured thing;</p>
<p>you lock it away <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4035">jealously</a> and watch, and well you may; <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4030">hate</a> and</p>
<p>aggression and force keep the streets and rule the world. And fine</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4031">thinking</a> is, in the rough issues of life, weak <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4031">thinking</a>, is a</p>
<p>balancing indecisive process, discovers with disloyal impartiality a</p>
<p>justice and a defect on each disputing side. "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4036">Good</a> honest men," as</p>
<p>Dayton calls them, rule the world, with a way of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4031">thinking</a> out</p>
<p>decisions like shooting cartloads of bricks, and with a steadfast</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4037">pleasure</a> in hostility. Dayton liked to call his antagonists</p>
<p>"blaggards and scoundrels"-it justified his opposition-the Lords</p>
<p>were "scoundrels," all people richer than be were "scoundrels," all</p>
<p>Socialists, all troublesome poor people; he liked to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4038">think</a> of jails</p>
<p>and justice <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4039">being</a> done. His public <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4040">spirit</a> was saturated with the</p>
<p>sombre <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4041">joys</a> of conflict and the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4042">pleasant</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4032">thought</a> of condign</p>
<p>punishment for all recalcitrant <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4043">souls</a>. That was the way of it, I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4044">perceived</a>. That had survival value, as the biologists say. He was</p>
<p>fool enough in politics to be a consistent and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4045">happy</a> politician…</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4046">Hate</a> and coarse <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4047">thinking</a>; how the infernal <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4048">truth</a> of the phrase beat</p>
<p>me down that night! I couldn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4049">remember</a> that I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4050">known</a> this all</p>
<p>along, and that it did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4051">really</a> matter in the slightest degree. I</p>
<p>had worked it all out long ago in other terms, when I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4052">seen</a> how</p>
<p>all parties stood for interests inevitably, and how the purpose in</p>
<p>life achieves itself, if it achieves itself at all, as a bye product</p>
<p>of the war of individuals and classes. Hadn't I always <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4050">known</a> that</p>
<p>science and philosophy elaborate <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4053">themselves</a> in spite of all the</p>
<p>passion and narrowness of men, in spite of the vanities and weakness</p>
<p>of their servants, in spite of all the heated disorder of</p>
<p>contemporary things? Wasn't it my own phrase to speak of "that</p>
<p>greater <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4054">mind</a> in men, in which we are but moments and transitorily</p>
<p>lit cells?" Hadn't I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4050">known</a> that the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4055">spirit</a> of man still speaks like</p>
<p>a thing that struggles out of mud and slime, and that the mere</p>
<p>effort to speak means choking and disaster? Hadn't I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4050">known</a> that we</p>
<p>who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4056">think</a> without <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4057">fear</a> and speak without discretion will not come to</p>
<p>our own for the next two thousand years?</p>
<p>It was the last was most forgotten of all that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4058">faith</a> mislaid.</p>
<p>Before mankind, in my vision that night, stretched new centuries of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4059">confusion</a>, vast stupid wars, hastily conceived laws, foolish</p>
<p>temporary triumphs of order, lapses, set-backs, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4060">despairs</a>,</p>
<p>catastrophes, new beginnings, a multitudinous wilderness of time, a</p>
<p>nigh plotless drama of wrong-headed energies. In order to assuage</p>
<p>my parting from Isabel we had set <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4061">ourselves</a> to imagine great rewards</p>
<p>for our separation, great personal rewards; we had promised</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4061">ourselves</a> success visible and shining in our lives. To console</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4061">ourselves</a> in our separation we had made out of the BLUE WEEKLY and</p>
<p>our young Tory movement preposterously enormous things-as though</p>
<p>those poor fertilising <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4062">touches</a> at the soil were indeed the</p>
<p>germinating seeds of the millennium, as though a million lives such</p>
<p>as ours had not to contribute before the beginning of the beginning.</p>
<p>That poor pretence had failed. That magnificent proposition</p>
<p>shrivelled to nothing in the black <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4063">loneliness</a> of that night.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4064">saw</a> that there were to be no such compensations. So far as my</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4065">real</a> services to mankind were concerned I had to live an</p>
<p>unrecognised and unrewarded life. If I made successes it would be</p>
<p>by the way. Our separation would alter nothing of that. My scandal</p>
<p>would cling to me now for all my life, a thing affecting</p>
<p>relationships, embarrassing and hampering my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4066">spirit</a>. I should</p>
<p>follow the common lot of those who live by the imagination, and</p>
<p>follow it now in infinite <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4067">loneliness</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4068">soul</a>; the one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4069">good</a></p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4070">comforter</a>, the one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4071">effectual</a> familiar, was lost to me for ever; I</p>
<p>should do <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4069">good</a> and evil together, no one caring to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4072">understand</a>; I</p>
<p>should produce much weary work, much bad-spirited work, much</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4073">absolute</a> evil; the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4069">good</a> in me would be too often ill-expressed and</p>
<p>missed or misinterpreted. In the end I might leave one gleaming</p>
<p>flake or so amidst the slag heaps for a moment of postmortem</p>
<p>sympathy. I was afraid beyond measure of my derelict <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4074">self</a>. Because</p>
<p>I believed with all my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4068">soul</a> in love and fine <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4075">thinking</a> that did not</p>
<p>mean that I should necessarily either love steadfastly or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4076">think</a></p>
<p>finely. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4077">remember</a> how I fell talking to God-I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4076">think</a> I talked out</p>
<p>loud. "Why do I care for these things?" I cried, "when I can do so</p>
<p>little! Why am I apart from the jolly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4078">thoughtless</a> fighting life of</p>
<p>men? These <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4079">dreams</a> fade to nothingness, and leave me bare!"</p>
<p>I scolded. "Why don't you speak to a man, show <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4080">yourself</a>? I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4081">thought</a></p>
<p>I had a gleam of you in Isabel,-and then you take her away. Do you</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4082">really</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4083">think</a> I can carry on this game <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4084">alone</a>, doing your work in</p>
<p>darkness and silence, living in muddled conflict, half living, half</p>
<p>dying?"</p>
<p>Grotesque analogies arose in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4085">mind</a>. I discovered a strange</p>
<p>parallelism between my now tattered phrase of "Love and fine</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4086">thinking</a>" and the "Love and the Word" of Christian <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4087">thought</a>. Was it</p>
<p>possible the Christian propaganda had at the outset meant just that</p>
<p>system of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4088">attitudes</a> I had been <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4089">feeling</a> my way towards from the very</p>
<p>beginning of my life? Had I spent a lifetime making my way back to</p>
<p>Christ? It mocks humanity to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4090">think</a> how Christ has been overlaid. I</p>
<p>went along now, recalling long-neglected phrases and sentences; I</p>
<p>had a new vision of that great central figure preaching love with</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4091">hate</a> and coarse <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4086">thinking</a> even in the disciples about Him, rising to</p>
<p>a tidal wave at last in that clamour for Barabbas, and the public</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4092">satisfaction</a> in His fate…</p>
<p>It's curious to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4093">think</a> that hopeless love and a noisy disordered</p>
<p>dinner should lead a man to these speculations, but they did. "He</p>
<p>DID mean that!" I said, and suddenly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4094">thought</a> of what a bludgeon</p>
<p>they'd made of His Christianity. Athwart that perplexing, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4095">patient</a></p>
<p>enigma sitting inaudibly among publicans and sinners, danced and</p>
<p>gibbered a long procession of the champions of orthodoxy. "He</p>
<p>wasn't human," I said, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4096">remembered</a> that last <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4097">despairing</a> cry, "My</p>
<p>God! My God! why hast Thou forsaken Me?"</p>
<p>"Oh, HE forsakes every one," I said, flying out as a tired <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4098">mind</a></p>
<p>will, with an obvious repartee…</p>
<p>I passed at a bound from such monstrous theology to a towering rage</p>
<p>against the Baileys. In an instant and with no sense of absurdity I</p>
<p>wanted-in the intervals of love and fine thinking-to fling about</p>
<p>that strenuously <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4099">virtuous</a> couple; I wanted to kick Keyhole of the</p>
<p>PEEPSHOW into the gutter and make a common massacre of all the</p>
<p>prosperous rascaldom that makes a trade and rule of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4100">virtue</a>. I can</p>
<p>still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4101">feel</a> that transition. In a moment I had reached that phase of</p>
<p>weakly decisive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4102">anger</a> which is for people of my temperament the</p>
<p>concomitant of exhaustion.</p>
<p>"I will have her," I cried. "By Heaven! I WILL have her! Life</p>
<p>mocks me and cheats me. Nothing can be made <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4103">good</a> to me again…</p>
<p>Why shouldn't I save what I can? I can't save <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4104">myself</a> without</p>
<p>her…"</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4105">remember</a> myself-as a sort of anti-climax to that-rather</p>
<p>tediously asking my way home. I was somewhere in the neighbourhood</p>
<p>of Holland Park…</p>
<p>It was then between one and two. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4106">felt</a> that I could go home now</p>
<p>without any risk of meeting Margaret. It had been the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4107">thought</a> of</p>
<p>returning to Margaret that had sent me wandering that night. It is</p>
<p>one of the ugliest facts I recall about that time of crisis, the</p>
<p>intense aversion I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4106">felt</a> for Margaret. No sense of her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4108">goodness</a>, her</p>
<p>injury and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4109">nobility</a>, and the enormous <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4110">generosity</a> of her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4111">forgiveness</a>,</p>
<p>sufficed to mitigate that. I hope now that in this book <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4112">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4113">am</a> able</p>
<p>to give something of her silvery splendour, but all through this</p>
<p>crisis I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4106">felt</a> nothing of that. There was a triumphant kindliness</p>
<p>about her that I found intolerable. She meant to be so kind to me,</p>
<p>to offer unstinted consolation, to meet my needs, to supply just all</p>
<p>she imagined Isabel had given me.</p>
<p>When I left Tarvrille's, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4114">felt</a> I could anticipate exactly how she</p>
<p>would meet my homecoming. She would be perplexed by my crumpled</p>
<p>shirt front, on which I had spilt some drops of wine; she would</p>
<p>overlook that by an effort, explain it sentimentally, resolve it</p>
<p>should make no difference to her. She would want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4115">know</a> who had</p>
<p>been present, what we had talked about, show the alertest interest</p>
<p>in whatever it was-it didn't matter what… No, I couldn't</p>
<p>face her.</p>
<p>So I did not reach my study until two o'clock.</p>
<p>There, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4116">remember</a>, stood the new and very beautiful old silver</p>
<p>candlesticks that she had set there two days since to please me-the</p>
<p>foolish kindliness of it! But in her search for expression,</p>
<p>Margaret heaped presents upon me. She had fitted these candlesticks</p>
<p>with electric lights, and I must, I suppose, have lit them to write</p>
<p>my note to Isabel. "Give me a word-the world aches without you,"</p>
<p>was all I scrawled, though I fully meant that she should come to me.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4117">knew</a>, though I ought not to have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4118">known</a>, that now she had left her</p>
<p>flat, she was with the Balfes-she was to have been married from the</p>
<p>Balfes-and I sent my letter there. And I went out into the silent</p>
<p>square and posted the note forthwith, because I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4117">knew</a> quite clearly</p>
<p>that if I left it until morning I should never post it at all.</p>
</section>

<title>

</title>
<p>I had a curious revulsion of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4119">feeling</a> that morning of our meeting.</p>
<p>(Of all places for such a clandestine encounter she had chosen the</p>
<p>bridge opposite Buckingham Palace.) Overnight I had been full of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4120">self</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4121">pity</a>, and eager for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4122">comfort</a> of Isabel's presence. But the</p>
<p>ill-written scrawl in which she had replied had been full of the</p>
<p>suggestion of her own weakness and misery. And when I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4123">saw</a> her, my</p>
<p>own <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4124">selfish</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4125">sorrows</a> were altogether swept away by a wave of pitiful</p>
<p>tenderness. Something had happened to her that I did not</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4126">understand</a>. She was manifestly ill. She came towards me wearily,</p>
<p>she who had always borne <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4127">herself</a> so bravely; her shoulders seemed</p>
<p>bent, and her eyes were tired, and her face white and drawn. All my</p>
<p>life has been a narrow self-centred life; no brothers, no sisters or</p>
<p>children or weak things had ever yet made any intimate appeal to me,</p>
<p>and suddenly-I verily believe for the first time in my life!-I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4128">felt</a> a great passion of protective ownership; I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4128">felt</a> that here was</p>
<p>something that I could die to shelter, something that meant more</p>
<p>than <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4129">joy</a> or pride or splendid ambitions or splendid creation to me,</p>
<p>a new kind of hold upon me, a new power in the world. Some sealed</p>
<p>fountain was opened in my breast. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4130">knew</a> that I could love Isabel</p>
<p>broken, Isabel beaten, Isabel ugly and in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4131">pain</a>, more than I could</p>
<p>love any sweet or delightful or glorious thing in life. I didn't</p>
<p>care any more for anything in the world but Isabel, and that I</p>
<p>should protect her. I trembled as I came near her, and could</p>
<p>scarcely speak to her for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4132">emotion</a> that filled me…</p>
<p>"I had your letter," I said.</p>
<p>"I had yours."</p>
<p>"Where can we talk?"</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4133">remember</a> my lame sentences. "We'll have a boat. That's best</p>
<p>here."</p>
<p>I took her to the little boat-house, and there we hired a boat, and</p>
<p>I rowed in silence under the bridge and into the shade of a tree.</p>
<p>The square grey stone masses of the Foreign Office loomed through</p>
<p>the twigs, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4134">remember</a>, and a little space of grass separated us from</p>
<p>the pathway and the scrutiny of passers-by. And there we talked.</p>
<p>"I had to write to you," I said.</p>
<p>"I had to come."</p>
<p>"When are you to be married?"</p>
<p>"Thursday week."</p>
<p>"Well?" I said. "But-can we?"</p>
<p>She leant forward and scrutinised my face with eyes wide open.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" she said at last in a whisper.</p>
<p>"Can we stand it? After all?"</p>
<p>I looked at her white face. "Can you?" I said.</p>
<p>She whispered. "Your career?"</p>
<p>Then suddenly her face was contorted,-she wept silently, exactly as</p>
<p>a child tormented beyond endurance might suddenly weep…</p>
<p>"Oh! I don't care," I cried, "now. I don't care. Damn the whole</p>
<p>system of things! Damn all this patching of the irrevocable! I</p>
<p>want to take care of you, Isabel! and have you with me."</p>
<p>"I can't stand it," she blubbered.</p>
<p>"You needn't stand it. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4135">thought</a> it was best for you… I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4135">thought</a> indeed it was best for you. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4135">thought</a> even you wanted it</p>
<p>like that."</p>
<p>"Couldn't I live alone-as I meant to do?"</p>
<p>"No," I said, "you couldn't. You're not strong enough. I've</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4136">thought</a> of that; I've got to shelter you."</p>
<p>"And I want you," I went on. "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4137">I'm</a> not strong enough-I can't stand</p>
<p>life without you."</p>
<p>She stopped weeping, she made a great effort to control <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4138">herself</a>, and</p>
<p>looked at me steadfastly for a moment. "I was going to kill</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4139">myself</a>," she whispered. "I was going to kill <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4139">myself</a> quietly-</p>
<p>somehow. I meant to wait a bit and have an accident. I thought-</p>
<p>you didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4140">understand</a>. You were a man, and couldn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4140">understand</a>…"</p>
<p>"People can't do as we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4141">thought</a> we could do," I said. "We've gone</p>
<p>too far together."</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, and I stared into her eyes.</p>
<p>"The horror of it," she whispered. "The horror of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4142">being</a> handed</p>
<p>over. It's just only begun to dawn upon me, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4143">seeing</a> him now as I do.</p>
<p>He tries to be kind to me… I didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4144">know</a>. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4145">felt</a> adventurous</p>
<p>before… It makes me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4145">feel</a> like all the women in the world who</p>
<p>have ever been owned and subdued… It's not that he isn't the</p>
<p>best of men, it's because <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4146">I'm</a> a part of you… I can't go</p>
<p>through with it. If I go through with it, I shall be left-robbed</p>
<p>of pride-outraged-a woman beaten…"</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4147">know</a>," I said, "I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4147">know</a>."</p>
<p>"I want to live <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4148">alone</a>… I don't care for anything now but just</p>
<p>escape. If you can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4149">help</a> me…"</p>
<p>"I must take you away. There's nothing for us but to go away</p>
<p>together."</p>
<p>"But your work," she said; "your career! Margaret! Our promises!"</p>
<p>"We've made a mess of things, Isabel-or things have made a mess of</p>
<p>us. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4150">know</a> which. Our flags are in the mud, anyhow. It's</p>
<p>too late to save those other things! They have to go. You can't</p>
<p>make terms with defeat. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4151">thought</a> it was Margaret needed me most.</p>
<p>But it's you. And I need you. I didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4152">think</a> of that either. I</p>
<p>haven't a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4153">doubt</a> left in the world now. We've got to leave</p>
<p>everything rather than leave each other. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4154">I'm</a> sure of it. Now we</p>
<p>have gone so far. We've got to go right down to earth and begin</p>
<p>again… Dear, I WANT disgrace with you…"</p>
<p>So I whispered to her as she sat crumpled together on the faded</p>
<p>cushions of the boat, this white and weary young woman who had been</p>
<p>so valiant and careless a girl. "I don't care," I said. "I don't</p>
<p>care for anything, if I can save you out of the wreckage we have</p>
<p>made together."</p>

</title>
<p>The next day I went to the office of the BLUE WEEKLY in order to get</p>
<p>as much as possible of its affairs in working order before I left</p>
<p>London with Isabel. I just missed Shoesmith in the lower office.</p>
<p>Upstairs I found Britten amidst a pile of outside articles,</p>
<p>methodically reading the title of each and sometimes the first half-</p>
<p>dozen lines, and either dropping them in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4155">growing</a> heap on the floor</p>
<p>for a clerk to return, or putting them aside for consideration. I</p>
<p>interrupted him, squatted on the window-sill of the open window, and</p>
<p>sketched out my ideas for the session.</p>
<p>"You're far-sighted," he remarked at something of mine which reached</p>
<p>out ahead.</p>
<p>"I like to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4156">see</a> things prepared," I answered.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, and ripped open the envelope of a fresh aspirant.</p>
<p>I was silent while he read.</p>
<p>"You're going away with Isabel Rivers," he said abruptly.</p>
<p>"Well!" I said, amazed.</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4157">know</a>," he said, and lost his breath. "Not my business. Only-"</p>
<p>It was queer to find Britten afraid to say a thing.</p>
<p>"It's not playing the game," he said.</p>
<p>"What do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4158">know</a>?"</p>
<p>"Everything that matters."</p>
<p>"Some games," I said, "are too hard to play."</p>
<p>There came a pause between us.</p>
<p>"I didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4159">know</a> you were watching all this," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes," he answered, after a pause, "I've watched."</p>
<p>"Sorry-sorry you don't approve."</p>
<p>"It means smashing such an infernal lot of things, Remington."</p>
<p>I did not answer.</p>
<p>"You're going away then?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Soon?"</p>
<p>"Right away."</p>
<p>"There's vour wife."</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4160">know</a>."</p>
<p>"Shoesmith-whom you're pledged to in a manner. You've just picked</p>
<p>him out and made him conspicuous. Every one will <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4161">know</a>. Oh! of</p>
<p>course-it's nothing to you. Honour-"</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4162">know</a>."</p>
<p>"Common decency."</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"All this movement of ours. That's what I care for most…</p>
<p>It's come to be a big thing, Remington."</p>
<p>"That will go on."</p>
<p>"We have a use for you-no one else quite fills it. No one…</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4163">I'm</a> not sure it will go on."</p>
<p>"Do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4164">think</a> I haven't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4165">thought</a> of all these things?"</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and rejected two papers unread.</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4166">knew</a>," he remarked, "when you came back from America. You were</p>
<p>alight with it." Then he let his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4167">bitterness</a> gleam for a moment.</p>
<p>"But I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4168">thought</a> you would stick to your bargain."</p>
<p>"It's not so much choice as you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4169">think</a>," I said.</p>
<p>"There's always a choice."</p>
<p>"No," I said.</p>
<p>He scrutinised my face.</p>
<p>"I can't live without her-I can't work. She's all mixed up with</p>
<p>this-and everything. And besides, there's things you can't</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4170">understand</a>. There's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4171">feelings</a> you've never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4172">felt</a>… You don't</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4170">understand</a> how much we've been to one another."</p>
<p>Britten frowned and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4173">thought</a>.</p>
<p>"Some things one's GOT to do," he threw out.</p>
<p>"Some things one can't do."</p>
<p>"These infernal institutions-"</p>
<p>"Some one must begin," I said.</p>
<p>He shook his head. "Not YOU," he said. "No!"</p>
<p>He stretched out his hands on the desk before him, and spoke again.</p>
<p>"Remington," he said, "I've <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4174">thought</a> of this business day and night</p>
<p>too. It matters to me. It matters immensely to me. In a way-it's</p>
<p>a thing one doesn't often say to a man-I've loved you. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4175">I'm</a> the</p>
<p>sort of man who leads a narrow life… But you've been</p>
<p>something fine and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4176">good</a> for me, since that time, do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4177">remember</a>?</p>
<p>when we talked about Mecca together."</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes. And you'll always be something fine and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4178">good</a> for me anyhow.</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4179">know</a> things about you,-qualities-no mere act can destroy them..</p>
<p>.. Well, I can tell you, you're doing wrong. You're going on now</p>
<p>like a man who is hypnotised and can't turn round. You're piling</p>
<p>wrong on wrong. It was wrong for you two people ever to be lovers."</p>
<p>He paused.</p>
<p>"It gripped us hard," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes!-but in your position! And hers! It was vile!"</p>
<p>"You've not been tempted."</p>
<p>"How do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4180">know</a>? Anyhow-having done that, you ought to have stood</p>
<p>the consequences and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4181">thought</a> of other people. You could have ended</p>
<p>it at the first pause for reflection. You didn't. You blundered</p>
<p>again. You kept on. You owed a certain secrecy to all of us! You</p>
<p>didn't keep it. You were careless. You made things worse. This</p>
<p>engagement and this publicity!-Damn it, Remington!"</p>
<p>"I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4182">know</a>," I said, with smarting eyes. "Damn it! with all my heart!</p>
<p>It came of trying to patch… You CAN'T patch."</p>
<p>"And now, as I care for anything under heaven, Remington, you two</p>
<p>ought to stand these last consequences-and part. You ought to</p>
<p>part. Other people have to stand things! Other people have to</p>
<p>part. You ought to. You say-what do you say? It's loss of so</p>
<p>much life to lose each other. So is losing a hand or a leg. But</p>
<p>it's what you've incurred. Amputate. Take your punishment-After</p>
<p>all, you chose it."</p>
<p>"Oh, damn!" I said, standing up and going to the window.</p>
<p>"Damn by all means. I never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4183">knew</a> a topic so full of justifiable</p>
<p>damns. But you two did choose it. You ought to stick to your</p>
<p>undertaking."</p>
<p>I turned upon him with a snarl in my voice. "My dear Britten!" I</p>
<p>cried. "Don't I KNOW <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4184">I'm</a> doing wrong? Aren't I in a net? Suppose</p>
<p>I don't go! Is there any right in that? Do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4185">think</a> we're going</p>
<p>to be much to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4186">ourselves</a> or any one after this parting? I've been</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4187">thinking</a> all last night of this business, trying it over and over</p>
<p>again from the beginning. How was it we went wrong? Since I came</p>
<p>back from America-I grant you THAT-but SINCE, there's never been a</p>
<p>step that wasn't forced, that hadn't as much right in it or more, as</p>
<p>wrong. You talk as though I was a thing of steel that could bend</p>
<p>this way or that and never change. You talk as though Isabel was a</p>
<p>cat one could give to any kind of owner… We two are things</p>
<p>that change and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4188">grow</a> and alter all the time. We're-so interwoven</p>
<p>that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4189">being</a> parted now will leave us just misshapen cripples…</p>
<p>You don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4190">know</a> the motives, you don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4190">know</a> the rush and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4191">feel</a> of</p>
<p>things, you don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4190">know</a> how it was with us, and how it is with us.</p>
<p>You don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4190">know</a> the hunger for the mere <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4192">sight</a> of one another; you</p>
<p>don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4190">know</a> anything."</p>
<p>Britten looked at his finger-nails closely. His red face puckered</p>
<p>to a wry frown. "Haven't we all at times wanted the world put</p>
<p>back?" he grunted, and looked hard and close at one particular nail.</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"I want her," I said, "and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4193">I'm</a> going to have her. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4193">I'm</a> too tired for</p>
<p>balancing the right or wrong of it any more. You can't separate</p>
<p>them. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4194">saw</a> her yesterday… She's-ill… I'd take her</p>
<p>now, if death were just outside the door waiting for us."</p>
<p>"Torture?"</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4195">thought</a>. "Yes."</p>
<p>"For her?"</p>
<p>"There isn't," I said.</p>
<p>"If there was?"</p>
<p>I made no answer.</p>
<p>"It's blind Want. And there's nothing ever been put into you to</p>
<p>stand against it. What are you going to do with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4196">rest</a> of your</p>
<p>lives?"</p>
<p>"No end of things."</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"I don't believe you are right," I said. "I believe we can save</p>
<p>something-"</p>
<p>Britten shook his head. "Some scraps of salvage won't excuse you,"</p>
<p>he said.</p>
<p>His indignation rose. "In the middle of life!" he said. "No man</p>
<p>has a right to take his hand from the plough!"</p>
<p>He leant forward on his desk and opened an argumentative palm. "You</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4197">know</a>, Remington," he said, "and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4197">know</a>, that if this could be fended</p>
<p>off for six months-if you could be clapped in prison, or got out of</p>
<p>the way somehow,-until this marriage was all over and settled down</p>
<p>for a year, say-you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4197">know</a> then you two could meet, curious, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4198">happy</a>,</p>
<p>as friends. Saved! You KNOW it."</p>
<p>I turned and stared at him. "You're wrong, Britten," I said. "And</p>
<p>does it matter if we could?"</p>
<p>I found that in talking to him I could frame the apologetics I had</p>
<p>not been able to find for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4199">myself</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4200">alone</a>.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4201">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4202">am</a> certain of one thing, Britten. It is our duty not to hush up</p>
<p>this scandal."</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4203">perceived</a> now the element of absurdity in</p>
<p>me, but at the time I was as serious as a man who is burning.</p>
<p>"It's our duty," I went on, "to smash now openly in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4204">sight</a> of</p>
<p>every one. Yes! I've got that as clean and plain-as prison</p>
<p>whitewash. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4205">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4206">am</a> convinced that we have got to be public to the</p>
<p>uttermost now-I mean it-until every corner of our world <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4207">knows</a> this</p>
<p>story, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4207">knows</a> it fully, adds it to the Parnell story and the Ashton</p>
<p>Dean story and the Carmel story and the Witterslea story, and all</p>
<p>the other stories that have picked man after man out of English</p>
<p>public life, the men with active imaginations, the men of strong</p>
<p>initiative. To <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4208">think</a> this tottering old-woman ridden Empire should</p>
<p>dare to waste a man on such a score! You say I ought to be</p>
<p>penitent-"</p>
<p>Britten shook his head and smiled very faintly.</p>
<p>"<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4209">I'm</a> boiling with indignation," I said. " I lay in bed last night</p>
<p>and went through it all. What in God's name was to be expected of</p>
<p>us but what has happened? I went through my life bit by bit last</p>
<p>night, I recalled all I've had to do with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4210">virtue</a> and women, and all</p>
<p>I was told and how I was prepared. I was born into cowardice and</p>
<p>debasement. We all are. Our generation's grimy with hypocrisy. I</p>
<p>came to the most beautiful things in life-like peeping Tom of</p>
<p>Coventry. I was never given a light, never given a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4211">touch</a> of natural</p>
<p>manhood by all this dingy, furtive, canting, humbugging English</p>
<p>world. Thank God! I'll soon be out of it! The shame of it! The</p>
<p>very savages in Australia initiate their children better than the</p>
<p>English do to-day. Neither of us was ever given a view of what they</p>
<p>call morality that didn't make it show as shabby subservience, as</p>
<p>the meanest discretion, an abject submission to unreasonable</p>
<p>prohibitions! meek surrender of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4212">mind</a> and body to the dictation of</p>
<p>pedants and old women and fools. We weren't taught-we were mumbled</p>
<p>at! And when we found that the thing they called unclean, unclean,</p>
<p>was Pagan beauty-God! it was a glory to sin, Britten, it was a</p>
<p>pride and splendour like bathing in the sunlight after dust and</p>
<p>grime!"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Britten. "That's all very well-"</p>
<p>I interrupted him. "I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4213">know</a> there's a case-I'm beginning to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4214">think</a></p>
<p>it a valid case against us; but we never met it! There's a steely</p>
<p>pride in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4215">self</a> restraint, a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4216">nobility</a> of chastity, but only for those</p>
<p>who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4217">see</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4214">think</a> and act-untrammeled and unafraid. The other</p>
<p>thing, the current thing, why! it's worth as much as the chastity of</p>
<p>a monkey kept in a cage by itself!" I put my foot in a chair, and</p>
<p>urged my case upon him. "This is a dirty world, Britten, simply</p>
<p>because it is a muddled world, and the thing you call morality is</p>
<p>dirtier now than the thing you call immorality. Why don't the</p>
<p>moralists pick their stuff out of the slime if they care for it, and</p>
<p>wipe it?-damn them! <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4218">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4219">am</a> burning now to say: 'Yes, we did this and</p>
<p>this,' to all the world. All the world!… I will!"</p>
<p>Britten rubbed the palm of his hand on the corner of his desk.</p>
<p>"That's all very well, Remington," he said. "You mean to go."</p>
<p>He stopped and began again. "If you didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4220">know</a> you were in the</p>
<p>wrong you wouldn't be so damned rhetorical. You're in the wrong.</p>
<p>It's as plain to you as it is to me. You're leaving a big work,</p>
<p>you're leaving a wife who trusted you, to go and live with your</p>
<p>jolly mistress… You won't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4221">see</a> you're a statesman that</p>
<p>matters, that no single man, maybe, might come to such <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4222">influence</a> as</p>
<p>you in the next ten years. You're throwing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4223">yourself</a> away and</p>
<p>accusing your country of rejecting you."</p>
<p>He swung round upon his swivel at me. "Remington," he said, "have</p>
<p>you forgotten the immense things our movement means?"</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4224">thought</a>. "Perhaps <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4225">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4226">am</a> rhetorical," I said.</p>
<p>"But the things we might achieve! If you'd only stay now-even now!</p>
<p>Oh! you'd suffer a little socially, but what of that? You'd be able</p>
<p>to go on-perhaps all the better for hostility of the kind you'd</p>
<p>get. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4227">know</a>, Remington-you KNOW."</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4228">thought</a> and went back to his earlier point. "If <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4229">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4230">am</a> rhetorical,</p>
<p>at any rate it's a living <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4231">feeling</a> behind it. Yes, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4232">remember</a> all</p>
<p>the implications of our aims-very splendid, very remote. But just</p>
<p>now it's rather like offering to give a freezing man the sunlit</p>
<p>Himalayas from end to end in return for his camp-fire. When you</p>
<p>talk of me and my jolly mistress, it isn't fair. That misrepresents</p>
<p>everything. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4233">I'm</a> not going out of this-for delights. That's the</p>
<p>sort of thing men like Snuffles and Keyhole imagine-that excites</p>
<p>them! When I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4234">think</a> of the things these creatures <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4234">think</a>! Ugh! But</p>
<p>YOU <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4235">know</a> better? You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4235">know</a> that physical passion that burns like a</p>
<p>fire-ends clean. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4233">I'm</a> going for love, Britten-if I sinned for</p>
<p>passion. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4233">I'm</a> going, Britten, because when I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4236">saw</a> her the other day</p>
<p>she HURT me. She hurt me damnably, Britten… I've been a cold</p>
<p>man-I've led a rhetorical life-you hit me with that word!-I put</p>
<p>things in a windy way, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4235">know</a>, but what has got hold of me at last</p>
<p>is her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4237">pain</a>. She's ill. Don't you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4238">understand</a>? She's a sick thing-</p>
<p>a weak thing. She's no more a goddess than <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4233">I'm</a> a god… <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4233">I'm</a></p>
<p>not in love with her now; <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4233">I'm</a> RAW with love for her. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4239">feel</a> like a</p>
<p>man that's been flayed. I have been flayed… You don't begin</p>
<p>to imagine the sort of helpless solicitude… She's not going</p>
<p>to do things easily; she's ill. Her courage fails… It's hard</p>
<p>to put things when one isn't rhetorical, but it's this, Britten-</p>
<p>there are distresses that matter more than all the delights or</p>
<p>achievements in the world… I made her what she is-as I never</p>
<p>made Margaret. I've made her-I've broken her… <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4233">I'm</a> going</p>
<p>with my own woman. The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4240">rest</a> of my life and England, and so forth,</p>
<p>must square itself to that…"</p>
<p>For a long time, as it seemed, we remained silent and motionless.</p>
<p>We'd said all we had to say. My eyes caught a printed slip upon the</p>
<p>desk before him, and I came back abruptly to the paper.</p>
<p>I picked up this galley proof. It was one of Winter's essays.</p>
<p>"This man goes on doing first-rate stuff," I said. "I hope you will</p>
<p>keep him going."</p>
<p>He did not answer for a moment or so. "I'll keep him going," he</p>
<p>said at last with a sigh.</p>

<p>I have a letter Margaret wrote me within a week of our flight. I</p>
<p>cannot resist transcribing some of it here, because it lights things</p>
<p>as no word of mine can do. It is a string of nearly inconsecutive</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4241">thoughts</a> written in pencil in a fine, tall, sprawling hand. Its</p>
<p>very inconsecutiveness is essential. Many words are underlined. It</p>
<p>was in answer to one from me; but what I wrote has passed utterly</p>
<p>from my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4242">mind</a>…</p>
<p>"Certainly," she says, "I want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4243">hear</a> from you, but I do not want</p>
<p>to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4244">see</a> you. There's a sort of abstract YOU that I want to go on</p>
<p>with. Something I've made out of you… I want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4245">know</a> things</p>
<p>about you-but I don't want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4244">see</a> or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4246">feel</a> or imagine. When some</p>
<p>day I have got rid of my intolerable sense of proprietorship, it may</p>
<p>be different. Then perhaps we may meet again. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4247">think</a> it is even</p>
<p>more the loss of our political work and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4248">dreams</a> that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4249">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4250">am</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4251">feeling</a></p>
<p>than the loss of your presence. Aching loss. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4252">thought</a> so much of</p>
<p>the things we were DOING for the world-had given <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4253">myself</a> so</p>
<p>unreservedly. You've left me with nothing to DO. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4249">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4250">am</a> suddenly at</p>
<p>loose ends…</p>
<p>"We women are trained to be so dependent on a man. I've got no life</p>
<p>of my own at all. It seems now to me that I wore my clothes even</p>
<p>for you and your schemes…</p>
<p>"After I have told <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4254">myself</a> a hundred times why this has happened, I</p>
<p>ask again, 'Why did he give things up? Why did he give things</p>
<p>up?'…</p>
<p>"It is just as though you were wilfully dead…</p>
<p>"Then I ask again and again whether this thing need have happened at</p>
<p>all, whether if I had had a warning, if I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4255">understood</a> better, I</p>
<p>might not have adapted <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4256">myself</a> to your restless <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4257">mind</a> and made this</p>
<p>catastrophe impossible…</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear! why hadn't you the pluck to hurt me at the beginning,</p>
<p>and tell me what you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4258">thought</a> of me and life? You didn't give me a</p>
<p>chance; not a chance. I suppose you couldn't. All these things you</p>
<p>and I stood away from. You let my first repugnances repel you…</p>
<p>"It is strange to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4259">think</a> after all these years that I should be</p>
<p>asking <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4260">myself</a>, do I love you? have I loved you? In a sense I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4259">think</a></p>
<p>I HATE you. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4261">feel</a> you have taken my life, dragged it in your <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4262">wake</a></p>
<p>for a time, thrown it aside. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4263">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4264">am</a> resentful. Unfairly resentful,</p>
<p>for why should I exact that you should watch and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4265">understand</a> my life,</p>
<p>when clearly I have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4266">understood</a> so little of yours. But <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4263">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4264">am</a> savage-</p>
<p>savage at the wrecking of all you were to do.</p>
<p>"Oh, why-why did you give things up?</p>
<p>"No human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4267">being</a> is his own to do what he likes with. You were not</p>
<p>only pledged to my tiresome, ineffectual companionship, but to great</p>
<p>purposes. They ARE great purposes…</p>
<p>"If only I could take up your work as you leave it, with the</p>
<p>strength you had-then indeed I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4268">feel</a> I could let you go-you and</p>
<p>your young mistress… All that matters so little to me…</p>
<p>"Yet I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4269">think</a> I must indeed love you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4270">yourself</a> in my slower way. At</p>
<p>times <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4271">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4272">am</a> mad with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4273">jealousy</a> at the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4274">thought</a> of all I hadn't the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4275">wit</a></p>
<p>to give you… I've always hidden my tears from you-and what</p>
<p>was in my heart. It's my nature to hide-and you, you want things</p>
<p>brought to you to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4276">see</a>. You are so curious as to be almost cruel.</p>
<p>You don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4277">understand</a> reserves. You have no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4278">mercy</a> with restraints</p>
<p>and reservations. You arc not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4279">really</a> a CIVILISED man at all. You</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4280">hate</a> pretences-and not only pretences but decent coverings…</p>
<p>"It's only after one has lost love and the chance of loving that</p>
<p>slow people like <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4281">myself</a> find what they might have done. Why wasn't</p>
<p>I bold and reckless and abandoned? It's as reasonable to ask that,</p>
<p>I suppose, as to ask why my hair is fair…</p>
<p>"I go on with these perhapses over and over again here when I find</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4282">myself</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4283">alone</a>…</p>
<p>"My dear, my dear, you can't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4284">think</a> of the desolation of things-I</p>
<p>shall never go back to that house we furnished together, that was to</p>
<p>have been the laboratory (do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4285">remember</a> calling it a laboratory?)</p>
<p>in which you were to forge so much of the new order…</p>
<p>"But, dear, if I can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4286">help</a> you-even now-in any way-help both of</p>
<p>you, I mean… It tears me when I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4287">think</a> of you poor and</p>
<p>discredited. You will let me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4286">help</a> you if I can-it will be the last</p>
<p>wrong not to let me do that…</p>
<p>"You had better not get ill. If you do, and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4288">hear</a> of it-I shall</p>
<p>come after you with a troupe of doctor's and nurses. If <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4289">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4290">am</a> a</p>
<p>failure as a wife, no one has ever said I was anything but a success</p>
<p>as a district visitor…"</p>
<p>There are other sheets, but I cannot tell whether they were written</p>
<p>before or after the ones from which I have quoted. And most of them</p>
<p>have little things too intimate to set down. But this oddly</p>
<p>penetrating analysis of our differences must, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4291">think</a>, be given.</p>
<p>"There are all sorts of things I can't express about this and want</p>
<p>to. There's this difference that has always been between us, that</p>
<p>you like nakedness and wildness, and I, clothing and restraint. It</p>
<p>goes through everything. You are always TALKING of order and</p>
<p>system, and the splendid <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4292">dream</a> of the order that might replace the</p>
<p>muddled system you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4293">hate</a>, but by a sort of instinct you seem to want</p>
<p>to break the law. I've watched you so closely. Now I want to obey</p>
<p>laws, to make sacrifices, to follow rules. I don't want to make,</p>
<p>but I do want to keep. You are at once makers and rebels, you and</p>
<p>Isabel too. You're bad people-criminal people, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4294">feel</a>, and yet</p>
<p>full of something the world must have. You're so much better than</p>
<p>me, and so much viler. It may be there is no making without</p>
<p>destruction, but it seems to me sometimes that it is nothing but an</p>
<p>instinct for lawlessness that drives you. You remind me-do you</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4295">remember</a>?-of that time we went from Naples to Vesuvius, and walked</p>
<p>over the hot new lava there. Do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4295">remember</a> how tired I was? I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4296">know</a> it disappointed you that I was tired. One walked there in</p>
<p>spite of the heat because there was a crust; like custom, like law.</p>
<p>But directly a crust <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4297">forms</a> on things, you are restless to break down</p>
<p>to the fire again. You talk of beauty, both of you, as something</p>
<p>terrible, mysterious, imperative. YOUR beauty is something</p>
<p>altogether different from anything I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4296">know</a> or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4294">feel</a>. It has <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4298">pain</a> in</p>
<p>it. Yet you always speak as though it was something I ought to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4294">feel</a></p>
<p>and am dishonest not to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4294">feel</a>. MY beauty is a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4299">quiet</a> thing. You have</p>
<p>always laughed at my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4300">feeling</a> for old-fashioned chintz and blue china</p>
<p>and Sheraton. But I like all these familiar USED things. My beauty</p>
<p>is STILL beauty, and yours, is excitement. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4296">know</a> nothing of the</p>
<p>fascination of the fire, or why one should go deliberately out of</p>
<p>all the decent fine things of life to run dangers and be singed and</p>
<p>tormented and destroyed. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4301">understand</a>…"</p>

<p>6</p>
</title>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4302">remember</a> very freshly the mood of our departure from London, the</p>
<p>platform of Charing Cross with the big illuminated clock overhead,</p>
<p>the bustle of porters and passengers with luggage, the shouting of</p>
<p>newsboys and boys with flowers and sweets, and the groups of friends</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4303">seeing</a> travellers off by the boat train. Isabel sat very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4304">quiet</a> and</p>
<p>still in the compartment, and I stood upon the platform with the</p>
<p>door open, with a curious reluctance to take the last step that</p>
<p>should sever me from London 's ground. I showed our tickets, and</p>
<p>bought a handful of red roses for her. At last came the guards</p>
<p>crying: "Take your seats," and I got in and closed the door on me.</p>
<p>We had, thank Heaven! a compartment to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4305">ourselves</a>. I let down the</p>
<p>window and stared out.</p>
<p>There was a bustle of final adieux on the platform, a cry of "Stand</p>
<p>away, please, stand away!" and the train was gliding slowly and</p>
<p>smoothly out of the station.</p>
<p>I looked out upon the river as the train rumbled with slowly</p>
<p>gathering pace across the bridge, and the bobbing black heads of the</p>
<p>pedestrians in the footway, and the curve of the river and the</p>
<p>glowing great hotels, and the lights and reflections and blacknesses</p>
<p>of that old, familiar spectacle. Then with a common <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4306">thought</a>, we</p>
<p>turned our eyes westward to where the pinnacles of Westminster and</p>
<p>the shining clock tower rose hard and clear against the still,</p>
<p>luminous sky.</p>
<p>"They'll be in Committee on the Reformatory Bill to-night," I said,</p>
<p>a little stupidly.</p>
<p>"And so," I added, "good-bye to London!"</p>
<p>We said no more, but watched the south-side streets below-bright</p>
<p>gleams of lights and movement, and the dark, dim, monstrous shapes</p>
<p>of houses and factories. We ran through Waterloo Station, London</p>
<p>Bridge, New Cross, St. John's. We said never a word. It seemed to</p>
<p>me that for a time we had exhausted our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4307">emotions</a>. We had escaped,</p>
<p>we had cut our knot, we had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4308">accepted</a> the last penalty of that</p>
<p>headlong return of mine from Chicago a year and a half ago. That</p>
<p>was all settled. That harvest of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4309">feelings</a> we had reaped. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4310">thought</a></p>
<p>now only of London, of London as the symbol of all we were leaving</p>
<p>and all we had lost in the world. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4311">felt</a> nothing now but an</p>
<p>enormous and overwhelming regret…</p>
<p>The train swayed and rattled on its way. We ran through old</p>
<p>Bromstead, where once I had played with cities and armies on the</p>
<p>nursery floor. The sprawling suburbs with their scattered lights</p>
<p>gave way to dim tree-set country under a cloud-veiled,</p>
<p>intermittently shining moon. We passed Cardcaster Place. Perhaps</p>
<p>old Wardingham, that pillar of the old Conservatives, was there,</p>
<p>fretting over his unsuccessful struggle with our young Toryism.</p>
<p>Little he recked of this new turn of the wheel and how it would</p>
<p>confirm his contempt of all our novelties. Perhaps some faint</p>
<p>intimation drew him to the window to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4312">see</a> behind the stems of the</p>
<p>young fir trees that bordered his domain, the little string of</p>
<p>lighted carriage windows gliding southward…</p>
<p>Suddenly I began to realise just what it was we were doing.</p>
<p>And now, indeed, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4313">knew</a> what London had been to me, London where I</p>
<p>had been born and educated, the slovenly mother of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4314">mind</a> and all</p>
<p>my ambitions, London and the empire! It seemed to me we must be</p>
<p>going out to a world that was utterly empty. All our significance</p>
<p>fell from us-and before us was no meaning any more. We were</p>
<p>leaving London; my hand, which had gripped so hungrily upon its</p>
<p>complex life, had been forced from it, my fingers left their hold.</p>
<p>That was over. I should never have a voice in public affairs again.</p>
<p>The inexorable unwritten law which forbids overt scandal sentenced</p>
<p>me. We were going out to a new life, a life that appeared in that</p>
<p>moment to be a mere shrivelled remnant of me, a mere residuum of</p>
<p>sheltering and feeding and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4315">seeing</a> amidst alien scenery and the sound</p>
<p>of unfamiliar tongues. We were going to live cheaply in a foreign</p>
<p>place, so cut off that I meet now the merest stray tourist, the</p>
<p>commonest tweed-clad stranger with a mixture of shyness and hunger…</p>
<p>And suddenly all the schemes I was leaving appeared fine and</p>
<p>adventurous and hopeful as they had never done before. How great</p>
<p>was this purpose I had relinquished, this bold and subtle remaking</p>
<p>of the English will! I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4316">doubted</a> so many things, and now suddenly</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4316">doubted</a> my unimportance, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4316">doubted</a> my right to this suicidal</p>
<p>abandonment. Was I not a trusted messenger, greatly trusted and</p>
<p>favoured, who had turned aside by the way? Had I not, after all,</p>
<p>stood for far more than I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4317">thought</a>; was I not filching from that</p>
<p>dear great city of my birth and life, some vitally necessary thing,</p>
<p>a key, a link, a reconciling clue in her political development, that</p>
<p>now she might seek vaguely for in vain? What is one life against</p>
<p>the State? Ought I not to have sacrificed Isabel and all my passion</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4318">sorrow</a> for Isabel, and held to my thing-stuck to my thing?</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4319">heard</a> as though he had spoken it in the carriage Britten's "It WAS</p>
<p>a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4320">good</a> game. No end of a game. And for the first time I imagined</p>
<p>the faces and voices of Crupp and Esmeer and Gane when they learnt</p>
<p>of this secret flight, this flight of which they were quite</p>
<p>unwarned. And Shoesmith might he there in the house,-Shoesmith who</p>
<p>was to have been married in four days-the thing might hit him full</p>
<p>in front of any kind of people. Cruel eyes might watch him. Why</p>
<p>the devil hadn't I written letters to warn them all? I could have</p>
<p>posted them five minutes before the train started. I had never</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4321">thought</a> to that moment of the immense mess they would be in; how the</p>
<p>whole edifice would clatter about their ears. I had a sudden <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4322">desire</a></p>
<p>to stop the train and go back for a day, for two days, to set that</p>
<p>negligence right. My brain for a moment brightened, became animated</p>
<p>and prolific of ideas. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4321">thought</a> of a brilliant line we might have</p>
<p>taken on that confounded Reformatory Bill…</p>
<p>That sort of thing was over…</p>
<p>What indeed wasn't over? I passed to a vaguer, more multitudinous</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4323">perception</a> of disaster, the friends I had lost already since Altiora</p>
<p>began her campaign, the ampler remnant whom now I must lose. I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4324">thought</a> of people I had been merry with, people I had worked with</p>
<p>and played with, the companions of talkative walks, the hostesses of</p>
<p>houses that had once glowed with welcome for us both. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4323">perceived</a></p>
<p>we must lose them all. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4325">saw</a> life like a tree in late autumn that</p>
<p>had once been rich and splendid with friends-and now the last brave</p>
<p>dears would be hanging on <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4326">doubtfully</a> against the frosty chill of</p>
<p>facts, twisting and tortured in the universal gale of indignation,</p>
<p>trying to evade the cold blast of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4327">truth</a>. I had betrayed my</p>
<p>party, my intimate friend, my wife, the wife whose devotion had made</p>
<p>me what I was. For awhile the figure of Margaret, remote, wounded,</p>
<p>shamed, dominated my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4328">mind</a>, and the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4324">thought</a> of my immense</p>
<p>ingratitude. Damn them! they'd take it out of her too. I had a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4329">feeling</a> that I wanted to go straight back and grip some one by the</p>
<p>throat, some one talking ill of Margaret. They'd blame her for not</p>
<p>keeping me, for letting things go so far… I wanted the whole</p>
<p>world to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4330">know</a> how fine she was. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4325">saw</a> in imagination the busy,</p>
<p>excited dinner tables at work upon us all, rather <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4331">pleasantly</a></p>
<p>excited, brightly indignant, merciless.</p>
<p>Well, it's the stuff we are!…</p>
<p>Then suddenly, stabbing me to the heart, came a vision of Margaret's</p>
<p>tears and the sound of her voice saying, "Husband mine! Oh! husband</p>
<p>mine! To <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4332">see</a> you cry!"…</p>
<p>I came out of a cloud of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4333">thoughts</a> to discover the narrow</p>
<p>compartment, with its feeble lamp overhead, and our rugs and hand-</p>
<p>baggage swaying on the rack, and Isabel, very still in front of me,</p>
<p>gripping my wilting red roses tightly in her bare and ringless hand.</p>
<p>For a moment I could not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4334">understand</a> her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4335">attitude</a>, and then I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4336">perceived</a> she was sitting bent together with her head averted from</p>
<p>the light to hide the tears that were streaming down her face. She</p>
<p>had not got her handkerchief out for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4337">fear</a> that I should <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4338">see</a> this,</p>
<p>but I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4339">saw</a> her tears, dark drops of tears, upon her sleeve…</p>
<p>I suppose she had been watching my expression, divining my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4340">thoughts</a>.</p>
<p>For a time I stared at her and was motionless, in a sort of still</p>
<p>and weary amazement. Why had we done this injury to one another?</p>
<p>WHY? Then something stirred within me.</p>
<p>"ISABEL!" I whispered.</p>
<p>She made no sign.</p>
<p>"Isabel!" I repeated, and then crossed over to her and crept closely</p>
<p>to her, put my arm about her, and drew her wet cheek to mine.</p>
