<p>PREFACE</p>
</title>
<p>THE WORLD SET FREE was written in 1913 and published early in</p>
<p>1914, and it is the latest of a series of three fantasias of</p>
<p>possibility, stories which all turn on the possible developments</p>
<p>in the future of some contemporary force or group of forces. The</p>
<p>World Set Free was written under the immediate shadow of the</p>
<p>Great War. Every intelligent person in the world <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1">felt</a> that</p>
<p>disaster was impending and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_2">knew</a> no way of averting it, but few of</p>
<p>us realised in the earlier half of 1914 how near the crash was to</p>
<p>us. The reader will be amused to find that here it is put off</p>
<p>until the year 1956. He may naturally want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_3">know</a> the reason</p>
<p>for what will seem now a quite extraordinary delay. As a</p>
<p>prophet, the author must confess he has always been inclined to</p>
<p>be rather a slow prophet. The war aeroplane in the world of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4">reality</a>, for example, beat the forecast in Anticipations by about</p>
<p>twenty years or so. I suppose a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_5">desire</a> not to shock the sceptical</p>
<p>reader's sense of use and wont and perhaps a less creditable</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_6">disposition</a> to hedge, have something to do with this dating</p>
<p>forward of one's main events, but in the particular case of The</p>
<p>World Set Free there was, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_7">think</a>, another motive in holding the</p>
<p>Great War back, and that was to allow the chemist to get well</p>
<p>forward with his discovery of the release of atomic energy.</p>
<p>1956-or for that matter 2056-may be none too late for that</p>
<p>crowning revolution in human potentialities. And apart from this</p>
<p>procrastination of over forty years, the guess at the opening</p>
<p>phase of the war was fairly lucky; the forecast of an alliance of</p>
<p>the Central Empires, the opening campaign through the</p>
<p>Netherlands, and the despatch of the British Expeditionary Force</p>
<p>were all justified before the book had been published six months.</p>
<p>And the opening section of Chapter the Second remains now, after</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_4">reality</a> has happened, a fairly adequate diagnosis of the</p>
<p>essentials of the matter. One <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_8">happy</a> hit (in Chapter the Second,</p>
<p>Section 2), on which the writer may congratulate <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_9">himself</a>, is the</p>
<p>forecast that under modern <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_10">conditions</a> it would be quite</p>
<p>impossible for any great general to emerge to supremacy and</p>
<p>concentrate the enthusiasm of the armies of either side. There</p>
<p>could be no Alexanders or Napoleons. And we soon <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_11">heard</a> the</p>
<p>scientific corps muttering, 'These old fools,' exactly as it is</p>
<p>here foretold.</p>
<p>These, however, are small details, and the misses in the story</p>
<p>far outnumber the hits. It is the main thesis which is still of</p>
<p>interest now; the thesis that because of the development of</p>
<p>scientific <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_12">knowledge</a>, separate sovereign <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_13">states</a> and separate</p>
<p>sovereign empires are no longer possible in the world, that to</p>
<p>attempt to keep on with the old system is to heap disaster upon</p>
<p>disaster for mankind and perhaps to destroy our race altogether.</p>
<p>The remaining interest of this book now is the sustained validity</p>
<p>of this thesis and the discussion of the possible ending of war</p>
<p>on the earth. I have supposed a sort of epidemic of sanity to</p>
<p>break out among the rulers of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_13">states</a> and the leaders of mankind.</p>
<p>I have represented the native common sense of the French <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_14">mind</a> and</p>
<p>of the English mind-for manifestly King Egbert is meant to be</p>
<p>'God's Englishman'-leading mankind towards a bold and resolute</p>
<p>effort of salvage and reconstruction. Instead of which, as the</p>
<p>school book footnotes say, compare to-day's newspaper. Instead</p>
<p>of a frank and honourable gathering of leading men, Englishman</p>
<p>meeting German and Frenchman Russian, brothers in their offences</p>
<p>and in their disaster, upon the hills of Brissago, beheld in</p>
<p>Geneva at the other end of Switzerland a poor little League of</p>
<p>(Allied) Nations (excluding the United States, Russia, and most</p>
<p>of the 'subject peoples' of the world), meeting obscurely amidst</p>
<p>a world-wide disregard to make impotent gestures at the leading</p>
<p>problems of the debacle. Either the disaster has not been vast</p>
<p>enough yet or it has not been swift enough to inflict the</p>
<p>necessary moral shock and achieve the necessary moral revulsion.</p>
<p>Just as the world of 1913 was used to an increasing prosperity</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_15">thought</a> that increase would go on for ever, so now it would</p>
<p>seem the world is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_16">growing</a> accustomed to a steady glide towards</p>
<p>social disintegration, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_15">thinks</a> that that too can go on</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_17">continually</a> and never come to a final bump. So soon do use and</p>
<p>wont establish <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_18">themselves</a>, and the most flaming and thunderous of</p>
<p>lessons pale into disregard.</p>
<p>The question whether a Leblanc is still possible, the question</p>
<p>whether it is still possible to bring about an outbreak of</p>
<p>creative sanity in mankind, to avert this steady glide to</p>
<p>destruction, is now one of the most urgent in the world. It is</p>
<p>clear that the writer is temperamentally <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_19">disposed</a> to hope that</p>
<p>there is such a possibility. But he has to confess that he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_20">sees</a></p>
<p>few signs of any such breadth of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_21">understanding</a> and steadfastness</p>
<p>of will as an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_22">effectual</a> effort to turn the rush of human affairs</p>
<p>demands. The inertia of dead ideas and old institutions carries</p>
<p>us on towards the rapids. Only in one direction is there any</p>
<p>plain recognition of the idea of a human commonweal as something</p>
<p>overriding any national and patriotic consideration, and that is</p>
<p>in the working class movement throughout the world. And labour</p>
<p>internationalism is closely bound up with conceptions of a</p>
<p>profound social revolution. If world peace is to be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_23">attained</a></p>
<p>through labour internationalism, it will have to be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_23">attained</a> at</p>
<p>the price of the completest social and economic reconstruction</p>
<p>and by passing through a phase of revolution that will certainly</p>
<p>be violent, that may be very bloody, which may be prolonged</p>
<p>through a long period, and may in the end fail to achieve</p>
<p>anything but social destruction. Nevertheless, the fact remains</p>
<p>that it is in the labour class, and the labour class <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_24">alone</a>, that</p>
<p>any conception of a world rule and a world peace has so far</p>
<p>appeared. The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_25">dream</a> of The World Set Free, a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_25">dream</a> of highly</p>
<p>educated and highly favoured leading and ruling men, voluntarily</p>
<p>setting <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_26">themselves</a> to the task of reshaping the world, has thus</p>
<p>far remained a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_25">dream</a>.</p>

<p>Section I</p>
<p>THE history of mankind is the history of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_27">attainment</a> of</p>
<p>external power. Man is the tool-using, fire-making animal. From</p>
<p>the outset of his terrestrial career we find him supplementing</p>
<p>the natural strength and bodily weapons of a beast by the heat of</p>
<p>burning and the rough implement of stone. So he passed beyond</p>
<p>the ape. From that he expands. Presently he added to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_28">himself</a> the</p>
<p>power of the horse and the ox, he borrowed the carrying strength</p>
<p>of water and the driving force of the wind, he quickened his fire</p>
<p>by blowing, and his simple tools, pointed first with copper and</p>
<p>then with iron, increased and varied and became more elaborate</p>
<p>and efficient. He sheltered his heat in houses and made his way</p>
<p>easier by paths and roads. He complicated his social</p>
<p>relationships and increased his efficiency by the division of</p>
<p>labour. He began to store up <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_29">knowledge</a>. Contrivance followed</p>
<p>contrivance, each making it possible for a man to do more.</p>
<p>Always down the lengthening record, save for a set-back ever and</p>
<p>again, he is doing more… A quarter of a million years ago the</p>
<p>utmost man was a savage, a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_30">being</a> scarcely articulate, sheltering</p>
<p>in holes in the rocks, armed with a rough-hewn flint or a</p>
<p>fire-pointed stick, naked, living in small family groups, killed</p>
<p>by some younger man so soon as his first virile activity</p>
<p>declined. Over most of the great wildernesses of earth you would</p>
<p>have sought him in vain; only in a few temperate and sub-tropical</p>
<p>river valleys would you have found the squatting lairs of his</p>
<p>little herds, a male, a few females, a child or so.</p>
<p>He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_31">knew</a> no future then, no kind of life except the life he led.</p>
<p>He fled the cave-bear over the rocks full of iron ore and the</p>
<p>promise of sword and spear; he froze to death upon a ledge of</p>
<p>coal; he drank water muddy with the clay that would one day make</p>
<p>cups of porcelain; he chewed the ear of wild wheat he had plucked</p>
<p>and gazed with a dim speculation in his eyes at the birds that</p>
<p>soared beyond his reach. Or suddenly he became aware of the scent</p>
<p>of another male and rose up roaring, his roars the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_32">formless</a></p>
<p>precursors of moral admonitions. For he was a great</p>
<p>individualist, that original, he suffered none other than</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_33">himself</a>.</p>
<p>So through the long generations, this heavy precursor, this</p>
<p>ancestor of all of us, fought and bred and perished, changing</p>
<p>almost imperceptibly.</p>
<p>Yet he changed. That keen chisel of necessity which sharpened</p>
<p>the tiger's claw age by age and fined down the clumsy Orchippus</p>
<p>to the swift grace of the horse, was at work upon him-is at work</p>
<p>upon him still. The clumsier and more stupidly fierce among him</p>
<p>were killed soonest and oftenest; the finer hand, the quicker</p>
<p>eye, the bigger brain, the better balanced body prevailed; age by</p>
<p>age, the implements were a little better made, the man a little</p>
<p>more delicately adjusted to his possibilities. He became more</p>
<p>social; his herd <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_34">grew</a> larger; no longer did each man kill or</p>
<p>drive out his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_35">growing</a> sons; a system of taboos made them</p>
<p>tolerable to him, and they revered him alive and soon even after</p>
<p>he was dead, and were his allies against the beasts and the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_36">rest</a></p>
<p>of mankind. (But they were forbidden to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_37">touch</a> the women of the</p>
<p>tribe, they had to go out and capture women for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_38">themselves</a>, and</p>
<p>each son fled from his stepmother and hid from her lest the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_39">anger</a></p>
<p>of the Old Man should be roused. All the world over, even to this</p>
<p>day, these ancient inevitable taboos can be traced.) And now</p>
<p>instead of caves came huts and hovels, and the fire was better</p>
<p>tended and there were wrappings and garments; and so aided, the</p>
<p>creature spread into colder climates, carrying food with him,</p>
<p>storing food-until sometimes the neglected grass-seed sprouted</p>
<p>again and gave a first hint of agriculture.</p>
<p>And already there were the beginnings of leisure and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_40">thought</a>.</p>
<p>Man began to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_41">think</a>. There were times when he was fed, when his</p>
<p>lusts and his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_42">fears</a> were all appeased, when the sun shone upon</p>
<p>the squatting-place and dim stirrings of speculation lit his</p>
<p>eyes. He scratched upon a bone and found resemblance and pursued</p>
<p>it and began pictorial art, moulded the soft, warm clay of the</p>
<p>river brink between his fingers, and found a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_43">pleasure</a> in its</p>
<p>patternings and repetitions, shaped it into the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_44">form</a> of vessels,</p>
<p>and found that it would hold water. He watched the streaming</p>
<p>river, and wondered from what bountiful breast this incessant</p>
<p>water came; he blinked at the sun and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_45">dreamt</a> that perhaps he</p>
<p>might snare it and spear it as it went down to its resting-place</p>
<p>amidst the distant hills. Then he was roused to convey to his</p>
<p>brother that once indeed he had done so-at least that some one</p>
<p>had done so-he mixed that perhaps with another <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_45">dream</a> almost as</p>
<p>daring, that one day a mammoth had been beset; and therewith</p>
<p>began fiction-pointing a way to achievement-and the august</p>
<p>prophetic procession of tales.</p>
<p>For scores and hundreds of centuries, for myriads of generations</p>
<p>that life of our fathers went on. From the beginning to the</p>
<p>ripening of that phase of human life, from the first clumsy</p>
<p>eolith of rudely chipped flint to the first implements of</p>
<p>polished stone, was two or three thousand centuries, ten or</p>
<p>fifteen thousand generations. So slowly, by human standards, did</p>
<p>humanity gather itself together out of the dim intimations of the</p>
<p>beast. And that first glimmering of speculation, that first</p>
<p>story of achievement, that story-teller bright-eyed and flushed</p>
<p>under his matted hair, gesticulating to his gaping, incredulous</p>
<p>listener, gripping his wrist to keep him attentive, was the most</p>
<p>marvellous beginning this world has ever <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_46">seen</a>. It doomed the</p>
<p>mammoths, and it began the setting of that snare that shall catch</p>
<p>the sun.</p>
<p>Section 2</p>
<p>That <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_47">dream</a> was but a moment in a man's life, whose proper</p>
<p>business it seemed was to get food and kill his fellows and beget</p>
<p>after the manner of all that belongs to the fellowship of the</p>
<p>beasts. About him, hidden from him by the thinnest of veils, were</p>
<p>the untouched sources of Power, whose magnitude we scarcely do</p>
<p>more than suspect even to-day, Power that could make his every</p>
<p>conceivable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_47">dream</a> come <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_48">real</a>. But the feet of the race were in</p>
<p>the way of it, though he died blindly unknowing.</p>
<p>At last, in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_49">generous</a> levels of warm river valleys, where food</p>
<p>is abundant and life very easy, the emerging human overcoming his</p>
<p>earlier <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_50">jealousies</a>, becoming, as necessity persecuted him less</p>
<p>urgently, more social and tolerant and amenable, achieved a</p>
<p>larger community. There began a division of labour, certain of</p>
<p>the older men specialised in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_51">knowledge</a> and direction, a strong</p>
<p>man took the fatherly leadership in war, and priest and king</p>
<p>began to develop their roles in the opening drama of man's</p>
<p>history. The priest's solicitude was seed-time and harvest and</p>
<p>fertility, and the king ruled peace and war. In a hundred river</p>
<p>valleys about the warm, temperate zone of the earth there were</p>
<p>already towns and temples, a score of thousand years ago. They</p>
<p>flourished unrecorded, ignoring the past and unsuspicious of the</p>
<p>future, for as yet writing had still to begin.</p>
<p>Very slowly did man increase his demand upon the illimitable</p>
<p>wealth of Power that offered itself on every hand to him. He</p>
<p>tamed certain animals, he developed his primordially haphazard</p>
<p>agriculture into a ritual, he added first one metal to his</p>
<p>resources and then another, until he had copper and tin and iron</p>
<p>and lead and gold and silver to supplement his stone, he hewed</p>
<p>and carved wood, made pottery, paddled down his river until he</p>
<p>came to the sea, discovered the wheel and made the first roads.</p>
<p>But his chief activity for a hundred centuries and more, was the</p>
<p>subjugation of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_52">himself</a> and others to larger and larger societies.</p>
<p>The history of man is not simply the conquest of external power;</p>
<p>it is first the conquest of those distrusts and fiercenesses,</p>
<p>that self-concentration and intensity of animalism, that tie his</p>
<p>hands from taking his inheritance. The ape in us still resents</p>
<p>association. From the dawn of the age of polished stone to the</p>
<p>achievement of the Peace of the World, man's dealings were</p>
<p>chiefly with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_52">himself</a> and his fellow man, trading, bargaining,</p>
<p>law-making, propitiating, enslaving, conquering, exterminating,</p>
<p>and every little increment in Power, he turned at once and always</p>
<p>turns to the purposes of this <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_53">confused</a> elaborate struggle to</p>
<p>socialise. To incorporate and comprehend his fellow men into a</p>
<p>community of purpose became the last and greatest of his</p>
<p>instincts. Already before the last polished phase of the stone</p>
<p>age was over he had become a political animal. He made</p>
<p>astonishingly far-reaching discoveries within <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_52">himself</a>, first of</p>
<p>counting and then of writing and making records, and with that</p>
<p>his town communities began to stretch out to dominion; in the</p>
<p>valleys of the Nile, the Euphrates, and the great Chinese rivers,</p>
<p>the first empires and the first written laws had their</p>
<p>beginnings. Men specialised for fighting and rule as soldiers and</p>
<p>knights. Later, as ships <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_54">grew</a> seaworthy, the Mediterranean which</p>
<p>had been a barrier became a highway, and at last out of a tangle</p>
<p>of pirate polities came the great struggle of Carthage and Rome.</p>
<p>The history of Europe is the history of the victory and breaking</p>
<p>up of the Roman Empire. Every ascendant monarch in Europe up to</p>
<p>the last, aped Caesar and called <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_52">himself</a> Kaiser or Tsar or</p>
<p>Imperator or Kasir-i-Hind. Measured by the duration of human life</p>
<p>it is a vast space of time between that first dynasty in Egypt</p>
<p>and the coming of the aeroplane, but by the scale that looks back</p>
<p>to the makers of the eoliths, it is all of it a story of</p>
<p>yesterday.</p>
<p>Now during this period of two hundred centuries or more, this</p>
<p>period of the warring <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_55">states</a>, while men's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_56">minds</a> were chiefly</p>
<p>preoccupied by politics and mutual aggression, their progress in</p>
<p>the acquirement of external Power was slow-rapid in comparison</p>
<p>with the progress of the old stone age, but slow in comparison</p>
<p>with this new age of systematic discovery in which we live. They</p>
<p>did not very greatly alter the weapons and tactics of warfare,</p>
<p>the methods of agriculture, seamanship, their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_57">knowledge</a> of the</p>
<p>habitable globe, or the devices and utensils of domestic life</p>
<p>between the days of the early Egyptians and the days when</p>
<p>Christopher Columbus was a child. Of course, there were</p>
<p>inventions and changes, but there were also retrogressions;</p>
<p>things were found out and then forgotten again; it was, on the</p>
<p>whole, a progress, but it contained no steps; the peasant life</p>
<p>was the same, there were already priests and lawyers and town</p>
<p>craftsmen and territorial lords and rulers doctors, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_58">wise</a> women,</p>
<p>soldiers and sailors in Egypt and China and Assyria and</p>
<p>south-eastern Europe at the beginning of that period, and they</p>
<p>were doing much the same things and living much the same life as</p>
<p>they were in Europe in A.D. 1500. The English excavators of the</p>
<p>year A.D. 1900 could delve into the remains of Babylon and Egypt</p>
<p>and disinter legal documents, domestic accounts, and family</p>
<p>correspondence that they could read with the completest sympathy.</p>
<p>There were great religious and moral changes throughout the</p>
<p>period, empires and republics replaced one another, Italy tried a</p>
<p>vast experiment in slavery, and indeed slavery was tried again</p>
<p>and again and failed and failed and was still to be tested again</p>
<p>and rejected again in the New World; Christianity and</p>
<p>Mohammedanism swept away a thousand more specialised cults, but</p>
<p>essentially these were progressive adaptations of mankind to</p>
<p>material <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_59">conditions</a> that must have seemed fixed for ever. The</p>
<p>idea of revolutionary changes in the material <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_59">conditions</a> of life</p>
<p>would have been entirely strange to human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_60">thought</a> through all</p>
<p>that time.</p>
<p>Yet the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_61">dreamer</a>, the story-teller, was there still, waiting for</p>
<p>his opportunity amidst the busy preoccupations, the comings and</p>
<p>goings, the wars and processions, the castle building and</p>
<p>cathedral building, the arts and loves, the small diplomacies and</p>
<p>incurable feuds, the crusades and trading journeys of the middle</p>
<p>ages. He no longer speculated with the untrammelled freedom of</p>
<p>the stone-age savage; authoritative explanations of everything</p>
<p>barred his path; but he speculated with a better brain, sat idle</p>
<p>and gazed at circling stars in the sky and mused upon the coin</p>
<p>and crystal in his hand. Whenever there was a certain leisure for</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_62">thought</a> throughout these times, then men were to be found</p>
<p>dissatisfied with the appearances of things, dissatisfied with</p>
<p>the assurances of orthodox belief, uneasy with a sense of unread</p>
<p>symbols in the world about them, questioning the finality of</p>
<p>scholastic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_63">wisdom</a>. Through all the ages of history there were</p>
<p>men to whom this whisper had come of hidden things about them.</p>
<p>They could no longer lead ordinary lives nor content <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_64">themselves</a></p>
<p>with the common things of this world once they had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_65">heard</a> this</p>
<p>voice. And mostly they believed not only that all this world was</p>
<p>as it were a painted curtain before things unguessed at, but that</p>
<p>these secrets were Power. Hitherto Power had come to men by</p>
<p>chance, but now there were these seekers seeking, seeking among</p>
<p>rare and curious and perplexing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_66">objects</a>, sometimes finding some</p>
<p>odd utilisable thing, sometimes <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_67">deceiving</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_64">themselves</a> with fancied</p>
<p>discovery, sometimes pretending to find. The world of every day</p>
<p>laughed at these eccentric beings, or found them annoying and</p>
<p>ill-treated them, or was seized with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_68">fear</a> and made saints and</p>
<p>sorcerers and warlocks of them, or with covetousness and</p>
<p>entertained them hopefully; but for the greater part heeded them</p>
<p>not at all. Yet they were of the blood of him who had first</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_69">dreamt</a> of attacking the mammoth; every one of them was of his</p>
<p>blood and descent; and the thing they sought, all unwittingly,</p>
<p>was the snare that will some day catch the sun.</p>
<p>Section 3</p>
<p>Such a man was that Leonardo da Vinci, who went about the court</p>
<p>of Sforza in Milan in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_70">state</a> of dignified abstraction. His</p>
<p>common-place books are full of prophetic subtlety and ingenious</p>
<p>anticipations of the methods of the early aviators. Durer was his</p>
<p>parallel and Roger Bacon-whom the Franciscans silenced-of his</p>
<p>kindred. Such a man again in an earlier city was Hero of</p>
<p>Alexandria, who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_71">knew</a> of the power of steam nineteen hundred years</p>
<p>before it was first brought into use. And earlier still was</p>
<p>Archimedes of Syracuse, and still earlier the legendary Daedalus</p>
<p>of Cnossos. All up and down the record of history whenever there</p>
<p>was a little leisure from war and brutality the seekers appeared.</p>
<p>And half the alchemists were of their tribe.</p>
<p>When Roger Bacon blew up his first batch of gunpowder one might</p>
<p>have supposed that men would have gone at once to the explosive</p>
<p>engine. But they could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_72">see</a> nothing of the sort. They were not</p>
<p>yet beginning to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_73">think</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_74">seeing</a> things; their metallurgy was all</p>
<p>too poor to make such engines even had they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_75">thought</a> of them. For</p>
<p>a time they could not make instruments sound enough to stand this</p>
<p>new force even for so rough a purpose as hurling a missile. Their</p>
<p>first guns had barrels of coopered timber, and the world waited</p>
<p>for more than five hundred years before the explosive engine</p>
<p>came.</p>
<p>Even when the seekers found, it was at first a long journey</p>
<p>before the world could use their findings for any but the</p>
<p>roughest, most obvious purposes. If man in general was not still</p>
<p>as absolutely blind to the unconquered energies about him as his</p>
<p>paleolithic precursor, he was at best purblind.</p>
<p>Section 4</p>
<p>The latent energy of coal and the power of steam waited long on</p>
<p>the verge of discovery, before they began to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_76">influence</a> human</p>
<p>lives.</p>
<p>There were no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_77">doubt</a> many such devices as Hero's toys devised and</p>
<p>forgotten, time after time, in courts and palaces, but it needed</p>
<p>that coal should be mined and burning with plenty of iron at hand</p>
<p>before it dawned upon men that here was something more than a</p>
<p>curiosity. And it is to be remarked that the first recorded</p>
<p>suggestion for the use of steam was in war; there is an</p>
<p>Elizabethan pamphlet in which it is proposed to fire shot out of</p>
<p>corked iron bottles full of heated water. The mining of coal for</p>
<p>fuel, the smelting of iron upon a larger scale than men had ever</p>
<p>done before, the steam pumping engine, the steam-engine and the</p>
<p>steam-boat, followed one another in an order that had a kind of</p>
<p>logical necessity. It is the most interesting and instructive</p>
<p>chapter in the history of the human intelligence, the history of</p>
<p>steam from its beginning as a fact in human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_78">consciousness</a> to the</p>
<p>perfection of the great turbine engines that preceded the</p>
<p>utilisation of intra-molecular power. Nearly every human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_79">being</a></p>
<p>must have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_80">seen</a> steam, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_80">seen</a> it incuriously for many thousands of</p>
<p>years; the women in particular were always heating water, boiling</p>
<p>it, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_81">seeing</a> it boil away, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_81">seeing</a> the lids of vessels dance with</p>
<p>its fury; millions of people at different times must have watched</p>
<p>steam pitching rocks out of volcanoes like cricket balls and</p>
<p>blowing pumice into foam, and yet you may search the whole human</p>
<p>record through, letters, books, inscriptions, pictures, for any</p>
<p>glimmer of a realisation that here was force, here was strength</p>
<p>to borrow and use… Then suddenly man <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_82">woke</a> up to it, the</p>
<p>railways spread like a network over the globe, the ever enlarging</p>
<p>iron steamships began their staggering fight against wind and</p>
<p>wave.</p>
<p>Steam was the first-comer in the new powers, it was the beginning</p>
<p>of the Age of Energy that was to close the long history of the</p>
<p>Warring States.</p>
<p>But for a long time men did not realise the importance of this</p>
<p>novelty. They would not recognise, they were not able to</p>
<p>recognise that anything fundamental had happened to their</p>
<p>immemorial necessities. They called the steam-engine the 'iron</p>
<p>horse' and pretended that they had made the most partial of</p>
<p>substitutions. Steam machinery and factory production were</p>
<p>visibly revolutionising the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_83">conditions</a> of industrial production,</p>
<p>population was streaming steadily in from the country-side and</p>
<p>concentrating in hitherto unthought-of masses about a few city</p>
<p>centres, food was coming to them over enormous distances upon a</p>
<p>scale that made the one sole precedent, the corn ships of</p>
<p>imperial Rome, a petty incident; and a huge migration of peoples</p>
<p>between Europe and Western Asia and America was in Progress,</p>
<p>and-nobody seems to have realised that something new had come</p>
<p>into human life, a strange swirl different altogether from any</p>
<p>previous circling and mutation, a swirl like the swirl when at</p>
<p>last the lock gates begin to open after a long phase of</p>
<p>accumulating water and eddying inactivity…</p>
<p>The sober Englishman at the close of the nineteenth century could</p>
<p>sit at his breakfast-table, decide between tea from Ceylon or</p>
<p>coffee from Brazil, devour an egg from France with some Danish</p>
<p>ham, or eat a New Zealand chop, wind up his breakfast with a West</p>
<p>Indian banana, glance at the latest telegrams from all the world,</p>
<p>scrutinise the prices current of his geographically distributed</p>
<p>investments in South Africa, Japan, and Egypt, and tell the two</p>
<p>children he had begotten (in the place of his father's eight)</p>
<p>that he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_84">thought</a> the world changed very little. They must play</p>
<p>cricket, keep their hair cut, go to the old school he had gone</p>
<p>to, shirk the lessons he had shirked, learn a few scraps of</p>
<p>Horace and Virgil and Homer for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_85">confusion</a> of cads, and all</p>
<p>would be well with them…</p>
<p>Section 5</p>
<p>Electricity, though it was perhaps the earlier of the two to be</p>
<p>studied, invaded the common life of men a few decades after the</p>
<p>exploitation of steam. To electricity also, in spite of its</p>
<p>provocative nearness all about him, mankind had been utterly</p>
<p>blind for incalculable ages. Could anything be more emphatic than</p>
<p>the appeal of electricity for attention? It thundered at man's</p>
<p>ears, it signalled to him in blinding flashes, occasionally it</p>
<p>killed him, and he could not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_86">see</a> it as a thing that concerned him</p>
<p>enough to merit study. It came into the house with the cat on any</p>
<p>dry day and crackled insinuatingly whenever he stroked her fur.</p>
<p>It rotted his metals when he put them together… There is no</p>
<p>single record that any one questioned why the cat's fur crackles</p>
<p>or why hair is so unruly to brush on a frosty day, before the</p>
<p>sixteenth century. For endless years man seems to have done his</p>
<p>very successful best not to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_87">think</a> about it at all; until this new</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_88">spirit</a> of the Seeker turned itself to these things.</p>
<p>How often things must have been <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_89">seen</a> and dismissed as</p>
<p>unimportant, before the speculative eye and the moment of vision</p>
<p>came! It was Gilbert, Queen Elizabeth's court physician, who</p>
<p>first puzzled his brains with rubbed amber and bits of glass and</p>
<p>silk and shellac, and so began the quickening of the human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_90">mind</a></p>
<p>to the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_91">existence</a> of this universal presence. And even then the</p>
<p>science of electricity remained a mere little group of curious</p>
<p>facts for nearly two hundred years, connected perhaps with</p>
<p>magnetism-a mere guess that-perhaps with the lightning. Frogs'</p>
<p>legs must have hung by copper hooks from iron railings and</p>
<p>twitched upon countless occasions before Galvani <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_92">saw</a> them.</p>
<p>Except for the lightning conductor, it was 250 years after</p>
<p>Gilbert before electricity stepped out of the cabinet of</p>
<p>scientific curiosities into the life of the common man… Then</p>
<p>suddenly, in the half-century between 1880 and 1930, it ousted</p>
<p>the steam-engine and took over traction, it ousted every other</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_93">form</a> of household heating, abolished distance with the perfected</p>
<p>wireless telephone and the telephotograph…</p>
<p>Section 6</p>
<p>And there was an extraordinary mental resistance to discovery and</p>
<p>invention for at least a hundred years after the scientific</p>
<p>revolution had begun. Each new thing made its way into practice</p>
<p>against a scepticism that amounted at times to hostility. One</p>
<p>writer upon these subjects gives a funny little domestic</p>
<p>conversation that happened, he says, in the year 1898, within ten</p>
<p>years, that is to say, of the time when the first aviators were</p>
<p>fairly on the wing. He tells us how he sat at his desk in his</p>
<p>study and conversed with his little boy.</p>
<p>His little boy was in profound trouble. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_94">felt</a> he had to speak</p>
<p>very seriously to his father, and as he was a kindly little boy</p>
<p>he did not want to do it too harshly.</p>
<p>This is what happened.</p>
<p>'I wish, Daddy,' he said, coming to his point, 'that you wouldn't</p>
<p>write all this stuff about flying. The chaps rot me.'</p>
<p>'Yes!' said his father.</p>
<p>'And old Broomie, the Head I mean, he rots me. Everybody rots</p>
<p>me.'</p>
<p>'But there is going to be flying-quite soon.'</p>
<p>The little boy was too well bred to say what he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_95">thought</a> of that.</p>
<p>'Anyhow,' he said, 'I wish you wouldn't write about it.'</p>
<p>'You'll fly-lots of times-before you die,' the father assured</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>The little boy looked <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_96">unhappy</a>.</p>
<p>The father hesitated. Then he opened a drawer and took out a</p>
<p>blurred and under-developed photograph. 'Come and look at this,'</p>
<p>he said.</p>
<p>The little boy came round to him. The photograph showed a stream</p>
<p>and a meadow beyond, and some trees, and in the air a black,</p>
<p>pencil-like <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_97">object</a> with flat wings on either side of it. It was</p>
<p>the first record of the first apparatus heavier than air that</p>
<p>ever maintained itself in the air by mechanical force. Across the</p>
<p>margin was written: 'Here we go up, up, up-from S. P. Langley,</p>
<p>Smithsonian Institution, Washington.'</p>
<p>The father watched the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_98">effect</a> of this reassuring document upon</p>
<p>his son. 'Well?' he said.</p>
<p>'That,' said the schoolboy, after reflection, 'is only a model.'</p>
<p>'Model to-day, man to-morrow.'</p>
<p>The boy seemed divided in his allegiance. Then he decided for</p>
<p>what he believed quite firmly to be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_99">omniscience</a>. 'But old</p>
<p>Broomie,' he said, 'he told all the boys in his class only</p>
<p>yesterday, "no man will ever fly." No one, he says, who has ever</p>
<p>shot grouse or pheasants on the wing would ever believe anything</p>
<p>of the sort…'</p>
<p>Yet that boy lived to fly across the Atlantic and edit his</p>
<p>father's reminiscences.</p>
<p>Section 7</p>
<p>At the close of the nineteenth century as a multitude of passages</p>
<p>in the literature of that time witness, it was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_100">thought</a> that the</p>
<p>fact that man had at last had successful and profitable dealings</p>
<p>with the steam that scalded him and the electricity that flashed</p>
<p>and banged about the sky at him, was an amazing and perhaps a</p>
<p>culminating exercise of his intelligence and his intellectual</p>
<p>courage. The air of 'Nunc Dimittis' sounds in same of these</p>
<p>writings. 'The great things are discovered,' wrote Gerald Brown</p>
<p>in his summary of the nineteenth century. 'For us there remains</p>
<p>little but the working out of detail.' The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_101">spirit</a> of the seeker</p>
<p>was still rare in the world; education was unskilled,</p>
<p>unstimulating, scholarly, and but little valued, and few people</p>
<p>even then could have realised that Science was still but the</p>
<p>flimsiest of trial sketches and discovery scarcely beginning. No</p>
<p>one seems to have been afraid of science and its possibilities.</p>
<p>Yet now where there had been but a score or so of seekers, there</p>
<p>were many thousands, and for one needle of speculation that had</p>
<p>been probing the curtain of appearances in 1800, there were now</p>
<p>hundreds. And already Chemistry, which had been content with her</p>
<p>atoms and molecules for the better part of a century, was</p>
<p>preparing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_102">herself</a> for that vast next stride that was to</p>
<p>revolutionise the whole life of man from top to bottom.</p>
<p>One realises how crude was the science of that time when one</p>
<p>considers the case of the composition of air. This was</p>
<p>determined by that strange genius and recluse, that man of</p>
<p>mystery, that disembowelled intelligence, Henry Cavendish,</p>
<p>towards the end of the eighteenth century. So far as he was</p>
<p>concerned the work was admirably done. He separated all the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_103">known</a></p>
<p>ingredients of the air with a precision altogether remarkable; he</p>
<p>even put it upon record that he had some <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_104">doubt</a> about the purity</p>
<p>of the nitrogen. For more than a hundred years his determination</p>
<p>was repeated by chemists all the world over, his apparatus was</p>
<p>treasured in London, he became, as they used to say, 'classic,'</p>
<p>and always, at every one of the innumerable repetitions of his</p>
<p>experiment, that sly element argon was hiding among the nitrogen</p>
<p>(and with a little helium and traces of other substances, and</p>
<p>indeed all the hints that might have led to the new departures of</p>
<p>the twentieth-century chemistry), and every time it slipped</p>
<p>unobserved through the professorial fingers that repeated his</p>
<p>procedure.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder then with this margin of inaccuracy, that up to</p>
<p>the very dawn of the twentieth-century scientific discovery was</p>
<p>still rather a procession of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_105">happy</a> accidents than an orderly</p>
<p>conquest of nature?</p>
<p>Yet the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_106">spirit</a> of seeking was spreading steadily through the</p>
<p>world. Even the schoolmaster could not check it. For the mere</p>
<p>handful who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_107">grew</a> up to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_108">feel</a> wonder and curiosity about the</p>
<p>secrets of nature in the nineteenth century, there were now, at</p>
<p>the beginning of the twentieth, myriads escaping from the</p>
<p>limitations of intellectual routine and the habitual life, in</p>
<p>Europe, in America, North and South, in Japan, in China, and all</p>
<p>about the world.</p>
<p>It was in 1910 that the parents of young Holsten, who was to be</p>
<p>called by a whole generation of scientific men, 'the greatest of</p>
<p>European chemists,' were staying in a villa near Santo Domenico,</p>
<p>between Fiesole and Florence. He was then only fifteen, but he</p>
<p>was already distinguished as a mathematician and possessed by a</p>
<p>savage appetite to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_109">understand</a>. He had been particularly attracted</p>
<p>by the mystery of phosphorescence and its apparent unrelatedness</p>
<p>to every other source of light. He was to tell afterwards in his</p>
<p>reminiscences how he watched the fireflies drifting and glowing</p>
<p>among the dark trees in the garden of the villa under the warm</p>
<p>blue night sky of Italy; how he caught and kept them in cages,</p>
<p>dissected them, first studying the general anatomy of insects</p>
<p>very elaborately, and how he began to experiment with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_110">effect</a></p>
<p>of various gases and varying temperature upon their light. Then</p>
<p>the chance present of a little scientific toy invented by Sir</p>
<p>William Crookes, a toy called the spinthariscope, on which radium</p>
<p>particles impinge upon sulphide of zinc and make it luminous,</p>
<p>induced him to associate the two sets of phenomena. It was a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_111">happy</a> association for his inquiries. It was a rare and fortunate</p>
<p>thing, too, that any one with the mathematical gift should have</p>
<p>been taken by these curiosities.</p>
<p>Section 8</p>
<p>And while the boy Holsten was mooning over his fireflies at</p>
<p>Fiesole, a certain professor of physics named Rufus was giving a</p>
<p>course of afternoon lectures upon Radium and Radio-Activity in</p>
<p>Edinburgh. They were lectures that had attracted a very</p>
<p>considerable amount of attention. He gave them in a small</p>
<p>lecture-theatre that had become more and more congested as his</p>
<p>course proceeded. At his concluding discussion it was crowded</p>
<p>right up to the ceiling at the back, and there people were</p>
<p>standing, standing without any sense of fatigue, so fascinating</p>
<p>did they find his suggestions. One youngster in particular, a</p>
<p>chuckle-headed, scrub-haired lad from the Highlands, sat hugging</p>
<p>his knee with great sand-red hands and drinking in every word,</p>
<p>eyes aglow, cheeks flushed, and ears burning.</p>
<p>'And so,' said the professor, 'we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_112">see</a> that this Radium, which</p>
<p>seemed at first a fantastic exception, a mad inversion of all</p>
<p>that was most established and fundamental in the constitution of</p>
<p>matter, is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_113">really</a> at one with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_114">rest</a> of the elements. It does</p>
<p>noticeably and forcibly what probably all the other elements are</p>
<p>doing with an imperceptible slowness. It is like the single</p>
<p>voice crying aloud that betrays the silent breathing multitude in</p>
<p>the darkness. Radium is an element that is breaking up and flying</p>
<p>to pieces. But perhaps all elements are doing that at less</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_115">perceptible</a> rates. Uranium certainly is; thorium-the stuff of</p>
<p>this incandescent gas mantle-certainly is; actinium. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_116">feel</a></p>
<p>that we are but beginning the list. And we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_117">know</a> now that the</p>
<p>atom, that once we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_118">thought</a> hard and impenetrable, and indivisible</p>
<p>and final and-lifeless-lifeless, is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_113">really</a> a reservoir of</p>
<p>immense energy. That is the most wonderful thing about all this</p>
<p>work. A little while ago we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_118">thought</a> of the atoms as we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_118">thought</a></p>
<p>of bricks, as solid building material, as substantial matter, as</p>
<p>unit masses of lifeless stuff, and behold! these bricks are</p>
<p>boxes, treasure boxes, boxes full of the intensest force. This</p>
<p>little bottle contains about a pint of uranium oxide; that is to</p>
<p>say, about fourteen ounces of the element uranium. It is worth</p>
<p>about a pound. And in this bottle, ladies and gentlemen, in the</p>
<p>atoms in this bottle there slumbers at least as much energy as we</p>
<p>could get by burning a hundred and sixty tons of coal. If at a</p>
<p>word, in one instant I could suddenly release that energy here</p>
<p>and now it would blow us and everything about us to fragments; if</p>
<p>I could turn it into the machinery that lights this city, it</p>
<p>could keep Edinburgh brightly lit for a week. But at present no</p>
<p>man <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_119">knows</a>, no man has an inkling of how this little lump of stuff</p>
<p>can be made to hasten the release of its store. It does release</p>
<p>it, as a burn trickles. Slowly the uranium changes into radium,</p>
<p>the radium changes into a gas called the radium emanation, and</p>
<p>that again to what we call radium A, and so the process goes on,</p>
<p>giving out energy at every stage, until at last we reach the last</p>
<p>stage of all, which is, so far as we can tell at present, lead.</p>
<p>But we cannot hasten it.'</p>
<p>'I take ye, man,' whispered the chuckle-headed lad, with his red</p>
<p>hands tightening like a vice upon his knee. 'I take ye, man. Go</p>
<p>on! Oh, go on!'</p>
<p>The professor went on after a little pause. 'Why is the change</p>
<p>gradual?' he asked. 'Why does only a minute fraction of the</p>
<p>radium disintegrate in any particular second? Why does it dole</p>
<p>itself out so slowly and so exactly? Why does not all the</p>
<p>uranium change to radium and all the radium change to the next</p>
<p>lowest thing at once? Why this decay by driblets; why not a decay</p>
<p>en masse?… Suppose presently we find it is possible to</p>
<p>quicken that decay?'</p>
<p>The chuckle-headed lad nodded rapidly. The wonderful inevitable</p>
<p>idea was coming. He drew his knee up towards his chin and swayed</p>
<p>in his seat with excitement. 'Why not?' he echoed, 'why not?'</p>
<p>The professor lifted his forefinger.</p>
<p>'Given that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_120">knowledge</a>,' he said, 'mark what we should be able to</p>
<p>do! We should not only be able to use this uranium and thorium;</p>
<p>not only should we have a source of power so potent that a man</p>
<p>might carry in his hand the energy to light a city for a year,</p>
<p>fight a fleet of battleships, or drive one of our giant liners</p>
<p>across the Atlantic; but we should also have a clue that would</p>
<p>enable us at last to quicken the process of disintegration in all</p>
<p>the other elements, where decay is still so slow as to escape our</p>
<p>finest measurements. Every scrap of solid matter in the world</p>
<p>would become an available reservoir of concentrated force. Do</p>
<p>you realise, ladies and gentlemen, what these things would mean</p>
<p>for us?'</p>
<p>The scrub head nodded. 'Oh! go on. Go on.'</p>
<p>'It would mean a change in human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_121">conditions</a> that I can only</p>
<p>compare to the discovery of fire, that first discovery that</p>
<p>lifted man above the brute. We stand to-day towards</p>
<p>radio-activity as our ancestor stood towards fire before he had</p>
<p>learnt to make it. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_122">knew</a> it then only as a strange thing</p>
<p>utterly beyond his control, a flare on the crest of the volcano,</p>
<p>a red destruction that poured through the forest. So it is that</p>
<p>we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_123">know</a> radio-activity to-day. This-this is the dawn of a new</p>
<p>day in human living. At the climax of that civilisation which</p>
<p>had its beginning in the hammered flint and the fire-stick of the</p>
<p>savage, just when it is becoming apparent that our</p>
<p>ever-increasing needs cannot be borne indefinitely by our present</p>
<p>sources of energy, we discover suddenly the possibility of an</p>
<p>entirely new civilisation. The energy we need for our very</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_124">existence</a>, and with which Nature supplies us still so grudgingly,</p>
<p>is in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_125">reality</a> locked up in inconceivable quantities all about us.</p>
<p>We cannot pick that lock at present, but--'</p>
<p>He paused. His voice sank so that everybody strained a little to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_126">hear</a> him.</p>
<p>'--we will.'</p>
<p>He put up that lean finger again, his solitary gesture.</p>
<p>'And then,' he said…</p>
<p>'Then that perpetual struggle for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_127">existence</a>, that perpetual</p>
<p>struggle to live on the bare surplus of Nature's energies will</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_128">cease</a> to be the lot of Man. Man will step from the pinnacle of</p>
<p>this civilisation to the beginning of the next. I have no</p>
<p>eloquence, ladies and gentlemen, to express the vision of man's</p>
<p>material destiny that opens out before me. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_129">see</a> the desert</p>
<p>continents <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_130">transformed</a>, the poles no longer wildernesses of ice,</p>
<p>the whole world once more Eden. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_129">see</a> the power of man reach out</p>
<p>among the stars…'</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly with a catching of the breath that many an</p>
<p>actor or orator might have envied.</p>
<p>The lecture was over, the audience hung silent for a few seconds,</p>
<p>sighed, became audible, stirred, fluttered, prepared for</p>
<p>dispersal. More light was turned on and what had been a dim mass</p>
<p>of figures became a bright <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_131">confusion</a> of movement. Some of the</p>
<p>people signalled to friends, some crowded down towards the</p>
<p>platform to examine the lecturer's apparatus and make notes of</p>
<p>his diagrams. But the chuckle-headed lad with the scrub hair</p>
<p>wanted no such detailed frittering away of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_132">thoughts</a> that had</p>
<p>inspired him. He wanted to be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_133">alone</a> with them; he elbowed his way</p>
<p>out almost fiercely, he made <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_134">himself</a> as angular and bony as a</p>
<p>cow, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_135">fearing</a> lest some one should speak to him, lest some one</p>
<p>should invade his glowing sphere of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>He went through the streets with a rapt face, like a saint who</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_136">sees</a> visions. He had arms disproportionately long, and</p>
<p>ridiculous big feet.</p>
<p>He must get <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_137">alone</a>, get somewhere high out of all this crowding of</p>
<p>commonness, of everyday life.</p>
<p>He made his way to the top of Arthur's Seat, and there he sat for</p>
<p>a long time in the golden evening sunshine, still, except that</p>
<p>ever and again he whispered to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_138">himself</a> some precious phrase that</p>
<p>had stuck in his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_139">mind</a>.</p>
<p>'If,' he whispered, 'if only we could pick that lock…'</p>
<p>The sun was sinking over the distant hills. Already it was shorn</p>
<p>of its beams, a globe of ruddy gold, hanging over the great banks</p>
<p>of cloud that would presently engulf it.</p>
<p>'Eh!' said the youngster. 'Eh!'</p>
<p>He seemed to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_140">wake</a> up at last out of his entrancement, and the red</p>
<p>sun was there before his eyes. He stared at it, at first without</p>
<p>intelligence, and then with a gathering recognition. Into his</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_141">mind</a> came a strange echo of that ancestral fancy, that fancy of a</p>
<p>Stone Age savage, dead and scattered bones among the drift two</p>
<p>hundred thousand years ago.</p>
<p>'Ye auld thing,' he said-and his eyes were shining, and he made</p>
<p>a kind of grabbing gesture with his hand; 'ye auld red thing…</p>
<p>We'll have ye YET.'</p>

<p>CHAPTER THE FIRST</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THE NEW SOURCE OF ENERGY</p>
</title>
<p>Section I</p>
<p>The problem which was already <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_142">being</a> mooted by such scientific men</p>
<p>as Ramsay, Rutherford, and Soddy, in the very beginning of the</p>
<p>twentieth century, the problem of inducing radio-activity in the</p>
<p>heavier elements and so tapping the internal energy of atoms, was</p>
<p>solved by a wonderful combination of induction, intuition, and</p>
<p>luck by Holsten so soon as the year 1933. From the first</p>
<p>detection of radio-activity to its first subjugation to human</p>
<p>purpose measured little more than a quarter of a century. For</p>
<p>twenty years after that, indeed, minor difficulties prevented any</p>
<p>striking practical application of his success, but the essential</p>
<p>thing was done, this new boundary in the march of human progress</p>
<p>was crossed, in that year. He set up atomic disintegration in a</p>
<p>minute particle of bismuth; it exploded with great violence into</p>
<p>a heavy gas of extreme radio-activity, which disintegrated in its</p>
<p>turn in the course of seven days, and it was only after another</p>
<p>year's work that he was able to show practically that the last</p>
<p>result of this rapid release of energy was gold. But the thing</p>
<p>was done-at the cost of a blistered chest and an injured finger,</p>
<p>and from the moment when the invisible speck of bismuth flashed</p>
<p>into riving and rending energy, Holsten <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_143">knew</a> that he had opened a</p>
<p>way for mankind, however narrow and dark it might still be, to</p>
<p>worlds of limitless power. He recorded as much in the strange</p>
<p>diary biography he left the world, a diary that was up to that</p>
<p>particular moment a mass of speculations and calculations, and</p>
<p>which suddenly became for a space an amazingly minute and human</p>
<p>record of sensations and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_144">emotions</a> that all humanity might</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_145">understand</a>.</p>
<p>He gives, in broken phrases and often single words, it is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_146">true</a>,</p>
<p>but none the less vividly for that, a record of the twenty-four</p>
<p>hours following the demonstration of the correctness of his</p>
<p>intricate tracery of computations and guesses. 'I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_147">thought</a> I</p>
<p>should not sleep,' he writes-the words he omitted are supplied</p>
<p>in brackets-(on account of) 'pain in (the) hand and chest and</p>
<p>(the) wonder of what I had done… Slept like a child.'</p>
<p>He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_148">felt</a> strange and disconcerted the next morning; he had nothing</p>
<p>to do, he was living <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_149">alone</a> in apartments in Bloomsbury, and he</p>
<p>decided to go up to Hampstead Heath, which he had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_150">known</a> when he</p>
<p>was a little boy as a breezy playground. He went up by the</p>
<p>underground tube that was then the recognised means of travel</p>
<p>from one part of London to another, and walked up Heath Street</p>
<p>from the tube station to the open heath. He found it a gully of</p>
<p>planks and scaffoldings between the hoardings of house-wreckers.</p>
<p>The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_151">spirit</a> of the times had seized upon that narrow, steep, and</p>
<p>winding thoroughfare, and was in the act of making it commodious</p>
<p>and interesting, according to the remarkable ideals of</p>
<p>Neo-Georgian aestheticism. Such is the illogical quality of</p>
<p>humanity that Holsten, fresh from work that was like a petard</p>
<p>under the seat of current civilisation, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_152">saw</a> these changes with</p>
<p>regret. He had come up Heath Street perhaps a thousand times, had</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_150">known</a> the windows of all the little shops, spent hours in the</p>
<p>vanished cinematograph theatre, and marvelled at the high-flung</p>
<p>early Georgian houses upon the westward bank of that old gully of</p>
<p>a thoroughfare; he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_148">felt</a> strange with all these familiar things</p>
<p>gone. He escaped at last with a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_153">feeling</a> of relief from this</p>
<p>choked alley of trenches and holes and cranes, and emerged upon</p>
<p>the old familiar scene about the White Stone Pond. That, at</p>
<p>least, was very much as it used to be.</p>
<p>There were still the fine old red-brick houses to left and right</p>
<p>of him; the reservoir had been improved by a portico of marble,</p>
<p>the white-fronted inn with the clustering flowers above its</p>
<p>portico still stood out at the angle of the ways, and the blue</p>
<p>view to Harrow Hill and Harrow spire, a view of hills and trees</p>
<p>and shining waters and wind-driven cloud shadows, was like the</p>
<p>opening of a great window to the ascending Londoner. All that</p>
<p>was very reassuring. There was the same strolling crowd, the same</p>
<p>perpetual miracle of motors dodging through it harmlessly,</p>
<p>escaping headlong into the country from the Sabbatical stuffiness</p>
<p>behind and below them. There was a band still, a women's suffrage</p>
<p>meeting-for the suffrage women had won their way back to the</p>
<p>tolerance, a trifle derisive, of the populace again-socialist</p>
<p>orators, politicians, a band, and the same wild uproar of dogs,</p>
<p>frantic with the gladness of their one blessed weekly release</p>
<p>from the back yard and the chain. And away along the road to the</p>
<p>Spaniards strolled a vast multitude, saying, as ever, that the</p>
<p>view of London was exceptionally clear that day.</p>
<p>Young Holsten's face was white. He walked with that uneasy</p>
<p>affectation of ease that marks an overstrained nervous system and</p>
<p>an under-exercised body. He hesitated at the White Stone Pond</p>
<p>whether to go to the left of it or the right, and again at the</p>
<p>fork of the roads. He kept shifting his stick in his hand, and</p>
<p>every now and then he would get in the way of people on the</p>
<p>footpath or be jostled by them because of the uncertainty of his</p>
<p>movements. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_154">felt</a>, he confesses, 'inadequate to ordinary</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_155">existence</a>.' He seemed to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_156">himself</a> to be something inhuman and</p>
<p>mischievous. All the people about him looked fairly prosperous,</p>
<p>fairly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_157">happy</a>, fairly well adapted to the lives they had to</p>
<p>lead-a week of work and a Sunday of best clothes and mild</p>
<p>promenading-and he had launched something that would disorganise</p>
<p>the entire fabric that held their contentments and ambitions and</p>
<p>satisfactions together. 'Felt like an imbecile who has presented</p>
<p>a box full of loaded revolvers to a Creche,' he notes.</p>
<p>He met a man named Lawson, an old school-fellow, of whom history</p>
<p>now <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_158">knows</a> only that he was red-faced and had a terrier. He and</p>
<p>Holsten walked together and Holsten was sufficiently pale and</p>
<p>jumpy for Lawson to tell him he overworked and needed a holiday.</p>
<p>They sat down at a little table outside the County Council house</p>
<p>of Golders Hill Park and sent one of the waiters to the Bull and</p>
<p>Bush for a couple of bottles of beer, no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_159">doubt</a> at Lawson's</p>
<p>suggestion. The beer warmed Holsten's rather dehumanised system.</p>
<p>He began to tell Lawson as clearly as he could to what his great</p>
<p>discovery amounted. Lawson feigned attention, but indeed he had</p>
<p>neither the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_158">knowledge</a> nor the imagination to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_160">understand</a>. 'In the</p>
<p>end, before many years are out, this must eventually change war,</p>
<p>transit, lighting, building, and every sort of manufacture, even</p>
<p>agriculture, every material human concern--'</p>
<p>Then Holsten stopped short. Lawson had leapt to his feet. 'Damn</p>
<p>that dog!' cried Lawson. 'Look at it now. Hi! Here!</p>
<p>Phewoo-phewoo phewoo! Come HERE, Bobs! Come HERE!'</p>
<p>The young scientific man, with his bandaged hand, sat at the</p>
<p>green table, too tired to convey the wonder of the thing he had</p>
<p>sought so long, his friend whistled and bawled for his dog, and</p>
<p>the Sunday people drifted about them through the spring sunshine.</p>
<p>For a moment or so Holsten stared at Lawson in astonishment, for</p>
<p>he had been too intent upon what he had been saying to realise</p>
<p>how little Lawson had attended.</p>
<p>Then he remarked, 'WELL!' and smiled faintly, and-finished the</p>
<p>tankard of beer before him.</p>
<p>Lawson sat down again. 'One must look after one's dog,' he said,</p>
<p>with a note of apology. 'What was it you were telling me?'</p>
<p>Section 2</p>
<p>In the evening Holsten went out again. He walked to Saint Paul's</p>
<p>Cathedral, and stood for a time near the door listening to the</p>
<p>evening service. The candles upon the altar reminded him in some</p>
<p>odd way of the fireflies at Fiesole. Then he walked back through</p>
<p>the evening lights to Westminster. He was oppressed, he was</p>
<p>indeed scared, by his sense of the immense consequences of his</p>
<p>discovery. He had a vague idea that night that he ought not to</p>
<p>publish his results, that they were premature, that some secret</p>
<p>association of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_161">wise</a> men should take care of his work and hand it</p>
<p>on from generation to generation until the world was riper for</p>
<p>its practical application. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_162">felt</a> that nobody in all the</p>
<p>thousands of people he passed had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_163">really</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_164">awakened</a> to the fact of</p>
<p>change, they trusted the world for what it was, not to alter too</p>
<p>rapidly, to respect their trusts, their assurances, their habits,</p>
<p>their little accustomed traffics and hard-won positions.</p>
<p>He went into those little gardens beneath the over-hanging,</p>
<p>brightly-lit masses of the Savoy Hotel and the Hotel Cecil. He</p>
<p>sat down on a seat and became aware of the talk of the two people</p>
<p>next to him. It was the talk of a young couple evidently on the</p>
<p>eve of marriage. The man was congratulating <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_165">himself</a> on having</p>
<p>regular employment at last; 'they like me,' he said, 'and I like</p>
<p>the job. If I work up-in'r dozen years or so I ought to be</p>
<p>gettin' somethin' pretty <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_166">comfortable</a>. That's the plain sense of</p>
<p>it, Hetty. There ain't no reason whatsoever why we shouldn't get</p>
<p>along very decently-very decently indeed.'</p>
<p>The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_167">desire</a> for little successes amidst <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_168">conditions</a> securely fixed!</p>
<p>So it struck upon Holsten's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_169">mind</a>. He added in his diary, 'I had</p>
<p>a sense of all this globe as that…'</p>
<p>By that phrase he meant a kind of clairvoyant vision of this</p>
<p>populated world as a whole, of all its cities and towns and</p>
<p>villages, its high roads and the inns beside them, its gardens</p>
<p>and farms and upland pastures, its boatmen and sailors, its ships</p>
<p>coming along the great circles of the ocean, its time-tables and</p>
<p>appointments and payments and dues as it were one unified and</p>
<p>progressive spectacle. Sometimes such visions came to him; his</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_170">mind</a>, accustomed to great generalisations and yet acutely</p>
<p>sensitive to detail, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_171">saw</a> things far more comprehensively than the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_170">minds</a> of most of his contemporaries. Usually the teeming sphere</p>
<p>moved on to its predestined ends and circled with a stately</p>
<p>swiftness on its path about the sun. Usually it was all a living</p>
<p>progress that altered under his regard. But now fatigue a little</p>
<p>deadened him to that incessancy of life, it seemed now just an</p>
<p>eternal circling. He lapsed to the commoner persuasion of the</p>
<p>great fixities and recurrencies of the human routine. The remoter</p>
<p>past of wandering savagery, the inevitable changes of to-morrow</p>
<p>were veiled, and he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_171">saw</a> only day and night, seed-time and</p>
<p>harvest, loving and begetting, births and deaths, walks in the</p>
<p>summer sunlight and tales by the winter fireside, the ancient</p>
<p>sequence of hope and acts and age perennially renewed, eddying on</p>
<p>for ever and ever, save that now the impious hand of research was</p>
<p>raised to overthrow this drowsy, gently humming, habitual, sunlit</p>
<p>spinning-top of man's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_172">existence</a>…</p>
<p>For a time he forgot wars and crimes and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_173">hates</a> and persecutions,</p>
<p>famine and pestilence, the cruelties of beasts, weariness and the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_174">bitter</a> wind, failure and insufficiency and retrocession. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_175">saw</a></p>
<p>all mankind in terms of the humble Sunday couple upon the seat</p>
<p>beside him, who schemed their inglorious outlook and improbable</p>
<p>contentments. 'I had a sense of all this globe as that.'</p>
<p>His intelligence struggled against this mood and struggled for a</p>
<p>time in vain. He reassured <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_176">himself</a> against the invasion of this</p>
<p>disconcerting idea that he was something strange and inhuman, a</p>
<p>loose wanderer from the flock returning with evil gifts from his</p>
<p>sustained unnatural excursions amidst the darknesses and</p>
<p>phosphorescences beneath the fair surfaces of life. Man had not</p>
<p>been always thus; the instincts and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_177">desires</a> of the little home,</p>
<p>the little plot, was not all his nature; also he was an</p>
<p>adventurer, an experimenter, an unresting curiosity, an</p>
<p>insatiable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_177">desire</a>. For a few thousand generations indeed he had</p>
<p>tilled the earth and followed the seasons, saying his prayers,</p>
<p>grinding his corn and trampling the October winepress, yet not</p>
<p>for so long but that he was still full of restless stirrings.</p>
<p>'If there have been home and routine and the field,' <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_178">thought</a></p>
<p>Holsten, 'there have also been wonder and the sea.'</p>
<p>He turned his head and looked up over the back of the seat at the</p>
<p>great hotels above him, full of softly shaded lights and the glow</p>
<p>and colour and stir of feasting. Might his gift to mankind mean</p>
<p>simply more of that?…</p>
<p>He got up and walked out of the garden, surveyed a passing</p>
<p>tram-car, laden with warm light, against the deep blues of</p>
<p>evening, dripping and trailing long skirts of shining reflection;</p>
<p>he crossed the Embankment and stood for a time watching the dark</p>
<p>river and turning ever and again to the lit buildings and</p>
<p>bridges. His <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_179">mind</a> began to scheme conceivable replacements of all</p>
<p>those clustering arrangements…</p>
<p>'It has begun,' he writes in the diary in which these things are</p>
<p>recorded. 'It is not for me to reach out to consequences I cannot</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_180">foresee</a>. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_181">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_182">am</a> a part, not a whole; <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_181">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_182">am</a> a little instrument in</p>
<p>the armoury of Change. If I were to burn all these papers,</p>
<p>before a score of years had passed, some other man would be doing</p>
<p>this…</p>
<p>Section 3</p>
<p>Holsten, before he died, was destined to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_183">see</a> atomic energy</p>
<p>dominating every other source of power, but for some years yet a</p>
<p>vast network of difficulties in detail and application kept the</p>
<p>new discovery from any <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_184">effective</a> invasion of ordinary life. The</p>
<p>path from the laboratory to the workshop is sometimes a tortuous</p>
<p>one; electro-magnetic radiations were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_185">known</a> and demonstrated for</p>
<p>twenty years before Marconi made them practically available, and</p>
<p>in the same way it was twenty years before induced radio-activity</p>
<p>could be brought to practical utilisation. The thing, of course,</p>
<p>was discussed very much, more perhaps at the time of its</p>
<p>discovery than during the interval of technical adaptation, but</p>
<p>with very little realisation of the huge economic revolution that</p>
<p>impended. What chiefly impressed the journalists of 1933 was the</p>
<p>production of gold from bismuth and the realisation albeit upon</p>
<p>unprofitable lines of the alchemist's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_186">dreams</a>; there was a</p>
<p>considerable amount of discussion and expectation in that more</p>
<p>intelligent section of the educated publics of the various</p>
<p>civilised countries which followed scientific development; but</p>
<p>for the most part the world went about its business-as the</p>
<p>inhabitants of those Swiss villages which live under the</p>
<p>perpetual threat of overhanging rocks and mountains go about</p>
<p>their business-just as though the possible was impossible, as</p>
<p>though the inevitable was postponed for ever because it was</p>
<p>delayed.</p>
<p>It was in 1953 that the first Holsten-Roberts engine brought</p>
<p>induced radio-activity into the sphere of industrial production,</p>
<p>and its first general use was to replace the steam-engine in</p>
<p>electrical generating stations. Hard upon the appearance of this</p>
<p>came the Dass-Tata engine-the invention of two among the</p>
<p>brilliant galaxy of Bengali inventors the modernisation of Indian</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_187">thought</a> was producing at this time-which was used chiefly for</p>
<p>automobiles, aeroplanes, waterplanes, and such-like, mobile</p>
<p>purposes. The American Kemp engine, differing widely in principle</p>
<p>but equally practicable, and the Krupp-Erlanger came hard upon</p>
<p>the heels of this, and by the autumn of 1954 a gigantic</p>
<p>replacement of industrial methods and machinery was in progress</p>
<p>all about the habitable globe. Small wonder was this when the</p>
<p>cost, even of these earliest and clumsiest of atomic engines, is</p>
<p>compared with that of the power they superseded. Allowing for</p>
<p>lubrication the Dass-Tata engine, once it was started cost a</p>
<p>penny to run thirty-seven miles, and added only nine and quarter</p>
<p>pounds to the weight of the carriage it drove. It made the heavy</p>
<p>alcohol-driven automobile of the time ridiculous in appearance as</p>
<p>well as preposterously costly. For many years the price of coal</p>
<p>and every <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_188">form</a> of liquid fuel had been clambering to levels that</p>
<p>made even the revival of the draft horse seem a practicable</p>
<p>possibility, and now with the abrupt relaxation of this</p>
<p>stringency, the change in appearance of the traffic upon the</p>
<p>world's roads was instantaneous. In three years the frightful</p>
<p>armoured monsters that had hooted and smoked and thundered about</p>
<p>the world for four awful decades were swept away to the dealers</p>
<p>in old metal, and the highways thronged with light and clean and</p>
<p>shimmering shapes of silvered steel. At the same time a new</p>
<p>impetus was given to aviation by the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_189">relatively</a> enormous power</p>
<p>for weight of the atomic engine, it was at last possible to add</p>
<p>Redmayne's ingenious helicopter ascent and descent engine to the</p>
<p>vertical propeller that had hitherto been the sole driving force</p>
<p>of the aeroplane without overweighting the machine, and men found</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_190">themselves</a> possessed of an instrument of flight that could hover</p>
<p>or ascend or descend vertically and gently as well as rush wildly</p>
<p>through the air. The last dread of flying vanished. As the</p>
<p>journalists of the time phrased it, this was the epoch of the</p>
<p>Leap into the Air. The new atomic aeroplane became indeed a</p>
<p>mania; every one of means was frantic to possess a thing so</p>
<p>controllable, so secure and so free from the dust and danger of</p>
<p>the road, and in France <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_191">alone</a> in the year 1943 thirty thousand of</p>
<p>these new aeroplanes were manufactured and licensed, and soared</p>
<p>humming softly into the sky.</p>
<p>And with an equal speed atomic engines of various types invaded</p>
<p>industrialism. The railways paid enormous premiums for priority</p>
<p>in the delivery of atomic traction engines, atomic smelting was</p>
<p>embarked upon so eagerly as to lead to a number of disastrous</p>
<p>explosions due to inexperienced handling of the new power, and</p>
<p>the revolutionary cheapening of both materials and electricity</p>
<p>made the entire reconstruction of domestic buildings a matter</p>
<p>merely dependent upon a reorganisation of the methods of the</p>
<p>builder and the house-furnisher. Viewed from the side of the new</p>
<p>power and from the point of view of those who financed and</p>
<p>manufactured the new engines and material it required the age of</p>
<p>the Leap into the Air was one of astonishing prosperity.</p>
<p>Patent-holding companies were presently paying dividends of five</p>
<p>or six hundred per cent. and enormous fortunes were made and</p>
<p>fantastic wages earned by all who were concerned in the new</p>
<p>developments. This prosperity was not a little enhanced by the</p>
<p>fact that in both the Dass-Tata and Holsten-Roberts engines one</p>
<p>of the recoverable waste products was gold-the former</p>
<p>disintegrated dust of bismuth and the latter dust of lead-and</p>
<p>that this new supply of gold led quite naturally to a rise in</p>
<p>prices throughout the world.</p>
<p>This spectacle of feverish enterprise was productivity, this</p>
<p>crowding flight of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_192">happy</a> and fortunate rich people-every great</p>
<p>city was as if a crawling ant-hill had suddenly taken wing-was</p>
<p>the bright side of the opening phase of the new epoch in human</p>
<p>history. Beneath that brightness was a gathering darkness, a</p>
<p>deepening dismay. If there was a vast development of production</p>
<p>there was also a huge destruction of values. These glaring</p>
<p>factories working night and day, these glittering new vehicles</p>
<p>swinging noiselessly along the roads, these flights of</p>
<p>dragon-flies that swooped and soared and circled in the air, were</p>
<p>indeed no more than the brightnesses of lamps and fires that</p>
<p>gleam out when the world sinks towards twilight and the night.</p>
<p>Between these high lights accumulated disaster, social</p>
<p>catastrophe. The coal mines were manifestly doomed to closure at</p>
<p>no very distant date, the vast amount of capital invested in oil</p>
<p>was becoming unsaleable, millions of coal miners, steel workers</p>
<p>upon the old lines, vast swarms of unskilled or under-skilled</p>
<p>labourers in innumerable occupations, were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_193">being</a> flung out of</p>
<p>employment by the superior efficiency of the new machinery, the</p>
<p>rapid fall in the cost of transit was destroying high land values</p>
<p>at every centre of population, the value of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_194">existing</a> house</p>
<p>property had become problematical, gold was undergoing headlong</p>
<p>depreciation, all the securities upon which the credit of the</p>
<p>world <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_195">rested</a> were slipping and sliding, banks were tottering, the</p>
<p>stock exchanges were scenes of feverish panic;-this was the</p>
<p>reverse of the spectacle, these were the black and monstrous</p>
<p>under-consequences of the Leap into the Air.</p>
<p>There is a story of a demented London stockbroker running out</p>
<p>into Threadneedle Street and tearing off his clothes as he ran.</p>
<p>'The Steel Trust is scrapping the whole of its plant,' he</p>
<p>shouted. 'The State Railways are going to scrap all their</p>
<p>engines. Everything's going to be scrapped-everything. Come and</p>
<p>scrap the mint, you fellows, come and scrap the mint!'</p>
<p>In the year 1955 the suicide rate for the United States of</p>
<p>America quadrupled any previous record. There was an enormous</p>
<p>increase also in violent crime throughout the world. The thing</p>
<p>had come upon an unprepared humanity; it seemed as though human</p>
<p>society was to be smashed by its own magnificent gains.</p>
<p>For there had been no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_196">foresight</a> of these things. There had been</p>
<p>no attempt anywhere even to compute the probable dislocations</p>
<p>this flood of inexpensive energy would produce in human affairs.</p>
<p>The world in these days was not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_197">really</a> governed at all, in the</p>
<p>sense in which government came to be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_198">understood</a> in subsequent</p>
<p>years. Government was a treaty, not a design; it was forensic,</p>
<p>conservative, disputatious, unseeing, unthinking, uncreative;</p>
<p>throughout the world, except where the vestiges of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_199">absolutism</a></p>
<p>still sheltered the court favourite and the trusted servant, it</p>
<p>was in the hands of the predominant caste of lawyers, who had an</p>
<p>enormous advantage in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_200">being</a> the only trained caste. Their</p>
<p>professional education and every circumstance in the manipulation</p>
<p>of the fantastically naive electoral methods by which they</p>
<p>clambered to power, conspired to keep them contemptuous of facts,</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_201">conscientiously</a> unimaginative, alert to claim and seize</p>
<p>advantages and suspicious of every <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_202">generosity</a>. Government was an</p>
<p>obstructive business of energetic fractions, progress went on</p>
<p>outside of and in spite of public activities, and legislation was</p>
<p>the last crippling recognition of needs so clamorous and</p>
<p>imperative and facts so aggressively established as to invade</p>
<p>even the dingy seclusions of the judges and threaten the very</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_203">existence</a> of the otherwise inattentive political machine.</p>
<p>The world was so little governed that with the very coming of</p>
<p>plenty, in the full tide of an incalculable abundance, when</p>
<p>everything necessary to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_204">satisfy</a> human needs and everything</p>
<p>necessary to realise such will and purpose as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_205">existed</a> then in</p>
<p>human hearts was already at hand, one has still to tell of</p>
<p>hardship, famine, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_206">anger</a>, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_207">confusion</a>, conflict, and incoherent</p>
<p>suffering. There was no scheme for the distribution of this vast</p>
<p>new wealth that had come at last within the reach of men; there</p>
<p>was no clear conception that any such distribution was possible.</p>
<p>As one attempts a comprehensive view of those opening years of</p>
<p>the new age, as one measures it against the latent achievement</p>
<p>that later years have demonstrated, one begins to measure the</p>
<p>blindness, the narrowness, the insensate unimaginative</p>
<p>individualism of the pre-atomic time. Under this tremendous dawn</p>
<p>of power and freedom, under a sky ablaze with promise, in the</p>
<p>very presence of science standing like some bountiful goddess</p>
<p>over all the squat darknesses of human life, holding <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_208">patiently</a> in</p>
<p>her strong arms, until men chose to take them, security, plenty,</p>
<p>the solution of riddles, the key of the bravest adventures, in</p>
<p>her very presence, and with the earnest of her gifts in court,</p>
<p>the world was to witness such things as the squalid spectacle of</p>
<p>the Dass-Tata patent litigation.</p>
<p>There in a stuffy court in London, a grimy oblong box of a room,</p>
<p>during the exceptional heat of the May of 1956, the leading</p>
<p>counsel of the day argued and shouted over a miserable little</p>
<p>matter of more royalties or less and whether the Dass-Tata</p>
<p>company might not bar the Holsten-Roberts' methods of utilising</p>
<p>the new power. The Dass-Tata people were indeed making a</p>
<p>strenuous attempt to secure a world monopoly in atomic</p>
<p>engineering. The judge, after the manner of those times, sat</p>
<p>raised above the court, wearing a preposterous gown and a foolish</p>
<p>huge wig, the counsel also wore dirty-looking little wigs and</p>
<p>queer black gowns over their usual costume, wigs and gowns that</p>
<p>were held to be necessary to their pleading, and upon unclean</p>
<p>wooden benches stirred and whispered artful-looking solicitors,</p>
<p>busily scribbling reporters, the parties to the case, expert</p>
<p>witnesses, interested people, and a jostling <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_209">confusion</a> of</p>
<p>subpoenaed persons, briefless young barristers (<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_210">forming</a> a style</p>
<p>on the most esteemed and truculent examples) and casual eccentric</p>
<p>spectators who preferred this pit of iniquity to the free</p>
<p>sunlight outside. Every one was damply hot, the examining King's</p>
<p>Counsel wiped the perspiration from his huge, clean-shaven upper</p>
<p>lip; and into this atmosphere of grasping contention and human</p>
<p>exhalations the daylight filtered through a window that was</p>
<p>manifestly dirty. The jury sat in a double pew to the left of</p>
<p>the judge, looking as uncomfortable as frogs that have fallen</p>
<p>into an ash-pit, and in the witness-box lied the would-be</p>
<p>omnivorous Dass, under cross-examination…</p>
<p>Holsten had always been accustomed to publish his results so soon</p>
<p>as they appeared to him to be sufficiently advanced to furnish a</p>
<p>basis for further work, and to that confiding <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_211">disposition</a> and one</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_212">happy</a> flash of adaptive invention the alert Dass owed his</p>
<p>claim…</p>
<p>But indeed a vast multitude of such sharp people were clutching,</p>
<p>patenting, pre-empting, monopolising this or that feature of the</p>
<p>new development, seeking to subdue this gigantic winged power to</p>
<p>the purposes of their little lusts and avarice. That trial is</p>
<p>just one of innumerable disputes of the same kind. For a time the</p>
<p>face of the world festered with patent legislation. It chanced,</p>
<p>however, to have one oddly dramatic feature in the fact that</p>
<p>Holsten, after <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_213">being</a> kept waiting about the court for two days as</p>
<p>a beggar might have waited at a rich man's door, after <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_213">being</a></p>
<p>bullied by ushers and watched by policemen, was called as a</p>
<p>witness, rather severely handled by counsel, and told not to</p>
<p>'quibble' by the judge when he was trying to be absolutely</p>
<p>explicit.</p>
<p>The judge scratched his nose with a quill pen, and sneered at</p>
<p>Holsten's astonishment round the corner of his monstrous wig.</p>
<p>Holsten was a great man, was he? Well, in a law-court great men</p>
<p>were put in their places.</p>
<p>'We want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_214">know</a> has the plaintiff added anything to this or</p>
<p>hasn't he?' said the judge, 'we don't want to have your views</p>
<p>whether Sir Philip Dass's improvements were merely superficial</p>
<p>adaptations or whether they were implicit in your paper. No</p>
<p>doubt-after the manner of inventors-you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_215">think</a> most things that</p>
<p>were ever likely to be discovered are implicit in your papers. No</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_216">doubt</a> also you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_215">think</a> too that most subsequent additions and</p>
<p>modifications are merely superficial. Inventors have a way of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_217">thinking</a> that. The law isn't concerned with that sort of thing.</p>
<p>The law has nothing to do with the vanity of inventors. The law</p>
<p>is concerned with the question whether these patent rights have</p>
<p>the novelty the plantiff claims for them. What that admission</p>
<p>may or may not stop, and all these other things you are saying in</p>
<p>your overflowing zeal to answer more than the questions addressed</p>
<p>to you-none of these things have anything whatever to do with</p>
<p>the case in hand. It is a matter of constant astonishment to me</p>
<p>in this court to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_218">see</a> how you scientific men, with all your</p>
<p>extraordinary claims to precision and veracity, wander and wander</p>
<p>so soon as you get into the witness-box. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_214">know</a> no more</p>
<p>unsatisfactory class of witness. The plain and simple question</p>
<p>is, has Sir Philip Dass made any <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_219">real</a> addition to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_220">existing</a></p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_221">knowledge</a> and methods in this matter or has he not? We don't</p>
<p>want to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_214">know</a> whether they were large or small additions nor what</p>
<p>the consequences of your admission may be. That you will leave to</p>
<p>us.'</p>
<p>Holsten was silent.</p>
<p>'Surely?' said the judge, almost <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_222">pityingly</a>.</p>
<p>'No, he hasn't,' said Holsten, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_223">perceiving</a> that for once in his</p>
<p>life he must disregard infinitesimals.</p>
<p>'Ah!' said the judge, 'now why couldn't you say that when counsel</p>
<p>put the question?…'</p>
<p>An entry in Holsten's diary-autobiography, dated five days later,</p>
<p>runs: 'Still amazed. The law is the most dangerous thing in this</p>
<p>country. It is hundreds of years old. It hasn't an idea. The</p>
<p>oldest of old bottles and this new wine, the most explosive wine.</p>
<p>Something will overtake them.'</p>
<p>Section 4</p>
<p>There was a certain <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_224">truth</a> in Holsten's assertion that the law was</p>
<p>'hundreds of years old.' It was, in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_225">relation</a> to current <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_226">thought</a></p>
<p>and widely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_227">accepted</a> ideas, an archaic thing. While almost all the</p>
<p>material and methods of life had been changing rapidly and were</p>
<p>now changing still more rapidly, the law-courts and the</p>
<p>legislatures of the world were struggling desperately to meet</p>
<p>modern demands with devices and procedures, conceptions of rights</p>
<p>and property and authority and obligation that dated from the</p>
<p>rude compromises of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_228">relatively</a> barbaric times. The horse-hair</p>
<p>wigs and antic dresses of the British judges, their musty courts</p>
<p>and overbearing manners, were indeed only the outward and visible</p>
<p>intimations of profounder anachronisms. The legal and political</p>
<p>organisation of the earth in the middle twentieth century was</p>
<p>indeed everywhere like a complicated garment, outworn yet strong,</p>
<p>that now fettered the governing body that once it had protected.</p>
<p>Yet that same <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_229">spirit</a> of free-thinking and outspoken publication</p>
<p>that in the field of natural science had been the beginning of</p>
<p>the conquest of nature, was at work throughout all the eighteenth</p>
<p>and nineteenth centuries preparing the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_229">spirit</a> of the new world</p>
<p>within the degenerating body of the old. The idea of a greater</p>
<p>subordination of individual interests and established</p>
<p>institutions to the collective future, is traceable more and more</p>
<p>clearly in the literature of those times, and movement after</p>
<p>movement fretted itself away in criticism of and opposition to</p>
<p>first this aspect and then that of the legal, social, and</p>
<p>political order. Already in the early nineteenth century Shelley,</p>
<p>with no scrap of alternative, is denouncing the established</p>
<p>rulers of the world as Anarchs, and the entire system of ideas</p>
<p>and suggestions that was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_230">known</a> as Socialism, and more</p>
<p>particularly its international side, feeble as it was in creative</p>
<p>proposals or any method of transition, still witnesses to the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_231">growth</a> of a conception of a modernised system of</p>
<p>inter-relationships that should supplant the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_232">existing</a> tangle of</p>
<p>proprietary legal ideas.</p>
<p>The word 'Sociology' was invented by Herbert Spencer, a popular</p>
<p>writer upon philosophical subjects, who flourished about the</p>
<p>middle of the nineteenth century, but the idea of a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_233">state</a>,</p>
<p>planned as an electric-traction system is planned, without</p>
<p>reference to pre-existing apparatus, upon scientific lines, did</p>
<p>not take a very strong hold upon the popular imagination of the</p>
<p>world until the twentieth century. Then, the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_234">growing</a> impatience</p>
<p>of the American people with the monstrous and socially paralysing</p>
<p>party systems that had sprung out of their absurd electoral</p>
<p>arrangements, led to the appearance of what came to be called the</p>
<p>'Modern State' movement, and a galaxy of brilliant writers, in</p>
<p>America, Europe, and the East, stirred up the world to the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_235">thought</a> of bolder rearrangements of social interaction, property,</p>
<p>employment, education, and government, than had ever been</p>
<p>contemplated before. No <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_236">doubt</a> these Modern State ideas were very</p>
<p>largely the reflection upon social and political <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_235">thought</a> of the</p>
<p>vast revolution in material things that had been in progress for</p>
<p>two hundred years, but for a long time they seemed to be having</p>
<p>no more <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_237">influence</a> upon <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_238">existing</a> institutions than the writings of</p>
<p>Rousseau and Voltaire seemed to have had at the time of the death</p>
<p>of the latter. They were fermenting in men's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_239">minds</a>, and it needed</p>
<p>only just such social and political stresses as the coming of the</p>
<p>atomic mechanisms brought about, to thrust them forward abruptly</p>
<p>into crude and startling realisation.</p>
<p>Section 5</p>
<p>Frederick Barnet's Wander Jahre is one of those autobiographical</p>
<p>novels that were popular throughout the third and fourth decades</p>
<p>of the twentieth century. It was published in 1970, and one must</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_240">understand</a> Wander Jahre rather in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_241">spiritual</a> and intellectual</p>
<p>than in a literal sense. It is indeed an allusive title,</p>
<p>carrying the world back to the Wilhelm Meister of Goethe, a</p>
<p>century and a half earlier.</p>
<p>Its author, Frederick Barnet, gives a minute and curious history</p>
<p>of his life and ideas between his nineteenth and his twenty-third</p>
<p>birthdays. He was neither a very original nor a very brilliant</p>
<p>man, but he had a trick of circumstantial writing; and though no</p>
<p>authentic portrait was to survive for the information of</p>
<p>posterity, he betrays by a score of casual phrases that he was</p>
<p>short, sturdy, inclined to be plump, with a 'rather blobby' face,</p>
<p>and full, rather projecting blue eyes. He belonged until the</p>
<p>financial debacle of 1956 to the class of fairly prosperous</p>
<p>people, he was a student in London, he aeroplaned to Italy and</p>
<p>then had a pedestrian tour from Genoa to Rome, crossed in the air</p>
<p>to Greece and Egypt, and came back over the Balkans and Germany.</p>
<p>His family fortunes, which were largely invested in bank shares,</p>
<p>coal mines, and house property, were destroyed. Reduced to</p>
<p>penury, he sought to earn a living. He suffered great hardship,</p>
<p>and was then caught up by the war and had a year of soldiering,</p>
<p>first as an officer in the English infantry and then in the army</p>
<p>of pacification. His book tells all these things so simply and</p>
<p>at the same time so explicitly, that it remains, as it were, an</p>
<p>eye by which future generations may have at least one man's</p>
<p>vision of the years of the Great Change.</p>
<p>And he was, he tells us, a 'Modern State' man 'by instinct' from</p>
<p>the beginning. He breathed in these ideas in the class rooms and</p>
<p>laboratories of the Carnegie Foundation school that rose, a long</p>
<p>and delicately beautiful facade, along the South Bank of the</p>
<p>Thames opposite the ancient dignity of Somerset House. Such</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_242">thought</a> was interwoven with the very fabric of that pioneer</p>
<p>school in the educational renascence in England. After the</p>
<p>customary exchange years in Heidelberg and Paris, he went into</p>
<p>the classical school of London University. The older so-called</p>
<p>'classical' education of the British pedagogues, probably the</p>
<p>most paralysing, ineffective, and foolish routine that ever</p>
<p>wasted human life, had already been swept out of this great</p>
<p>institution in favour of modern methods; and he learnt Greek and</p>
<p>Latin as well as he had learnt German, Spanish, and French, so</p>
<p>that he wrote and spoke them freely, and used them with an</p>
<p>unconscious ease in his study of the foundation civilisations of</p>
<p>the European system to which they were the key. (This change was</p>
<p>still so recent that he mentions an encounter in Rome with an</p>
<p>'Oxford don' who 'spoke Latin with a Wiltshire accent and</p>
<p>manifest discomfort, wrote Greek letters with his tongue out, and</p>
<p>seemed to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_243">think</a> a Greek sentence a charm when it was a quotation</p>
<p>and an impropriety when it wasn't.')</p>
<p>Barnet <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_244">saw</a> the last days of the coal-steam engines upon the</p>
<p>English railways and the gradual cleansing of the London</p>
<p>atmosphere as the smoke-creating sea-coal fires gave place to</p>
<p>electric heating. The building of laboratories at Kensington was</p>
<p>still in progress, and he took part in the students' riots that</p>
<p>delayed the removal of the Albert Memorial. He carried a banner</p>
<p>with 'We like Funny Statuary' on one side, and on the other</p>
<p>'Seats and Canopies for Statues, Why should our Great Departed</p>
<p>Stand in the Rain?' He learnt the rather athletic aviation of</p>
<p>those days at the University grounds at Sydenham, and he was</p>
<p>fined for flying over the new prison for political libellers at</p>
<p>Wormwood Scrubs, 'in a manner calculated to exhilarate the</p>
<p>prisoners while at exercise.' That was the time of the attempted</p>
<p>suppression of any criticism of the public judicature and the</p>
<p>place was crowded with journalists who had ventured to call</p>
<p>attention to the dementia of Chief Justice Abrahams. Barnet was</p>
<p>not a very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_245">good</a> aviator, he confesses he was always a little</p>
<p>afraid of his machine-there was excellent reason for every one</p>
<p>to be afraid of those clumsy early types-and he never attempted</p>
<p>steep descents or very high flying. He also, he records, owned</p>
<p>one of those oil-driven motor-bicycles whose clumsy complexity</p>
<p>and extravagant filthiness still astonish the visitors to the</p>
<p>museum of machinery at South Kensington. He mentions running</p>
<p>over a dog and complains of the ruinous price of 'spatchcocks' in</p>
<p>Surrey. 'Spatchcocks,' it seems, was a slang term for crushed</p>
<p>hens.</p>
<p>He passed the examinations necessary to reduce his military</p>
<p>service to a minimum, and his want of any special scientific or</p>
<p>technical qualification and a certain precocious corpulence that</p>
<p>handicapped his aviation indicated the infantry of the line as</p>
<p>his sphere of training. That was the most generalised <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_246">form</a> of</p>
<p>soldiering. The development of the theory of war had been for</p>
<p>some decades but little assisted by any practical <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_247">experience</a>.</p>
<p>What fighting had occurred in recent years, had been fighting in</p>
<p>minor or uncivilised <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_248">states</a>, with peasant or barbaric soldiers</p>
<p>and with but a small equipment of modern contrivances, and the</p>
<p>great powers of the world were content for the most part to</p>
<p>maintain armies that sustained in their broader organisation the</p>
<p>traditions of the European wars of thirty and forty years before.</p>
<p>There was the infantry arm to which Barnet belonged and which was</p>
<p>supposed to fight on foot with a rifle and be the main portion of</p>
<p>the army. There were cavalry forces (horse soldiers), having a</p>
<p>ratio to the infantry that had been determined by the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_247">experiences</a></p>
<p>of the Franco-German war in 1871. There was also artillery, and</p>
<p>for some unexplained reason much of this was still drawn by</p>
<p>horses; though there were also in all the European armies a small</p>
<p>number of motor-guns with wheels so constructed that they could</p>
<p>go over broken ground. In addition there were large developments</p>
<p>of the engineering arm, concerned with motor transport,</p>
<p>motor-bicycle scouting, aviation, and the like.</p>
<p>No first-class intelligence had been sought to specialise in and</p>
<p>work out the problem of warfare with the new appliances and under</p>
<p>modern <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_249">conditions</a>, but a succession of able jurists, Lord</p>
<p>Haldane, Chief Justice Briggs, and that very able King's Counsel,</p>
<p>Philbrick, had reconstructed the army frequently and thoroughly</p>
<p>and placed it at last, with the adoption of national service,</p>
<p>upon a footing that would have seemed very imposing to the public</p>
<p>of 1900. At any moment the British Empire could now put a</p>
<p>million and a quarter of arguable soldiers upon the board of</p>
<p>Welt-Politik. The traditions of Japan and the Central European</p>
<p>armies were more princely and less forensic; the Chinese still</p>
<p>refused resolutely to become a military power, and maintained a</p>
<p>small standing army upon the American model that was said, so far</p>
<p>as it went, to be highly efficient, and Russia, secured by a</p>
<p>stringent administration against internal criticism, had scarcely</p>
<p>altered the design of a uniform or the organisation of a battery</p>
<p>since the opening decades of the century. Barnet's opinion of his</p>
<p>military training was manifestly a poor one, his Modern State</p>
<p>ideas <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_250">disposed</a> him to regard it as a bore, and his common sense</p>
<p>condemned it as useless. Moreover, his habit of body made him</p>
<p>peculiarly sensitive to the fatigues and hardships of service.</p>
<p>'For three days in succession we turned out before dawn and-for</p>
<p>no earthly reason-without breakfast,' he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_251">relates</a>. 'I suppose</p>
<p>that is to show us that when the Day comes the first thing will</p>
<p>be to get us thoroughly uncomfortable and rotten. We then</p>
<p>proceeded to Kriegspiel, according to the mysterious ideas of</p>
<p>those in authority over us. On the last day we spent three hours</p>
<p>under a hot if early sun getting over eight miles of country to a</p>
<p>point we could have reached in a motor omnibus in nine minutes</p>
<p>and a half-I did it the next day in that-and then we made a</p>
<p>massed attack upon entrenchments that could have shot us all</p>
<p>about three times over if only the umpires had let them. Then</p>
<p>came a little bayonet exercise, but I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_252">doubt</a> if <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_253">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_254">am</a> sufficiently</p>
<p>a barbarian to stick this long knife into anything living. Anyhow</p>
<p>in this battle I shouldn't have had a chance. Assuming that by</p>
<p>some miracle I hadn't been shot three times over, I was far too</p>
<p>hot and blown when I got up to the entrenchments even to lift my</p>
<p>beastly rifle. It was those others would have begun the</p>
<p>sticking…</p>
<p>'For a time we were watched by two hostile aeroplanes; then our</p>
<p>own came up and asked them not to, and-the practice of aerial</p>
<p>warfare still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_255">being</a> unknown-they very politely desisted and went</p>
<p>away and did dives and circles of the most charming description</p>
<p>over the Fox Hills.'</p>
<p>All Barnet's accounts of his military training were written in</p>
<p>the same half-contemptuous, half-protesting tone. He was of</p>
<p>opinion that his chances of participating in any <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_256">real</a> warfare</p>
<p>were very slight, and that, if after all he should participate,</p>
<p>it was bound to be so entirely different from these peace</p>
<p>manoeuvres that his only course as a rational man would be to</p>
<p>keep as observantly out of danger as he could until he had learnt</p>
<p>the tricks and possibilities of the new <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_257">conditions</a>. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_258">states</a></p>
<p>this quite frankly. Never was a man more free from sham heroics.</p>
<p>Section 6</p>
<p>Barnet welcomed the appearance of the atomic engine with the zest</p>
<p>of masculine youth in all fresh machinery, and it is evident that</p>
<p>for some time he failed to connect the rush of wonderful new</p>
<p>possibilities with the financial troubles of his family. 'I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_259">knew</a></p>
<p>my father was worried,' he admits. That cast the smallest of</p>
<p>shadows upon his delighted departure for Italy and Greece and</p>
<p>Egypt with three congenial companions in one of the new atomic</p>
<p>models. They flew over the Channel Isles and Touraine, he</p>
<p>mentions, and circled about Mont Blanc-'These new helicopters,</p>
<p>we found,' he notes, 'had abolished all the danger and strain of</p>
<p>sudden drops to which the old-time aeroplanes were liable'-and</p>
<p>then he went on by way of Pisa, Paestum, Ghirgenti, and Athens,</p>
<p>to visit the pyramids by moonlight, flying thither from Cairo,</p>
<p>and to follow the Nile up to Khartum. Even by later standards,</p>
<p>it must have been a very gleeful holiday for a young man, and it</p>
<p>made the tragedy of his next <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_260">experiences</a> all the darker. A week</p>
<p>after his return his father, who was a widower, announced <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_261">himself</a></p>
<p>ruined, and committed suicide by means of an unscheduled opiate.</p>
<p>At one blow Barnet found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_262">himself</a> flung out of the possessing,</p>
<p>spending, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_263">enjoying</a> class to which he belonged, penniless and with</p>
<p>no calling by which he could earn a living. He tried teaching</p>
<p>and some journalism, but in a little while he found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_262">himself</a> on</p>
<p>the underside of a world in which he had always reckoned to live</p>
<p>in the sunshine. For innumerable men such an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_264">experience</a> has</p>
<p>meant mental and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_265">spiritual</a> destruction, but Barnet, in spite of</p>
<p>his bodily gravitation towards <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_266">comfort</a>, showed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_262">himself</a> when put</p>
<p>to the test, of the more valiant modern quality. He was saturated</p>
<p>with the creative stoicism of the heroic times that were already</p>
<p>dawning, and he took his difficulties and discomforts stoutly as</p>
<p>his appointed material, and turned them to expression.</p>
<p>Indeed, in his book, he thanks fortune for them. 'I might have</p>
<p>lived and died,' he says, 'in that neat fool's paradise of secure</p>
<p>lavishness above there. I might never have realised the</p>
<p>gathering wrath and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_267">sorrow</a> of the ousted and exasperated masses.</p>
<p>In the days of my own prosperity things had seemed to me to be</p>
<p>very well arranged.' Now from his new point of view he was to</p>
<p>find they were not arranged at all; that government was a</p>
<p>compromise of aggressions and powers and lassitudes, and law a</p>
<p>convention between interests, and that the poor and the weak,</p>
<p>though they had many negligent masters, had few friends.</p>
<p>'I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_268">thought</a> things were looked after,' he wrote. 'It was with</p>
<p>a kind of amazement that I tramped the roads and starved-and</p>
<p>found that no one in particular cared.'</p>
<p>He was turned out of his lodging in a backward part of London.</p>
<p>'It was with difficulty I persuaded my landlady-she was a needy</p>
<p>widow, poor <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_269">soul</a>, and I was already in her debt-to keep an old</p>
<p>box for me in which I had locked a few letters, keepsakes, and</p>
<p>the like. She lived in great <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_270">fear</a> of the Public Health and</p>
<p>Morality Inspectors, because she was sometimes too poor to pay</p>
<p>the customary tip to them, but at last she consented to put it in</p>
<p>a dark tiled place under the stairs, and then I went forth into</p>
<p>the world-to seek first the luck of a meal and then shelter.'</p>
<p>He wandered down into the thronging gayer parts of London, in</p>
<p>which a year or so ago he had been numbered among the spenders.</p>
<p>London, under the Visible Smoke Law, by which any production of</p>
<p>visible smoke with or without excuse was punishable by a fine,</p>
<p>had already <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_271">ceased</a> to be the sombre smoke-darkened city of the</p>
<p>Victorian time; it had been, and indeed was, constantly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_272">being</a></p>
<p>rebuilt, and its main streets were already beginning to take on</p>
<p>those characteristics that distinguished them throughout the</p>
<p>latter half of the twentieth century. The insanitary horse and</p>
<p>the plebeian bicycle had been banished from the roadway, which</p>
<p>was now of a resilient, glass-like surface, spotlessly clean; and</p>
<p>the foot passenger was restricted to a narrow vestige of the</p>
<p>ancient footpath on either side of the track and forbidden at the</p>
<p>risk of a fine, if he survived, to cross the roadway. People</p>
<p>descended from their automobiles upon this pavement and went</p>
<p>through the lower shops to the lifts and stairs to the new ways</p>
<p>for pedestrians, the Rows, that ran along the front of the houses</p>
<p>at the level of the first story, and, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_272">being</a> joined by frequent</p>
<p>bridges, gave the newer parts of London a curiously Venetian</p>
<p>appearance. In some streets there were upper and even third-story</p>
<p>Rows. For most of the day and all night the shop windows were</p>
<p>lit by electric light, and many establishments had made, as it</p>
<p>were, canals of public footpaths through their premises in order</p>
<p>to increase their window space.</p>
<p>Barnet made his way along this night-scene rather apprehensively</p>
<p>since the police had power to challenge and demand the Labour</p>
<p>Card of any indigent-looking person, and if the record failed to</p>
<p>show he was in employment, dismiss him to the traffic pavement</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>But there was still enough of his former gentility about Barnet's</p>
<p>appearance and bearing to protect him from this; the police, too,</p>
<p>had other things to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_273">think</a> of that night, and he was permitted to</p>
<p>reach the galleries about Leicester Square-that great focus of</p>
<p>London life and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_274">pleasure</a>.</p>
<p>He gives a vivid description of the scene that evening. In the</p>
<p>centre was a garden raised on arches lit by festoons of lights</p>
<p>and connected with the Rows by eight graceful bridges, beneath</p>
<p>which hummed the interlacing streams of motor traffic, pulsating</p>
<p>as the current alternated between east and west and north and</p>
<p>south. Above rose great frontages of intricate rather than</p>
<p>beautiful reinforced porcelain, studded with lights, barred by</p>
<p>bold illuminated advertisements, and glowing with reflections.</p>
<p>There were the two historical music halls of this place, the</p>
<p>Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, in which the municipal players</p>
<p>revolved perpetually through the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_275">cycle</a> of Shakespeare's plays,</p>
<p>and four other great houses of refreshment and entertainment</p>
<p>whose pinnacles streamed up into the blue obscurity of the night.</p>
<p>The south side of the square was in dark contrast to the others;</p>
<p>it was still <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_276">being</a> rebuilt, and a lattice of steel bars</p>
<p>surmounted by the frozen gestures of monstrous cranes rose over</p>
<p>the excavated sites of vanished Victorian buildings.</p>
<p>This framework attracted Barnet's attention for a time to the</p>
<p>exclusion of other interests. It was absolutely still, it had a</p>
<p>dead rigidity, a stricken inaction, no one was at work upon it</p>
<p>and all its machinery was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_277">quiet</a>; but the constructor's globes of</p>
<p>vacuum light filled its every interstice with a quivering green</p>
<p>moonshine and showed alert but motionless-soldier sentinels!</p>
<p>He asked a passing stroller, and was told that the men had struck</p>
<p>that day against the use of an atomic riveter that would have</p>
<p>doubled the individual efficiency and halved the number of steel</p>
<p>workers.</p>
<p>'Shouldn't wonder if they didn't get chucking bombs,' said</p>
<p>Barnet's informant, hovered for a moment, and then went on his</p>
<p>way to the Alhambra music hall.</p>
<p>Barnet became aware of an excitement in the newspaper kiosks at</p>
<p>the corners of the square. Something very sensational had been</p>
<p>flashed upon the transparencies. Forgetting for a moment his</p>
<p>penniless <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_278">condition</a>, he made his way over a bridge to buy a</p>
<p>paper, for in those days the papers, which were printed upon thin</p>
<p>sheets of metallic foil, were sold at determinate points by</p>
<p>specially licensed purveyors. Half over, he stopped short at a</p>
<p>change in the traffic below; and was astonished to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_279">see</a> that the</p>
<p>police signals were restricting vehicles to the half roadway.</p>
<p>When presently he got within <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_280">sight</a> of the transparencies that had</p>
<p>replaced the placards of Victorian times, he read of the Great</p>
<p>March of the Unemployed that was already in progress through the</p>
<p>West End, and so without expenditure he was able to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_281">understand</a></p>
<p>what was coming.</p>
<p>He watched, and his book describes this procession which the</p>
<p>police had considered it unwise to prevent and which had been</p>
<p>spontaneously organised in imitation of the Unemployed</p>
<p>Processions of earlier times. He had expected a mob but there was</p>
<p>a kind of sullen discipline about the procession when at last it</p>
<p>arrived. What seemed for a time an unending column of men</p>
<p>marched wearily, marched with a kind of implacable futility,</p>
<p>along the roadway underneath him. He was, he says, moved to join</p>
<p>them, but instead he remained watching. They were a dingy,</p>
<p>shabby, ineffective-looking multitude, for the most part</p>
<p>incapable of any but obsolete and superseded types of labour.</p>
<p>They bore a few banners with the time-honoured inscription:</p>
<p>'Work, not Charity,' but otherwise their ranks were unadorned.</p>
<p>They were not singing, they were not even talking, there was</p>
<p>nothing truculent nor aggressive in their bearing, they had no</p>
<p>definite <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_282">objective</a> they were just marching and showing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_283">themselves</a></p>
<p>in the more prosperous parts of London. They were a sample of</p>
<p>that great mass of unskilled cheap labour which the now still</p>
<p>cheaper mechanical powers had superseded for evermore. They were</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_284">being</a> 'scrapped'-as horses had been 'scrapped.'</p>
<p>Barnet leant over the parapet watching them, his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_285">mind</a> quickened</p>
<p>by his own precarious <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_286">condition</a>. For a time, he says, he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_287">felt</a></p>
<p>nothing but <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_288">despair</a> at the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_289">sight</a>; what should be done, what could</p>
<p>be done for this gathering surplus of humanity? They were so</p>
<p>manifestly useless-and incapable-and pitiful.</p>
<p>What were they asking for?</p>
<p>They had been overtaken by unexpected things. Nobody had</p>
<p>foreseen--</p>
<p>It flashed suddenly into his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_290">mind</a> just what the multitudinous</p>
<p>shambling enigma below meant. It was an appeal against the</p>
<p>unexpected, an appeal to those others who, more fortunate, seemed</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_291">wiser</a> and more powerful, for something-for INTELLIGENCE. This</p>
<p>mute mass, weary footed, rank following rank, protested its</p>
<p>persuasion that some of these others must have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_292">foreseen</a> these</p>
<p>dislocations-that anyhow they ought to have foreseen-and</p>
<p>arranged.</p>
<p>That was what this crowd of wreckage was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_293">feeling</a> and seeking so</p>
<p>dumbly to assert.</p>
<p>'Things came to me like the turning on of a light in a darkened</p>
<p>room,' he says. 'These men were praying to their fellow</p>
<p>creatures as once they prayed to God! The last thing that men</p>
<p>will realise about anything is that it is inanimate. They had</p>
<p>transferred their animation to mankind. They still believed</p>
<p>there was intelligence somewhere, even if it was careless or</p>
<p>malignant… It had only to be aroused to be</p>
<p>conscience-stricken, to be moved to exertion… And I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_294">saw</a>, too,</p>
<p>that as yet THERE WAS NO SUCH INTELLIGENCE. The world waits for</p>
<p>intelligence. That intelligence has still to be made, that will</p>
<p>for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_295">good</a> and order has still to be gathered together, out of</p>
<p>scraps of impulse and wandering seeds of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_296">benevolence</a> and whatever</p>
<p>is fine and creative in our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_297">souls</a>, into a common purpose. It's</p>
<p>something still to come…'</p>
<p>It is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_298">characteristic</a> of the widening <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_299">thought</a> of the time that</p>
<p>this not very heroical young man who, in any previous age, might</p>
<p>well have been altogether occupied with the problem of his own</p>
<p>individual necessities, should be able to stand there and</p>
<p>generalise about the needs of the race.</p>
<p>But upon all the stresses and conflicts of that chaotic time</p>
<p>there was already dawning the light of a new era. The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_300">spirit</a> of</p>
<p>humanity was escaping, even then it was escaping, from its</p>
<p>extreme imprisonment in individuals. Salvation from the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_301">bitter</a></p>
<p>intensities of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_302">self</a>, which had been a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_303">conscious</a> religious end for</p>
<p>thousands of years, which men had sought in mortifications, in</p>
<p>the wilderness, in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_304">meditation</a>, and by innumerable strange paths,</p>
<p>was coming at last with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_305">effect</a> of naturalness into the talk</p>
<p>of men, into the books they read, into their unconscious</p>
<p>gestures, into their newspapers and daily purposes and everyday</p>
<p>acts. The broad horizons, the magic possibilities that the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_300">spirit</a></p>
<p>of the seeker had revealed to them, were charming them out of</p>
<p>those ancient and instinctive preoccupations from which the very</p>
<p>threat of hell and torment had failed to drive them. And this</p>
<p>young man, homeless and without provision even for the immediate</p>
<p>hours, in the presence of social disorganisation, distress, and</p>
<p>perplexity, in a blazing wilderness of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_306">thoughtless</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_307">pleasure</a> that</p>
<p>blotted out the stars, could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_308">think</a> as he tells us he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_309">thought</a>.</p>
<p>'I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_310">saw</a> life plain,' he wrote. 'I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_310">saw</a> the gigantic task before</p>
<p>us, and the very splendour of its intricate and immeasurable</p>
<p>difficulty filled me with exaltation. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_310">saw</a> that we have still</p>
<p>to discover government, that we have still to discover education,</p>
<p>which is the necessary reciprocal of government, and that all</p>
<p>this-in which my own little speck of a life was so manifestly</p>
<p>overwhelmed-this and its yesterday in Greece and Rome and Egypt</p>
<p>were nothing, the mere first dust swirls of the beginning, the</p>
<p>movements and dim murmurings of a sleeper who will presently be</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_311">awake</a>…'</p>
<p>Section 7</p>
<p>And then the story tells, with an engaging simplicity, of his</p>
<p>descent from this <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_312">ecstatic</a> vision of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_313">reality</a>.</p>
<p>'Presently I found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_314">myself</a> again, and I was beginning to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_315">feel</a> cold</p>
<p>and a little hungry.'</p>
<p>He bethought <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_316">himself</a> of the John Burns Relief Offices which stood</p>
<p>upon the Thames Embankment. He made his way through the</p>
<p>galleries of the booksellers and the National Gallery, which had</p>
<p>been open <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_317">continuously</a> day and night to all decently dressed</p>
<p>people now for more than twelve years, and across the</p>
<p>rose-gardens of Trafalgar Square, and so by the hotel colonnade</p>
<p>to the Embankment. He had long <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_318">known</a> of these admirable offices,</p>
<p>which had swept the last beggars and matchsellers and all the</p>
<p>casual indigent from the London streets, and he believed that he</p>
<p>would, as a matter of course, be able to procure a ticket for</p>
<p>food and a night's lodgings and some indication of possible</p>
<p>employment.</p>
<p>But he had not reckoned upon the new labour troubles, and when he</p>
<p>got to the Embankment he found the offices hopelessly congested</p>
<p>and besieged by a large and rather unruly crowd. He hovered for</p>
<p>a time on the outskirts of the waiting multitude, perplexed and</p>
<p>dismayed, and then he became aware of a movement, a purposive</p>
<p>trickling away of people, up through the arches of the great</p>
<p>buildings that had arisen when all the railway stations were</p>
<p>removed to the south side of the river, and so to the covered</p>
<p>ways of the Strand. And here, in the open glare of midnight, he</p>
<p>found unemployed men begging, and not only begging, but begging</p>
<p>with astonishing assurance, from the people who were emerging</p>
<p>from the small theatres and other such places of entertainment</p>
<p>which abounded in that thoroughfare.</p>
<p>This was an altogether unexampled thing. There had been no</p>
<p>begging in London streets for a quarter of a century. But that</p>
<p>night the police were evidently unwilling or unable to cope with</p>
<p>the destitute who were invading those well-kept quarters of the</p>
<p>town. They had become stonily blind to anything but manifest</p>
<p>disorder.</p>
<p>Barnet walked through the crowd, unable to bring <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_319">himself</a> to ask;</p>
<p>indeed his bearing must have been more valiant than his</p>
<p>circumstances, for twice he says that he was begged from. Near</p>
<p>the Trafalgar Square gardens, a girl with reddened cheeks and</p>
<p>blackened eyebrows, who was walking <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_320">alone</a>, spoke to him with a</p>
<p>peculiar friendliness.</p>
<p>'I'm starving,' he said to her abruptly.</p>
<p>'Oh! poor dear!' she said; and with the impulsive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_321">generosity</a> of</p>
<p>her kind, glanced round and slipped a silver piece into his</p>
<p>hand…</p>
<p>It was a gift that, in spite of the precedent of De Quincey,</p>
<p>might under the repressive social legislation of those times,</p>
<p>have brought Barnet within reach of the prison lash. But he took</p>
<p>it, he confesses, and thanked her as well as he was able, and</p>
<p>went off very gladly to get food.</p>
<p>Section 8</p>
<p>A day or so later-and again his freedom to go as he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_322">pleased</a> upon</p>
<p>the roads may be taken as a mark of increasing social</p>
<p>disorganisation and police embarrassment-he wandered out into</p>
<p>the open country. He speaks of the roads of that plutocratic age</p>
<p>as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_323">being</a> 'fenced with barbed wire against unpropertied people,'</p>
<p>of the high-walled gardens and trespass warnings that kept him to</p>
<p>the dusty narrowness of the public ways. In the air, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_324">happy</a> rich</p>
<p>people were flying, heedless of the misfortunes about them, as he</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_325">himself</a> had been flying two years ago, and along the road swept</p>
<p>the new traffic, light and swift and wonderful. One was rarely</p>
<p>out of earshot of its whistles and gongs and siren cries even in</p>
<p>the field paths or over the open downs. The officials of the</p>
<p>labour exchanges were everywhere overworked and infuriated, the</p>
<p>casual wards were so crowded that the surplus wanderers slept in</p>
<p>ranks under sheds or in the open air, and since giving to</p>
<p>wayfarers had been made a punishable offence there was no longer</p>
<p>friendship or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_326">help</a> for a man from the rare foot passenger or the</p>
<p>wayside cottage…</p>
<p>'I wasn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_327">angry</a>,' said Barnet. 'I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_328">saw</a> an immense <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_329">selfishness</a>, a</p>
<p>monstrous disregard for anything but <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_330">pleasure</a> and possession in</p>
<p>all those people above us, but I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_328">saw</a> how inevitable that was, how</p>
<p>certainly if the richest had changed places with the poorest,</p>
<p>that things would have been the same. What else can happen when</p>
<p>men use science and every new thing that science gives, and all</p>
<p>their available intelligence and energy to manufacture wealth and</p>
<p>appliances, and leave government and education to the rustling</p>
<p>traditions of hundreds of years ago? Those traditions come from</p>
<p>the dark ages when there was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_331">really</a> not enough for every one,</p>
<p>when life was a fierce struggle that might be masked but could</p>
<p>not be escaped. Of course this famine grabbing, this fierce</p>
<p>dispossession of others, must follow from such a disharmony</p>
<p>between material and training. Of course the rich were vulgar and</p>
<p>the poor <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_332">grew</a> savage and every added power that came to men made</p>
<p>the rich richer and the poor less necessary and less free. The</p>
<p>men I met in the casual wards and the relief offices were all</p>
<p>smouldering for revolt, talking of justice and injustice and</p>
<p>revenge. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_328">saw</a> no hope in that talk, nor in anything but</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_333">patience</a>…'</p>
<p>But he did not mean a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_334">passive</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_335">patience</a>. He meant that the method</p>
<p>of social reconstruction was still a riddle, that no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_336">effectual</a></p>
<p>rearrangement was possible until this riddle in all its tangled</p>
<p>aspects was solved. 'I tried to talk to those discontented men,'</p>
<p>he wrote, 'but it was hard for them to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_337">see</a> things as I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_338">saw</a> them.</p>
<p>When I talked of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_335">patience</a> and the larger scheme, they answered,</p>
<p>"But then we shall all be dead"-and I could not make them <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_337">see</a>,</p>
<p>what is so simple to my own <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_339">mind</a>, that that did not affect the</p>
<p>question. Men who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_340">think</a> in lifetimes are of no use to</p>
<p>statesmanship.'</p>
<p>He does not seem to have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_341">seen</a> a newspaper during those</p>
<p>wanderings, and a chance <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_342">sight</a> of the transparency of a kiosk in</p>
<p>the market-place at Bishop's Stortford announcing a 'Grave</p>
<p>International Situation' did not excite him very much. There had</p>
<p>been so many grave international situations in recent years.</p>
<p>This time it was talk of the Central European powers suddenly</p>
<p>attacking the Slav Confederacy, with France and England going to</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_343">help</a> of the Slavs.</p>
<p>But the next night he found a tolerable meal awaiting the</p>
<p>vagrants in the casual ward, and learnt from the workhouse master</p>
<p>that all serviceable trained men were to be sent back on the</p>
<p>morrow to their mobilisation centres. The country was on the eve</p>
<p>of war. He was to go back through London to Surrey. His first</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_344">feeling</a>, he records, was one of extreme relief that his days of</p>
<p>'hopeless battering at the underside of civilisation' were at an</p>
<p>end. Here was something definite to do, something definitely</p>
<p>provided for. But his relief was greatly modified when he found</p>
<p>that the mobilisation arrangements had been made so hastily and</p>
<p>carelessly that for nearly thirty-six hours at the improvised</p>
<p>depot at Epsom he got nothing either to eat or to drink but a cup</p>
<p>of cold water. The depot was absolutely unprovisioned, and no one</p>
<p>was free to leave it.</p>

<p>CHAPTER THE SECOND</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THE LAST WAR</p>
</title>
<p>Section I</p>
<p>Viewed from the standpoint of a sane and ambitious social order,</p>
<p>it is difficult to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_345">understand</a>, and it would be tedious to follow,</p>
<p>the motives that plunged mankind into the war that fills the</p>
<p>histories of the middle decades of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>It must always be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_346">remembered</a> that the political structure of the</p>
<p>world at that time was everywhere extraordinarily behind the</p>
<p>collective intelligence. That is the central fact of that</p>
<p>history. For two hundred years there had been no great changes in</p>
<p>political or legal methods and pretensions, the utmost change had</p>
<p>been a certain shifting of boundaries and slight readjustment of</p>
<p>procedure, while in nearly every other aspect of life there had</p>
<p>been fundamental revolutions, gigantic releases, and an enormous</p>
<p>enlargement of scope and outlook. The absurdities of courts and</p>
<p>the indignities of representative parliamentary government,</p>
<p>coupled with the opening of vast fields of opportunity in other</p>
<p>directions, had withdrawn the best intelligences more and more</p>
<p>from public affairs. The ostensible governments of the world in</p>
<p>the twentieth century were following in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_347">wake</a> of the</p>
<p>ostensible religions. They were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_348">ceasing</a> to command the services</p>
<p>of any but second-rate men. After the middle of the eighteenth</p>
<p>century there are no more great ecclesiastics upon the world's</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_346">memory</a>, after the opening of the twentieth no more statesmen.</p>
<p>Everywhere one finds an energetic, ambitious, short-sighted,</p>
<p>common-place type in the seats of authority, blind to the new</p>
<p>possibilities and litigiously reliant upon the traditions of the</p>
<p>past.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most dangerous of those outworn traditions were the</p>
<p>boundaries of the various 'sovereign <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_349">states</a>,' and the conception</p>
<p>of a general predominance in human affairs on the part of some</p>
<p>one particular <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_349">state</a>. The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_350">memory</a> of the empires of Rome and</p>
<p>Alexander squatted, an unlaid carnivorous ghost, in the human</p>
<p>imagination-it bored into the human brain like some grisly</p>
<p>parasite and filled it with disordered <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_351">thoughts</a> and violent</p>
<p>impulses. For more than a century the French system exhausted</p>
<p>its vitality in belligerent convulsions, and then the infection</p>
<p>passed to the German-speaking peoples who were the heart and</p>
<p>centre of Europe, and from them onward to the Slavs. Later ages</p>
<p>were to store and neglect the vast insane literature of this</p>
<p>obsession, the intricate treaties, the secret agreements, the</p>
<p>infinite <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_352">knowingness</a> of the political writer, the cunning</p>
<p>refusals to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_353">accept</a> plain facts, the strategic devices, the</p>
<p>tactical manoeuvres, the records of mobilisations and</p>
<p>counter-mobilisations. It <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_354">ceased</a> to be credible almost as soon as</p>
<p>it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_354">ceased</a> to happen, but in the very dawn of the new age their</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_349">state</a> craftsmen sat with their historical candles burning, and,</p>
<p>in spite of strange, new reflections and unfamiliar lights and</p>
<p>shadows, still wrangling and planning to rearrange the maps of</p>
<p>Europe and the world.</p>
<p>It was to become a matter for subtle inquiry how far the millions</p>
<p>of men and women outside the world of these specialists</p>
<p>sympathised and agreed with their portentous activities. One</p>
<p>school of psychologists inclined to minimise this participation,</p>
<p>but the balance of evidence goes to show that there were massive</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_355">responses</a> to these suggestions of the belligerent schemer.</p>
<p>Primitive man had been a fiercely combative animal; innumerable</p>
<p>generations had passed their lives in tribal warfare, and the</p>
<p>weight of tradition, the example of history, the ideals of</p>
<p>loyalty and devotion fell in easily enough with the incitements</p>
<p>of the international mischief-maker. The political ideas of the</p>
<p>common man were picked up haphazard, there was practically</p>
<p>nothing in such education as he was given that was ever intended</p>
<p>to fit him for citizenship as such (that conception only</p>
<p>appeared, indeed, with the development of Modern State ideas),</p>
<p>and it was therefore a comparatively easy matter to fill his</p>
<p>vacant <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_356">mind</a> with the sounds and fury of exasperated suspicion and</p>
<p>national aggression.</p>
<p>For example, Barnet describes the London crowd as noisily</p>
<p>patriotic when presently his battalion came up from the depot to</p>
<p>London, to entrain for the French frontier. He tells of children</p>
<p>and women and lads and old men cheering and shouting, of the</p>
<p>streets and rows hung with the flags of the Allied Powers, of a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_357">real</a> enthusiasm even among the destitute and unemployed. The</p>
<p>Labour Bureaux were now partially <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_358">transformed</a> into enrolment</p>
<p>offices, and were centres of hotly patriotic excitement. At</p>
<p>every convenient place upon the line on either side of the</p>
<p>Channel Tunnel there were enthusiastic spectators, and the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_359">feeling</a> in the regiment, if a little stiffened and darkened by</p>
<p>grim anticipations, was none the less warlike.</p>
<p>But all this <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_360">emotion</a> was the fickle <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_360">emotion</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_361">minds</a> without</p>
<p>established ideas; it was with most of them, Barnet says, as it</p>
<p>was with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_362">himself</a>, a natural <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_363">response</a> to collective movement, and</p>
<p>to martial sounds and colours, and the exhilarating challenge of</p>
<p>vague dangers. And people had been so long oppressed by the</p>
<p>threat of and preparation for war that its arrival came with an</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_364">effect</a> of positive relief.</p>
<p>Section 2</p>
<p>The plan of campaign of the Allies assigned the defence of the</p>
<p>lower Meuse to the English, and the troop-trains were run direct</p>
<p>from the various British depots to the points in the Ardennes</p>
<p>where they were intended to entrench <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_365">themselves</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the documents bearing upon the campaign were destroyed</p>
<p>during the war, from the first the scheme of the Allies seems to</p>
<p>have been <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_366">confused</a>, but it is highly probable that the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_367">formation</a></p>
<p>of an aerial park in this region, from which attacks could be</p>
<p>made upon the vast industrial plant of the lower Rhine, and a</p>
<p>flanking raid through Holland upon the German naval</p>
<p>establishments at the mouth of the Elbe, were integral parts of</p>
<p>the original project. Nothing of this was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_368">known</a> to such pawns in</p>
<p>the game as Barnet and his company, whose business it was to do</p>
<p>what they were told by the mysterious intelligences at the</p>
<p>direction of things in Paris, to which city the Whitehall staff</p>
<p>had also been transferred. From first to last these directing</p>
<p>intelligences remained mysterious to the body of the army, veiled</p>
<p>under the name of 'Orders.' There was no Napoleon, no Caesar to</p>
<p>embody enthusiasm. Barnet says, 'We talked of Them. THEY are</p>
<p>sending us up into Luxembourg. THEY are going to turn the</p>
<p>Central European right.'</p>
<p>Behind the veil of this vagueness the little group of more or</p>
<p>less worthy men which constituted Headquarters was beginning to</p>
<p>realise the enormity of the thing it was supposed to control…</p>
<p>In the great hall of the War Control, whose windows looked out</p>
<p>across the Seine to the Trocadero and the palaces of the western</p>
<p>quarter, a series of big-scale relief maps were laid out upon</p>
<p>tables to display the whole seat of war, and the staff-officers</p>
<p>of the control were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_369">continually</a> busy shifting the little blocks</p>
<p>which represented the contending troops, as the reports and</p>
<p>intelligence came drifting in to the various telegraphic bureaux</p>
<p>in the adjacent rooms. In other smaller apartments there were</p>
<p>maps of a less detailed sort, upon which, for example, the</p>
<p>reports of the British Admiralty and of the Slav commanders were</p>
<p>recorded as they kept coming to hand. Upon these maps, as upon</p>
<p>chessboards, Marshal Dubois, in consultation with General Viard</p>
<p>and the Earl of Delhi, was to play the great game for world</p>
<p>supremacy against the Central European powers. Very probably he</p>
<p>had a definite idea of his game; very probably he had a coherent</p>
<p>and admirable plan.</p>
<p>But he had reckoned without a proper estimate either of the new</p>
<p>strategy of aviation or of the possibilities of atomic energy</p>
<p>that Holsten had opened for mankind. While he planned</p>
<p>entrenchments and invasions and a frontier war, the Central</p>
<p>European generalship was striking at the eyes and the brain. And</p>
<p>while, with a certain diffident hesitation, he developed his</p>
<p>gambit that night upon the lines laid down by Napoleon and</p>
<p>Moltke, his own scientific corps in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_370">state</a> of mutinous activity</p>
<p>was preparing a blow for Berlin. 'These old fools!' was the key</p>
<p>in which the scientific corps was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_371">thinking</a>.</p>
<p>The War Control in Paris, on the night of July the second, was an</p>
<p>impressive display of the paraphernalia of scientific military</p>
<p>organisation, as the first half of the twentieth century</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_372">understood</a> it. To one human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_373">being</a> at least the consulting</p>
<p>commanders had the likeness of world-wielding gods.</p>
<p>She was a skilled typist, capable of nearly sixty words a minute,</p>
<p>and she had been engaged in relay with other similar women to</p>
<p>take down orders in duplicate and hand them over to the junior</p>
<p>officers in attendance, to be forwarded and filed. There had</p>
<p>come a lull, and she had been sent out from the dictating room to</p>
<p>take the air upon the terrace before the great hall and to eat</p>
<p>such scanty refreshment as she had brought with her until her</p>
<p>services were required again.</p>
<p>From her position upon the terrace this young woman had a view</p>
<p>not only of the wide sweep of the river below her, and all the</p>
<p>eastward side of Paris from the Arc de Triomphe to Saint Cloud,</p>
<p>great blocks and masses of black or pale darkness with pink and</p>
<p>golden flashes of illumination and endless interlacing bands of</p>
<p>dotted lights under a still and starless sky, but also the whole</p>
<p>spacious interior of the great hall with its slender pillars and</p>
<p>gracious arching and clustering lamps was visible to her. There,</p>
<p>over a wilderness of tables, lay the huge maps, done on so large</p>
<p>a scale that one might fancy them small countries; the messengers</p>
<p>and attendants went and came perpetually, altering, moving the</p>
<p>little pieces that signified hundreds and thousands of men, and</p>
<p>the great commander and his two consultants stood amidst all</p>
<p>these things and near where the fighting was nearest, scheming,</p>
<p>directing. They had but to breathe a word and presently away</p>
<p>there, in the world of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_374">reality</a>, the punctual myriads moved. Men</p>
<p>rose up and went forward and died. The fate of nations lay behind</p>
<p>the eyes of these three men. Indeed they were like gods.</p>
<p>Most godlike of the three was Dubois. It was for him to decide;</p>
<p>the others at most might suggest. Her woman's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_375">soul</a> went out to</p>
<p>this grave, handsome, still, old man, in a passion of instinctive</p>
<p>worship.</p>
<p>Once she had taken words of instruction from him direct. She had</p>
<p>awaited them in an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_376">ecstasy</a> of happiness-and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_377">fear</a>. For her</p>
<p>exaltation was made terrible by the dread that some error might</p>
<p>dishonour her…</p>
<p>She watched him now through the glass with all the unpenetrating</p>
<p>minuteness of an impassioned woman's observation.</p>
<p>He said little, she remarked. He looked but little at the maps.</p>
<p>The tall Englishman beside him was manifestly troubled by a swarm</p>
<p>of ideas, conflicting ideas; he craned his neck at every shifting</p>
<p>of the little red, blue, black, and yellow pieces on the board,</p>
<p>and wanted to draw the commander's attention to this and that.</p>
<p>Dubois listened, nodded, emitted a word and became still again,</p>
<p>brooding like the national eagle.</p>
<p>His eyes were so deeply sunken under his white eyebrows that she</p>
<p>could not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_378">see</a> his eyes; his moustache overhung the mouth from</p>
<p>which those words of decision came. Viard, too, said little; he</p>
<p>was a dark man with a drooping head and melancholy, watchful</p>
<p>eyes. He was more intent upon the French right, which was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_379">feeling</a></p>
<p>its way now through Alsace to the Rhine. He was, she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_380">knew</a>, an</p>
<p>old colleague of Dubois; he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_380">knew</a> him better, she decided, he</p>
<p>trusted him more than this unfamiliar Englishman…</p>
<p>Not to talk, to remain impassive and as far as possible in</p>
<p>profile; these were the lessons that old Dubois had mastered</p>
<p>years ago. To seem to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_381">know</a> all, to betray no surprise, to refuse</p>
<p>to hurry-itself a confession of miscalculation; by attention to</p>
<p>these simple rules, Dubois had built up a steady reputation from</p>
<p>the days when he had been a promising junior officer, a still,</p>
<p>almost abstracted young man, deliberate but ready. Even then men</p>
<p>had looked at him and said: 'He will go far.' Through fifty</p>
<p>years of peace he had never once been found wanting, and at</p>
<p>manoeuvres his impassive persistence had perplexed and hypnotised</p>
<p>and defeated many a more actively intelligent man. Deep in his</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_382">soul</a> Dubois had hidden his one profound discovery about the</p>
<p>modern art of warfare, the key to his career. And this discovery</p>
<p>was that NOBODY KNEW, that to act therefore was to blunder, that</p>
<p>to talk was to confess; and that the man who acted slowly and</p>
<p>steadfastly and above all silently, had the best chance of</p>
<p>winning through. Meanwhile one fed the men. Now by this same</p>
<p>strategy he hoped to shatter those mysterious unknowns of the</p>
<p>Central European command. Delhi might talk of a great flank march</p>
<p>through Holland, with all the British submarines and hydroplanes</p>
<p>and torpedo craft pouring up the Rhine in support of it; Viard</p>
<p>might crave for brilliance with the motor bicycles, aeroplanes,</p>
<p>and ski-men among the Swiss mountains, and a sudden swoop upon</p>
<p>Vienna; the thing was to listen-and wait for the other side to</p>
<p>begin experimenting. It was all experimenting. And meanwhile he</p>
<p>remained in profile, with an air of assurance-like a man who</p>
<p>sits in an automobile after the chauffeur has had his directions.</p>
<p>And every one about him was the stronger and surer for that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_383">quiet</a></p>
<p>face, that air of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_384">knowledge</a> and unruffled confidence. The</p>
<p>clustering lights threw a score of shadows of him upon the maps,</p>
<p>great bunches of him, versions of a commanding presence, lighter</p>
<p>or darker, dominated the field, and pointed in every direction.</p>
<p>Those shadows symbolised his control. When a messenger came from</p>
<p>the wireless room to shift this or that piece in the game, to</p>
<p>replace under amended reports one Central European regiment by a</p>
<p>score, to draw back or thrust out or distribute this or that</p>
<p>force of the Allies, the Marshal would turn his head and seem not</p>
<p>to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_385">see</a>, or look and nod slightly, as a master nods who approves a</p>
<p>pupil's self-correction. 'Yes, that's better.'</p>
<p>How wonderful he was, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_386">thought</a> the woman at the window, how</p>
<p>wonderful it all was. This was the brain of the western world,</p>
<p>this was Olympus with the warring earth at its feet. And he was</p>
<p>guiding France, France so long a resentful exile from</p>
<p>imperialism, back to her old predominance.</p>
<p>It seemed to her beyond the desert of a woman that she should be</p>
<p>privileged to participate…</p>
<p>It is hard to be a woman, full of the stormy impulse to personal</p>
<p>devotion, and to have to be impersonal, abstract, exact,</p>
<p>punctual. She must control <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_387">herself</a>…</p>
<p>She gave <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_388">herself</a> up to fantastic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_389">dreams</a>, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_389">dreams</a> of the days when</p>
<p>the war would be over and victory enthroned. Then perhaps this</p>
<p>harshness, this armour would be put aside and the gods might</p>
<p>unbend. Her eyelids drooped…</p>
<p>She roused <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_390">herself</a> with a start. She became aware that the night</p>
<p>outside was no longer still. That there was an excitement down</p>
<p>below on the bridge and a running in the street and a flickering</p>
<p>of searchlights among the clouds from some high place away beyond</p>
<p>the Trocadero. And then the excitement came surging up past her</p>
<p>and invaded the hall within.</p>
<p>One of the sentinels from the terrace stood at the upper end of</p>
<p>the room, gesticulating and shouting something.</p>
<p>And all the world had changed. A kind of throbbing. She couldn't</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_391">understand</a>. It was as if all the water-pipes and concealed</p>
<p>machinery and cables of the ways beneath, were beating-as pulses</p>
<p>beat. And about her blew something like a wind-a wind that was</p>
<p>dismay.</p>
<p>Her eyes went to the face of the Marshal as a frightened child</p>
<p>might look towards its mother.</p>
<p>He was still serene. He was frowning slightly, she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_392">thought</a>, but</p>
<p>that was natural enough, for the Earl of Delhi, with one hand</p>
<p>gauntly gesticulating, had taken him by the arm and was all too</p>
<p>manifestly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_393">disposed</a> to drag him towards the great door that</p>
<p>opened on the terrace. And Viard was hurrying towards the huge</p>
<p>windows and doing so in the strangest of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_394">attitudes</a>, bent forward</p>
<p>and with eyes upturned.</p>
<p>Something up there?</p>
<p>And then it was as if thunder broke overhead.</p>
<p>The sound struck her like a blow. She crouched together against</p>
<p>the masonry and looked up. She <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_395">saw</a> three black shapes swooping</p>
<p>down through the torn clouds, and from a point a little below two</p>
<p>of them, there had already started curling trails of red…</p>
<p>Everything else in her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_396">being</a> was paralysed, she hung through</p>
<p>moments that seemed infinities, watching those red missiles whirl</p>
<p>down towards her.</p>
<p>She <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_397">felt</a> torn out of the world. There was nothing else in the</p>
<p>world but a crimson-purple glare and sound, deafening,</p>
<p>all-embracing, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_398">continuing</a> sound. Every other light had gone out</p>
<p>about her and against this glare hung slanting walls, pirouetting</p>
<p>pillars, projecting fragments of cornices, and a disorderly</p>
<p>flight of huge angular sheets of glass. She had an impression of</p>
<p>a great ball of crimson-purple fire like a maddened living thing</p>
<p>that seemed to be whirling about very rapidly amidst a chaos of</p>
<p>falling masonry, that seemed to be attacking the earth furiously,</p>
<p>that seemed to be burrowing into it like a blazing rabbit…</p>
<p>She had all the sensations of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_399">waking</a> up out of a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_400">dream</a>.</p>
<p>She found she was lying face downward on a bank of mould and that</p>
<p>a little rivulet of hot water was running over one foot. She</p>
<p>tried to raise <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_401">herself</a> and found her leg was very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_402">painful</a>. She</p>
<p>was not clear whether it was night or day nor where she was; she</p>
<p>made a second effort, wincing and groaning, and turned over and</p>
<p>got into a sitting position and looked about her.</p>
<p>Everything seemed very silent. She was, in fact, in the midst of</p>
<p>a vast uproar, but she did not realise this because her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_403">hearing</a></p>
<p>had been destroyed.</p>
<p>At first she could not join on what she <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_404">saw</a> to any previous</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_405">experience</a>.</p>
<p>She seemed to be in a strange world, a soundless, ruinous world,</p>
<p>a world of heaped broken things. And it was lit-and somehow</p>
<p>this was more familiar to her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_406">mind</a> than any other fact about</p>
<p>her-by a flickering, purplish-crimson light. Then close to her,</p>
<p>rising above a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_407">confusion</a> of debris, she recognised the Trocadero;</p>
<p>it was changed, something had gone from it, but its outline was</p>
<p>unmistakable. It stood out against a streaming, whirling uprush</p>
<p>of red-lit steam. And with that she recalled Paris and the Seine</p>
<p>and the warm, overcast evening and the beautiful, luminous</p>
<p>organisation of the War Control…</p>
<p>She drew <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_408">herself</a> a little way up the slope of earth on which she</p>
<p>lay, and examined her surroundings with an increasing</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_409">understanding</a>…</p>
<p>The earth on which she was lying projected like a cape into the</p>
<p>river. Quite close to her was a brimming lake of dammed-up water,</p>
<p>from which these warm rivulets and torrents were trickling. Wisps</p>
<p>of vapour came into circling <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_410">existence</a> a foot or so from its</p>
<p>mirror-surface. Near at hand and reflected exactly in the water</p>
<p>was the upper part of a familiar-looking stone pillar. On the</p>
<p>side of her away from the water the heaped ruins rose steeply in</p>
<p>a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_411">confused</a> slope up to a glaring crest. Above and reflecting</p>
<p>this glare towered pillowed masses of steam rolling swiftly</p>
<p>upward to the zenith. It was from this crest that the livid glow</p>
<p>that lit the world about her proceeded, and slowly her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_412">mind</a></p>
<p>connected this mound with the vanished buildings of the War</p>
<p>Control.</p>
<p>'Mais!' she whispered, and remained with staring eyes quite</p>
<p>motionless for a time, crouching close to the warm earth.</p>
<p>Then presently this dim, broken human thing began to look about</p>
<p>it again. She began to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_413">feel</a> the need of fellowship. She wanted</p>
<p>to question, wanted to speak, wanted to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_414">relate</a> her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_415">experience</a>.</p>
<p>And her foot hurt her atrociously. There ought to be an</p>
<p>ambulance. A little gust of querulous criticisms blew across her</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_416">mind</a>. This surely was a disaster! Always after a disaster there</p>
<p>should be ambulances and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_417">helpers</a> moving about…</p>
<p>She craned her head. There was something there. But everything</p>
<p>was so still!</p>
<p>'Monsieur!' she cried. Her ears, she noted, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_418">felt</a> queer, and she</p>
<p>began to suspect that all was not well with them.</p>
<p>It was terribly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_419">lonely</a> in this chaotic strangeness, and perhaps</p>
<p>this man-if it was a man, for it was difficult to see-might for</p>
<p>all his stillness be merely insensible. He might have been</p>
<p>stunned…</p>
<p>The leaping glare beyond sent a ray into his corner and for a</p>
<p>moment every little detail was distinct. It was Marshal Dubois.</p>
<p>He was lying against a huge slab of the war map. To it there</p>
<p>stuck and from it there dangled little wooden <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_420">objects</a>, the</p>
<p>symbols of infantry and cavalry and guns, as they were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_421">disposed</a></p>
<p>upon the frontier. He did not seem to be aware of this at his</p>
<p>back, he had an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_422">effect</a> of inattention, not indifferent attention,</p>
<p>but as if he were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_423">thinking</a>…</p>
<p>She could not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_424">see</a> the eyes beneath his shaggy brows, but it was</p>
<p>evident he frowned. He frowned slightly, he had an air of not</p>
<p>wanting to be disturbed. His face still bore that expression of</p>
<p>assured confidence, that conviction that if things were left to</p>
<p>him France might obey in security…</p>
<p>She did not cry out to him again, but she crept a little nearer.</p>
<p>A strange surmise made her eyes dilate. With a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_425">painful</a> wrench</p>
<p>she pulled <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_426">herself</a> up so that she could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_427">see</a> completely over the</p>
<p>intervening lumps of smashed-up masonry. Her hand <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_428">touched</a></p>
<p>something wet, and after one convulsive movement she became</p>
<p>rigid.</p>
<p>It was not a whole man there; it was a piece of a man, the head</p>
<p>and shoulders of a man that trailed down into a ragged darkness</p>
<p>and a pool of shining black…</p>
<p>And even as she stared the mound above her swayed and crumbled,</p>
<p>and a rush of hot water came pouring over her. Then it seemed to</p>
<p>her that she was dragged downward…</p>
<p>Section 3</p>
<p>When the rather brutish young aviator with the bullet head and</p>
<p>the black hair close-cropped en brosse, who was in charge of the</p>
<p>French special scientific corps, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_429">heard</a> presently of this disaster</p>
<p>to the War Control, he was so wanting in imagination in any</p>
<p>sphere but his own, that he laughed. Small matter to him that</p>
<p>Paris was burning. His mother and father and sister lived at</p>
<p>Caudebec; and the only sweetheart he had ever had, and it was</p>
<p>poor love-making then, was a girl in Rouen. He slapped his</p>
<p>second-in-command on the shoulder. 'Now,' he said, 'there's</p>
<p>nothing on earth to stop us going to Berlin and giving them</p>
<p>tit-for-tat… Strategy and reasons of state-they're over…</p>
<p>Come along, my boy, and we'll just show these old women what we</p>
<p>can do when they let us have our heads.'</p>
<p>He spent five minutes telephoning and then he went out into the</p>
<p>courtyard of the chateau in which he had been installed and</p>
<p>shouted for his automobile. Things would have to move quickly</p>
<p>because there was scarcely an hour and a half before dawn. He</p>
<p>looked at the sky and noted with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_430">satisfaction</a> a heavy bank of</p>
<p>clouds athwart the pallid east.</p>
<p>He was a young man of infinite shrewdness, and his material and</p>
<p>aeroplanes were scattered all over the country-side, stuck away</p>
<p>in barns, covered with hay, hidden in woods. A hawk could not</p>
<p>have discovered any of them without coming within reach of a gun.</p>
<p>But that night he only wanted one of the machines, and it was</p>
<p>handy and quite prepared under a tarpaulin between two ricks not</p>
<p>a couple of miles away; he was going to Berlin with that and just</p>
<p>one other man. Two men would be enough for what he meant to</p>
<p>do…</p>
<p>He had in his hands the black complement to all those other gifts</p>
<p>science was urging upon unregenerate mankind, the gift of</p>
<p>destruction, and he was an adventurous rather than a sympathetic</p>
<p>type…</p>
<p>He was a dark young man with something negroid about his gleaming</p>
<p>face. He smiled like one who is favoured and anticipates great</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_431">pleasures</a>. There was an exotic richness, a chuckling flavour,</p>
<p>about the voice in which he gave his orders, and he pointed his</p>
<p>remarks with the long finger of a hand that was hairy and</p>
<p>exceptionally big.</p>
<p>'We'll give them tit-for-tat,' he said. 'We'll give them</p>
<p>tit-for-tat. No time to lose, boys…'</p>
<p>And presently over the cloud-banks that lay above Westphalia and</p>
<p>Saxony the swift aeroplane, with its atomic engine as noiseless</p>
<p>as a dancing sunbeam and its phosphorescent gyroscopic compass,</p>
<p>flew like an arrow to the heart of the Central European hosts.</p>
<p>It did not soar very high; it skimmed a few hundred feet above</p>
<p>the banked darknesses of cumulus that hid the world, ready to</p>
<p>plunge at once into their wet obscurities should some hostile</p>
<p>flier range into vision. The tense young steersman divided his</p>
<p>attention between the guiding stars above and the level, tumbled</p>
<p>surfaces of the vapour strata that hid the world below. Over</p>
<p>great spaces those banks lay as even as a frozen lava-flow and</p>
<p>almost as still, and then they were rent by ragged areas of</p>
<p>translucency, pierced by clear chasms, so that dim patches of the</p>
<p>land below gleamed remotely through abysses. Once he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_432">saw</a> quite</p>
<p>distinctly the plan of a big railway station outlined in lamps</p>
<p>and signals, and once the flames of a burning rick showing livid</p>
<p>through a boiling drift of smoke on the side of some great hill.</p>
<p>But if the world was masked it was alive with sounds. Up through</p>
<p>that vapour floor came the deep roar of trains, the whistles of</p>
<p>horns of motor-cars, a sound of rifle fire away to the south, and</p>
<p>as he drew near his destination the crowing of cocks…</p>
<p>The sky above the indistinct horizons of this cloud sea was at</p>
<p>first starry and then paler with a light that crept from north to</p>
<p>east as the dawn came on. The Milky Way was invisible in the</p>
<p>blue, and the lesser stars vanished. The face of the adventurer</p>
<p>at the steering-wheel, darkly visible ever and again by the oval</p>
<p>greenish glow of the compass face, had something of that firm</p>
<p>beauty which all concentrated purpose gives, and something of the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_433">happiness</a> of an idiot child that has at last got hold of the</p>
<p>matches. His companion, a less imaginative type, sat with his</p>
<p>legs spread wide over the long, coffin-shaped box which contained</p>
<p>in its compartments the three atomic bombs, the new bombs that</p>
<p>would <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_434">continue</a> to explode indefinitely and which no one so far</p>
<p>had ever <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_435">seen</a> in action. Hitherto Carolinum, their essential</p>
<p>substance, had been tested only in almost infinitesimal</p>
<p>quantities within steel chambers embedded in lead. Beyond the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_436">thought</a> of great destruction slumbering in the black spheres</p>
<p>between his legs, and a keen resolve to follow out very exactly</p>
<p>the instructions that had been given him, the man's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_437">mind</a> was a</p>
<p>blank. His aquiline profile against the starlight expressed</p>
<p>nothing but a profound gloom.</p>
<p>The sky below <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_438">grew</a> clearer as the Central European capital was</p>
<p>approached.</p>
<p>So far they had been singularly lucky and had been challenged by</p>
<p>no aeroplanes at all. The frontier scouts they must have passed</p>
<p>in the night; probably these were mostly under the clouds; the</p>
<p>world was wide and they had had luck in not coming close to any</p>
<p>soaring sentinel. Their machine was painted a pale gray, that</p>
<p>lay almost invisibly over the cloud levels below. But now the</p>
<p>east was flushing with the near ascent of the sun, Berlin was but</p>
<p>a score of miles ahead, and the luck of the Frenchmen held. By</p>
<p>imperceptible degrees the clouds below dissolved…</p>
<p>Away to the north-eastward, in a cloudless pool of gathering</p>
<p>light and with all its nocturnal illuminations still blazing, was</p>
<p>Berlin. The left finger of the steersman verified roads and open</p>
<p>spaces below upon the mica-covered square of map that was</p>
<p>fastened by his wheel. There in a series of lake-like expansions</p>
<p>was the Havel away to the right; over by those forests must be</p>
<p>Spandau; there the river split about the Potsdam island; and</p>
<p>right ahead was Charlottenburg cleft by a great thoroughfare that</p>
<p>fell like an indicating beam of light straight to the imperial</p>
<p>headquarters. There, plain enough, was the Thiergarten; beyond</p>
<p>rose the imperial palace, and to the right those tall buildings,</p>
<p>those clustering, beflagged, bemasted roofs, must be the offices</p>
<p>in which the Central European staff was housed. It was all coldly</p>
<p>clear and colourless in the dawn.</p>
<p>He looked up suddenly as a humming sound <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_439">grew</a> out of nothing and</p>
<p>became swiftly louder. Nearly overhead a German aeroplane was</p>
<p>circling down from an immense height to challenge him. He made a</p>
<p>gesture with his left arm to the gloomy man behind and then</p>
<p>gripped his little wheel with both hands, crouched over it, and</p>
<p>twisted his neck to look upward. He was attentive, tightly</p>
<p>strung, but quite contemptuous of their ability to hurt him. No</p>
<p>German alive, he was assured, could outfly him, or indeed any one</p>
<p>of the best Frenchmen. He imagined they might strike at him as a</p>
<p>hawk strikes, but they were men coming down out of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_440">bitter</a></p>
<p>cold up there, in a hungry, spiritless, morning mood; they came</p>
<p>slanting down like a sword swung by a lazy man, and not so</p>
<p>rapidly but that he was able to slip away from under them and get</p>
<p>between them and Berlin. They began challenging him in German</p>
<p>with a megaphone when they were still perhaps a mile away. The</p>
<p>words came to him, rolled up into a mere blob of hoarse sound.</p>
<p>Then, gathering alarm from his grim silence, they gave chase and</p>
<p>swept down, a hundred yards above him perhaps, and a couple of</p>
<p>hundred behind. They were beginning to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_441">understand</a> what he was.</p>
<p>He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_442">ceased</a> to watch them and concentrated <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_443">himself</a> on the city</p>
<p>ahead, and for a time the two aeroplanes raced…</p>
<p>A bullet came tearing through the air by him, as though some one</p>
<p>was tearing paper. A second followed. Something tapped the</p>
<p>machine.</p>
<p>It was time to act. The broad avenues, the park, the palaces</p>
<p>below rushed widening out nearer and nearer to them. 'Ready!'</p>
<p>said the steersman.</p>
<p>The gaunt face hardened to grimness, and with both hands the</p>
<p>bomb-thrower lifted the big atomic bomb from the box and steadied</p>
<p>it against the side. It was a black sphere two feet in diameter.</p>
<p>Between its handles was a little celluloid stud, and to this he</p>
<p>bent his head until his lips <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_444">touched</a> it. Then he had to bite in</p>
<p>order to let the air in upon the inducive. Sure of its</p>
<p>accessibility, he craned his neck over the side of the aeroplane</p>
<p>and judged his pace and distance. Then very quickly he bent</p>
<p>forward, bit the stud, and hoisted the bomb over the side.</p>
<p>'Round,' he whispered inaudibly.</p>
<p>The bomb flashed blinding scarlet in mid-air, and fell, a</p>
<p>descending column of blaze eddying spirally in the midst of a</p>
<p>whirlwind. Both the aeroplanes were tossed like shuttlecocks,</p>
<p>hurled high and sideways and the steersman, with gleaming eyes</p>
<p>and set teeth, fought in great banking curves for a balance. The</p>
<p>gaunt man clung tight with hand and knees; his nostrils dilated,</p>
<p>his teeth biting his lips. He was firmly strapped…</p>
<p>When he could look down again it was like looking down upon the</p>
<p>crater of a small volcano. In the open garden before the</p>
<p>Imperial castle a shuddering star of evil splendour spurted and</p>
<p>poured up smoke and flame towards them like an accusation. They</p>
<p>were too high to distinguish people clearly, or mark the bomb's</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_445">effect</a> upon the building until suddenly the facade tottered and</p>
<p>crumbled before the flare as sugar dissolves in water. The man</p>
<p>stared for a moment, showed all his long teeth, and then</p>
<p>staggered into the cramped standing position his straps</p>
<p>permitted, hoisted out and bit another bomb, and sent it down</p>
<p>after its fellow.</p>
<p>The explosion came this time more directly underneath the</p>
<p>aeroplane and shot it upward edgeways. The bomb box tipped to</p>
<p>the point of disgorgement, and the bomb-thrower was pitched</p>
<p>forward upon the third bomb with his face close to its celluloid</p>
<p>stud. He clutched its handles, and with a sudden gust of</p>
<p>determination that the thing should not escape him, bit its stud.</p>
<p>Before he could hurl it over, the monoplane was slipping</p>
<p>sideways. Everything was falling sideways. Instinctively he gave</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_446">himself</a> up to gripping, his body holding the bomb in its place.</p>
<p>Then that bomb had exploded also, and steersman, thrower, and</p>
<p>aeroplane were just flying rags and splinters of metal and drops</p>
<p>of moisture in the air, and a third column of fire rushed eddying</p>
<p>down upon the doomed buildings below…</p>
<p>Section 4</p>
<p>Never before in the history of warfare had there been a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_447">continuing</a> explosive; indeed, up to the middle of the twentieth</p>
<p>century the only explosives <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_448">known</a> were combustibles whose</p>
<p>explosiveness was due entirely to their instantaneousness; and</p>
<p>these atomic bombs which science burst upon the world that night</p>
<p>were strange even to the men who used them. Those used by the</p>
<p>Allies were lumps of pure Carolinum, painted on the outside with</p>
<p>unoxidised cydonator inducive enclosed hermetically in a case of</p>
<p>membranium. A little celluloid stud between the handles by which</p>
<p>the bomb was lifted was arranged so as to be easily torn off and</p>
<p>admit air to the inducive, which at once became active and set up</p>
<p>radio-activity in the outer layer of the Carolinum sphere. This</p>
<p>liberated fresh inducive, and so in a few minutes the whole bomb</p>
<p>was a blazing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_449">continual</a> explosion. The Central European bombs</p>
<p>were the same, except that they were larger and had a more</p>
<p>complicated arrangement for animating the inducive.</p>
<p>Always before in the development of warfare the shells and</p>
<p>rockets fired had been but momentarily explosive, they had gone</p>
<p>off in an instant once for all, and if there was nothing living</p>
<p>or valuable within reach of the concussion and the flying</p>
<p>fragments then they were spent and over. But Carolinum, which</p>
<p>belonged to the beta group of Hyslop's so-called 'suspended</p>
<p>degenerator' elements, once its degenerative process had been</p>
<p>induced, continued a furious radiation of energy and nothing</p>
<p>could arrest it. Of all Hyslop's artificial elements, Carolinum</p>
<p>was the most heavily stored with energy and the most dangerous to</p>
<p>make and handle. To this day it remains the most potent</p>
<p>degenerator <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_450">known</a>. What the earlier twentieth-century chemists</p>
<p>called its half period was seventeen days; that is to say, it</p>
<p>poured out half of the huge store of energy in its great</p>
<p>molecules in the space of seventeen days, the next seventeen</p>
<p>days' emission was a half of that first period's outpouring, and</p>
<p>so on. As with all radio-active substances this Carolinum,</p>
<p>though every seventeen days its power is halved, though</p>
<p>constantly it diminishes towards the imperceptible, is never</p>
<p>entirely exhausted, and to this day the battle-fields and bomb</p>
<p>fields of that frantic time in human history are sprinkled with</p>
<p>radiant matter, and so centres of inconvenient rays.</p>
<p>What happened when the celluloid stud was opened was that the</p>
<p>inducive oxidised and became active. Then the surface of the</p>
<p>Carolinum began to degenerate. This degeneration passed only</p>
<p>slowly into the substance of the bomb. A moment or so after its</p>
<p>explosion began it was still mainly an inert sphere exploding</p>
<p>superficially, a big, inanimate nucleus wrapped in flame and</p>
<p>thunder. Those that were thrown from aeroplanes fell in this</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_451">state</a>, they reached the ground still mainly solid, and, melting</p>
<p>soil and rock in their progress, bored into the earth. There, as</p>
<p>more and more of the Carolinum became active, the bomb spread</p>
<p>itself out into a monstrous cavern of fiery energy at the base of</p>
<p>what became very speedily a miniature active volcano. The</p>
<p>Carolinum, unable to disperse, freely drove into and mixed up</p>
<p>with a boiling <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_452">confusion</a> of molten soil and superheated steam,</p>
<p>and so remained spinning furiously and maintaining an eruption</p>
<p>that lasted for years or months or weeks according to the size of</p>
<p>the bomb employed and the chances of its dispersal. Once</p>
<p>launched, the bomb was absolutely unapproachable and</p>
<p>uncontrollable until its forces were nearly exhausted, and from</p>
<p>the crater that burst open above it, puffs of heavy incandescent</p>
<p>vapour and fragments of viciously punitive rock and mud,</p>
<p>saturated with Carolinum, and each a centre of scorching and</p>
<p>blistering energy, were flung high and far.</p>
<p>Such was the crowning triumph of military science, the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_453">ultimate</a></p>
<p>explosive that was to give the 'decisive touch' to war…</p>
<p>Section 5</p>
<p>A recent historical writer has described the world of that time</p>
<p>as one that 'believed in established words and was invincibly</p>
<p>blind to the obvious in things.' Certainly it seems now that</p>
<p>nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earlier</p>
<p>twentieth century than the rapidity with which war was becoming</p>
<p>impossible. And as certainly they did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_454">see</a> it. They did not</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_454">see</a> it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands. Yet</p>
<p>the broad facts must have glared upon any intelligent <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_455">mind</a>. All</p>
<p>through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the amount of</p>
<p>energy that men were able to command was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_456">continually</a> increasing.</p>
<p>Applied to warfare that meant that the power to inflict a blow,</p>
<p>the power to destroy, was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_456">continually</a> increasing. There was no</p>
<p>increase whatever in the ability to escape. Every sort of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_457">passive</a> defence, armour, fortifications, and so forth, was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_458">being</a></p>
<p>outmastered by this tremendous increase on the destructive side.</p>
<p>Destruction was becoming so facile that any little body of</p>
<p>malcontents could use it; it was revolutionising the problems of</p>
<p>police and internal rule. Before the last war began it was a</p>
<p>matter of common <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_459">knowledge</a> that a man could carry about in a</p>
<p>handbag an amount of latent energy sufficient to wreck half a</p>
<p>city. These facts were before the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_455">minds</a> of everybody; the</p>
<p>children in the streets <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_460">knew</a> them. And yet the world still, as</p>
<p>the Americans used to phrase it, 'fooled around' with the</p>
<p>paraphernalia and pretensions of war.</p>
<p>It is only by realising this profound, this fantastic divorce</p>
<p>between the scientific and intellectual movement on the one hand,</p>
<p>and the world of the lawyer-politician on the other, that the men</p>
<p>of a later time can hope to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_461">understand</a> this preposterous <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_462">state</a> of</p>
<p>affairs. Social organisation was still in the barbaric stage.</p>
<p>There were already great numbers of actively intelligent men and</p>
<p>much private and commercial civilisation, but the community, as a</p>
<p>whole, was aimless, untrained and unorganised to the pitch of</p>
<p>imbecility. Collective civilisation, the 'Modern State,' was</p>
<p>still in the womb of the future…</p>
<p>Section 6</p>
<p>But let us return to Frederick Barnet's Wander Jahre and its</p>
<p>account of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_463">experiences</a> of a common man during the war time.</p>
<p>While these terrific disclosures of scientific possibility were</p>
<p>happening in Paris and Berlin, Barnet and his company were</p>
<p>industriously entrenching <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_464">themselves</a> in Belgian Luxembourg.</p>
<p>He tells of the mobilisation and of his summer day's journey</p>
<p>through the north of France and the Ardennes in a few vivid</p>
<p>phrases. The country was browned by a warm summer, the trees a</p>
<p>little <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_465">touched</a> with autumnal colour, and the wheat already</p>
<p>golden. When they stopped for an hour at Hirson, men and women</p>
<p>with tricolour badges upon the platform distributed cakes and</p>
<p>glasses of beer to the thirsty soldiers, and there was much</p>
<p>cheerfulness. 'Such <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_466">good</a>, cool beer it was,' he wrote. 'I had</p>
<p>had nothing to eat nor drink since Epsom.'</p>
<p>A number of monoplanes, 'like giant swallows,' he notes, were</p>
<p>scouting in the pink evening sky.</p>
<p>Barnet's battalion was sent through the Sedan country to a place</p>
<p>called Virton, and thence to a point in the woods on the line to</p>
<p>Jemelle. Here they detrained, bivouacked uneasily by the</p>
<p>railway-trains and stores were passing along it all night-and</p>
<p>next morning he: marched eastward through a cold, overcast dawn,</p>
<p>and a morning, first cloudy and then blazing, over a large</p>
<p>spacious country-side interspersed by forest towards Arlon.</p>
<p>There the infantry were set to work upon a line of masked</p>
<p>entrenchments and hidden rifle pits between St Hubert and Virton</p>
<p>that were designed to check and delay any advance from the east</p>
<p>upon the fortified line of the Meuse. They had their orders, and</p>
<p>for two days they worked without either a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_467">sight</a> of the enemy or</p>
<p>any suspicion of the disaster that had abruptly decapitated the</p>
<p>armies of Europe, and turned the west of Paris and the centre of</p>
<p>Berlin into blazing miniatures of the destruction of Pompeii.</p>
<p>And the news, when it did come, came attenuated. 'We <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_468">heard</a> there</p>
<p>had been mischief with aeroplanes and bombs in Paris,' Barnet</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_469">relates</a>; 'but it didn't seem to follow that "They" weren't still</p>
<p>somewhere elaborating their plans and issuing orders. When the</p>
<p>enemy began to emerge from the woods in front of us, we cheered</p>
<p>and blazed away, and didn't trouble much more about anything but</p>
<p>the battle in hand. If now and then one cocked up an eye into the</p>
<p>sky to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_470">see</a> what was happening there, the rip of a bullet soon</p>
<p>brought one down to the horizontal again…</p>
<p>That battle went on for three days all over a great stretch of</p>
<p>country between Louvain on the north and Longwy to the south. It</p>
<p>was essentially a rifle and infantry struggle. The aeroplanes do</p>
<p>not seem to have taken any decisive share in the actual fighting</p>
<p>for some days, though no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_471">doubt</a> they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_472">effected</a> the strategy from</p>
<p>the first by preventing surprise movements. They were aeroplanes</p>
<p>with atomic engines, but they were not provided with atomic</p>
<p>bombs, which were manifestly unsuitable for field use, nor indeed</p>
<p>had they any very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_473">effective</a> kind of bomb. And though they</p>
<p>manoeuvred against each other, and there was rifle shooting at</p>
<p>them and between them, there was little actual aerial fighting.</p>
<p>Either the airmen were indisposed to fight or the commanders on</p>
<p>both sides preferred to reserve these machines for scouting…</p>
<p>After a day or so of digging and scheming, Barnet found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_474">himself</a></p>
<p>in the forefront of a battle. He had made his section of rifle</p>
<p>pits chiefly along a line of deep dry ditch that gave a means of</p>
<p>inter-communication, he had had the earth scattered over the</p>
<p>adjacent field, and he had masked his preparations with tussocks</p>
<p>of corn and poppy. The hostile advance came blindly and</p>
<p>unsuspiciously across the fields below and would have been very</p>
<p>cruelly handled indeed, if some one away to the right had not</p>
<p>opened fire too soon.</p>
<p>'It was a queer thrill when these fellows came into <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_475">sight</a>,' he</p>
<p>confesses; 'and not a bit like manoeuvres. They halted for a</p>
<p>time on the edge of the wood and then came forward in an open</p>
<p>line. They kept walking nearer to us and not looking at us, but</p>
<p>away to the right of us. Even when they began to be hit, and</p>
<p>their officers' whistles <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_476">woke</a> them up, they didn't seem to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_477">see</a></p>
<p>us. One or two halted to fire, and then they all went back</p>
<p>towards the wood again. They went slowly at first, looking round</p>
<p>at us, then the shelter of the wood seemed to draw them, and they</p>
<p>trotted. I fired rather mechanically and missed, then I fired</p>
<p>again, and then I became earnest to hit something, made sure of</p>
<p>my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_478">sighting</a>, and aimed very carefully at a blue back that was</p>
<p>dodging about in the corn. At first I couldn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_479">satisfy</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_480">myself</a></p>
<p>and didn't shoot, his movements were so spasmodic and uncertain;</p>
<p>then I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_481">think</a> he came to a ditch or some such obstacle and halted</p>
<p>for a moment. "GOT you," I whispered, and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>'I had the strangest sensations about that man. In the first</p>
<p>instance, when I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_482">felt</a> that I had hit him I was irradiated with</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_483">joy</a> and pride…</p>
<p>'I sent him spinning. He jumped and threw up his arms…</p>
<p>'Then I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_484">saw</a> the corn tops waving and had glimpses of him flapping</p>
<p>about. Suddenly I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_485">felt</a> sick. I hadn't killed him…</p>
<p>'In some way he was disabled and smashed up and yet able to</p>
<p>struggle about. I began to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_486">think</a>…</p>
<p>'For nearly two hours that Prussian was agonising in the corn.</p>
<p>Either he was calling out or some one was shouting to him…</p>
<p>'Then he jumped up-he seemed to try to get up upon his feet with</p>
<p>one last effort; and then he fell like a sack and lay quite still</p>
<p>and never moved again.</p>
<p>'He had been unendurable, and I believe some one had shot him</p>
<p>dead. I had been wanting to do so for some time…'</p>
<p>The enemy began sniping the rifle pits from shelters they made</p>
<p>for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_487">themselves</a> in the woods below. A man was hit in the pit next</p>
<p>to Barnet, and began cursing and crying out in a violent rage.</p>
<p>Barnet crawled along the ditch to him and found him in great</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_488">pain</a>, covered with blood, frantic with indignation, and with the</p>
<p>half of his right hand smashed to a pulp. 'Look at this,' he</p>
<p>kept repeating, hugging it and then extending it. 'Damned</p>
<p>foolery! Damned foolery! My right hand, sir! My right hand!'</p>
<p>For some time Barnet could do nothing with him. The man was</p>
<p>consumed by his tortured realisation of the evil silliness of</p>
<p>war, the realisation which had come upon him in a flash with the</p>
<p>bullet that had destroyed his skill and use as an artificer for</p>
<p>ever. He was looking at the vestiges with a horror that made him</p>
<p>impenetrable to any other idea. At last the poor wretch let</p>
<p>Barnet tie up his bleeding stump and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_489">help</a> him along the ditch</p>
<p>that conducted him deviously out of range…</p>
<p>When Barnet returned his men were already calling out for water,</p>
<p>and all day long the line of pits suffered greatly from thirst.</p>
<p>For food they had chocolate and bread.</p>
<p>'At first,' he says, 'I was extraordinarily excited by my baptism</p>
<p>of fire. Then as the heat of the day came on I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_490">experienced</a> an</p>
<p>enormous tedium and discomfort. The flies became extremely</p>
<p>troublesome, and my little grave of a rifle pit was invaded by</p>
<p>ants. I could not get up or move about, for some one in the trees</p>
<p>had got a mark on me. I kept <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_491">thinking</a> of the dead Prussian down</p>
<p>among the corn, and of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_492">bitter</a> outcries of my own man. Damned</p>
<p>foolery! It WAS damned foolery. But who was to blame? How had</p>
<p>we got to this?…</p>
<p>'Early in the afternoon an aeroplane tried to dislodge us with</p>
<p>dynamite bombs, but she was hit by bullets once or twice, and</p>
<p>suddenly dived down over beyond the trees.</p>
<p>' "From Holland to the Alps this day," I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_493">thought</a>, "there must be</p>
<p>crouching and lying between half and a million of men, trying to</p>
<p>inflict irreparable damage upon one another. The thing is idiotic</p>
<p>to the pitch of impossibility. It is a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_494">dream</a>. Presently I shall</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_495">wake</a> up."…</p>
<p>'Then the phrase changed itself in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_496">mind</a>. "Presently mankind</p>
<p>will <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_497">wake</a> up."</p>
<p>'I lay speculating just how many thousands of men there were</p>
<p>among these hundreds of thousands, whose <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_498">spirits</a> were in</p>
<p>rebellion against all these ancient traditions of flag and</p>
<p>empire. Weren't we, perhaps, already in the throes of the last</p>
<p>crisis, in that darkest moment of a nightmare's horror before the</p>
<p>sleeper will endure no more of it-and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_499">wakes</a>?</p>
<p>'I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_500">know</a> how my speculations ended. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_501">think</a> they were not</p>
<p>so much ended as distracted by the distant thudding of the guns</p>
<p>that were opening fire at long range upon Namur.'</p>
<p>Section 7</p>
<p>But as yet Barnet had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_502">seen</a> no more than the mildest beginnings of</p>
<p>modern warfare. So far he had taken part only in a little</p>
<p>shooting. The bayonet attack by which the advanced line was</p>
<p>broken was made at a place called Croix Rouge, more than twenty</p>
<p>miles away, and that night under cover of the darkness the rifle</p>
<p>pits were abandoned and he got his company away without further</p>
<p>loss.</p>
<p>His regiment fell back unpressed behind the fortified lines</p>
<p>between Namur and Sedan, entrained at a station called Mettet,</p>
<p>and was sent northward by Antwerp and Rotterdam to Haarlem.</p>
<p>Hence they marched into North Holland. It was only after the</p>
<p>march into Holland that he began to realise the monstrous and</p>
<p>catastrophic nature of the struggle in which he was playing his</p>
<p>undistinguished part.</p>
<p>He describes very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_503">pleasantly</a> the journey through the hills and</p>
<p>open land of Brabant, the repeated crossing of arms of the Rhine,</p>
<p>and the change from the undulating scenery of Belgium to the</p>
<p>flat, rich meadows, the sunlit dyke roads, and the countless</p>
<p>windmills of the Dutch levels. In those days there was unbroken</p>
<p>land from Alkmaar and Leiden to the Dollart. Three great</p>
<p>provinces, South Holland, North Holland, and Zuiderzeeland,</p>
<p>reclaimed at various times between the early tenth century and</p>
<p>1945 and all many feet below the level of the waves outside the</p>
<p>dykes, spread out their lush polders to the northern sun and</p>
<p>sustained a dense industrious population. An intricate web of</p>
<p>laws and custom and tradition ensured a perpetual vigilance and a</p>
<p>perpetual defence against the beleaguering sea. For more than two</p>
<p>hundred and fifty miles from Walcheren to Friesland stretched a</p>
<p>line of embankments and pumping stations that was the admiration</p>
<p>of the world.</p>
<p>If some curious god had chosen to watch the course of events in</p>
<p>those northern provinces while that flanking march of the British</p>
<p>was in progress, he would have found a convenient and appropriate</p>
<p>seat for his observation upon one of the great cumulus clouds</p>
<p>that were drifting slowly across the blue sky during all these</p>
<p>eventful days before the great catastrophe. For that was the</p>
<p>quality of the weather, hot and clear, with something of a</p>
<p>breeze, and underfoot dry and a little inclined to be dusty. This</p>
<p>watching god would have looked down upon broad stretches of</p>
<p>sunlit green, sunlit save for the creeping patches of shadow cast</p>
<p>by the clouds, upon sky-reflecting meres, fringed and divided up</p>
<p>by masses of willow and large areas of silvery weeds, upon white</p>
<p>roads lying bare to the sun and upon a tracery of blue canals.</p>
<p>The pastures were alive with cattle, the roads had a busy</p>
<p>traffic, of beasts and bicycles and gaily coloured peasants'</p>
<p>automobiles, the hues of the innumerable motor barges in the</p>
<p>canal vied with the eventfulness of the roadways; and everywhere</p>
<p>in solitary steadings, amidst ricks and barns, in groups by the</p>
<p>wayside, in straggling villages, each with its fine old church,</p>
<p>or in compact towns laced with canals and abounding in bridges</p>
<p>and clipped trees, were human habitations.</p>
<p>The people of this country-side were not belligerents. The</p>
<p>interests and sympathies alike of Holland had been so divided</p>
<p>that to the end she remained undecided and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_504">passive</a> in the</p>
<p>struggle of the world powers. And everywhere along the roads</p>
<p>taken by the marching armies clustered groups and crowds of</p>
<p>impartially observant spectators, women and children in peculiar</p>
<p>white caps and old-fashioned sabots, and elderly, clean-shaven</p>
<p>men <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_505">quietly</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_506">thoughtful</a> over their long pipes. They had no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_507">fear</a> of</p>
<p>their invaders; the days when 'soldiering' meant bands of</p>
<p>licentious looters had long since passed away…</p>
<p>That watcher among the clouds would have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_508">seen</a> a great</p>
<p>distribution of khaki-uniformed men and khaki-painted material</p>
<p>over the whole of the sunken area of Holland. He would have</p>
<p>marked the long trains, packed with men or piled with great guns</p>
<p>and war material, creeping slowly, alert for train-wreckers,</p>
<p>along the north-going lines; he would have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_508">seen</a> the Scheldt and</p>
<p>Rhine choked with shipping, and pouring out still more men and</p>
<p>still more material; he would have noticed halts and</p>
<p>provisionings and detrainments, and the long, bustling</p>
<p>caterpillars of cavalry and infantry, the maggot-like wagons, the</p>
<p>huge beetles of great guns, crawling under the poplars along the</p>
<p>dykes and roads northward, along ways lined by the neutral,</p>
<p>unmolested, ambiguously observant Dutch. All the barges and</p>
<p>shipping upon the canals had been requisitioned for transport. In</p>
<p>that clear, bright, warm weather, it would all have looked from</p>
<p>above like some extravagant festival of animated toys.</p>
<p>As the sun sank westward the spectacle must have become a little</p>
<p>indistinct because of a golden haze; everything must have become</p>
<p>warmer and more glowing, and because of the lengthening of the</p>
<p>shadows more manifestly in relief. The shadows of the tall</p>
<p>churches <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_509">grew</a> longer and longer, until they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_510">touched</a> the horizon</p>
<p>and mingled in the universal shadow; and then, slow, and soft,</p>
<p>and wrapping the world in fold after fold of deepening blue, came</p>
<p>the night-the night at first obscurely simple, and then with</p>
<p>faint points here and there, and then jewelled in darkling</p>
<p>splendour with a hundred thousand lights. Out of that mingling of</p>
<p>darkness and ambiguous glares the noise of an unceasing activity</p>
<p>would have arisen, the louder and plainer now because there was</p>
<p>no longer any distraction of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_511">sight</a>.</p>
<p>It may be that watcher drifting in the pellucid gulf beneath the</p>
<p>stars watched all through the night; it may be that he dozed. But</p>
<p>if he gave way to so natural a proclivity, assuredly on the</p>
<p>fourth night of the great flank march he was aroused, for that</p>
<p>was the night of the battle in the air that decided the fate of</p>
<p>Holland. The aeroplanes were fighting at last, and suddenly</p>
<p>about him, above and below, with cries and uproar rushing out of</p>
<p>the four quarters of heaven, striking, plunging, oversetting,</p>
<p>soaring to the zenith and dropping to the ground, they came to</p>
<p>assail or defend the myriads below.</p>
<p>Secretly the Central European power had gathered his flying</p>
<p>machines together, and now he threw them as a giant might fling a</p>
<p>handful of ten thousand knives over the low country. And amidst</p>
<p>that swarming flight were five that drove headlong for the sea</p>
<p>walls of Holland, carrying atomic bombs. From north and west and</p>
<p>south, the allied aeroplanes rose in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_512">response</a> and swept down upon</p>
<p>this sudden attack. So it was that war in the air began. Men</p>
<p>rode upon the whirlwind that night and slew and fell like</p>
<p>archangels. The sky rained heroes upon the astonished earth.</p>
<p>Surely the last fights of mankind were the best. What was the</p>
<p>heavy pounding of your Homeric swordsmen, what was the creaking</p>
<p>charge of chariots, beside this swift rush, this crash, this</p>
<p>giddy triumph, this headlong swoop to death?</p>
<p>And then athwart this whirling rush of aerial duels that swooped</p>
<p>and locked and dropped in the void between the lamp-lights and</p>
<p>the stars, came a great wind and a crash louder than thunder, and</p>
<p>first one and then a score of lengthening fiery serpents plunged</p>
<p>hungrily down upon the Dutchmen's dykes and struck between land</p>
<p>and sea and flared up again in enormous columns of glare and</p>
<p>crimsoned smoke and steam.</p>
<p>And out of the darkness leapt the little land, with its spires</p>
<p>and trees, aghast with terror, still and distinct, and the sea,</p>
<p>tumbled with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_513">anger</a>, red-foaming like a sea of blood…</p>
<p>Over the populous country below went a strange multitudinous</p>
<p>crying and a flurry of alarm bells…</p>
<p>The surviving aeroplanes turned about and fled out of the sky,</p>
<p>like things that suddenly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_514">know</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_515">themselves</a> to be wicked…</p>
<p>Through a dozen thunderously flaming gaps that no water might</p>
<p>quench, the waves came roaring in upon the land…</p>
<p>Section 8</p>
<p>'We had cursed our luck,' says Barnet, 'that we could not get to</p>
<p>our quarters at Alkmaar that night. There, we were told, were</p>
<p>provisions, tobacco, and everything for which we craved. But the</p>
<p>main canal from Zaandam and Amsterdam was hopelessly jammed with</p>
<p>craft, and we were glad of a chance opening that enabled us to</p>
<p>get out of the main column and lie up in a kind of little harbour</p>
<p>very much neglected and weedgrown before a deserted house. We</p>
<p>broke into this and found some herrings in a barrel, a heap of</p>
<p>cheeses, and stone bottles of gin in the cellar; and with this I</p>
<p>cheered my starving men. We made fires and toasted the cheese and</p>
<p>grilled our herrings. None of us had slept for nearly forty</p>
<p>hours, and I determined to stay in this refuge until dawn and</p>
<p>then if the traffic was still choked leave the barge and march</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_516">rest</a> of the way into Alkmaar.</p>
<p>'This place we had got into was perhaps a hundred yards from the</p>
<p>canal and underneath a little brick bridge we could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_517">see</a> the</p>
<p>flotilla still, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_518">hear</a> the voices of the soldiers. Presently</p>
<p>five or six other barges came through and lay up in the meer near</p>
<p>by us, and with two of these, full of men of the Antrim regiment,</p>
<p>I shared my find of provisions. In return we got tobacco. A</p>
<p>large expanse of water spread to the westward of us and beyond</p>
<p>were a cluster of roofs and one or two church towers. The barge</p>
<p>was rather cramped for so many men, and I let several squads,</p>
<p>thirty or forty perhaps altogether, bivouac on the bank. I did</p>
<p>not let them go into the house on account of the furniture, and I</p>
<p>left a note of indebtedness for the food we had taken. We were</p>
<p>particularly glad of our tobacco and fires, because of the</p>
<p>numerous mosquitoes that rose about us.</p>
<p>'The gate of the house from which we had provisioned <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_519">ourselves</a></p>
<p>was adorned with the legend, Vreugde bij Vrede, "<a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_520">Joy</a> with Peace,"</p>
<p>and it bore every mark of the busy retirement of a comfort-loving</p>
<p>proprietor. I went along his garden, which was gay and delightful</p>
<p>with big bushes of rose and sweet brier, to a quaint little</p>
<p>summer-house, and there I sat and watched the men in groups</p>
<p>cooking and squatting along the bank. The sun was setting in a</p>
<p>nearly cloudless sky.</p>
<p>'For the last two weeks I had been a wholly occupied man, intent</p>
<p>only upon obeying the orders that came down to me. All through</p>
<p>this time I had been working to the very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_521">limit</a> of my mental and</p>
<p>physical faculties, and my only moments of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_522">rest</a> had been devoted</p>
<p>to snatches of sleep. Now came this rare, unexpected interlude,</p>
<p>and I could look <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_523">detachedly</a> upon what I was doing and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_524">feel</a></p>
<p>something of its infinite wonderfulness. I was irradiated with</p>
<p>affection for the men of my company and with admiration at their</p>
<p>cheerful acquiescence in the subordination and needs of our</p>
<p>positions. I watched their proceedings and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_525">heard</a> their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_526">pleasant</a></p>
<p>voices. How willing those men were! How ready to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_527">accept</a></p>
<p>leadership and forget <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_528">themselves</a> in collective ends! I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_529">thought</a></p>
<p>how manfully they had gone through all the strains and toil of</p>
<p>the last two weeks, how they had toughened and shaken down to</p>
<p>comradeship together, and how much sweetness there is after all</p>
<p>in our foolish human blood. For they were just one casual sample</p>
<p>of the species-their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_530">patience</a> and readiness lay, as the energy</p>
<p>of the atom had lain, still waiting to be properly utilised.</p>
<p>Again it came to me with overpowering force that the supreme need</p>
<p>of our race is leading, that the supreme task is to discover</p>
<p>leading, to forget oneself in realising the collective purpose of</p>
<p>the race. Once more I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_531">saw</a> life plain…'</p>
<p>Very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_532">characteristic</a> is that of the 'rather too corpulent' young</p>
<p>officer, who was afterwards to set it all down in the Wander</p>
<p>Jahre. Very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_532">characteristic</a>, too, it is of the change in men's</p>
<p>hearts that was even then preparing a new phase of human history.</p>
<p>He goes on to write of the escape from individuality in science</p>
<p>and service, and of his discovery of this 'salvation.' All that</p>
<p>was then, no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_533">doubt</a>, very moving and original; now it seems only</p>
<p>the most obvious commonplace of human life.</p>
<p>The glow of the sunset faded, the twilight deepened into night.</p>
<p>The fires burnt the brighter, and some Irishmen away across the</p>
<p>meer started singing. But Barnet's men were too weary for that</p>
<p>sort of thing, and soon the bank and the barge were heaped with</p>
<p>sleeping <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_534">forms</a>.</p>
<p>'I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_535">alone</a> seemed unable to sleep. I suppose I was over-weary, and</p>
<p>after a little feverish slumber by the tiller of the barge I sat</p>
<p>up, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_536">awake</a> and uneasy…</p>
<p>'That night Holland seemed all sky. There was just a little</p>
<p>black lower rim to things, a steeple, perhaps, or a line of</p>
<p>poplars, and then the great hemisphere swept over us. As at</p>
<p>first the sky was empty. Yet my uneasiness referred itself in</p>
<p>some vague way to the sky.</p>
<p>'And now I was melancholy. I found something strangely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_537">sorrowful</a></p>
<p>and submissive in the sleepers all about me, those men who had</p>
<p>marched so far, who had left all the established texture of their</p>
<p>lives behind them to come upon this mad campaign, this campaign</p>
<p>that signified nothing and consumed everything, this mere fever</p>
<p>of fighting. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_538">saw</a> how little and feeble is the life of man, a</p>
<p>thing of chances, preposterously unable to find the will to</p>
<p>realise even the most timid of its <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_539">dreams</a>. And I wondered if</p>
<p>always it would be so, if man was a doomed animal who would never</p>
<p>to the last days of his time take hold of fate and change it to</p>
<p>his will. Always, it may be, he will remain kindly but <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_540">jealous</a>,</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_541">desirous</a> but discursive, able and unwisely impulsive, until</p>
<p>Saturn who begot him shall devour him in his turn…</p>
<p>'I was roused from these <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_542">thoughts</a> by the sudden realisation of</p>
<p>the presence of a squadron of aeroplanes far away to the</p>
<p>north-east and very high. They looked like little black dashes</p>
<p>against the midnight blue. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_543">remember</a> that I looked up at them at</p>
<p>first rather idly-as one might notice a flight of birds. Then I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_544">perceived</a> that they were only the extreme wing of a great fleet</p>
<p>that was advancing in a long line very swiftly from the direction</p>
<p>of the frontier and my attention tightened.</p>
<p>'Directly I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_545">saw</a> that fleet I was astonished not to have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_546">seen</a> it</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>'I stood up softly, undesirous of disturbing my companions, but</p>
<p>with my heart beating now rather more rapidly with surprise and</p>
<p>excitement. I strained my ears for any sound of guns along our</p>
<p>front. Almost instinctively I turned about for protection to the</p>
<p>south and west, and peered; and then I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_547">saw</a> coming as fast and</p>
<p>much nearer to me, as if they had sprung out of the darkness,</p>
<p>three banks of aeroplanes; a group of squadrons very high, a main</p>
<p>body at a height perhaps of one or two thousand feet, and a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_548">doubtful</a> number flying low and very indistinct. The middle ones</p>
<p>were so thick they kept putting out groups of stars. And I</p>
<p>realised that after all there was to be fighting in the air.</p>
<p>'There was something extraordinarily strange in this swift,</p>
<p>noiseless convergence of nearly invisible combatants above the</p>
<p>sleeping hosts. Every one about me was still unconscious; there</p>
<p>was no sign as yet of any agitation among the shipping on the</p>
<p>main canal, whose whole course, dotted with unsuspicious lights</p>
<p>and fringed with fires, must have been clearly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_549">perceptible</a> from</p>
<p>above. Then a long way off towards Alkmaar I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_550">heard</a> bugles, and</p>
<p>after that shots, and then a wild clamour of bells. I determined</p>
<p>to let my men sleep on for as long as they could…</p>
<p>'The battle was joined with the swiftness of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_551">dreaming</a>. I do not</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_552">think</a> it can have been five minutes from the moment when I first</p>
<p>became aware of the Central European air fleet to the contact of</p>
<p>the two forces. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_553">saw</a> it quite plainly in silhouette against the</p>
<p>luminous blue of the northern sky. The allied aeroplanes-they</p>
<p>were mostly French-came pouring down like a fierce shower upon</p>
<p>the middle of the Central European fleet. They looked exactly</p>
<p>like a coarser sort of rain. There was a crackling sound-the</p>
<p>first sound I heard-it reminded one of the Aurora Borealis, and</p>
<p>I supposed it was an interchange of rifle shots. There were</p>
<p>flashes like summer lightning; and then all the sky became a</p>
<p>whirling <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_554">confusion</a> of battle that was still largely noiseless.</p>
<p>Some of the Central European aeroplanes were certainly charged</p>
<p>and overset; others seemed to collapse and fall and then flare</p>
<p>out with so bright a light that it took the edge off one's vision</p>
<p>and made the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_555">rest</a> of the battle disappear as though it had been</p>
<p>snatched back out of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_556">sight</a>.</p>
<p>'And then, while I still peered and tried to shade these flames</p>
<p>from my eyes with my hand, and while the men about me were</p>
<p>beginning to stir, the atomic bombs were thrown at the dykes.</p>
<p>They made a mighty thunder in the air, and fell like Lucifer in</p>
<p>the picture, leaving a flaring trail in the sky. The night,</p>
<p>which had been pellucid and detailed and eventful, seemed to</p>
<p>vanish, to be replaced abruptly by a black background to these</p>
<p>tremendous pillars of fire…</p>
<p>'Hard upon the sound of them came a roaring wind, and the sky was</p>
<p>filled with flickering lightnings and rushing clouds…</p>
<p>'There was something discontinuous in this impact. At one moment</p>
<p>I was a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_557">lonely</a> watcher in a sleeping world; the next <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_558">saw</a> every</p>
<p>one about me afoot, the whole world <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_559">awake</a> and amazed…</p>
<p>'And then the wind had struck me a buffet, taken my helmet and</p>
<p>swept aside the summerhouse of Vreugde bij Vrede, as a scythe</p>
<p>sweeps away grass. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_560">saw</a> the bombs fall, and then watched a great</p>
<p>crimson flare leap <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_561">responsive</a> to each impact, and mountainous</p>
<p>masses of red-lit steam and flying fragments clamber up towards</p>
<p>the zenith. Against the glare I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_560">saw</a> the country-side for miles</p>
<p>standing black and clear, churches, trees, chimneys. And</p>
<p>suddenly I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_562">understood</a>. The Central Europeans had burst the dykes.</p>
<p>Those flares meant the bursting of the dykes, and in a little</p>
<p>while the sea-water would be upon us…'</p>
<p>He goes on to tell with a certain prolixity of the steps he</p>
<p>took-and all things considered they were very intelligent</p>
<p>steps-to meet this amazing crisis. He got his men aboard and</p>
<p>hailed the adjacent barges; he got the man who acted as barge</p>
<p>engineer at his post and the engines working, he cast loose from</p>
<p>his moorings. Then he bethought <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_563">himself</a> of food, and contrived to</p>
<p>land five men, get in a few dozen cheeses, and ship his men again</p>
<p>before the inundation reached them.</p>
<p>He is reasonably proud of this piece of coolness. His idea was</p>
<p>to take the wave head-on and with his engines full speed ahead.</p>
<p>And all the while he was thanking heaven he was not in the jam of</p>
<p>traffic in the main canal. He rather, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_564">think</a>, overestimated the</p>
<p>probable rush of waters; he dreaded <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_565">being</a> swept away, he</p>
<p>explains, and smashed against houses and trees.</p>
<p>He does not give any estimate of the time it took between the</p>
<p>bursting of the dykes and the arrival of the waters, but it was</p>
<p>probably an interval of about twenty minutes or half an hour. He</p>
<p>was working now in darkness-save for the light of his</p>
<p>lantern-and in a great wind. He hung out head and stern</p>
<p>lights…</p>
<p>Whirling torrents of steam were pouring up from the advancing</p>
<p>waters, which had rushed, it must be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_566">remembered</a>, through nearly</p>
<p>incandescent gaps in the sea defences, and this vast uprush of</p>
<p>vapour soon veiled the flaring centres of explosion altogether.</p>
<p>'The waters came at last, an advancing cascade. It was like a</p>
<p>broad roller sweeping across the country. They came with a deep,</p>
<p>roaring sound. I had expected a Niagara, but the total fall of</p>
<p>the front could not have been much more than twelve feet. Our</p>
<p>barge hesitated for a moment, took a dose over her bows, and then</p>
<p>lifted. I signalled for full speed ahead and brought her head</p>
<p>upstream, and held on like grim death to keep her there.</p>
<p>'There was a wind about as strong as the flood, and I found we</p>
<p>were pounding against every conceivable buoyant <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_567">object</a> that had</p>
<p>been between us and the sea. The only light in the world now</p>
<p>came from our lamps, the steam became impenetrable at a score of</p>
<p>yards from the boat, and the roar of the wind and water cut us</p>
<p>off from all remoter sounds. The black, shining waters swirled</p>
<p>by, coming into the light of our lamps out of an ebony blackness</p>
<p>and vanishing again into impenetrable black. And on the waters</p>
<p>came shapes, came things that flashed upon us for a moment, now a</p>
<p>half-submerged boat, now a cow, now a huge fragment of a house's</p>
<p>timberings, now a muddle of packing-cases and scaffolding. The</p>
<p>things clapped into <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_568">sight</a> like something shown by the opening of</p>
<p>a shutter, and then bumped shatteringly against us or rushed by</p>
<p>us. Once I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_569">saw</a> very clearly a man's white face…</p>
<p>'All the while a group of labouring, half-submerged trees</p>
<p>remained ahead of us, drawing very slowly nearer. I steered a</p>
<p>course to avoid them. They seemed to gesticulate a frantic</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_570">despair</a> against the black steam clouds behind. Once a great</p>
<p>branch <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_571">detached</a> itself and tore shuddering by me. We did, on the</p>
<p>whole, make headway. The last I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_572">saw</a> of Vreugde bij Vrede before</p>
<p>the night swallowed it, was almost dead astern of us…'</p>
<p>Section 9</p>
<p>Morning found Barnet still afloat. The bows of his barge had</p>
<p>been badly strained, and his men were pumping or baling in</p>
<p>relays. He had got about a dozen half-drowned people aboard whose</p>
<p>boat had capsized near him, and he had three other boats in tow.</p>
<p>He was afloat, and somewhere between Amsterdam and Alkmaar, but</p>
<p>he could not tell where. It was a day that was still half night.</p>
<p>Gray waters stretched in every direction under a dark gray sky,</p>
<p>and out of the waves rose the upper parts of houses, in many</p>
<p>cases ruined, the tops of trees, windmills, in fact the upper</p>
<p>third of all the familiar Dutch scenery; and on it there drifted</p>
<p>a dimly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_573">seen</a> flotilla of barges, small boats, many overturned,</p>
<p>furniture, rafts, timbering, and miscellaneous <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_574">objects</a>.</p>
<p>The drowned were under water that morning. Only here and there</p>
<p>did a dead cow or a stiff figure still clinging stoutly to a box</p>
<p>or chair or such-like buoy hint at the hidden massacre. It was</p>
<p>not till the Thursday that the dead came to the surface in any</p>
<p>quantity. The view was bounded on every side by a gray mist that</p>
<p>closed overhead in a gray canopy. The air cleared in the</p>
<p>afternoon, and then, far away to the west under great banks of</p>
<p>steam and dust, the flaming red eruption of the atomic bombs came</p>
<p>visible across the waste of water.</p>
<p>They showed flat and sullen through the mist, like London</p>
<p>sunsets. 'They sat upon the sea,' says Barnet, 'like frayed-out</p>
<p>waterlilies of flame.'</p>
<p>Barnet seems to have spent the morning in rescue work along the</p>
<p>track of the canal, in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_575">helping</a> people who were adrift, in picking</p>
<p>up derelict boats, and in taking people out of imperilled houses.</p>
<p>He found other military barges similarly employed, and it was</p>
<p>only as the day wore on and the immediate appeals for aid were</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_576">satisfied</a> that he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_577">thought</a> of food and drink for his men, and what</p>
<p>course he had better pursue. They had a little cheese, but no</p>
<p>water. 'Orders,' that mysterious direction, had at last</p>
<p>altogether disappeared. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_578">perceived</a> he had now to act upon his</p>
<p>own <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_579">responsibility</a>.</p>
<p>'One's sense was of a destruction so far-reaching and of a world</p>
<p>so altered that it seemed foolish to go in any direction and</p>
<p>expect to find things as they had been before the war began. I</p>
<p>sat on the quarter-deck with Mylius my engineer and Kemp and two</p>
<p>others of the non-commissioned officers, and we consulted upon</p>
<p>our line of action. We were foodless and aimless. We agreed</p>
<p>that our fighting value was extremely small, and that our first</p>
<p>duty was to get <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_580">ourselves</a> in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_581">touch</a> with food and instructions</p>
<p>again. Whatever plan of campaign had directed our movements was</p>
<p>manifestly smashed to bits. Mylius was of opinion that we could</p>
<p>take a line westward and get back to England across the North</p>
<p>Sea. He calculated that with such a motor barge as ours it would</p>
<p>be possible to reach the Yorkshire coast within four-and-twenty</p>
<p>hours. But this idea I overruled because of the shortness of our</p>
<p>provisions, and more particularly because of our urgent need of</p>
<p>water.</p>
<p>'Every boat we drew near now hailed us for water, and their</p>
<p>demands did much to exasperate our thirst. I decided that if we</p>
<p>went away to the south we should reach hilly country, or at least</p>
<p>country that was not submerged, and then we should be able to</p>
<p>land, find some stream, drink, and get supplies and news. Many of</p>
<p>the barges adrift in the haze about us were filled with British</p>
<p>soldiers and had floated up from the Nord <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_582">See</a> Canal, but none of</p>
<p>them were any better informed than <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_583">ourselves</a> of the course of</p>
<p>events. "Orders" had, in fact, vanished out of the sky.</p>
<p>' "Orders" made a temporary reappearance late that evening in the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_584">form</a> of a megaphone hail from a British torpedo boat, announcing</p>
<p>a truce, and giving the welcome information that food and water</p>
<p>were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_585">being</a> hurried down the Rhine and were to be found on the</p>
<p>barge flotilla lying over the old Rhine above Leiden.'…</p>
<p>We will not follow Barnet, however, in the description of his</p>
<p>strange overland voyage among trees and houses and churches by</p>
<p>Zaandam and between Haarlem and Amsterdam, to Leiden. It was a</p>
<p>voyage in a red-lit mist, in a world of steamy silhouette, full</p>
<p>of strange voices and perplexity, and with every other sensation</p>
<p>dominated by a feverish thirst. 'We sat,' he says, 'in a little</p>
<p>huddled group, saying very little, and the men forward were mere</p>
<p>knots of silent endurance. Our only <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_586">continuing</a> sound was the</p>
<p>persistent mewing of a cat one of the men had rescued from a</p>
<p>floating hayrick near Zaandam. We kept a southward course by a</p>
<p>watch-chain compass Mylius had produced…</p>
<p>'I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_587">think</a> any of us <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_588">felt</a> we belonged to a defeated army,</p>
<p>nor had we any strong sense of the war as the dominating fact</p>
<p>about us. Our mental setting had far more of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_589">effect</a> of a</p>
<p>huge natural catastrophe. The atomic bombs had dwarfed the</p>
<p>international issues to complete insignificance. When our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_590">minds</a></p>
<p>wandered from the preoccupations of our immediate needs, we</p>
<p>speculated upon the possibility of stopping the use of these</p>
<p>frightful explosives before the world was utterly destroyed. For</p>
<p>to us it seemed quite plain that these bombs and the still</p>
<p>greater power of destruction of which they were the precursors</p>
<p>might quite easily shatter every <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_591">relationship</a> and institution of</p>
<p>mankind.</p>
<p>' "What will they be doing," asked Mylius, "what will they be</p>
<p>doing? It's plain we've got to put an end to war. It's plain</p>
<p>things have to be run some way. THIS-all this-is impossible."</p>
<p>'I made no immediate answer. Something-I cannot <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_592">think</a> what-had</p>
<p>brought back to me the figure of that man I had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_593">seen</a> wounded on</p>
<p>the very first day of actual fighting. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_594">saw</a> again his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_595">angry</a>,</p>
<p>tearful eyes, and that poor, dripping, bloody mess that had been</p>
<p>a skilful human hand five minutes before, thrust out in indignant</p>
<p>protest. "Damned foolery," he had stormed and sobbed, "damned</p>
<p>foolery. My right hand, sir! My RIGHT hand…"</p>
<p>'My <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_596">faith</a> had for a time gone altogether out of me. "I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_597">think</a> we</p>
<p>are too-too silly," I said to Mylius, "ever to stop war. If we'd</p>
<p>had the sense to do it, we should have done it before this. I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_597">think</a> this--" I pointed to the gaunt black outline of a smashed</p>
<p>windmill that stuck up, ridiculous and ugly, above the blood-lit</p>
<p>waters-"this is the end." '</p>
<p>Section 10</p>
<p>But now our history must part company with Frederick Barnet and</p>
<p>his barge-load of hungry and starving men.</p>
<p>For a time in western Europe at least it was indeed as if</p>
<p>civilisation had come to a final collapse. These crowning buds</p>
<p>upon the tradition that Napoleon planted and Bismarck watered,</p>
<p>opened and flared 'like waterlilies of flame' over nations</p>
<p>destroyed, over churches smashed or submerged, towns ruined,</p>
<p>fields lost to mankind for ever, and a million weltering bodies.</p>
<p>Was this lesson enough for mankind, or would the flames of war</p>
<p>still burn amidst the ruins?</p>
<p>Neither Barnet nor his companions, it is clear, had any assurance</p>
<p>in their answers to that question. Already once in the history</p>
<p>of mankind, in America, before its discovery by the whites, an</p>
<p>organised civilisation had given way to a mere cult of warfare,</p>
<p>specialised and cruel, and it seemed for a time to many a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_598">thoughtful</a> man as if the whole world was but to repeat on a</p>
<p>larger scale this ascendancy of the warrior, this triumph of the</p>
<p>destructive instincts of the race.</p>
<p>The subsequent chapters of Barnet's narrative do but supply body</p>
<p>to this tragic possibility. He gives a series of vignettes of</p>
<p>civilisation, shattered, it seemed, almost irreparably. He found</p>
<p>the Belgian hills swarming with refugees and desolated by</p>
<p>cholera; the vestiges of the contending armies keeping order</p>
<p>under a truce, without actual battles, but with the cautious</p>
<p>hostility of habit, and a great absence of plan everywhere.</p>
<p>Overhead aeroplanes went on mysterious errands, and there were</p>
<p>rumours of cannibalism and hysterical fanaticisms in the valleys</p>
<p>of the Semoy and the forest region of the eastern Ardennes.</p>
<p>There was the report of an attack upon Russia by the Chinese and</p>
<p>Japanese, and of some huge revolutionary outbreak in America.</p>
<p>The weather was stormier than men had ever <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_599">known</a> it in those</p>
<p>regions, with much thunder and lightning and wild cloud-bursts of</p>
<p>rain…</p>

<p>CHAPTER THE THIRD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THE ENDING OF WAR</p>
</title>
<p>Section 1</p>
<p>On the mountain-side above the town of Brissago and commanding</p>
<p>two long stretches of Lake Maggiore, looking eastward to</p>
<p>Bellinzona, and southward to Luino, there is a shelf of grass</p>
<p>meadows which is very beautiful in springtime with a great</p>
<p>multitude of wild flowers. More particularly is this so in early</p>
<p>June, when the slender asphodel Saint Bruno's lily, with its</p>
<p>spike of white blossom, is in flower. To the westward of this</p>
<p>delightful shelf there is a deep and densely wooded trench, a</p>
<p>great gulf of blue some mile or so in width out of which arise</p>
<p>great precipices very high and wild. Above the asphodel fields</p>
<p>the mountains climb in rocky slopes to solitudes of stone and</p>
<p>sunlight that curve round and join that wall of cliffs in one</p>
<p>common skyline. This desolate and austere background contrasts</p>
<p>very vividly with the glowing serenity of the great lake below,</p>
<p>with the spacious view of fertile hills and roads and villages</p>
<p>and islands to south and east, and with the hotly golden rice</p>
<p>flats of the Val Maggia to the north. And because it was a remote</p>
<p>and insignificant place, far away out of the crowding tragedies</p>
<p>of that year of disaster, away from burning cities and starving</p>
<p>multitudes, bracing and tranquillising and hidden, it was here</p>
<p>that there gathered the conference of rulers that was to arrest,</p>
<p>if possible, before it was too late, the debacle of civilisation.</p>
<p>Here, brought together by the indefatigable energy of that</p>
<p>impassioned humanitarian, Leblanc, the French ambassador at</p>
<p>Washington, the chief Powers of the world were to meet in a last</p>
<p>desperate conference to 'save humanity.'</p>
<p>Leblanc was one of those ingenuous men whose lot would have been</p>
<p>insignificant in any period of security, but who have been caught</p>
<p>up to an immortal role in history by the sudden simplification of</p>
<p>human affairs through some tragical crisis, to the measure of</p>
<p>their simplicity. Such a man was Abraham Lincoln, and such was</p>
<p>Garibaldi. And Leblanc, with his transparent childish innocence,</p>
<p>his entire self-forgetfulness, came into this <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_600">confusion</a> of</p>
<p>distrust and intricate disaster with an invincible appeal for the</p>
<p>manifest sanities of the situation. His voice, when he spoke, was</p>
<p>'full of remonstrance.' He was a little bald, spectacled man,</p>
<p>inspired by that intellectual idealism which has been one of the</p>
<p>peculiar gifts of France to humanity. He was possessed of one</p>
<p>clear persuasion, that war must end, and that the only way to end</p>
<p>war was to have but one government for mankind. He brushed aside</p>
<p>all other considerations. At the very outbreak of the war, so</p>
<p>soon as the two capitals of the belligerents had been wrecked, he</p>
<p>went to the president in the White House with this proposal. He</p>
<p>made it as if it was a matter of course. He was fortunate to be</p>
<p>in Washington and in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_601">touch</a> with that gigantic childishness which</p>
<p>was the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_602">characteristic</a> of the American imagination. For the</p>
<p>Americans also were among the simple peoples by whom the world</p>
<p>was saved. He won over the American president and the American</p>
<p>government to his general ideas; at any rate they supported him</p>
<p>sufficiently to give him a standing with the more sceptical</p>
<p>European governments, and with this backing he set to work-it</p>
<p>seemed the most fantastic of enterprises-to bring together all</p>
<p>the rulers of the world and unify them. He wrote innumerable</p>
<p>letters, he sent messages, he went desperate journeys, he</p>
<p>enlisted whatever support he could find; no one was too humble</p>
<p>for an ally or too obstinate for his advances; through the</p>
<p>terrible autumn of the last wars this persistent little visionary</p>
<p>in spectacles must have seemed rather like a hopeful canary</p>
<p>twittering during a thunderstorm. And no accumulation of</p>
<p>disasters daunted his conviction that they could be ended.</p>
<p>For the whole world was flaring then into a monstrous phase of</p>
<p>destruction. Power after Power about the armed globe sought to</p>
<p>anticipate attack by aggression. They went to war in a delirium</p>
<p>of panic, in order to use their bombs first. China and Japan had</p>
<p>assailed Russia and destroyed Moscow, the United States had</p>
<p>attacked Japan, India was in anarchistic revolt with Delhi a pit</p>
<p>of fire spouting death and flame; the redoubtable King of the</p>
<p>Balkans was mobilising. It must have seemed plain at last to</p>
<p>every one in those days that the world was slipping headlong to</p>
<p>anarchy. By the spring of 1959 from nearly two hundred centres,</p>
<p>and every week added to their number, roared the unquenchable</p>
<p>crimson conflagrations of the atomic bombs, the flimsy fabric of</p>
<p>the world's credit had vanished, industry was completely</p>
<p>disorganised and every city, every thickly populated area was</p>
<p>starving or trembled on the verge of starvation. Most of the</p>
<p>capital cities of the world were burning; millions of people had</p>
<p>already perished, and over great areas government was at an end.</p>
<p>Humanity has been compared by one contemporary writer to a</p>
<p>sleeper who handles matches in his sleep and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_603">wakes</a> to find</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_604">himself</a> in flames.</p>
<p>For many months it was an open question whether there was to be</p>
<p>found throughout all the race the will and intelligence to face</p>
<p>these new <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_605">conditions</a> and make even an attempt to arrest the</p>
<p>downfall of the social order. For a time the war <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_606">spirit</a> defeated</p>
<p>every effort to rally the forces of preservation and</p>
<p>construction. Leblanc seemed to be protesting against</p>
<p>earthquakes, and as likely to find a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_606">spirit</a> of reason in the</p>
<p>crater of Etna. Even though the shattered official governments</p>
<p>now clamoured for peace, bands of irreconcilables and invincible</p>
<p>patriots, usurpers, adventurers, and political desperadoes, were</p>
<p>everywhere in possession of the simple apparatus for the</p>
<p>disengagement of atomic energy and the initiation of new centres</p>
<p>of destruction. The stuff exercised an irresistible fascination</p>
<p>upon a certain type of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_607">mind</a>. Why should any one give in while he</p>
<p>can still destroy his enemies? Surrender? While there is still</p>
<p>a chance of blowing them to dust? The power of destruction which</p>
<p>had once been the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_608">ultimate</a> privilege of government was now the</p>
<p>only power left in the world-and it was everywhere. There were</p>
<p>few <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_609">thoughtful</a> men during that phase of blazing waste who did not</p>
<p>pass through such moods of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_610">despair</a> as Barnet describes, and</p>
<p>declare with him: 'This is the end…'</p>
<p>And all the while Leblanc was going to and fro with glittering</p>
<p>glasses and an inexhaustible persuasiveness, urging the manifest</p>
<p>reasonableness of his view upon ears that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_611">ceased</a> presently to be</p>
<p>inattentive. Never at any time did he betray a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_612">doubt</a> that all</p>
<p>this chaotic conflict would end. No nurse during a nursery</p>
<p>uproar was ever so certain of the inevitable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_613">ultimate</a> peace.</p>
<p>From <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_614">being</a> treated as an amiable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_615">dreamer</a> he came by insensible</p>
<p>degrees to be regarded as an extravagant possibility. Then he</p>
<p>began to seem even practicable. The people who listened to him in</p>
<p>1958 with a smiling impatience, were eager before 1959 was four</p>
<p>months old to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_616">know</a> just exactly what he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_617">thought</a> might be done.</p>
<p>He answered with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_618">patience</a> of a philosopher and the lucidity</p>
<p>of a Frenchman. He began to receive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_619">responses</a> of a more and more</p>
<p>hopeful type. He came across the Atlantic to Italy, and there he</p>
<p>gathered in the promises for this congress. He chose those high</p>
<p>meadows above Brissago for the reasons we have stated. 'We must</p>
<p>get away,' he said, 'from old associations.' He set to work</p>
<p>requisitioning material for his conference with an assurance that</p>
<p>was justified by the replies. With a slight incredulity the</p>
<p>conference which was to begin a new order in the world, gathered</p>
<p>itself together. Leblanc summoned it without <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_620">arrogance</a>, he</p>
<p>controlled it by <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_621">virtue</a> of an infinite humility. Men appeared</p>
<p>upon those upland slopes with the apparatus for wireless</p>
<p>telegraphy; others followed with tents and provisions; a little</p>
<p>cable was flung down to a convenient point upon the Locarno road</p>
<p>below. Leblanc arrived, sedulously directing every detail that</p>
<p>would affect the tone of the assembly. He might have been a</p>
<p>courier in advance rather than the originator of the gathering.</p>
<p>And then there arrived, some by the cable, most by aeroplane, a</p>
<p>few in other fashions, the men who had been called together to</p>
<p>confer upon the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_622">state</a> of the world. It was to be a conference</p>
<p>without a name. Nine monarchs, the presidents of four republics,</p>
<p>a number of ministers and ambassadors, powerful journalists, and</p>
<p>such-like prominent and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_623">influential</a> men, took part in it. There</p>
<p>were even scientific men; and that world-famous old man, Holsten,</p>
<p>came with the others to contribute his amateur statecraft to the</p>
<p>desperate problem of the age. Only Leblanc would have dared so</p>
<p>to summon figure heads and powers and intelligence, or have had</p>
<p>the courage to hope for their agreement…</p>
<p>Section 2</p>
<p>And one at least of those who were called to this conference of</p>
<p>governments came to it on foot. This was King Egbert, the young</p>
<p>king of the most venerable kingdom in Europe. He was a rebel,</p>
<p>and had always been of deliberate choice a rebel against the</p>
<p>magnificence of his position. He affected long pedestrian tours</p>
<p>and a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_624">disposition</a> to sleep in the open air. He came now over the</p>
<p>Pass of Sta Maria Maggiore and by boat up the lake to Brissago;</p>
<p>thence he walked up the mountain, a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_625">pleasant</a> path set with oaks</p>
<p>and sweet chestnut. For provision on the walk, for he did not</p>
<p>want to hurry, he carried with him a pocketful of bread and</p>
<p>cheese. A certain small retinue that was necessary to his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_626">comfort</a></p>
<p>and dignity upon occasions of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_627">state</a> he sent on by the cable car,</p>
<p>and with him walked his private secretary, Firmin, a man who had</p>
<p>thrown up the Professorship of World Politics in the London</p>
<p>School of Sociology, Economics, and Political Science, to take up</p>
<p>these duties. Firmin was a man of strong rather than rapid</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_628">thought</a>, he had anticipated great <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_629">influence</a> in this new position,</p>
<p>and after some years he was still only beginning to apprehend how</p>
<p>largely his function was to listen. Originally he had been</p>
<p>something of a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_630">thinker</a> upon international politics, an authority</p>
<p>upon tariffs and strategy, and a valued contributor to various of</p>
<p>the higher organs of public opinion, but the atomic bombs had</p>
<p>taken him by surprise, and he had still to recover completely</p>
<p>from his pre-atomic opinions and the silencing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_631">effect</a> of those</p>
<p>sustained explosives.</p>
<p>The king's freedom from the trammels of etiquette was very</p>
<p>complete. In theory-and he abounded in theory-his manners were</p>
<p>purely democratic. It was by sheer habit and inadvertency that he</p>
<p>permitted Firmin, who had discovered a rucksack in a small shop</p>
<p>in the town below, to carry both bottles of beer. The king had</p>
<p>never, as a matter of fact, carried anything for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_632">himself</a> in his</p>
<p>life, and he had never noted that he did not do so.</p>
<p>'We will have nobody with us,' he said, 'at all. We will be</p>
<p>perfectly simple.'</p>
<p>So Firmin carried the beer.</p>
<p>As they walked up-it was the king made the pace rather than</p>
<p>Firmin-they talked of the conference before them, and Firmin,</p>
<p>with a certain want of assurance that would have surprised him in</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_633">himself</a> in the days of his Professorship, sought to define the</p>
<p>policy of his companion. 'In its broader <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_634">form</a>, sir,' said Firmin;</p>
<p>'I admit a certain plausibility in this project of Leblanc's, but</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_635">feel</a> that although it may be advisable to set up some sort of</p>
<p>general control for International affairs-a sort of Hague Court</p>
<p>with extended powers-that is no reason whatever for losing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_636">sight</a></p>
<p>of the principles of national and imperial autonomy.'</p>
<p>'Firmin,' said the king, 'I am going to set my brother kings a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_637">good</a> example.'</p>
<p>Firmin intimated a curiosity that veiled a dread.</p>
<p>'By chucking all that nonsense,' said the king.</p>
<p>He quickened his pace as Firmin, who was already a little out of</p>
<p>breath, betrayed a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_638">disposition</a> to reply.</p>
<p>'I am going to chuck all that nonsense,' said the king, as Firmin</p>
<p>prepared to speak. 'I am going to fling my royalty and empire on</p>
<p>the table-and declare at once I don't mean to haggle. It's</p>
<p>haggling-about rights-has been the devil in human affairs,</p>
<p>for-always. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_639">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_640">am</a> going to stop this nonsense.'</p>
<p>Firmin halted abruptly. 'But, sir!' he cried.</p>
<p>The king stopped six yards ahead of him and looked back at his</p>
<p>adviser's perspiring visage.</p>
<p>'Do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_641">really</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_642">think</a>, Firmin, that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_643">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_644">am</a> here as-as an infernal</p>
<p>politician to put my crown and my flag and my claims and so forth</p>
<p>in the way of peace? That little Frenchman is right. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_645">know</a> he</p>
<p>is right as well as I do. Those things are over. We-we kings</p>
<p>and rulers and representatives have been at the very heart of the</p>
<p>mischief. Of course we imply separation, and of course</p>
<p>separation means the threat of war, and of course the threat of</p>
<p>war means the accumulation of more and more atomic bombs. The old</p>
<p>game's up. But, I say, we mustn't stand here, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_645">know</a>. The</p>
<p>world waits. Don't you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_642">think</a> the old game's up, Firmin?'</p>
<p>Firmin adjusted a strap, passed a hand over his wet forehead, and</p>
<p>followed earnestly. 'I admit, sir,' he said to a receding back,</p>
<p>'that there has to be some sort of hegemony, some sort of</p>
<p>Amphictyonic council--'</p>
<p>'There's got to be one simple government for all the world,' said</p>
<p>the king over his shoulder.</p>
<p>'But as for a reckless, unqualified abandonment, sir--'</p>
<p>'BANG!' cried the king.</p>
<p>Firmin made no answer to this interruption. But a faint shadow</p>
<p>of annoyance passed across his heated features.</p>
<p>'Yesterday,' said the king, by way of explanation, 'the Japanese</p>
<p>very nearly got San Francisco.'</p>
<p>'I hadn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_646">heard</a>, sir.'</p>
<p>'The Americans ran the Japanese aeroplane down into the sea and</p>
<p>there the bomb got busted.'</p>
<p>'Under the sea, sir?'</p>
<p>'Yes. Submarine volcano. The steam is in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_647">sight</a> of the</p>
<p>Californian coast. It was as near as that. And with things like</p>
<p>this happening, you want me to go up this hill and haggle.</p>
<p>Consider the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_648">effect</a> of that upon my imperial cousin-and all the</p>
<p>others!'</p>
<p>'HE will haggle, sir.'</p>
<p>'Not a bit of it,' said the king.</p>
<p>'But, sir.'</p>
<p>'Leblanc won't let him.'</p>
<p>Firmin halted abruptly and gave a vicious pull at the offending</p>
<p>strap. 'Sir, he will listen to his advisers,' he said, in a tone</p>
<p>that in some subtle way seemed to implicate his master with the</p>
<p>trouble of the knapsack.</p>
<p>The king considered him.</p>
<p>'We will go just a little higher,' he said. 'I want to find this</p>
<p>unoccupied village they spoke of, and then we will drink that</p>
<p>beer. It can't be far. We will drink the beer and throw away the</p>
<p>bottles. And then, Firmin, I shall ask you to look at things in a</p>
<p>more <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_649">generous</a> light… Because, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_650">know</a>, you must…'</p>
<p>He turned about and for some time the only sound they made was</p>
<p>the noise of their boots upon the loose stones of the way and the</p>
<p>irregular breathing of Firmin.</p>
<p>At length, as it seemed to Firmin, or quite soon, as it seemed to</p>
<p>the king, the gradient of the path diminished, the way widened</p>
<p>out, and they found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_651">themselves</a> in a very beautiful place indeed.</p>
<p>It was one of those upland clusters of sheds and houses that are</p>
<p>still to be found in the mountains of North Italy, buildings that</p>
<p>were used only in the high summer, and which it was the custom to</p>
<p>leave locked up and deserted through all the winter and spring,</p>
<p>and up to the middle of June. The buildings were of a soft-toned</p>
<p>gray stone, buried in rich green grass, shadowed by chestnut</p>
<p>trees and lit by an extraordinary blaze of yellow broom. Never</p>
<p>had the king <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_652">seen</a> broom so glorious; he shouted at the light of</p>
<p>it, for it seemed to give out more sunlight even than it</p>
<p>received; he sat down impulsively on a lichenous stone, tugged</p>
<p>out his bread and cheese, and bade Firmin thrust the beer into</p>
<p>the shaded weeds to cool.</p>
<p>'The things people miss, Firmin,' he said, 'who go up into the</p>
<p>air in ships!'</p>
<p>Firmin looked around him with an ungenial eye. 'You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_653">see</a> it at</p>
<p>its best, sir,' he said, 'before the peasants come here again and</p>
<p>make it filthy.'</p>
<p>'It would be beautiful anyhow,' said the king.</p>
<p>'Superficially, sir,' said Firmin. 'But it stands for a social</p>
<p>order that is fast vanishing away. Indeed, judging by the grass</p>
<p>between the stones and in the huts, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_654">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_655">am</a> inclined to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_656">doubt</a> if it</p>
<p>is in use even now.'</p>
<p>'I suppose,' said the king, 'they would come up immediately the</p>
<p>hay on this flower meadow is cut. It would be those slow,</p>
<p>creamy-coloured beasts, I expect, one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_657">sees</a> on the roads below,</p>
<p>and swarthy girls with red handkerchiefs over their black</p>
<p>hair… It is wonderful to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_658">think</a> how long that beautiful old</p>
<p>life lasted. In the Roman times and long ages before ever the</p>
<p>rumour of the Romans had come into these parts, men drove their</p>
<p>cattle up into these places as the summer came on… How haunted</p>
<p>is this place! There have been quarrels here, hopes, children</p>
<p>have played here and lived to be old crones and old gaffers, and</p>
<p>died, and so it has gone on for thousands of lives. Lovers,</p>
<p>innumerable lovers, have caressed amidst this golden broom…'</p>
<p>He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_659">meditated</a> over a busy mouthful of bread and cheese.</p>
<p>'We ought to have brought a tankard for that beer,' he said.</p>
<p>Firmin produced a folding aluminium cup, and the king was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_660">pleased</a></p>
<p>to drink.</p>
<p>'I wish, sir,' said Firmin suddenly, 'I could induce you at least</p>
<p>to delay your decision--'</p>
<p>'It's no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_661">good</a> talking, Firmin,' said the king. 'My mind's as</p>
<p>clear as daylight.'</p>
<p>'Sire,' protested Firmin, with his voice full of bread and cheese</p>
<p>and genuine <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_662">emotion</a>, 'have you no respect for your kingship?'</p>
<p>The king paused before he answered with unwonted gravity. 'It's</p>
<p>just because I have, Firmin, that I won't be a puppet in this</p>
<p>game of international politics.' He regarded his companion for a</p>
<p>moment and then remarked: 'Kingship!-what do YOU <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_663">know</a> of</p>
<p>kingship, Firmin?</p>
<p>'Yes,' cried the king to his astonished counsellor. 'For the</p>
<p>first time in my life <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_664">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_665">am</a> going to be a king. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_664">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_665">am</a> going to</p>
<p>lead, and lead by my own authority. For a dozen generations my</p>
<p>family has been a set of dummies in the hands of their advisers.</p>
<p>Advisers! Now <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_664">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_665">am</a> going to be a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_666">real</a> king-and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_664">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_665">am</a> going</p>
<p>to-to abolish, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_667">dispose</a> of, finish, the crown to which I have</p>
<p>been a slave. But what a world of paralysing shams this roaring</p>
<p>stuff has ended! The rigid old world is in the melting-pot again,</p>
<p>and I, who seemed to be no more than the stuffing inside a regal</p>
<p>robe, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_664">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_665">am</a> a king among kings. I have to play my part at the head</p>
<p>of things and put an end to blood and fire and idiot disorder.'</p>
<p>'But, sir,' protested Firmin.</p>
<p>'This man Leblanc is right. The whole world has got to be a</p>
<p>Republic, one and indivisible. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_668">know</a> that, and my duty is to</p>
<p>make that easy. A king should lead his people; you want me to</p>
<p>stick on their backs like some Old Man of the Sea. To-day must</p>
<p>be a sacrament of kings. Our trust for mankind is done with and</p>
<p>ended. We must part our robes among them, we must part our</p>
<p>kingship among them, and say to them all, now the king in every</p>
<p>one must rule the world… Have you no sense of the magnificence</p>
<p>of this occasion? You want me, Firmin, you want me to go up</p>
<p>there and haggle like a damned little solicitor for some price,</p>
<p>some compensation, some qualification…'</p>
<p>Firmin shrugged his shoulders and assumed an expression of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_669">despair</a>. Meanwhile, he conveyed, one must eat.</p>
<p>For a time neither spoke, and the king ate and turned over in his</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_670">mind</a> the phrases of the speech he intended to make to the</p>
<p>conference. By <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_671">virtue</a> of the antiquity of his crown he was to</p>
<p>preside, and he intended to make his presidency <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_672">memorable</a>.</p>
<p>Reassured of his eloquence, he considered the despondent and</p>
<p>sulky Firmin for a space.</p>
<p>'Firmin,' he said, 'you have idealised kingship.' 'It has been</p>
<p>my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_673">dream</a>, sir,' said Firmin <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_674">sorrowfully</a>, 'to serve.'</p>
<p>'At the levers, Firmin,' said the king.</p>
<p>'You are <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_675">pleased</a> to be unjust,' said Firmin, deeply hurt.</p>
<p>'I am <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_676">pleased</a> to be getting out of it,' said the king.</p>
<p>'Oh, Firmin,' he went on, 'have you no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_677">thought</a> for me? Will you</p>
<p>never realise that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_678">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_679">am</a> not only flesh and blood but an</p>
<p>imagination-with its rights. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_678">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_679">am</a> a king in revolt against that</p>
<p>fetter they put upon my head. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_678">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_679">am</a> a king <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_680">awake</a>. My reverend</p>
<p>grandparents never in all their august lives had a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_681">waking</a> moment.</p>
<p>They loved the job that you, you advisers, gave them; they never</p>
<p>had a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_682">doubt</a> of it. It was like giving a doll to a woman who ought</p>
<p>to have a child. They delighted in processions and opening things</p>
<p>and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_683">being</a> read addresses to, and visiting triplets and</p>
<p>nonagenarians and all that sort of thing. Incredibly. They used</p>
<p>to keep albums of cuttings from all the illustrated papers</p>
<p>showing them at it, and if the press-cutting parcels <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_684">grew</a> thin</p>
<p>they were worried. It was all that ever worried them. But there</p>
<p>is something atavistic in me; I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_685">hark</a> back to unconstitutional</p>
<p>monarchs. They christened me too retrogressively, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_686">think</a>. I</p>
<p>wanted to get things done. I was bored. I might have fallen into</p>
<p>vice, most intelligent and energetic princes do, but the palace</p>
<p>precautions were unusually thorough. I was brought up in the</p>
<p>purest court the world has ever <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_687">seen</a>… Alertly pure… So I</p>
<p>read books, Firmin, and went about asking questions. The thing</p>
<p>was bound to happen to one of us sooner or later. Perhaps, too,</p>
<p>very likely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_688">I'm</a> not vicious. I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_686">think</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_678">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_679">am</a>.'</p>
<p>He reflected. 'No,' he said.</p>
<p>Firmin cleared his throat. 'I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_689">think</a> you are, sir,' he</p>
<p>said. 'You prefer--'</p>
<p>He stopped short. He had been going to say 'talking.' He</p>
<p>substituted 'ideas.'</p>
<p>'That world of royalty!' the king went on. 'In a little while no</p>
<p>one will <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_690">understand</a> it any more. It will become a riddle…</p>
<p>'Among other things, it was a world of perpetual best clothes.</p>
<p>Everything was in its best clothes for us, and usually wearing</p>
<p>bunting. With a cinema watching to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_691">see</a> we took it properly. If</p>
<p>you are a king, Firmin, and you go and look at a regiment, it</p>
<p>instantly stops whatever it is doing, changes into full uniform</p>
<p>and presents arms. When my august parents went in a train the</p>
<p>coal in the tender used to be whitened. It did, Firmin, and if</p>
<p>coal had been white instead of black I have no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_692">doubt</a> the</p>
<p>authorities would have blackened it. That was the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_693">spirit</a> of our</p>
<p>treatment. People were always walking about with their faces to</p>
<p>us. One never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_694">saw</a> anything in profile. One got an impression of</p>
<p>a world that was insanely focused on <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_695">ourselves</a>. And when I began</p>
<p>to poke my little questions into the Lord Chancellor and the</p>
<p>archbishop and all the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_696">rest</a> of them, about what I should <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_691">see</a> if</p>
<p>people turned round, the general <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_697">effect</a> I produced was that I</p>
<p>wasn't by any means displaying the Royal Tact they had expected</p>
<p>of me…'</p>
<p>He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_698">meditated</a> for a time.</p>
<p>'And yet, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_699">know</a>, there is something in the kingship, Firmin.</p>
<p>It stiffened up my august little grandfather. It gave my</p>
<p>grandmother a kind of awkward dignity even when she was</p>
<p>cross-and she was very often cross. They both had a profound</p>
<p>sense of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_700">responsibility</a>. My poor father's health was wretched</p>
<p>during his brief career; nobody outside the circle <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_701">knows</a> just how</p>
<p>he screwed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_702">himself</a> up to things. "My people expect it," he used</p>
<p>to say of this tiresome duty or that. Most of the things they</p>
<p>made him do were silly-it was part of a bad tradition, but there</p>
<p>was nothing silly in the way he set about them… The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_703">spirit</a> of</p>
<p>kingship is a fine thing, Firmin; I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_704">feel</a> it in my bones; I do not</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_699">know</a> what I might not be if I were not a king. I could die for my</p>
<p>people, Firmin, and you couldn't. No, don't say you could die for</p>
<p>me, because I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_699">know</a> better. Don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_705">think</a> I forget my kingship,</p>
<p>Firmin, don't imagine that. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_706">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_707">am</a> a king, a kingly king, by right</p>
<p>divine. The fact that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_706">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_707">am</a> also a chattering young man makes not</p>
<p>the slightest difference to that. But the proper text-book for</p>
<p>kings, Firmin, is none of the court memoirs and Welt-Politik</p>
<p>books you would have me read; it is old Fraser's Golden Bough.</p>
<p>Have you read that, Firmin?'</p>
<p>Firmin had. 'Those were the authentic kings. In the end they</p>
<p>were cut up and a bit given to everybody. They sprinkled the</p>
<p>nations-with Kingship.'</p>
<p>Firmin turned <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_708">himself</a> round and faced his royal master.</p>
<p>'What do you intend to do, sir?' he asked. 'If you will not</p>
<p>listen to me, what do you propose to do this afternoon?'</p>
<p>The king flicked crumbs from his coat.</p>
<p>'Manifestly war has to stop for ever, Firmin. Manifestly this</p>
<p>can only be done by putting all the world under one government.</p>
<p>Our crowns and flags are in the way. Manifestly they must go.'</p>
<p>'Yes, sir,' interrupted Firmin, 'but WHAT government? I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_709">see</a></p>
<p>what government you get by a universal abdication!'</p>
<p>'Well,' said the king, with his hands about his knees, 'WE shall</p>
<p>be the government.'</p>
<p>'The conference?' exclaimed Firmin.</p>
<p>'Who else?' asked the king simply.</p>
<p>'It's perfectly simple,' he added to Firmin's tremendous silence.</p>
<p>'But,' cried Firmin, 'you must have sanctions! Will there be no</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_710">form</a> of election, for example?'</p>
<p>'Why should there be?' asked the king, with intelligent</p>
<p>curiosity.</p>
<p>'The consent of the governed.'</p>
<p>'Firmin, we are just going to lay down our differences and take</p>
<p>over government. Without any election at all. Without any</p>
<p>sanction. The governed will show their consent by silence. If</p>
<p>any <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_711">effective</a> opposition arises we shall ask it to come in and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_712">help</a>. The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_713">true</a> sanction of kingship is the grip upon the sceptre.</p>
<p>We aren't going to worry people to vote for us. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_714">I'm</a> certain the</p>
<p>mass of men does not want to be bothered with such things…</p>
<p>We'll contrive a way for any one interested to join in. That's</p>
<p>quite enough in the way of democracy. Perhaps later-when things</p>
<p>don't matter… We shall govern all right, Firmin. Government</p>
<p>only becomes difficult when the lawyers get hold of it, and since</p>
<p>these troubles began the lawyers are shy. Indeed, come to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_715">think</a></p>
<p>of it, I wonder where all the lawyers are… Where are they? A</p>
<p>lot, of course, were bagged, some of the worst ones, when they</p>
<p>blew up my legislature. You never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_716">knew</a> the late Lord Chancellor.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>'Necessities bury rights. And create them. Lawyers live on dead</p>
<p>rights disinterred… We've done with that way of living. We</p>
<p>won't have more law than a code can cover and beyond that</p>
<p>government will be free…</p>
<p>'Before the sun sets to-day, Firmin, trust me, we shall have made</p>
<p>our abdications, all of us, and declared the World Republic,</p>
<p>supreme and indivisible. I wonder what my august grandmother</p>
<p>would have made of it! All my rights!… And then we shall go</p>
<p>on governing. What else is there to do? All over the world we</p>
<p>shall declare that there is no longer mine or thine, but ours.</p>
<p>China, the United States, two-thirds of Europe, will certainly</p>
<p>fall in and obey. They will have to do so. What else can they</p>
<p>do? Their official rulers are here with us. They won't be able</p>
<p>to get together any sort of idea of not obeying us… Then we</p>
<p>shall declare that every sort of property is held in trust for</p>
<p>the Republic…'</p>
<p>'But, sir!' cried Firmin, suddenly enlightened. 'Has this been</p>
<p>arranged already?'</p>
<p>'My dear Firmin, do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_717">think</a> we have come here, all of us, to</p>
<p>talk at large? The talking has been done for half a century.</p>
<p>Talking and writing. We are here to set the new thing, the</p>
<p>simple, obvious, necessary thing, going.'</p>
<p>He stood up.</p>
<p>Firmin, forgetting the habits of a score of years, remained</p>
<p>seated.</p>
<p>'WELL,' he said at last. 'And I have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_718">known</a> nothing!'</p>
<p>The king smiled very cheerfully. He liked these talks with</p>
<p>Firmin.</p>
<p>Section 3</p>
<p>That conference upon the Brissago meadows was one of the most</p>
<p>heterogeneous collections of prominent people that has ever met</p>
<p>together. Principalities and powers, stripped and shattered until</p>
<p>all their pride and mystery were gone, met in a marvellous new</p>
<p>humility. Here were kings and emperors whose capitals were lakes</p>
<p>of flaming destruction, statesmen whose countries had become</p>
<p>chaos, scared politicians and financial potentates. Here were</p>
<p>leaders of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_719">thought</a> and learned investigators dragged reluctantly</p>
<p>to the control of affairs. Altogether there were ninety-three of</p>
<p>them, Leblanc's conception of the head men of the world. They</p>
<p>had all come to the realisation of the simple <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_720">truths</a> that the</p>
<p>indefatigable Leblanc had hammered into them; and, drawing his</p>
<p>resources from the King of Italy, he had provisioned his</p>
<p>conference with a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_721">generous</a> simplicity quite in accordance with</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_722">rest</a> of his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_723">character</a>, and so at last was able to make his</p>
<p>astonishing and entirely rational appeal. He had appointed King</p>
<p>Egbert the president, he believed in this young man so firmly</p>
<p>that he completely dominated him, and he spoke <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_724">himself</a> as a</p>
<p>secretary might speak from the president's left hand, and</p>
<p>evidently did not realise <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_724">himself</a> that he was telling them all</p>
<p>exactly what they had to do. He imagined he was merely</p>
<p>recapitulating the obvious features of the situation for their</p>
<p>convenience. He was dressed in ill-fitting white silk clothes,</p>
<p>and he consulted a dingy little packet of notes as he spoke.</p>
<p>They put him out. He explained that he had never spoken from</p>
<p>notes before, but that this occasion was exceptional.</p>
<p>And then King Egbert spoke as he was expected to speak, and</p>
<p>Leblanc's spectacles moistened at that flow of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_725">generous</a></p>
<p>sentiment, most amiably and lightly expressed. 'We haven't to</p>
<p>stand on ceremony,' said the king, 'we have to govern the world.</p>
<p>We have always pretended to govern the world and here is our</p>
<p>opportunity.'</p>
<p>'Of course,' whispered Leblanc, nodding his head rapidly, 'of</p>
<p>course.'</p>
<p>'The world has been smashed up, and we have to put it on its</p>
<p>wheels again,' said King Egbert. 'And it is the simple common</p>
<p>sense of this crisis for all to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_726">help</a> and none to seek advantage.</p>
<p>Is that our tone or not?'</p>
<p>The gathering was too old and seasoned and miscellaneous for any</p>
<p>great displays of enthusiasm, but that was its tone, and with an</p>
<p>astonishment that somehow became exhilarating it began to resign,</p>
<p>repudiate, and declare its intentions. Firmin, taking notes</p>
<p>behind his master, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_727">heard</a> everything that had been foretold among</p>
<p>the yellow broom, come <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_728">true</a>. With a queer <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_729">feeling</a> that he was</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_730">dreaming</a>, he assisted at the proclamation of the World State, and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_731">saw</a> the message taken out to the wireless operators to be</p>
<p>throbbed all round the habitable globe. 'And next,' said King</p>
<p>Egbert, with a cheerful excitement in his voice, 'we have to get</p>
<p>every atom of Carolinum and all the plant for making it, into our</p>
<p>control…'</p>
<p>Firman was not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_732">alone</a> in his incredulity. Not a man there who was</p>
<p>not a very amiable, reasonable, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_733">benevolent</a> creature at bottom;</p>
<p>some had been born to power and some had happened upon it, some</p>
<p>had struggled to get it, not clearly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_734">knowing</a> what it was and what</p>
<p>it implied, but none was irreconcilably set upon its retention at</p>
<p>the price of cosmic disaster. Their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_735">minds</a> had been prepared by</p>
<p>circumstances and sedulously cultivated by Leblanc; and now they</p>
<p>took the broad obvious road along which King Egbert was leading</p>
<p>them, with a mingled conviction of strangeness and necessity.</p>
<p>Things went very smoothly; the King of Italy explained the</p>
<p>arrangements that had been made for the protection of the camp</p>
<p>from any fantastic attack; a couple of thousand of aeroplanes,</p>
<p>each carrying a sharpshooter, guarded them, and there was an</p>
<p>excellent system of relays, and at night all the sky would be</p>
<p>searched by scores of lights, and the admirable Leblanc gave</p>
<p>luminous reasons for their camping just where they were and going</p>
<p>on with their administrative duties forthwith. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_736">knew</a> of this</p>
<p>place, because he had happened upon it when holiday-making with</p>
<p>Madame Leblanc twenty years and more ago. 'There is very simple</p>
<p>fare at present,' he explained, 'on account of the disturbed</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_737">state</a> of the countries about us. But we have excellent fresh</p>
<p>milk, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_738">good</a> red wine, beef, bread, salad, and lemons… In a</p>
<p>few days I hope to place things in the hands of a more efficient</p>
<p>caterer…'</p>
<p>The members of the new world government dined at three long</p>
<p>tables on trestles, and down the middle of these tables Leblanc,</p>
<p>in spite of the barrenness of his menu, had contrived to have a</p>
<p>great multitude of beautiful roses. There was similar</p>
<p>accommodation for the secretaries and attendants at a lower level</p>
<p>down the mountain. The assembly dined as it had debated, in the</p>
<p>open air, and over the dark crags to the west the glowing June</p>
<p>sunset shone upon the banquet. There was no precedency now among</p>
<p>the ninety-three, and King Egbert found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_739">himself</a> between a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_740">pleasant</a> little Japanese stranger in spectacles and his cousin of</p>
<p>Central Europe, and opposite a great Bengali leader and the</p>
<p>President of the United States of America. Beyond the Japanese</p>
<p>was Holsten, the old chemist, and Leblanc was a little way down</p>
<p>the other side.</p>
<p>The king was still cheerfully talkative and abounded in ideas. He</p>
<p>fell presently into an amiable controversy with the American, who</p>
<p>seemed to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_741">feel</a> a lack of impressiveness in the occasion.</p>
<p>It was ever the Transatlantic tendency, due, no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_742">doubt</a>, to the</p>
<p>necessity of handling public questions in a bulky and striking</p>
<p>manner, to over-emphasise and over-accentuate, and the president</p>
<p>was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_743">touched</a> by his national failing. He suggested now that there</p>
<p>should be a new era, starting from that day as the first day of</p>
<p>the first year.</p>
<p>The king demurred.</p>
<p>'From this day forth, sir, man enters upon his heritage,' said</p>
<p>the American.</p>
<p>'Man,' said the king, 'is always entering upon his heritage. You</p>
<p>Americans have a peculiar weakness for anniversaries-if you will</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_744">forgive</a> me saying so. Yes-I accuse you of a lust for dramatic</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_745">effect</a>. Everything is happening always, but you want to say this</p>
<p>or this is the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_746">real</a> instant in time and subordinate all the</p>
<p>others to it.'</p>
<p>The American said something about an epoch-making day.</p>
<p>'But surely,' said the king, 'you don't want us to condemn all</p>
<p>humanity to a world-wide annual Fourth of July for ever and ever</p>
<p>more. On account of this harmless necessary day of declarations.</p>
<p>No conceivable day could ever deserve that. Ah! you do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_747">know</a>,</p>
<p>as I do, the devastations of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_748">memorable</a>. My poor grandparents</p>
<p>were-RUBRICATED. The worst of these huge celebrations is that</p>
<p>they break up the dignified succession of one's contemporary</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_749">emotions</a>. They interrupt. They set back. Suddenly out come the</p>
<p>flags and fireworks, and the old enthusiasms are furbished</p>
<p>up-and it's sheer destruction of the proper thing that ought to</p>
<p>be going on. Sufficient unto the day is the celebration thereof.</p>
<p>Let the dead past bury its dead. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_750">see</a>, in regard to the</p>
<p>calendar, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_751">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_752">am</a> for democracy and you are for aristocracy. All</p>
<p>things I hold, are august, and have a right to be lived through</p>
<p>on their merits. No day should be sacrificed on the grave of</p>
<p>departed events. What do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_753">think</a> of it, Wilhelm?'</p>
<p>'For the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_754">noble</a>, yes, all days should be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_754">noble</a>.'</p>
<p>'Exactly my position,' said the king, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_755">felt</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_756">pleased</a> at what he</p>
<p>had been saying.</p>
<p>And then, since the American pressed his idea, the king contrived</p>
<p>to shift the talk from the question of celebrating the epoch they</p>
<p>were making to the question of the probabilities that lay ahead.</p>
<p>Here every one became diffident. They could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_757">see</a> the world</p>
<p>unified and at peace, but what detail was to follow from that</p>
<p>unification they seemed indisposed to discuss. This diffidence</p>
<p>struck the king as remarkable. He plunged upon the possibilities</p>
<p>of science. All the huge expenditure that had hitherto gone into</p>
<p>unproductive naval and military preparations, must now, he</p>
<p>declared, place research upon a new footing. 'Where one man</p>
<p>worked we will have a thousand.' He appealed to Holsten. 'We</p>
<p>have only begun to peep into these possibilities,' he said. 'You</p>
<p>at any rate have sounded the vaults of the treasure house.'</p>
<p>'They are unfathomable,' smiled Holsten.</p>
<p>'Man,' said the American, with a manifest resolve to justify and</p>
<p>reinstate <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_758">himself</a> after the flickering contradictions of the</p>
<p>king, 'Man, I say, is only beginning to enter upon his heritage.'</p>
<p>'Tell us some of the things you believe we shall presently learn,</p>
<p>give us an idea of the things we may presently do,' said the king</p>
<p>to Holsten.</p>
<p>Holsten opened out the vistas…</p>
<p>'Science,' the king cried presently, 'is the new king of the</p>
<p>world.'</p>
<p>'OUR view,' said the president, 'is that sovereignty resides with</p>
<p>the people.'</p>
<p>'No!' said the king, 'the sovereign is a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_759">being</a> more subtle than</p>
<p>that. And less arithmetical. Neither my family nor your</p>
<p>emancipated people. It is something that floats about us, and</p>
<p>above us, and through us. It is that common impersonal will and</p>
<p>sense of necessity of which Science is the best <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_760">understood</a> and</p>
<p>most typical aspect. It is the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_761">mind</a> of the race. It is that</p>
<p>which has brought us here, which has bowed us all to its</p>
<p>demands…'</p>
<p>He paused and glanced down the table at Leblanc, and then</p>
<p>re-opened at his former antagonist.</p>
<p>'There is a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_762">disposition</a>,' said the king, 'to regard this</p>
<p>gathering as if it were actually doing what it appears to be</p>
<p>doing, as if we ninety-odd men of our own free will and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_763">wisdom</a></p>
<p>were unifying the world. There is a temptation to consider</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_764">ourselves</a> exceptionally fine fellows, and masterful men, and all</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_765">rest</a> of it. We are not. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_766">doubt</a> if we should average out as</p>
<p>anything abler than any other casually selected body of</p>
<p>ninety-odd men. We are no creators, we are consequences, we are</p>
<p>salvagers-or salvagees. The thing to-day is not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_764">ourselves</a> but</p>
<p>the wind of conviction that has blown us hither…'</p>
<p>The American had to confess he could hardly agree with the king's</p>
<p>estimate of their average.</p>
<p>'Holster, perhaps, and one or two others, might lift us a</p>
<p>little,' the king conceded. 'But the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_767">rest</a> of us?'</p>
<p>His eyes flitted once more towards Leblanc.</p>
<p>'Look at Leblanc,' he said. 'He's just a simple <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_768">soul</a>. There are</p>
<p>hundreds and thousands like him. I admit, a certain dexterity, a</p>
<p>certain lucidity, but there is not a country town in France where</p>
<p>there is not a Leblanc or so to be found about two o'clock in its</p>
<p>principal cafe. It's just that he isn't complicated or</p>
<p>Super-Mannish, or any of those things that has made all he has</p>
<p>done possible. But in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_769">happier</a> times, don't you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_770">think</a>, Wilhelm, he</p>
<p>would have remained just what his father was, a successful</p>
<p>epicier, very clean, very accurate, very honest. And on holidays</p>
<p>he would have gone out with Madame Leblanc and her knitting in a</p>
<p>punt with a jar of something gentle and have sat under a large</p>
<p>reasonable green-lined umbrella and fished very neatly and</p>
<p>successfully for gudgeon…'</p>
<p>The president and the Japanese prince in spectacles protested</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>'If I do him an injustice,' said the king, 'it is only because I</p>
<p>want to elucidate my argument. I want to make it clear how small</p>
<p>are men and days, and how great is man in comparison…'</p>
<p>Section 4</p>
<p>So it was King Egbert talked at Brissago after they had</p>
<p>proclaimed the unity of the world. Every evening after that the</p>
<p>assembly dined together and talked at their ease and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_771">grew</a></p>
<p>accustomed to each other and sharpened each other's ideas, and</p>
<p>every day they worked together, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_772">really</a> for a time believed</p>
<p>that they were inventing a new government for the world. They</p>
<p>discussed a constitution. But there were matters needing</p>
<p>attention too urgently to wait for any constitution. They</p>
<p>attended to these incidentally. The constitution it was that</p>
<p>waited. It was presently found convenient to keep the</p>
<p>constitution waiting indefinitely as King Egbert had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_773">foreseen</a>,</p>
<p>and meanwhile, with an increasing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_774">self-confidence</a>, that council</p>
<p>went on governing…</p>
<p>On this first evening of all the council's gatherings, after King</p>
<p>Egbert had talked for a long time and drunken and praised very</p>
<p>abundantly the simple red wine of the country that Leblanc had</p>
<p>procured for them, he fathered about him a group of congenial</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_775">spirits</a> and fell into a discourse upon simplicity, praising it</p>
<p>above all things and declaring that the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_776">ultimate</a> aim of art,</p>
<p>religion, philosophy, and science alike was to simplify. He</p>
<p>instanced <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_777">himself</a> as a devotee to simplicity. And Leblanc he</p>
<p>instanced as a crowning instance of the splendour of this</p>
<p>quality. Upon that they all agreed.</p>
<p>When at last the company about the tables broke up, the king</p>
<p>found <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_778">himself</a> brimming over with a peculiar affection and</p>
<p>admiration for Leblanc, he made his way to him and drew him aside</p>
<p>and broached what he declared was a small matter. There was, he</p>
<p>said, a certain order in his gift that, unlike all other orders</p>
<p>and decorations in the world, had never been corrupted. It was</p>
<p>reserved for elderly men of supreme distinction, the acuteness of</p>
<p>whose gifts was already <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_779">touched</a> to mellowness, and it had</p>
<p>included the greatest names of every age so far as the advisers</p>
<p>of his family had been able to ascertain them. At present, the</p>
<p>king admitted, these matters of stars and badges were rather</p>
<p>obscured by more urgent affairs, for his own part he had never</p>
<p>set any value upon them at all, but a time might come when they</p>
<p>would be at least interesting, and in short he wished to confer</p>
<p>the Order of Merit upon Leblanc. His sole motive in doing so, he</p>
<p>added, was his strong <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_780">desire</a> to signalise his personal esteem.</p>
<p>He laid his hand upon the Frenchman's shoulder as he said these</p>
<p>things, with an almost brotherly affection. Leblanc received this</p>
<p>proposal with a modest <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_781">confusion</a> that greatly enhanced the king's</p>
<p>opinion of his admirable simplicity. He pointed out that eager</p>
<p>as he was to snatch at the proffered distinction, it might at the</p>
<p>present stage appear invidious, and he therefore suggested that</p>
<p>the conferring of it should be postponed until it could be made</p>
<p>the crown and conclusion of his services. The king was unable to</p>
<p>shake this resolution, and the two men parted with expressions of</p>
<p>mutual esteem.</p>
<p>The king then summoned Firmin in order to make a short note of a</p>
<p>number of things that he had said during the day. But after about</p>
<p>twenty minutes' work the sweet sleepiness of the mountain air</p>
<p>overcame him, and he dismissed Firmin and went to bed and fell</p>
<p>asleep at once, and slept with extreme <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_782">satisfaction</a>. He had had</p>
<p>an active, agreeable day.</p>
<p>Section 5</p>
<p>The establishment of the new order that was thus so humanly</p>
<p>begun, was, if one measures it by the standard of any preceding</p>
<p>age, a rapid progress. The fighting <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_783">spirit</a> of the world was</p>
<p>exhausted. Only here or there did fierceness linger. For long</p>
<p>decades the combative side in human affairs had been monstrously</p>
<p>exaggerated by the accidents of political separation. This now</p>
<p>became luminously plain. An enormous proportion of the force that</p>
<p>sustained armaments had been nothing more aggressive than the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_784">fear</a> of war and warlike neighbours. It is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_785">doubtful</a> if any large</p>
<p>section of the men actually enlisted for fighting ever at any</p>
<p>time <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_786">really</a> hungered and thirsted for bloodshed and danger. That</p>
<p>kind of appetite was probably never very strong in the species</p>
<p>after the savage stage was past. The army was a profession, in</p>
<p>which killing had become a disagreeable possibility rather than</p>
<p>an eventful certainty. If one reads the old newspapers and</p>
<p>periodicals of that time, which did so much to keep militarism</p>
<p>alive, one finds very little about glory and adventure and a</p>
<p>constant harping on the disagreeableness of invasion and</p>
<p>subjugation. In one word, militarism was funk. The belligerent</p>
<p>resolution of the armed Europe of the twentieth century was the</p>
<p>resolution of a fiercely frightened sheep to plunge. And now that</p>
<p>its weapons were exploding in its hands, Europe was only too</p>
<p>eager to drop them, and abandon this fancied refuge of violence.</p>
<p>For a time the whole world had been shocked into frankness;</p>
<p>nearly all the clever people who had hitherto sustained the</p>
<p>ancient belligerent separations had now been brought to realise</p>
<p>the need for simplicity of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_787">attitude</a> and openness of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_788">mind</a>; and in</p>
<p>this atmosphere of moral renascence, there was little attempt to</p>
<p>get negotiable advantages out of resistance to the new order.</p>
<p>Human beings are foolish enough no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_789">doubt</a>, but few have stopped to</p>
<p>haggle in a fire-escape. The council had its way with them. The</p>
<p>band of 'patriots' who seized the laboratories and arsenal just</p>
<p>outside Osaka and tried to rouse Japan to revolt against</p>
<p>inclusion in the Republic of Mankind, found they had</p>
<p>miscalculated the national pride and met the swift vengeance of</p>
<p>their own countrymen. That fight in the arsenal was a vivid</p>
<p>incident in this closing chapter of the history of war. To the</p>
<p>last the 'patriots' were undecided whether, in the event of a</p>
<p>defeat, they would explode their supply of atomic bombs or not.</p>
<p>They were fighting with swords outside the iridium doors, and the</p>
<p>moderates of their number were at bay and on the verge of</p>
<p>destruction, only ten, indeed, remained unwounded, when the</p>
<p>republicans burst in to the rescue…</p>
<p>Section 6</p>
<p>One single monarch held out against the general acquiescence in</p>
<p>the new rule, and that was that strange survival of mediaevalism,</p>
<p>the 'Slavic Fox,' the King of the Balkans. He debated and</p>
<p>delayed his submissions. He showed an extraordinary combination</p>
<p>of cunning and temerity in his evasion of the repeated summonses</p>
<p>from Brissago. He affected ill-health and a great preoccupation</p>
<p>with his new official mistress, for his semi-barbaric court was</p>
<p>arranged on the best romantic models. His tactics were ably</p>
<p>seconded by Doctor Pestovitch, his chief minister. Failing to</p>
<p>establish his claims to complete independence, King Ferdinand</p>
<p>Charles annoyed the conference by a proposal to be treated as a</p>
<p>protected <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_790">state</a>. Finally he professed an unconvincing</p>
<p>submission, and put a mass of obstacles in the way of the</p>
<p>transfer of his national officials to the new government. In</p>
<p>these things he was enthusiastically supported by his subjects,</p>
<p>still for the most part an illiterate peasantry, passionately if</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_791">confusedly</a> patriotic, and so far with no practical <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_792">knowledge</a> of</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_793">effect</a> of atomic bombs. More particularly he retained control</p>
<p>of all the Balkan aeroplanes.</p>
<p>For once the extreme naivete of Leblanc seems to have been</p>
<p>mitigated by duplicity. He went on with the general pacification</p>
<p>of the world as if the Balkan submission was made in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_794">absolute</a></p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_795">good</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_796">faith</a>, and he announced the disbandment of the force of</p>
<p>aeroplanes that hitherto guarded the council at Brissago upon the</p>
<p>approaching fifteenth of July. But instead he doubled the number</p>
<p>upon duty on that eventful day, and made various arrangements for</p>
<p>their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_797">disposition</a>. He consulted certain experts, and when he took</p>
<p>King Egbert into his confidence there was something in his neat</p>
<p>and explicit <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_798">foresight</a> that brought back to that ex-monarch's</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_799">mind</a> his half-forgotten fantasy of Leblanc as a fisherman under a</p>
<p>green umbrella.</p>
<p>About five o'clock in the morning of the seventeenth of July one</p>
<p>of the outer sentinels of the Brissago fleet, which was soaring</p>
<p>unobtrusively over the lower end of the lake of Garda, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_800">sighted</a></p>
<p>and hailed a strange aeroplane that was flying westward, and,</p>
<p>failing to get a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_801">satisfactory</a> reply, set its wireless apparatus</p>
<p>talking and gave chase. A swarm of consorts appeared very</p>
<p>promptly over the westward mountains, and before the unknown</p>
<p>aeroplane had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_800">sighted</a> Como, it had a dozen eager attendants</p>
<p>closing in upon it. Its driver seems to have hesitated, dropped</p>
<p>down among the mountains, and then turned southward in flight,</p>
<p>only to find an intercepting biplane sweeping across his bows. He</p>
<p>then went round into the eye of the rising sun, and passed within</p>
<p>a hundred yards of his original pursuer.</p>
<p>The sharpshooter therein opened fire at once, and showed an</p>
<p>intelligent grasp of the situation by disabling the passenger</p>
<p>first. The man at the wheel must have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_802">heard</a> his companion cry out</p>
<p>behind him, but he was too intent on getting away to waste even a</p>
<p>glance behind. Twice after that he must have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_802">heard</a> shots. He let</p>
<p>his engine go, he crouched down, and for twenty minutes he must</p>
<p>have steered in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_803">continual</a> expectation of a bullet. It never</p>
<p>came, and when at last he glanced round, three great planes were</p>
<p>close upon him, and his companion, thrice hit, lay dead across</p>
<p>his bombs. His followers manifestly did not mean either to upset</p>
<p>or shoot him, but inexorably they drove him down, down. At last</p>
<p>he was curving and flying a hundred yards or less over the level</p>
<p>fields of rice and maize. Ahead of him and dark against the</p>
<p>morning sunrise was a village with a very tall and slender</p>
<p>campanile and a line of cable bearing metal standards that he</p>
<p>could not clear. He stopped his engine abruptly and dropped flat.</p>
<p>He may have hoped to get at the bombs when he came down, but his</p>
<p>pitiless pursuers drove right over him and shot him as he fell.</p>
<p>Three other aeroplanes curved down and came to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_804">rest</a> amidst grass</p>
<p>close by the smashed machine. Their passengers descended, and</p>
<p>ran, holding their light rifles in their hands towards the debris</p>
<p>and the two dead men. The coffin-shaped box that had occupied</p>
<p>the centre of the machine had broken, and three black <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_805">objects</a>,</p>
<p>each with two handles like the ears of a pitcher, lay peacefully</p>
<p>amidst the litter.</p>
<p>These <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_806">objects</a> were so tremendously important in the eyes of their</p>
<p>captors that they disregarded the two dead men who lay bloody and</p>
<p>broken amidst the wreckage as they might have disregarded dead</p>
<p>frogs by a country pathway.</p>
<p>'By God,' cried the first. 'Here they are!'</p>
<p>'And unbroken!' said the second.</p>
<p>'I've never <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_807">seen</a> the things before,' said the first.</p>
<p>'Bigger than I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_808">thought</a>,' said the second.</p>
<p>The third comer arrived. He stared for a moment at the bombs and</p>
<p>then turned his eyes to the dead man with a crushed chest who lay</p>
<p>in a muddy place among the green stems under the centre of the</p>
<p>machine.</p>
<p>'One can take no risks,' he said, with a faint suggestion of</p>
<p>apology.</p>
<p>The other two now also turned to the victims. 'We must signal,'</p>
<p>said the first man. A shadow passed between them and the sun,</p>
<p>and they looked up to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_809">see</a> the aeroplane that had fired the last</p>
<p>shot. 'Shall we signal?' came a megaphone hail.</p>
<p>'Three bombs,' they answered together.</p>
<p>'Where do they come from?' asked the megaphone.</p>
<p>The three sharpshooters looked at each other and then moved</p>
<p>towards the dead men. One of them had an idea. 'Signal that</p>
<p>first,' he said, 'while we look.' They were joined by their</p>
<p>aviators for the search, and all six men began a hunt that was</p>
<p>necessarily brutal in its haste, for some indication of identity.</p>
<p>They examined the men's pockets, their bloodstained clothes, the</p>
<p>machine, the framework. They turned the bodies over and flung</p>
<p>them aside. There was not a tattoo mark… Everything was</p>
<p>elaborately free of any indication of its origin.</p>
<p>'We can't find out!' they called at last.</p>
<p>'Not a sign?'</p>
<p>'Not a sign.'</p>
<p>'I'm coming down,' said the man overhead…</p>
<p>Section 7</p>
<p>The Slavic fox stood upon a metal balcony in his picturesque Art</p>
<p>Nouveau palace that gave upon the precipice that overhung his</p>
<p>bright little capital, and beside him stood Pestovitch, grizzled</p>
<p>and cunning, and now full of an ill-suppressed excitement. Behind</p>
<p>them the window opened into a large room, richly decorated in</p>
<p>aluminium and crimson enamel, across which the king, as he</p>
<p>glanced ever and again over his shoulder with a gesture of</p>
<p>inquiry, could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_810">see</a> through the two open doors of a little azure</p>
<p>walled antechamber the wireless operator in the turret working at</p>
<p>his incessant transcription. Two pompously uniformed messengers</p>
<p>waited listlessly in this apartment. The room was furnished with</p>
<p>a stately dignity, and had in the middle of it a big green</p>
<p>baize-covered table with the massive white metal inkpots and</p>
<p>antiquated sandboxes natural to a new but romantic monarchy. It</p>
<p>was the king's council chamber and about it now, in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_811">attitudes</a> of</p>
<p>suspended intrigue, stood the half-dozen ministers who</p>
<p>constituted his cabinet. They had been summoned for twelve</p>
<p>o'clock, but still at half-past twelve the king loitered in the</p>
<p>balcony and seemed to be waiting for some news that did not come.</p>
<p>The king and his minister had talked at first in whispers; they</p>
<p>had fallen silent, for they found little now to express except a</p>
<p>vague anxiety. Away there on the mountain side were the white</p>
<p>metal roofs of the long farm buildings beneath which the bomb</p>
<p>factory and the bombs were hidden. (The chemist who had made all</p>
<p>these for the king had died suddenly after the declaration of</p>
<p>Brissago.) Nobody <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_812">knew</a> of that store of mischief now but the king</p>
<p>and his adviser and three heavily <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_813">faithful</a> attendants; the</p>
<p>aviators who waited now in the midday blaze with their</p>
<p>bomb-carrying machines and their passenger bomb-throwers in the</p>
<p>exercising grounds of the motor-cyclist barracks below were still</p>
<p>in ignorance of the position of the ammunition they were</p>
<p>presently to take up. It was time they started if the scheme was</p>
<p>to work as Pestovitch had planned it. It was a magnificent plan.</p>
<p>It aimed at no less than the Empire of the World. The government</p>
<p>of idealists and professors away there at Brissago was to be</p>
<p>blown to fragments, and then east, west, north, and south those</p>
<p>aeroplanes would go swarming over a world that had disarmed</p>
<p>itself, to proclaim Ferdinand Charles, the new Caesar, the</p>
<p>Master, Lord of the Earth. It was a magnificent plan. But the</p>
<p>tension of this waiting for news of the success of the first blow</p>
<p>was-considerable.</p>
<p>The Slavic fox was of a pallid fairness, he had a remarkably long</p>
<p>nose, a thick, short moustache, and small blue eyes that were a</p>
<p>little too near together to be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_814">pleasant</a>. It was his habit to</p>
<p>worry his moustache with short, nervous tugs whenever his</p>
<p>restless <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_815">mind</a> troubled him, and now this motion was becoming so</p>
<p>incessant that it irked Pestovitch beyond the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_816">limits</a> of</p>
<p>endurance.</p>
<p>'I will go,' said the minister, 'and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_817">see</a> what the trouble is with</p>
<p>the wireless. They give us nothing, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_818">good</a> or bad.'</p>
<p>Left to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_819">himself</a>, the king could worry his moustache without</p>
<p>stint; he leant his elbows forward on the balcony and gave both</p>
<p>of his long white hands to the work, so that he looked like a</p>
<p>pale dog gnawing a bone. Suppose they caught his men, what</p>
<p>should he do? Suppose they caught his men?</p>
<p>The clocks in the light gold-capped belfries of the town below</p>
<p>presently intimated the half-hour after midday.</p>
<p>Of course, he and Pestovitch had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_820">thought</a> it out. Even if they</p>
<p>had caught those men, they were pledged to secrecy… Probably</p>
<p>they would be killed in the catching… One could deny anyhow,</p>
<p>deny and deny.</p>
<p>And then he became aware of half a dozen little shining specks</p>
<p>very high in the blue… Pestovitch came out to him presently.</p>
<p>'The government messages, sire, have all dropped into cipher,' he</p>
<p>said. 'I have set a man--'</p>
<p>'LOOK!' interrupted the king, and pointed upward with a long,</p>
<p>lean finger.</p>
<p>Pestovitch followed that indication and then glanced for one</p>
<p>questioning moment at the white face before him.</p>
<p>'We have to face it out, sire,' he said.</p>
<p>For some moments they watched the steep spirals of the descending</p>
<p>messengers, and then they began a hasty consultation…</p>
<p>They decided that to be holding a council upon the details of an</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_821">ultimate</a> surrender to Brissago was as innocent-looking a thing as</p>
<p>the king could well be doing, and so, when at last the ex-king</p>
<p>Egbert, whom the council had sent as its envoy, arrived upon the</p>
<p>scene, he discovered the king almost theatrically posed at the</p>
<p>head of his councillors in the midst of his court. The door upon</p>
<p>the wireless operators was shut.</p>
<p>The ex-king from Brissago came like a draught through the</p>
<p>curtains and attendants that gave a wide margin to King</p>
<p>Ferdinand's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_822">state</a>, and the familiar confidence of his manner</p>
<p>belied a certain hardness in his eye. Firmin trotted behind him,</p>
<p>and no one else was with him. And as Ferdinand Charles rose to</p>
<p>greet him, there came into the heart of the Balkan king again</p>
<p>that same chilly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_823">feeling</a> that he had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_824">felt</a> upon the balcony-and</p>
<p>it passed at the careless gestures of his guest. For surely any</p>
<p>one might outwit this foolish talker who, for a mere idea and at</p>
<p>the command of a little French rationalist in spectacles, had</p>
<p>thrown away the most ancient crown in all the world.</p>
<p>One must deny, deny…</p>
<p>And then slowly and quite tiresomely he realised that there was</p>
<p>nothing to deny. His visitor, with an amiable ease, went on</p>
<p>talking about everything in debate between <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_825">himself</a> and Brissago</p>
<p>except--.</p>
<p>Could it be that they had been delayed? Could it be that they</p>
<p>had had to drop for repairs and were still uncaptured? Could it</p>
<p>be that even now while this fool babbled, they were over there</p>
<p>among the mountains heaving their deadly charge over the side of</p>
<p>the aeroplane?</p>
<p>Strange hopes began to lift the tail of the Slavic fox again.</p>
<p>What was the man saying? One must talk to him anyhow until one</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_826">knew</a>. At any moment the little brass door behind him might open</p>
<p>with the news of Brissago blown to atoms. Then it would be a</p>
<p>delightful relief to the present tension to arrest this chatterer</p>
<p>forthwith. He might be killed perhaps. What?</p>
<p>The king was repeating his observation. 'They have a ridiculous</p>
<p>fancy that your confidence is based on the possession of atomic</p>
<p>bombs.'</p>
<p>King Ferdinand Charles pulled <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_827">himself</a> together. He protested.</p>
<p>'Oh, quite so,' said the ex-king, 'quite so.'</p>
<p>'What grounds?' The ex-king permitted <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_828">himself</a> a gesture and the</p>
<p>ghost of a chuckle-why the devil should he chuckle? 'Practically</p>
<p>none,' he said. 'But of course with these things one has to be</p>
<p>so careful.'</p>
<p>And then again for an instant something-like the faintest shadow</p>
<p>of derision-gleamed out of the envoy's eyes and recalled that</p>
<p>chilly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_829">feeling</a> to King Ferdinand's spine.</p>
<p>Some kindred <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_830">depression</a> had come to Pestovitch, who had been</p>
<p>watching the drawn intensity of Firmin's face. He came to the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_831">help</a> of his master, who, he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_832">feared</a>, might protest too much.</p>
<p>'A search!' cried the king. 'An embargo on our aeroplanes.'</p>
<p>'Only a temporary expedient,' said the ex-king Egbert, 'while the</p>
<p>search is going on.'</p>
<p>The king appealed to his council.</p>
<p>'The people will never permit it, sire,' said a bustling little</p>
<p>man in a gorgeous uniform.</p>
<p>'You'll have to make 'em,' said the ex-king, genially addressing</p>
<p>all the councillors.</p>
<p>King Ferdinand glanced at the closed brass door through which no</p>
<p>news would come.</p>
<p>'When would you want to have this search?'</p>
<p>The ex-king was radiant. 'We couldn't possibly do it until the</p>
<p>day after to-morrow,' he said.</p>
<p>'Just the capital?'</p>
<p>'Where else?' asked the ex-king, still more cheerfully.</p>
<p>'For my own part,' said the ex-king confidentially, 'I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_833">think</a> the</p>
<p>whole business ridiculous. Who would be such a fool as to hide</p>
<p>atomic bombs? Nobody. Certain hanging if he's caught-certain,</p>
<p>and almost certain blowing up if he isn't. But nowadays I have to</p>
<p>take orders like the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_834">rest</a> of the world. And here <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_835">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_836">am</a>.'</p>
<p>The king <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_837">thought</a> he had never met such detestable geniality. He</p>
<p>glanced at Pestovitch, who nodded almost imperceptibly. It was</p>
<p>well, anyhow, to have a fool to deal with. They might have sent a</p>
<p>diplomatist. 'Of course,' said the king, 'I recognise the</p>
<p>overpowering force-and a kind of logic-in these orders from</p>
<p>Brissago.'</p>
<p>'I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_838">knew</a> you would,' said the ex-king, with an air of relief, 'and</p>
<p>so let us arrange--'</p>
<p>They arranged with a certain informality. No Balkan aeroplane</p>
<p>was to adventure into the air until the search was concluded, and</p>
<p>meanwhile the fleets of the world government would soar and</p>
<p>circle in the sky. The towns were to be placarded with offers of</p>
<p>reward to any one who would <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_839">help</a> in the discovery of atomic</p>
<p>bombs…</p>
<p>'You will sign that,' said the ex-king.</p>
<p>'Why?'</p>
<p>'To show that we aren't in any way hostile to you.'</p>
<p>Pestovitch nodded 'yes' to his master.</p>
<p>'And then, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_840">see</a>,' said the ex-king in that easy way of his,</p>
<p>'we'll have a lot of men here, borrow <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_841">help</a> from your police, and</p>
<p>run through all your things. And then everything will be over.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if I may be your guest…' When presently Pestovitch</p>
<p>was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_842">alone</a> with the king again, he found him in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_843">state</a> of</p>
<p>jangling <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_844">emotions</a>. His <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_845">spirit</a> was tossing like a wind-whipped</p>
<p>sea. One moment he was exalted and full of contempt for 'that</p>
<p>ass' and his search; the next he was down in a pit of dread.</p>
<p>'They will find them, Pestovitch, and then he'll hang us.'</p>
<p>'Hang us?'</p>
<p>The king put his long nose into his councillor's face. 'That</p>
<p>grinning brute WANTS to hang us,' he said. 'And hang us he will,</p>
<p>if we give him a shadow of a chance.'</p>
<p>'But all their Modern State Civilisation!'</p>
<p>'Do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_846">think</a> there's any <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_847">pity</a> in that crew of Godless,</p>
<p>Vivisecting Prigs?' cried this last king of romance. 'Do you</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_846">think</a>, Pestovitch, they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_848">understand</a> anything of a high ambition or</p>
<p>a splendid <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_849">dream</a>? Do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_846">think</a> that our gallant and sublime</p>
<p>adventure has any appeal to them? Here am I, the last and</p>
<p>greatest and most romantic of the Caesars, and do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_846">think</a> they</p>
<p>will miss the chance of hanging me like a dog if they can,</p>
<p>killing me like a rat in a hole? And that renegade! He who was</p>
<p>once an anointed king!…</p>
<p>'I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_850">hate</a> that sort of eye that laughs and keeps hard,' said the</p>
<p>king.</p>
<p>'I won't sit still here and be caught like a fascinated rabbit,'</p>
<p>said the king in conclusion. 'We must shift those bombs.'</p>
<p>'Risk it,' said Pestovitch. 'Leave them <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_851">alone</a>.'</p>
<p>'No,' said the king. 'Shift them near the frontier. Then while</p>
<p>they watch us here-they will always watch us here now-we can</p>
<p>buy an aeroplane abroad, and pick them up…'</p>
<p>The king was in a feverish, irritable mood all that evening, but</p>
<p>he made his plans nevertheless with infinite cunning. They must</p>
<p>get the bombs away; there must be a couple of atomic hay lorries,</p>
<p>the bombs could be hidden under the hay… Pestovitch went and</p>
<p>came, instructing trusty servants, planning and replanning…</p>
<p>The king and the ex-king talked very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_852">pleasantly</a> of a number of</p>
<p>subjects. All the while at the back of King Ferdinand Charles's</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_853">mind</a> fretted the mystery of his vanished aeroplane. There came no</p>
<p>news of its capture, and no news of its success. At any moment</p>
<p>all that power at the back of his visitor might crumble away and</p>
<p>vanish…</p>
<p>It was past midnight, when the king, in a cloak and slouch hat</p>
<p>that might equally have served a small farmer, or any respectable</p>
<p>middle-class man, slipped out from an inconspicuous service gate</p>
<p>on the eastward side of his palace into the thickly wooded</p>
<p>gardens that sloped in a series of terraces down to the town.</p>
<p>Pestovitch and his guard-valet Peter, both wrapped about in a</p>
<p>similar disguise, came out among the laurels that bordered the</p>
<p>pathway and joined him. It was a clear, warm night, but the stars</p>
<p>seemed unusually little and remote because of the aeroplanes,</p>
<p>each trailing a searchlight, that drove hither and thither across</p>
<p>the blue. One great beam seemed to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_854">rest</a> on the king for a moment</p>
<p>as he came out of the palace; then instantly and reassuringly it</p>
<p>had swept away. But while they were still in the palace gardens</p>
<p>another found them and looked at them.</p>
<p>'They <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_855">see</a> us,' cried the king.</p>
<p>'They make nothing of us,' said Pestovitch.</p>
<p>The king glanced up and met a calm, round eye of light, that</p>
<p>seemed to wink at him and vanish, leaving him blinded…</p>
<p>The three men went on their way. Near the little gate in the</p>
<p>garden railings that Pestovitch had caused to be unlocked, the</p>
<p>king paused under the shadow of an flex and looked back at the</p>
<p>place. It was very high and narrow, a twentieth-century rendering</p>
<p>of mediaevalism, mediaevalism in steel and bronze and sham stone</p>
<p>and opaque glass. Against the sky it splashed a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_856">confusion</a> of</p>
<p>pinnacles. High up in the eastward wing were the windows of the</p>
<p>apartments of the ex-king Egbert. One of them was brightly lit</p>
<p>now, and against the light a little black figure stood very still</p>
<p>and looked out upon the night.</p>
<p>The king snarled.</p>
<p>'He little <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_857">knows</a> how we slip through his fingers,' said</p>
<p>Pestovitch.</p>
<p>And as he spoke they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_858">saw</a> the ex-king stretch out his arms slowly,</p>
<p>like one who yawns, knuckle his eyes and turn inward-no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_859">doubt</a> to</p>
<p>his bed.</p>
<p>Down through the ancient winding back streets of his capital</p>
<p>hurried the king, and at an appointed corner a shabby</p>
<p>atomic-automobile waited for the three. It was a hackney</p>
<p>carriage of the lowest grade, with dinted metal panels and</p>
<p>deflated cushions. The driver was one of the ordinary drivers of</p>
<p>the capital, but beside him sat the young secretary of</p>
<p>Pestovitch, who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_860">knew</a> the way to the farm where the bombs were</p>
<p>hidden.</p>
<p>The automobile made its way through the narrow streets of the old</p>
<p>town, which were still lit and uneasy-for the fleet of airships</p>
<p>overhead had kept the cafes open and people abroad-over the</p>
<p>great new bridge, and so by straggling outskirts to the country.</p>
<p>And all through his capital the king who hoped to outdo Caesar,</p>
<p>sat back and was very still, and no one spoke. And as they got</p>
<p>out into the dark country they became aware of the searchlights</p>
<p>wandering over the country-side like the uneasy ghosts of giants.</p>
<p>The king sat forward and looked at these flitting whitenesses,</p>
<p>and every now and then peered up to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_861">see</a> the flying ships</p>
<p>overhead.</p>
<p>'I don't like them,' said the king.</p>
<p>Presently one of these patches of moonlight came to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_862">rest</a> about</p>
<p>them and seemed to be following their automobile. The king drew</p>
<p>back.</p>
<p>'The things are confoundedly noiseless,' said the king. 'It's</p>
<p>like <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_863">being</a> stalked by lean white cats.'</p>
<p>He peered again. 'That fellow is watching us,' he said.</p>
<p>And then suddenly he gave way to panic. 'Pestovitch,' he said,</p>
<p>clutching his minister's arm, 'they are watching us. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_864">I'm</a> not</p>
<p>going through with this. They are watching us. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_864">I'm</a> going back.'</p>
<p>Pestovitch remonstrated. 'Tell him to go back,' said the king,</p>
<p>and tried to open the window. For a few moments there was a grim</p>
<p>struggle in the automobile; a gripping of wrists and a blow. 'I</p>
<p>can't go through with it,' repeated the king, 'I can't go through</p>
<p>with it.'</p>
<p>'But they'll hang us,' said Pestovitch.</p>
<p>'Not if we were to give up now. Not if we were to surrender the</p>
<p>bombs. It is you who brought me into this…'</p>
<p>At last Pestovitch compromised. There was an inn perhaps half a</p>
<p>mile from the farm. They could alight there and the king could</p>
<p>get brandy, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_865">rest</a> his nerves for a time. And if he still</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_866">thought</a> fit to go back he could go back.</p>
<p>'See,' said Pestovitch, 'the light has gone again.'</p>
<p>The king peered up. 'I believe he's following us without a</p>
<p>light,' said the king.</p>
<p>In the little old dirty inn the king hung <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_867">doubtful</a> for a time,</p>
<p>and was for going back and throwing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_868">himself</a> on the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_869">mercy</a> of the</p>
<p>council. 'If there is a council,' said Pestovitch. 'By this time</p>
<p>your bombs may have settled it.</p>
<p>'But if so, these infernal aeroplanes would go.'</p>
<p>'They may not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_870">know</a> yet.'</p>
<p>'But, Pestovitch, why couldn't you do all this without me?'</p>
<p>Pestovitch made no answer for a moment. 'I was for leaving the</p>
<p>bombs in their place,' he said at last, and went to the window.</p>
<p>About their conveyance shone a circle of bright light. Pestovitch</p>
<p>had a brilliant idea. 'I will send my secretary out to make a</p>
<p>kind of dispute with the driver. Something that will make them</p>
<p>watch up above there. Meanwhile you and I and Peter will go out</p>
<p>by the back way and up by the hedges to the farm…'</p>
<p>It was worthy of his subtle reputation and it answered passing</p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>In ten minutes they were tumbling over the wall of the farm-yard,</p>
<p>wet, muddy, and breathless, but unobserved. But as they ran</p>
<p>towards the barns the king gave vent to something between a groan</p>
<p>and a curse, and all about them shone the light-and passed.</p>
<p>But had it passed at once or lingered for just a second?</p>
<p>'They didn't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_871">see</a> us,' said Peter.</p>
<p>'I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_872">think</a> they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_873">saw</a> us,' said the king, and stared as the</p>
<p>light went swooping up the mountain side, hung for a second about</p>
<p>a hayrick, and then came pouring back.</p>
<p>'In the barn!' cried the king.</p>
<p>He bruised his shin against something, and then all three men</p>
<p>were inside the huge steel-girdered barn in which stood the two</p>
<p>motor hay lorries that were to take the bombs away. Kurt and</p>
<p>Abel, the two brothers of Peter, had brought the lorries thither</p>
<p>in daylight. They had the upper half of the loads of hay thrown</p>
<p>off, ready to cover the bombs, so soon as the king should show</p>
<p>the hiding-place. 'There's a sort of pit here,' said the king.</p>
<p>'Don't light another lantern. This key of mine releases a</p>
<p>ring…'</p>
<p>For a time scarcely a word was spoken in the darkness of the</p>
<p>barn. There was the sound of a slab <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_874">being</a> lifted and then of feet</p>
<p>descending a ladder into a pit. Then whispering and then heavy</p>
<p>breathing as Kurt came struggling up with the first of the hidden</p>
<p>bombs.</p>
<p>'We shall do it yet,' said the king. And then he gasped. 'Curse</p>
<p>that light. Why in the name of Heaven didn't we shut the barn</p>
<p>door?' For the great door stood wide open and all the empty,</p>
<p>lifeless yard outside and the door and six feet of the floor of</p>
<p>the barn were in the blue glare of an inquiring searchlight.</p>
<p>'Shut the door, Peter,' said Pestovitch.</p>
<p>'No,' cried the king, too late, as Peter went forward into the</p>
<p>light. 'Don't show <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_875">yourself</a>!' cried the king. Kurt made a step</p>
<p>forward and plucked his brother back. For a time all five men</p>
<p>stood still. It seemed that light would never go and then</p>
<p>abruptly it was turned off, leaving them blinded. 'Now,' said</p>
<p>the king uneasily, 'now shut the door.'</p>
<p>'Not completely,' cried Pestovitch. 'Leave a chink for us to go</p>
<p>out by…'</p>
<p>It was hot work shifting those bombs, and the king worked for a</p>
<p>time like a common man. Kurt and Abel carried the great things</p>
<p>up and Peter brought them to the carts, and the king and</p>
<p>Pestovitch <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_876">helped</a> him to place them among the hay. They made as</p>
<p>little noise as they could…</p>
<p>'Ssh!' cried the king. 'What's that?'</p>
<p>But Kurt and Abel did not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_877">hear</a>, and came blundering up the ladder</p>
<p>with the last of the load.</p>
<p>'Ssh!' Peter ran forward to them with a whispered remonstrance.</p>
<p>Now they were still.</p>
<p>The barn door opened a little wider, and against the dim blue</p>
<p>light outside they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_878">saw</a> the black shape of a man.</p>
<p>'Any one here?' he asked, speaking with an Italian accent.</p>
<p>The king broke into a cold perspiration. Then Pestovitch</p>
<p>answered: 'Only a poor farmer loading hay,' he said, and picked</p>
<p>up a huge hay fork and went forward softly.</p>
<p>'You load your hay at a very bad time and in a very bad light,'</p>
<p>said the man at the door, peering in. 'Have you no electric</p>
<p>light here?'</p>
<p>Then suddenly he turned on an electric torch, and as he did so</p>
<p>Pestovitch sprang forward. 'Get out of my barn!' he cried, and</p>
<p>drove the fork full at the intruder's chest. He had a vague idea</p>
<p>that so he might stab the man to silence. But the man shouted</p>
<p>loudly as the prongs pierced him and drove him backward, and</p>
<p>instantly there was a sound of feet running across the yard.</p>
<p>'Bombs,' cried the man upon the ground, struggling with the</p>
<p>prongs in his hand, and as Pestovitch staggered forward into view</p>
<p>with the force of his own thrust, he was shot through the body by</p>
<p>one of the two new-comers.</p>
<p>The man on the ground was badly hurt but plucky. 'Bombs,' he</p>
<p>repeated, and struggled up into a kneeling position and held his</p>
<p>electric torch full upon the face of the king. 'Shoot them,' he</p>
<p>cried, coughing and spitting blood, so that the halo of light</p>
<p>round the king's head danced about.</p>
<p>For a moment in that shivering circle of light the two men <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_879">saw</a></p>
<p>the king kneeling up in the cart and Peter on the barn floor</p>
<p>beside him. The old fox looked at them sideways-snared, a</p>
<p>white-faced evil thing. And then, as with a faltering suicidal</p>
<p>heroism, he leant forward over the bomb before him, they fired</p>
<p>together and shot him through the head.</p>
<p>The upper part of his face seemed to vanish.</p>
<p>'Shoot them,' cried the man who had been stabbed. 'Shoot them</p>
<p>all!'</p>
<p>And then his light went out, and he rolled over with a groan at</p>
<p>the feet of his comrades.</p>
<p>But each carried a light of his own, and in another moment</p>
<p>everything in the barn was visible again. They shot Peter even</p>
<p>as he held up his hands in sign of surrender.</p>
<p>Kurt and Abel at the head of the ladder hesitated for a moment,</p>
<p>and then plunged backward into the pit. 'If we don't kill them,'</p>
<p>said one of the sharpshooters, 'they'll blow us to rags. They've</p>
<p>gone down that hatchway. Come!…</p>
<p>'Here they are. Hands up! I say. Hold your light while I</p>
<p>shoot…'</p>
<p>Section 8</p>
<p>It was still quite dark when his valet and Firmin came together</p>
<p>and told the ex-king Egbert that the business was settled.</p>
<p>He started up into a sitting position on the side of his bed.</p>
<p>'Did he go out?' asked the ex-king.</p>
<p>'He is dead,' said Firmin. 'He was shot.'</p>
<p>The ex-king reflected. 'That's about the best thing that could</p>
<p>have happened,' he said. 'Where are the bombs? In that</p>
<p>farm-house on the opposite hill-side! Why! the place is in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_880">sight</a>!</p>
<p>Let us go. I'll dress. Is there any one in the place, Firmin, to</p>
<p>get us a cup of coffee?'</p>
<p>Through the hungry twilight of the dawn the ex-king's automobile</p>
<p>carried him to the farm-house where the last rebel king was lying</p>
<p>among his bombs. The rim of the sky flashed, the east <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_881">grew</a></p>
<p>bright, and the sun was just rising over the hills when King</p>
<p>Egbert reached the farm-yard. There he found the hay lorries</p>
<p>drawn out from the barn with the dreadful bombs still packed upon</p>
<p>them. A couple of score of aviators held the yard, and outside a</p>
<p>few peasants stood in a little group and stared, ignorant as yet</p>
<p>of what had happened. Against the stone wall of the farm-yard</p>
<p>five bodies were lying neatly side by side, and Pestovitch had an</p>
<p>expression of surprise on his face and the king was chiefly</p>
<p>identifiable by his long white hands and his blonde moustache.</p>
<p>The wounded aeronaut had been carried down to the inn. And after</p>
<p>the ex-king had given directions in what manner the bombs were to</p>
<p>be taken to the new special laboratories above Zurich, where they</p>
<p>could be unpacked in an atmosphere of chlorine, he turned to</p>
<p>these five still shapes.</p>
<p>Their five pairs of feet stuck out with a curious stiff</p>
<p>unanimity…</p>
<p>'What else was there to do?' he said in answer to some internal</p>
<p>protest.</p>
<p>'I wonder, Firmin, if there are any more of them?'</p>
<p>'Bombs, sir?' asked Firmin.</p>
<p>'No, such kings…</p>
<p>'The pitiful folly of it!' said the ex-king, following his</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_882">thoughts</a>. 'Firmin,' as an ex-professor of International Politics,</p>
<p>I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_883">think</a> it falls to you to bury them. There?… No, don't put</p>
<p>them near the well. People will have to drink from that well.</p>
<p>Bury them over there, some way off in the field.'</p>

<p>CHAPTER THE FOURTH</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THE NEW PHASE</p>
</title>
<p>Section 1</p>
<p>The task that lay before the Assembly of Brissago, viewed as we</p>
<p>may view it now from the clarifying standpoint of things</p>
<p>accomplished, was in its broad issues a simple one. Essentially</p>
<p>it was to place social organisation upon the new footing that the</p>
<p>swift, accelerated advance of human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_884">knowledge</a> had rendered</p>
<p>necessary. The council was gathered together with the haste of a</p>
<p>salvage expedition, and it was confronted with wreckage; but the</p>
<p>wreckage was irreparable wreckage, and the only possibilities of</p>
<p>the case were either the relapse of mankind to the agricultural</p>
<p>barbarism from which it had emerged so <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_885">painfully</a> or the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_886">acceptance</a> of achieved science as the basis of a new social</p>
<p>order. The old tendencies of human nature, suspicion, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_887">jealousy</a>,</p>
<p>particularism, and belligerency, were incompatible with the</p>
<p>monstrous destructive power of the new appliances the inhuman</p>
<p>logic of science had produced. The equilibrium could be restored</p>
<p>only by civilisation destroying itself down to a level at which</p>
<p>modern apparatus could no longer be produced, or by human nature</p>
<p>adapting itself in its institutions to the new <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_888">conditions</a>. It was</p>
<p>for the latter alternative that the assembly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_889">existed</a>.</p>
<p>Sooner or later this choice would have confronted mankind. The</p>
<p>sudden development of atomic science did but precipitate and</p>
<p>render rapid and dramatic a clash between the new and the</p>
<p>customary that had been gathering since ever the first flint was</p>
<p>chipped or the first fire built together. From the day when man</p>
<p>contrived <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_890">himself</a> a tool and suffered another male to draw near</p>
<p>him, he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_891">ceased</a> to be altogether a thing of instinct and</p>
<p>untroubled convictions. From that day forth a widening breach can</p>
<p>be traced between his egotistical passions and the social need.</p>
<p>Slowly he adapted <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_890">himself</a> to the life of the homestead, and his</p>
<p>passionate impulses widened out to the demands of the clan and</p>
<p>the tribe. But widen though his impulses might, the latent hunter</p>
<p>and wanderer and wonderer in his imagination outstripped their</p>
<p>development. He was never quite subdued to the soil nor quite</p>
<p>tamed to the home. Everywhere it needed teaching and the priest</p>
<p>to keep him within the bounds of the plough-life and the</p>
<p>beast-tending. Slowly a vast system of traditional imperatives</p>
<p>superposed itself upon his instincts, imperatives that were</p>
<p>admirably fitted to make him that cultivator, that cattle-mincer,</p>
<p>who was for twice ten thousand years the normal man.</p>
<p>And, unpremeditated, undesired, out of the accumulations of his</p>
<p>tilling came civilisation. Civilisation was the agricultural</p>
<p>surplus. It appeared as trade and tracks and roads, it pushed</p>
<p>boats out upon the rivers and presently invaded the seas, and</p>
<p>within its primitive courts, within temples <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_892">grown</a> rich and</p>
<p>leisurely and amidst the gathering medley of the seaport towns</p>
<p>rose speculation and philosophy and science, and the beginning of</p>
<p>the new order that has at last established itself as human life.</p>
<p>Slowly at first, as we traced it, and then with an accumulating</p>
<p>velocity, the new powers were fabricated. Man as a whole did not</p>
<p>seek them nor <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_893">desire</a> them; they were thrust into his hand. For a</p>
<p>time men took up and used these new things and the new powers</p>
<p>inadvertently as they came to him, recking nothing of the</p>
<p>consequences. For endless generations change led him very</p>
<p>gently. But when he had been led far enough, change quickened the</p>
<p>pace. It was with a series of shocks that he realised at last</p>
<p>that he was living the old life less and less and a new life more</p>
<p>and more.</p>
<p>Already before the release of atomic energy the tensions between</p>
<p>the old way of living and the new were intense. They were far</p>
<p>intenser than they had been even at the collapse of the Roman</p>
<p>imperial system. On the one hand was the ancient life of the</p>
<p>family and the small community and the petty industry, on the</p>
<p>other was a new life on a larger scale, with remoter horizons and</p>
<p>a strange sense of purpose. Already it was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_894">growing</a> clear that men</p>
<p>must live on one side or the other. One could not have little</p>
<p>tradespeople and syndicated businesses in the same market,</p>
<p>sleeping carters and motor trolleys on the same road, bows and</p>
<p>arrows and aeroplane sharpshooters in the same army, or</p>
<p>illiterate peasant industries and power-driven factories in the</p>
<p>same world. And still less it was possible that one could have</p>
<p>the ideas and ambitions and greed and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_895">jealousy</a> of peasants</p>
<p>equipped with the vast appliances of the new age. If there had</p>
<p>been no atomic bombs to bring together most of the directing</p>
<p>intelligence of the world to that hasty conference at Brissago,</p>
<p>there would still have been, extended over great areas and a</p>
<p>considerable space of time perhaps, a less formal conference of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_896">responsible</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_897">understanding</a> people upon the perplexities of</p>
<p>this world-wide opposition. If the work of Holsten had been</p>
<p>spread over centuries and imparted to the world by imperceptible</p>
<p>degrees, it would nevertheless have made it necessary for men to</p>
<p>take counsel upon and set a plan for the future. Indeed already</p>
<p>there had been accumulating for a hundred years before the crisis</p>
<p>a literature of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_898">foresight</a>; there was a whole mass of 'Modern</p>
<p>State' scheming available for the conference to go upon. These</p>
<p>bombs did but accentuate and dramatise an already developing</p>
<p>problem.</p>
<p>Section 2</p>
<p>This assembly was no leap of exceptional <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_899">minds</a> and</p>
<p>super-intelligences into the control of affairs. It was</p>
<p>teachable, its members trailed ideas with them to the gathering,</p>
<p>but these were the consequences of the 'moral shock' the bombs</p>
<p>had given humanity, and there is no reason for supposing its</p>
<p>individual personalities were greatly above the average. It</p>
<p>would be possible to cite a thousand instances of error and</p>
<p>inefficiency in its proceedings due to the forgetfulness,</p>
<p>irritability, or fatigue of its members. It experimented</p>
<p>considerably and blundered often. Excepting Holsten, whose gift</p>
<p>was highly specialised, it is questionable whether there was a</p>
<p>single man of the first order of human quality in the gathering.</p>
<p>But it had a modest <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_900">fear</a> of itself, and a consequent directness</p>
<p>that gave it a general distinction. There was, of course, a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_901">noble</a> simplicity about Leblanc, but even of him it may be asked</p>
<p>whether he was not rather <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_902">good</a> and honest-minded than in the</p>
<p>fuller sense great.</p>
<p>The ex-king had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_903">wisdom</a> and a certain romantic dash, he was a man</p>
<p>among thousands, even if he was not a man among millions, but his</p>
<p>memoirs, and indeed his decision to write memoirs, give the</p>
<p>quality of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_904">himself</a> and his associates. The book makes admirable</p>
<p>but astonishing reading. Therein he takes the great work the</p>
<p>council was doing for granted as a little child takes God. It is</p>
<p>as if he had no sense of it at all. He tells amusing trivialities</p>
<p>about his cousin Wilhelm and his secretary Firmin, he pokes fun</p>
<p>at the American president, who was, indeed, rather a little</p>
<p>accident of the political machine than a representative American,</p>
<p>and he gives a long description of how he was lost for three days</p>
<p>in the mountains in the company of the only Japanese member, a</p>
<p>loss that seems to have caused no serious interruption of the</p>
<p>work of the council…</p>
<p>The Brissago conference has been written about time after time,</p>
<p>as though it were a gathering of the very flower of humanity.</p>
<p>Perched up there by the freak or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_905">wisdom</a> of Leblanc, it had a</p>
<p>certain Olympian quality, and the natural tendency of the human</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_906">mind</a> to elaborate such a resemblance would have us give its</p>
<p>members the likenesses of gods. It would be equally reasonable</p>
<p>to compare it to one of those enforced meetings upon the</p>
<p>mountain-tops that must have occurred in the opening phases of</p>
<p>the Deluge. The strength of the council lay not in itself but in</p>
<p>the circumstances that had quickened its intelligence, dispelled</p>
<p>its vanities, and emancipated it from traditional ambitions and</p>
<p>antagonisms. It was stripped of the accumulation of centuries, a</p>
<p>naked government with all that freedom of action that nakedness</p>
<p>affords. And its problems were set before it with a plainness</p>
<p>that was out of all comparison with the complicated and</p>
<p>perplexing intimations of the former time.</p>
<p>Section 3</p>
<p>The world on which the council looked did indeed present a task</p>
<p>quite sufficiently immense and altogether too urgent for any</p>
<p>wanton indulgence in internal dissension. It may be interesting</p>
<p>to sketch in a few phrases the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_907">condition</a> of mankind at the close</p>
<p>of the period of warring <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_908">states</a>, in the year of crisis that</p>
<p>followed the release of atomic power. It was a world</p>
<p>extraordinarily <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_909">limited</a> when one measures it by later standards,</p>
<p>and it was now in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_908">state</a> of the direst <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_910">confusion</a> and distress.</p>
<p>It must be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_911">remembered</a> that at this time men had still to spread</p>
<p>into enormous areas of the land surface of the globe. There were</p>
<p>vast mountain wildernesses, forest wildernesses, sandy deserts,</p>
<p>and frozen lands. Men still clung closely to water and arable</p>
<p>soil in temperate or sub-tropical climates, they lived abundantly</p>
<p>only in river valleys, and all their great cities had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_912">grown</a> upon</p>
<p>large navigable rivers or close to ports upon the sea. Over great</p>
<p>areas even of this suitable land flies and mosquitoes, armed with</p>
<p>infection, had so far defeated human invasion, and under their</p>
<p>protection the virgin forests remained untouched. Indeed, the</p>
<p>whole world even in its most crowded districts was filthy with</p>
<p>flies and swarming with needless insect life to an extent which</p>
<p>is now almost incredible. A population map of the world in 1950</p>
<p>would have followed seashore and river course so closely in its</p>
<p>darker shading as to give an impression that homo sapiens was an</p>
<p>amphibious animal. His roads and railways lay also along the</p>
<p>lower contours, only here and there to pierce some mountain</p>
<p>barrier or reach some holiday resort did they clamber above 3000</p>
<p>feet. And across the ocean his traffic passed in definite lines;</p>
<p>there were hundreds of thousands of square miles of ocean no ship</p>
<p>ever traversed except by mischance.</p>
<p>Into the mysteries of the solid globe under his feet he had not</p>
<p>yet pierced for five miles, and it was still not forty years</p>
<p>since, with a tragic pertinacity, he had clambered to the poles</p>
<p>of the earth. The limitless mineral wealth of the Arctic and</p>
<p>Antarctic circles was still buried beneath vast accumulations of</p>
<p>immemorial ice, and the secret riches of the inner zones of the</p>
<p>crust were untapped and indeed unsuspected. The higher mountain</p>
<p>regions were <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_913">known</a> only to a sprinkling of guide-led climbers and</p>
<p>the frequenters of a few gaunt hotels, and the vast rainless</p>
<p>belts of land that lay across the continental masses, from Gobi</p>
<p>to Sahara and along the backbone of America, with their perfect</p>
<p>air, their daily baths of blazing sunshine, their nights of cool</p>
<p>serenity and glowing stars, and their reservoirs of deep-lying</p>
<p>water, were as yet only desolations of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_914">fear</a> and death to the</p>
<p>common imagination.</p>
<p>And now under the shock of the atomic bombs, the great masses of</p>
<p>population which had gathered into the enormous dingy town</p>
<p>centres of that period were dispossessed and scattered</p>
<p>disastrously over the surrounding rural areas. It was as if some</p>
<p>brutal force, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_915">grown</a> impatient at last at man's blindness, had</p>
<p>with the deliberate intention of a rearrangement of population</p>
<p>upon more wholesome lines, shaken the world. The great</p>
<p>industrial regions and the large cities that had escaped the</p>
<p>bombs were, because of their complete economic collapse, in</p>
<p>almost as tragic plight as those that blazed, and the</p>
<p>country-side was disordered by a multitude of wandering and</p>
<p>lawless strangers. In some parts of the world famine raged, and</p>
<p>in many regions there was plague… The plains of north India,</p>
<p>which had become more and more dependent for the general welfare</p>
<p>on the railways and that great system of irrigation canals which</p>
<p>the malignant section of the patriots had destroyed, were in a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_916">state</a> of peculiar distress, whole villages lay dead together, no</p>
<p>man heeding, and the very tigers and panthers that preyed upon</p>
<p>the emaciated survivors crawled back infected into the jungle to</p>
<p>perish. Large areas of China were a prey to brigand bands…</p>
<p>It is a remarkable thing that no complete contemporary account of</p>
<p>the explosion of the atomic bombs survives. There are, of</p>
<p>course, innumerable allusions and partial records, and it is from</p>
<p>these that subsequent ages must piece together the image of these</p>
<p>devastations.</p>
<p>The phenomena, it must be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_917">remembered</a>, changed greatly from day to</p>
<p>day, and even from hour to hour, as the exploding bomb shifted</p>
<p>its position, threw off fragments or came into contact with water</p>
<p>or a fresh texture of soil. Barnet, who came within forty miles</p>
<p>of Paris early in October, is concerned chiefly with his account</p>
<p>of the social <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_918">confusion</a> of the country-side and the problems of</p>
<p>his command, but he speaks of heaped cloud masses of steam. 'All</p>
<p>along the sky to the south-west' and of a red glare beneath these</p>
<p>at night. Parts of Paris were still burning, and numbers of</p>
<p>people were camped in the fields even at this distance watching</p>
<p>over treasured heaps of salvaged loot. He speaks too of the</p>
<p>distant rumbling of the explosion-'like trains going over iron</p>
<p>bridges.'</p>
<p>Other descriptions agree with this; they all speak of the</p>
<p>'continuous reverberations,' or of the 'thudding and hammering,'</p>
<p>or some such phrase; and they all testify to a huge pall of</p>
<p>steam, from which rain would fall suddenly in torrents and amidst</p>
<p>which lightning played. Drawing nearer to Paris an observer</p>
<p>would have found the salvage camps increasing in number and</p>
<p>blocking up the villages, and large numbers of people, often</p>
<p>starving and ailing, camping under improvised tents because there</p>
<p>was no place for them to go. The sky became more and more</p>
<p>densely overcast until at last it blotted out the light of day</p>
<p>and left nothing but a dull red glare 'extraordinarily <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_919">depressing</a></p>
<p>to the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_920">spirit</a>.' In this dull glare, great numbers of people were</p>
<p>still living, clinging to their houses and in many cases</p>
<p>subsisting in a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_921">state</a> of partial famine upon the produce in their</p>
<p>gardens and the stores in the shops of the provision dealers.</p>
<p>Coming in still closer, the investigator would have reached the</p>
<p>police cordon, which was trying to check the desperate enterprise</p>
<p>of those who would return to their homes or rescue their more</p>
<p>valuable possessions within the 'zone of imminent danger.'</p>
<p>That zone was rather arbitrarily defined. If our spectator could</p>
<p>have got permission to enter it, he would have entered also a</p>
<p>zone of uproar, a zone of perpetual thunderings, lit by a strange</p>
<p>purplish-red light, and quivering and swaying with the incessant</p>
<p>explosion of the radio-active substance. Whole blocks of</p>
<p>buildings were alight and burning fiercely, the trembling, ragged</p>
<p>flames looking pale and ghastly and attenuated in comparison with</p>
<p>the full-bodied crimson glare beyond. The shells of other</p>
<p>edifices already burnt rose, pierced by rows of window sockets</p>
<p>against the red-lit mist.</p>
<p>Every step farther would have been as dangerous as a descent</p>
<p>within the crater of an active volcano. These spinning, boiling</p>
<p>bomb centres would shift or break unexpectedly into new regions,</p>
<p>great fragments of earth or drain or masonry suddenly caught by a</p>
<p>jet of disruptive force might come flying by the explorer's head,</p>
<p>or the ground yawn a fiery grave beneath his feet. Few who</p>
<p>adventured into these areas of destruction and survived attempted</p>
<p>any repetition of their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_922">experiences</a>. There are stories of puffs</p>
<p>of luminous, radio-active vapour drifting sometimes scores of</p>
<p>miles from the bomb centre and killing and scorching all they</p>
<p>overtook. And the first conflagrations from the Paris centre</p>
<p>spread westward half-way to the sea.</p>
<p>Moreover, the air in this infernal inner circle of red-lit ruins</p>
<p>had a peculiar dryness and a blistering quality, so that it set</p>
<p>up a soreness of the skin and lungs that was very difficult to</p>
<p>heal…</p>
<p>Such was the last <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_923">state</a> of Paris, and such on a larger scale was</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_924">condition</a> of affairs in Chicago, and the same fate had</p>
<p>overtaken Berlin, Moscow, Tokio, the eastern half of London,</p>
<p>Toulon, Kiel, and two hundred and eighteen other centres of</p>
<p>population or armament. Each was a flaming centre of radiant</p>
<p>destruction that only time could quench, that indeed in many</p>
<p>instances time has still to quench. To this day, though indeed</p>
<p>with a constantly diminishing uproar and vigour, these explosions</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_925">continue</a>. In the map of nearly every country of the world three</p>
<p>or four or more red circles, a score of miles in diameter, mark</p>
<p>the position of the dying atomic bombs and the death areas that</p>
<p>men have been forced to abandon around them. Within these areas</p>
<p>perished museums, cathedrals, palaces, libraries, galleries of</p>
<p>masterpieces, and a vast accumulation of human achievement, whose</p>
<p>charred remains lie buried, a legacy of curious material that</p>
<p>only future generations may hope to examine…</p>
<p>Section 4</p>
<p>The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_926">state</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_927">mind</a> of the dispossessed urban population which</p>
<p>swarmed and perished so abundantly over the country-side during</p>
<p>the dark days of the autumnal months that followed the Last War,</p>
<p>was one of blank <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_928">despair</a>. Barnet gives sketch after sketch of</p>
<p>groups of these people, camped among the vineyards of Champagne,</p>
<p>as he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_929">saw</a> them during his period of service with the army of</p>
<p>pacification.</p>
<p>There was, for example, that 'man-milliner' who came out from a</p>
<p>field beside the road that rises up eastward out of Epernay, and</p>
<p>asked how things were going in Paris. He was, says Barnet, a</p>
<p>round-faced man, dressed very neatly in black-so neatly that it</p>
<p>was amazing to discover he was living close at hand in a tent</p>
<p>made of carpets-and he had 'an urbane but insistent manner,' a</p>
<p>carefully trimmed moustache and beard, expressive eyebrows, and</p>
<p>hair very neatly brushed.</p>
<p>'No one goes into Paris,' said Barnet.</p>
<p>'But, Monsieur, that is very unenterprising,' the man by the</p>
<p>wayside submitted.</p>
<p>'The danger is too great. The radiations eat into people's</p>
<p>skins.'</p>
<p>The eyebrows protested. 'But is nothing to be done?'</p>
<p>'Nothing can be done.'</p>
<p>'But, Monsieur, it is extraordinarily inconvenient, this living</p>
<p>in exile and waiting. My wife and my little boy suffer</p>
<p>extremely. There is a lack of amenity. And the season advances.</p>
<p>I say nothing of the expense and difficulty in obtaining</p>
<p>provisions… When does Monsieur <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_930">think</a> that something will be</p>
<p>done to render Paris-possible?'</p>
<p>Barnet considered his interlocutor.</p>
<p>'I'm told,' said Barnet, 'that Paris is not likely to be possible</p>
<p>again for several generations.'</p>
<p>'Oh! but this is preposterous! Consider, Monsieur! What are</p>
<p>people like <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_931">ourselves</a> to do in the meanwhile? <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_932">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_933">am</a> a costumier.</p>
<p>All my connections and interests, above all my style, demand</p>
<p>Paris…'</p>
<p>Barnet considered the sky, from which a light rain was beginning</p>
<p>to fall, the wide fields about them from which the harvest had</p>
<p>been taken, the trimmed poplars by the wayside.</p>
<p>'Naturally,' he agreed, 'you want to go to Paris. But Paris is</p>
<p>over.'</p>
<p>'Over!'</p>
<p>'Finished.'</p>
<p>'But then, Monsieur-what is to become-of ME?'</p>
<p>Barnet turned his face westward, whither the white road led.</p>
<p>'Where else, for example, may I hope to find-opportunity?'</p>
<p>Barnet made no reply.</p>
<p>'Perhaps on the Riviera. Or at some such place as Homburg. Or</p>
<p>some plague perhaps.'</p>
<p>'All that,' said Barnet, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_934">accepting</a> for the first time facts that</p>
<p>had lain evident in his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_935">mind</a> for weeks; 'all that must be over,</p>
<p>too.'</p>
<p>There was a pause. Then the voice beside him broke out. 'But,</p>
<p>Monsieur, it is impossible! It leaves-nothing.'</p>
<p>'No. Not very much.'</p>
<p>'One cannot suddenly begin to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_936">grow</a> potatoes!'</p>
<p>'It would be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_937">good</a> if Monsieur could bring himself--'</p>
<p>'To the life of a peasant! And my wife--You do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_938">know</a> the</p>
<p>distinguished delicacy of my wife, a refined helplessness, a</p>
<p>peculiar dependent charm. Like some slender tropical</p>
<p>creeper-with great white flowers… But all this is foolish</p>
<p>talk. It is impossible that Paris, which has survived so many</p>
<p>misfortunes, should not presently revive.'</p>
<p>'I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_939">think</a> it will ever revive. Paris is finished. London,</p>
<p>too, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_940">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_941">am</a> told-Berlin. All the great capitals were</p>
<p>stricken…'</p>
<p>'But--! Monsieur must permit me to differ.'</p>
<p>'It is so.'</p>
<p>'It is impossible. Civilisations do not end in this manner.</p>
<p>Mankind will insist.'</p>
<p>'On Paris?'</p>
<p>'On Paris.'</p>
<p>'Monsieur, you might as well hope to go down the Maelstrom and</p>
<p>resume business there.'</p>
<p>'I am content, Monsieur, with my own <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_942">faith</a>.'</p>
<p>'The winter comes on. Would not Monsieur be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_943">wiser</a> to seek a</p>
<p>house?'</p>
<p>'Farther from Paris? No, Monsieur. But it is not possible,</p>
<p>Monsieur, what you say, and you are under a tremendous</p>
<p>mistake… Indeed you are in error… I asked merely for</p>
<p>information…'</p>
<p>'When last I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_944">saw</a> him,' said Barnet, 'he was standing under the</p>
<p>signpost at the crest of the hill, gazing wistfully, yet it</p>
<p>seemed to me a little <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_945">doubtfully</a>, now towards Paris, and</p>
<p>altogether heedless of a drizzling rain that was wetting him</p>
<p>through and through…'</p>
<p>Section 5</p>
<p>This <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_946">effect</a> of chill dismay, of a doom as yet imperfectly</p>
<p>apprehended deepens as Barnet's record passes on to tell of the</p>
<p>approach of winter. It was too much for the great mass of those</p>
<p>unwilling and incompetent nomads to realise that an age had</p>
<p>ended, that the old <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_947">help</a> and guidance <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_948">existed</a> no longer, that</p>
<p>times would not mend again, however <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_949">patiently</a> they held out. They</p>
<p>were still in many cases looking to Paris when the first</p>
<p>snowflakes of that pitiless January came swirling about them. The</p>
<p>story <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_950">grows</a> grimmer…</p>
<p>If it is less monstrously tragic after Barnet's return to</p>
<p>England, it is, if anything, harder. England was a spectacle of</p>
<p>fear-embittered householders, hiding food, crushing out robbery,</p>
<p>driving the starving wanderers from every faltering place upon</p>
<p>the roads lest they should die inconveniently and reproachfully</p>
<p>on the doorsteps of those who had failed to urge them onward…</p>
<p>The remnants of the British troops left France finally in March,</p>
<p>after urgent representations from the provisional government at</p>
<p>Orleans that they could be supported no longer. They seem to have</p>
<p>been a fairly well-behaved, but highly parasitic force</p>
<p>throughout, though Barnet is clearly of opinion that they did</p>
<p>much to suppress sporadic brigandage and maintain social order.</p>
<p>He came home to a famine-stricken country, and his picture of the</p>
<p>England of that spring is one of miserable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_951">patience</a> and desperate</p>
<p>expedients. The country was suffering much more than France,</p>
<p>because of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_952">cessation</a> of the overseas supplies on which it had</p>
<p>hitherto relied. His troops were given bread, dried fish, and</p>
<p>boiled nettles at Dover, and marched inland to Ashford and paid</p>
<p>off. On the way thither they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_953">saw</a> four men hanging from the</p>
<p>telegraph posts by the roadside, who had been hung for stealing</p>
<p>swedes. The labour refuges of Kent, he discovered, were feeding</p>
<p>their crowds of casual wanderers on bread into which clay and</p>
<p>sawdust had been mixed. In Surrey there was a shortage of even</p>
<p>such fare as that. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_954">himself</a> struck across country to</p>
<p>Winchester, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_955">fearing</a> to approach the bomb-poisoned district round</p>
<p>London, and at Winchester he had the luck to be taken on as one</p>
<p>of the wireless assistants at the central station and given</p>
<p>regular rations. The station stood in a commanding position on</p>
<p>the chalk hill that overlooks the town from the east…</p>
<p>Thence he must have assisted in the transmission of the endless</p>
<p>cipher messages that preceded the gathering at Brissago, and</p>
<p>there it was that the Brissago proclamation of the end of the war</p>
<p>and the establishment of a world government came under his hands.</p>
<p>He was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_956">feeling</a> ill and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_957">apathetic</a> that day, and he did not realise</p>
<p>what it was he was transcribing. He did it mechanically, as a</p>
<p>part of his tedious duty.</p>
<p>Afterwards there came a rush of messages arising out of the</p>
<p>declaration that strained him very much, and in the evening when</p>
<p>he was relieved, he ate his scanty supper and then went out upon</p>
<p>the little balcony before the station, to smoke and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_958">rest</a> his</p>
<p>brains after this sudden and as yet inexplicable press of duty.</p>
<p>It was a very beautiful, still evening. He fell talking to a</p>
<p>fellow operator, and for the first time, he declares, 'I began to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_959">understand</a> what it was all about. I began to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_960">see</a> just what</p>
<p>enormous issues had been under my hands for the past four hours.</p>
<p>But I became incredulous after my first stimulation. "This is</p>
<p>some sort of Bunkum," I said very <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_961">sagely</a>.</p>
<p>'My colleague was more hopeful. "It means an end to</p>
<p>bomb-throwing and destruction," he said. "It means that</p>
<p>presently corn will come from America."</p>
<p>' "Who is going to send corn when there is no more value in</p>
<p>money?" I asked.</p>
<p>'Suddenly we were startled by a clashing from the town below. The</p>
<p>cathedral bells, which had been silent ever since I had come into</p>
<p>the district, were beginning, with a sort of rheumatic</p>
<p>difficulty, to ring. Presently they warmed a little to the work,</p>
<p>and we realised what was going on. They were ringing a peal. We</p>
<p>listened with an unbelieving astonishment and looking into each</p>
<p>other's yellow faces.</p>
<p>' "They mean it," said my colleague.</p>
<p>' "But what can they do now?" I asked. "Everything is broken</p>
<p>down…" '</p>
<p>And on that sentence, with an unexpected artistry, Barnet</p>
<p>abruptly ends his story.</p>
<p>Section 6</p>
<p>From the first the new government handled affairs with a certain</p>
<p>greatness of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_962">spirit</a>. Indeed, it was inevitable that they should</p>
<p>act greatly. From the first they had to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_963">see</a> the round globe as</p>
<p>one problem; it was impossible any longer to deal with it piece</p>
<p>by piece. They had to secure it universally from any fresh</p>
<p>outbreak of atomic destruction, and they had to ensure a</p>
<p>permanent and universal pacification. On this capacity to grasp</p>
<p>and wield the whole round globe their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_964">existence</a> depended. There</p>
<p>was no scope for any further performance.</p>
<p>So soon as the seizure of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_965">existing</a> supplies of atomic</p>
<p>ammunition and the apparatus for synthesising Carolinum was</p>
<p>assured, the disbanding or social utilisation of the various</p>
<p>masses of troops still under arms had to be arranged, the</p>
<p>salvation of the year's harvests, and the feeding, housing, and</p>
<p>employment of the drifting millions of homeless people. In</p>
<p>Canada, in South America, and Asiatic Russia there were vast</p>
<p>accumulations of provision that was immovable only because of the</p>
<p>breakdown of the monetary and credit systems. These had to be</p>
<p>brought into the famine districts very speedily if entire</p>
<p>depopulation was to be avoided, and their transportation and the</p>
<p>revival of communications generally absorbed a certain proportion</p>
<p>of the soldiery and more able unemployed. The task of housing</p>
<p>assumed gigantic dimensions, and from building camps the housing</p>
<p>committee of the council speedily passed to constructions of a</p>
<p>more permanent type. They found far less friction than might have</p>
<p>been expected in turning the loose population on their hands to</p>
<p>these things. People were extraordinarily tamed by that year of</p>
<p>suffering and death; they were disillusioned of their traditions,</p>
<p>bereft of once obstinate prejudices; they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_966">felt</a> foreign in a</p>
<p>strange world, and ready to follow any confident leadership. The</p>
<p>orders of the new government came with the best of all</p>
<p>credentials, rations. The people everywhere were as easy to</p>
<p>control, one of the old labour experts who had survived until the</p>
<p>new time witnesses, 'as gangs of emigrant workers in a new land.'</p>
<p>And now it was that the social possibilities of the atomic energy</p>
<p>began to appear. The new machinery that had come into <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_967">existence</a></p>
<p>before the last wars increased and multiplied, and the council</p>
<p>found itself not only with millions of hands at its <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_968">disposal</a> but</p>
<p>with power and apparatus that made its first conceptions of the</p>
<p>work it had to do seem pitifully timid. The camps that were</p>
<p>planned in iron and deal were built in stone and brass; the roads</p>
<p>that were to have been mere iron tracks became spacious ways that</p>
<p>insisted upon architecture; the cultivations of foodstuffs that</p>
<p>were to have supplied emergency rations, were presently, with</p>
<p>synthesisers, fertilisers, actinic light, and scientific</p>
<p>direction, in excess of every human need.</p>
<p>The government had begun with the idea of temporarily</p>
<p>reconstituting the social and economic system that had prevailed</p>
<p>before the first coming of the atomic engine, because it was to</p>
<p>this system that the ideas and habits of the great mass of the</p>
<p>world's dispossessed population was adapted. Subsequent</p>
<p>rearrangement it had hoped to leave to its successors-whoever</p>
<p>they might be. But this, it became more and more manifest, was</p>
<p>absolutely impossible. As well might the council have proposed a</p>
<p>revival of slavery. The capitalist system had already been</p>
<p>smashed beyond repair by the onset of limitless gold and energy;</p>
<p>it fell to pieces at the first endeavour to stand it up again.</p>
<p>Already before the war half of the industrial class had been out</p>
<p>of work, the attempt to put them back into wages employment on</p>
<p>the old lines was futile from the outset-the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_969">absolute</a> shattering</p>
<p>of the currency system <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_970">alone</a> would have been sufficient to</p>
<p>prevent that, and it was necessary therefore to take over the</p>
<p>housing, feeding, and clothing of this worldwide multitude</p>
<p>without exacting any return in labour whatever. In a little while</p>
<p>the mere absence of occupation for so great a multitude of people</p>
<p>everywhere became an evident social danger, and the government</p>
<p>was obliged to resort to such devices as simple decorative work</p>
<p>in wood and stone, the manufacture of hand-woven textiles,</p>
<p>fruit-growing, flower-growing, and landscape gardening on a grand</p>
<p>scale to keep the less adaptable out of mischief, and of paying</p>
<p>wages to the younger adults for attendance at schools that would</p>
<p>equip them to use the new atomic machinery… So quite</p>
<p>insensibly the council drifted into a complete reorganisation of</p>
<p>urban and industrial life, and indeed of the entire social</p>
<p>system.</p>
<p>Ideas that are unhampered by political intrigue or financial</p>
<p>considerations have a sweeping way with them, and before a year</p>
<p>was out the records of the council show clearly that it was</p>
<p>rising to its enormous opportunity, and partly through its own</p>
<p>direct control and partly through a series of specific</p>
<p>committees, it was planning a new common social order for the</p>
<p>entire population of the earth. 'There can be no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_971">real</a> social</p>
<p>stability or any general human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_972">happiness</a> while large areas of the</p>
<p>world and large classes of people are in a phase of civilisation</p>
<p>different from the prevailing mass. It is impossible now to have</p>
<p>great blocks of population misunderstanding the generally</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_973">accepted</a> social purpose or at an economic disadvantage to the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_974">rest</a>.' So the council expressed its conception of the problem it</p>
<p>had to solve. The peasant, the field-worker, and all barbaric</p>
<p>cultivators were at an 'economic disadvantage' to the more mobile</p>
<p>and educated classes, and the logic of the situation compelled</p>
<p>the council to take up systematically the supersession of this</p>
<p>stratum by a more efficient organisation of production. It</p>
<p>developed a scheme for the progressive establishment throughout</p>
<p>the world of the 'modern system' in agriculture, a system that</p>
<p>should give the full advantages of a civilised life to every</p>
<p>agricultural worker, and this replacement has been going on right</p>
<p>up to the present day. The central idea of the modern system is</p>
<p>the substitution of cultivating guilds for the individual</p>
<p>cultivator, and for cottage and village life altogether. These</p>
<p>guilds are associations of men and women who take over areas of</p>
<p>arable or pasture land, and make <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_975">themselves</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_976">responsible</a> for a</p>
<p>certain average produce. They are bodies small enough as a rule</p>
<p>to be run on a strictly democratic basis, and large enough to</p>
<p>supply all the labour, except for a certain assistance from</p>
<p>townspeople during the harvest, needed upon the land farmed. They</p>
<p>have watchers' bungalows or chalets on the ground cultivated, but</p>
<p>the ease and the costlessness of modern locomotion enables them</p>
<p>to maintain a group of residences in the nearest town with a</p>
<p>common dining-room and club house, and usually also a guild house</p>
<p>in the national or provincial capital. Already this system has</p>
<p>abolished a distinctively 'rustic' population throughout vast</p>
<p>areas of the old world, where it has prevailed immemorially. That</p>
<p>shy, unstimulated life of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_977">lonely</a> hovel, the narrow scandals</p>
<p>and petty spites and persecutions of the small village, that</p>
<p>hoarding, half inanimate <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_978">existence</a> away from books, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_979">thought</a>, or</p>
<p>social participation and in constant contact with cattle, pigs,</p>
<p>poultry, and their excrement, is passing away out of human</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_980">experience</a>. In a little while it will be gone altogether. In the</p>
<p>nineteenth century it had already <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_981">ceased</a> to be a necessary human</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_982">state</a>, and only the absence of any collective intelligence and an</p>
<p>imagined need for tough and unintelligent soldiers and for a</p>
<p>prolific class at a low level, prevented its systematic</p>
<p>replacement at that time…</p>
<p>And while this settlement of the country was in progress, the</p>
<p>urban camps of the first phase of the council's activities were</p>
<p>rapidly developing, partly through the inherent forces of the</p>
<p>situation and partly through the council's direction, into a</p>
<p>modern type of town…</p>
<p>Section 7</p>
<p>It is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_983">characteristic</a> of the manner in which large enterprises</p>
<p>forced <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_984">themselves</a> upon the Brissago council, that it was not</p>
<p>until the end of the first year of their administration and then</p>
<p>only with extreme reluctance that they would take up the manifest</p>
<p>need for a lingua franca for the world. They seem to have given</p>
<p>little attention to the various theoretical universal languages</p>
<p>which were proposed to them. They wished to give as little</p>
<p>trouble to hasty and simple people as possible, and the</p>
<p>world-wide alstribution of English gave them a bias for it from</p>
<p>the beginning. The extreme simplicity of its grammar was also in</p>
<p>its favour.</p>
<p>It was not without some sacrifices that the English-speaking</p>
<p>peoples were permitted the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_985">satisfaction</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_986">hearing</a> their speech</p>
<p>used universally. The language was shorn of a number of</p>
<p>grammatical peculiarities, the distinctive <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_987">forms</a> for the</p>
<p>subjunctive mood for example and most of its irregular plurals</p>
<p>were abolished; its spelling was systematised and adapted to the</p>
<p>vowel sounds in use upon the continent of Europe, and a process</p>
<p>of incorporating foreign nouns and verbs commenced that speedily</p>
<p>reached enormous proportions. Within ten years from the</p>
<p>establishment of the World Republic the New English Dictionary</p>
<p>had swelled to include a vocabulary of 250,000 words, and a man</p>
<p>of 1900 would have found considerable difficulty in reading an</p>
<p>ordinary newspaper. On the other hand, the men of the new time</p>
<p>could still appreciate the older English literature… Certain</p>
<p>minor acts of uniformity accompanied this larger one. The idea of</p>
<p>a common <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_988">understanding</a> and a general simplification of</p>
<p>intercourse once it was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_989">accepted</a> led very naturally to the</p>
<p>universal establishment of the metric system of weights and</p>
<p>measures, and to the disappearance of the various makeshift</p>
<p>calendars that had hitherto <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_990">confused</a> chronology. The year was</p>
<p>divided into thirteen months of four weeks each, and New Year's</p>
<p>Day and Leap Year's Day were made holidays, and did not count at</p>
<p>all in the ordinary week. So the weeks and the months were</p>
<p>brought into correspondence. And moreover, as the king put it to</p>
<p>Firmin, it was decided to 'nail down Easter.'… In these</p>
<p>matters, as in so many matters, the new civilisation came as a</p>
<p>simplification of ancient complications; the history of the</p>
<p>calendar throughout the world is a history of inadequate</p>
<p>adjustments, of attempts to fix seed-time and midwinter that go</p>
<p>back into the very beginning of human society; and this final</p>
<p>rectification had a symbolic value quite beyond its practical</p>
<p>convenience. But the council would have no rash nor harsh</p>
<p>innovations, no strange names for the months, and no alteration</p>
<p>in the numbering of the years.</p>
<p>The world had already been put upon one universal monetary basis.</p>
<p>For some months after the accession of the council, the world's</p>
<p>affairs had been carried on without any sound currency at all.</p>
<p>Over great regions money was still in use, but with the most</p>
<p>extravagant variations in price and the most disconcerting</p>
<p>fluctuations of public confidence. The ancient rarity of gold</p>
<p>upon which the entire system <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_991">rested</a> was gone. Gold was now a</p>
<p>waste product in the release of atomic energy, and it was plain</p>
<p>that no metal could be the basis of the monetary system again.</p>
<p>Henceforth all coins must be token coins. Yet the whole world</p>
<p>was accustomed to metallic money, and a vast proportion of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_992">existing</a> human relationships had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_993">grown</a> up upon a cash basis, and</p>
<p>were almost inconceivable without that convenient liquidating</p>
<p>factor. It seemed absolutely necessary to the life of the social</p>
<p>organisation to have some sort of currency, and the council had</p>
<p>therefore to discover some <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_994">real</a> value upon which to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_991">rest</a> it.</p>
<p>Various such apparently stable values as land and hours of work</p>
<p>were considered. Ultimately the government, which was now in</p>
<p>possession of most of the supplies of energy-releasing material,</p>
<p>fixed a certain number of units of energy as the value of a gold</p>
<p>sovereign, declared a sovereign to be worth exactly twenty marks,</p>
<p>twenty-five francs, five dollars, and so forth, with the other</p>
<p>current units of the world, and undertook, under various</p>
<p>qualifications and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_995">conditions</a>, to deliver energy upon demand as</p>
<p>payment for every sovereign presented. On the whole, this worked</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_996">satisfactorily</a>. They saved the face of the pound sterling. Coin</p>
<p>was rehabilitated, and after a phase of price fluctuations, began</p>
<p>to settle down to definite equivalents and uses again, with names</p>
<p>and everyday values familiar to the common run of people…</p>
<p>Section 8</p>
<p>As the Brissago council came to realise that what it had supposed</p>
<p>to be temporary camps of refugees were rapidly developing into</p>
<p>great towns of a new type, and that it was remoulding the world</p>
<p>in spite of itself, it decided to place this work of</p>
<p>redistributing the non-agricultural population in the hands of a</p>
<p>compactor and better qualified special committee. That committee</p>
<p>is now, far more than the council of any other of its delegated</p>
<p>committees, the active government of the world. Developed from</p>
<p>an almost invisible germ of 'town-planning' that came obscurely</p>
<p>into <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_997">existence</a> in Europe or America (the question is still in</p>
<p>dispute) somewhere in the closing decades of the nineteenth</p>
<p>century, its work, the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_998">continual</a> active planning and replanning</p>
<p>of the world as a place of human habitation, is now so to speak</p>
<p>the collective material activity of the race. The spontaneous,</p>
<p>disorderly spreadings and recessions of populations, as aimless</p>
<p>and mechanical as the trickling of spilt water, which was the</p>
<p>substance of history for endless years, giving rise here to</p>
<p>congestions, here to chronic devastating wars, and everywhere to</p>
<p>a discomfort and disorderliness that was at its best only</p>
<p>picturesque, is at an end. Men spread now, with the whole power</p>
<p>of the race to aid them, into every available region of the</p>
<p>earth. Their cities are no longer tethered to running water and</p>
<p>the proximity of cultivation, their plans are no longer affected</p>
<p>by strategic considerations or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_999">thoughts</a> of social insecurity. The</p>
<p>aeroplane and the nearly costless mobile car have abolished trade</p>
<p>routes; a common language and a universal law have abolished a</p>
<p>thousand restraining inconveniences, and so an astonishing</p>
<p>dispersal of habitations has begun. One may live anywhere. And</p>
<p>so it is that our cities now are <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1000">true</a> social gatherings, each</p>
<p>with a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1001">character</a> of its own and distinctive interests of its own,</p>
<p>and most of them with a common occupation. They lie out in the</p>
<p>former deserts, these long wasted sun-baths of the race, they</p>
<p>tower amidst eternal snows, they hide in remote islands, and bask</p>
<p>on broad lagoons. For a time the whole tendency of mankind was to</p>
<p>desert the river valleys in which the race had been cradled for</p>
<p>half a million years, but now that the War against Flies has been</p>
<p>waged so successfully that this pestilential branch of life is</p>
<p>nearly extinct, they are returning thither with a renewed</p>
<p>appetite for gardens laced by watercourses, for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1002">pleasant</a> living</p>
<p>amidst islands and houseboats and bridges, and for nocturnal</p>
<p>lanterns reflected by the sea.</p>
<p>Man who is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1003">ceasing</a> to be an agricultural animal becomes more and</p>
<p>more a builder, a traveller, and a maker. How much he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1003">ceases</a> to</p>
<p>be a cultivator of the soil the returns of the Redistribution</p>
<p>Committee showed. Every year the work of our scientific</p>
<p>laboratories increases the productivity and simplifies the labour</p>
<p>of those who work upon the soil, and the food now of the whole</p>
<p>world is produced by less than one per cent. of its population, a</p>
<p>percentage which still tends to decrease. Far fewer people are</p>
<p>needed upon the land than training and proclivity <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1004">dispose</a> towards</p>
<p>it, and as a consequence of this excess of human attention, the</p>
<p>garden side of life, the creation of groves and lawns and vast</p>
<p>regions of beautiful flowers, has expanded enormously and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1005">continues</a> to expand. For, as agricultural method intensifies and</p>
<p>the quota is raised, one farm association after another, availing</p>
<p>itself of the 1975 regulations, elects to produce a public garden</p>
<p>and pleasaunce in the place of its former fields, and the area of</p>
<p>freedom and beauty is increased. And the chemists' triumphs of</p>
<p>synthesis, which could now give us an entirely artificial food,</p>
<p>remain largely in abeyance because it is so much more <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1006">pleasant</a></p>
<p>and interesting to eat natural produce and to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1007">grow</a> such things</p>
<p>upon the soil. Each year adds to the variety of our fruits and</p>
<p>the delightfulness of our flowers.</p>
<p>Section 9</p>
<p>The early years of the World Republic witnessed a certain</p>
<p>recrudescence of political adventure. There was, it is rather</p>
<p>curious to note, no revival of separatism after the face of King</p>
<p>Ferdinand Charles had vanished from the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1008">sight</a> of men, but in a</p>
<p>number of countries, as the first urgent physical needs were met,</p>
<p>there appeared a variety of personalities having this in common,</p>
<p>that they sought to revive political trouble and clamber by its</p>
<p>aid to positions of importance and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1009">satisfaction</a>. In no case did</p>
<p>they speak in the name of kings, and it is clear that monarchy</p>
<p>must have been far gone in obsolescence before the twentieth</p>
<p>century began, but they made appeals to the large survivals of</p>
<p>nationalist and racial <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1010">feeling</a> that were everywhere to be found,</p>
<p>they alleged with considerable justice that the council was</p>
<p>overriding racial and national customs and disregarding religious</p>
<p>rules. The great plain of India was particularly prolific in such</p>
<p>agitators. The revival of newspapers, which had largely <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1011">ceased</a></p>
<p>during the terrible year because of the dislocation of the</p>
<p>coinage, gave a vehicle and a method of organisation to these</p>
<p>complaints. At first the council disregarded this developing</p>
<p>opposition, and then it recognised it with an entirely</p>
<p>devastating frankness.</p>
<p>Never, of course, had there been so provisional a government. It</p>
<p>was of an extravagant illegality. It was, indeed, hardly more</p>
<p>than a club, a club of about a hundred persons. At the outset</p>
<p>there were ninety-three, and these were increased afterwards by</p>
<p>the issue of invitations which more than balanced its deaths, to</p>
<p>as many at one time as one hundred and nineteen. Always its</p>
<p>constitution has been miscellaneous. At no time were these</p>
<p>invitations issued with an admission that they recognised a</p>
<p>right. The old institution or monarchy had come out unexpectedly</p>
<p>well in the light of the new regime. Nine of the original members</p>
<p>of the first government were crowned heads who had resigned their</p>
<p>separate sovereignty, and at no time afterwards did the number of</p>
<p>its royal members sink below six. In their case there was perhaps</p>
<p>a kind of attenuated claim to rule, but except for them and the</p>
<p>still more infinitesimal pretensions of one or two ax-presidents</p>
<p>of republics, no member of the council had even the shade of a</p>
<p>right to his participation in its power. It was natural,</p>
<p>therefore, that its opponents should find a common ground in a</p>
<p>clamour for representative government, and build high hopes upon</p>
<p>a return, to parliamentary institutions.</p>
<p>The council decided to give them everything they wanted, but in a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1012">form</a> that suited ill with their aspirations. It became at one</p>
<p>stroke a representative body. It became, indeed, magnificently</p>
<p>representative. It became so representative that the politicians</p>
<p>were drowned in a deluge of votes. Every adult of either sex</p>
<p>from pole to pole was given a vote, and the world was divided</p>
<p>into ten constituencies, which voted on the same day by means of</p>
<p>a simple modification of the world post. Membership of the</p>
<p>government, it was decided, must be for life, save in the</p>
<p>exceptional case of a recall; but the elections, which were held</p>
<p>quinquenially, were arranged to add fifty members on each</p>
<p>occasion. The method of proportional representation with one</p>
<p>transferable vote was adopted, and the voter might also write</p>
<p>upon his voting paper in a specially marked space, the name of</p>
<p>any of his representatives that he wished to recall. A ruler was</p>
<p>recallable by as many votes as the quota by which he had been</p>
<p>elected, and the original members by as many votes in any</p>
<p>constituency as the returning quotas in the first election.</p>
<p>Upon these <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1013">conditions</a> the council submitted itself very</p>
<p>cheerfully to the suffrages of the world. None of its members</p>
<p>were recalled, and its fifty new associates, which included</p>
<p>twenty-seven which it had <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1014">seen</a> fit to recommend, were of an</p>
<p>altogether too miscellaneous quality to disturb the broad trend</p>
<p>of its policy. Its freedom from rules or formalities prevented</p>
<p>any obstructive proceedings, and when one of the two newly</p>
<p>arrived Home Rule members for India sought for information how to</p>
<p>bring in a bill, they learnt simply that bills were not brought</p>
<p>in. They asked for the speaker, and were privileged to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1015">hear</a> much</p>
<p>ripe <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1016">wisdom</a> from the ex-king Egbert, who was now <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1017">consciously</a></p>
<p>among the seniors of the gathering. Thereafter they were baffled</p>
<p>men…</p>
<p>But already by that time the work of the council was drawing to</p>
<p>an end. It was concerned not so much for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1018">continuation</a> of its</p>
<p>construction as for the preservation of its accomplished work</p>
<p>from the dramatic instincts of the politician.</p>
<p>The life of the race becomes indeed more and more independent of</p>
<p>the formal government. The council, in its opening phase, was</p>
<p>heroic in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1019">spirit</a>; a dragon-slaying body, it slashed out of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1020">existence</a> a vast, knotted tangle of obsolete ideas and clumsy and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1021">jealous</a> proprietorships; it secured by a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1022">noble</a> system of</p>
<p>institutional precautions, freedom of inquiry, freedom of</p>
<p>criticism, free communications, a common basis of education and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1023">understanding</a>, and freedom from economic oppression. With that</p>
<p>its creative task was accomplished. It became more and more an</p>
<p>established security and less and less an active intervention.</p>
<p>There is nothing in our time to correspond with the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1024">continual</a></p>
<p>petty making and entangling of laws in an atmosphere of</p>
<p>contention that is perhaps the most perplexing aspect of</p>
<p>constitutional history in the nineteenth century. In that age</p>
<p>they seem to have been perpetually making laws when we should</p>
<p>alter regulations. The work of change which we delegate to these</p>
<p>scientific committees of specific general direction which have</p>
<p>the special <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1025">knowledge</a> needed, and which are <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1026">themselves</a> dominated</p>
<p>by the broad intellectual process of the community, was in those</p>
<p>days inextricably mixed up with legislation. They fought over the</p>
<p>details; we should as soon <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1027">think</a> of fighting over the arrangement</p>
<p>of the parts of a machine. We <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1028">know</a> nowadays that such things go</p>
<p>on best within laws, as life goes on between earth and sky. And</p>
<p>so it is that government gathers now for a day or so in each year</p>
<p>under the sunshine of Brissago when Saint Bruno's lilies are in</p>
<p>flower, and does little more than bless the work of its</p>
<p>committees. And even these committees are less originative and</p>
<p>more expressive of the general <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1029">thought</a> than they were at first.</p>
<p>It becomes difficult to mark out the particular directive</p>
<p>personalities of the world. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1030">Continually</a> we are less personal.</p>
<p>Every <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1031">good</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1029">thought</a> contributes now, and every able brain falls</p>
<p>within that informal and dispersed kingship which gathers</p>
<p>together into one purpose the energies of the race.</p>
<p>Section 10</p>
<p>It is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1032">doubtful</a> if we shall ever <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1033">see</a> again a phase of human</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1034">existence</a> in which 'politics,' that is to say a partisan</p>
<p>interference with the ruling sanities of the world, will be the</p>
<p>dominant interest among serious men. We seem to have entered</p>
<p>upon an entirely new phase in history in which contention as</p>
<p>distinguished from rivalry, has almost abruptly <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1035">ceased</a> to be the</p>
<p>usual occupation, and has become at most a subdued and hidden and</p>
<p>discredited thing. Contentious professions <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1036">cease</a> to be an</p>
<p>honourable employment for men. The peace between nations is also</p>
<p>a peace between individuals. We live in a world that comes of</p>
<p>age. Man the warrior, man the lawyer, and all the bickering</p>
<p>aspects of life, pass into obscurity; the grave dreamers, man the</p>
<p>curious learner, and man the creative artist, come forward to</p>
<p>replace these barbaric aspects of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1034">existence</a> by a less ignoble</p>
<p>adventure.</p>
<p>There is no natural life of man. He is, and always has been, a</p>
<p>sheath of varied and even incompatible possibilities, a</p>
<p>palimpsest of inherited dispositions. It was the habit of many</p>
<p>writers in the early twentieth century to speak of competition</p>
<p>and the narrow, private life of trade and saving and suspicious</p>
<p>isolation as though such things were in some exceptional way</p>
<p>proper to the human constitution, and as though openness of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1037">mind</a></p>
<p>and a preference for achievement over possession were abnormal</p>
<p>and rather unsubstantial qualities. How wrong that was the</p>
<p>history of the decades immediately following the establishment of</p>
<p>the world republic witnesses. Once the world was released from</p>
<p>the hardening insecurities of a needless struggle for life that</p>
<p>was collectively planless and individually absorbing, it became</p>
<p>apparent that there was in the vast mass of people a long,</p>
<p>smothered passion to make things. The world broke out into</p>
<p>making, and at first mainly into aesthetic making. This phase of</p>
<p>history, which has been not inaptly termed the 'Efflorescence,'</p>
<p>is still, to a large extent, with us. The majority of our</p>
<p>population consists of artists, and the bulk of activity in the</p>
<p>world lies no longer with necessities but with their elaboration,</p>
<p>decoration, and refinement. There has been an evident change in</p>
<p>the quality of this making during recent years. It becomes more</p>
<p>purposeful than it was, losing something of its first elegance</p>
<p>and prettiness and gaining in intensity; but that is a change</p>
<p>rather of hue than of nature. That comes with a deepening</p>
<p>philosophy and a sounder education. For the first <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1038">joyous</a></p>
<p>exercises of fancy we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1039">perceive</a> now the deliberation of a more</p>
<p>constructive imagination. There is a natural order in these</p>
<p>things, and art comes before science as the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1040">satisfaction</a> of more</p>
<p>elemental needs must come before art, and as play and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1041">pleasure</a></p>
<p>come in a human life before the development of a settled</p>
<p>purpose…</p>
<p>For thousands of years this gathering impulse to creative work</p>
<p>must have struggled in man against the limitations imposed upon</p>
<p>him by his social ineptitude. It was a long smouldering fire</p>
<p>that flamed out at last in all these things. The evidence of a</p>
<p>pathetic, perpetually thwarted urgency to make something, is one</p>
<p>of the most <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1042">touching</a> aspects of the relics and records of our</p>
<p>immediate ancestors. There <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1043">exists</a> still in the death area about</p>
<p>the London bombs, a region of deserted small homes that furnish</p>
<p>the most illuminating comment on the old <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1044">state</a> of affairs. These</p>
<p>homes are entirely horrible, uniform, square, squat, hideously</p>
<p>proportioned, uncomfortable, dingy, and in some respects quite</p>
<p>filthy, only people in complete <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1045">despair</a> of anything better could</p>
<p>have lived in them, but to each is attached a ridiculous little</p>
<p>rectangle of land called 'the garden,' containing usually a prop</p>
<p>for drying clothes and a loathsome box of offal, the dustbin,</p>
<p>full of egg-shells, cinders, and such-like refuse. Now that one</p>
<p>may go about this region in comparitive security-for the London</p>
<p>radiations have dwindled to inconsiderable proportions-it is</p>
<p>possible to trace in nearly every one of these gardens some</p>
<p>effort to make. Here it is a poor little plank summer-house,</p>
<p>here it is a 'fountain' of bricks and oyster-shells, here a</p>
<p>'rockery,' here a 'workshop.' And in the houses everywhere there</p>
<p>are pitiful little decorations, clumsy models, feeble drawings.</p>
<p>These efforts are almost incredibly inept, like the drawings of</p>
<p>blindfolded men, they are only one shade less harrowing to a</p>
<p>sympathetic observer than the scratchings one finds upon the</p>
<p>walls of the old prisons, but there they are, witnessing to the</p>
<p>poor buried instincts that struggled up towards the light. That</p>
<p>god of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1046">joyous</a> expression our poor fathers ignorantly sought, our</p>
<p>freedom has declared to us…</p>
<p>In the old days the common ambition of every simple <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1047">soul</a> was to</p>
<p>possess a little property, a patch of land, a house uncontrolled</p>
<p>by others, an 'independence' as the English used to put it. And</p>
<p>what made this <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1048">desire</a> for freedom and prosperity so strong, was</p>
<p>very evidently the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1049">dream</a> of self-expression, of doing something</p>
<p>with it, of playing with it, of making a personal delightfulness,</p>
<p>a distinctiveness. Property was never more than a means to an</p>
<p>end, nor avarice more than a perversion. Men owned in order to</p>
<p>do freely. Now that every one has his own apartments and his own</p>
<p>privacy secure, this <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1050">disposition</a> to own has found its release in</p>
<p>a new direction. Men study and save and strive that they may</p>
<p>leave behind them a series of panels in some public arcade, a row</p>
<p>of carven figures along a terrace, a grove, a pavilion. Or they</p>
<p>give <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1051">themselves</a> to the penetration of some still opaque riddle in</p>
<p>phenomena as once men gave <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1051">themselves</a> to the accumulation of</p>
<p>riches. The work that was once the whole substance of social</p>
<p>existence-for most men spent all their lives in earning a</p>
<p>living-is now no more than was the burden upon one of those old</p>
<p>climbers who carried knapsacks of provisions on their backs in</p>
<p>order that they might ascend mountains. It matters little to the</p>
<p>easy charities of our emancipated time that most people who have</p>
<p>made their labour contribution produce neither new beauty nor new</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1052">wisdom</a>, but are simply busy about those <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1053">pleasant</a> activities and</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1054">enjoyments</a> that reassure them that they are alive. They <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1055">help</a>, it</p>
<p>may be, by reception and reverberation, and they hinder nothing.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Section 11</p>
<p>Now all this phase of gigantic change in the contours and</p>
<p>appearances of human life which is going on about us, a change as</p>
<p>rapid and as wonderful as the swift ripening of adolescence to</p>
<p>manhood after the barbaric boyish years, is correlated with moral</p>
<p>and mental changes at least as unprecedented. It is not as if old</p>
<p>things were going out of life and new things coming in, it is</p>
<p>rather that the altered circumstances of men are making an appeal</p>
<p>to elements in his nature that have hitherto been suppressed, and</p>
<p>checking tendencies that have hitherto been over-stimulated and</p>
<p>over-developed. He has not so much <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1056">grown</a> and altered his</p>
<p>essential <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1057">being</a> as turned new aspects to the light. Such turnings</p>
<p>round into a new <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1058">attitude</a> the world has <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1059">seen</a> on a less extensive</p>
<p>scale before. The Highlanders of the seventeenth century, for</p>
<p>example, were cruel and bloodthirsty robbers, in the nineteenth</p>
<p>their descendants were conspicuously trusty and honourable men.</p>
<p>There was not a people in Western Europe in the early twentieth</p>
<p>century that seemed capable of hideous massacres, and none that</p>
<p>had not been <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1060">guilty</a> of them within the previous two centuries.</p>
<p>The free, frank, kindly, gentle life of the prosperous classes in</p>
<p>any European country before the years of the last wars was in a</p>
<p>different world of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1061">thought</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1062">feeling</a> from that of the dingy,</p>
<p>suspicious, secretive, and uncharitable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1063">existence</a> of the</p>
<p>respectable poor, or the constant personal violence, the squalor</p>
<p>and naive passions of the lowest stratum. Yet there were no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1064">real</a></p>
<p>differences of blood and inherent quality between these worlds;</p>
<p>their differences were all in circumstances, suggestion, and</p>
<p>habits of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1065">mind</a>. And turning to more individual instances the</p>
<p>constantly observed difference between one portion of a life and</p>
<p>another consequent upon a religious conversion, were a standing</p>
<p>example of the versatile possibilities of human nature.</p>
<p>The catastrophe of the atomic bombs which shook men out of cities</p>
<p>and businesses and economic <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1066">relations</a> shook them also out of</p>
<p>their old established habits of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1067">thought</a>, and out of the lightly</p>
<p>held beliefs and prejudices that came down to them from the past.</p>
<p>To borrow a word from the old-fashioned chemists, men were made</p>
<p>nascent; they were released from old ties; for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1068">good</a> or evil they</p>
<p>were ready for new associations. The council carried them</p>
<p>forward for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1068">good</a>; perhaps if his bombs had reached their</p>
<p>destination King Ferdinand Charles might have carried them back</p>
<p>to an endless chain of evils. But his task would have been a</p>
<p>harder one than the council's. The moral shock of the atomic</p>
<p>bombs had been a profound one, and for a while the cunning side</p>
<p>of the human animal was overpowered by its sincere realisation of</p>
<p>the vital necessity for reconstruction. The litigious and trading</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1069">spirits</a> cowered together, scared at their own consequences; men</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1067">thought</a> twice before they sought mean advantages in the face of</p>
<p>the unusual eagerness to realise new aspirations, and when at</p>
<p>last the weeds revived again and 'claims' began to sprout, they</p>
<p>sprouted upon the stony soil of law-courts reformed, of laws that</p>
<p>pointed to the future instead of the past, and under the blazing</p>
<p>sunshine of a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1070">transforming</a> world. A new literature, a new</p>
<p>interpretation of history were springing into <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1071">existence</a>, a new</p>
<p>teaching was already in the schools, a new <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1072">faith</a> in the young.</p>
<p>The worthy man who forestalled the building of a research city</p>
<p>for the English upon the Sussex downs by buying up a series of</p>
<p>estates, was dispossessed and laughed out of court when he made</p>
<p>his demand for some preposterous compensation; the owner of the</p>
<p>discredited Dass patents makes his last appearance upon the</p>
<p>scroll of history as the insolvent proprietor of a paper called</p>
<p>The Cry for Justice, in which he duns the world for a hundred</p>
<p>million pounds. That was the ingenuous Dass's idea of justice,</p>
<p>that he ought to be paid about five million pounds annually</p>
<p>because he had annexed the selvage of one of Holsten's</p>
<p>discoveries. Dass came at last to believe quite firmly in his</p>
<p>right, and he died a victim of conspiracy mania in a private</p>
<p>hospital at Nice. Both of these men would probably have ended</p>
<p>their days enormously wealthy, and of course <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1073">ennobled</a> in the</p>
<p>England of the opening twentieth century, and it is just this</p>
<p>novelty of their fates that marks the quality of the new age.</p>
<p>The new government early discovered the need of a universal</p>
<p>education to fit men to the great conceptions of its universal</p>
<p>rule. It made no wrangling attacks on the local, racial, and</p>
<p>sectarian <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1074">forms</a> of religious profession that at that time divided</p>
<p>the earth into a patchwork of hatreds and distrusts; it left</p>
<p>these organisations to make their peace with God in their own</p>
<p>time; but it proclaimed as if it were a mere secular <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1075">truth</a> that</p>
<p>sacrifice was expected from all, that respect had to be shown to</p>
<p>all; it revived schools or set them up afresh all around the</p>
<p>world, and everywhere these schools taught the history of war and</p>
<p>the consequences and moral of the Last War; everywhere it was</p>
<p>taught not as a sentiment but as a matter of fact that the</p>
<p>salvation of the world from waste and contention was the common</p>
<p>duty and occupation of all men and women. These things which are</p>
<p>now the elementary commonplaces of human intercourse seemed to</p>
<p>the councillors of Brissago, when first they dared to proclaim</p>
<p>them, marvellously daring discoveries, not untouched by <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1076">doubt</a>,</p>
<p>that flushed the cheek and fired the eye.</p>
<p>The council placed all this educational reconstruction in the</p>
<p>hands of a committee of men and women, which did its work during</p>
<p>the next few decades with remarkable breadth and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1077">effectiveness</a>.</p>
<p>This educational committee was, and is, the correlative upon the</p>
<p>mental and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1078">spiritual</a> side of the redistribution committee. And</p>
<p>prominent upon it, and indeed for a time quite dominating it, was</p>
<p>a Russian named Karenin, who was singular in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1079">being</a> a congenital</p>
<p>cripple. His body was bent so that he walked with difficulty,</p>
<p>suffered much <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1080">pain</a> as he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1081">grew</a> older, and had at last to undergo</p>
<p>two operations. The second killed him. Already malformation,</p>
<p>which was to be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1082">seen</a> in every crowd during the middle ages so</p>
<p>that the crippled beggar was, as it were, an essential feature of</p>
<p>the human spectacle, was becoming a strange thing in the world.</p>
<p>It had a curious <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1083">effect</a> upon Karenin's colleagues; their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1084">feeling</a></p>
<p>towards him was mingled with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1085">pity</a> and a sense of inhumanity that</p>
<p>it needed usage rather than reason to overcome. He had a strong</p>
<p>face, with little bright brown eyes rather deeply sunken and a</p>
<p>large resolute thin-lipped mouth. His skin was very yellow and</p>
<p>wrinkled, and his hair iron gray. He was at all times an</p>
<p>impatient and sometimes an <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1086">angry</a> man, but this was <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1087">forgiven</a> him</p>
<p>because of the hot wire of suffering that was manifestly thrust</p>
<p>through his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1079">being</a>. At the end of his life his personal prestige</p>
<p>was very great. To him far more than to any contemporary is it</p>
<p>due that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1088">self-abnegation</a>, self-identification with the world</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1089">spirit</a>, was made the basis of universal education. That general</p>
<p>memorandum to the teachers which is the key-note of the modern</p>
<p>educational system, was probably entirely his work.</p>
<p>'Whosoever would save his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1090">soul</a> shall lose it,' he wrote. 'That is</p>
<p>the device upon the seal of this document, and the starting point</p>
<p>of all we have to do. It is a mistake to regard it as anything</p>
<p>but a plain statement of fact. It is the basis for your work.</p>
<p>You have to teach self-forgetfulness, and everything else that</p>
<p>you have to teach is contributory and subordinate to that end.</p>
<p>Education is the release of man from <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1091">self</a>. You have to widen the</p>
<p>horizons of your children, encourage and intensify their</p>
<p>curiosity and their creative impulses, and cultivate and enlarge</p>
<p>their sympathies. That is what you are for. Under your guidance</p>
<p>and the suggestions you will bring to bear on them, they have to</p>
<p>shed the old Adam of instinctive suspicions, hostilities, and</p>
<p>passions, and to find <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1092">themselves</a> again in the great <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1093">being</a> of the</p>
<p>universe. The little circles of their egotisms have to be opened</p>
<p>out until they become arcs in the sweep of the racial purpose.</p>
<p>And this that you teach to others you must learn also sedulously</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1091">yourselves</a>. Philosophy, discovery, art, every sort of skill,</p>
<p>every sort of service, love: these are the means of salvation</p>
<p>from that narrow <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1094">loneliness</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1095">desire</a>, that brooding</p>
<p>preoccupation with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1091">self</a> and egotistical relationships, which is</p>
<p>hell for the individual, treason to the race, and exile from</p>
<p>God…'</p>
<p>Section 12</p>
<p>As things round <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1096">themselves</a> off and accomplish <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1096">themselves</a>, one</p>
<p>begins for the first time to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1097">see</a> them clearly. From the</p>
<p>perspectives of a new age one can look back upon the great and</p>
<p>widening stream of literature with a complete <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1098">understanding</a>.</p>
<p>Things link up that seemed disconnected, and things that were</p>
<p>once condemned as harsh and aimless are <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1099">seen</a> to be but factors in</p>
<p>the statement of a gigantic problem. An enormous bulk of the</p>
<p>sincerer writing of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth</p>
<p>centuries falls together now into an unanticipated unanimity; one</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1100">sees</a> it as a huge tissue of variations upon one theme, the</p>
<p>conflict of human egotism and personal passion and narrow</p>
<p>imaginations on the one hand, against the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1101">growing</a> sense of wider</p>
<p>necessities and a possible, more spacious life.</p>
<p>That conflict is in evidence in so early a work as Voltaire's</p>
<p>Candide, for example, in which the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1102">desire</a> for justice as well as</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1103">happiness</a> beats against human contrariety and takes refuge at</p>
<p>last in a forced and inconclusive contentment with little things.</p>
<p>Candide was but one of the pioneers of a literature of uneasy</p>
<p>complaint that was presently an innumerable multitude of books.</p>
<p>The novels more particularly of the nineteenth century, if one</p>
<p>excludes the mere story-tellers from our consideration, witness</p>
<p>to this uneasy realisation of changes that call for effort and of</p>
<p>the lack of that effort. In a thousand aspects, now tragically,</p>
<p>now comically, now with a funny affectation of divine <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1104">detachment</a>,</p>
<p>a countless host of witnesses tell their story of lives fretting</p>
<p>between <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1105">dreams</a> and limitations. Now one laughs, now one weeps,</p>
<p>now one reads with a blank astonishment at this huge and almost</p>
<p>unpremeditated record of how the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1106">growing</a> human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1107">spirit</a>, now</p>
<p>warily, now eagerly, now furiously, and always, as it seems,</p>
<p>unsuccessfully, tried to adapt itself to the maddening misfit of</p>
<p>its patched and ancient garments. And always in these books as</p>
<p>one draws nearer to the heart of the matter there comes a</p>
<p>disconcerting evasion. It was the fantastic convention of the</p>
<p>time that a writer should not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1108">touch</a> upon religion. To do so was</p>
<p>to rouse the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1109">jealous</a> fury of the great multitude of professional</p>
<p>religious teachers. It was permitted to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1110">state</a> the discord, but</p>
<p>it was forbidden to glance at any possible reconciliation.</p>
<p>Religion was the privilege of the pulpit…</p>
<p>It was not only from the novels that religion was omitted. It was</p>
<p>ignored by the newspapers; it was pedantically disregarded in the</p>
<p>discussion of business questions, it played a trivial and</p>
<p>apologetic part in public affairs. And this was done not out of</p>
<p>contempt but respect. The hold of the old religious organisations</p>
<p>upon men's respect was still enormous, so enormous that there</p>
<p>seemed to be a quality of irreverence in applying religion to the</p>
<p>developments of every day. This strange suspension of religion</p>
<p>lasted over into the beginnings of the new age. It was the clear</p>
<p>vision of Marcus Karenin much more than any other contemporary</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1111">influence</a> which brought it back into the texture of human life.</p>
<p>He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1112">saw</a> religion without hallucinations, without superstitious</p>
<p>reverence, as a common thing as necessary as food and air, as</p>
<p>land and energy to the life of man and the well-being of the</p>
<p>Republic. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1112">saw</a> that indeed it had already percolated away from</p>
<p>the temples and hierarchies and symbols in which men had sought</p>
<p>to imprison it, that it was already at work anonymously and</p>
<p>obscurely in the universal <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1113">acceptance</a> of the greater <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1114">state</a>. He</p>
<p>gave it clearer expression, rephrased it to the lights and</p>
<p>perspectives of the new dawn…</p>
<p>But if we return to our novels for our evidence of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1115">spirit</a> of</p>
<p>the times it becomes evident as one reads them in their</p>
<p>chronological order, so far as that is now ascertainable, that as</p>
<p>one comes to the latter nineteenth and the earlier twentieth</p>
<p>century the writers are much more acutely aware of secular change</p>
<p>than their predecessors were. The earlier novelists tried to show</p>
<p>'life as it is,' the latter showed life as it changes. More and</p>
<p>more of their <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1116">characters</a> are engaged in adaptation to change or</p>
<p>suffering from the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1117">effects</a> of world changes. And as we come up</p>
<p>to the time of the Last Wars, this newer conception of the</p>
<p>everyday life as a reaction to an accelerated development is</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1118">continually</a> more manifest. Barnet's book, which has served us so</p>
<p>well, is frankly a picture of the world coming about like a ship</p>
<p>that sails into the wind. Our later novelists give a vast gallery</p>
<p>of individual conflicts in which old habits and customs, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1119">limited</a></p>
<p>ideas, ungenerous temperaments, and innate obsessions are pitted</p>
<p>against this great opening out of life that has happened to us.</p>
<p>They tell us of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1120">feelings</a> of old people who have been wrenched</p>
<p>away from familiar surroundings, and how they have had to make</p>
<p>peace with uncomfortable <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1121">comforts</a> and conveniences that are still</p>
<p>strange to them. They give us the discord between the opening</p>
<p>egotisms of youths and the ill-defined limitations of a changing</p>
<p>social life. They tell of the universal struggle of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1122">jealousy</a> to</p>
<p>capture and cripple our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1123">souls</a>, of romantic failures and tragical</p>
<p>misconceptions of the trend of the world, of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1115">spirit</a> of</p>
<p>adventure, and the urgency of curiosity, and how these serve the</p>
<p>universal drift. And all their stories lead in the end either to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1124">happiness</a> missed or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1124">happiness</a> won, to disaster or salvation. The</p>
<p>clearer their vision and the subtler their art, the more</p>
<p>certainly do these novels tell of the possibility of salvation</p>
<p>for all the world. For any road in life leads to religion for</p>
<p>those upon it who will follow it far enough…</p>
<p>It would have seemed a strange thing to the men of the former</p>
<p>time that it should be an open question as it is to-day whether</p>
<p>the world is wholly Christian or not Christian at all. But</p>
<p>assuredly we have the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1125">spirit</a>, and as surely have we left many</p>
<p>temporary <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1126">forms</a> behind. Christianity was the first expression of</p>
<p>world religion, the first complete repudiation of tribalism and</p>
<p>war and disputation. That it fell presently into the ways of more</p>
<p>ancient rituals cannot alter that. The common sense of mankind</p>
<p>has toiled through two thousand years of chastening <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1127">experience</a> to</p>
<p>find at last how sound a meaning attaches to the familiar phrases</p>
<p>of the Christian <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1128">faith</a>. The scientific <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1129">thinker</a> as he widens out</p>
<p>to the moral problems of the collective life, comes inevitably</p>
<p>upon the words of Christ, and as inevitably does the Christian,</p>
<p>as his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1130">thought</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1131">grows</a> clearer, arrive at the world republic. As</p>
<p>for the claims of the sects, as for the use of a name and</p>
<p>successions, we live in a time that has shaken itself free from</p>
<p>such claims and consistencies.</p>

<p>CHAPTER THE FIFTH</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THE LAST DAYS OF MARCUS KARENIN</p>
</title>
<p>Section 1</p>
<p>The second operation upon Marcus Karenin was performed at the new</p>
<p>station for surgical work at Paran, high in the Himalayas above</p>
<p>the Sutlej Gorge, where it comes down out of Thibet.</p>
<p>It is a place of such wildness and beauty as no other scenery in</p>
<p>the world affords. The granite terrace which runs round the four</p>
<p>sides of the low block of laboratories looks out in every</p>
<p>direction upon mountains. Far below in the hidden depths of a</p>
<p>shadowy blue cleft, the river pours down in its tumultuous</p>
<p>passage to the swarming plains of India. No sound of its roaring</p>
<p>haste comes up to those serenities. Beyond that blue gulf, in</p>
<p>which whole forests of giant deodars seem no more than small</p>
<p>patches of moss, rise vast precipices of many-coloured rock,</p>
<p>fretted above, lined by snowfalls, and jagged into pinnacles.</p>
<p>These are the northward wall of a towering wilderness of ice and</p>
<p>snow which clambers southward higher and wilder and vaster to the</p>
<p>culminating summits of our globe, to Dhaulagiri and Everest.</p>
<p>Here are cliffs of which no other land can show the like, and</p>
<p>deep chasms in which Mt. Blanc might be plunged and hidden. Here</p>
<p>are icefields as big as inland seas on which the tumbled boulders</p>
<p>lie so thickly that strange little flowers can bloom among them</p>
<p>under the untempered sunshine. To the northward, and blocking</p>
<p>out any vision of the uplands of Thibet, rises that citadel of</p>
<p>porcelain, that gothic pile, the Lio Porgyul, walls, towers, and</p>
<p>peaks, a clear twelve thousand feet of veined and splintered rock</p>
<p>above the river. And beyond it and eastward and westward rise</p>
<p>peaks behind peaks, against the dark blue Himalayan sky. Far</p>
<p>away below to the south the clouds of the Indian rains pile up</p>
<p>abruptly and are stayed by an invisible hand.</p>
<p>Hither it was that with a dreamlike swiftness Karenin flew high</p>
<p>over the irrigations of Rajputana and the towers and cupolas of</p>
<p>the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1132">ultimate</a> Delhi; and the little group of buildings, albeit the</p>
<p>southward wall dropped nearly five hundred feet, seemed to him as</p>
<p>he soared down to it like a toy lost among these mountain</p>
<p>wildernesses. No road came up to this place; it was reached only</p>
<p>by flight.</p>
<p>His pilot descended to the great courtyard, and Karenin assisted</p>
<p>by his secretary clambered down through the wing fabric and made</p>
<p>his way to the officials who came out to receive him.</p>
<p>In this place, beyond infections and noise and any distractions,</p>
<p>surgery had made for itself a house of research and a healing</p>
<p>fastness. The building itself would have seemed very wonderful to</p>
<p>eyes accustomed to the flimsy architecture of an age when power</p>
<p>was precious. It was made of granite, already a little roughened</p>
<p>on the outside by frost, but polished within and of a tremendous</p>
<p>solidity. And in a honeycomb of subtly lit apartments, were the</p>
<p>spotless research benches, the operating tables, the instruments</p>
<p>of brass, and fine glass and platinum and gold. Men and women</p>
<p>came from all parts of the world for study or experimental</p>
<p>research. They wore a common uniform of white and ate at long</p>
<p>tables together, but the patients lived in an upper part of the</p>
<p>buildings, and were cared for by nurses and skilled</p>
<p>attendants…</p>
<p>The first man to greet Karenin was Ciana, the scientific director</p>
<p>of the institution. Beside him was Rachel Borken, the chief</p>
<p>organiser. 'You are tired?' she asked, and old Karenin shook his</p>
<p>head.</p>
<p>'Cramped,' he said. 'I have wanted to visit such a place as</p>
<p>this.'</p>
<p>He spoke as if he had no other business with them.</p>
<p>There was a little pause.</p>
<p>'How many scientific people have you got here now?' he asked.</p>
<p>'Just three hundred and ninety-two,' said Rachel Borken.</p>
<p>'And the patients and attendants and so on?'</p>
<p>'Two thousand and thirty.'</p>
<p>'I shall be a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1133">patient</a>,' said Karenin. 'I shall have to be a</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1133">patient</a>. But I should like to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1134">see</a> things first. Presently I will</p>
<p>be a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1133">patient</a>.'</p>
<p>'You will come to my rooms?' suggested Ciana.</p>
<p>'And then I must talk to this doctor of yours,' said Karenin.</p>
<p>'But I would like to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1135">see</a> a bit of this place and talk to some of</p>
<p>your people before it comes to that.'</p>
<p>He winced and moved forward.</p>
<p>'I have left most of my work in order,' he said.</p>
<p>'You have been working hard up to now?' asked Rachel Borken.</p>
<p>'Yes. And now I have nothing more to do-and it seems strange…</p>
<p>And it's a bother, this illness and having to come down to</p>
<p>oneself. This doorway and the row of windows is well done; the</p>
<p>gray granite and just the line of gold, and then those mountains</p>
<p>beyond through that arch. It's very well done…'</p>
<p>Section 2</p>
<p>Karenin lay on the bed with a soft white rug about him, and</p>
<p>Fowler, who was to be his surgeon sat on the edge of the bed and</p>
<p>talked to him. An assistant was seated <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1136">quietly</a> in the shadow</p>
<p>behind the bed. The examination had been made, and Karenin <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1137">knew</a></p>
<p>what was before him. He was tired but serene.</p>
<p>'So I shall die,' he said, 'unless you operate?'</p>
<p>Fowler assented. 'And then,' said Karenin, smiling, 'probably I</p>
<p>shall die.'</p>
<p>'Not certainly.'</p>
<p>'Even if I do not die; shall I be able to work?'</p>
<p>'There is just a chance…'</p>
<p>'So firstly I shall probably die, and if I do not, then perhaps I</p>
<p>shall be a useless invalid?'</p>
<p>'I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1138">think</a> if you live, you may be able to go on-as you do now.'</p>
<p>'Well, then, I suppose I must take the risk of it. Yet couldn't</p>
<p>you, Fowler, couldn't you drug me and patch me instead of all</p>
<p>this-vivisection? A few days of drugged and active life-and</p>
<p>then the end?'</p>
<p>Fowler <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1139">thought</a>. 'We are not sure enough yet to do things like</p>
<p>that,' he said.</p>
<p>'But a day is coming when you will be certain.'</p>
<p>Fowler nodded.</p>
<p>'You make me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1140">feel</a> as though I was the last of</p>
<p>deformity-Deformity is uncertainty-inaccuracy. My body works</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1141">doubtfully</a>, it is not even sure that it will die or live. I</p>
<p>suppose the time is not far off when such bodies as mine will no</p>
<p>longer be born into the world.'</p>
<p>'You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1142">see</a>,' said Fowler, after a little pause, 'it is necessary</p>
<p>that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1143">spirits</a> such as yours should be born into the world.'</p>
<p>'I suppose,' said Karenin, 'that my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1144">spirit</a> has had its use. But</p>
<p>if you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1145">think</a> that is because my body is as it is I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1145">think</a> you are</p>
<p>mistaken. There is no peculiar <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1146">virtue</a> in defect. I have always</p>
<p>chafed against-all this. If I could have moved more freely and</p>
<p>lived a larger life in health I could have done more. But some</p>
<p>day perhaps you will be able to put a body that is wrong</p>
<p>altogether right again. Your science is only beginning. It's a</p>
<p>subtler thing than physics and chemistry, and it takes longer to</p>
<p>produce its miracles. And meanwhile a few more of us must die in</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1147">patience</a>.'</p>
<p>'Fine work is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1148">being</a> done and much of it,' said Fowler. 'I can</p>
<p>say as much because I have nothing to do with it. I can</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1149">understand</a> a lesson, appreciate the discoveries of abler men and</p>
<p>use my hands, but those others, Pigou, Masterton, Lie, and the</p>
<p>others, they are clearing the ground fast for the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1150">knowledge</a> to</p>
<p>come. Have you had time to follow their work?'</p>
<p>Karenin shook his head. 'But I can imagine the scope of it,' he</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>'We have so many men working now,' said Fowler. 'I suppose at</p>
<p>present there must be at least a thousand <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1151">thinking</a> hard,</p>
<p>observing, experimenting, for one who did so in nineteen</p>
<p>hundred.'</p>
<p>'Not counting those who keep the records?'</p>
<p>'Not counting those. Of course, the present indexing of research</p>
<p>is in itself a very big work, and it is only now that we are</p>
<p>getting it properly done. But already we are <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1152">feeling</a> the benefit</p>
<p>of that. Since it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1153">ceased</a> to be a paid employment and became a</p>
<p>devotion we have had only those people who obeyed the call of an</p>
<p>aptitude at work upon these things. Here-I must show you it</p>
<p>to-day, because it will interest you-we have our copy of the</p>
<p>encyclopaedic index-every week sheets are taken out and replaced</p>
<p>by fresh sheets with new results that are brought to us by the</p>
<p>aeroplanes of the Research Department. It is an index of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1154">knowledge</a> that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1155">grows</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1156">continually</a>, an index that becomes</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1156">continually</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1157">truer</a>. There was never anything like it before.'</p>
<p>'When I came into the education committee,' said Karenin, 'that</p>
<p>index of human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1158">knowledge</a> seemed an impossible thing. Research had</p>
<p>produced a chaotic mountain of results, in a hundred languages</p>
<p>and a thousand different types of publication…' He smiled</p>
<p>at his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1159">memories</a>. 'How we groaned at the job!'</p>
<p>'Already the ordering of that chaos is nearly done. You shall</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1160">see</a>.'</p>
<p>'I have been so busy with my own work--Yes, I shall be glad to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1161">see</a>.'</p>
<p>The <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1162">patient</a> regarded the surgeon for a time with interested eyes.</p>
<p>'You work here always?' he asked abruptly.</p>
<p>'No,' said Fowler.</p>
<p>'But mostly you work here?'</p>
<p>'I have worked about seven years out of the past ten. At times I</p>
<p>go away-down there. One has to. At least I have to. There is a</p>
<p>sort of grayness comes over all this, one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1163">feels</a> hungry for life,</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1164">real</a>, personal passionate life, love-making, eating and drinking</p>
<p>for the fun of the thing, jostling crowds, having adventures,</p>
<p>laughter-above all laughter--'</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Karenin <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1165">understandingly</a>.</p>
<p>'And then one day, suddenly one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1166">thinks</a> of these high mountains</p>
<p>again…'</p>
<p>'That is how I would have lived, if it had not been for</p>
<p>my-defects,' said Karenin. 'Nobody <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1167">knows</a> but those who have</p>
<p>borne it the exasperation of abnormality. It will be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1168">good</a> when</p>
<p>you have nobody alive whose body cannot live the wholesome</p>
<p>everyday life, whose <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1169">spirit</a> cannot come up into these high places</p>
<p>as it wills.'</p>
<p>'We shall manage that soon,' said Fowler.</p>
<p>'For endless generations man has struggled upward against the</p>
<p>indignities of his body-and the indignities of his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1170">soul</a>. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1171">Pains</a>,</p>
<p>incapacities, vile <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1172">fears</a>, black moods, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1173">despairs</a>. How well I've</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1174">known</a> them. They've taken more time than all your holidays. It</p>
<p>is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1175">true</a>, is it not, that every man is something of a cripple and</p>
<p>something of a beast? I've dipped a little deeper than most;</p>
<p>that's all. It's only now when he has fully learnt the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1176">truth</a> of</p>
<p>that, that he can take hold of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1177">himself</a> to be neither beast nor</p>
<p>cripple. Now that he overcomes his servitude to his body, he can</p>
<p>for the first time <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1178">think</a> of living the full life of his body…</p>
<p>Before another generation dies you'll have the thing in hand.</p>
<p>You'll do as you please with the old Adam and all the vestiges</p>
<p>from the brutes and reptiles that lurk in his body and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1179">spirit</a>.</p>
<p>Isn't that so?'</p>
<p>'You put it boldly,' said Fowler.</p>
<p>Karenin laughed cheerfully at his caution… 'When,' asked</p>
<p>Karenin suddenly, 'when will you operate?'</p>
<p>'The day after to-morrow,' said Fowler. 'For a day I want you to</p>
<p>drink and eat as I shall prescribe. And you may <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1180">think</a> and talk</p>
<p>as you please.'</p>
<p>'I should like to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1181">see</a> this place.'</p>
<p>'You shall go through it this afternoon. I will have two men</p>
<p>carry you in a litter. And to-morrow you shall lie out upon the</p>
<p>terrace. Our mountains here are the most beautiful in the</p>
<p>world…'</p>
<p>Section 3</p>
<p>The next morning Karenin got up early and watched the sun rise</p>
<p>over the mountains, and breakfasted lightly, and then young</p>
<p>Gardener, his secretary, came to consult him upon the spending of</p>
<p>his day. Would he care to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1182">see</a> people? Or was this gnawing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1183">pain</a></p>
<p>within him too much to permit him to do that?</p>
<p>'I'd like to talk,' said Karenin. 'There must be all sorts of</p>
<p>lively-minded people here. Let them come and gossip with me. It</p>
<p>will distract me-and I can't tell you how interesting it makes</p>
<p>everything that is going on to have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1184">seen</a> the dawn of one's own</p>
<p>last day.'</p>
<p>'Your last day!'</p>
<p>'Fowler will kill me.'</p>
<p>'But he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1185">thinks</a> not.'</p>
<p>'Fowler will kill me. If he does not he will not leave very much</p>
<p>of me. So that this is my last day anyhow, the days afterwards if</p>
<p>they come at all to me, will be refuse. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1186">know</a>…'</p>
<p>Gardener was about to speak when Karenin went on again.</p>
<p>'I hope he kills me, Gardener. Don't be-old-fashioned. The</p>
<p>thing <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1187">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1188">am</a> most afraid of is that last rag of life. I may just go</p>
<p>on-a scarred salvage of suffering stuff. And then-all the</p>
<p>things I have hidden and kept down or discounted or set right</p>
<p>afterwards will get the better of me. I shall be peevish. I may</p>
<p>lose my grip upon my own egotism. It's never been a very firm</p>
<p>grip. No, no, Gardener, don't say that! You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1189">know</a> better, you've</p>
<p>had glimpses of it. Suppose I came through on the other side of</p>
<p>this affair, belittled, vain, and spiteful, using the prestige I</p>
<p>have got among men by my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1190">good</a> work in the past just to serve some</p>
<p>small invalid purpose…'</p>
<p>He was silent for a time, watching the mists among the distant</p>
<p>precipices change to clouds of light, and drift and dissolve</p>
<p>before the searching rays of the sunrise.</p>
<p>'Yes,' he said at last, 'I am afraid of these anaesthetics and</p>
<p>these fag ends of life. It's life we are all afraid of.</p>
<p>Death!-nobody <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1191">minds</a> just death. Fowler is clever-but some day</p>
<p>surgery will <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1192">know</a> its duty better and not be so anxious just to</p>
<p>save something… provided only that it quivers. I've tried to</p>
<p>hold my end up properly and do my work. After Fowler has done</p>
<p>with me <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1193">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1194">am</a> certain I shall be unfit for work-and what else is</p>
<p>there for me?… I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1192">know</a> I shall not be fit for work…</p>
<p>'I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1195">see</a> why life should be judged by its last trailing</p>
<p>thread of vitality… I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1196">know</a> it for the splendid thing it is-I</p>
<p>who have been a diseased creature from the beginning. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1196">know</a> it</p>
<p>well enough not to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1197">confuse</a> it with its husks. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1198">Remember</a> that,</p>
<p>Gardener, if presently my heart fails me and I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1199">despair</a>, and if I</p>
<p>go through a little phase of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1200">pain</a> and ingratitude and dark</p>
<p>forgetfulness before the end… Don't believe what I may say at</p>
<p>the last… If the fabric is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1201">good</a> enough the selvage doesn't</p>
<p>matter. It can't matter. So long as you are alive you are just</p>
<p>the moment, perhaps, but when you are dead then you are all your</p>
<p>life from the first moment to the last…'</p>
<p>Section 4</p>
<p>Presently, in accordance with his wish, people came to talk to</p>
<p>him, and he could forget <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1202">himself</a> again. Rachel Borken sat for a</p>
<p>long time with him and talked chiefly of women in the world, and</p>
<p>with her was a girl named Edith Haydon who was already very well</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1203">known</a> as a cytologist. And several of the younger men who were</p>
<p>working in the place and a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1204">patient</a> named Kahn, a poet, and</p>
<p>Edwards, a designer of plays and shows, spent some time with him.</p>
<p>The talk wandered from point to point and came back upon itself,</p>
<p>and became now earnest and now trivial as the chance suggestions</p>
<p>determined. But soon afterwards Gardener wrote down notes of</p>
<p>things he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1205">remembered</a>, and it is possible to put together again</p>
<p>the outlook of Karenin upon the world and how he <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1206">thought</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1207">felt</a></p>
<p>about many of the principal things in life.</p>
<p>'Our age,' he said, 'has been so far an age of scene-shifting. We</p>
<p>have been preparing a stage, clearing away the setting of a drama</p>
<p>that was played out and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1208">growing</a> tiresome… If I could but sit</p>
<p>out the first few scenes of the new spectacle…</p>
<p>'How encumbered the world had become! It was ailing as <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1209">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1210">am</a></p>
<p>ailing with a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1211">growth</a> of unmeaning things. It was entangled,</p>
<p>feverish, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1212">confused</a>. It was in sore need of release, and I suppose</p>
<p>that nothing less than the violence of those bombs could have</p>
<p>released it and made it a healthy world again. I suppose they</p>
<p>were necessary. Just as everything turns to evil in a fevered</p>
<p>body so everything seemed turning to evil in those last years of</p>
<p>the old time. Everywhere there were obsolete organisations</p>
<p>seizing upon all the new fine things that science was giving to</p>
<p>the world, nationalities, all sorts of political bodies, the</p>
<p>churches and sects, proprietorship, seizing upon those treat</p>
<p>powers and limitless possibilities and turning them to evil uses.</p>
<p>And they would not suffer open speech, they would not permit of</p>
<p>education, they would let no one be educated to the needs of the</p>
<p>new time… You who are younger cannot imagine the mixture of</p>
<p>desperate hope and protesting <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1213">despair</a> in which we who could</p>
<p>believe in the possibilities of science lived in those years</p>
<p>before atomic energy came…</p>
<p>'It was not only that the mass of people would not attend, would</p>
<p>not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1214">understand</a>, but that those who did <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1214">understand</a> lacked the</p>
<p>power of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1215">real</a> belief. They said the things, they <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1216">saw</a> the things,</p>
<p>and the things meant nothing to them…</p>
<p>'I have been reading some old papers lately. It is wonderful how</p>
<p>our fathers bore <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1217">themselves</a> towards science. They <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1218">hated</a> it. They</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1219">feared</a> it. They permitted a few scientific men to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1220">exist</a> and</p>
<p>work-a pitiful handful… "Don't find out anything about us,"</p>
<p>they said to them; "don't inflict vision upon us, spare our</p>
<p>little ways of life from the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1221">fearful</a> shaft of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1222">understanding</a>. But</p>
<p>do tricks for us, little <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1223">limited</a> tricks. Give us cheap lighting.</p>
<p>And cure us of certain disagreeable things, cure us of cancer,</p>
<p>cure us of consumption, cure our colds and relieve us after</p>
<p>repletion…" We have changed all that, Gardener. Science is no</p>
<p>longer our servant. We <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1224">know</a> it for something greater than our</p>
<p>little individual <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1225">selves</a>. It is the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1226">awakening</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1227">mind</a> of the race,</p>
<p>and in a little while--In a little while--I wish indeed I</p>
<p>could watch for that little while, now that the curtain has</p>
<p>risen…</p>
<p>'While I lie here they are clearing up what is left of the bombs</p>
<p>in London,' he said. 'Then they are going to repair the ruins</p>
<p>and make it all as like as possible to its former <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1228">condition</a></p>
<p>before the bombs fell. Perhaps they will dig out the old house in</p>
<p>St John's Wood to which my father went after his expulsion from</p>
<p>Russia… That London of my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1229">memories</a> seems to me like a place in</p>
<p>another world. For you younger people it must seem like a place</p>
<p>that could never have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1230">existed</a>.'</p>
<p>'Is there much left standing?' asked Edith Haydon.</p>
<p>'Square miles that are scarcely shaken in the south and</p>
<p>north-west, they say; and most of the bridges and large areas of</p>
<p>dock. Westminster, which held most of the government offices,</p>
<p>suffered badly from the small bomb that destroyed the Parliament,</p>
<p>there are very few traces of the old thoroughfare of Whitehall or</p>
<p>the Government region thereabout, but there are plentiful</p>
<p>drawings to scale of its buildings, and the great hole in the</p>
<p>east of London scarcely matters. That was a poor district and</p>
<p>very like the north and the south… It will be possible to</p>
<p>reconstruct most of it… It is wanted. Already it becomes</p>
<p>difficult to recall the old time-even for us who <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1231">saw</a> it.'</p>
<p>'It seems very distant to me,' said the girl.</p>
<p>'It was an unwholesome world,' reflected Karenin. 'I seem to</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1232">remember</a> everybody about my childhood as if they were ill. They</p>
<p>were ill. They were sick with <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1233">confusion</a>. Everybody was anxious</p>
<p>about money and everybody was doing uncongenial things. They ate</p>
<p>a queer mixture of foods, either too much or too little, and at</p>
<p>odd hours. One <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1234">sees</a> how ill they were by their advertisements.</p>
<p>All this new region of London they are opening up now is</p>
<p>plastered with advertisements of pills. Everybody must have been</p>
<p>taking pills. In one of the hotel rooms in the Strand they have</p>
<p>found the luggage of a lady covered up by falling rubble and</p>
<p>unburnt, and she was equipped with nine different sorts of pill</p>
<p>and tabloid. The pill-carrying age followed the weapon-carrying</p>
<p>age. They are equally strange to us. People's skins must have</p>
<p>been in a vile <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1235">state</a>. Very few people were properly washed; they</p>
<p>carried the filth of months on their clothes. All the clothes</p>
<p>they wore were old clothes; our way of pulping our clothes again</p>
<p>after a week or so of wear would have seemed fantastic to them.</p>
<p>Their clothing hardly bears <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1236">thinking</a> about. And the congestion</p>
<p>of them! Everybody was jostling against everybody in those awful</p>
<p>towns. In an uproar. People were run over and crushed by the</p>
<p>hundred; every year in London the cars and omnibuses <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1237">alone</a> killed</p>
<p>or disabled twenty thousand people, in Paris it was worse; people</p>
<p>used to fall dead for want of air in the crowded ways. The</p>
<p>irritation of London, internal and external, must have been</p>
<p>maddening. It was a maddened world. It is like <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1236">thinking</a> of a</p>
<p>sick child. One has the same <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1238">effect</a> of feverish urgencies and</p>
<p>acute irrational disappointments.</p>
<p>'All history,' he said, 'is a record of a childhood…</p>
<p>'And yet not exactly a childhood. There is something clean and</p>
<p>keen about even a sick child-and something <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1239">touching</a>. But so much</p>
<p>of the old times makes one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1240">angry</a>. So much they did seems grossly</p>
<p>stupid, obstinately, outrageously stupid, which is the very</p>
<p>opposite to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1241">being</a> fresh and young.</p>
<p>'I was reading only the other day about Bismarck, that hero of</p>
<p>nineteenth-century politics, that sequel to Napoleon, that god of</p>
<p>blood and iron. And he was just a beery, obstinate, dull man.</p>
<p>Indeed, that is what he was, the commonest, coarsest man, who</p>
<p>ever became great. I looked at his portraits, a heavy, almost</p>
<p>froggish face, with projecting eyes and a thick moustache to hide</p>
<p>a poor mouth. He aimed at nothing but Germany, Germany</p>
<p>emphasised, indurated, enlarged; Germany and his class in</p>
<p>Germany; beyond that he had no ideas, he was inaccessible to</p>
<p>ideas; his <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1242">mind</a> never rose for a recorded instant above a</p>
<p>bumpkin's elaborate cunning. And he was the most <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1243">influential</a> man</p>
<p>in the world, in the whole world, no man ever left so deep a mark</p>
<p>on it, because everywhere there were gross men to resonate to the</p>
<p>heavy notes he emitted. He trampled on ten thousand lovely</p>
<p>things, and a kind of malice in these louts made it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1244">pleasant</a> to</p>
<p>them to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1245">see</a> him trample. No-he was no child; the dull, national</p>
<p>aggressiveness he stood for, no childishness. Childhood is</p>
<p>promise. He was survival.</p>
<p>'All Europe offered its children to him, it sacrificed education,</p>
<p>art, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1246">happiness</a> and all its hopes of future welfare to follow the</p>
<p>clatter of his sabre. The monstrous worship of that old fool's</p>
<p>"blood and iron" passed all round the earth. Until the atomic</p>
<p>bombs burnt our way to freedom again…'</p>
<p>'One <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1247">thinks</a> of him now as one <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1247">thinks</a> of the megatherium,' said</p>
<p>one of the young men.</p>
<p>'From first to last mankind made three million big guns and a</p>
<p>hundred thousand complicated great ships for no other purpose but</p>
<p>war.'</p>
<p>'Were there no sane men in those days,' asked the young man, 'to</p>
<p>stand against that idolatry?'</p>
<p>'In a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1248">state</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1249">despair</a>,' said Edith Haydon.</p>
<p>'He is so far off-and there are men alive still who were alive</p>
<p>when Bismarck died!'… said the young man…</p>
<p>Section 5</p>
<p>'And yet it may be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1250">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1251">am</a> unjust to Bismarck,' said Karenin,</p>
<p>following his own <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1252">thoughts</a>. 'You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1253">see</a>, men belong to their own</p>
<p>age; we stand upon a common stock of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1252">thought</a> and we fancy we</p>
<p>stand upon the ground. I met a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1254">pleasant</a> man the other day, a</p>
<p>Maori, whose great-grandfather was a cannibal. It chanced he had</p>
<p>a daguerreotype of the old sinner, and the two were marvellously</p>
<p>alike. One <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1255">felt</a> that a little juggling with time and either</p>
<p>might have been the other. People are cruel and stupid in a</p>
<p>stupid age who might be gentle and splendid in a gracious one.</p>
<p>The world also has its moods. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1256">Think</a> of the mental food of</p>
<p>Bismarck's childhood; the humiliations of Napoleon's victories,</p>
<p>the crowded, crowning victory of the Battle of the Nations…</p>
<p>Everybody in those days, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1257">wise</a> or foolish, believed that the</p>
<p>division of the world under a multitude of governments was</p>
<p>inevitable, and that it was going on for thousands of years more.</p>
<p>It WAS inevitable until it was impossible. Any one who had denied</p>
<p>that inevitability publicly would have been counted-oh! a SILLY</p>
<p>fellow. Old Bismarck was only just a little-forcible, on the</p>
<p>lines of the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1258">accepted</a> ideas. That is all. He <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1252">thought</a> that since</p>
<p>there had to be national governments he would make one that was</p>
<p>strong at home and invincible abroad. Because he had fed with a</p>
<p>kind of rough appetite upon what we can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1253">see</a> now were very stupid</p>
<p>ideas, that does not make him a stupid man. We've had advantages;</p>
<p>we've had unity and collectivism blasted into our brains. Where</p>
<p>should we be now but for the grace of science? I should have been</p>
<p>an embittered, spiteful, downtrodden member of the Russian</p>
<p>Intelligenza, a conspirator, a prisoner, or an assassin. You, my</p>
<p>dear, would have been breaking dingy windows as a suffragette.'</p>
<p>'NEVER,' said Edith stoutly…</p>
<p>For a time the talk broke into humorous personalities, and the</p>
<p>young people gibed at each other across the smiling old</p>
<p>administrator, and then presently one of the young scientific men</p>
<p>gave things a new turn. He spoke like one who was full to the</p>
<p>brim.</p>
<p>'You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1259">know</a>, sir, I've a fancy-it is hard to prove such</p>
<p>things-that civilisation was very near disaster when the atomic</p>
<p>bombs came banging into it, that if there had been no Holsten and</p>
<p>no induced radio-activity, the world would have-smashed-much as</p>
<p>it did. Only instead of its <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1260">being</a> a smash that opened a way to</p>
<p>better things, it might have been a smash without a recovery. It</p>
<p>is part of my business to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1261">understand</a> economics, and from that</p>
<p>point of view the century before Holsten was just a hundred</p>
<p>years' crescendo of waste. Only the extreme individualism of that</p>
<p>period, only its utter want of any collective <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1262">understanding</a> or</p>
<p>purpose can explain that waste. Mankind used up</p>
<p>material-insanely. They had got through three-quarters of all</p>
<p>the coal in the planet, they had used up most of the oil, they</p>
<p>had swept away their forests, and they were running short of tin</p>
<p>and copper. Their wheat areas were getting weary and populous,</p>
<p>and many of the big towns had so lowered the water level of their</p>
<p>available hills that they suffered a drought every summer. The</p>
<p>whole system was rushing towards bankruptcy. And they were</p>
<p>spending every year vaster and vaster amounts of power and energy</p>
<p>upon military preparations, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1263">continually</a> expanding the debt of</p>
<p>industry to capital. The system was already staggering when</p>
<p>Holsten began his researches. So far as the world in general went</p>
<p>there was no sense of danger and no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1264">desire</a> for inquiry. They had</p>
<p>no belief that science could save them, nor any idea that there</p>
<p>was a need to be saved. They could not, they would not, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1265">see</a> the</p>
<p>gulf beneath their feet. It was pure <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1266">good</a> luck for mankind at</p>
<p>large that any research at all was in progress. And as I say,</p>
<p>sir, if that line of escape hadn't opened, before now there might</p>
<p>have been a crash, revolution, panic, social disintegration,</p>
<p>famine, and-it is conceivable-complete disorder… The</p>
<p>rails might have rusted on the disused railways by now, the</p>
<p>telephone poles have rotted and fallen, the big liners dropped</p>
<p>into sheet-iron in the ports; the burnt, deserted cities become</p>
<p>the ruinous hiding-places of gangs of robbers. We might have been</p>
<p>brigands in a shattered and attenuated world. Ah, you may smile,</p>
<p>but that had happened before in human history. The world is still</p>
<p>studded with the ruins of broken-down civilisations. Barbaric</p>
<p>bands made their fastness upon the Acropolis, and the tomb of</p>
<p>Hadrian became a fortress that warred across the ruins of Rome</p>
<p>against the Colosseum… Had all that possibility of reaction</p>
<p>ended so certainly in 1940? Is it all so very far away even</p>
<p>now?'</p>
<p>'It seems far enough away now,' said Edith Haydon.</p>
<p>'But forty years ago?'</p>
<p>'No,' said Karenin with his eyes upon the mountains, 'I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1267">think</a> you</p>
<p>underrate the available intelligence in those early decades of</p>
<p>the twentieth century. Officially, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1268">know</a>, politically, that</p>
<p>intelligence didn't tell-but it was there. And I question your</p>
<p>hypothesis. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1269">doubt</a> if that discovery could have been delayed.</p>
<p>There is a kind of inevitable logic now in the progress of</p>
<p>research. For a hundred years and more <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1270">thought</a> and science have</p>
<p>been going their own way regardless of the common events of life.</p>
<p>You see-they have got loose. If there had been no Holsten there</p>
<p>would have been some similar man. If atomic energy had not come</p>
<p>in one year it would have come in another. In decadent Rome the</p>
<p>march of science had scarcely begun… Nineveh, Babylon, Athens,</p>
<p>Syracuse, Alexandria, these were the first rough experiments in</p>
<p>association that made a security, a breathing-space, in which</p>
<p>inquiry was born. Man had to experiment before he found out the</p>
<p>way to begin. But already two hundred years ago he had fairly</p>
<p>begun… The politics and dignities and wars of the nineteenth</p>
<p>and twentieth centuries were only the last phoenix blaze of the</p>
<p>former civilisation flaring up about the beginnings of the new.</p>
<p>Which we serve… 'Man lives in the dawn for ever,' said</p>
<p>Karenin. 'Life is beginning and nothing else but beginning. It</p>
<p>begins everlastingly. Each step seems vaster than the last, and</p>
<p>does but gather us together for the nest. This Modern State of</p>
<p>ours, which would have been a Utopian marvel a hundred years ago,</p>
<p>is already the commonplace of life. But as I sit here and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1271">dream</a></p>
<p>of the possibilities in the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1272">mind</a> of man that now gather to a head</p>
<p>beneath the shelter of its peace, these great mountains here seem</p>
<p>but little things…'</p>
<p>Section 6</p>
<p>About eleven Karenin had his midday meal, and afterwards he slept</p>
<p>among his artificial furs and pillows for two hours. Then he</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1273">awoke</a> and some tea was brought to him, and he attended to a small</p>
<p>difficulty in connection with the Moravian schools in the</p>
<p>Labrador country and in Greenland that Gardener <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1274">knew</a> would</p>
<p>interest him. He remained <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1275">alone</a> for a little while after that,</p>
<p>and then the two women came to him again. Afterwards Edwards and</p>
<p>Kahn joined the group, and the talk fell upon love and the place</p>
<p>of women in the renascent world. The cloudbanks of India lay</p>
<p>under a quivering haze, and the blaze of the sun fell full upon</p>
<p>the eastward precipices. Ever and again as they talked, some vast</p>
<p>splinter of rock would crack and come away from these, or a wild</p>
<p>rush of snow and ice and stone, pour down in thunder, hang like a</p>
<p>wet thread into the gulfs below, and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1276">cease</a>…</p>
<p>Section 7</p>
<p>For a time Karenin said very little, and Kahn, the popular poet,</p>
<p>talked of passionate love. He said that passionate, personal</p>
<p>love had been the abiding <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1277">desire</a> of humanity since ever humanity</p>
<p>had begun, and now only was it becoming a possible <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1278">experience</a>. It</p>
<p>had been a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1279">dream</a> that generation after generation had pursued,</p>
<p>that always men had lost on the verge of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1280">attainment</a>. To most of</p>
<p>those who had sought it obstinately it had brought tragedy. Now,</p>
<p>lifted above sordid distresses, men and women might hope for</p>
<p>realised and triumphant love. This age was the Dawn of Love…</p>
<p>Karenin remained downcast and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1281">thoughtful</a> while Kahn said these</p>
<p>things. Against that continued silence Kahn's voice presently</p>
<p>seemed to beat and fail. He had begun by addressing Karenin, but</p>
<p>presently he was including Edith Haydon and Rachel Borken in his</p>
<p>appeal. Rachel listened silently; Edith watched Karenin and very</p>
<p>deliberately avoided Kahn's eyes.</p>
<p>'I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1282">know</a>,' said Karenin at last, 'that many people are saying this</p>
<p>sort of thing. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1282">know</a> that there is a vast release of</p>
<p>love-making in the world. This great wave of decoration and</p>
<p>elaboration that has gone about the world, this Efflorescence,</p>
<p>has of course laid hold of that. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1282">know</a> that when you say that</p>
<p>the world is set free, you interpret that to mean that the world</p>
<p>is set free for love-making. Down there,-under the clouds, the</p>
<p>lovers foregather. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1282">know</a> your songs, Kahn, your half-mystical</p>
<p>songs, in which you represent this old hard world dissolving into</p>
<p>a luminous haze of love-sexual love… I don't <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1283">think</a> you are</p>
<p>right or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1284">true</a> in that. You are a young, imaginative man, and you</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1285">see</a> life-ardently-with the eyes of youth. But the power that</p>
<p>has brought man into these high places under this blue-veiled</p>
<p>blackness of the sky and which beckons us on towards the immense</p>
<p>and awful future of our race, is riper and deeper and greater</p>
<p>than any such <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1286">emotions</a>…</p>
<p>'All through my life-it has been a necessary part of my work-I</p>
<p>have had to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1287">think</a> of this release of sexual love and the riddles</p>
<p>that perfect freedom and almost limitless power will put to the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1288">soul</a> of our race. I can <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1289">see</a> now, all over the world, a beautiful</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1290">ecstasy</a> of waste; "Let us sing and rejoice and be lovely and</p>
<p>wonderful."… The orgy is only beginning, Kahn… It was</p>
<p>inevitable-but it is not the end of mankind…</p>
<p>'Think what we are. It is but a yesterday in the endlessness of</p>
<p>time that life was a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1291">dreaming</a> thing, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1291">dreaming</a> so deeply that it</p>
<p>forgot itself as it <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1291">dreamt</a>, its lives, its individual instincts,</p>
<p>its moments, were born and wondered and played and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1292">desired</a> and</p>
<p>hungered and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1293">grew</a> weary and died. Incalculable successions of</p>
<p>vision, visions of sunlit jungle, river wilderness, wild forest,</p>
<p>eager <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1292">desire</a>, beating hearts, soaring wings and creeping terror</p>
<p>flamed hotly and then were as though they had never been. Life</p>
<p>was an uneasiness across which lights played and vanished. And</p>
<p>then we came, man came, and opened eyes that were a question and</p>
<p>hands that were a demand and began a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1294">mind</a> and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1295">memory</a> that dies</p>
<p>not when men die, but lives and increases for ever, an over-mind,</p>
<p>a dominating will, a question and an aspiration that reaches to</p>
<p>the stars… Hunger and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1296">fear</a> and this that you make so much of,</p>
<p>this sex, are but the elementals of life out of which we have</p>
<p>arisen. All these elementals, I grant you, have to be provided</p>
<p>for, dealt with, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1297">satisfied</a>, but all these things have to be left</p>
<p>behind.'</p>
<p>'But Love,' said Kahn.</p>
<p>'I speak of sexual love and the love of intimate persons. And</p>
<p>that is what you mean, Kahn.'</p>
<p>Karenin shook his head. 'You cannot stay at the roots and climb</p>
<p>the tree,' he said…</p>
<p>'No,' he said after a pause, 'this sexual excitement, this love</p>
<p>story, is just a part of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1298">growing</a> up and we <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1299">grow</a> out of it. So far</p>
<p>literature and art and sentiment and all our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1300">emotional</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1301">forms</a> have</p>
<p>been almost altogether adolescent, plays and stories, delights</p>
<p>and hopes, they have all turned on that marvellous discovery of</p>
<p>the love interest, but life lengthens out now and the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1302">mind</a> of</p>
<p>adult humanity <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1303">detaches</a> itself. Poets who used to die at thirty</p>
<p>live now to eighty-five. You, too, Kahn! There are endless years</p>
<p>yet for you-and all full of learning… We carry an excessive</p>
<p>burden of sex and sexual tradition still, and we have to free</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1304">ourselves</a> from it. We do free <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1304">ourselves</a> from it. We have learnt</p>
<p>in a thousand different ways to hold back death, and this sex,</p>
<p>which in the old barbaric days was just sufficient to balance our</p>
<p>dying, is now like a hammer that has lost its anvil, it plunges</p>
<p>through human life. You poets, you young people want to turn it</p>
<p>to delight. Turn it to delight. That may be one way out. In a</p>
<p>little while, if you have any brains worth <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1305">thinking</a> about, you</p>
<p>will be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1306">satisfied</a>, and then you will come up here to the greater</p>
<p>things. The old religions and their new offsets want still, I</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1307">see</a>, to suppress all these things. Let them suppress. If they</p>
<p>can suppress. In their own people. Either road will bring you</p>
<p>here at last to the eternal search for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1308">knowledge</a> and the great</p>
<p>adventure of power.'</p>
<p>'But incidentally,' said Rachel Borken; 'incidentally you have</p>
<p>half of humanity, you have womankind, very much specialised</p>
<p>for-for this love and reproduction that is so much less needed</p>
<p>than it was.'</p>
<p>'Both sexes are specialised for love and reproduction,' said</p>
<p>Karenin.</p>
<p>'But the women carry the heavier burden.'</p>
<p>'Not in their imaginations,' said Edwards.</p>
<p>'And surely,' said Kahn, 'when you speak of love as a</p>
<p>phase-isn't it a necessary phase? Quite apart from reproduction</p>
<p>the love of the sexes is necessary. Isn't it love, sexual love,</p>
<p>which has released the imagination? Without that stir, without</p>
<p>that impulse to go out from <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1309">ourselves</a>, to be reckless of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1309">ourselves</a> and wonderful, would our lives be anything more than</p>
<p>the contentment of the stalled ox?'</p>
<p>'The key that opens the door,' said Karenin, 'is not the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1310">goal</a> of</p>
<p>the journey.'</p>
<p>'But women!' cried Rachel. 'Here we are! What is our future-as</p>
<p>women? Is it only that we have unlocked the doors of the</p>
<p>imagination for you men? Let us speak of this question now. It</p>
<p>is a thing constantly in my <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1311">thoughts</a>, Karenin. What do you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1312">think</a></p>
<p>of us? You who must have <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1311">thought</a> so much of these perplexities.'</p>
<p>Karenin seemed to weigh his words. He spoke very deliberately.</p>
<p>'I do not care a rap about your future-as women. I do not care</p>
<p>a rap about the future of men-as males. I want to destroy these</p>
<p>peculiar futures. I care for your future as intelligences, as</p>
<p>parts of and contribution to the universal <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1313">mind</a> of the race.</p>
<p>Humanity is not only naturally over-specialised in these matters,</p>
<p>but all its institutions, its customs, everything, exaggerate,</p>
<p>intensify this difference. I want to unspecialise women. No new</p>
<p>idea. Plato wanted exactly that. I do not want to go on as we go</p>
<p>now, emphasising this natural difference; I do not deny it, but I</p>
<p>want to reduce it and overcome it.'</p>
<p>'And-we remain women,' said Rachel Borken. 'Need you remain</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1314">thinking</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1315">yourselves</a> as women?'</p>
<p>'It is forced upon us,' said Edith Haydon.</p>
<p>'I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1316">think</a> a woman becomes less of a woman because she</p>
<p>dresses and works like a man,' said Edwards. 'You women here, I</p>
<p>mean you scientific women, wear white clothing like the men,</p>
<p>twist up your hair in the simplest fashion, go about your work as</p>
<p>though there was only one sex in the world. You are just as much</p>
<p>women, even if you are not so feminine, as the fine ladies down</p>
<p>below there in the plains who dress for excitement and display,</p>
<p>whose only <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1317">thoughts</a> are of lovers, who exaggerate every</p>
<p>difference… Indeed we love you more.'</p>
<p>'But we go about our work,' said Edith Haydon.</p>
<p>'So does it matter?' asked Rachel.</p>
<p>'If you go about your work and if the men go about their work</p>
<p>then for Heaven's sake be as much woman as you wish,' said</p>
<p>Karenin. 'When I ask you to unspecialise, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1318">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1319">am</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1320">thinking</a> not of</p>
<p>the abolition of sex, but the abolition of the irksome,</p>
<p>restricting, obstructive obsession with sex. It may be <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1321">true</a> that</p>
<p>sex made society, that the first society was the sex-cemented</p>
<p>family, the first <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1322">state</a> a confederacy of blood <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1323">relations</a>, the</p>
<p>first laws sexual taboos. Until a few years ago morality meant</p>
<p>proper sexual <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1324">behaviour</a>. Up to within a few years of us the</p>
<p>chief interest and motive of an ordinary man was to keep and rule</p>
<p>a woman and her children and the chief concern of a woman was to</p>
<p>get a man to do that. That was the drama, that was life. And the</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1325">jealousy</a> of these demands was the master motive in the world. You</p>
<p>said, Kahn, a little while ago that sexual love was the key that</p>
<p>let one out from the solitude of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1326">self</a>, but I tell you that so far</p>
<p>it has only done so in order to lock us all up again in a</p>
<p>solitude of two… All that may have been necessary but it is</p>
<p>necessary no longer. All that has changed and changes still very</p>
<p>swiftly. Your future, Rachel, AS WOMEN, is a diminishing future.'</p>
<p>'Karenin?' asked Rachel, 'do you mean that women are to become</p>
<p>men?'</p>
<p>'Men and women have to become human beings.'</p>
<p>'You would abolish women? But, Karenin, listen! There is more</p>
<p>than sex in this. Apart from sex we are different from you. We</p>
<p>take up life differently. Forget we are-females, Karenin, and</p>
<p>still we are a different sort of human <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1327">being</a> with a different</p>
<p>use. In some things we are amazingly secondary. Here am I in</p>
<p>this place because of my trick of management, and Edith is here</p>
<p>because of her <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1328">patient</a>, subtle hands. That does not alter the</p>
<p>fact that nearly the whole body of science is man made; that does</p>
<p>not alter the fact that men do so predominatingly make history,</p>
<p>that you could nearly write a complete history of the world</p>
<p>without mentioning a woman's name. And on the other hand we have</p>
<p>a gift of devotion, of inspiration, a distinctive power for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1329">truly</a></p>
<p>loving beautiful things, a care for life and a peculiar keen</p>
<p>close eye for <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1330">behaviour</a>. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1331">know</a> men are blind beside us in</p>
<p>these last matters. You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1331">know</a> they are restless-and fitful. We</p>
<p>have a steadfastness. We may never draw the broad outlines nor</p>
<p>discover the new paths, but in the future isn't there a</p>
<p>confirming and sustaining and supplying role for us? As</p>
<p>important, perhaps, as yours? Equally important. We hold the</p>
<p>world up, Karenin, though you may have raised it.'</p>
<p>'You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1332">know</a> very well, Rachel, that I believe as you believe. <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1333">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1334">am</a></p>
<p>not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1335">thinking</a> of the abolition of woman. But I do want to</p>
<p>abolish-the heroine, the sexual heroine. I want to abolish the</p>
<p>woman whose support is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1336">jealousy</a> and whose gift possession. I</p>
<p>want to abolish the woman who can be won as a prize or locked up</p>
<p>as a delicious treasure. And away down there the heroine flares</p>
<p>like a divinity.'</p>
<p>'In America,' said Edwards, 'men are fighting duels over the</p>
<p>praises of women and holding tournaments before Queens of</p>
<p>Beauty.'</p>
<p>'I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1337">saw</a> a beautiful girl in Lahore,' said Kahn, 'she sat under a</p>
<p>golden canopy like a goddess, and three fine men, armed and</p>
<p>dressed like the ancient paintings, sat on steps below her to</p>
<p>show their devotion. And they wanted only her permission to fight</p>
<p>for her.'</p>
<p>'That is the men's doing,' said Edith Haydon.</p>
<p>'I SAID,' cried Edwards, 'that man's imagination was more</p>
<p>specialised for sex than the whole <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1338">being</a> of woman. What woman</p>
<p>would do a thing like that? Women do but submit to it or take</p>
<p>advantage of it.'</p>
<p>'There is no evil between men and women that is not a common</p>
<p>evil,' said Karenin. 'It is you poets, Kahn, with your love</p>
<p>songs which turn the sweet fellowship of comrades into this</p>
<p>woman-centred excitement. But there is something in women, in</p>
<p>many women, which <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1339">responds</a> to these provocations; they succumb to</p>
<p>a peculiarly self-cultivating egotism. They become the subjects</p>
<p>of their own artistry. They develop and elaborate <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1340">themselves</a> as</p>
<p>scarcely any man would ever do. They LOOK for golden canopies.</p>
<p>And even when they seem to react against that, they may do it</p>
<p>still. I have been reading in the old papers of the movements to</p>
<p>emancipate women that were going on before the discovery of</p>
<p>atomic force. These things which began with a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1341">desire</a> to escape</p>
<p>from the limitations and servitude of sex, ended in an inflamed</p>
<p>assertion of sex, and women more heroines than ever. Helen of</p>
<p>Holloway was at last as big a nuisance in her way as Helen of</p>
<p>Troy, and so long as you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1342">think</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1343">yourselves</a> as women'-he held</p>
<p>out a finger at Rachel and smiled gently-'instead of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1344">thinking</a> of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1343">yourselves</a> as intelligent beings, you will be in danger</p>
<p>of-Helenism. To <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1342">think</a> of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1343">yourselves</a> as women is to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1342">think</a> of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1343">yourselves</a> in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1345">relation</a> to men. You can't escape that</p>
<p>consequence. You have to learn to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1342">think</a> of yourselves-for our</p>
<p>sakes and your own sakes-in <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1345">relation</a> to the sun and stars. You</p>
<p>have to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1346">cease</a> to be our adventure, Rachel, and come with us upon</p>
<p>our adventures…' He waved his hand towards the dark sky above</p>
<p>the mountain crests.</p>
<p>Section 8</p>
<p>'These questions are the next questions to which research will</p>
<p>bring us answers,' said Karenin. 'While we sit here and talk</p>
<p>idly and inexactly of what is needed and what may be, there are</p>
<p>hundreds of keen-witted men and women who are working these</p>
<p>things out, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1347">dispassionately</a> and certainly, for the love of</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1348">knowledge</a>. The next sciences to yield great harvests now will be</p>
<p>psychology and neural physiology. These perplexities of the</p>
<p>situation between man and woman and the trouble with the</p>
<p>obstinacy of egotism, these are temporary troubles, the issue of</p>
<p>our own times. Suddenly all these differences that seem so fixed</p>
<p>will dissolve, all these incompatibles will run together, and we</p>
<p>shall go on to mould our bodies and our bodily <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1349">feelings</a> and</p>
<p>personal reactions as boldly as we begin now to carve mountains</p>
<p>and set the seas in their places and change the currents of the</p>
<p>wind.'</p>
<p>'It is the next wave,' said Fowler, who had come out upon the</p>
<p>terrace and seated <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1350">himself</a> silently behind Karenin's chair.</p>
<p>'Of course, in the old days,' said Edwards, 'men were tied to</p>
<p>their city or their country, tied to the homes they owned or the</p>
<p>work they did…'</p>
<p>'I do not <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1351">see</a>,' said Karenin, 'that there is any final <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1352">limit</a> to</p>
<p>man's power of self-modification.</p>
<p>'There is none,' said Fowler, walking forward and sitting down</p>
<p>upon the parapet in front of Karenin so that he could <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1353">see</a> his</p>
<p>face. 'There is no <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1354">absolute</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1355">limit</a> to either <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1356">knowledge</a> or</p>
<p>power… I hope you do not tire <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1357">yourself</a> talking.'</p>
<p>'I am interested,' said Karenin. 'I suppose in a little while</p>
<p>men will <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1358">cease</a> to be tired. I suppose in a little time you will</p>
<p>give us something that will hurry away the fatigue products and</p>
<p>restore our jaded tissues almost at once. This old machine may</p>
<p>be made to run without slacking or <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1359">cessation</a>.'</p>
<p>'That is possible, Karenin. But there is much to learn.'</p>
<p>'And all the hours we give to digestion and half living; don't</p>
<p>you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1360">think</a> there will be some way of saving these?'</p>
<p>Fowler nodded assent.</p>
<p>'And then sleep again. When man with his blazing lights made an</p>
<p>end to night in his towns and houses-it is only a hundred years</p>
<p>or so ago that that was done-then it followed he would presently</p>
<p>resent his eight hours of uselessness. Shan't we presently take</p>
<p>a tabloid or lie in some field of force that will enable us to do</p>
<p>with an hour or so of slumber and rise refreshed again?'</p>
<p>'Frobisher and Ameer Ali have done work in that direction.'</p>
<p>'And then the inconveniences of age and those diseases of the</p>
<p>system that come with years; steadily you drive them back and you</p>
<p>lengthen and lengthen the years that stretch between the</p>
<p>passionate tumults of youth and the contractions of senility. Man</p>
<p>who used to weaken and die as his teeth decayed now looks forward</p>
<p>to a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1361">continually</a> lengthening, <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1361">continually</a> fuller term of years.</p>
<p>And all those parts of him that once gathered evil against him,</p>
<p>the vestigial structures and odd, treacherous corners of his</p>
<p>body, you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1362">know</a> better and better how to deal with. You carve his</p>
<p>body about and leave it re-modelled and unscarred. The</p>
<p>psychologists are learning how to mould <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1363">minds</a>, to reduce and</p>
<p>remove bad complexes of <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1364">thought</a> and motive, to relieve pressures</p>
<p>and broaden ideas. So that we are becoming more and more capable</p>
<p>of transmitting what we have learnt and preserving it for the</p>
<p>race. The race, the racial <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1365">wisdom</a>, science, gather power</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1361">continually</a> to subdue the individual man to its own end. Is that</p>
<p>not so?'</p>
<p>Fowler said that it was, and for a time he was telling Karenin of</p>
<p>new work that was in progress in India and Russia. 'And how is</p>
<p>it with heredity?' asked Karenin.</p>
<p>Fowler told them of the mass of inquiry accumulated and arranged</p>
<p>by the genius of Tchen, who was beginning to define clearly the</p>
<p>laws of inheritance and how the sex of children and the</p>
<p>complexions and many of the parental qualities could be</p>
<p>determined.</p>
<p>'He can actually DO--?'</p>
<p>'It is still, so to speak, a mere laboratory triumph,' said</p>
<p>Fowler, 'but to-morrow it will be practicable.'</p>
<p>'You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1366">see</a>,' cried Karenin, turning a laughing face to Rachel and</p>
<p>Edith, 'while we have been theorising about men and women, here</p>
<p>is science getting the power for us to end that old dispute for</p>
<p>ever. If woman is too much for us, we'll reduce her to a</p>
<p>minority, and if we do not like any type of men and women, we'll</p>
<p>have no more of it. These old bodies, these old animal</p>
<p>limitations, all this earthly inheritance of gross</p>
<p>inevitabilities falls from the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1367">spirit</a> of man like the shrivelled</p>
<p>cocoon from an imago. And for my own part, when I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1368">hear</a> of these</p>
<p>things I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1369">feel</a> like that-like a wet, crawling new moth that still</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1370">fears</a> to spread its wings. Because where do these things take</p>
<p>us?'</p>
<p>'Beyond humanity,' said Kahn.</p>
<p>'No,' said Karenin. 'We can still keep our feet upon the earth</p>
<p>that made us. But the air no longer imprisons us, this round</p>
<p>planet is no longer chained to us like the ball of a galley</p>
<p>slave…</p>
<p>'In a little while men who will <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1371">know</a> how to bear the strange</p>
<p>gravitations, the altered pressures, the attenuated, unfamiliar</p>
<p>gases and all the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1372">fearful</a> strangenesses of space will be</p>
<p>venturing out from this earth. This ball will be no longer enough</p>
<p>for us; our <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1373">spirit</a> will reach out… Cannot you <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1374">see</a> how that</p>
<p>little argosy will go glittering up into the sky, twinkling and</p>
<p>glittering smaller and smaller until the blue swallows it up.</p>
<p>They may succeed out there; they may perish, but other men will</p>
<p>follow them…</p>
<p>'It is as if a great window opened,' said Karenin.</p>
<p>Section 9</p>
<p>As the evening drew on Karenin and those who were about him went</p>
<p>up upon the roof of the buildings, so that they might the better</p>
<p>watch the sunset and the flushing of the mountains and the coming</p>
<p>of the afterglow. They were joined by two of the surgeons from</p>
<p>the laboratories below, and presently by a nurse who brought</p>
<p>Karenin refreshment in a thin glass cup. It was a cloudless,</p>
<p>windless evening under the deep blue sky, and far away to the</p>
<p>north glittered two biplanes on the way to the observatories on</p>
<p>Everest, two hundred miles distant over the precipices to the</p>
<p>east. The little group of people watched them pass over the</p>
<p>mountains and vanish into the blue, and then for a time they</p>
<p>talked of the work that the observatory was doing. From that they</p>
<p>passed to the whole process of research about the world, and so</p>
<p>Karenin's <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1375">thoughts</a> returned again to the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1376">mind</a> of the world and</p>
<p>the great future that was opening upon man's imagination. He</p>
<p>asked the surgeons many questions upon the detailed possibilities</p>
<p>of their science, and he was keenly interested and excited by the</p>
<p>things they told him. And as they talked the sun <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1377">touched</a> the</p>
<p>mountains, and became very swiftly a blazing and indented</p>
<p>hemisphere of liquid flame and sank.</p>
<p>Karenin looked blinking at the last quivering rim of</p>
<p>incandescence, and shaded his eyes and became silent.</p>
<p>Presently he gave a little start.</p>
<p>'What?' asked Rachel Borken.</p>
<p>'I had forgotten,' he said.</p>
<p>'What had you forgotten?'</p>
<p>'I had forgotten about the operation to-morrow. I have been so</p>
<p>interested as Man to-day that I have nearly forgotten Marcus</p>
<p>Karenin. Marcus Karenin must go under your knife to-morrow,</p>
<p>Fowler, and very probably Marcus Karenin will die.' He raised</p>
<p>his slightly shrivelled hand. 'It does not matter, Fowler. It</p>
<p>scarcely matters even to me. For indeed is it Karenin who has</p>
<p>been sitting here and talking; is it not rather a common <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1378">mind</a>,</p>
<p>Fowler, that has played about between us? You and I and all of</p>
<p>us have added <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1379">thought</a> to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1379">thought</a>, but the thread is neither you</p>
<p>nor me. What is <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1380">true</a> we all have; when the individual has</p>
<p>altogether brought <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1381">himself</a> to the test and winnowing of</p>
<p>expression, then the individual is done. I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1382">feel</a> as though I had</p>
<p>already been emptied out of that little vessel, that Marcus</p>
<p>Karenin, which in my youth held me so tightly and completely.</p>
<p>Your beauty, dear Edith, and your broad brow, dear Rachel, and</p>
<p>you, Fowler, with your firm and skilful hands, are now almost as</p>
<p>much to me as this hand that beats the arm of my chair. And as</p>
<p>little me. And the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1383">spirit</a> that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1384">desires</a> to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1385">know</a>, the <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1383">spirit</a> that</p>
<p>resolves to do, that <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1383">spirit</a> that lives and has talked in us</p>
<p>to-day, lived in Athens, lived in Florence, lives on, I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1385">know</a>, for</p>
<p>ever…</p>
<p>'And you, old Sun, with your sword of flame searing these poor</p>
<p>eyes of Marcus for the last time of all, beware of me! You <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1386">think</a></p>
<p>I die-and indeed <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1387">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1388">am</a> only taking off one more coat to get at</p>
<p>you. I have threatened you for ten thousand years, and soon I</p>
<p>warn you I shall be coming. When <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1387">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1388">am</a> altogether stripped and my</p>
<p>disguises thrown away. Very soon now, old Sun, I shall launch</p>
<p><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1389">myself</a> at you, and I shall reach you and I shall put my foot on</p>
<p>your spotted face and tug you about by your fiery locks. One step</p>
<p>I shall take to the moon, and then I shall leap at you. I've</p>
<p>talked to you before, old Sun, I've talked to you a million</p>
<p>times, and now <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1387">I</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1388">am</a> beginning to <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1390">remember</a>. Yes-long ago, long</p>
<p>ago, before I had stripped off a few thousand generations, dust</p>
<p>now and forgotten, I was a hairy savage and I pointed my hand at</p>
<p>you and-clearly I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1390">remember</a> it!-I <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1391">saw</a> you in a net. Have you</p>
<p>forgotten that, old Sun?…</p>
<p>'Old Sun, I gather <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1392">myself</a> together out of the pools of the</p>
<p>individual that have held me dispersed so long. I gather my</p>
<p>billion <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1393">thoughts</a> into science and my million wills into a common</p>
<p>purpose. Well may you slink down behind the mountains from me,</p>
<p>well may you cower…'</p>
<p>Section 10</p>
<p>Karenin <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1394">desired</a> that he might <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1395">dream</a><a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1396">alone</a> for a little while</p>
<p>before he returned to the cell in which he was to sleep. He was</p>
<p>given relief for a <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1397">pain</a> that began to trouble him and wrapped</p>
<p>warmly about with furs, for a great coldness was creeping over</p>
<p>all things, and so they left him, and he sat for a long time</p>
<p>watching the afterglow give place to the darkness of night.</p>
<p>It seemed to those who had to watch over him unobtrusively lest</p>
<p>he should be in want of any attention, that he mused very deeply.</p>
<p>The white and purple peaks against the golden sky sank down into</p>
<p>cold, blue remoteness, glowed out again and faded again, and the</p>
<p>burning cressets of the Indian stars, that even the moonrise</p>
<p>cannot altogether quench, began their vigil. The moon rose</p>
<p>behind the towering screen of dark precipices to the east, and</p>
<p>long before it emerged above these, its slanting beams had filled</p>
<p>the deep gorges below with luminous mist and turned the towers</p>
<p>and pinnacles of Lio Porgyul to a magic dreamcastle of radiance</p>
<p>and wonder…</p>
<p>Came a great uprush of ghostly light above the black rim of</p>
<p>rocks, and then like a bubble that is blown and <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1398">detaches</a> itself</p>
<p>the moon floated off clear into the unfathomable dark sky…</p>
<p>And then Karenin stood up. He walked a few paces along the</p>
<p>terrace and remained for a time gazing up at that great silver</p>
<p>disc, that silvery shield that must needs be man's first conquest</p>
<p>in outer space…</p>
<p>Presently he turned about and stood with his hands folded behind</p>
<p>him, looking at the northward stars…</p>
<p>At length he went to his own cell. He lay down there and slept</p>
<p>peacefully till the morning. And early in the morning they came</p>
<p>to him and the anaesthetic was given him and the operation</p>
<p>performed.</p>
<p>It was altogether successful, but Karenin was weak and he had to</p>
<p>lie very still; and about seven days later a blood clot <a xlink:href="#RemLinkWeb_1399">detached</a></p>
<p>itself from the healing scar and travelled to his heart, and he</p>
<p>died in an instant in the night.</p>
