<p>A Few Words From the Author</p>
</title>
<empty-line/>
<p>THIS IS THE THIRD AND FINAL BOOK IN THE NEW WELL WORLD project. The Watchers atthe Well, which began with Echoes of the Well of Souls and continued in Shadowof the Well of Souls. It completes the massive novel.</p>
<p>If you've just come across this and haven't read the other two, you shouldimmediately look for them where you found this copy. Any reputable, responsible,intelligently run bookstore should have the previous two so that anyonehappening on the third one by chance doesn't have to hunt for them just to readthe entire work. If they don't, tell them what they aren't and find a betterbookstore!</p>
<p>There are also five original Well World books. You don't need them in order toread Watchers, but it would be a good idea to start at the beginning. The firstwas Midnight at the Well of Souls, followed by (in order) Exiles of the Well ofSouls, Quest for the Well of Souls, The Return of Nathan Brazil, and Twilight atthe Well of Souls. All are still available from Del Rey Books, and don't let anybook dealer tell you differently!</p>
<p>The Well saga now spans sixteen years, although with a twelve-year break. Willthere be any more? None are intended, but I didn't intend to write this one,either, and I'm quite pleased with it.</p>
<p>Those of you who have been waiting, I've planted some good action, added a lotof nasty plot twists (but you were ahead of me on those already, right?), andtied up all the loose ends in nice, neat knots. You may not like all the thingsI do (I am expecting some adverse reaction to the very last one), but they are,I assure you, carefully and logically thought out. And if, along the way ofentertaining you, I've raised a few points and made you think a little, well,that's fine, too.</p>
<p>And now (drum roll, curtain up) here's the way it works out… </p>

<p>Between Galaxies, Heading Toward Andromeda</p>
</title>

<p>The Kraang had been wondering much the same thing. The limitations placed on itstill prevented it from direct contact with beings on the Well World unless,thanks to the happy accident that allowed it net access, someone was in thetransitional stage, totally energy within the net in midtransmission. Otherwiseit was strictly read only, and that was proving less amusing now thanfrustrating.</p>
<p>Monitoring the lives and thoughts of these beings had reawakened in the Kraang afeeling it had thought long dead, a taste of what it was to be alive again. Itwanted that now more than anything; the lust for it was cracking its heretoforeabsolute self-control, bringing back longings that it had believed it had longoutgrown.</p>
<p>The Well perceived no threat to itself or its master program; it only desiredthat what it considered an anomaly- the relinking, however tenuous, of theKraang to the net-be rectified. A simple matter, really, for anyone capable ofplugging into the net; not even seconds to find, comprehend, and repair, cuttingthe Kraang off once more from the system. Brazil was the threat-he'd been theremany times, been changed into the master form, and would hardly even think twiceabout it. He'd do whatever the damned Well said and be done with it, and hewould understand the threat sufficiently to be impervious to the Kraang'sentreaties and offers. There was nothing Brazil really wanted except, perhaps,oblivion, and the Kraang wasn't so certain that the captain would really take itif it were offered in any event. Brazil was so damned… responsible. Dutyabove all.</p>
<p>No, if the Kraang were to effect a return, it would be Mavra Chang. Human,inexperienced, self-involved, and unencumbered by any sense of duty or mission.Mavra Chang would listen before she acted and believe what she wanted tobelieve. She was certainly tough, no pushover, but she was far too-human-toblindly obey the dictates of an ancient race she neither knew nor understood.According to the data, she'd been close to being a goddess before, going fromworld to world, taking many forms, playing both explorer and missionary to themisbegotten.</p>
<p>The Kraang could deal very comfortably with an activist.</p>
<p>Brazil was at the moment romping in mindless joy with that silly girl on thatspeck of land in the ocean, but the Well would never leave him there. If MavraChang's progress to the Well had been stopped, then Brazil would again get thenomination and be forced to accept. The longer there was no movement orprobability of movement by Chang, who was by far closer to the Well gate thanBrazil, the more likely the Well would be forced to make the switch. The otherswould never find her, and it would be all the worse if they somehow did trackdown Campos but never recognized Chang in her current form.</p>
<p>Campos was the key. Such a limited mind! Not stupid, not by the likes of theraces there, but sadly warped. Campos was so enjoying her revenge and wascomfortable enough in an environment not all that different from the one back onthe home planet that had bred and shaped her, that she was in danger of losingsight of the ultimate game. The Kraang had not counted on her adjusting, though,and that was the real problem. Since Campos had been a male from a backgroundthat had little value for women, the Kraang had been certain that she would bedriven to the Well to reclaim her manhood.</p>
<p>It wasn't happening.</p>
<p>If Campos had gotten hold of Mavra Chang earlier, it would have, but the Wellhad its own ways of subtly adjusting a subject to a form. The brain chemistry,the hormonal balances, and being completely immersed in a new culture eventuallytook hold. A transformation that seemed horrible when first discovered began toseem normal; prior life and existence were distanced in the mind as it adjusted,becoming more and more remote. If one were to go mad from the process, it tendedto happen rather quickly; otherwise that barrier the mind erected becameprogressively insubstantial until it either shattered, as in the case of Loriand Julian, or, as in Campos's case, just slowly evaporated to nothingness. Without even realizing it, or perhaps admitting it to herself, Juan Campos nolonger thought it odd. or even wrong, to be female, let alone a Cloptan female.She had managed in a relatively short time to gain a fair amount of power andinfluence, in part because she was attractive to male Cloptans who already hadthat power and influence, and she was actually enjoying it. Experience counted.The Well might have played a joke on Campos by making her female, but it also had dropped her into a totally familiar milieu. Being the tough girlfriend of adrug lord wasn't much different from being the son of one. and the knowledge andruthlessness actually made her a valuable asset to the organization. After thatfirst month she hadn't even experienced much of the fear and insecurity thatbeing a woman in such a society inevitably produced; everybody dangerous knewhow suicidal it would be to mess with the boss's girl and how vicious that girlcould be if she perceived one as a threat.</p>
<p>Not that Campos didn't want to get at all the power the Well represented; it wasjust that she was smart enough to know that before she let Mavra Chang near theWell, her control had to be ironclad. And until Juan Campos figured out how todo that or was forced by circumstance to gamble, she'd keep things pretty muchthe way they were.</p>
<p>It was frustrating to the Kraang. If only Campos would go through a Zone Gate.Then some contact, some influence, could be attempted. But Campos wanted no partof those Gates if she could avoid them. She remained where she could ensureprotection.</p>
<p>Somehow there just had to be a way to kick Campos in the ass. There just had tobe!</p>
<p>But until and unless it found a way to make contact, the Kraang knew it had todepend on forces beyond its control. The psychotic former Julian Beard-nowturned into a complaisant wife for that female astronomer turned male swordsmanwho was now gelded and trapped as a courier for the Cloptan drug ring-wasshowing some promise, after all. Aided by the Dillians, who were somewhat in thepay of the Zone Council, she might well disrupt things sufficiently to cause amajor move. When one no longer cared if one lived or died unless one attainedone's objective, it made for a spicy and dangerous time for all those in one'sway. The threat there was the Dillians. If they did come upon Mavra Chang bysome miracle, helpless though she was, would the Dillians' first loyalty be totheir former Earth comrades or to their new leaders and lives? Unknown to any ofthem, forces were moving in on the region and the situation was getting very,very dicey as the council and the various hexes weighed their own options. Ifthey captured Chang, no matter what her form, while the surprisingly resourcefulGus liberated Brazil, everything could go wrong. Of course, there was always thecolonel…</p>
<p>Possibilities! Far too many! This was getting much more difficult than theKraang had originally thought. And there were far too many ways for things to gowrong…</p>
<p>Buckgrud, Capital of Clopta</p>
<p>lately, IT was always pretty much the same dream. A dense, living forest filledwith strange, twisting plants shimmered in a nearly constant but gentle breeze.Not familiar in any waking sense, yet familiar somehow to her in her dream.Comforting, safe, secure.</p>
<p>She would awaken into this living darkness in the Nesting Place, along with manyothers of her kind, and then proceed out from the hollow tree and onto theforest floor. Most of the night would be spent in the hunt, sometimes searchingout and sometimes lying in wait as still as one of the bushes that were allaround, waiting for prey to venture forth. Tiny animals, large insects, itdidn't matter, so long as it was alive and small enough to be swallowed whole.There was always plenty of prey, for they bred all the time, or so it seemed,but much needed to be eaten to satisfy, and it was a task that consumed much ofthe night. There was no particular fear on her own part, though; there were nonatural enemies in this forest for such as they, and the Big Ones who livedamong the treetops ate no flesh and seemed appreciative of the service she andher kind did in keeping the crawling things in check so that they could notbecome so numerous as to threaten survival. She knew each by the scent and bythe sounds it made.</p>
<p>The scent from a small mound nearby told her that there were delicacies inside;she moved to it, and her powerful claws dug into it, and she bent down so thather long, sticky tongue could go inside and sift through and find and draw thelittle Insects Into her beak…</p>
<p>It was near dusk when Mavra Chang awoke. She slept more than she was awake now,it was true, but that was blessed relief in more than one way. It not only meantescape from the sadism and torments of Juan Campos, when, of course, the Cloptanwas awake and not busy with other things, it also was relief from the strangeand unpleasant sensations that seemed unending.</p>
<p>There were feverish flushes, dizziness, unexpected pains of varying degrees invarious places, and, above all else, a nearly universal itch that was drivingher crazier than Campos ever could.</p>
<p>At first she thought that the sadistic surgeons employed by the drug cartel hadbeen butchers as well, but over the passing weeks she had come to realize thatit wasn't that, either. Something-strange-was happening to her, something evensomeone with her vast life and long experience in what evil could do had neverundergone before. Still, that life allowed her to understand to a degree whatwas happening, if not exactly why.</p>
<p>She had been surgically altered, mutilated, disguised, but that was only thestart of it. She had become other creatures before, but always the way the Welldid it: quickly, without pain or sensation. She was becoming another creatureagain for the first time since she had last been on this world, but by adifferent method, and slowly by the standards of the Well but with astonishingspeed by any other means.</p>
<p>She knew that now for several reasons, not the least of which was that what thesurgeons had removed, such as her arms, had not even begun to grow back. Sherecalled that sensation well. Her body was changing. Grafted feathers were beingreplaced by real ones just as colorful and even more dense. Her center ofgravity had moved down, and her midsection had thickened, while her head seemedto be enlarged and set flush on the shoulders, but with a neck that could pivotthe head amazingly far. All this had been at the cost of an already shortenedheight; she was now a bit under a meter tall, but somehow she knew she wouldgrow no shorter.</p>
<p>Her backbone had become increasingly limber, to the point where she could bendbackward and almost touch the floor with the top of her head while stillstanding or lean forward so effortlessly and with such good balance that shecould touch the floor with her beak.</p>
<p>From that vantage point she could see that her stubby, mutilated legs wererapidly changing into huge, thick drumsticks; the rather stupid feet they hadfashioned for her now were solid, enlarged, and black and were gaining almostthe prehensility of long, thick fingers, with sharp needlelike nails developingat the tips. Even the large, curved beak they had fashioned over her mouth wasno longer the crude but effective graft; her tongue, now thin and greatlyelongated, told her that beyond the beak was the gullet. Bright light blindedher, and even normal daylight was pale, washed out, and difficult to see in, yetthe darkness glowed with sharpness and detail. Through the beak, countlessstrange odors came to her, each somehow separate even when mixed, and it was abit of a game to try and identify and classify them. It was something to do. The same went for sounds, although she could understand nothing of speech. Shecould understand only Campos, and then only when Campos directed somethingspecifically at her; only Campos's translator could accept the eerie clicks andmoans, some from deep in Mavra's chest, that passed for her speech. That littlegift of a dedicated translator remained, but she was glad of it somehow in spiteof her hatred of Campos. She knew that the sounds she could make were reallybird sounds, animal sounds, not any sort of intelligible language to any race. The animal urges disturbed her more. She could no longer physically tolerate anyvegetable matter. Campos had been feeding her raw, bloody meat strips, it beinga bit too civilized in the city to go pick up a carton of worms or grubs, evenif Campos would have entertained the idea of live creepy crawlies in her niceapartment. Although Cloptans resembled giant humanoid ducks, they were omnivoresand even had tiny rows of teeth inside those remarkably elastic, oversized billsof theirs.</p>
<p>Campos had hardly failed to notice the metamorphosis: it was happening at a ratethat could not be seen by the naked eye but fast enough that something new wouldbe evident between the time she left in early evening and the time she returnedto sleep.</p>
<p>Now she came in the door and turned on the light, washing out Mavra's vision.The door slammed, and the Cloptan kicked off her shoes and threw a purse on thechair.</p>
<p>Campos looked over at the corner where Mavra stood, held there by a strong chainfastened to an anklet and to a welded-on socket in the wall, allowing perhaps ameter's movement one way or the other.</p>
<p>"Ah, my pet! And how are you this evening?"</p>
<p>"Food, master! Please! Food! Birdy begs you!" The worst part was, she no longereven felt humiliated by begging. It said something about Campos's mind-set,though, that she had insisted on being called "master," not "mistress." "In a minute, my sweet. I need to freshen up and get a drink. It is going to bea long evening, I fear."</p>
<p>"Please, master! Feed Birdy!"</p>
<p>"Shut up! No more, you miserable little shit or I might just forget to feed youat all!"</p>
<p>It was not a threat to be taken lightly. The craving for food after sunset wasoverwhelming, more even than the craving for the exotic Well World drug thatMavra's made-over body no longer needed or even noticed. Mavra had not, however,volunteered that fact.</p>
<p>Campos went into the bathroom, and after an agonizing wait there was the soundof a toilet flush and then water running. Finally the Cloptan emerged, nownaked.</p>
<p>Although it was nothing unusual now, the first sight Mavra had had of Camposnaked had been something of an odd feeling. The shape was very human to a point,but even the breasts were covered with countless tiny white feathers except atthe very tips. The shoulders were unnaturally squared off, it seemed, the armsand thinly webbed hands oversized for the body. The neck was quite long and thinto be supporting that oversized head. Below the waist it became more birdlike,with a definite rounding, almost turnip-shaped, with the turnip top angled backand slightly up, becoming short but large tail feathers. The legs extendedstraight down, a golden yellow color, and ended in two wide, thickly webbed feetthat could still be consciously rolled up and fit into shoes.</p>
<p>She shared the huge apartment with two Cloptan females who were apparentlyattached to other drug cartel kingpins, but they stayed away from the big bird'sarea and Campos rarely referred to them or appeared to interact much with them.They ignored their roommate's "pet" and gave it a wide berth and seemedotherwise to be fairly typical of their type.</p>
<p>There had been more than a few naked males in as well. If they wererepresentative of the race, they tended to be larger, chunkier, with almostwrestler builds, bent a bit forward on the hips in a slightly more birdlikefashion but without much in the way of tail feathers at all. Male genitaliaweren't visible at all; they were apparently hidden by a thick clump of feathersgrowing forward between the widely spaced legs, which explained why they allseemed to be bowlegged.</p>
<p>Campos went to the cold storage compartment and took out a box of something,then popped it in a fast defroster that might have been operated by microwavesor some other means.</p>
<p>"Ah! I should tell you that I got word today from those nice doctors who madeyou so very pretty for me." the Cloptan said as the defroster whirred in thebackground. "They said you were genetically reprogrammed using the actualgenetic code of a real bird in a hex very, very far away. I forget the name, butwhat does it matter? They said not to worry, that you would still be able tothink and remember but that you'd also have all of the bird's instincts. Theyeven said that by three months or so you would be so physically like this birdthat you would even be fertile!" She laughed. "Just think! The zoo here doesn'thave any of your birdie kind, but you're on their wish list, and the other girlshere still seem a bit frightened of you and keep trying to talk me into gettingrid of you."</p>
<p>Mavra said nothing. Anything she could say would only cause trouble. "Just think of it!" Campos went on, enjoying herself. "The nice zoo people saythat if they had you, they could secure at least the loan of a male of thespecies. That might be quite the answer here. I won't have to worry about yourcare or suffer your presence here, but you'll be secure and in a happy littlenest I can visit any time. That would be very amusing, seeing you sitting therehatching eggs, knowing that all your children would be birdbrains. Would youlike that?"</p>
<p>"Whatever master wishes Birdy will do," Mavra responded as if by rote, eyes onthe defroster. "You bet your sparkly feathered ass you will!" It was far fromhopeless, but how the hell she would get this stupid asshole to head for theWell was something Mavra Chang was far from figuring out yet. The zoo wasn't avery appetizing new destination, but maybe it would provide some way out. Zoosdidn't usually plan on animals being as smart as humans.</p>
<p>Somehow, some way, she had to get to the Well. She was building up too long alist of people to get even with to fail.</p>

<p>Subar, a City in Northern Agon</p>
</title>
<empty-line/>
<p>IT WAS A REGION OF THICK FORESTS AND ROLLING HILLS, WITH mild days and chillynights; if it hadn't smelled something like an overcooked egg, it might havebeen very pleasant.</p>
<p>Agon was a high-tech hex with just about everything one could expect of modernlife. Private cars were banned; there just wasn't enough room to tolerate themor anywhere to dump the old ones. Still, public transport of just about everykind was available for a very low fee, along with taxis and buses that seemed toglide on air working not only every city and town but every rail and roadcrossing as well.</p>
<p>The Agonese were a strange lot, looking to Anne Marie like something out of achildren's fairy tale. In fact, they resembled nothing so much as squat turtleswithout shells, but with very tough greenish-gray hides that might have been athome on elephants or rhinos back on Earth. But unlike those animals they werebipeds, walking on two short, thick trunks of legs that terminated in wildlyoversized feet out of the age of dinosaurs. The omnipresent if unpleasant odorwas nothing less than their collective body odors, to which they of course wereoblivious.</p>
<p>"We are strangers very far even from our native Well World homes," Anne Marienoted as they approached a medium-sized city, the first they'd seen since makingtheir way south from Liliblod. "We have no choice. We must contact theauthorities and ask for help."</p>
<p>Tony, reluctantly along on this new quest and not liking it a bit, sighed. "Youare correct, of course. But it makes me uneasy to do so. Such an operation couldnot go on in this kind of setting and with this technology without someconnivance from high local officials. We are far from the places where the foulstuff is grown and into where it is distributed. This close to the business end,the government official who comes to help us might well be in the pay of thosewe seek. I would feel more at ease if we could contact our own government. They,after all, sent us on this great expedition in the first place. If we vanishoutside their knowledge and contact, then we vanish forever."</p>
<p>Anne Marie nodded. "Agreed. But there must be a way of getting a message to ourpeople in-what is that place called?-Zone? Where the embassies are. They havetelephones, radios, probably much more, here. I think our best course is not tomention any more than we have to at the outset about why we're here and simplyask as stranded travelers to call our embassy. That would be a reasonable andnatural request, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p>Tony nodded. "We have to do it that way, but something makes me uneasy about it.I still do not feel very clean about our role in this so far, even though we hadnothing to do with the current problem. And I was born and raised in a verydifferent society than you. I feel, unfortunately, far more at home with the governments here than I ever did with the British government I very much prefer."</p>
<p>There were a great many stares as the two large, blond, twin centauresses cameinto the city, one with an equally exotic if very different creature on herbroad equine back. Alowi, the former Julian Beard, had said virtually nothingand seemed almost disinterested in the city or its inhabitants or anything else.Without a translator, she was merely along for the ride in most of the alienenvironments. That, both Tony and Marie agreed, would be a top priority. TheErdomese would get a translator or give up any thoughts of tracking down herkidnapped husband. There was no alternative. This was certainly a hex with thetechnical abilities to install one, although it would take more money than anyof them had.</p>
<p>In fact, money was going to be the first problem if they remained here in thenorth. They hadn't been allowed to take much more than basic packs andprovisions when they'd been forced off the ship off the coast of Liliblod, andMavra had been the dispenser of funds for the group.</p>
<p>They didn't need much to just survive; although all three preferred nicelyprepared and cooked dishes, their constitutions were such that they couldsurvive on grasses and leaves if need be. As for clothing, the Dillians inparticular could gallop forty or fifty kilometers a day without even sweatinghard, and they at least had been allowed to keep their coats for use in colderclimates. Still, they were well aware that they were very far away from anythingor anyone familiar, and while they could use the Well Gate in any capital city,it would take them only to their home hexes, not to anywhere they wanted to be. "Not much hope of finding any work around here, either," Tony noted. "Everythingthat we could do is automated. If the council won't stake us, we're through." "Yes, I keep worrying that they will thank us for our service and tell us to gohome, that they are sending the professionals in," Anne Marie responded. "Still,their professionals haven't been any good up to now, have they?'' Aside from a small Liliblodian consulate, there was nothing in the way ofgovernment offices in this fairly remote city, or much need for it, when cheap,fast magnetic trains could take anyone to the centrally located capital in underan hour and a half. While that also implied that the local cops could havesomebody who had some authority there in a matter of hours, it didn't prove tobe that easy. In fact, it almost seemed as if nobody were interested in doinganything for them except telling them how to get home and suggesting that theydo so at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>Unable to get any information on anything else, let alone help, they held aconference to decide just what to do.</p>
<p>"You should both go home through the big gate," Alowi told them. "It will takeyou home, I know, in very quick time, as they say."</p>
<p>"But dear! What will you do?" Anne Marie asked, worried.</p>
<p>"I will do what I must. I will never return to Erdom. Never. With no husband orfamily, I have no wants or needs. So far I have been able to eat the grasses,leaves, berries, fruits, and such that grow in these lands. I cannot starve. Mybody seems most adaptable. I have become accustomed to the chill nights here tothe point where the coat is now uncomfortable, so I need no clothing. I willsearch as I can; if I find him, that is fine, and if I do not, nothing is lost." "But you cannot even speak to people! You have no translator!" Tony pointed out. "You do, and I do not see that it has helped you much. In truth, I do not expectto find him. I expect to wander this world, or as much of it as can be wanderedthrough, taking little from it and seeing what is seeable. Sooner or later I will find a place for myself or I will die. Either way, it is the most I canexpect."</p>
<p>"But you're talking about living like an animal! Anne Marie exclaimed. "You arebetter than that! Not to mention the fact that by your own admission you aredefenseless against the horrid beings that are a part of this world. It is adeath sentence either way."</p>
<p>"I will never go back to Erdom," she repeated, "but I will die an Erdomese.Those are facts. I choose my own course. It is more than any Erdomese woman hasbeen able to do before."</p>
<p>Anne Marie sighed. "Then we shall simply have to contact our embassy in Zone andtell them the situation and location. Then we will find some part of this landthat has some decent pasture and a few trees and wait them out." "Or wait until they throw us out," Tony noted.</p>
<p>"Then we will leave, but only far enough to find some hospitality elsewhere,"Anne Marie proclaimed. "I positively refuse to abandon this poor child to thewolves!"</p>
<p>Tony sighed. "Don't overdramatize, Anne Marie. There are no wolves in a placelike this except perhaps the foul creatures who run the place. But we must alsobe practical. If we remain, we need to find some sort of work, and this is ahigh-tech hex surrounded by others that are not."</p>
<p>"But the closest ones are water!"</p>
<p>"True, but what of that? If a ship cannot come in to high-tech, then there is atleast some point where it must be handled by the old means. Compared to one ofour men we are not very strong, but the closest of our men is probably half aworld away. In these parts we are probably quite strong, and even if we cannotlift what is required, we can certainly pull great weights."</p>
<p>"And Alowi?"</p>
<p>Tony shrugged. "She can cook. And supervise if need be. If we must remain inthis godforsaken country, let's try and make the best of it."</p>
<p>This time it was Anne Marie who was doubtful. "But for how long?" Tony shrugged. "Until one or more of us goes crazy or gets fed up or somethingbreaks. It is better than this. Who knows? The council might at least extend ussome seed money. It was they, after all, who got us into this." "Oh, Tony! You're such a dear! You're making me feel guilty about dragging youalong on this!"</p>
<p>"I have never been dragged," Tony responded. "I followed of my own free will,and I stay for the same reason. And when all hope is gone, then I will go homethe same way!"</p>
<p>Anne Marie squeezed Tony's hand and then kissed her. "Of course you will, dear!"</p>
<p>If there had been no hope, they would have headed home long before this, but theproblem was, as Anne Marie put it, they had been placed on hold but no one hadhung up on them. Anne Marie noted that in spite of many areas where the WellWorld seemed futuristic to the point of being magical, the lack of any way tofly or even send signals any great distance between the worldlets led toeverything more or less moving at, at best, a nineteenth-century pace. Nobodywas ever in a hurry here, it seemed, unless it was to do evil, and so long asthey were no threat, even evil seemed willing to leave them alone. The council, still divided over exactly what course to take and thus taking verylittle, or so it seemed, asked them in fact to stay on "in the Agon region."They advanced the Dillians some credit and even found the pair a job of sorts,although not quite what they had in mind. Hexes in the region produced a varietyof products that were of great interest to Dillia, but it had never beenpractical to manage much trade with nations so far away without some sort ofpermanent trade office coordinating things locally. Dillia was half a worlddistant-almost five thousand kilometers away over a vast stretch of water goingwest from the Ocean of Shadows and across the entire Overdark. Deals could bemade in Zone in the traditional way, but without somebody on site, there was noway to guarantee quality, compare prices and deals, and put everything together.Dillians had never been the sort to relish staying long periods of time inremote and alien lands, and so they'd pretty much had to accept the traditional"take it or leave it" deals from their nearer neighbors. Merely the threat ofcompetition could only help, and here were two who wanted to remain, at leastfor a significant period of time.</p>
<p>Dillia itself was something of a hotbed of semitech innovation, conservationplans and concepts, and agricultural management, particularly forestry, and hadmuch to trade in areas most nations largely ignored. In exchange, it neededsteam vessels, particularly for internal lakes and rivers, and other heavyindustrial items either impossible or impractical to make at home. Dillians alsohad a taste for things that could not be grown locally, including many tropicaland subtropical products, coffee, tea, cocoa, and tobacco. The Dilliangovernment was more than happy to set Tony and Anne Marie up as a trade officeand see what they could do.</p>
<p>Neither of them was under any illusions that this was a permanent job or thatthe opportunity wasn't created because, for reasons of its own, the Zone Councilsaw some value in keeping them in the region at that time, but as it servedeveryone's purposes, there were no objections.</p>
<p>Alowi was not so fortunate. She was nothing to Dillia, of course, and even lessto Erdom, who clearly was disinterested even in whether or not one more femalecame back at all. Nor did the council as a whole see any use for her. So shebecame basically the Dillians' housekeeper, keeping their new home clean,cooking the meals, and doing other chores, all of which was made much easier bybeing in a high-tech hex where things not only worked smoothly, they seemed insome ways futuristic compared to Earth.</p>
<p>Because she had no translator, Alowi spent the time studying and learningAgonese, a language that sounded bizarre but that, she soon discovered, followeda pattern not too different from some Earth tongues. It was soon clear thatJulian Beard was not dead inside her brain but merely dormant; it was in factBeard's knowledge of Japanese that gave her the clue to understanding Agonese.Not that they resembled each other in obvious ways, but the structure wasn't allthat different.</p>
<p>The trade mission had some initial frustration but then some startlingsuccesses. Tony was adept at business, and Anne Marie seemed able to spot a conor a sucker deal almost instantly and knew just when to give in on anegotiation. The initial commissions weren't huge, but they no longer had toworry about going broke.</p>
<p>They used some of the first money to buy Alowi a translator. She made noobjections this time, spending much of her time doing a great deal of studying,using the Agonese computer libraries. Their written language was actually prettybasic; for a high-tech society, it appeared that they were surprisinglyilliterate and used voice and picture technology for all their informationsources. Her greatest frustration lay in her inability to really use her hands;the oversized split hooves proved unable to push even a few small buttons on aconsole, but she managed by gripping a wooden stick and using that instead. There was an ancient language of commerce on the Well World that had evolved tocover just about every conceivable situation. It was a written languageonly-translators filled the gap for spoken tongues-and it had arisen from apictorgraphic alphabet so ancient, nobody now knew its origins. It was extremelycomplex-it had to be to cover so many tiny worldlets and so many varyingraces-but it was used on virtually all interspecies documents and everythingfrom contracts to treaties. If one could learn it, there was nothing reallyclosed to that person. To Tony, its sheer complexity made Mandarin Chinese, withits mere thirty thousand or so characters, seem like child's play, and he barelytried before giving up. Anne Marie didn't try at all, noting that the Englishhad never had to learn other people's languages and she did not intend to start.Alowi, however, managed to read many basic texts at the end of only threemonths.</p>
<p>It had been learning Agonese that had been the key. With both Agonese and Erdomato go by, she was able to isolate and assemble key concepts from the two totallydifferent languages and see how the trade language accommodated the concepts ofboth. It still wasn't easy, but it seemed, well, obvious to her, and it hadalready become merely a matter of memorizing vocabulary.</p>
<p>Tony in particular was impressed. While still back on Earth she'd consideredherself something of a linguist, which was useful for an international airlinepilot. In addition to her native Portuguese and essential English for aviation,she knew Spanish, French, and German well enough to converse and read anewspaper. This, however-this was Sanskrit as written by a mad chicken that hadgone amok in an ink factory.</p>
<p>"You can really read this?"</p>
<p>Alowi shrugged modestly. "Enough. What I do not know, I can usually interpolate.I think that if I were writing books or treaties, I would need several moreyears, and about a third that applies to specific races and hexes that I cannotimagine would require some context for me to understand, such as going there andtalking with them. But yes, I can make do in it. I will never write it, though.With these hands I can stir, chop, pick up, do quite a number of things, butonly those things which can be done with broad motion and much toleration forerror. To make these fine marks with pen or brush, where slight deviationschange whole meanings-no. Even doing block English letters is crude, much like achild just beginning to learn them."</p>
<p>"Then why go through all this?"</p>
<p>"Because the one thing that works as well as before, perhaps better, is mybrain. It is odd-I seem to be able to concentrate as I never could before, tograsp and memorize things easily that before would have been much moredifficult. I have always been a good learner, but I do not know why it issuddenly much easier. What is not so easy is chemistry."</p>
<p>What?"</p>
<p>"This body was built for sensation. It demands things, and the cravings canbecome overpowering at times. I have compensated with creativity and with someunconventional use of objects I have picked up in stores here, but it is not thesame as the real thing, and the only place I can get what I truly need wouldalso almost certainly give me a lobotomy. Erdomese just are not built to beloners. I know that now. I have been kidding myself all along. So I cannot goback, but if I do not go back, I will go mad."</p>
<p>Tony sighed. "So what are you going to do? We're here mainly because of you andbecause we hope to find out what the hell happened to the others, but time isdragging on and on. The council is only certain that nobody has yet entered theWell. There are certain places at the equatorial barrier, called Avenues, whereanyone who knows how- and only two people on this world do-can get in, and thoseare all carefully monitored. It is almost as if one of those hex gates openedand swallowed the two of them."</p>
<p>Alowi nodded. "I know. I truthfully have expected to hear the worst, but I neverexpected to go this long and hear nothing. That makes it all the harder." Shepaused a moment. "Do you remember the clinic here that had some doctors of otherraces as well as Agonese? Where I got the translator?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it mostly serves the ships' crews and passengers and other travelerspassing through. There are stories that the doctors are here because they cannotgo home, that they are wanted for some sort of criminal activities. Certainlythey can't support all this high-tech equipment off what they're paid to fixbroken legs and such every once in a while. I did not like the feel of the placewhen we took you there. Why?"</p>
<p>"The locals tell tall stories about them. About how they do terrible experimentsand create horrors, but they are protected because they leave the Agonese alone.It is also said they are of use sometimes to the government and perhaps tocriminal gangs. I do not like them one bit, but I have been thinking of going tothem. Only faint hope that perhaps my Lori could be found has stopped me." "Why? Are you sick?"</p>
<p>"As I said, I have-problems. They are the only ones with a data base on all theraces, including mine, within who knows how far. Their practice here iscertainly honest and above board or they would have been forced to moveelsewhere. I have been thinking of going to them and asking if there wassomething they could do to help me control this or damp it down. When you findyourself not merely sweeping with a broom but making love to it, it is timesomething was done. I have no money, and they are unlikely to be cheap. I amashamed that I must ask you if you will cover my bill if I go there." "Well, yes, of course-if you're sure. But I don't like it, and I know Anne Mariewon't, either. If even part of their reputation is true, you could wind up farworse off than you started."</p>
<p>"I'm aware of that, but this will not be some hapless captive coming into theirclutches. You will know that I am going there, and it will be all up front. Itis not likely that they could stand to create a monster in public, let alonehave a distinctive patient vanish, and I will know the options and be able tochoose which or whether to do anything at all."</p>
<p>"Very well, then, dear, go to them. I fear as much for your mind and soul as foryour body, though. I have already seen you undergo so many personality changes,I am not sure who exactly I am talking to sometimes, if you will pardon mysaying so."</p>
<p>Alowi smiled. "I understand. In fact, I understand a lot more about myself thanI did. The truth is, I think those all were different people, or different partsof me, all mixed up inside. It has taken me a long time, and many shocks, to putany of it together. Julian Beard is essentially dead. I have all of hisknowledge, but I have no direct memories or feelings of being him. It is morelike-well, viewing a very long motion picture of somebody's life. It is veryodd. I know every detail, but not as if I had actually done it. Rather, it is asif I had been standing there, ghostly, watching it all being done. I can thinkabout how to do things with soft, five-fingered hands, but I cannot reallyimagine having such a hand. When I look in a mirror, what is reflected there isme. And the odd thing is, I like what I see. Nothing else-computes, you mightsay. I hate the Erdomese government, church, and system, and I cannot say that Iwish I had been born with the freedom a man has there, but I am who and what Iam, and I am comfortable with that. I just wish they would be. So, for better orworse, I am Alowi and I am too damned smart to go home."</p>
<p>"I-I suppose I understand. At least as much as I could without being you.Certainly I have undergone something much milder myself. I know how to fly a747, but the knowledge seems academic now, not personal, even though it was whatI loved more than anything else. Somewhere, near the end of that last longvoyage that left us here, I just suddenly woke up one day and felt absolutelycomfortable and normal, not just as a Dillian but as a woman and a woman with atwin sister. And it did not even disturb me-I didn't fight it at all. When Ifinally admitted this to Anne Marie back in Liliblod, I found that she felt thesame. Since then I haven't even dreamed of the past, although I have had a fewnightmares involving being on a ship at night. Yes, perhaps I can understand, toa degree at least."</p>
<p>You have changed more dramatically than that, starting from when we set out, butit has become a real change since we have been here."</p>
<p>"Huh? In what ways?"</p>
<p>"No matter how identical you looked, it was always easy to tell you apart. AnneMarie was more of a motherly type, and she had many affectations that came outin how she spoke and even moved. You moved very differently, with a bolder,prouder manner, a tough, more masculine way of speaking, that sort of thing. Ifyou bumped yourself, you would curse; Anne Marie would say, 'Oh dear!' orsomething equally quaint. As we went along, I began to notice that the two ofyou were growing more and more alike. You lost a degree of that masculinity,began to move in more feminine ways, while Anne Marie seemed to pick up thatpart you lost, becoming tougher and more confident. You have added more femininewords, and she has dropped some of her more obvious old-fashioned quaintness.You now pay attention to jewelry, cosmetics, hair, that sort of thing, eventhough you are hardly doing it for her or for some man. You are doing it foryourself, and it is exactly why she does it. And then there are the halfconversations."</p>
<p>Tony was fascinated by this. "The what?"</p>
<p>"I am sure that neither of you is aware of it, but when you talk to each other,what must seem like whole complicated dialogues are really often sets ofunconnected half sentences, words, and such, and often you will finish oneanother's sentences."</p>
<p>"I-I never realized-"</p>
<p>"I did not think you did. Physically you are absolutely identical, I think moreso than any natural identical twins could be. Together, over time, while I havesorted myself out, you two have been doing the same, only less dramatically,more slowly and subtly. You are not really Tony anymore, nor is she Anne Marie.You are someone different, an average of the two. Only the difference in yourknowledge bases keeps you from being almost one individual in two bodies. Thatalone will keep you slightly different, which is, I suspect, all to the good.Everyone should have a little something to make them different. But that is theextent of it."</p>
<p>Tony thought about it, not sure if she was pleased with the idea but seeing theultimate point, which was the same one Alowi had made about herself: they werewho and what they were. One either accepted that and learned to live with it orone killed oneself. Period.</p>
<p>The Well World worked some of the magic; the rest had to be supplied frominside, from the mind and soul.</p>
<p>"Make your appointment," Tony told the Erdomese. "But make no rash orirreversible decisions."</p>
<p>Doctor Drinh was an Agonese, and after all this time in the province, learningthe language and the culture, Alowi still couldn't tell one from another withouta uniform or badge of rank. He specialized in treating aliens but was adiagnostician and planner. Others, some so alien that they made Erdomese andAgonese look like relatives, did the actual work.</p>
<p>Drinh put the Erdomese profile on the computer, then took samples of blood fromAlowi for comparison, then ran them through a myriad of automated tests andlooked over the results.</p>
<p>"Well, I can say that your feelings will not get much worse than they are, butthey won't get any better, either. It must make for early marriages and activehoneymoons, at least." He paused. "Sorry if the attempt at humor was offensive." "No, no," she assured him. "It is absolutely correct. Child marriage is the normin Erdom."</p>
<p>"Yes, but you see, in this sort of thing the tension builds up, releasing anoverdose of all sorts of brain chemicals, and it stays pretty well 'on,' as itwere. You seem extremely intelligent and self-controlled, but I would be remissif I didn't tell you that if a male of your race, any male, came within youreyesight, you would become, pardon, a whimpering, begging fool. It is inevitablewith these sorts of readings."</p>
<p>"I know that. It is why I am here. The odds of me meeting a man of my race whileI am over here are pretty slim, but as you say, I am smart enough to know that Icannot go home and remain so."</p>
<p>"Just so, just so," Drinh muttered. "We don't have much on culture here exceptthose sort of taboo listings so that we don't do anything to someone that wouldcause social or mental damage or the like, but I did note that the society islabeled 'patriarchal.' So what would you like me to do, assuming it is doable?" Alowi sighed. "I-I need it to be damped down. Some way to put it under controlso I can live with it."</p>
<p>"Well, the most obvious way if you never intend to have children or have anysexual relations with another of your kind would be to remove the sexual organs.It is a radical and permanent solution, but it would cause the hormones andpsychochemicals to shut off eventually, and with it all sexual desire." It was a more radical solution than she wanted, but she couldn't quite dismissit out of hand. "It is something to think about if all else fails, but I wouldrather not. It would change me in other ways, too, would it not?" "Well, I couldn't know, although I can put in for research notes via Zone andfind out. Logic and experience with other races suggest that there would becomplications, yes. With someone of your type, basically mammalian, the breastswould sag and be encumbrances, you'd probably get extremely fat, there might besome long-term problems with bone integrity and the like, and your energy levelswould tend to be down, at the very least."</p>
<p>"I like myself as I am. I think I would rather try going for the one problemrather than something that radical."</p>
<p>He shrugged. "Well, there are drugs that might work, but they would have to bespecially formulated for your species-we wouldn't exactly be expected to stockErdomese materials-or brought from Erdom via Zone, and either would be expensiveand require that they be taken regularly over decades, judging from yourapparent physical age. If you are wealthy, well connected, and will be in onespot, like this city, it would work. Otherwise… And if you came off them,particularly suddenly and dramatically, your system might go wild. There wouldbe a danger of losing all control, of becoming little more than an animal inheat, and how long this would go on until you came back to present levels isimpossible to say."</p>
<p>Alowi was feeling less and less like she had any way out.</p>
<p>"There is a third way," the doctor went on, thinking. "Radical and somewhatcostly up front, although possibly not, depending on how much work is actuallyinvolved."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Before going further, I must tell you that it is not approved medicine.Strictly experimental, although we have had tremendous successes with it and fewfailures. I am quite certain that it would work in your case. It has come out ofour own research work here."</p>
<p>"Go on."</p>
<p>"The process is complex, but basically it is rewriting your genetic code, ratherrapidly. Do you understand what that means?"</p>
<p>She was shocked at the idea that they had such abilities, but she nodded. "Yes,I do, at least in its implications. Can you really do it?"</p>
<p>Drinh sat back. "We can do more than you ever dreamed with it. We take only afew cells, and we alter the code. Then the mathematics of the coding is fed intotiny semiorganic devices, machines if you will, but on a scale so small, theycould be seen with only the finest microscopes. They replicate themselves withastonishing speed, enter every cell in your body, and rewrite the code. Thenthey die and are passed out in the normal way or allow themselves to be consumedby the body's defenses. The process is quite rapid. The cells quite literallybecome other cells. Major changes can cause a great deal of temporary discomfortand disorientation, but relatively minor ones such as we are talking about mightwell not be noticed, or no more than catching a minor virus at the worst." "You can really do this?"</p>
<p>"We do it regularly. Of course, there are limits. I could not, for example, turnyou from being an Erdomese into one of my own race. At some point you would beneither one nor the other, and the stress would kill you. But if you merelywanted to look like an Agonite, that I could do. Of course, we are talking farless than that here."</p>
<p>She couldn't believe what she was hearing. "Look like an Agonite? The process isthat comprehensive?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes." He seemed somewhat uncomfortable all of a sudden, though, as if he'dalready said more than he had intended.</p>
<p>She had a sudden thought. "You could not turn me into a man, could you? AnErdomese man?"</p>
<p>"Alas, no," the doctor sighed, and seemed to relax a bit. "The reverse, yes,because in your race and many others the male contains only half the geneticmakeup; the other half is female, coming from the mother. But you have two setsof female genes, so there is nothing there to edit. If you were male, I couldremove the male chromosomes, duplicate the female ones, alter them somewhat, andrecombine them so you would turn into a perfect, fully functioning female. Butthe other way-well, one must have something to work with, and your race is evenmore peculiar than most bisexual races in that you have no male hormones or malepsychochemicals at all. Disappointed?"</p>
<p>"No, not really," she answered, realizing that what she was saying was true."But what could you do to me?"</p>
<p>"Oh, a lot of things. The possibilities are vast. To address the immediateproblem, it would be a matter of finding the triggers and dampening them down.The work is complex because it is subtle, exacting, and challenging. It must bedone just right. If we got it wrong, we might not catch the problem; or it couldthrow you off and create violent mood swings, intermittent pain, or evenpsychotic episodes. If we had an Erdomese clientele, it might be rather simple,but as we do not, it would be a matter of trial and possibly error. In fact, letme put the data into the computer and see what the risks might be." He turned in his chair to a console, and although it had full audio inputcapabilities in Agonese, he used a complex keyboard instead.</p>
<p>All the better to keep trade secrets and control the conversation, she realized. In less than a minute a string of Agonese text came up on the screen, much of itpunctuated with graphic images of things that were beyond her comprehension.Also, the screen was angled sufficiently to keep her from reading more than bitsand pieces without being obvious.</p>
<p>Finally he turned back to her. "There are two possibilities that seem just aboutequal. Now, understand, I do not mean two different things we might attempt.Rather, there are two equally possible outcomes to the attempt as postulated.There is absolutely no way to be positive short of, well, experimentation. Wehave no case histories to tell which way it will go."</p>
<p>She couldn't imagine where he was heading. "Yes?"</p>
<p>"Well, there is about a three percent chance of serious complications. I tellyou that up front, but that is actually a very small percentage in this kind ofprocess. There is no risk-free solution. Beyond those unknowables, there is abetter than forty-nine percent chance that it will decouple your mind from yourdesires."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon. What does that mean, exactly?"</p>
<p>"Basically, you would be fully capable of performing as a woman, but you wouldlack all desire to do so, even in the face of stimulus-response. You wouldsimply be incapable of arousal. There is a medical term for this, but I do notknow how it would translate. It is physiological frigidity."</p>
<p>She nodded. "I understand the idea. I would be turned off of sex, as it were."She thought about it. "Is it- reversible?"</p>
<p>"I would not recommend attempting a reversal. Changing the changed is always ahundred times more dangerous, because we would have even less to go on and therisk of things going terribly wrong would be major. Of course, you could alwaystake injections or oral hormones to artificially restore it to some degree oranother, but it would be temporary and administered by a clinic like this one,which could determine and synthesize what was needed."</p>
<p>"I see." It was in many ways an attractive possibility. "But Doctor, I can add.You have left almost forty-eight percent unaccounted for."</p>
<p>"Urn, yes, I was coming to that. The problem is, the same regions of the brainand the same chemical balances serve more than one function, and without priorresearch we can be only so delicate. The nearly equal chance would be to achievenot a neutral balance but opposition. You would have no arousal or desire tocopulate with males, but you would find yourself attracted to and potentiallyaroused by other females. You would not suffer the borderline psychochemicallyinduced nymphomania that is at the heart of your problem, but you would bevulnerable, as with most sexual creatures, to stimulus-response." "You mean I would react like a man."</p>
<p>"No, not precisely. In the sense of stimulus-response to females, yes, but youwould not think of yourself as male or have male responses and desires, in someraces a small percentage of people are born this way. It would solve yourproblem, because you would be unlikely in any event to encounter females outsideof Erdom, but not as completely as neutralization, and of course drug andhormone therapy to restore normalcy would be very unlikely."</p>
<p>She considered it. Bizarre-that the worst-case scenario would be to wind up viewing women close to the way Julian Beard was brought up seeing them. ButBeard had always been fully capable of giving up almost anything, even sex, forvery long periods, and certainly, if it couldn't be Lori, she would rather notever be tempted, even accidentally, by one of those native men. "How-how soon would I see a difference?" she asked him.</p>
<p>He shrugged. "Impossible to say for sure. Still, only automatic andstimulus-response chemical actions in your brain would be affected, so thechange would be quite rapid. The practical effect might be noticed in days,perhaps hours, although total and permanent change might take a few weeks. Weare dealing here only with a very small reprogramming of an even smaller area.But the permanence of the process is important to remember; if you wish to haveanything else done, it is best to have it done all at once."</p>
<p>"Anything else?" She could see his gaze. "Oh, the hands. I thought about thatafter what you said, but… Well, you said it would take away my desire. Wouldit do more? Would it make me antichild, for example, or incapable of lovingsomeone or having other normal emotions?"</p>
<p>"Again, you'd need an Erdomese physician to fully answer that. It is not likethis has been done before, let alone repeatedly, with someone of your race.There are bound to be some ancillary changes we can't foresee, but not drasticones. I doubt if you will become some sort of emotionless, cold individual oranything like that. It might even work the other way. You might find that youremotions in other areas are stronger. There is often that sort of compensation.But would you love your child if you had one? Of course you would." "Then I cannot have the hands done. If you check your data base, you will seethat these are essential for one of my kind to have a normal childbirth. I wantas few options closed as possible. I just want relief."</p>
<p>"Then you shall have it," Doctor Drinh assured her. "We have your residencehere. I will get our computers to work on this and see what is what, then callwith price and such. I really do think this might well be the best thing foryou, considering your circumstances."</p>
<p>Alowi left, and the doctor immediately went into the back of the clinic andwalked briskly into the laboratory portion of the building, where a huge,sluglike creature was working at a machine using countless wormlike tendrils. "You heard and followed, Nuoak?"' Drinh asked the other.</p>
<p>"I did. The problem she seeks relief for is real."</p>
<p>"I know, I know, but I haven't felt fully comfortable since they moved here. Ialmost told her there was no help, but I think that would have been worse thanthe truth in arousing suspicion."</p>
<p>"Your professional pride and bragging got the best of you, and you know it. Sheis exceptionally bright and knowledgeable and as an offworlder has the educationand possibly the cultural background to eventually put two and two together,particularly with the added detail you gave her. I don't like it." "But what can we do? We can hardly dispose of her. The Dillians are her comradesand titular employees of their state. They have council contacts that make themtoo dangerous to involve. But if we play normal, she will almost certainly putthe facts together and start snooping in earnest. Then what?" He thought amoment. "I suppose we could slow down her data processing speed and limit herretention. Do it slowly, and she wouldn't even be aware of it or even care ifshe did notice. If the Dillians noticed and wouldn't accept it as some naturalmental problem, we could always claim it as an unfortunate side effect." "Too obvious," Nuoak responded. "The data that we got from the security policesuggest she learned Agonian in only a few months and is well on her way toreading Standard. No, looking over the data, a more interesting suggestion comesto mind."</p>
<p>"Yes? You have an idea?"</p>
<p>"I do not believe that she is a direct threat to us. The chemistry here isfascinating. She is almost totally nonaggressive, quite literally incapable ofdefending herself against any significant threat. It must have taken every bitof her willpower to just come here on her own. She might well suspect the truthto a very great degree, but she would be incapable of acting upon it." "She had the guts to come in here and be pretty cool about it." "That is less a function of biology than force of will over biology, resultingfrom the fact that before Well processing she was male and, to some degree, byher mind battling against her body. The urges inside her must be excruciating.But no, we must accept that she will suspect, or already does, and perhaps eventell her friends about her suspicions. The fact is, though, that they can donothing at all about it. They remain here only as her friends and protectors andpossibly out of a bit of fear of actually returning to Dillia and taking upnormal lives there. It must be quite a difficult thing to actually bringyourself to do. Still, they must be unhappy here, and bored and frustrated. Theywould leave if they saw a way, I feel certain. They are held by the one pressurethis Erdomese girl can bring to bear; a version of passive aggression. 'If youleave, I'll stay here and die.' Remove that and you remove the problems, all ofthem."</p>
<p>"I am listening."</p>
<p>'The odds you quoted were correct, but surely you noticed that we can tip thescales on one of them. We have the orientation model from the male Erdomese inthe computer now. If we use that as our model, it would also be possible tointroduce a tapeworm of sorts. It would search through her catalog of memorieswhile she slept looking for the specific pattern of her memories of her husbandand their time together, and allow her mind to restructure those events." "A tapeworm is the most dangerous thing you can do in a sentient creature,"Drinh noted nervously. "We might as well change all her memories for the mess itwould be likely to cause! Best to just kidnap her and be done with it if that isyour solution!"</p>
<p>"You misunderstand. The limited nature of this program is so subtle, sheprobably will not even be aware of it. At worst, she will either blame it on theresults of the reorientation and accept it as a minor side effect or take it as an inner revelation of something that's been there all along. It won't matter.It will not change her relationship with the Dillians one bit, and it willproduce a logical result. She will not only have little motivation other thanfriendship to want to find this husband of hers, she will have an even greatermotivation for fearing finding him as she remembers him. As this plays out, wecan find someone, perhaps connected to the Great University at Czill or somelesser institution, with the potential to offer her some sort of position. Shewould be among many species and would not stand out as particularly alien, andher knowledge of Standard would allow her to do academic research. I believe heroffworld profession was some sort of geologist, at least judging from thosesecret police reports. A passive, productive, rewarding job in a protectedsetting. You see?"</p>
<p>"I see. It is a good plan."</p>
<p>"Only you do not agree?"</p>
<p>"I agree because I have no choice," Drinh replied, "and nothing better to offer.But you are a logical scientist from a race that does not have the sexualcontext both her race and mine share. People do not always react logically inthis sort of situation. Nor do I think the Dillians stayed for her alone. Notthis long. There is something to be said for comradeship and for the sense ofpersonal violation, of insult, when it is broken up the way their group's was. Idon't even think the two lost people are at the heart of it, not anymore. Somepeople simply have a strong urge to see justice, and I think that may be in playhere."</p>
<p>"There is no such thing as justice if you have a good enough attorney," Nuoakcommented.</p>
<p>"There you go being logical again!"</p>
<p>The call came in only a day later. The clinic could perform the procedure at anytime, given a few hours' warning to actually synthesize and program the tinymicrogadgets. They were confident, it was a simple procedure, and the price theyquoted was considerably less than the translator had cost. Considerably less. "Well, I don't like it," Anne Marie said flatly. "It isn't natural. And what'sto keep them from fouling your brain chemistry all over to hell and gone? Why,suppose they can do all they say! Why, after that stuff's inside you, you won'tbe able to stop it! You could wind up being turned into a cow or somethingworse!"</p>
<p>Alowi shook her head. "I do not think he would do that. He might if I were somecaptured guinea pig, but not to paying patients who come in the front door. Igot the impression that they were a lot more experienced with this than theywant to admit. And they have probably won friends by doing big favors-fixingcongenital defects, perhaps regrowing limbs, maybe even the reverse of what I amthinking of."</p>
<p>"But what if, somehow, sometime, we or somebody finds and liberates Lori? How'slie going to feel with a permanently frigid wife?"</p>
<p>"I-I thought about that, but I can no longer let that enter into my plans. If Iam to be the first totally free Erdomese woman in history, then I have to go allthe way with it. If he is found, then I will still be me, and if he wants more,well, Erdomese are polygamists. Actually, I have had more dark thoughts aboutLori since consulting with Drinh."</p>
<p>"Huh? What do you mean?" Tony asked her. "Well, everybody says that the clinicworks with criminal gangs, and we know who is most likely to have that kind ofclout and protection. Suppose there is a really good reason why nobody has seena trace of Lori or Mavra. Suppose they were two of the clinic's guinea pigs forits ambitious experiments. He said he could actually make me look Agonese. Whatcould he make either of them into?"</p>
<p>"Oh, my I" Tony exclaimed, sounding exactly like Anne Marie.</p>
<p>"But that makes putting yourself in their hands even worse!” Anne Marieprotested. "If they did do something to Lori, something monstrous, then theyalmost certainly know who you are. Suppose they think you're really there to spyon them! That you're on to them! They could do something to you and then, whenit was noticed, say, 'Oops! Sorry! We made a big mistake! But it wasexperimental and we didn't know everything about Erdomese women and you werewarned of the dangers.' What could we do? Nothing!"</p>
<p>"I thought of that, but I do not think they are the kind to panic, and I reallybelieve they will be extra careful not to do anything wrong simply to keep us ata dead end. Besides, if I do not do something, I am going to go crazy. If theyare the ones who stole the life I was content to lead, then they owe me a lifeof independence at least."</p>
<p>"I have a bad feeling about this," both centauresses said in unison, anotherthing they did more and more often. "But if you are determined, we will notstand in your way."</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>"If they do anything other than what they promised…" said one. "… Then we will be on them like a ton of lead," the other finished. They set up an appointment with Doctor Drinh.</p>
<p>Alowi sat there on the stool as before, in the outer office, feeling nervous butdetermined.</p>
<p>Drinh was the competent physician now, taking final samples, giving her athorough checkout, and running the resulting data through his medical computers.Finally he said, "All seems in good order. All that remains is to ask once againif you really wish to go through with this, because once done, it is done." She nodded. Sorry, Lori, but I just can't stand this otherwise. "I would nothave returned if I had not already decided. Let me get it over with." Doctor Drinh walked to the back of the office and opened a compartment, removinga clear rectangular container in which there was some equally clear liquid. Hetook out an Agonian syringe, which resembled a small flashlight with two nubs, put it against the container, and pushed a button on the syringe. Almostinstantly the fluid was gone, drawn into the syringe. He then walked over towhere Alowi sat and stood by her. "This is it," he told her. "Say no now or itis done." She swallowed hard. "Do it."</p>
<p>She felt the two nubs of the syringe against her right rump, then a suddentingling sensation much like a minor electric shock, and then nothing. The doctor put away the syringe and replaced the container. She sat there amoment, wondering what was next. "You may go now," he told her, soundingsatisfied.</p>
<p>She felt surprise. "That is it? That is all there is?"</p>
<p>"That's it. Period. You might feel some dizziness or disorientation off and on,and you might run a slight fever, so take it very easy for a few days. Theremight also be some confusing or bizarre dreams and thoughts for a bit, but thatshould last only a day or two. You should certainly notice a lessening in yourtension by tomorrow at the latest. Also, I would walk back rather than ride ifyou feel up to it. It will help distribute the serum in your system." She got up. "I hope it works," she told him.</p>
<p>"I hope it works, too," he responded with a sincere smile.</p>

<p>LORI, TOO, COULD NOT HELP BUT NOTICE THAT JUAN CAMPOS'S well-planned andfiendish revenge was not as complete as it had been intended to be. Overloadedwith the mind-numbing drug, sent through a training course over and over andover again until all action was automatic, he had been beyond even caring whathad happened. Weeks of Pavlovian training and then the real thing, trips backand forth by night without the slightest deviation along back trails laced withan overpowering scent unique to him, all seemed to be one continuous blur,without a sense of time, place, or event.</p>
<p>How long this had gone on, he could not know, but slowly, ever so slowly, hebegan to come out of the stupor. Rational thought returned with the sameslowness, in fits and starts. He was unable to distinguish what was real fromwhat was dream, but eventually he came to understand that for some reason thatdrug no longer affected him, that its power was fading with increasingquickness.</p>
<p>There was some sense of denial about that fact. He didn't want to come out ofit, didn't want to think and perhaps face the pain and monotony of this life,but his own inner strength denied him the oblivion he needed.</p>
<p>What did it matter that he was no longer addicted except to add to the torture?If they found out, they might not trust him anymore, and that would mean hisfinish.</p>
<p>But that, too, was an odd thought. Wouldn't death be preferable to a life ofthis!</p>
<p>The answer, though, was no.</p>
<p>That left escape, even though he was a four-footed freak far from any home orhelp, forever cut off from rational communication with the outside world. Evenif that weird new translator didn't encode everything in and out, it wouldprobably be useless. His mouth felt funny; it wasn't malleable as it always hadbeen. Even the limited communication he'd had with the handlers who had specialtranslators to make themselves understood was now one-way. The only sound heseemed capable of anymore was from very deep inside and sounded more like a brayand meant nothing. His handlers, usually none too bright underlings, had foundthat amusing.</p>
<p>Still, it had been a shock to find out that indeed he had changed so radicallyand that after all this time of staring down at the ground, his neck was somehownow long enough and flexible enough to allow him to look straight ahead. Infact, it became increasingly flexible as time wore on.</p>
<p>They had fused his hands to form hoofs and, after castration, had filled himwith female hormones that had produced grotesque travesties of Erdomese breasts.Yet now the breasts seemed to have shrunk away while the legs and hooves seemedto have solidified and changed. Through the fragmented and confused mental hazehe was in, he realized at some point that he was very, very different from whatCampos had intended or how he'd started out under the hands of those maniacalbutchers.</p>
<p>His vision was weak, distorted, and without color, but it had tremendouscontrast abilities. It was hard to imagine that there were this many scales ofgray. Vision was short-range but sharp straight on, but there was little if anyperipheral vision to speak of. To see something to the side, he had to move hishead rather than his eyes. It took some getting used to once he started to tryto use his vision again for more than spotting things to step over. Anythingoutside a two- to seven-meter range was a gray blur. This was true day or night,although night was more comfortable. Bright light, even reflected, blinded himfor a minute or more after he turned to avoid it. Hearing and smell were muchmore trustworthy than sight.</p>
<p>I've become some kind of a horse, he realized after a while. Not any horse heknew, but close enough. The forelegs were true forelegs, the front hooves truehooves, and the joints angled like a horse's joints. Everything wasproportional, comfortable, balanced. His nose and mouth had elongated andcombined into an equine head, and somehow he'd grown a long bushy tail. His earsfelt funny, too, but he couldn't tell why. The one thing he still had as beforewas the horn.</p>
<p>A unicorn, he thought at last, the old vision coming from deep in the past. Buta unicorn with no interest in virgins; most definitely a gelding. How did it happen, and how long had it taken? No way to know, but it was likelythat those butcher bastards had access to technology far in advance of meremutilation, perhaps some kind of rapid genetic manipulation.</p>
<p>Still, how rapid was "rapid"? Not only were the days under the drug's influencea blur, but even when his mind had returned, his sense of time had not. When hewas hungry, which seemed to be most of the time, he ate large quantities ofgrass and bushes and whatever else looked green and tempting. He wondered howmuch he weighed. He didn't seem all that much bigger, certainly not true horsesize. Probably the size of a Shetland pony, but perfectly proportioned. The thought of the virgins made him aware of just what had been removed. Heremembered Alowi fondly but could not even recall what kind of sexual attractionshe'd had. It was more than the loss of ability or desire; he seemed to havetotally lost even the memories of the feelings that sexuality had brought, humanor Erdomese, male or female.</p>
<p>He knew the lack of it should have bothered him, but it didn't; instead, it onlybothered him that there was now a hole somewhere inside him where something oncevalued and prized had been, something now utterly excised. It was in many waysthe same as the loss of any sense of time and, oddly, no more disturbing orimportant to him.</p>
<p>There was a certain satisfaction in that. To deny him sexuality had been theheart of Campos's revenge. That he neither missed it nor gave it any morethought after this was another slap in the bastard's face.</p>
<p>He had become a unique animal but a consistent one. It was stupid andmeaningless to dwell on anything he lacked, particularly something that was nowno more than a set of definitions for how a species reproduced itself. If hecould get a better handle on what it had once meant or felt like, perhaps hewould think it a tragedy, but for now it seemed somehow-liberating. When one waswithout sex, one had no stereotyping, no fears or expectations based on a factorthat did not apply to one, and when one was one of a kind, as lonely as thatmight become, there were neither expectations nor fears from peers. It was gone,every last bit of it, and being gone, it took with it all sense of deprivationor loss. It was irrelevant. "Relevant" was learning everything there was tolearn about what he now was and how he interacted with everything else. The scent he followed, whose slightest trace he could pick out of hundreds ofothers, he soon realized was the scent of his own excrement. It interestedrather than revolted him to discover that he had virtually no bladder or bowelcontrol. It came out when it was ready and had to, but only when he was inmotion, never when he was still or asleep. Once discovered, that fact, too, wassimply discarded and not thought of again because it didn't matter. That was howhe was, period.</p>
<p>Each trip through the dim forests of Liliblod found him growing more and morecomfortable with this new form and thinking about things that were importantrather than dwelling on his twin pasts, both of which seemed to have decreasingrelevance or even interest to him. Instead, he concentrated on developing hissuperior sense of hearing, which could pick out the song of a distant bird or achorus of sonorous insects with ease, and in determining and cataloging whateach sound meant. Similarly, classifying every scent, every odor, analyzing notonly the ground and trees but the very breezes, provided vital information oncehe'd matched scent to source. Since there was a mind behind that classificationsystem and nothing else to do but walk, smell and sound proved to be moreprecise than sight had ever been.</p>
<p>He knew he'd have to become an expert at this, since the same line of thoughttold him that he would have no choice but to escape as soon as he felt it wassafe to do so. Not that he had any illusions about the rest of his life even ifhe did get away. He would neither understand nor be understood by anyone else,he had no hands or tentacles with which to write, and he didn't know how to readany native languages. He'd be an animal, period, able to perhaps study andexplore for the sake of knowledge but not to interact. It wasn't what he wouldreally want, but it was absolutely preferable to staying where he was. Death wasbetter than that and more moral, but somehow he didn't want to die. Not now. Notyet.</p>
<p>The fact remained, though, that he was carrying a drug that allowed evil peopleto poison other people, to steal their very minds and souls, and he simply couldnot continue to be a part of that. He felt bad about what he'd already carriedfor them, but to continue to serve them once he felt confident enough to getaway was unthinkable. And, too, his careful studies of Liliblod had revealedsomething of the nature and nastiness of its inhabitants, and he knew that whensomeone got a whim or when he was older or perhaps got sick or hurt, those whonow worked him would not hesitate to feed him to those damned tree-dwellingmonstrosities.</p>
<p>He'd seen them clearly only once, although he knew their sounds and scents andknew that they were always there, high up above, a thought that also made escapeseem attractive. Accompanied by one of his handlers, he had carried in a hugeload of what smelled like monstrous chocolate bars. Part of the payoff, heunderstood, for the creatures keeping the back trails used by the couriers opento the drug runners and no one else. And down they'd come, from the very tops ofthe trees, where their vast ropelike webs created almost a roof over the hex.Huge spiderlike creatures the size of a ten-year-old child, with eight hairylegs that ended in small but malleable pincers and bright, shiny brown bodiestopped by demonic heads with gaping mouths and hateful, bright red eyes. He andthe handler left as quickly as possible, since chocolate had been known to sendthe Liliblodians into a frenzy of uncontrollable and often violent behavior. Allfemale, the handler had told him. The tiny, mindless, wormlike males crawledliterally into the wombs and were sealed inside, their outer skins dissolved byspecial juices releasing the sperm, and the remainder provided the food for thebrood until they were ready to be hatched.</p>
<p>It was not a nice thought that so many of them, perhaps tens of thousands, wereclustered up there and could drop down at any moment if the bargain suddenlyseemed not to their liking. That was why they used "mules" like Lori for most ofthe work.</p>
<p>No, there would have to be an escape, and if this trail went only from Agon toClopta, then his escape would have to happen at one of the ends of the route. Hewas pretty sure that there was no real escape in Liliblod.</p>
<p>He wished he knew what had become of the others. Although he felt no physicalattraction, poor Alowi, or Julian, was still as close a friend as he had here,and without him she was in a real mess. She would never go home, but she mightwell kill herself, and that was the most worrisome thing of all. The Dillianswere probably well out of it- he'd never really understood why they were in itin the first place, except that they'd once been human and were at least still abit human, as were the others. Still, they had potential lives back in theirhome hex and no stake in this affair. And then there was Mavra Chang. If theyhad done this to him, what had they done to her? Or was that a long-termconcern? Didn't Mavra claim that she could not be killed, that anything injuredor lost would regrow, that no damage was permanent to her? Sooner or later, nomatter what monster they'd made of her, they'd have to take her to that Well,whatever it was. They'd have to risk it, whoever "they" might be, because theother fellow might get there ahead of her if they didn't. Then she would be inreal trouble, but then, whoever had Chang and hadn't at least made the attemptwould probably be in worse shape.</p>
<p>Well, there was little chance he'd ever find out how any of them had made out.It was enough to try to figure out how and where to escape.</p>
<p>Agon would be better geographically; it hadn't seemed overly developed for ahigh-technology hex, and there was a lot of rough country in the north, and itwas connected, if he remembered correctly, to other hexes for vast distances.The trouble was, he wasn't ever technically in Agon; the cleverly concealedentrance to the headquarters was in Liliblod even though the whole undergroundcomplex was under Agon's soil. It wouldn't be much of a run to bypass it, butthere were so many guards and so much in the way of defenses that it was a sureroute to capture and disaster.</p>
<p>That left Clopta, which seemed almost paved over from the moment one reached theborder, as overdeveloped as Agon seemed just right. But the warehouse therewhere the trail ended was well within the border and was in the middle of whatappeared to be an industrial district. Most of the time a handler was rightthere, waiting, but every once in a while they missed him, and he would have tomake his way several blocks along dark back alleys between warehouses andfactories to the rendezvous. If they did it again, he would go. He felt as readyas he would ever be, and the alternatives seemed increasingly bleak. Theywouldn't expect it; they thought he still needed that drug.</p>
<p>He was always surprised when he reached the border, even though he could smell abit of Clopta as he grew near. With no time sense and no more drug craving, henever seemed to know how long he'd been on the trail or just how far along it hemight be. It was daylight by the time he reached it this time, and that meant hewould have to stop and wait. There were clear instructions that under nocircumstances was he to enter Clopta in daylight or while there was any trafficin the immediate area.</p>
<p>The hex boundary remained the most dramatic feature of the Well World, even now.It appeared to his altered eyes as a thin but infinite piece of semitransparentgauze at which the endless Liliblodian forest stopped with amazing suddenness,replaced by a brightly lit but sterile-looking mass of metallic buildings. Itwas hard to look at them too long; sunlight would catch some window or piece ofpolished metal, and he would be suddenly blinded. Muffled sounds of muchactivity came through the barrier: sounds of machinery operating, men yelling,vehicles going this way and that, huge doors sliding open or closed-all thesounds of a manufacturing district, although what they made there he did notknow.</p>
<p>They had built right up to the boundary, too. Space was at a premium in landswith rigidly fixed borders, and they used it well. Most likely this had alwaysbeen an industrial district; it was possible that the whole border with Liliblodwas this way and that all heavy industry was concentrated in a strip. If he hadthese kind of neighbors, that was what he would do. He certainly hoped that itwas so. It might mean that the rest of the hex was a lot more livable andperhaps had trees and forests into which he could disappear. If no one met him,it would make sense to go right, then left, keeping to the alleyways but off thetrail. That would take him into the hex and away from any sort of activity. Thetrail had only ten or so meters in the open before it went into a thin alleybetween two tall, smelly structures. It did have to cross a few broader streets,some with loading docks on either side and a set of rails going down thecenter-he had to watch his step in order not to get a hoof caught in the gap.But the trail mainly kept to the back alleys and side streets until it reachedthe one warehouse where things went on after dark that were probably unknown tothose who worked in the area during the day.</p>
<p>He hadn't seen Campos, there or anywhere else, since the first couple of runsright at the beginning. Apparently she was satisfied enough by her first visitsand didn't need to see much more. It didn't matter, anyway. Some things of anemotional nature had not been excised, and one of those, now that the drug hadno more hold, might well cause him to impale a certain person on his horn nomatter what the cost to himself and any future he might have, no matter howbleak. That might well be worth it.</p>
<p>I'll bet Mavra spends at least a little bit each day regretting she didn'tlisten to us and kill the little turd or at least leave him to the mercies ofthe People.</p>
<p>He ate and slept most of the day, waking up occasionally but not for long andmostly to eat some more. It seemed like no time before the shadows fell andnight came upon the Well World.</p>
<p>He went close to the boundary but didn't yet cross. He wanted all the sounds tovanish into the distance first.</p>
<p>Maybe this is it, he thought anxiously. Maybe nobody will show this time. But somebody did. No Cloptan except someone expecting him would ever go throughthat barrier in this direction, not unless it was on one of the main roads. Thespider bitches would just love a little duck.</p>
<p>He recognized the little man by his scent. The Cloptan was a decent sort ashandlers went, not too bright and very loyal but not cruel to the mules, either.He looked like some bastard relative of Gladstone Gander, except that he worepants.</p>
<p>"Ah, it's you, is it?" the man, whose name was Banam commented, although itsounded like nothing but deep melodic rumblings to Lori. "Well, you can comealong now. It's a holiday here tomorrow and everybody's taken off early, anyway.I'll just get my pushcart and follow you in as usual."</p>
<p>Lori was used to people speaking to him when he couldn't understand a word. In away, he was even more cut off than a real horse, since even real horses couldpick up a few common sounds or terms. It was the worst part of it all, an utterloneliness that came from having no way to truly communicate with anyone except,of course, the absent Campos.</p>
<p>There was a pronounced difference in air pressure when he penetrated theboundary and also a marked rise in humidity. He couldn't tell much about thetemperature, though, except that Banam wore only a light jacket, so it probablywasn't very cold. That was another tiling Lori seemed to have lost; he wasn'tvery aware of, or very sensitive to, temperatures of any sort. Early on, Cloptahad been cold enough for him to see people's breaths, but he'd barely felt athing.</p>
<p>His hooves clattered against the paved street, echoing off the close-in walls.He'd been a bit annoyed that they hadn't shoed him, since there was always thedanger of a split hoof, but now he was glad of it. There wouldn't be anyblacksmiths able to provide the service if he cut out.</p>
<p>"Your design's been a big hit with the bosses, I hear," Banam commentedchattily, never knowing if he could be understood or not and really not caringall that much either way. "I watched you change over the past coupla months froma real mess into a pretty slick-lookin' animal. Heard 'em say they're gonna doit to anybody who can stand the operation or whatever it is. Ain't foreverybody, of course. They'd need black magic to make me into somethin' likeyou, I think." He chuckled at the thought. "Only thing different'11 be thathorn. No horns on the others. Makes some of 'em kinda nervous, y' know. Dunnowhy."</p>
<p>The old fellow just kept chattering as they came up to the warehouse and the endof the trail. Then Banam walked to the front and pushed a series of numbers onthe security lock. There was a sudden rumble, and the door slid up, allowingthem to enter.</p>
<p>It was pitch dark inside, as always, but when the door came back down andsettled with a crash, the lights came back on automatically. No sense in shininga beacon to the world that something was going on here.</p>
<p>They had a sort of stall for him in the back, reached through a maze of shelves,boxes, and palettes and well hidden from view even when the day shift was in.There were a couple of bales of hay there, a tub with water in it, and somethick straw on the floor. That was pretty much all he required. Banam unhooked the cinch and let the packs drop before he went into the stallarea. He fumbled inside, removed a greasy-looking cube, and put it over on topof the hay. 'There's your big reward, fella. Enjoy. I gotta get help and getthis up to the boss."</p>
<p>It was the drug, of course, and now it smelled and tasted as bad as it lookedand did nothing for or to him, but he had to keep eating it just to make surethat they didn't suspect.</p>
<p>The one thing that seemed certain was that it would be another round trip beforehe could escape. Or was it? Had he been thinking the wrong way, perhaps? Theyalmost always accompanied him back to the border but no farther. If he huggedthe border and walked down quite a ways, he might well be able to escape on theway back. It made more sense than the other way, and the thought excited him. If he escaped just after leaving here, then they wouldn't expect him at theother end for quite a while. They might even write him off as having beeninjured and thus made a banquet of by the Liliblodian locals. Now, that seemedto make real sense!</p>
<p>He tried hard to remember the maps. Clopta. Liliblod, and Agon were all on thecoast. That meant Liliblod would be the border along this segment of the hex,going- what?-probably northeast. Southwest would mean the ocean, and that was nogood, and north would most likely take him through the heart of Clopta, not agood option. In a high-tech hex it would be impossible to remain hidden forever.If he only knew how far along the border they were! It might well be shortergoing north if they were near the point where three borders came together. Bestnot to take that much of a chance, though. Stick close to the border, checkevery once in a while, and go when it no longer smelled of spiders. After that it would be time to stop running and start exploring until he came upagainst something with an appetite as bad as a Liliblodian that he couldn'toutrun or impale.</p>
<p>No. Wait a moment. There was a potential destination, wasn't there? The same onethey'd had since the start. That place, that break between the hexes at theequator where those who knew how might be able to enter the inside of thisstrange planet. If anyone got there and could get inside, he wanted to be there.It was the longest shot in the universe, but it was all he had. If he could just survive, get up there, get to that entrance-way, and wait, nomatter how long it took…</p>
<p>It wasn't much, but it was better than nothing. It was somewhere to go andsomething to do, and it was at least a sliver, no matter how microscopic, ofhope.</p>
<p>If not this trip, then the next. The first time they gave him an opening, he hadto have the guts to take it. To get away, to get free, that was the firstobjective. Then, once safe, use the sun as a guide and head north all the way tothe barrier, which he assumed was much like the barrier that formed the southernboundary of Erdom. Then west, toward where the sun rose on this backward-turningworld. West until there was a door.</p>
<p>If not this trip, then the next. Or the next. Whenever it was possible. Ashopeless as it all was, it was the only thing he had.</p>

<p>ALOWI HAD WALKED HOME FROM THE CLINIC FEELING NERVOUS and uncertain about whatshe had done. Nearing the place where she and the Dillians were staying,essentially a huge tent struck on some deserted landfill north of the city, shebegan to feel light-headed, and by the time she was inside, she had the start ofa serious headache. Dizzy and sick, with a throbbing head, she lay down on thepillows in the rear area of the tent and pretty much passed out. More concerned and suspicious of everything were the Dillians, who found her outcold and decided that there was no purpose to rousing her. Some of this was tobe expected from a radical injection, but as Doctor Drinh had feared, they werealso quite suspicious at what Alowi had told them about the capabilities of theprocess. While Tony took care of some business at the port, Anne Marie put in acall to the capital.</p>
<p>While embassy operations on the Well World were best handled within Zone, mosthexes had small offices whose function was to pass messages to and from Zone viaWell Gate couriers. Reciprocity gave any race the right to use the service ofany hex at all, and under diplomatic seal. It wasn't beyond being compromised,but it was effective, and any hex found compromising the system would of courselose its own rights and privacy.</p>
<p>Anne Marie had no intention of giving an oral report but used a recording cubeof the type standardized by Zone and put it under a password that was known onthe other end only to the Dillian ambassador. She dispatched the cube viamessenger service on the next train to the capital, where someone alerted by hercall would pick it up and stick it in the next courier pouch. She had no ideawho would ultimately hear the report and no real hope that those bureaucratscould decide on whether they had to go to the bathroom, let alone anythingimportant, but it was worth trying.</p>
<p>In the message she had simply summarized Alowi's experience to date and relatedthe claims of Drinh and his reputation and voiced her suspicions with hope thatall this would be relayed to the inner council committee that was in charge ofthe "immortals problem," as they so euphemistically put it.</p>
<p>At least the committee had proved honest and reliable. While it had been next toimpossible to sit on the rumor that the ancient and legendary Nathan Brazilmight be back, the fact that Mavra Chang might be an immortal equal to Brazilhad been suppressed to a remarkable degree. The most that seemed to have leakedwas that Chang was wanted because she had known Brazil and might prove useful inmotivating the mysterious man to make a deal. Brazil, however, remained the realtarget for all the factions out there nervous about either his possible powersor his potential; Chang's cover story had been increasingly reinforced to thepoint where no one outside the council took her as more than a minor player, ofno great advantage unless one had Brazil and perhaps not even then. Now, with the readily recognizable Brazil missing for so long and the Avenueswell covered, even the mild hue and cry of earlier times had faded. Mostbelieved him a fable and the missing man simply a man, no more or less, a manwho had caused stupid panic and rumors and who was now probably dead. Thecouncil was doing a nice job of covering up, but it had neither of its ownobjects in sight, let alone in hand. Brazil had vanished and was possibly atleast neutralized as far as could be surmised from current information, andChang had been abducted by the drug cartel and was undoubtedly a prisoner orworse by now. The fact that the drug lords had done nothing with her, though,indicated that they didn't know who and what they had, and it was feared thatany attempt to find her might just tip them off to a key to potentially vastpowers.</p>
<p>It was for this reason that they had allowed nothing to be done, since that waswhat they preferred as a normal course of action, anyway. Now, though, thereport from Anne Marie caused a great deal of concern. If the drug lords hadworked their usual tricks on Mavra Chang, she could literally look like justabout anything; if she really was Brazil's equal, then she could not be killedand thus eventually had the potential to get free-or, worse, break under thestrain and try to make her own deal with the drug lords out of desperation. IfMavra Chang no longer bore any resemblance to Mavra Chang, then the guards atthe Avenues had nothing at all to go on, and they could hardly be obtrusiveabout barring all and sundry from those equatorial entrances without tipping thegame to everyone.</p>
<p>If there was a chance of locating Mavra Chang, the committee knew, then it hadto be taken. But patiently and with sufficient safeguards, no matter howruthless, to keep the true value and nature of the quarry from those who mightuse her.</p>
<p>Once they decided that they had to move, they wanted to move yesterday, but ithad to be done right. Still, it seemed to them that their long lag time hadfinally run out.</p>
<p>"The Dillians in Agon will almost certainly move on this if we do not," onecouncillor argued. 'This cannot be left to amateurs. If they move, they willcertainly fall into the hands of the cartel, who will be merciless in findingout why they were willing to make such a risky move. If the cartel even suspectsChang's true value, all could be lost."</p>
<p>"True," another agreed, "but neither can we leave them out, unless we want themdisposed of."</p>
<p>The Dillian ambassador objected. "That is out of the question! Only if thefuture of the Well World and our authority were clearly at risk would we permitthat! Besides, if Chang now looks nothing like she did, they may well be theonly ones who could establish that a suspected being is Mavra Chang. Remember,two were taken, and we have no way of telling if we capture one just which onewe have. We agree, however, that this is no job for amateurs alone. Who do wehave in the region?"</p>
<p>"The Agonese authorities are compromised," another pointed out. "That leavesonly that immigrant Leeming and the renegade Dahir in the area, both trying tofind Brazil. The Leeming has proved reliable and has some feel for this sort ofwork-"</p>
<p>"But he lost Brazil!" the first councillor pointed out. "He enjoys the work butclearly isn't all that competent at it!"</p>
<p>"And we are, I suppose?" the Dillian retorted. "We've managed to lose both ofthe immortals while we engaged in endless debate and delay. Still, I agree thata native, one of us who is beyond reproach, must be in charge. Preferablysomeone who knows the area and has familiarity with the drug cartel. Anycandidates?"</p>
<p>The problem was fed to the Zone computers, and after a process of elimination,one name, and only one, stood out. "Now the only trick is to prepare a coverstory for going after Chang," the Dillian ambassador said, nodding. 'That andconvincing the Agonese government to give him full authority in this matterwithout their corrupt elements tipping off the cartel."</p>
<p>"That," said another, "will be far easier than what we are asking this fellow todo!"</p>
<p>Anne Marie, however, had finally galvanized the council into action. The longwait was about to end.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>For their part, the Dillians, knowing nothing of this, waited to see what thedisreputable clinic might have done to poor Alowi.</p>
<p>The answer, at least from their point of view, seemed to be nothing more thanwhat had been claimed. Alowi seemed more content with herself and more confidentand no longer seemed troubled by runaway inner drives.</p>
<p>No one, of course, was more nervous about this than Alowi herself. Becoming aguinea pig possibly at the hands of one's enemy was an act of desperation butreasoned action nonetheless.</p>
<p>At first she simply felt, well, normal, and for a while that was enough. Thoseinner urges, those bouts of losing control, of nearly sick cravings, seemed tovanish while leaving little in their place. This was not, of course, normal toan Erdomese, but it seemed normal in almost any other context. She felt, well,much like Tony and Anne Marie seemed to feel, or Mavra. She was simply herself,but in complete control, not needing anything just to remain sane. Free. Free to study, free to learn, free of any thought of returning to Erdom. Yet when she looked at herself in the mirror, she liked what she saw. Ifanything, she liked it more than she had, felt more comfortable about the personwho stared back at her. Although those urges and emotions had at times beenoverwhelming and omnipresent for what had seemed forever, it now was difficult,even impossible, to remember what that had felt like. She felt every bit afemale, no less than before; certainly she didn't feel sexless or frigid or an"it." And yet, well, those things she'd gathered around or made or picked up inthe markets that were so obviously phallic now seemed pretty silly. She wasn'tquite sure just what sort of change other than allowing her independence thedoctors had wrought, but if this was the extent of it, well, it was somethingshe could surely live with and might have died without.</p>
<p>Tony came back from the city with what she hoped was an answer to Anne Marie'sreport of only a few days before. Anne Marie, at least, was excited. "This isthe first time they ever sent a reply to one of our reports! And so quickly,too! Perhaps they've found something out! Play it!"</p>
<p>Tony removed the cube and pressed her thumb firmly on the one side that had aninlaid red surface. The cube took a few cells of skin, compared them with thegenetic code it carried, seemed satisfied, then said in a voice that camethrough as a soft and pleasant woman's voice, "Please do not play the rest ofthis inside your home. Take it to an open area well away from any others,particularly natives, and repeat the process. The cube contains a small zonalscrambling device that will cover an area about three meters square, so be closeto it. The message will play only once, erasing itself as it plays, so pay closeattention. When done, burn the cube in any open fire. The message will now pauseuntil you take these precautions, and you will not hear this preamble again." "My goodness!" Anne Marie exclaimed. "Sounds rather serious, doesn't it?" "It certainly sounds as if something, at least, is going to happen," Tonyagreed. "Let's take the precautions and go down to the jetty and see what theyhave to say." She paused a moment and had a puzzled look. "I wonder why thatmany precautions. Surely they do not think that even this tent is bugged-couldthey? I mean, who would bug us?"</p>
<p>"Someone who is certainly near death from boredom," Anne Marie responded."Still, let's do this cloak and dagger business by the rules, dear." They all left the tent and went down perhaps two hundred meters to the jetty,where the gentle ocean water, softened by far-off undersea reefs, lapped againstthe sides. It was a nice, bright day, warmer than usual and with a gentle wind.There was nobody else around close enough to observe them. The three gatheredclose, and Tony took out the cube and pressed again on the red area. "This is Ambassador Aliva speaking for the Special Committee," said the femalevoice in Dillian, which the two centauresses understood directly and made anextra authenticity check possible as well. "We have evaluated our report on thisclinic and its specialists, which coincides with intelligence from othersources, and we believe that you have stumbled on the key to the disappearancesand also to why action is now mandated. As a result, we have arranged for anAgonite whose character is beyond question and who has both knowledge andauthority in combating this criminal syndicate to assume command of a specialunit that will follow up this lead.</p>
<p>"His name is Janwah Kurdon, and he is an officer in the Agonese Secret Police.Please do not be put off by this; Kurdon has been in something like an exilesince mounting a campaign against the syndicate and being blocked by corrupthigher-ups. We have arranged for his restoration of rank and position, and it isunderstood that any Agonite official who gets in the way of the special unitwill be placed under suspicion by the Zone Council of aiding and abettinginterhex criminal activities. It is very likely that they will do their best tostay out of your way to avoid even the slightest hint of corruption, but it isinevitable that they will use their own people to try to anticipate your actionsand report them to the criminal gang. Agon itself has become too industrializedto be self-sufficient in food; it is also clearly understood that anything lessthan government cooperation could mean a blockade and embargo. We have alreadynotified the government of this and have heard the protests, but we have thevotes here on our side."</p>
<p>"Goodness!" Anne Marie said. "They can certainly knock heads if they decide theywant to!"</p>
<p>"You may, if you wish, become part of this special unit, but understand that thepersonal danger is very great, that this cartel is totally ruthless, and thatwhile we can act against officials and the nation if need be, we cannot protectyou individually. Also, you must accept Agent Kurdon's complete authority andact only under his orders. Otherwise, you will have to leave the country andreturn home or go elsewhere. You may also not travel to Liliblod or Cloptawithout being under the unit's authority; the former does not consider what thegang does a criminal act and operates under a different and not altogetherscrutable logic, while the latter is at least as corrupt as the government ofAgon and far less competent. As we cannot protect you and as you must suspectKurdon is less than excited about being saddled with those he considers bothaliens and amateurs, nothing will reflect on you if you choose not to continue,and you will be informed of any results. However, if you do accept the terms,complete what business you might have yet to do and meet the special unit inSubar, the northern city where you first made contact with us, in precisely fourdays. Go to the Central Prefecture there and simply ask for Agent Kurdon. Hewill then brief you on what will be happening next."</p>
<p>"One more thing," the message concluded. "Do not return to that clinic orcontact the staff there again even if something is scheduled or they call andask to see any of you. Make any excuse, but do not go. Operations are alreadyunder way as regards them that you might only jeopardize or, worse, alert thestaff about. For the record, the cover story is that we believe geneticreengineering is being employed to possibly replace or enslave existingofficials or whole populations and we are going after the proof of that. Underno circumstances is anyone, least of all the gang, to suspect that we are aftermore than that. We have also planted information that your two missing comradeshave vital information for the council and that if they are located, in anyform, and the reengineering stopped, we will not act further against theorganization. We can only hope that this will buy them their lives, or at leastenough time to locate them.</p>
<p>"May the blessings of all the gods be with you in this endeavor. This message isat an end. Please bum this cube and do not attempt a replay. The message in itis already gone, but another attempt will produce nasty consequences. Farewell." "I'm not sure I liked the last of that," Tony commented. "It really sounded likea rather formal kiss-off. Like she never really expected to hear from us again." "Well, we will just have to surprise her, won't we, dear?" Anne Marie responded,then looked over at Alowi. "Well! Why so glum? This is what you wanted, isn'tit?"</p>
<p>Alowi nodded, but slowly and hesitantly. This was what she'd wanted all along,of course. So why did she feel so little like following up on it? Lori, after all, had saved her life at the start of all this and for a very longtime had been her only friend.</p>
<p>"I am glad something is happening, of course," she answered lamely, "but, well,I am just concerned. Concerned about what we might find, where this is allleading. I will be all right."</p>
<p>But it was more than that. After the Dillians began their preparations to shutdown their trade operation, leaving her to begin the packing-up process, shetried to put her finger on it. She really did know at least a part of herproblem, and it was tough trying to get around that. Lori wasn't just a friend,he was her husband, and the last thing she wanted right now was a husband, nowor ever again. Memories of long conversations, the sharing of intimacy down toher very soul with him, now seemed distant and colored with an unpleasant veneerthat seemed somehow impossible to remove.</p>
<p>She certainly wanted Lori liberated, but their relationship couldn't be like ithad been even if by some miracle he was unchanged or could be restored to hisprevious form. Particularly not in that case… A whole litany of things thathad attracted her and turned her on to him in the past now seemed in retrospectto be the opposite. Even his personality, mannerisms, the way he interacted withher and with others seemed distant, alien at best, and in some ways downrightrepugnant to her.</p>
<p>Finding him a malformed invalid seemed at least less threatening to her, and shefelt awful for thinking that thought. Even so, she felt no duty toward him, noreal attraction at all.</p>
<p>She had been happiest right here, with Tony and Anne Marie, free to explore herown potential without any feelings of repression or any demands she didn't like.Tony and Anne Marie had remained for her sake, and she loved them for it, andwhile she knew deep down that this arrangement could never be permanent, shedidn't want it to end.</p>
<p>One had to have been on both sides of the sexual boundary to know just howdefining the roles were, how they shaped and misshaped people. Seen from Alowi'sperspective, she hated, despised Julian Beard. He'd been swaggering, loutish,and self-centered to a fault, committed to his own goals but seeing nocommitment toward others-it was no wonder he couldn't stay married to anybody.Yet she saw the essence of all that was wrong in him in just about every maleshe'd met or could think of, regardless of race. It was almost as if everyquality she valued seemed lacking in every male yet present in the vast majorityof females. Lord-Lori by the end had been no more a former woman than Alowi hadbeen a former man. Instead he'd become more and more like… Julian Beard. Here, during this period, she'd also discovered something else. She likedherself now. First she had struggled to expunge all that was Julian from insideher, then she'd become someone else, a creature with no ego or sense ofself-worth unless it was defined by what she could do for Lori. That creature,too, was gone, and for the first time she was an individual again with thequalities and capabilities she desired. She didn't want to be anyone else. Herethe heavy weights placed upon her by her past and by the Well World and Erdomeseculture and biology had been lifted, revealing a real person. Now it seemed asif some of that weight was being forced back upon her, and there was nobody elsewho could understand her problem.</p>
<p>It had to be done, of course, but it seemed as if freeing Lori was the worstthing that could happen to her.</p>
<p>If everyone elsewhere noted that the Dillians were genetic twins, it was harderfor them to tell one Agonite from another. That meant that the creature whoshowed up at the police station in Subar where they'd been instructed to checkin looked very much like all the other natives, except that he wore a yellowsleeveless shirt and a pair of baggy denimlike trousers. It was clear from thereaction of the police in the station, though, that he was far more importantthan he looked.</p>
<p>"My name is Chief Inspector Janwah Kurdon," the newcomer told them, "of internalsecurity."</p>
<p>"We are-" Anne Marie started, but the newcomer waved her off.</p>
<p>"I know who you are. I know who all three of you are and how you came to behere. What I don't know is why you are here in Agon or still anywhere in thisregion. After all this time, I'd think that you would have grown weary and be onyour way home by now."</p>
<p>Anne Marie gestured toward a sullen Alowi. "She has lost her husband. In herculture that is about as close to being killed as you can get. Her honor demandsthat she find him or, for her, life would not be worth living. Since she's aloneand friendless and because we don't like being pushed around and, yes, betrayedourselves, we've remained with her."</p>
<p>Alowi said nothing. She didn't want to disillusion the Dillians or make themfeel as if they'd wasted their time for nothing, and frankly, she'd taken aninstant dislike to this chunky little reptile.</p>
<p>The secret policeman sighed. "So what did you think you could do?" "Us? Probably not much. Not without a great deal of help, anyway. On the otherhand, we must do something. Even if we fail, we can't simply let this go. Surelyyou understand that."</p>
<p>"I understand that you were stuck in a strange country with no resources and youactually thought you could find and take on one of the most powerful criminalorganizations in the history of the Well World," Kurdon replied. "Amateurs," hesighed. "You realize, I hope, that these people will kill at the drop of a leafand that they can do things far worse than death."</p>
<p>"We more or less assumed that, yes," Tony put in. "We are not unfamiliar withsuch groups. They exist on our original native world as well." Kurdon glanced around. "Come. We will walk a bit together. It is a niceafternoon for the highlands."</p>
<p>They walked from the police station, one of the few buildings that was largeenough for the Dillians to comfortably enter, and out into the street, followingthe inspector. For a while he said little except to comment on the nice weatherand give a little inconsequential local history, but eventually they reached alarge public park. Some locals were there playing various games or sittingaround, but much of the area was empty in the predinner hour and the inspectorwas able to find a large area without trees or nearby people.</p>
<p>"I prefer to discuss other things in settings like this," he told them. "Ofcourse, we can still be spied upon, but it is much more difficult to do sowithout being obvious. Subar is a nice peaceful city, but it is also one of ourmost corrupt." He reached into his pocket and brought out a small conical devicethat seemed to have no features except a red tip, which he pushed. "This willkeep anyone from overhearing us by electronic means. Not totally foolproof butmore than adequate here, as I know from experience."</p>
<p>"I take it that we are in the midst of our enemies," Tony said nervously. "You are in their hometown, as it were, at least the homegrown sort. They livehere, work here, do many good and charitable works, and launder their cut of theillegal money through the banks here, which are among the richest and mostsuccessful in the nation. They used to be very good at what they do, but inrecent months they have become even more efficient and creative. We believe thatit is because another of your origin species has affiliated with them. Do youknow the name of Campos?"</p>
<p>Both Dillians nodded in unison. "Mavra Chang spoke of him. A vicious man, shesaid. Is that what this is about?"</p>
<p>"Man? Interesting…" The security man thought for a moment. "As to theother-yes, I believe that it is exactly what all this is about. In fact, itexplains much that was puzzling, particularly why both of your friends werekidnapped. Chang we could understand-there are reasons I believe you might beaware of why such an organization might like to get hold of her, although itseems they don't know just who or what they've got or they'd have done somethingwith her by now. It was the Erdomese that puzzled us. Now it becomes muchclearer. Not politics, not power in the sense that we'd originally thought.Revenge. Pure revenge. How typical of that type. Reassuring in a way, too." "How's that?"</p>
<p>"We have no particular drug problem here. Can you guess why that might be?" Tony saw his point at once. "Because they are protected here. The government andthe cartel have an agreement." Kurdon nodded. "Exactly. It is not official andis never mentioned, but it exists. Not everyone is involved, of course, but theyhave clever ways of getting around just about anything. Once, a year or so ago,I came very close to breaking some of the big shots involved in it. Theirlaboratories and most of their operation are run out of a vast headquarterscomplex not very far from here, along the border with Liliblod. I had everythingready to go and spread out for my superiors to approve. We would have gone inwith an army team and cleaned them out. Instead, I found my plans and papersconfiscated, my informants met quick and untimely deaths or simply vanished, andI was made division chief of the coastal watch unit in the southeastern city ofMagoor. Nobody said I'd done a poor job or that I wasn't right; technically thenew job was a promotion in pay and authority-but a shift away from all myprevious investigations and contacts. I wasn't stupid, and I knew the choice wasto accept or follow my informants. I am still a young man."</p>
<p>"Our message indicated as much," Anne Marie told him. "But I must say it doesn'tsound very encouraging."</p>
<p>"On the contrary. A few days ago I was called to the capital and told to standby. Much of my original paperwork mysteriously reappeared. Then, yesterday, Iwas promoted to chief inspector, given a great deal of power and authority,briefed on your situation, and told to form a special unit and proceed here.Some very important government ministers whose honor has not been for sale havebeen involved in the watch for these two alleged immortals that the council atZone has been most concerned about. They lost not one but both of them. Thenword comes that two creatures were taken off a courier boat by agents of thecartel just off the northwest coast, and the remainder of the party fits thedescription of three members traveling with the Chang woman. The three of youare rather difficult to mistake in this region. Everyone from the ministers tothe council was initially panicked that Chang had fallen into the hands of thebest organized criminal organization on the Well World. Then, formonths-nothing. The only logical conclusion was that the ones who had Chang hadno idea who or what they had and for some reason hadn't even bothered tointerrogate them in the manner that they have of extracting your closestsecrets. Why? The bottom line was that they felt any search or heavy pressurewould simply alert the still-ignorant criminals of the value of their captive.Now we know why. A revenge kidnapping probably arranged directly by Camposwithout any of the higher-ups even being aware of it."</p>
<p>"But surely someone would know!" Tony exclaimed. "Or at least notice!" "Not necessarily. You have no idea of the range and scope of their operations.It probably seemed quite routine for the people at the headquarters, and it isnot healthy to ask questions. Now, I ask you: If you were Campos, bent onrevenge and now having the means, and you had seen or heard of what servicesthese so-called physicians could and probably routinely perform for the gang,what would you do? Campos was once of the same race as your birth race. You tellme."</p>
<p>"Turn them into monsters. Unrecognizable, tortured, probably addicted," Tonysaid flatly.</p>
<p>"Why not just torture them to death? Wouldn't that satisfy?"</p>
<p>"I do not know this Campos, but I know his type," Tony told the agent. "He wouldnot want to just kill them, even painfully. If he had the means, he'd want tosee them in a continual torture, to spread his sadistic revenge out over a verylong time. They could be killed any time, but until then… no. He would wantto enjoy it."</p>
<p>"I thought as much," Kurdon said, nodding. "It is not common here, thankheavens, but it does occur. That is another reason why Campos got away with itso far. It is not a common attitude in Agon or Clopta; both races are far morepragmatic. They torture for information, kill when someone is in the way or no longer useful, but this sort of prolonged torture for personal gratificationisn't something they would think of doing. Risky and wasteful. We have foundthat your doctor friends were mostly using such creatures for experimentationand eventually doing away with them but that they did some pragmatic work aswell, primarily in converting creatures into couriers. I wondered why two womenwere targeted, since clearly only one was of interest to them if they suspectedher true nature, and now you have told me that what I suspected is true. It issomething I did not bother to suggest to those who are suddenly my friends." "Couriers?" Tony repeated. "Why turn people into couriers? Couldn't anybody dothat?"</p>
<p>"Not this type. They are designed-reengineered as couriers, dedicated to thatspecific task, while being physically limited from doing much else. Essentiallypack animals smart enough to be autonomous yet limited enough that they hadnowhere else to go and nothing else they could do."</p>
<p>"You know what they've been doing, then!" Anne Marie said excitedly. "We do now. Thanks to you, we were able to wage a clandestine operation in theirclinic and tap into their computer banks. Very difficult to break their codes,but Zone has capabilities beyond anything else on the Well World. We found theentire genetic codes of many individuals from a number of races in there, but wefound only one male Erdomese and one female Glathrielian in the memory banks. Itwould take a very long time, however, to match up precisely the original and thechanged structure and get a true picture of just what they became. The work isextremely advanced and, I must say, extremely frightening. Frightening enoughthat this alone has outweighed any loyalty to, and even much of the fear of, theorganization in Agon by high officials. This explains my free hand." "What do you propose to do?" Anne Marie asked him. "I have a clear directive.This Chang is to be found, arrested, and brought to Zone no matter what hershape or form or condition. I may use whatever resources I require to get thisdone, step on any toes, go through any barriers. When I suggested that thismight require going straight through the cartel's headquarters, they did noteven flinch. To not do it ourselves would at this point almost certainly mean itbeing done in spite of us, with Agon the object of an invading army of otherraces. There is already a council military man in the south setting up thispossibility. I find myself, therefore, with a very strong hand. Our objectivesare not quite the same. If we can recover both, well and good, but it should beunderstood that Chang is my objective."</p>
<p>"Our first objective is to recover Lori for this poor dear's sake. We've beenthrough a lot together already," Anne Marie told him. "As for Mavra, well, Idon't see any other choice for us or for her. She is quite a capable individual,and if she must deal with the council, so be it."</p>
<p>"Agreed. Most pragmatic and satisfactory, actually. You should be aware, though,that they are both unlikely to be anything like you remember them, and it isentirely unclear whether anything can be done for them."</p>
<p>Anne Marie sighed and looked at Alowi, who seemed still curiously ambivalentabout all this, then turned back to Kurdon.</p>
<p>"Somehow I do not think that will stop Mavra Chang," she told the agent. "Not ifhalf her own stories are true. But…" She decided not to finish now. There wasno sense in panicking Alowi, at least not yet.</p>
<p>"When do you move?" Tony asked Kurdon.</p>
<p>"In a few days. I want more information from the local agents here before Ibegin. I do not underestimate this bunch."</p>
<p>"What about going directly for Campos?" Tony asked him. "I cannot imagine such atype not having the objects of revenge close by so he could lord it over them." "Campos is a Cloptan. Out of my jurisdiction. If we turn in a report linkingCampos and the kidnapping, it will be out of our hands immediately. Besides,there are dangers to the direct approach. The quarry could go underground in itsown home territory or even be killed in such an attempt, in which case we mightnever find those we really seek. Or our objectives could be destroyed in a finalact of vengeance before we can reach them. Remember, too, that they could beliterally anywhere, just as long as Campos can get to them. No, when I move onCloptans on Cloptan soil, I want it to be my party, fast and unexpected, butwith the full authority of the council. At the moment I have no idea whereCampos even is, except somewhere in the port city of Buckgrud, a high-techmetropolis with a population of more than a million. Think of this as well: Canyou honestly tell one Agonese from another aside from size, weight, andclothing? Honestly, now."</p>
<p>"Uh, um, not without great difficulty, I admit," Anne Marie managed. "So how do you expect to directly penetrate a criminal organization and pick outthe one correct Cloptan from the masses? You see? In the end we will requireCloptan help, but that will have to be very carefully done. I don't believe thatthey are even as honest as we are, and that is not going very far. I wouldprefer we deal with the Cloptans after we strike here. Trust me on this. This ismy territory and my profession. It will be difficult enough having to somewhatinvolve Liliblod. Nobody can really deal with them, and they will not like thisat all."</p>
<p>"It seemed a nice, quiet peaceful place when we went through," Anne Marie noted."Yet we keep getting horrid warnings about it."</p>
<p>"Yes. By the terms of their agreements, the roads are kept absolutely safe fortravel. They are not without their own odd vices, and so some commerce ispermitted as a concession to their own needs. But they are not-rational-in thesense that we are here. They have a rather egocentric view of the universe andare quite unpredictable beyond certain bounds. The organization pays them wellfor protection in a sort of currency that they could not legally acquire, andthey will not like to see that cut off."</p>
<p>"Another corrupt government?" Tony sighed.</p>
<p>"You misunderstand. The Liliblodians believe that all other races were put hereas their prey. By-consuming- others or, more accurately, the fluids of others,they believe they gather in inferior souls and all the strengths of the prey.The cartel pays them in two ways. It provides live prey for them of the typethey love-alien flesh, as it were-and the one other substance which is their owndrug weakness."</p>
<p>"Disgusting," Anne Marie commented. "Eating live beings for pleasure…" "Yes, it is almost as bad as their own drug of choice. You cannot imagineanything more bizarre than seeing a mass of Liliblodians literally rolling in achocolate stupor…"</p>

<p>THE MASTER COMPUTER THAT WAS THE HEART OF THE ENTIRE planet called the WellWorld was just a machine; its powers were far too vast to have ever trustedmaking it self-aware in the sense that it could act outside its makers'predetermined instructions. And while it was true that machines had infinitepatience, they could also have very little if something required was not gettingdone. Now, as the Kraang continued its assaults and made tiny slivers of inroadsinto the system, it calculated that the time to solve this problem was no longerinconsequential. In that sense the Well could be said to have become impatientwith the progress of events, and when the Well wanted something, it tended to beless than subtle about it.</p>
<p>To summon the two Watchers to see to repairs, it had sent huge meteors crashinginto the planet where the Watchers were living. Extricating Mavra Chang so thatshe had any reasonable chance of success appeared to be very difficult and wouldrequire a great deal of subtlety and patience. Going after Nathan Brazil, on theother hand, would not. The fact that Brazil had willingly taken himself out ofworldly care was to the Well entirely irrelevant.</p>
<p>Nathan Brazil had been on the Well World for over eleven months, having come inwith Tony and Anne Marie. It had been almost seven months since Theresa "Terry"Perez had come through on her own, following Mavra, Lori, Gus, and Juan Camposby a mere hour or so and quickly coming under the influence of the bizarreGlathrielian Way that the race that shared common ancestry with Terry's hadfollowed. Prepared by the Glathrielians, she had attached herself to Brazilwithin only a week, and they had been inseparable since. For four months theyhad been deliberately held up, stalled, far from the goal of the Well Avenue,and then for two weeks they had broken free and escaped across the sea, beenreunited with Gus, and then lost him again as they crashed on an undersea reefin a storm.</p>
<p>But on their tiny tropical volcanic island in the middle of a fairy-tale sea,Nathan Brazil and Terry had no concept of the passage of time or any cares orthoughts beyond sheer childish fun. The tropical rain forest on the windwardside of the island provided enough wild fruits and vegetables to feed them, andthe frequent but brief storms always provided a supply of fresh water. Brazilhad opened himself to the Glathrielian Way but not to the elders' master plan ofco-opting him as he entered the Well. There he had remained, happy and carefree,unaware of that nonhuman part of him, that deep alien nature that had thwartedthe elders' control.</p>
<p>The tropical sun had browned him almost as dark as Terry's natural color, andhis hair and beard were long and unkempt, giving him almost a wild man'sappearance. His bare feet were hard and callused, toughened from months ofvolcanic rock and soil; the day-to-day life of climbing for treetop delicaciesand over the craggy rocks had bulked out his muscles.</p>
<p>Terry had not been as active of late, for she'd developed a large, hard bellyand some considerable fat and felt unbalanced and odd, but she accepted it asthe way things were. Part of the Glathrielian Way was acceptance of whatever wasand dealing with it as best one could.</p>
<p>This proved difficult suddenly, though, when they were awakened one morning justat dawn by a series of severe tremors. The ground shook, and trees swayed, androcks fell from the high mountain. This went on for a day or more, and suddenlya huge piece of the mountain about halfway up the side seemed to collapse,opening a gaping wound from which belched forth steam and black ash. Thenbeginning what seemed a wondrous light show, a volcanic fountain played againstthe sky. But the earthquakes continued in increasing frequency and intensity,and from the masses of grainy rock laid down by the fountain there came puffsand plumes of smoke and ash that set part of the forest on fire. They made their way around to the beach on the opposite side of the mountainfrom the eruption, having to stop or risk falling down with each tremor.Something inside them knew that they had to leave this place, and quickly. Butleave for where? And how? There was nothing on all sides but the water. There were other islands, of course, some of which could be seen across theexpanse of sea, but they were not as close as they appeared. None would be aproblem to reach with a boat or a raft, but they had nothing but themselves. Aninner sense of urgency told them that there was little time to consider anyalternatives. Reluctantly, they entered the water and made their way out pastthe reefs, Brazil using his strength to support Terry and keep her afloat. They made it to perhaps a kilometer from the beach and found themselves suddenlycarried along on a warm current, able to pretty much just float and let thewater do the work, which was more than welcome. The current carried them at asteady pace away from the erupting island and toward the calmer ones beyond. Then a sudden, tremendous explosion hit them like something solid, deafeningthem both, and they could see the onrushing wall of water from where the island,now a vast and dark mushroom-shaped cloud, had been, a huge tidal wave comingstraight for them. It was taller than the tallest trees and with a roar thatsounded like thousands of caged beasts roaring at once, and they stoppedswimming and watched it come, knowing it was death.</p>
<p>When it struck, their world became all water and whirling forces and thenoblivion.</p>
<p>The Well had issued its wake-up call to Nathan Brazil.</p>
<p>The island exploding, the rushing wall of water, then… What? She awoke as if from some strange dream, much of which had been very nice yetonly dimly remembered, like some great childhood treat now far in the past andunrecoverable.</p>
<p>But watch that last step, she thought. It's a dilly.</p>
<p>She sat up painfully, groaning and stretching. She felt as if she'd been beatento a pulp by some gigantic fist, but just as everything seemed bruised, nothingseemed broken.</p>
<p>The beach was warm and wet. It was made of yellow sand, the kind built up fromthe discards of coral reefs over thousands upon thousands of years, but it wassoft and somewhat comfortable.</p>
<p>She shook her head, trying to clear it, trying to think. She remembered atremendous bang and a big wave but nothing afterward.</p>
<p>And nothing before.</p>
<p>It was as if she'd just suddenly come into existence here on this beach. A bigbang and here she was.</p>
<p>It was quite dark, but out in the water she could see a million lightsunderneath the gentle waves, burning with a multitude of colors and shapes andpatterns that she knew couldn't be anything from nature, although she didn'tknow how she knew. And on the water, too, in the distance, things seemed tofloat, lights up upon the water rather than deep below it.</p>
<p>Boats, she understood at once, although again she had no idea where thisinformation was coming from.</p>
<p>I've lost my memory, she realized. Something, some accident or shipwreck orsomething like that caused me to lose my memory. She had no idea who. or where,or even what she was.</p>
<p>She ran her hands over her body in the dark. It was a woman's body. It wasn'tthat this was wrong so much as basic information about herself that she had hadno sense of before. Somehow, she hadn't seen herself as a woman, and there was asense of wrongness about it somewhere deep inside her.</p>
<p>She knew so many things! There were all sorts of facts and behaviors and otherpieces of information swirling around in her head, yet about herself she had noinformation at all. No past, no memories of actually being anywhere, doinganything, interacting with anything or anybody at all. I am a woman became thefirst, and so far only, definition of herself as an individual. It seemed to her that there had been Another somewhere, somebody very important.A girl… Another girl? That didn't seem right. But who and what? She cast about with her mind, never even considering speech, but there was noresponse from the immediate area. She was alone on the beach, without memory,without anything at all, in a place she couldn't remember for reasons that werea total mystery.</p>
<p>Perhaps… Perhaps out there, among the floating lights? She cast a mental netand caught far more than she expected. Thoughts… Lots of thoughts from whatseemed to be lots of different creatures. Their words, then- very sounds wouldmean nothing to her-she knew that-but thoughts were assembled from storedinformation into holographic concepts before they were translated as sounds, andthose she could pick up if she concentrated.</p>
<p>The power came naturally to her, although something inside said that it was anew thing, something she hadn't done before, yet something she had done before.That didn't make sense. Nothing really did.</p>
<p>It seemed somehow indecent to peek into their thoughts, to see who was tired,who was bored, and who was thinking of killing the captain. Indecent but kind offun, too. Some thoughts, though, were a lot harder to figure out than others;some of those creatures out there weren't even close to her form, and theirthinking wasn't much closer, either.</p>
<p>She cast about for others of her own land but found none. Wherever she was, shewas more than merely unique in her own psyche; she was one of a kind. No, that wasn't true. There were others. Something told her that. Men, women,children… But not here.</p>
<p>In the general casting about, though, she found spots where in fact not onlywords but complete sentences came through to her as if spoken in her nativetongue-whatever that was. But it took some mental fine-tuning until she couldfully understand those thoughts, kind of like tuning a radio.</p>
<p>Tuning a radio? Where had that come from? God! She sure knew a lot for somebodywho couldn't remember anything except what was discovered by direct examination. Maybe they knew. Maybe they were looking for her. If so, she'd better find outif it was in her best interest to want to be found.</p>
<p>"… Still getting reports from the Dlubinians that there is a great deal ofdamage and loss of life below…"</p>
<p>Those underwater lights. There were people of some kind who lived down there! Ifthat explosion that seemed to start her existence wasn't just some metaphysicalmemory, then… Oh, God!</p>
<p>"… No previous indication of volcanic activity in the area in any recentperiod, and it's monitored as closely as you can in a semitech hex…" Some of that made sense, some of it didn't. A volcano- that would account for.the explosion and the big rush of water that had followed. If she were anywherein that area, she would have been hit with tremendous shock. That had to be it.But it didn't explain anything else.</p>
<p>She listened for quite some time, gathering details of what had happened butclearing up her own personal mystery not one bit. Had she been on a boat, or onan island, or what? Not alone, surely. Not out here in this strange and alienplace. But if not alone, then with who? How? And why?</p>
<p>The aches and pains made it impossible to just sit there. She began massagingthe stiffness and found herself somehow mentally surveying her physicalcondition. Bruises, twists, all that, but nothing serious. As each region wassurveyed, she dampened down the pain there and went on. Only one area stymiedher, the area around her abdomen. It seemed odd, at once detached and yet notdetached, but certainly different. Well, it wasn't anything she could figure outnow. She was aware that she was using, almost matter-of-factly, powers that wereextremely unusual, powers that even she hadn't realized were there. But shethought nothing about using them.</p>
<p>She felt a strong urge to pee and then find something to eat and drink, if shedidn't have to wander too far in the darkness. She certainly hoped that therewas some sort of food and water on the island; otherwise a lot of choices wouldbe made for her right off.</p>
<p>Her body felt clumsy, unfamiliar, and it took some getting used to before shefelt confident enough to really try much. She wished it were light; there wasnothing but darkness beyond the beach and no way of telling what might bewaiting for her there.</p>
<p>Almost at once, unbidden by any conscious thought, the darkness was replaced byendless colors, all soft pastels with occasional flashes of brightness, andwithout a lot of difficulty she began to make out which were trees, which bushesor flowers. She intuitively understood that other colors represented livingthings great and small. It seemed magical, a counterpoint to the great lightsbeneath the waves in back of her, but after a while she realized it didn't help.This new form of vision didn't show rocks or fallen dead timber or otherhazards. Best to stay out of the jungle until she knew it better and was morecomfortable with the way her body moved.</p>
<p>Instead of going inland, she walked along the beach, not quite sure what, ifanything, she was looking for, but the terrain was at least manageable by thelight of the spectacularly bright starry sky. Here and there were great rocks-perhaps spewed by volcanoes, perhaps eaten away by the sea-and all sorts of woodand shells and coral washed up and deposited on the sandy shore. Walking closer,she thought she heard something, a gurgling sound, almost drowned out by thesound of nearby breakers. In a couple of minutes she found it-a tiny springcoming out of the rocks and jungle, cutting its way through the sand, andflowing into the great sea beyond. She got down on her knees, cupped her hands,and brought some to her lips. It was fresh! At least she would not die ofthirst! It was lukewarm, but she splashed some on her face to wash away the lastof the cobwebs that seemed to be lurking in her mind.</p>
<p>She drank her fill and got up unsteadily and went on down the beach, feeling alittle better. After a few minutes more the beach ended, tapering to a stoparound a fair-sized cove. There was a large rectangular box where the last ofthe sand vanished, clearly there to be accessible by land or sea, and she wentto it. It was the first artificial thing she could remember ever seeing. For amoment she hesitated to get close to it, let alone touch it. When everything wasan unknown, then everything was a potential threat, if not directly then becauseof her own ignorance of the world around her. It was such an odd feeling to havea lot of facts in her head but not be able to relate them to anything until shehad some logical reason to do so.</p>
<p>She realized on at least one level that this was the next step in definingherself. She'd exercised caution and stayed out of the forest not out of fearbut for very practical reasons. She was afraid of this box, though, just as shewas afraid of the boats out there and the creatures on them. Now she had todecide if she was going to let that fear rule her and hide out from everythingor if she had the guts to explore and discover new things. That really wasn't achoice; she did not like being alone and without any memories in a place she hadno knowledge of.</p>
<p>Cautiously, she approached the box until she stood right next to it, examiningit as much as she could in the starlight. It seemed featureless, colored somekind of bright yellow except for a bunch of marks in a dark shade etched intothe front of it. Those marks made sense to somebody-what was it? Writing. Yes,writing. But they might as well have been just marks to her.</p>
<p>She reached out hesitantly and touched it, then immediately pulled away as if itwere some burning hot fire. Nothing happened. Emboldened, she ran her hands overit and around it and found in the top a series of indentations with small marksinside each one. Touching one didn't seem to do anything, so she ran her fingeralong each in turn.</p>
<p>There was a sudden, terrifying woosh! from the box that so startled her, shefell over backward, then scrambled away on hands and knees, staring. The box lid rose up as if being opened by a giant hand until it was a bit morethan straight up; pulses of light began emanating from it, aimed toward the sea.As suddenly as it started, the flashing stopped and the light burned steadily.After perhaps a quarter of an hour of staring, waiting for some horror to climbout, she finally felt bold enough to go back carefully and see what she'd done.Curiosity was outweighing fear; if that light or whatever it was kept going,somebody would see it and come anyway, so she might as well check it out beforethey did. The box was a bit more than a meter high and deep and perhaps twometers long. Conscious for the first time that she wasn't very tall, she stoodon tiptoe and peered in.</p>
<p>It was full of more boxes.</p>
<p>Big boxes, little boxes, square boxes, long thin boxes- boxes and boxes. Shewondered if she could pull herself up and stand inside and whether it was a goodidea to do so. That lid might well come back down…</p>
<p>The inside of the lid itself was a long, very shiny surface with a bar of brightglittering lights along the top and both sides. The light was irritating, butthat shiny surface inside was very, very tempting. Angled just enough that itshowed no reflection of her head at ground level, it would certainly do so ifshe were at or near its height.</p>
<p>She looked back out at where the beacon was shining and scanned the area. Lotsof thoughts out there, as before, but no signs that anybody had yet seen, letalone was coming toward, this new beacon. Not yet.</p>
<p>She had to risk it. She just had to. She tried various ways of pulling herselfup and into the box, but while she'd get close, she just couldn't seem to manageit. After a few minutes of frustration she remembered the driftwood nearby andwent and carried some thick loglike pieces over to the box and stacked them oneat a time. She was winded after a while, but she managed to build herself enoughof an unsteady pile to get high enough to pull herself the rest of the way intothe box.</p>
<p>Standing on the smaller boxes in the center of the big one, she could seeherself from the thighs up in the smooth mirror of the lid's interior surface. Staring back at her was the unfamiliar face of a very young woman, perhaps nomore than midteens, with big brown eyes and finely wrought, attractive features,the hair thick and black and curly, making a frame around her face. The face didshow definite chubbiness, although it did not detract from her overall pleasinglooks. The weight also showed in large fatty breasts and in a fat ass andthighs, and there was a fair bulge of a tummy centered on the navel that didn'tseem as natural-looking as the rest of her and was clearly the cause for herfeeling ungainly when she walked. She stared and stared at the image in totalfascination as it was illuminated by the beacon lights around the lid. It was the face and body of a complete stranger. And yet it was her face, herbody without a doubt. Who are you, girl? she wondered. And how long will it bebefore I am no longer surprised to see you staring back at me? Reluctantly she tore herself away from the image and concentrated on the boxes.Most used the same system- one put a finger in some indentations one at a timein a line, and it hissed and opened. Clearly the seals weren't designed as locksbut rather to keep them from being opened and unsealed by accident, waitinguntil somebody needed them.</p>
<p>Some of the stuff inside the boxes was weird, some of it was bizarre, and someof it was downright disgusting. However, one box contained what smelled likecake, and in fact, it tasted like plain yellow cake; another held hard biscuits,and yet another had something that looked like a miniature loaf of baked breadbut turned out to have the taste and consistency of soda crackers. There wasalso, in one larger container over in the corner, a deep box that contained aliquid-one of the terms flying around in the back of her head leapt out at her:"beer." After the cakes and biscuits and crackers, she drank a fair amount ofit.</p>
<p>When she finished, she was feeling a little light-headed and had to pee again,and she realized she had to get out. Piling up boxes got her to the top, butturning around and getting down to the logs and from there to the sand provedchallenging.</p>
<p>She slipped and fell back, landing on her rear in the sand, but she wasn't hurtand the whole thing seemed somehow very funny. She tried to get up, but her bodyresponded even more awkwardly than usual, and she finally was forced to crawl onhands and knees. She finally made it perhaps twenty or thirty meters away, backonto the beach but up near the rocks and the start of the jungle. It was all shecould manage, and she picked a spot that seemed comfortable. She sank onto thesand and lay there, awake for quite a while but not thinking of anything at allexcept a vision reflected in a mirror by a glittering of light, of a face andbody that said, You don't know me, but I'm you.</p>
<p>And, for a little while, until sleep took her, it didn't make any difference.</p>
<p>It had been a typical Dlubine night; clear one minute, fast-moving thunderstormsthe next. In between the brief bursts of rain, fog and mist lay in patches all over the open sea, some natural, some the result of activity below the waves,lay where the people of the hex lived. For most of the evening visibility to thewest had been obscured by fog, but now it was lifting, dissipating as the firstsigns of false dawn came upon the ocean. A lookout on the patrol corvetteSwiftwind Thunderer spotted a flashing light through the thin mist and called itout to the watch. It was soon verified by other lookouts, and the watch officerlocated it on the chart. Then it was time to notify the captain. "Sir! Emergency beacon activated on Atoll J6433!"</p>
<p>Captain Haash, a Macphee, stirred from his sleep and opened his blowpipe,cursing semitech hexes and their limitations. "Probably nothing-those thingsmalfunction all the time on their own, and when there are earthquakes anderuptions… Still, might be survivors from a ship that got swamped. What's theweather like?"</p>
<p>"Squall moving in, sir. Looks to be one of those short but nasty types." "Hmph! How soon?"</p>
<p>'Ten, fifteen minutes, no more."</p>
<p>'Too short to make a run in and send in a shore party safely. How long tosunrise?"</p>
<p>"About forty minutes, sir."</p>
<p>"Well, we'll wait until full light and, when the storm clears, take her over andinvestigate. No use in getting banged up or beached. I'll be on the bridge bythen. Make to other ships that we'll handle the beacon so they don't have tobother."</p>
<p>"Very well."</p>
<p>The storm hit within minutes with the usual ferocity of small storms in the hex,but it was no volcanic eruption or tidal wave, and the crew was used to thiskind of weather by now.</p>
<p>While riding it out was routine, sleeping through it wasn't much of an option,and it wasn't long before the captain was pulling himself up through the bridgehatch. It wasn't easy to catch his mood at this moment, but then, it neverwas-unless one was another Macphee. His huge eyes always looked as if they wereabout to rip somebody apart, and beaked creatures always tended to have lessphysical expression, even those which didn't also look like a large squidcovered from enormous head to halfway down his tentacles with thick brown hair. "What's that banging I hear?" the captain demanded. "Not sure, sir," the materesponded. "We mink it might be debris and such from the explosion in the waterstriking the hull. We can put somebody over to check if you like." All thecutters had several air-breathing water species aboard for any such eventuality. "Absolutely not! I'll not have anybody brained by a tree checking to see ifwe're being struck by a tree! That hull is tough; it'll take a few dings." It was one of the reasons his crew would go almost anywhere with and for the oldman. He was as tough as they came in a fight, but he cared about every member ofhis crew. He'd willingly risk all their lives for good reason, but never fornothing. It was a bargain he had with them, he liked to tell other captains. TheMacphee might have resembled squids, but they were not aquatic creatures and thethick hair was not particularly coated. If he fell overboard and could findnothing to hold on to, that waterlogged fur would cause him to sink like astone. That meant that he had to always sail with a crew that would be anxiousto throw him a line just in case…</p>
<p>In a little over a half hour the storm was over, and the captain immediatelyordered the crew to check the condition of the ship and see what, if anything,was still in the water near them. Two Effiks, large green and yellow bandedinsectoids whose legs could stick to just about anything, went over the side anddown it, walking around the hull as easily as if they were walking on the deck.The one on the port side suddenly gave a yell. "Here it is! Big sucker of atree; looks almost like it got launched straight up, it's in such good shape!Hey! Wait a minute! There's something stuck in it! An animal, perhaps. Hey!Everybody here!"</p>
<p>There was a general rush to the port side, and two otterlike Akkokeks slid offinto the still-choppy seas and approached the big tree cautiously from bothsides. Seeing what might have been a leg or some other appendage sticking out ofthe still-green fronds near the former treetop, they turned upright in thewater, bouncing like corks, and hands carefully peeled away the greenery to geta look at the whole creature.</p>
<p>"Never saw anything like that before!" one exclaimed. "What the heck is that,anyway?"</p>
<p>"Looks like a sentient race," the other remarked. "Bipedal, hands with opposing thumbs… Definitely a male. My! That's so exposed! Let's see…" It carefullybegan poking and probing and was suddenly startled to see the jaw open, thenclose. "Woof! Reflex action, or… Hey! This thing might still be alive!" "Lower a stretcher on floats and send it out with Doc!" the captain ordered."Don't touch it until Doc gets there! If it's been stuck in a damned tree sincethe explosion, it's probably beat up all to hell. Don't want to do anythingthat'll kill it now, not after it came through all that!”</p>
<p>It took some time to get the float to the far end of the tree and for thebewildered medic, who had a lot of practice on dozens of races but knew nothingabout this one, to supervise extricating the body from the tree and moving it asgently as possible onto the flotation device.</p>
<p>'Take it easy!" Doc cautioned. The doctor, a birdlike Mosicranz, had littlestrength in the long, spindly arms beneath her white wings and had to supervisewithout directly manipulating the body. Once on board and in the clinic, shemight be able to do a bit more, since those same fragile limbs possessed anincredible delicacy in control, although she would have preferred to be in ahigh-tech hex where all the medical equipment that would easily answer herquestions would work.</p>
<p>"How should we lay it out, Doc?" one of the Akkokeks asked her. "How should I know? I'm going by deduction here. Flat on the back, I shouldthink, face up. Keep the legs together and the arms against the body. Damn!Whatever he is, he sure looks like he's been through the dominion of evil! Yes,that's good. Fine. Make sure the arms don't drop off or out and let's get himaboard as quickly as possible. I can see some respiration, although I look atthe rest of him and I can't understand why. I don't have to know anything at allabout his species to know that there's no rational reason in the world why heisn't deader than a stone!"</p>
<p>It took about ten minutes to get the new find aboard and below and another ten or fifteen minutes before the doctor came back up to the bridge. "There's very little I can do except lay him out and hope for the best," shetold the captain. "Anything I do may finish him-if he doesn't die beforehandanyway. There's been some loss of blood from all those gashes and tears,impossible to tell how much, and probably some broken bones, although I can'tsay without a full scan, which I can't do here. The gash in his head isparticularly deep and nasty, and there's some swelling in the skull. If we'regoing to try and save him, we have to get him into a high-tech facility, andfast. There is no such thing as fast enough."</p>
<p>The captain thought a moment. "We could make Mowry in less than an hour and ahalf. That would activate your onboard equipment."</p>
<p>"Yes, but it might not be nearly enough. I need data. What good is a full scanand examination if I don't know how much blood and fluid he needs or itscomposition? In order to fix him, I have to know his definition of 'normal.'That means a land hospital."</p>
<p>The captain thought a moment. "All right. The fact that we have a survivor whois of no race known in the region is worth a risk. If we get up full steam, Ican get us into Deslak in…" The mean-looking eyes went to the mate. "About three hours, sir," the mate responded.</p>
<p>"That be good enough?"</p>
<p>The doctor sighed. "It will have to do. He's likely to die before we get there,but the gods only know how he managed to live this long. Maybe his will to liveis so strong, he'll make it."</p>
<p>"Very well. Notify the company we are rushing an injured survivor to Agon andwill be off station for eight hours," the captain said to the bridge staff."Order the engine room to get up full steam and proceed to Deslak at flank speedas soon as practical."</p>
<p>"Aye, sir. Um-sir? What about the distress signal?"</p>
<p>The captain froze for a second. "Oh, yes. Totally forgot about that. Let methink… All right, head for them now. Do as quick a shore recon and pickup asyou can. If nobody's there, don't hunt for them, but if there is anothersurvivor there, they might even know who or what this fellow below is and whathe was doing out here. At the very least, they'd have to be taken in somewhere,anyway."</p>
<p>"Captain, I really think we ought to head for Deslak straight away," the doctorprotested.</p>
<p>The captain gave a clicking sound that was more or less the equivalent of asigh. "Doctor, I appreciate your concern, but he probably won't survive to getthere anyway, and if he does, he does. He's held out this long. Another halfhour to perhaps save somebody else probably isn't going to make a whole lot ofdifference."</p>
<p>On the beach, the girl had woken with the coming of dawn. With the morninglight, she had lost some of her fear and was beginning to wonder what to donext.</p>
<p>It was strange how clearly she could think and see things yet know so littleabout herself or much else. There were a lot of terms that meant nothing, a lotof concepts that seemed more confusing than clear, and absolutely nothing at allto anchor her own self upon. She did know that as far as she could tell from thethoughts she could intercept, she seemed to be the only one of her kind. The storm itself took her by surprise; she didn't run from it but rather wasfascinated by it. All that energy, all that sound and fury and noise and light,and all that rain.</p>
<p>The rain in particular fascinated her. Not that it fell in such great quantitiesbut that it seemed unable to quite touch her. It was like she had some kind ofsecond invisible skin that was keeping her and even her hair dry. She could feelit as a series of constant pulses against her skin, but it didn't penetrate.With a little effort she could see it, a thin and transparent layer of energythat gave off a vague lavender glow. She reached out her hands and cupped them,and the glow receded to the wrists, allowing the torrent to strike and quicklyoverfill her hands. The force of the rain and its weight startled her, and theglow quickly shot back around the hands once more.</p>
<p>They couldn't do that, those creatures out there. None of them could. She didn'tknow that as much as sense it through the mind's eyes of the unlucky sailors whohad to be on deck awash in wind and rain and crashing waves. It wasn't merelythat they didn't want to have it; they simply didn't. That was clear. So whoever and whatever she was, she had powers they did not. She was not,however, so naive as to think that those powers would give her more than aslight advantage over the rest in some situations. They could hurt her, evenkill her, if they wanted to do so.</p>
<p>That knowledge brought things right back to the start once again. What was sheto do? Run into the forest here, hope that there was enough to eat and live on,and remain here alone, one of a kind? That didn't seem very appealing. But whatwould those creatures out there do if they found her? Would they take her tomore of her own kind, or would they put her in a cage or, perhaps, eat her? Itwas impossible to get a handle on that because they really didn't know she washere and didn't seem to have any concept of her kind in their heads. It was lack of knowledge of the world out there that was so disturbing. Surelyshe must have a past. Those terms which kept popping up in her mind now and thenhad to come from someplace. And yet, hard as she tried, there just was nothingthere. The only thing she knew for sure was that she was here and that somewhereout there there was another, one of her kind yet not like her. She knew this notfrom memory, though, but because there was some kind of link between them,something she felt. She tried reaching out through that link, but what she gotback was unintelligible, confusing, like a thick fog.</p>
<p>Yet, reaching out, there were a few such sensations she could decipher. Water… wetness, and something sharp and misshapen. Then something-somethings-grabbing, moving the other out of the water, up onto one of the boats… There was suddenly no choice on the course of action she had to take. One way orthe other she had to get on that boat. The other was the only link to anyexistence beyond what she now knew, the only other one of her own kind. For herown safety she could rely only on instinct and on the strange powers that cameunbidden. Basic logic just wouldn't work here; she didn't know the rules. Bestto go with feelings until she knew enough to make decisions on her own. They were coming for her now; the very boat on which the other had been takenwas approaching, apparently drawn by the lights she'd triggered. She left herhiding place and went down toward the big box to meet them.</p>

<p>THE COLONEL OOZED INTO HIS TEMPORARY HEADQUARTERS ON the patrol dock and formedan eyestalk to better focus on his surroundings. It looked quite empty. "Come! Come! Gus! I know you are here!" he said rather casually. When there wasno immediate response, his irritation was clear in his tone. "What would youlike me to do? Send off a report to Dahir that they should come and pick youup?"</p>
<p>"If you were gonna do that, you'da done it by now," responded a deep growl of avoice behind the Leeming.</p>
<p>"Ah! What a talent! If I only had such as you back home in Sao Paulo! Therewould have been no secret closed to us!"</p>
<p>"I was in the news business," Gus reminded him. "Maybe it's you who wouldn'thave had no secrets. All the stuff you did in them cells and damp basement roomswoulda been on the evening news. Now the only joy I have left in life is makingyou as paranoid as you probably made half of Sao Paulo."</p>
<p>"Ah, my friend! How many times do I have to remind you that my country was ademocracy?"</p>
<p>"Not in your version of the good old days," Gus responded. He didn't like thecolonel very much, and he knew the colonel didn't much care for him, either, butat the moment they needed each other. "Any news? We've been wallowin' here fortoo long now."</p>
<p>"There was a major volcanic eruption on one of the islands a couple of daysago."</p>
<p>"So? I understand that's pretty old stuff."</p>
<p>"Maybe. But it was in the very area we searched so long and so hard, my friend.On the very island where you were convinced they had to have been." Gus was suddenly concerned. "That one? You think maybe they… 7' "Who knows? If they are. it is the end of this part of the problem since thisBrazil person would obviously not be an immortal and would certainly not be theman with the keys to the Well, now, would he? But if he is, and many people dobelieve he is, then, my friend, either he was not there or he would escape, no?" "But Terry-the girl! She's no immortal!"</p>
<p>"That is true, and I understand your concern. She was a friend. Perhaps shelives, perhaps not. What would you do if you found her? Found her separated fromthe captain, I mean? I have heard of some odd couples in my time, but this is abit much, I think."</p>
<p>"It's not like that! It wasn't sexual. It was different than that." "Indeed? And which planet are you from? I know where I was born and where I amnow. Or perhaps you are a throwback to the days of romance and chivalry, toPlatonic love and honor and duty and all that? Or were you honorably married andreligiously faithful? Or perhaps it was she who was married?"</p>
<p>"No, she wasn't married, and neither was I."</p>
<p>"I can see why not! You might as well be a monk. Or did you perhaps not findwomen sexually attractive?"</p>
<p>"I wasn't gay, if that's what you mean, and I wasn't no monk, neither. If youwant to know, I didn't want to make it with her because I thought it would spoilthings. She was the closest thing I had to a best friend. We had what they callmutual respect, and she sure as hell had guts. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe we wereboth married. Not to other people but to the job, to the lifestyle. There wasn'tnothin' neither of us wanted to do with our lives than what we was doin'. Bothof us. If either of us had been willin' to stop, I guess it mighta worked, butwe was two of a kind, you might say. I guess you could say we shared the samelover, if you want to make it like that. No use beatin' this horse anymore. Ifyou don't get it now, I could never make you understand it."</p>
<p>'To each his own," the colonel responded. "I think perhaps that things are notso different here as they seem. Only back on Earth we all looked pretty much thesame, so we thought of ourselves as one when really, our cultures and natureswere as alien as, well, a Dahir and a Leeming. And perhaps, too, we change lesshere than we think we do, eh?" The colonel sighed. "Well, that is neither herenor there. The question is. What do we do next? Do we go back out and see if wecan find anything in the aftermath of this, or do we wait and see what getspicked up?"</p>
<p>"I'm for going back out," Gus replied without hesitation. "If either or bothsurvived, then things got really stirred up, didn't they? It might have spooked'em-and remember, they got the knack like me. If they don't want to be seen, youcan't see 'em. You can't, but 7 can." And that was precisely why the colonelneeded Gus. For his part, though, Gus did not underestimate the colonel, who hadmanaged to accumulate a whole hell of a lot of authority and rank, which impliedtrust, in a very short time on the Well World. That kind of man was dangerous inand of himself, but even more so when it was not at all clear to whom the mangave his loyalty.</p>
<p>The colonel considered Gus's response, then said, "I think perhaps you areright, my friend. If I'd had a boat at my disposal, we would have left at thefirst reports, but they have a veritable armada out there, from patrol boats toscientific teams, and that left them thin in other areas.</p>
<p>There's one due in for refueling and reprovisioning this afternoon, though. Ithink when it sails, you and I should be on it."</p>
<p>The colonel's question had bothered Gus more than he let on. What was he goingto do if he found Terry? What sort of future did he have in mind, particularlyconsidering the state she'd been in when he'd found her? Her only hope was thecaptain, and while he seemed like a decent enough guy, he didn't seem to be allthere in a number of ways. In a sense, his only real hope was the captain, too,since he sure couldn't go back to Dahir and didn't see much of a future anywhereelse. In point of fact, until things had stalled, this business had been themost fun he'd had since he had arrived in this strange place.</p>
<p>They'd probably let Terry go. She wasn't much good to anybody, but she wasn'tvery good company as it was, either. But Brazil-that was a different story. Atbest, they'd lock him up and try to get enough guts to trust him on any deal hemight make, or they'd march him into that whatever it was up north with gunspointing at his head. Not a good condition for granting favors, although Brazilalways seemed confident that if he got in there, he could handle anything. Still, old Gus wasn't one of the folks likely to be invited to the party, andBrazil would have a lot more on his mind than his brief acquaintance andshipmate.</p>
<p>Damn! he thought. Kinda like The Wizard of Oz, only you got to steal the wizardand carry him off, too. Yeah, and when they'd gotten to the wizard, he'd provedto be a fake, anyway. Wouldn't that take the cake! All this crap and you getBrazil inside and he's just another con man. Hell, the captain had evendescribed himself as a con artist! Seemed damned proud of it, although where hadit gotten him up to now?</p>
<p>As always, he'd have to just wing it. At least those two somehow had learned thesame knack for not being noticed that was built into the Danir; they might bepretty damned hard to keep locked up. That was something of an advantage,although, as the colonel said, it wouldn't take forever to get somebody elsehere, somebody native, who could see through the trick.</p>
<p>"Ship off the port bow!" the lookout cried. "Coming landward and at full speed!Looks like one of ours!"</p>
<p>"Make to approaching craft by signal lantern as soon as she's in range," theship's captain instructed. "Ask them for identification and the reason forcoming in. They might have some problems. Nobody was due in for another thirtyhours."</p>
<p>The semaphore lantern was soon clicking away, and after an interval during whichtime the approaching craft had covered a good deal of distance toward them, thesignalman read out the reply.</p>
<p>"Corvette Swiftwind Thunderer, carries two survivors, unknown species, one incritical condition."</p>
<p>The colonel snapped to. "It's them! I know it is them! Captain, tell them toapproach and lay to next to us. My companion and I are going to board that shipand ride it back in."</p>
<p>"Might not be who you're looking for." the officer pointed out. "It is. I will chance it anyway. Just give the order before they get so closethat they pass us." He paused a moment, then called, "Gus? You hear?" "I heard. Might as well see what they caught."</p>
<p>The two corvettes were nearly identical, and when alongside they secured to oneanother with grappling hooks and lines, close enough that a metallic plank couldbe laid between them.</p>
<p>Watching the colonel move fast when he wanted to was an education. While henormally seemed to just ooze across the floor or deck, his great translucentblob now seemed to shrink, and then an object the size of a basketball extrudedand fairly shot across the gangway. The rest of the body followed as if thewhole were a rubber band that had been stretched and now was released. It was abit harder for Gus, but his feet gave him a good grip on all but the smoothestsurfaces, and he was able to leap the last meter or two.</p>
<p>"I'm here," he told the colonel, who signaled for the two ships to disconnect. Captain Haash oozed down from the wheelhouse himself as soon as they were againunder way. "What the blazes is all this about? And who are you?" he demanded toknow. "I am Colonel Lunderman of the Royal Leeming Forces, currently assigned toSouth Zone Council duty. My orders and authority are at the patrol base atDeslak, if you have any doubts."</p>
<p>Haash thought a moment. "Well, I doubt if you'd be on old Shibahld's ship unlessyou were who you said. Still, can't say as I can figure out if you're comin' orgoin'."</p>
<p>"Neither, Captain. I was headed out for another search for certain creatureswanted by the council. I am looking for two Glathrielians, and you have twounknowns from the right region. Am I correct?"</p>
<p>"Glathrielians? Never heard of 'em. So that's what they are!"</p>
<p>"Perhaps. If we can just see them? That is the only way to make sure." "Sure. No problem. 'We,' you say? More'n one of you in that blob?" "He is referring to me, Captain," Gus put in. Haash proved that a Macphee couldmove even faster than a Leeming-and up a bulkhead, too. Then the huge headpeered back over, and two enormous but very human-looking eyes peered down."Don't do that to somebody like me! Don't ever do that again! I'm likely to takeyour head off!"</p>
<p>Gus decided that it was the better part of discretion not to point out that thecaptain's reaction had been not to fight but to flee. After all, it was hisship. "Sorry. Can't help it. A defense mechanism that's just built in. Icouldn't turn it off if I tried. You haven't noticed this sort of thing witheither of your survivors?" Gus was beginning to worry that they'd just blown iton a wild-goose chase.</p>
<p>"No! And from the looks of things it's gonna be touch and go if one of 'em don'tdisappear into the grave."</p>
<p>The colonel felt impatient. "May we just see them. Captain?"</p>
<p>"Infirmary below. At least the one that's wracked up is there. The other oneroams all over the place but generally stays out of the way. Anybody can pointyou the way."</p>
<p>As they went below, led by a crewman, Gus wasn't at all sure that he wanted itto be they. If it was Terry who was down there, near death… It was pretty clear, though, in the small infirmary that they hadn't wasted anytime at all and that Gus's fears had not been realized, either. Hooked up to a forced breathing apparatus and submerged in a fluid tank that atleast insulated the injured man from the effects of the sea was clearly abattered, bruised, and cut Nathan Brazil.</p>
<p>"Jeez! He looks awful!” Gus noted, examining the man through the plastic casing."What the hell did they do to him?"</p>
<p>The colonel, too, stared at the man floating in the tank. "He's survived manyweeks, probably with very little, on a tropical atoll." he noted. "I doubt if hehad a comb, razor, or medical kit. However, note the scars."</p>
<p>"I'm trying not to," Gus responded.</p>
<p>"Be observant! The scar tissue is brown but of roughly the same uniform age,shade, and thickness. The bruises and black and blue areas also look to berather similar. This says that most of what, we see happened in a relativelyshort period of time. I think that Captain Brazil might very well have been onthat island when it exploded and was somehow blown away with the debris. Strange… He seems, well, so much smaller, more frail-looking than I remembered him. Isuppose, like many small men, his personality and energy are in inverseproportion to his real size and strength."</p>
<p>A Mosicranz, looking something like an anemic and sickly angel to Gus, althoughwith a more birdlike head, came into the room. "I am the doctor," she told them."I understand you know who and what this is."</p>
<p>"He is a Glathrielian," the colonel told her. "Not likely to be an extensiveentry in your medical books, I fear. They are generally a very closed andprimitive society and do not travel. This man was an exception to the rule." "I can believe the primitive part," the doctor responded. "The female seems tobe totally ignorant of the simplest things, almost like a little child." "She is not so badly hurt?" Gus asked anxiously. Predictably, the doctor startedbut recovered quickly. Clearly she'd seen that trick before.</p>
<p>"She's not hurt at all. She apparently made it to a nearby island with alifesaving chest and beacon and apparently triggered it by accident. That's theonly reason we knew she was there and picked her up. She seems very concernedabout the male-they were mated, perhaps?"</p>
<p>"In a way," Lunderman acknowledged. "Although I don't think it was necessarilymutual. This man is quite sophisticated about things, while the girl seems aboutas primitive as you can get."</p>
<p>"You knew them before, then?"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed. We both did," the colonel told her. "My companion goes back evenfurther with the girl."</p>
<p>"Is that so? Well, I'm afraid that might not count for much anymore," the doctortold them.</p>
<p>"Why? Something happen?" Gus asked. "You said she wasn't hurt!" "Not physically, no. But we Mosicranz are very good healers, sir, with our ownset of inborn attributes. I am mildly telepathic. Only surface thoughts, no deepprobes, but sufficient to read and respond. She, too, has this ability-to whatdepth I can't say, although it appears to be very similar to mine. When I sayshe is like a child, I mean that literally. She has no memories at all beforewaking up on that island. None. She doesn't know who she is, where she is, whatshe is, or how she got there. She is here only because she has a permanentconnection of some sort to the male and sensed that even on the island. It isimpossible to say where they were when the eruption took place, but I wouldthink it was quite close. They became separated in the water. She made it to theisland; he did not, struggling in the channel until he found a large treefloating there and managed to wrap himself in it. That is all deduction but isprobably correct. He was so badly injured that it's incredible he managed asmuch as he did. As for the female, there is no clear evidence of head trauma, soI can only suspect that the memory loss was due to either shock or internalconcussion when the thing blew-literally a shaking of the brain inside theskull. I should like to examine her more thoroughly when we get to a high-techport to see if there is any brain damage or internal hemorrhaging that I can'tnow detect."</p>
<p>"Huh? You mean she might really be hurt, after all?" Gus asked her. "Perhaps. I would have kept her here, but I had no knowledge of what she was, sosedation was out of the question. What dosage? Which drug? You see? And she'snot one to be kept lying down without forcible restraint."</p>
<p>"Where is she now?" Gus asked her.</p>
<p>"Somewhere aft and almost certainly topside. She doesn't like to be inside forlong. But don't expect too much from her. If she. is capable of vocalizedspeech, I haven't been able to get anything out of her."</p>
<p>"She is, but she may have forgotten how," the Dahir replied. "Still, I'll seewhat I can do. Maybe later you can act as a bridge for us and I'll see if I canstir up anything in her memories."</p>
<p>"That might be a very big help," the doctor agreed. Gus went out to find Terry,leaving the colonel with the doctor.</p>
<p>"So, Doctor, what is your best guess, and I realize that it is only that, onthis one?" he asked her.</p>
<p>"Frankly, I can't understand how he's still alive. Just looking at the externalinjuries, I can well imagine what is inside. If he lasts long enough, I hope tobe able to do as much for him as possible, but frankly, unless he can somehowheal himself of mortal wounds, I would be shocked if he lasts more than a matterof days."</p>
<p>The colonel thought for a moment, then said, "Perhaps he may surprise you,Doctor. In any event, if you wish to stick with him, I certainly have noobjections, but even in the terrible shape he is in, I will insist that fromthis moment there be a guard posted here or just outside and that he not bemoved or treated anywhere without a guard being present."</p>
<p>"That man is not going anywhere!" the doctor pronounced confidently. "Period!" "If he were on fire and we were watching him bum, I would not trust 'that man,'" the colonel told her. "You and your ship are going to be a little bit famous,I think, Doctor. You see, that man is Captain Nathan Brazil."</p>
<p>There was a long pause, and then the doctor asked, "Who?"</p>
<p>"Nathan Brazil. There's been an all wants and warrants out on him since he stolea sailing ship and vanished many weeks ago."</p>
<p>"I don't pay attention to that. I have enough trouble keeping up with themedical biology of the nine different races represented on this crew alone, letalone others I might have to patch up, regardless of tech level. It keeps mebusy."</p>
<p>The colonel was still a bit incredulous. "You have never heard the name before?" The doctor gave a mild shrug. "Well, seems to me that there's a name that soundssomething like that in ancient mythology, but I'm afraid I didn't pay muchattention to myths and legends."</p>
<p>A pseudopod oozed out and gestured toward the man in the tank. "Well, there liesa genuine mythological legend, Doctor. Nathan Brazil, the immortal who aloneremains to work the great Well World machine."</p>
<p>"You're joking, of course."</p>
<p>"Perhaps. Perhaps not. Let's just say that there is ample evidence that such aperson exists. Enough to satisfy the Zone Council that he exists, anyway. Andthis man, who came through the Well Gate from another world far from here, notfrom ancestral Glathriel, knew an awful lot about the Well World for one from acivilization still not really even into space."</p>
<p>The doctor stared at the man in the tank. "An ancient god? That one? Here?" "Wiser heads than we believe it. Certainly it will be a moot point if he dies,won't it? But if he doesn't… If he in fact makes a full and complete recovery… What then?"</p>
<p>"You kind of expect your ancient mythological deities to be, well, a bit larger,more imposing, to say the least."</p>
<p>The colonel chuckled. "Only if they want to be noticed, Doctor. Not when youwant to sneak in."</p>
<p>She hadn't entirely lost her fear, but she was much more relaxed now, convincedat least that she'd done the right thing by coming to the other, hurt though heclearly was. Everything on the boat was so interesting, so new. She understoodthat the crew members got a lot of amusement at her ignorance. Of course theywere sometimes not so amused, like when she'd just taken a piss on the deck, butshe didn't mind. A lot of it was too confusing to worry about, anyway. What didit matter if some had clothes and some didn't? What did it matter how one ate,or slept, or whatever?</p>
<p>And they kept going around and working all these things on the boat that didn'tmake a lot of sense. Some of them even did things that seemed silly on the faceof it, like washing the deck when they were on an ocean-when it got rough, thewaves washed it anyway. That was why she didn't understand why they got upsetwhen she peed on it. Either they or the waves washed it anyway, and it seemedlike she had to pee a lot.</p>
<p>They also had a lot of gadgets and gizmos that made no sense to her. They'dsometimes try to show her the simplest things, at least to them, and she'd try,too, really try, but she just couldn't figure out how to work them. She hadfinally managed to figure out how to open doors, but then they got mad when shekept practicing on every door on the boat. Doors seemed stupid, anyway. All theydid was block her way from one place to another. If they didn't have doors, theywouldn't have to bother opening them all the time, she reasoned. She couldn't figure out why the boat didn't sink, either. One threw something inthe water, it sank. Why didn't this big, heavy, ugly thing sink? It didn't makeany sense. Well, she didn't worry much about things she couldn't figure out.From observing and listening to the surface thoughts of the crew, she'd gottenthe idea that there were smart people who understood or could figure out mostanything, there were others who understood some things, and finally there weredumb people who just couldn't figure out things. Some of the crew members whomothers in the crew considered stupid didn't seem so stupid to her, but they alsodidn't seem to be sad or upset that they might be stupid. All of them thoughtshe was pretty stupid, even the ones the others thought were stupid, too, somaybe she was. She'd asked the nice doctor about that, and the doctor, who everybody said was the smartest one on the boat, had told her that people whotried their best and didn't worry about what they knew or didn't know werehappiest, and that seemed like good advice. She'd just try her best and learnwhat she could and not worry about the rest.</p>
<p>And then there was the other downstairs. It didn't look at all like her, but itlooked more like her than anybody else on board. The doctor said he was badlyhurt, something that she hadn't needed to be told. The doctor also said thatwhile he might wake up and get better, he probably wouldn't. It was funny, butthat news hadn't really affected her. There was just something inside that saidthat he'd be sick a long, long time but wouldn't die. That just meant that itwould be a real long time before he woke up and could tell her about herself, ifin fact he could and didn't have the same problem remembering things. She mightstick around until he got well, but she knew it would be very long, and whatcould somebody like her do just staying around? Of course, she didn't haveanything else to do or anywhere else to go.</p>
<p>She'd watched unobtrusively when the two boats had pulled up next to oneanother. It was kind of neat how they could do that. They probably had to be really smart to do something like that without crashing. The two new peoplewho'd come aboard had gone below, and she hadn't found out much about them yet,but maybe she would. She didn't really like the big blob thing; she couldn't saywhy. The other one almost seemed like, well, like somebody like her, but thatwas silly.</p>
<p>Gus found her on the afterdeck, just sitting there and seemingly oblivious tothe world. Her hair was a tangled mess, but otherwise she seemed unmarked andremarkably the same.</p>
<p>'Terry?" he said gently to her. "You understand me? If you do, nod your head upand down."</p>
<p>Terry. He acted as if he knew her, but the name was unfamiliar. Well, she didn'thave one, so maybe that was as good as any. She nodded and felt his glow of joyat actually communicating with her.</p>
<p>"Do you know who I am?"</p>
<p>She looked blankly at the colorful dragonlike creature. Know him? Should she? "It's Gus, Terry. Gus. Do you remember me? Remember me at all? Even like this?Shake your head up and down for yes, back and forth for no, like this." Hedemonstrated as best he could.</p>
<p>She thought it looked funny but shook her head no.</p>
<p>"Well, I remember you," he told her, and in his head she could see a lot ofimages, memories, right at the surface, where she could look at them. Memoriesof her wearing stupid clothes and working all sorts of strange stuff and in awhole lot of places she'd never seen before. It was like being a character in astory. It was fascinating but bore no relationship to reality at all. The onlything it said to her was, I was smart once. That was good to know. Maybe shecould get smart again someday. The doctor had almost said as much, althoughwithout a lot of conviction that it would happen.</p>
<p>The visions of her doing incomprehensible things in settings totally unfamiliarsoon bored her, but something else was interesting, too. It was the creature'svision of himself at these places; he seemed to be of the same kind as she andthe other down below. A tall, thin man with a very pale skin and yellowish hair.It confused her. For some reason this person thought of himself as that otherone as well as what he was now. He couldn't be both, could he? It was all toomixed up. Like the rest, it was just something she wasn't smart enough to figureout, she guessed.</p>
<p>Still, she had an unmistakable feeling that the creature was important. Hewasn't trying to fool her or anything like that; in fact, he seemed to betotally open to her. He had known her before she had lost her memory, and hedefinitely had genuine affection for her from that period. The trouble was, shewasn't that person anymore, even if she wanted to be. It was as if that personwere gone, dead, and somebody new had set up shop in the old body, somebody notnearly as smart. She certainly would trust this Gus, but could Gus ever see heras who she was now and not as who she might have been in some past life? There was little more that either of them could say to one another beyond whathad been done. For Gus's part, he began to understand that Terry had changedagain, from the mysterious girl of great power to this very childlike creaturewho didn't even remember the second incarnation. This wasn't going to be easy,but at least now he had a little bit of purpose to his life. She sure neededsomebody right now, and he was the only one she had.</p>
<p>Glathrielians were in the medical references at all only because of the work ofsome Ambrezan physicians and anthropologists, but the information was about ascomplete on the physiological side as it was for most other races and certainlymore than adequate. In high-tech Agon, with a diagnostic computer set up andarmed with all those data, it was relatively easy to do a thorough checkup onboth patients.</p>
<p>"By all rights Brazil should be dead," the doctor told them. "In fact, aftergoing through these data, I'm almost.inclined to believe your stories about themythological god. Virtually every rib is either cracked or broken. One puncturedthe right lung and caused massive internal bleeding. Several of his organs arein horrible shape, too, and he has lesions in the brain in areas that might wellcontrol motor development. As far as I can see, he's been going on sheer will tolive. The aggregate of these injuries is enough to kill just about anythingcarbon-based, but in all cases there is something like a one in a million chancethat it might not be fatal. I swear that instant death versus horrible injurywas a matter of microns one way or another in a few instances. A surgical teamhas been on the case since he was brought in, and they're now working on him." "What you are saying is that he will survive," the colonel noted. "What I am saying is that he should not have survived and that there are verypoor odds that he will survive this massive level of surgery. Synthesizing thatquantity of blood alone was a monstrous job, and I have no doubt they will useall of it. If he does survive, well, there is no way to know what areas of thebrain are affected, but there will almost certainly be some serious problems. Inaddition, there is major damage to the spinal cord which is perhaps reparableover a very long time, when he can stand the additional work, and assuming thatit is similar to other spinal cord injuries in the races that have similartorsos. Then again, that is never an exact science. The odds are great that he'sgoing to remain in a coma, which will make him your ward and no longer ourproblem. If he does come out, then he will probably be unable to move much ofanything below the neck. They tell me that they can do nothing on the spinalcord injury at this time. They have to do the other repairs first, and it isbest if he cannot move anything down there, even involuntarily. The problem is,the longer the spinal cord is left untreated, the less likely it is to respondto treatment. I believe that at best, you will have a being who is totallybedridden and will never be able to move anything beyond his head again. That'sthe best estimate."</p>
<p>The colonel thought it over. "Oddly enough, if that were true, it might be avery convenient result. He could be questioned but would hardly be a threat. Onthe other hand, we have information that leads us to believe that he is capableof regeneration, perhaps total, over a long period of time. If he is the man ofthe legends, then that is what will happen, but it is still a result that mysuperiors will not find too terrible. It buys time, a lot of it, and no matterwhat, leaves him in our official custody."</p>
<p>The doctor shrugged. "Suit yourself. Sounds grotesque to me, but consideringthat he is still alive after all that, I begin to think that I can believeanything about him. What I cannot believe is that he is going to get up and walkout of here, or even crawl out of here, in the next year or two, if ever." "A year might be most satisfactory if one remaining complication can beresolved," the Leeming told her. "Unfortunate that he might remain comatose,though. If we cannot resolve our problem, we might have to deal with him muchquicker."</p>
<p>"You never can tell for sure, but I wouldn't bet on any conversations," thedoctor told him. "Whatever your complication is, you better resolve it." "What about the girl?" Gus asked her. "Did you run all the tests on her, too?" "We did. She's in remarkably good physical shape, all things considered.Mentally I'm not so sure. From what we were able to get from the Ambrezansthrough Zone, we have a theory but only a theory. That is one strange race therein Glathriel."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"We think she probably woke up in Ambreza near the border and, after seeing whatshe could only perceive as monsters, made a run into Glathriel. There they'vedeveloped some kind of deliberately primitive society that shuns all artifacts,machines, tools, whatever. That doesn't mean they are savages, though. Like someother races here, they went in the other direction, developing powers of themind, realizing what might be just a slight potential in most of them,developing and honing it."</p>
<p>"Back on Earth I've seen men walk barefoot over red hot coals and suspendthemselves on sharp nails," Gus told her. "And I've seen a lot of other strangestuff, too. Is that what you mean? They went strictly that way?" "Well, I think it's a lot deeper than those types of things, but you get theidea. Ambrezan anthropologists believe that the Glathrielians have developedsomething of a group mind, a sort of insectlike social and mental organizationwithout any hierarchy in which all of them are connected to one another. Theyconvert their body fat into energy that can be used for things far beyond merephysical work. I think you've seen examples of that in her." Gus nodded. The colonel gave a mock clearing of his nonexistent throat. "I believe I shallgo file my report. We have no interest in the girl, so I will leave her fateentirely in friend Gus's hands." And with that, the Leeming oozed out of thehospital lounge.</p>
<p>"You were saying they used fat to do things with their mind?" Gus prompted thedoctor.</p>
<p>"Yes. Fascinating, really. Still, it's only the background here. What is reallythe point is that she walked straight into a place where the people wereorganically the same as she was but mentally and socially were far more alien toher than physically different races. She had no foreknowledge and no defenses.They co-opted her into their mental net. She would have seen it as an offer offriendship, security in her most vulnerable moment. She didn't resist, almostcertainly expecting communication. She got far more. We think they literallyrewired her brain. Not organically but electrically. The memories were stillthere, but they were no longer relevant or needed because the whole frame ofreference was different. We can't say why, when she saw Brazil, she latched onto him with such tenacity, but we can guess that she knew he was someone fromher old world and she wanted out. The problem was, she'd been rewired. She could leave, but she couldn't rewire herself. That would take the collectiveknowledge and power of a pretty large Glathrielian group. That meant she wassuspended, neither here nor there. In our world she thought like and acted likeone of them. But in their world she couldn't completely wipe away a lifetime ofexperience, memory, personality, and ambition to assimilate."</p>
<p>Gus nodded sadly. "Poor Terry. She deserved better."</p>
<p>"Then we get to the situation where you were present. She reached out somehow,using what must have been instinctive Glathrielian mental methods, and hookedinto Captain Brazil's brain. Again, this is on an energy level, not physically.It was probably out of fear he might abandon her, but the link, onceestablished, worked both ways. He gained access to some of her powers, and shegained a connection that might as well have been steel chains. With only the twoof them, stuck for weeks on that island, more in her element than his. it'sdifficult to say what happened or if anything did, but it might have. Then camethe eruption, probably a terrified leap into the sea and an attempt to get away,the big explosion, and, in the course of it, Brazil was seriously, horriblyinjured. The link between them, something like a telepathic bond, would havecarried through to her as well. The shocks and his own physical and mentaltrauma, combined with what must have been sheer terror for her, overloaded hersystem. Linked to his more 'normal' wiring, going through all that with herGlathrielian wiring, the shock loosened and perhaps destroyed the carefulpatterns they'd built inside her. We think-and this is mere theory and probablycan never be any more than that-the patterns were wiped out, as if the wholebrain were flooded with a massive electrical charge. The Glathrielian powers,which are there now not because of wiring but because they'd been used so much,probably saved her life."</p>
<p>"I'm followin' about a tenth of this," Gus told her. "What is the bottom line?" "Sorry. It's just such a fascinating study that I tend to run away with myself.The bottom line is that we haven't any 'normal' Glathrielian or Earth-typepatterns for comparison-Brazil is hardly a good sample right now- but there area dozen or more races here that share similar brain and nervous systemstructures with the Glathrielian physiology. More important, they share a lot ofcommonalities, so we can compare and at least build a theoretical model of whata Glathrielian brain pattern should look like and how it works. Your bottom lineis that whatever was there was erased by the shock, and her brain then rebuiltwhat it could based on what it had left-the link with Brazil. We've tried allsorts of tests, always reliable on those others. Her memory isn't blocked byshock or brain damage-it's gone. The Glathrielian protective powers she had wereconstructed to be autonomic- automatic like a heartbeat. Those remained. So didthe other basic autonomic systems. The rest? A simple vocabulary based on whatlittle snippets of information were stored in areas closest to where memoriesare combined into thoughts-possibly her thoughts, possibly his. This has builtup to more complex thinking by what she's able to get from the surface-levelthoughts of others so long as those thoughts create holographic images in thethinker's mind. If you were to think of an image called 'boat,' for example, sheknows what a boat is. I do not, however, see any real evidence of abstractthinking or much chance for it."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"It's linear thinking, like we do, which means the pattern probably came fromhim," the doctor went on. "But it is very limited thinking, very limitedprocessing of information. She has no patience and little interest in learningmost things. If she decides she wants to learn something but doesn't get itquickly, she loses interest. She's entirely in the present; she has no conceptof the future or any interest in it. She can be thrown a ball and is just asamused if she catches it or watches it drop and bounce. She learned to push downon latches aboard ship to open hatches but never could get the idea of closingthem behind her, and she's been frustrated here because she's been trying topush down on doorknobs to open doors and it doesn't work. The woman you knew isgone. Accept that. What you have is a young child in her body. And there is noway of knowing at this stage if she will progress beyond where she is in morethan very small degrees."</p>
<p>Gus felt the hurt of losing someone very close, but it wasn't quite like that.'Tell me straight, Doc. Can you say for absolute certain, beyond the shadow ofany doubts, that Terry will never regain any of her memory? That it's a dead-onmedical certainty that she'll be like this until she dies?"</p>
<p>The doctor considered her words carefully. "No, I can't. Not with absolutecertainty. It is not like we've ever had a case like hers before or know exactlywhat we are dealing with. Not even the consulting Ambrezans really understandwhat's inside the Glathrielian mind. All I can say is, absent any evidence ofphysical trauma, it is a very remote possibility that much of anything wouldcome back. And if anything were still there, it would come back in pieces, overa very long period of time."</p>
<p>"But it's possible? As possible, say, as Captain Brazil surviving all thosewounds?"</p>
<p>"Well, yes, but-"</p>
<p>"She's tied to him, Doc. You said so. Maybe some of that immunity rubbed off aswell. If I just send her back now, it's over, period. She can never come back.The door's closed forever. See, I just can't write her off yet, send her back towhat is a certain life as part of a group mind living in the mud. She was somuch more than that."</p>
<p>"But what else can you do?"</p>
<p>"Well, what are my options here?"</p>
<p>"Not many. She can't stay here. The law says that anyone likely to be a ward ofthe state must be returned to its native hex. Of course, she is free to goanywhere she likes as well, but I still feel that this is the best course totake. The Glathrielians could probably restore her to their state, butunencumbered by the baggage she brought in the first time. She'd live what forthem would be a normal life."</p>
<p>"Not yet, Doc. When I'm convinced, but not yet. There's still some options open,no matter how wild the odds. If nothin' else, I want to see what happens ifBrazil wakes up."</p>
<p>The doctor sighed. "Well, as I said, I will get religion and go study theancient gods if he recovers, let alone walks. But there's another reason forpossibly sending her back. Perhaps a compelling one. It explains the other majormystery-why the Well preserved her pretty much as she was instead of translatingher into another race as it did with you."</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"She's pregnant, Gus. According to the Ambrezan material, about six weeks fromnormal full gestation. Counting back, that means she was pregnant when she cameonto the Well World and almost certainly not much before that point." "Oh, my God!"</p>
<p>"It's in the records, although extremely rare even in ancient times, it seems.The Well has no trouble taking one race and making of it another, but when youcomplicate it, give it what it perceived in its analysis as two in one, itdidn't have an answer for that. So it pretty much optimized her for survivalhere but otherwise left her just as she was. She is going to have a baby, Gus,and she doesn't even know what a baby is or how it's made."</p>
<p>Gus sighed. "Jeez! Now what do I do?" If he sent her back, she'd probably beokay, but he'd be dooming forever any chance she might have to recover normalcy.But if he didn't, then what of the baby?</p>
<p>"Well, you heard the colonel. I'm afraid that since she isn't capable ofdeciding for herself, it's entirely up to you."</p>
<p>"We have exciting news." the colonel told Gus. "We have a real lead on the otherone, this Mavra Chang. She is in the hands of an international drug ring whoseheadquarters are on the northern border of this very hex. A fair amount of moneyand death have gone into protecting them until now, but this changes just abouteverything, as you might suppose. The more things are different, the more theyseem like home. Is it not so?"</p>
<p>"You should know," Gus muttered.</p>
<p>The colonel ignored the sarcasm. "Well, they are going to attack theirheadquarters in utmost secrecy, led by one of the few really honest policemen inAgon. With Brazil safely incapacitated, I am going north this very day to be inon this other operation. After all, if we have Brazil but not Chang, and Changcan also access the well, then we have gained nothing. Still, I feel we areclosing in and that this matter is about to come to a head. There are othersfrom Earth in this raiding party as well, so it will be pleasant to have yetmore of a connection with the old home. What do you wish to do, my friend?" "Others? Anybody I know?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so. Someone 7 knew, at least for a little while, and twoassociates of Captain Brazil's who came in on his initiative, I believe, fromRio de Janeiro. One is a fellow countryman of mine-in the old life, that is. TwoDillians-they are much like the centaurs of our ancient Earth mythology, I amtold-and one Erdomite."</p>
<p>Gus sighed and shook his head. "I don't know. Much as I'd like to, the onlyperson I really know well is right here, aside from you and the captain, anyway,and I'm just not too sure what to do with her yet."</p>
<p>"Someone I believe you may know is involved, after all," Lunderman commented,looking over reports. "Do you know a Juan Campos?"</p>
<p>Gus's reptilian head shot up, and the eyes blazed with a menace not seen before."Yeah, I know the bastard! If it wasn't for him, none of us would be in thisdamned fix! He's in this group, too? Don't sound like his style." "You misunderstand me, my friend. Campos is with the drug cartel. In fact, itmight well be Campos who had Mavra Chang abducted."</p>
<p>That menace in the eyes didn't fade. "Same old Campos, then. He was dirty backhome, and he's still dirty. Guess he just don't know any other trade. Figures.What'd he wind up as?"</p>
<p>"A Cloptan. They look something like cartoon ducks, but there is nothing funnyabout them or cartoonish, either." He paused a moment. "A Cloptan female! Mostinteresting!"</p>
<p>"He's a girl?" Gus found it impossible not to laugh, although a Dahir chucklesounded far more threatening than amusing. "Well, at least he got some justice,the bastard. He won't be raping any more helpless women."</p>
<p>"Perhaps not, but Cloptan society isn't as traditional as most. Women have somereal power there, in the government and in the rackets, too, it seems. I wouldsay that whatever was done to him was compensated for by the society in which hefound himself. He's come a rather long way to be influential in such anoperation so quickly. Campos is the sort to have a deadly grudge against thisMavra Chang?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, he would, at least in his own mind. I was sick or drugged for most of it,but I remember enough, so I'm pretty sure he does, too. I want in on this one,Colonel. I want to see Campos squashed like the bug he is."</p>
<p>"I had hoped that you would say that. I should like to bring the girl along aswell. Protected, of course, and well out of the action, but even if she can beof little help, the detective in charge says that he would like her up there." "Huh? I hadn't really considered it much. Of course, I guess if I'm not gonnajust send her back to that Glathriel forever, at least not yet, she has to stickwith me. She trusts me pretty good, but-I dunno. I guess she could be sent backby any Zone Gate, so there's no real rush in that regard, but I'm not sure Iwant to get her exposed and active too much right now. Why would this drug agentwant Terry?"</p>
<p>"He does not say. The only way to know is to go up there and ask him. But why doyou have such concern over the girl now? She has certainly managed to take careof herself with minimal help so far, and even if she has lost her memory, shestill has her unique abilities."</p>
<p>"Damn it, Colonel, she's gonna have a baby in like a month and a half. That'swhy. What if she goes into labor? What if she gets stressed or even accidentallyhurt and the kid gets killed? She's no immortal."</p>
<p>The colonel thought a moment. "That does complicate things, I do agree. And yetAgon, and Clopta if we have to go there, are both high-tech hexes, and I believeshe would probably be as safe as or safer in one of them than she would be back in that primitive no-tech homeland. You've seen the medicine available herealready."</p>
<p>The colonel knew that Gus was only easing his conscience, that he very muchwanted both to go and to keep the girl with him, pregnant or not. Gus would haveto face the birth sooner or later anyway; it seemed pretty obvious he wasn'tgoing to send her back to what was tantamount to oblivion forever. Somehow, deepdown, it was obvious that Gus still clung to the belief that Terry, his oldTerry, might well be down there someplace, buried deep inside that girl's head.Until he was absolutely convinced that this person was forever but a memory, ifhe ever was, he would cling to her out of honor, out of friendship, and becauseit was the only thing that kept the Dahir himself going.</p>
<p>There was, of course, no purpose in telling Gus at that point that what theAgonite cop wanted her for was bait.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>She knew Gus was troubled by something, something concerning her, but shecouldn't, or wouldn't, dig down to find out why. It just wouldn't be rightsomehow, and besides, she might not understand it, anyway.</p>
<p>She liked Gus a lot. She trusted him absolutely, maybe the only one she'd met sofar that she could say that about. Oh, she trusted that nice doctor, too, butthe doctor was way, way too smart for her to really feel comfortable with. Itwas nice being able to actually talk to somebody, but most of the time shecouldn't follow what the doc was saying, so it wasn't that big a deal. Deep downshe was just an interesting patient to the doctor, but Gus really cared abouther, although why he did was still a mystery to her.</p>
<p>She had come to terms with the fact that most of the world was and would remaina mystery to her; most everybody seemed a lot smarter than she was, and after awhile she realized that would be the way things were and accepted it. It wasn'tas if she had anywhere she wanted to go or anything she wanted to do. It would have been easier on Gus if she could speak, but the doctor thought thatthe Glathrielian business had done something to the area of the brain thatcontrolled vocalization. She could make some sounds, but they were just sounds,not words. This was something else that might or might not reconnect, dependingon how she developed from this point. Because she could understand others, ormast others-there were some creatures that seemed a total blank to her but notmany-Gus had worked out what was still a simple sign language for her. It wasokay for the obvious basics, but it would hardly serve as an alternativelanguage.</p>
<p>Gus finally decided he had to tell her the situation, no matter how much shemight or might not understand. The concept of pregnancy proved less difficultthan he imagined; some mental pictures, along with a simple child's version ofhow it worked, seemed to get the message across.</p>
<p>She was fascinated by that. A little person growing inside her that wouldsomeday pop out and then grow up to be a big person. It made sense and answereda few questions she'd had about how all these people got there and why some weresmall and some were large, but she never wondered about how one got that way. "Now that you know," Gus told her as gently and simply as he could, "you willhave to be careful. Things could hurt you, or the baby, or both. You could goback to the people who are like you and be safe, or you can stay here. But ifyou stay here, there is a chance you or the baby could be hurt. You understandthat?"</p>
<p>She nodded. She had picked up graphic images of what her people were like fromGus, the doctor, and others, and she didn't think she would like that life. Guscouldn't come, and she knew from his mind that if she went back, she couldn'ttalk to or hear anybody else but her own kind. She didn't like that idea at all.Not only did she want to stay with Gus, Gus's own thoughts about the way herpeople lived came through as something scary. She let him know that sheunderstood he was worried about her and the baby and that he didn't want her togo.</p>
<p>It didn't ease his conscience, but it helped him go with the flow of events andaccept that, risks or not, she was staying. He had the distinct idea that nomatter what the colonel had said, they wanted her for something and wouldn't lether go in any event. He didn't want to be conned by these types; he knew themall too well. If she was going to be put in harm's way, then he was going to bethere for her.</p>
<p>That afternoon they met the colonel at a sleek, silvery transport station andboarded a magnatrain for the north. She found the station itself to be a placeof wonder, and the train was really neat.</p>
<p>"I spoke to Inspector Kurdon before we left," the colonel told Gus. "He seemsquite happy to have us, and he's particularly interested in you. He thinks yourlittle talent might well be very useful to him."</p>
<p>"Maybe, maybe not," Gus responded. "It's handy, yeah, but it's not as much as itseems to other people. If they have the equivalent of a television scanner, I'dshow up on it, and I'll trip any alarms. This place has got to be guarded likeFort Knox. It's not like I can just walk in there and do what I want." "Agreed. But I'm sure he has something in mind and knows all that. Well, we'llsee this evening, won't we?"</p>
<p>They pulled into the northern terminus station at Subar about an hour afterdark. The welcoming committee wasn't that hard to spot. Two Dillians and anErdomese female stood out from the Agonite crowd as much as or more than theydid.</p>
<p>"Oh, my! There's only that gruesome blob and that poor girl!" Anne Marieexclaimed. "I thought there was another!"</p>
<p>Julian looked at the Leeming oozing off the train and frowned. "I see thatColonel Lunderman hasn't changed a bit. It's just that you can see him so muchmore clearly now," she commented dryly.</p>
<p>"Greetings, my fellow expatriates, greetings!" the colonel said with his usualoily tones. Gus had wondered if Lunderman could say "Good morning" withoutsounding insincere. "I am Colonel Lunderman, and we might as well get the usualshock over with right off the bat. Say hello, Gus."</p>
<p>All three of the others were somewhat startled when the Dahir did just that. Tohave a huge dragonlike multicolored creature suddenly appear where one hadn'treally noticed it before was always startling.</p>
<p>"Strictly defense," Gus assured them. "We're too big and bright to hide, so wehave this ability. You'll get used to it. I can't turn it off." Julian recovered first. "Whew! That's some trick! Could have saved us a lot oftrouble if we'd had something like that!" She looked over at the colonel."You've come a long way since we last met, Lunderman."</p>
<p>"And changed a good deal. I would not have known you at all. Captain Beard."While forewarned, the colonel in fact was amazed at the transformation in theperson he'd known. In voice, tone, movements, manner-in virtually every categorythere wasn't a trace of the Julian Beard he remembered in the Erdomese female headdressed.</p>
<p>"Julian, Colonel. Just Julian," she responded, grim-faced. "Captain Beard isdead, or as good as dead. Think of me entirely as you see me. I have buried himforever." Too bad the same didn't happen to you, she added to herself. If she'ddespised the human colonel, she positively loathed what she was seeing now. Gus,too, made her feel very uncomfortable. He was creepy. She turned to the third,silent member of the party and softened immediately. "And this must be Terry." Terry smiled at her, capturing the sudden warmth inside the Erdomese. She wasvery pretty and seemed smart and strong, too. Terry couldn't figure out why Guswouldn't produce the same friendly feeling, but it wasn't anything she could domuch about right now.</p>
<p>The four-legged blond twins were also beautiful but not easy to catch thoughtsfrom. Their thinking seemed to go back and forth between one and the other sothat it was almost as if they were the same person in two bodies. Trying tofollow it made her head hurt, and she turned back to Julian.</p>
<p>"Come," Julian told them all, even though her attention seemed to be drawn moreand more to Terry. "This is not the place to speak of things. You never know whoor what's around. Let's get to the people running the show, and then we can allfill each other in on everything."</p>
<p>Gus looked around the station with the experienced eye of a professionalcameraman. It wasn't very crowded, and all the Agonese looked the same anywayexcept for size and dress, but he could spot the shadows and the tails. They hada way of not looking at a person and not being even curious about that personthat made them stand out to a professional's eye in the same way they did in acrowd back on Earth. He wondered which were from the cops and which were fromthe bad guys, but there was no way to tell that. The breed was made in the samefactory.</p>
<p>Inspector Kurdon proved to be another of the same type, but very dry and veryprofessional. He greeted them almost perfunctorily, and Terry couldn't help butfeel that he, too, had more of an interest in her than in the others for somereason, although there was no sense from him of the friendly, warm interestradiated by Julian.</p>
<p>"I know you all want to compare notes, so I won't keep you long," he told them."My people will be able to provide appropriate if not very exciting meals forall of you. I'm not going to tell you to get an early rest because the later yougo to sleep and the later you wake up tomorrow, the better. We are going intomorrow night, but not until nearly midnight. Surprise will be very importantto this operation."</p>
<p>"Surprise? With all these people and all this security you think you reallyfooled 'em, Inspector?" Gus asked him.</p>
<p>Kurdon looked at Gus with a bit more respect. "You are absolutely right in thatsense. We can hardly hide the fact that something is up here, but ourintelligence assures me that they still can't figure out what it is. Myadvantage is that they really believe the headquarters to be both politicallyand physically secure. Even if they think that we're moving against them, itdoesn't mean as much as you might believe. First of all, we are not after drugsor even criminals of any sort. We're after their computer records, which are noteasily transportable."</p>
<p>"Won't they just erase them the moment your people break in?" the colonel asked. "Maybe, but they have no equivalent to this headquarters anywhere else. I'm surethey have backups, but they aren't linked because such a link can't be runthrough other hexes and they can't be stored here and be totally secure from us.Putting this headquarters out of operation will severely cripple their entireoperation worldwide. It might be months, more likely years, before they getthings running with any degree of efficiency again, and not without great costin the interim. A lot of other hexes, not to mention the Patrol, have beenwanting to move on this, but they couldn't so long as Agon and Liliblod allowedthis center to continue. If it's destroyed, they will move, and the politiciansin their pockets will scramble to be on our side all of a sudden. For thatreason, I believe they will try not to erase the active records but ratherdepend on their own security to keep us from getting to the information. Then,when it blows over, they could have their own people mixed in with our crews anddownload and recover what they need. That is not going to happen. I believe wecan crack their codes, but whether we can or not, the computers there and alltheir data will be either in our hands or completely destroyed." "You sound pretty confident you can get it," Julian noted with skepticismdripping from her tongue. "What if you can't?"</p>
<p>"The drug business is the inspector's problem," the colonel told her. "Ourinterest is quite different. Some suitable prisoners, people who work thereroutinely day in and day out, should be what we need, although getting access tothe records would make it simpler and surer. If our quarry is in there, we willhave her. If not, we need to know where she might have been taken." "If they don't just kill her when you break in," Gus put in.</p>
<p>"If they can kill her, she's not who we are interested in," the colonelresponded coolly. "However, I have already seen enough evidence on my own tosuspect that this is not a problem."</p>
<p>"Yes, but Lori isn't some superman!" Tony pointed out. "We could be killinghim!”</p>
<p>Kurdon looked up impatiently at the Dillian. "We have been through this already.Everything we know suggests that if we cannot free him, he's probably better offdead. He is certainly addicted to a particular mutation of this drug in anyevent, which will cause enough of a problem. I am open to any suggestions onmaking it safe, but so far I've heard none. Until I do, this matter is closed.Now, if you will excuse me, I still have a lot of preparation to do. If thereare no further questions, you should go and get acquainted and eat and finallysleep."</p>
<p>"Just one question," Gus said. "How you gonna get in there?"</p>
<p>The impassive turtlelike head looked straight at him. "Come tomorrow night andyou'll see."</p>
<p>As Kurdon expected, the rest of the evening was much more relaxed, with a greatdeal of talking and comparing stories and experiences. For the first time Gusheard the account of the kidnapping of Lori and Mavra Chang and got a picture ofthe latter totally at odds with any memories he had of her back in the jungles. In fact, the Mavra Chang who emerged from the descriptions and tales of thetwins and from Julian sounded to Gus an awful lot like a female version ofNathan Brazil. This at first glance seemed to make even more mysterious theirestrangement from one another, but, Gus thought, often the pairs that seemed towork best together were ones one would never put together on one's own. A shipwith two equally strong-willed captains was a ship that sailed forever incircles.</p>
<p>The colonel was something of the odd man out in the circle. There was somethingabout him that made everybody who met him feel slightly uncomfortable, and asidefrom some reminiscences with Tony of their shared homeland in their originalnative Portuguese, the colonel did not participate all that much. He excusedhimself early, but the rest of them went on talking well into the night. Terry liked almost everybody except the colonel. Somehow this group of verystrange-looking creatures seemed very comfortable, very natural. It was something in the way they thought and interacted; no matter how alien they nowwere physically from one another, they were more alike in the way they thoughtthan any of the other creatures she'd met, including the doctor. It was afamiliar, relaxed feeling that was hard to describe, but it was comfortable toher. Somehow, in a way she didn't quite get, she knew that all these people wereher people, the same way she'd felt about Gus from the start. She didn't reallytry to follow much of their conversation; it was kind of dull, and a lot of itmade no sense to her. They seemed to be able to talk and talk and talk on thesame topic over and over without getting bored, but it didn't matter. Theunderlying din felt like a warm, safe blanket, a haven from the unknown andtruly alien world out there.</p>
<p>Finally, when it was quite late, they couldn't keep it up any longer. Gus toldthem that he would find a place suitable for himself and not to worry; Terry wasphysically best suited for Julian's tent, which had that floor of soft pillows.Gus couldn't make Julian out at first. She'd been a guy, Mister MilitaryRecruiting Poster, then was turned into a woman in a society that did not valuefemales, had been rescued from it by Lori, and now, with Lori gone, seemed likea strong but dedicated man hater. It was almost as if she'd literally hated,disowned, and, as she'd told the colonel at the station, killed off every traceof who and what she'd been back on Earth. After hearing the colonel'sdescription of the old Captain Beard on the train coming north, he hadn'texpected this at all. In a very different way, Julian had reinvented herself asthoroughly as Terry had.</p>
<p>Terry, stay with Julian. I'll be nearby, he thought in the girl's direction. Shedoesn't like men much, so if you see me inside and she can't, just pretend I'mnot there. Okay? Terry seemed a bit confused but nodded. The inside of Julian'stent was a veritable Art Deco wonderland of colors and exotic perfume scents,and it even had a full-length mirror tall enough for the Erdomite to see herwhole self in. Terry found the whole thing a little dizzying and the scents abit overpowering, but she got used to them after a while. It was the mirror thatfascinated her the most, though.</p>
<p>She'd seen her reflection before, but never her whole body at once, and itfascinated her. She was still not used to that face staring back at her. Thething was, she had no comparison with what she was supposed to look like exceptGus's mental images of the old Terry, and while she could see her in thereflection, it wasn't anywhere near the same. Chubby, bigger thighs, bigger ass,bigger breasts, and there, the tummy that kind of stuck out and didn't look likethe rest. That's where the baby is growing, she thought, more in wonder thananything else. She felt it, much like a hard lump inside her, and every once ina while, when lying around or sitting, she felt it move.</p>
<p>Julian watched her for a little while, then came over. "I was told you're goingto have a baby. You shouldn't be anywhere near here, let alone on this kind oftrip. These men don't care about you or it. I was one of them once, and I knowhow they think. My husband was a woman once, but the Well World made her a man,and before long he started acting and thinking just like the rest of them." Shesighed. "You're a fish out of water, just like me. You can't go home, andneither can I, even to our homes here. When this is over, I'm going hunting fora place for fish out of water. Maybe an island like the one you were stuck on,uninhabited. Maybe a little multiracial place where we could live our lives andjust be ourselves without having to be what we're expected to be." She paused."You just stick with me. I'll see they don't let you come to any harm." Terry didn't think anybody meant her harm, but a place to just live and see thebaby grow without all this other stuff sounded pretty nice.</p>
<p>Kurdon had his Agonite commanders there as well as the foreigners about threehours after sundown.</p>
<p>"All right, I've briefed the advance teams already, and some of this operationis already under way," he told them. "We've taken out every shadow and spy wecan't control, so they're pretty well blind, and we're set up with theexplosives, drills, and weapons in the forest above the headquarters complex.The raid is set for exactly midnight. At eleven fifty-eight the gang in themarket will be out cold from gas being introduced there now, and a team willenter and cut all communications from the subbasement there to the headquarters.That will set off alarms, but at exactly midnight, only two minutes later, thecharges and borers will start, and we will blow the main entrance, which is inLiliblod. This may cause a diplomatic problem later, and absolutely no one, andI mean that, is to cross the border. The charge should be enough to bringsufficient materials down on the entrance that it will be blocked. If by anychance it is not, we have sharpshooters just this side of the border to makecertain nobody gets out from that end. The only emergency exits they have areinto Agon, which will be easy to control since they're in line with the airexchangers. I want every unit in place behind the borers. Get in there as fastas possible. Stun or freeze anything that moves; kill anything you see thatdoesn't immediately surrender. Clear?"</p>
<p>The Agonese, mostly in black armored outfits with helmets and clear faceplates,nodded gravely.</p>
<p>Kurdon turned to the visitors. "There is no sense in risking the girl at thispoint. One of you should remain back here with her, and there will be a guardhere in case there are any nasty surprises."</p>
<p>"I'll stay," Gus told him.</p>
<p>"No, not if you're willing to come at all," the inspector responded. "I needthat cloaking of yours. The design is such that once we reach the main corridorof each level, we have to use it. Once the obvious resistance is taken out, youwould be very useful in scouting ahead and spotting ambushes. Your backgroundsays you've been under fire before, which makes you even more valuable, sincemost of my men really haven't. That true?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess so. If you really need me, I guess so." Though if I'm gonna stickmy neck out a mile, I wish to hell I had a camera and a network to send it to. "Julian, you can ignore a lot, but you have a personal objective in there, andif any of your old memories and reflexes remain at all, you've had real militarytraining and experience. Am I wrong?"</p>
<p>"No," she admitted. "You're right. This is a little out of my line, though. Iwas an air officer." Julian was startled by the offer. She'd never evenconsidered that Kurdon would want her anywhere but back in the rear. Now shefound herself nicely trapped by her principles; if he was willing to trust awoman, she could hardly say no.</p>
<p>"You know when to duck and can anticipate how these men will move and howthey'll operate, I think, and that's enough. For you it's all volunteer, though.Go or stay."</p>
<p>"I'll go," she told him. She didn't really relish this any more than did Gus,but it was do it or shut up about what she could or couldn't handle. "Good. I can't armor somebody of your type, so you'll be in the rear of theformation, but I need your eyes, ears, any extra senses you have, and yourexperience. I'll outfit you with a small transmitter. Use the troops as a shieldand move forward as they do." He turned to the Leeming.</p>
<p>"Colonel, as the other military man here, I'd like you up with the main corridorforce as well," Kurdon said. "Remember, though, that you're vulnerable to energyweapons and there's no way I can armor you, either."</p>
<p>"We will do as we discussed," Lunderman replied. "I assure you I will be in nomore danger than anyone else."</p>
<p>"I was in the same air force as the colonel," Tony pointed out. Flying fat asseslike him around with his cronies and equipment to make war on his own people, headded to himself. "Dillians are also excellent shots."</p>
<p>"Well, maybe, but Dillians are also exceptionally huge targets," Kurdonresponded. "If you want to come, okay, but you'll be in the rear. I'm not goingto let you down there until things are secure enough that you have a chance tosurvive. Otherwise, you'll just be in the way. I may need you for interrogationor ED, though."</p>
<p>"Oh, dear! That doesn't leave very much for me, does it?" Anne Marie noted. "Allright, then, I suppose I'm elected to remain back here with this poor child." "You can monitor what's going on from the command post right here," Kurdon toldher.</p>
<p>Anne Marie looked at Tony. "Must you go? I'm afraid I've gotten terribly used toyou."</p>
<p>Tony smiled and kissed her. "Don't worry. As the inspector says, I'm going to bewell out of range. But I have to go. You understand that, don't you?" "No, but I accept it. Take care."</p>
<p>Gus turned to Terry, who clearly hadn't the faintest inkling of what the hellwas going on. "You stay here. They want me and some of the others to go catchsome very bad people and maybe save some very good friends. You can't comebecause you can't help and we might get hurt protecting you. Do you understandthat?"</p>
<p>She frowned, then hesitantly nodded. She didn't like this at all, but if Gus said to stay, then she couldn't exactly argue. She suddenly realized that someof her new friends, maybe even Gus, could get hurt, though, and it scared her.He saw the somewhat sad, somewhat panicked look on her face.</p>
<p>"Don't worry. You'll be here with Anne Marie, and I won't let them hurt me. Youhave to believe that."</p>
<p>It would have been easier for her to believe it if she saw that Gus believed it,too.</p>
<p>"Where's the Dahir?" somebody asked, and Gus responded, "Here." "Oh, that is kind of nerve-racking, isn't it?" one of the Agonese soldierscommented. "Wish I could do it, though, particularly now. Okay, any way to getthis headpiece on you? It's pretty small and flexible. If you can, you'll beable to hear what we say and speak to us, even in a low tone. It will also bemonitored here, so if anything goes wrong, a message can be relayed. Think youcan handle it?"</p>
<p>"It's uncomfortable, but yes. Over the head and then below the snout on my neck.That will put the output mike right against the translator."</p>
<p>"Fair enough. You have done this before?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, but in another life and with a lot more equipment."</p>
<p>"Okay, people! Let's take a little walk in the woods!" Kurdon called to themall. "And keep it quiet, huh?"</p>
<p>Someone tried to hand Julian a rifle, but she refused, holding out a hand. "I'llmake do with these," she told him. I have to.</p>
<p>It was a cloudy night, which helped conceal their movements but gave Tony somevision problems. Someone handed her an Agonese helmet, which was extremely looseon her and pinched her hair something awful in the back but which proved alittle high-tech marvel. It probably would have been even more of one if it hadbeen connected to the rest of the armor-plated suit, but the faceplate proved tohave pretty good night vision abilities.</p>
<p>Basically nocturnal, Gus managed to keep position, and Julian needed no specialgear, simply relying on infrared. They walked for what seemed like a greatdistance through increasingly thick woods and rolling terrain until at last theycame upon a large unit already in place and surrounding what looked like a giantpencil the size of a small house on some kind of treads.</p>
<p>Kurdon went to the device, nodded to the technicians standing by it, and lookedat his watch, then signaled for two of the technicians to move. They got up onthe treads, pressed something, and a small room in the very rear of the thingwas revealed. They got in, sat down, strapped in, threw some switches, and thenthe entry closed behind them. There was a dull whining sound from the devicenow, and Julian's eyes could see a sudden glow from not just the "point" of thepencil shape but from the tapered area as well.</p>
<p>"What is that thing?" she asked a soldier near her. "Construction machine. It'sused for tunnels on the railway, for reshaping rock formations, that kind ofthing. There are only three of them in existence, and somehow he's got all threehere tonight."</p>
<p>"You mean he's going to bore holes right into their roof? Can we follow? I mean,it's bound to be molten."</p>
<p>"It cools pretty quick. You have any feeling in those hooves?" "No, not really."</p>
<p>"Then if we can go in with these boots, you can, too. Don't worry about it.We'll see that you make it."</p>
<p>The comment irritated her, but she stilled her tongue. No use pissing offsomebody who was supposed to give her cover.</p>
<p>"Market is secure," Kurdon told them, the news coming through everybody'scommunicator at once. "Demolition team in place. Air exchange patrols check inby number."</p>
<p>They couldn't hear the responses, but apparently Kurdon was satisfied. Nervous and scared, as he should be, Julian thought, but he's having the time ofhis macho life. I bet he's dreamed of this moment.</p>
<p>"Borer to full. Demolition team ready at my count. Ten… nine… eight… seven… six… five… four… three… two… one… Now!" Just to the northeast of them a massive explosion sounded, shaking the veryground. Liliblod was a nontech hex; Julian had to wonder what the hell they'dfound that would make that big a bang.</p>
<p>At the same moment the entire tapered part of the borer glowed red and thensuddenly shot a blindingly hot white energy beam so powerful that Julian's eyesreflexively switched to day vision. It didn't matter. The whole forest was litup, and nobody could watch that beam. Not far away, there were similarilluminations in the no longer dark wood.</p>
<p>Kurdon's plan was simple given the technology he had to work with. The firstborer, almost on the border itself, would open up the main entrance to forcesthat could drop in and secure the hopefully trapped but panicked and confuseddenizens inside in one stroke. That done, they would move to secure all thesecurity controls, taking command of them, then move a force back along thefirst level. The colonel would go in with this team.</p>
<p>The second borer, with Julian, would move in and secure the middle area,followed by a ground force larger than the other two. These would proceed inboth directions, linking up with the first group on that end and the thirdgroup, with Gus, coming in the back and pressing forward. Once the first levelwas secure, they would use internal access if they could to go down; otherwise,portable borers would come in through the ceilings. The rear part of the secondlevel was said to hold the cells; the forward part was the labs. Then theprocedure would be repeated on the third and final level, where the computers,living quarters, and more cells were. That was the main objective and mightpossibly be the toughest-or the easiest. Few crooks bottled in so thoroughlyliked to go out shooting; their chances were far better if they were takenprisoner. Or so it was theorized. The borers cut off, and it was suddenly toodark once more, except for a dully glowing, perfectly symmetrical tunnel goingdown at an angle just where the borer had been pointed. The technicians movedthe borer back on its treads; its job was done.</p>
<p>A small rectangular vehicle now moved up to the hole and, parked right in frontof it, was opened by two soldiers. Water or something like it gushed out anddown the tunnel, creating a cloud of steam that quickly cleared. "Tunnels safe and coated," Kurdon reported to them. "Prepare to move in. Take itslow and easy. Don't slip. The angle's a good twenty degrees." That worried Julian, with her hooves, but while the tunnel appeared perfectlyround from a distance, up close it proved quite jagged and irregular inside. Thefirst group had also strung a rope along each side and secured it, so there wasa handhold to use if need be. She found it tough going but not impossible, andshe was well in before it suddenly occurred to her that at the end of this thingthere was bound to be one heck of a drop and there was no way she was going tobe able to get down on a rope or temporary ladder.</p>
<p>It was eerie at the end, a dark hole filled with lots of lights-like dozens offlashlights waving around in a black cave-lots of echoing shouts, and the soundof both conventional gunfire and energy beams not too far off. She brought herself as close to a sitting position as she could and was relievedwhen she saw an Agonese soldier on a ladder reaching up to grab her. They wereremarkably strong for their size, she noted, accepting the offered hand andfeeling not at all good that she had to do so.</p>
<p>There was the sound of muffled explosions both forward and in back of her."Concussion grenades," a sergeant told her. "We're lobbing them in every doorwayand opening we find. They'll knock most anything inside cold but don't do muchdamage."</p>
<p>She switched again to infrared and saw a well-organized operation going on. Itwas also some headquarters for a criminal operation. The corridor seemed to befour or five meters high and carpeted, and the conventional lights from thesoldiers' helmets revealed a place that looked less like a drug hideout and morelike a luxury hotel.</p>
<p>"Entrance area secure. Lights coming on on level one only," Kurdon's voice cameto them, and soon the whole ceiling flashed on, bathing them all in a soft butample indirect light.</p>
<p>For the second time Julian had an ego-killing thought. My God! What am I doinghere? These people are more professional than I am! If Kurdon had invited heralong to prove a point, he was doing a damned good job.</p>
<p>She could still hear firing in back of them.</p>
<p>"We're moving out toward the back end with this squad, ma'am," the sergeant toldher. "You can come, but watch it. As you can hear, this place is a lot biggerand more complicated than we thought."</p>
<p>She could only nod. "Shows you what you can do with unlimited money, doesn't it?Go on, I'll watch your back." At least that's something I can do here, shethought ruefully.</p>
<p>It wasn't until they had the lights back on that the officer in charge of therear complex team called for Gus.</p>
<p>'These rooms go into rooms that go into rooms," the officer said in a mixture ofwonder and disgust. "We can't be sure what's still in there. Just go ahead onyour own and scout it. We can tell where you are by the transponder, so youwon't get stunned or shot. Here's a pistol. You look like you can handle one. Weneed to find the location of a downward stairway as quickly as possible, sothat's your objective."</p>
<p>Gus stared at the pistol but felt very uncertain about it. I don't kill people;I take pictures of people killing people, he thought, with a sense of unrealityabout it all. He didn't know if he could kill anybody.</p>
<p>But he still took the gun. It felt heavy and all wrong in his tiny,four-fingered hand, but he knew he could hold it and fire it. It was one ofthose Buck Rogers ray guns; no problems with recoil or ammo, at least so long asthe battery held out.</p>
<p>He was appalled at the size and scope of the place. Jeez! Don Francisco Camposwas a two-bit piker, wasn't he? This place is the fuckin' Maui Hilton! Wonderwhere the swimming pool and saunas are. He wondered how Juan Campos managed tofit into this kind of setup. For crime, this was strictly first-class, andclassy to boot.</p>
<p>He was careful not to enter any of the rooms until after they'd tossed in thestun bombs. It was quickly clear, though, that the complex went off in bothdirections for some distance, and just tossing those things in the first room ina series of rooms didn't get too many people. Oh, there were a couple lyingabout in the first room he entered, but the others either stayed back out ofthat exposed area or came in after the blast, when the soldiers would feel safe.Damn if some of 'em didn't look like real live Donald Ducks. Not toofunny-looking, though; some of 'em looked real tough. Even so, there was a veritable United Nations of the Well World represented here. Gooey things andmean-looking suckers and women with goat heads and humongous breasts and awalking toadstool or two, not to mention a couple of two-legged alligatorswearing pants and the biggest damned frogs he had ever seen.</p>
<p>He went from room to room to room, cataloging what he saw in low tones andwarning the squad if any of the critters emerged with weapons in hand or lay inwait. He reckoned he was saving a number of lives, and that made him feel good,if not any less scared to death. With this big a zoo, there was no telling ifhe'd run into one or another creature that might not have a problem seeingDahirs.</p>
<p>Finally, in one rear room that looked like a luxury suite at the Waldorf exceptfor the fact that it was clearly built for some large humanoids with bull headsand horns and some of their cowlike girlfriends, whose unconscious forms he'dpassed two rooms earlier, he found the jackpot. This was clearly a visitor'ssuite, and visitors could easily get lost in a place like this. He couldn't read it, but it sure as hell looked like a map of the whole place. Welcome to the Drug Lord Ritz, he thought with some amazement. Man! Had theyever been cocky and arrogant! He made his way carefully back out to the maincorridor and hunted for the officer. "Got something that will make life a loteasier if you can read it," he told the startled Agonite.</p>
<p>The officer looked at the maps, and his reptilian jaw opened in amazement. "Ishould say you did!" He looked at the first level map, then the second, thenlooked up and pointed. "Nine more doors up. Emergency stairs." "I'm surprised they don't have elevators," Gus commented, still amazed at theplace.</p>
<p>"They do, but they don't have power now. Besides, do you want to be in the firstcar when the door opens?"</p>
<p>"You got a point there."</p>
<p>"As soon as we do a linkup and get a first level secured, we go down. I'll radiocommand and control where the other access stairs are."</p>
<p>"How are we doin' so far?"</p>
<p>"Well, we knocked out about a third of 'em. The rest so far have been equallydivided between giving up and fighting it out. We hope it'll be easier below,since they know they don't have a way out if we get down there, but you neverknow. A lot of their security people will be down there, and the bosses probablykept their loyalty with drugs. When an addict is faced with losing his drugs oris charged up on them, who knows?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Thanks for the optimism," Gus commented dryly.</p>
<p>As expected, they had captured a huge number of the staff trying to flee out ofthe main entrance into Liliblod. The explosion hadn't completely sealed thingsoff-there were more entrances and exits than they had thought-but it had trappedenough.</p>
<p>The colonel had come in with the first wave but didn't stay for the wrap-up.Instead, he pressed himself against the wall and slowly and carefully oozed upit to the ceiling, then began a slow but steady flow back toward the middlegroup well ahead of the commandos. A Zhonzhorpian with an energy beam rifleemerged from a doorway beneath the suspended Leeming, huge crocodilelike jawsopen and dripping saliva, eyes blazing mad.</p>
<p>A pseudopod shot out and struck the gunman on his head. He dropped the rifle androared in pain, clutching at his head, but his hands went into thick goo andseemed to be stuck there. With slow deliberation, Lunderman flowed down andaround the man and engulfed him. He remained like that for a short while. Therewas a sort of hissing sound as if something were being dissolved in acid, andthen a larger Lunderman reached up and flowed back onto the ceiling area. Therewas no trace of the very large gunman who had been there except his rifle, stilllying where he'd dropped it. A few moments later various metallic and plasticpieces fell from the ceiling to join it as the Leeming rejected what could notbe digested.</p>
<p>Far from being satiated, Lunderman was instead irritated. There was a limit tohow many of this size he could absorb without going dormant and dividing, andthis bubble-brained idiot had known nothing of importance.</p>
<p>Worse, Lunderman had no idea what his limit was. He hadn't ever eaten more thanone a week until now, and that had been sufficient. Even dissolved, theadditional mass of one was significant if not any sort of handicap. Judging fromthe added mass of this one, the upper limit might well be no more than five orsix. If he doubled his size, he could not stop the process.</p>
<p>It was unlikely that there would be many of the cartel on this level who had anyinformation except by sheer chance, anyway. He began to search for a way down.Best to find it quickly, anyway, lest some nervous soldiers spot him and notrecognize him as a friend.</p>
<p>As he heard the concussion grenades going off not far in front of him and justas the lights came on, he found it. Some sort of service elevator, he decided,linking the upper rooms with perhaps the kitchen or even the labs. It didn'tmatter. The door was easy enough to dissolve with the extra energy he'dabsorbed, and to his great relief the car was down at the bottom. He flowedalong the tiny, meter-square shaft until he reached the second level. Theautomatic trip on the door was obvious from this side; he didn't have to burnthrough it to open it.</p>
<p>On the other side was a small room that possibly served as a crew lunch room orbreak station. Nothing special, and expected. It was deserted, and he moved tothe door, listened carefully, but saw no crack or opening where he might extenda pseudopod to scout what was beyond. He flowed back up to the ceiling, reacheddown, and used the manual grip to push the door open slowly.</p>
<p>The room beyond was lit by recessed emergency lighting, giving it a dull orangeglow. It was a big place and looked very much like a state-of-the-art, high-techlab, which it was. There didn't seem to be anybody there, although some thingswere still cooking and bubbling away.</p>
<p>It still wasn't what he needed, but it was one step closer. Below this, if hecould find another easy way down, would be the master computer room.</p>
<p>There was no way Tony could get down one of those tunnels, something Kurdonsurely had known when he had agreed to allow the centaur to come along. Now shestood just inside the border, staring out into dark Liliblod.</p>
<p>"Damn! They say there's like three entrances out!" one of the soldierscommented. "We got the main one, but the other two are beyond our reach by thispoint. They say the complex is bigger than an office building! Crime sure payssometimes."</p>
<p>"Until now," Tony commented. "What about those other entrances? Anybody coveringthem now?"</p>
<p>"We sent a few people up there, but any of the big fish who wanted to get awayare well into Liliblod right now, and our people are heading to shut them downfrom inside by now. One's just kind of a side door, I guess, for private comingsand goings, but the other one's like a stable. They say they got some verystrange animals in there."</p>
<p>Tony was suddenly alert. "Any of them with a body like mine? Animal head,perhaps with a horn, but a body like mine?"</p>
<p>"I dunno. I'll check. Hold on a moment." The soldier said something into hiscommunicator and waited for the reply. "A few with bodies kinda like yours, butnothing with a horn."</p>
<p>"See if you can have somebody from the middle group contact Julian. That's thename. Report this to whoever you can get and ask them to get word to her. Ifhe's anywhere around there, she'll recognize him."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Just do it."</p>
<p>The soldier complied. "Message received and relayed, they say. That's all. Ican't guarantee it'll be passed on. They'll be linking and going down to leveltwo shortly."</p>
<p>Tony thought furiously, frustrated at not being able to get down there to seewhat was going on for herself. "How far is this stable? And how far in from theborder is it?"</p>
<p>"About four leegs that way, and maybe just a harg inside, but that's far enough.Why?"</p>
<p>Four leegs was maybe half a kilometer, and a harg was no more than ten meters."I was thinking maybe I could enter from there."</p>
<p>"Lady, you don't wanna do that. You got colonies of them Liliblodians right upthere in the trees; I don't think they're real happy with us at the moment, andthey don't give a shit about diplomacy and protests and all that other crap.They'd be on us like a plague if any of us went across that border, high-techweapons be damned. They got sense enough to know they'd be wiped out, but they'dtake a ton of us with 'em before they went and might figure it's worth it.They're probably so mad at us for blowing up the main entrance in theirterritory, they're just waiting for one of us to stray ever so slightly in." "I came through there once before, and they didn't even show themselves. And I'mnot of Agon. They might hesitate."</p>
<p>"Yeah, and if they don't, you'll be dead in ten seconds. Don't think your sizewill save you. Dozens of 'em will drop down on top and cover you, and you'll getenough poison in the first few seconds to kill half the world. Besides, even ifyou managed to get in, how would you ever get the heck out?"</p>
<p>It was a good point. Still, she was determined to do something. 'Tell your menup there I'm coming and not to shoot. Don't worry. I accept your argument; I amnot going to try it. But if I can be very close, perhaps I can be of some help." With that, she trotted off toward the north.</p>
<p>Julian was frankly relieved to get the call. Frustrated and feeling useless, shewas in no mood to follow them down to farther levels.</p>
<p>Assured that at least level one was now secure, she made her way forward towardthe main entrance, from which someone would guide her to Tony. She was most ofthe way there when, just behind her, something came out of a doorway roaringwith fury and charged right at her back.</p>
<p>She didn't even think, she just acted, shifting forward on her forelegs, rearingup the powerful hind ones, and kicking with all the strength she could muster. The hooves struck the creature in the face and snapped it back. The thing gave astartled cry and then was flung backward against the far wall with the force ofthe blow.</p>
<p>Julian came down slightly unbalanced and with her hind legs splayed. She was amoment realizing what the trouble was and easing herself back up. Turning, stillon all fours, she could feel her heart pounding in her throat and whatever theErdomese used for adrenaline coursing through her. She feared a second attack,but the creature was not moving at all, just lying limply like a rag doll thrownto the floor by a bored child.</p>
<p>With some shock, she realized that the thing was dead. Looking around lest therebe any more ugly surprises, she carefully approached the body as a couple ofAgonite commandos ran toward her.</p>
<p>The thing looked like somebody's nightmare of a teddy bear, perhaps a meter anda half tall when standing. Those teeth and that fierce expression, now frozen indeath, were never on any teddy bear she'd have around, though. Two commandos approached the creature cautiously, then checked it out. "Dead,"one said, and the other nodded.</p>
<p>"Lady, that's some mean kick you got," the first one commented to her. "I thinkyou broke its neck and maybe its back."</p>
<p>"Yeah," the other agreed with grudging respect. "That guy must've weighed threetimes what you do, and he flew."</p>
<p>She was beginning to calm down a little and realize what she'd done. Now, wherehad that come from? It had been so natural, so automatic, she hadn't even hadtime to think before it was over, but she sure hadn't known she could do that. Maybe she'd been the one to underestimate the Erdomese female. The only thing was, she couldn't stand back up. She was locked in thefour-footed position. She didn't mind that much; it was both comfortable andnatural, and she used it often by choice, but now she guessed that it was partof the defense built into her. About the only problem was, it made her slightlyshorter than the Agonese, even with her head up and forward on her long neck.Oh, well.</p>
<p>She felt suddenly terrific-euphoric, even. She'd actually done something! Shewasn't as defenseless or helpless as she'd thought!</p>
<p>Not wanting to admit that at the moment she couldn't get back up, she saidconfidently, "I think I'll go the rest of the way on all fours, boys. I don'tthink my arms could take too many more bounces like that."</p>
<p>They watched her go on with obvious respect in their eyes.</p>
<p>"I hope my wife doesn't have any hidden tricks like that," one of them said. The other felt his own throat. "Yeah."</p>
<p>Gus carefully scouted the stairway down to the second level. It was quite dark,and even his night-adjusted eyes had a problem with it, but there were smallbumps of yellow rights running down both sides, powered by some internal source,that made footing not a problem. Seeing was something else again, but thesterile, flat walls carried sound well, and he could hear nothing close by. If they were waiting for company, those on the second level certainly weren'tdoing it on the stairs or landing. Gus figured that they would expect a grenadeto be tossed down the chute here, and with the echo, nobody would last verylong. Most likely they would be waiting beyond the doors to this level. While they might not be able to see Gus, they could certainly expect the door toopen and probably wouldn't wait to find out who or what had opened it. Hepressed up against the door and could hear voices which made him pretty surethat a nasty welcome awaited.</p>
<p>"Armed party probably barricaded just beyond the second level doorway," hereported into the mike. "No way I can open it without exposing myself. Stairsclear to level two."</p>
<p>"All right. Why not move down and check the bottom level, then," came atinny-sounding voice near his ear. "If the stairs are clear, we won't give thema warning by blowing anything there. I'm sending down an advance party now totake out whatever's behind the door. If you can get into the bottom levelsafely, use your own judgment. Otherwise proceed back to two after the openingis secured."</p>
<p>"Okay. Heading down."</p>
<p>The bottom looked like the second level, but unlike there, he couldn't hear anysigns of life on the other side. Okay, Gus, how lucky do you feel? he askedhimself. Are you Clint Eastwood or Mickey Mouse?</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse, he answered himself, but he was still tempted to try the door.Once inside, he'd be virtually invisible to whoever and whatever was there. He heard the commando team come down to the second door above him. There wouldsurely be some explosions and shooting before too long. Maybe, just maybe, if hecould open the door and get through quickly at the same time they opened upabove, it would panic and confuse anybody with a bead on the door. Hell, it was either that or get his eardrums broken sitting there. He took hold of the door, then waited. Come on, come on, let's get it over with!he thought to the commandos above.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was the quick sound of an open door and a big explosion and thenthe nearly deafening din of weapons fire just above. He pushed back the door,standing to one side, and when it seemed as if nothing was coming out and nobodywas nearby, he slipped quickly inside it, leaving it open.</p>
<p>There was emergency lighting here as well, only better than up top. It made thearea glow a very dull red, but it was sufficient for him to see and get around. If he remembered the layout, he was now in the area where they kept prisoners.Ahead would be the living quarters, the master kitchen, and then the computercomplex.</p>
<p>It definitely had the look of a prison or, more accurately, a dungeon. He foundwhy there hadn't been a welcoming party for him there immediately. The wholeentrance foyer was little more than a giant cage of thick mesh with anelectronically operated door at the end. There was no lock, latch, or knob onthis side; it clearly was intended to be opened only from the inside. That meant a guard or guards with some kind of surveillance system. He lookedaround the ceiling and upper wall area in the dim red glow and finally spottedwhere the camera just had to be. That left him with a problem. If everything sealed when the main power went off and there was always a guardor two inside there, then the guard must be in a sort of in-between cage betweenprison doors. He might well be trapped in there. In fact, he was pretty sure hecould hear somebody moving just beyond. How the hell could he deal with thatguy?</p>
<p>He had a thought that was so nutty, it just might work. It was, after all, verythick mesh.</p>
<p>"Hey!" he called out. "You okay in there?" The guard stirred and hesitated,unsure of who this was or whether to respond.</p>
<p>"Cm'on! I'm one step ahead of them bastards upstairs. They're gonna blow throughhere like butter with all the artillery they got, and right now I'm gonna beright in between 'em like the filling in a sandwich!"</p>
<p>The guard was more scared than suspicious. "You're with us?"</p>
<p>Gus gave a loud, impatient sigh. "If I was with them, this door would be blowingup about now. C'mon, man! It ain't much, but it's the only chance I got!" The guard still hesitated. "I got my orders. If the power goes, nobody in,period. Not without an okay from the boss or security."</p>
<p>"What the world you think this is, you dumb ass? It's the cops. It's a wholedamn army. They already got the top level, and they're working on the lab levelnow. We're finished. All you can do is either make a break with me if we can orstay and die."</p>
<p>"Ain't gonna break out from this level!" the idiot said, almost with pride. "No? Well, then we can fight or give up. If you gotta give up, you don't want tobe the guy who's handy when they start checkin' the cells. Huh? Now, stopclowning and let me in!"</p>
<p>"I-I-I dunno. I don't know what to do."</p>
<p>"Anybody come up and reinforce you?"</p>
<p>"N-no. They all lit out for the front."</p>
<p>"Leaving you here to either buy 'em more time or take the fall. You're a sucker.I don't have any more time for this. I'm gonna open up on this door, and eitherit's gonna give for me or I'll run out of ammo. Maybe if I cut through this cagewith this needier, I'll accidently hit the dumbest asshole in this wholecomplex."</p>
<p>"I-no. I, er-don't do that! Here!"</p>
<p>There was a fumbling sound and the turning of a manual key and a wheel, and thedoor swung open. Gus entered and found a sorry-looking little guy in a blackoutfit sitting there on a stool with a big energy rifle cradled in his lap. Hewas a little twerp, like an anemic otter in full dress, and he actually had atiny pair of glasses sitting on his snout.</p>
<p>"W-well? Why don't you come in?" the guard asked, the rifle coming up. "Right here, you dumb shit!" Gus shouted in his face, grabbing the rifle andbringing the stock down hard on his head. The guard collapsed in a heap, andGus, rather than worrying if the little guy was dead or alive, felt a littlethrill of satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Sucker," he said, checking the rifle and seeing that it was still in goodshape. He decided it was handier than the little pistol if he could manage tohold on to it.</p>
<p>The inner door was easy to open, although the wheel was hard to turn with hissmall and relatively weak arm muscles. Finally the lock clicked and he was ableto pull it open.</p>
<p>Inside was a long and ugly chamber of horrors.</p>

<p>Liliblod</p>
</title>
<empty-line/>
<p>He hadn't done it, and it made him feel worse than ever. He'd actually had thechance back there in Clopta, and he hadn't done it. He'd meekly gone back overthe border and started following the same old trail, just as before. What bothered him most was that he was well inside Liliblod before he realizedthat he hadn't done it or even remembered what he'd intended to do. It wasalmost as if he could have his opinions and dream his dreams, but he could onlyact on what he was told to do.</p>
<p>Maybe it's still going on, Lori worried. Maybe just changing me physically intoa packhorse isn't the end of it. What if even my brain is becoming more horsethan human?</p>
<p>The more he thought about it, the more certain he was that this was the case. Hecould think frantically and hard, even plan, but for how long at a time? Was hethinking slower, or were there very long stretches of time when he just didn'tthink at all? He'd made this trip countless times, over and over, but how manytimes and for how long? He didn't know. How long did it actually take him towalk the trail from Clopta to Agon? Again, he didn't know, not even how manydays it might be. How long had it been since he'd meekly walked back in? Was ittoday? Or yesterday? Or was it further back than that?</p>
<p>He had no idea.</p>
<p>There were times when he was totally lucid, remembering a lot of specifics abouteverything, and there were other times when he couldn't remember much at all.Why, just back there, when he had thought of escaping, he had remembered most ofa map and how to get around. He knew he had. But try as he might, he couldn'tget that information back now.</p>
<p>He had been losing it little by little, piece by piece, and he hadn't evenrealized it until now. Maybe the process was speeding up. Maybe it was nearlydone. How many facts could a horse's brain hold? Not too many, because it didn'tneed to hold all that many. He ate, he slept, and he walked the same trail.Could it be that deep down that was all he really wanted to do? Or was it that he no longer had the will to do anything different and was makingexcuses? That his old self said "Fight!" but his current self wanted only peaceand contentment? How much of him was gone, and how much had he himself pushedaway so he couldn't make use of it?</p>
<p>He didn't even know how long he had mused on these depressing topics, but it wasquite a while.</p>
<p>One thing he suddenly did know was that he wasn't far from the end now. Closeenough from the scent that he could smell and taste the hay and oats and othergood stuff they had at the headquarters, far better than just grass. He usually stopped after dark and slept till morning, but he was close and hedidn't really need to see all that much to make it. Not far, not far… Suddenly, ahead, there was a massive explosion! The noise startled him so much,he reared back and shook his head in disbelief. And then came the sounds of gunsfiring and loud shouting by lots of people.</p>
<p>Suddenly terrified of what lay beyond, he stopped right on the trail and juststood there, unsure of what to do.</p>
<p>The tumult ahead died down after a while, but not the one overhead. The tops ofthe trees were alive with hissings and buzzings and sheer rage, and he heardthose things begin to move along the treetops, move toward the border and thenoise.</p>
<p>Suddenly two figures, a Cloptan man and a Zhonzhorpian, came running toward himon the trail. He tried to back up and back off a bit to let them by, butsuddenly a flashlight beam caught him square in the face.</p>
<p>The two men were out of breath, were half-dressed, and looked to be in aterrible way. Soon they began arguing and then shouting at one another, andafter a moment the Cloptan took something from a case he was carrying and abright white beam caught the Zhonzhorpian full and enveloped him; suddenly thetall crocodilelike creature was no more.</p>
<p>The Cloptan then approached Lori, and he was even more terrified after seeingwhat had happened to the other, surely a companion rather than an enemy. The Cloptan patted him on the side, trying to reassure him with the gesture andmeaningless talk, and oddly, it did have a calming influence on him. Then the Cloptan climbed up on his back and latched the case to the saddlebagswhile keeping the gun in one hand. Firmly, the rider turned Lori around, awayfrom the end of his journey and back toward where he'd come from. Cloptansweren't horribly heavy, but this was going to be one heck of a walk. He wished he knew what had happened back there, but whatever it was, it surewasn't good.</p>
<p>Agon-Liliblod Border</p>
<p>"Lieutenant, I think you better get some men down to the third level as quick asyou can," Gus said into the mike. "I left the door open. I think I killed thelone guard, but if he isn't dead, he's too dumb to do anything but give up." "What's the matter? What did you find?"</p>
<p>"Monsters. Monsters in the basement. You might want the inspector down here aswell. If Agon doesn't have capital punishment, I think it will by tomorrow." There was silence for a moment, then the officer said, "All right. I'll send asquad down and relay your message. Will you wait for them?"</p>
<p>Gus looked around and shivered slightly. "I don't think so. The guard station atthe other end is empty, but the door's locked. I think I can blast through it,though, now that I've seen how the doors are made. I'll report when I can." "Resistance on the second level was light after that initial barricade. It'smostly labs, and it looks like they ran when things started happening. Watchyourself, though. Any of them that didn't come up to level one are pretty likelyto be down there-and desperate."</p>
<p>The cells were of the highest quality for dungeon cells. High-tech, Gus thought. State of the art. Thick, shockproof, probably bullet- and rayproof doors made ofsome material that nonetheless was totally transparent save for the electroniclocks and a small slit for feeding prisoners not otherwise restrained inside. There were 1,560 races, it was said, on the Well World, and he'd seen only atiny fraction of them. And even though many were bizarre in the extreme, none ofthem could be as bizarre as some of the creatures in the cells. Hybrids, geneticmutations, people whose own bodies were in the process of re-forming themselvesinto the visions of insane designers. Some screamed, some cried out, otherssobbed, but he could not help them or look at them.</p>
<p>Now, what the hell does any of this have to do with a drug ring? he wondered. Designer creatures. For what? Designer jobs? Animals with the smarts of humansto avoid detection, follow complex orders? Traitors, people who'd failed intheir work for the gang, now forced to become monsters at the beck and call oftheir masters? Why kill them when they could be turned into something useful?Recycling taken to its ultimate degree.</p>
<p>There were a few that weren't like that, but they weren't much better off.Chained to walls, scarred, ripped open but still alive in agony… They musthave had information somebody wanted. At least it was more familiar. He'd seenthis sort of stuff back on Earth in central Africa, in the Middle East, and in afew of the less pleasant Far Eastern beauty spots. In some ways the mentalitywas the same no matter where you went, even here. The others, the monsters-thatwas just a high-tech extension of the same idea. New toys for the depraved. The idea of a Campos with this kind of power was disturbing. The originalincarnation was bad enough. Gus remembered what a big-time syndicate boss hadtold him once. It wasn't about money. Money was rarely a concern after a shortwhile. It was all about power.</p>
<p>"Hey, Lieutenant, you got a news crew here in Agon?" he asked through the mike. A moment later, after a request to repeat the question, the answer came. "Yes.Several."</p>
<p>"Well, get 'em down here when you can. Let 'em see this, photograph it,broadcast it. Even though it'll make every viewer sick to their stomach, it'lllegitimize this raid and your government more than anything else. Some of thosecorrupt bastards who protected this place all these years should watch it, too.And if they don't know how to cover it right, call me. I'm an expert." He reached the jail door at the other end. Knowing where the locking mechanismwas, he fired the rifle on full blast, holding it steady until the lock turnedfirst black, then red, and finally white. He released the trigger, then rearedback on his tail and kicked with both powerful feet. The door resisted the firsttime, but the second kick saw it move back. He had been so angry, he saw he'dactually bent the material.</p>
<p>The secondary door had been left open, since it was never designed to be morethan a security lock for people wanting in. As he went through it, shots rangout all around and tracerlike needier rays rained down on him. For a moment hethought they could see him, but then he realized that they were just firingblindly at the sound.</p>
<p>"Hold your fire, you idiots!" somebody called. "Don't waste energy! Wait untilthey actually come through!"</p>
<p>Good advice, Gus thought with nervous release. They wouldn't have had to do muchmore of that before they'd have winged or even killed him. Blind shots were hisworst enemy.</p>
<p>They'd overturned tables, beds, sofas, everything they had, and made a prettyfair barricade. This was not going to be easy, and he was suddenly acutely awarethat he was between them and the commandos he'd just urged to come down behindhim.</p>
<p>There didn't seem to be much of a choice. He picked a weaker and less sturdypart of the barricade, went over to it, took a deep breath, then simply chargedin with a roar, making furniture and appliances fly all over the place. The gunmen were so startled that the ones closest to him pulled back in totalfear, while the ones on the other side again opened fire on the now-desertedcorridor.</p>
<p>He didn't wait for them to figure out what was going on. He was, after all, avery large target even if invisible. He opened up on the fleeing men with therifle, forgetting he still had it on maximum. The whole corridor was bathed inwhite energy, and those caught directly in the beam were disintegrated, whilethose farther away found their clothing and skin in flames.</p>
<p>He turned to the others who were just turning to bear on him and charged intothem with a hideous roar that echoed terrifyingly down the corridor, so close inand so violent that they had no chance to use their weapons. There was no riflethis time; Gus's huge reptilian jaws opened and closed with savage fury as histargets futilely struggled and fought to break free. One down… Two… Three… Where the hell was four?</p>
<p>Running down the hall right into the cells, where he would undoubtedly find awelcoming party by now.</p>
<p>His mouth was dripping with blood in three colors, and there were pieces ofpeople from three races all over the place, but nothing alive. And the funny thing was, he felt great! He looked around on the floor and didn'tsee his own rifle but saw a furry dismembered hand still clutching a nearlyidentical one and pried it away.</p>
<p>Staff living quarters and kitchens. He could just walk right through them towhere he really wanted to go, but he didn't think he would.</p>
<p>He wondered what the current record was for the Agon commandos for killing theseturds and also whether it was possible for him to break it. The ghost of his oldLutheran pastor shattered in his mind. Hell, he was really starting to enjoythis!</p>
<p>Julian's walk back to what they had called the "stable" entrance had calmed hersomewhat, and she was finally able to relax enough to stand on two legs again. She wasn't sure just what they were bringing her this far away to look at, andwhen she saw, she still wasn't quite sure.</p>
<p>"What are they?" she asked an Agonese sergeant.</p>
<p>"Beats us, ma'am. We were told maybe you could tell us. We ran 'em through ourown system by shooting video up to the command center, but they can't placethem, either, at least not by species or hex."</p>
<p>They looked mostly like horses and mules, but not quite. No two were nearlyalike beyond the basic form, but no two rang exactly true, either. She could seewhat the Agonese meant and why they hadn't really been able to explain it. There were tall ones and short ones, big ones and little ones. They dividedfirst into two classes which she thought of as equine and elephantine. Theequine had thin legs of varying lengths, balanced torsos, and heads on longnecks. They tended to have camouflagelike colors, dull and mixed, with lots ofbrowns and olives. Hair was short or long; tails were optional and of varyinglengths and designs. The heads, though, were what caught her attention. They alllooked different, and many of them looked unsertlingly like caricatures of thefaces of some Well World races.</p>
<p>The elephantine were more bizarre, with very thick legs; wide, round paddedhooves; and large, squat bodies that tended to be hairless and dull-colored,with pink or gray or mottled variations, as if they'd once had hair but it hadfallen out. They, too. had faces, but the faces-again all different and withsome hint of familiarity-were virtually looking out from the top front of thetorsos without distinct heads or necks. She couldn't imagine how they fed. The worst thing was, they all looked at her and the others with eyes that seemedvery intelligent indeed and expressions, when they were capable of them, ofextreme sadness.</p>
<p>"Did you capture anybody alive from this area?" she asked them. "Yeah, but they haven't been too talkative yet. We asked them what these thingswere and why they were here, and all they said was that it wasn't their area butthey thought they were couriers."</p>
<p>"Couriers!"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Apparently this is a fairly new batch still being trained. They have somethat run through Liliblod to Clopta, but most of them go to other areas wherethey can run stuff by night through backcountry areas without being seen." "Do they make sounds?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh, but they're just crazy screeches or bellows. Nothing intelligible, evenon translator, if that's what you're thinking."</p>
<p>She was thinking worse than that. She was thinking of those two doctors she'dgone to see with their miracle experiments and records that had includedinformation on Glathrielians and Erdomese.</p>
<p>I actually let them put something into me, too! My God! Am I going to turn intoone of these things?</p>
<p>She told herself to calm down, that they wouldn't have been crazy enough to tryanything like that and risk exposure, but she couldn't quite convince herself.I'm going to be a paranoid hypochondriac for months, she admitted ruefully toherself.</p>
<p>She tried to pull herself together. "Are they-natural? I mean, do they seem,well, normal in the sense of being put together right?"</p>
<p>"Well, as far as we can tell, they're all sexless," the sergeant told her. "Ofcourse, with those, who could tell what's really missing?</p>
<p>Julian thought of Lori and Mavra Chang. Couriers? Like these monsters? "I want to talk topside if I can," she told the sergeant. "They told me that myDillian companion couldn't get down here. I'd like to contact her if I could. Ineed to compare some notes. Is that possible?'</p>
<p>"Could be. I'll call the command center and see if they have a channel open." Inside of five minutes she was talking to Tony. "Where are you?" she asked thecentaur.</p>
<p>"If you're where they said you were, I'm probably about five meters on top ofyou," Tony told her. "What's the situation?"</p>
<p>As quickly and as adequately as she could, she described what she'd seen and herthoughts on the missing pair.</p>
<p>"I agree, but we must remember that these poor wretches were probably their ownpeople being punished for failures, while Lori and Mavra were objects ofrevenge. I can see them perhaps making Lori one of these poor creatures, but Icannot see Campos doing that to Mavra Chang. If I remember Lori's account of hisadventure in the jungle, I can see why Campos would want some revenge, but notthe kind of long-term suffering that would be due to Mavra. I know something ofthe code and the way people like Campos think. It was that sort of person thatcaused me to stay away from my native country until democracy was restoredthere. Lori was a point of honor, a detail, even though an important one. ButMavra Chang by direct action impacted personally on Campos. She stopped hisattempted rape, she kidnapped and dragged him in the jungles, and then shecaused him to wind up here. No, Mavra Chang would be special, someone who wouldhave to be in permanent hurt and humiliation, available for frequent lifelongscorn. Considering what you have told me, who knows what these people werecapable of?" Tony thought for a moment. "A pet, perhaps. A dog or cat orwhatever would be appropriate but not too obvious. Something that could bewalked on a leash through a public park. You see what I am getting at?" "Yes, I'm afraid I do," Julian replied.</p>
<p>"Someone should be able to remember Lori and what they turned him into," Tonysaid confidently. "They are still in a state of shock, but interrogations shouldbring results. That is a big place, but it is not that big, and I would suspectthat the permanent staff knows pretty much what is going on throughout theplace. But Mavra-I fear that unless we can get into that computer and find outprecisely what they did or unless we can crack those two butchers open, we willhave to reach Mavra by going through Juan Campos."</p>
<p>"I've never met this person," Julian told her, "but I am beginning to think thatI want to meet her. Preferably in a nice dark alley…"</p>
<p>In a hex with the kind of technology that could put a very powerful computerinto something the size of a claw, the computer center was incredibly huge. Howmuch information did they have here? What could these rooms of memory cubes,each capable of holding trillions of facts, possibly contain? More than, merelyall the data on the drug business, that was for sure. Blackmail on thousands ofleaders in every hex they went to? Biological information on every single race,with details on how to make something for each that would addict them? Probably,Gus thought. At least that.</p>
<p>He was as surprised by the size of the place as he was by its emptiness. He'dexpected at least a few people here, just to make certain that this stuff didn'tfall into anybody's hands, but the place was completely deserted. Or was it?</p>
<p>Over there-a terminal of some sort and something, something large butindistinct, sitting at it…</p>
<p>Colonel, what the hell are you up to? Jeez! The Leeming was huge, a blob fit forthe horror movies almost. At least twice the size he'd been a few hours earlier,anyway.</p>
<p>The large projection-type screen above the terminal booth was alive withflashing data. Gus couldn't read any of it and was surprised that the colonelseemed to be able to do so. Come to think of it, even if the old boy had somehowmastered the writing, how the hell had he gotten past the security system andinside to the data?</p>
<p>And suddenly, with the cynicism born of covering countless wars and tragedies,it all fell into place.</p>
<p>"I always wondered how you got so much authority and power so fast, Colonel,"Gus said loudly, his deep voice echoing slightly off the walls. The colonel was startled. "Gus? How did you get here so quickly?" "This is Education Day, Colonel, at least for me. Today I found out things aboutmyself I never knew before, and I also found out why the Dahir have such astrict and pacifistic religion and don't want their people wandering all overthis world. We're killers, Colonel. Natural killers. It's in the blood, in thegenes, the hormones. We enjoy it. I enjoy it. It's a tough thing to keep downonce you've started doing it. That's why the Dahir faith is so strict and lifethere so god-awful boring. It's the only way to keep us civilized. Nothing worsethan a natural killer you can't see wandering around, is there?" "You are a rational man, Gus. You only have killed your enemies." "That's true, but I have a strange feeling that it's going to be very easy to bedefined as an enemy of mine from now on. But I haven't told you the whole storyyet, Colonel. Education Day is still ongoing. I learned the best part just bystepping in here and watching you."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Nothing this big, no operation this slick and this huge, could possibly get tobe this way on its own, and I don't care what drugs they sell or how much moneythey spread. We ain't talkin' just a gang here. We're talking governments, orparts of governments, at the highest levels. Presidents and kings and dictatorsand probably South Zone councillors as well. Not that they were in on thedetails, of course. I doubt if they were ever here or even imagined how some oftheir money was spent, but in on the top levels of control. Not all of 'em,sure. Not even a majority, 'cause what sense would that make? They didn't careabout the details. They were busy using that power to weaken and take overgovernments of hexes they didn't even know how to pronounce. Control economies,trade, you name it. Pretty soon the whole Well World's workin' for them and itdon't even know it. It must've drove 'em crazy when they figured out they had tosacrifice this place, but their little underlings did something, and they can'tafford to even let their own people know what it was. Uneasy lies the head, huh,Colonel?"</p>
<p>"Go on, Gus. You are quite entertaining."</p>
<p>"So it's going along really good, and then, suddenly, wham! Here's the legendaryNathan Brazil unmasked, and he's headed for the internal works sooner or later.They can't kill him, so they try and slow him down, make him feel comfortable,that kind of thing, while they consult and figure out what the hell to do. Imean, they can't let him get inside, can they? If they do, he'll see theirracket right away and queer it. I can just imagine the nightmares. And then it'snot just one of 'em but two. Either one's the worst thing anybody could imagine.Both together might be unbeatable. Two unkillables. But they're pretty clever.The two clearly haven't seen each other since the last ice age on Earth, so it'seasy to make each of 'em think the other's out to get them. They won't gettogether then even if they could. But how to keep them from getting up to theequator? That's the other problem."</p>
<p>"It is quite an amazing fantasy you weave, Gus. You should have quit news andgone into the cinema."</p>
<p>"It gets better. You, for one, are there as a member of a race that was one ofthe insiders. The Leeming. Somehow, right off, they see you as just the kind ofguy who's perfect for them, but you can create a friendly, human face. All thepower, all the authority-and one job. Just keep Brazil happy and anywhere butheading north and always where you can find him. I don't know why you didn'tjust have him arrested and jailed right off, but I can think of a number of reasons."</p>
<p>"For one thing, Nathan Brazil is a legend, a part of mythology, like Odin andJupiter back home. Bringing a sufficient number of leaders to the convictionthat he was more than that and that he was a possible threat to the Well World'svery survival takes time. The last is next to impossible, really. No one fearsthe repairman; they welcome him. They fear the demolition man, and they feartheir gods. Ironically, Brazil himself tipped the scales on the requiredreligious conversions merely by surviving what no creature of his makeup shouldpossibly survive. And the more he recovers, the more nervous they will get. Theywill endlessly debate how to enforce any deal or bargain they can make with him,but who can truly make such demands of a god once that god is on his throne? Sothey will keep him locked up. There is your story. One day he may escape, but bythat time they will be long dead."</p>
<p>"Uh huh. And who had your job with Mavra Chang?"</p>
<p>"You would not believe me."</p>
<p>'Try me."</p>
<p>"The Dillian twins."</p>
<p>"I don't believe it!"</p>
<p>"They didn't know anything about the rest, unlike myself. They were just givenan all-expenses paid chance to see the Well World if they would simply make afew reports on the location and whereabouts of one Mavra Chang as things wentalong. They didn't know Chang, and they were made just aware enough that she wasmore than she seemed and something of a threat to peace, stability, and order.Armed with that, it was rather easy to make her miss connections, foul up herbank accounts, that sort of thing. And unlike the captain, who truly gave me theslip, she actually contracted with those very forces which wanted her out of theway to carry her here. It was Brazil we were worried about. We didn't give athought to Chang. Now, though, we find that Chang is not here. Somehow sheslipped through our net and into the hands of a minor player about which we knowvery little overall but whose mental profile in the records indicates that she would do almost anything to keep Chang out of anyone's hands but her own." "That still bothers me, Colonel. You know where Campos lives. You could havegone there at any time and forced her to show you Chang, but you didn't. Youwent through all this, which must cost them plenty."</p>
<p>"It did. It is painful and a real setback," the colonel admitted. "But you stillfail to appreciate both Campos and the man she ingratiated herself with. If oneinkling, one thought that Chang might be another Brazil entered his mind or theminds of his associates, they would vanish, and Chang with them. The hold theywould have over the entire international organization would be nearly absolute.Surely you must see that. Chang must never be the object of all this except tosuch as we. And when we bust them, headed by fearless and incorruptiblepolicemen like Inspector Kurdon, even they will have no suspicion until Chang isin our hands and locked away in Zone next to the captain with the so-pleasantname."</p>
<p>"And now you're here finding out exactly what they did to her, what monster theyturned her into, and precisely where she is. And after that, making certain thatnothing in that computer will ever be read by the inspector or anyone else. Tellme, Colonel-how'd you learn to read that stuff so quickly? And how'd you learnhow to use their computer system? You ain't been here much longer than me." "Long enough, my friend. Besides, we Leeming have more than one way to learnthings. In fact, with certain kinds of races, which make up close to ten percentof the south's racial makeup, we don't have to do anything more than feed. Youcan see by my size that I've been a very gluttonous soldier."</p>
<p>"You mean you can learn stuff by eating somebody?" Gus was incredulous. The colonel chuckled. "Friend Gus, you are on an impossible world full ofimpossible creatures such as the two of us, turned into a big colorful lizardwho can not be seen unless he wants to be, discussing a worldwide takeoverconspiracy for which there remains no proof at all and which you only learnedabout because of a hunt for two demigods. And you find my alternative learningmethod unbelievable?"</p>
<p>He had a point there, Gus had to admit. He kept his rifle on the colonel, but heexpected a trick any time now. The colonel hadn't moved, but did he seemsuddenly more like his old self in size? Or was that imagination? "You're a rotten son of a bitch, Colonel," Gus told him. "You had a secondchance here, a real chance of a new life and a fresh start, and you decided toremain what you were back on Earth. Don Francisco must have paid you prettygood, too, I suspect."</p>
<p>"Not nearly enough, but after the return to democracy there were problems formany of us, and we had to find alternative sources of income to maintainourselves and our families in the style to which we had become accustomed. Thisis not the same thing. This is the equivalent of military rule, which we imposedto prevent the communists from dominating our beloved land. In that I followedorders and remained true to my country. I am doing so again, and I feel that itis a new start for me. Again I have honor. Again I serve my country and mypeople."</p>
<p>That shimmery SOB was shrinking! Gus shut up and moved back toward the entrance.It was barely in time; a thin layer of goo rose up and grabbed for him as hemoved.</p>
<p>Nice try. Colonel. You are better than I gave you credit for, Gus thought,nervously eyeing his narrow escape. If the colonel had kept him talking justanother thirty seconds, he'd have been history!</p>
<p>"Gus? Where are you?"</p>
<p>Ready to take aim on your slimy guts the moment you pull yourself together, youfat pig, Gus thought, but he remained silent but vigilant.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Gus. I won't make another stab at you," Lunderman assured him."Look, no one will believe your story, not even Kurdon. You have no place to goand no way to act on what you know. You can't win, not against this kind ofpower. But you don't have to lose, either. You are a very resourceful man, Gus.Very resourceful. Just as they found a place for me, they can find one for you.Anything you want. What have you to look forward to, anyway? You can't gohome-particularly now. You know that yourself. The Dahir church would probablyhave you sacrificed to keep from corrupting the rest of the flock. You are botha man and a creature without a country, Gus. But with your unique talents andawakening appetites you needn't be an unhappy one."</p>
<p>I wouldn't be tempted if you were giving me a straight offer, Gus thought, but Ican see your puddly self flowing all around the floor and in between theconsoles, feeling for me even now.</p>
<p>The colonel had grown large, but not that large. It was relatively simple tokeep out of his way if Gus just paid attention.</p>
<p>Gus could see a fair amount of him now, but too flattened and too spread out tomake a real target. Still, Kurdon had warned the Leeming that he was vulnerableto energy weapons, and that happened to be just what Gus had in his cute littlehands. Time for a continuation of Education Day. Gus set the rifle on wide,aimed at the largest concentration of Leeming he could see, and pulled thetrigger fast and briefly.</p>
<p>The colonel screamed an unholy scream as part of him fried and vanished. Itsuddenly occurred to Gus that this might have been the first real pain Lundermanhad felt since becoming a Leeming. Reflexively, the rest of the amorphouscreature withdrew inward toward the central mass. But where was the central massnow? Gus wondered. Not at the console.</p>
<p>Cat and mouse, Colonel? Gus thought. Suits me fine, but I frankly didn't thinkyou had the guts.</p>
<p>Lunderman didn't. Suddenly, across the room in one corner, a great mass rushedupward with tremendous force and speed. It was so fast and so blended againstthe dark that Gus was slow to react, and by the time he got off a shot, thething had vanished into the ducting above.</p>
<p>Gus didn't like the fact that the Leeming was around up there somewhere andnursing both a wound and a grudge, but he could hardly follow that exit. Atleast the colonel couldn't see him or anticipate his actions. Even so, thefaster he was out of here, the better, he thought. Still, he had to risk somecommunication. "The colonel was working with the gang," Gus reported. "I am inthe computer room. He was in here erasing records. I shot at him but only wingedhim. You can't capture him, but he's the only one of his kind here, and he canbe fried. I recommend a shoot on sight, particularly since he eats people byabsorbing them." Suddenly the magnitude of what he'd done hit him. "And get somepeople in here really quick," he added. "Lunderman's left the computer turned onwith the damned security already deactivated!"</p>
<p>The sun had been up for hours when they struggled back to Subar, but all of themfelt it had been worth it. Terry almost cried for joy when Gus came back and ranto hug him.</p>
<p>There was no sign of the colonel, but all the entrances and exits were heavilyguarded and it was felt that he was still in there somewhere.</p>
<p>Inspector Kurdon looked exhausted but generally satisfied. "Sixty-eight of ourskilled or wounded, but at least two hundred of theirs dead and almost a hundredin custody, and we broke that cancer that has been eating into the soul as wellas the soil of my nation for far too long. It has been a worthy night indeed." "What about the computer? Have your people learned anything?" Gus asked him. "Not as much as we might have had the colonel not gotten in there first but farmore than I think any of them would have wished. What you caught him doing wasunleashing what my computer people call a tapeworm." The term wasn't exact, butthat was the way it got translated to Gus. "A program that goes in and finds anddestroys specific information. A second was ready to load, and a third was foundnearby, but thanks to you only the first was run."</p>
<p>"Any idea of the nature of the information destroyed? Or is that a ridiculousquestion?" Anne Marie asked him.</p>
<p>"No, it is not altogether ridiculous. We can deduce a little of it, although wehave barely scratched the surface of the thing. It will be months before we geteverything we can out of that data base, and we need to make certain that no onewho does not have the most impeccable honesty gets in there in the meantime. Ido not like it that the colonel is still at large in there, but we do notbelieve he could actually operate the computer. Rather, he knew how to run thetapeworms and where they were stored. In a sense, merely losing what we did is afair trade for having the security system opened up. We might have learned farless over a much longer period had we had to attempt to crack it." "And the erasures?"</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry. As I say, by deduction. Political names, big regional names, thatsort of thing. We won't get a payoff or politician's listing from that, I'mafraid."</p>
<p>"It's bigger than you know," Gus told him. "You wouldn't believe how big. I gotit straight from the colonel."</p>
<p>Kurdon gave a weary nod. "I believe I know how far this had to have gone just bylooking at its scale and by the sheer number of hexes where deletions were made.Do not worry, Gus. It wouldn't matter if the entire council was corrupt, as theyprobably are in one way or another. This complex and the computer are in Agon.Agon alone has authority here. And I know who is who in Agon." "What about Lori and Mavra? Any word on them?" Tony asked, concerned overJulian's report.</p>
<p>"It is the first minute of the new information age," the inspector said. "Giveus a little time. This is of the highest priority. Get some sleep, all of you!Even 7 am going to attempt it. By the time we awaken, they will have news,perhaps very exact news. Then. I believe, we will be on our way on a journey tothe northwest."</p>
<p>"Clopta!" Gus breathed. "And Campos." Kurdon nodded. "Also by that time I expectthat I will have so many high Cloptan officials terrified of me that I will becarried to this Campos person on a litter with politicians as bearers." Hesmiled, the first time any of them could remember seeing such an expression onan Agonite. "It was a very good night."</p>
<p>By late afternoon, when they struggled back to the command center, most stillhalf-asleep but unable to go any further toward resolving the problem, thetrusted technicians inside the computer room had some answers. "A bird and a unicorn," Inspector Kurdon told them. "Neither are monsters in thesense of the ones we discovered down in the cells. They are in their own waysworks of art-if, of course, the results proved equal to the computer estimation.Your friend Lori was something of a compromise, it appears. The original orderwas for a grotesque, like what we saw. But when they saw the genetic potentialand also discovered that Campos was just going to make him a courier like therest, they had second thoughts. They made the monster part come out early, thenlater fade as the real program kicked in..Campos was apparently furious at thestart but later decided she liked it after all. At least, there's no sign of anyattempts to do worse again."</p>
<p>"You got this from the computer?" Julian asked him.</p>
<p>"Not entirely. Our doctor friends seemed to have pulled a very slick vanishingact in the middle of a cordon I'd have sworn was unbreakable, but theirassistants weren't so fortunate. And the assistants know the medical computerquite well and helped with all the detail work. With what we got from theclinic, we were able to go to specific points in the big machine and getvirtually a replay of the entire discussion and debate, almost a step-by-stepexplanation and tutorial. They were sick of making monsters. They wanted to makepretty, living works of art." He reached into a pouch and pulled out a picture."Here is what your Lori looks like now."</p>
<p>The pretty beige pastel colors had been retained, and the hair, and much of theelements of the original Erdomese, Julian noted. Only the body had thickened,becoming less wiry and more equine overall, and the forearms and hands hadbecome traditional horselike legs with fixed hooves much like the Dillians'. Thehead had been thickened, and the head and face reshaped into a rather cutehorse's head, but retaining the curved horn in the forehead that was the mark ofan Erdomese male. Compact, sturdy, cute.</p>
<p>"Kind of like a cartoon Shetland pony," Gus commented.</p>
<p>Kurdon cleared his throat. "The worst news, I fear, Madame Julian, is that thespecifications set down by Campos included that he be a gelding. It was actuallydesigned that way. There are no genitalia at all."</p>
<p>Julian knew she should have felt shock and grief for Lori, but somehow she feltrelief. Still, she noted, "I wouldn't exactly be the proper mate for a pony,anyway, would I, Inspector?"</p>
<p>"Um, no. I hadn't thought of that. We also discovered why all the poor wretcheswe found made only unintelligible sounds. It seems the practice was to installwithin them a type of artificial translator that intercepts both incoming andoutgoing language. Only someone with an identical translator tuned to eachindividual's code will be understood by the-pardon-creature, and vice versa.That way, if something happened, if one of them escaped or fell into the handsof the law, they could never reveal anything they knew. And the totalsexlessness made them docile, passive, easily trained, and nearly incapable ofrebellion. No aggression, no initiative. They may hate it, but they'll doexactly what they're told to do."</p>
<p>Poor Lori, Julian thought, and somehow that very sentiment, spontaneous as itwas, made her feel a little better about herself. "Where is he now? Do youknow?"</p>
<p>"He was on the Liliblod route, and he was due in Agon either the day we hit theplace or today. So far no sign of him, and we can hardly go hunting in Liliblodfor him. not for quite a while."</p>
<p>"They won't eat him, will they?" Tony asked worriedly. She'd already decided tomake a run in to see that stable area for herself when a soldier had given her apair of night vision glasses and shown her the denizens of Liliblod. That hadtalked her out of any such foolishness. Giant furry spiders with glowing whitedeath's-heads dripping with venom…</p>
<p>'Tony!" Anne Marie scolded.</p>
<p>"No, it's a fair question," Kurdon said. "My feeling is that they will not breaktheir own end of the bargain. They are a strange lot, but they have an odd senseof honor and consistency. In all these years they never once touched anyone whostuck to the agreed-upon routes, although frankly, I'd not like to test them toomuch right now. There's some evidence that a number of higher-ups had emergencyescapes down to the stable area just in case, and since we didn't nab them, wemust assume they got away into Liliblod as well. Best case I suspect is thathe'll eventually turn up, possibly after getting over confusion over all the newpeople there. Worst case is that he met up with some of these fleeing bigwigsand was turned around and pointed back toward Clopta. If that is the case, heshould be snared when we move on the gang there. They can hardly send him backagain. To what purpose?"</p>
<p>"They might kill him!" Julian said worriedly.</p>
<p>Tony shook her head. "Not Campos. She's not the type. She's more likely to puthim in a horse stable, if they have such things in Clopta, and ride him aroundthe park on nice mornings."</p>
<p>Kurdon nodded. "That is our assessment as well."</p>
<p>"But what about Mavra Chang?" Tony asked him. "You said a bird?" "Yes." Again a hand went into the case and brought out a picture. "Probablysomething like this. It's an even greater work of art than this Lori, in a way.You see, that's a real creature, albeit a rare one from a hex far away fromhere. A real bird. The only thing that's different is the size of the braincase,which was accomplished with some clever bioengineering. Campos wanted hermentally intact, to know."</p>
<p>"Odd-looking thing," Gus noted. "Kinda like an owl, but with a long bill andpretty colored feathers."</p>
<p>"It's flightless," Kurdon told them. "The wings have completely vanished. It isalso quite large-about a meter high, and it can weigh upward of thirty-fivekilos. It spends basically all its time rooting with that long, curved bill andsticky tongue, eating mostly insects. It needs to eat a great many of them, butit can also eat raw meat and even a little grain if need be. It is nocturnal,practically blind in daylight, which, aside from its size, is its only defense.The legs are too short and stumpy for speed. I doubt if it can run at all. Sortof like walking on your knees. They made certain she wasn't going to goanywhere."</p>
<p>"The poor dear!" Anne Marie exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Will you be able to do anything for them, all things considered?" Julian askedhim. "I mean, you said this was genetic data here, and I went to those-thosedoctors myself. They said doing it more than once could lead to instability,deformity, death."</p>
<p>"Hard to say, with our two most knowledgeable experts among the missing," Kurdonnoted. "Probably we can do very little. What we can do is outfit them withtranslators that restore their communication with the outside world. At least that will give them some voice again in how they want to cope and some help indoing it."</p>
<p>Julian thought about the pair. Another couple of one-of-a-kinds, she thought.The population of her mythical dream island was growing.</p>
<p>"Well, we should be able to get them when we get Campos," Kurdon assured them. "Shouldn't you send ahead and have them arrested now?" Julian asked him. 'Too risky. Clopta is not Agon, and without a bit more authority from that nicebig computer, it's not dependable. Remember, even the two maniacs who createdthis managed to escape us, and that was here, in our own backyard." "Shouldn't we be off, then?" Tony asked him. "I mean, it's likely some of thoseescapees are even now heading toward Clopta with the news of the raid. They maygo underground before we can get to them."</p>
<p>"Liliblod is the same size as Agon, and they are on foot," Kurdon reminded them."We, on the other hand, will bypass Liliblod and sail directly into Buckgrud,the Cloptan main port city, which is where our quarry happen to live. Besides,even with what happened here, I am pretty sure they'll still feel safe inBuckgrud, which the cartel more or less owns and operates, and under theprotection of their own bought politicians."</p>
<p>"I hope you're right," Julian said, looking at the photo of the new Lori. "Itmust still be awful for them now. I'd hate to get this close and lose them." "Don't worry about it," Gus said confidently. "I mean, hell, the hexes aren'treally huge, and outside of their native hex they'll be easy to spot. Hell, Ibet Juan Campos looks like Daisy Duck."</p>
<p>Julian nodded. "A very dangerous Daisy Duck."</p>

<p>Buckgrud, Clopta</p>
</title>
<empty-line/>
<p>Juana campos was made up and dressed to kill-if one was a Cloptan male. In fact,it was the large eyes and pliant oversized bills that gave Cloptans a ducklikeappearance, but they were not related to ducks, nor were they exactly birds inspite of the featherlike covering-rather, they were egg-laying mammals thatincubated the eggs in the marsupial-like pouches which both males and femaleshad. Aside from the oversized heads, the body shape was quite humanoid, thefemale's particularly so, although the males tended to be more pear-shaped andactually rather dull-looking. The females even had thick, lush hair growing fromtheir heads, while the males were universally feather-topped and rather bald.The females even tended to be taller than the males, but while short, squat, andfairly ugly as a rule, the males were built like tanks and abnormally strong fortheir size. Much of their bodies was protected by invisible but quite effectivethick, bony plates right down to the genitalia.</p>
<p>In Clopta, women were literally soft and men were literally hard.Gen Taluud was built like a bank vault and had a face to match. Ugly, raw, witha curl on one side of his bill that revealed the otherwise seldom visible sharpteeth lining the inside. He looked like the kind of Cloptan who might walk rightthrough a wall, and he radiated that kind of toughness even when saying nothing.He had spent twenty years doing all it took to become the top man in Buckgrud,the man who owned the mayor and the provincial governor and whose very word waslaw. But it hadn't been merely by strong-arm tactics, bribes, double crosses,and murders that he'd risen to the top; he was anything but the stupid muscle heappeared to be.</p>
<p>He'd initially gotten interested in Campos simply out of curiosity, someone whohad once been something entirely different. That made her exotic andinteresting, and the fact that she also had a hell of a figure didn't hurt.Campos had initially been appalled at the circumstances the Well had forced uponher but also realized that this was a golden opportunity, maybe a chance to risehigh and fast in spite of the changed circumstances and in a way overcome thesexual change and get both power and protection. She'd learned, observed, andplayed the part Gen Taluud expected of his mistresses. Campos recognized theTaluud type immediately as the same sort of boss his father and other cartelmembers had been back on Earth, and she also understood the business. The onlyone who'd stood in her way once she'd accepted the situation and her own self aspermanent had been Taluud's longtime existing mistress, who wanted no rivals.But when she'd tried a hit on Campos and failed, thanks to Campos's ownexperience, she had become easy to handle. Campos had pulled the trigger on thewoman herself and disposed of the body in a time-honored way so that it wouldnever be found.</p>
<p>If Taluud suspected or knew, he never said, but instead of being upset, evenforlorn about the loss of a longtime companion under mysterious circumstances,he'd given Campos a free ticket to the top and treated her with a fair amount ofrespect, in some cases giving her the authority usually reserved for hislieutenants. Campos understood the bargain. So long as she was at his beck andcall, jumped when he snapped his fingers, and served him loyally, she otherwisehad nearly free rein within the organization. Still, service to him could beunpleasant sometimes, as the big man was fond of rewarding certain underlingsand bigwigs with his girl's services for an evening or two. But with no assetsother than the body and a shared ruthlessness, she'd learned to use that, too,to build a ring of powerful friends in the organization that might well outlasteven Taluud.</p>
<p>But no matter what else she had planned or what she felt like or wanted to do,when the big man called, which he could at any hour of any day, she was expectedto drop everything and show up, always looking her very best. This was just sucha time. The fact that it was three in the morning on a weekend did not meananything particular to her. Taluud was in his penthouse, clothed in a fancydressing gown, sitting in his big, overstaffed chair and puffing on an importedcigar. The cigar was as much a badge as a habit; he went through a dozen a day,and a box of them was close to the average annual wage of a Cloptan. Around himwere a half dozen fully dressed lieutenants, all of whom she'd known intimatelyin the past, and one fellow in the chair opposite who was anything but properlydressed and looked like he'd just crawled out of a sewer after battling angrycrocodiles. Other than Taluud, he was the only one seated, which was unusualonly in that usually nobody sat in Taluud's inner sanctum but he. She stoodthere, taking in the scene and wondering what it was all about.Taluud in turn looked straight at her and took his cigar from his mouth to useas a pointer. "Glad you could get here so fast, doll. This guy here is Sluthor.Up until a few days ago he was transport chief at the complex. He tells me agoddamned army just blew it to shit."</p>
<p>Campos's lower bill dropped a bit. "But Genny, that's impossible?'A clenched hand came down so hard on the coffee table that the table almostbroke. "You bet it's impossible! Not only was that place a fortress, but weowned the Agon military!" he shouted. "But it did happen! And only a few of ourpeople got away. They're struggling in now from Liliblod in ones and twos, alllooking at least as bad as Sluthor here. I been on the communicator the last twohours to the capital, and you know what, nobody's in who knows nothin'! You hearme, doll? Nobody's in! To me!"</p>
<p>"I-I don't understand." Campos had a very bad feeling about this that had littleto do with the mere loss of even such a wonder as the complex. "Well, neither do I. I got one of our people in the capital to go into Zone andget some face-to-face answers, but he ain't back yet. Too soon to get manydetails, but we got some basic stuff from Sluthor and the others straggling in.It ain't just the loss of the complex-we can always build more-and nobody therewas so important we couldn't afford to lose 'em, but how in the name of the sixhells of Dashli did they have the fuckin' guts to do this?"</p>
<p>Slowly, through the big man's tirades, what little was known came out. They'd suspected for some time that something was up, something not at all good,but they'd never expected anything on this scale. This kind of scale would takeapproval by and the active support of the council, yet nobody on it had warnedthem or tipped a hand. Instead, they'd given full authority and support to theraiders under an overzealous cop who'd been neutralized, or so it had seemed. Campos thought it over. "Sounds like somebody very big and very powerful but noton our side got the idea that some of the council was bent," she suggested. "Andthe ones that were had to save their own tails by letting this go through. Ifthey'd tipped anybody, it would have been a sure sign they were bent, so theyhad to let it go. It's the only thing that makes sense."</p>
<p>Taluud nodded approvingly. "That's what I figure, too. The question is, Just howmuch and how many are they willin' to sell out to cover themselves? They hadtheir own man, one of them jelly blobs from the south, in on it. Probably to getin there and protect their asses by deleting the records. That we know becausewe knew about him before, and he suddenly shows up there just before the raid.The question is, What are the others doin' there?"</p>
<p>She blinked. "Others? I don't understand."</p>
<p>"Them two horse-assed girls, the goat girl with the four tits, and, with thejelly blob, some unknown type ape girl who don't say a word and somebody else wenever got a handle on. Thing is, our people reported to the complex that allthese critters had one thing in common: They all knew each other. Even the jellyblob. Word was that every single one of 'em had come in from offworld and gonethrough the Well. Just like you."</p>
<p>Now she understood why she was here and what this was about. "You mean they'reall there? Together?"</p>
<p>"Pretty much. Who knows if there are any missing. We already had run a check on'em. The two horse asses and Four Tits got there on one of our courier boats.They been snoopin' around for months but weren't much of a threat. Seems theywere there lookin' for somebody-God knows why else you'd stay in that lizardheaven. Somebody snatched off the same courier boat. Another of their own, mostlikely. Sluthor did a check on the ones that stayed in Agon. None of 'em seemsto have come in with you, and none of 'em seem to have any connection with youother than comin' from the same planet once. That goes for the jelly blob, too.That's in your favor. But I know you went down there and did a lot of checking awhile back. Where's the ones who came here with you?"</p>
<p>She thought a moment, realizing that there was great danger here. The wholetruth might cause nasty problems, but a lie could be deadly-or worse. She neededtime, and Gen wasn't giving her any. Maybe a half-truth was best… for now. "I was a prisoner when I was dragged here. You know that," she reminded him."Right at that time I hadn't realized how good I had it, and I was boiling forrevenge. Two of the sorry bitches who got me into that fix were on one of ourboats and heading right here. I couldn't resist. I'm sorry, Genny, I justcouldn't resist, particularly after I visited the cells and saw what they weredoing down there. It seemed like heaven had delivered my enemies into my hands.I… persuaded Arn Gemalk, who was head of security then, to divert the boat,have them taken off at the pickup point, and delivered to the docs at thecomplex. I wanted revenge, and just killing them seemed not nearly enough at thetime."</p>
<p>Taluud nodded, interested but not apparently upset at this. "And what did theydo to them?"</p>
<p>'Turned them into couriers, I suppose. The idea was to make them live out therest of their miserable lives as cutoff monsters serving what they hated." "And you don't know what they became or where they are now? The odds are theywere the trigger for this-now, don't worry your pretty self about that! Youdidn't do nothing to them I wouldn'ta done myself. Thing was, though, the horseasses were doin' a favor, trackin' one of 'em for the council, so when they werelifted, it went straight to the top. There was too much heat, and after a whilethey couldn't stall it anymore. Yeah. This all fits together now. Shit, I wonderif we can find that pair and give 'em to them. Might take the heat off.Otherwise they're givin' the cops and patrol and all the excuse to take us outbase by base, station by station."</p>
<p>"Beg pardon, sir, but even if we could track them down, they will hardly be in acondition to be recognized. Would it make any difference?" one of thelieutenants asked worriedly.</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah, it would. They wouldn't like gettin' back two freaks, but they'dhave what they was after, anyway. Provin' who they were is just a matter of anew translator. Even if somehow they could talk or they got one of themmind-reader races to get through, what could they tell? We're still in theclear, right? And they get what's left of who they're after."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't they soon be in agony from lack of their variety of the weed?" Camposasked him. "It might not be much of a victory to hand them over." "Even dead, they'd be found," Taluud noted. "But the weed's no problem. We foundthat the ones who go through that monster stuff get immune to it over time.Don't matter. We got much better control by that point, anyway." So they don't need the drug anymore. Interesting. ''But how would you tell whoand what they were, let alone where?" Campos asked him. "I mean, once they'reprocessed, I thought they were just assigned and all traces of them erased." "Yeah, well, they don't exist, true, but people got memories. Maybe they can'tbe found, maybe not," the boss responded. "How many we done of these? A hundred,give or take. Not too many, and there was always a contingency plan just in casefor a lot of things, including them doctors. Sluthor says they were in theirclinic on the coast and not at the complex when it was raided. If they managedto give their tails the slip before the cops moved in, they'll be on a courierboat right now headin' for a safe hideout west of here. They may have to dodgesome patrols, but they should be there before any muscle gets in these parts,and maybe they remember these two. Neither of them was from races we seeanywhere in these parts, if I remember. You remember what they were, doll?" "One was a male from somewhere far off; I think it was Erdom or something likethat. The other was still the same as when she left our old world. I understandthey're called something here, but nobody seems to know much about them." "Glathrielian," Sluthor said tiredly. "I've been trying to think of it myself.That's what they called the apelike female who came in with the Leeming." Campos was suddenly very interested, enough to dampen her fear although notenough to make her disregard the sense of danger. "This was a female of the sametype? Dark skin, perhaps, no body hair to speak of except on the head andcrotch?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that is pretty much a good description of the pictures I saw. Do you knowher, then?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know her. She is the one I truly hoped to get my hands on, but she wasnot with the others."</p>
<p>"Well, you lay off her now, period!" Taluud told her firmly. "She's untouchable.History. They may even have an idea that she'll draw you out. You don't go nearher, you hear me? We may all have to disappear for a while until this blowsover. Keep your bags packed and be ready for a call. They lure you with her andnail you, the next stop's right here!"</p>
<p>"I doubt if I'd get the chance at her unless it was a trap," Campos sighed."Still, it's too bad. I could have had such fun with her."</p>
<p>"What's the point? Sluthor here says she don't talk and is like some braindamage case. Besides, it's gonna be a while before we can use those docs againno matter what."</p>
<p>Campos nodded. "I know. But she's unchanged, and I know from the other that theweed will work particularly well with that kind. Make her an addict, put her ona leash, walk her around like a pet… It would be very satisfying." "Yeah, well, get that out of your head now. No personal vendettas while we gotbigger trouble. Besides, you already got a pet. That big ugly bird, right?" "No, I gave her to the zoo," Campos told him, suddenly nervous that two and twowould be assembled in the room. "They are quite rare, and the zoo is going tobreed her."</p>
<p>Fortunately, it never occurred to the gang leader to consider that the processdidn't always create monsters or sterile mules, either. "Yeah, well, no more ofthat. We got enough trouble from this missing pair if we're guessin' right. Allwe need is a third to vanish and we may have to bury ourselves, and I do meanbury."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't dream of doing anything without your permission, Genny. You knowthat."</p>
<p>"And you better hadn't, not anymore. Still, bad as it is, we got a few days toplay with here; let's not panic. Ain't no raiding army in Clopta yet-theycouldn't keep that from me. Figure if they didn't find their friends in thecomplex, then this is where they'll head, though. Take 'em a few days to sweatthe details, a few more to get here by boat, a few more than that to set upthings so's they can move here. We got at least a week. If they got away, themdocs should be in before that, so we may get a jump on the law in finding thatmissing pair. Also send out the word. Anybody who remembers them when they wasin the complex or being seasoned, they tell us just what they are and where theymight have gone. Get on it!"</p>
<p>There was a chorus of "Yes, sirs!" and it was clear that the meeting was over. Campos remained for a bit, wondering if Taluud had anything else for her andhoping to get more information, but the boss dismissed her. "Get lost, doll. Gohome, pack, and stay close to the phone. I got calls to make." She turned andwalked out.</p>
<p>By the time she emerged at street level from the private elevator, she'd alreadystarted to think about things on her own. What if somebody remembered that shehad been there for the whole process? What if the doctors had backup records orclear memories of just what they had done? Taluud was no dummy; he would figureout that she'd been holding out on him and already knew the information hewanted. Then life would get really unpleasant. But she didn't want to turn themover, particularly not Mavra Chang. Campos wasn't fooled by the drooling servileact, not now that she knew that the bird bitch wasn't even addicted anymore andhad never let on. Chang in the zoo or under her control was one thing: Changwith a voice and a mind was something else, even if she stayed a bird. There wassomething too familiar, deep down, about that bitch. Given the chance, MavraChang would spare nothing to arrange a similar fate for Juana Campos. But why was the council, the kind of United Nations of this world, so worked upabout Chang and the Erdomite? The Erdomite was just somebody with that newscrew; he couldn't be important in the long run to anybody. But Chang-that"goddess" stuff, playing jungle Indian high priestess…</p>
<p>She had been pretty damned sophisticated when she had gotten here. Those Indian bitches had thought that she was immortal, that she'd been therelike forever. Stupid superstition from the dumb-ass Stone Agers? It had seemedso. But what if…</p>
<p>What if those rumors of her being some kind of creature who could work the wholedamned Well World had been true? They'd recalled the wanted bulletins, said shewas just a minor player for the guy they were really looking for. but maybe thatwas a blind.</p>
<p>First they said she was some kind of real god if she got inside, then they saidshe wasn't really. What if the first story had been true? What if Mavra Changcould somehow get inside whatever ran this world and do pretty much whatever sheliked to everybody and everything? And they got afraid that somebody else,somebody like Genny, would snatch her and somehow make her do what Genny wantedwhen she was there…</p>
<p>That would explain everything that had happened, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>If they find out my birdie is Mavra but don't figure out the rest, they'll giveher back. Sooner or later she'll get away, get in there, one way or another, butthey won't care what she orders for a Juana Campos.</p>
<p>In the hands of Genny and the cartel things might be even worse. Even if shecould somehow talk her way around the deception, which was highly questionable,they would be playing for all the power, not her. A world remade by Gennywouldn't be a fit place for anybody. Not with that kind of power. He'd go nuts.If he made a deal and they ran things together, it would be even worse. Twonuts. And no place at all for Juana Campos.</p>
<p>But what to do? What to do? In a couple of days, a week at best, it would be outof her hands if she just let events take their course.</p>
<p>Wait a minute! Maybe there is a way out of this! She walked down the darkened,rain-slicked street, deserted at this hour, the only sound the sound of herheels clicking on the hard pavement.</p>
<p>What if she did her own vanishing act? By the time Genny figured it out, theshit would be hitting the fan here. And if she had her two treasures with her,there'd be nothing to stop the cops. They'd come after the organization herelike that army'd gone through the complex she'd thought impenetrable. Lookingfor her, most likely. If she'd checked up on them, they had to know that she washere. They had probably already figured it out; they just needed the clout tocome after her.</p>
<p>But what if neither she nor they were here? The cartel would be underground forquite a while, particularly in this region. But to where? And how? Liliblod would be out of the question. She'd never felt comfortable in thatcreepy place, anyway, and right now it'd be even worse. Likewise, nowhere inClopta would be safe. By ship? Too risky, and if they tracked her, she'd betrapped with the goods. Due north was Quilst. She didn't know much about it, butit was nontech, so it would be damned hard to trace her, and she was prettyfamiliar with roughing it in primitive conditions far worse than she'd seenhere. Lori ate mostly grass and shrubs now, and Mavra ate bugs and carrion. Nota real supply problem. Lori could haul stuff, and if it got so Mavra couldn'tfind anything to eat, then Lori might be a good feed if need be. But what if the Quilst was as nasty as or nastier than Liliblod? She needed toknow. There were semitech hexes to the east and west, which might do. She neededinformation, and the first thing to find out was if Lori was an option at all.She didn't have much time-maybe a day or two. First thing to do was to check onLori. If he wasn't in when she was ready to leave, the hell with him. She'd geta real horse or something like it. A few weeks, or maybe months, away, justmarking time, would be worth it. After they'd scoured Clopta and Genny and hisgang were history, she could come back. Maybe not to Buckgrud but to one of theother big cities where she could lose herself or, better yet, to the northwest,where there were farms and ranches. She had a number of IDs in the system. Cutand dye her hair, do a few other things, and she might just get away with it. If she had Terry in her clutches, it would be just perfect, but one couldn'thave everything. Not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>The clicking of her heels sounded for all the world like the ticking of a clock.A clock counting down the window of opportunity…</p>
<p>She had a lot of calls to make.</p>
<p>Lori had tried to keep track of how long the nightmare journey had taken, buteither exhaustion or the creeping dullness in his mind had made it impossible.It certainly seemed like forever, particularly with that very heavy bastard onhis back urging him on and making him miss needed water and food stops. Still, the guy had to sleep and drink, too, so there'd been just enough of abreak to survive. How much did these ducklike things weigh, anyway? Still, once in the warehouse, he'd slept the sleep of the dead, and when he wokeup, still feeling pain in every joint, he was at least able to eat and drink. Still totally confused by what had happened and why he was back here instead ofthere, he nonetheless started to get the idea that things weren't normal on thisend, either. There were lots of Cloptans around, including many he'd never seenbefore. They were all frantically loading stuff into huge vans that pulled upone after the other, and he realized that they were emptying the place. Maybe the good guys finally won one, he thought hopefully. Not that it would dohim much good. They were clearly just shifting operations for a while, and wheredid mat leave him? Either they'd shoot him or they'd take him with them to puton some other courier run. It wouldn't even matter if somebody found him. Whatwould they see? A nice little horse with a horn, that was all. Too small forreal horse work and, as a gelding, not handy for any other reason. How could heeven contact somebody else to tell them he was more than he seemed? More important, would it make any difference? It was getting harder and harderto remember things. Not just little things, big things. Before he was a horsehe'd been a man, but a man who did what? He had memories of a desert and sometent towns and a city by a big wall, and he remembered a woman of the same race,but even she was kind of blurry. And before that there had been someone,something else, but that was so distant and so confusing, he wasn't sure aboutit. He tried frantically to think, to remember. I'm not a horse! I'm a… But he was a horse. He couldn't get around that. No matter who or what he'dbeen, he was now a horse. He was always going to be a horse. What was the use offighting it, of dredging up those old memories, of worrying about things that hecould not do anything about?</p>
<p>Someone… somebody else… had struggled with a big change, and it haddriven them nuts. The woman. And when they'd stopped fighting and accepted whoand what they were, they were finally able to find some happiness, to stoptorturing themselves.</p>
<p>Maybe that was it. Maybe he should just stop trying to be anything else andaccept it. Stop the thinking, the remembering, the deep thoughts. Just…live. If he was going to just be a horse, what would his wants be? Food, water,sleep, and maybe a little care and grooming by somebody nice. What else could heever want or need? Nothing these men had. Nothing anybody had that he couldimagine.</p>
<p>Then why did he feel such a sense of loss? That was why he'd been searchingaround in those memories, but while he could come up with all sorts of memories,episodes, and mental pictures, he couldn't come up with anything any of thosepast lives had offered that seemed at all important or interesting to him now.All it seemed like was an endless search to find things he hadn't had. But he'dnever really found them, he knew that, because he had never been sure what hewanted.</p>
<p>And now, here he was, and he knew exactly what he needed and wanted, and thesimple things on the list didn't go beyond the basics. Maybe what he'd lost wereall those problems and worries. His big problem now was that he hadn't beenthinking like a horse.</p>
<p>With that idea in mind, he drifted back to sleep, but it was a lot easier todecide on this course than to stop the dreams.</p>
<p>The Quilst were a kind of cross between animals and plants, it seemed. Thepictures made them look like walking, talking turnips who ate dirt. They weren'tsaid to be particularly hostile, but they didn't really build roads and seemedto spend most of their time training hordes of insects to do stuff. Maybe thedata was true, but the fact that the Quilst hadn't even put a Zone ambassadordown south in recent memory meant that if the information was out of date, shewas up the creek there.</p>
<p>The Betared were those horrid little bear things. They were well involved withthe cartel at the highest levels, but they all had the temperaments of Genny ona bad day. The Mixtim looked like giant multicolored grasshoppers, but theysupposedly had taken steam energy to its highest levels. They were so totallyomnivorous that they could, and did, eat almost anything, but aside from oftendisturbing visitors with their culinary tastes, they weren't threatening andwere very civilized, if specialized, like lots of insect cultures. She'd neverseen or heard of one with the cartel, though, and they certainly looked like thebest of a bad lot. Even if it proved less than inviting even for a getaway,Mixtim was well located with a variety of other hexes available. They'd also take international credits there, which they used for trade, so atleast it would provide options. Mix tun it was, then.</p>
<p>Now a haircut, and a dye job, some practical working clothes, and a bit of anidentity switch, and she'd be ready to reclaim her little living treasures. Shehoped the zoo wouldn't be too sticky about it, but if they were, then there wereother ways.</p>
<p>First, though, she went down to the warehouse, which was getting pretty wellcleaned out. "Moving the stuff offshore mostly, to islands and to boats, untilthis blows over," one of the supervisors told her.</p>
<p>"I called earlier. They said you had a courier come in, looks like a pony?" "Yeah, he's in the back there. We have no instructions on what to do with him." "I'll take him," she told them. "Mister Taluud is looking for specific couriersfor some reason and doesn't want any harmed or lost until he finds what he'slooking for. I'll take full responsibility."</p>
<p>The supervisor shrugged. "Fine with me. One more worry off my shoulders. Butwhat are you gonna do with him, lady? You can't put a horse up in downtownBuckgrud, and you sure can't take him into an apartment." She laughed. "Let thatbe my problem. Just show me to him."</p>
<p>Lori was only half-asleep when Campos walked into the rear stall area, and whenhis vision cleared and he saw who it was, he felt sudden fear and loathing. Thiswas not the kind and gentle groom of his needs!</p>
<p>"Hello, Lori," Campos said, almost as if she were greeting an old friend. "Timefor us to go."</p>
<p>It was so strange to hear words, whole sentences, that he could comprehend thatit shocked him out of his stupor for a bit. "Go where?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you can still speak! Well, that will make things even easier." But he couldn't, not like before. He no longer had the physical equipment tomake the variety of sounds necessary for the translator to pick up. Still, thedevice worked by direct implant into the brain, so as long as something cameout, however much it was like a whinny or a gurgle, the whole thought camethrough.</p>
<p>"We have to leave this place soon. Tonight, I hope. I have much to do myself,but I have a place for you to stay until I am ready. I'm taking you to a nicepark where you'll be tied up but able to eat and drink and relax in the openair. There's a nice old fellow there who'll see that you're all right until Ican come back for you. It's a very nice day to be outside, anyway. Later onwe're going to take a train ride, at least part of the way. Right now, just you,me, and our old mutual friend."</p>
<p>"Friend?"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed. I wouldn't dream of leaving without the pride of my littlecollection!"</p>
<p>Mavra Chang was not having a very pleasant existence, but she was in far morecommand of herself than Lori had been.</p>
<p>Then again, Lori had never been this low before. Mavra, as she was remembering,had been so low sometimes that this seemed downright optimistic. And of course,Lori might not have much of a future. Mavra knew she'd have that, or at leastshe hoped so, depending on where the hell Nathan was.</p>
<p>That was her greatest fear. If Nathan had made it inside the Well, maybe she wasstuck like this and doomed to die. Somehow, though, she didn't believe it. Shewas still getting information, memories from the Well data base as she thoughtof them, and going over bits and pieces of her past long forgotten. Nathan sureas hell would have cut that if he'd already been there.</p>
<p>Maybe he was having as much trouble as she was, she thought hopefully. Still, this was not a promising beginning. The Buckgrud Zoo was state of theart, but that meant that she'd been placed in a large area with few places tohide. A large, fake, hollowed-out tree was the only real place of escape, but ithad little in the way of maneuvering room inside it. Around it was an area aboutten meters square with a heavy glass or glasslike window on one side and verydark walls on the other three. The lighting let people see inside but to herlooked like a cloudy night.</p>
<p>The glass was coated with some sort of nonreflective substance, and she couldnot see herself in it or see much beyond, although if she went up very close,she could barely make out a variety of overdressed giant ducks gawking at her.She couldn't help wondering how many times, if any, Campos had been by just togloat. There was water in a simulated spring and small pool, and there was food. That was the worst part, the food. Live insects, mostly worms and crawlers, wereintroduced several times a day, along with an occasional carcass of somethingthat might have been an unfortunate zoo accident or roadkill for all she knew.The problem wasn't that she was going around gulping down the squirming crittersor picking at the festering dead meat. She'd long since passed the point ofbeing revolted at that aspect.</p>
<p>The problem was, she really liked them.</p>
<p>What she didn't like was how even the apartment and its window had offered moreattractions than this dump, which was so boring, it risked driving her into themadness she'd been fighting all this time. The only entrance or exit was at thetop of the cage, a good four meters beyond her head. The occasional cageattendant would come in now and then on a rope ladder, which was impossible forher to manage, without arms to hold on to it with. The ladder was taken up whenthey left, anyway. The glass was as thick and unbreakable as she'd ever seen,and there wasn't a chance of getting through it.</p>
<p>She was even more worried that they were going to breed her with a male, asCampos had threatened. It was what zoos did, after all, but what would it do toher? She still had her mind, she could think as a human even if the thoughtswere dulled by who knew how long in this incredible boredom, but if she just lether mind wander into fantasy, the bird genes just took over. What if theybrought in a male whatever it was and she got knocked up? Would she startbuilding -a nest and sitting on eggs and thinking about little squawkers? The Well was notorious for not making it easy, but damn it, it shouldn't make itimpossible. But try as she might, she hadn't been able to see a single way outof this mess.</p>
<p>What was even more depressing, was that if there was a way for her to get free,flat out she could make maybe a hundred meters an hour, and not for very long.She would also need to spend a lot of time keeping the metabolism going withfood. No wonder this bird was rare. Figuring at maybe a kilometer a day if shewas lucky, she could make the Avenue and the equator in, oh, maybe three or fouryears under absolutely perfect conditions. Yeah.</p>
<p>And so she was quite startled when, in the early evening after the zoo hadclosed for the day, she heard the cage door open and saw not the usual attendantor the vet but the new model Campos climb down the ladder.</p>
<p>"Hello, my pretty birdie," she said with mock concern. "You needn't play withme. I know you don't need the drug anymore, and I'm not someone to trifle withright now."</p>
<p>"Are you here to taunt me?" Mavra asked her, despondent as ever. "Oh, my, no! In fact, I am here as your liberator, believe it or not. It seemsthat you have become too popular for your own good and are far too valuable tobe left in a musty old zoo. We are going on a little trip, you and I, along withmy other pretty little treasure, and we will not be back for quite a while." "You're taking me out of here?" Mavra's heart soared, even though she didn'texpect to be going to a nicer place.</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed. In fact, Algon, he's a nice attendant here, will help you up outof the cage. He is a sucker for a pretty face and a few credits. Here. Get intothis netting, and then I will tell him to pull you up."</p>
<p>Mavra suddenly felt a little contrary. "You can't lift me. What if I refuse?" "Refuse? You mean you like it in here?"</p>
<p>"Not particularly, but they feed me regularly. You wouldn't go to all thistrouble if you just needed to skip town. Somebody's got a line on what you didto me, haven't they?"</p>
<p>"You are quite sophisticated for a jungle primitive, aren't you? Yes, myprecious, they are looking for you, but it will do you no good to hope. Even ifthey found you, you would just be kept here in a cage much like this. They mighteven keep you right here, although with a much better lock. I suspect, however,they would take you south, perhaps very far south. I, on the other hand, amgoing north, at least for now. Better the devil you know than the devil you donot." Her tone grew suddenly lower, more menacing. "Besides, you little shit, ifyou don't do it right now I will take one of these rocks, beat you intounconsciousness, and roll you into it. Now, get in!"</p>
<p>Mavra didn't have any doubts about Campos doing exactly that, so she complied.Out and going north… There was some hope again. Maybe she was too hard on theWell. One had to have patience with the gods before they answered one's prayers. Algon took her, still in the netting, and placed her in a box with air holesthat sat on a rolling cart. Soon they were out into the night air and, withAlgon's passkey, out of the zoo and onto the street. The air felt good, althoughshe was frustrated at being so completely and literally boxed in. For somebody sneaking out of town, Campos certainly had a lot of help that couldreveal her plans no matter what bribes she'd paid. First she was put in the backof a small truck that was certainly driven by somebody else, since Camposremained with her. There were also a number of cases and a steamer trunk. They stopped after a while and shortly loaded on what certainly sounded and,from the tiny bit visible through the air holes, looked for all the world like asmall horse.</p>
<p>"You're sure you're not too conspicuous?" Mavra commented, but it was ignored. More hands unloaded them, and then the box was opened, but only to cut away thenetting and transfer Mavra to an even larger box, one apparently designed totransport live animals. Inside was a fair quantity of raw meat and a gadget thatwould give her water in small amounts.</p>
<p>"Just relax," Campos told her. "You will be in there for a long time, but weshall meet up again before you run out of food and water, I promise you." "Meet up again? Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"The same place you are, only by a different route. I have no time for questionsor need to give answers to such as you." And with that, the box was sealed andbegan moving again.</p>
<p>Mavra could hear Campos speaking with others, but since the conversation wasn'tdirected to her, it wasn't picked up by the translators.</p>
<p>She was puzzled, no, totally confused. What in the hell was this maniac doing? If Mavra was confused, Lori was even more so. For one thing, two female Cloptanshad shown up in the park later that day and had set up for what looked like ahorse bath and rubdown. It turned out to be a dye job; his pretty beige and allthe rest were now jet black, and his mane and tail were snow white. Even thehorn had been painted black, and it still smelled awful.</p>
<p>Then Campos had come with the van, loaded with a number of cases and baggage,and eventually had unloaded it at a freight stop on the Cloptan high-speed trainline. He was collared there, and a whole bunch of routing tags were attached toit, then he was led onto a livestock flatcar which also contained a large numberof animals that looked like a cross between a cow and a camel but with a kind ofrounded, platypuslike bill. In a very short time the train began to pull outinto the darkness.</p>
<p>The first time they unloaded Mavra Chang's box and reloaded it onto anothertrain, she had a glimmer of what was going on.</p>
<p>She was being transshipped over half the damned hex, on one freight, then onanother, in a pattern that probably looked like a baby with a crayon had createdit. All of the other stuff was being shipped the same way, but on differenttrains, and it all seemed to be designed to eventually wind up somewheretogether. Shipping agents, working from wired instructions, would reroute thepackages so that no one would know the final destination or be able to easilytrace them.</p>
<p>It was amazing what money and a computer could do, she thought. The fact remained, though, that if she was attempting a getaway with everything,including Mavra, then she was traveling very heavy, and if she stayed in ahigh-tech hex, they would eventually track her down. That meant lowering thetechnology standard, but to do so with this much stuff would be pretty rough fora Cloptan female on her own. That one horse certainly wouldn't do the job. Mavra's train reached the end point first, and she sat there, now inside awarehouse, the only sounds occasional trains whirring past outside. She wonderedwhat was coming next and how Juana Campos figured on pulling this off. Shedidn't mind the wait; that was all she'd been doing for a long time, anyway, butthat had been waiting for nothing. Now something was happening. Things weremoving again, and so was she.</p>
<p>That was worth waiting for.</p>
<p>Just before dawn some automated equipment unloaded several cartons, and theywere placed very near Mavra's box. She guessed they were the rest of the stufffrom the van. Now all that was lacking was the horse.</p>
<p>It wasn't lacking for long. Just as the sun was starting to come up, Mavra heardthe sound of hooves clicking on the hard floor of the warehouse and picked upthe unmistakable scent of live horseflesh.</p>
<p>Lori, now tied up to a metal stake near the boxes, was totally confused. Allnight it was on one train, then onto another, going back and forth, andsometimes, he was sure, on the same train over and over. Unlike Mavra, he didn'tlike it or understand it one bit.</p>
<p>None of them had long to wait after Lori at last arrived. Whether on a scheduleor because the loadmaster didn't like having a horse fouling up his nicewarehouse floor, a crew entered and began transferring everything once more. In the daylight, even with his poor vision, Lori could see that they were atsome kind of border stop. On the other side of the sleek magnetic strip thatserved as Cloptan train tracks there was a very different looking building andbeyond it a very different looking terminal. It was a little hard to see aswell, as if he were looking through a discolored gauze curtain. A hex boundary! And not the one to Liliblod, either!</p>
<p>The Cloptan crew and its robotic equipment moved everything across right to theborder. The boxes were then put down flush with it and pushed across slowly bysmall rams that came out from the equipment. Lori alone was led through, feelingthe familiar tingle as he passed into a new hex, and then he could see moreclearly what was beyond.</p>
<p>It was suddenly chilly. Not cold, but there was a definite chill in the air. andsigns of light frost were still around, slow to melt in the rising run. Lorididn't really feel the cold, but it was still something of a shock. More of a shock was the crew that awaited them on the other side. They were bugs. Huge bugs. And not just huge bugs but bugs of just about allshapes and sizes, the smallest still the size of an alley cat. They were quite colorful creatures, and the two that were enormous, at least twometers long and standing taller than Lori, looked like nothing he'd ever seeneven in a nightmare or in the Amazonian jungles. They seemed closest to prayingmantises.</p>
<p>He was scared, nervous, and yet somewhat excited and didn't even realize all theold memory connections he was suddenly making again.</p>
<p>A big beetlelike thing crawled up to the pallets on which the boxes rested andwith two whiplike hind limbs took the lead pallet and started pulling iteffortlessly toward the station beyond. Other, similar creatures did the samewith the rest. Finally another, who looked more like a bipedal grasshopper,approached Lori, who shied but couldn't pull away, being tied to a post. But thething didn't eat him; instead, it wordlessly untied him and began to lead himafter the boxes.</p>
<p>The railroad warehouse was a wonder of cogs, levers, belts, pulleys, and othersuch automation, all of which was apparently driven by external steam plants andwhich rumbled and hissed and gave off occasional steam through vents. Steam alsoseemed to heat the place, at least somewhat; it was certainly warmer here. Overcoming his fear and revulsion at the sight of the giant insects, Lori beganto watch them work with fascination. They all looked so very different, yet hebegan to wonder if in fact they really were. Each seemed to be physicallydesigned almost as a tool would be designed, to do one or two specific taskswell. The big low ones were the strong-arm types, the longshoremen who couldmove and lift loads much larger and heavier than they. Sleek, small, fast bugswent up and down the conveyors and pipes, oblivious to whether they were rightside up or upside down, apparently checking to make sure that everything wasoperating properly.</p>
<p>The big praying mantis types were primarily lifters, almost like living dockyardcranes using huge mandibles that form-fitted into specially designed containers. Suppose an insect society, many of which had different specialized varietiesanyway, could really breed and design to order or need? Each individual hatched,shaped, and endowed with the capabilities to do specific jobs and serve thewhole? That obviously was what was here.</p>
<p>It was an ideal tiling for a nontech hex, but the steam power and degree ofautomation said this was semitech. The bugs of the industrial age, adapted tofit the new requirements.</p>
<p>If they were as durable and as prolific breeders as most bugs, this was a racethat might well be able to survive and even thrive anywhere, under almost anyconditions.</p>
<p>Outside, both Lori and Mavra could hear the shrill sounds of steam whistleslarge and small going off and the rhythmic chug chug chug unique to one kind ofmechanical marvel moving about.</p>
<p>Steam locomotives.</p>
<p>Neither was aware of the other's identity or proximity, although there waslittle they could have done about it had they known, yet both suddenly sharedthe same thought.</p>
<p>The crazy dance of the trains might not yet be over.</p>

<p>Another Part of the Field</p>
</title>
<empty-line/>
<p>Gen Ttaluud was very uncomfortable in the presence of the colonel, but he neededinformation and needed it bad. He might have some business to do with this jellyblob if the answers were right.</p>
<p>"It was a complete disaster," the colonel told him. "They even managed toprevent me from destroying a great deal of the computer files. Fortunately, Idid manage to eliminate information on certain major figures and also somedetails of the divisions within the hexes such as yours."</p>
<p>"You think that'll help me?" Taluud thundered. "Hell, everybody there knows me,and so does everybody here. I ain't in the quiet part of the business, you know.If they'd flush something as big as the complex down the toilet, they wouldn'tthink twice of flushin' me along with it." He bit off the end of a cigar andspat it out with such force, it traveled halfway across the room. "So what's theprice, Colonel? What in hell will get 'em off my back?"</p>
<p>"As you surmised, the pair kidnapped by Campos, and particularly one, MavraChang. Find them, rum them over, and you are likely to find the pressure turnedwell down, so much so that you might well be back in business within six monthsto a year at best."</p>
<p>"Then we'll find 'em!"</p>
<p>"Um, yes. That is a priority. The question is, Do we really wish to turn themover to the council when we do?"</p>
<p>"Huh? What in hell does that mean? Of course we do. You think I want to beruined?"</p>
<p>The colonel had considered his course on the journey here, accomplished mostlyby sea and not without its own danger. Leemings had great power on land, but inthe water they were helpless, and in salt water they could not help but absorbgreat quantities and sink like stones. Even these amorphous creatures needed tobreathe oxygen, and they were not equipped to fashion working gills. "Mister Taluud, have you thought beyond what's happening to consider why it'shappening? Why our mutual bosses would allow such a catastrophe?" "Savin" their own asses, that's all, just like everybody else." "In more ways than one. They are scared. They are frightened of something somuch that they are willing to pull down an important part of what they had builtwith such care and patience. This Mavra Chang isn't merely someone with a lot offriends. They would never have sacrificed the complex for as simple a reason asthat."</p>
<p>Gen Taluud really hadn't thought about it, but what the creature had said made alot of sense. "Go on."</p>
<p>"Let me tell you what they firmly believe about Mavra Chang," the colonel saidcalmly. "And I'll also tell you about my experiences with a man of the samerace. A man named Nathan Brazil."</p>
<p>Taluud listened, fascinated, not knowing whether to believe this stuff. Still,it was clear that the big shots, the rulers and politicians behind all this,were totally convinced, and they had greater resources than he did. Still, itwas hard to swallow.</p>
<p>"You really believe all that crap about her, Colonel? Honestly? And this guy whothey think is some kind of ancient god, too?"</p>
<p>"Does it matter, sir?"</p>
<p>"Huh? Whatddya mean?"</p>
<p>"Let's assume it's all true. Every word of it. You could never make a bargainwith that sort of creature. Even if you thought you had a deal, once inside, atthe all-powerful controls, what would bargains with mere mortals count for? Howwould you enforce the bargain? You see what I mean. There is no way we can allowher to actually get in, so it doesn't matter if I believe it or even if it istrue. It doesn't matter if you believe it, either. They believe it. The raid andthe massive actions still to come here prove that."</p>
<p>"Yeah, so what? What's that get us?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps a lot. If they got her, they'd just lock her away under guard withBrazil and try to keep them there until all that we know passed away. But whatif we had her? You and I, together. What if we had her and she was salted awaysafely in a place only we knew? Think of the possibilities. What do you want tobe? Emperor of Clopta? Governor general of the district? Permanent chiefcouncillor? No running, no fear of the law at any time because you are the law,secure in the position because if they don't give you everything you want, ifthey even dare to act against you, you can give one order and Chang will getinto the Well. You see the potential? You are a powerful man, but only in thiscity and to a lesser extent in Clopta. Like me, you still take orders from thosehigher up. The kind of people who are now selling you down the river, as itwere. Isn't it tempting to turn the tables and have them deferring to vom?" It was a masterful scheme, absolutely brilliant. Taluud's estimation of thecolonel went up a great deal in just that one moment. Only one thing made himhesitate.</p>
<p>"All very well, Colonel, but what do you get out of this? What's to stop youfrom just eating me and becoming ruler of the world yourself?" The colonel was ready for that one. "For one thing, I don't want to be ruler ofthe world. I think it would be far too much work to be fun. Much better to be anadviser to that ruler and have his ear when needed. No, sir, I don't want that.But you see, all my life I have taken orders. All my life I have servedgovernments and cartels and bowed to Don Francisco this and General Hernandothat. It's been no different here. I do their dirty work, I cover up theirmistakes, and still I am dependent on others. I am a man of modest and humblebeginnings. The army of my native land on my native world saved me from povertyand starvation. I worked my way up, doing whatever was necessary, whatever couldadvance me. I did not have the relatives, the connections, or the old militaryschool ties that counted. Finally, with the air corps, I managed to attainbasically the level I am at again here-but I was still subject to miserable payand the whims of my superiors, always with the sword at my neck. One ofthose-those high-and-mighty generals could in an instant declare me dangerous orpush me aside. When I got here, I had certain unique qualities and experienceand managed to achieve this level rather quickly, but I am still the servant,the outsider. I am not a native. I can never be at the top."</p>
<p>"What do you want, then, Colonel?" Taluud asked him with growing interest,wondering if he could trust any of this.</p>
<p>"I want to be the grand leader of Leeming, the most supreme general andpresident for life. A modest position of power compared to what you might attainbut more than enough for me. There are certain-characteristics, if you will-of aLeeming that have the potential for me to live a very long time and for a partof me to live on almost forever. Within my own land I would be absolute ruler.You would have all the rest."</p>
<p>Taluud thought it over. Maybe the slime was telling the truth, maybe he wasn't,but Gen Taluud hadn't lived this long without being able to judge when a fellowas unencumbered with morals as he himself told stories like that. Besides, hecould always get the bastard fried if it looked wrong.</p>
<p>"Very tempting. Colonel. Very tempting, indeed. But we're missing one thing tomake such a deal, and that's this what's her name. We don't even know where sheis or, at the moment, what she is."</p>
<p>"I know. Both from the computers and from the medical records of those curiousdoctors. She is an anuk, a very large wingless bird. They were quite proud ofher; the genetic remake was so complete, she is said to be capable ofreproducing-as an anuk, of course."</p>
<p>Taluud's cigar almost dropped from his fingers. "A what? A bird? How big a birddo you mean?"</p>
<p>"Oh, a meter, give or take a bit. About this high, I would say." A pseudopodshot out and hovered in the air.</p>
<p>"Why, that lyin', double-crossin' bitch! I'll fry her ass for this! Nobody doesthis to Gen Taluud!" He picked up the communicator. "Get me Campos. Now! No-waita minute! Go over there and pick her up-personally. I want her here in tenminutes, you hear?" The communicator slammed down.</p>
<p>"I gather you already know the location of our quarry," the colonel commented."How convenient."</p>
<p>"Yeah, maybe. Seems to me she said she'd given it away to someplace, but I can'tremember. Don't matter. She'll tell me anything I want to know soon enough." The communicator rang, and Taluud picked it up. "Yeah? What! Well, what aboutthe other two broads? Them, too? Shit!" He looked back at the colonel. "Theyflew the coop! All three of 'em flew the coop! Like they can hide from me!" "I would not underestimate this Campos. I have information that on the old worldJuan Campos was in some ways an equivalent to you here."</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah, I know, but he ain't got no control. I never trusted guys who gotto be big because their father was big. You work yourself up, you don't have toprove nothing."</p>
<p>"My point exactly with my own case," the colonel noted. "We agree on a greatdeal, sir. I believe this could be an excellent partnership."</p>
<p>"The zoo!"</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon?"</p>
<p>"She gave the bird to the zoo!"</p>
<p>A few calls brought the news that the zoo, too, had someone missing. He was backon the communicator again.</p>
<p>"Look, how tough can it be? Three broads and a bird the size of a teenage kid.You put the word out. Naw, they probably are outta here by now, maybe on aship-check all the docks and passenger and cargo manifests. Also check thetrains, border controls, you name it. They got to be somewhere, and I want the'where' and fast, hear?"</p>
<p>"I admire the way you move on things," the colonel said approvingly. The communicator signaled, and Taluud grabbed it. "Yeah? Well, you get movin' onthis other thing. As soon as you find 'em, you get a dozen of your best men andmeet me. We'll go after 'em personal. Then we pull the plug. Hear? First we wantthem girls. Period."</p>
<p>"What was that about, if I might ask?"</p>
<p>"Your buddies from Agon are here. They're in the capital right now, armed withlots of information on certain political types, and they're gonna have a prettyfree ride by tomorrow. The rats are deserting the ship up there and fallin' allover themselves to be helpful."</p>
<p>"My-'buddies,' as you call them. I assume this is the centaurs, the Erdomite,the Dahir, and the Glathrielian girl?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah. Them and that holier than thou Kurdon, too. I knew we shoulda madehim have an accident years ago! Well, that's what I get for bein' a softy! Nomore!"</p>
<p>"This-bird. It was well known?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, around here, anyways. It was so weird-lookin', anybody who saw itremembered it. Shit! Right under my nose! Right under my fuckin' nose!” "If even the more common elements in your own organization will remember it evenslightly, it is serious. And she was last in the zoo, too… Probably ondisplay. That means even more will remember. Honest, upright folks. We will notbe too far ahead of them, I fear."</p>
<p>"Maybe not. But if it's always ahead, I'll settle for a few steps. The onlyone's gonna laugh at the end of this is the one who winds up with the bird,right?"</p>
<p>"I would say that was a fair statement."</p>
<p>"Then we get there first."</p>
<p>"What of these other two females? Might they be with Campos? How much of aproblem might they be?"</p>
<p>"They're all looks, no brains. Campos was the one with the looks, brains, andguts. I don't know how she even got the other two to go along, but they're dumbenough to fall for a lot of stuff. Well, I'll fix all three of 'em when I get ahold of 'em!"</p>
<p>The communicator signaled. "Yeah? What? Oamlatt? That's on the border withMixtim! You sure she crossed over there? Absolutely positive? Yeah, well, it's alead. Let's get on it. We got anybody in Mixtim that's handy? Shit. Well, itshouldn't be brain surgery to find information. See what you can find out, ifyou can find anybody there who remembers a second woman, or a big bird, orwhatever. Call me back." The boss turned to the colonel. "Mixtim." "Problems?"</p>
<p>"One of the girls-not Campos, one of the others- arrived this morning. I saidthe other two weren't all that bright. She made a call back here just so's hersister wouldn't worry about her. They're sure she went over into Mixtim at theOamlatt border crossing. It's a rail intersection and trade center. Makessense."</p>
<p>The communicator buzzed.</p>
<p>"Yeah? A black pony? That don't sound like no bird!"</p>
<p>"Wait a minute!" the colonel said in an urgent tone. "Ask them if the pony had ahorn on its head."</p>
<p>"Hold it. Did the horse have a horn on its head? How do I know? Stickin' up, Iguess." There was a pause. "It did!" Taluud looked over at the colonel. "Okay,it did. So?"</p>
<p>"The other one. She's taking both of them with her!"</p>
<p>"You get to work on the Mixtim side. See if you can get any information ontrains and such. I want to know where they bought tickets to, hear?" He pressed a button on the communicator, then redialed another number. "Allright, we're on 'em. Have your team meet me at Central Station. Call ahead toOamlatt and make sure we have supplies for a long trip and the fire-power we'llneed that'll work there. Yeah, Oamlatt. They went into Mixtim, and we're gonnahave to go get 'em. You meet me at the station after gettin' that set, you hear?I'm pullin' the plug."</p>
<p>He looked at the colonel. "You like bugs?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Depends. Raw, boiled, or fried?" Colonel Lunderman responded.\ "Everybody's flown the coop," Kurdon told them. "It was to be expected, but I amstill disappointed. At any rate, we've broken the main connection for thisentire region for quite some time, and we have enough on the local boys bothhere and in Agon that it's unlikely to be restored on a scale like this in thenear future."</p>
<p>"You mean you've actually destroyed the cartel?" Julian asked, somewhat awed atthe concept. "Because of us?"</p>
<p>"Because of you we have hurt them, yes," the inspector agreed. "And we havegiven two hexes and perhaps many more in the area a breath of fresh air andcleanliness, which is more than I dared to hope when this began. As to thecartel, though, no. It is damaged but far too large and too spread out to bekilled. To truly kill it we would need a means to get at the ministers of manygovernments, to clean house at the very top. What we have gained is a bit oflocal joy and some pride; we have finally hurt them. But destroyed them? Hardly.You cut off a few heads from this kind of monster, it still has far more headsthan it needs. You cut off all its heads and somehow it grows new ones. Justwinning a battle of this magnitude is incredible, but the war? No. Take it froma career policeman. So long as there are greedy and power-hungry people at thetop and corruption festers, you cannot win. You play to tie, that is all." It was pretty depressing looked at that way.</p>
<p>"What about Mavra and Lori?" Gus asked him. "I mean, that was part of the reasonfor all this."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is, and the council is still very anxious to have them. But there is alimit to what I can do myself, and I am already overburdened here. My mainconcern is my own country, as you must understand. If I cannot cure theworldwide cancer, I can at least try my best to ensure that Agon becomes fullycancer-free. You will have whatever funds and authority you require and the aidof any official that you contact. It would be better to work through the localson this, anyway. They know their own territory."</p>
<p>"That certainly helps," Tony told him, "but I gather you mean that we're on ourown from this point."</p>
<p>"Hardly. As I say, this remains a top priority with the council. You will findcooperation along the line in most civilized areas, and we now have descriptionsand bulletins going out from Zone to governments throughout the Well World. Makeno mistake-we will find them."</p>
<p>"I want Campos," Gus said with a low growl. "I want Campos bad." "Then your next stop is Mixtim," Kurdon told them. 'Take the train to Oamlatt.I'll arrange for Cloptan authorities there to brief you on what we know so far.After that, you will have to pursue. Please do so. If they are chased, then theycannot stop, and if they do not stop, they are bound to be seen and reported. Ifthey do stop, you will be on them. I have seen you all work now, and I haveevery confidence in your abilities to do the job."</p>
<p>Gus sighed and looked at Terry. Damn it, he knew he should stop, but they wereso very close. And for Terry's sake as well as his own, he wanted Campos. He wanted to eat her alive.</p>

<p>Mixtim</p>
</title>
<empty-line/>
<p>IN THE ANCIENT TIMES WHEN THE WELL WORLD WAS OPERATED as a biological and sociallaboratory rather than simply existing, there was the problem of simulating thelimitations of real planets that would logically evolve such races andecosystems. In many cases that meant placing limitations within the hexes oneverything from the losses in electrical signals over a distance or whethercertain levels of technology would work at all. The semitech hexes had the mostvariations, but in all such places the great emphasis had been on steam. Mixtimhad a generally flat landscape and a somewhat dry continental climate where therains were seasonal and the rivers broad, fairly shallow, and winding. It was aland best suited for growing hardy crops, mostly grains, but without thepractical use of rivers to move large quantities of harvest from where it wasgrown to where it was needed.</p>
<p>The answer had been a vast network of steam-powered locomotives pulling longtrains of produce to and from major population centers and also to ports ofentry with neighboring hexes, where it could be traded for goods eitherimpossible to manufacture or not worth the trouble to make within the hex. Theywere sleek, fast trains like nothing ever seen on Earth, but they had theunmistakable sound and fury of the classic steam engine. The network wasparticularly remarkable because of the inability to use a telegraph or maintainthe integrity of an electrical signal through the tracks. Nonetheless, they hada fine safety record, and the trains of Mixtim ran on time.</p>
<p>In fact, it almost seemed as if the whole population were involved in running orservicing the trains. While the trains occasionally passed clusters of hightwisted mounds filled with teeming denizens of the insect world, after more thantwo hours there wasn't a sign of a major city and the villages they passed weremore likely trade centers and farming communities. On the other hand, thereappeared to be one every time two different rail lines crossed, and there werean awful lot of rail lines in Mixtim. Juana Campos was counting on that and thefact that they had little in the way of computers or even written records fornonroutine shipments. Everything like that was more or less off the book. The natives crammed into cars and resembled festering colonies, but there waslittle provision for visiting travelers. On the other hand, the Mixtimites hadplenty of surplus boxcars along every siding, and it was no problem at all tohook one on for special purposes.</p>
<p>The society was, as expected, totally communal, so there was no money or otherfavors exchanged for services, but outsiders were in fact valued and expected topay, the fees going to whatever local jurisdiction for the purpose of buyingimports. Some of these were specialized or customized farm tools and implementsor finely machined parts for irrigation systems, and some were as simple ascandy and other delicacies.</p>
<p>The largest import, however, was chemical fertilizer, and that made Mixtim andits railroad less than ideal for visitors. The Mixtimites, it seemed, either hadno sense of smell or liked the smell of it. The stench of fertilizer waseverywhere.</p>
<p>"This is totally gross," said Audlay, one of the two former roommates withCampos back in Buckgrud, as they sat on a layer of wheat or some kind of grasson the floor of a boxcar heading into the hex.</p>
<p>"Look at it this way. At least we won't have to worry about gaining weighthere," Kuzi, the other roommate, responded in a tone just short ofI-think-I-have-to-throw-up. "Quit complaining!" Campos snapped at them. "I don'tlike the smell any more than you do, but what do you want me to do about it? Youknew it would be rough when you decided to come along. You also knew when youcame that there was no going back. Not for a long while. Now, make the best ofit!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Juana," Audlay responded, sounding almost like a small child. Campos had dominated the other two since she'd moved in six months earlier. Theywere of an all too familiar type, very much the kind of people the old JuanCampos thought most women were. They seemed to live in fear of almosteverything, and in spite of their protests, they liked being dominated. Whatpower and confidence they had they drew from another, and that other was the onewhose power they feared. They were both afraid of Campos, but it wasn't just outof fear that they'd agreed to come along. They both felt that this was the onlyway out of an existence they didn't like and one which had no real future. Audlay almost defined the word "bimbo." If there were two thoughts in that headof hers, they were jumbled from being blown around by the air passing betweenher ears, Campos thought. Still, she had just enough pride and sense to realizewhen she was being humiliated, even if she didn't understand the joke. The menhad her do silly, ridiculous things and played all sorts of pranks on her whenthey weren't insulting her or slapping her around. She had found herself oddlyattracted to Campos from the first, though. There was something inside thestrange woman that radiated the power, the authority, and occasionally theattitude of the men she'd known, yet Campos wasn't a man. The newcomer had oftendefended Audlay against some of the more oafish lieutenants. A woman capable ofstanding up to the men and protecting others had been an unbelievably attractiveindividual, and Campos had shown her all sorts of new and different positionsand turn-ons she had never dreamed of before. She would do just about anythingJuana said, but not without whining and complaining about it all the time. Kuzi was different. Older and tougher, she was very much the product of a roughand morally ambivalent life and had taken everything she could get. She, infact, had only one fear, and it wasn't Campos; she was getting older, and whileshe was still attractive, every time she had looked at herself in the mirror forthe past year or two, she'd seen more and more bloom coming off the rose. Herman was coming by less and less, and fewer others were interested in comingaround when they had other, younger women to fool around with. She'd seen thehandwriting on the wall and hadn't liked it one bit. The guys also weren'texactly young chicks anymore, either, and where did they get off dumping her?She didn't like Campos all that much, but she saw a lot more there than the menhad. The strange newcomer had hated the life almost from the start, and it wasclear that she'd been biding her time until she could do something about it.Well, now that the time had come, it was time for old Kuzi to fish or cut bait. Campos regarded Kuzi not much more than she did Audlay, but she did recognizethe armor plate that was there. A gun might be as dangerous to them as toanybody else in Audlay's hands, but there was no question in Campos's mind thatKuzi could and would blow away anybody she had to.</p>
<p>Still, Campos wished that she had a couple of better and stronger allies thanthis pair. There just hadn't been enough time to build the kind of alliances shereally knew were necessary before it had fallen apart, and these two were theonly ones she could depend on upon such short notice. Still, sitting in a boxcarthat smelled like warmed-over shit going through a landscape that was kind oflike the Argentine pampas overrun with human-sized grasshoppers and cockroaches,she was under no illusion that she was biding time until something came up thatwould give her more of a plan.</p>
<p>"What are they all so scared of that damned birdie for, anyway?" Kuzi askedafter a while. "And why load ourselves down with that pair?"</p>
<p>"The horse will be handy. He carries things, remember," Campos responded."Besides, there is no other animal of that type who can understand a complicatedorder. As for the birdie, that's the prize, and I did not really realize it.They are all afraid that my precious little birdie can walk inside this worldand play God. Would you believe that?"</p>
<p>'''That thing?" Audlay commented, her upper beak rippling in disbelief. "She was not always 'that thing,' as you say it. Inside is still the brain, themind, of the person it used to be."</p>
<p>"So you gonna take her up north, let her go inside, and fix things for us?" Kuziasked her.</p>
<p>Mavra, still in the box but well within earshot, could not help but note thatshe was being talked about. "Don't believe it? Take me up there and I'll showyou how it's done," she offered, knowing the response.</p>
<p>"She says she can do it," Campos told the other two, to whom Mavra's words werejust unpleasant squawking. "The trouble is, what would she do to as if we lether, eh? That is the problem. That is everybody's problem with her." "So where are we goin' and what're we gonna do?" Audlay asked her. "We are going to change trains a few times just for insurance's sake, and thenwe are heading for another border. This is a nice place for a getaway, but it ishardly the kind of place where I think any of us want to spend more time than wehave to. Have either of you ever been this way before?"</p>
<p>"I went down to the place in Agon a few times and once or twice to the islands,but that's about it," Kuzi told her. "I don't think Audlay's been out ofBuckgrud since she ran away from the farm. Right?"</p>
<p>Audlay nodded.</p>
<p>"That makes us all strangers, but I have more experience being a stranger in anew land than either of you," Campos told them. "Still, I admit I have neverbeen in this strange a place before. We need some information. We need to knowwhat is in the hexes that are around this place."</p>
<p>In a way, Clopta hadn't been nearly as alien as she would have expected if she'djust heard of it. The buildings were odd, some of the customs were very strange,the people looked different and had in some cases different needs and comforts,but overall, it really hadn't been that different from Earth. That was what hadmade it easy for her to fit into it. Deep down, they were the same sorts asthose she'd known back home. Agon hadn't been all that different, either, nomatter how different the look of the people or what they ate or what theirhouses looked like, and some of the other races she'd met at the complex hadn'tbeen alien enough where it counted to really worry her. This, though, wasunexpected. There were places, nearby places, on this world where things were soalien, she could not fit in. It had added a layer of difficulty almost from thebeginning that she hadn't counted on at all.</p>
<p>"Find one with power, a real bathroom, and running water," Kuzi said, half injest.</p>
<p>"It will get harder than this, I think!" Campos warned them. "We cannot use themodern hexes. Modern hexes have computers and electronic identity checks andefficient policemen and probably corrupt officials with ties to those we leftbehind. No matter where we go, we stick out. We are a different breed. Best forthe time being to stick to places where it is difficult to find people who donot want to be found, where news travels very slowly, and where the governmentis a three-day ride. We need food, and shelter, and privacy. We must move untilwe find it."</p>
<p>"What then?" Kuzi asked her. "We just sit and hope they bust Taluud and hiswhole rotten lousy crew?"</p>
<p>"For a start," Campos told her. "Still, I feel that there is something else,something valuable that I am missing here that will be the answer to all ourproblems."</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, so long as you have something they want, they'll keep looking forus," Kuzi noted.</p>
<p>Campos's head snapped up, and her long lashes almost hit her forehead. "What wasthat? What did you say?"</p>
<p>"I just said that so long as we have the birdie and they want it, they'll keepcoming."</p>
<p>"Yes! That's if!"</p>
<p>"Huh?" the other two both said at once. "I wonder what price, what guarantees wemight get at the highest levels for her. I have been an idiot! We have atreasure this whole world wants, no matter what the reason! It is simply amatter of making sure we can safely cash it in!"</p>
<p>"Yeah? How are you gonna do that?" Kuzi asked her. "You know Gen and his mob.Would you trust them on any deal once they had what they wanted and didn't needus no more?"</p>
<p>"Not a bit," Campos admitted. "But if it were from the government, in writing,and public, then perhaps it would be honored, no? A full amnesty, a full pardonfor anything we might be charged with first and foremost. Some money-rewardmoney-for returning what was lost. Quite a lot of money. Enough to buy all thefiner things. A villa, perhaps, or a ranch, and some strong-necked, simplemindedmen to carry out our orders and see to our needs. It has possibilities, does itnot?"</p>
<p>"You think you can get 'em to buy that?"</p>
<p>"Over time. It will have to be well thought out and carefully done, but yes, Ithink we can get at least that. But first we must have that place I spoke of." "You mean the ranch with the cute dumb guys?" Audlay asked.</p>
<p>Campos ignored her. "We need to hide out for a bit. Make them uncomfortable,even desperate for a solution. Then we can make any sort of deal withconfidence."</p>
<p>She needed more than ever to find out about the hexes farther on. Somewhere onthis crazy world, where every country seemed no larger than Ecuador, there wasthe kind of place she sought.</p>
<p>"Yes, three Cloptans, a horse, and a lot of baggage," the colonel said. "We knowthey came at least this far."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," the stationmaster responded, standing on her hind legs and lookingvery much like a parody of a human. "I remember 'em. They did change here. Kindof odd, two groups of foreigners coming through. We don't get much of that here,you know."</p>
<p>The colonel and Taluud were counting on that. It had been frustrating to stop atevery transfer point and make the queries, particularly with the train crews soinsistent on keeping the schedule so perfectly, but it had paid off. "They took another train from here?" the colonel pressed impatiently. "Oh, yes."</p>
<p>"Which train? Going where and in which direction?"</p>
<p>"You know, we've been hoping to replace the roof on the main silo over therebefore the rains come," the stationmaster commented.</p>
<p>"Just let me have a few minutes with the little bug, boss," one of the gunmenwhispered to Taluud. "I'll find out what we need."</p>
<p>Taluud slapped the man hard in the face with the back of his hand. "Idiot!" hecommented. He could estimate the number of bugs within shouting distance, and hedidn't like the mental image of what would happen to them if they roughed up thekey official in town.</p>
<p>"So you need a new silo roof?" the colonel responded. "And how much will it taketo get one made for you, say, in Clopta?"</p>
<p>"Oh, not a lot, but more'n we got," the stationmaster responded. "Maybe sixhundred units."</p>
<p>Lunderman could hear Taluud choking slightly in back of him, but he knew howmuch cash the man had in those suitcases. "You'll have your new roof, sir. Now,as to the others?"</p>
<p>"Train 1544," the stationmaster responded. "Eastbound."</p>
<p>"When is the next train due in that direction, if I may ask?"</p>
<p>"Oh, there'll be one by in an hour and forty-one minutes," the station masterresponded, looking at the enigmatic station clock.</p>
<p>"Then we'd also like passage on it when it arrives. How much will that be?" "Can't say," the Mixtimite told him. "I don't know how far you want to go." "How far did they buy passage to?"</p>
<p>"End of the line. That'd be the Hawyr border."</p>
<p>Gen Taluud saw a long string of such transactions ahead and groaned. "Don't worry so much," the colonel told him. "After all, they don't have nearlythe cash with them that you do. They can't keep this up for long." "Long enough," Gen Taluud growled, turning to one of the gunmen. "Pay the man.And add six hundred for his damned roof."</p>
<p>For a society without money, they all sure seemed to have a good knowledge ofthe finer points of the system, he thought ruefully.</p>
<p>"These documents from your own government railway commission tell you to give usfull cooperation as well as free passage," Julian argued.</p>
<p>"I see it," the stationmaster told her. 'Trouble is, we haven't been on thefriendliest of terms here with the Mother Nest. Been hard to get materials." "He's sayin' that the government's all well and good, but his three hundredbabies all need shoes," Gus commented. He turned to the stationmaster, who hadreacted as everybody always did to Gus's sudden and fierce appearance. "Tryin' to scare me poppin' in and out like that?" the stationmaster askednervously.</p>
<p>"It's a habit. We understand what you are getting at, but they didn't give us agreat deal of cash, just enough to get by, and we may have a long way to go.We've spoken with other stationmasters here, and they have understood theproblem. What makes you think we can give you more?"</p>
<p>"Got a new silo roof out of the last bunch."</p>
<p>"The last bunch? You mean there's more than the Cloptan women?" Tony asked. "Sure. Was they women? Can't tell the difference myself. But first the one bunchcomes in, and they buy tickets for themselves and freight for their stuff. Thenthis second bunch comes in, also Cloptans, but with a real strange characterlike nothin' I ever saw before-as strange as all of you. And they seemed rightinterested in pay in' whatever it took to find out where the first group went.Guess I shoulda held out for more than a roof, huh?"</p>
<p>Julian thought a moment. "What did this other one, with the second group, looklike?"</p>
<p>"Didn't look like anything at all. No, I mean it. Just a giant ball of goo. Nicemanners, though."</p>
<p>"The colonel! The colonel's after 'em!" Gus hissed. "Okay, look, we could giveyou a paper that would authorize you to go to Clopta and place a prepaid orderfor something if you want, but we can't give you cash."</p>
<p>"I dunno. We don't work like that here."</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, I'll tell you how we work. We try and be reasonable and hope forcooperation," Gus told him, some menace creeping into his already intimidatingvoice. "If we don't get any cooperation, we note who didn't give it to us. Thenwe have to send a message to our people and to your government that we could notdo our jobs because we couldn't pay his bribe! Might not get us what we need,but it sure brings us satisfaction."</p>
<p>"Oh, goodness, yes!" Anne Marie put in, getting the drift of things. "I wonderwhat happened to that last one who did this to us. We never did find out becausewhen we had to backtrack to check, they were marching out the whole populationof his town somewhere. It was most distressing!"</p>
<p>The stationmaster's limbs twitched a bit, and the antennae atop her head seemedto cross.</p>
<p>"Give me a sheet of the official notepaper with the seal," Gus told Tony. "I'llput it on the next train to the Mother Nest. Then all we'll need from you, sir,is your name and title and the name of this lovely little town here." The twitching continued, and finally the stationmaster said, "First batch took1544 eastbound. The second group followed 'em."</p>
<p>"And when is the next train?"</p>
<p>"Sixty-four minutes."</p>
<p>"We thank you for your cooperation," Tony told her. "We will report oursatisfaction with the line to the authorities."</p>
<p>"No, just leave me out," the stationmaster responded. "They'd just come and take away the money I already got…"</p>
<p>"Amateurs," Gus hissed contemptuously.</p>
<p>"Hawyr is out," Juana Campos muttered, looking at a map which she couldn't readbut which she'd marked up in Spanish. "High-tech and reported not very friendlyanyway. Karlbarx is nontech, but they're said to be some sort of giant rat thingand they eat meat. I don't think they sound too great, and there's not muchtrade there or a line going all the way to the border, anyway. Quilst I'dalready ruled out, so that leaves Leba. I don't like it, but that seems to bethe best choice."</p>
<p>"Are they all full of flesh-eating monsters or what?" Audlay asked plaintively."I mean, gee, it sounds like a horror show."</p>
<p>"Well, the Lebans are plants, and they supposedly don't need much except dirtand water, so that's something," Campos commented. "They're also semitech, butthe only use they seem to make of it is that they've allowed the Mixtimites toextend a few railroad lines through."</p>
<p>"Phew! More smelly boxcars?" Kuzi said rather than asked.</p>
<p>"Maybe. We'll have to see what it looks like. The trains are basically throughto the other borders and don't seem to have many stops in Leba. I doubt if aplant that gets all its nourishment from the sun, rain, and soil needs much fromanywhere else. Trouble is, we go up there, we can get boxed in fairly easily.There's only one more hex to the equator, which, I am told, cannot be crossed.The Leban trains don't go there; they head for Bahaoid or something that soundslike that, which is a high-tech hex to the west that they do trade with. So wegot this plant hex, and then a nontech hex up against a wall, and a high-tech onboth sides. Not great."</p>
<p>"We could turn around and go back," Audlay suggested. "Maybe they wouldn'tfigure that."</p>
<p>"The last thing we want to do is go back toward Clopta, believe me. We'd be injail or worse, and most of them in there with us would be part of the oldorganization and maybe not too keen on seeing us, either. No, I don't think so.Not now." She sighed. "Leba it is, then."</p>
<p>"You say they're plants'?" Kuzi asked her. "I just can't imagine that. A flowergarden that talks back."</p>
<p>"Somehow I don't think it's going to be like that," Campos responded. "We canonly go and see. And I hope we can arrange for some fresh food for our littletroublemaking prize here. As an insect eater, she's probably been going nutsbeing unable to eat this whole population."</p>

<p>LOW HILLS BEGAN AS THEY TRAVELED NORTH TOWARD THE BORDER in Mixtim, and soon thecountryside began to be broken and interesting once more. Along the rivers therewas lush green vegetation, but beyond the hills were covered with grassland, tooarid to really farm effectively, considering that the water had to come uphill,but sufficient to provide sustenance for a few small villages that seemed toexist primarily for the railroad.</p>
<p>There were no border controls as such there, but the station and small yardright against the hex barrier were used to rewater the engines and give them acheckout as well as to change engines and crews for the haul through Leba. Thesteam engines used had a different look to them; they were much larger, withlong boilers, and had huge coal tenders just in back of the engine in place ofthe wood carriers of Mixtim. While the engines were prepared and checked out,there was a two-hour layover.</p>
<p>"Figures," Gus commented. "You wouldn't want to burn wood in a land where thepeople were the plants. They might take it personal."</p>
<p>"They must mine the coal elsewhere," Tony noted. "There didn't seem to be anysigns of such mining or of coal, period, anywhere we passed." She sighed. "Well,time to at least find out some information. Excuse me."</p>
<p>Anne Marie stood looking at the ghostly border and what was beyond. "Looksrather ominous," she commented. "And certainly wet."</p>
<p>The skies within Mixtim were bright, with just a few clouds, while the skies onthe other side of the border were a low uniform gray. The place was certainlygreen, though; it seemed like an endless forest, perhaps a rain forest from thelooks of the fog and mist curling through the tops of the trees beyond. Tony returned a few minutes later. "News good, not so good, and in between," shetold them. "First, no more switches. They went into Leba, all right, and so didthe colonel's bunch following them. The ladies went through many hours ago, thesecond group only on the train before this one. We are certainly catching up,but I fear to the wrong group. I am most worried about the colonel, Gus." "He's a slick meanie, all right," Gus agreed, "but I handled him." "Yes, once. I remember thinking when we spoke to one another of Brazil andCarnivale and old times that I was glad he was on our side. Now that it seems heis not, my fears are realized."</p>
<p>"I still say he can be handled."</p>
<p>"In a high-tech hex, yes. He is as vulnerable to the energy weapons as we are.But the energy weapons do not work here, Gus, or in Leba, either. Regular guns,crossbows, that sort of thing, they will work, but what would be the effect on acreature like him of shooting him full of bullets and arrows? Not much. He candrown, yes, but we are far from the ocean, and I doubt if we will be able toentice him to jump into a deep lake. We need a way to counter him or we mightrue catching up to him."</p>
<p>Gus considered it and nodded. "I think I see what you mean. In this kind of hexyou gotta think like you're in a western, and they didn't have Colt.45disintegrators back then. There's gotta be something, though, that'll get him.If those things weren't mortal, they'd have eaten this whole damned world bynow!"</p>
<p>"That is a point," Tony admitted. "But what?" Her eyes looked around the railyard, not really knowing what she was looking for but hoping for some kind ofhint, something that would give them an edge.</p>
<p>"What is that little beetle doing with the small tank up in front of the enginethere, dear?" Anne Marie asked.</p>
<p>"Putting oil in the headlamps for the dark, I would say," Tony responded. All three of them suddenly said at exactly the same time, "Say! Why not?" "I wonder how much they can spare and how much we can safely carry?" Anne Mariemused at last.</p>
<p>"Yeah, and don't forget the matches," Gus added.</p>
<p>Tony sighed. "That is still a worry. It looks awfully damp in there." "Look on the bright side," Anne Marie said with a smile. "If they are allintelligent plants over there, at least we won't be executed for starting anyforest fires."</p>
<p>"There is a sort of train service area and such right here, in the middle of thehex, just before the line branches off to the east," Juana Campos noted. "Thatis where we must get off."</p>
<p>"What're we gonna do about all our bags and stuff?" Audlay- asked. "I mean, wecan't carry all that, and not even your cute little pony can take all thatmuch."</p>
<p>"Yeah, we're gonna be in the middle of nowhere," Kuzi agreed.</p>
<p>"I had hoped we could take more by hiring natives or animals when we neededthem," Campos told them both. "It seems like we can't count on anything beingwhat we think of as normal up here, though. We're just going to have to gothrough the stuff, see what we have to take and what we can take. Anything elsewill have to be left."</p>
<p>"You can leave that bird for all I care," Audlay commented. "That thing's gonnabe what takes up a lot of room."</p>
<p>"We can use some of the clothing to make a kind of brace, and she is lightenough to be able to be carried by our pack mule here. If she is truly charmed,she won't starve. With all these plants there must be insects by the millions,so if we just tie her to a stake at night with a very long rope, she can go findher own food. The Mixtim say that the natives here are not hostile but demandrespect and that fruit and such are available if you do. We will have to dependon that."</p>
<p>When the train stopped for the servicing in a wooded glade near a rushingwaterfall, it was already very late in the day. They had spent a full day andnight going back and forth on the trains of Mixtim and now, at the end of asecond day, were in the middle of nowhere in Leba. The two companions were notat all thrilled with this adventure anymore, and Campos was beginning to wonderif she hadn't made a mistake herself.</p>
<p>It was gray and depressing, there was a light rain falling-there always seemedto be a light rain falling-and they were in a wilderness setting surrounded bymountain-sized rolling hills. Where there wasn't grass or puddles there was mud. "You sure this is a good idea?" Kuzi asked her. "I mean, we're gonna go off inthis muck toward who knows what. And we don't even know if anybody's reallyfollowing us! If they just got an all-points out, hell, we oughta go on to thathigh-tech place at the end of the railroad and be comfortable for a night or twountil we can figure out what to do next."</p>
<p>"Sounds good to me," Audlay chimed in, looking at the mud as if it were acidabout to swallow her up.</p>
<p>Campos shook her head. "No, I have been hunted before. You get a feeling for it.Still, we cannot do much, starting this late in the day. Perhaps before we dofigure out anything, we ought to see just who we are up against. I propose thatwe stop here and camp out, no matter how miserable that sounds, but not close tohere. Up there, overlooking these yards, might be far enough if we can foolthese Mixtim staff into thinking we went some other direction. Then we wait formore trains and we see who gets off. There is one late-night train and then notanother until morning. There is also no question that we can hear them when theycome. If we look and no one gets off of either train, or no one gets off whodoes not then climb back on, we can decide what to do, perhaps even takesomething of a risk and catch the next train after that toward civilization." "But what if a bunch does get off?" Kuzi asked her.</p>
<p>"Then we will be in back of them rather than ahead. Then, if they do notdiscover that we remain near here, they will go off into this wilderness insearch of us. If they do figure out our plan, then we will have to deal withthem. Come. We are in for some very heavy lugging that will take all of us andLori to do and then a more miserable climb and a miserable dark, wet night. Butby tomorrow we may well be able at last to act."</p>
<p>Kuzi looked around nervously. "I wish we'd seen some of these Lebans. I'd liketo know what we're dealin' with here."</p>
<p>"Oh, yuck!" Audlay said with obvious disgust as she sank ankle-deep into thickbrown mud. "I don't think I'm gonna be able to take this!"</p>
<p>"Just pretend you're back on the farm you ran away from," Campos told her. "Youweren't city born and bred."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but that was comfortable!. I just didn't realize it till now." Campos grew alarmed. "Don't you cry on me, you silly wimp.' Give me a hand withthis-now!"</p>
<p>It was said in the Campos tone of voice that few ignored; those who did lived toregret it.</p>
<p>They had managed, with Lori doing some pulling, to get what gear they'd saved ahundred feet up the mountainside, although it was exhausting work. Mavra wasfinally out of the box and on a rope tied to her ankle, but she was expected towalk, and she managed, her feet actually able to dig into the mud and turf,although she moved slowly.</p>
<p>Although near exhaustion, Campos made sure that they had a tent up and that thegear was either repacked or sufficiently hidden from view. The station crew hadpaid them no real attention, but they were certainly bound to be remembered, soafter all was said and done, leaving everything on the bluff overlooking theyard, the three of them and Lori managed to make a show of going down, throughthe whole yard, across into the darkness beyond, and off toward the northwest.They then circled around, came up below the yard, crossed the tracks, and atlast made it back up to the camp.</p>
<p>If anybody in the yard was asked, he would swear that the trio had gone off inthat direction.</p>
<p>It was enough, but it had been done only with Campos threatening and cursing. Inthe latter stages she was pretty physical with them, particularly Audlay, but itwas accomplished.</p>
<p>Now there was nothing to do but huddle in the tent, in the sleeping bags, andwait for the sound of a steam locomotive.</p>
<p>The late-night train had brought nobody familiar, nobody suspicious, and nobodywho didn't look like a large insect. Campos didn't know whether to be relievedor worried, but she decided that finally she might be able to get some sleep. It seemed like only an instant, but somebody was shaking her, and hard. Sheresisted, then started, reflexes taking over, and grabbed the nearest strangearm.</p>
<p>"Take it easy!" Kuzi snapped. "You was out like a light! I heard the train andwent down and took a look, and you'll never believe who got off." Campos shook herself awake. "Who?"</p>
<p>"Your jilted lover, the great himself!"</p>
<p>"Gen Taluud? Here? But he never goes anywhere! And he never, never does his owndirty work! This isn't his style!"</p>
<p>"Well, it's him, all right. Think I could mistake that son of a bitch, fat cigarand all? And he's got five guys with him; looks like Pern and the wholebodyguard."</p>
<p>This was an even more unexpected curve. Campos hadn't expected to be chased byTaluud at all. "Anybody with them?"</p>
<p>"Maybe. I dunno. There was this-this thing with 'em, and they all seemed to betalkin' to it, but I couldn't tell you what it looked like even now. I will tellyou they got horses with 'em, but the horses sure don't like whatever it was." Campos pulled herself out of the sleeping bag, every single muscle aching,including some she had never known she had. "Are they still there?" "Last I saw, yeah. I figured I better get back here and wake you up fast." "You did exactly right. Stay here and keep Audlay quiet if she wakes up anddon't tell her about this yet. If she hears it's Genny in person, she'll panic.I'm going for a look myself."</p>
<p>Kuzi was right; it was Taluud in the flesh, and she really couldn't make outwhat the hell that thing with the boys was, either. One thing was for sure: he'dcome in style. Not only horses for all the boys but pack animals, too. Hemust've spent a fortune on that outfit. This wasn't personal anymore, that wasclear. She knew him too well. He'd have ducked underground under mostcircumstances and just sent out feelers to everywhere to report to him if thegirls were found. No, for Genny to do it himself, there had to be more to it. There was only one possible explanation: Genny had found out or figured out whothe bird was and had come to the same conclusion she had. He'd have stayed incharacter if he just wanted to give them back as he'd said. No, clearly he knewof Mavra's value and was determined to use her to work his own deal. Back on Earth her brothers and father had always teased her about thinking toosmall. Maybe they were right. What would amnesty mean to Genny? He was socrooked, he'd have new charges in a week. And as for riches, he probably hadenough stashed away to buy his own hex. She'd had a certain admiration for himfrom the start for what he'd built and how much he'd accumulated and howcomfortable he was with all of it-very much like her own father. Now thatadmiration was justified. That fat old SOB was rolling the dice for all themarbles, winner take all.</p>
<p>What was that thing with him, though? It kind of flowed or oozed, but sometimesit looked almost like a very large man-an Earth-type man. What could one do tostop it if it found one? she wondered. It would be like shooting into a giantwad of gum. It would be best not to find out. Genny alone would be bad enough. She watched, worried and impatient, until they finally mounted and rode offslowly in the direction they'd faked the crew out on the night before, leavingone of the bodyguards at the station just in case. The thing with them had gone,too; although the animals hadn't liked it, it had assumed its manlike shape andmanaged to mount a saddle.</p>
<p>They'd be back because they lost the trail, because there wasn't one, or becausethey would finally figure out the deception. Still, where could they go? Whatcould they do at this point? Where they were was as safe as anywhere else aroundhere, and it would be pretty tough to surprise them.</p>
<p>At least it wasn't raining. It was still as humid as the jungles but muchcooler, and there was still a lot of fog and mist around. Without the rain thereseemed to be something saying that not everything was hopeless. Audlay was up by the time she returned, and Kuzi had made a small fire with thecamper oven, really just a metal device with a chemical fuel that could be usedto heat one thing at a time. It didn't give off a lot of smoke; Campos decidedto let them eat something.</p>
<p>Both Lori and Mavra looked wet, muddy, and miserable, but they were still thereand still secure.</p>
<p>"You are very popular," she told them. "We will see who gets who, though, in theend. Do not get your hopes up. No matter who winds up with you, you will stillbe what you are and they will still lock you away. In a way, you are both veryfortunate to be with me and not them. I need you. I need both of you. They onlywant my little Mavra."</p>
<p>Lori's head jerked up. Mavra! So that was what all this was about! If only therewas some way to communicate directly with her and not just through Campos! "Yeah, I'm real popular," Mavra responded. "And hungry. There were some pickingsaround here, but not enough."</p>
<p>"You will have to eat what you can. I have nothing to spare right now," Campostold her. "Would you prefer I shot my pretty pony here and let you feast on him?He's another like you, you know."</p>
<p>Mavra turned and looked up at the pony and for the first time noticed the horn,painted black though it was. No. Couldn't be, she thought. But then again, maybeit could… Like Lori, she tried to think of some way of communicating. Anhour later there was the sound of another train pulling in, but it turned out tobe going in the opposite direction. For a moment she was tempted; that certainlywas one option, considering their fix. But if Genny had left one man here, hadhe also left others elsewhere? There was that long layover at the border comingup; there was probably a similar one going back and nowhere at all to hide. After another hour there was no sign of Taluud's party returning, but anothertrain was coming up from the south and it stopped at the station. More peopledid indeed get off, and they stuck out worse than Cloptans.</p>
<p>Two centaurs-blond and beautiful, Campos thought approvingly. And anunmistakable Erdomite female. Probably the little bitch they said was with Lorion the boat.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, her bill opened in complete amazement. It couldn't be! It just couldn't be! But it was!</p>
<p>Theresa Perez, naked as the day she was born and fatter than a stuck pig butotherwise looking much the same.</p>
<p>Campos couldn't take her eyes off the girl or fight the near lust for completerevenge that was rising within her. I could have them all! Even now! I couldhave them all to play with…</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p>She saw the Cloptan left behind start to walk out toward the train, spot theother foreigners getting off, and quickly duck back behind a shed, pulling hispistol.</p>
<p>Shoot them all, you idiot! Just leave me the girl…</p>
<p>He looked as if he might well be going to try to do just that, perhaps to all ofthem, but just as he steadied his arm and aimed, something had him. Somethingthat somehow hadn't been visible before but now was a huge, monstrous lizard,wide jaws chomping down on the man, who struggled once and was still. The pistolfired once, a totally wild shot that seemed to go nowhere, and that was it. Campos was upset less at the scene than at the sudden appearance of theirsavior. Where had that creature come from? And for that matter, where was itnow?</p>
<p>This was going to take a great deal of thought.</p>
<p>"Sorry to mess up your station. It was not intentional," Anne Marie told one ofthe Mixtimite workers. "I'm afraid he was going to shoot us."</p>
<p>"We have an absolute dictum neither to judge nor to interfere in the strangecustoms of other races," the creature responded philosophically. "Please justclean up any messes you make before you leave and take only your memories andwhat you brought in with you."</p>
<p>Gus stared at the large insect as he walked off, apparently unconcerned aboutwhat had happened. Finally he said, "Why do I feel like I'm about to be arrestedby Smokey the Bear?"</p>
<p>"Forget it," Julian told him. "Good job. How did you spot him?" "Just luck. Even Dahirs have to take a leak now and then."</p>
<p>"Well, we ought to be more careful from now on," she warned them. 'Tony, see ifyou can find out what this was all about from some of these workers. I want toknow what Cloptans are doing here trying to take us out."</p>
<p>"You aren't the only one," Tony agreed, and trotted over to some of the workerswho were tending the water tank.</p>
<p>Julian looked around at the high mountains and dense forest with its puffs offog and frowned. "I don't like this. I feel very exposed here." "You went through that whole nasty business at that underground nest ofcutthroats, and this beautiful spot makes you more nervous?" Anne Marieresponded, a bit amused by the contrast.</p>
<p>"We were attacking there, and they had to contend with us," Julian reminded her."Now we're the sitting targets." She looked around and above them and thenseemed to see something. Her Erdomese eyes adjusted for the long view, bringingthe bluff into clearer view as if through mild binoculars.</p>
<p>"Something?" Anne Marie asked, a bit nervous again. "I thought I saw somethingon that bluff, but I can't be sure. Whoever it was is gone now, though." Shekept watching the area just to make sure.</p>
<p>Anne Marie twisted around and rummaged through her saddle packs, bringing out amedium-bore rifle with a scope and a clip of ammunition, which she inserted intothe stock.</p>
<p>She checked it, then raised it to her shoulder and panned the area, lookingthrough the scope.</p>
<p>"Can you really shoot that thing straight?" Gus asked her worriedly. "My great uncle Reggie used to sit around and tell the family stories about hiswar in Burma. I'm not sure we believed them, but he was a member of the AldstoneDowns Shooting Club, and he took me with him once when I was still rather young.Took pity on me, I suppose-young girl in a wheelchair and all that. I watchedthem shoot some clay pigeons, but it looked rather silly. They had a rifle rangethere, though, and Reggie wanted to show off how good a shot he was to hisunbelieving niece. He was quite good, I might say, and just for a lark he let metry it from the chair. It proved quite a good platform for small-bore. He'd takeme back now and then because I liked it so much. Finally stopped, though, when Ibegan outshooting him." She sighed. "He's long dead now, but these are strongerarms, better eyes, and a much better platform."</p>
<p>"I wish I could hold something that would shoot," Julian commented, stilllooking. "My own abilities seem to be purely defensive and useful only closein." She finally looked away, and after a moment Anne Marie lowered the rifle. "You are sure you saw someone up there?" Anne Marie asked her. "I'm sure. But who knows? It might be one of the elusive natives for all I cantell about them."</p>
<p>"Stay here, all of you," Gus said. "I'm going to go look for myself." Terry started to follow, but he cut her short. "No! They can't see me, but theycan see you now."</p>
<p>Tony came back over, noticing the rifle. "What happened?"</p>
<p>"Julian thinks someone is up there. Gus has gone to check," Anne Marie told her."In the meantime, I thought we'd be ready just in case,"</p>
<p>"Interesting," Tony said, thinking and looking at the bluff. "TheCloptans-almost certainly Campos with what might well be Mavra and possibly Lorias well-arrived just before dark last night. They went off in that direction,toward the northwest, leaving much of their baggage behind one of the trainsheds, and weren't seen or heard of again. The colonel and five Cloptans came inthis morning, fully armed and with horses and pack mules, left that one backhere, and set off after the first group. They, too, haven't returned." Julian shook her head slowly from side to side and said, "I wish Gus was backfrom his scouting. I seem to remember him saying Campos was from a pretty wildarea, maybe the jungle, back on Earth."</p>
<p>"So?"</p>
<p>"Nobody with any survival experience would go into an unknown wilderness atnightfall. No roads, no trails to speak of. It doesn't make any sense. And whynorthwest? Why back yourself up against the equator, which I am told is a solidwall like the Zone wall in Erdom? I kept trying to think what I would do intheir place." She clicked her two hoofed hands together. "That's it!" They neverwent anywhere! I'll bet you they're right up there in a solid defensiveposition!"</p>
<p>"We should know when Gus comes back," Tony said optimistically. "Until then Isuggest we move a bit more toward some protection from that bluff just in casethere's a rifle as capable as the one Anne Marie has up there." "I agree, but I wouldn't worry too much. After all, they can't see Gus, youknow," Anne Marie reminded her.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't get overconfident," Julian warned. "That is Gus's one big weakness.I do not think that this Campos is any pushover. If she saw Gus in action…" Mavra had been trying to figure out a way to communicate with Lori. She walkedover to the black unicorn pony and looked at the ground. There was a fair amountof mud there, and slowly she began to smooth it over with her broad bird's feet.Lori, on a short rope tied to a stake, was nonetheless able to come over to thearea and watch.</p>
<p>Language… What language? Greek had worked before. Try it.</p>
<p>The feet weren't adequate for writing, so she leaned over and began writing inthe mud with her sharp, slightly curved bill.</p>
<p>MAVRA.</p>
<p>Lori understood what she was trying to do but couldn't make out what it was.Once he had known these things, once he'd read many languages, but it was sohard, so hard to remember… He shook his head no.</p>
<p>Mavra was elated that she'd gotten any reaction at all but disturbed at hisinability to read what she thought looked fairly clear. She wished she had beenable to learn this English tongue the others knew or at least the alphabet itused. English… England… England was a part of Britannia, right? ThePortuguese had hated the English and spoke as if they were not distant in theirnative lands. So England. Britannia… Conquered by Rome, as had been most ofEurope and north Africa. Latin? If something was wrong with learning Greek, hemight not remember Latin, either. But what if the alphabets were the same thanksto the Roman conquest? It was worth a try.</p>
<p>M-A-V-R-A.</p>
<p>Lori twisted, took a look at the letters, and tried to remember, tried to bringsomething back. A,B,C,D,E,F,G… The old rhyme came from somewhere, and out ofthe depths of his brain he saw MARVA there.</p>
<p>A nod of the horse's head.</p>
<p>Mavra felt better. Something was better than nothing. But how was Lori spelled? Did it matter?</p>
<p>LOWREY?</p>
<p>Lori thought he was losing it but got hold of himself and read it again. Lowrey?Lori! Enthusiastic nod. He'd grade for spelling later.</p>
<p>This next one would be harder. Mavra looked over, but if the two women with Campos saw anything odd there, they surely gave no sign that they noticed. ESCAPADUM, she managed, with a lot of effort. It looked awful, but maybe itwould come through.</p>
<p>Again Lori puzzled over the word. What the hell did that mean? Escape…Escape! A very enthusiastic nod.</p>
<p>He moved his head and managed to almost grab the rope around his neck in hismouth. Mavra watched, got the idea, and went over to the post. It wasn't much ofa knot, more a casual loop, but since she had only a bill designed for diggingout insects, untying it would not be that easy. Still, looking over at the twoCloptan women, she started to work on it.</p>
<p>It didn't matter where they were or what they were. As Campos had pointed out,they were self-sufficient in most surroundings and had no real needs beyond foodand water. They had been coming north, so they were still headed for theequator. If they could make it, what difference did it make if they were ontheir own as animals and would have to take some time to get there? She almost had it when Lori gave a deep neigh and shook the rope. Mavra turnedto see Campos coming back and knew she had to back off.</p>
<p>Lori didn't feel too disappointed. If they were going to have to walk in thisplace, then Mavra would probably be stuck up on top of her somehow, becauseotherwise they'd move at a crawl. The first chance they got, he'd make a breakfor it no matter what. If they could make it into the woods at any kind of speedat all, those three Cloptans would never catch them. They would be forced togive up any real chase after they realized that their supplies were also goneatop Lori's back.</p>
<p>Maybe what Mavra had claimed was all true. Coming from such depths of despairand hopelessness to a point where they not only were brought back together butmight actually make a break for it in a region better suited to them than to anypursuers had been too much to hope for. It had taken Mavra to make him realizeit, though.</p>
<p>For now they had to wait. He looked over at Campos. What in the world was shedoing with that machete?</p>
<p>"Just some vines and those metal cups," Campos was instructing the other two."That will do, yes. Kuzi, get the pistols and put clips in them, then bring meone, and fast!"</p>
<p>Quickly Campos sliced through a small tree so that only a small stub remainedabove the ground. She twisted some thread from Audlay's sewing kit around it,secured it in a notch, and tied the two metal cups to it so that they touchedjust off the ground. She then unreeled the thread over to another stump so thatit crossed the most obvious path. She then tied it off to another cut trunk onthe other side.</p>
<p>Kuzi brought the pistol to her, looking nervous. "What is this?" "Just get back behind the tent and keep Audlay out of the way," Camposwhispered. "There's something down there you can't see until it is too late. Ifthose two cups hit each other, stand and just fire as fast as you can anywherebetween the threads. Straight out. It's taller than we are."</p>
<p>"What is it?" Kuzi whispered back, suddenly scared. "That thing I saw?" "No. Something else. Like a big lizard from hell, only for some reason youcannot see it until it is eating you, so just shoot! I will be over by the rockand doing the same. If we fire quickly enough, we may get it or at least knockit back."</p>
<p>"Gee… she really does know this stuff," Audlay whispered, terrified but stillconfident in Campos-more now than ever.</p>
<p>"I hope so," Kuzi responded. Giant blob creatures, invisible killer lizards…This wasn't exactly the picture she'd had in mind of the trip. In spite of his confidence at not being visible, Gus still proceeded cautiously.The mud was slippery, and if he lost his balance and fell, he'd be seen, allright, by just about everybody, maybe before he broke his fool neck. He reached the bluff where Julian thought she'd seen something, and sure enough,it looked as if somebody had been there, maybe for quite some time. What wasthat- some kind of root there? He'd seen Cloptans chewing on that stuff, butonly the menial types. Somebody said it was some kind of mild drug, heremembered, more a habit than an addiction. He picked one up and sniffed it. Itsmelled like, well root beer, sort of. He dropped it and looked around. Well, ifa Cloptan had the habit and was stuck here watching things as a lookout, thatwould be about what one would expect.</p>
<p>They couldn't have gone much farther up, not in the dark. There were certainlysigns of some kind of boots or shoes, and was that a hoofprint or two? Maybe. He moved on up, being extra careful, and as his head cleared a flat area justabove, he saw the tent and campsite and, over to one side-holy smoke! Could thatbe Lori? The horn was right and it was kinda like the picture Kurdon had shownthem, but the colors were certainly all wrong.</p>
<p>They could dye the hair, but they hadn't cut off the horn.</p>
<p>And over there near the pony-a meter-high ball of feathers that kind of gave offa whole riot of colors. Looked like a damned big owl, though, except for thatlong pointed beak. Could that be Mavra?</p>
<p>His heart started pounding with excitement. This close! Here they were! With nobody else in sight, he moved swiftly to get up to the top and try to introduce himself when he suddenly felt something catch on his foot. There was adull chatter.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the whole place seemed to explode. He felt something slam into himlike a hammer, and he fell backward and then began to slide down the slope, bitsof grass coming off as he slid farther and farther down the mountainside towardthe freight yard below.</p>
<p>"Did we get it?" Kuzi yelled.</p>
<p>"We're still here!" Campos pointed out. This was the most excitement she'd hadsince waking up in that burg. The sense of danger coursed through her andinvigorated her in a way she'd felt only briefly since becoming Cloptan, thathaving been when she'd disintegrated that bitch on the docks months earlier. "Now what?" Audlay squealed, uncharacteristically excited more than scared. Shewas actually enjoying this!</p>
<p>"I don't think that thing will be climbing up here anytime soon again," Campostold the others, "but there are three more down there, and now they'll knowwe're here. Get together what you can! Never mind how it's stuffed in! Roll itall up, tie it off, and get it somehow on the horse! We are going to have tomove fast! Keep the ammo out. Get me another clip and take one for yourself!" Kuzi threw Campos a clip, and she ejected the old one and inserted the freshclip in the pistol. But even as she moved with Audlay to strike the tent and geteverything together, she called, "Move? Where?"</p>
<p>"Into the forest and then down!" Campos told her. "Get down toward the tracks ifwe can, I hope. I'll keep us covered while you get packed! Move!" Terry had followed Gus mentally all the way up, and when he'd been hit, she'dcried out and started toward the trail. Julian moved to try and stop her, butTony called, "No! Let her go! It may be the only way we'll find him! Stay here!I'll get him if he's still worth getting! Anne Marie, keep me covered. If theystart shooting again, shoot in their general direction. Keep them back!" But Juana Campos had no intention of exposing herself again, only of blockinganyone else from corning to the camp level.</p>
<p>It was also pretty easy to find Gus; he was totally visible, sprawled out,covered with mud about halfway to the bluff, and from his side a pool ofyellowish liquid gathered. Terry reached him first. He groaned and tried to getup. but it was too much for him. Tony was there only seconds later. "Gus! Are you all right?"</p>
<p>The Dahir's eyes opened, and he took in several deep breaths. "You've got to bekidding."</p>
<p>Tony examined the wound. "It looks like you've taken a bullet in the side. Smallcaliber, but a mean-looking wound. Can you stand? I will try and help you downthe rest of the way."</p>
<p>"I-I dunno. It ain't really hurtin' yet. Here… pull me up-Jesus!" Hestiffened and sank back down. "Man! It hurts like hell now!"</p>
<p>"Well, we are going to have to get you down somehow. If I help you, do you thinkyou could get on my back and just cling there?"</p>
<p>"I-augh! I'll do it! Gimme a moment… Okay-now!" The female centaur's arms, soweak in Dillian terms compared to the male's, were more powerful than anybodyelse's they'd met along the way. Pivoting around at the nearly universal hipjoint the Dillians had, she pulled Gus to a standing position, then grabbed himand pulled him up onto her back. He was barely on, and sideways, but by force ofwill he managed to turn himself around. Tony immediately started down, Terryfollowing worriedly.</p>
<p>Once back on level ground, Anne Marie helped Gus back down, and they turned himon his side. "Looks like it passed clean through," Julian noted. "That'sactually a good sign. Trouble is, we can't tell if it hit anything vitalinternally because we don't know what 'vital' is to a Dahir, and the onlydoctors I know of in this whole region aren't ones I'd recommend to friends." "We should wash off both the entry and exit wounds," Anne Marie told them. "Wecan get buckets or something from the Mixtim, and there's plenty of water aroundhere, goodness knows. Stopping the bleeding, though, is going to be a realproblem, and there's still shock and infection to worry about. The best we cando is use some of the big bandages in the kit and tape him up and then wait." "No! Stop! You can't wait!" Gus gasped. 'Too close! Too close!" "Just take it easy," Tony soothed.</p>
<p>"No, you don't understand! They're up there! Mavra and Lori both! I saw 'em! Ow!God! This hurts!"</p>
<p>"Mavra and Lori both?" Julian responded, looking up again toward the bluff andbeyond.</p>
<p>"And a lot of guns and a willingness to use them," Tony reminded her. "One thingat a time! Where can they go? They are on foot now, as it were, and Cloptanswould have a lot more trouble in this landscape than we would. If they can getoff there at all without coming back through here, they will be off trail andgoing down into a wilderness. Our biggest danger is that they will come down,guns blazing. You and Anne Marie see to Gus. I will ensure that if they do comedown, they will not get far. Do not worry about them. At the moment I wouldrather be in our position than theirs, actually."</p>
<p>"I don't know about that," Julian commented. "This Campos seems to be a devil,almost supernatural in the harm she can cause. What if they do get down? What ifthey flag down a train?"</p>
<p>"These trains do not stop for flags, I don't think," Tony assured her. "TheMixtim will allow nothing to interfere with their punctuality." Gus was no ideal patient while the wounds were washed and dressed, but after awhile he passed out, and that helped a lot. They rigged up a kind of litter fromwood and a freight station tarp and got him under a shed which held maintenancetools. It was all they could do.</p>
<p>Julian sighed. "Look, I'm going to go down the tracks and see if I can pick themup. Oh, don't look so alarmed! I'll be careful, and I won't do anything, onlylocate them and get back here. They won't be expecting anybody to do it,anyway."</p>
<p>"I don't like it. We've already got one wounded member, and he was in many waysthe handiest of us all," Anne Marie said, shaking her head.</p>
<p>"You said it yourself about Campos," Tony reminded her.</p>
<p>"I know, I know, but don't you see? It's something I can do. Something thatmakes sense that I can do better than either of you. And of all of us I'm themost expendable, anyway. You two have futures when you finally get back home,and even Gus has the girl here in a kind of sweet, Platonic way. I can't gohome, and you know what they did to Lori. Mavra Chang might be my only way outof this. Don't worry." She paused, then added, "But even if for some reason Idon't come back, don't give up. I'm going to do what seems best at the moment. Idon't intend getting caught or shot, but no matter what, you find them. You findthem and get them to that Well."</p>
<p>They knew that nothing they could say and nothing they could do short of tyingher up would change her mind, so they let her go.</p>
<p>Once outside, Julian looked around until she found what had to be the messiest,gooeyest mass of dark brown mud anywhere and then got down and rolled in ituntil she was literally covered with the stuff. There was a heavy mist startingup; it wouldn't dry out very easily.</p>
<p>Then, on all fours for maximum traction, she started off up the tracks in thedirection of the end of the line somewhere far off, searching less forindividuals than for hope.</p>
<p>Juana Campos was thinking as they made their way slowly and laboriously down themountainside, almost tree by tree. The girls had acquitted themselves well intheir first real trial; for the first time, she was beginning to have actualrespect for their potential.</p>
<p>All along I have been thinking like a woman, she told herself. I have beenthinking like the mistress of the local don. I am more than that. That I am awoman I cannot change, but I am also Juan Carlo Rodriges Campos de la Montoya,son of Don Francisco Campos, the greatest man of modern Peru. If I am a woman,so be it, but I will not think like one. Taluud, you will not be the one torebuild in Clopta, this I swear! Before I am through, they will bow and scrapeto me as they did to you. Here begins the future of power in Clopta! No more thinking small, of amnesties and rewards. Those who truly had the powerin this world would have to acknowledge her, or a certain little birdie would govisiting the Well. Take it or leave it.</p>
<p>Those amateurs hunting for their friends would not climb up the mountain again,and the only real threat from them had been taken out. Gen Taluud would not beso timid. He would send his men up there and find them gone. Then they would seethe signs and figure out what she'd done, and they'd come hunting. Hunting ontheir big, fat horses. If they could shoot an invisible thing, then how mucheasier to shoot them off their mounts! Hell, just potting Genny would probablydo it.</p>
<p>Once down the hill, she'd find the perfect place, and there they'd camp and laytheir ambush. They would wait until the others came. Then whoever was left wouldhave to deal with her!</p>
<p>And part of that price would be completing the set. Then it would all be right.Then this world would also dance to a Campos melody!</p>
<p>It was easy to find the railroad; a train came by every hour by day and everytwo or three by night. Whatever they traded, the Mixtim sure traded a lot.Finding the spot in a light rain before darkness fell would be more difficultbut not impossible. The trees and rocks around there were almost made to benatural fortresses, and she knew how Genny and his men thought. The other two listened in amazement to the plan, but with growing excitement.Not just Kuzi, the new supreme lieutenant, but even Audlay was saying, "Can Ihave a gun this time, Juana? Please? I been wanting to shoot some guys for thelongest time!"</p>
<p>"Pretty one, if I thought you could even hit a mountain with a gun, I wouldgladly let you," Campos told her. "But you can be just as important and coverthe one area that neither Kuzi nor I can. Just be patient. We must find our spotand prepare it well tonight. I think they will come tomorrow."</p>
<p>Julian had worked her way slowly along the tracks until well after dark beforeshe decided that she had to have gone too far and started back. At that, she almost missed them. They were quite well dug in and nearlyinvisible from the road. It was only the fact that they expected their troubleto come from the southeast that betrayed them at all. Once or twice the one onguard looked out from this direction toward the freight yard, and when thathappened, Julian's infrared vision abilities caught a glimpse of a head. Now that she had found them, though, she didn't know quite what she was going todo. Something inside her told her that no matter what situation she was in, shesimply could not take offensive action. It was something inside her that waspart of what made her a very different person from the one she'd once been. Shecould instinctively defend herself-that she'd discovered in the complex-but togo in there and harm someone not trying to do immediate harm to her-it justwasn't in her.</p>
<p>She had no weapons, anyway. In fact, she had come with nothing at all, herearrings and nose ring being the only artificial things she had. That and herbrain, which was at least working efficiently-or was it? She'd had this idea tocome here and find them, but that efficient thinking machine hadn't a clue as towhat to do with what she'd discovered.</p>
<p>She wondered if she could get around them and spot where Lori and Mavra were andwhat their situation was. It might give her an opportunity. She moved into theforest and up and around the Cloptans' camp.</p>
<p>They had picked their spot very well. No matter what the angle, Julian couldn'tquite get in back of them or above them with any kind of clear view. She knewbetter than to try to get in really close. They'd trapped Gus somehow, so whatchance would she have?</p>
<p>She realized she was making excuses for herself, but it didn't matter. She wasstill too much the Erdomese female to be capable of aggression or even of doingmost things on her own. It was like knowing everything there was to know aboutflying a plane and then discovering that she had acrophobia. In fact, althoughshe knew that the only rational course was to go back and warn the Dillians, shefound herself unable to bring herself to risk detection by the ambushers. Forall the false bravado at the complex, she still had nightmares about it, inparticular about being jumped from behind. She'd done it once, because that hadbeen the group and she'd gone with the group, but she doubted she could do itagain-especially on her own.</p>
<p>I'm as much of a freak as Mavra, Lori, and those poor things back in thecomplex, she thought miserably. I'm still the same scared, wimpy little Erdomesecow I was before, only they made it impossible for me to like guys who candefend me.</p>
<p>She tried to figure out some way to actually act, to make something happen, andcame up with a hundred different things, but she just couldn't do any of them. She wondered what she would do if the Dillians came walking up the tracks intothe ambush. Would she have the nerve to warn them, or would she be forced towatch them be cut down?</p>
<p>Shortly after dawn there was a change in the camp. Voices and the sound andscents of things being prepared for a breakfast.</p>
<p>Women's voices, unmistakable even with that Cloptan rasp.</p>
<p>Julian envied them even as she hated them. It wasn't fair, she thought, findingtears of self-pity rising within her that she was also powerless to stop. Abastard like Campos gets to act decisively, and I can't even work to save myfriends! About two hours after dawn came the unmistakable sound of horses, andJulian feared she was about to witness what she'd worried about all night.However, it wasn't the Dillians who were coming up the tracks but somebody else.Those voices were definitely all coming from men.</p>
<p>"Only three Cloptans!" Campos hissed. "Three and that blob thing." She lookedover at Kuzi, who had her rifle out and poised, and then back at Audlay. "Youready?" They both nodded.</p>
<p>"Hold it! I hear a train coming-from the south, I think!" Campos whispered."Wait until the train is almost to them. Then take out the two on this sidefirst. The noise might keep the other two from even noticing the shots. Theywon't have a clue where we are or even that we're here until the train passes,and then we've got them cold."</p>
<p>Gen Taluud heard the train as well. He and the colonel were on the far side ofthe tracks, and the other two were on the near side. As the train approached, hesaid, "Let's all get over there and let the train pass! There's not muchmaneuvering room for horses over here!"</p>
<p>Campos could hardly believe her good fortune. "Back two first! Same idea!" shehissed, and Kuzi nodded again.</p>
<p>Suddenly the train was upon them, belching steam and smoke, the Mixtimiteengineer sounding the whistle as a warning.</p>
<p>Campos and Kuzi fired their rifles from braced positions dead on, and the twogunmen in back fell off their horses. One of the horses bolted forward,startling Taluud and unbalancing him, and Campos's squeezed-off shot caught himin the shoulder instead of the head. He whirled in the saddle and screamed atthe colonel.</p>
<p>Kuzi's shot struck the colonel dead in the "chest" area of his manlike ridingform, but it passed right through and didn't seem to do much more than knock hima little off balance.</p>
<p>Campos had expected that, but now she actually stood up, fully exposed, as thetrain rumbled off into the distance, and shouted, "Hey! Genny! Over here, baby!” The big boss of Clopta looked up from nursing his wound, saw her aiming directlyat him, and shouted, "No! Doll! Wait!"</p>
<p>She fired, and his head nearly exploded, with brains flying as he toppled offthe horse in a heap.</p>
<p>"That is very impressive," the colonel shouted to them. "But you may shoot me asmuch as you like. It is very difficult to find my vital spots, you know, and Iam coming up there to embrace you all!"</p>
<p>The shape got off the horse, and Kuzi pumped five heavy-caliber shells into himbefore his manlike shape dissolved and he began flowing toward them up the sideof the sheltering rock.</p>
<p>Suddenly it was not the two shooters but Audlay, teeth showing, who stood atopthe rock holding a pot filled with something. "Hey! Blobbo! Want a little bath?"she asked, and emptied the contents of the pot on top of the colonel. The colonel froze, then asked, "What is this? Do you think this will stop me?" Campos and Kuzi emerged from either side of the rock outcrop. Both of them wereholding torches.</p>
<p>"No, sir, it is more like a relative of kerosene," Campos said. "Would you likea light?"</p>
<p>The colonel didn't have a ceiling or corner to run to, and he had no knowledgethat Audlay wasn't at the top with a torch of her own.</p>
<p>"No! Wait! You need me!" he cried out. "How do we need you?" Campos came back,hesitating and wondering if she was a fool to do so.</p>
<p>"I had a deal with Taluud! He was going to run everything! The whole show! I wasto get my own home hex as absolute ruler!"</p>
<p>So that was it. "So why do I need you now?"</p>
<p>"You don't know who to talk to! I do! I know who pulls the strings up to thecouncillor level! You can only deal with the government up front!" "Oh, yes? And perhaps we put out these torches and you eat us, huh? I thinkperhaps we do not have enough guarantees. We will do this ourselves!" "My word was always good to a Campos!" he retorted. "I am Colonel JorgeLunderman!"</p>
<p>"Lunderman? The one who worked for my father!"</p>
<p>"Si! Si! Yo siempre encontre su padre para ser un hom-bre mas honorado! Y el, ala vez, tuvo no razon para me dudar. No una ves!" the colonel said urgently. Campos was impressed. "jYo tengo su palabra ahora, como estuvo con mi padre, tanestard entre nosotros tambien?"</p>
<p>"Sobre el honor de mis ascendientes y antes de el Dios y el Virgen Santo, si!" "Colonel, this may be the one fatal mistake I make, but I believe you," JuanaCampos told him. "Kuzi, it is all right. Put out your torch. The colonel and Ihave just come to an agreement."</p>
<p>Kuzi looked hesitant. "You're sure? What was that you were saying in that funnylanguage?"</p>
<p>"Nothing is certain, but I think so, yes. I asked the colonel if he was willingto pledge his service to me here as he did for my father back where we both comefrom. He agreed and took a most solemn oath to that effect. Now, go see if youcan get the horses back. We can use them. It is all right."</p>
<p>The colonel oozed nervously back down the rock and reformed facing Campos. "I amhonored that you would trust me still," he told the Cloptan. "I am, however, abit amazed. At this very moment I could reach out in a second and swallow you,and what could you do about it? No, no! Do not worry! I am a man of honor. I askof you no more than I asked of Taluud, and I might tell you that I feel thatthings will be much better in your hands than in his. I am just curious as towhy you trusted me at this point."</p>
<p>Campos gave a Cloptan smile and looked up atop the rock. "It is all right,Audlay. You can put your torch out now, too!" she called.</p>
<p>The colonel started quivering like gelatin in an earthquake, and soon peals oflaughter issued forth from the mass. Finally he said, "I do believe, madame,that this is the beginning of a most wondrous partnership."</p>
<p>The Cloptan nodded. "Where are the other two men who were with your party?" "Back at the freight yard. The Dahir's in pretty poor shape from your shot, andthe others remained with him. They are now, I should hope, disarmed and wellunder control. I don't think either the men, who were only bodyguards, or theDillians will give us any trouble from now on."</p>
<p>"And the girl? She is there, too?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. She is of no consequence, however. She had some strange powers at onetime, but she appears to have lost her memory and control of those powers. Sheappears able to read surface thoughts but cannot speak. And she is very muchpregnant."</p>
<p>"Pregnant! By one of our old kind from that place here? Or from before?" 'They think before. They think it is the reason that she was not changedphysically into a different race by the Well. Is it important?" "It could be. Before they brought us to this place, they had us more or lessservice many of that cursed tribe. I was drugged; I do not know for sure whichones. It might well be someone else's, but it might, just might, be my ownchild!"</p>
<p>"It might be obvious in at least general terms once it is born. The features…"</p>
<p>"Yes, it might at that! Well, well, this puts an entirely new complexion onthings. We will want to ensure that she has that baby before we think of otheruses for her."</p>
<p>"And where are the other two in this little drama?" the colonel asked her, stillreeking of flammable oils and nervous about the fact.</p>
<p>Kuzi was bringing up the horses, which had not gone far, when they all heardAudlay give a shriek. All of them headed for the camp behind the rocks. 'They're gone!" Audlay cried. "Them no-good animals lit out on us durin' thefight!"</p>

<p>LONG BEFORE THE GUNFIGHT MAVRA HAD STARTED TO WORK once more on Lori's rope.Being a nocturnal creature had certain advantages, one of which was seeing quitewell in the dark, even if not quite in the same way she used to think of asclear vision.</p>
<p>It was clear that the women were setting up an ambush; the odds of all three ofthem being required to pull it off were equally good. She and Lori werevirtually ignored once they had been staked out.</p>
<p>Campos was very smart, a lot smarter than Mavra had given her credit for in thepast, but the Cloptan was not without some basic human failings, one of whichwas that she'd clearly begun to regard both Mavra and Lori as the animals theyappeared to be, forgetting the minds buried within. This was often a fatalmistake on the Well World, and while it couldn't, unfortunately, be fatal here,it meant that Campos never thought that Mavra would be able to untie theslipknot holding Lori or that Lori, with a patience and dedication no horsecould maintain, would simultaneously be chewing through the rope tied to Mavra'sleg.</p>
<p>By morning it was merely a matter of pretending to still be restrained andhoping that the women would be too concerned with the coming showdown to checkon the pair, who were in any event within clear eyeshot of them. When the sound of oncoming riders was heard and the three Cloptans scrambled fortheir positions, Mavra looked at Lori and Lori just nodded. When the first shotsrang out, Lori went down on his forelegs and Mavra scrambled aboard as best shecould, then grabbed the rope still around Lori's neck with the claws on her feetand held on for dear life as Lori took off.</p>
<p>Watching nervously, Julian was startled to see the break and immediately movedaway from the ambush and followed them.</p>
<p>Mavra could stay on only for so long in that precarious position, particularlywith a trailing rope, and fell off two or three hundred meters into the woods.Lori felt her slip, stopped as soon as he could, and turned back to help her.Suddenly a ghostly, filthy mud-caked shape moved from the trees toward Mavra,who was struggling to get up. At first Lori thought it had to be one of themysterious creatures who were the dominant race in Leba, but she soon realizedthat it was someone far more familiar, someone she knew…</p>
<p>Julian put up a hand to Lori to reassure him, then examined Mavra, who'd stoppedtrying to struggle to her feet when she realized somebody else was there. It was easy for Julian, even with her hard mittenlike hands, to get the rope offMavra's leg and then set her on her feet. She then gestured to Lori to approach,put Mavra on his back, then used the rope she'd just freed to secure the largebird to the pony's torso.</p>
<p>"Can either of you understand me?" she whispered, as only a few voices could beheard in the distance, the train and shots now long past. Getting no immediateresponse and not wanting to waste any more time, she pointed to Mavra's bill andthen to the other rope around Lori's neck. Holding on with the bill and relyingon the wrapped-around torso rope to keep her body on, it looked like she mightactually be able to ride.</p>
<p>Julian pointed farther into the forest, away from the sounds in back of them,and they proceeded onward. Mavra was uncomfortable but fairly secure upon Lori'sback, and Julian reverted to all fours to set a steady but not exhausting pacethat covered ground without risking more spills.</p>
<p>They did not stop for hours, not until Julian's thirst was too much to ignore.As soon as she passed a pool of water off to their right, she slowed and headedfor it, Lori following, and together they drank. Then Julian untied Mavra andset her down so she, too, could drink and perhaps exercise or feed. In the darkness of the thick forest Mavra had some reasonable vision, althoughnothing like what true night would bring. Everything was there but washed out.as in a faded photograph. She was exhausted and felt like she was starving, andher back was killing her from riding like that. And yet…</p>
<p>She hadn't felt this good since she'd reentered the Well World. She was free again! It didn't matter what she was or where she was; it onlymattered that she was again delivered from her enemies.</p>
<p>Different insects were out in the day from in the night, but she had enoughpractice now to figure out where they were and find them. She wanted to makesure that she didn't get out of sight of the other two, but she also wanted toeat as much as possible. She hoped that Julian would discover by herself orsomehow be made to understand that they should travel long and hard but only atnight, when they would have the advantage of better vision.</p>
<p>After Julian ate some fruit that she found on the forest floor, she went intothe pool and tried to wash out as much of the mud as possible. It usually wasn'ta good idea for an Erdomese to take a bath of this scale, but once in a whiledidn't hurt and this was certainly necessary. It was also damned cold water,which meant she had no urge to linger.</p>
<p>Still, she did feel better when she got out and was more her old self again,although there did seem to be places where the mud would never wash out. Whatshe really needed, she thought, was dryness, the heat and near absence ofhumidity for which her body was designed. Thoughts of the desert and its feeland its beauty had crept into her mind off and on of late, particularly whileshe was just sitting there in Agon. As much as it would kill her, she could notbanish Erdom's call to its own. She very much wanted to go back there, but notlike this and not while that foul system endured.</p>
<p>She wondered if Lori felt it, too, or whether he felt much of anything. Clearly the two of them had hatched this escape plot, but did that mean thatthey could understand each other? Somehow she doubted it, at least on a verballevel. They hadn't exactly been making bizarre sounds at one another, anyway.Think, Julian, think! You may not be much good at anything else, but you arevery good at thinking!</p>
<p>That had been her trouble in the beginning, she realized now. Unable to face herposition and limitations, she'd stopped thinking and started to let others doall her thinking for her. That was exactly the wrong way. Thinking thingsthrough, learning all that could be learned, solving problems and deliveringsolutions-these were things not everybody was very good at. If she couldn'tphysically, psychologically, or culturally carry them out, there was alwayssomeone who could.</p>
<p>What about writing? Translators did nothing about writing ability any more thanthey covered up one's previous language skills. They were an enhancement tovocal communication, that was all. She looked around for a stick, found one, andwent back over to Lori. She might not be much at writing with those hands, but she sure as hell could block print.</p>
<p>In the mud near the pool she scratched, in English,</p>
<p>CAN U READ THIS?</p>
<p>Lori watched, then came over and looked down at it. It was so hard to dredge upthose old skills, but he managed. It was a little easier than it had been withMavra; at least this was English. He nodded his head.</p>
<p>Julian was excited. At least there would be some way to get through. </p>
<p>R U OK?</p>
<p>Yes. It was an absolute answer to a relative question, but there wasn't any wayto add qualifiers.</p>
<p>WHAT DO U WANT TO DO?</p>
<p>That was a deliberate attempt to provoke him into finding some way to get a morecomplex answer back. He understood its purpose but wondered how the hell hecould do it. He tried writing with the stick in his mouth, but it wasn't anyuse. Then he tried scratching in the mud with his hoof, but that didn't reallyproduce anything intelligible, either. Finally, he gave a big sigh and shook hishead negatively.</p>
<p>Maybe Mavra would be better for this, Julian thought. But what language did theyhave in common?</p>
<p>In an instant she realized that would be a good test of whether they actuallyhad a chance or were just adrift until caught or killed. If Mavra knew thecommercial standard language that Julian had spent so much time in Agon studying…</p>
<p>It was some time before Mavra had her fill and wandered back. She couldn't helpbut wonder at how those two were reacting to one another. Julian needed the oldLori, and the old Lori was gone. She approached where they were resting and sawthe regular scratches in the mud. She hadn't thought Julian capable of it; maybeshe'd changed personalities yet again since the last time they'd been together. Julian had been dozing but awoke when she sensed someone nearby. Spotting Mavra,she reached for the stick and then went over and smoothed out the mud. Thebasically ideographic Well World standard commercial language was versatile butnot easy, and she had only a limited command of it. Still, Mavra could have no better command of it than she if Mavra were just another person from Earth. Butif she was who she claimed to be…</p>
<p>CAN YOU READ THIS? Julian scratched, then carefully placed the stick in Mavra'sbill. Mavra went over and looked at the writing and was so surprised at what shesaw that she almost dropped it. How the hell did Julian learn that! Don't ask stupid questions you can't get answered, Mavra, just answer if youcan.</p>
<p>I CAN READ IT, Mavra scratched back. It looked awful compared with Julian's, butit was sufficient.</p>
<p>WHAT DO WE DO NOW?</p>
<p>Mavra wrote back, RUN LIKE HELL.</p>
<p>Julian laughed. If somebody could give an answer like that after being like thisfor so long, she was something special indeed.</p>
<p>THEN?</p>
<p>Mavra took the stick. HEAD NORTH THEN WEST TO AVENUE.</p>
<p>Avenue? What was an avenue here? It was a formal and distinct ideograph all itsown; that indicated an important noun, a real place.</p>
<p>WHY?</p>
<p>GET IN WELL. MAKE THINGS RIGHT, Mavra Wrote.</p>
<p>Make things right… Right for whom? Julian wondered. Still, it was the answershe had both hoped for and expected.</p>
<p>GO BY NIGHT, SLEEP BY DAYS, Julian suggested.</p>
<p>THEY WILL BE WAITING FOR US.</p>
<p>They? Campos? The colonel? The Dillians? who is THEY? </p>
<p>EVERYBODY. ARMIES. WHOLE WORLD.</p>
<p>That was alarming. NO OTHER WAY IN?</p>
<p>MANY. LONG WAY. TOO LONG.</p>
<p>HOW FAR?</p>
<p>ONE HEX LENGTH N, HALF WEST.</p>
<p>That meant maybe 250 miles north, give or take, and half that west. A reallylong way to go on foot, and with nothing but themselves and their wits. She hadthought, or at least hoped, that they had traveled farther by train, but shehadn't really paid attention to the map, and Mavra probably was guessing, too.It could be less. Or more.</p>
<p>you will get in, she scratched to Mavra. Somehow or another we have to. They'd be corning for them, that was for sure, but even Julian knew that theodds of catching anybody in this environment were as slim as the odds of theiractually pulling this off. On the other hand, at least there wouldn't be a lotof talkative natives.</p>
<p>Or would there? All this way and she still hadn't the slightest idea what thenatives of this hex really were.</p>
<p>She got up and started looking around. They hadn't come very far, that was forsure, but they'd come some way inland. Did the natives leave the forest aswilderness and cluster in places off the beaten track?</p>
<p>The trees were huge, creating a vast canopy of green above. There were scads ofinsects, both crawling and flying, and while they looked suitably bizarre andlike nothing on Earth, they were clearly recognizable as insects. There might bebirds, but if so, they remained pretty high up and weren't apparent. About the only really odd thing was a kind of vine that seemed to grow in thickclumps down the trees, giving them almost the appearance of wearing skirts. Shewondered how strong the vines were. The rope solution for keeping Mavra onLori's back wasn't a good one, but the vines might give her more flexibility.Julian went over to a low-hanging mass of them and examined them. The vineslooked back.</p>
<p>She was so startled, she backed away. There were eyes of a sort on the ends ofthose things! Or at least they sure looked like eyes, one per vine ending. And now the vines moved in a cluster. Quite slowly and lazily, yet asdeliberately as snakes, which they reminded Julian of.</p>
<p>She walked a bit to the right, and the clump of eyes slowly followed her. Backto the left, the same. She wasn't imagining it!</p>
<p>Were they all part of a single organism, part of the tree, or parasites on it?Some sort of plantlike worms, perhaps? She'd better find out, she decided,because now that this bunch had blown their cover, as it were, all the vines onall the other trees were looking at her, too.</p>
<p>This may be the dumbest thing I've ever done in a lifetime of dumb things, shethought furiously, but it's worth a try.</p>
<p>"Hello." she said. "We are strangers here, brought here by others. Bad people weare now trying to escape from. We don't want to harm anything, but we do notknow the rules here. Are you the Lebans?"</p>
<p>Did translators work even on plants? Or was she talking to a common variety ofparasitic worm with no more intelligence than any other worm?</p>
<p>The vines got very agitated and seemed to speed up their motion, curling in andout, back and forth among one another until it looked like they were caught insome sort of windstorm. The other clusters on other trees were doing much thesame.</p>
<p>It's almost like they're talking with each other, discussing me, she thought,still not sure if she wasn't just imagining this. She looked nervously upwardinto the trees for perhaps a giant open mouth at the end of the tendrils, butwhile they did vanish into the upper reaches of the tree, there was no clearbody to them.</p>
<p>But how were they talking, if that was what it was? While the translator mightbe able to get through to them if, presumably, whatever they were attached tohad some way to hear or feel vibrations, what if they communicated by a totallydifferent means? That was still assuming that she was talking to Lebans. Now isthe kind of time when I wish I could confer with the others, she thought. There was suddenly the sound of a wind, although she could feel no air movingagainst her skin.</p>
<p>Then there came a deep, melodic bass tone that seemed to come from within thetree itself. Incredibly, it seemed to be forming words, although they were abizarre-sounding monotone, like trying to listen to conversation from theworld's largest one-note tuba.</p>
<p>"You may pass in safety," the voice seemed to say. "Do not touch the vines. Donot harm the trees. Eat what you will of the forest floor but pick nothing." She wasn't crazy! These were the Lebans! "We will obey all of your rules. Ipromise," she told the clusters of eyes. "We go north by night to the equatorbeyond your lands."</p>
<p>"We have heard what the others have done," the monotonous horn responded. "Theywill not find you in Leba if you give Leba respect."</p>
<p>"It is a very pretty place," she said, trying to butter them up a bit, stillwondering if they were the vines, the trees, or something inside the trees andout of sight. "But it is not our place. We would not harm it, and we need toleave it. Um… You wouldn't happen to know which way is north?" The vines swirled, curled, and then pointed off in one direction. "Thank you,"she told them. "I must get some sleep now. We have a long way to go." "You will not be disturbed," the voice promised.</p>
<p>The vines slowly subsided in their rhythm, then hung limp and still once more. It was very odd, but she felt like she could sleep here now. She wasn't exactlysure why and she probably could never explain it to the others, even if they'dbelieve it, but she felt suddenly more secure, no longer watched but ratherwatched over.</p>
<p>If you are polite to the Lebans and show respect, they are very friendly… Somehow she'd just have to make do with the ropes.</p>
<p>She wondered what would happen to somebody who wasn't polite and respectful. Theones who would be after them might be such people. One could certainly outrun aLeban, but one couldn't run out of them. She wondered just how strong thosetendril-like vines could be…</p>
<p>Somehow Anne Marie was not surprised to see three Cloptan men and the colonelride out and three Cloptan women and the colonel ride back in. "Ever the Talleyrand type, aren't you, Colonel?" she said with acidic sweetness. "What's she talking about?" Juana Campos asked him suspiciously. 'Talleyrand," the colonel explained, "was a pragmatist in royalist France. Aminor functionary, he saw the French Revolution coming and, when it happened,helped the revolutionaries find royalists and arrest them. He survived the reignof terror, survived the excesses, and in the end supported a young officer namedNapoleon who became emperor himself and made Talleyrand a count. When Napoleonfaced defeat, he negotiated with the old royalists and brought them back topower. He died a wealthy and respected statesman, in bed, of old age, but henever betrayed those he served or lost his honor, which is why they all trustedhim. I do not consider her comment an insult but rather a compliment." The two gunmen were more shocked and not as understanding. That had to be putright immediately.</p>
<p>"Listen, you two, you are very fortunate to have been here!" Juana Campos toldthem. "You are still alive and you have futures, if you wish to take thecolonel's example. Taluud is dead. His empire in Clopta is even now beingcrushed. You have a choice to make. Serve me in the same way you served Taluudand you will prosper and be high in the new organization I will build when thisis over. Choose wrongly and I will allow you to enjoy the colonel's embrace. Ido not need you for controlling this lot, but I can certainly use you." The two men didn't like it; their own world was being turned upside down in thesame way their captives' had been. Still, the alternative was certainly worse."All right, ma'am. We'll stay with you," one said.</p>
<p>She nodded. "You will take orders from me and from Kuzi here as if she werespeaking my own words. You will keep your manners intact as regards all three ofus and will keep your hands off. Be faithful, and your rewards will be great.Hesitate, foul up, or betray us, and you will be dead. Remember that if you aretesting any of us with your manly strength, you are also testing that strengthagainst all of us, including the colonel. You understand that? Do you understandthat?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am," they both said.</p>
<p>"You call them 'ma'am.' You call me 'boss.' "</p>
<p>"Yes, boss."</p>
<p>Campos looked around and saw Terry. For her part, the girl was totally confusedas to what had gone on, but she understood that Gus had been hurt and that thosewho had hurt him were now in control. Of them all, though, it was Campos whoterrified her. There was something there, inside her, something awful,particularly when she looked at Terry. It was not something that could beexplained but rather something that was intrinsic, something ancient, somethingrarely glimpsed. The colonel had elements of it, and so had the duckmen, but inCampos it was not hidden, it was not partial, it was the essence of her, and itwas frightening.</p>
<p>It was pure, uncompromised, unequivocated evil.</p>
<p>And yet somehow, while she felt Campos's particular evil whenever she looked ather, she also sensed that at least for now. that evil was not a direct threat.Not yet. For some reason Campos did not want to harm the baby. Campos felt such satisfaction at finally having Terry in her clutches that itwas a moment before she realized that something was wrong. The two Dillians, thegirl, the big monster in the shed…</p>
<p>"Where is the other? The Erdomite?"</p>
<p>"These were the only ones here. We checked the whole place out thoroughly," oneof the gunmen said.</p>
<p>Campos turned to Tony and Anne Marie. "All right- where is she? And no games!" "We don't know, and that's the truth," Tony told her. "She left us yesterdayevening to go to scout for where you might be. She thought you'd head for thetracks and perhaps lay an ambush. We haven't seen or heard from her since. Whenshe didn't come back with you, we thought perhaps she was a casualty." Campos shook her head. "So that was how it was done. While we fought withTaluud, your friend came in and liberated the others."</p>
<p>"Likely," the colonel agreed. "We had no knowledge of it. I wouldn't think she'dbe much of a threat otherwise, though. Their women don't have the proper handsand are not otherwise built for fighting. You are certain that the other twocannot understand each other or anyone but you?"</p>
<p>"I am certain of that, yes. They cannot talk, which means they cannot plot witheach other. I see your point. But they are going to be very difficult to trackand to catch in this terrain."</p>
<p>"Perhaps. Perhaps not. They will feel us at their backs no matter where they runand whether we are there or not. They will zig, and zag, and perhaps get lost afew times, but eventually they will get their bearings. In the end, we know thedirection in which they must go. They must go to Verion, then west, to thenorthwest corner of that place. They have no other choice."</p>
<p>Campos looked at the Leeming and frowned. "You believe it, then? That if she canget inside, she can become like a god?"</p>
<p>"Until I got to know Captain Brazil, I thought it was nonsense," Lunderman admitted. "And then, after, when I saw him survive what would have, should havekilled anything alive, I was nearly convinced. But it was when talking with Tonyhere, back before the raid, that I became certain that this is not nonsense." "Why?"</p>
<p>"You were dragged here. So was Gus. Lori and even the girl here were more orless brought here by Mavra Chang. I and our missing Erdomese fell through byaccident. But there is no getting around it. Nathan Brazil walked here,knowingly, of his own free will. He invited these two to come along. He promisedthem what they achieved. And Mavra Chang, too, took great risks to voluntarilycome through. Of all of us, only Brazil and Chang came freely, knowingly. Why?Because they knew what they would find here. And of all of us, only they and thegirl here, whose pregnancy prevented a change, remained Earth-human. All therest of us were dramatically transformed. No, it is beyond chance. And wheredoes that pair try and head once they set out separately, independently? To theequator. To the door inside the world. No, it more defies logic to deny theirtrue nature than to believe in it, however fanciful. They are not human. Theyhave merely chosen to appear that way. Brazil may heal, but he is out of this.Safely away. That leaves Mavra Chang, and I do not believe mat she will let anyobstacle stand in her way."</p>
<p>"She could just wait. Bide her time and wait for Brazil to save her. After all,she cannot know he is a prisoner."</p>
<p>"No, I believe we took care of that possibility. They are rivals. Each isconvinced that the other means to assume total and sole control. As far as Changis concerned, this race is still on. She cannot afford to wait." "She'll know that we know this, too. Is Verion the only door?" "No, there are many, but she will be forced to go for Verion because it isclosest. Any other choice means more travel, more hexes, more chances ofdiscovery, and, most of all, much more time."</p>
<p>"Will it be guarded?"</p>
<p>"There is a token force there. There is one at all of them. Nothing that cannotbe handled, though. I have authority with some of the council even now, andthose two have authority with others. A nontech hex, a boring and routine guardassignment-it should not be much of a problem."</p>
<p>"What makes you think we'll help you?" Tony asked him.</p>
<p>"Several things. First, it is your only hope of returning to Dillia alive.Second, there is still one of your number that you might well be able to help,and that is all you were ever promised. And third and finally, your friends herewill need you. We can transport our party and supplies, but Gus either travelswith you or he must be disposed of here and now. I would like to keep him aroundbecause it will keep the girl in line and certain to stick close to us as well.By the same token, concern for her safety will keep him in line, even if hefully recovers. But you must understand that you are the most expendable of usall."</p>
<p>Campos looked at the centaurs. "Think about this, Dillians. It would take verylittle to spoil those pretty looks for good. You will do nothing except what youare ordered to do. You will take no hostile action against us. You will saynothing to others except what we tell you to say or both of your tongues will becut out. Do anything, anything that displeases me and I will blind you. You arepackhorses to me, nothing more. Raise a hand or a weapon against me and you willlose both weapon and hand. Try and escape and I will kill you. If you make it,the ones who remain will suffer your punishment. The girl, for example, does notneed eyes or ears or hands to do what I am interested in. She will not leave herstrange paramour, and she will be kept close to me and the colonel at all times. Do we have an understanding here?"</p>
<p>"I believe we do, yes," Tony said gravely. But if I could kill you, even at thecost of my own life, I think I would do it.</p>
<p>"Well, get the big lizard ready to move, then," Campos instructed. "Even as heis, I want him tied down to the litter at all times, and one of you must alwaysbe watching him. With these horses and supplies, where they can go, we can go;where we cannot, I doubt if they could, either. We will track them if we can. Ifwe lose them, we go for Verion immediately. Now, move!"</p>

<p>Verion</p>
</title>
<empty-line/>
<p>Julian had no way to mark time in Leba, but it had seemed an interminablejourney, made all the more so by her inability to really talk with anybody. Sure, she did some questions and answers with Lori, who seemed to need somemental contact anyway, and some more bits-and-pieces discussions with Mavra bythe stick method, but those were almost always to ask specific things or just tokeep from going nuts. The Lebans remained friendly and true to their word, butthey weren't exactly conversationalists, either.</p>
<p>The journey had been an extremely rough one, and it wasn't over yet. The wholeplace was mountainous and wet, much like the Olympic range of Washington statebut without the trails. The Lebans could be counted on to recommend a route orkeep them pointed in the right direction but not for much else. They werecertainly friendly, though, in their own way; as they'd gone on, the Lebanswould often shake fruit right off limbs when nothing obvious was available toeat.</p>
<p>Still, there had been no distinctive landmarks or anything to mark the progressof their journey. After a while one stream valley looked like another, and allthe mountains looked pretty much alike as well. It was impossible for someonewith her build and hooves to walk bipedally and not lose her balance over andover; still, she'd been walking on all fours so long by this point, she wasn'tsure she remembered how to use just two. Once she'd threatened, even prepared,to go off and live in the wild alone. How stupid that seemed now! Thus, when sunrise neared to mark the probable end of yet another day, Julian,like her companions, was just silently trudging along, coming over yet one morerise. Suddenly she saw something she hadn't seen in so long, she'd almostforgotten what it looked like.</p>
<p>Sunlight. Sunlight just creeping over the landscape, a little bright on thisside, much duller beyond what seemed like a vast semitransparent curtain. The border! It had to be! And if the Lebans hadn't been playing an enormouspractical joke on them, beyond lay Verion.</p>
<p>She shrieked with such delight that Lori stopped, and both he and Mavra lookedover, concerned that Julian might be in some trouble. Julian turned to them, putout her forearm, and pointed.</p>
<p>She felt like rushing to it, and the hell with the daylight, but she knew thatwould be the worst thing to do. If there was sunlight in Verion, then perhapsthere were Verionites who were not as friendly as the Lebans.</p>
<p>Best to remain on the same regimen, she knew, although it was hard, really hard,not to push on. That boundary didn't just mean that they were passing into a newclimate, a new land, but the final land, the destination point. And even thoughit would still take them a great deal of time to reach that destination, theyhad been safe, almost protected in a way, in Leba, with the natives watching outfor them and with plenty of food and water and at least reliable help with thedirections. That, out there, was more than just another unknown land and people. Somewhere beyond that final curtain was the enemy. They had no illusions aboutthat, Mavra the least of all. It didn't take a genius to figure out that theVerion Avenue was the only practical choice they could make, and so they'd bewaiting there, right near the end, waiting for them to walk into a trap. That was another reason Mavra had insisted they not go elsewhere, though. Verionwas a nontech hex; nothing but muscle, water, and wind worked there, as inErdom. That also meant no radios, no instant communications, no tracking scopesand sophisticated monitoring systems. The enemy knew where they would wind upbut not when. They could pick the time and the opportunity.</p>
<p>A lot, then, would depend on the Verionites, whatever they were. Would they besearching for them with a reward for their capture? Would they be hostile toeverybody? There was no way to know in advance.</p>
<p>In fact, Mavra had been almost insistent on finding out something about them. Ifthe Verionites were nocturnals, for example, they might do better moving by dayand remaining just this side of the border until they were close to the Avenue. The Lebans knew, but it was no use asking them directly. Simile wasn't alwayseffective in a translator conversation, particularly when one party didn't haveone.</p>
<p>Still, she tried. "Are the Verionites animals?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Do they eat meat or grain?"</p>
<p>"Anything."</p>
<p>"Are they larger or smaller than we are?"</p>
<p>"About the same."</p>
<p>"Are they friendly to visitors or unfriendly?"</p>
<p>"Unknown. They seem all right to us."</p>
<p>Not exactly a great deal of help.</p>
<p>"Will we be able to find food over there?"</p>
<p>"Probably."</p>
<p>"Are they day creatures like you or night creatures like us?"</p>
<p>"Day mostly."</p>
<p>"Is there anything else we should know?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Remember to look up."</p>
<p>She was startled. "They fly?"</p>
<p>"Some do."</p>
<p>She hadn't figured on that. Flying in a nontech hex meant some kind of bird orother winged creature. That wasn't good at all. Definitely a night crossing, andwith extra attention given to concealing them from the air.</p>
<p>Still, she couldn't help but feel excited. Although there were many long,dangerous days or weeks to come, it was the first measure of real progress sinceshe'd taken up with Mavra and Lori.</p>
<p>"One last question. Do you know the way this world usually measures time?" "Yes. The railroad is quite punctual."</p>
<p>"Do you know how long it has taken us to reach this border?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Fifteen days."</p>
<p>Fifteen days. "Sorry-one more and then I thank you for all your assistance. Atthis rate, how long would it take us to reach the Avenue?"</p>
<p>"Another twelve days to reach the equator, then ten. If you can go exactlynorthwest, ten to twelve days for the whole journey."</p>
<p>"I thank you. I will always hold the Lebans in my heart as true and trustedfriends. I have had very few since I came here."</p>
<p>"We are pleased to know this."</p>
<p>It was time to make some plans.</p>
<p>Mavra was all for heading straight for the destination by the shortest route.Lori wanted to take it slower and more cautiously, not feeling the same sense ofurgency.</p>
<p>In the end it was up to Julian, of course. Their opponents might expect them totake the shortest route, but then again, how would they know when she and theother two would emerge from Leba and where? In a sense, straight to the goal wasthe safest course; it meant the least distance to move, and that lessened theirchances of being spotted and reported. Mavra didn't like the idea of fliers,though, any more than Julian did. Fliers could cover pretty good distances inshort periods of time, vital for reconnaissance in a no-tech hex. But if theLebans were right, and Julian interpreted their answer to mean that theVerionites probably saw about as well at night as Earth-humans, then they had achance if they could conceal their day camps.</p>
<p>It was an all or nothing roll of the dice at this point, but it seemed like theonly way to play it.</p>
<p>Near sunset they moved out, down and through the final valley and to the Verionborder. Just looking across it, even though the hex boundary made it dark andhazy, they could see a dramatic change. Many rivers and streams crossedboundaries, as did landforms, but clearly Verion was a much drier place. Thehills continued, but the trees almost completely stopped, replaced withgrasslands and occasional bushes and other small shrubs.</p>
<p>Not a lot of cover, Julian thought worriedly. Still, there was no other way toget it done. She stepped through the border, feeling that now-familiar tinglingsensation, and into Verion.</p>
<p>It was suddenly very hot and surprisingly humid for a place that far from anocean. There wasn't much transfer between hexes beyond the immediate area of theborder, where some convection was inevitable, so this was probably how it wasgoing to feel.</p>
<p>They proceeded in, although intending only to find a reasonable place to campout of sight and wait until the next night to begin their real journey. The sky was clear, although there were some lazy-looking birds off in thedistance which Julian hoped weren't the local equivalent of vultures circlingover a kill. They traveled down the first hill, into a ravine, and then back upthe gentle slope of the next, slightly higher one, which revealed a whole newvista.</p>
<p>Beyond, the land flattened out considerably, although there were variousisolated landforms standing like bizarre sentinels as far as the eye could see.The lowlands clearly had eroded away over great periods of time, leaving pocketsof harder rock, possibly volcanic.</p>
<p>In the middle of this strange landscape of bizarre shapes and flat plains wereclearly developed areas. There were trees here, but they were far different fromthe ones in Leba: tall, thick, but without branches and with leafy growth onlyat the very tops. Julian thought they looked like palm trees that had fallen offtheir diets.</p>
<p>More important, they were clearly planted, both for ornamentation and in groves.Nearby were large fields that showed definite signs of cultivation. A fair-sizedriver cut through the middle of it, leaving a jagged canyon that looked prettyformidable. There were, however, two clear suspension-type bridges over it,showing a great deal of nontech sophistication.</p>
<p>Well, none of us are tree climbers, Julian thought, and those trees aren't goingto conceal us too much, but the fronds will give us air cover. The real problem was going to be the canyon. The only practical way across wasover one of those bridges, and during that time they would be exposed withabsolutely nowhere to run or hide.</p>
<p>She wished she knew more about the people here. She wished she knew a lot moreabout everything having to do with this place.</p>
<p>By the time they reached the first of the trees, it was clearly too close todawn to consider risking either of the bridges that night. Best to camp, getsome rest, and watch and see if any of the natives showed themselves. She wantedto see them, but not all that closely.</p>
<p>It wasn't long after dawn, just as they settled in under the trees, when she gother wish.</p>
<p>The sound of what seemed to be a wagon drew her, and she crept over to the edgeof the grove, making certain to keep as well hidden behind a tree as possible,and looked out. What she saw was one of the strangest sights yet on this bizarreworld.</p>
<p>It was a wagon, all right, and it was huge, with two big solid wheels that hadto be two meters high holding it up. What got her was that it appeared to bepulled by two oversized, very fat Earthwomen, and on top, on a tiny seat tryingto keep his balance, the one who held the reins looked for all the world like anEarth-human-size pig in a very wide brimmed straw hat and wearing a pair ofoveralls.</p>
<p>A closer look with her ability to magnify things showed that her firstimpression of the creatures pulling the wagon was wrong but that her notion ofthe driver was pretty well dead on, although Porky Pig it wasn't. That was oneugly hog up there.</p>
<p>The creatures pulling the wagon did have a humanlike shape, were bipedal, hadenormous rear ends and thighs, and seemed to have breasts as well, but the faceswere very apelike. Their backs and sides were covered with brown fur, whiletheir fronts appeared a hairless purplish skin color. For such large creatures,though, they had remarkably scrawny arms, and if those were hands, they weren'tmuch more useful than Julian's, if that. They looked to be at least seven oreight feet tall and proportioned to that height save for the arms and huge hairyfeet. They weren't pulling the cart by walking or ambling but by a kind of slowjogging canter that seemed almost horselike.</p>
<p>The draft animals had been the startling things, but the driver was moreinteresting because he didn't match what she expected at all. He certainly hadno wings, and if pigs could fly in this hex, it surely was by some means notobvious to her.</p>
<p>Were the Lebans wrong, or was there more here than she could see right now? She knew she should go back and stand a better guard as the first watch-Mavraand Lori couldn't speak, but they could surely wake the others up in a hurry ifneed be, and their judgment was the important factor in a watch-but she wantedto see how that thing got across that bridge.</p>
<p>The answer was that it didn't. Instead, several more pig creatures-hogs-emergedfrom a lemon-drop-shaped hut near the bridge and began operating an oddballsystem of pulleys and gears that revealed strong cables strung parallel to thebridge. When the cart reached them, Verionites climbed up and began stringingcable through slots along both sides while the driver unhitched his odd "team."Another set of cables was then attached to another series of poles with gearsand pulleys, and the "team" was hitched to a circular master gear on these andstarted going around and around slowly.</p>
<p>Julian watched in amazement as the entire cart body was lifted off its carriageand huge wheels and into the air, suspended by the cables. An operator at thefar end and another at the assembly right at the rim of the canyon threw aseries of giant wooden levers, changing the gearing, and the cart began actuallyto move along the cables down to the second set of gears and poles and then outover it, powered by the team on the far end.</p>
<p>It's a cable car system! she realized. A very clever and elaborate cable carsystem using the sheer muscle power of those beasts. More interestingly, it wasalso a kind of basic container system; they didn't move the carriage and wheels,only the container and its cargo.</p>
<p>Once the container was across, the team was unhitched from the system and ledacross by the driver, the bridge swaying a bit under the weight of the twobehemoths but hardly stressed. On the other side the process was reversed with anew carriage. It was slow but efficient.</p>
<p>The other, parallel bridge did not have such an assembly and was probably builtlater for routine foot traffic, which would not have to be held up waiting forteams to pass. With those draft animals and the rather imposing girth of theVerionites, traffic was pretty well limited to one way at a time, anyway. The natives were clever, quite modern, and industrious; that much was sure. Shehad the opportunity to take a magnified view of a couple of them while they weresetting up the cables, and while the faces were ugly and their figures matchedthe sort bipedal hogs might be expected to have, their arms and hands seemedquite muscular and flexible, and their feet, supporting that form and weight,more resembled those of a hippo or an elephant than a hog's. Large, wide, andflat, almost like tree trunks, they provided pretty good balance andflexibility.</p>
<p>But if those suckers could fly, she wanted to see it!</p>
<p>She wondered if perhaps such clever folk might have hot air balloons orsomething like that which the Lebans would consider flying. That was a thought,although it wasn't at all something she would have thought common in a hex likeVerion. Like Erdom, Verion was against an impenetrable barrier, in this case theequator, and so wasn't hex-shaped at all. Balloons might well be practical in acompact hex-shape, but unless they were pretty well staked down and used onlyfor lookout purposes, they were unlikely to be practical for travel here. Still, after seeing those bridges, the cable car, and the container apparatus inaction, she wouldn't put anything past these people. In a sense, she admiredthem from what little she'd seen. Most of the nontech hexes seemed to haveaccepted their lot and mummified their culture and society. Erdom was a perfectexample of this-static, with change considered a threat. The Verionites, though,had refused to accept their limits and become at least in part a culture ofengineers. It was almost as if they'd said, "Okay, here are the limits, andhere's what we want to do. Now figure out how we do it!"</p>
<p>That made them dangerous as well. They couldn't afford to treat this society asa standard, lazy nontech culture.</p>
<p>Remaining in the groves all day, Julian also noticed one other characteristic ofthe hex that seemed quite odd. Everything animal appeared to be bipedal for somereason; even the insects ran around on two legs, looking almost like miniaturevarieties of Mixtimese. Yet another very odd place, but not nearly as strange asLeba or even Mixtim.</p>
<p>That night they had to face the problem of the bridges.</p>
<p>There was no way around them; who knew how long this canyon was or how far itstretched? And even if it didn't go on forever, what of the river at the bottom,which certainly seemed large and wild running? There was a sort of tollbooth,but both it and the cable crew and shack seemed to shut down shortly after dusk;they had watched the creatures lock up and leave. Lights indicated a town nottoo far on the other side, probably a farming center and way stop for bridgetravelers, and everybody on this side seemed to cross the bridge and go off inthat direction. Whatever justified the whole system was either to the east or tothe west of them; they certainly did no traffic with Leba.</p>
<p>There was no way to be completely safe crossing the bridge, but nothing in theinfrared showed that they had left any kind of guards around, although Julianhad half expected to be barked and growled at by bipedal dogs or something. Thebig problem would be that they had no idea what was on the other side. Theguards might be there, where the bulk of the people were, since a barrier oneither side would do to block passage, or they might ring alarm bells over thereby merely shaking the bridge up and down as they walked. Although Julian hadheard nothing specific, an alarm system might be hooked up when they closed, orit might be something she wouldn't recognize as an alarm but they would. What they found was a solid wooden gate, a sign, and a large bell. The sign wasin Verionese. not commercial, so it was impossible to read it, but they couldall guess what it said: 'To use bridge, ring bell for attendant." There was an opening on either side of the gate, but it was much too small foreither Lori or Julian. Mavra went to it, looked in and up, and saw that the gatewas secured from the other side with a large wooden bar. This was one time whenher lack of arms might be an asset, although not for actually moving the thing.She was, however, able to wiggle through the opening at ground level withminimal loss of feathers and get on the other side. That left the bar, which wasa bit above her eye level. It looked to be a simple enough system, but how tomove that bar when she didn't have any arms?</p>
<p>Ultimately, she pressed her back against the gate, got her head under the bar,and tried to straighten up as much as possible. The bar moved, but not enough tocome out of its latch.</p>
<p>After several frustrating attempts, after which she realized that she needed tobe about her old height, small as that was, to get it high enough, she decidedto step out and look at the thing.</p>
<p>It was just a board, nothing spectacular but effective enough. She finallydecided that the only chance was to lift the thing as high as she could andthen, when the weight of it, which was not inconsiderable, was on her head, tomove sideways and hope she could slide it enough so that it would fall outsidethe latch on one side.</p>
<p>Several attempts failed, but finally she managed it, her head hurting like hell,and the end of the board fell to the floor of the bridge with a clunk! The otherend remained precariously balanced on the other latch.</p>
<p>Dizzy and with a whale of a headache, she nonetheless stepped back and gave offa single low squawk. Julian heard it and slowly and carefully pushed against thegate. The board jammed a couple of times, but Mavra was able to help free it,and finally they had it open enough for Lori, then Julian to squeeze through. The trouble was, if word had reached here about them and the Verionites were onthe lookout for signs of strangers, the open gate would be a signal. Julianpushed the gate closed and strained to lift the board back up into place, butshe just didn't have the strength. Lori, seeing the problem, didn't stop towonder why she was doing it but came over and put his head and neck underJulian's arms and lifted slowly, giving her the added strength she needed. Itwasn't neat, but the gate was again locked and bolted.</p>
<p>Julian helped Mavra onto Lori's back but didn't bother to tie her. At the speedat which any of them could cross the swinging span, it was unnecessary and wouldtake time they couldn't spare.</p>
<p>The roar of rapids came from far below, masking out much of the sound once theywere out over the chasm, and the bridge rippled and swung back and forth as theycrossed. But it was a sturdy and well-built structure that had seen muchtraffic. At least the idea of alarms rigged to the bridge seemed remote; therewas a distinct night breeze that caused it to sway slightly entirely on its own,making it more difficult to keep one's own balance on it but possibly explainingwhy the crossing was usually restricted to daylight.</p>
<p>There was a small house at the other end with a light inside, apparently thetoll keeper's house. Before they even reached it, the pungent smells of Verion'smasters hit them, and it wasn't much more pleasant than the odors of Mixtim,although it was more varied-the scent of massive sweat, garbage, and pungentspices all rolled into one unappetizing and somewhat sickening perfume. Just before they reached the other side, somebody came out of the house andstarted fooling with something unseen on the side of the building. They froze,and for a brief nightmare moment they had the swaying, the winds, and the odorsall at once.</p>
<p>Then whoever it was went back inside, and they finished the walk slowly andquietly, trying to keep hoof sounds to a minimum. They were relieved to see onlya small wooden crossbar on a pivot where the bridge again reached land. Asquietly as possible, Julian raised it enough for Lori to get through, thenducked under it herself.</p>
<p>The wind really started up on the other side; while unpleasant, it had theeffect of masking their own sounds as they moved between bridge and town, acrossthe road, and around the main settlement.</p>
<p>Well over a hundred more miles of this, Julian thought nervously. Too long insuch a civilized country. They had gotten lucky this time, but there was no wayof knowing what other obstacles this land had in store for them before theyreached the final and largest obstacle of them all.</p>
<p>Beyond the town the bizarre mixture of twisted land-forms-spires, pinnacles,tiny table rocks-grew even more dense, and the Verionites had planted virtuallyevery available space in between. Here and there were virtual herds of the huge,lumbering bipedal draft animals just wandering about or lying around soundasleep and snoring loudly. The wind rippled the grains and grasses as if theywere a gigantic sea and made its own series of groans and moans as it twisted inand out and all around the natural statuary.</p>
<p>As morning approached and false dawn was illuminating the western sky, Juliansearched for a good camp. She was beginning to wonder if perhaps she hadmisunderstood the "up" warning of the Lebans or if there were Verionitesentinels, like shepherds, atop some of the broader rock forms as watchmen. It was still hard to see, though, how they'd get up or down without wings. They would have to camp at the base of one of them, though-a particularly largetower of twisted black rock that had shallow cavelike indentations at the basethat would provide at least some cover. There was no choice; it would have todo.</p>
<p>Julian, as usual, took the first watch. Mavra's own sense of time from watchingthe shadows seldom failed her here; her second watch was as reliable asJulian's. Only Lori seemed to have little sense of time, so he took the lastwatch, since it was fairly difficult to miss the sun going down if the othersweren't already awake by then.</p>
<p>For Mavra, so long out of the chase, every step took her closer to her goal.Somehow, some way, she would get inside. Nothing and no one was going to stopher this time. Lori, on the other hand, was going through the motions withlittle hope; everything that could go wrong up to now had, and he fullyexpected, after such an epic walk, to wind up caught and back in the hands ofthe enemy when they reached wherever it was they were going.</p>
<p>It hardly mattered to him anymore if they even got there. Seeing Julian andbeing so dependent on her all this time could only remind him of what he hadlost. Considering how she'd handled herself so far, she needed him or anythinghe might do other than carry Mavra about as much as he needed a sewing kit. Hedidn't even have desire, only a sense of guilt and loss.</p>
<p>For Julian, although taking it one day at a time, there was a sense of theendgame in this. She hadn't the slightest idea if they could get Mavra into thisWell place or not or what would really happen if they could, but either theywould or they would not. If they did, then at least victory would be denied theevil people both from Earth and from this world. If they couldn't, she waspretty sure they'd not be given a second chance at it.</p>
<p>Anything you desire. That had been Mavra's promise to them. Anything you desire.A nice phrase, that, but what did it mean? Was it like the ancient genie,granting wishes? That was always an easy one in fairy stories. They wished forwealth and romance and happily-ever-after endings. It wasn't that simple in reallife. It particularly wasn't simple for her. She'd had a series of shocks andpsychological changes that almost outdid her physical ones, and they'd evenmessed with her mind with her own consent.</p>
<p>What did Julian now, today, really desire? Not to go back, to become JulianBeard again. For all his glamour, she hated his stinking guts. Still, why hadthat earliest incarnation wanted to become an astronaut? Because of a need ofadventure, of challenge, the excitement of the new frontier. That much remainedof him, she thought. She didn't want a happily-ever-after ending; she wanted newchallenges, new chances to do something different, worthwhile. Erdom was hardly the place for that, permanently and happily stuck as it was ina kind of bizarre variation of the permanent twelfth-century Earth. And yet she'd come to like who she was and what she was and dreamed of thedesert lands that she'd hated when she'd been there.</p>
<p>It seemed as if there had always been something tearing at her since she'd beenhere. Male, female, master, slave, rebel, wife, loner, lover of the herd. The way they'd rearranged her head, she could never go back; the society wouldburn her at the stake as a witch. But if it could somehow be countered orremoved, she'd become that servile little wimp again, and that she didn't want,either. What if she could go back as an Erdomese man? It solved most of theconundrums, but the trouble was that she didn't want to be a man, not anymore.She'd been one once, and while he'd loved it fine, she didn't think very much ofhim now, and that was just what she would become. Look at what it had done toLori, whose own contrasting Earth background was the opposite of hers. Shedidn't exactly want that guy back, either, let alone want to become another one. There was a real catch in that three-wishes business that the fairy-tale writershadn't ever faced. In order to make decent use of them, one first had to knowwhat to wish for.</p>
<p>On the third day they passed near another small town and then another. Theroads, which they stayed off but which they watched carefully, seemed to growmore frequent, wider, and better maintained, not to mention more crowded. And on the third day they also saw that pigs could fly.</p>
<p>The last thing anybody would have expected to come across in even the mostsophisticated high-tech hex was an airport, but that was exactly what it was.There was even an unmistakable wind sock on a large reflective pole. Making campin some trees not far from it because the timing was right more than becausethey wanted to be this close in, they actually could watch it in operation. There were two types of fliers: the aircraft and the kites.</p>
<p>Watching a kiter take off was something of an amazing sight. Strapped underneatha massive width of a canvaslike material, the hoglike Verionite was then placedon a wheeled dolly. Then a team of the big, lumbering creatures that Julian haddubbed bigfoots were brought out, hitched as if they were pulling a cart. Whenthe omnipresent wind was right, someone gave a signal, and the four-bigfoot teamwould start lumbering down a cleared path, gaining speed until they were runningflat out. This plus the wind would catch the leading edge of the kite, and itwould rise into the air, the dolly dropping away, and up it would go, breakingfree of the ropes or whatever they were that the bigfoots used to pull. In fact, once aloft, the kite fliers seemed to have some sort of rudder controland perhaps ways of seeing the wind currents aloft, which must have been prettytricky from what Julian could see. She had been a pilot once, too, and had donesome hang gliding off Maui, so she knew that this would have been nearlyimpossible, no matter what the design of the kite, under Earth-type conditions. But this wasn't Earth, nor was it supposed to simulate the Earth. It wassimulating some other world somewhere else.</p>
<p>At any rate, once aloft, the pilot had lift, could get up farther, and couldclearly steer. The amazing thing was how the device kept climbing until he wasjust a speck in the distant sky. Watching the aerodynamics of the thing, though,Julian had to wonder if under these conditions a skilled and highly trainedpilot might not be able to stay up there for hours and possibly cover a fairdistance.</p>
<p>Even Mavra, who piloted spaceships and other craft far more sophisticated thananything Julian had ever more than dreamed of, was impressed. Even with thelevel of automation in her day, there were minimal atmospheric flying skillsthat had to be learned before one was allowed to pilot a massive spacecraft. There was another kind of flier as well. This was an oblong gondola supported bya matching hot air balloon suspended over the top of it. One Verionite was inthe gondola, controlling the flame, although it was unclear just what the sourceof that heat might be or how they managed to get a sufficient amount of it in acontrollable and obviously compressed form to allow for the level of controlledblasts he could give it.</p>
<p>And then there was the bigfoot pedaling the bicycle. It was an absurd sight, butits logic was pretty clear. Once the gondola lifted off-with the bigfoot,obviously trained to do this without panicking, sitting strapped in the seat atthe front-the man at the flame gave a command and the creature began pedaling.This in turn started a large propeller at the rear, sheltered in a frame with avertical rudder that the man at the flames appeared to be able to control usinga long pole.</p>
<p>Once aloft, with these winds, the balloon would have been at the mercy of thecurrents and would have picked up speed; the bigfoot, however, was able toovercome this, and its energy and the prop in the back provided a forwardmomentum that looked as if it might reach, oh, three or four kilometers per hourin the face of the wind. Altitude was controlled by the fire and the master gavethe craft direction by manipulating the rudder poles. The thing could actuallytravel. Julian suspected that the winds blew at different speeds and levels atlow altitudes and that, again, an expert pilot could find the right one forwherever he wanted to go, attaining maximum speed. At that rate, he could makethe equator in just a couple of long days or almost anywhere in this land infour. Not fast, no, but that thing could carry a limited cargo, such as mail,packages, and news, at a speed that a nontech civilization could hardly match onthe ground. Such a system would be vital for emergencies and would makecommunication practical. It bound the hex together, she guessed. It also meant that if there was a wanted poster out on them, as there almostcertainly was on Lori and Mavra, the odds were that there weren't many in Verionwho didn't know about them.</p>
<p>It also made travel by night a good decision, virtually essential, as they wereclearly moving toward a denser population center.</p>
<p>On day five they were on the outskirts of a major city, where the skies werefilled with flying pigs in variations of the two devices they'd seen at theairport but with such a variety of color and design that it was clear that theVerionites had a far different aesthetic sense than Julian.</p>
<p>More dramatic, off well beyond the city on the farthest horizon, was a soliddark line, easily seen through the more prairielike and less obstructed landthat the hex was becoming. It wasn't much, but it was too regular and tooconsistent to be either natural or an optical illusion. Still forty or fiftymiles from them, it was nonetheless visible. The equator!</p>
<p>The position of the sun told them that they had been heading more or less truenorthwest, which meant that as of now, they were less than a week away from theAvenue. Mavra had given up trying to explain or describe the Avenue to Julian inscratch writing. Apparently she would just have to go there and see it forherself. The only thing Julian got was that it was sunken, like a very broadculvert, flat on the bottom, smooth on all sides, and that it led to one of thedoors into the Well.</p>
<p>That meant no cover and low ground at a point when forces could be all alongboth sides shooting down at them. All kinds of technology would work there, butit wouldn't matter. When they were exposed on the floor of the thing, Julianknew that rocks could get them, never mind bullets. Nor, Mavra informed her,could one just enter the Well even if one made it to the doorway. "Automated. Opens only at old shift change," she told Julian. "Midnight." "Can anybody enter it at midnight?"</p>
<p>"No. Only authorized. You come in with me. I am authorized."</p>
<p>"How long does the door stay open?"</p>
<p>"About fifteen minutes unless I close it first."</p>
<p>Julian sighed. "So we have fifteen minutes to get down there, run a gauntlet,and somehow get inside without them killing or capturing us. It's impossible!" "See layout, defenders first. Then we'll see. I think I may have a way." "You want to give me an idea of how you're going to do it?"</p>
<p>"Wait. When I know it is possible, then I tell you."</p>
<p>Julian shook her head, wondering if any of this was worth what she'd gonethrough the past couple of weeks. If it was anything like it was described, itwas absolutely insane to even attempt to enter. Even if Mavra Chang were who andwhat she claimed, it made no difference. Until she was inside, she was just abig, heavy helpless bird who couldn't outrun a child. This whole business had tohave driven her insane; that was the only explanation for why she even couldthink that she might get in there.</p>
<p>Mavra understood Julian's attitude, but she could feel the Well, feel thecontact with its power and even some of its knowledge at this point. The Wellknew where she was, knew that she was close.</p>
<p>And the Well had gone to a great deal of trouble to get her here. With Nathanout of it in some southern hospital and Mavra this close, it wasn't going to lether get away now, of that she was certain.</p>

<p>The Avenue</p>
</title>
<empty-line/>
<p>CAMPOS AND THE COLONEL HAD TRIED EVERY MEANS THAT they could think of to findsome sign of the missing trio in Leba, even bringing in expert trackers fromother hexes that the colonel knew about, but to no avail.</p>
<p>The Lebans themselves had seemed singularly unimpressed by their problem and haddeclared themselves neutral and uninterested in the affairs of other creatures.Not even Campos or the colonel could think of anything to offer them that mighttempt them into cooperation.</p>
<p>There were times when some of the animals brought in seemed to pick up a scent,but it always led to a dead end, with the creatures going around in confusedcircles. At one point the colonel swore that if he didn't know better, he'dswear that someone was pulling a drag over the "foxes' " trail, confusing thescent and leading them away, but he couldn't imagine why anyone would do that orhow he could without betraying himself. He finally decided that the land wasjust not conducive to finding the fugitives' trail.</p>
<p>Score one for the prey, they both were forced to admit. On the other hand, theendgame was what counted.</p>
<p>The colonel had hoped, though, to avoid the endgame simply because he was nonetoo secure about showing up in his old role. Kurdon had certainly put out theword on his betrayal at the complex; it was unlikely that he'd have realauthority even if his friends in Zone were able to keep the law off him withsome cover story.</p>
<p>More than that, they would have to deal with armed soldiers whose loyalty was totheir own hex and then to the Zone Council and not to any third parties. Andthere was always the chance that in spite of threats with real teeth in them,their captives might be able to betray their real status as prisoners to thearmy personnel at the Avenue.</p>
<p>Campos, too, wasn't pleased with that prospect. "I think perhaps we should getrid of them now, before they can cause trouble later," she suggested. "Allexcept the girl, of course. If we cannot control the likes of her, no matterwhat her wishes, we do not deserve to be in this game in any case." The colonel, however, didn't like the idea of finishing them off. "We can't doit here," he explained. "The executions would be witnessed by Lebans no matterwhere we did it, and the Mixtim are under their protection as well. I don't knowwhat all those tentacles could do, but I do know that if we got out alive atall, a message would somehow be sent to Zone, and we would be as wanted as theones we chase. This isn't Clopta, after all. There are times when diplomacy anda light touch might yield better results than the heavy boot. Bring them along.If they cause trouble, we can dispose of them when we get to Verion. Butconsider this: The Dillians and the Dahir still have the official weight of theZone Council on their side. They can legitimize us with the army. So long as oneor more of their companions are within easy range of either of us, I think theywill go along."</p>
<p>Campos frowned. "You are not playing both sides again, are you, Colonel?" sheasked suspiciously.</p>
<p>"I took an oath and I meant it! This is not some sordid drug business here; itis for the highest of stakes! This will be very, very tricky no matter what wedo!"</p>
<p>Campos thought it over. "All right, Colonel, I will play it your way for now.Please just make certain that I do not see you changing sides once again." "I swear to you…!"</p>
<p>"Never mind. We have wasted far too much time here. Let us get the partytogether and head out for this Avenue, whatever it is. But remember, Colonel, ifthey betray us at the last moment, they have nothing on me at all of a criminalnature. What have we done? Fled a drug baron and defended ourselves against amonster and the baron and his henchmen? Gone where I have a right to go? Takenthese people where they wished to go, anyway? You see?"</p>
<p>"You are forgetting that the condition those two are in was your doing," thecolonel pointed out. He did not point out that the only witness to his treasonwas Gus, who could hardly afford public charges and testimony in Zone because itwould mean leaving Zone and exiting in Dahir, a place that very much wanted himback to ensure that he would not leave again.</p>
<p>"So? Even if they can prove that, which is not a certain thing, how could thepoor mistress of a gangster have such authority in the gang in so short a timehere on this world? It is hardly an international crime like the running ofdrugs. Even kidnapping is a local crime here, did you know that? Had I kidnappedor held prisoner a fellow Cloptan, that would be a different story, but these?No, I think not. And as I am certain that you. as usual, always have a way outof a tight situation, the fact is, the way this world is set up, neither of ushas committed crimes for which anyone is looking for us other than those wedirectly committed crimes against." She considered that and found it highlyamusing.</p>
<p>"Come, come! My friend and son of my patron!" the colonel said. "What are wedoing, passing blame back and forth to one another? I believe there were 160-oddnations back on the Earth we left, perhaps a few more. There are 780 sovereignand independent nations here, each with its own unique race and needs. Considerhow little could get done back on Earth and you have only a shadow of how littLecan truly get done of an international nature here. Without this unpleasantnesswith Brazil and Chang, they could not have even touched the cartel! What havesuch as we to fear from such as them?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you are right," Campos said after a moment. "Well, we will let them live,at least for now. As you say, what can they do?" She paused a moment. "Ofcourse, if those army people get our birdie, then we might just have to commitone of those crimes, you know."</p>
<p>'True," the colonel agreed, "but if that happens, we'll have Mavra Chang, sowhat difference does it make? If the king-or queen-is the state, can that personcommit a crime against themselves?"</p>
<p>It was a most amusing idea, and both of them laughed.</p>
<p>For the first time on the journey Terry felt really frightened. The images inthat Juana's mind about her were bizarre and nightmarish. She couldn't imaginewhat she might have done to deserve such complete and utter hatred, but JuanaCampos was scarier than anything she could imagine, even in her surfacethoughts. They were also so inconsistent as to be totally crazy. How couldCampos on the one hand imagine blinding and maiming Terry and treating her likean animal and at the same time look upon her with genuine concern? It took a couple of days before she realized that Campos's gentler nature, whatthere was of it, was directed not at her but at her coming baby. Gus was improving but still in no condition to do very much, and the traveldidn't help his healing at all. There were times when the pain was such that hewas very much afraid that he was going to die and other times when it was evenworse and he was afraid he wouldn't die. Still, Terry's presence kept him fromgiving up and provided the determination to heal no matter what. He had never expected to still be here this close to the birth and headed awayfrom the kind of medical help that she might well need. He knew of women whostill died in childbirth, particularly in Third World countries, and he'd seentoo much infant mortality for one lifetime already. He cursed himself for everagreeing to leave Agon with her as well as for being stupid enough to get shot. Now it was clear that Kurdon had wanted her handy as bait in case Campos had tobe lured out of some underground hiding place in Clopta. Well, Kurdon joined alengthening list of people, including Gen Taluud and himself, who hadunderestimated Campos. Trouble was, it was no skin off Kurdon's ass whathappened; Gus had paid with a painful, debilitating wound and capture, andTaluud had paid with his life. But it was Terry who might well pay the biggestprice unless somehow he could get well enough to save her.</p>
<p>The Dillians, too, felt less than noble about the help they'd been in all thisand were pretty well defeated and resigned. A few times one or possibly bothmight have escaped, but they could hardly have taken Gus and Terry with them,and they had no doubt that either Campos or the colonel would make them pay forany transgression by Tony or Anne Marie.</p>
<p>In point of fact, Tony for one was surprised to be alive at all. It didn't makea lot of sense not to have killed them, but since they hadn't, there was atleast the possibility of getting out of this with a whole skin. Whether the samecould be said for Terry, Mavra, or Lori remained to be seen, but as Anne Mariehad commented, "We started this as grown-ups. It would be maddening not to bethere at the finish."</p>
<p>On Taluud's sturdy horses and with well-provisioned pack mules, they made theVerion border in just three days.</p>
<p>"It would be tempting to run our trackers all the way down this border and seeif there is a scent now," Campos commented, "but whether or not they have gottenhere yet is something we cannot say. We wasted so much time back there trying tofind them that it is not worth it at this point. Let us push on to this Avenue;I want to see what the devil this setup is."</p>
<p>"Shall we cross over to Ellerbanta? They are high-tech over there, you know. Itwould be much easier to travel. We might well be able to ride up on somethingthat has real power and eat decent food again."</p>
<p>"It is tempting," the colonel agreed, "particularly considering what theseVerion hogs think of as high cuisine, but I think not. Our odds of makingheadway with any guards are far better on this nontech side than on the other,and they will have to come this way."</p>
<p>In another three days they reached the point where the Avenue intersected theequator. None of them had ever actually seen a Well World wall before; its scopeand sheer sense of permanence awed them all. It rose from the ground as ifplaced there by the hand of some enormous giant, rising up, up, as far as theeye could see. There was a top limit, of course, but it was impossibly high up,and beyond that there rose an energy barrier that still stopped any sort ofpassage across it.</p>
<p>The southern hemisphere of the Well World was dedicated almost entirely tocarbon-based life; the few exceptions were primarily silicon variants that stillrequired much of the same ranges of environment for life and sustenance. Thenorthern hemisphere, on the other hand, was entirely non-carbon-based and infact had so many varieties that they had their own separate lexicon up there.Most of the northern races, it was said, were so alien that they made littlesense to those in the south. Ammonia breathers gazed out on methane oceans, andsulfur oxide breathers found it chilly at a mere ninety degrees Celsius. Therewere whole regions up there where even crossing from one hex to the next wouldbe lethal to the native of the first, and not a single condition there wouldsupport any of the life in the south without an artificial environment. The only way back or forth was by a special gate in the two Zones, north andsouth. The equatorial barrier kept everybody else, and everything inside thehemispheres, from mixing.</p>
<p>If it wasn't for the Avenue, there would be no way to tell that this was anysort of unusual place along the otherwise totally smooth, impenetrable wall. TheAvenue simply went up to it and essentially merged with it, with no apparentsign of a seam. It was almost as if it continued on through, although there wasnothing to show that it did or didn't.</p>
<p>When they reached it, it was certainly impressive. The border ran right to theedge of the Avenue entrance, and there were cuts every few kilometers wheresloping ramps switchbacked down. Campos went a little down one ramp, through theborder, and found that the other border, for Ellerbanta, was along the oppositeside. The Avenue was a place all its own, broad, smooth, and finely machined,which showed the otherwise invisible artificial nature of this world. Campos took out one of the energy pistols she had, which hadn't been anythingmore than a weight since leaving Clopta, and fired it at an angle to theopposite wall, which was impressively far away. The shot hit and seemed to beabsorbed by the material. There was no ricochet, not even of the light from theenergy beam.</p>
<p>Impressed, Campos tried it on a section of wall right next to the ramp. The samething occurred, and she then gingerly touched the spot, which showed not even ascorch mark at a beam level that would have atomized the horse. It wasn't evenwarm to the touch.</p>
<p>There was no question that even by the standards of the Well World, the Avenuewas beyond any of the technologies here and stood like an artifact, perfectlypreserved, running straight as an arrow due north as far as the eye could see.Campos had had the same sort of feeling when seeing the great Incan cities andthose of the Aztecs and Mayas as well, somehow out of place in their junglelikesettings, suggesting another world, another time, and a civilization that couldbarely be imagined.</p>
<p>At night the Avenue glowed with an eerie light, this one a golden yellow,revealing a pattern in the Avenue floor and walls not so obvious in daylight. Bynight, by this internal glow, the "street" level seemed to be made up ofhexagonal blocks of absolutely uniform size.</p>
<p>"Gives you the creeps, does it not?" Campos said to the colonel, looking down inthe darkness.</p>
<p>"I find it astonishing. What incredible creatures they must have been! So farbeyond us that we could probably not even imagine their civilization and way oflife. This whole world nothing but a laboratory for them. It must have been likeMount Olympus or the angels around the throne of heaven."</p>
<p>"But still they died out, just as the Incas, but not by conquest," Campos noted."Maybe things were not so heavenly, after all, I think. They are dead. Gone. Allwe are doing is looking at their toys."</p>
<p>The colonel wasn't so sure. "Perhaps. But if they left at least one gatekeeper,as I believe they did, then they didn't think they were going to die out, andthey certainly didn't die out due to external or accidental forces. To reachthat height, they had to have destroyed themselves somehow. What was it thatthey did, I wonder, and why? They certainly didn't think of it as an end, elsewhy leave a gatekeeper? I wonder if we can even conceive of what they did. Idoubt if we could understand it even if one of them explained it to us. Whybuild a laboratory, set it up this way, and then leave? And where did they go?And why?"</p>
<p>"Such power they had," Campos breathed. "They would never have given it upwillingly. Still, we will never know, eh? Not unless your Captain Brazil wakesup and decides to talk about it."</p>
<p>"Oh, he has. Gus told me all about it. He claims he's nothing more than a manwho accepted a bargain with the previous keeper, who was so sick of immortalitythat he simply wanted to die. And that our captain finally had reached that samepoint himself and had chosen Mavra Chang as a candidate replacement. Apparentlyshe flunked the initiation."</p>
<p>Campos thought about it. "You know, if that is true, I almost wonder if we couldstill make some sort of deal with her. What does she owe him or the builders?Think of getting inside, in the control room of this whole thing. It must belike nothing we can imagine, yes?"</p>
<p>"Indeed. But I hardly think she'd be in any sort of mood to keep a deal struckwith you, not after what you did to her," the colonel pointed out. "Even if shekept her word, it would be, I think, like making a deal with the devil. Shemight make you a queen, all right, but a queen who looked like she does now andwith the same limitations. No, I don't think I'd like to trust her on that. Our original plan is far more practical. In that case, we know the sort of minds weare dealing with and the limits on their power and authority." "I think you are right," Campos agreed. "Still, I have to admit that if yourcaptain is telling the truth, then perhaps he did not pick so badly, after all.Consider how far she has come and under what circumstances she has managed to doit. I keep wondering if, considering all that, she will not somehow manage toslip inside."</p>
<p>"Not if we get there first," the colonel responded firmly. The soldiersstationed here were Verionites; there had been a larger and more mixed forceearlier, but it had been discontinued because of its expense, because of thecomplaints from other races about the tedium and lack of amenities to noapparent purpose, and because the Verionite government wasn't exactly thrilledwith the idea of any foreign troops on its soil for any length of time. They were almost laughable, these troops, except that they had a certainimposing look about them up close. Those pig snouts and big, ugly hog faces andtiny, nasty-looking eyes were atop large mouths from which lower canines oftenprotruded, giving them a very fierce look indeed. Their arms were thick,powerful, and muscular, and their hands had very long fingers that ended insharp black nails.</p>
<p>They were, Juana Campos decided, really wean-looking. They wore metal helmetsthat came to points and uniforms of a filigreed wool-like material that includedcrimson jackets, gold buttons, and black trousers with gold stripes. There wereperhaps fifty of them at any given time, under a single officer and two NCOs,and they were rotated frequently.</p>
<p>And they considered their orders to be a very big joke. "We're to stop anybodyfrom going in there" Major Hjazz, the current officer in charge, told thenewcomers. "As if they could!"</p>
<p>"There is nothing really there at the end of the Avenue, then?" the colonelasked him.</p>
<p>The major chuckled. "Well, yes. Every night at midnight you'll see it. It'llclick on, a kind of glow-the usual hexagon, you know. But you can go up to it,bang on it, butt your head against it, anything you want at all. It won't make adamn bit of difference. It's still just wall."</p>
<p>"Indeed. But tell me, when this light is on-can you see anything? Anythinginside?"</p>
<p>"You can see for yourself any midnight. There's tourists come up to see it allthe time, both from our own people and from Ellerbanta. Most of the nonlocalraces, they come in on tours through Ellerbanta, though, where they got thatstuff that makes you soft and lazy. When it's turned on, you can sort of seesomething in there, but you can never really make out what it is. They beentryin' since a lot longer than I been alive, I tell you! Hey, it's just a lighton one of them timers like they use in Ellerbanta. It turns on, stays on maybefifteen minutes, it turns off again. No big deal. Most folks don't come back.It's not much of a show."</p>
<p>"Well, with your permission, we'll camp near here for a little while. We weresupposed to meet some others here, and it is pretty clear they haven't shown upyet. They were coming in via your country and on foot, so it might well be a fewdays, even a week or so, until they get here. It's vital that we speak to them,so would we be in the way if we stayed around a bit?"</p>
<p>"Naw. Feel free. It's the off season, anyway. Still, if your friends arerecognizable, I could see if they've been spotted anywhere along the way and howfar they might be from here."</p>
<p>Hardly, I think, the colonel said to himself, but aloud he said, "'Indeed? Anyrunners or riders you might send might not cross their path, and we don't knowtheir route in any event. We might ask if things drag on, but it's not necessaryat the moment."</p>
<p>"Oh, we wouldn't send runners or riders," the major replied. "We send andreceive mail every day by air."</p>
<p>"By what?"</p>
<p>And thus it was that the party learned of the aerial accomplishments of theVerionites.</p>
<p>It was the source of endless fascination to the party to watch them take off andfly like that, and the bored soldiers were more than overjoyed to show off,explain things, and particularly emphasize the problems and dangers of doing itso near the barrier and the border, where wind and such could cause seriousproblems or even disasters. "We've scraped up more than one from the bottom ofthe Avenue," one private told them. "Messy."</p>
<p>"I'd think you'd just sail right over to Ellerbanta," Tony commented. "Oh, sure, that's what you try to do, but it's not that easy 'cause you don'thave a lot of height from this point. That area right in there between theborders ain't all that wide when you're flying, it's true, but it's dead air.You start to sink like a stone, and you don't have much tolerance between thosewalls for landing. You hit one, or the barrier, and it's all over." Tony and Anne Marie had been given a good deal of freedom, and they made someuse of it. Even Campos seemed to have tired of them as prisoners; she and thecolonel more than once tried to talk them, rather nicely and almost as equals,into simply heading over to Ellerbanta. taking a train to the capital, and usingthe Zone Gate there to go home. There was nothing more here they could do andvery little that they could do to Campos or the colonel, in spite of all. "And Terry and Gus?" Anne Marie asked them. "Gus knows that as soon as he'srecovered enough, he's out of here," Campos told her. "As for Terry, she remainshere with me. We are old acquaintances, she and I, and I feel sorry for her." "She of all people should be sent home now!" Tony argued. "She's going to havethat baby any day now!"</p>
<p>"She is a strong, healthy girl. She will do all right," Campos told them both."Back home in Peru I have been at many home births. It is the way of my peoplein the backcountry. More than once I assisted doctors of Shining Path with suchthings. What few things are needed I have had brought here thanks to theingenuity of our host countrymen."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm not about to leave until she's through it!" Anne Marie told heradamantly. Campos shrugged. "Suit yourself." Terry had ridden with them andwatched all this in growing confusion and uncertainty. At least Gus seemedbetter, although still in great pain, and it almost seemed as if the twocentaurs were completely out of danger. She knew she was still in danger, butshe could do little about it. Running away wouldn't do anything but maybe makethem hurt Gus. Besides, she couldn't run or even ride right, not anymore. She had trouble sleeping; every time she changed position, it woke her up. Shecouldn't walk far or easily; it was more like a waddle, and it was very tiringwith this big, hard, increasingly heavy lump in her belly. Her nipples hurt, herbreasts seemed swollen, and she had to pee every ten minutes. It didn't takeanybody smart to see that she wasn't going anywhere.</p>
<p>She, too, was getting pains and the weirdest feelings down there, where theysaid the baby would come out. She couldn't imagine a baby coming out of thatlittle place, but if they said it did, then maybe somehow it did. After a day or two the pains got worse and more frequent, and those strangefeelings got even stronger. It was a kind of pain like no other she couldremember, and she got very worried about it. Anne Marie tried to reassure her,telling her that it was all normal and that all women who had babies wentthrough this. But Anne Marie had never had a baby. She'd been too sick. Even shecouldn't know how awful an experience this was turning into and how it seemed tokeep dragging on and on.</p>
<p>Early one morning, when she was walking from the pit toilet back to the tent forthe umpteenth time, she felt something different, and all of a sudden all sortsof smelly, gushy, yucky watery stuff was flowing out and down her legs. She knewthat she hadn't peed again and that it hadn't come out of there, and it confusedand frightened her enough that she went to Gus, who was just lying there asusual, and pointed.</p>
<p>Gus hadn't much experience in this himself, but he knew something had happened,and he called for Anne Marie and Tony.</p>
<p>"Why, I believe her water's broken!" Anne Marie said happily. She turned andlooked straight into the concerned Terry's eyes. "That means the baby will comevery soon now. Not much longer. Hold on. girl! Hold on!"</p>
<p>That was going to be really hard, because the pains were coming back now fullforce, a lot stronger and a lot more often.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't she be lyin' down?" a concerned Gus asked Anne Marie. "If she wants to," the centauress replied. "Otherwise, let her stand or sit orwhatever. In one sense she's better off than in some hospitals where thosestupid male doctors don't let women stand up or sit and treat this like it'ssome kind of illness. It's not an illness, it's the miracle of birth, quitenatural, and about as amazing as anything that has happened to us." Over the next few hours the pains got even worse, and they just kept coming andcoming. She was getting to the point where she no longer cared about anything,not even the baby. She just wanted it over with.</p>
<p>"Get Campos in here," Anne Marie instructed.</p>
<p>Tony looked at her oddly. "Campos?"</p>
<p>"He claimed he could deliver a baby and had before. I haven't. You certainlyhaven't. And I don't want that nasty colonel within a mile of this." "But-the way Campos thinks of her! She could kill the child!"</p>
<p>"She won't. I've talked to her. She thinks the child is hers. Don't argue! Gethim! Now!"</p>
<p>It was the most miserable, painful time of Terry's brief memory, worse thananything, worse than dying. The pain, the exhaustion, the people yelling ather-she began to hate them all. And it went on. and on, and on… "Push! Now push!" someone was telling her, and she felt as if she didn't haveenough energy to do anything else at all, but she pushed…</p>
<p>And then the girl who never said a word, never uttered much in the way of soundsat all, screamed. Screamed with a length and depth that were almost unbelievableand sent panicky nearby Verionite soldiers running for their weapons. It felt as if she had passed a stone the size of a watermelon, but now,suddenly, it was over. Somewhere off in the distance she heard the incongruoussound of a baby crying, but then she simply passed out.</p>
<p>"Santa Maria! It's a boy! A big one, too!" Campos shouted with unrestrainedglee. She carefully clipped the umbilical cord with a small clamp she'd gottenfrom the Verionites, then washed off and wrapped the baby, a rough and tumbletype who clearly didn't want to be out in this weird, cold new environment atall. Anne Marie took care of the placenta and otherwise cleaned up the mess. "Poor dear! She's passed out, totally exhausted."</p>
<p>"Shouldn't wonder," Campos commented. "Twelve hours. All But here is the result,and not a blond hair or blue eye to be seen. These are Latin features on thechild! You see? No Mister Gus with his lily-white north in him!” She laughed."Even here, in this place and in this muddled mess, a new Campos is born!" "Well, don't kill him by taking him all over and showing him off!" Anne Mariescolded. "Give him to me. He should be here when she comes to, and she will haveto nurse him, considering the conditions here. You can go brag all you want.I'll take care of things at this end."</p>
<p>Actually it was Tony, who had remained nearby through it all, who had the worstreaction. She wasn't at all sure now that she wanted to have children, not onebit.</p>
<p>Gus was not one to be put off by the fact that it wasn't his child. In fact, ithad never once occurred to him that it might be. He'd almost injured himself allover again when he'd heard that scream, but when he heard the baby's cry, he'dsat back down again.</p>
<p>He wasn't at all sure if it was or wasn't Campos's kid, either, but he was gladthat Campos thought so. It would keep Terry safe for quite a while longer. The fact that mother and baby were doing fine was enough for him.</p>
<p>It took another three days for Mavra, Lori, and Julian to reach the camp at theend of the Avenue, but they'd managed an epic cross-country trek without, theyfelt, once being detected, and that was something of a victory in and of itself. By that time Julian had a very good idea of what Mavra had in mind, and shewasn't at all sure that it was any crazier than simply rushing the place. In the wee hours of the morning Julian crept in and examined the soldiers'little airport. It was dead quiet, the bigfoots asleep out in the field andeverything quite still. There wasn't even a guard on the place, because whatpurpose would that serve here?</p>
<p>There were several of the kites in a storage shed, and all of them looked likethey'd seen a lot of work. Still, they looked about as reasonable as one couldexpect, and the belts and such would probably hold Mavra if, of course, shecould steer it by head movements.</p>
<p>She brought Mavra in to examine them, and the bird woman looked at them long andhard. Finally she nodded.</p>
<p>They would not do it tonight, but they would certainly do it quickly. It wasmuch too dangerous around here to stay long.</p>
<p>The other question was how to launch and how to get Lori and Julian in with her.In that regard, there was nothing much she could do except use them to get heraloft, and then, if she managed to gain altitude in the darkness and make theproper turn, they would just have to rush full speed through the camp and downthe ramp as soon as Mavra vanished inside the Avenue walls. If Mavra wasthrough, they'd get through. If she wasn't, what difference would it make? The next morning they tried as best they could with the writing system they'ddeveloped to make whatever plans they could.</p>
<p>"You are sure you can fly it?" Julian wrote.</p>
<p>"I am sure I can. I understand the principle. If I can maneuver the front strutswith my head and beak, I can do it."</p>
<p>"This is crazy," Julian told her. "We could do as well by just rushing them withyou on Lori. They are sloppy, not on guard."</p>
<p>"No," Mavra scratched. 'Too risky. Bad guys will try anything to stop me, evenkilling you. If I am not with you, they won't. They will be trying for me." "When do you want to do it? We do not even have a watch. How do we know when itis time?"</p>
<p>"Guard changes," Mavra told her. "Last night they had two after dark. Second wasat time the door opened. We go on second guard change."</p>
<p>"The odds are very poor."</p>
<p>"The Well will not let me fail. Watch out for yourselves, not me." She was so confident that this insane, harebrained scheme would work that Julianalmost believed it.</p>
<p>Even so, it was hard as hell to get to sleep just thinking about it. All thisway, all this accomplishment, and for what? How much training and experience didit take for those Verionites to fly those flimsy things? What did they know orwhat might they see in the wind currents that was unknown to Mavra? Could sheand Lori even provide enough speed to get lift at all?</p>
<p>And most important, what was she most afraid of? That she'd fail? That Mavrawould fail? Or that Mavra would succeed?</p>
<p>What then?</p>
<p>Would the wonderful wizard have a heart, a brain, and courage to give away? Orwould it just be a small woman behind the curtain pulling levers? At least Dorothy had had an idea of what she wanted, as had her companions. Andshe'd never had to fly an unfamiliar aircraft just to get there. She'd evenmissed the balloon, hadn't she? And all she'd had to do was click her heelstogether three times…</p>
<p>This was gonna be a hell of a lot more complicated, and who knew what all theassembled wicked witches would have ready to stop them?</p>
<p>They'd seen the centaurs, of course, Campos and her bunch, and the colonel, aswell as the brutal-looking if rather sloppy soldiers. At least nobody seemed towant to camp out down there at the bottom of the Avenue. It was just too lonely,too spooky, and too bereft of water and other necessities.</p>
<p>There had been no sign of Terry or Gus; they could only hope that nothing badhad happened to either of them.</p>
<p>Maybe that was enough reason for this crazy business, Julian thought. It's toocrazy to work, and it's too risky as well, but if it does…</p>
<p>At least they might be able to get even.</p>
<p>For all the agony, Terry had delivered quite cleanly. Campos had been ready witha borrowed and boiled scalpel, but it hadn't been needed. When the baby haddecided to come, it had come, with Terry sitting mostly in an oversizedVerionese chair, gravity doing much of the final work. There was also no realsign of tearing, although there almost had to be some inside.</p>
<p>The girl, they decided, was a hell of a quick healer.</p>
<p>She awoke about an hour after the birth, feeling as if she'd just deliveredboulders. Then she was handed the baby and the baby was placed gently to abreast, started to suck, and really gorged himself.</p>
<p>By the next afternoon she'd slept off a lot of it and was feeling remarkablybetter and a lot thinner and lighter to boot. She kept the baby with her atalmost all times, except when Campos wanted to see it or show it off, and,wrapped in a soft blanket, the baby seemed quite content.</p>
<p>The second day, as she grew more ambitious, walking with the baby along thebarrier, always accompanied by someone, she seemed to grow more and moreinterested in the Avenue. That evening, after dinner and feeding the baby, shewent out accompanied by no less than Campos and Tony, the latter just becauseshe didn't trust anybody around the girl. Terry surprised both the guardians bygoing through the barrier and partway down the ramp, holding the baby gently. Campos stared at her, wondering. "Sometimes I think she can see inside there,see what we cannot," he remarked as much to himself as to Tony. "I wonder whatdraws her to it. Does she see or hear something, perhaps?"</p>
<p>"Hard to say," Tony responded, but she, too, had noticed it. The girl hadn'tshown the slightest interest in the wall or the Avenue in all the time they'dbeen there, but now, after the baby had been bom, it was, next to the child, theonly thing that really fascinated her.</p>
<p>Later on Campos discussed this with the colonel. "You would almost swear thatshe saw inside," she told the Leeming. "That she thought that she could justwalk right through."</p>
<p>"She is such a strange one," the colonel responded.</p>
<p>Campos was not ready to let it go at that. She'd watched her face staring intothat blank wall too often now.</p>
<p>"I wonder what would happen if we did take her there when the door opens," shemused. "What if that 'rewiring' or whatever they did to her back in thatso-called human hex tuned her to the signals in there? What if it is some sortof mental signal, some frequency that is denied those of us created by itsmachinery?"</p>
<p>"You are actually suggesting that she might be able to walk through?" Thecolonel thought about it. "I find that highly dubious, but even if she could,what good would that do us? She is such a simple sort now. She wouldn't knowwhat to do once she was in there, I shouldn't think. I often wonder if we wouldor if even the controls would be so alien or so beyond our ability tounderstand."</p>
<p>"I grow very tired and very bored here," Campos told him. "I began to think thatour quarry is never going to appear or certainly that they are not going toappear here. Perhaps they have more patience than we thought. Or perhaps theyweren't as good as we thought they were. There have been no signs, no signals,no reports. It is as if this world swallowed them up."</p>
<p>"I share your frustration, but what can we do? If we give up now, it has allbeen for nothing."</p>
<p>"Perhaps. Perhaps I am just playing mental games with myself to keep from goinginsane with boredom. I just wonder, though, what would it hurt to take her downthere when the door opens up tonight? If she walks in, she walks in with us.With all of us, perhaps. As you say, it is probably incomprehensible to us, butwhat of that? If she could just walk through, and we with her, in front of theamazed stares of the guards! Think of that! We would not need Mavra Chang at allto work our will! Inside, then out. We two and the girl. That alone would beenough to cause terror in the highest places, yes? And only we would know thatwe did not do a thing!"</p>
<p>"It is foolishness. You are simply letting a poor unfortunate girl throw you." "Still, think of it. If she could, and we did, I would be right, would I not?" "Well, yes, but…"</p>
<p>"But what? She is almost certainly not going to be able to do it. I admit that.But where is the harm in trying it? Just once?"</p>
<p>"And who would be down there with her?"</p>
<p>"Just us. She, we two, and the baby, of course, which she, as a good mother,keeps with her. If we can get in, I would like that baby to go in as well. Thinkof the possibilities. Think of what powers we could claim for that child! Why,there would be cults built around the child! More power to those who control thegrowing child than from any drugs, because there is no product to move exceptbelief. Campos the god-child! And Madame Campos, the only creature known in thehistory of the universe to be both a father and fully female! And you, the highpriest of it all. Makes you think, does it not?"</p>
<p>"Well, I will only say that if you want to be humored, I will go along. But donot be too crushed if nothing at all happens at midnight. I still believe MavraChang will eventually show up here and that she, not this foolishness, is thekey to it all."</p>
<p>"Worth a try, though, no?"</p>
<p>"Whatever you say. On the other hand, on the off chance that this impossibleidea actually works, have you considered that we might not be able to get backout of there?"</p>
<p>"You do not need to come."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I did not say anything about that. I will be there with you, I assureyou. If there is the chance of anything happening, even a change in the textureof the wall or the transparency of its opening, I should like to be there to seeit."</p>
<p>Tony watched the evil pair talking and went over to Anne Marie. "I don't likeit. Those two are up to something, and whenever they are up to something, it isalways bad for everyone else."</p>
<p>Anne Marie looked over at the two, perhaps ten meters away, and nodded. "Iagree. And anything they might be up to might well not be good for Terry andthat sweet little baby, either. I think we'll keep a good watch on her tonight." The Well had sent meteors to summon them and bring them through; it had slowly,subtly manipulated probabilities to ensure mat at least one Watcher would cometo it. It had used all its tricks, major and minor, to accomplish the simplegoal that its ancient, automated instructions required of it, and because it wasa machine, it had used a circuitous route that would be inexplicable to thelinear thinkers who had been the targets of its convoluted, bizarre program. Nowall the sequences were run; now all the mechanisms were in place. Even NathanBrazil, who knew it best of those alive, had tried to fight it in the past andfailed, but while patient, the Well would never be denied. Now all the means andmethods were in place, the players assembled, each well suited to do what wasrequired to accomplish the Well's own ends, although they themselves wereunaware of it. And only Mavra Chang had confidence in it even though she couldnot feel its hand.</p>
<p>It was time.</p>
<p>The wind was up, blowing directly in their faces across the flattened field.Mavra Chang had examined and even played with the large kite under which she wasnow strapped but had refused a test flight. Much too risky, too much chance of acrash, and no chance then to make another attempt. One shot for everything.Fifteen minutes of window, fifteen minutes to win the game, set, and match inspite of all the forces arrayed against her. The only thing she was certain of,though whether the knowledge came from her own ancient experience or had beenfed to her by the Well, was that a hang glider was guided not with hands andfeet but with subtle shifts of the pilot's weight. She was lighter than any ofthe natives of the hex, but she was sure she weighed enough to maneuver thecraft, perhaps higher and faster than even the creatures for which it had beendesigned. It was more than a hope; it was a necessity that it was true. Julian watched, only half-concealed in the brush, and frowned as she saw Terrycome out, carrying something indistinct in her arms, flanked by both the coloneland Juana Campos. The latter was even smoking one of Taluud's cigars, the puffsof smoke rising and dissipating in the wind. She was happy to see Terry; itallayed one of her worst fears. Still, what were those villains doing with her?And- wharf They were walking through the border, down the ramp to the Avenue!What the hell?</p>
<p>She checked the guards who stood overlooking the vast alien entryway below,bathed in the night glow of the Avenue's strange luminescence, and saw themgetting nervous but not yet moving.</p>
<p>Now the Dillians were moving toward the Avenue rampway! One of them halted, thenthe other, and they conferred for a moment. Then one trotted over to a largetent nearby and entered, the other waiting at the start of the ramp, dividingher attention between the tent and what was going on below.</p>
<p>The one in the tent emerged with something large and strange-looking on herback. Could that be Gus? Why take him down there? And why was he so visible? Something was definitely wrong. There were four Cloptans as well, two males andtwo females, and they began heatedly conferring with each other, then theychecked their guns, and they, too, were heading down!</p>
<p>My God! Julian thought. Who's next? The whole damned Verionese army? Her eyes went back to the guards, who were visibly nervous at the sight of somany people going down into the Avenue. One of them shouted something, but ifthere was a reply, Julian couldn't hear it.</p>
<p>Over to one side there was activity in the Verionese army camp. She thought of calling the whole thing off for the night, but Mavra was alreadystrapped in, Lori was hitched up, and it was all ready to go. Mavra would neverunderstand or forgive her if she didn't launch now, but maybe this was all justas well. If Mavra saw the assemblage down there, she might abort the thingherself. At least, Julian hoped so. This was getting ridiculous, and there wasno way to warn anybody!</p>
<p>She frantically considered trying to write something that Mavra could read, butnow the activity from the army camp revealed itself as the changing of theguard; two privates and an officer or sergeant were marching over to relieve thetwo agitated guards.</p>
<p>She had no choice and no time! There was absolutely nothing she could do aboutthis!</p>
<p>Oh, my God! Here we go!</p>

<p>Midnight at the Well of Souls</p>
</title>
<empty-line/>
<p>Julian raced for the field, saw where Lori was set up, and barely checked to seeif Mavra was okay. It didn't matter anymore. Either it went right or it wasover.</p>
<p>She pulled up next to Lori, fumbling with the stupid makeshift pull strap. Shefinally got it, took a deep breath, and tried to get hold of herself, thenclamped it around her neck and shoulders. She turned, lined up with Lori on allfours, then said, "NOW!"</p>
<p>Lori might not have understood the word, but the intent and emotion were clear.He kicked into action, and the two of them suddenly felt the straps tighten andthen something dragging along behind them. There was no chance, no way, to lookand see if it was working; they just had to keep running at full gallop and hopefor the best.</p>
<p>Mavra wasn't as prepared for the yank and the move forward as she had thought,and the pull tab that would release the straps fell from her beak. She strainedforward, tied into a kite never built for somebody like her, trying to get thelast little fingernail-width distance to grab the ring again while rollingforward on her stomach, bouncing on the makeshift carriage.</p>
<p>She felt the kite's leading edge bite into the wind, start to lift, and thencome down again. Then it caught once more, and she felt herself rising free ofthe carriage and of pressure below. With a last desperate attempt that felt likeshe was tearing her neck from her shoulders, she got the ring, pulled it, andthen, with her head, forced the kite up, up as the straps dropped away. It was a lot trickier, bouncier, and rougher then Mavra had thought it would be.No time to look down, no time for bearings; she had to keep it into the wind andwith sheer head and neck motion force it up, up. like climbing stairs in theair. Once or twice she almost lost it and had to use the controls rigged to herfeet to roll and stabilize while losing altitude, and it took every single ounceof strength and will to fight the thing and get another updraft and climb,climb, climb all over again…</p>
<p>Suddenly she was well over the whole field and banked south, trying to gain moreand more altitude so that she could get some feel for the craft and sight herobjective. The nearly absolute blackness had been the equatorial wall; now shewas up, maybe several hundred meters, and angled so that she could see much ofthe landscape beyond.</p>
<p>For a moment the view, the tiny lights, torches, lamps, and glow on the horizonof the capital were hypnotizing. She had forgotten what it was like after allthis time…</p>
<p>From somewhere, something was giving her more and more the feel of the thingwith each moment aloft, how it steered, how it angled, climbed, and dove, andshe didn't fight it. The glider was controlled with very subtle shifts of bodyweight, and the greatest problem was resisting the urge to overcompensate. Asher skill at maneuvering increased so did her confidence. This wingless,flightless bird was soaring now!</p>
<p>She banked back across the field and turned toward the camp and the Avenue.Below her, she could see Julian and Lori going much too slowly, trotting towardthe camp. Hurry up! Hurry up, you idiots!</p>
<p>It would be tricky, but she decided to make a single trial pass and see what shewas dealing with inside the Avenue if she could. The border kept vision a bitdimmer and less clear than she would have liked, but she thought she could seepeople down there. That was bad, but she couldn't afford to risk a second pass.There was some commotion in the Verion army camp, and a lot of soldiers seemedto be rushing to the edge of the abyss, even though some of them werehalf-dressed.</p>
<p>She couldn't worry about any of this. Something inside her, or perhaps beyondher, from beyond that equatorial wall was saying, "Now, now! You must come to menow!" She took a wide swath around the camp, the airfield, and beyond, proceededa bit south again, and steeled herself to make the attempt at the door. It wouldbe dead reckoning, and she would have to guess the distance and descent rightthe first time. The only sure and reasonable way in was to cross the border,straighten up, and fly directly at the door, hoping she sustained enough lift toreach it and did not crash against the wall or drop like a stone. Below her, Julian had taken her time to get her breath and to disconnect Loriand herself from the other end of those straps. Then she'd started off towardthe Avenue, but slowly, at not even a brisk trot. Lori matched her but wonderedwhat was wrong. The messages he'd read said (hat they had to move quickly atthis point and that time was of the essence once Mavra was away. What washolding Julian back? Why was she almost slowing to a dead stop? Suddenly he sensed that she was afraid. After all this, she was afraid to takethe last gamble herself!</p>
<p>Lori had neither much hope nor ambition for all this, but he damned well wasn'tnot going to see it through. He dropped back, reached over, and nipped her onthe ass right near her tail. She started and involuntarily speeded up, and nowhe raced forward, taking the lead, charging as fast as he could go right intothe middle of the Verion army camp. For some reason Julian found herself unableto take her eyes off him. She just ran after him, and ran, and ran, right intothat camp herself.</p>
<p>The major, the sergeant, and several troopers were all arguing and granting overjurisdiction and procedure and what the hell they were supposed to do. Nobodyhad ever really gone down there without permission before, and nobody wanted totake the responsibility for doing anything at all. Everybody kept making excusesand passing the buck, with the result that nothing was decided at all. Suddenly somebody yelled, "Watch it! Animals coming!"</p>
<p>And the brave helmeted troops of Verion scrambled to get out of the way as firsta pony and then another- pony"?-ran right through them and to the Avenue ramp. Lori found it hard to put the brakes on, but there were four turns and noguardrails in the ramp going down. He only hoped that Julian was behind him andthat she wouldn't push him over.</p>
<p>She did almost fall over the first turn and down into the hard culvert below,but while one leg slipped off the edge, she managed somehow to keep a grip withthe other three and scramble back up. She wasn't thinking at all; she had thisirresistible impulse to follow the horse ahead of her, and she was going to doit come hell or high water.</p>
<p>Ellerbantan monitors on the other side were far more comfortable but no lessbored than the Verionites opposite. Two of them sat watching control screensmore or less, dreaming about anything but being there, when one of them suddenlyjerked up and punched the other with a tentacle.</p>
<p>"Look at that! It's a whole mob going down there from Verion for the midnightshow!"</p>
<p>The other one devoted all three eyes to the scene, then relaxed. "Don't worryabout it. See how many races are there? It's just one of those damned tourgroups."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I suppose you're right," the other agreed. "Still, it's funny they didn'tfollow the usual routine and come over and warn us."</p>
<p>"Aw, you know those Verionites. Walk all the way down, across, and back up herejust for that?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," the other sighed in disgust. "If there was something wrong, they'd behere in a flash, shoot off one of those flares or something. Heck, if those wereanything more than tourists, they could take 'em out with arrows." "My point exactly. So relax," said the first one, and went back to itsdaydreaming.</p>
<p>On the Avenue floor the colonel and Tony flanked Terry and the baby and watchedwith curious apprehension as the great yellowish hex switched on just in frontof them.</p>
<p>Terry seemed to think it was funny. She gave a kind of delighted giggle and wentright up to it, cradling the sleeping baby as she did so. She approached soclosely that she could see her reflection in it, as well as the ghostlyreflections of the pair behind her.</p>
<p>"She's going to do it! She's actually going to do it!" Campos breathed. "I think she may try," the colonel agreed. At that very moment Mavra Chang,hoping that ancient instincts and the Well's own aid hadn't failed her, crossedover into the Avenue's space and tried to center herself as she felt the liftgive out. She was going forward still and reasonably straight, but there was noway in hell she could climb or in any way pull out of a shallow but definiteforward dive.</p>
<p>Ahead, she saw it. The door to the Well! Open! Waiting for her! If she couldonly stay airborne long enough to make it!</p>
<p>It was going to be very close, and ahead now she could see figures standingthere. A Cloptan? Could that be Campos? But who, or what, were the others? Jeez,that almost looked like a human woman just at the door itself. She hoped shewouldn't crash behind them; that would be the worst result of all, to fail sovery close to the goal. But if she didn't, she risked knocking down the woman. Well, the hell with it! Precious little she could do about it now! What the hell? Suddenly the two Dillians were there, and one of them had a biglizard on her back. Get out of my way! Get out of my way!</p>
<p>She gave a horrendous, panicked screech that echoed through the whole of theAvenue. All of the ones inside heard it and turned, as much in curiosity as infear. Eyes widened as they saw the huge kite coming, and only Campos had thepresence of mind to realize what it must be.</p>
<p>"It's Chang! Shoot her! Shoot her down!"</p>
<p>Mavra Chang came over the Dillian's head, so close that Anne Marie's hair wasblown by her passing. The four Cloptans who'd just reached the floor themselvesdrew their weapons when they heard Campos cry, but the thing was too low. Notonly did the Dillians block any decent shot or view, if they shot through them,it would be too late.</p>
<p>The colonel sent out a pseudopod that actually touched the kite, wrenching it abit, but even though he had hold of it, he was too close to the door and thething still had too much momentum for such an unthinking chance grab. The girl, having seen what was coming, moved to one side and crouched low sothat first the kite went through the door with Mavra Chang still tied under it,perhaps a meter off the Avenue floor, then the colonel was dragged in, too,still clutching it.</p>
<p>Campos had hit the floor when she'd seen that the kite couldn't be slowed. Asshe got up, she watched in amazement as the girl looked at the baby, smiled, andthen stepped into the hex opening and vanished.</p>
<p>"No!" Campos cried, and lunged forward, and was herself swallowed up. Tony and Anne Marie looked at each other quizzically.</p>
<p>"I don't care if you have to throw me, get me the hell in there!" Gus growled atthem.</p>
<p>Anne Marie shrugged, and Tony shrugged, and the two galloped right at theopening and went through.</p>
<p>The four Cloptans were totally confused by all this, and finally it was Kuzi whoscreamed, "I don't give a damn 'bout nothin' no more! I say we follow the boss!" The others nodded, guns still drawn, but as they ran for the door, they werealmost knocked down by two horses, or something very like them, running at fullgallop toward the Well access. First Lori, then Julian ran right into the thingand disappeared amid some wild but inaccurate firing by the Cloptan guns. Finally Kuzi started for the door, and the others followed, all angry, confused,but determined to go through and find out what the hell was on the other sideand why everybody else had disappeared and to where. Kuzi marched right up tothe still-outlined door and right into a solid wall that knocked her down andsent the others sprawling in back of her.</p>
<p>The door remained visible for about another minute and a half, and the Cloptanstried just about everything from firing energy weapons and conventional pistolsat it to pounding on it, but it did no good. Then it winked out, and they wereleft alone in the suddenly silent and very deserted Avenue.</p>
<p>"It ain't fair!" Audlay cried. "Everybody got to go but us!"</p>

<p>The Well at Entrance Hall</p>
</title>
<empty-line/>
<p>THE COLONEL WAS TOTALLY DISORIENTED, AND IT TOOK HIM A few moments to disengagefrom the kite which lay, crashed, nearby and reform himself into a practicalshape.</p>
<p>He was most conscious of the silence, sudden and absolute, but he was tooexperienced to dwell on it at the moment. Instead, he went over to the kite, putout two strong armlike pseudopods, and turned it over.</p>
<p>Its struts were splintered, and it was virtually broken into two pieces:whatever had ridden in on it must have taken a terrible jolt.</p>
<p>But there was nothing in the harness. It looked in fact as if the straps hadbeen burst, as if by something suddenly enlarging to a point where the strapscould no longer contain it.</p>
<p>If so, where was it?</p>
<p>He looked around and saw the door behind him, as transparent as glass. He sawthe girl check the baby, smile, and walk through into the chamber where he nowwas, the invisible surface parting as if it were a thin curtain of water. The girl stopped, then looked around in wonder at the whole of the enormouschamber. Then the baby moved and made a sound, and all her attention came backto it.</p>
<p>Now Campos, looking very comical, picked herself up and almost stormed through.She spotted the colonel immediately, paying little mind to the girl. "So? Where is she?" Campos asked, eyeing the broken kite. Her voice echoed inthe vastness of the hall.</p>
<p>"She's not here," the colonel responded, gesturing toward the underside. "Ican't explain it. It couldn't have been more than a matter of seconds, a halfminute at most, until I was able to regain my composure and check it. I stillhad hold of it!"</p>
<p>Campos reached into a pocket, took out another in the dwindling supplies ofTaluud's cigars, and lit it. "I don't like this. I say we go with the originalplan and all get the hell out of here before it closes on us!" The colonel looked around at the eerie, empty hallway with its incredibly high,nearly endless ceiling and vast expanse, and said, "I tend to agree. I-" Suddenly, the Dillians burst through the door, Tony with Gus on her back. "Who the hell said you all could come?" Campos snapped at them. "And why bringhim?" It was clear she meant Gus.</p>
<p>"Because he asked us to," Anne Marie answered matter-of-factly. She lookedaround the great hall, as did Tony, and both gasped at the scale. It made all ofthem seem like a speck of dirt on a nice, clean floor.</p>
<p>"Well, everybody can turn around and get out right now!" Campos thundered. "Allof us!"</p>
<p>"Lost your nerve? So soon?" Gus taunted, then frowned. "Hey! I don't hurt nomore! in fact-"</p>
<p>He rolled off Tony's back and onto the smooth floor, then looked down at hisside. Almost on impulse, he tore off the bandages. Underneath there was nothingbut smooth, undisturbed skin. Not even a scar was visible.</p>
<p>"Well, I'll be damned! I'm beginnin' to like this place!" he said wonderingly. Campos was growing increasingly nervous. "Well, I, for one, do not! We go! Now!"She looked at the other Cloptans coming toward the door. "If we don't, it'sgoing to be an even bigger mess! About the only ones missing are-" At that moment Lori and Julian came into view behind the Cloptans; they couldsee but not hear the Cloptan group scatter as they passed and saw the Cloptansfiring wildly, but then first Lori and then Julian were inside the hall, theirhooves abruptly clattering against the smooth floor.</p>
<p>"I had to open my big mouth," Campos said grumpily. "All right! Out!" "Who's gonna make us?" Gus asked him. "You?"</p>
<p>"Colonel, I am suddenly very weary of that one. He has been a burden for toolong," Campos said to the Leeming. "Will you please see to him?" The colonel moved close to Gus, who had no armor and no defense and was stillall too visible to everyone there. The Leeming hesitated just a moment, and Gusasked him, some obvious nervousness in his voice, "Well, Colonel, you and Igonna finally finish it here, huh?"</p>
<p>"Gus, I don't really want to kill you," Lunderman said with apparent sincerity."Just take the girl by the hand and let us leave."</p>
<p>"No, Colonel. I don't think so. For some reason, I got this funny feelin' thatthe rules are different here." He didn't sound very confident, but he wasn'tgoing to move, that was clear.</p>
<p>"Finish him, Colonel, and get out!" Campos screamed.</p>
<p>"Sorry, Gus. You chose it yourself," the Leeming said, shooting out a pseudopodand flowing a part of himself up and around Gus's midsection.</p>
<p>Gus's tooth-filled mouth opened in amusement and obvious relief. "That tickles,Colonel. If I'da known that was all there was to it, I wouldn'ta bothered towaste a shot on you back in Agon."</p>
<p>The colonel withdrew rapidly.</p>
<p>"What is wrong?" Campos asked, sounding nervous herself now.</p>
<p>"It didn't work, that's all. It was as if there was something, some very thinbarrier surrounding the whole of his skin. I could not get through it." "Leave him, then! Get the baby and the girl and let's go!"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be all too certain that leaving is an option, Campos," Tonycommented, gesturing at the door, where even now the other Cloptans were tryingas hard as they could to penetrate without success.</p>
<p>Campos broke for the door, ran to it, and reached out as if to show that it wasjust a thin piece of nothing.</p>
<p>It was hard as a rock.</p>
<p>"Sorry, Campos. I want you right where I can see you," came a voice unfamiliarto most of them but very recognizable to others. It was a deep, melodic woman'svoice, and it came to each of them in his or her native language. "Mavra! Is that you?" Tony called, her voice echoing like all the rest in thevast chamber.</p>
<p>She gave a low, gusty laugh. "Yeah, it's me. I made it! Against all the odds, Imade it! Me! First in and in control. Hey, I didn't call the Well to get here;it called me! When I got this close, I knew that whatever the odds, it wouldprovide whatever I needed to get inside. I got to admit I was doubting it myselfthere, particularly at the last minute, but I'm here now. I'm not sure why allof you are here, but it seems appropriate somehow."</p>
<p>"Where are you?" Campos yelled at her, defiance still in her voice. "Why do youhide yourself from us?"</p>
<p>"Well, you know, when I get in here, I'm really not myself," Mavra responded. "Iguess I wanted a little time for you to settle down. But if you want to seewhat's become of your little birdie, then so be it!"</p>
<p>All the lights inside the chamber came on, illuminating them as if in daylight."Oh, my God!" Julian gasped. They all turned toward where she was looking andhad a similar reaction.</p>
<p>The creature that was approaching them was over two meters tall and remindedmost of them of nothing so much as a huge beating heart, skin a sickly blue andred, pulsing rhythmically, moving forward on six powerful-looking, sucker-laden,squidlike tentacles.</p>
<p>"I told you I wasn't myself in here," Mavra's voice came from somewhere withinit. "You see what I mean about the shock value. It's a pretty practical form,really, for this sort of thing, although it's not exactly current fashion. Thisis what they looked like, the people who built this place, at least at the end.By then they'd advanced far enough that they didn't need all the handy stuffevolution had provided earlier. I can't describe it to you. I'm doing a thousanddifferent exchanges with the Well right now, each perfectly clear, while I'musing just the tiniest part of myself to hold this conversation with you. I'mrunning and checking out math and diagnostics on a scale even I can't believe.I'm also seeing everything the Well is sending me, and I have 360-degree sightand absolute hearing through all the frequency ranges. And even with all that, Icouldn't begin to build something like this. Imagine a whole race with this kindof capability. It's staggering."</p>
<p>"You-you really were one of them, then?" Julian managed, amazed. Mavra laughed. "Oh, no. I couldn't imagine being one of them, or how they livedand thought. The Well just recreates me in the image of its makers, so to speak,because otherwise I couldn't work the controls here. I guess by their terms I'dprobably be a low-grade moron, but the capacity and speed of the brain are suchthat I can handle the routine stuff."</p>
<p>"Everything-the whole Well World-is maintained and controlled from here?" Gusasked, losing his abhorrence of her form and becoming more the old reporteragain.</p>
<p>Again Mavra laughed. "No, that's just one tiny little area here. A kind ofmicrocomputer, compared to the whole thing, that does relatively simple jobs.The main job of this thing, if you must know, is keeping the universe running." It was so staggering a concept and so impossible to believe that nobody had afollow-up on it for a while. Finally Gus said, "So God is a computer?" "You might say that. I get the idea that this isn't all of it, but there arelimits on what I can understand or do here. They didn't want their repairpersonnel playing too fast and loose with the universe. We're just dumblunkheads. We make decisions that are basically moral ones, ones the Well isn'tprogrammed to make for itself. If the fabric of space and time itself isdamaged, the way it was the last and only other time I was in here, we have tochoose to push the button and reset the universe. It's a mean responsibility ifyou think about it. I wiped out whole worlds of civilizations last time,probably killed multiple trillions of beings from all sorts of races, not justthe ones on the Well World. They didn't think a machine should ever have to makedecisions like that, so they assigned somebody to do it. The closest translationto the job would be 'Monitors,' but it often comes out as 'Watchers,' 'causethat's really the job, too. We just exist, and watch things, and make sure theydon't fall apart, while waiting for the phone to ring."</p>
<p>Campos was appalled. "You mean that is what all this is about? A stinkingcomputer calling its repairman! And for that all of us were wrenched from ourlives and twisted and reshaped and dropped into this nightmare of a world?" "Something like that," Mavra admitted. "It does have a way of making its summonsa bit dramatic if we can't get to one of its doorways in space, and I'm afraid alot of people often get dragged in. It wasn't designed that way. I doubt if itever occurred to the builders that people like you even existed, Campos, letalone that they'd be hauled over here to cause even more misery. I doubt if itever occurred to them just what trouble it might be for the Watcher to get inhere, either; otherwise they would have made it easier. But I'm here now inspite of the best efforts of quite a number of people to prevent it, includingsome of you here. The only ones I expected and invited were Lori and Julian.Ummm… Yes, minor detail to set right."</p>
<p>Lori's body was suddenly misty, then distorted, and when it was again clear anddistinct, Lori of Erdom, fully restored, stood in their midst. He shook his headas if clearing something out of it, something rattling around inside. Finally hesighed and said, "I feel like I'm waking up from some awful nightmare. I haveall these crazy memories, impressions, but most of them don't make any sense." "Well, you were a horse," Mavra pointed out. "I'm afraid all that information inyour head couldn't always fit in that horse brain, but your spirit, your drive,remained, and in the end you still did what you had to do."</p>
<p>"Julian, I-" he began, and stopped, seeing something in her eyes and manner. Itwas readily apparent that Julian was less than fully thrilled to see her husbandback to normal.</p>
<p>"Lori, Julian's going to be a little bit complicated, so just hang on for alittle bit," Mavra told him.</p>
<p>The colonel spoke, although they all were awed at the display of power Mavra hadjust performed. "You-you can do that? With your mind alone?"</p>
<p>"I just order it. I don't bother with how it's done any more than you botherwith how the electricity gets to the lamp when you turn it on. It's easy inspecific cases, but it gets more complicated if you have to do something on thescale of a hex. When you get beyond that, to whole civilizations and worlds, I'mnot so sure I'm up to it. Still, we may see."</p>
<p>Gus, too, was awed and fascinated, but not to the point where he didn't want topress things a bit to satisfy his curiosity. "So what's wrong?" he asked her. "Huh? What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Well, we all got stuck here for some reason, right? I mean, it called you andthe captain, and that was to fix stuff. What's broke?"</p>
<p>Mavra seemed disturbed by the question. "I-I've been trying to find out. All ofthe diagnostics so far are turning up just fine. The universe isn't in peril, noworld is about ready to die, nothing appears wrong. Still, we were called herefor something. The Well went to a great deal of trouble to get us here. I guessI haven't hit it yet, although that is rather odd. If something's broken enoughto summon us, then something in the Well's diagnostics routine should have toldme straight away. So far-nothing. It's very strange."</p>
<p>As if in response, she began to receive a data stream from somewhere deep withinthe Well. Something about a "Kraang Matrix Formula," but it didn't make anysense. It didn't correlate with anything in the Well's operational system, inthe symmetry of its physics and mathematics. What the hell was a Kraang MatrixFormula?</p>
<p>Before she could even request research information on it, another signal brokein, one she'd heard only once before but one that had provided a major motivatorfor her to reach the Well.</p>
<p>"Mavra! Mavra! You've done it! Now free me! Free me! "</p>
<p>"Obie? Is that really you? Can you really live again?" Once, in the past cycleof existence, before the last reset, she had roamed the universe with Obie, amoon-sized computer built by some of the most brilliant minds of her own time, aself-aware computer that could in a limited way do some of the things on avastly smaller scale that the Well could do. She could never explain Obie, buthaving to see him-Obie had always been a "him"-wiped out with the rest of thatuniverse had been the most horrible thing she had ever had to face because ofits permanence.</p>
<p>"How can I do it, Obie? I don't know a lot about working this thing." "I’ll send you the instructions. I already knew a lot, so I could follow whatwas being done here. Just pass the instructions along exactly as I give them toyou, no changes, no hesitations, and I'll once again be formed in orbit aroundthis world. Think of it, Mavra! The two of us together again!" No more horrors of existence on that grubby Earth, no more crawling before thelikes of Campos, no more pettiness and Earthbound strife… Together again,with that power, no matter how limited, roaming the universe, exploring,learning, helping out…</p>
<p>"Brazil never told you because he wanted me to die," Obie sent to her. "Hethought that my power was too great a potential disruption to the Well. Hecouldn't help it, but he did it, Mavra! He killed me, Mavra! And now you canbring me back! Now you are in charge! Take the data stream and command theinstructions! Free me! Free me!"</p>
<p>"Go ahead. Send. I'll try, Obie. I'll try!"</p>
<p>All the exchange, her internal debate, and the final decision, had, to theothers, taken place within the blink of an eye. They barely knew that somethingwas going on.</p>
<p>"So what will you do with us now?" the colonel asked her. "Revenge? That seems arather petty thing for one in your current circumstances."</p>
<p>"You are right," she answered him. "Revenge is something beyond a superiorcreature such as this one. When I am human, I am very vengeful, but not likethis. Not now."</p>
<p>She could see Campos seem to relax, and the colonel, more suspicious, also seema bit more comfortable. "What will you do, then?" Lunderman asked her. "Justice," she answered, sending new fear into them. "Justice is the highestcalling of a higher intellect."</p>
<p>"Sequence completed and program running. Done. Input accepted. Result nominal,"the Well reported to Mavra.</p>
<p>But what did that mean? Was Obie reconstituted, alive again in orbit? All theWell's local sensors showed no change. Nothing but the usual random debris upthere. What had she just done?</p>
<p>"Obie? Where are you, Obie?"</p>
<p>"Obie couldn't come," said a strange, commanding, powerful voice that seemed tofill the whole of the great hall. "So I came instead."</p>
<p>"Holy shit! It's another one!" Gus exclaimed. "And this one sounds like DarthVader!"</p>
<p>And from the center of the hall another shape appeared, very much like Mavra,but not quite like Mavra. It was bigger, more than three meters tall and halfagain as thick, and it seemed to be bathed in a radiant glow.</p>
<p>"How wondrous it is to be free once again!" the Kraang exclaimed. "I did notbelieve that it would ever happen in spite of my best efforts!" Mavra had no conception of who this newcomer was, but she knew pretty damnedwell that it had been the result of her commands to the Well, which was nowreporting a return to "nominal” status, meaning no more repairs were necessary. Mavra Chang tried to retrieve information on this newcomer, this bizarre newcreature who seemed to have come from nowhere, but she couldn't. Suddenly shefelt the Well closing off from her as if a series of switches were being thrownone by one, shutting her out, diminishing her…</p>
<p>She tried to fight, but the Kraang was out of her league. Suddenly, for thefirst time, she realized that it had all been for nothing, that she'd beenplayed for one of the biggest fools in the history of the cosmos. She stood there, suddenly just Mavra Chang again, a tiny Oriental-looking woman,slightly built, naked, and looking very, very small indeed.</p>
<p>"Don't feel so bad," the booming voice of the Kraang said to her. "I have beenmost impressed with you. Most impressed. You couldn't know about me because Iwas outside of the entire system, outside of the entire Master Program. It wasdesigned that way so that I would drift forever in space, neither fully alivenor dead, never intersecting or interacting with anything. Designed that wayover five billion years ago."</p>
<p>"You! It was you sending me those messages!" she said, openmouthed, neverfeeling more like a sucker in her whole life than right now. "And you were whatwas wrong! You were what I was called to fix!"</p>
<p>"Clever. Yes, it is true. You know the principle of the fifty million monkeys.That sooner or later fifty million monkeys at fifty million typewriters willwrite the works of Shakespeare if given an infinite amount of time. Well, mycondition was like that. Eventually, in a coincident situation during the lastreset, the Well was supposed to give a course correction that would havecontinued my endless lonely isolation. At that moment, however, the reset wasexecuted, and that command was not completely given. Eventually, an intersectionwas made in spite of it all. I was able to tap into the data stream, althoughonly in limited ways. I've been watching you-all of you-since you were processedthrough the Well and became part of the minor data stream. I've seen it allthrough your eyes, heard your thoughts, monitored your dreams. But it was allfor naught. All for nothing if someone came here who understood the problem andcorrected it. Fortunately, you made it in first, my dear. That will stand youforever in my favor."</p>
<p>"Nathan," she said guiltily. "If Nathan would've gotten here first, he wouldhave been able to deal with you."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's true, I suspect, although I am still not terribly clear on who orwhat he actually is beyond being a pathological liar. Severing him from the datastream will take considerably more work, but there is no hurry now, is there?" "You are one of the founders? An original of this race?" Lori asked. "I am."</p>
<p>"Then why did they imprison you so? And where did the rest of them go? Will youtell us that?"</p>
<p>"As a race they went collectively mad," the Kraang responded. "This insaneproject, this march to oblivion, began with nobler motives, but eventually theinfection was complete. Only I stood against them. Even those who agreed with mewere eventually won over, co-opted. Those who thought as I but did not have thecourage to speak or act against it were carried along in its momentum. They didnot exile me. They came to kill me. They came to put me through the Well, tomake of me what the Well did to you. I was the one with the courage, and I wastoo smart for them. Deep below here, in the workrooms and stations of the Well,I arranged my own exile. I exiled myself rather than be forced into theirmadness! And I did it in a prison of my own devising, one that was controlled byan endless loop that the Well itself could neither monitor nor touch. I supposethey might have been able to break it in time, but they apparently decided tolet it go, seeing how perfect my exile was. To them, I had committed a racialsin, and I had devised my own punishment, my own hell, as it were, and sentmyself forever to it. They did not know that I was in a suspended state, shutdown, all but the most minute part of myself in semioblivion so that the passageof such a great amount of time would be as nothing to me."</p>
<p>"But then, you must have known that somehow, sometime it would break down," Lorinoted, fascinated as they all were, even if still terrified of this strangespecter from out of ancient epochs.</p>
<p>"I was a mathematician," the Kraang explained. "I knew of randomness, of chaos,of the infinite amounts of time before this universe. Would it happen before theuniverse began to contract in upon itself once more and finally die as quietlyas it had been born so noisily? That I could not say. It was nonetheless a vastamount of time in which, even with the Well, almost anything could happen. Imust say that it never occurred to me that it would be this soon. Now, though, Iam here and they are gone. Now the Well serves me and me alone. Overall, thisuniverse is a patchwork remade by amateurs. I shall proceed to perfect it. Notright away, not so frighteningly dramatic, but slowly, with subtlety, withconscious interaction. I will provide the way, and the universe will choose tofollow me and perfect itself. That portion which does not will be destroyed. Myvision is a challenge to me, to the Well, to all the peoples and worlds of theuniverse! Those who see and accept me and my vision and follow shall inherit itunder me!"</p>
<p>"It sounds like you're thinking of becoming God Almighty," Anne Marie said somewhat scornfully.</p>
<p>"I AM GOD ALMIGHTY, MASTER OF THIS UNIVERSE AND ALL THAT IS WITHIN IT!" the Kraang thundered.</p>
<p>Then, in still thunderous but more moderate tones, he added. "That happened themoment my program was canceled. How can I explain it to your puny, primitiveintellects? The moment I returned to the point where I had left was the momentthat the Well came under my total and complete domination and will, aninstrument of myself. You are honored to be present at the coronation of the oneand only true God of the universe. Now and forever."</p>
<p>"Amen," Gus said a bit sourly.</p>
<p>Mavra just sat there, head down, thinking over and over, What have I done? Whathave I done?</p>
<p>The Kraang, however, was going on. It was, Gus supposed, the first time he'd hada captive audience in billions of years.</p>
<p>"What is God?" mused the Kraang. "The ultimate leader. Immortal, all-powerful,able to call up any fact, any bit of information, no matter how large or howsmall, as he chooses. One able to reward those who worship him and follow hisinstructions and to punish those who transgress his will, his whims, no matterhow petty. You all had gods-at least, virtually all of you-and one, Mavra Chang,played goddess for centuries to a bunch of people even more ignorant andprimitive than she. The god of the Jews slew whole populations because oneperson transgressed. He punished individuals who did nothing more than slip oncein an otherwise pious life with death and damnation. He set down a list of rulesso arcane, so complex, that no one could truly follow them all. And yet he couldtake someone who murdered, who committed adultery, who violated almost every oneof his commandments and make him a beloved king in spite of all that. Now whereis the logic in that? Yet on your world that god became god of the Christians,god of the Moslems, the most influential and important god on the planet. TheHindus-we won't even talk about the destroyer of universes; it isself-explanatory. They perhaps had the clearest idea of the system as it trulywas, but to what end? So that a rigid class structure could always be maintainedon the people by the ruling elite in which even social climbing would be amortal sin. The Buddhists-they saw through everything. Existence proceeded stageupon stage, until you reached the That Which Is Beyond. Oblivion. And that'sjust your world. You cannot imagine what some of the others came up with! Am Iso much worse than the gods you did worship? The gods you tried to follow? Or amI merely a threat because I am real, I exist, you cannot deny me or my power ordoubt it? You-none of you can rationalize me away!"</p>
<p>Mavra's head came up. 'This is an unlikely group of prophets to begin yourreign," she noted.</p>
<p>"Not at all," the Kraang responded. "Why, right now I can see that you arecontemplating either suicide or some futile and fatal heroic gesture to easeyour conscience. The colonel is trying to figure out the best way to ingratiatehimself with me, as always the pragmatist. Campos is a bit torn between herCatholic upbringing and her lust for power which she finds potentially vast inmy service. The Dillians are aghast but fatalistic. Lori and Gus are curiouslysimilar in their desires to just be out of all this, although Gus is far moreoffended by me than Lori. And Julian-my pretty Julian has been on the verge ofsuicide since she got here and is still confused about her purpose, her role,and how she could possibly fit in anywhere at all. Let me demonstrate how easyit is."</p>
<p>Julian was suddenly bathed in an unearthly glow, a radiance that gave her anearly supernatural look. Subtly, she was changing, not from being an Erdomesebut into the absolutely ideal image of the Erdomese female, a change so perfect,so precise, and so beautiful that even those who weren't Erdomese could see itand even feel it. And upon her face was a look like no other, an expression oftotal and abject worship, of complete and utter innocence and joy. She fell downand prostrated her new self before the Kraang.</p>
<p>"And you shall henceforth be called Sowacha. which in Erdomese means 'Daughterof Heaven,' and all who see you and speak with you will know that your name isof me and my power and that you wield it in my name and with my authority," theKraang intoned. "You will seek counsel only of me and return to your land as myservant and agent. I shall bless and protect you, and you shall be unsullied,without blemish or sin, and the church, and the land, shall know you as one whois my own. You shall lead the people in my name, and in my name you shall remakethe land and people as I command."</p>
<p>"Yes, my lord and master," she responded, never getting up or looking up. "You see?" the Kraang said to the others. "It really is that easy. I do not needor require your loyalty or your consent. It is merely a matter of reprogrammingyour rather simple minds."</p>
<p>The others were frightened to death by the demonstration, but Mavra Chang wasjust consumed by anger. She moved to rise but found she was frozen, stuck whereshe was. She couldn't outthink the Kraang; he had the whole damned Well at hisbeck and call thanks to her.</p>
<p>Damn it! The bastard had won! When he finished his ego trip, they'd all marchout of here like Julian, slaves to the Kraang, devoting all their lives andthoughts and energies to whatever he wanted. And there wasn't a single damnedthing they could do about it!</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of the darkness, the baby cried. They had all forgotten aboutTerry and the child. Even the Kraang for some reason hadn't included her in hissurvey of the group. Now, though, all the attention was diverted to the small,dark girl with the infant.</p>
<p>She walked steadily out of the shadows, looking expressionlessly at the Kraang.When she got to Anne Marie, she stopped, looked up at the Dillian, and said,"Anne Marie, take the baby. I think I've had just about enough of thisegomaniac's bullshit."</p>
<p>If anything could shock them more than the Kraang and his demonstration of purepower, it was Terry speaking and speaking so determinedly.</p>
<p>'Terry?" Gus managed, but even though it was Terry's body and Terry's old voice,it just didn't sound like Terry. It sounded like… like… The girl went up to a stunned and frightened Juana Campos, reached in herpocket, and pulled out the last of Gen Taluud's cigars, biting off the end andsticking it in her mouth. She didn't strike a match; she just pointed at theend, and it burst into flame.</p>
<p>If anybody was more shocked than all the people present, it was the Kraang. "Ahhh… That's so much better," said the girl after a few puffs on the cigar."You can't believe how I missed these. Pure Ambrezan. That Taluud was a scumbagbut he definitely had good taste."</p>
<p>The Kraang stood there on its tentacles, saying nothing, moving not at all. butthe heartlike pulsations of its body were reaching a fever pitch. "Keep trying, Kraang. If you try hard enough to control me, then you might justbust something. You're still flesh and blood, you know, renewable or not." The Kraang was suddenly aghast, his enormous triumphal return spoiled by ananomaly his great brain could not understand, comprehend, or get data on.Massive quantities of data were going by at the speed of light itself, but theKraang was coming up totally empty, as empty as Mavra had been in trying to findout about the Kraang.</p>
<p>"You weren't the only one, you know," Terry said, letting some ash fall to thefloor. "I took a different route. I always was a better programmer than you." "YOU! It's-impossible!"</p>
<p>"Not impossible, just damned hard. I just gave birth to a goddamned baby, forChrist's sake! Not even Mavra's had to undergo that wonderful experience! It washard as hell switching in and out to keep me out of the data stream you weremonitoring. Fortunately, the Well measured the probabilities of Mavra gettinghere first and factored in a few extra wrinkles. Those damned Glathrieliansthought they were going to control me with their powers, but all they did washand them to me to use. Handed them to me just as the Well figured when I rottedlazily back there in Ambreza instead of coming immediately to answer its call,in the person of one very fascinating and exceptional young woman named TheresaPerez. And it still had to explode a damned volcano under me to get me to dowhat I should've done right off! I'm as crazy as you are, Kraang, and just asmuch a shirker of responsibility, but I'm here now!"</p>
<p>Mavra's head came up, and she stared at the girl. "Nathan? Is that really you?" In an absolute instant, without any sense of any time passing between, the girlwas suddenly gone and in her place stood another being, a being slightly smallerthan but otherwise identical to what Mavra had been and what the Kraang was now. And in one tentacle it still held the burning cigar. The tentacle shot over to afrozen Juana Campos and stuck the cigar in her mouth. "Here," Brazil said. "Idon't like to see cigars that good go to waste."</p>
<p>The Kraang was appalled at the vision. "It really is you! How-how is itpossible? I had everything, everything factored in! There was no mistake!" "Sure there was. As soon as you bought my line on the life history I gave to Gusthe same way Mavra bought your disinformation about Obie and Brazil," Brazilresponded. "I was just another amateur, just like her, only more experienced.Isn't that what you said not long ago? A universe recreated by amateurs? Did youreally think I'd leave the Well so unprotected? I never did figure out whathappened to you, but I always figured that if I beat the system, then othersmust have, too. In a way I'm glad it was you this time. Mathematicians are sodamned logical."</p>
<p>Only Gus among them had the nerve to inject himself into a discussion betweentwo gods. "So what were you?" he asked.</p>
<p>Brazil chuckled. "Me? I was an artist!”</p>
<p>"This is more an inconvenience than a defeat," the Kraang told him. "I have fullaccess to the Well. If I cannot touch or harm you, neither can you do anythingto me! At the moment we are at a standoff. But I know from your own historiesstored here that you cannot exit the Well on your own as you are. I can! Youmust remain here, imprisoned in the Well alone, forever, just to retain youraccess and retard my project. Every god must have a devil, I suppose. We willplay a game. I will go everywhere, and you will try to stop me from doinganything you do not like. But you must do it from here! Yourself! I, on theother hand, will be free to ride the whole of the trans-spacial nets and roamthe stars! I can be anywhere, anything, any time I wish to be. And eternity is avery long time."</p>
<p>'Tell me about it," Brazil said sourly. "Still, as much as I hate to spoil yourgodhead and coronation or even your lofty dreams, I'm afraid you're going to bein for a very, very big shock. Still, you want to leave, leave. Go ahead. Iwon't even try to stop you. You know where the exit is and how to use it. Go on,go ahead. Try to be a god. You'll quickly see how boring and silly it gets." The Kraang thought that Brazil was being too smug and overconfident, and he knewenough not to trust anything the other said or claimed, particularly now. Buttry as he might, cross-indexed and fully researched, the Kraang could findabsolutely nothing that Brazil had left as any sort of trap.</p>
<p>"Lost your nerve, have you, Kraang? Pretty poor performance for a god to losehis nerve. Of course, you can stick around here. Plenty to do, I suppose. Beenfive billion years and then some since we matched wits with some of those gamesthat are still in the core system. Or do you remember that you used to beat meall the time when we were setting up but after a while you couldn't beat me everagain? That's because you never were willing to take risks. You had a grasp ofmath that's truly godlike, but you never, ever went against the probabilities.Even your clever exile trick was done with a keen eye to probabilities, giventhe limits placed on you. I cost you this round at the last minute by takingsome risks, but maybe you'll win the next time. It'll relieve the boredom,anyway."</p>
<p>The Kraang seethed with anger and frustration, but he had been trying any numberof combinations and at no time could he supersede Brazil's command of the Well.While they had been talking in normal time, a massive battle of intellectsthroughout the computer that took up the entire inner surface of the Well Worldhad been going on, a battle of such speed and complexity that those who watchedcould never have comprehended or described it.</p>
<p>Mental thrust… parry… access denied… backdoor… access denied…wall off… sector not available… Even in his enhanced form, the battlewasn't easy for Brazil nor was the outcome certain. In a sense, both he and theKraang were equals here, equals before the Well computer, equals in knowledge,skill, and the ability to use the vast power and ultra-complex engineering ofthe master world, at speeds and on dimensional planes that were far beyondmortal comprehension. It wasn't one parry, one thrust, one end-around attempt,but thousands… millions… quadrillions all at once, like some vast chessgame at superlight speeds with unlimited pieces.</p>
<p>Whole lifetimes of mental battle had taken place in the space of one second inreal time. Brazil realized that he'd been far too cocky, far too confident inhis power here. He'd forgotten what it was like to come up against an opponentof his native race, one fueled by eons of hatred and a lust for power. I'vebecome too much a man, Brazil thought worriedly. He could not sustain a defenseagainst the level of sheer emotion that had been stored up in the Kraang for sovery, very long.</p>
<p>Equal! Equal, damn it! Dead even! Brazil began to see this as an eternalstruggle in which strength of will was paramount and patience everything. Therewas no way he could keep this up forever and he knew it; more, there was nopurpose to doing so. There had to be an answer! As it stood, neither he nor theKraang could make use of this vast power beyond the automatics that served themboth. Equals…</p>
<p>There just had to be an answer! Some way in which they were not equals. Someway, no matter how minor, in which Brazil had some kind of edge. And in the countless moves and countermoves between two more ticks of the clock,he had it. It was too obvious; it had been handed him on a platter right at thestart. That was why he'd had to endure so much before he suddenly realized thatit was there. The one thing that separated the two of them. The one thing thatmade the Kraang vulnerable. The one thing anyone not so desperate or so close tothe problem would have seen immediately.</p>
<p>The Kraang eased back to where he'd appeared, which they now saw was a hexagonalplate embedded in the floor. He moved onto the plate, shimmered, and was gone. Brazil waited there a minute, saying and doing nothing, then relaxed. "Well, I'mglad he's gone! Yessir, ridin' those hyperspacial nets…" He seemed in greatspirits, as if enjoying some little private joke. Then he saw Julian, still theradiant daughter of heaven, although at the moment a wee bit disoriented. Shesuddenly lost her radiant glow, although he let her keep that perfect Erdomeseform. It wasn't bad, he thought appreciatively. Maybe the Kraang did have alittle artist in him, after all.</p>
<p>"Go on back over with the others, Julian. You've just been unconverted," he saidlightly.</p>
<p>Mavra could not see why he was in such a wonderful mood. "You-you can just letthat monster roam at will out there? After seeing what he can do?" "Oh, come on, Mavra!" Nathan Brazil scolded her. "You know when a con's workingas well as I do. Or at least you used to. I begin to wonder after the one youfell for yourself. Talk about amateurs! You fell for the worst, most basic, mostobvious con I could think of-and it almost cost us everything. You've got toknow deep down that this was one hell of a lot closer than I let him think itwas."</p>
<p>"I understood that much," she responded. "And I'm aware that an awful lot moreprobably went on between the two of you than we'll ever know. Did you really setup the Well so that you'd have to be here if any other Markovian managed tosurvive?".</p>
<p>"Well, not exactly, but I think I'll add that capability now before we leave.You see, the time when we were in here together so long ago. I added a conditionthat so long as I was around, alive and kicking, you couldn't enter the Wellexcept in my presence. Until we got here, I had no idea that the Kraang wasstill around, let alone that he was potentially loose, until you did." "You what!"</p>
<p>"What are you so sore about? If I hadn't done that, look at what would havehappened!"</p>
<p>"You didn't trust me!"</p>
<p>Nathan Brazil chuckled. "Hey, kid, you only had your learner's card. Still do,in fact, considering how this turned out."</p>
<p>"But-but-what about the Kraang? He's still out there! And he's still connectedto the Well!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, he is, I guess," Brazil sighed. "Only even he knew a con when he heardone, and he still fell for it once I realized what his weak spot was. And he'dtold me-told us all-just what that one weakness was. He really was a god. He'dalmost always been a god, or at least a god, junior grade. Man! Anything youwanted-the energy-to-matter transformers made it for you just like you imaginedit! Anything you wanted to be, to experience, to use, to own, to look at. Thereit was. That's how I conned 'em during the Great Transmigration. I became NathanBrazil, or a reasonable facsimile thereof anyway, in Glathriel, which was a kindof pet project of mine, anyway. I conned 'em into thinking I'd gone the wholeway, that I'd become a Glathrielian. The way I worked it, I showed up as justanother guy, even to the Well. The only thing was, the Well had specialinstructions and links to me. I conned 'em. Designed it right into the program." "But the Kraang-"</p>
<p>"Is not designed into the program that way," Brazil told her.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute," Lori put in, feeling an immense weight slowly lifting from him."If he's not designed in like you or Mavra, then…"</p>
<p>"You got it!" Nathan Brazil responded lightly. "There's hope for you yet, Lori." "Well, I don't get it!" Gus said, "and I don't see nobody else gettin' it,neither."</p>
<p>But Mavra Chang suddenly did, and she started laughing, and the laughter grew soloud and long that it echoed through the great hall and woke up the baby again. "Mind letting us in on this, since you woke up the kid?" Gus called to her. She got control of herself. "Let me see if I got this right. When he left, herode the hyperspace nets as he said, whatever the hell they are, and he came outsomeplace, just as he always did when he was back in ancient times. But allthose worlds are dead now. They've been dead for billions of years. So he'sgoing to come out on a lonely, barren, incredibly ancient world of theMarkovians, and he's going to see only artifacts and death. He's probably doingthat right now. And then…" She started to laugh again and tried to fight it."And then he'll have no choice but to move on! He'll probably have big, bigplans, but to do them he'll have to use the gate that's there! And when he does…"</p>
<p>Lori suddenly saw it. "He'll wind up back here!" he finished, openmouthed. "Butin Zone. North or south, just like we did. And the only way he can get out is touse the Zone Gate, and that will process him just as it was designed to do somany years ago!"</p>
<p>"Wait a minute!" Gus put in. "Are you tellin' me that the only place thategomaniacal bastard can go is right back here? And that when he comes through,his only choice will be to be transformed into one of the races here, just likeml So he'll be as mortal, as ordinary as we are?"</p>
<p>"Unless he figures it out, sitting there on that world," Brazil replied. "Hemight. Probably will, in fact. He was never a dummy, even back then. But then,so what? What's his choice? To live like he did before, with everything at hisbeck and call, but alone, on a deserted world, not comatose but fully awake,looking at the skies all the time and not being able to do a damned thing aboutit. Totally, completely, thoroughly alone."</p>
<p>"Until somebody conies along in a spaceship," Mavra said worriedly. "He's waitedthis long. He can wait."</p>
<p>"It's a pretty big universe," Nathan Brazil pointed out. "But we can check andsee just where he wound up. And maybe, before we leave, we'll kind of nudge theprobabilities of his ever being found a little more toward the infinite.Besides, even if he got off that world by conventional means, he'd be off thenet, out of the loop. He wouldn't dare ever go through a Well Gate. His datalinks will only be as good as his proximity to one of the ancient worlds, sowhat will he be? Not a god. At best a very smart freak. I think we can deal withthe Kraang. The one absolute guarantee we now have is that at worst he can neverbe more than a local menace. He can't get back in here, and he can't get back onthe net. He's back to reality, just the way he was before he took himself out ofthe loop. All the old rules apply again."</p>
<p>"Maybe you're right. I hope so," Mavra said.</p>
<p>"And now we can go on to lighter fare," Brazil told her.</p>
<p>"You mean taking care of this bunch?"</p>
<p>"No, no, something far more of a puzzle than that."</p>
<p>"Huh? What?"</p>
<p>"Why'd you walk out on me in Babylon?" he asked.</p>

<p>Control Room 27, Well of Souls</p>
</title>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I WANT YOU ALL TO COME DOWN WITH ME TO MY CONTROL room," Nathan Brazil toldthem. "Just follow me. It's not a long journey, not after the one you all havetaken."</p>
<p>Nobody objected. Nobody was in a position to object much to anything, havingseen what one creature like Brazil could do.</p>
<p>"Do you really want to know?" Mavra asked him as they crossed the great hall. "Huh?"</p>
<p>"Do you really want to know why I left you in Babylon, or were you just beingyour usual self?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Of course I want to know."</p>
<p>"You can read it from the data stream."</p>
<p>"Not really. And that's only the facts, not what's inside you." She thought about how to explain it. "Nathan, you really were comfortable there.And in all the other civilizations and cultures we passed through and lived in." "Well, a few were new to me, but mostly, I'd been there before," he admitted. "No, that's not what I mean. You were in your element there. I'm not justtalking about it being primitive, I'm talking about the fact that in spite of itall, you succeeded. You talked to tons of people, you ate and drank and sangsongs with them, you had no trouble worming your way into their societies andgetting what jobs you wanted. You'd already been captain of two trading vessels,one in the Red Sea and the other in the Mediterranean, before we ever reachedBabylon."</p>
<p>"Well, it takes some practice to-"</p>
<p>"No. You're not connecting in spite of that super brain of yours at the moment.Don't you see? While you were off with the boys drinking and carousing andtelling tall tales, which is where I wanted to be and what I wanted to be doing,I was stuck back in wherever we were living. Or I was stuck with the otherwomen-most of whom were ignorant, dull, and had never been out of the confinesof their native cities or towns-doing the only stuff women were allowed to do. Ididn't fit with them; it's not my style at all. The roles were so stratifiedthat there was just no way to break out, really do something, interact with theinteresting people, who were almost always men because the men got to do theinteresting things. After a while I just couldn't take it. There was a lot tosee and do even in that ancient world, but I wasn't allowed to do it, and yoursecondhand recountings only made it worse. Women were property in thosesocieties; even at our levels they were expected to stay home and be protectedand do womanly things. Break the rules, try something outside of those roles,and you got stoned, burned at the stake, or raped. You've never been a woman inthose times. You can't imagine what it's like."</p>
<p>"I've been a woman for part of this trip, even pregnant, and while it'sdifferent, I can't say as I can see the problem."</p>
<p>"You experienced some of the physical aspects but not the social. Nathan, theonly man of Terry's race that you interacted with was, well, you. In fact, it'smuch more liberating to be a woman here, particularly if you're not in your ownhome hex. To all the other races you're just another funny foreign creature.They may have hang-ups about their own men or women, but they don't apply thatto other races. You never once had to face the simplest challenge for a womanback on Earth, walking down a dark street at night in a strange city alone. Ican't describe it. I can do the same thing here, just like this, and it'stotally different. Both Julian and Lori understand what I mean, even if Lorikind of forgot it in a power trip that I find totally understandable. EvenCampos had a taste of it, for all she learned from it. In my own era I livedwith elements of it, but I had more freedom, more opportunity; I could become aspaceship pilot, go where I wanted, and be one of the group singing the songsand telling the stories. On Earth I felt shut out-and there was no relief insight! It wasn't any one thing, it was a lot of things. I walked into hell whenI walked out on you, but it was no worse than the hell I was stuck in. That'swhy, when I finally did get away, I didn't come back. I couldn't take that roleagain. I couldn't live my life through your experiences."</p>
<p>Brazil was silent for a bit, thinking over what she'd said and sifting it in hismind. "In primitive societies I don't see a way around it, really. With theirlives so very short, they built their societies to ensure propagation. 'Womenand children first' was the old rule, and women were noncombatants because eachwoman could bear a child only once every nine months while one man couldimpregnate one woman a day. It's ironic, really, that much of this evolved morethan anything else out of the basic social realization that men were expendable.Even conquering armies would slay all the men but carry the women off. Therewere exceptions, of course-there always are. But we can't be the exceptions inany of those societies; sooner or later somebody will notice that everybody elseis aging, growing old, and we aren't. The exceptions-Hypatia, Cleopatra, Joan ofArc-they get written up in history books."</p>
<p>"Yeah, and most of them die violent deaths at young ages, anyway," she noted. "Ilooked for the Amazons in Greece but never really linked up with them. I thinkI'd have been a little small for their lot, anyway. The only place I did findany peace and equality was on a little island off the coast of southern Greecethat was an all-woman society, but it turned out to be a lot more boring andmore a matriarchy than I figured. Besides, I didn't 'look' right to them. I wasaccepted as a guest, but I couldn't stay, not with these features. I began towonder, though, whether you had to have an all-female army or an all-femalesociety to just get some sense of freedom."</p>
<p>"And when you found it, however basic, in the Amazon rain forests, you juststayed. Yeah, I can understand the situation, but it's not quite the good andeasy life being a man, either. Still, you should have come out and taken a lookonce in a while. Things changed, dramatically. Not all the way, but a lotbetter, even in my namesake Brazil and more to the north in America and inEurope."</p>
<p>"I found that out with Lori and Julian. A woman astronomer and professor, a guywho flew in spaceships… It was so damned slow, and then everything seemed tohappen in a hurry. But by that time I was so isolated, so set, and had beendoing it for so long, I barely remembered any other life. And all I saw therewas women's pain, and heard stories of more of it, and I had no desire to move." "Urn, excuse me," the colonel interrupted. "I hate to intrude, but just whereare we going? And why?"</p>
<p>"Just come down the moving ramp here and follow," Brazil said in an irritatedtone. "We're going down to the control room so we can decide just what the hellto do with all of you."</p>
<p>Campos crossed herself.</p>
<p>The moving walkway went down into the bowels of the planet. Every once in awhile it would take them right through a hexagonal portal of deepest black, asif going into a tunnel, only there was no tunnel there. They quickly becameaware that every time they did that, they moved a tremendous distance in a veryshort time.</p>
<p>Finally they reached Brazil's destination, going through a bizarre workshopwhose size was on a scale that dwarfed their imaginations. Everything wasmassive, was apparently working, and looked as if it had been built two daysearlier and cleaned just before they arrived.</p>
<p>There were openings all around in a massive hexagonal shaft, not just on theirlevel but going up and down as far as they dared look. The openings were markedbecause they were not hexagons but great semicircles, and inside each wasdarkness-darkness but not inactivity, as countless small bits of energy flew androuted and shot around almost as if they were tiny galaxies in acceleratedmotion. They went in between two such openings and down a short corridor andfound themselves in a room that bore no resemblance to any they'd seen before.The wall was filled with tiny triangular shapes, each with a unique code on itin some kind of luminescent dots. In the center were two very strange lookingpedestals, and as Brazil glided to one and crawled into it, it was suddenlyobvious that these were in fact chairs for the race that had worked here. Mavra, still human, pulled herself up on the other one and sat cross-legged onit, looking at the others. They in turn all stood looking back at them, bothfearful and nervous.</p>
<p>"You'll pardon me if I have to remain in this form," Nathan Brazil said to them."I need to do that to interact with and control the machinery with anyprecision. I think we ought to conclude our business as quickly as possible now,and we'll start with the easy ones. Tony? Anne Marie? You got what I promisedyou back in the hills west of Rio that night. You got yourselves involved earlywith the wrong folks, but you also stuck with Julian and saw the consequencesthrough. I can only ask you what you want to do now."</p>
<p>Tony and Anne Marie both frowned. "Just what exactly do you mean, Captain?" Tonyasked.</p>
<p>"Just what I said. Would you like to return to Dillia?</p>
<p>Would you rather go to where the Dillian project wound up? A world still a bitprimitive but civilizing fast, much like our old one in that regard, in whichyour present kind are the dominant species? Or would you rather be someone,something else? Tony a man again, perhaps?"</p>
<p>"Oh, dear. This is for real and forever, isn't it?" Anne Marie responded. "I-I'mafraid I don't know what to say. I'm quite satisfied the way I am. I'm young,healthy, and attractive, and other than being young before, the other two arestill very new to me. I hardly feel like second-guessing your computer." "I have but one regret," Tony told them. "I regret that in this form I cannotfly again. I did love it, you know. But this is not a bad form, and it has agreat deal to recommend it. I never did put much stock in what people lookedlike on the outside, anyway. Anne Marie is my dearest friend, but I would nevereven have met her had not misfortune sat so heavily on us both. As opposites, wewould of course marry, and our course would be fixed, and that perhaps would bea shame. We would never know our potential or be able to become individuals. Ithink this machine is perhaps wiser than we. I would never have dreamed of thissolution, but it is the one that is right for both of us. As for the Dillianworld, it would be fascinating but not, I think, as fascinating as the endlessvariety right here." She took Anne Marie's hand and squeezed it, and the othersmiled knowingly.</p>
<p>"Let's go home, dear," Anne Marie said softly, and she meant to Dillia. She tookthe baby and gave it to Gus, who</p>
<p>looked most uncomfortable with it, and after he did what he could to support thechild, he looked back to complain to Anne Marie that maybe he wasn't the rightone for this job.</p>
<p>But the two centaurs suddenly weren't there anymore.</p>
<p>"And now we have you, Colonel," Nathan Brazil said with a stern tone creepinginto his voice. "You have a very warped view of honor and duty, I think. Anne Marie compared you to Talleyrand. Imet Talleyrand once, and I checked to make sure I still had my purse when Ileft. Still, everything he did, beyond ensuring his own survival, was because hebelieved that he was doing his best to serve his country and its people. In asense he was a pragmatic anarchist. He knew that his nation was going to have agovernment, and he firmly believed that no matter what that government was, itwasn't the one France truly needed. He was trying to save what he could throughit all, and he did a reasonable job, considering the obstacles. But you're noTalleyrand, Colonel. You never cared about your country or your people. Youclimbed up from virtually the bottom, and then you forgot what it was like to bethere. You didn't just sell your service to get out. you sold your soul. Younever even thought of the people you hauled in during the dictatorship as realpeople. And you sold your services and honor on the side to some petty druglords of a neighboring nation whose product infected your own people as badly asthose to the north. Then you got here, and what did you do? The Leeming accordedyou rank beyond anything a newcomer deserved, and you sold it again-to the samedamned types of people! And then you rationalized every single bit of it. You'reamazing, Colonel. You're the only man I know who sold his soul twice to the samebidders."</p>
<p>"You are unfair! I never betrayed my country! Never!"</p>
<p>Brazil gave a big sigh. 'That's the tragedy, Colonel. You can't even understandwhat you did. 'I didn't gas the Jews! I just followed Himmler's orders!' My, Iheard that one enough! No, Colonel, you didn't betray anybody. And all thosehomicidal fanatics in Peru got a lot of their money because you arranged transitto Venezuela for their goods. And then those goods went all over the planet andpoisoned thousands, tens of thousands. But you didn't do it. Like those deathsquads you allowed to go through Rio and Sao Paulo and the other cities ofBrazil, killing off all those poor children-children. Colonel!-because they werebad for business. Just tidying up. Doing your duty for God and country, going toconfession once a week to be absolved of all your sins. Take the Eucharist onSunday with a clear conscience."</p>
<p>"Do not lecture me! You! The mighty immortal! How can you know what it is liketo have to fight and starve and claw your way to anything before you die? Youknow you will survive, ageless, through the generations!"</p>
<p>"Oh, I've seen death, Colonel," Brazil told him. "Death is a very old friend. Iadmit he's never come for me, although I had a little glimpse of him when Ithought I might not make it here. I've seen death clearer than almost anyone.It's all around me. Always! I see it take everyone, the rich and poor, young andold, innocent and guilty alike. Sometimes I have to run from it. I have to makemyself hard in order to stand the view. But I hate it. I hate it more than Ihate anything else. Maybe I can't understand what made you this way, not really,but I can understand that for everyone in your position when you began, most didnot make the choices you did. No, Colonel, I reject your thesis." The colonel drew himself up and became the semblance of the man he'd been,impressive and ramrod straight. "Then we can never resolve this. I am yourprisoner. I die with dignity, like a soldier! I will not crawl or beg!" "I'm not going to kill you, Colonel," Nathan Brazil told him. "I'm not going tokill anybody here, not even Campos, who deserves it more than anybody. I'm goingto give you an opportunity you never gave any of your victims. I'm going to giveyou one last chance to get your soul back."</p>
<p>The colonel vanished.</p>
<p>Campos was increasingly nervous. "Where did he go?" she demanded to know. "Whatdid you do with him?"</p>
<p>"I sent him back."</p>
<p>"Back! Back where?"</p>
<p>"Home. To Brazil. In a little while he'll wake up and discover where he is.He'll find that a few things have left him. The knowledge that comes fromeducation, reading, writing, a wide vocabulary, other languages, that sort ofthing, but he will know. He will know even though where he will wake up is in acorrugated box in a garbage dump on the outskirts of Sao Paulo. He'll be a childagain, but this time an orphan dressed in rags, along with all the other suchpeople who try to survive day to day on the garbage of the well-to-do whosehomes they can see way off in the hills and in the downtown high-rises. Theoriginal child died of exposure and malnutrition the instant he went into thebody. He won't die, though. Not right off. Not if he moves fast enough and hideswell enough. It's lower than he's ever been. It's about as low as you can be.And I've given him an added little factor, an added degree of difficulty, so hecan have a real appreciation of those he never saw in life except as victims.The child I chose from far too many available to me is a nine-year-old girl." "You bastard!" Campos cried. "And what will you do to me? The same sort ofmiserable thing? Well, go ahead! No matter what you do to me, I shall always bea Campos! Not even being a female duck could stop me! You better kill me or Iwill rise from whatever depths you plunge me into! And unless you wish to batheyour own hands, or whatever they are, in innocent blood, remember that there isstill a Campos here!"</p>
<p>"No there's not," Brazil responded. "The baby's father is Carlos Antonio Quail,a sergeant in the Brazilian Air Force, and the union wasn't even forced." BeforeCampos's expression had even fallen at this, Brazil added, "And I just lovechallenges!" And with that. Juana Campos vanished as well.</p>
<p>Mavra looked at him. "Well?"</p>
<p>"Well what?"</p>
<p>"What did you do to the SOB? I think he was right, by the way. I didn't kill himwhen I had the chance, and look at the horrors he caused here. I was neverreally positive before, but now I know that there really are some people sototally evil that you just can't teach them."</p>
<p>"Who said anything about teaching? Maybe I'm wrong, but he gave me a challengeand I accepted. I sure wouldn't put her in a box in Sao Paulo. In ten yearsshe'd probably have the most vicious girl gang in that city. Still, let's see." "You're not going to tell me?"</p>
<p>"Later. We have other business before we can get to our business." "At least-the kid really isn't his?"</p>
<p>"No. That's how Terry diverted attention from the meteor while you and theothers got through. It was your own plan, remember."</p>
<p>"Urn, yeah. I'm not feeling so great about that now. Still, I'm glad to know ithasn't got any trace of the Campos bloodline."</p>
<p>"Yeah, what're you gonna do with this kid?" Gus asked them. "I'm getting realnervous just trying to hold him right, and he's pissed all over me oncealready!"</p>
<p>"Patience, Gus, we'll get to you," Brazil said lightly to the Dahir, and thenturned his attention more to Mavra. "Well? You're the one who made the promisesto Lori and Julian."</p>
<p>She shrugged and looked at the Erdomese, who both felt that they were present atthe Last Judgment. "I promised you two anything you wanted if I got here. Well,I'm here."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but I don't know what to ask for," Lori responded. "I'll tell you what Iwould want, or at least I think I do, but I can't say how. I put a lot of timeand effort into my field because I loved it. Maybe I was trying to provesomething to myself, maybe I was trying to excel as a woman in a man's field,all that, but the bottom line was that there were a lot of places I could havedone that. When I got here, I enjoyed being a man in a man's society for once,but it was a society I didn't want to live in. I could look at the stars, morethan I'd ever known, through Erdom's bright, clear skies, but I couldn't studythem. I couldn't work in physics at all. The most I could be, under optimumconditions, was muscle. A strong arm with a sword. I wanted more than that. Ihad more than that back home. I like this form, its strength, its power, theabsence of the kind of fear Mavra told you about, but what good is it if it'sall you are or can ever be? The only thing of real value I got out of Erdom wasJulian."</p>
<p>Julian gave him a humorless smile. "And that's what I am, even to you. A 'thing'of value," she noted. "I can't blame you any, really. When we came through thathex, that matriarchy, where the women ruled supreme and the men were no morethan objects, there was no real difference. I'm still not even sure if I thinklike a woman, really, or like a guy who was forced to take what he dished out. Iknow that most women can't see the serious problems that men have insociety-their lack of freedom-and part of that is that they don't want to. Whenyou're down, you resent the ones that are higher up. When you're a higher-up,you forget what it was like to be down. And neither side can ever really cometogether. Me, I've got the impossible problem. I finally came to terms with thisshape and form and sex. I like it. I like the way I look, the way I feel, andI've found I can do things many of the men couldn't. But I don't want to go backto being a piece of property, a 'thing of value,' without a voice, withoutrights, without even the freedom to think serious thoughts. I was a scientist,too, you know. I kept faith because I needed Lori, and he needed me, but, let'sface it, I don't need Lori anymore." Lori seemed shocked at the statement Julianmade and shook his head sadly. He didn't understand this at all. Mavra shook her head sadly at Julian. "You're wrong. You're still wrong. You'vebeen through all this, more experiences and more damned personalities than mostfolks could ever imagine, and you haven't really learned a thing. A person alone who needs nobody else isn't a whole person at all. Even the plantcreatures here interact. And I don't know anybody, except maybe Nathan andmyself, who needs somebody more than you do. In a sense, the Kraang was rightabout you. What don't you like about Julian Beard? That he was self-centered,egotistical, that he saw everybody else as kind of props in his life? I got thatmuch from you the moment you stepped in here, but he wasn't a bad man, just vainand selfish to the core. The Well took that away from you, and in a vain andselfish fit you decided death was better than not being the center of theuniverse. Lori rescued you from that, but he didn't make you the center of theuniverse, either. Within the limits of that atrocious society he tried to makeyou a partner, but you couldn't stand it in the end. You couldn't survive thatway, or at least you didn't want to, and you couldn't survive any other way. Youwere so desperate to break free that you let those butchers mess with your mindeven though you had a pretty good idea that they'd mutilated Lori and me. Youwere relieved when you found Lori as a horse. That put you in the center again,the one controlling him. Even then you needed his guts to get here." Mavra sighed and looked over and up at Nathan's pulsating bulk. "Well? You got the big brain right now. What do you think?"</p>
<p>"I think that while we're going to have to correct Erdom a bit, these two justdon't belong in a nontech environment," Brazil commented. "On the other hand, akind of compromise that you sort of suggested with your comments and a fewthings said elsewhere here present a possibility."</p>
<p>"That I suggested?" Mavra came back, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Yeah. It's going to take some really major work here, though. Let me see. Gus?You've been the most solid one through this whole mess. If there's anyone I'dwant with me in a nasty situation, it would be you. You've also got more moralsense than the rest of the bunch put together."</p>
<p>"Nice to hear," Gus told him. "But it don't count for much, does it? I'm a big, fat lizard holdin" Terry's baby, but all that time I thought I was stickin' byher, it turned out to be you."</p>
<p>"No, you're wrong, Gus," Brazil told him almost tenderly. "She was there. I hadto hide myself so thoroughly that not a trace of my true self emerged.Occasionally I had to switch back and forth between that damned rehab tank inAgon and her body. She knew, Gus. She was there all along."</p>
<p>"Until your comin'-out party. Where is she now?" he asked.</p>
<p>"In that body, my old body, which has healed with astonishing speed, at leastfrom the point of view of the medical people there. They're the ones keeping hersedated for the moment. In fact, they've taken it out of the tank, restrained,still sedated, and have transported it to the Agonese capital for shipmentthrough the Zone Gate there. I'm afraid they're in for a nasty shock this time.That body's linked to me. Everything they've done to it I've known, felt, justas if I were still in it. I've deliberately kept it alive and healing. When itcomes through the Gate, oh, almost any minute now if my timing's right… One of the hexes in the floor of the control room turned black, and a figure wassuddenly there, as if faded in. It was Nathan Brazil's own body, with long,wildy flowing hair and beard, lying stark naked on the floor.</p>
<p>The body stirred, sat up, and looked around, a very confused look on its face."What? Who…?" it asked in his voice, then saw Brazil in his native form andscrambled backward.</p>
<p>"Come on, Terry! We didn't go through all that together to be put off by looks,now, did we?"</p>
<p>The figure frowned, then got unsteadily to its feet, eyes on the pulsatingcreature. "You-you're-him! You are him!" Then, suddenly aware of the beard andother odd feelings, it said, "Or am I him? This is crazy!"</p>
<p>"You played around inside me before," Brazil reminded her. "Now we'll have tokeep you there for a little bit. Don't worry, it'll all work out." "Terry?" Gus said hesitantly. "Is that you in there? I mean, if it is, you cantalk!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I-what happened to me, anyway? I followed those signs into that swamp,and then there were these people, and then everything seemed to be all differentall of a sudden. I-I remember all of it, I think, but half of it doesn't makeany sense! Neither does this, for that matter!"</p>
<p>"I had a tough time figuring out the Glathrielian system," Brazil admitted. "Ifwe hadn't spent all that time together on the island, I might never have gottenit to the level where I could manage what I did. When that volcano blew and Igot conked by the tree keeping you from drowning, there was a moment when myhuman part and all of you merged inside that head. The only part of me that wasleft in your body was this, the part you could never reach. It took a couple ofweeks of healing in that hospital in Agon before my-our-brain began functioningwell enough that I reestablished contact and was able to sort us out. Now thatmy old brain, which repairs itself like the rest of the body, is functioningnormally, all that was you can use it. You're back, even if not quite as youwere."</p>
<p>"I, uh-" Terry reached down and shook his head. "I'll be damned. I alwayswondered what it felt like to have one of those."</p>
<p>Gus cleared his throat, which was a somewhat menacing sound although notintended that way. "Um, Terry. You remember this?"</p>
<p>He went over and looked down at the baby and smiled. "Yeah, I do. Whose is it,anyway? I'm not my own kid's father and mother, am I? That would be too much!" "No, I'm sterile. I have to be," Brazil assured her. "Remember your diversion atthe meteor back in the Amazon?"</p>
<p>"Oh, him! Damn! Still, he is cute. Let me hold him!"</p>
<p>"Gladly," Gus responded, handing over the child. "Um-do you remember me, Terry?" "Yeah. You could flip in and out, like, so folks couldn't see you. For a whileyou were my only real friend."</p>
<p>"Terry, that's Gus," Mavra told her. "I'm Alama, and that tall furry creaturewith the horn on his head is Lori."</p>
<p>Terry gasped. "Oh, my God! Gus? Lori?" He laughed, and it wasn't at all likeBrazil's laugh. If one knew both Terry and Nathan, one could see Terry in everymove and hear her in every spoken word. Finally, still gently cradling the baby,he said, "So we're all kind of scrambled up here, and we're all standing herebefore a talking turnip with tentacles and the queen of the Amazons. If I evergot this story on the air, they'd lock me up in an asylum."</p>
<p>"Well, that brings up our situation," Brazil said, finding even himself a bitdisconcerted talking to, well, himself. "We have four-actually, now five-peopleleft here, all of whom have problems. The child was born on the Well World to acreature who'd been processed. Because of the laws and limits of probability,the only way I could send you, Terry, and the baby back without making a realmess of things would be to Earth at a point in time after the gate closed. Ninemonths plus a few days, to be exact. As far as reality was concerned, you'd havespent the whole time as you'd originally planned, in the Amazon jungle with thePeople. That's the way the math runs here. Terry alone I could deal with in anyway I pleased, but the baby complicates it beyond belief. From your standpoint,you wouldn't have made that last jump. Instead, you would have stopped short.You wouldn't remember anything that's happened here, and you would have spentnine months with the People and had the baby with them."</p>
<p>"The baby's a boy, so you'd have to give it up to one of the regular tribes orleave the People," Mavra pointed out. "I'd leave," Terry said flatly. "I know." Brazil told her. "But you would never go back to civilization. You'djoin one of the tribes there, and both you and the boy would remain with them.You know that if you ever went back to civilization, you'd be a freak, aten-minute story for two or three days on your own old network, and then thatwould be that. You'd stay, you'd have many more children, and you'd grow oldwatching them grow up as members of the Amazonian tribe."</p>
<p>"That's not much of a future," Terry noted. "It's a choice. If you stay here,you'll be racially Glathrielian, but you won't be rewired again. What limitedpowers you can use without that, you will retain. Your baby will be safe, too.I'll see to that. I'm going to keep tinkering with that bunch until I get themright! But they've got a long way to go even to get beyond the Amazonian stagethemselves."</p>
<p>"You're saying it's jungle or swamp? My choice? Some choice!"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. I'm going to attempt something that is very, very difficulthere. I've never done it before, but there's no reason it can't be done. Infact, in theory it should be easier than most other things around here becauseit's built into the old mechanism. When we started off here, the hex attributeswere symmetrical. High-tech to semitech to nontech in repeating radial patterns.Over time, as races proved out, we moved them out to the worlds and built newraces that often required different limitations than the previous tenants. Overtime it became a jumbled mess like today. But the mechanism for switching themaround is still there, still accessible. The effect will be so unnoticed in mostplaces that it'll take some time to discover it's been done. Only one of themwill know right off, and it'll most likely destroy their current civilization.As far as I'm concerned, it's worth bringing them down a notch. Anyway, they'reclever people. They'll survive."</p>
<p>Mavra stared at him. "Nathan? What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>"After we make a few adjustments in the Glathrielian Way, ones that will startthem on a new track, I'm going to upgrade it from nontech to semitech. Sincedoing this would cause the Ambrezans to contemplate genocide, I'm going todowngrade the Ambrezan hex to semi-tech as well. By the time the Glathrieliansrise, the Ambrezans will have reworked their own system to adjust. They'reagriculturally based, anyway; they won't suffer in the long run from this." Hepaused a moment. "And I'm going to upgrade Erdom to high-tech." "What!" both Lori and Julian cried at once.</p>
<p>"The same lovable climate and people-changing that is a lot more complicated-butwith a major difference. And, oh, yes, it seems that there's going to be anepidemic there soon. It won't bother most people more than a bad cold. But itwon't be curable by partaking of the women's curative milk supply. It's going toinfest the males mostly, with their lack of natural immunities, but it's goingto find itself allergic to testosterone and related substances the males havenaturally. All, of course, except the castrated ones. I'm afraid it's going tobe very fatal to them very quickly."</p>
<p>"You-you're wiping out the priesthood!" Lori said, mouth agape. "I'm afraid so. They've kept that place in the dark too long. Now, if a coupleof people, one male, one female, maybe married so that they're sociallyacceptable, knew this and also knew that high-tech works there now, well, whowould be the only two there who really understand the new technology that willbe brought in? And what is needed? Who will have to be the founders of the firstuniversity of the new electronic age?.If you're sharp enough, and cleverenough, and work together on this, you might just pull it off. You might not,and things aren't going to change overnight, but they will change. You two wanta challenge?"</p>
<p>"It-it's more than we could hope for," Lori told him. From minor associateprofessor to founder of a new technological civilization. Not bad. "That's what I always went for," Julian told them. "Challenges. It sounds like abig one. I hope it's not too big."</p>
<p>"Well, these things seldom work out the way you plan, but sometimes they work.Give me a week and then check it out. I'll send you a little gizmo when I throwthe switch so you can know it's started."</p>
<p>Julian winked out, but Lori stayed. "What-where'd she go?"</p>
<p>"Suspended in transit. I wanted a word with you alone. When she emerges, she'sstill going to be that bombshell Kraang made her, but I've removed that stuffthat idiotic pair of butchers did to her head. You saw how he made that attitudeadjustment, too. I don't think Julian can ever completely conquer her ownegocentrism, not on her own. I decided the hell with it and did it for her. It'snice to be able to shortcut these things. She's going to be just as smart as sheever was-smarter, I think, than before- but she's going to forget that she everwas a man. She's going to find us males as inscrutable as every other female.And the next time she sees you, she's going to realize that she's maddeningly,passionately, completely in love with you. She won't question it or reflect onit as any sort of change: she'll realize it's been there all along. You, on theother hand, I want to remember your life as a woman, what it meant. You won'tever forget it again. You forgot it once, and it didn't help Julian's mentalhealth or your own. That race is the most sexually interdependent on thisplanet. Use it when you go about re-forming the system."</p>
<p>Lori stared at him. "Thank you," he said, and vanished. Mavra noddedapprovingly. "Well, you did that pretty well. I hate to put building a newsociety in the hands of two physics majors, but what the hell. I guess you workwith what you got."</p>
<p>"What about us?" Terry asked. "What happens to us?"</p>
<p>"You have the biggest job of all. Both of you." Brazil told them. "Gus, youremember what you told Kurdon? Bring in the press? Take all the pictures? Leteverybody see what this filth is all about?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I remember."</p>
<p>"Well, that's your job. Yours and Terry's, and others, from many races, if youdo a decent recruiting job. I'm sending you both-all three of you, actually-to aplace you haven't been. It's called Czill, and the creatures there are walking,talking plants. No kidding. But they have one great purpose-they've assembledthe most massive, highest-tech library and information resource on this planet.They're going to know you're coming-their computers will tell them. And they'regoing to know just what your job is going to be. The idea will be so fresh, sonew to them that they'll love it. They'll fall all over each other helping youget it going."</p>
<p>"Yeah? What…?" Gus asked, not really following.</p>
<p>"An independent news source. Printed where it has to be, broadcast where it canbe. Carried all over with the same speed and efficiency with which the carteldealt its poison. You've already got a few stories, including the hex changesand the cartel. You'll have more right off. A number of very high-rankingcouncillors are going to have serious health problems very soon, and some oftheir associates back home are going to suddenly find that there's a lot ofevidence in the open on just how corrupt they were. But that won't stop theevil. It'll flare up again in a different form. It's endemic. If everybody hereis a reflection of his or her creators, well, you've met the Kraang." "You mean a syndicate? A worldwide news organization?" Terry gasped. "And we'dbe running it?"</p>
<p>"That's right. And training others and sending the scholars from all the raceswho come to Czill to study back with the knowledge of what a free press can do.You two think you're ready for that kind of job?"</p>
<p>"Are you kidding?" Terry responded. "Jeez! From naked little twerp who couldn'teven talk to Ted Turner!" She turned to her old friend. "And with you rightthere, just like old times!"</p>
<p>"As much as the Dahir's talent for hiding is handy, I don't think being a Dahiris right for this job, though," Brazil continued. "If you can't go back toGlathriel, at least for a while, maybe it's better if you were a pair." "You mean I get to be me again?" Gus exclaimed. "Yeah!"</p>
<p>"Well, not quite. But if you don't like it, go through the Zone Gate in Czillany time in the next seven days and you'll be pretty much as you were born. Ifyou don't, then my revisions stick. Okay?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, I guess that's fair enough."</p>
<p>"Good luck, then. I'm counting on both of you. All of you! Oh-by the way,Dillia's not that far from Czill. You might check in with our friends there fromtime to time."</p>
<p>"Okay, we will. Hey! Wait!" Terry called. "I'm not gonna be a guy, am I?" "No, you'll be who you want to be. I promise. Farewell."</p>
<p>They winked out, and Nathan and Mavra were alone. "What did you do with them?"she asked him. He adjusted the program and put her back into the matrix. Almostimmediately she became a smaller version of him.</p>
<p>"At least the stool fits now," she said. She looked into the Well and traced Gusand Terry and the as yet unnamed child to Czill. "Wow! Gus is nothin' tocomplain about, is he? I may go to Czill myself!"</p>
<p>"You can't. The only way out for us is back out into the universe." "Oh, yeah. But where'd you get that stud's picture from?"</p>
<p>"Terry's mind. It's her idealized fantasy male."</p>
<p>"I see you didn't make her any different."</p>
<p>"No need. He loves her. She already is what he wants. Besides, she hasabsolutely no competition."</p>
<p>"You got that right." She sighed. "So here we are again, sitting here just likebefore, doling out happy endings like some fairy tale and solving all theproblems of the universe except our own."</p>
<p>"Seems like," he agreed.</p>
<p>"Nathan-you're remaking all sorts of parts of this world, but you keep puttingour universe back the same old way again."</p>
<p>"I can't help it. This world's easy. It was designed as a lab. All the controlsand instructions are available. But Mavra, I wouldn't have the first idea in thecosmos of how to rework something as complex as an entire planetary civilizationand ecosystem, let alone all of them. It took the whole damned race workingtogether with this thing to do that. I'm a button pusher. If I can push a buttonand do something or throw a switch or issue a command, that's fine. Even theKraang knew better than that. He was going to be god, but he needed disciples todo his dirty work."</p>
<p>She sighed. "I see. So it's back to that crummy old Earth again, is it? After wefix up a few more things here?"</p>
<p>"Pretty much. Now. we could go other places, of course, but there's no guaranteethey'd be any better. I tried it once, and it was worse, if you can believe it.Don't think about all that past, either. Where we'll be going they'll haveelectricity and aircraft and video and all sorts of stuff you haven't seen inages. It's still violent, and it's hardly close to perfect, but it'll do if youwatch your back. The same evil strain that shows up here sometimes shows upthere as well. Besides, it will be different this time in the long haul. TheKraang's interference seems to have caused some rifts in the usual probabilityprogram, at least for Earth, and I'm sure as hell not going to push the resetover that!"</p>
<p>"You mean-you don't know where things are going, either, this time?" "Not really. I was shocked at the changes in the Well World from last time. Yousaw those streamlined Dillians, for example, and many of the others were equallyrefined."</p>
<p>"Yeah, so?"</p>
<p>"They're evolving, Mavra. Changing. Becoming something newer, maybe better,maybe worse, but different. Even here change is coming. Back on Earth-well, I nolonger know the specifics, but in general things will work out. There'll bewars, and violence, and hatred, and drugs, and things we haven't even thought ofyet, but science is already on the fast track, technology is already runningwild. Eventually they'll pick up the pieces, put themselves together, and headout for the planets and then the stars. They have to. It may take a while, butwe'll be a little more comfortable getting there. They already have womencaptains of aircraft, so you've got some potential right off. It's no more orless dangerous or risky than it was, but it's a damn sight more comfortable atthis stage."</p>
<p>She sighed. "Well, okay, maybe. At least we can play for another tie, huh?Accelerated change, everything, everywhere, even here. Everything and everybodybut us and this big old machine."</p>
<p>"Well, somebody's got to be around to appreciate it. That's what's so damnedwrong with all this, all this time, I think. The worst possible sin happened tome long ago, and I just couldn't deal with it."</p>
<p>"The loneliness?"</p>
<p>"No, even worse. This endless, unchanging perspective turned me from an artistinto a damned art critic!"</p>
<p>She laughed. "You never told me what you did with Campos. I'm going to see."</p>

<p>JUANA CAMPOS WOKE UP AS IF FROM A DREAM AND SHOOK HER head as if to clear it.She suddenly remembered what had happened and started, then sat up and checkedherself.</p>
<p>She was still female, but she was human again! And, well, if she had to be awoman, what a body! This figure was a killer; she knew that without having toexamine it further.</p>
<p>She felt her face, and it seemed normal, too, not horrible or disfigured. Herskin was smooth but copper-colored, and it looked rather nice. She got up, still puzzled that Brazil would have made her like this and lookingfor the snake. There could be one here, that was for sure. It was jungle, denseand deep, much like back home.</p>
<p>She walked on a little way and then stopped and gasped. It was home! There wasthe airstrip over there! And there the house where, as Juan Campos, she'd beenborn!</p>
<p>A truck full of her father's men roared toward the back end of the airstrip,when somebody looked over in her direction and shouted. The truck stopped atonce, and suddenly they were all piling out, staring at her.</p>
<p>"Ai! Would you look at that?'</p>
<p>"That is the most stacked Indian bitch I ever seen!"</p>
<p>"I think I'm in love!</p>
<p>She didn't turn. She knew them all. Pablo, and Carlo, and Juan Pedro, and PipitoAlvarez…</p>
<p>She started to shout to them, to tell them she was not what she seemed, but whenshe opened her mouth, nothing came out! She tried again to shout, to talk, tomake any sort of sound, and she couldn't do it! She was mute!</p>
<p>They started coming toward her, leering.</p>
<p>Writing. Maybe something, anything! But how? And what to write? How did it go,anyway? She couldn't remember!</p>
<p>They were still coming, and now Carlo started into a running trot and the othersfollowed. No! No.' I'm Juan Campos, you fools! she wanted to shout, but nothingcame, nothing at all.</p>
<p>Suddenly she was filled with panic. She turned and started to run back into theforest, back to where she could hide.</p>
<p>But she'd waited too long. They were too close, and she knew it. They already had their pants off by the time they caught her, and they took anawfully long time, before they picked her up and took her back toward thecompound, exhausted, bleeding, and nearly unconscious.</p>
<p>Hell, this bitch was good for the whole damned bunch of campaneros! With alittle more seasoning and discipline, why, she might last for monthsl DonFrancisco wouldn't mind. The only danger was that the old boy might take her forhimself!</p>

<p>The Beach Near Cannes</p>
</title>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mavra Chang came our of the water, happy but Exhausted, and looked around forBrazil. It wasn't great yet, but this was definitely more like it! And with thefilm festival only three weeks away, she could look forward to some real glamouraround.</p>
<p>She spotted Brazil and still had to chuckle. Nathan Brazil, infallible god,provider of happy-ever-after endings, always the same old stick-in-the-mudhimself. Wise as Solomon, ancient as history itself, always confident. For the first time in his five-plus billion-year life the great man had goofed.A minor goof to be sure, but from her standpoint an absolutely perfect one. They'd spent the week redoing the hexes, adjusting, tinkering, fine-tuning,trying to think of every little detail that they actually could do somethingabout. They'd taken several days to check it out and run simulations to ensurethat they'd gotten it right.</p>
<p>Nathan had even remembered to send Lori the sleek, motorized camera and reflecting telescope.</p>
<p>Everything was just right. The Glathrielians were set on a new course with afine subtlety, the Ambrezans were going absolutely bananas but they'd ensuredthat nobody would starve or die when all their high-tech stuff just stopped, andGus, who had not chosen to revert to form during his week's trial-and littlewonder-was settling in with Terry and little Nathan, a touch Brazil had loved. And finally, they'd gone down to the exit gate and set the positions and theprobability adjustments so that they would have real identities when theymaterialized back on Earth in their base forms. Brazil had already stayed toolong as the Egyptian David Solomon, so he'd specified that a new identity becreated consistent with his base form and relative to Mavra, who, not wanting tobecome a jungle goddess again, was getting an extensive identity makeover. Itwas so automatic, he just did it without thinking, issuing the bare minimumcommands needed to accomplish the goal.</p>
<p>"Well," said Nathan Brazil, "that's about it. We're actually in pretty fairshape, although it's interesting that the Kraang's interference has put us on awhole new historical track. Endless possibilities this time. Should be kind offun. No resets necessary, I guess. Not this time. Just go back, pick up living,see how it all comes out. You ready?"</p>
<p>Mavra Chang sighed. "I still haven't seen much to like on that little dirt ball,but I'm open to persuasion. All right, Nathan. I think I like you better as ahuman, anyway; you're a lot less like some pontificating god. I almost wishsometime you'd make a mistake. Not a big mistake, mind, but some mistake. Justenough to take a little of the wind out of those sails."</p>
<p>Nathan Brazil chuckled. "Let's go home, Mavra."</p>
<p>"Computer: open Well transfer type forty-one to native mode. Reset Watchers toprior human form but create new identities this timeline and insert subjects…now!"</p>
<p>Just one little detail…</p>
<p>While Nathan had remade his old, now mortal body into the image of Terry, he'dforgotten that he was still inside the real Terry's body. The Well had simplytaken this rather than the old form as the default, since all shapes, forms,races, and creatures were all the same to it, and Brazil's own instructions forinsertion had been to revert them to their "prior human form." And so Nathan Brazil had rematerialized back on Earth not as his eternal oldself but rather as a dead ringer for Terry Sanchez, stretch marks and all. Andhe'd be stuck as a she, and looking precisely that way, until they had to travelback to the Well World once more and could get inside.</p>
<p>Although startled, Mavra was more than pleased to see her wish granted soquickly. It wasn't necessarily permanent, of course; all Brazil had to do was goback into the Well and change things. That, however, was easier said than done;once in Watcher mode, travel to the Well World was at the convenience not of theWatchers but of the Well. It had taken thousands of years for it to need eitherof them the last time. Who could know how long it might take again? In the meantime, although she was sorry Nathan couldn't experience the morenegative side of being female in ancient times as she had, Brazil would sure ashell have a very different life for quite a while, and into a future that wasnot as certain as before.</p>
<p>It almost made Brazil bearable this time. Mavra thought they might stay togetherfor a while, maybe a very long while, this time, now that Nathan would have ataste of her side of life. In the meantime, Brazil was already struggling toadapt, but given enough time, she would get used to it. She'd already played therole to perfection, after all. And, she'd noted, there was a bright side. Whenthey came through again at last, nobody would be looking for a big-breastedbrown woman whose documents said she was Danielle Brazza of West Palm Beach,Florida, USA, just as Mavra Chang was now from a city called San Francisco thatshe'd never really heard of in a country she'd yet to visit. Next time should bea piece of cake.</p>
<p>And she had a very, very long time to practice…</p>

<p>A Dead World in the Constellation Andromeda</p>

<p>The Kraang had realized the trap the moment he'd stepped into it, but by then itwas too late.</p>
<p>He went out regularly and just stared at the Well Gate, which opened and closedwith monotonous regularity whenever he approached, as if inviting him to come onin.</p>
<p>It wasn't awful here; the internal planetary computer was rusty, but it stillworked, at least on the limited basis that the Kraang needed for hisrequirements.</p>
<p>But it was a dead, silent world, offering only regrets and memories. Somehow I'll do it! the Kraang swore. I will survive here as long as I must! Aslong as the universe survives, I will be here, building my hatred, plotting myrevenge! One day, one day, I will find the way out! One day, someone will come,or something will occur, to liberate me again! Then, my old nemesis, then wewill see who is the better!</p>
<p>But only the darkness, and the memories, and the aching loneliness heard hiscries or felt his rage.</p>
<p>He was God! Absolute ruler!</p>
<p>God of loneliness!</p>
<p>God of the dark.</p>
