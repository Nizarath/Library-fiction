   <p><strong>Men groaned</strong> or wept, were silent or cursed fate, as was in keeping with their nature. The man in the gray hooded robe watched. It had taken some time to find those he had been seeking, but once he had found them, things had proceeded quickly.</p>
   <p>Oddly enough, his search had been hampered by the fact that Spriacos was a human world, far enough off major trading lanes that few aliens bothered to visit. Without significant industry, no exports more valuable than bulk metals and processed foodstuffs, and no tourist attractions due to no indigenous sapients occupying the world before the Empire claimed it, there was little anyone wished to see here. The hooded man had seen one Wodenite, a few Tigeries, and a pair of Donarrian iron traders. Otherwise, Spiracos was a place one came to catch another ship to somewhere else.</p>
   <p>Still, the Empire’s business had brought the hooded man to Tanhis, the capital city, seeking a man. In the end, he had found his man, wrung the truth from him, and was about to depart when another band of unlikely visitors to Spiracos had come to his attention; a slaver crew pillaging the Pits, as the poorest quarter of the city was known. Bordering massive mining pits, the Pits was home to day laborers, gambling halls, and strip clubs, a place where a man could find any vice he sought if he had the price.</p>
   <p>“Celia, how are you receiving?” the hooded man asked sub-vocally. A pair of clicks in his ear told him that he was being received five-by-five. A tiny transmitter sewn into the hood broadcast on a sub-carrier to the ship in orbit above. Even if the encrypted message was received and decoded, it would have appeared to be only a mercantile communication unless one could determine which of the fifty subcarriers embedded in the signal was transmitting the real data.</p>
   <p>Sir Dominic Flandry, Agent of the Terran Empire, considered it something of a technological overkill, but he conceded that the gadgets Special Branch’s researchers cobbled together for him always worked, so he choose not to be a critic. He leaned back against the rear wall, part of the concrete foundation of the building, and took stock of his surroundings.</p>
   <p>The cell was beyond filthy, a thirty-foot square of bare earth in the basement of an abandoned warehouse, defined by three walls of iron bars and the concrete against which he rested. Flandry had quickly ascertained that the simple cage wasn’t bolted to the floor or ceiling; the two side walls were bolted to an ancient cinder block wall. Men were packed so closely that no one could move without jostling someone else, but so universal was the misery that there were only faint complaints at the discomfort.</p>
   <p>The warehouse was otherwise empty, a single double door in the opposite wall leading up to the surface. The guards who had herded Flandry and the others into the cage earlier that night had vanished back through those doors, leaving the prisoners unguarded. It was a safe bet; they had all been searched and anything resembling a weapon or potential tool had been confiscated.</p>
   <p>Flandry had already calculated the risk from the guards and decided that it all depended on timing; they were lax, as they counted their job already completed, even though the prisoners were still under their supervision. Flandry suspected that they would soon be moved. No water or food had been provided, but slavers were disinclined to diminish the worth of their inventory, so transportation soon was the most likely answer. Once on the ship, they would be given food and water certain to be dosed with drugs to render the slaves docile; if they were to escape, it would have to be before they were taken off-world.</p>
   <p>Flandry knew that he could be extracted with a single word—Celia had already alerted local police to stand by—but that would likely involve a great many casualties, and while he had no compunctions seeing the guilty instantly killed when needed, he had qualms about unnecessary collateral damage; it was inelegant.</p>
   <p>Flandry studied those around him, trying to determine who he needed to talk to first. Two men were possibilities. One appeared to be moving from despair to anger, and soon a mindless outburst of rage might bring unwelcome attention from the guards. He might be an asset, but he might also prove a dangerous liability, Flandry finally judged.</p>
   <p>He turned his attention to the second man, and saw in him a likely candidate as the natural leader in this group. He was calm, studying the surroundings and the other men, constantly recalculating his chances to change circumstances rather than merely giving in to hopelessness. For a brief second, his gaze met the hooded man’s and in that instant each acknowledged in the other someone of like mind.</p>
   <p>Rising, Flandry moved as best he could through the press, gaining rising complaint and curses for his efforts, but he reached the man he had been studying without anyone objecting violently. Softly, he asked, “You ready to fight?”</p>
   <p>The other man spared him a glance, then nodded once. “What are you called?”</p>
   <p>The hooded man threw back his hood and said, “Flandry.”</p>
   <p>Absent the hood, Flandry’s features were strong. Dark eyes that in brighter light would have revealed flecks of amber, dark hair cut short in military fashion, a determined expression that immediately communicated this was a dangerous man.</p>
   <p>“I’m Laren,” said the other man; he was of like height, well muscled and fit, despite being older. His leathery face and gray hair did nothing to diminish Flandry’s estimation of him.</p>
   <p>“You’re not from Spiracos?”</p>
   <p>“Off-world,” Flandry answered.</p>
   <p>“How did an off-worlder end up in the Pits, getting caught up in a slaver raid?”</p>
   <p>“It took a bit of doing,” he said. Raising his voice just enough to be heard by the other men in the cell, he spoke. “Listen. I’ll only say this once. This man, Laren,” He glanced at the man next to him, “and I, we are going to fight.”</p>
   <p>Instantly there came muttering and objections.</p>
   <p>“Shut up!” Flandry said, not loud but forcefully enough to silence the men. “These are Alcaz Slavers. Some of you have been here for only hours, others no more than two days. Their style is grab and dash, quickly culling brothels, gambling halls, and bars, and away again to avoid detection by local police. They are in and out swiftly, and once you’re chained in the hold of a cargo ship, your life will never again be your own. This is your last hope for freedom. They will kill you if need be. But you are of no value to them dead or severely damaged, so they will hesitate in that killing, and that hesitancy will be your salvation.</p>
   <p>“If you act quickly, you will win freedom, be home in a few hours with your families.” With a wry smile he said, “Some of you might be back at work by morning. I’m asking you to risk pain and injury now, to avoid dying in the games on Ashula or the mines on Peridan. The choice is yours.”</p>
   <p>“What do we do?” asked a man in the far corner.</p>
   <p>“Watch the stairs and if you see any movement, let me know.”</p>
   <p>Flandry moved to one corner of the cage most removed from the stairs and said, “Two fasteners.” He tore at the hem of his cloak and produced a small tool. A white hot flame jetted out and he cut through a restraining bolt above his head. “Don’t touch this cage until I tell you.” He knelt and cut partially through the lower fastener. He moved quickly through the press to the opposite junction and cut the top fastener and halfway through the lower. “Now, anyone knocks this over before we’re ready and I’ll kill him.</p>
   <p>“Wait until I act, then hit these bars hard. Any guards left standing, swarm them. Some of you will be hurt, but you’ll survive shock sticks and clubs. Keep them from unholstering their weapons.”</p>
   <p>“But—” began another man.</p>
   <p>“Shut up,” returned Flandry. “We are doing this. Help or get out of the way, but if you help, we all stand a better chance.”</p>
   <p>Three rapid clicks sounded in Flandry’s ear, followed by another three. That was Celia’s unofficial code for, “Are you crazy?” and he chose to ignore it.</p>
   <p>The prisoners returned to quiet as the far doors opened and two guards appeared at the bottom of the stairs. They moved lazily towards the crouching men, who remained silent. One reached out and wiggled the cage door, testing the lock, and Flandry prayed to whatever gods of hopelessness might be attending him that the iron cage didn’t fall apart.</p>
   <p>One prisoner begged, “Please, I have a family.”</p>
   <p>“No talking!” shouted the guard in heavily accented Terran, then paused a moment, seeing nothing more than what he expected, and left.</p>
   <p>Spiracos was a fringe world, but located at a trading nexus that was more useful than vital. It was therefore constantly verging on being important, yet never quite reaching industrial, financial, or political critical mass. It was predominately human, with the occasional sapient from other races, but save for a slightly lower gravity and two moons, could have been a twin of ancient Terra.</p>
   <p>Reaching up to the seam of his robe where right shoulder met hood, he pressed a tiny bead and whispered, “Ready?”</p>
   <p>A faint voice in his ear answered, “Standing by.”</p>
   <p>Raising his voice again, just enough for the other prisoners to hear, he said, “Be ready. Act as beaten dogs until I move.”</p>
   <p>Flandry hoped he had driven home the point; he had little concern for his own safety, but he had a mission, and turning this slave raid on its ear was proving to be exactly the vehicle for completing his mission. Turning to Laren, he said, “Can I count on you?”</p>
   <p>The man returned a half-smile and nod and Flandry knew that his instincts were serving him again. “Military?” Laren looked like a veteran. His hair was shot through with gray, but his eyes were clear blue, and he had a hard edge to him that came from more than years of laboring.</p>
   <p>“Conscripted at eighteen,” he said. “Second Marines LURPS.”</p>
   <p>Flandry couldn’t have been more pleased. Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol members were resourceful, deadly, not particularly battle-happy, and as difficult to kill as a cockroach. “Early out?”</p>
   <p>“Lost a leg at Vindabar to a Merseian sniper. The Empire gratefully grew me another, but by then the war was declared over and I was given a bonus and cut loose. Apparently, they didn’t need someone whose only skill was being a sneaky bastard behind enemy lines.” He looked into Flandry’s eyes a moment, then said, “You?”</p>
   <p>“I’m with the IG.”</p>
   <p>Wide-eyed shock was followed moments later by a broad grin. “Deputy Inspector General? Here?”</p>
   <p>“Long story. I’ll tell you more after we get out of here.” He reached up and activated his com and asked, “Anything?”</p>
   <p>“Just about to contact you. Heavy transport dropping out of orbit above your location. No chatter with planetary approach control, so they’re definitely off the books.”</p>
   <p>“Someone was bribed,” agreed Flandry. “Let me know when you see shuttles coming down, then wait for my signal.”</p>
   <p>“About five minutes.” The com fell silent.</p>
   <p>Laren said, “You have people outside.” It wasn’t a question. “How many?”</p>
   <p>“Enough.”</p>
   <p>The distant sound of heavy engines came faintly through the heavy walls of the underground pen. What had originally been housed in this warehouse was unknown, but it made an ideal location for human traffickers to keep their prisoners for transport off-world.</p>
   <p>A dull thud announced the landing of the shuttle. Flandry guessed that it was a probably an old military transport, given the number of slaves they wished to move. He idly wondered where the female slaves were being held, but assumed they’d be moved by a different craft. It was academic; if things went according to plan, he’d soon find them and cut them loose.</p>
   <p>When he heard the sound of boots coming down the stairs, he whispered, “Soon!”</p>
   <p>Five slavers appeared at the bottom of the stairs, and crossed the room. Four took up equally spaced positions behind the one with the key to the cage. All were dressed as civilians, but, with a slight nod to Laren, Flandry identified the two on the left as former military. Their stance and the alertness in their eyes was in stark contrast to the almost bored expressions and lax behavior of the other three. Laren nodded in return and with a slight motion of his head indicated he’d go after the left-most guard.</p>
   <p>Flandry waited. He gently reached out and tugged slightly on Laren’s arm, signaling the need to hang back and be among the last out of the cage. He needed as much chaos as possible before they struck.</p>
   <p>The first guard reached the cell door, his hand dropping to a nasty-looking shock-stick at his belt. Flandry assumed its original purpose was directing livestock, then conceded that, from the slavers point of view, it was <emphasis>still</emphasis> being used to direct livestock. “I open door, then you come out! Slowly!” he shouted in a heavily accented Terran.</p>
   <p>Flandry reached up to his com unit and whispered, “Now!”</p>
   <p>Within seconds, all five guards looked startled as they received a message from above: a Terran Imperial Heavy Cruiser had just dropped out of FTL into a high orbit above the cargo ship, flanked by two smaller ships, probably Fast Frigates or Heavy Destroyers from their energy signatures.</p>
   <p>The guard closest to Flandry glanced away to see how those behind were reacting to the warning. Flandry shouted, “Now!”</p>
   <p>Every man in the front hit the cage wall, and, after a brief hesitation, it gave way; the first guard was crushed under the metal and the charging men, his cries of pain stilled within seconds.</p>
   <p>Without hesitation, Flandry took a direct path straight at the second guard on the left, launching himself into a flying kick that caught the man on the point of the jaw, spinning him completely around. Kneeling next to the prone, stunned guard, Flandry drove his fingers into the man’s windpipe. The man gasped as he brought his hands up to his throat, his eyes widening as he suddenly was without breath. Flandry reached down and deftly unholstered the man’s sidearm and pulled it out. He thumbed off the safety and shot the guard in the chest.</p>
   <p>Laren’s guard took a step towards Flandry, and the former Marine jumped forward, wrapping his left arm around the man’s neck, while kicking backward with one foot against the guard’s leg. He took him down with a sudden kneeling motion, savagely smashing the guard’s head against the stone floor. The sound was lost in the sudden upheaval as the other prisoners swarmed the two remaining guards. Insuring that the man stayed down, Laren rose and crushed the guard’s throat with his boot heel.</p>
   <p>The noise of discharging shock-sticks and men screaming in pain punctuated angry shouts and the sound of fists meeting flesh. Flandry was efficiency personified. He dodged through the melee, which was now firmly in hand.</p>
   <p>The other guards were already down, being kicked to death by the prisoners. Flandry pushed quickly through the prisoners and ruthlessly shot both in the head. He considered that he was doing them a favor.</p>
   <p>Flandry said, “Everyone wait here until we see who is left above ground. Who has military training?”</p>
   <p>Four men held up their hands and Flandry instructed the first three to pick up the dead guards’ remaining weapons.</p>
   <p>He motioned for them to fall in behind him and headed up the steps to the surface, slowly, not wanting unpleasant surprises. He saw two men, technicians from their garb, lingering by the open cargo hold of the shuttle. It would have been a cramped ride for that many men, Flandry thought, as he walked straight towards the two men. The first one to notice him looked surprised, but by the time he was able to speak, Flandry had his pistol leveled at the man’s nose. “How many?” he asked.</p>
   <p>The other technician was slow to realize that this wasn’t a guard returning to start loading prisoners, and his hesitation cost him a blow to the side of the head that dropped him to his knees. “How many?” repeated Flandry to the other tech.</p>
   <p>“One inside and the pilot,” answered the second technician. For his troubles, he was rewarded with a blow that dropped him unconscious to the dirt. Flandry then kicked the first tech in the point of the jaw.</p>
   <p>Flandry took one step into the light cast by the open hatch and shot the remaining guard. He hurried up to the small flight deck and put his gun barrel against the pilot’s neck. The pilot was smart enough to know not to move. He slowly raised his hands.</p>
   <p>“You got the message?”</p>
   <p>“Imperial heavy cruiser and two escorts in orbit, yes,” said the pilot.</p>
   <p>“What are your orders?”</p>
   <p>“To stay here, and, if the ship is taken, it’s every man for himself.”</p>
   <p>“Not a lot of loyalty.”</p>
   <p>“I’m not from Alcaz. I’m just a pilot.”</p>
   <p>“Well then, just a pilot, squawk on the emergency band and wait here until the police come and find you.”</p>
   <p>The pilot reached out and punched a large red button to his left and sat back with a sigh. The tower would notify police security of an emergency squawk from a vehicle parked where it shouldn’t be. He shook his head as he glanced up. He didn’t have to be told that the ship orbiting above them could blow him to vapor at will. Better a stint in prison than instant obliteration.</p>
   <p>“Women?” asked Flandry.</p>
   <p>“None this trip. Men for the mines and arena only.”</p>
   <p>Flandry motioned for him to get out of the chair and follow him. When they reached the two unconscious technicians, the pilot asked, “Guards?”</p>
   <p>“Dead.” With a wave of his pistol, Flandry said, “Sit.”</p>
   <p>The pilot complied, knowing that there was nowhere to run.</p>
   <p>Flandry returned to the steps and shouted, “It’s all clear.”</p>
   <p>Laren nodded, hurried down the basement stairs, then led the others to the surface. When all the slaves were above ground, Flandry said, “I expect that some of you would just as soon be gone before the police arrive. Go now.” Instantly, a dozen men started moving towards various exit routes from this old sector of the city. “The rest of you would probably be served by waiting. There’s a bounty on Alcaz slavers in the Empire, and if the police aren’t too corrupt, you’ll get your reward. If they <emphasis>are</emphasis> corrupt . . . just tell them you were freed by agents of the Inspector General’s Corp and that we’re still around.”</p>
   <p>The result was instantaneous. The men started to ask questions, but Flandry cut them off with a wave of his hand.</p>
   <p>“Laren, come with me,” he said and moved away from the warehouse and shuttle.</p>
   <p>When he was a hundred yards away from the group, he asked the former Marine, “What do you do for work?”</p>
   <p>“I was running a gang—work gang—out of the harbor, labor and repair. Had twenty five boys loading and unloading cargo, doing ship refitting, anything that paid and wasn’t illegal”—seeing a skeptical expression on Flandry, he added—“too illegal. I’ve had a nice little shop for about ten years.”</p>
   <p>“How’d you end up here?”</p>
   <p>“My son got married; after the bride and groom went off on their honeymoon, me and some of the boys went out drinking. I wandered off to take a piss behind the bar and someone hit me from behind. I woke up here.” He glanced around. “I expect that most of the boys at the party think I went home.” He glanced at the sky, still hours before dawn. “I’ll be expected at the shop an hour after sunrise. An hour after that, my boys will come looking for me.” He looked at Flandry and said, “Hell of a night.”</p>
   <p>“It’s not over,” said Flandry. He activated his com and said, “Send it down.”</p>
   <p>Turning to Laren, he said, “I have a job for you.”</p>
   <p>“Already got a job,” said Laren. “I owe you and if I can help I will, but my crew needs me.”</p>
   <p>“The Empire needs you,” said Flandry. “Consider your military service reactivated. If you want the paperwork, I can have it for you in an hour.”</p>
   <p>Laren’s expression remained neutral, but Flandry could see from the set of his eyes that he was not happy with what he had just heard. “What was your rank,” asked the Deputy Inspector General.</p>
   <p>“I’d just made sergeant before Vindabar.”</p>
   <p>“That will do for now, Sergeant.” He keyed his com and asked, “You got that?”</p>
   <p>“What size?” asked the voice in his ear.</p>
   <p>“Bigger than me by a little.”</p>
   <p>“Got one in back that will fit.”</p>
   <p>Flandry cocked his head slightly, then smiled at Laren. “Relax, Sergeant; I’m only going to need you for an hour or so. After that, we’ll discuss some things.”</p>
   <p>A few minutes later, a high-pitched humming signaled the approach of two fast police cruisers. “Wait here,” said Flandry.</p>
   <p>He hurried over to intercept the first cruiser as it touched down next to the transport. The door opened and two police officers stepped down as Flandry held up his identification. After a moment of conversation, their body language signaled the change in attitude of the two officers. They lost their aggressive stance and became deferential to the point of almost falling over themselves. Flandry returned to where Laren stood, saying, “The boys will be rewarded for their trouble.”</p>
   <p>Dryly, Laren said, “We don’t get our share?”</p>
   <p>“Not to worry,” replied Flandry with a slightly crooked smile. “You’ll be taken care of, Sergeant.”</p>
   <p>“One hour or so of a sergeant’s pay . . . that might cover the price of a drink . . . ”</p>
   <p>A moment later, a deeper humming from above heralded the approach of a small shuttle. It was a shining new beauty, the best the Empire had produced, exactly what you’d expect to ferry high-ranking officials and officers of the Empire to and from capital-class ships.</p>
   <p>The port side hatch dropped down, forming steps up a ramp to the shuttle. A young woman in the uniform of a Naval Ensign stepped out and saluted as Flandry hurried to the entrance. He absently returned the salute and said, “This is Sergeant Laren. Get us up!”</p>
   <p>She followed the two men into the ship and indicated that Laren should sit in the rear leftmost seat, just before a doorway into the rear cargo area. She sat in the pilot’s seat and took the shuttle up while Flandry entered the cargo area. “Where to, sir?” she shouted.</p>
   <p>From within the hold, he said, “Head for the Governor’s Complex.”</p>
   <p>“Aye, sir.”</p>
   <p>The shuttle arched into the sky, heading eastward, toward the rising sun. It would be just after breakfast when they reached the capital.</p>
   <p>Flandry emerged from the rear of the shuttle, and Laren saw him clean-shaven and looking fresh, wearing a spotless and smartly fitting service uniform, the traditional khaki worn by all navy ranks when not in full dress or fatigues. As he sat, he said to Laren, “There’s a sonic shower back there and a set of service fatigues that should fit you.”</p>
   <p>Laren didn’t need to be told twice. Less than fifteen minutes later, he emerged cleaner than he had been in two days, in a service fatigue uniform.</p>
   <p>Flandry nodded once in approval. “As there are no non-commissioned ranks in the Intelligence Corp, you’ve been promoted. So you jump a couple of pay grades. An ensign’s pay for an hour or so should buy <emphasis>two</emphasis> rounds.”</p>
   <p>Laren could only smile.</p>
   <p>Flandry motioned for him to sit. “I don’t have much time. As I said, you’re only working for me for an hour or so. I am not really going to press you into service. I just needed you aboard to talk.”</p>
   <p>“You just could have asked.”</p>
   <p>“You might have said no,” said Flandry with a faint smile.</p>
   <p>Nodding once, Laren said, “You’re right.”</p>
   <p>“How would you like to work for me?”</p>
   <p>“Doing what?”</p>
   <p>“This cold war we’re in with the Merseians is as deadly in its own fashion as the old shooting war was, just with not as high a body count, not as many things get blown up.”</p>
   <p>“That’s a good thing, I guess.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe,” said Flandry. “Time was, you’d have never heard of Alcaz slavers in this sector, let alone see them boots on ground, taking citizens for bounty.”</p>
   <p>“Time was, there was an Imperial fleet guarding this sector,” said Laren. “The regional militia is a joke and the planetary police are worse. Seems like the Empire has cut back on a few things.”</p>
   <p>Wryly, Flandry laughed. “True. Still, we’re attempting to set things right as best we can. And we need reliable men.”</p>
   <p>“We just met in a slavers pen, Deputy Inspector General Dominic Flandry,” said Laren.</p>
   <p>“Flandry will do.”</p>
   <p>“You know I’m reliable in a brawl, but what else do you know?”</p>
   <p>“Not much, but I don’t have time to conduct interviews and run deep background checks. Still, Imperial Marines means that you’re tough—and LURPS means that you’re self-reliant and able to improvise when needed. I’ve seen you fight; running your own business means that you’re not stupid. Having a boy who just got married means that you’re stable. I’ll have a full background check run on you before we’re done, but unless something seriously felonious comes up, I’m going to offer you a position.</p>
   <p>“The IG’s office needs someone here, and if you do the job, you’ll be paid very well. Enough so you can turn your business over to your son as a wedding present, and retire in due course on an officer’s pension, at least commander, perhaps even captain. If you don’t do it well, I’ll replace you. If you go rogue or corrupt, I’ll come back, shoot you, and then replace you.”</p>
   <p>“You’re not joking,” said Laren.</p>
   <p>“I don’t joke. Ask my friends.”</p>
   <p>From her seat, the pilot said, “Respectfully, sir, you don’t have any friends. But I can tell you, Ensign, he doesn’t joke.”</p>
   <p>Laren sat back to think a long moment, then said, “Well, I was going to give my son half the business when he returns from his honeymoon. All of it is better. I guess he can run things while I run errands for you, sir.”</p>
   <p>“It’s a little more than that, but we’ll get into details later.”</p>
   <p>“Governor’s complex ahead, sir,” said the pilot.</p>
   <p>“Thank you, Celia.”</p>
   <p>Flandry stood up and opened an overhead locker, removing a side arm. “Energy or slug?”</p>
   <p>“Pistol. LURPS don’t use blasters. They’re fine for urban fighting, but in the wild tend to set things on fire at the worst possible moment.”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” said Flandry, feeling that he should he anticipated the answer.</p>
   <p>He handed him a brand new semi-automatic pistol and holster, which Laren wrapped around his waist as the shuttle landed in the quad. Broadcasting Imperial Navy codes had cleared the air around the plaza of police interceptors, but there were still armed guards waiting just in case someone was threatening the governor or the legislature.</p>
   <p>Flandry strode out of the shuttle, Laren a half-step behind, and went to the guard who was sporting officer’s insignias on the shoulder of his battle armor, and held out his identification.</p>
   <p>He allowed him five seconds to take in what was occurring then said, “Have your men fall in behind me, Captain.”</p>
   <p>The captain said, “Yes, sir!” snapped off a salute, then shouted at the encircling guardsmen, “Fall in behind the Deputy Inspector General!”</p>
   <p>Twenty heavily armed men quickly formed up and moved out at double-time as Flandry and Laren were already twenty yards ahead. When the squad caught up, Flandry said, “Captain, all units in the capital are now under full Imperial Control. My aide is sending a copy of my mandate to your headquarters. I’ll have your chief confirm it before we get inside.”</p>
   <p>In less than two minutes, the captain said, “Your Imperial mandate received and acknowledged, sir.”</p>
   <p>As they reached the entrance of the Governor’s Complex, two sentries, seeing an Imperial officer’s uniform, snapped to attention, and remained that way until after the Captain of the Guard and his detachment passed.</p>
   <p>It took Flandry only five minutes to conduct his business. He moved to the office of the governor and marched past a startled secretary and pushed open the doors. The governor waited behind his desk for a report from his guard on the Imperial shuttle which had just landed. His companion was a stunning-looking young woman, which Flandry assumed meant that she was his very personal assistant. Before a word could be said, Flandry unholstered his sidearm and shot the governor between the eyes.</p>
   <p>The young woman was too petrified by terror to scream, though the secretary outside more than made up for that in volume. To the trembling assistant, Flandry said, “You’re a very pretty girl. There are several not-too-tawdry strip bars down in the Pits that I’m sure would hire you. It’s far less demeaning work that what you’ve been doing here. Now go.”</p>
   <p>The trembling girl needed no further urging and vanished down the hallway.</p>
   <p>Flandry turned to Laren. “You have a problem with what just happened?”</p>
   <p>The former marine said, “Either you had proof of his corruption or you’re trying to make a point. Either way, I doubt you need or want my approval.”</p>
   <p>“Smart man,” said Flandry. Putting away his side arm he turned to the captain who had just arrived. “Inform the lieutenant governor that he’s now the governor. And this is Lieutenant Laren . . . ?”</p>
   <p>“Ochinko.”</p>
   <p>“He’s now the official representative of the Inspector General on Spiracos. Any questions?”</p>
   <p>“Ah . . . no sir.”</p>
   <p>“Good, now find him an office.”</p>
   <p>Flandry turned, and it was clear that he was leaving. Laren said, “Lieutenant?”</p>
   <p>“You just got bumped another two pay grades. Lieutenant is the lowest field grade in the IG’s office.”</p>
   <p>Laren nodded, slightly amused. “Such rapid advancement should be a recruiting aid.” He lost his smile. “How do I reach you?”</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry. The IG’s office will be keeping an eye on things. Spiracos is still too far outside the core systems for a full garrison, but it’s now again under Imperial control. Sector militia answer to you, but keep an eye on the new governor and local police. A slave ship doesn’t pull into orbit without a number of key people looking the other way.”</p>
   <p>Flandry pointed at Laren for emphasis. “You will receive communications when we need to reach you, and you’re expected to file a report every six months. If you have a problem, deal with it; if it’s too big for you, I hired the wrong man.”</p>
   <p>Five minutes later, Flandry was sitting next to the pilot of the shuttle as it lifted off.</p>
   <p>“How did it go?” asked the young woman as she punched in coordinates.</p>
   <p>“Better than expected. I think I may have found an honest man for the job.”</p>
   <p>“That’s refreshing.”</p>
   <p>“And, by the way, I didn’t appreciate that little bit of snideness about friends.”</p>
   <p>“Sorry, Daddy.”</p>
   <p>“Better get started,” he said. “It’s going to be a long flight home.”</p>
   <p>“We didn’t even get to see the sights,” said Celia in mock-complaining tones.</p>
   <p>“What? Uncovering a false intelligence source, then discovering a slaver ring and trying to get captured for three days wasn’t enough excitement for you?”</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>You</emphasis> got the exciting part, Father. I got to sit up here and play with the toys.”</p>
   <p>“Very expensive toys.”</p>
   <p>She smiled, “Well, creating false energy signatures that withstand scrutiny is fun. And <emphasis>three</emphasis> of them . . . I’m very proud of that.”</p>
   <p>“So you should be. Set a course for Terra.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, sir,” she said, with an only slightly mocking smile.</p>
   <p>The cleverly disguised ship moved rapidly away from the planet’s surface. To the port control scanners below, the ensign sent false signals making it appear as if they had rendezvoused with a much larger ship, then the three phantom ships left orbit. Celia put the disguised fast scout ship into an arch trajectory out of the atmosphere and then entered faster-than-light for the first of several jumps to Terra.</p>
   <p>With some irony, the deputy inspector general considered how amused Laren, the Marine LURPS, would have been if he had realized that he had been riding in a LURPS ship disguised as a shuttle craft. As much as Flandry would have loved to commandeer a capital ship and travel in relative comfort, there weren’t enough to go around.</p>
   <p>Turning to his daughter, he asked, “Is there anything in the library I haven’t read?”</p>
   <p>She reached under her flight chair and pulled out a reader tablet and said, “I’m busy; look for yourself, Daddy.”</p>
   <p>“What?”</p>
   <p>“Look for yourself, Daddy, sir.”</p>
   <p>Ten days later, Flandry made his way across the sprawling lawns of his family’s estate. He saw the object of his visit sitting on a small canvas-and-wood folding stool, under a large shade tree. At the edge of the lake, his aide-de-camp stood holding a fishing pole as he played the line out a bit. A batsman waited nearby, ready to answer any need the man on the chair might have, while a cook was preparing a very large stove and work area for a late lunch.</p>
   <p>Seeing Flandry approaching, the batsman smiled, nodded, and retired a discrete distance away to allow the two men some privacy. Reaching the old man’s side, Flandry said, “A full field kitchen?”</p>
   <p>“I hate to send Raoul running back to the house because I forgot something.” He rubbed his withered hands together. “As soon as Wilson catches another fish, I’ll make us lunch.”</p>
   <p>“You mean Raoul will, while you order him around.”</p>
   <p>The old man cocked his head and looked disapprovingly at Flandry. “How did things on Spiracos turn out?”</p>
   <p>“No Merseian agents, despite the reports you’ve been getting, just the usual social decline and corruption.”</p>
   <p>The old man sighed. He stood up and motioned for Flandry to walk with him, away from other ears, even if the loyalty of his staff was undoubted.</p>
   <p>As they walked, the old man said, “We can’t even discern the truth of the information we’re buying, Dom. It used to be that we’d have a dozen agents where we now have one. The people we pay now . . . ” His expression made it appear as if he wished to spit, “ . . . they’re little more than rumor mongers. Reliable intelligence is a thing of the past.”</p>
   <p>Flandry looked at his grandfather and namesake. “But I did break up a band of Alcaz slavers and put a fairly reliable fellow—former Imperial Marine—in a position to do us some good.”</p>
   <p>“Well, that’s something.”</p>
   <p>“Had to shoot the governor.”</p>
   <p>“Did he deserve it?”</p>
   <p>“Most likely.”</p>
   <p>“Well, good,” said Former Admiral of the Fleet Dominic Flandry. “Your mother would be proud.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll visit her grave later.”</p>
   <p>“Good. She was always a bit of a romantic at heart,” said the old man to his namesake. After a moment, Dominic Crowfeather Flandry asked his grandfather, “Do you think it will do us any good?”</p>
   <p>They walked slowly along the edge of the water for a while, enjoying the silence and each other’s company. The younger Flandry regarded his legendary ancestor. What no enemy agent, battlefield hazard, or court intrigue could do, time had achieved: he looked frail. A grateful Empire had bestowed every medical miracle at its disposal to prolong the life of a man almost a myth within the halls of power. But the years were inexorable, and, as his grandfather had said more than once, “No one gets out of life alive.”</p>
   <p>Then the old man smiled and the energy that was the core of his being shown through. As long as there was light behind those eyes, Sir Dominic Flandry, still holding rank as Admiral of the Fleet, was a man to be respected, and feared.</p>
   <p>“Dom,” the elder Flandry said after a moment, “for most of my life I believed that my mission was to hold back a new Dark Age. At times, I felt like I was doing it alone. I rejected hope, for a renaissance seemed impossible. My only wish was to hold off a long black night in human history for as long as possible.</p>
   <p>“But since Olaf Magnussun’s betrayal . . . ” He shrugged. “The Roidhun of Merseia suffered by that failure. His power was almost godlike before, but after . . . ”—again a shrug. “Now that we have this so-called peace with the Merseians, I hope that we can endure, become a place where knowledge and a dream for a better future can survive. This new emperor is young and idealistic, the complete opposite of Emperor Josip, and a lot of powerful bad people have been run out of the government already.”</p>
   <p>The younger man couldn’t help but smile. “But Josip gave you the Inspector General’s office.”</p>
   <p>“He had no idea what I was going to do with it,” said the old man. “He thought he was putting me out to pasture—letting me keep the rank of Fleet Admiral was honorary, or so he thought.”</p>
   <p>“And key sycophants of Josip’s managed to get themselves arrested, or dead, since then.”</p>
   <p>Waving away the comment, the elder Flandry said, “Ask any gardener. You have to prune away diseased limbs and dead branches for the plant to thrive.”</p>
   <p>He looked at his grandson and slowly shook his head. “We got lucky. I merely took advantage.</p>
   <p>“And,” he said with a smile and what could only be called a merry glint in his eye, “the Merseians are just as hamstrung by internal chaos as we are since the Magnussun fiasco. Their race pride got the best of them and their clients are pulling away.” He smiled, and nodded. “Got word while you were gone that the Chereionites have as much as declared independence, though they’re too smart a bunch to be that blatant about it.”</p>
   <p>The young Flandry nodded. “They are the intellectual power within the Merseian Empire. If they pull away . . . ?” He sighed. Looking out over the calm waters of the lake, he considered the simple, almost ageless, beauty of his family’s estate.</p>
   <p>Unlike his mother, whom his grandfather hadn’t met until she was half-grown, he had been raised by his namesake since early childhood. The death of his mother was a vague memory and that of his father even fainter; only his grandfather had been there every step of the way.</p>
   <p>It had been Fleet Admiral Dominic Flandry who had engineered a revival within the deepest halls of power within the Empire; he had hand-picked every teacher for the young Emperor Gustaff II, and he had insured that his grandson had been given no choices but to serve. The younger Flandry suspected that his wife had been chosen for him too, as his daughter was certainly following in the family trade.</p>
   <p>Looking into the old man’s face, he saw pride reflected in his eyes. “It goes on for ever, doesn’t it?</p>
   <p>The old man paused before answering. “There is a very old saying about darkness, going back to ancient times, even before space travel. In the ancient Empire of China, they would say, <emphasis>It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness.</emphasis>” He looked up at the brilliant blue sky of ancient Earth and said, “You may not have banished the long dark night, Dom, but I think you lit another candle.”</p>

   <p><strong>AFTERWORD:</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>I don’t exactly</strong> remember when I met Poul for the first time, but it had to be at Greg Bear’s. I’d met Greg some years earlier when he was a one-novel newcomer and I hadn’t even gotten serious about my first novel. Somewhere along the way Greg ended up married to Poul and Karen’s daughter, so it became something of a package deal.</p>
   <p>So over the years I’d just keep bumping into Poul and Karen, usually at Greg and Astrid’s house when they lived nearby or at science fiction/fantasy conventions when I started doing some of those.</p>
   <p>Here’s the thing: there was always this weird disconnect in my head between Greg’s father-in-law and this guy I used to read all the time in college. Poul Anderson, the writer, was a guy who made me laugh, get angry, stay up way past my bedtime reading just a few more pages, and all those other things that writers you adore do to you. Greg’s father-in-law was this guy I’d share jokes with, argue politics with, and feel as at home with as I did with one of my uncles.</p>
   <p>When asked to contribute to this collection, the two Pouls suddenly collided in my mind, because while I spent a fair amount of time in Poul’s company over the years, I don’t think I ever played the role of fan. I’m pretty sure I’d mentioned somewhere along the way that I had read pretty much everything he’d written as I was growing up, but I doubted it was much more than a “hi, I’m a fan,” sort of stuff. I think in part because Poul wasn’t the kind of guy to care hearing a lot of praise but rather who wanted to talk about other stuff, the state of public education, how we’re going to convince politicians about seriously getting back into space, how to get rid of crabgrass, you now, stuff that was important to him.</p>
   <p>So I said I’d write a Flandry story, because among so much of his body of work I loved—the entire future history he wrote, his really fun stuff like Operation Chaos, and some brilliant short fiction—Flandry was <emphasis>the guy.</emphasis> He was too cool for school, and always kept his head about him, and was a total bastard in a noble cause, in short, the sort of hero I wish I had thought up. He was such a great character; Bertie Chandler asked to borrow him for one of his Commodore Grimes stories. So if Flandry was cool enough for A. Bertram Chandler to borrow, I would too.</p>
   <p>I’m older now and Poul is gone and age is a concept that doesn’t often concern younger writers. But after a while you dwell on it from time to time. See, what I never told Poul was that I didn’t think that Flandry was fighting a useless fight. He wasn’t just slowing the coming darkness; he was holding it at bay until something else, something good, could happen. So, I got to write a story to show what I thought would happen next. And, it’s a way to say thank you to Poul, for letting me borrow one of the best characters ever.</p>
