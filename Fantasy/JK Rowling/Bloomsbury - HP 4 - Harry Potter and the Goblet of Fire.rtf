, even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there. It stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face. Once a fine-looking manor, and e
asily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict and unoccupied.

. Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, someth
ing that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce. The story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was any more. Ever
y version of the tale, however, started in the same place: fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer\rquote 
s morning, when the Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, and a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.
\par The maid had run screaming down the hill into the village, and roused as many people as she could.
\par \lquote Lying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice! Still in their dinner things!\rquote 
\par The police were summoned, and the whole of Little Hangleton had seethed with
 shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement. Nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they had been most unpopular. Elderly Mr and Mrs Riddle had been rich, snobbish and rude, and their grown-up son, Tom, had been 
even more so. All the villagers cared about was the identity of their mur\-derer \endash  plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night.
\par The Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the whole village had turned out to discuss the murders. They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles\rquote 
 cook arrived dramatically in their midst, and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just been arrested.
\par \lquote Frank!\rquote  cried several people. \lquote Never!\rquote 
\par Frank Bryce was the Riddles\rquote  gardener. He lived alone in a run-down cottage in the Riddle House grounds. Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been wor
king for the Riddles ever since.
\par There was a rush to buy the cook drinks, and hear more details.
\par \lquote Always thought he was odd,\rquote  she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry. \lquote Unfriendly, like. I\rquote m sure if I\rquote ve offered him a cuppa once, I\rquote 
ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn\rquote t.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, now,\rquote  said a woman at the bar, \lquote he had a hard war, Frank, he likes the quiet life. That\rquote s no reason to \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Who else had a key to the back door, then?\rquote  barked the cook. \lquote There\rquote s been a spare key hanging in the gardener\rquote 
s cottage far back as I can remember! Nobody forced the door last night! No broken windows! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping ...\rquote 
\par The villagers exchanged dark looks.
\par \lquote I always thought he had a nasty look about him, right enough,\rquote  grunted a man at the bar.
\par \lquote War turned him funny, if you ask me,\rquote  said the landlord.
\par \lquote Told you I wouldn\rquote t like to get on the wrong side of Frank, didn\rquote t I, Dot?\rquote  said an excited woman in the corner.
\par \lquote Horrible temper,\rquote  said Dot, nodding fervently, \lquote I remember, when he was a kid ...\rquote 
\par By the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles.
\par But over in the neighbouring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles\rquote 
 deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale. Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure that Frank had invented him.
\par Then, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on the Riddles\rquote  bodies came back and changed everything.
\par The police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors had examined the bodies, and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, stran\-
gled, suffocated or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all. In fact, the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilder\-ment, the Riddles all appeared to be in perfect health \endash 
 apart from the fact that they were all dead. The doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face \endash 
 but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 frightened }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 to death?
\par As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go. The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while. To everyone\rquote 
s surprise, and amidst a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage in the grounds of the Riddle House.
\par \lquote  \rquote S\rquote far as I\rquote m concerned, he killed them, and I don\rquote t care what the police say,\rquote  said Dot in the Hanged Man. \lquote And if he had any decency, he\rquote d leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.\rquote 

\par But Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next \endash 
 for neither family stayed long. Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that each new owner said there was a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into disrepair.

, though nobody was very clear what these might be. The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however. Frank was nearin
g his seventy-seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering around the flowerbeds in fine weather, even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend wit
h, either. Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle House. They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth. Once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare. They knew that 
o
ld Frank was devoted to the house and grounds, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them. Frank, on his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparen
ts, thought him a murderer. So when Frank awoke one night in August, and saw something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.
\par It was Frank\rquote s bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in his old age. He got up and limped down\-
stairs into the kitchen, with the idea of re-filling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee. Standing at the sink, fill\-ing the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and s
aw lights glimmering in its upper windows. Frank knew at once what was going on. The boys had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering quality of the light, they had started a fire.
\par Frank had no telephone, and in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles\rquote 
 deaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty 
old key from its hook by the door. He picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall, and set off into the night.
\par The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, and nor did any of the windows. Frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost com\-
pletely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock and opened the door noiselessly.
\par He had let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not entered it for many years; nevertheless, alt
hough it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way towards it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He reached the hall, which was a little lig
hter owing to the large mullioned windows either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust which lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick.
\par On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at on
ce where the intruders were: at the very end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor. Frank edged closer and closer, grasping his walking stick firmly. Several fe
et from the entrance, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.
\par The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised him. He stopped moving and listened intently, for a man\rquote s voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.
\par \lquote There is a little more in the bottle, my Lord, if you are still hungry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Later,\rquote  said a second voice. This, too, belonged to a man \endash  but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind. Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank\rquote s neck stand up. 
\lquote Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail.\rquote 
\par Frank turned his right ear towards the door, the better to hear. There came the chink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small ma
n, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head. Then he disappeared from sight again.
\par \lquote Where is Nagini?\rquote  said the cold voice.
\par \lquote I \endash  I don\rquote t know, my Lord,\rquote  said the first voice nervously. \lquote She set out to explore the house, I think ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,\rquote  said the second voice. \lquote I will need feeding in the night. The journey has tired me greatly.\rquote 
\par Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door, listening very hard. There was a pause, and then the man called Wormtail spoke again.
\par \lquote My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?\rquote 
\par \lquote A week,\rquote  said the cold voice. \lquote Perhaps longer. The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.\rquote 
\par Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a build-up of earwax, he had heard the word \lquote Quidditch\rquote , which was not a word at all.
\par \lquote The \endash  the Quidditch World Cup, my Lord?\rquote  said Wormtail. (Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.) \lquote Forgive me, but \endash  I do not understand \endash  why should we wait until the World Cup is over?\rquote 

\par \lquote Because, fool, at this very moment wiza
rds are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity, checking and double-checking identities. They will be obsessed with security, lest the Mugg
les notice anything. So we wait.\rquote 
\par Frank stopped trying to clear his ear out. He had distinctly heard the words \lquote Ministry of Magic\rquote , \lquote wizards\rquote  and \lquote Muggles\rquote 
. Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code \endash  spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.

\par \lquote Your Lordship is still determined, then?\rquote  Wormtail said quietly.
\par \lquote Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.\rquote  There was a note of menace in the cold voice now.
\par A slight pause followed \endash  and then Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve.
\par \lquote It could be done without Harry Potter, my Lord.\rquote 
\par Another pause, more protracted, and then \endash 
\par \lquote Without Harry Potter?\rquote  breathed the second voice softly. \lquote I see ...\rquote 
\par \lquote My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!\rquote  said Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily. \lquote The boy is nothing to me, nothing at all! It is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard \endash  any wizard \endash 
 the thing could be done so much more quickly! If you allowed me to leave you for a short while \endash  you know that I can disguise myself most effectively \endash  I could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote I could use another wizard,\rquote  said the second voice softly, \lquote that is true ...\rquote 
\par \lquote My Lord, it makes sense,\rquote  said Wormtail, sounding thoroughly relieved now, \lquote laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult, he is so well protected \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute? I wonder ... perhaps the task of nursing me has become weari\-some for you, Wormtail? Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me?\rquote 
\par \lquote My Lord! I \endash  I have no wish to leave you, none at all \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Do not lie to me!\rquote  hissed the second voice. \lquote I can always tell, Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever returned to me. I revolt you. I see you flinch when you look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me ...\rquote 
\par \lquote No! My devotion to your Lordship \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go. How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding every few hours? Who is to milk Nagini?\rquote 
\par \lquote But you seem so much stronger, my Lord \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Liar,\rquote  breathed the second voice. \lquote I am no stronger, and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your clumsy care. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Wormtail, who had been spluttering incoherently, fell silent at once. For a few seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling. Then the second man spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.
\par \lquote 
I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained to you, and I will use no other. I have waited thirteen years. A few more months will make no difference. As for the protection surrounding the boy, I believe my plan will be effective. All 
that is needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail \endash  courage you will find, unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldemort\rquote s wrath \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote My Lord, I must speak!\rquote  said Wormtail, panic in his voice now. \lquote All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head \endash  my Lord, Bertha Jorkins\rquote

 said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his voice.
\par \lquote Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfil neither requirement.\rquote 
\par \lquote I found you,\rquote  said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now. \lquote I was the one who found you. I brought you Bertha Jorkins.\rquote 
\par \lquote That is true,\rquote  said the second man, sounding amused. \lquote A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail \endash 
 though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her, were you?\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  I thought she might be useful, my Lord \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Liar,\rquote  said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever. \lquote 
However, I do not deny that her information was invaluable. Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail. I will allow you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my followers would giv
e their right hands to perform ...\rquote 
\par \lquote R-really, my Lord? What \endash ?\rquote  Wormtail sounded terrified again.
\par \lquote Ah, Wormtail, you don\rquote t want me to spoil the surprise? Your part will come at the very end ... but I promise you, you will have the honour of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins.\rquote 
\par \lquote You ... you ...\rquote  Wormtail\rquote s voice sounded suddenly hoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry. \lquote You ... are going ... to kill me, too?\rquote 
\par \lquote Wormtail, Wormtail,\rquote  said the cold voice silkily, \lquote why would I kill you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite useless. In any case, awk\-
ward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holi\-days. Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns ...\rquote 
\par Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh \endash  an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote We could have modified her memory? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail.\rquote 
\par Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with the cold voice had killed a woman. He was talking about it without any kind of remorse \endash  with }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 amusement. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 He was dangerous \endash  a madman. And he was planning more murders \endash  this boy, Harry
 Potter, whoever he was \endash  was in danger \endash 
\par Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village ... but the cold voice was speaking again, and Fran
k remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.
\par \lquote One more curse ... my faithful servant at Hogwarts ... Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is decided. There will be no more argument. But quiet ... I think I hear Nagini ...\rquote 
\par And the second man\rquote s voice changed. He started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath. Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure.
\par And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway. He turned to look behind him, and found himself paralysed with fright.
\par Something was slithering towards him along the dark corri\-dor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realised with a thrill of terror tha
t it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long. Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared at it as its undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming closer and closer \endash 
 what was he to do? The only means of escape was into the room where two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him \endash 
\par But before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the sp
itting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had vanished through the gap.
\par There was sweat on Frank\rquote s forehead now, and the hand on the walking stick was trembling. Inside the room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 This man could talk to snakes.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par Frank didn\rquote t understand what was going on. He wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle. The problem was that his legs didn\rquote 
t seem to want to move. As he stood there shaking, and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched abruptly to English again.
\par \lquote Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,\rquote  it said.
\par \lquote In-indeed, my Lord?\rquote  said Wormtail.
\par \lquote Indeed, yes,\rquote  said the voice. \lquote According to Nagini, there is an old Muggle standing right outside this room, listening to every word we say.\rquote 
\par Frank didn\rquote t have a chance to hide himself. There were footsteps, and then the door of the room was flung wide open.
\par A short, balding man with greying hair, a pointed nose and small, watery eyes stood before Frank, a mixture of fear and alarm on his face.
\par \lquote Invite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your manners?\rquote 
\par The cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire, but Frank couldn\rquote t see the speaker. The snake, on the other hand, was curled up on the rotting hearth-rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet dog.
\par Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still deeply shaken, Frank took a firmer grip upon his walking stick, and limped over the threshold.
\par The fire was the only source of light in the room; it was cast\-ing long, spidery shadows upon the walls. Frank stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn\rquote 
t even see the back of his head.
\par \lquote You heard everything, Muggle?\rquote  said the cold voice.
\par \lquote What\rquote s that you\rquote re calling me?\rquote  said Frank defiantly, for now that he was inside the room, now that the time had come for some sort of action, he felt braver; it had always been so in the war.
\par \lquote I am calling you a Muggle,\rquote  said the voice coolly. \lquote It means that you are not a wizard.\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know what you mean by wizard,\rquote  said Frank, his voice growing steadier. \lquote All I know is I\rquote ve heard enough to interest the police tonight, I have. You\rquote ve done murder and you\rquote re planning more! And I
\rquote ll tell you this, too,\rquote  he added, on a sudden inspiration, \lquote my wife knows I\rquote m up here, and if I don\rquote t come back \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You have no wife,\rquote  said the cold voice, very quietly. \lquote Nobody knows you are here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows ... he always knows ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Is that right?\rquote  said Frank roughly. \lquote Lord, is it? Well, I don\rquote t think much of your manners, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 my Lord. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Turn round and face me like a man, why don\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote But I am not a man, Muggle,\rquote  said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames. \lquote I am much, much more than a man. However ... why not? I will face you ... Wormtail, come turn my chair around.\rquote 
\par The servant gave a whimper.
\par \lquote You heard me, Wormtail.\rquote 
\par Slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth\-rug where the snake lay, the small man walked forwards and began to turn the chair. The sn
ake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.
\par And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it. His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let out
 a scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke, as it raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was dead before he hit the floor.
\par Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with a start.

Harry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running. He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face. The old scar on his forehead, whi
ch was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his skin.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other reaching out in the darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange light that was filtering through the curta
ins from the street lamp outside the window.
\par Harry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still painful. He turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door.
 A skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely. It looked normal, but it was still stinging.
\par Harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken. It had seemed so real ... there had been two people he knew, and one he didn\rquote t ... he concentrated hard, frowning, trying to remember ...
\par The dim picture of a darkened room came to him ... there had been a snake on a h
earth-rug ... a small man called Peter, nicknamed Wormtail ... and a cold, high voice ... the voice of Lord Voldemort. Harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought ...
\par He closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what Voldemort had looked like, but it was impossible ... all Harry knew was that at the moment when Voldemort\rquote 
s chair had swung around, and he, Harry, had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt a spasm of horror which had awoken him ... or had that been the pain in his scar?
\par And who had the old man been? For there had definitely been an old man; Harry had watched him fall to the ground. It was all becoming confused; Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his bedroom, trying to hold on to the 
picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them ... Voldemort and Wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed, though Harry co
uld not remember the name ... and they had been plotting to kill someone else ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 him}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  ...
\par Harry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there. As it happened, there were an extra\-
ordinary number of unusual things in this room. A large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron, broomstick, black robes and assorted spellbooks. Rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by t
he large, empty cage in which his snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched. On the floor beside his bed a book lay open; he had been reading it before he fell asleep the previ\-
ous night. The pictures in this book were all moving. Men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks, throwing a red ball to each other.
\par Harry walked over to this book, picked it up and watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty-foot-high hoop. Then he snapped the book shut. Even Quidditch \endash  in Harry\rquote 
s opinion, the best sport in the world \endash  couldn\rquote t distract him at the moment. He placed }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Flying with the Cannons }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 on his bedside table, crossed to the window and drew back the curtains to survey the street below.
\par Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look in the early hours of Saturday morning. All the curtains were closed. As far as Harry could see through the darkness, there wasn\rquote 
t a living creature in sight, not even a cat.
\par And yet ... and yet ... Harry went restlessly back to his bed and sat down on it, running a finger over his scar again. It wasn\rquote 
t the pain that bothered him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost all the bones from his right arm once, and had the
m painfully regrown in a night. The same arm had been pierced by a venomous foot-long fang not long afterwards. Only last year Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick. He was used to bizarre accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if
 you attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a knack for attract\-ing a lot of trouble.
\par No, the thing that was bothering Harry was that the last time his scar had hurt him, it had been because Voldemort had been close by ... but Voldemort couldn\rquote t be here, now ... the idea of Voldemort lurking in Privet Drive was absurd, impos\-
sible ...
\par Harry listened closely to the silence around him. Was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair, or the swish of a cloak? And then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room.
\par Harry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid; there was no one in the house with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Dudley, and they were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless.
\par Asleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it wasn\rquote t as though they were ever any help to him awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Dudley were Harry\rquote s only living relatives. They were Muggles (non-magic people) 
who hated and despised magic in any form, which meant that Harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot. They had explained away Harry\rquote s long absences at Hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to St Brutus
\rquote s Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys. They knew perfect\-ly well that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasn\rquote 
t allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house. Harry had never been able to confide in
 them, or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world. The very idea of going to them when they awoke, and telling them about his scar hurt\-ing him, and about his worries about Voldemort, was laugh\-able.
\par And yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had come to live with the Dursleys in the first place. If it hadn\rquote t been for Voldemort, Harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead. If it hadn\rquote 
t been for Voldemort, Harry would still have had parents ...
\par Harry had been a year old the night that Voldemort \endash  the most powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years \endash 
 arrived at his house and killed his father and mother. Voldemort had then turned his wand on Harry; he had performed the curse that had disposed of many full-grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power \endash 
 and, incredibly, it had not worked. Instead of killing the small boy, the curse had rebounded upon Voldemort. Harry had survived with nothing but a lightning-shape
d cut on his forehead, and Voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive. His powers gone, his life almost extinguished, Voldemort had fled; the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted, Voldemort
\rquote s followers had disbanded, and Harry Potter had become famous.
\par It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizard\-ing world
 knew his name. Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went. But he was used to it now: at the end of this summer, he would be starting his fourth year at Hogwarts; and he was already counting the day
s until he would be back at the castle again.
\par But there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school. He looked hopelessly around his room again, and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of July. Wha
t would they say if he wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting?
\par At once, Hermione Granger\rquote s voice filled his head, shrill and panicky.

\par Yes, that would be Hermione\rquote s advice: go straight to the Headmaster of Hogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book. Harry stared out of the window at the inky, b
lue-black sky. He doubted very much whether a book could help him now. As far as he knew, he was the only living person to have survived a curse like Voldemort\rquote s; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his symptoms listed in }{

As for informing the Headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore went during the summer holidays. He amused himself for a moment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long silver beard, full-length wizard\rquote s robes and pointed hat, stre
tched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion into his long crooked nose. Wherever Dumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that Hedwig would be able to find him; Harry\rquote s owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to any\-
one, even without an address. But what would he write?
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Dear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to bother you, but my scar hurt this morning. Yours sincerely, Harry Potter.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Mr Weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, but he didn\rquote t have any particular expertise in the matter of curses, as far as Harry knew. In any case, Harry didn\rquote 
t like the idea of the whole Weasley family knowing that he, Harry, was getting jumpy about a few moments\rquote  pain. Mrs Weasley would fuss worse than Hermione, and Fred and George, Ron\rquote s sixtee
n-year-old twin brothers, might think Harry was losing his nerve. The Weasleys were Harry\rquote 
s favourite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now (Ron had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn\rquote t want his visit punctuated with anxious enquiries about his scar.

\par Harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What he really wanted (and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself) was someone like \endash  someone like a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
parent: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who cared about him, who had had experience of Dark Magic ...
\par And then the solution came to him. It was so simple, and so obvious, that he couldn\rquote t believe it had taken so long \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Sirius.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par Harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room and sat down at his desk; he pulled a piece of parchment towards him, loaded his eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Dear Sirius,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  then paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, and still marvelling at the fact that he hadn
\rquote t thought of Sirius straight away. But then, perhaps it wasn\rquote t so surprising \endash  after all, he had only found out that Sirius was his godfather two months ago.
\par There was a simple reason for Sirius\rquote  complete absence from Harry\rquote s life until then \endash  Sirius had been in Azkaban, the terrify\-ing wizard gaol guarded by creatures called Dementors, sight\-
less, soul-sucking fiends who had come to search for Sirius at Hogwarts when he had escaped. Yet Sirius had been innocent \endash the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by Wormtail, Voldemort\rquote 
s supporter, whom nearly everybody now believed dead. Harry, Ron and Hermione knew otherwise, however; they had come face to face with Wormtail the previous year, though only Professor Dumbledore had believed their story.
\par For one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving the Dursleys at last, because Sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared. But the chance had been snatched away from him \endash  Wormtail had
 escaped before they could take him to the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for his life. Harry had helped him escape on the back of a Hippogriff called Buckbeak, and since then, Sirius had been on the run. The home Harry might have had if Wo
rmtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer. It had been doubly hard to return to the Dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them for ever.
\par Nevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry, even if he couldn\rquote t be with him. It was due 
to Sirius that Harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him. The Dursleys had never allowed this before; their general wish of keeping Harry as miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his powers, had led them to lock his school tr
unk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this. But their attitude had changed since they had found out that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather \endash  Harry had con\-veniently forgotten to tell them that Sirius was innocent.

\par Harry had
 received two letters from Sirius since he had been back at Privet Drive. Both had been delivered, not by owls (as was usual with wizards) but by large, brightly coloured, tropical birds. Hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders; she had been mos
t
 reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again. Harry, on the other hand, had liked them; they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that wherever Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were 
intercepted) he was enjoy\-ing himself. Somehow, Harry found it hard to imagine Dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight; perhaps that was why Sirius had gone south. Sirius\rquote 
 letters, which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboard under Harry\rquote s bed, sounded cheerful, and in both of them he had reminded Harry to call on him if ever Harry needed to. Well, he needed to now, all right ...
\par Harry\rquote s lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold grey light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the 
room. Finally, when the sun had risen, when his bedroom walls had turned gold and when sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia\rquote 
s room, Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment, and re-read his finished letter.

By the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three Dursleys were already seated around the table. None of them looked up as he entered or sat down. Uncle Vernon\rquote s large red face was hidden behind the morning\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39

Dudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual. This was saying something, as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself. When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweet\-
ened grapefruit onto Dudley\rquote s plate with a tremulous \lquote There you are, Diddy darling\rquote , Dudley glowered at her. His life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end-of-year report.
\par Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual; Aunt Petunia always insist\-ed that Dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn\rquote t understand him, while Uncle Vernon maintained that \lquote he didn\rquote 
t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway\rquote . They also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report \endash  \lquote He\rquote s a boisterous little boy, but he wouldn\rquote t hurt a fly!\rquote  said Aunt Petunia tearfully.

\par However, at the bottom of the report there were a few well chose
n comments from the school nurse which not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could explain away. No matter how much Aunt Petunia wailed that Dudley was big-boned, and that his poundage was really puppy-fat, and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty
 of food, the fact remained that the school outfitters didn\rquote t stock knickerbockers big enough for him any more. The school nurse had seen what Aunt Petunia\rquote s eyes \endash 
 so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbours \endash 
 simply refused to see: that, far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale.
\par So \endash  after many tantrums, after arguments that shook Harry\rquote s bedroom floor, and many tears from Aunt Petunia \endash 
 the new regime had begun. The diet sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been emptied of all Dudley\rquote s favourite things \endash  fizzy drinks and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers \endash 
 and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called \lquote rabbit food\rquote 
. To make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She now passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed that it was a lot smaller than Dudley\rquote 
s. Aunt Petunia seemed to feel that the best way to keep up Dudley\rquote s morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get more to eat than Harry.
\par But Aunt Petunia didn\rquote t know what was hidden unde
r the loose floorboard upstairs. She had no idea that Harry was not following the diet at all. The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks, Harry had sent Hedwig to his friends with pleas for help, an
d they had risen to the occasion magnificently. Hedwig had returned from Hermione\rquote s house with a large box stuffed full of sugar-free snacks (Hermione\rquote 
s parents were dentists). Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had obliged with a sack full of his own home-made rock cakes (Harry hadn\rquote t touched these; he had had too much experience of Hagrid\rquote 
s cooking). Mrs Weasley, however, had sent the family owl, Errol, with an enormous fruitcake and assorted pasties. Poor Errol, who was elderly and feeble, had needed a full five days to recover from the journey. And then on Harry\rquote 
s birthday (which the Dursleys had completely ignored) he had received four superb birthday cakes, one each from Ron, Hermione, Hagrid and Sirius. Harry still had two of them left, and so, looking f
orward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs, he started eating his grapefruit without complaint.
\par Uncle Vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of dis\-approval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter.
\par \lquote Is this it?\rquote  he said grumpily to Aunt Petunia.
\par Aunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then nodded pointedly at Dudley, who had already finished his own grape\-fruit quarter, and was eyeing Harry\rquote s with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes.
\par Uncle Vernon gave a great sigh which ruffled his large, bushy moustache, and picked up his spoon.
\par The doorbell rang. Uncle Vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down the hall. Quick as a flash, while his mother was occupied with the kettle, Dudley stole the rest of Uncle Vernon\rquote s grapefruit.
\par Harry heard talking at the door, and someone laughing, and Uncle Vernon answering curtly. Then the front door closed, and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall.
\par Aunt Petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where Uncle Vernon had got to. She didn\rquote t have to wait long to find out; after about a minute, he was back. He looked livid.
\par \lquote You,\rquote  he barked at Harry. \lquote In the living room. Now.\rquote 
\par Bewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time, Harry got up and followed Uncle Vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room. Uncle Vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them.
\par \lquote So,\rquote  he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face Harry as though he was about to pronounce him under arrest. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote So.\rquote }{

s temper should be tested this early in the morning, especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food. He therefore settled for looking politely puzzled.
\par \lquote This just arrived,\rquote  said Uncle Vernon. He brandished a piece of purple writing paper at Harry. \lquote A letter. About you.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s confusion increased. Who would be writing to Uncle Vernon about him? Who did he know who sent letters by the postman?

Uncle Vernon finished reading, put his hand back into his breast pocket, and drew out something else.

\par He held up the envelope in which Mrs Weasley\rquote s letter had come, and Harry had to fight down a laugh. Every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front, into which Mrs Weasley had squeezed the Dursleys\rquote 
 address in minute writing.
\par \lquote She did put enough stamps on, then,\rquote  said Harry, trying to sound as though Mrs Weasley\rquote s was a mistake anyone could make. His uncle\rquote s eyes flashed.
\par \lquote The postman noticed,\rquote  he said through gritted teeth. \lquote Very interested to know where this letter came from, he was. That\rquote s why he rang the doorbell. Seemed to think it was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Harry didn\rquote t say anything. Other people might not under\-stand why Uncle Vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps, but Harry had lived with the Dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about any
thing even slightly out of the ordinary. Their worst fear was that anyone would find out that they were connected (however distantly) with people like Mrs Weasley.
\par Uncle Vernon was still glaring at Harry, who tried to keep his expression neutral. If he didn\rquote 
t do or say anything stupid, he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime. He waited for Uncle Vernon to say something, but he merely continued to glare. Harry decided to break the silence.
\par \lquote So \endash  can I go, then?\rquote  he asked.
\par A slight spasm crossed Uncle Vernon\rquote s large, purple face. The moustache bristled. Harry thought he knew what was going on behind the moustache: a furious battle as two of Uncle Vernon\rquote 
s most fundamental instincts came into conflict. Allowing Harry to go would make Harry happy, something Uncle Vernon had struggled against for thirteen years. On the other hand, allowing Harry to disappear to the Weasleys\rquote 
 for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and Uncle Vernon hated having Harry in the house. To give himself thinking time, it seemed, he looked down at Mrs Weasley\rquote s letter again.
\par \lquote Who is this woman?\rquote  he said, staring at the signature with distaste.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve seen her,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote She\rquote s my friend Ron\rquote s mother, she was meeting him off the Hog\emdash  off the school train at the end of last term.\rquote 
\par He had almost said \lquote Hogwarts Express\rquote , and that was a sure way to get his uncle\rquote s temper up. Nobody ever mentioned the name of Harry\rquote s school aloud in the Dursley household.
\par Uncle Vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant.
\par \lquote Dumpy sort of woman?\rquote  he growled finally. \lquote Load of children with red hair?\rquote 
\par Harry frowned. He thought it was a bit rich of Uncle Vernon to call anyone \lquote dumpy\rquote , when his own son, Dudley, had finally achieved what he\rquote d been threatening to do since the age of three, and become wider than he was tall.
\par Uncle Vernon was perusing the letter again.
\par \lquote Quidditch,\rquote  he muttered under his breath. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Quidditch \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 what is this rubbish?\rquote 
\par Harry felt a second stab of annoyance.
\par \lquote It\rquote s a sport,\rquote  he said shortly. \lquote Played on broom\emdash \rquote 
\par \lquote All right, all right!\rquote  said Uncle Vernon loudly. Harry saw, with some satisfaction, that his uncle looked vaguely panicky. Apparently his nerves wouldn\rquote t stand the sound of the word \lquote broomsticks\rquote 
 in his living room. He took refuge in perusing the letter again. Harry saw his lips form the words \lquote send us your answer in the normal way\rquote . He scowled.
\par \lquote What does she mean, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 the normal way?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 he spat.
\par \lquote Normal for us,\rquote  said Harry, and before his uncle could stop him, he added, \lquote you know, owl post. That\rquote s what\rquote s normal for wizards.\rquote 
\par Uncle Vernon looked as outraged as if Harry had just uttered a disgusting swear word. Shaking with anger, he shot a nervy look through the window, as though expecting to see some of the neighbours with their ears pressed against the glass.
\par \lquote How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof?\rquote  he hissed, his face now a rich plum colour. \lquote You stand there, in the clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote Only after Dudley finished with them,\rquote  said Harry coldly, and indeed, he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able t
o use his hands, and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans.
\par \lquote I will not be spoken to like that!\rquote  said Uncle Vernon, trem\-bling with rage.
\par But Harry wasn\rquote t going to stand for this. Gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the Dursleys\rquote  stupid rules. He wasn\rquote t following Dudley\rquote s diet, and he wasn\rquote 
t going to let Uncle Vernon stop him going to the Quidditch World Cup, not if he could help it.
\par Harry took a deep, steadying breath and then said, \lquote OK, I can\rquote t see the World Cup. Can I go now, then? Only I\rquote ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish. You know \endash  my godfather.\rquote 
\par He had done it. He had said the magic words. Now he watched the purple recede blotchily from Uncle Vernon\rquote s face, making it look like badly mixed blackcurrant ice-cream.
\par \lquote You\rquote re \endash  you\rquote re writing to him, are you?\rquote  said Uncle Vernon, in a would-be calm voice \endash  but Harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear.
\par \lquote Well \endash  yeah,\rquote  said Harry, casually. \lquote It\rquote s been a while since he heard from me, and, you know, if he doesn\rquote t, he might start thinking something\rquote s wrong.\rquote 
\par He stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words. He could almost see the cogs working under Uncle Vernon\rquote s thick, dark, neatly parted hair. If he tried to stop Harry writ
ing to Sirius, Sirius would think Harry was being mistreated. If he told Harry he couldn\rquote t go to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would write and tell Sirius, who would }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 know }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 he was being mistreated. There was only one thing for Uncle Vernon to do. Harry coul
d see the conclusion forming in his mind as though the great moustached face was transparent. Harry tried not to smile, to keep his own face as blank as possible. And then \endash 
\par \lquote Well, all right then. You can go to this ruddy ... this stupid ... this World Cup thing. You write and tell these \endash  these }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Weasleys }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39

 your god\-father ... tell him ... tell him you\rquote re going.\rquote 
\par \lquote OK then,\rquote  said Harry brightly.
\par He turned and walked towards the living-room door, fight\-ing the urge to jump into the air and whoop. He was going ... he was going to the Weasleys\rquote , he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup!
\par Outside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley, who had been lurking behind the door, clearly hoping to overhear Harry being told off. He looked shocked to see the broad grin on Harry\rquote s face.
\par \lquote That was an }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 excellent }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 breakfast, wasn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Harry. 
\lquote I feel really full, don\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par Laughing at the astonished look on Dudley\rquote s face, Harry took the stairs three at a time, and hurled himself back into his bedroom.
\par The first thing he saw was that Hedwig was back. She was sitting in her cage, staring at Harry with her enormous amber eyes, and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something. Exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost 
at once.
\par \lquote OUCH!\rquote  said Harry.
\par What appeared to be a small, grey, feathery tennis ball had just collided with the side of Harry\rquote s head. Harry massaged his head furiously, looking up to see what had hit him, and saw a minute owl, small enough to fit into the p
alm of his hand, whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework. Harry then realised that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet. Harry bent down, recognised Ron\rquote 
s handwriting, then tore open the envelope. Inside was a hastily scribbled note.

s trunk was packed with his school things, and all his most prized possessions \endash  the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father, the broom\-
stick he had got from Sirius, the enchanted map of Hogwarts he had been given by Fred and George Weasley last year. He had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food, double-c
hecked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills, and taken down the chart on the wall counting the days down to September the first, on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to Hogwarts.

re inside number four Privet Drive was extremely tense. The imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the Dursleys uptight and irritable. Uncle Vernon had looked downright alarmed when Harry informed him that the Weasleys woul
d be arriving at five o\rquote clock the very next day.
\par \lquote I hope you told them to dress properly, these people,\rquote  he snarled at once. \lquote I\rquote ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear. They\rquote d better have the decency to put on normal clothes, that\rquote s all.\rquote 
\par Harry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He had rarely seen Mr or Mrs Weasley wearing anything that the Dursleys would call \lquote normal\rquote 
. Their children might don Muggle clothing during the holidays, but Mr and Mrs Weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness. Harry wasn\rquote 
t bothered about what the neighbours would think, but he was anxious about how rude the Dursleys might be to the Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards.
\par Uncle Vernon had put on his best suit. To some people, this m
ight have looked like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it was because Uncle Vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating. Dudley, on the other hand, looked somehow diminished. This was not because the diet was at last taking effect, but due to fr
ight. Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully-grown wizard with a curly pig\rquote s tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospi\-tal in London. It wasn
\rquote t altogether surprising, therefore, that Dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside, and walking sideways from room to room, so as not to present the same target to the enemy.
\par Lunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn\rquote t even protest at the food (cottage cheese and grated celery). Aunt Petunia wasn\rquote 
t eating anything at all. Her arms were folded, her lips were pursed and she seemed to be chewing her tongue, as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.
\par \lquote They\rquote ll be driving, of course?\rquote  Uncle Vernon barked across the table.
\par \lquote Er,\rquote  said Harry.
\par He hadn\rquote t thought of that. How }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 were }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
the Weasleys going to pick him up? They didn\rquote t have a car any more; the old Ford Anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in
 the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts. But Mr Weasley had borrowed a Ministry of Magic car last year; possibly he would do the same today?
\par \lquote I think so,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Uncle Vernon snorted into his moustache. Normally, Uncle Vernon would have asked what car Mr We
asley drove; he tended to judge other men on how big and expensive their cars were. But Harry doubted whether Uncle Vernon would have taken to Mr Weasley even if he drove a Ferrari.
\par Harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he couldn\rquote t stand watching Aunt Petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds, as though there had been a warn\-
ing about an escaped rhinoceros. Finally, at a quarter to five, Harry went back downstairs and into the living room.
\par Aunt Petunia was compulsively straightening cushions. Uncle Vernon was pretending to read the paper, but his tiny eyes were not moving, and Harry was sure he was really listen\-
ing with all his might for the sound of an approaching car. Dudley was crammed into an armchair, his porky hands beneath him, clamped firmly around his bottom. Harry couldn\rquote 
t take the tension; he left the room, and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves.
\par But five o\rquote clock came and then went. Uncle Vernon, perspiring slightly in his suit, opened the front door, peered up and down the street, then withdrew his head quickly.
\par \lquote They\rquote re late!\rquote  he snarled at Harry.
\par \lquote I know,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Maybe \endash  er \endash  the traffic\rquote s bad, or some\-thing.\rquote 
\par Ten past five ... then a quarter past five ... Harry was starting to feel anxious himself now. At half past, he heard Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room.
\par \lquote No consideration at all.\rquote 
\par \lquote We might\rquote ve had an engagement.\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe they think they\rquote ll get invited to dinner if they\rquote re late.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, they most certainly won\rquote t be,\rquote  said Uncle Vernon, and Harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room. \lquote They\rquote ll take the boy and go, there\rquote ll be no hanging around. That\rquote s if they\rquote 
re coming at all. Probably mistaken the day. I daresay }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 their kind }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 don\rquote 
t set much store by punctuality. Either that or they drive some tinpot car that\rquote s broken d-AAAAAAAARRRRRGH!\rquote 
\par Harry jumped up. From the other side of the living-room door came the sounds of the three Dursleys scrambling, panic-stricken, across the room. Next moment Dudley came flying into the hall, looking terrified.
\par \lquote What happened?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote What\rquote s the matter?\rquote 
\par But Dudley didn\rquote t seem able to speak. Hands still clamped over his buttocks, he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen. Harry hurried into the living room.
\par Loud hangings and scrapings were coming from behind the Dursleys\rquote  boarded-up fireplace, which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it.
\par \lquote What is it?\rquote  gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall and was staring, terrified, towards the fire. \lquote What is it, Vernon?\rquote 
\par But they were left in doubt barely a second longer. Voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace.
\par \lquote Ouch! Fred, no \endash  go back, go back, there\rquote s been some kind of mistake \endash  tell George not to \endash  OUCH! George, no, there\rquote s no room, go back quickly and tell Ron \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe Harry can hear us, Dad \endash  maybe he\rquote ll be able to let us out \endash \rquote 
\par There was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fire.
\par \lquote Harry? Harry, can you hear us?\rquote 
\par The Dursleys rounded on Harry like a pair of angry wolver\-ines.
\par \lquote What is this?\rquote  growled Uncle Vernon. \lquote What\rquote s going on?\rquote 
\par \lquote They \endash  they\rquote ve tried to get here by Floo powder,\rquote  said Harry, fighting a mad desire to laugh. \lquote They can travel by fire \endash  only you\rquote ve blocked the fireplace \endash  hang on \endash \rquote 
\par He approached the fireplace and called through the boards.
\par \lquote Mr Weasley? Can you hear me?\rquote 
\par The hammering stopped. Somebody inside the chimney-piece said, \lquote Shh!\rquote 
\par \lquote Mr Weasley, it\rquote s Harry ... the fireplace has been blocked up. You won\rquote t be able to get through there.\rquote 
\par \lquote Damn!\rquote  said Mr Weasley\rquote s voice. \lquote What on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for?\rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote ve got an electric fire,\rquote  Harry explained.
\par \lquote Really?\rquote  said Mr Weasley\rquote s voice excitedly. \lquote Ecklectic, you say? With a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 plug? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Gracious, I must see that ... let\rquote s think ... ouch, Ron!\rquote 
\par Ron\rquote s voice now joined the others\rquote .
\par \lquote What are we doing here? Has something gone wrong?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, no, Ron,\rquote  came Fred\rquote s voice, very sarcastically. \lquote No, this is exactly where we wanted to end up.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, we\rquote re having the time of our lives here,\rquote  said George, whose voice sounded muffled, as though he was squashed against the wall.
\par \lquote Boys, boys ...\rquote  said Mr Weasley vaguely. \lquote I\rquote m trying to think what to do ... yes ... only way ... stand back, Harry.\rquote 
\par Harry retreated to the sofa. Uncle Vernon, however, moved forwards.
\par \lquote Wait a moment!\rquote  he bellowed at the fire. \lquote What exactly are you going to \endash ?\rquote 
\par BANG.
\par The electric fire shot across the room as the boarded-up fire\-
place burst outwards, expelling Mr Weasley, Fred, George and Ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings. Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell backwards over the coffee table; Uncle Vernon caught her before she hit the floor and gaped, speechless, at the Wea
sleys, all of whom had bright red hair, including Fred and George, who were identical to the last freckle.
\par \lquote That\rquote s better,\rquote  panted Mr Weasley, brushing dust from his long green robes and straightening his glasses. \lquote Ah \endash  you must be Harry\rquote s aunt and uncle!\rquote 
\par Tall, thin and balding, he moved towards Uncle Vernon, his hand outstretched, but Uncle Vernon backed away several paces, dragging Aunt Petunia. Words utterly failed Uncle Vernon. His best suit was covered in white dust, which had settled in his hair and 
moustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty years.
\par \lquote Er \endash  yes \endash  sorry about that,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace. \lquote It\rquote s all my fault, it just didn\rquote t occur to me that we wouldn\rquote t b
e able to get out at the other end. I had your fireplace connected to the Floo Network, you see \endash  just for an afternoon, you know, so we could get Harry. Muggle fireplaces aren\rquote t supposed to be connected, strictly speaking \endash  but I
\rquote ve got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me. I can put it right in a jiffy, though, don\rquote t worry. I\rquote ll light a fire to send the boys back, and then I can repair your fireplace before I Disapparate.
\rquote 
\par Harry was ready to bet that the Dursleys hadn\rquote t understood a single word of this. They were still gaping at Mr Weasley, thun\-derstruck. Aunt Petunia staggered upright again, and hid behind Uncle Vernon.
\par \lquote Hello, Harry!\rquote  said Mr Weasley brightly. \lquote Got your trunk ready?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s upstairs,\rquote  said Harry, grinning back.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll get it,\rquote  said Fred at once. Winking at Harry, he and George left the room. They knew where Harry\rquote 
s bedroom was, having once rescued him from it in the dead of night. Harry suspected that Fred and George were hoping for a glimpse of Dudley; they had heard a lot about him from Harry.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, swinging his arms slightly, while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence. \lquote Very \endash  erm \endash  very nice place you\rquote ve got here.\rquote 
\par As the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick, this remark didn\rquote t go down too well with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon\rquote 
s face purpled once more, and Aunt Petunia started chewing her tongue again. However, they seemed too scared to actually say anything.
\par Mr Weasley was looking around. He loved everything to do with Muggles. Harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder.
\par \lquote They run off eckeltricity, do they?\rquote  he said knowledgeably. \lquote Ah yes, I can see the plugs. I collect plugs,\rquote  he added to Uncle Vernon. \lquote And batteries. Got a very large collection of batteries. My wife thinks I\rquote 
m mad, but there you are.\rquote 
\par Uncle Vernon clearly thought Mr Weasley was mad, too. He moved ever so slightly to the right, screening Aunt Petunia from view, as though he thought Mr Weasley might suddenly run at them and attack.
\par Dudley suddenly reappeared in the room. Harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared Dudley out of the kitchen. Dudley edged along the wall, gazing at Mr Weasley with terrified eyes, and attempted to conceal h
imself behind his mother and father. Unfortunately, Uncle Vernon\rquote s bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt Petunia, was nowhere near enough to conceal Dudley.
\par \lquote Ah, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?\rquote  said Mr Weasley, taking another brave stab at making conversation.
\par \lquote Yep,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote that\rquote s Dudley.\rquote 
\par He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming. Dudley was still clutching his bot\-tom as though afraid it might fall of
f. Mr Weasley, however, seemed genuinely concerned at Dudley\rquote 
s peculiar behaviour. Indeed, from the tone of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr Weasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought he was, except that Mr Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.
\par \lquote Having a good holiday, Dudley?\rquote  he said kindly.
\par Dudley whimpered. Harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive backside.
\par Fred and George came back into the room, carrying Harry\rquote s school trunk. They glanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley. Their faces cracked into identical, evil grins.
\par \lquote Ah, right,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote Better get cracking, then.\rquote 
\par He pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand. Harry saw the Dursleys draw back against the wall as one.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Incendio!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
said Mr Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him.
\par Flames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours. Mr Weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket, unt
ied it, took a pinch of the powder inside and threw it onto the flames, which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever.
\par \lquote Off you go then, Fred,\rquote  said Mr Weasley.
\par \lquote Coming,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote Oh no \endash  hang on \endash \rquote 
\par A bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred\rquote s pocket and the con\-tents were now rolling in every direction \endash  big, fat toffees in brightly coloured wrappers.
\par Fred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pock\-et, then gave the Dursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward and walked right into the fire, saying, \lquote The Burrow!\rquote 
 Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering gasp. There was a whooshing sound, and Fred vanished.
\par \lquote Right then, George,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, \lquote you and the trunk.\rquote 
\par Harry helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames, and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better. Then, with a second whoosh, George had cried, \lquote The Burrow!\rquote  and vanished too.
\par \lquote Ron, you next,\rquote  said Mr Weasley.
\par \lquote See you,\rquote  said Ron brightly to the Dursleys. He grinned broadly at Harry, then stepped into the fire, shouted, \lquote The Burrow!\rquote  and disappeared.
\par Now Harry and Mr Weasley alone remained.
\par \lquote Well ... bye then,\rquote  Harry said to the Dursleys.
\par They didn\rquote t say anything at all. Harry moved towards the fire, but just as he reached the edge of the hearth, Mr Weasley put out a hand and held him back. He was looking at the Dursleys in amazement.
\par \lquote Harry said goodbye to you,\rquote  he said. \lquote Didn\rquote t you hear him?\rquote 
\par \lquote It doesn\rquote t matter,\rquote  Harry muttered to Mr Weasley. \lquote Honestly, I don\rquote t care.\rquote 
\par Mr Weasley did not remove his hand from Harry\rquote s shoulder.
\par \lquote You aren\rquote t going to see your nephew \rquote til next summer,\rquote  he said to Uncle Vernon in mild indignation. \lquote Surely you\rquote re going to say goodbye?\rquote 
\par Uncle Vernon\rquote s face worked furiously. The idea of being taught consideration by a man who had just blasted away half his living-room wall seemed to be causing him intense suffering.
\par But Mr Weasley\rquote s wand was still in his hand, and Uncle Vernon\rquote s tiny eyes darted to it once, before he said, very resent\-fully, \lquote Goodbye, then.\rquote 
\par \lquote See you,\rquote  said Harry, putting one foot forward into the green flames, which felt pleasantly like warm breath. At that moment, however, a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him, and Aunt Petunia started to scream.
\par Harry wheeled around. Dudley was no longer standi
ng behind his parents. He was kneeling beside the coffee table, and he was gagging and spluttering on a foot-long, purple, slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth. One bewildered second later, Harry realised that the foot-long thing was Dudley
\rquote s tongue \endash  and that a brightly coloured toffee-wrapper lay on the floor before him.
\par Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley, seized the end of his swollen tongue and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth; unsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and splut\-
tered worse than ever, trying to fight her off. Uncle Vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around, and Mr Weasley had to shout to make himself heard.
\par \lquote Not to worry, I can sort him out!\rquote  he yelled, advancing on Dudley with his wand outstretched, but Aunt Petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top of Dudley, shielding him from Mr Weasley.
\par \lquote No, really!\rquote  said Mr Weasley desperately. \lquote It\rquote s a simple process \endash  it was the toffee \endash  my son Fred \endash  real practical joker \endash  but it\rquote s only an Engorgement Charm \endash 
 at least, I think it is \endash  please, I can correct it \endash \rquote 
\par But far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more panic-stricken; Aunt Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging Dudley\rquote s tongue as though determined to rip it out; Dudley appeared to b
e suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue, and Uncle Vernon, who had lost con\-trol completely, seized a china figure from on top of the side\-
board, and threw it very hard at Mr Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace.
\par \lquote Now really!\rquote  said Mr Weasley, angrily, brandishing his wand. \lquote I\rquote m trying to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 help!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par Bellowing like a wounded hippo, Uncle Vernon snatched up another ornament.
\par \lquote Harry, go! Just go!\rquote  Mr Weasley shouted, his wand on Uncle Vernon. \lquote I\rquote ll sort this out!\rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon\rquote s second ornament narrowly missed his left ear, and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to Mr Weasley. He stepped into the fire, looking over his shoulder as he said, 
\lquote The Burrow!\rquote ; his last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of Mr Weasley blasting a third ornament out of Uncle Vernon\rquote s hand with his wand, Aunt Petunia screaming and lying on top of Dudley, and Dudley\rquote 
s tongue lolling around like a great slimy python. But next moment Harry had begun to spin very fast, and the Dursleys\rquote  living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald green flames.

\par The tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked around and saw that Ron and George were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red-haired people Harry had never seen before, though he knew immediately who 
they must be: Bill and Charlie, the two eldest Weasley brothers.
\par \lquote How\rquote re you doing, Harry?\rquote  said the nearer of the two, grin\-ning at him and holding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers. This had to be Charli
e, who worked with dragons in Romania. Charlie was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were both long and lanky. He had a broad, good-natured face, which was weather-beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his ar
ms were muscly, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it.
\par Bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry\rquote s hand. Bill came as something of a surprise. Harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank, Gringotts, that he had been Head Boy of Hogwar
ts, and had always imagined Bill to be an older version of Percy; fussy about rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone around. However, Bill was \endash  there was no other word for it \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it. His clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert, except that Harry recognised his boots to be made, not of leather, but of dragon hide.
\par Before any of them could say anything else, there was a faint popping noise, and Mr Weasley appeared out of thin air at George\rquote s shoulder. He was looking angrier than Harry had ever seen him.

\par \lquote Tell me what?\rquote  said a voice behind them.
\par Mrs Weasley had just entered the kitchen. She was a short, plump woman with a very kind face, though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion.
\par \lquote Oh, hello, Harry dear,\rquote  she said, spotting him and smiling. Then her eyes snapped back to her husband. \lquote Tell me }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 what, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39

\par Mr Weasley hesitated. Harry could tell that, however angry he was with Fred and George, he hadn\rquote 
t really intended to tell Mrs Weasley what had happened. There was a silence, while Mr Weasley eyed his wife nervously. Then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind Mrs Weasley. One, with very bushy brown hair and
 rather large front teeth, was Harry and Ron\rquote s friend, Hermione Granger. The other, who was small and red-haired, was Ron\rquote s younger sister, Ginny. Both of them smiled at Harry, who grinned back, which made Ginny go scarlet \endash 
 she had been very taken with Harry ever since his first visit to The Burrow.

Harry asked, as they climbed.
\par Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn\rquote t.
\par \lquote Mum found this stack of order forms when she was clean\-ing Fred and George\rquote s room,\rquote  said Ron quietly. \lquote Great long price-lists for stuff they\rquote

\par \lquote We\rquote ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought they were actually }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 making }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Only, most of the stuff \endash  well, all of it, really \endash  was a bit dangerous,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote and, you know, they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money, and Mum went mad at them. Told them they weren\rquote 
t allowed to make any more of it, and burnt all the order forms ... she\rquote s furious at them any\-way. They didn\rquote t get as many O.W.Ls as she expected.\rquote 
\par O.W.Ls were Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the examinations Hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen.
\par \lquote And then there was this big row,\rquote  Ginny said, \lquote because Mum wants them to go into the Ministry of Magic like Dad, and they told her all they want to do is open a joke-shop.\rquote 
\par Just then, a door on the second landing opened, and a face poked out wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression.
\par \lquote Hi, Percy,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Oh, hello, Harry,\rquote  said Percy. \lquote I was wondering who was making all the noise. I\rquote m trying to work in here, you know \endash  I\rquote ve got a report to finish for the office \endash  and it\rquote

\par \lquote What are you working on?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote A report for the Department of International Magical Co-operation,\rquote  said Percy smugly. \lquote We\rquote re trying to standardise cauldron thickness. Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin \endash 
 leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three per cent a year \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote ll change the world, that report will,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Front page of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Daily Prophet, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Percy went slightly pink.
\par \lquote You might sneer, Ron,\rquote  he said heatedly, \lquote but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow-bottomed products which seriously endanger \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, yeah, all right,\rquote 
 said Ron, and he started off upstairs again. Percy slammed his bedroom door shut. As Harry, Hermione and Ginny followed Ron up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them. It sounded as though Mr Weasley had told 
Mrs Weasley about the toffees.
\par The room at the top of the house where Ron slept looked much as it had done the last time that Harry had come to stay; the same posters of Ron\rquote s favourite Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling and waving on the w
alls and sloping ceiling, and the fishtank on the windowsill which had previously held frog-spawn now contained one extremely large frog. Ron\rquote s old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny grey owl that had delivered Ron
\rquote s letter to Harry in Privet Drive. It was hopping up and down in a small cage, and twittering madly.
\par \lquote Shut }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 up, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Pig,\rquote 
 said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room. \lquote Fred and George are in here with us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room,\rquote  he told Harry. \lquote 
Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he\rquote s got to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 work.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par \lquote Er \endash  why are you calling that owl Pig?\rquote  Harry asked Ron.
\par \lquote Because he\rquote s being stupid,\rquote  said Ginny. \lquote Its proper name is Pigwidgeon.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, and that\rquote s not a stupid name at all,\rquote  said Ron sarcasti\-cally. \lquote Ginny named him,\rquote  he explained to Harry. \lquote She reckons it\rquote s sweet. And I tried to change it, but it was too late, he won\rquote 
t answer to anything else. So now he\rquote s Pig. I\rquote ve got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes. He annoys me, too, come to that.\rquote 
\par Pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly. Harry knew Ron too well to take him seriously. He had moaned continually about his old rat Scabbers, but had been most upset when Hermione\rquote s cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have eaten him.

\par \lquote Where\rquote s Crookshanks?\rquote  Harry asked Hermione now.
\par \lquote Out in the garden, I expect,\rquote  she said. \lquote He likes chasing gnomes, he\rquote s never seen any before.\rquote 
\par \lquote Percy\rquote s enjoying work, then?\rquote  said Harry, sitting down on one of the beds and watching the Chudley Cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceiling.
\par \lquote Enjoying it?\rquote  said Ron darkly. \lquote I don\rquote t reckon he\rquote d come home if Dad didn\rquote t make him. He\rquote s obsessed. Just don\rquote t get him onto the subject of his boss. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 According to Mr Crouch ... as I was saying to Mr Crouch ... Mr Crouch is of the opinion ... Mr Crouch was telling me ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  They\rquote ll be announcing their engagement any day now.\rquote 
\par \lquote Have you had a good summer, Harry?\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Did you get our food parcels and everything?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, thanks a lot,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote They saved my life, those cakes.\rquote 
\par \lquote And have you heard from \endash ?\rquote  Ron began, but at a look from Hermione he fell silent. Harry knew Ron had been about to ask about Sirius. Ron and Hermione had been so deeply in
volved in helping Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they were almost as concerned about Harry\rquote 
s godfather as he was. However, discussing him in front of Ginny was a bad idea. Nobody but themselves and Professor Dumbledore knew about how Sirius had escaped, or believed in his innocence.
\par \lquote I think they\rquote ve stopped arguing,\rquote  said Hermione, to cover the awkward moment, because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron to Harry. \lquote Shall we go down and help your mum with dinner?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, all right,\rquote  said Ron. The four of them left Ron\rquote s room and went back downstairs, to find Mrs Weasley alone in the kitchen, looking extremely bad-tempered.
\par \lquote We\rquote re eating out in the garden,\rquote  she said when they came in. \lquote There\rquote s just not room for eleven people in here. 
Could you take the plates outside, girls? Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables. Knives and forks, please, you two,\rquote 
 she said to Ron and Harry, pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceilings.
\par \lquote Oh, for heaven\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 sake,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
she snapped, now directing her wand at a dustpan, which hopped off the side and started skating across the floor, scooping up the potatoes. \lquote Those two!\rquote 
 she burst out savagely, now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard, and Harry knew she meant Fred and George. \lquote I don\rquote t know what\rquote s going to happen to them, I really don\rquote 
t. No ambition, unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can ...\rquote 
\par She slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it. A creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred.
\par \lquote It\rquote s not as though they haven\rquote t got brains,\rquote  she continued irritably, taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand, \lquote but they\rquote 
re wasting them, and unless they pull themselves together soon, they\rquote ll be in real trouble. I\rquote ve had more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put together. If they carry on the way they\rquote re going, they\rquote 
ll end up in front of the Improper Use of Magic Office.\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer, which shot open. Harry and Ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it, flew across the kitchen and 
began chopping the potatoes, which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know where we went wrong with them,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans. \lquote It\rquote s been the same for years, one thing after another, and they won\rquote 
t listen to \endash  OH, NOT }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 AGAIN!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par She had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse.
\par \lquote One of their fake wands again!\rquote  she shouted. \lquote How many times have I told those two not to leave them lying around?\rquote 
\par She grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove was smoking.
\par \lquote C\rquote mon,\rquote  Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer, \lquote let\rquote s go and help Bill and Charlie.\rquote 
\par They left Mrs Weasley, and headed out of the back door into the yard.
\par They had only gone a few paces when Hermione\rquote s bandy-legged, ginger cat Crookshanks came pelting out of the garden, bottle-brush tail held high in the air, chasing what looked like
 a muddy potato on legs. Harry recognised it instantly as a gnome. Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the Wellington boots that lay scattered around the door. Harr
y
 could hear the gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to reach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house. The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden an
d saw that Bill and Charlie both had their wands out, and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other, each attempting to knock the other\rquote 
s out of the air. Fred and George were cheering; Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety.
\par Bill\rquote s table caught Charlie\rquote s with a huge bang, and knocked one of its legs off. There was a clatter from overhead, and they all looked up to see Percy\rquote s head poking out of a window on the second floor.
\par \lquote Will you keep it down?\rquote  he bellowed.
\par \lquote Sorry, Perce,\rquote  said Bill, grinning. \lquote How\rquote re the cauldron bottoms coming on?\rquote 
\par \lquote Very badly,\rquote  said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the win\-dow shut again. Chuckling, Bill and Charlie directed 
the tables safely onto the grass, end to end, and then, with a flick of his wand, Bill reattached the table leg, and conjured tablecloths from nowhere.
\par By seven o\rquote clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of Mrs Weasley\rquote s excellent cookin
g, and the nine Weasleys, Harry and Hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep-blue sky. To somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise, and at first, Harry listened rather than t
alked, as he helped himself to chicken-and-ham pie, boiled potatoes and salad.
\par At the far end of the table, Percy was telling his father all about his report on cauldron bottoms.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve told Mr Crouch that I\rquote ll have it ready by Tuesday,\rquote  Percy was saying pompously. \lquote That\rquote s a bit sooner than he expected it, but I like to keep on top of things. I think he\rquote ll be grateful I\rquote 
ve done it in good time. I mean, it\rquote s extremely busy in our depart\-ment just now, what with all the arrangements for the World Cup. We\rquote re just not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical Games and Sports. Ludo Bagman 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I like Ludo,\rquote  said Mr Weasley mildly. \lquote He was the one who got us such good tickets for the Cup. I did him a bit of a favour: his brother, Otto, got into a spot of trouble \endash  a lawn-mower with unnatural powers \endash 
 I smoothed the whole thing over.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, Bagman\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 likeable }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 enough, of course,\rquote  said Percy dismiss
\-ively, \lquote but how he ever got to be Head of Department ... when I compare him to Mr Crouch! I can\rquote t see Mr Crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out what\rquote 
s happened to them. You realise Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a month now? Went on holiday to Albania and never came back?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I was asking Ludo about that,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, frowning. \lquote He says Bertha\rquote s got lost plenty of times before now \endash  though I must say, if it was someone in my department, I\rquote d be worried ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, Bertha\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 hopeless, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 all right,\rquote  said Percy. \lquote 
I hear she\rquote s been shunted from department to department for years, much more trouble than she\rquote s worth ... but all the same, Bagman ought to be trying to find her. Mr Crouch has been taking a personal interest \endash 
 she worked in our department at one time, you know, and I think Mr Crouch was quite fond of her \endash  but Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in Australia instead of Albania. However,\rquote 
 Percy heaved an impressive sigh, and took a deep swig of elderflower wine, \lquote we\rquote ve got quite enough on our plates at the Department of Inte
rnational Magical Co-operation without trying to find members of other departments too. As you know, we\rquote ve got another big event to organise right after the World Cup.\rquote 
\par He cleared his throat significantly and looked down towards the end of the table where Harry, Ron and Hermione were sit\-ting. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39

\par Ron rolled his eyes and muttered to Harry and Hermione, \lquote He\rquote s been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work. Probably an exhibition of thick-bottomed cauldrons.\rquote 
\par In the middle of the table, Mrs Weasley was arguing with Bill about his earring, which seemed to be a recent acquisition.
\par \lquote ... with a horrible great fang on it, really, Bill, what do they say at the bank?\rquote 
\par \lquote Mum, no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure,\rquote  said Bill patiently.
\par \lquote And your hair\rquote s getting silly, dear,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, finger\-ing her wand lovingly. \lquote I wish you\rquote d let me give it a trim ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I like it,\rquote  said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill. \lquote You\rquote re so old-fashioned, Mum. Anyway, it\rquote s nowhere near as long as Professor Dumbledore\rquote s ...\rquote 
\par Next to Mrs Weasley, Fred, George and Charlie were all talking spiritedly about the World Cup.
\par \lquote It\rquote s got to be Ireland,\rquote  said Charlie thickly, through a mouth\-ful of potato. \lquote They flattened Peru in the semi-finals.\rquote 
\par \lquote Bulgaria have got Viktor Krum, though,\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote Krum\rquote s one decent player, Ireland have got seven,\rquote  said Charlie shortly. \lquote I wish England had got through, though. That was embarrassing, that was.\rquote 
\par \lquote What happened?\rquote  said Harry eagerly, regretting more than ever his isolation from the wizarding world when he was stuck in Privet 
Drive. Harry was passionate about Quidditch. He had played as Seeker on the Gryffindor house Quidditch team ever since his first year at Hogwarts and owned a Firebolt, one of the best racing brooms in the world.
\par \lquote Went down to Transylvania, three hundred and ninety to ten,\rquote  said Charlie gloomily. \lquote Shocking performance. And Wales lost to Uganda, and Scotland were slaughtered by Luxembourg.\rquote 
\par Mr Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their pudding (home-made strawberry ice-cre
am), and by the time they had finished, moths were fluttering low over the table and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle. Harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprintin
g through the rose bushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks.
\par Ron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking, then he said very quietly to Harry, \lquote So \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 have }{

\par Hermione looked round, listening closely.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry softly, \lquote twice. He sounds OK. I wrote to him the day before yesterday. He might write back while I\rquote m here.\rquote 
\par He suddenly remembered the reason he had written to Sirius and, for a moment, was on the verge of telling Ron and Hermione about his scar hurting again, and about the dream which had awoken him ... but he really didn\rquote 
t want to worry them just now, not when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful.
\par \lquote Look at the time,\rquote  Mrs Weasley said suddenly, checking her wristwatch. \lquote You really should be in bed, the whole lot of you, you\rquote ll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup. Harry, if you leave your school list out, I

\par Harry felt around for his glasses, put them on and sat up. It was still dark outside. Ron muttered indistinctly as his mother roused him. At the foot of Harry\rquote s mattress he saw two large, dishevelled shapes emerging from tangles of blankets.
\par \lquote  \rquote S\rquote time already?\rquote  said Fred groggily.
\par They dressed in silence, too sleepy to talk, then, yawning and stretching, the four of them headed downstairs into the kitchen.
\par Mrs Weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot on the s
tove, while Mr Weasley was sitting at the table, checking a sheaf of large parchment tickets. He looked up as the boys entered, and spread his arms so that they could see his clothes more clearly. He was wearing what appeared to be a golfing jumper and a 
very old pair of jeans, slightly too big for him and held up with a thick leather belt.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you think?\rquote  he asked anxiously. \lquote We\rquote re supposed to go incognito \endash  do I look like a Muggle, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, smiling, \lquote very good.\rquote 
\par \lquote Where\rquote re Bill and Charlie and Per-Per-Percy?\rquote  said George, failing to stifle a huge yawn.
\par \lquote Well, they\rquote re Apparating, aren\rquote t they?\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, heaving the large pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls. \lquote So they can have a bit of a lie-in.\rquote 
\par Harry knew that Apparating was very difficult; it meant disappearing from one place and reappearing almost instantly in another.
\par \lquote So they\rquote re still in bed?\rquote  said Fred grumpily, pulling his bowl of porridge towards him. \lquote Why can\rquote t we Apparate, too?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because you\rquote re not of age and you haven\rquote t got your test,\rquote  snapped Mrs Weasley. \lquote And where have those girls got to?\rquote 
\par She bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the stairs.
\par \lquote You have to pass a test to Apparate?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote Oh yes,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, tucking the tickets safely into the back pocket of his jeans. \lquote The Department of Magical Transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for Apparating without a licence. It\rquote 
s not easy, Apparition, and when it\rquote s not done properly it can lead to nasty complications. This pair I\rquote m talking about went and splinched themselves.\rquote 
\par Everyone around the table except Harry winced.
\par \lquote Er \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 splinched?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 said Harry.
\par \lquote They left half of themselves behind,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, now spooning large amounts of treacle onto his porridge. \lquote So, of course, they were stuck. Couldn\rquote 
t move either way. Had to wait for the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to sort them out. Meant a fair old bit of paperwork, I can tell you, what with the Muggles who spotted the body parts they\rquote d left behind ...\rquote 
\par Harry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an eyeball lying abandoned on the pavement of Privet Drive.
\par \lquote Were they OK?\rquote  he asked, startled.
\par \lquote Oh yes,\rquote  said Mr Weasley matter-of-factly. \lquote But they got a heavy fine, and I don\rquote t think they\rquote ll be trying it again in a hurry. You don\rquote t mess around with Apparition. There are plenty of adult wizards who don
\rquote t bother with it. Prefer brooms \endash  slower, but safer.\rquote 
\par \lquote But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Charlie had to take the test twice,\rquote  said Fred, grinning. \lquote He failed first time, Apparated five miles south of where he meant to, right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping, remember?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, well, he passed second time,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, march\-ing back into the kitchen amid hearty sniggers.
\par \lquote Percy only passed two weeks ago,\rquote  said George. \lquote He\rquote s been Apparating downstairs every morning since, just to prove he can.\rquote 
\par There were footsteps down the passageway and Hermione and Ginny came into the kitchen, both looking pale and drowsy.
\par \lquote Why do we have to be up so early?\rquote  Ginny said, rubbing her eyes and sitting down at the table.
\par \lquote We\rquote ve got a bit of a walk,\rquote  said Mr Weasley.
\par \lquote Walk?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote What, are we walking to the World Cup?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, no, that\rquote s miles away,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, smiling. \lquote We only need to walk a short way. It\rquote s just that it\rquote 
s very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting Muggle attention. We have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times, and on a huge occasion like the Quidditch World Cup \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote George!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley sharply, and they all jumped.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said George, in an innocent tone that deceived nobody.
\par \lquote What is that in your pocket?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nothing!\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you lie to me!\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley pointed her wand at George\rquote s pocket and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Accio!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Several small, brightly coloured objects zoomed out of George\rquote s pocket; he made a grab for them but missed, and they sped right into Mrs Weasley\rquote s outstretched hand.
\par \lquote We told you to destroy them!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley furiously, holding up what were unmistakeably more Ton-Tongue Toffees. \lquote We told you to get rid of the lot! Empty your pockets, go on, both of you!\rquote 
\par It was an unpleasant scene; the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle as many toffees out of the house as possible, and it was only by using her Summoning Charm that Mrs Weasley managed to find them all.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Accio! Accio! Accio!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
she shouted, and toffees zoomed from all sorts of unlikely places, including the lining of George\rquote s jacket and the turn-ups of Fred\rquote s jeans.
\par \lquote We spent six months developing those!\rquote  Fred shouted at his mother, as she threw the toffees away.
\par \lquote Oh, a fine way to spend six months!\rquote  she shrieked. \lquote No won\-der you didn\rquote t get more O.W.Ls!\rquote 
\par All in all, the atmosphere was not very friendly as they made their departure. Mrs W
easley was still glowering as she kissed Mr Weasley on the cheek, though not nearly as much as the twins, who had each hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs and walked out without a word to her.
\par \lquote Well, have a lovely time,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, \lquote and }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 behave yourselves,\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  she called after the twins\rquote  retreating backs, but they did not look back or answer. \lquote I\rquote ll send Bill, Charlie and Percy along around midday,\rquote 
 Mrs Weasley said to Mr Weasley, as he, Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny set off across the dark yard after Fred and George.
\par It was chilly and the moon was still out. Only a dull, green\-ish tinge along the horizon to their right showed that daybreak was drawing closer. Harry, having been thinking about thousands of wizards speeding towards the Quidditch World
 Cup, sped up to walk with Mr Weasley.
\par \lquote So how }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 does}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  everyone get there without all the Muggles noticing?\rquote 
 he asked.
\par \lquote It\rquote s been a massive organisational problem,\rquote  sighed Mr Weasley. \lquote The trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up to the World Cup, and of course we just haven\rquote 
t got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all. There are places Muggles can\rquote t penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three-quarters. So we had to find a
 nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti-Muggle precautions as possible. The whole Ministry\rquote 
s been working on it for months. Firstly, of course, we have to stagger the arrivals. People with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand. A limited number use Muggle transport, but we can\rquote 
t have too many clogging up their buses and trains \endash  remember, wizards are coming from all over the world. Some Apparate, of course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well away from Muggles. I believe there\rquote 
s a handy wood they\rquote re using as the Apparition point. For those who don\rquote t want to Apparate, or can\rquote t, we use Portkeys. They\rquote 
re objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time. You can do large groups at
 a time if you need to. There have been two hundred Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain, and the nearest one to us is up the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that\rquote s where we\rquote re headed.\rquote 
\par Mr Weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large black mass rose beyond the village of Ottery St Catchpole.
\par \lquote What sort of objects are Portkeys?\rquote  said Harry curiously.
\par \lquote Well, they can be anything,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote Unobtrusive things, obviously, so Muggles don\rquote t go picking them up and playing with them ... stuff they\rquote ll just think is litter ...\rquote 
\par They trudged down the dark, dank lane towards the village, the silence broken only by their footsteps. The sky lightened very slowly as they made their way through the village, its inky blackness diluting to deepest blue. Harry\rquote 
s hands and feet were freezing. Mr Weasley kept checking his watch.
\par They didn\rquote t have breath to spare for talking as they began to climb Stoatshead Hill, stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit holes, slipping on thick black tuffets of grass. Each breath 
Harry took was sharp in his chest, and his legs were starting to seize up when at last his feet found level ground.
\par \lquote Whew,\rquote  panted Mr Weasley, taking off his glasses and wiping them on his sweater. \lquote Well, we\rquote ve made good time \endash  we\rquote ve got ten minutes ...\rquote 
\par Hermione came over the crest of the hill last, clutching a stitch in her side.
\par \lquote Now we just need the Portkey,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, replacing his glasses and squinting around at the ground. \lquote It won\rquote t be big ... come on ...\rquote 
\par They spread out, searching. They had only been at it for a couple of minutes, however, when a shout rent the still air.
\par \lquote Over here, Arthur! Over here, son, we\rquote ve got it!\rquote 
\par Two tall figures were silhouetted against the starry sky on the other side of the hilltop.
\par \lquote Amos!\rquote  said Mr Weasley, smiling as he strode over to the man who had shouted. The rest of them followed.
\par Mr Weasley was shaking hands with a ruddy-faced wizard with a scrubby brown beard, who was holding a mouldy-looking old boot in his other hand.
\par \lquote This is Amos Diggory, everyone,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote Works for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. And I think you know his son, Cedric?\rquote 
\par Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen. He was captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff house Quidditch team at Hogwarts.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  said Cedric, looking around at them all.
\par Everybody said \lquote Hi\rquote  back except Fred and George, who merely nodded. They had never quite forgiven Cedric for beat\-ing their team, Gryffindor, in the first Quidditch match of the previous year.
\par \lquote Long walk, Arthur?\rquote  Cedric\rquote s father asked.
\par \lquote Not too bad,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote We live just on the other side of the village there. You?\rquote 
\par \lquote Had to get up at two, didn\rquote t we, Ced? I tell you, I\rquote ll be glad when he\rquote s got his Apparition test. Still ... not complaining ... Quidditch World Cup, wouldn\rquote t miss it for a sackful of Galleons \endash 
 and the tickets cost about that. Mind you, looks like I got off easy ...\rquote  Amos Diggory peered good-naturedly around at the three Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione and Ginny. \lquote All these yours, Arthur?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, no, only the redheads,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, pointing out his children. \lquote This is Hermione, friend of Ron\rquote s \endash  and Harry, another friend \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Merlin\rquote s beard,\rquote  said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening. \lquote Harry? Harry }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Potter?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par \lquote Er \endash  yeah,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it always made him feel uncomfortable.
\par \lquote Ced\rquote s talked about you, of course,\rquote  said Amos Diggory. \lquote Told us all about playing against you last year ... I said to him, I said \endash  Ced, that\rquote ll be something to tell your grandchildren, that will ... }{

\par Harry couldn\rquote t think of any reply to this, so he remained silent. Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.
\par \lquote Harry fell off his broom, Dad,\rquote  he muttered. \lquote I told you ... it was an accident ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, but }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 didn\rquote t fall off, did you?\rquote 
 roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back. \lquote Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman ... but the best man won, I\rquote m sure Harry\rquote d say the same, wouldn\rquote t you, eh? One falls off his broom, one stays on, you don
\rquote t need to be a genius to tell which one\rquote s the better flier!\rquote 
\par \lquote Must be nearly time,\rquote  said Mr Weasley quickly, pulling out his watch again. \lquote Do you know whether we\rquote re waiting for any more, Amos?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts couldn\rquote t get tickets,\rquote  said Mr Diggory. \lquote There aren\rquote t any more of us in this area, are there?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not that I know of,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote Yes, it\rquote s a minute off ... we\rquote d better get ready.
\par He looked around at Harry and Hermione. \lquote You just need to touch the Portkey, that\rquote s all, a finger will do \endash \rquote 
\par With difficulty, owing to the bulky backpacks, the nine of them crowded around the old boot held out by Amos Diggory.
\par They all stood there, in a tight circle, as a chill breeze swept over the hilltop. Nobody spoke. It suddenly occurred to Harry how odd this would look if a Muggle were to walk up here now ... nine
 people, two grown men, clutching this manky old boot in the semi-darkness, waiting ...
\par \lquote Three ...\rquote  muttered Mr Weasley, one eye still on his watch, \lquote two ... one ...\rquote 
\par It happened immediately: Harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had been sudde
nly jerked irresistibly forwards. His feet had left the ground; he could feel Ron and Hermione on either side of him, their shoulders banging into his; they were all speeding forwards in a howl of wind and swirling colour; his forefinger was stuck to the 
boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onwards and then \endash 
\par His feet slammed into the ground; Ron staggered into him and he fell over; the Portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud.
\par Harry looked up. Mr Weasley, Mr Diggory and Cedric were still standing, though looking very windswept; everybody else was on the ground.
\par \lquote Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill,\rquote  said a voice.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

pertly; the man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thigh-length galoshes; his colleague, a kilt and a poncho.

 said Mr Weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys beside him; Harry could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can and a punctured football.

\par \lquote Thanks, Basil,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, and he beckoned everyone to follow him.
\par They set off across the deserted moor, unable to make out much through the mist. After about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next 
to a gate swam into view. Beyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field towards a dark wood on the horizon. They said goodbye to the Diggorys, and approached the cott
age door.
\par A man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents. Harry knew at a glance that this was the only real Muggle for several acres. When he heard their footsteps, he turned his head to look at them.
\par \lquote Morning!\rquote  said Mr Weasley brightly.
\par \lquote Morning,\rquote  said the Muggle.

\par \lquote You\rquote re not the first one who\rquote s had trouble with money,\rquote  said Mr Roberts, scrutinising Mr Weasley closely. \lquote I had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago.\rquote 
\par \lquote Did you really?\rquote  said Mr Weasley nervously.
\par Mr Roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change.
\par \lquote Never been this crowded,\rquote  he said suddenly, looking out over the misty field again. \lquote Hundreds of pre-bookings. People usually just turn up ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Is that right?\rquote  said Mr Weasley, his hand held out for his change, but Mr Roberts didn\rquote t give it to him.
\par \lquote Aye,\rquote  he said thoughtfully. \lquote People from all over. Loads of foreigners. And not just foreigners. Weirdos, you know? There\rquote s a bloke walking round in a kilt and a poncho.\rquote 
\par \lquote Shouldn\rquote t he?\rquote  said Mr Weasley anxiously.
\par \lquote It\rquote s like some sort of ... I dunno ... like some sort of rally,\rquote  said Mr Roberts. \lquote They all seem to know each other. Like a big party.\rquote 
\par At that moment, a wizard in plus-fours appeared out of thin air next to Mr Roberts\rquote s front door.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Obliviate!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 he said sharply, pointing his wand at Mr Roberts.

\par Instantly, Mr Roberts\rquote s eyes slid out of focus, his brows unknitted and a look of dreamy unconcern fell over his face. Harry recognised the symptoms of one who had just had his memory modified.
\par \lquote A map of the campsite for you,\rquote  Mr Roberts said placidly to Mr Weasley. \lquote And your change.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks very much,\rquote  said Mr Weasley.
\par The wizard in plus-fours accompanied them towards the gate to the campsite. He looked exhausted; his chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes. Once out of earshot of Mr Roberts, he muttered to Mr Weasley, \lquote 
Been having a lot of trouble with him. Needs a Memory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy. And Ludo Bagman\rquote s not helping. Trotting around talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice, not a wor
ry about anti-Muggle security. Blimey, I\rquote ll be glad when this is over. See you later, Arthur.\rquote 
\par He Disapparated.
\par \lquote I thought Mr Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports?\rquote  said Ginny, looking surprised. \lquote He should know better than to talk about Bludgers near Muggles, shouldn\rquote t he?\rquote 
\par \lquote He should,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, smiling, and leading them through the gates into the campsite, \lquote but Ludo\rquote s always been a bit ... well ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
lax }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 about security. You couldn\rquote t wish for a more enth
usiastic Head of the Sports Department, though. He played Quidditch for England himself, you know. And he was the best Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had.\rquote 
\par They trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents. Most looked almost ordinary; their owne
rs had clearly tried to make them as Muggle-like as possible, but had slipped up by adding chimneys, or bell-pulls, or weather-vanes. However, here and there was a tent so obviously magical that Harry could hardly be surprised that Mr Roberts was getting 
suspi\-
cious. Halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace, with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance. A little further on they passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets; and a short way
 beyond that was a tent which had a front garden attached, complete with birdbath, sundial and fountain.
\par \lquote Always the same,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, smiling, \lquote we can\rquote t resist showing off when we get together. Ah, here we are, look, this is us.\rquote 
\par They had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field, and here was an empty space, with a small sign hammered into the ground that read \lquote Weezly\rquote .
\par \lquote Couldn\rquote t have a better spot!\rquote  said Mr Weasley happily. \lquote The pitch is just on the other side of the wood there, we\rquote re as close as we could be.\rquote  He hoisted his backpack from his shoulders. \lquote Right,\rquote 
 he said excitedly, \lquote no magic allowed, strictly speaking, not when we\rquote re out in these numbers on Muggle land. We\rquote ll be putting these tents up by hand! Shouldn\rquote t be too difficu
lt ... Muggles do it all the time ... here, Harry, where do you reckon we should start?\rquote 
\par Harry had never been camping in his life; the Dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday, preferring to leave him with Mrs Figg, an old neighbour. However, he
 and Hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go, and though Mr Weasley was more of a hindrance than a help, because he got thoroughly over-excited when it came to using the mallet, they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby two-man
 tents.
\par All of them stood back to admire their handiwork. Nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards, Harry thought, but the trouble was that once Bill, Charlie and Percy arrived, they would be a party of ten. Hermione seemed to have
 spotted this problem, too; she gave Harry a quizzical look as Mr Weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll be a bit cramped,\rquote  he called, \lquote but I think we\rquote ll all squeeze in. Come and have a look.\rquote 
\par Harry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt his jaw drop. He had walked into what looked like an old-fashioned, three-roomed flat, complete with bathroom and kitchen. Oddly enough, it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as Mrs Figg
\rquote s; there were crocheted covers on the mismatched chairs, and a strong smell of cats.
\par \lquote Well, it\rquote s not for long,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, mopping his bald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom. \lquote I borrowed this from Perkins at the office. Doesn\rquote 
t camp much any more, poor fellow, he\rquote s got lumbago.\rquote 
\par He picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it. \lquote We\rquote ll need water ...\rquote 
\par \lquote There\rquote s a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave us,\rquote  said Ron, who had followed Harry inside the tent, and seemed completely unimpressed by its extraordinary inner propor\-tions. \lquote It\rquote s on the other side of the field.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, why don\rquote t you, Harry and Hermione go and get us some water, then \endash \rquote  Mr Weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans, \lquote \endash  and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire.\rquote 
\par \lquote But we\rquote ve got an oven,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote why can\rquote t we just \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron, anti-Muggle security!\rquote  said Mr Weasley, his face shining with anticipation. \lquote When real Muggles camp, they cook on fires outdoors, I\rquote ve seen them at it!\rquote 
\par After a quick tour of the girls\rquote  tent, which was slightly small\-er than the boys\rquote , though without the smell of cats, Harry, Ron and Hermione set off across the campsite with the kettle and saucepans.
\par Now, with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting, they could see t
he city of tents that stretched in every direction. They made their way slowly through the rows, staring eagerly around. It was only just dawning on Harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world; he had never really thought much about thos
e in other countries.
\par Their fellow campers were starting to wake up. First to stir were the families with small children; Harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before. A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid-shaped te
nt, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami. As they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote How}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  many times, Kevin? You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par She had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her scold\-ing carried after them on the still air, mingling with the little boy\rquote s yells \endash  \lquote You bust slug! You bust slug!\rquote 
\par A short way further on, they saw two little witches, barely older than Kevin, who were riding toy broomsticks which rose only high enough for the girls\rquote 
 toes to skim the dewy grass. A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past Harry, Ron and Hermione, he muttered distractedly, \lquote In broad daylight! Parents having a lie-in, I suppose \endash \rquote 
\par Here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast. Some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires with their wands; others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces, as thoug
h sure this couldn\rquote t work. Three African wizards sat in serious conversation, all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire, while a group of middle-aged American witches sat gos\-
siping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their tents which read: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 The Salem Witches\rquote  Institute. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Harry caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed, and though he couldn\rquote t understand a single word, the tone of every single voice was excited.
\par \lquote Er \endash  is it my eyes, or has everything gone green?\rquote  said Ron.
\par It wasn\rquote t just Ron\rquote s eyes. They had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though small, oddly shaped h
illocks had sprouted out of the earth. Grinning faces could be seen under those which had their flaps open. Then, from behind them, they heard their names.
\par \lquote Harry! Ron! Hermione!\rquote 
\par It was Seamus Finnigan, their fellow Gryffindor fourth-year. He was sitting in front of his own shamrock-covered tent, with a sandy-haired woman who had to be his mother, and his best friend, Dean Thomas, also of Gryffindor.
\par \lquote Like the decorations?\rquote  said Seamus, grinning, when Harry, Ron and Hermione had gone over to say hello. \lquote The Ministry\rquote s not too happy.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, why shouldn\rquote t we show our colours?\rquote  said Mrs Finnigan. \lquote You should see what the Bulgarians have got dan\-gling all over }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 their }{

\par When they had assured her that they were indeed support\-ing Ireland, they set off again, though, as Ron said, \lquote Like we\rquote d say anything else surrounded by that lot.\rquote 
\par \lquote I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s go and have a look,\rquote  said Harry, pointing to a large patch of tents upheld, where the Bulgarian flag, red, green and white, was fluttering in the breeze.
\par The tents here had not been bedecked with plant life, but each and every one of them had the same poster attached to it, a poster of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows. The picture was of course moving, but all it did was blink and scowl.
\par \lquote Krum,\rquote  said Ron quietly.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Krum!\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker!\rquote 
\par \lquote He looks really grumpy,\rquote  said Hermione, looking around at the many Krums blinking and scowling at them.

\par There was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field. Harry, Ron and Hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument. One of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery night\-
gown. The other was clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.
\par \lquote Just put them on, Archie, there\rquote s a good chap, you can\rquote t walk around like that, the Muggle on the gate\rquote s already getting suspicious \endash \rquote

\par \lquote I\rquote m not putting them on,\rquote  said old Archie in indignation. \lquote I like a healthy breeze round my privates, thanks.\rquote 
\par Hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue, and only returned when Archie had collected his water and moved away again.
\par Walking more slowly now, because of the weight of the water, they made their way back through the campsite. Here and there they saw more familiar faces: other Hogwarts students with their families. Oliver Wood, the old captain of Harry\rquote 
s house Quidditch team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged Harry over to his parents\rquote  tent to introduce him, and told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team. Nex
t they were hailed by Ernie Macmillan, a Hufflepuff fourth-year, and a little further on they saw Cho Chang, a very pretty girl who played Seeker on the Ravenclaw team. She waved and smiled at Harry, who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he w
aved back. More to stop Ron smirking than anything, Harry hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen before.
\par \lquote Who d\rquote you reckon they are?\rquote  he said. They don\rquote t go to Hogwarts, do they?\rquote 
\par \lquote  \rquote Spect they go to some foreign school,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote 
I know there are others, never met anyone who went to one though. Bill had a pen-friend at a school in Brazil ... this was years and years ago ... and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad couldn\rquote t afford it. His pen-friend got all o
ffended when he said he wasn\rquote t going and sent him a cursed hat. It made his ears shrivel up.\rquote 
\par Harry laughed, but didn\rquote t voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other wizarding schools. He supposed, now he saw representatives of so many nationalities in the campsite, that he had been stupid never to realise that Hogwarts couldn\rquote 
t be the only one. He glanced at Hermione, who looked utterly unsurprised by the information. No doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or other.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve been ages,\rquote  said George, when they finally got back to the Weasleys\rquote  tents.
\par \lquote Met a few people,\rquote  said Ron, setting the water down. \lquote You not got that fire started yet?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dad\rquote s having fun with the matches,\rquote  said Fred.
\par Mr Weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but it wasn\rquote t for lack of trying. Splintered matches littered the ground around him, but he looked as though he was having the time of his life.
\par \lquote Oops!\rquote  he said, as he managed to light a match, and prompt\-ly dropped it in surprise.
\par \lquote Come here, Mr Weasley,\rquote  said Hermione kindly, taking the box from him, and starting to show him how to do it properly.
\par At last, they got the fire lit, though it was at least another hour before it was hot enough to cook anything. There was plen
ty to watch while they waited, however. Their tent seemed to be pitched right alongside a kind of thoroughfare to the pitch, and Ministry members kept hurrying up and down it, greeting Mr Weasley cordially as they passed. Mr Weasley kept up a running comm
entary, mainly for Harry and Hermione\rquote s benefit; his own children knew too much about the Ministry to be greatly interested.
\par \lquote That was Cuthbert Mockridge, Head of the Goblin Liaison Office ... here comes Gilbert Wimple, he\rquote s with the Committee on Experimental Charms, he\rquote s had those horns for a while now ... Hello, Arnie ... Arnold Peasegood, he\rquote 
s an Obliviator \endash  member of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, you know ... and that\rquote s Bode and Croaker ... they\rquote re Unspeakables \'85\rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote re what?\rquote 
\par \lquote From the Department of Mysteries, top-secret, no idea what they get up to ...\rquote 
\par At last, the fire was ready, and they had just started cooking eggs and sausages when Bill, Charlie and Percy came strolling out of the woods towards them.
\par \lquote Just Apparated, Dad,\rquote  said Percy loudly. \lquote Ah, excellent, lunch!\rquote 
\par They were halfway through their plates of sausages and eggs when Mr Weasley jumped to his feet, waving and grinning at a man who was striding towards them. \lquote Aha!\rquote  he said. \lquote The man of the moment! Ludo!\rquote 
\par Ludo Bagman was easily the most noticeable person Harry had seen so far, even including old Archie in his flowered nightdress. He was wearing long Quidditch robes in thick hori\-
zontal strips of bright yellow and black. An enormous picture of a wasp was splashed ac
ross his chest. He had the look of a powerfully built man gone slightly to seed; the robes were stretched tightly across a large belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played Quidditch for England. His nose was squashed (probably broken by a 
stray Bludger, Harry thought), but his round blue eyes, short blond hair and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy.
\par \lquote Ahoy there!\rquote  Bagman called happily. He was walking as though he had springs attached to the balls of his feet, and was plainly in a state of wild excitement.
\par \lquote Arthur, old man,\rquote  he puffed, as he reached the campfire, \lquote what a day, eh? What a day! Could we have asked for more perfect weather? A cloudless night coming ... and hardly a hiccough in the arrangements ... not much for me to do!
\rquote 
\par Behind him, a group of haggard-looking Ministry wizards rushed past, pointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire which was sending violet sparks twenty feet into the air.
\par Percy hurried forwards with his hand outstretched. Apparently his disapproval of the way Ludo Bagman ran his department did not prevent him wanting to make a good impression.
\par \lquote Ah \endash  yes,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, grinning, \lquote this is my son, Percy, he\rquote s just started at the Ministry \endash  and this is Fred \endash  no, George, sorry \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Bagman did the smallest of double-takes when he heard Harry\rquote s name, and his eyes performed the familiar flick upwards to the scar on Harry\rquote s forehead.
\par \lquote Everyone,\rquote  Mr Weasley continued, \lquote this is Ludo Bagman, you know who he is, it\rquote s thanks to him we\rquote ve got such good tickets \endash \rquote 
\par Bagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothing.
\par \lquote Fancy a flutter on the match, Arthur?\rquote  he said eagerly, jin\-gling what seemed to be a large amount of gold in the pockets of his yellow and black robes. \lquote I\rquote ve already got Roddy Pontner betting me Bulgaria will score first 
\endash  I offered him nice odds, considering Ireland\rquote s front three are the strongest I\rquote ve seen in years \endash  and little Agatha Timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a week-long match.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh ... go on, then,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote Let\rquote s see ... a Galleon on Ireland to win?\rquote 
\par \lquote A Galleon?\rquote  Ludo Bagman looked slightly disappointed, but recovered himself. \lquote Very well, very well ... any other takers?\rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote re a bit young to be gambling,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote Molly wouldn\rquote t like \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote ll bet thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, three Knuts,\rquote  said Fred, as he and George quickly pooled all their money, \lquote that Ireland win \endash  but Viktor Krum gets the Snitch. Oh, and we\rquote ll throw in a fake wand.
\rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t want to go showing Mr Bagman rubbish like that \endash \rquote  Percy hissed, but Bagman didn\rquote t seem to think the wand was rubbish at all; on the contrary, his boyi
sh face shone with excitement as he took it from Fred, and when the wand gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken, Bagman roared with laughter.
\par \lquote Excellent! I haven\rquote t seen one that convincing in years! I\rquote d pay five Galleons for that!\rquote 
\par Percy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval.
\par \lquote Boys,\rquote  said Mr Weasley under his breath, \lquote I don\rquote t want you betting ... that\rquote s all your savings ... your mother \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be a spoilsport, Arthur!\rquote  boomed Ludo Bagman, rattling his pockets excitedly. \lquote They\rquote re old enough to know what they want! You reckon Ireland will win but Krum\rquote 
ll get the Snitch? Not a chance, boys, not a chance ... I\rquote ll give you excellent odds on that one ... we\rquote ll add five Galleons for the funny wand, then, shall we ...\rquote 
\par Mr Weasley looked on helplessly as Ludo Bagman whipped out a notebook and quill and began jotting down the twins\rquote  names.
\par \lquote Cheers,\rquote  said George, taking the slip of parchment Bagman handed him and tucking it away carefully.
\par Bagman turned most cheerfully back to Mr Weasley. \lquote Couldn\rquote t do me a brew, I suppose? I\rquote m keeping an eye out for Barty Crouch. My Bulgarian opposite number\rquote s making difficulties, and I can\rquote t understand a word he\rquote 
s saying. Barty\rquote ll be able to sort it out. He speaks about a hundred and fifty languages.\rquote 
\par \lquote Mr Crouch?\rquote  said Percy, suddenly abandoning his look of poker-stiff disapproval and positively writhing with excite\-ment. \lquote He speaks over two hundred! Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Anyone can speak Troll,\rquote  said Fred dismissively, \lquote all you have to do is point and grunt.\rquote 
\par Percy threw Fred an extremely nasty look, and stoked the fire vigorously to bring the kettle back to the boil.
\par \lquote Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet, Ludo?\rquote  Mr Weasley asked, as Bagman settled himself down on the grass beside them all.
\par \lquote Not a dicky bird,\rquote  said Bagman comfortably. \lquote But she\rquote ll turn up. Poor old Bertha ... memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction. Lost, you take my word for it. She\rquote 
ll wander back into the office some time in October, thinking it\rquote s still July.\rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t think it might be time to send someone to look for her?\rquote  Mr Weasley suggested tentatively, as Percy handed Bagman his tea.
\par \lquote Barty Crouch keeps saying that,\rquote  said Bagman, his round eyes widening innocently, \lquote but we really can\rquote t spare anyone at the moment. Oh \endash  talk of the devil! Barty!\rquote 
\par A wizard had just Apparated at their fireside, and he could not have made more of a contrast with Ludo Bagman, sprawled on the grass in his old Wasp robes. Barty Crouch was a stiff, upright, elderly man, dressed in
 an impeccably crisp suit and tie. The parting in his short grey hair was almost unnaturally straight and his narrow toothbrush moustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide-rule. His shoes were very highly polished. Harry could see at once why P
e
rcy idolised him. Percy was a great believer in rigidly following rules, and Mr Crouch had complied with the rule about Muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have passed as a bank manager; Harry doubted even Uncle Vernon would have spotted him for w
hat he really was.
\par \lquote Pull up a bit of grass, Barty,\rquote  said Ludo brightly, patting the ground beside him.
\par \lquote No, thank you, Ludo,\rquote  said Crouch, and there was a bite of impatience in his voice. \lquote I\rquote ve been looking for you everywhere. The Bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the Top Box.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 what they\rquote re after?\rquote  said Bagman. \lquote 
I thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers. Bit of a strong accent.\rquote 
\par \lquote Mr Crouch!\rquote  said Percy breathlessly, sunk into a kind of half bow which made him look like a hunchback. \lquote Would you like a cup of tea?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Mr Crouch, looking over at Percy in mild surprise. \lquote Yes \endash  thank you, Weatherby.\rquote 
\par Fred and George choked into their own cups. Percy, very pink around the ears, busied himself with the kettle.
\par \lquote Oh, and I\rquote ve been wanting a word with you, too, Arthur,\rquote  said Mr Crouch, his sharp eyes falling upon Mr Weasley. \lquote Ali Bashir\rquote s on the warpath. He wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets.\rquote 

\par Mr Weasley heaved a deep sigh. \lquote I sent him an owl about that just last week. If I\rquote ve told him once I\rquote ve told him a hun\-
dred times: carpets are defined as a Muggle Artefact by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects, but will he listen?\rquote 
\par \lquote I doubt it,\rquote  said Mr Crouch, accepting a cup from Percy. \lquote He\rquote s desperate to export here.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, they\rquote ll never replace brooms in Britain, will they?\rquote  said Bagman.
\par \lquote Ali thinks there\rquote s a niche in the market for a family vehicle,\rquote  said Mr Crouch. \lquote I remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve \endash  but that was before carpets were banned, of course.\rquote 
\par He spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the law.
\par \lquote So, been keeping busy, Barty?\rquote  said Bagman breezily.
\par \lquote Fairly,\rquote  said Mr Crouch drily. \lquote Organising Portkeys across five continents is no mean feat, Ludo.\rquote 
\par \lquote I expect you\rquote ll both be glad when this is over?\rquote  said Mr Weasley.
\par Ludo Bagman looked shocked. \lquote Glad! Don\rquote t know when I\rquote ve had more fun ... still, it\rquote s not as though we haven\rquote t got anything to look forward to, eh, Barty? Eh? Plenty left to organise, eh?\rquote 
\par Mr Crouch raised his eyebrows at Bagman. \lquote We agreed not to make the announcement until all the details \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, details!\rquote  said Bagman, waving the word away like a cloud of midges. \lquote They\rquote ve signed, haven\rquote t they? They\rquote ve agreed, haven\rquote t they? I bet you anything these kids\rquote 
ll know soon enough anyway. I mean, it\rquote s happening at Hogwarts \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ludo, we need to meet the Bulgarians, you know,\rquote  said Mr Crouch sharply, cutting Bagman\rquote s remarks short. \lquote Thank you for the tea, Weatherby.\rquote 
\par He pushed his undrunk tea back at Percy and waited for Ludo to rise; Bagman struggled to his feet again, swigging down the last of his tea, the gold in his pockets chinking merrily.
\par \lquote See you all later!\rquote  he said. \lquote You\rquote ll be up in the Top Box with me \endash  I\rquote m commentating!\rquote  He waved, Barty Crouch nodded curtly, and both of them Disapparated.
\par \lquote What\rquote s happening at Hogwarts, Dad?\rquote  said Fred at once. \lquote What were they talking about?\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote ll find out soon enough,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, smiling.
\par \lquote It\rquote s classified information, until such time as the Ministry decides to release it,\rquote  said Percy stiffly. \lquote Mr Crouch was quite right not to disclose it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, shut up, Weatherby.\rquote  said Fred.
\par A sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the afternoon wore on. By dusk, the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation, and as dark\-ness spread like a curtain over the thousands of waiting wiz\-
ards, the last vestiges of pretence disappeared: the Ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable, and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywhere.
\par Salesmen were Apparating every few feet, carrying trays and pushing carts full of extraordinary merchandise. There were luminous rosettes \endash  green for Ireland, red for Bulgaria \endash 
 which were squealing the names of the players, pointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that really roared, flags from both countries which played their national anthems as they were 
waved; there were tiny models of Firebolts, which really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves.
\par \lquote Been saving my pocket money all summer for this,\rquote  Ron told Harry, as they and Hermi
one strolled through the salesmen, buying souvenirs. Though Ron purchased himself a dancing-shamrock hat and a large green rosette, he also bought a small figure of Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker. The miniature Krum walked backwards and forwards over R
on\rquote s hand, scowling up at the green rosette above him.
\par \lquote Wow, look at these!\rquote  said Harry, hurrying over to a cart piled high with what looked like brass binoculars, except that they were covered in all sorts of weird knobs and dials.
\par \lquote Omnioculars,\rquote  said the saleswizard eagerly. \lquote You can replay action ... slow everything down ... and they flash up a play-by-play breakdown if you need it. Bargain \endash  ten Galleons each.\rquote 
\par \lquote Wish I hadn\rquote t bought this now,\rquote  said Ron, gesturing at his dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at the Omnioculars.
\par \lquote Three pairs,\rquote  said Harry firmly to the wizard.
\par \lquote No \endash  don\rquote t bother,\rquote  said Ron, going red. He was always touchy about the fact that Harry, who had inherited a small fortune from his parents, had much more money than he did.
\par \lquote You won\rquote t be getting anything for Christmas,\rquote  Harry told him, thrusting Omnioculars into his and Hermione\rquote s hands. \lquote For about ten years, mind.\rquote 
\par \lquote Fair enough,\rquote  said Ron, grinning.
\par \lquote Oooh, thanks, Harry,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote And I\rquote ll get us some programmes, look \endash \rquote 
\par Their money bags considerably lighter, they went back to the tents. Bill, Charlie and Ginny were all sporting green rosettes too, and Mr Weasley was carrying an Irish flag. Fred and George had no souvenirs as they had given Bagman all their gold.
\par And then a deep, booming gong sounded somewhere beyond the woods, and, at once, green and red lanterns blazed into life in the trees, lighting a path to the pitch.
\par \lquote It\rquote s time!\rquote  said Mr Weasley, looking as excited as any of them. \lquote Come on, let\rquote s go!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

Clutching their purchases, Mr Weasley in the lead, they all hurried into the wood, following the lantern-lit trail. They could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them, shouts and laughter, snatches of singing. The atmos\-
phere of feverish excitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn\rquote t stop grinning. They walked through the wood for twenty minutes, talking and joking loudly, until at last they emerged on the other side, and found themselves in the shad\-ow of 
a gigantic stadium. Though Harry could see only a frac\-tion of the immense gold walls surrounding the pitch, he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it.

 said Mr Weasley, spotting the awestruck look on Harry\rquote s face. \lquote Ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year. Muggle-Repelling Charms on every inch of it. Every time Muggles have got any\-

 he added fondly, leading the way towards the nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards.
\par \lquote Prime seats!\rquote  said the Ministry witch at the entrance, when she checked their tickets. \lquote Top Box! Straight upstairs, Arthur, and as high as you can go.\rquote 
\par The stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple. They clambered upwards with the rest of the crowd, which slowly filtered away through doors into the stands to their left and right. Mr Weasley\rquote 
s party kept climbing, and at last they reached the top of the staircase, and found themselves in a small box, set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goalp
osts. About twenty purple-and-gilt chairs stood in two rows here, and Harry, filing into the front seats with the Weasleys, looked down upon a scene the like of which he could never have imagined.
\par A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their pl
aces in the seats which rose in levels around the long oval pitch. Everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light that seemed to come from the stadium itself. The pitch looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position. At either end of the pitch 
stood three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite them, almost at Harry\rquote s eye level, was a gigantic blackboard. Gold writ\-ing kept dashing across it as though an invisible giant\rquote 
s hand was scrawling upon it and then wiping it off again; watching it, Harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the pitch.

\par Harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them. The creature, whose 
legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair, was wearing a tea-towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in its hands. Yet those long, bat-like ears were oddly familiar ...
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Dobby?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 said Harry incredulously.
\par The tiny creature looked up and parted its fingers, revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato. It wasn\rquote t Dobby \endash  it was, however, unmistakeably a house-elf, as Harry\rquote 
s friend Dobby had been. Harry had set Dobby free from his old owners, the Malfoy family.
\par \lquote Did sir just call me Dobby?\rquote  squeaked the elf curiously, from between its fingers. Its voice was higher even than Dobby\rquote s had been, a teeny, quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected \endash 
 though it was very hard to tell with a house-elf \endash 
 that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr Weasley looked around in interest.
\par \lquote Sorry,\rquote  Harry told the elf, \lquote I just thought you were someone I knew.\rquote 
\par \lquote But I knows Dobby too, sir!\rquote  squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face, as though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not brightly lit. \lquote My name is Winky, sir \endash  and you, sir \endash \rquote 
 her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon Harry\rquote s scar, \lquote you is surely Harry Potter!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I am,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!\rquote  she said, lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck.
\par \lquote How is he?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote How\rquote s freedom suiting him?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, sir,\rquote  said Winky, shaking her head, \lquote ah, sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but I is not sure you did Dobby a favour, sir, when you is setting him free.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why?\rquote  said Harry, taken aback. \lquote What\rquote s wrong with him?\rquote

\par \lquote Why not?\rquote  said Harry.
\par Winky lowered her voice by a half octave and whispered, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote He is wanting paying for his work, sir.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Winky looked quite horrified at the idea, and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was half-hidden again.
\par \lquote House-elves is not paid, sir!\rquote  she said in a muffled squeak.
\par \lquote 
No, no, no. I says to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby. He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-elf. You goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear you
\rquote s up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, like some common goblin.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, it\rquote s about time he had a bit of fun,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote House-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry Potter,\rquote  said Winky firmly, from behind her hands. \lquote House-elves does what they is told. I is not liking heights at all, Harry Potter \endash \rquote 
 she glanced towards the edge of the box and gulped, \lquote \endash  but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why\rquote s he sent you up here, if he knows you don\rquote t like heights?\rquote  said Harry, frowning.
\par \lquote Master \endash  master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter, he is very busy,\rquote  said Winky, tilting her head towards the empty space beside her. \lquote Winky is wishing she is back in master\rquote s tent, Harry Potter, but Winky doe
s what she is told, Winky is a good house-elf.\rquote 
\par She gave the edge of the box another frightened look, and hid her eyes completely again. Harry turned back to the others.
\par \lquote So that\rquote s a house-elf?\rquote  Ron muttered. \lquote Weird things, aren\rquote t they?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dobby was weirder,\rquote  said Harry, fervently.
\par Ron pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium.
\par \lquote Wild!\rquote  he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. \lquote I can make that old bloke down there pick his nose again ... and again ... and again \'85\rquote 
\par Hermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through her velvet-covered, tasselled programme.
\par \lquote  \'93A display from the team mascots will precede the match\'94,\rquote  she read aloud.
\par \lquote Oh, that\rquote s always worth watching,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote National teams bring creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show.\rquote 
\par The box filled gradually around them over the next half hour. Mr Weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards. Percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he was trying to sit on a hedge\-
hog. When Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic himself, arrived, Percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shat\-tered. Highly embarrassed, he repaired them with his wand, 
and thereafter remained in his seat, throwing jealous looks at Harry, whom Cornelius Fudge had greeted like an old friend. They had met before, and Fudge shook Harry\rquote 
s hand in fatherly fashion, asked how he was, and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him.
\par \lquote Harry Potter, you know,\rquote  he loudly told the Bulgarian Minister, who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold, and didn\rquote t seem to understand a word of English. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry\rquote s scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly, pointing at it.
\par \lquote Knew we\rquote d get there in the end,\rquote  said Fudge wearily to Harry. \lquote I\rquote m no great shakes at languages, I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see his house-elf\rquote 
s saving him a seat ... good job too, these Bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best places ... ah, and here\rquote s Lucius!\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione turned quickly. Edging along the second row to three still-empty seats right behind Mr Weasley were none other than Dobby the house-elf\rquote s old owners \endash 
 Lucius Malfoy, his son, Draco, and a woman Harry supposed must be Draco\rquote s mother.
\par Harry and Draco Malfoy had been enemies
 ever since their very first journey to Hogwarts. A pale boy with a pointed face and white-blond hair, Draco greatly resembled his father. His mother was blonde, too; tall and slim, she would have been nice looking if she hadn\rquote 
t been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose.
\par \lquote Ah, Fudge,\rquote  said Mr Malfoy, holding out his hand as he reached the Minister for Magic. \lquote How are you? I don\rquote t think you\rquote ve met my wife, Narcissa? Or our son, Draco?\rquote 
\par \lquote How do you do, how do you do?\rquote  said Fudge, smiling and bowing to Mrs Malfoy. \lquote And allow me to introduce you to Mr Oblansk \endash  Obalonsk \endash  Mr \endash  well, he\rquote s the Bulgarian Minister for Magic, and he can\rquote 
t understand a word I\rquote m saying anyway, so never mind. And let\rquote s see who else \endash  you know Arthur Weasley, I daresay?\rquote 
\par It was a tense moment. Mr Weasley and Mr Malfoy looked at each other and Harry vividly recalled the last time that they had come face to face; it had been in Flourish and Blotts book\-shop, and they had had a fight. Mr Malfoy\rquote s cold grey eyes
 swept over Mr Weasley, and then up and down the row.
\par \lquote Good Lord, Arthur,\rquote  he said softly. \lquote What did you have to sell to get seats in the Top Box? Surely your house wouldn\rquote t have fetched this much?\rquote 
\par Fudge, who wasn\rquote t listening, said, \lquote Lucius has just given a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 very}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
 generous contribution to St Mungo\rquote s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Arthur. He\rquote s here as my guest.\rquote 
\par \lquote How \endash  how nice,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, with a very strained smile.
\par Mr Malfoy\rquote s eyes had returned to Hermione, who went slightly pink, but stared determinedly back at him. Harry knew exactly what was making Mr Malfoy\rquote 
s lip curl. The Malfoys prided themselves on being pure-bloods; in other words, they considered anyone of Muggle descent, like Hermione, second-class. However, under the gaze of the Minister for Magic, Mr Malfoy didn\rquote 
t dare say anything. He nodded sneeringly to Mr Weasley, and continued down the line to his seats. Draco shot Harry, Ron and Hermione one con\-temptuous look, then settled himself between his mother and father.
\par \lquote Slimy gits,\rquote  Ron muttered, as he, Harry and Hermione turned to face the pitch again. Next moment, Ludo Bagman had charged into the box.
\par \lquote Everyone ready?\rquote  he said, his round face gleaming like a great, excited Edam. \lquote Minister \endash  ready to go?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ready when you are, Ludo,\rquote  said Fudge comfortably.
\par Ludo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat and said }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Sonorus!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium; his voice echoed over them, booming into every corner of the stands: \lquote 
Ladies and gentlemen ... welcome! Welcome to the final of the four hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup!\rquote 
\par The spectators screamed and clapped. Thousands of flags waved, adding their discordant national anthems to the racket. The huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

and now showed BULGARIA: ZERO, IRELAND: ZERO.
\par \lquote And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce ... the Bulgarian Team Mascots!\rquote 
\par The right-hand side of the stands, which was a solid block of scarlet, roared its approval.
\par \lquote I wonder what they\rquote ve brought?\rquote  said Mr Weasley, leaning forwards in his seat. Aaah!\rquote  He suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote What are Veel\emdash ?\rquote 
\par But a hundred Veela were now gliding out onto the pitch, and Harry\rquote s question was answered for him. Veela were women ... the most beautiful women Harry had ever seen ... except that they weren\rquote t \endash  they couldn\rquote t be \endash  h
uman. This puzzled Harry for a moment, while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon-bright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out behind them without wind ... but then the music started, and Harry stopped 
worrying about them not being human \endash  in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all.
\par The Veela had started to dance, and Harry\rquote s mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the Veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen ...
\par And as the Veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through Harry\rquote s dazed mind. He wanted to do something very impressive, right now. Jumping from the box into the 
stadium seemed a good idea ... but would it be good enough?
\par \lquote Harry, what }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 you doing?\rquote  said Hermione\rquote 
s voice from a long way off.
\par The music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing up, and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box. Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he was about to dive from a springboard.
\par Angry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn\rquote t want the Veela to go. Harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered vague
ly why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest. Ron, meanwhile, was absent-mindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr Weasley, smiling slightly, leant over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his hands.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll be wanting that,\rquote  he said, \lquote once Ireland have had their say.\rquote 
\par \lquote Huh?\rquote  said Ron, staring open-mouthed at the Veela, who had now lined up along one side of the pitch.

\par Next moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-gold comet had come zooming into the stadium. It did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two smalle
r comets, each hurtling towards the goalposts. A rainbow arced suddenly across the pitch, connecting the two balls of light. The crowd \lquote oooohed\rquote  and \lquote aaaaahed\rquote 
, as though at a firework display. Now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merg
ed; they had formed a great shimmering shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands. Something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it \endash 
\par \lquote Excellent!\rquote  yelled Ron, as the shamrock soared over their heads, and heavy gold coins 
rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats. Squinting up at the shamrock, Harry realised that it was actually composed of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red waistcoats, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green.
\par \lquote Leprechauns!\rquote  said Mr Weasley, over the tumultuous applause of the crowd, many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold.
\par \lquote There you go,\rquote  Ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold coins into Harry\rquote s hand. \lquote For the Omnioculars! Now you\rquote ve got to buy me a Christmas present, ha!\rquote

\par Seven green blurs swept onto the pitch; Harry spun a small dial on the side of his Omnioculars, and slowed the players down enough to read the word \lquote Firebolt\rquote  on each of t
heir brooms, and see their names, embroidered in silver, upon their backs.
\par \lquote And here, all the way from Egypt, our referee, acclaimed Chairwizard of the International Association of Quidditch, Hassan Mostafa!\rquote 
\par A small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with a moustache to rival Uncle Vernon\rquote 
s, wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the pitch. A silver whistle was protruding from under the moustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the
 other. Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open \endash 
 four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers and (Harry saw it for the briefes
t moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged, Golden Snitch. With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls.
\par \lquote Theeeeeeeey\rquote re OFF!\rquote  screamed Bagman. \lquote And it\rquote s Mullet! Troy! Moran! Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran!\rquote 
\par It was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He was pressing his Omnioculars so hard to his eyes that his glasses were cutting into the bridge of his nose. The speed of the players was incredible \endash  the Chasers were throwing t
he Quaffle to each other so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names. Harry spun the \lquote slow\rquote  dial on the right of his Omnioculars again, pressed the \lquote play by play\rquote 
 button on the top and he was immediately watching in slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses, and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums.

a passing Bludger with his small club, knocking it into Moran\rquote s path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it \endash

\par \lquote Harry, if you\rquote re not going to watch at normal speed, you\rquote re going to miss things!\rquote  shouted Hermione, who was dancing up and 
down, waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honour of the pitch. Harry looked quickly over the top of his Omnioculars, and saw that the leprechauns watching from the side-lines had all risen into the air again, and formed the great, glitterin
g shamrock. Across the pitch, the Veela were watching them sulkily.
\par Furious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed.
\par Harry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the Irish Chasers were superb. They worked as a seamless team, appearing to read each other\rquote s minds by the way they posi\-tioned themselves, and the rosette on Harry\rquote 
s chest kept squeaking their names: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Troy \endash  Mullet \endash }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  }{

d causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the green-clad supporters.
\par The match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers, and were
 starting to prevent them using some of their best moves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break through their ranks, dodge the Keeper, Ryan, and score Bulgaria\rquote s first goal.
\par \lquote Fingers in your ears!\rquote  bellowed Mr Weasl
ey, as the Veela started to dance in celebration. Harry screwed up his eyes, too; he wanted to keep his mind on the game. After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the pitch. The Veela had stopped danc\-
ing, and Bulgaria were again in possession of the Quaffle.
\par \lquote Dimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova \endash  oh, I say!\rquote  roared Bagman.
\par One hundred thousand wizards and witches gasped as the two Seekers, Krum and Lynch, plummeted through the centre of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped 
from aeroplanes without parachutes. Harry followed their descent through his Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was \endash 
\par \lquote They\rquote re going to crash!\rquote  screamed Hermione next to Harry.
\par She was half-right \endash  at the very last second, Viktor Krum pulled out of the dive and spiralled off. Lynch, however, hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose from the Irish seats.
\par \lquote Fool!\rquote  moaned Mr Weasley. \lquote Krum was feinting!\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s time out!\rquote  yelled Bagman\rquote s voice. \lquote As trained medi\-wizards hurry onto the pitch to examine Aidan Lynch!\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote ll be OK, he only got ploughed!\rquote  Charlie said reassuring\-ly to Ginny, who was hanging over the side of the box, looking horror-struck. \lquote Which is what Krum was after, of course \'85\rquote 
\par Harry hastily pressed the \lquote replay\rquote  and \lquote play by play\rquote  buttons on his Omnioculars, twiddled the speed dial, and put them back up to his eyes.
\par He watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow motion. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Wronski Feint \endash  dangerous Seeker diversion\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 read the shining purple lettering across his lenses. He saw Krum\rquote s face contort\-ed with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time, while Lynch was flattened, and he understood 
\endash  Krum hadn\rquote t seen the Snitch at all, he was just making Lynch copy him. Harry had n
ever seen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily through the air that it looked as though he was unsupported and weightless. Harry turned his Omnioculars back to normal, and focused them on 
Krum. He was circling high above Lynch, who was now being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion. Harry, focusing still more closely upon Krum\rquote 
s face, saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below. He was using the time while Lynch was revived to look for the Snitch without interference.
\par Lynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the green-clad supporters, mounted his Firebolt and kicked back off into the air. His revival seemed to give Ireland new heart. When Mostafa blew hi
s whistle again, the Chasers moved into action with a skill unrivalled by anything Harry had seen so far.
\par After fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals. They were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten, and the game was starting to get dirtier.
\par As Mullet shot towards the goalposts yet again, clutching the Quaffle tightly under her arm, the Bulgarian Keeper, Zograf, flew out to meet her. Whatever happened was over so quickly Harry didn\rquote t catch it, but a 
scream of rage from the Irish crowd, and Mostafa\rquote s long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a foul.
\par \lquote And Mostafa takes the Bulgarian Keeper to task for cobbing \endash  excessive use of elbows!\rquote  Bagman informed the roaring spec\-tators. \lquote And \endash  yes, it\rquote s a penalty to Ireland!\rquote 
\par The leprechauns, who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when Mullet had been fouled, now darted together to form the words \lquote HA HA HA!\rquote . The Veela on the other side 
of the pitch leapt to their feet, tossed their hair angrily and started to dance again.
\par As one, the Weasley boys and Harry stuffed their fingers in their ears, but Hermione, who hadn\rquote t bothered, was soon tugging on Harry\rquote s arm. He turned to look at her, and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears.
\par \lquote Look at the referee!\rquote  she said, giggling.
\par Harry looked down at the pitch. Hassan Mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing Veela, and was acting very oddly indeed. He was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mous\-tache excitedly.
\par \lquote Now, we can\rquote t have that!\rquote  said Ludo Bagman, though he sounded highly amused. \lquote Somebody slap the referee!\rquote 
\par A mediwizard came tearing across the pitch, his fingers stuffed in his own ears, and kicked Mostafa hard on the 
shins. Mostafa seemed to come to himself; Harry, watching through the Omnioculars again, saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed, and was shouting at the Veela, who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinous.
\par \lquote And unless I\rquote m much mistaken, Mostafa is actually attempt\-ing to send off the Bulgarian Team Mascots!\rquote  said Bagman\rquote s voice. \lquote Now }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

\par It did: the Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov and Vulchanov, had landed either side of Mostafa, and began arguing furiously with him, gesticulating towards the leprechauns, who had now glee\-fully formed the words \lquote HEE HEE HEE\rquote 
. Mostafa was not impressed by the Bulgarians\rquote  arguments, however; he was jab\-bing his finger into the air, clearly telling them to get flying again, and when they refused, he gave two short blasts on his whistle.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Two }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 penalties for Ireland!\rquote 
 shouted Bagman, and the Bulgarian crowd howled with anger. \lquote And Volkov and Vulchanov had better get back on those brooms ... yes ... there they go ... and Troy takes the Quaffle \'85\rquote 
\par Play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen. The Beaters on both sides were acting without mercy: Volkov and Vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact wit
h Bludger or human, as they swung them violently through the air. Dimitrov shot straight at Moran, who had the Quaffle, nearly knocking her off her broom.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Foul!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
roared the Irish supporters as one, all standing up in a great wave of green.
\par \lquote Foul!\rquote  echoed Ludo Bagman\rquote s magically magnified voice. \lquote Dimitrov skins Moran \endash  deliberately flying to collide there \endash  and it\rquote s got to be another penalty \endash  yes, there\rquote s the whistle!\rquote 

\par The leprechauns had risen into the air again and, this time, they formed a giant hand, w
hich was making a very rude sign indeed across the pitch towards the Veela. At this, the Veela lost control. They launched themselves across the pitch, and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns. Watching through his Omniocul
ars, Harry saw that they didn\rquote t look remotely beautiful now. On the contrary, their faces were elongating into sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders \endash 
\par \lquote And }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 that, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 boys,\rquote  yelled Mr Weasley over the tumult of 
the crowd below, \lquote is why you should never go for looks alone!\rquote 
\par Ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the Veela and the leprechauns, but with little success; meanwhile, the pitched battle below was nothing to the one above. Harry turned 
this way and that, staring through his Omnioculars, as the Quaffle changed hands with the speed of a bullet \endash 
\par \lquote Levski \endash  Dimitrov \endash  Moran \endash  Troy \endash  Mullet \endash  Ivanova \endash  Moran again \endash  Moran \endash  MORAN SCORES!\rquote 
\par But the cheers of the Irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the Veela, the blasts now issuing from the Ministry members\rquote 
 wands, and the furious roars of the Bulgarians. The game recommenced immediately; now Levski had the Quaffle, now Dimitrov \endash 
\par The Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing Bludger, and hit it as hard as possible towards Krum, who did not duck quickly enough. It hit him hard in the face.
\par There was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum\rquote s nose looked broken, there was blood everywhere, but Hassan Mostafa didn\rquote t blow his whistle. He had become distracted, and Harry couldn\rquote 
t blame him; one of the Veela had thrown a handful of fire and set his broomtail alight.
\par Harry wanted someone to realise that Krum was injured; even though he was supporting Ireland, Krum was the most exciting player on the pitch. Ron obviously felt the same.
\par \lquote Time out! Ah, come on, he can\rquote t play like that, look at him \endash \rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Look at Lynch!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Harry yelled.
\par For the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive, and Harry was quite sure that this was no Wronski Feint; this was the real thing ...
\par \lquote He\rquote s seen the Snitch!\rquote  Harry shouted. \lquote He\rquote s seen it! Look at him go!\rquote 
\par Half the crowd seemed to have realised what was happening, the Irish supporters rose in a great wave of green, screaming their Seeker on ... but Krum was 
on his tail. How he could see where he was going, Harry had no idea; there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him, but he was drawing level with Lynch now, as the pair of them hurtled towards the ground again \endash 
\par \lquote They\rquote re going to crash!\rquote  shrieked Hermione.
\par \lquote They\rquote re not!\rquote  roared Ron.
\par \lquote Lynch is!\rquote  yelled Harry.
\par And he was right \endash  for the second time, Lynch hit the ground with tremendous force, and was immediately stamped\-ed by a horde of angry Veela.
\par \lquote The Snitch, where\rquote s the Snitch?\rquote  bellowed Charlie, along the row.
\par \lquote He\rquote s got it \endash  Krum\rquote s got it \endash  it\rquote s all over!\rquote  shouted Harry.
\par Krum, his red robes shining with blood from his nose, was rising gently into the air, his fist held high, a glint of gold in his hand.
\par The scoreboard was flashing BULGARIA: ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY, IRELAND: ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY across the crowd, who didn\rquote 
t seem to have realised what had happened. Then, slowly, as though a great jumbo jet was revving up, the rumbling from the Ireland supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight.
\par \lquote IRELAND WIN!\rquote  shouted Bagman, who, like the Irish, seemed to have been taken aback by the sudden end of the match. \lquote KRUM GETS THE SNITCH \endash  BUT IRELAND WIN \endash  good Lord, I don\rquote t think any of us were expecting that!
\rquote 
\par \lquote What did he catch the Snitch for?\rquote  Ron bellowed, even as he jumped up and down, applauding with his hands over his head. \lquote He ended it when Ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!\rquote 
\par \lquote He knew they were never going to catch up,\rquote  Harry shouted back over all the noise, also applauding loudly, \lquote the Irish Chasers were too good ... he wanted to end it on his terms, that\rquote s all ...\rquote 
\par \lquote He was very brave, wasn\rquote t he?\rquote  Hermione said, leaning for\-ward to watch Krum land, and the swarm of mediwizards blasting a path through the battling leprechauns and Veela to get to him. \lquote He looks a terrible mess ...\rquote 

\par Harry put his Omnioculars to his eyes again. It was hard to see what was happening below, because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the pitch, 
but he could just make out Krum, surrounded by mediwizards. He looked surlier than ever, and refused to let them mop him up. His team-mates were around him, shaking their heads and looking dejected; a short way away, the Irish players were dancing gleeful
ly in a shower of gold descending from their mascots. Flags were waving all over the stadium, the Irish national anthem blared from all sides; the Veela were shrinking back into their usual, beautiful selves now, though looking dispirited and forlorn.

\par \lquote Vell, ve fought bravely,\rquote  said a gloomy voice behind Harry. He looked around; it was the Bulgarian Minister for Magic.
\par \lquote You can speak English!\rquote  said Fudge, sounding outraged. \lquote And you\rquote ve been letting me mime everything all day!\rquote 
\par \lquote Vell, it vos very funny,\rquote  said the Bulgarian Minister, shrug\-ging.
\par \lquote And as the Irish team perform a lap of honour, flanked by their mascots, the Quidditch World Cup itself is brought into the Top Box!\rquote  roared Bagman.
\par Harry\rquote s eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light, as the Top Box was magically illuminated so that every\-
one in the stands could see the inside. Squinting towards the entrance, he saw two panting wizards carrying into the box a vast golden cup, which they handed to Cornelius Fudge, who was still looking very disgruntled that he\rquote 
d been using sign language all day for nothing.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers \endash Bulgaria!\rquote  Bagman shouted.
\par And up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated Bulgarian players. The crowd below were applauding apprecia\-tively; Harry could see thousands and thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction.
\par One by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box, and Bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their
 own Minister and then with Fudge. Krum, who was last in line, looked a real mess. Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face. He was still holding the Snitch. Harry noticed that he seemed much less co-ordinated on the ground. He was sl
ightly duck-footed and distinctly round-shouldered. But when Krum\rquote s name was announced, the whole stadium gave him a resounding, ear-splitting roar.
\par And then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being sup\-ported by Moran and Connolly; the second crash seeme
d to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused. But he grinned happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the crowd below thundered their approval. Harry\rquote s hands were numb with clapping.
\par At last, when the Irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honour on their brooms (Aidan Lynch on the back of Connolly\rquote 
s, clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way), Bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Quietus\rquote .}{

\par Mr Weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were, but seemed to decide, upon reflection, that he didn\rquote t want to know.
\par They were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites. Raucous singing was borne towards them on 
the night air as they retraced their steps along the lantern-lit path, and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads, cackling and waving their lanterns. When they finally reached the tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all and, given the level of noise 
a
round them, Mr Weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in. They were soon arguing enjoyably about the match; Mr Weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with Charlie, and it was only when Ginny fell
 
asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that Mr Weasley called a halt to the verbal replays, and insisted that everyone went to bed. Hermione and Ginny went into the next tent, and Harry and the rest of the Weasleys cha
nged into pyjamas and clambered into their bunks. From the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing, and the odd echoing bang.
\par \lquote Oh, I am glad I\rquote m not on duty,\rquote  muttered Mr Weasley sleepily, \lquote I wouldn\rquote t fancy having to go and tell the Irish they\rquote ve got to stop celebrating.\rquote 
\par Harry, who was on a top bunk above Ron, lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent, watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead, and picturing again some of Krum\rquote s more spectacular moves
. He was itching to get back on his own Firebolt and try out the Wronski Feint ... somehow Oliver Wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to look like ... Harry saw himself in robes that had his name on
 the back, and imagined the sensation of hearing a hundred-thousand-strong crowd roar, as Ludo Bagman\rquote s voice echoed throughout the stadium, \lquote I give you ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Harry never knew whether he had actually dropped off to sleep or not \endash  his fantasies of flying like Krum might well have slipped into actual dreams \endash  all he knew was that, quite suddenly, Mr Weasley was shouting.
\par \lquote Get up! Ron \endash  Harry \endash  come on now, get up, this is urgent!\rquote 
\par Harry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas.
\par \lquote  \rquote S\rquote matter?\rquote  he said.
\par Dimly, he could tell that something was wrong. The noises in the campsite had changed. The singing had stopped. He could hear screams, and the sound of people running.
\par He slipped down from the bunk, and reached for his clothes, but Mr Weasley, who had pulled on his jeans over his own pyjamas, said, \lquote No time, Harry \endash  just grab a jacket and get outside \endash  quickly!\rquote 
\par Harry did as he was told, and hurried out of the tent, Ron at his heels.
\par By the light of the few fires that were still burning, he could see
 people running away into the woods, fleeing something that was moving across the field towards them, something that was emitting odd flashes of light, and noises like gunfire. Loud jeering, roars of laughter and drunken yells were drifting towards them; 
then came a burst of strong green light, which illuminated the scene.
\par A crowd of wizards, tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upwards, was marching slowly across the field. Harry squinted at them ... they didn\rquote t seem to have face
s ... then he realised that their heads were hooded and their faces masked. High above them, floating along in mid-air, four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes. It was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers, 
and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air. Two of the figures were very small.
\par More wizards were joining the marching group, laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies. Tents crumpled
 and fell as the marching crowd swelled. Once or twice Harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand. Several caught fire. The screaming grew louder.
\par The floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent, and Harry recognised one of them \endash 
 Mr Roberts, the campsite manager. The other three looked as though they might be his wife and children. One of the marchers below flipped Mrs Roberts upside-down with his wand; her nightdress fell down to reveal volumin
ous drawers; she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee.
\par \lquote That\rquote s sick,\rquote  Ron muttered, watching the smallest Muggle child, who had begun to spin like a top, sixty feet above the ground, his head flopping limply from side to side. \lquote That is really sick ...\rquote 
\par Hermione and Ginny came hurrying towards them, pulling coats over their nightdresses, with Mr Weasley right behind them. At the same moment, Bill, Charlie and Percy emerged from the boys\rquote  tent, fully dressed, wit
h their sleeves rolled up and their wands out.
\par \lquote We\rquote re going to help the Ministry,\rquote  Mr Weasley shouted over all the noise, rolling up his own sleeves. \lquote You lot \endash  get into the woods, and }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Bi
ll, Charlie and Percy were already sprinting away towards the oncoming marchers; Mr Weasley tore after them. Ministry wizards were dashing from every direction towards the source of the trouble. The crowd beneath the Roberts family was coming ever closer.

\par \lquote C\rquote mon,\rquote  said Fred, grabbing Ginny\rquote 
s hand and starting to pull her towards the wood. Harry, Ron, Hermione and George followed. They all looked back as they reached the trees. The crowd beneath the Roberts family was larger than ever; they could see the Min
istry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the centre, but they were having great difficulty. It looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the Roberts family fall.
\par The coloured lanterns that had lit the pat
h to the stadium had been extinguished. Dark figures were blundering through the trees; children were crying; anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air. Harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by pe
ople whose faces he could not see. Then he heard Ron yell with pain.
\par \lquote What happened?\rquote  said Hermione anxiously, stopping so abruptly that Harry walked into her. \lquote Ron, where are you? Oh, this is stupid \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

\par She illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path. Ron was lying sprawled on the ground.
\par \lquote Tripped over a tree-root,\rquote  he said angrily, getting to his feet again.
\par \lquote Well, with feet that size, hard not to,\rquote  said a drawling voice from behind them.
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione turned sharply. Draco Malfoy was standing alone nearby them, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed. His arms folded, he seemed to have been watching the scene on the campsite through a gap in the trees.
\par Ron told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he would never have dared say in front of Mrs Weasley.
\par \lquote Language, Weasley,\rquote  said Malfoy his pale eyes glittering. \lquote Hadn\rquote t you better be hurrying along, now? You wouldn\rquote t like }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 her }{

\par He nodded at Hermione, and at the same moment, a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite, and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them.
\par \lquote What\rquote s that supposed to mean?\rquote  said Hermione defiantly.
\par \lquote Granger, they\rquote re after }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Muggles,\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  said Malfoy. \lquote D

\par \lquote Hermione\rquote s a witch,\rquote  Harry snarled.
\par \lquote Have it your own way, Potter,\rquote  said Malfoy, grinning maliciously. \lquote If you think they can\rquote t spot a Mudblood, stay where you are.\rquote 
\par \lquote You watch your mouth!\rquote  shouted Ron. Everybody present knew that \lquote Mudblood\rquote  was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of Muggle parentage.
\par \lquote Never mind, Ron,\rquote  said Hermione quickly, seizing Ron\rquote s arm to restrain him as he took a step towards Malfoy.
\par There came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard. Several people nearby screamed.
\par Malfoy chuckled softly. \lquote Scare easily, don\rquote t they?\rquote  he said lazily. \lquote I suppose your daddy told you all to hide? What\rquote s he up to \endash  trying to rescue the Muggles?\rquote 
\par \lquote Where\rquote re }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 your }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 parents?\rquote  said Harry, his temper rising. 
\lquote Out there wearing masks, are they?\rquote 
\par Malfoy turned his face to Harry, still smiling. \lquote Well ... if they were, I wouldn\rquote t be likely to tell you, would I, Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, come on,\rquote  said Hermione, with a disgusted look at Malfoy, \lquote let\rquote s go and find the others.\rquote 
\par \lquote Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,\rquote  sneered Malfoy.
\par \lquote Come }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 on,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Hermione repeated, and she p

\par \lquote I\rquote ll bet you anything his dad }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 one of that masked lot!\rquote 
 said Ron hotly.
\par \lquote Well, with any luck, the Ministry will catch him!\rquote  said Hermione fervently. \lquote Oh, I can\rquote t believe this, where have the others got to?\rquote 
\par Fred, George and Ginny were nowhere to be seen, though the path was packed with plenty of other people, all of them looking nervously over their shoulders towards the commo\-tion back at the campsite.
\par A huddle of teenagers in pyjamas was arguing vociferously a little way along the path. When they saw Harry, Ron and Hermione, a girl with thick, curly hair turned and said quickly, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Er \endash  what?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Oh ...\rquote  The girl who had spoken turned her back on him, and as they walked on they distinctly heard her say, \lquote  \rquote Ogwarts.\rquote 
\par \lquote Beauxbatons,\rquote  muttered Hermione.
\par \lquote Sorry?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote They must go to Beauxbatons,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote You know ... Beauxbatons Academy of Magic ... I read about it in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

\par \lquote Oh ... yeah ... right,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Fred and George can\rquote t have gone that far,\rquote  said Ron, pulling out his wand, lighting it like Hermione, and squinting up the path. Harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand \endash  but it wasn\rquote 
t there. The only things he could find were his Omnioculars.
\par \lquote Ah, no, I don\rquote t believe it ... I\rquote ve lost my wand!\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re kidding?\rquote 
\par Ron and Hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light further on the ground; Harry looked all around him, but his wand was nowhere to be seen.
\par \lquote Maybe it\rquote s back in the tent,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running?\rquote  Hermione suggested anxiously.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote maybe ...\rquote 
\par He usually kept his wand with him at all times in the wizarding world, and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerable.
\par A rustling noise made all three of them jump. Winky the house-elf was fighting her way out of a clum
p of bushes nearby. She was moving in a most peculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty; it was as though someone invisible was trying to hold her back.
\par \lquote There is bad wizards about!\rquote  she squeaked distractedly, as she leant forwards and laboured to keep running. \lquote People high \endash  high in the air! Winky is getting out of the way!\rquote 
\par And she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path, panting and squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her.
\par \lquote What\rquote s up with her?\rquote  said Ron, looking curiously after Winky. \lquote Why can\rquote t she run properly?\rquote 
\par \lquote Bet she didn\rquote t ask permission to hide,\rquote  said Harry. He was thinking of Dobby: every time he had tried to do something the Malfoys wouldn\rquote t like, he had been forced to start beating himself up.
\par \lquote You know, house-elves get a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 very }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 raw deal!\rquote 
 said Hermione indignantly. \lquote It\rquote s slavery, that\rquote s what it is! That Mr Crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium, and she was terrified, and he\rquote s got her bewitched so she can\rquote t even run when they start trampling te

\par \lquote Well, the elves are happy, aren\rquote t they?\rquote  Ron said. \lquote You heard old Winky back at the match ... \'93House-elves is not supposed to have fun\'94 ... that\rquote s what she likes, being bossed around ...\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s people like }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 you, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Ron,\rquote  Hermione began hotly, \lquote 
who prop up rotten and unjust systems, just because they\rquote re too lazy to \endash \rquote 
\par Another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s just keep moving, shall we?\rquote  said Ron, and Harry saw him glance edgily at Hermione. Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps Hermione }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 was}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
 in more danger than they were. They set off again, Harry still searching his pockets, even though he knew his wand wasn\rquote t there.
\par They followed the dark path deeper into the wood, still keepin
g an eye out for Fred, George and Ginny. They passed a group of goblins, who were cackling over a sack of gold they had undoubtedly won betting on the match, and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble on the campsite. Further still along the path, th
ey walked into a patch of silvery light, and when they looked through the trees, they saw three tall and beautiful Veela standing in a clearing, surround\-ed by a gaggle of young wizards, all of whom were talking very loudly.
\par \lquote I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year,\rquote  one of them shouted. \lquote I\rquote m a dragon-killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, you\rquote re not,\rquote  yelled his friend, \lquote you\rquote re a dish-washer at the Leaky Cauldron ... but I\rquote m a Vampire Hunter, I\rquote ve killed about ninety so far \endash \rquote 
\par A third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even by the dim, silvery light of the Veela, now cut in, \lquote I\rquote m about to become the youngest ever Minister for Magic, I am.\rquote 
\par Harry snorted with laughter. He recognised the pimply wizard; his name was Stan Shunpike, and he was in fact a conductor on the triple-decker Knight Bus.
\par He turned to tell Ron this, but Ron\rquote s face had gone oddly slack, and next second Ron was yelling, \lquote Did I tell you I\rquote ve invented a broomstick that\rquote ll reach Jupiter?\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Honestly!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
said Hermione again, and she and Harry grabbed Ron firmly by the arms, wheeled him around and marched him away. By the time the sounds of the Veela and their admirers had faded completely, they were in the very heart of the wood. They seemed to 
be alone now; everything was much quieter.
\par Harry looked around. \lquote I reckon we can just wait here, you know, we\rquote ll hear anyone coming a mile off.\rquote 
\par The words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo Bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them.
\par Even by the feeble light of the two wands, Harry could see that a great change had come over Bagman. He no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was no more spring in his step. He looked very white and strained.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s that?\rquote  he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their faces. \lquote What are you doing in here, all alone?\rquote 
\par They looked at each other, surprised.
\par \lquote Well \endash  there\rquote s a sort of riot going on,\rquote  said Ron.
\par Bagman stared at him. \lquote What?\rquote 
\par \lquote On the campsite ... some people have got hold of a family of Muggles ...\rquote 
\par Bagman swore loudly. \lquote Damn them!\rquote  he said, looking quite distracted, and without another word, he Disapparated with a small }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 pop.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par \lquote Not exactly on top of things, Mr Bagman, is he?\rquote  said Hermione, frowning.
\par \lquote He was a great Beater, though,\rquote  said Ron, leading the way off the path into a small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree. \lquote 
The Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them.\rquote 
\par He took his small figure of Krum out of his pocket, s
et it down on the ground and watched it walk around for a while. Like the real Krum, the model was slightly duck-footed and round-shouldered, much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick. Harry was listening out for noise from the camps
ite. Everything still seemed quiet; perhaps the riot was over.
\par \lquote I hope the others are OK,\rquote  said Hermione after a while.
\par \lquote They\rquote ll be fine,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy,\rquote  said Harry, sit\-ting down next to Ron and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves. \lquote He\rquote s always said he\rquote d like to get something on him.\rquote 

\par \lquote That\rquote d wipe the smirk off old Draco\rquote s face, all right,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Those poor Muggles, though,\rquote  said Hermione nervously. \lquote What if they can\rquote t get them down?\rquote 
\par \lquote They will,\rquote  said Ron reassuringly, \lquote they\rquote ll find a way.\rquote 
\par \lquote Mad, though, to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic\rquote s out here tonight!\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote I mean, how do they expect to get away with it? Do you think they\rquote ve been drinking, or are they just \endash 
\rquote 
\par But she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder. Harry and Ron looked quickly around, too. It sounded as though someone was staggering towards their clearing. They waited, listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the da
rk trees. But the footsteps came to a sudden halt.
\par \lquote Hello?\rquote  called Harry.
\par There was silence. Harry got to his feet and peered around the tree. It was too dark to see very far, but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s there?\rquote  he said.
\par And then, without warning, the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood; and it uttered, not a panicked shout, but what sounded like a spell.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote MORSMORDRE!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par And something vast, green and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness Harry\rquote s eyes had been struggling to pene\-trate: it flew up over the treetops and into the sky.
\par \lquote What the \endash ?\rquote  gasped Ron, as he sprang to his feet again, staring up at the thing that had appeared.
\par For a split second, Harry thought it was another leprechaun formation. Then he realised that it was a colossal skull, com\-posed of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent pro\-
truding from its mouth like a tongue. As they watched, it rose higher and higher, blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against the black sky like a new constellation.
\par Suddenly, the wood all around them erupted with screams. Harry didn\rquote t understand why, but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull, wh
ich had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood, like some grisly neon sign. He scanned the darkness for the person who had con\-jured the skull, but he couldn\rquote t see anyone.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s there?\rquote  he called again.

\par \lquote We didn\rquote t do that!\rquote  said Harry, gesturing up at the skull.

\par But none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr Crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that Harry, Ron or Hermione had conjured the skull; on the contrary, at Hermione\rquote

\par \lquote Amos, be careful!\rquote  said a few of the wizards warningly, as Mr Diggory squared his shoulders, raised his wand, marched across the clearing and disappeared into the darkness. Hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her mouth.

\par They heard snapping twigs, the rustling of leaves, and then crunching footsteps as Mr Diggory re-emerged from behind the trees. He was carrying a tiny, limp figure in his arms. Harry recognised the tea-towel at once. It was Winky.
\par Mr Crouch did not move or speak as Mr Diggory deposited Mr Crouch\rquote s elf on the ground at his feet. The ot

\par \lquote This \endash  cannot \endash  be,\rquote  he said jerkily. \lquote No \endash \rquote 
\par He moved quickly around Mr Diggory and strode off towards the place where he had found Winky.
\par \lquote No point, Mr Crouch,\rquote  Mr Diggory called after him. \lquote There\rquote s no one else there.\rquote 
\par But Mr Crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it. They could hear him moving around, the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside, searching.

\par \lquote The Dark Mark!\rquote  he panted, almost trampling Winky as he turned enquiringly to his colleagues. \lquote Who did it? Did you get them? Barty! What\rquote s going on?\rquote 
\par Mr Crouch had returned empty-handed. His face was still ghostly white, and his hands and his toothbrush moustache were both twitching.
\par \lquote Where have you been, Barty?\rquote  said Bagman. \lquote Why weren\rquote t you at the match? Your elf was saving you a seat, too \endash  Gulping gargoyles!\rquote  Bagman had just noticed Winky lying at his feet. \lquote What happened to her?
\rquote 
\par \lquote I have been busy, Ludo,\rquote  said Mr Crouch, still talking in the same jerky fashion, barely moving his lips. \lquote And my elf has been Stunned.\rquote 
\par \lquote Stunned? By you lot, you mean? But why \endash ?\rquote 
\par Comprehension dawned suddenly on Bagman\rquote s round, shiny face; he looked up at the skull, down at Winky and then at Mr Crouch.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote No!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  he said. \lquote Winky? Conjure the Dark Mark? She wouldn

\par \lquote And she had one,\rquote  said Mr Diggory. \lquote I found her holding one, Ludo. If it\rquote s all right with you, Mr Crouch, I think we should hear what she\rquote s got to say for herself.\rquote 
\par Crouch gave no sign that he had heard Mr Diggory, but Mr Diggory seemed to take his silence for assent. He raised his own wand, pointed it at Winky and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote

 tremulously, raised her eyes to stare up into his face; then, more slowly still, she looked up into the sky. Harry could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous, glassy eyes. She gave a gasp, looked wildly around the crowded clearing and b
urst into terrified sobs.
\par \lquote Elf!\rquote  said Mr Diggory sternly. \lquote Do you know who I am? I\rquote m a member of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures!\rquote 
\par Winky began to rock backwards and forwards on the ground, her breath coming in sharp bursts. Harry was remind\-ed forcibly of Dobby in his moments of terrified disobedience.
\par \lquote As you see, elf, the Dark Mark was conjured here a short while ago,\rquote  said Mr Diggory. \lquote And you were discovered moments later, right beneath it! An explanation, if you please!\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  I \endash  I is not doing it, sir!\rquote  Winky gasped. \lquote I is not knowing how, sir!\rquote 
\par \lquote You were found with a wand in your hand!\rquote  barked Mr Diggory, brandishing it in front of her. And as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above, Harry recognised it.
\par \lquote Hey \endash  that\rquote s mine!\rquote  he said.
\par Everyone in the clearing looked at him.
\par \lquote Excuse me?\rquote  said Mr Diggory, incredulously.
\par \lquote That\rquote s my wand!\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I dropped it!\rquote 
\par \lquote You dropped it?\rquote  repeated Mr Diggory in disbelief. \lquote Is this a confession? You threw it aside after you conjured the Mark?\rquote 
\par \lquote Amos, think who you\rquote re talking to!\rquote  said Mr Weasley, very angrily. \lquote Is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Harry Potter }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Er \endash  of course not,\rquote  mumbled Mr Diggory. \lquote Sorry ... carried away ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t drop it there, anyway,\rquote  said Harry, jerking his thumb towards the trees beneath the skull. \lquote I missed it right after we got into the wood.\rquote 
\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Mr Diggory, his eyes hardening as he turned to look at Winky again, cowering at his feet. \lquote You found this wand, eh, elf? And you picked it up and thought you\rquote d have some fun with it, did you?\rquote 
\par \lquote I is not doing magic with it, sir!\rquote  squealed Winky, tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose. \lquote I is ... I is ... I is just picking it up, sir! I is not making the Dark Mark, sir, I is not knowing how!\rquote 

\par \lquote It wasn\rquote t her!\rquote  said Hermione. She looked very nervous, speaking up in front of all these Ministry wizards, yet deter\-mined all the same. \lquote Winky\rquote 
s got a squeaky little voice and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper!\rquote  She looked round at Harry and Ron, appealing for their support. \lquote It didn\rquote t sound anything like Winky, did it?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, shaking his head. \lquote It definitely didn\rquote t sound like an elf.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, it was a human voice,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Well, we\rquote ll soon see,\rquote  growled Mr Diggory, looking unim\-pressed. \lquote There\rquote s a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed, elf, did you know that?\rquote 
\par Winky trembled and shook her head frantically, her ears flapping, as Mr Diggory raised his own wand again, and placed it tip to tip with Harry\rquote s.

\par Bill was sitting at the small kitchen table, holding a bedsheet to his arm, which was bleeding profusely. Charlie had a large rip in his shirt, and Percy was sporting a bloody nose. Fred, George and Ginny looked unhurt, though shaken.
\par \lquote Did you get them, Dad?\rquote  said Bill sharply. \lquote The person who conjured the Mark?\rquote

\par With some assistance from Harry, Ron and Hermione, Mr Weasley explained what had happened in the woods. When they had finished their story, Percy swelled indignantly.
\par \lquote Well, Mr Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that!\rquote  he said. \lquote Running away when he\rquote d expressly told her not to ... embarrassing him in front of the whole Ministry ... how would that have looked, if she\rquote

\par There was silence for a moment.
\par Then Bill, removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut, said, \lquote Well, it didn\rquote t help us tonight, whoever conjured it. It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it. They all Disapparated before we\rquote

\par \lquote We can\rquote t prove it was them, Bill,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote Though it probably was,\rquote  he added hopelessly.
\par \lquote Yeah, I bet it was!\rquote  said Ron suddenly. \lquote Dad, we met Draco Malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks! And we all know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who!\rquote 
\par \lquote But what were Voldemort\rquote s supporters \endash \rquote  Harry began. Everybody flinched \endash  like most of the wizarding world, the Weasleys always avoided saying Voldemort\rquote s name. \lquote Sorry,\rquote  said Harry quickly. \lquote

\par \lquote The point?\rquote  said Mr Weasley, with a hollow laugh. \lquote Harry, that\rquote s their idea of fun. Half the Muggle killings back when You-Know-Who was in power were done for fun. I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and couldn\rquote

the Death Eaters, why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote They\rquote d have been pleased to see it, wouldn\rquote t they?\rquote 
\par \lquote Use your brains, Ron,\rquote  said Bill. \lquote If they really were Death Eaters, they worked really hard to keep out of Azkaban when You-Know-Who lost power, and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture peop
le. I bet they\rquote d be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back. They denied they\rquote d ever been involved with him when he lost his powers, and went back to their daily lives ... I don\rquote t reckon he\rquote 
d be over-pleased with them, do you?\rquote 
\par \lquote So ... whoever conjured the Dark Mark ...\rquote  said Hermione slowly, \lquote were they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters, or to scare them away?\rquote 
\par \lquote Your guess is as good as ours, Hermione,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote But I\rquote ll tell you this ... it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it. I\rquote d be very surprised if the person who did it hadn\rquote

\par They heard urgent voices a

y
 had a hurried discussion with Basil; they joined the queue, and were able to take an old rubber tyre back to Stoatshead Hill before the sun had really risen. They walked back through Ottery St Catchpole towards The Burrow in the dawn light, talking very 
little because they were so exhausted, and thinking longingly of their breakfast. As they rounded the corner in the lane, and The Burrow came into view, a cry echoed along the damp lane.
\par \lquote Oh, thank goodness, thank goodness!\rquote

\par Mrs Weasley glanced at the grandfather clock i
n the corner. Harry liked this clock. It was completely useless if you wanted to know the time, but otherwise very informative. It had nine golden hands, and each of them was engraved with one of the Weasley family\rquote

\lquote prison\rquote  and, in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock, \lquote mortal peril\rquote .
\par Eight of the hands were currently pointing at the \lquote home\rquote  position, but Mr Weasley\rquote s, which was the longest, was still pointing at \lquote work\rquote . Mrs Weasley sighed.
\par \lquote Your father hasn\rquote t had to go into the office at weekends since the days of You-Know-Who,\rquote  she said. \lquote They\rquote re working him far too hard. His dinner\rquote s going to be ruined if he doesn\rquote t come home soon.\rquote

 was darning a fireproof balaclava. Harry was polishing his Firebolt, the Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday open at his feet. Fred and George were sitting in a far corner, quills out, talking in whispers, their he

\par \lquote Well, the fat\rquote s really in the fire now,\rquote  he told Mrs Weasley as he sat down in an armchair near the fire and toyed unenthusi\-astically with his somewhat shrivelled cauliflower. \lquote Rita Skeeter\rquote

\par Harry repacked his Broomstick Servicing Kit, put his Firebolt over his shoulder and went back upstairs with Ron. The rain sounded even louder at the top of the house, accom\-
panied by loud whistlings and moans from the wind, not to mention sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic. 
Pigwidgeon began twittering and zooming around his cage again when they entered. The sight of the half-packed trunks seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitement.
\par \lquote Bung him some Owl Treats,\rquote  said Ron, throwing a packet across to Harry, \lquote it might shut him up.\rquote 
\par Harry poked a few Owl Treats through the bars of Pigwidgeon\rquote s cage, then turned to his trunk. Hedwig\rquote s cage stood next to it, still empty.
\par \lquote It\rquote s been over a week,\rquote  Harry said, looking at Hedwig\rquote s deserted perch. \lquote Ron, you don\rquote t reckon Sirius has been caught, do you?\rquote

\par There was a knock on the door, and Mrs Weasley entered, carrying an armful of freshly laundered Hogwarts robes.
\par \lquote Here you are,\rquote  she said, sorting them into two. \lquote Now, mind you pack them properly so they don\rquote t crease.\rquote

\par \lquote You\rquote ve got to be kidding,\rquote  said Ron in disbelief. \lquote I\rquote m not wearing that, no way.\rquote 
\par \lquote Everyone wears them, Ron!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley crossly. \lquote They\rquote re all like that! Your father\rquote s got some for smart parties!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll go starkers before I put that on,\rquote  said Ron stubbornly.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be so silly,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, \lquote you\rquote ve got to have dress robes, they\rquote re on your list! I got some for Harry, too ... show him, Harry ...\rquote 
\par In some trepidation, Harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed. It wasn\rquote t as bad as he had expected, however; his dress robes didn\rquote 
t have any lace on them at all; in fact, they were more or less the same as his school ones, except that they were bottle green instead of black.
\par \lquote I thought they\rquote d bring out the colour of your eyes, dear,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley fondly.
\par \lquote Well, they\rquote re OK!\rquote  said Ron angrily, looking at Harry\rquote s robes. \lquote Why couldn\rquote t I have some like that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because ... well, I had to get yours second-hand, and there wasn\rquote t a lot of choice!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, flushing.
\par Harry looked away. He would willingly have split all the money in his Gringotts vault with the Weasleys, but he knew they would never take it.
\par \lquote I\rquote m never wearing them,\rquote  Ron was saying stubbornly. \lquote Never.\rquote 
\par \lquote Fine,\rquote  snapped Mrs Weasley. \lquote Go naked. And Harry, make sure you get a picture of him. Goodness knows I could do with a laugh.\rquote 
\par She left the room, slamming the door behind her. There was a funny spluttering noise from behind them. Pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge Owl Treat.
\par \lquote Why is everything I own rubbish?\rquote  said Ron furiously, striding across the room to unstick Pigwidgeon\rquote s beak.

\par Bill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off at King\rquote s Cross station, but Percy, apologising most profusely, said that he really needed to get to work.
\par \lquote I just can\rquote t justify taking more time off at the moment,\rquote  he told them. \lquote Mr Crouch is really starting to rely on me.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, you know what, Percy?\rquote  said George seriously. \lquote I reckon he\rquote ll know your name soon.\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley had braved the telephone in the village Post Office to order three ordinary Muggle taxis to take them into London.
\par \lquote Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us,\rquote  Mrs Weasley whispered to Harry as they stood in the rain-washed yard, watching the taxi drivers heaving six heavy Hogwarts trunks into their cars. \lquote But there weren\rquote 
t any to spare ... oh dear, they don\rquote t look happy, do they?\rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t like to tell Mrs Weasley that Muggle taxi drivers rarely transported over-excited owls, and Pigwidgeon was making an ear-splitting racket. Nor did it help that a number of Dr Filibuster\rquote 
s Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks went off unexpectedly when Fred\rquote s trunk sprang open, causing the driver carrying it to yell with fright and pain as Crookshanks clawed his way up the man\rquote s leg.
\par The journey was uncomfortable, owing to the fact that they were jammed in the back of the taxis with their trunks. Crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks, and by the time they entere
d London, Harry, Ron and Hermione were all severely scratched. They were very relieved to get out at King\rquote 
s Cross, even though the rain was coming down harder than ever, and they got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station.
\par H
arry was used to getting onto platform nine and three-quarters by now. It was a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an unobtrusive way, so as to avo
id attracting Muggle attention. They did it in groups today; Harry, Ron and Hermione (the most conspicu\-ous, as they were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crook\-
shanks) went first; they leant casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways through it ... and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters materialised in front of them.
\par The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there, clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students and parents on the plat\-
form appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist. Harry, Ron and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their luggage in a compartment halfway a
long the train. They then hopped back down onto the platform, to say goodbye to Mrs Weasley, Bill and Charlie.
\par \lquote I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,\rquote  said Charlie, grinning, as he hugged Ginny goodbye.
\par \lquote Why?\rquote  said Fred keenly.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll see,\rquote  said Charlie. \lquote Just don\rquote t tell Percy I mentioned it ... it\rquote s \'93classified information, until such time as the Ministry sees fit to release it\'94, after all.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I sort of wish I was back at Hogwarts this year,\rquote  said Bill, hands in his pockets, looking almost wistfully at the train.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Why?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  said George impatiently.

\par \lquote Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs Weasley,\rquote  said Hermione, as they climbed on board, closed the door and leant out of the window to talk to her.
\par \lquote Yeah, thanks for everything, Mrs Weasley,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Oh, it was my pleasure, dears,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. \lquote I\rquote d invite you for Christmas, but ... well, I expect you\rquote re all going to want to stay at Hogwarts, what with ... one thing and another.\rquote

\par The pistons hissed loudly, and the train began to move.
\par \lquote Tell us what\rquote s happening at Hogwarts!\rquote  Fred bellowed out of the window, as Mrs Weasley, Bill and Charlie sped away from them. \lquote What rules are they changing?\rquote 
\par But Mrs Weasley only smiled and waved. Before the train had rounded the corner, she, Bill and Charlie had Disapparated.
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione went back to their compartment. The thick rain splattering the windows made it very difficult to see out of them. Ron undid his trunk, pulled out his maroon dress robes, and flung them over Pigwidgeon\rquote 
s cage to muffle his hooting.
\par \lquote Bagman wanted to tell us what\rquote s happening at Hogwarts,\rquote  he said grumpily, sitting down next to Harry. \lquote At the World Cup, remember? But my own mother won\rquote t say. Wonder what \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Shh!\rquote  Hermione whispered suddenly, pressing her finger to her lips and pointing towards the compartment next to theirs. Harry and Ron listened, and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door.
\par \lquote ... Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than Hogwarts, you know. He knows the Headmaster, you see. Well, you know his opinion of Dumbledore \endash  the man\rquote s such a Mudblood-lover \endash  and Durmstrang doesn

\par Hermione got up, tiptoed to the compartment door, and slid it shut, blocking out Malfoy\rquote s voice.
\par \lquote So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him, does he?\rquote  she said angrily. \lquote I wish he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 had }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 it puts a lot of emphasis on the Dark Arts.\rquote

\par \lquote Well, nobody knows, do they?\rquote  said Hermione, raising her eyebrows.
\par \lquote Er \endash  why not?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote There\rquote s traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets,\rquote  said Hermione matter-of-factly.
\par \lquote Come off it,\rquote  said Ron, starting to laugh. \lquote Durmstrang\rquote s got to be about the same size as Hogwarts, how are you going to hide a dirty great castle?\rquote

\par \lquote It\rquote s bewitched,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote If a Muggle looks at it, all they see is a mouldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying DANGER, DO NOT ENTER, UNSAFE.\rquote 
\par \lquote So Durmstrang\rquote ll just look like a ruin to an outsider, too?\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe,\rquote  said Hermione, shrugging, \lquote or it might have Muggle-Repelling Charms on it, like the World Cup Stadium. And to keep foreign wizards from finding it, they\rquote ll have made it Unplottable \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Come again?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, you can enchant a building so it\rquote s impossible to plot on a map, can\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ... if you say so,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north,\rquote  said Hermione thoughtfully. \lquote Somewhere very cold, because they\rquote ve got fur capes as part of their uniforms.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, think of the possibilities,\rquote  said Ron dreamily. \lquote It would\rquote ve been so easy to push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident ... shame his mother likes him ...\rquote 
\par The rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved further north. The sky was so 
dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by midday. The lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor, and Harry bought a large stack of Cauldron Cakes for them to share.
\par Several of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed, including Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas and Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, extremely forgetful boy who had been brought up by his formidable witch of a grand\-
mother. Seamus was still wearing his Ireland rosette. Some of its magic seemed to be wearing off now; it was still squeaking }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Troy! Mullet! Moran!\rquote ,}{

\par \lquote Oh, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 wow,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

\par \lquote For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.\rquote 
\par Draco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway. Behind him stood Crabbe and Goyle, his enormous, thuggish cronies, both of whom appeared to have grown at least a foot during the summe

\par \lquote Don\rquote t remember asking you to join us, Malfoy,\rquote  said Harry coolly.

\rquote s cage. A sleeve of Ron\rquote s dress robes was dangling from it, swaying with the motion of the train, the mouldy lace cuff very obvious.
\par Ron made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Malfoy was too quick for him; he seized the sleeve and pulled.
\par \lquote Look at this!\rquote  said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up Ron\rquote s robes and showing Crabbe and Goyle. \lquote Weasley, you weren\rquote t thinking of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

\par \lquote Eat dung, Malfoy!\rquote  said Ron, the same colour as the dress robes as he snatched them back out of Malfoy\rquote s grip. Malfoy howled with derisive laughter; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed stupidly.

stopped in the pitch-darkness of Hogsmeade station.
\par As the train doors opened, there was a rumble of thunder overhead. Hermione bundled Crookshanks up in her cloak and Ron left his dress robes over Pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads bent and eyes nar

less carriages stood waiting for them outside the station. Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville climbed gratefully into one of them, the door shut
 with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track towards Hogwarts castle.

Through the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying danger\-
ously in what was fast becoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted windows b
lurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain. Lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps. People who had occupied the carriages in front w

 narrowly missing Hermione, it burst at Harry\rquote s feet, sending a wave of cold water over his trainers into his socks. People all around them shrieked and started pushing each other in their efforts to get out of the line of fire \endash 
 Harry looked up, and saw, floating twenty feet above them, Peeves the poltergeist, a little man in a bell-covered hat and orange bow-tie, his wide, malicious face contorted with concentration as he took aim again.
\par \lquote PEEVES!\rquote  yelled an angry voice. \lquote Peeves, come down here at ONCE!\rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall, deputy headmistress and Head of Gryffindor house, had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself falling. \lquote Ouch \endash  sorry, Miss Granger \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s all right, Professor!\rquote  Hermione gasped, massaging her throat.
\par \lquote Peeves, get down here NOW!\rquote  barked Professor McGonagall, straightening her pointed hat and glaring upwards through her square-rimmed spectacles.
\par \lquote Not doing nothing!\rquote  cackled Peeves, lobbing a water bomb at several fifth-year girls, who screamed and dived into the Great Hall. \lquote Already wet, aren\rquote t they? Little squirts! Wheeeeeeeeee!\rquote 
 And he aimed another bomb at a group of second-years who had just arrived.
\par \lquote I shall call the Headmaster!\rquote  shouted Professor McGonagall. \lquote I\rquote m warning you, Peeves \endash \rquote 
\par Peeves stuck out his tongue, threw the last of his water bombs into the air, and zoomed off up the marble staircase, cackling insanely.
\par \lquote Well, move along, then!\rquote  said Professor McGonagall sharply to the bedraggled crowd. \lquote Into the Great Hall, come on!\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione slipped and slid across the Entrance Hall and through the double doors on the right, Ron muttering furiously under his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his face.
\par The Great Hall looked its usual splendid self, decorated for the start-of-term feast. Golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and hundreds of candles, floating over the tabl
es in mid-air. The four long house tables were packed with chattering students; at the top of the Hall, the staff sat along one side of a fifth table, facing their pupils. It was much warmer in here. Harry, Ron and Hermione walked past the Slytherins, the
 
Ravenclaws and the Hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the Hall, next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost. Pearly white and semi-transparent, Nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet, with a particu
larly large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking extra festive and ensuring that his head didn\rquote t wobble too much on his partially severed neck.
\par \lquote Good evening,\rquote  he said, beaming at them.
\par \lquote Says who?\rquote  said Harry, taking off his trainers and emptying them of water. \lquote Hope they hurry up with the Sorting, I\rquote m starving.\rquote 
\par The Sorting of the new students into houses took place at the start of every school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn\rquote t been present at one since his own. He was quite looking forward to it.
\par Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table, \lquote Hiya, Harry!\rquote 
\par It was Colin Creevey, a third-year to whom Harry was some\-thing of a hero.
\par \lquote Hi, Colin,\rquote  said Harry warily.
\par \lquote Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother\rquote s start\-ing! My brother Dennis!\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  good,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote He\rquote s really excited!\rquote  said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat. \lquote I just hope he\rquote s in Gryffindor! Keep your fin\-gers crossed, eh, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  yeah, all right,\rquote  said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron and Nearly Headless Nick. \lquote Brothers and sisters usually go in the same houses, don\rquote t they?\rquote 
 he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into Gryffindor.
\par \lquote Oh, no, not necessarily,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Parvati Patil\rquote s twin\rquote s in Ravenclaw, and they\rquote re identical, you\rquote d think they\rquote d be together, wouldn\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par Harry looked up at the staff table. There seemed to be rather more empty seats there than usual. Hagrid, of 
course, was still fighting his way across the lake with the first-years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervising the drying of the Entrance Hall floor, but there was another empty chair, too, and he couldn\rquote t think who else was missing.

\par \lquote Where\rquote s the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher?\rquote  said Hermione, who was also looking up at the teachers.
\par They had never yet had a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who had lasted more than three terms. Harry\rquote s favourite by far had been Professor Lupin, who
 had resigned last year. He looked up and down the staff table. There was definitely no new face there.
\par \lquote Maybe they couldn\rquote t get anyone!\rquote  said Hermione, looking anxious.
\par Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms tea
cher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside Professor Sprout, the Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway grey hair. She was talking to Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department. On Professor Sinistra\rquote 
s other side was the sallow-faced, hook-nosed, greasy-haired Potions master, Snape \endash  Harry\rquote s least favourite person at Hogwarts. Harry\rquote s loathing of Snape was matched only by Snape\rquote 
s hatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible, intensified last year, when Harry had helped Sirius escape right under Snape\rquote s overlarge nose \endash  Snape and Sirius had been enemies since their own schooldays.
\par On Snape\rquote s other side was an empty seat, which Harry guessed was Professor McGonagall\rquote s. Next to it, and in the very centre of the table, sat Profes
sor Dumbledore, the Headmaster, his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the candlelight, his magnificent deep-green robes embroidered with many stars and moons. The tips of Dumbledore\rquote 
s long, thin fingers were together and he was resting his chin upo
n them, staring up at the ceiling through his half-moon spectacles as though lost in thought. Harry glanced up at the ceiling, too. It was enchanted to look like the sky outside, and he had never seen it look this stormy. Black and purple clouds were swir
ling across it, and as another thunderclap sounded outside, a fork of lightning flashed across it.
\par \lquote Oh, hurry up,\rquote  Ron moaned, beside Harry. \lquote I could eat a Hippogriff.\rquote 
\par The words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the Great Hall opened, and s
ilence fell. Professor McGonagall was leading a long line of first-years up to the top of the Hall. If Harry, Ron and Hermione were wet, it was nothing to how these first-years looked. They appeared to have swum across the lake rather than sailing. All of
 them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school \endash 
 all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousey hair, who was wrapped in what Harry recognised as Hagrid\rquote 
s moleskin overcoat. The coat was so big for him that it looked as though he was draped in a furry black marquee. His small face protruded from over the collar, looking almost painfully excited. When he had lined up with his terrified-loo
king peers, he caught Colin Creevey\rquote s eye, gave a double thumbs-up and mouthed, \lquote I fell in the lake!\rquote  He looked posi\-tively delighted about it.
\par Professor McGonagall now placed a three-legged stool on the ground before the first-years and, on top of it, an extremely old, dirty, patched wizard\rquote 
s hat. The first-years stared at it. So did everyone else. For a moment, there was silence. Then a tear near the brim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat broke into song:

\par The rain was still drumming heavily against the high, dark windows. Another clap of thunder shook the windows, an

\par \lquote Treacle tart, Hermione!\rquote  said Ron, deliberately wafting its smell towards her. \lquote Spotted dick, look! Chocolate gateau!\rquote 
\par But Hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of Professor McGonagall that he gave up.
\par When the puddings, too, had been demolished, and the last crumbs had faded off the plates, leaving them sparkling clean, Albus Dumbledore got to his feet aga
in. The buzz of chatter filling the Hall ceased almost at once, so that only the howling wind and pounding rain could be heard.
\par \lquote So!\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling around at them all. \lquote Now that we are all fed and watered\rquote  (\lquote Hmph!\rquote  said Hermione), \lquote I must once more ask for your attention, while I give out a few notices.

\par The corners of Dumbledore\rquote s mouth twitched.
\par He continued, \lquote As ever, I would like to remind you all that the Forest in the grounds is out-of-bounds to students, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third year.
\par \lquote It is also my painful duty to inform you that the inter-house Quidditch Cup will not take place this year.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote What?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  Harry gasped. He
 looked around at Fred and George, his fellow members of the Quidditch team. They were mouthing soundlessly at Dumbledore, apparently too appalled to speak.
\par Dumbledore continued, \lquote This is due to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout the school year, taking up much of the teachers\rquote  time and energy \endash 
 but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely. I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts \endash \rquote 
\par But at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thun\-der, and the doors of the Great Hall banged open.
\par A man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long staff, shrouded in a black travelling cloak. Every head in the Great Hall swivelled towards the stranger, suddenly brightly illumi\-nated by a fork of lightning that flas
hed across the ceiling. He lowered his hood, shook out a long mane of grizzled, dark grey hair, then began to walk up towards the teachers\rquote  table.
\par A dull }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 clunk }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
echoed through the Hall on his every other step. He reached the end of the top table, turned right and limped heavily towards Dumbledore. Another flash of light\-ning crossed the ceiling. Hermione gasped.
\par The lightning had thrown the man\rquote s face into sharp relief, and it was a face unlike any Harry had ever seen. It looked as though it had been carved 
out of weathered wood by someone who had only the vaguest idea of what human faces were supposed to look like, and was none too skilled with a chisel. Every inch of skin seemed to be scarred. The mouth looked like a diagonal gash, and a large chunk of the
 nose was miss\-ing. But it was the man\rquote s eyes that made him frightening.
\par One of them was small, dark and beady. The other was large, round as a coin, and a vivid, electric blue. The blue eye was moving ceaselessly, without blinking, and was rolling up, down and from side to side, quite independently of the normal eye \endash 
 and then it rolled right over, pointing into the back of the man\rquote s head, so that all they could see was whiteness.
\par The stranger reached Dumbledore. He stretched out a hand that was as badly scarred as his face, and Dumbledore shook it, muttering words Harry couldn\rquote 
t hear. He seemed to be making some enquiry of the stranger, who shook his head unsmilingly and replied in an undertone. Dumbledore nodded, and gestured the man to the empty seat on his right-hand side.
\par The stranger sat down, shook his mane of dark grey hair out of his face, pulled a plate of sausages towards him, raised it to what was left of his nose and sniffed it. He then took a small knife out of his pocket, speared a sausage on the end of it, and b
egan to eat. His normal eye was fixed upon the sausages, but the blue eye was still darting restlessly around in its socket, taking in the Hall and the students.
\par \lquote May I introduce our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,\rquote  said Dumbledore brightly, into the silence. \lquote Professor Moody.\rquote 
\par It was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause, but none of the staff or students clapped except Dumbledore and Hagrid. Both put their hands together and applauded, but the sound echoed dismally into the sil
ence, and they stopped fairly quickly. Everyone else seemed too trans\-fixed by Moody\rquote s bizarre appearance to do more than stare at him.
\par \lquote Moody?\rquote  Harry muttered to Ron. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Mad-Eye Moody? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

\par \lquote Must be,\rquote  said Ron, in a low, awed voice.
\par \lquote What happened to him?\rquote  Hermione whispered. \lquote What happened to his }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 face?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Dunno,\rquote  Ron whispered back, watching Moody with fascination.
\par Moody seemed totally indifferent to his less-than-warm welcome. Ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in fron
t of him, he reached again into his travelling cloak, pulled out a hip-flask, and took a long draught from it. As he lifted his arm to drink, his cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground, and Harry saw, below the table, several inches of carved woode
n leg, ending in a clawed foot.
\par Dumbledore cleared his throat again.
\par \lquote As I was saying,\rquote  he said, smiling at the sea of students before him, all of whom were still gazing transfixed at Mad-Eye Moody, \lquote we are to have the honour of hosting a very exciting even
t over the coming months, an event which has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re JOKING!\rquote  said Fred Weasley loudly.
\par The tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody\rquote s arrival suddenly broke.
\par Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appre\-ciatively.

\par Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.
\par \lquote Er \endash  but maybe this is not the time ... no ...\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Where was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament ... well, some of you will not know what this Tournament involves, so I hope those who }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39

\par \lquote The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago, as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry \endash 
 Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the Tournament once every f
ive years, and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities \endash  until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the Tournament was discontinued.\rquote 

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Death toll?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Hermio
ne whispered, looking alarmed. But her anxiety did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the Hall; many of them were whispering excitedly with each other, and Harry himself was far more interested in hearing more about the Tournament than i
n worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds of years ago.
\par \lquote There have been several attempts over the centuries to re\-instate the Tournament,\rquote  Dumbledore continued, \lquote none of which have been very successful. However, our own Departments of Internationa
l Magical Co-operation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that, this time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger.
\par \lquote The Heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their short-listed contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions will take place at Hallowe\rquote 
en. An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m going for it!\rquote  Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only person who seemed to be visualis\-ing themself as 
Hogwarts champion. At every house table, Harry could see people either gazing raptly at Dumbledore, or else whispering fervently to their neighbours. But then Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall quietened once more.
\par \lquote Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts,\rquote  he said, \lquote the Heads of the partici\-
pating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year. Only students who are of age \endash  that is to say, seventeen years or older \endash  will be allowed to put forward their names for con
\-sideration. This\rquote  \endash  Dumbledore raised his voice slightly, for several people had made noises of outrage at these words, and the Weasley twins were suddenly looking furious \endash  \lquote is a measure we fee
l is necessary, given that the Tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them. I will personally be ensuring that no
 underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion.\rquote  His light-blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over Fred and George\rquote s mutinous faces. \lquote 
I therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen.
\par \lquote 
The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October, and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give your who
le-hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected. And now, it is late, and I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! Chop chop!\rquote 
\par Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad-Eye Moody. There was a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet, and swarmed towards the double doors into the Entrance Hall.
\par \lquote They can\rquote t do that!\rquote  said George Weasley, who had not joined the crowd moving towards the door, but was standing up and glaring at Dumbledore. \lquote We\rquote re seventeen in April, why can\rquote t we have a shot?\rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote re not stopping me entering,\rquote  said Fred stubbornly, also scowling at the top table. \lquote The champions\rquote ll get to do all sorts of stuff you\rquote d never be allowed to do normally. And a thousand Galleons prize money!
\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Ron, a faraway look on his face. \lquote Yeah, a thou\-sand Galleons ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Come on,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote we\rquote ll be the only ones left here if you don\rquote t move.\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred and George set off for the Entrance Hall, Fred and George debating the ways in which Dumbledore might stop those who were under seventeen entering the Tournament.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s this impartial judge who\rquote s going to decide who the champions are?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Dunno,\rquote  said Fred, \lquote but it\rquote s them we\rquote ll have to fool. I reckon a couple of drops of Ageing Potion might do it, George ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore knows you\rquote re not of age, though,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Yeah, but he\rquote s not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?\rquote  said Fred shrewdly. \lquote Sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter, he\rquote 
ll choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are. Dumbledore\rquote s trying to stop us giving our names.\rquote 
\par \lquote People have died, though!\rquote  said Hermione in a worried voice, as they walked through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up another, narrower staircase.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Fred airily, \lquote but that was years ago, wasn\rquote t it? Anyway, where\rquote s the fun without a bit of risk? Hey, Ron, what if we find out how to get round Dumbledore? Fancy entering?\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you reckon?\rquote  Ron asked Harry. \lquote Be cool to enter, wouldn\rquote t it? But I s\rquote pose they might want someone older ... dunno if we\rquote ve learnt enough ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I definitely haven\rquote t,\rquote  came Neville\rquote s gloomy voice from behind Fred and George. \lquote I expect my gran\rquote d want me to try, though, she\rquote s always going on about how I should be uphold\-ing the family honour. I
\rquote ll just have to \endash  ooops ...\rquote 
\par Neville\rquote s foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase. There were many of these trick stairs at Hogwarts; it was second nature to most of the older students to jump this particular step, but Neville\rquote 
s memory was notoriously poor. Harry and Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out, while a suit of armour at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily.
\par \lquote Shut it, you,\rquote  said Ron, banging down its visor as they passed.
\par They made their way up to the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, which was concealed behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink silk dress.
\par \lquote Password?\rquote  she said, as they approached.
\par \lquote Balderdash,\rquote  said George, \lquote a Prefect downstairs told me.\rquote 
\par The portrait swung forwards to reveal a hole in the wall, through which they all climbed. A crackling fire was warming the circular common room, which was full of squashy arm\-
chairs and tables. Hermione cast the merrily dancing flames a dark look, and Harry distinctly heard her mutter \lquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 slave labour\rquote , }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39

\par Harry, Ron and Neville climbed up the last, spiral staircase until they reached their own dormitory, which was situated at the top of the Tower. Five four-poster beds with deep crimson hangings stood against the walls, each with its owner\rquote 
s trunk at the foot
. Dean and Seamus were already getting into bed; Seamus had pinned his Ireland rosette to his headboard, and Dean had tacked up a poster of Viktor Krum over his bedside table. His old poster of West Ham football team was pinned right next to it.
\par \lquote Mental,\rquote  Ron sighed, shaking his head at the completely sta\-tionary soccer players.
\par Harry, Ron and Neville got into their pyjamas and into bed. Someone \endash  a house-elf, no doubt \endash  had placed warming pans between the sheets. It was extremely comfortable, lying there in bed and listening to the storm raging outside.

The storm had blown itself out by the following morning, though the ceiling in the Great Hall was still gloomy; heavy clouds of pewter grey swirled overhead as Harry, Ron and Hermione examined their new timetables at breakfast. A few seats along, Fred, Ge
orge and Lee Jordan were discussing mag\-ical methods of ageing themselves and bluffing their way into the Triwizard Tournament.

 said Ron, who was running his finger down his timetable, \lquote Herbology with the Hufflepuffs and Care of Magical Creatures ... damn it, we\rquote re still with the Slytherins ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Double Divination this afternoon,\rquote  Harry groaned, looking down. Divination was his least favourite subject, apart from Potions. Professor Trelawney kept predicting Harry\rquote s death, which he found extremely annoying.
\par \lquote You should have given it up like me, shouldn\rquote t you?\rquote  said Hermione briskly, buttering herself some toast. \lquote Then you\rquote d be doing something sensible like Arithmancy.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re eating again, I notice,\rquote  said Ron, watching Hermione add liberal amounts of jam to her buttered toast.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights,\rquote  said Hermione haughtily.
\par \lquote Yeah ... and you were hungry,\rquote  said Ron, grinning.
\par There was a sudden rustling noise above them, and a hun\-
dred owls came soaring through the open windows, carrying the morning mail. Instinctively, Harry looked up, but there was no sign of white among the mass of brown and grey. The owls circled the tables, looking for the people to whom their lette
rs and packages were addressed. A large tawny owl soared down to Neville Longbottom and deposited a parcel in his lap \endash  Neville almost always forgot to pack something. On the other side of the Hall Draco Malfoy\rquote 
s eagle owl had landed on his shoulder, carry
ing what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home. Trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach, Harry returned to his porridge. Was it possible that something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius hadn\rquote 
t even got his letter?
\par His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden veg\-etable path until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less 
like plants than thick black giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly, and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.
\par \lquote Bubotubers,\rquote  Professor Sprout told them briskly. \lquote They need squeezing. You will collect the pus \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote The }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 what?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.
\par \lquote Pus, Finnigan, pus,\rquote  said Professor Sprout, \lquote and it\rquote s extremely valuable, so don\rquote t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your drago
n-hide gloves, it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, Bubotuber pus.\rquote 
\par Squeezing the Bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfy\-ing. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongl
y of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.
\par \lquote This\rquote ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,\rquote  said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork. \lquote An excellent remedy 
for the more stubborn forms of acne, Bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.\rquote 
\par \lquote Like poor Eloise Midgen,\rquote  said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a hushed voice. \lquote She tried to curse hers off.\rquote 
\par \lquote Silly girl,\rquote  said Professor Sprout, shaking her head. \lquote But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end.\rquote 
\par A booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds, signalling the end of the lesson, and the class separat\-ed; the Hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for Trans\-
figuration, and the Gryffindors heading in the other direction, down the sloping lawn towards Hagrid\rquote s small wooden cabin, which stood on the edge of the Forbidden Forest.
\par Hagrid was standing outside his hut, one hand on the collar of his
 enormous black boarhound, Fang. There were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet, and Fang was whimpering and straining at his collar, apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely. As they drew nearer, an odd rattling noise rea
ched their ears, punctuated by what sounded like minor explosions.
\par \lquote Mornin\rquote !\rquote  Hagrid said, grinning at Harry, Ron and Hermione. \lquote Be\rquote er wait fer the Slytherins, they won\rquote  want ter miss this \endash  Blast-Ended Skrewts!\rquote 
\par \lquote Come again?\rquote  said Ron.
\par Hagrid pointed down into the crates.
\par \lquote Eurgh!\rquote  squealed Lavender Brown, jumping backwards.
\par \lquote Eurgh\rquote  just about summed up the Blast-Ended Skrewts, in Harry\rquote s opinion. They looked like deformed, shell-less lobsters, horribly pale and slimy-looking, with legs sti
cking out in very odd places and no visible heads. There were about a hundred of them in each crate, each about six inches long, crawling over each other, bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes. They were giving off a very powerful smell of rotting f
ish. Every now and then, sparks would fly out of the end of a Skrewt and, with a small }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 phut, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 it would be propelled forwards several inches.
\par \lquote On\rquote y jus\rquote  hatched,\rquote  said Hagrid proudly, \lquote so yeh\rquote ll be able ter raise \rquote em yerselves! Thought we\rquote d make a bit of a project of it!\rquote 
\par \lquote And why would we }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 want }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 to raise them?\rquote  said a cold voice.
\par The Slytherins had arrived. The speaker was Draco Malfoy. Crabbe and Goyle were chuckling appreciatively at his words.
\par Hagrid looked stumped at the question.
\par \lquote I mean, what do they }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 do?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 asked Malfoy. \lquote What is the }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 point }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 of them?\rquote 
\par Hagrid opened his mouth, apparently thinking hard; there was a few seconds\rquote  pause, then he said roughly, \lquote Tha\rquote s next lesson, Malfoy. Yer jus\rquote  feedin\rquote  \rquote em today. Now, yeh\rquote ll wan\rquote  ter try \rquote 
em on a few diff\rquote rent things \endash  I\rquote ve never had \rquote em before, not sure what they\rquote ll go fer \endash  I got ant eggs an\rquote  frog livers an\rquote  a bit o\rquote  grass-snake \endash  just try \rquote 
em out with a bit of each.\rquote 
\par \lquote First pus and now this,\rquote  muttered Seamus.
\par Nothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry, Ron and Hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the Blast-Ended Skrewts. Harry couldn\rquote 
t suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless, because the Skrewts didn\rquote t seem to have mouths.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Ouch!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 yelled Dean Thomas, after about ten minutes. \lquote 
It got me!\rquote 
\par Hagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious.
\par \lquote Its end exploded!\rquote  said Dean angrily, showing Hagrid a burn on his hand.
\par \lquote Ah, yeah, that can happen when they blast off,\rquote  said Hagrid, nodding.
\par \lquote Eurgh!\rquote  said Lavender Brown again. \lquote Eurgh, Hagrid, what\rquote s that pointy thing on it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, some of \rquote em have got stings,\rquote  said Hagrid enthusiastically (Lavender quickly withdrew her hand from the box). \lquote I reckon they\rquote re the males ... the females\rquote 
ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies ... I think they might be ter suck blood.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I can certainly see why we\rquote re trying to keep them alive,\rquote  said Malfoy sarcastically. \lquote Who wouldn\rquote t want pets that can burn, sting and bite all at once?\rquote 
\par \lquote Just because they\rquote re not very pretty, it doesn\rquote t mean they\rquote re not useful,\rquote  Hermione snapped. \lquote Dragon blood\rquote s amazingly magical, but you wouldn\rquote t want a dragon for a pet, would you?\rquote 
\par Harry and Ron grinned at Hagrid, who gave them a furtive smile from behind his bushy beard. Hagrid would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon, as Harry, Ron and Hermione knew only too well \endash  he had owned one for a brief period dur\-
ing their first year, a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of Norbert. Hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures \endash  the more lethal, the better.
\par \lquote Well, at least the Skrewts are small,\rquote  said Ron, as they made their way back up to the castle for lunch an hour later.
\par \lquote They are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 now,\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  said Hermione in an exasperated voice, \lquote 
but once Hagrid\rquote s found out what they eat, I expect they\rquote ll be six feet long.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, that won\rquote t matter if they turn out to cure sea sickness or something, will it?\rquote  said Ron, grinning slyly at her.
\par \lquote You know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote As a matter of fact I think he\rquote s right. The best thing to do would be to stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking us all.\rquote 
\par They sat down at the Gryffindor table and helped them\-selves to lamb chops and potatoes. Hermione began to eat so fast that Harry and Ron stared at her.
\par \lquote Er \endash  is this the new stand on elf rights?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote You\rquote re going to make yourself puke instead?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Hermione, with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts. \lquote I just want to get to the library.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote What?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  said Ron in disbelief. \lquote Hermione \endash  it\rquote 
s the first day back! We haven\rquote t even got homework yet!\rquote 
\par Hermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her food as though she had not eaten for days. Then she leapt to her feet, said, \lquote See you at dinner!\rquote  and departed at high speed.
\par When the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon le
ssons, Harry and Ron set off for North Tower where, at the top of a tightly spiralling staircase, a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling, and the room where Professor Trelawney lived.
\par The familiar sweet perfume emanating from the fir
e met their nostrils as they emerged at the top of the stepladder. As ever, the curtains were all closed; the circular room was bathed in a dim reddish light cast by the many lamps, which were all draped with scarves and shawls. Harry and Ron walked throu
gh the mass of occupied chintz chairs and pouffes that cluttered the room, and sat down at the same small circular table.
\par \lquote Good day,\rquote  said the misty voice of Professor Trelawney right behind Harry, making him jump.
\par A very thin woman with enormous glasses th
at made her eyes appear far too large for her face, Professor Trelawney was peering down at Harry with the tragic expression she always wore whenever she saw him. The usual large amount of beads, chains and bangles glittered upon her person in the firelig
ht.
\par \lquote You are preoccupied, my dear,\rquote  she said mournfully to Harry. \lquote My Inner Eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within. And I regret to say that your worries are not base\-
less. I see difficult times ahead for you, alas ... most difficult ... I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass ... and perhaps sooner than you think ...\rquote 
\par Her voice dropped almost to a whisper. Ron rolled his eyes at Harry, who looked stonily back. Professor Trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a large w
inged armchair before the fire, facing the class. Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil, who deeply admired Professor Trelawney, were sitting on pouffes very close to her.
\par \lquote My dears, it is time for us to consider the stars,\rquote  she said. \lquote The movements of the plan
ets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance. Human destiny may be deciphered by the plan\-etary rays, which intermingle \'85\rquote 
\par But Harry\rquote s thoughts had drifted. The perfumed fire always made him feel sleepy and dull-witted, and Professor Trelawney\rquote s rambling talks on fortune-telling never held him exactly spellbound \endash  though he couldn\rquote 
t help thinking about what she had just said to him. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass ...\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par But Hermione was right, Harry thought irritably, Professor Trelawney really was an old fraud. He wasn\rquote 
t dreading anything at the moment at all ... well, unless you counted his fears that Sirius had been caught ... but what did Professor Trelawney know? He had lon
g since come to the conclusion that her brand of fortune-telling was really no more than lucky guess-work and a spooky manner.
\par Except, of course, for that time at the end of last term, when she had made the prediction about Voldemort rising again ... and Dumbledore himself had said that he thought that trance had been genuine, when Harry had described it to him ...
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Harry!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Ron muttered.
\par \lquote What?\rquote 
\par Harry looked around; the whole class was staring at him. He sat up straight; he had been almost dozing off, lost in the heat and his thoughts.
\par \lquote I was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, a faint note of resentment in her voice at the fact that he had obviously not been hanging on her words.
\par \lquote Born under \endash  what, sorry?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Saturn, dear, the planet Saturn!\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, sounding definitely irritated that he wasn\rquote t riveted by this news. \lquote I was saying that Saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of 
your birth ... your dark hair ... your mean stature ... tragic losses so young in life ... I think I am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in mid-winter?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote I was born in July.\rquote 
\par Ron hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough.
\par Half an hour later, each of them had been given a complicat\-ed circular chart, and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment of birth. It was dull work, requir\-ing much consultation of timetables and calculation of angles.

\par \lquote I\rquote ve got two Neptunes here,\rquote  said Harry after a while, frown\-ing down at his piece of parchment, \lquote that can\rquote t be right, can it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Aaaaah,\rquote  said Ron, imitating Professor Trelawney\rquote s mystical whisper, \lquote when two Neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born, Harry ...\rquote 
\par Seamus and Dean, who were working nearby, sniggered loudly, though not loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from Lavender Brown \endash  \lquote Oh, Professor, look! I think I\rquote ve got an unaspected planet! Oooh, which one\rquote 
s that, Professor?\rquote 
\par \lquote It is Uranus, my dear,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, peering down at the chart.
\par \lquote Can I have a look at Uranus, too, Lavender?\rquote  said Ron.
\par Most unfortunately, Professor Trelawney heard him, and it was this, perhaps, which made her give them so much home\-work at the end of the class.
\par \lquote A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you, with reference to your per\-sonal chart,\rquote  she snapped, sounding much more like Professor McGonagall than her usual airy-fairy self. \lquote 
I want it ready to hand in next Monday, and no excuses!\rquote 
\par \lquote Miserable old bat,\rquote  said Ron bitterly, as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the Great Hall and dinner. \lquote That\rquote ll take all weekend, that will ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Lots of homework?\rquote  said Hermione brightly, catching up with them. \lquote Professor Vector didn\rquote t give }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 us }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 any at all!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, bully for Professor Vector,\rquote  said Ron moodily.
\par They reached the Entrance Hall, which was packed with people queuing for dinner. They had just joined the end of the line, when a loud voice rang out behind them.
\par \lquote Weasley! Hey, Weasley!\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione turned. Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle were standing there, each looking thoroughly pleased about something.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Ron shortly.
\par \lquote Your dad\rquote s in the paper, Weasley!\rquote  said Malfoy, brandishing a copy of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Daily Prophet, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote OH NO YOU DON\rquote T, LADDIE!\rquote 
\par Harry spun around. Professor Moody was limping down the marble staircase. His wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret, which was shivering on the stone-flagged floor, exactly where Malfoy had been standing.
\par There was a terrified silence in the Entrance Hall. Nobody but Moody was moving a muscle. Moody turned to look at Harry \endash  at least, his normal eye was looking at Harry; the other one was pointing into the back of his head.
\par \lquote Did he get you?\rquote  Moody growled. His voice was low and gravelly.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote missed.\rquote 
\par \lquote LEAVE IT!\rquote  Moody shouted.
\par \lquote Leave \endash  what?\rquote  Harry said, bewildered.
\par \lquote Not you \endash  him!\rquote  Moody growled, jerking his thumb over his shoulder at Crabbe, who had just frozen, about to pick up the white ferret. It seemed that Moody\rquote s rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his head.

\par Moody started to limp towards Crabbe, Goyle and the ferret, which gave a terrified squeak and took off, streaking towards the dungeons.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think so!\rquote  roared Moody, pointing his wand at the ferret again \endash  it flew ten feet into the air, fell with a smack to the floor, and then bounced upwards once more.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t like people who attack when their opponent\rquote s back\rquote s turned,\rquote  growled Moody, as the ferret bounced higher and higher, squealing in pain. \lquote Stinking, cowardly, scummy thing to do ...\rquote

\par \lquote Never \endash  do \endash  that \endash  again \endash \rquote  said Moody, speaking each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and bounced upwards again.
\par \lquote Professor Moody!\rquote  said a shocked voice.

\par \lquote Hello, Professor McGonagall,\rquote  said Moody calmly, bouncing the ferret still higher.
\par \lquote What \endash  what are you doing?\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, her eyes following the bouncing ferret\rquote s progress through the air.
\par \lquote Teaching,\rquote  said Moody.

\par \lquote Yep,\rquote  said Moody.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  cried Professor McGonagall, running down the stairs and pulling out her wand; a moment later, with a loud snap\-ping noise, Drac

\par \lquote Moody, we }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 never }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 use Transfiguration as a punishment!\rquote

\par \lquote We give detentions, Moody! Or speak to the offender\rquote s Head of house!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll do that, then,\rquote  said Moody, staring at Malfoy with great dislike.
\par Malfoy, whose pale eyes were still watering with pain and humiliation, looked malevolently up at Moody and muttered something in which the words \lquote my father\rquote  were distinguish\-able.
\par \lquote Oh yeah?\rquote  said Moody quietly, limping forward a few steps, the dull }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 clunk }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Malfoy resentfully.
\par \lquote Another old friend,\rquote  growled Moody. \lquote I\rquote ve been looking forward to a chat with old Snape ... come on, you ...\rquote  And he seized Malfoy\rquote s upper arm and marched him off towards the dungeons.
\par Professor McGonagall stared anxiously after them for a few moments, then waved her wand at her fallen books, causing them to soar up into the air and back into her arms.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t talk to me,\rquote  Ron said quietly to Harry and Hermione, as they sat down at the Gryffindor table a few minutes later, surrounded by excited talk on all sides about what had just happened.
\par \lquote Why not?\rquote  said Hermione in surprise.
\par \lquote Because I want to fix that in my memory for ever,\rquote  said Ron, his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face. \lquote Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret ...\rquote 
\par Harry and Hermione both laughed, and Hermione began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates.
\par \lquote He could have really hurt Malfoy, though,\rquote  she said. \lquote It was good, really, that Professor McGonagall stopped it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hermione!\rquote  said Ron furiously, his eyes snapping open again. \lquote You\rquote re ruining the best moment of my life!\rquote 
\par Hermione made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed again.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t tell me you\rquote re going back to the library this evening?\rquote  said Harry, watching her.
\par \lquote Got to,\rquote  said Hermione thickly. \lquote Loads to do.\rquote 
\par \lquote But you told us Professor Vector \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s not schoolwork,\rquote  she said. Within five minutes, she had cleared her plate and departed.
\par No sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by Fred Weasley. \lquote Moody!\rquote  he said. \lquote How cool is he?\rquote 
\par \lquote Beyond cool,\rquote  said George, sitting down opposite Fred.
\par \lquote Supercool,\rquote  said the twins\rquote  best friend, Lee Jordan, sliding into the seat beside George. \lquote We had him this afternoon,\rquote  he told Harry and Ron.
\par \lquote What was it like?\rquote  said Harry eagerly.

The next two days passed without great incident, unless you counted Neville melting his sixth cauldron in Potions. Professor Snape, who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer, gave Neville detention, a
nd Neville returned from it in a state of nervous collapse, having been made to disembowel a barrelful of horned toads.

 said Ron to Harry, as they watched Hermione teaching Neville a Scouring Charm to remove the toad guts from under his fingernails.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Moody.\rquote 
\par It was common knowledge that Snape really wanted the Dark Arts job, and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running. Snape had disliked all of their previous Dark Arts teachers, and shown it \endash 
 but he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to Mad-Eye Moody. Indeed, when\-ever Harry saw the two of them together \endash  at mealtimes, or when they passed in the corridors \endash  he had the distinct impres\-sion that Snape w
as avoiding Moody\rquote s eye, whether magical or normal.
\par \lquote I reckon Snape\rquote s a bit scared of him, you know,\rquote  Harry said thoughtfully.
\par \lquote Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad,\rquote  said Ron, his eyes misting over, \lquote and bounced him all around his dungeon ...\rquote 
\par The Gryffindor fourth-years were looking forward to Moody\rquote s first lesson so much that they arrived early after lunch on Thursday and queued up outside his classroom before the bell had even rung.
\par The only person missing was Hermione, who turned up just in time for the lesson.
\par \lquote Been in the \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  library,\rquote  Harry finished her sentence for her. \lquote C\rquote mon, quick, or we won\rquote t get decent seats.\rquote 
\par They hurried into three chairs right in front of the teacher\rquote s desk, took out their copies of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 and waited, unusually quiet. Soon they heard Moody\rquote 
s distinctive clunking footsteps coming down the corridor, and he entered the room, looking as strange and frightening as ever. They could just see his clawed, wooden foot protruding from underneath his robes.
\par \lquote You can put those away,\rquote  he growled, stumping over to his desk and sitting down, \lquote those books. You won\rquote t need them.\rquote 
\par They returned the books to their bags, Ron looking excited.
\par Moody took out a register, shook his long mane of grizzled grey hair out of his twisted and scarred face and began to call out names, his normal eye moving steadily down the list while his magical eye swivelled around, fixing upon each student as he or sh
e answered.
\par \lquote Right then,\rquote  he said, when the last person had declared themselves present, \lquote I\rquote ve had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class. Seems you\rquote ve had a pretty thorough ground\-ing in tackling Dark creatures \endash 
 you\rquote ve covered Boggarts, Red Caps, Hinkypunks, Grindylows, Kappas and werewolves, is that right?\rquote 
\par There was a general murmur of assent.
\par \lquote But you\rquote re behind \endash  very behind \endash  on dealing with curses,\rquote  said Moody. \lquote So I\rquote m here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other. I\rquote ve 
got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What, aren\rquote t you staying?\rquote  Ron blurted out.
\par Moody\rquote s magical eye spun around to stare at Ron; Ron looked extremely apprehensive, but after a moment Moody smiled \endash  the first time Harry had seen him do so. T
he effect was to make his heavily scarred face look more twisted and contorted than ever, but it was nevertheless a relief to know that he ever did anything as friendly as smile. Ron looked deeply relieved.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll be Arthur Weasley\rquote s son, eh?\rquote  Moody said. \lquote Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago ... yeah, I\rquote 
m staying just the one year. Special favour to Dumbledore ... one year, and then back to my quiet retirement.\rquote 
\par He gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled hands together.
\par \lquote So \endash  straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths and forms. Now, according to the Ministry of Magic, I\rquote m supposed to teach you counter-curses and leave it at that. I\rquote 
m not supposed to show you what illegal Dark curses look like until you\rquote re in the sixth year. You\rquote re not supposed to be old enough to deal with it \rquote til then. But Professor Dumbledore\rquote 
s got a higher opinion of your nerves, he reckons you can cope, and I say, the sooner you know what you\rquote re up against, the better. How are you supposed to defend your\-self against something you\rquote ve never seen? A wizard who\rquote 
s about to put an illegal curse on you isn\rquote t going to tell you what he\rquote s about to do. He\rquote s not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need to be alert an
d watchful. You need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I\rquote m talking.\rquote 
\par Lavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing Parvati her completed horoscope under the desk. Apparently Moody\rquote s magical eye could see through solid wood, as well as out of the back of his head.
\par \lquote So ... do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding law?\rquote 
\par Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron\rquote s and Hermione\rquote s. Moody pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender.
\par \lquote Er,\rquote  said Ron tentatively, \lquote my dad told me about one ... is it called the Imperius curse, or something?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, yes,\rquote  said Moody appreciatively. \lquote Your father }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 would }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
know that one. Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius curse.\rquote 
\par Moody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and took out a glass jar. Three large, black spiders were scuttling around inside it. Harry felt Ron recoil slightly next to him \endash  Ron hated spiders.
\par Moody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it.
\par He then pointed his wand at it, and muttered, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Imperio!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par The spider leapt from Moody\rquote s hand on a fine thread of silk, and began to swing backwards and forwards as though on a trapeze. It stre
tched out its legs rigidly, then did a backflip, breaking the thread and landing on the desk, where it began to cartwheel in circles. Moody jerked his wand, and the spider rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmis\-takeably a tap dance.

\par Everyone was laughing \endash  everyone except Moody.
\par \lquote Think it\rquote s funny, do you?\rquote  he growled. \lquote You\rquote d like it, would you, if I did it to you?\rquote 
\par The laughter died away almost instantly.
\par \lquote Total control,\rquote  said Moody quietly, as the spider balled itself up and began to roll over and over. \lquote I could make it jump out of the window, drown itself, throw itself down one of your throats ...\rquote 
\par Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
\par \lquote Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius curse,\rquote  said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. \lquote 
Some job for the Ministry, trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their own free will.
\par \lquote The Imperius curse can be fought, and I\rquote ll be teaching you how, but it takes real strength of character, and not everyone\rquote s got it. Better avoid being hit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!\rquote 
 he barked, and everyone jumped.
\par Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar. \lquote Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?\rquote 
\par Hermione\rquote s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry\rquote s slight surprise, did Neville\rquote s. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered information was Herbology, which was easily his best subject. Neville 
looked surprised at his own daring.
\par \lquote Yes?\rquote  said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to fix on Neville.
\par \lquote There\rquote s one \endash  the Cruciatus curse,\rquote  said Neville, in a small but distinct voice.
\par Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes.
\par \lquote Your name\rquote s Longbottom?\rquote  he said, his magical eye swoop\-ing down to check the register again.
\par Neville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further enquiries. Turning back to the class at large, he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop, where it remained motionless, apparently too scared to move.
\par \lquote The Cruciatus curse,\rquote  said Moody. \lquote Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea,\rquote  he said, pointing his wand at the spider. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote

\par The spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning all pretence, Ron pushed his chair backwards, as far away from Moody\rquote s desk as possible.
\par Moody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Crucio!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par At once, the spider\rquote s legs bent in upon its body; it rolled over and began to twitch horribly, rocking from side to side. No sound came from it, but Harry was sure that if it could have given voice, it would have been screaming. Moody did not remo
ve his wand, and the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently \endash 
\par \lquote Stop it!\rquote  Hermione said shrilly.
\par Harry looked around at her. She was looking, not at the spi\-der, but at Neville, and Harry, following her gaze, saw that Neville\rquote s hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified.
\par Moody raised his wand. The spider\rquote s legs relaxed, but it con\-tinued to twitch.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Reducio,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
Moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper size. He put it back into the jar.
\par \lquote Pain,\rquote  said Moody softly. \lquote You don\rquote t need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus curse ... that one was very popular once, too.
\par \lquote Right ... anyone know any others?\rquote 
\par Harry looked around. From the looks on everyone\rquote s faces, he guessed they were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider. Hermione\rquote s hand shook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into the air.
\par \lquote Yes?\rquote  said Moody, looking at her.

\par He put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as though it knew what was coming, the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar, trying to evade Moody\rquote 
s fingers, but he trapped it, and placed it upon the desktop. It started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surface.
\par Moody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Avada Kedavra!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Moody roared.
\par There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a vast, invisible something was soaring through the air \endash  instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmark
ed, but unmistakably dead. Several of the girls stifled cries; Ron had thrown himself backwards and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded towards him.
\par Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.
\par \lquote Not nice,\rquote  he said calmly. \lquote Not pleasant. And there\rquote s no counter-curse. There\rquote s no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he\rquote s sitting right in front of me.\rquote 
\par Harry felt his face redden as Moody\rquote s eyes (both of them) looked into his own. He could feel everyone else looking around at him, too. Harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at all ...
\par So that was how his parents had died ... exactly like that spider. Had they been unblemished and unmarked, too? Had they simply seen the flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their bodies?
\par Harry had been picturing his parents\rquote  deaths over and over again for three years now, ever since he had found out they had been murdered, ever since he\rquote d found out what had happened that night: how Wormtail had betrayed his parents\rquote 
 where\-abouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How Voldemort had killed Harry\rquote s father first. How James Potter had tried to hold him off, while he sh
outed at his wife to take Harry and run ... and Voldemort had advanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill Harry ... how she had begged him to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son ... and so Voldemort had murdered h
er, too, before turning his wand on Harry ...
\par Harry knew these details because he had heard his parents\rquote  voices when he had fought the Dementors last year \endash 
 for that was the terrible power of the Dementors: to force their victim to relive the worst memories of their life, and drown, power\-less, in their own despair ...
\par Moody was speaking again, from a great distance, it seemed to Harry. With a massive effort, he pulled himself back to the present, and listened to what Moody was saying.
\par \lquote Avada Kedavra\rquote s a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it \endash  you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I\rquote d get so much as a nose-bleed. But that doesn\rquote t matter. I
\rquote m not here to teach you how to do it.
\par \lquote Now, if there\rquote s no counter-curse, why am I showing you? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Because you\rquote ve got to know. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

 he roared, and the whole class jumped again.
\par \lquote Now ... those three curses \endash  Avada Kedavra, Imperius and Cruciatus \endash  are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That\rquote s what you
\rquote re up against. That\rquote s what I\rquote ve got to teach you to fight. You need preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you need to practise }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 con\-

\par They spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the Unforgivable Curses. No one spoke until the bell rang \endash  but when Moody had dismissed them and they had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst forth. Most people were discussi
ng the curses in awed voices \endash  \lquote Did you see it twitch?\rquote  \lquote \endash  and when he killed it \endash  just like that!\rquote 
\par They were talking about the lesson, Harry thought, as though it had been some sort of spectacular show, but he hadn\rquote t found it very entertaining \endash  and nor, it seemed, had Hermione.
\par \lquote Hurry up,\rquote  she said tensely to Harry and Ron.
\par \lquote Not the ruddy library again?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side passage. \lquote Neville.\rquote 
\par Neville was standing alone, halfway up the passage, staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified, wide-eyed look he had worn when Moody had demonstrated the Cruciatus curse.
\par \lquote Neville?\rquote  Hermione said gently.
\par Neville looked around.
\par \lquote Oh, hello,\rquote  he said, his voice much higher than usual. \lquote Interesting lesson, wasn\rquote t it? I wonder what\rquote s for dinner, I\rquote m \endash  I\rquote m starving, aren\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Neville, are you all right?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Oh, yes, I\rquote m fine,\rquote  Neville gabbled, in the same unnaturally high voice. \lquote Very interesting dinner \endash  I mean lesson \endash  what\rquote s for eating?\rquote 
\par Ron gave Harry a startled look.
\par \lquote Neville, what \endash ?\rquote 
\par But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see Professor Moody limping towards them. All four of them fell silent, watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard.

\par \lquote It\rquote s all right, sonny,\rquote  he said to Neville. \lquote Why don\rquote t you come up to my office? Come on ... we can have a cup of tea ...\rquote 
\par Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody. He neither moved nor spoke.
\par Moody turned his magical eye upon Harry. \lquote You all right, are you, Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry, almost defiantly.
\par Moody\rquote s blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it sur\-veyed Harry.
\par Then he said, \lquote You\rquote ve got to know. It seems harsh, maybe, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 but you\rquote ve got to know. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Neville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron and Hermione, but they didn\rquote t say anything, so Neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away, one of Moody\rquote s gnarled hands on his shoulder.
\par \lquote What was that about?\rquote  said Ron, watching Neville and Moody turn the corner.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Hermione, looking pensive.
\par \lquote Some lesson, though, eh?\rquote  said Ron to Harry, as they set off for the Great Hall. \lquote Fred and George were right, weren\rquote t they? He really knows his stuff, Moody, doesn\rquote 
t he? When he did Avada Kedavra, the way that spider just }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 died, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
just snuffed it right \endash \rquote 
\par But Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry\rquote s face, and didn\rquote t speak again until they reached the Great Hall, when he said he supposed they had better make a start on Professor Trelawney\rquote 
s predictions tonight, as they would take hours.
\par Hermione did not join in with Harry and Ron\rquote 
s conversation during dinner, but ate furiously fast, and then left for the library again. Harry and Ron walked back to Gryffindor Tower, and Harry, who had been thinking of nothing else all through dinner, now raised the subject of the
 Unforgivable Curses himself.
\par \lquote Wouldn\rquote t Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if they knew we\rquote d seen the curses?\rquote  Harry asked, as they approached the Fat Lady.
\par \lquote Yeah, probably,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote But Dumbledore\rquote s always done things his way, hasn\rquote t he, and Moody\rquote s been getting in trouble for years, I reckon. Attacks first and asks questions later \endash 
 look at his dustbins. Balderdash.\rquote 
\par The Fat Lady swung forwards to reveal the entrance hole, and they climbed into Gryffindor common room, which was crowded and noisy.
\par \lquote Shall we get our Divination stuff, then?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote I s\rquote pose,\rquote  Ron groaned.
\par They went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts, and found Neville there alone, sitting on his bed, reading. He looked a good deal calmer than at the end of Moody\rquote s lesson, though still not entirely normal. His eyes were rather red.

\par \lquote You all right, Neville?\rquote  Harry asked him.
\par \lquote Oh yes,\rquote  said Neville, \lquote I\rquote m fine, thanks. Just reading this book Professor Moody lent me ...\rquote 
\par He held up the book: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Magical Mediterranean Water-Plants and Their Properties.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 

\par \lquote Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I\rquote m really good at Herbology,\rquote  Neville said. There was a faint note of pride in his voice that Harry had rarely heard there before. \lquote He thought I\rquote d like this.\rquote 

\par Telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry thought, had been a very tactful way of cheering Neville up, for Neville very rarely heard that he was good at anything. It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have done.
\par Harry and Ron took their copies of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Unfogging the Future }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
back down to the common room, found a table and set to work on their predictions for the coming month. An hour later, they had made very little progress, though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols, and Harry\rquote 
s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney\rquote s fire.
\par \lquote I haven\rquote t got a clue what this lot\rquote s supposed to mean,\rquote  he said, staring down at a long list of calculations.
\par \lquote You know,\rquote  said Ron, whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration, \lquote I think it\rquote s back to the old Divination standby.\rquote 
\par \lquote What \endash  make it up?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table, dipping his pen into some ink and starting to write.
\par \lquote Next Monday,\rquote  he said, as he scribbled, \lquote I am likely to develop a cough, owing to the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter.\rquote  He looked up at Harry. \lquote You know her \endash  just put in loads of misery, she\rquote 
ll lap it up.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first-years into the fire. \lquote OK ... on Monday, I will be in danger of \endash  er \endash  burns.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, you will be,\rquote  said Ron darkly, \lquote we\rquote re seeing the Skrewts again on Monday. OK, Tuesday, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 I\rquote ll}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Lose a treasured possession,\rquote  said Harry, who was flicking through }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Unfogging the Future }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 for ideas.
\par \lquote Good one,\rquote  said Ron, copying it down. \lquote Because of ... erm ... Mercury. Why don\rquote t you get stabbed in the back by some\-one you thought was a friend?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... cool ...\rquote  said Harry, scribbling it down, \lquote because ... Venus is in the twelfth house.\rquote 
\par \lquote And on Wednesday, I think I\rquote ll come off worst in a fight.\rquote 
\par \lquote Aaah, I was going to have a fight. OK, I\rquote ll lose a bet.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, you\rquote ll be betting I\rquote ll win my fight ...\rquote 
\par They continued to make up predictions (which grew stead\-
ily more tragic) for another hour, while the common room around them slowly emptied as people went up to bed. Crookshanks wandered over to them, leapt lightly into an empty chair, and stared inscrutably at Harry, rather as Hermione might look if she knew 
they weren\rquote t doing their homework properly.
\par Staring around the room, trying to think of a kind of misfor\-tune he hadn\rquote t yet used, Harry saw Fred and George sitting together against the opposite wall, heads together, quills out, poring over a single piece of
 parchment. It was most unusual to see Fred and George hidden away in a corner and working silently; they usually liked to be in the thick of things, and the noisy centre of attention. There was something secretive about the way they were working on the p
iece of parchment, and Harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at The Burrow. He had thought then that it was another order form for }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
Weasleys\rquote  Wizard Wheezes, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 but it didn\rquote t look like that this time; if it had been, they would 
surely have let Lee Jordan in on the joke. He wondered whether it had anything to do with entering the Triwizard Tournament.
\par As Harry watched, George shook his head at Fred, scratched something out with his quill and said, in a very quiet voice that nevertheless carried across the almost deserted room, \lquote No \endash  that sounds like we\rquote 
re accusing him. Got to be careful ...\rquote 
\par Then George looked over and saw Harry watching him. Harry grinned, and quickly returned to his predictions \endash  he didn\rquote t want George to think he
 was eavesdropping. Shortly after that, the twins rolled up their parchment, said goodnight and went off to bed.
\par Fred and George had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and Hermione climbed into the common room, carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked, in the other. Crook\-
shanks arched his back, purring.
\par \lquote Hello,\rquote  she said, \lquote I\rquote ve just finished!\rquote 
\par \lquote So have I!\rquote  said Ron triumphantly, throwing down his quill.
\par Hermione sat down, laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair and pulled Ron\rquote s predictions towards her.
\par \lquote Not going to have a very good month, are you?\rquote  she said sardonically, as Crookshanks curled up in her lap.
\par \lquote Ah well, at least I\rquote m forewarned,\rquote  Ron yawned.
\par \lquote You seem to be drowning twice,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Oh, am I?\rquote  said Ron, peering down at his predictions. \lquote I\rquote d better change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging Hippogriff.\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you think it\rquote s a bit obvious you\rquote ve made these up?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote How dare you!\rquote  said Ron, in mock outrage. \lquote We\rquote ve been working like house-elves here!\rquote 
\par Hermione raised her eyebrows.
\par \lquote It\rquote s just an expression,\rquote  said Ron hastily.
\par Harry laid down his quill, too, having just finished predict\-ing his own death by decapitation.
\par \lquote What\rquote s in the box?\rquote  he asked, pointing at it.
\par \lquote Funny you should ask,\rquote  said Hermione, with a nasty look at Ron. She took off the lid, and showed them the contents.
\par Inside were about fifty badges, all of different colours, but all bearing the same letters: S.P.E.W.
\par \lquote  \'93Spew\'94?\rquote  said Harry, picking up a badge and looking at it. \lquote What\rquote s this about?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 spew,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 said Hermione impatiently. \lquote It\rquote s S 
\endash  P \endash  E \endash  W. Stands for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare.\rquote 
\par \lquote Never heard of it,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Well, of course you haven\rquote t,\rquote  said Hermione briskly, \lquote I\rquote ve only just started it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah?\rquote  said Ron in mild surprise. \lquote How many members have you got?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well \endash  if you two join \endash  three,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote And you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying \'93spew\'94, do you?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote S \endash  P \endash  E \endash  W!\rquote  said Hermione hotly. \lquote I was going to put Stop the Outrageous Abuse of Our Fellow Magical Creatures and Campaign for a Change in Their Legal Status \endash  but it wouldn\rquote t fit. So that
\rquote s the heading of our manifesto.\rquote 
\par She brandished the sheaf of parchment at them. \lquote I\rquote ve been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf enslavement goes back centuries. I can\rquote t believe no one\rquote s done anything about it before now.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hermione \endash  open your ears,\rquote  said Ron loudly. \lquote They. Like. It. They }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 like }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 being enslaved!\rquote 
\par \lquote Our short-term aims,\rquote  said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn\rquote t heard a word, \lquote are to secure house-elves fair wages and working condi\-tions. Our long-term aims include changing the l
aw about non-wand-use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because they\rquote re shockingly under-represented.\rquote 
\par \lquote And how do we do all this?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote We start by recruiting members,\rquote  said Hermione happily. \lquote I thought two Sickles to join \endash  that buys a badge \endash  and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign. You\rquote re treasurer, Ron \endash  I\rquote 
ve got you a collecting tin upstairs \endash  and Harry, you\rquote re secre\-tary, so you might want to write down everything I\rquote m saying now, as a record of our first meeting.\rquote 
\par There was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the pair of them, and Harry sat, torn between exasperation at Hermione, and amusement at the look on Ron\rquote s face. The silence was bro\-ken, not by Ron, who in any case
 looked as though he was temporarily dumbstruck, but by a soft }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 tap, tap }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
on the window. Harry looked across the now empty common room, and saw, illuminated by the moonlight, a snowy owl perched on the windowsill.
\par \lquote Hedwig!\rquote  he shouted, and he launched himself out of his chair and across the room to pull open the window.
\par Hedwig flew inside, soared across the room and landed on the table on top of Harry\rquote s predictions.
\par \lquote About time!\rquote  said Harry, hurrying after her.
\par \lquote She\rquote s got an answer!\rquote  said Ron excitedly, pointing at the grubby piece of parchment tied to Hedwig\rquote s leg.
\par Harry hastily untied it and sat down to read it, whereupon Hedwig fluttered onto his knee, hooting softly.
\par \lquote What does it say?\rquote  Hermione asked breathlessly.
\par The letter was very short, and looked as though it had been scrawled in a great hurry. Harry read it aloud:

m in trouble! And there\rquote s nothing wrong with me! And I haven\rquote t got anything for you,\rquote  Harry snapped at Hedwig, who was clicking her beak expectantly, \lquote you\rquote ll have to go up to the Owlery if you want food.\rquote 
\par Hedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took off for the open window, cuffing him around the head with her outstretched wing as she went.
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  Hermione began, in a pacifying sort of voice.
\par \lquote I\rquote m going to bed,\rquote  said Harry shortly. \lquote See you in the morning.\rquote 
\par Upstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pyjamas and got into his four-poster, but he didn\rquote t feel remotely tired.
\par If Sirius came back and got caught, it would be his, Harry\rquote s, fault. Why hadn\rquote t he kept his mouth shut? A few seconds\rquote  pain and he\rquote d had to blab ... if he\rquote d just had the sense to keep it to himself ...
\par He heard Ron come up into the dormitory a short while later, but did not speak to him. For a long time, Harry lay star\-ing up at the dark canopy of his bed. The dormitory was com\-pletely silent, and, had he bee
n less preoccupied, Harry would have realised that the absence of Neville\rquote s usual snores meant that he was not the only one lying awake.

He then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through the silent castle (held up only briefly by Peeves, who tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along the fourth-floor corridor), finally a
rriving at the Owlery, which was situated at the top of West Tower.

The Owlery was a circular stone room; rather cold and draughty, because none of the windows had glass in them. The floor was entirely covered in straw, owl droppings and the regurgitated s
keletons of mice and voles. Hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right up to the top of the tower, nearly all of them asleep, though here and there a round amber eye glared at Harry. He spotted He
dwig nestled between a barn owl and a tawny, and hurried over to her, sliding a little on the dropping-strewn floor.
\par It took him a little while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him as she kept shuffling around on her perch, showing him her tai
l. She was evidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night. In the end, it was Harry suggesting she might be too tired, and that perhaps he would ask Ron to borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the
 letter to it.
\par \lquote Just find him, all right?\rquote  Harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall. \lquote Before the Dementors do.\rquote 
\par She nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have done, but hooted so
ftly in a reassuring sort of way all the same. Then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise. Harry watched her out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach. He had been so sure that Sirius\rquote 
 reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them.

\par \lquote Drop it,\rquote  said Ron sharply to Hermione, as she opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once, Hermione heeded him, and fell silent.
\par Harry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks. True, he could not stop himself 
looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went to sleep, prevent himself seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by Dementors down some dark London street, but between times he tried to keep his mi
n
d off his godfather. He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session. On the other hand, their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever before, particularly D
efence Against the Dark Arts.
\par To their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he would be putting the Imperius curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effects.
\par \lquote But \endash  but you said it\rquote s illegal, Professor,\rquote  said Hermione uncertainly, as Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room. \lquote You said \endash 
 to use it against another human was \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,\rquote  said Moody, his magical eye swivelling onto Hermione and fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare. \lquote If you\rquote d rather learn the hard way \endash  when someone\rquote 
s putting it on you so they can con\-trol you completely \endash  fine by me. You\rquote re excused. Off you go.\rquote 
\par He point
ed one gnarled finger towards the door. Hermione went very pink, and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave. Harry and Ron grinned at each other. They knew Hermione would rather eat Bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson.

\par M
oody began to beckon students forwards in turn and put the Imperius curse upon them. Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence. Dean Thomas hopped three times around the room, singing the national a
nthem. Lavender Brown imitated a squir\-
rel. Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them seemed to be able to fight the curse off, and each of them recovered only when Moody had removed it.
\par \lquote Potter,\rquote  Moody growled, \lquote you next.\rquote 
\par Harry moved forward into the middle of the classroom, into the space that Moody had cleared of desks. Moody raised his wand, pointed it at Harry, and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote 
Imperio.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par It was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating sen\-sation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gen\-
tly away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness. He stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone watching him.
\par And then he heard Mad-Eye Moody\rquote s voice, echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Jump onto the desk ... jump onto the desk ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par Harry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Jump onto the desk ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par Why, though?
\par Another voice had awoken in the back of his brain. Stupid thing to do, really, said the voice.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Jump onto the desk ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par No, I don\rquote t think I will, thanks, said the other voice, a little more firmly ... no, I don\rquote t really want to ...
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Jump! NOW!}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par The next thing Harry felt was considerable pain. He had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping \endash  the result was that he\rquote 
d smashed headlong into the desk, knocking it over, and, by the feeling in his legs, fractured both his kneecaps.
\par \lquote Now, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 that\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 more like it!\rquote  growled Moody\rquote 
s voice, and suddenly Harry felt the empty, echoing feeling in his head dis\-appear. He remembered exactly what was happening, and the pain in his knees seemed to double.
\par \lquote Look at that, you lot ... Potter fought! He fought it, and he damn near beat it! We\rquote ll try that again, Potter, and the rest of you, pay attention \endash  watch his eyes, that\rquote s where you see it \endash

\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par \lquote The way he talks,\rquote  Harry muttered, as he hobbled out of the Defence Against the Dark Arts class an hour later (Moody had insisted on putting Harry through his paces four times in a row, until Harry could throw the curse off entirely), 
\lquote you\rquote d think we were all going to be attacked any second.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I know,\rquote  said Ron, who was skipping on every alter\-nate step. He had had much more difficulty with the curse than Harry, though Moody assured him the effects would have worn off by lunchtime. \lquote Talk about paranoid ...\rquote 
 Ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that Moody was definite\-ly out of earshot, and went on, \lquote No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry, did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted \'93boo
\'94 behind him on April Fools\rquote  Day? And when are we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius curse with everything else we\rquote ve got to do?\rquote 
\par All the fourth-years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall explained why, when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration homework she had set.
\par \lquote You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!\rquote  she told them, her eyes glinting danger\-ously behind her square spectacles. \lquote Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We don\rquote t take O.W.Ls \rquote til fifth year!\rquote  said Dean Thomas indignantly.
\par \lquote Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the prepa\-ration you can get! Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfac\-tory pincushion. I might remind you that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 your }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 pincushion, Thomas, still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin!\rquote 
\par Hermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to look too pleased with herself.
\par Harry and Ro
n were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney told them that they had received top marks for their homework in their next Divination class. She read out large portions of their predictions, commending them for their unflinching acceptance of the horrors i
n store for them \endash  but they were less amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next; both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes.
\par Meanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught History of Magic, had them writing weekly essays on the Goblin Rebellions of the eighteenth century. Professor Snape was forc\-
ing them to research antidotes. They took this seriously, as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before Christmas to see if their antidote worked. Profes
sor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms.
\par Even Hagrid was adding to their workload. The Blast-Ended Skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace, given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate. Hagrid was delighted and, as part of their \lquote project\rquote 
, suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the Skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behaviour.
\par \lquote I will not,\rquote  said Draco Malfoy flatly, when Hagrid had pro\-posed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra large toy out of his sack. \lquote I see enough of these foul things dur\-ing lessons, thanks.\rquote 
\par Hagrid\rquote s smile faded from his face.
\par \lquote Yeh\rquote ll do wha\rquote  yer told,\rquote  he growled, \lquote or I\rquote ll be takin\rquote  a leaf outta Professor Moody\rquote s book ... I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.\rquote 
\par The Gryffindors roared with laughter. Malfoy flushed with anger, but apparently the memory of Moody\rquote s punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him retorting. Harry, Ron and Hermione r
eturned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits; seeing Hagrid put down Malfoy was particularly satisfying, especially because Malfoy had done his very best to get Hagrid sacked the previous year.
\par When they arrived in the Entrance Hall, they found them\-
selves unable to proceed owing to the large crowd of students congregated there, all milling around a large sign which had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase. Ron, the tallest of the three, stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in
 front of them and read the sign aloud to the other two.

\par Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like \lquote Lockhart!\rquote .
\par The appearance of the sign in the Entrance Hall had a marked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle. During the following week, there seemed to be only one topic of conversa\-tion, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard Tournament. 
Rumours were flying from student to student like highly con\-tagious germs: who was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what the Tournament would involve, how the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang differed from themselves.
\par Harry noticed, too, that th
e castle seemed to be undergoing an extra-thorough cleaning. Several grimy portraits had been scrubbed, much to the displeasure of their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly and wincing as they felt their raw pink faces. The suits of
 armour were suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking, and Argus Filch, the caretaker, was behaving so ferociously to any student who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair of first-year girls into hysterics.
\par Other members of staff seemed oddly tense, too.

\par When they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of October, they found that the Great Hall had been decorated overnight. Enormous silk banners hung from the walls, each of them representing a Hogwarts house \endash 
 red with a gold lion for Gryffindor, blue with a bronze eagle for Ravenclaw, yellow with a black badger for Hufflepuff, and green with a silver serpent for Slytherin. Behind the teachers\rquote  table, the largest banner of all bore the Hogwarts 
coat of arms: lion, eagle, badger and snake united around a large letter \lquote H\rquote .
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione spotted Fred and George at the Gryffindor table. Once again, and most unusually, they were sitting apart from everyone else and conversing in low voices. Ron led the way over to them.
\par \lquote It\rquote s a bummer all right,\rquote  George was saying gloomily to Fred. \lquote But if he won\rquote t talk to us in person, we\rquote ll have to send him the letter after all. Or we\rquote ll stuff it into his hand, he can\rquote

\par \lquote Who\rquote s avoiding you?\rquote  said Ron, sitting down next to them.
\par \lquote Wish you would,\rquote  said Fred, looking irritated at the inter\-ruption.
\par \lquote What\rquote s a bummer?\rquote  Ron asked George.
\par \lquote Having a nosy git like you for a brother,\rquote  said George.
\par \lquote You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet?\rquote  Harry asked. \lquote Thought any more about trying to enter?\rquote 
\par \lquote I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she wasn\rquote t telling,\rquote  said George bitterly. \lquote She just told me to shut up and get on with Transfiguring my raccoon.\rquote 
\par \lquote Wonder what the tasks are going to be?\rquote  said Ron thought\-fully. \lquote You know, I bet we could do them, Harry, we\rquote ve done dangerous stuff before ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven\rquote t,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote McGonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well they\rquote ve done the tasks.\rquote 
\par \lquote Who are the judges?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel,\rquote  said Hermione, and everyone looked around at her, rather surprised, \lquote because all three of them were injured during t

\par Harry shook his head, and applied himself to his scrambled eggs. His and Ron\rquote s lack of enthusiasm had done nothing what\-soever to curb Hermione\rquote 
s determination to pursue justice for house-elves. True, both of them had paid two Sickles for a S.P.E.W
 badge, but they had only done it to keep her quiet. Their Sickles had been wasted, however; if anything, they seemed to have made Hermione more vociferous. She had been badgering Harry and Ron ever since, firstly to wear the badges, then to persuade othe
rs to do the same, and she had also taken to rattling around the Gryffindor common room every evening, cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses.
\par \lquote You do realise that your sheets are changed, your fires lit, your classrooms cleaned and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved?\rquote  she kept saying fiercely.
\par Some people, like Neville, had paid up just to stop Hermione glowering at them. A few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say, but were reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning. Many regarded the whole thing as a joke.
\par Ron now rolled his eyes at the ceiling, which was flooding them all in autumn sunlight, and Fred became extremely inter\-ested in his bacon (both twins had refused to buy a S.P.E.W. badge). George, however, leant towards Hermione.
\par \lquote Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens, Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, of course not,\rquote  said Hermione curtly, \lquote I hardly think students are supposed to \endash \rquote

\par \lquote That\rquote s because they\rquote re uneducated and brainwashed!\rquote  Hermione began hotly, but her next few words were drowned by the sudden whoosh
ing noise from overhead which announced the arrival of the post owls. Harry looked up at once, and saw Hedwig soaring towards him. Hermione stopped talking abruptly; she and Ron watched Hedwig anxiously, as she fluttered down onto Harry\rquote 
s shoulder, folded her wings and held out her leg wearily.
\par Harry pulled off Sirius\rquote  reply and offered Hedwig his bacon rinds, which she ate gratefully. Then, checking that Fred and George were safely immersed in further discussions about the Triwizard Tournament, Harry read out Sirius\rquote 
 letter in a whisper to Ron and Hermione.

She stands out. A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he\rquote s hiding ... I mean, they\rquote re not native birds, are they?\rquote 
\par Harry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes, wondering whether he felt more or less worried than before. He supposed that Sirius managing to get back without being caught was something. He couldn\rquote 
t deny, either, that the idea that Sirius was much nearer was reassuring; at least he wouldn\rquote t have to wait so long for a response every time he wrote.
\par \lquote Thanks, Hedwig,\rquote  he said, stroking her. She hooted sleepily, dipped her beak briefly into his goblet of orange juice, then took off again, clearly desperate for a good long sleep in the Owlery.
\par There was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day. Nobody was very attentive in lessons, being much mo
re interested in the arrival that evening of the people from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang; even Potions was more bearable than usual, as it was half an hour shorter. When the bell rang early, Harry, Ron and Hermione hurried up to Gryffindor Tower, deposited
 their bags and books as they had been instructed, pulled on their cloaks and rushed back downstairs into the Entrance Hall.
\par The Heads of houses were ordering their students into lines.
\par \lquote Weasley, straighten your hat,\rquote  Professor McGonagall snapped at Ron. \lquote Miss Patil, take that ridiculous thing out of your hair.\rquote 
\par Parvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from the end of her plait.
\par \lquote Follow me, please,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, \lquote first-years in front ... no pushing ...\rquote 
\par They filed down the front
 steps and lined up in front of the castle. It was a cold, clear evening; dusk was falling and a pale, transparent-looking moon was already shining over the Forbidden Forest. Harry, standing between Ron and Hermione in the fourth row from the front, saw D
ennis Creevey positively shivering with anticipation among the other first-years.
\par \lquote Nearly six,\rquote  said Ron, checking his watch and then staring down the drive which led to the front gates. \lquote How d\rquote you reckon they\rquote re coming? The train?\rquote 
\par \lquote I doubt it,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote How, then? Broomsticks?\rquote  Harry suggested, looking up at the starry sky.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think so ... not from that far away ...\rquote 
\par \lquote A Portkey?\rquote  Ron suggested. \lquote Or they could Apparate \endash  maybe you\rquote re allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from?\rquote 
\par \lquote You can\rquote t Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds, how often do I have to tell you?\rquote  said Hermione impatiently.
\par They scanned the darkening grounds excitedly, but nothing was moving; everything was still, silent and quite as usual. Harry was starting to feel cold. He wished they\rquote 
d hurry up ... maybe the foreign students were preparing a dramatic entrance ... he remembered what Mr Weasley had said back on the campsite before the Quidditch World Cup \endash  \lquote Always the same, we can\rquote 
t resist showing off when we get together ...\rquote 
\par And then Dumbledore called out from the back row, where he stood with the other teachers \endash  \lquote Aha! Unless I am very much mistaken, the delegation from Beauxbatons approaches!\rquote 
\par \lquote Where?\rquote  said many students eagerly, all looking in different directions.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote There!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 yelled a sixth-year, pointing over the Forest.
\par Something large, much larger than a broomstick \endash  or, indeed, a hundred broomsticks \endash  was hurtling across the deep blue sky towards the castle, growing larger all the time.
\par \lquote It\rquote s a dragon!\rquote  shrieked one of the first-years, losing her head completely.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be stupid ... it\rquote s a flying house!\rquote  said Dennis Creevey.
\par Dennis\rquote s guess was closer ... as the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the Forbidden Forest, and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it, they saw a gigan\-
tic, powder-blue, horse-drawn carriage, the size of a large house, soaring towards them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all palominos, and each the size of an elephant.
\par The front three rows of students drew backwards as the car\-riage hurtled ever lower, coming in to land at a tremendous speed \endash  then, with an almighty crash that made Neville jump backwards onto a Slytherin fifth-year\rquote s foot \endash 
 the horses\rquote  hooves, larger than dinner plates, hit the ground. A second later, the carriage landed too, bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the golden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled large, fiery red eyes.
\par Harry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms (two crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars) before it opened.
\par A boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage, bent forwards, fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor and unfolded a set of golden steps. He sprang back respectfully. Then H
arry saw a shining, high-heeled black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage \endash  a shoe the size of a child\rquote s sled \endash 
 followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life. The size of the carriage, and of the horses, was immediately explained. A few people gasped.
\par Harry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life, and that was Hagrid; he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights. Yet somehow \endash  maybe simply because he was used to Hagrid \endash 
 this woman (now at the foot of the steps, and looking around at the wait\-ing, wide-eyed crowd) seemed even more unnaturally large. As she stepped into the light flooding from the Entrance Hall, she was revealed to have a handsome, olive-skinned face, la
rge, black, liquid-looking eyes and a rather beaky nose. Her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck. She was dressed from head to foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers.
\par Dumbledore started to clap; the students, following his lead, broke into applause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman.
\par Her face relaxed into a gracious smile, and she walked forwards towards Dumbledore, extending a glittering hand. Dumbledore, though tall himself, had barely to bend to kiss it.
\par \lquote My dear Madame Maxime,\rquote  he said. \lquote Welcome to Hogwarts.\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbly-dorr,\rquote  said Madame Maxime, in a deep voice. \lquote I \rquote ope I find you well?\rquote 
\par \lquote On excellent form, I thank you,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote My pupils,\rquote  said Madame Maxime, waving one of her enormous hands carelessly behind her.
\par Harry, whose attention had been focused completely upon Madame Maxime, now noticed that around a dozen boys and girls \endash  all, by the look of them, in their late teens \endash  ha
d emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind Madame Maxime. They were shivering, which was unsurpris\-
ing, given that their robes seemed to be made of fine silk, and none of them were wearing cloaks. A few of them had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads. From what Harry could see of their faces (they were standing in Madame Maxime\rquote 
s enormous shadow), they were staring up at Hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces.
\par \lquote  \rquote As Karkaroff arrived yet?\rquote  Madame Maxime asked.
\par \lquote He should be here any moment,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle?\rquote 
\par \lquote Warm up, I think,\rquote  said Madame Maxime. \lquote But ze \rquote orses \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation which has arisen with some of his other \endash  er \endash  charges.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Skrewts,\rquote  Ron muttered to Harry, grinning.
\par \lquote My steeds require \endash  er \endash  forceful \rquote andling,\rquote  said Madame Maxime, looking as though she doubted whether any Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts could be up to the job. \lquote Zey are very strong ...\rquote 

\par \lquote I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling.
\par \lquote Very well,\rquote  said Madame Maxime, bowing slightly, \lquote will you please inform zis \rquote Agrid zat ze \rquote orses drink only single-malt whisky?\rquote 
\par \lquote It will be attended to,\rquote  said Dumbledore, also bowing.
\par \lquote Come,\rquote  said Madame Maxime imperiously to her students, and the Hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps.
\par \lquote How big d\rquote you reckon Durmstrang\rquote s horses are going to be?\rquote  Seamus Finnigan said, leaning around Lavender and Parvati to address Harry and Ron.
\par \lquote Well, if they\rquote re any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid won\rquote t be able to handle them,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote That\rquote s if he hasn\rquote t been attacked by his Skrewts. Wonder what\rquote s up with them?\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe they\rquote ve escaped,\rquote  said Ron hopefully.
\par \lquote Oh, don\rquote t say that,\rquote  said Hermione, with a shudder. \lquote Imagine that lot loose in the grounds ...\rquote 
\par They stood, shivering slightly now, waiting for the Durmstrang party to arrive. Most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky. For a few minutes, the silence was broken only by Madame Maxime\rquote s huge horses snorting and stamping. But then \endash 

\par \lquote Can you hear something?\rquote  said Ron suddenly.
\par Harry listened; a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting towards them from out of the darkness; a muffled rumbling and sucking sound, as though an immense vacuum cleaner was moving along a river-bed ...
\par \lquote The lake!\rquote  yelled Lee Jordan, pointing down at it. \lquote Look at the lake!\rquote 
\par From their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds, they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water \endash  except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all. Some distur
bance was taking place deep in the centre; great bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now washing over the muddy banks \endash 
 and then, out in the very middle of the lake, a whirlpool appeared, as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake\rquote s floor ...
\par What seemed to be a long, black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the whirlpool ... and then Harry saw the rigging ...
\par \lquote It\rquote s a mast!\rquote  he said to Ron and Hermione.
\par Slowly, magnificently, the ship rose out of the water, gleam\-ing in t
he moonlight. It had a strangely skeletal look about it, as though it was a resurrected wreck, and the dim, misty lights shimmering at its portholes looked like ghostly eyes. Finally, with a great sloshing noise, the ship emerged entirely, bobbing on the 
turbulent water, and began to glide towards the bank. A few moments later, they heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down in the shallows, and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank.
\par People were disembarking; they could see their silhouettes passing the lights in the ship\rquote 
s portholes. All of them, Harry noticed, seemed to be built along the lines of Crabbe and Goyle ... but then, as they drew nearer, walking up the lawns into the light streaming from the Entrance Hall, he saw that their bulk w
as really due to the fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy, matted fur. But the man who was leading them up to the castle was wearing furs of a differ\-ent sort; sleek and silver, like his hair.
\par \lquote Dumbledore!\rquote  he called heartily, as he walked up the slope. \lquote How are you, my dear fellow, how are you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Blooming, thank you, Professor Karkaroff,\rquote  Dumbledore replied.
\par Karkaroff had a fruity, unctuous voice; when he stepped into the light pouring from the front doors of the castle, they saw that 
he was tall and thin like Dumbledore, but his white hair was short, and his goatee (finishing in a small curl) did not entirely hide his rather weak chin. When he reached Dumbledore, he shook hands with both of his own.
\par \lquote Dear old Hogwarts,\rquote  he said, looking up at the castle and smiling; his teeth were rather yellow, and Harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes, which remained cold and shrewd. \lquote 
How good it is to be here, how good ... Viktor, come along, into the warmth ... you don\rquote t mind, Dumbledore? Viktor has a slight head cold ...\rquote 
\par Karkaroff beckoned forwards one of his students. As the boy passed, Harry caught a glimpse of a prominent, curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He didn\rquote t need the punch on the arm Ron gave him, or the hiss in his ear, to recognise that profile.

\par As they recrossed the Entrance Hall with the rest of the Hogwarts students, heading for the Great Hall, Harry saw Lee Jordan jumping up and down on the soles of his feet to get a better look at the back of Krum\rquote

you haven\rquote t got a quill, have you, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nope, they\rquote re upstairs in my bag,\rquote  said Harry.
\par They walked over to the Gryffindor table and sa
t down. Ron took care to sit on the side facing the doorway, because Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students were still gathered around it, apparently unsure about where they should sit. The students from Beauxbatons had chosen seats at the Ravenclaw tabl
e. They were looking around the Great Hall with glum expressions on their faces. Three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads.
\par \lquote It\rquote s not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 cold,\rquote  said Hermione irritably, who was watch

\par \lquote Over here! Come and sit over here!\rquote  Ron hissed. \lquote Over here! Hermione, budge up, make a space \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote 
\par \lquote Too late,\rquote  said Ron bitterly.
\par Viktor Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students had settled themselves at the Slytherin table. Harry could see Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle looking very smug about this. As he watched, Malfoy bent forwards to speak to Krum.
\par \lquote Yeah, that\rquote s right, smarm up to him, Malfoy,\rquote  said Ron scathingly. \lquote I bet Krum can see right through him, though ... bet he gets people fawning over him all the time ... where d\rquote you reckon they\rquote 
re going to sleep? We could offer him a space in our dormitory, Harry ... I wouldn\rquote t mind giving him my bed, I could kip on a camp-bed.\rquote 
\par Hermione snorted.
\par \lquote They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot,\rquote  said Harry.
\par The Durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest; a couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them, apparently impressed.
\par Up at the staff table, Filch, the caretaker, was adding chairs. He was wearing his mouldy old tail coat in honour of the occasion. Harry was surprised to see that he added four chairs, two on either side of Dumbledore\rquote s.
\par \lquote But there are only two extra people,\rquote  Harry said. \lquote Why\rquote s Filch putting out four chairs? Who else is coming?\rquote 
\par \lquote Eh?\rquote  said Ron vaguely. He was still staring avidly at Krum.
\par When all the students had entered the Hall and settled down at their house tables, the staff entered, filing up to the top table and taking their seats. Last in line were Professor Dumbledore,
\par Professor Karkaroff and Madame Maxime. When their Headmistress appeared, the pupils from Beauxbatons leapt to their feet. A few of the Hogwarts students laughed. The Beauxbatons party appeared quite un
embarrassed, and did not resume their seats until Madame Maxime had sat down on Dumbledore\rquote s left-hand side. Dumbledore, however, remained standing, and a silence fell over the Great Hall.
\par \lquote Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and \endash  most particularly \endash  guests,\rquote  said Dumbledore, beaming around at the foreign students. \lquote 
I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts. I hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable.\rquote 
\par One of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakeably a derisive laugh.
\par \lquote No one\rquote s making you stay!\rquote  Hermione whispered, bristling at her.
\par \lquote The Tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I now invite you all to eat, drink, and make yourselves at home!\rquote 
\par He sat down, and Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in conversation.
\par The dishes in front of them filled with food as usual. The house-elves in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops; there was a greater variety of dishes in front of them than Harry had ever seen, including several that were definitely foreign.

\par \lquote What\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 that?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
 said Ron, pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large steak-and-kidney pudding.
\par \lquote Bouillabaisse,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Bless you,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote It\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 French,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 said Hermione. \lquote 
I had it on holiday, summer before last, it\rquote s very nice.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll take your word for it,\rquote  said Ron, helping himself to black pudding.
\par The Great Hall seemed somehow much more crowded than usual, even though there were barely twenty additional stu\-dents there; perhaps it was because their differe
ntly coloured uniforms stood out so clearly against the black of the Hogwarts robes. Now that they had removed their furs, the Durmstrang students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep, blood red.
\par Hagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the staff table twenty minutes after the start of the feast. He slid into his seat at the end and waved at Harry, Ron and Hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand.
\par \lquote Skrewts doing all right, Hagrid?\rquote  Harry called.
\par \lquote Thrivin\rquote ,\rquote  Hagrid called back happily.
\par \lquote Yeah, I\rquote ll just bet they are,\rquote  said Ron quietly. \lquote Looks like they\rquote ve finally found a food they like, doesn\rquote t it? Hagrid\rquote s fingers.\rquote 
\par At that moment, a voice said, \lquote Excuse me, are you wanting ze bouillabaisse?\rquote 
\par It was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore\rquote s speech. She had finally removed her muffler. A long sheet of silvery blonde hair fell almost to her waist. She had large, deep blue eyes, and very white, even teeth.
\par Ron went purple. He stared up at her, opened his mouth to reply, but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise.
\par \lquote Yeah, have it,\rquote  said Harry, pushing the dish towards the girl.
\par \lquote You \rquote ave finished wiz it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  Ron said breathlessly. \lquote Yeah, it was excellent.\rquote 
\par The girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the Ravenclaw table. Ron was still goggling at the girl as though he had never seen one before. Harry started to laugh. The sound seemed to jog Ron back to his senses.
\par \lquote She\rquote s a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Veela!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 he said hoarsely to Harry.
\par \lquote Of course she isn\rquote t!\rquote  said Hermione tartly. \lquote I don\rquote t see anyone else gaping at her like an idiot!\rquote 
\par But she wasn\rquote t entirely right about that. As the girl crossed the Hall, many boys\rquote  heads turned, and some of them seemed to have become temporarily speechless, just like Ron.
\par \lquote I\rquote m telling you, that\rquote s not a normal girl!\rquote  said Ron, leaning sideways so he could keep a clear view of her. \lquote They don\rquote t make them like that at Hogwarts!\rquote 
\par \lquote They make them OK at Hogwarts,\rquote  said Harry, without thinking. Cho Chang happened to be sitting only a few places away from the girl with the silvery hair.
\par \lquote When you\rquote ve both put your eyes back in,\rquote  said Hermione briskly, \lquote you\rquote ll be able to see who\rquote s just arrived.\rquote 
\par She was pointing up at the staff table. The two remaining empty seats had just been filled. Ludo Bagman was now sitting on Professor Karkaroff\rquote s other side, while Mr Crouch, Percy\rquote s boss, was next to Madame Maxime.
\par \lquote What are they doing here?\rquote  said Harry in surprise.
\par \lquote They organised the Triwizard Tournament, didn\rquote t they?\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote I suppose they wanted to be here to see it start.\rquote 
\par When the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar puddings, too. Ron examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely, then moved it carefully a few inches to his right, so that it would be clearly visible from the Ravencla
w table. The girl who looked like a Veela appeared to have eaten enough, however, and did not come over to get it.
\par Once th
e golden plates had been wiped clean, Dumbledore stood up again. A pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the Hall now. Harry felt a slight thrill of excitement, wondering what was coming. Several seats along from them, Fred and George were leaning forwa
rds, staring at Dumbledore with great concentration.
\par \lquote The moment has come,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling around at the sea of upturned faces. \lquote The Triwizard Tournament is about to start. I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote The what?\rquote  Harry muttered.
\par Ron shrugged.
\par \lquote \endash  just to clarify the procedure which we will be following this year. But firstly, let me introduce, for those who do not know them, Mr Bartemius Crouch, Head of the Department of International Magical Co-operation\rquote  \endash 
 there was a smattering of polite applause \endash  \lquote and Mr Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports.\rquote 
\par There was a much louder round of applause for Bagman than for Crouch, perhaps because of his fame as a Beater, or simply because he looked so much more likeable. He acknowl\-
edged it with a jovial wave of his hand. Bartemius Crouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced. Remembering him in his neat suit at the Quidditch World Cup, Harry thought he looked strange in wizard\rquote 
s robes. His toothbrush moustache and severe parting looked very odd next to Dumbledore\rquote s long white hair and beard.
\par \lquote Mr Bagman and Mr Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament,\rquote  Dumbledore continued, \lquote 
and they will be joining myself, Professor Karkaroff and Madame Maxime on the panel which will judge the champions\rquote  efforts.\rquote 
\par At the mention of the word \lquote champions\rquote , the attentiveness of the listening students seemed to sharpen.
\par Perhaps Dumbledore had noticed their sudden stillness, for he smiled as he said, \lquote The casket, then, if you please, Mr Filch.\rquote 
\par Filch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the Hall, now approached Dumbledore, carrying a great wooden chest, encrusted with jewels. It looked extremely old. A mur\-
mur of excited interest rose from the watching students; Dennis Creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly, but, being so tiny, his head hardly rose above anyone else\rquote s.
\par \lquote The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by Mr Crouch and Mr Bagman,\rquote  said Dumbledore, as Filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him, \lquote 
and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge. There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways ... their magical prowess \endash their daring \endash 
 their powers of deduction \endash  and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.\rquote 
\par At this last word, the Hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing.
\par \lquote As you know, three champions compete in the Tournament,\rquote  Dumbledore went on calmly, \lquote one from each of the participating schools. They will be marked on how well they perform each of the Tournament tas
ks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup. The champions will be chosen by an impartial selector ... the Goblet of Fire.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore now took out his wand, and tapped three times upon the top of the casket. The 
lid creaked slowly open. Dumbledore reached inside it, and pulled out a large, roughly hewn wooden cup. It would have been entirely unremarkable, had it not been full to the brim with dancing, blue-white flames.
\par Dumbledore closed the casket and placed the Goblet care\-fully on top of it, where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the Hall.
\par \lquote Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment, and drop it into the Goblet,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Aspiring champi\-
ons have twenty-four hours in which to put their names forward. Tomorrow night, Hallowe\rquote en, the Goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools. The Goblet will be placed in the Entrance Hall t
onight, where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to compete.
\par \lquote To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in the Entrance Hall. N
obody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line.
\par \lquote Finally, I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this Tournament is not to be entered into lightly. Once a champion has been selected by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is o
bliged to see the Tournament through to the end. The placing of your name in the Goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract. There can be no change of heart once you have become champion. Please be very sure, therefore, that you are whole-heartedly pr
epared to play, before you drop your name into the Goblet. Now, I think it is time for bed. Goodnight to you all.\rquote 
\par \lquote An Age Line!\rquote  Fred Weasley said, his eyes glinting, as they all made their way across the Hall to the doors into the Entrance Hall. \lquote Well, that should be fooled by an Ageing Potion, shouldn\rquote t it? And once your name\rquote 
s in that Goblet, you\rquote re laughing \endash  it can\rquote t tell whether you\rquote re seventeen or not!\rquote 
\par \lquote But I don\rquote t think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote we just haven\rquote t learnt enough ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Speak for yourself,\rquote  said George shortly. \lquote You\rquote ll try and get in, won\rquote t you, Harry?\rquote 
\par Harry thought briefly of Dumbledore\rquote s insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name, but then the wonderful picture of himself winning 
the Triwizard Cup filled his mind again ... he wondered how angry Dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 did }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 find a way to get over the Age Line ...
\par \lquote Where is he?\rquote  said Ron, who wasn\rquote t listening to a word of this conversation, but looking through the crowd to see what had become of Krum. \lquote Dumbledore didn\rquote t say where the Durmstrang people are sleeping, did he?\rquote 

\par But this query was answered almost instantly; they were level with the Slytherin table now, and Karkaroff had just bus\-tled up to his students.
\par \lquote Back to the ship, then,\rquote  he was saying. \lquote Viktor, how are you feeling? Did you eat enough? Should I send for some mulled wine from the kitchens?\rquote 
\par Harry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on.
\par \lquote Professor, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 I}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  vood like some vine,\rquote  sai

 snapped Karkaroff, his warmly paternal air vanishing in an instant. \lquote I notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again, disgust\-ing boy \endash \rquote 
\par Karkaroff turned and led his students towards the doors, reaching them at exactly the same moment as Harry, Ron and Hermione. Harry stopped to let him walk through first.
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote  said Karkaroff carelessly, glancing at him.
\par And then Karkaroff froze. He turned his head back to Harry, and stared at him as though he couldn\rquote t believe his eyes. Behind their Headmaster, the students from Durmstrang came to a halt, too. Karkaroff\rquote s eyes moved slowly up Harry\rquote 
s face, and fixed upon his scar. The Durmstrang students were staring curiously at Harry, too. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces. The boy with food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and point\-
ed openly at Harry\rquote s forehead.
\par \lquote Yeah, that\rquote s Harry Potter,\rquote  said a growling voice from behind them.
\par Professor Karkaroff spun around. Mad-Eye Moody was standing there, leaning heavily on his staff, his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the Durmstrang Headmaster.
\par The colour drained from Karkaroff\rquote s face as Harry watched. A terrible look of mingled fury and fear came over his face.
\par \lquote You!\rquote  he said, staring at Moody as though unsure he was really seeing him.
\par \lquote Me,\rquote  said Moody grimly. \lquote And unless you\rquote ve got anything to say to Potter, Karkaroff, you might want to move. You\rquote re block\-ing the doorway.\rquote 
\par It was true; half the students in the Hall were now waiting behind them, looking over each other\rquote s shoulders to see what was causing the hold-up.
\par Without another word, Professor Karkaroff swept his students away with him. Moody watched him out of sight, his magical eye fixed upon his back, a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face.

As the next day was Saturday, most students would normally have breakfasted late. Harry, Ron and Hermione, however, were not alone in
 rising much earlier than they usually did at weekends. When they went down into the Entrance Hall, they saw about twenty people milling around it, some of them eat\-
ing toast, all examining the Goblet of Fire. It had been placed in the centre of the hall on the stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat. A thin golden line had been traced on the floor, forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction.

\par \lquote All the Durmstrang lot,\rquote  she replied. \lquote But I haven\rquote t seen any\-one from Hogwarts yet.\rquote 
\par \lquote Bet some of them put in last night after we\rquote d all gone to bed,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I would\rquote ve done if it had been me ... wouldn\rquote t have wanted everyone watching. What if the Goblet just gob\-bed you right back 
out again?\rquote 
\par Someone laughed behind Harry. Turning, he saw Fred, George and Lee Jordan hurrying down the staircase, all three of them looking extremely excited.
\par \lquote Done it,\rquote  Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry, Ron and Hermione. \lquote Just taken it.\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote The Ageing Potion, dungbrains,\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote One drop each,\rquote  said George, rubbing his hands together with glee. \lquote We only need to be a few months older.\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one of us wins,\rquote  said Lee, grinning broadly.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not sure this is going to work, you know,\rquote  said Hermione warningly. \lquote I\rquote m sure Dumbledore will have thought of this.\rquote 
\par Fred, George and Lee ignored her.
\par \lquote Ready?\rquote  Fred said to the other two, quivering with excite\-ment. \lquote C\rquote mon, then \endash  I\rquote ll go first \endash \rquote 
\par Harry watched, fascinated, as Fred pulled a slip of parch\-ment out of his pocket, bearing the words \lquote Fred Weasley \endash  Hogwarts\rquote 
. Fred walked right up to the edge of the line, and stood there, rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fifty-foot drop. Then, with the eyes of every person in the Entrance Hall upon him, he took a great breath and stepped over the line.
\par For a split second, Harry thought it had worked \endash  George certainly thought so, for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after Fred \endash 
 but next moment, there was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shot-putter. They lan
ded painfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor, and to add insult to injury, there was a loud popping noise, and both of them sprouted identical, long white beards.
\par The Entrance Hall rang with laughter. Even Fred and George joined in, once they had got to their feet, and taken a good look at each other\rquote s beards.
\par \lquote I did warn you,\rquote  said a deep, amused voice, and everyone turned to see Professor Dumbledore coming out of the Great Hall. He surveyed Fred and George, his eyes twinkling. \lquote I sug\-gest you both
 go up to Madam Pomfrey. She is already tending to Miss Fawcett, of Ravenclaw, and Mr Summers, of Hufflepuff, both of whom decided to age themselves up a little, too. Though I must say, neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours.\rquote 

\par Fred and George set off for the hospital wing, accompanied by Lee, who was howling with laughter, and Harry, Ron and Hermione, also chortling, went in to breakfast.
\par The decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning. As it was Hallowe\rquote en, a cloud of live bats was flutter\-
ing around the enchanted ceiling, while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner. Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering.
\par \lquote There\rquote s a rumour going round, Warrington got up early and put his name in,\rquote  Dean told Harry. \lquote That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth.\rquote 
\par Harry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head in disgust. \lquote We can\rquote t have a Slytherin champion!\rquote 
\par \lquote And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,\rquote  said Seamus contemptuously. \lquote But I wouldn\rquote t have thought he\rquote d have wanted to risk his good looks.\rquote 
\par \lquote Listen!\rquote  said Hermione suddenly.
\par People were cheering out in the Entrance Hall. They all swivelled around in 
their seats, and saw Angelina Johnson coming into the Hall, grinning in an embarrassed sort of way. A tall black girl who played Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Angelina came over to them, sat down and said, \lquote Well, I\rquote 
ve done it! Just put my name in!\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re kidding!\rquote  said Ron, looking impressed.
\par \lquote Are you seventeen, then?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote  \rquote Course she is. Can\rquote t see a beard, can you?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote I had my birthday last week,\rquote  said Angelina.
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote m glad someone from Gryffindor\rquote s entering,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote I really hope you get it, Angelina!\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks, Hermione,\rquote  said Angelina, smiling at her.
\par \lquote Yeah, better you than Pretty-Boy Diggory,\rquote  said Seamus, caus\-ing several Hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him.
\par \lquote What\rquote re we going to do today, then?\rquote  Ron asked Harry and Hermione, when they had finished breakfast and were leaving the Great Hall.
\par \lquote We haven\rquote t been down to visit Hagrid yet,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote just as long as he doesn\rquote t ask us to donate a few fingers to the Skrewts.\rquote 
\par A look of great excitement suddenly dawned on Hermione\rquote s face.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve just realised \endash  I haven\rquote t asked Hagrid to join S.P.E.W. yet!\rquote  she said brightly. \lquote Wait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s she like?\rquote  said Ron, exasperated, as Hermione ran away up the marble staircase.
\par \lquote Hey, Ron,\rquote  said Harry suddenly. \lquote It\rquote s your friend ...\rquote 
\par The students from Beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds, among them, the Veela girl. Those gathered around the Goblet of Fire stood back to let them pass, watching eagerly.
\par Madame Maxime entered the hall behind her students and organised them into a line. One by one, the Beauxbatons students stepped across the Age Line and dropped their slips of parchment into the blue-white flames.
 As each name entered the fire, it turned briefly red and emitted sparks.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you reckon\rquote ll happen to the ones that aren\rquote t chosen?\rquote  Ron muttered to Harry, as the Veela girl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire. \lquote Reckon they\rquote ll go back to schoo

\par \lquote Dunno,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Hang around, I suppose ... Madame Maxime\rquote s staying to judge, isn\rquote t she?\rquote 
\par When all the Beauxbatons students had submitted their names, Madame Maxime led them back out of the hall and into the grounds again.
\par \lquote Where are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 they }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 sleeping, then?\rquote 
 said Ron, moving towards the front doors and staring after them.
\par A loud rattling noise behind them announced Hermione\rquote s reappearance with the box of S.P.E.W. badges.
\par \lquote Oh, good, hurry up,\rquote  said Ron, and he jumped down the stone steps, keeping his eyes on the back of the Veela girl, who was now halfway across the lawn with Madame Maxime.
\par As they neared Hagrid\rquote s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, the mystery of the Beauxbatons\rquote  sleeping quarters was solved. The gigantic powder-blue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from Hagrid
\rquote s front door, and the students were climbing back inside it. The elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it.
\par Harry knocked on Hagrid\rquote s door, and Fang\rquote s booming barks answered instantly.
\par \lquote  \rquote Bout time!\rquote  said Hagrid, when he\rquote d flung open the door and seen who was knocking. \lquote Thought you lot\rquote d forgotten where I live!\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote ve been really busy, Hag\emdash \rquote  Hermione started to say, but then she stopped dead, looking up at Hagrid, apparently lost for words.
\par Hagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy brown suit, plus a checked yellow-and-orange tie. This wasn\rquote 
t the worst of it, though; he had evidently tried to tame his hair, using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease. It was now slicked down into two bunches \endash  perhaps he had tried a ponytail like Bill\rquote 
s, but found he had too much hair. The look didn\rquote t really suit Hagrid at all. For a moment, Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, she said, \lquote Erm \endash  where are the Skrewts?\rquote 
\par \lquote Out by the pumpkin patch,\rquote  said Hagrid happily. \lquote They\rquote re gettin\rquote  massive, mus\rquote  be nearly three foot long now. On\rquote y trouble is, they\rquote ve started killin\rquote  each other.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, no, really?\rquote  said Hermione, shooting a repressive look at Ron, who, staring at Hagrid\rquote s odd hairstyle, had just opened his mouth to say something about it.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Hagrid sadly. \lquote  \rquote S\rquote OK, though, I\rquote ve got \rquote em in sepa\-rate boxes now. Still got abou\rquote  twenty.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, that\rquote s lucky,\rquote  said Ron. Hagrid missed the sarcasm.
\par Hagrid\rquote s cabin comprised a single room, in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt. A si
milarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire, beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling. They sat down at the table while Hagrid started to make tea, and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of 
the Triwizard Tournament. Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were.
\par \lquote You wait,\rquote  he said, grinning. \lquote You jus\rquote  wait. Yer going ter see some stuff yeh\rquote ve never seen before. Firs\rquote  task ... ah, but I\rquote m not supposed ter say.\rquote 
\par \lquote Go on, Hagrid!\rquote  Harry, Ron and Hermione urged him, but he just shook his head, grinning.
\par \lquote I don\rquote  want ter spoil it fer yeh,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote But it\rquote s gonna be spectacular, I\rquote ll tell yeh that. Them champions\rquote re going ter have their work cut out. Never thought I\rquote d live ter see the Tr
iwizard Tournament played again!\rquote 
\par They ended up having lunch with Hagrid, though they didn\rquote t eat much \endash  Hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole, but after Hermione unearthed a large talon in hers, she, Harry and Ron rather lost their appetites. T
hey enjoyed themselves trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the Tournament were going to be, however, speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions, and wondering whether Fred and George were beardless yet.
\par A light rain had started to fall by mid-afternoon; it was very cosy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window, watching Hagrid darning his socks and arguing with Hermione about house-elves \endash 
 for he flatly refused to join S.P.E.W. when she showed him her badges.
\par \lquote It\rquote d be doin\rquote  \rquote em an unkindness, Hermione,\rquote  he said gravely, threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn. \lquote It\rquote s in their nature ter look after humans, that\rquote s what they like, see? Yeh
\rquote d be makin\rquote  \rquote em unhappy ter take away their work, an\rquote  insultin\rquote  \rquote em if yeh tried ter pay \rquote em.\rquote 
\par \lquote But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon about it!\rquote  said Hermione. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote And }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\rquote 
\par Hermione looked very cross indeed, and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocket.
\par By half past five it was growing dark, and Ron, Harry and Hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the Hallowe\rquote en feast \endash  and, more importantly, the announce\-ment of the school champions.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll come with yeh,\rquote  said Hagrid, putting away his darning. \lquote Jus\rquote  give us a sec.\rquote 
\par Hagrid got up, went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed and began searching for something inside it. They didn\rquote t pay too much attention, until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils.
\par Coughing, Ron said, \lquote Hagrid, what\rquote s that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Eh?\rquote  said Hagrid, turning around with a large bottle in his hand. \lquote Don\rquote  yeh like it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Is that aftershave?\rquote  said Hermione, in a slightly choked voice.
\par \lquote Er \endash  eau-de-Cologne,\rquote  Hagrid muttered. He was blushing. \lquote Maybe it\rquote s a bit much,\rquote  he said gruffly. \lquote I\rquote ll go take it off, hang on ...\rquote 
\par He stumped out of the cabin, and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside the window.
\par \lquote Eau-de-Cologne?\rquote  said Hermione in amazement. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Hagrid?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par \lquote And what\rquote s with the hair and the suit?\rquote  said Harry in an undertone.
\par \lquote Look!\rquote  said Ron suddenly, pointing out of the window.
\par Hagrid had just straightened up and turned round. If he had been blushing before, it was nothing to what he was doing now. Getting to their feet very cautiously, so that Hagrid wouldn\rquote t s
pot them, Harry, Ron and Hermione peered through the window and saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage, clearly about to set off for the feast, too. They couldn\rquote 
t hear what Hagrid was saying, but he was talking to Madame Maxime with a rapt, misty-eyed expression Harry had only ever seen him wear once before \endash  when he had been looking at the baby dragon, Norbert.
\par \lquote He\rquote s going up to the castle with her!\rquote  said Hermione indig\-nantly. \lquote I thought he was waiting for us?\rquote 
\par Without so much as a backward glance at his cabin, Hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with Madame Maxime, the Beauxbatons students following in their wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.
\par \lquote He fancies her!\rquote  said Ron incredulously. \lquote Well, if they end up having children, they\rquote ll be setting a world record \endash  bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton.\rquote 
\par They let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them. It was surprisingly dark outside. Drawing their cloaks more closely around themselves, they set off up the sloping lawns.
\par \lquote Ooh, it\rquote s them, look!\rquote  Hermione whispered.
\par The Durmstrang party were walking up towards the castle from the lake. Viktor Krum was walking side by side with Karkaroff, and the other Durmstrang stude
nts were straggling along behind them. Ron watched Krum excitedly, but Krum did not look around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of Hermione, Ron and Harry, and proceeded through them.
\par When they entered the candlelit Great Hall it was almost full. The Goblet of Fire had been moved; it was now standing in front of Dumbledore\rquote s empty chair at the teachers\rquote  table. Fred and George \endash  clean shaven again \endash 
 seemed to have taken their disappointment fairly well.
\par \lquote Hope it\rquote s Angelina,\rquote  said Fred, as Harry, Ron and Hermione sat down.
\par \lquote So do I!\rquote  said Hermione breathlessly. \lquote Well, we\rquote ll soon know!\rquote 
\par The Hallowe\rquote en feast seemed to take much longer than usual. Perhaps because it was their second feast in two days, Harry didn\rquote t seem to fancy the extravagantly prep
ared food as much as he would normally have done. Like everyone else in the Hall, judging by the constantly craning necks, the impa\-
tient expressions on every face, the fidgeting and the standing up to see whether Dumbledore had finished eating yet, Harry simply wanted the plates to clear, and to hear who had been selected as champions.
\par At long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless state; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall, which died away almost instantly 
as Dumbledore got to his feet. On either side of him, Professor Karkaroff and Madame Maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone. Ludo Bagman was beaming and winking at various students. Mr Crouch, however, looked quite uninterested, almost bored.

\par \lquote Well, the Goblet is almost ready to make its decision,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I estimate that it requires one more minute. Now, when the champions\rquote 
 names are called, I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall, walk along the staff table, and go through into the next chamber\rquote  \endash  he indicated the door behind the staff table \endash  \lquote 
where they will be receiving their first instructions.\rquote 
\par He took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it; at once, all the candles except those inside the carved pumpki
ns were extinguished, plunging them all into a state of semi-darkness. The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole Hall, the sparkling bright, bluey-whiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes. Everyone watched, waiting ..
. a few people kept checking their watches ...
\par \lquote Any second,\rquote  Lee Jordan whispered, two seats away from Harry.
\par The flames inside the Goblet turned suddenly red again. Sparks began to fly from it. Next moment, a tongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it \endash  the whole room gasped.
\par Dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm\rquote s length, so that he could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue white.
\par \lquote The champion for Durmstrang,\rquote  he read, in a strong, clear voice, \lquote will be Viktor Krum.\rquote 
\par \lquote No surprises there!\rquote  yelled Ron, as a storm of applause and cheering swept the Hall. Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table, and slouch up towards Dumbledore; he turned right, walked alon
g the staff table, and disappeared through the door into the next chamber.
\par \lquote Bravo, Viktor!\rquote  boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear him, even over all the applause. \lquote Knew you had it in you!\rquote 
\par The clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone\rquote s atten\-tion was focused again on the Goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.
\par \lquote The champion for Beauxbatons,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote is Fleur Delacour!\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s her, Ron!\rquote  Harry shouted, as the girl who so resembled a Veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.
\par \lquote Oh, look, they\rquote re all disappointed,\rquote  Hermione said over the noise, nodding towards the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. \lquote Disappointed\rquote 
 was a bit of an understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected had dis\-solved into tears, and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.
\par When Fleur Delacour, too, had vanished into the side cham\-ber, silence fell again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it. The Hogwarts champion next ...
\par And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks show\-ered out of it; the tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the third piece of parchment.
\par \lquote The Hogwarts champion,\rquote  he called, \lquote is Cedric Diggory!\rquote 
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet, screaming and stamp\-
ing, as Cedric made his way past them, grinning broadly, and headed off towards the chamber behind the teachers\rquote  table. Indeed, the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time before Dumbledore could make himself heard again.
\par \lquote Excellent!\rquote  Dumbledore called happily, as at last the tumult died down. \lquote Well, we now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of you, including the remaining students from Bea
uxbatons and Durmstrang, to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your champion on, you will contribute in a very real \endash \rquote 
\par But Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him.
\par The fire in the Goblet had just turned red again. Sparks were flying out of it. A long flame shot suddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another piece of parchment.
\par Automatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment. He held it out and stared at the name written upon it. There was a long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and every\-
one in the room stared at Dumbledore. And then Dumbledore cleared his throat, and read out \endash

Harry sat there, aware that every head in the Great Hall had turned to look at him. He was stunned. He felt numb. He was surely dreaming. He had not heard correctly.

of angry bees, was starting to fill the Hall; some students were standing up to get a better look at Harry as he sat, frozen, in his seat.
\par Up at the top table, Professor McGonagall had got to her feet and swept past Ludo Bagman and Professor Karkaroff to whis\-per urgently to Professor Dumbledore, who bent his ear towards her, frowning slightly.
\par Harry turned to Ron and Hermione; beyond them, he saw the long Gryffindor table all watching him, open mouthed.
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t put my name in,\rquote  Harry said blankly. \lquote You know I didn\rquote t.\rquote 
\par Both of them stared just as blankly back.
\par At the top table, Professor Dumbledore had straightened up, nodding to Professor McGonagall.
\par \lquote Harry Potter!\rquote  he called again. \lquote Harry! Up here, if you please!\rquote 
\par \lquote Go on,\rquote  Hermione whispered, giving Harry a slight push.
\par Harry got to his feet, trod on the hem of his robes and stum\-bled slightly. He set off up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables. It felt like an immensely long walk; the top table didn\rquote t seem 
to be getting any nearer at all, and he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him, as though each was a searchlight. The buzzing grew louder and louder. After what seemed like an hour, he was right in front of Dumbledore, feeling the stares of all
 the teachers upon him.
\par \lquote Well ... through the door, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore. He wasn\rquote t smiling.
\par Harry moved off along the teachers\rquote  table. Hagrid was sat right at the end. He did not wink at Harry, or wave, or give any of his usual signs of greeting. He looked completely aston\-
ished, and stared at Harry as he passed, like everyone else. Harry went through the door out of the Great Hall, and found himself in a smaller room, lined with paintings of witches and wizards. A handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite him.

\par The faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered. He saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the one next to it, which contained a wizard with a walrus moustache. The wizened witch started whisper\-ing in his ear.

\par Viktor Krum, Cedric Diggory and Fleur Delacour were grouped around the fire. They looked strangely impressive, sil\-houetted against the flames. Krum, hunched up and brooding, was leaning against the mantelpiece, slightly apart from the other
 two. Cedric was standing with his hands behind his back, staring into the fire. Fleur Delacour looked around when Harry walked in, and threw back her sheet of long, silvery hair.
\par \lquote What is it?\rquote  she said. \lquote Do zey want us back in ze Hall?\rquote 
\par She thought he had come to deliver a message. Harry didn\rquote t know how to explain what had just happened. He just stood there, looking at the three champions. It struck him how very tall all of them were.
\par There was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and Ludo Bagman entered the room. He took Harry by the arm, and led him forwards.
\par \lquote Extraordinary!\rquote  he muttered, squeezing Harry\rquote s arm. \lquote Absolutely extraordinary! Gentlemen ... lady,\rquote  he added, approaching the fireside and addressing the other three. \lquote May I introduce \endash  incredible

\par Viktor Krum straightened up. His surly face darkened as he surveyed Harry. Cedric looked nonplus
sed. He looked from Bagman to Harry and back again as though sure he must have misheard what Bagman had said. Fleur Delacour, however, tossed her hair, smiling, and said, \lquote Oh, vairy funny joke, Meester Bagman.\rquote 
\par \lquote Joke?\rquote  Bagman repeated, bewildered. \lquote No, no, not at all! Harry\rquote s name just came out of the Goblet of Fire!\rquote 
\par Krum\rquote s thick eyebrows contracted slightly. Cedric was still looking politely bewildered.
\par Fleur frowned. \lquote But evidently zair \rquote as been a mistake,\rquote  she said contemptuously to Bagman. \lquote  \rquote E cannot compete. \rquote E is too young.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well ... it is amazing,\rquote  said Bagman, rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down at Harry. \lquote But, as you know, the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety meas\-ure. And as his name\rquote 
s come out of the Goblet ... I mean, I don\rquote t think there can be any ducking out at this stage ... it\rquote s down in the rules, you\rquote re obliged ... Harry will just have to do the best he \endash \rquote 
\par The door behind them opened again, and a large group of people came in: Professor Dumbledore, followe
d closely by Mr Crouch, Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape. Harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall, before Professor McGonagall closed the door.
\par \lquote Madame Maxime!\rquote  said Fleur at once, striding over to her Headmistress. \lquote Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!\rquote 
\par Somewhere under Harry\rquote s numb disbelief, he felt a ripple of anger. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Little boy?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly-dorr?\rquote  she said imperi\-ously.

\par \lquote We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out younger contestants, Dumbledore,\rquote  said Karkaroff, his steely smile still in place, though his eyes were colder than ever. \lquote 
Otherwise, we would, of course, have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s no one\rquote s fault but Potter\rquote s, Karkaroff,\rquote  said Snape softly. His black eyes were alight with malice. \lquote Don\rquote t go blaming Dumbledore for Potter\rquote

\par \lquote Thank you, Severus,\rquote  said Dumbledore firmly, and Snape went quiet, though his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair.
\par Professor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry, who looked right back at him, trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the half-moon spectacles.
\par \lquote Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?\rquote  Dumbledore asked calmly.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. He was very aware of everybody watching him closely. Snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadows.
\par \lquote Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you?\rquote  said Professor Dumbledore, ignoring Snape.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote No,\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  said Harry vehemently.
\par \lquote Ah, but of course \rquote e is lying!\rquote  cried Madame Maxime. Snape was now shaking his head, his lip curling.
\par \lquote He could not have crossed the Age Line,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall sharply. \lquote I am sure we are all agreed on that \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbly-dorr must \rquote ave made a mistake wiz ze line,\rquote  said Madame Maxime, shrugging.
\par \lquote It is possible, of course,\rquote  said Dumbledore politely.
\par \lquote Dumbledore, you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake!\rquote  said Professor McGonagall angrily. \lquote Really, what non\-

nce. When he spoke, however, it was in his usual curt voice. \lquote We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the Tournament.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, Barty knows the rulebook back to front,\rquote  said Bagman, beaming and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter was now closed.
\par \lquote I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my stu\-dents,\rquote  said Karkaroff. He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His face wore a very ugly look indeed. \lquote 
You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more, and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions. It\rquote s only fair, Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote But Karkaroff, it doesn\rquote t work like that,\rquote  said Bagman. \lquote The Goblet of Fire\rquote s just gone out \endash  it won\rquote t re-ignite until the start of the next Tournament \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be com\-peting!\rquote  exploded Karkaroff. \lquote After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little expected something of this nature to occur! I have half a mind to leave now!
\rquote 
\par \lquote Empty threat, Karkaroff,\rquote  growled a voice from near the door. \lquote You can\rquote t leave your champion now. He\rquote s got to compete. They\rquote ve all got to compete. Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh?
\rquote 
\par Moody had just entered the room. He limped towards the fire, and with every right step he took, there was a loud }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 clunk.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody was saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him away; they had balled themselves into fists.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you?\rquote  said Moody quietly. \lquote It\rquote s very simple, Karkaroff. Someone put Potter\rquote s name in that Goblet knowing he\rquote d have to compete if it came out.\rquote 
\par \lquote Evidently, someone \rquote oo wished to give \rquote Ogwarts two bites at ze apple!\rquote  said Madame Maxime.

 said Moody, with the merest trace of a growl.
\par An extremely tense silence followed these words.
\par Ludo Bagman, who was looking very anxious indeed, bounced nervously up and down on his feet and said, \lquote Moody, old man ... what a thing to say!\rquote 
\par \lquote We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wast\-ed if he hasn\rquote t discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime,\rquote  said Karkaroff loudly. \lquote Apparently he is now teach\-
ing his students to fear assassination, too. An odd quality in a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dumbledore, but no doubt you had your reasons.\rquote 
\par \lquote Imagining things, am I?\rquote  growled Moody. \lquote Seeing things, eh? It was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy\rquote s name in that Goblet ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, what evidence is zere of zat?\rquote  said Madame Maxime, throwing up her huge hands.
\par \lquote Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object!\rquote  said Moody. \lquote It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that Goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the Tournament ... I
\rquote m guessing they submitted Potter\rquote s name under a fourth school, to make sure he was the only one in his category ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You seem to have given this a great deal of thought, Moody,\rquote  said Karkaroff coldly, \lquote and a very ingenious theory it is \endash  though,
 of course, I heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly dis\-guised basilisk egg, and smashed it to pieces before realising it was a carriage clock. So you\rquote ll understand if we don\rquote 
t take you entirely seriously ...\rquote 
\par \lquote There are those who\rquote ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage,\rquote  Moody retorted in a menacing voice. \lquote It\rquote s my job to think the way Dark wizards do, Karkaroff \endash  as you ought to remember ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Alastor!\rquote  said Dumbledore warningly. Harry wondered for a moment whom he was speaking to, but then realised \lquote Mad-Eye\rquote  could hardly be Moody\rquote 
s real first name. Moody fell silent, though still surveying Karkaroff with satisfaction \endash  Karkaroff\rquote s face was burning.
\par \lquote How this situation arose, we do not know,\rquote  said Dumbledore, speaking to everyone gathered in the room. \lquote 
It seems to me, however, that we have no choice but to accept it. Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete in the Tournament. This, therefore, they will do ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, but Dumbly-dorr \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote My dear Madame Maxime, if you have an alternative, I would be delighted to hear it.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore waited, but Madame Maxime did not speak, she merely glared. She wasn\rquote t the only one, either. Snape looked furious; Karkaroff livid. Bagman, however, looked rather excited.
\par \lquote Well, shall we crack on, then?\rquote  he said, rubbing his hands together and smiling around the room. \lquote Got to give our cham\-pions their instructions, haven\rquote t we? Barty, want to do the honours?\rquote 
\par Mr Crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  he said, \lquote instructions. Yes ... the first task ...\rquote 
\par He moved forwards into the firelight. Close to, Harry thought he looked ill. There were dark shadows beneath his eyes, and a thin, papery look about his wrinkled skin that had not been there at the Quidditch World Cup.
\par \lquote The first task is designed to test your daring,\rquote  he told Harry, Cedric, Fleur and Krum, \lquote so we are not going to be telling you what it is. Courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizard ... very important ...

\par \lquote The first task will take place on November the twenty-fourth, in front of the other students and the panel of judges.
\par \lquote The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the Tournament. The champ
ions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands. They will receive information about the second task when the first is over. Owing to the demanding and time-consuming nature of the Tournament, the champions are exempted from end-of-year tes
ts.\rquote 
\par Mr Crouch turned to look at Dumbledore. \lquote I think that\rquote s all, is it, Albus?\rquote 
\par \lquote I think so,\rquote  said Dumbledore, who was looking at Mr Crouch with mild concern. \lquote Are you sure you wouldn\rquote t like to stay at Hogwarts tonight, Barty?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, Dumbledore, I must get back to the Ministry,\rquote  said Mr Crouch. \lquote It is a very busy, very difficult time at the moment ... I\rquote 
ve left young Weatherby in charge ... very enthusiastic ... a little over-enthusiastic, if truth be told ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote ll come and have a drink before you go, at least?\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Come on, Barty, I\rquote m staying!\rquote  said Bagman brightly. \lquote It\rquote s all happening at Hogwarts now, you know, much more exciting here than at the office!\rquote 
\par \lquote I think not, Ludo,\rquote  said Crouch, with a touch of his old impatience.
\par \lquote Professor Karkaroff \endash  Madame Maxime \endash  a nightcap?\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par But Madame Maxime had already put her arm around Fleur\rquote s shoulders, and was leading her swiftly out of the room. Harry could hear them both talking very fast in French as they went off into the Great Ha
ll. Karkaroff beckoned to Krum, and they, too, exited, though in silence.
\par \lquote Harry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling at both of them. \lquote I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you, and it would be a shame
 to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise.\rquote 
\par Harry glanced at Cedric, who nodded, and they left together.
\par The Great Hall was deserted now; the candles had burnt low, giving the jagged smiles of the pumpkins an eerie, flickering quality.
\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Cedric, with a slight smile. \lquote We\rquote re playing against each other again!\rquote 
\par \lquote I s\rquote pose,\rquote  said Harry. He really couldn\rquote t think of anything to say. The inside of his head seemed to be in complete disarray, as though his brain had been ransacked.
\par \lquote So ... tell me ...\rquote  said Cedric, as they reached the Entrance Hall, which was now lit only by torches in the absence of the Goblet of Fire. \lquote How }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 did }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 you get your name in?\rquote 
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry, staring up at him. \lquote I didn\rquote t put it in. I was telling the truth.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah ... OK,\rquote  said Cedric. Harry could tell Cedric didn\rquote t believe him. \lquote Well ... see you, then.\rquote 
\par Instead of going up the marble staircase, Cedric headed for a door to its right. Harry stood listening to him going down the stone steps beyond it, then, slowly, started to climb the marble ones.
\par Was anyone except Ron and Hermione going to believe him, or would they all think he\rquote d put himself in for the Tournament? Yet how could anyone think that, when he was facing competi\-tors who\rquote d had three years\rquote 
 more magical education than he had \endash  when he was now facing tasks which not only sounded very dangerous, but which were to be performed in front of hun\-dreds of people? Yes, he\rquote d thought about it ... he\rquote 
d fantasised about it ... but it had been a joke, really, an idle sort of dream ... he\rquote d never really, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 seriously }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 considered entering ...
\par But someone else had considered it ... someone else had wanted him in the Tournament, and had made sure he was entered. Why? To give him a treat? He didn\rquote t think so, somehow ...
\par To see him make a fool of himself? Well, they were likely to get their wish ...
\par But to get him }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 killed? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Was Moody just being his usual para\-noid self? Couldn
\rquote t someone have put Harry\rquote s name in the Goblet as a trick, a practical joke? Did anyone really want him dead?
\par Harry was able to answer that at once. Yes, someone wanted him dead, someone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year old ... Lord Voldemort. But how could Voldemort have ensured that Harry\rquote 
s name got into the Goblet of Fire? Voldemort was supposed to be far away, in some distant coun\-try, in hiding, alone ... feeble and powerless ...
\par Yet in that dream he had had, just before he had awoken with his scar hurting, Voldemort had not been alone ... he had been talking to Wormtail ... plotting Harry\rquote s murder ...
\par Harry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat Lady already. He had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbour\rquote 
s painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through
 every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.
\par \lquote Well, well, well,\rquote  said the Fat Lady, \lquote Violet\rquote s just told me everything. Who\rquote s just been chosen as school champion, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote Balderdash,\rquote  said Harry dully.
\par \lquote It most certainly isn\rquote t!\rquote  said the pale witch indignantly.
\par \lquote No, no, Vi, it\rquote s the password,\rquote  said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung forwards on her hinges to let Harry into the common room.
\par The blast of noise that met Harry\rquote 
s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backwards. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor house, all of whom were screaming, applau
ding and whistling.
\par \lquote You should\rquote ve told us you\rquote d entered!\rquote  bellowed Fred; he looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed.
\par \lquote How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!\rquote  roared George.
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t,\rquote  Harry said. \lquote I don\rquote t know how \endash \rquote 
\par But Angelina had now swooped down upon him. \lquote Oh, if it couldn\rquote t be me, at least it\rquote s a Gryffindor \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match, Harry!\rquote  shrieked Katie Bell, another of the Gryffindor Chasers.
\par \lquote We\rquote ve got food, Harry, come and have some \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not hungry, I had enough at the feast \endash \rquote 
\par But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn\rquote t hungry; nobody wanted to hear that he hadn\rquote t put his name in the Goblet; not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn\rquote t at all in the mood to celebrate .
.. Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn\rquote 
t get away; whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks, for
cing another Butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands ... everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked Dumbledore\rquote s Age Line, and managed to get his name into the Goblet ...
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t,\rquote  he said, over and over again, \lquote I don\rquote t know how it happened.\rquote 
\par But for all the notice anyone took, he might just as well not have answered at all.
\par \lquote I\rquote m tired!\rquote  he bellowed finally, after nearly half an hour. \lquote No, seriously, George \endash  I\rquote m going to bed \endash \rquote 
\par He wanted more than anything to find Ron and Hermione, to find a bit of sanity, but neither of them seemed to be in the common room. Insisting that he needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little Creevey brothers as they attempted to way\-
lay him at the foot of the stairs, Harry managed to shake every\-one off, and climbed up to the dormitory as fast as he could.
\par To his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed. He looked up when Harry slammed the door behind him.
\par \lquote Where\rquote ve you been?\rquote  Harry said.
\par \lquote Oh, hello,\rquote  said Ron.
\par He was grinning, but it looked a very odd, strained sort of grin. Harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it 
was knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.
\par \lquote So,\rquote  he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner. \lquote Congratulations.\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean, congratulations?\rquote  said Harry, staring at Ron. There was definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling; it was more like a grimace.
\par \lquote Well ... no one else got across the Age Line,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Not even Fred and George. What did you use \endash  the Invisibility Cloak?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Invisibility Cloak wouldn\rquote t have got me over that line,\rquote  said Harry slowly.
\par \lquote Oh, right,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I thought you might\rquote ve told me if it was the Cloak ... because it would\rquote ve covered both of us, wouldn\rquote t it? But you found another way, did you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Listen,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote I didn\rquote t put my name in that Goblet. Someone else must\rquote ve done it.\rquote 
\par Ron raised his eyebrows. \lquote What would they do that for?\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno,\rquote  said Harry. He felt it would sound very melodra\-matic to say \lquote to kill me\rquote .
\par Ron\rquote s eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of dis\-appearing into his hair.
\par \lquote It\rquote s OK, you know, you can tell }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 me }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 the truth,\rquote  he said. 
\lquote If you don\rquote t want everyone else to know, fine, but I don\rquote t know why you\rquote re bothering to lie, you didn\rquote t get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady\rquote s, that Violet, she\rquote 
s already told us all, Dumbledore\rquote s letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And you don\rquote t have to do end-of-year tests either ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t put my name in that Goblet!\rquote  said Harry, starting to feel angry.
\par \lquote Yeah, OK,\rquote  said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric. \lquote Only you said this morning you\rquote d have done it last night, and no one would\rquote ve seen you ... I\rquote m not stupid, you know.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re doing a really good impression of it,\rquote  Harry snapped.
\par \lquote Yeah?\rquote  said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now. \lquote You want to get to bed, Harry, I expect you\rquote ll need to be up early tomorrow for a photocall or something.\rquote 
\par He wrenched the hangings shut around his four-poster, leaving Harry standing there by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe him.

When Harry woke up on Sunday morning, it took him a moment to remember why he felt so miserable and worried. Then the memory of the previous night rolled over him. He sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own four-poster, intend\-
ing to talk to Ron, to force Ron to believe him \endash  only to find that Ron\rquote s bed was empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast.

Harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room. The moment he appeared, the people who had already finished breakfast broke i
nto applause again. The prospect of going down into the Great Hall and facing the rest of the Gryffindors, all treating him like some sort of hero, was not inviting; it was that, however, or stay here and allow him\-
self to be cornered by the Creevey brothers, who were both beckoning frantically to him to join them. He walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open, climbed out of it and found himself face to face with Hermione.
\par \lquote Hello,\rquote  she said, holding up a stack of toast, which she was carrying in a napkin. \lquote I brought you this ... want to go for a walk?\rquote 
\par \lquote Good idea,\rquote  said Harry, gratefully.
\par They went downstairs, crossed the Entrance Hall quickly without looking in at the Great Hall, and were soon striding across the lawn towards the lake, whe
re the Durmstrang ship was moored, reflected blackly in the water. It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before. To his immens
e relief, Hermione accepted his story without question.
\par \lquote Well, of course, I knew you hadn\rquote t entered yourself,\rquote  she said, when he\rquote d finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the Hall. \lquote The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name! B

The Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold towards the whole lot of them. One Herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this. It was 
plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their champion\rquote 
s glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that Hufflepuff house very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffin
dor once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-Fletchley, with whom Harry nor\-mally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were re-potting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray \endash 
 though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry\rquote s grip and smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn\rquote 
t talking to Harry either. Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him \endash 
 but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff house.
\par He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins, too \endash  the first time he would come face to face with them since becoming champion.
\par Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid\rquote s cabin with his famil\-iar sneer firmly in place.
\par \lquote Ah, look, boys, it\rquote s the champion,\rquote  he said to Crabbe and Goyle, the moment he got within earshot of Harry. \lquote Got your autograph books? Better get a signature now, because I doubt he\rquote

\par Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to stop there, because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin, holding a teetering tower of crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended Skrewt. To the class\rquote s horror, Hagrid p
roceeded to explain that the reason the Skrewts had been killing each other was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution would be for each of the class to fix a leash on a Skrewt and take it for a short walk. The only good thing about this plan 
was that it distracted Malfoy completely.
\par \lquote Take this thing for a walk?\rquote  he repeated in disgust, staring into one of the boxes. \lquote And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash? Around the sting, the blasting end or the sucker?\rquote 
\par \lquote Roun\rquote  the middle,\rquote  said Hagrid, demonstrating. \lquote Er \endash  yeh might want ter put on yer dragon-hide gloves, jus\rquote  as an extra precaution, like. Harry \endash  you come here an\rquote  help me with this big one ...
\rquote 
\par Hagrid\rquote s real intention, however, was to talk to Harry away from the rest of the class.
\par He waited until everyone else had set off with their Skrewts, then turned to Harry and said, very seriously, \lquote So \endash  yer competin\rquote , Harry. In the Tournament. School champion.\rquote 
\par \lquote One of the champions,\rquote  Harry corrected him.
\par Hagrid\rquote s beetle-black eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrows. \lquote No idea who put yeh in fer it, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote You believe I didn\rquote t do it, then?\rquote  said Harry, concealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt at Hagrid\rquote s words.
\par \lquote  \rquote Course I do,\rquote  Hagrid grunted. \lquote Yeh say it wasn\rquote  you, an\rquote  I believe yeh \endash  an\rquote  Dumbledore believes yer, an\rquote  all.\rquote

\par The pair of them looked out over the lawn; the class was widely scattered now, and all in great difficulty. The Skrewts were now over three feet l
ong, and extremely powerful. No longer shell-less and colourless, they had developed a kind of thick, greyish shiny armour. They looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs \endash  but still without recog\-
nisable heads or eyes. They had become immensely strong, and very hard to control.
\par \lquote Look like they\rquote re havin\rquote  fun, don\rquote  they?\rquote  Hagrid said happily. Harry assumed he was talking about the Skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren\rquote t; every now and then, with an alarming }{\rtlch\fcs1

 he was highly unpopular there and always had been, as he had helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at Quidditch and in the Inter-Hou
se Championship. But he had hoped the Ravenclaws might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as Cedric. He was wrong, however. Most Ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the Goblet
 into accepting his name.
\par Then there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did. Exceptionally hand\-some, with his straight nose, dark hair and grey eyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days, 
Cedric or Viktor Krum. Harry actually saw the same sixth-year girls who had been so keen to get Krum\rquote s autograph, begging Cedric to sign their schoolbags one lunchtime.
\par Meanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing to come anywhere near him, Professor Trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual, and he did so badly at Summoning Charms in Professor Flitwick\rquote

\par \lquote It\rquote s really not that difficult, Harry,\rquote  Hermione tried to re\-assure him, as they left Flitwick\rquote s class \endash

\par \lquote Wonder why that was?\rquote  said Harry darkly, as Cedric Diggory walked past, surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of whom looked at Harry as though he was a particularly large Blast-Ended Skrewt. \lquote Still \endash 
 never mind, eh? Double Potions to look forward to this afternoon ...\rquote 
\par Double Potions was always a horrible experience, but these days it was nothing short of torture. Being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with Snape and the Slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to punish Harry as much as possi\-
ble for daring to become school champion, was about the most unpleasant thing Harry could imagine. He had already strug\-gled through one Friday\rquote s worth, with Hermione sitting next to him, intoning \lquote Ignore them, ignore them, ignore them
\rquote  under her breath, and he couldn\rquote t see why today should be any better.
\par When he and Hermione arrived outside Snape\rquote s dungeon after lunch, they found the Slytherins waiting outside, each and every one of them wearing a large 
badge on the front of his or her robes. For one wild moment Harry thought they were S.P.E.W. badges \endash  then he saw that they all bore the same message, in luminous red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passage:

\par Harry turned and saw Ron dragging Hermione\rquote s hand away from her face. It wasn\rquote t a pretty sight. Hermione\rquote s front teeth \endash  already larger than average \endash 
 were now growing at an alarming rate; she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated, past her bottom lip, towards her chin \endash  panic-stricken, she felt them, and let out a terrified cry.
\par \lquote And what is all this noise about?\rquote  said a soft, deadly voice. Snape had arrived.
\par The Slytherins clamoured to give their explanations. Snape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said, \lquote Explain.\rquote 
\par \lquote Potter attacked me, sir \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We attacked each other at the same time!\rquote  Harry shouted.
\par \lquote \endash  and he hit Goyle \endash  look \endash \rquote 
\par Snape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled some\-thing that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.
\par \lquote Hospital wing, Goyle,\rquote  Snape said calmly.
\par \lquote Malfoy got Hermione!\rquote  Ron said. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Look!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth \endash 
 she was doing her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing at Hermione from behind Snape\rquote 
s back.
\par Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, \lquote I see no differ\-ence.\rquote 
\par Hermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears, she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight.
\par It was lucky, perhaps, that both Harry and Ron s
tarted shouting at Snape at the same time; lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for in the confused din, it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling him. He got the gist, however.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s see,\rquote  he said, in his silkiest voice. \lquote Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get inside, or it\rquote ll be a week\rquote s worth of detentions.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s ears were ringing. The injustice of it made him want to curse Snape into a thousand slimy pieces. He passed Snape, walked with Ron to the back of the dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto the table. Ron was shaking with anger, too \endash 
 for a moment, it felt as though everything was back to normal between them, but then Ron turned, and sat down with Dean and Se
amus instead, leaving Harry alone at his table. On the other side of the dungeon, Malfoy turned his back on Snape, and pressed his badge, smirking. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 POTTER STINKS }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 flashed once more across the room.

\par \lquote Antidotes!\rquote  said Snape, looking around at them all, his cold black eyes glittering unpleasantly. \lquote You should all have pre\-

\par Snape\rquote s eyes met Harry\rquote s, and Harry knew what was coming. Snape was going to poison }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 him. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Harry imagined picking up his cauldron, and sprinting to the front of the class, and bringing it down on Snape\rquote s greasy head \endash 
\par And then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on Harry\rquote s thoughts.
\par It was Colin Creevey; he edged into the room, beaming at Harry, and walked up to Snape\rquote s desk at the front of the room.
\par \lquote Yes?\rquote  said Snape curtly.
\par \lquote Please, sir, I\rquote m supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs.\rquote 
\par Snape stared down his hooked nose at Colin, whose smile faded from his eager face.
\par \lquote Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,\rquote  said Snape coldly. \lquote He will come upstairs when this class is finished.\rquote 
\par Colin went pink.
\par \lquote Sir \endash  sir, Mr Bagman wants him,\rquote  he said nervously. \lquote All the champions have got to go, I think they want to take photo\-graphs ...\rquote 
\par Harry would have given anything he owned to have stopped Colin saying those last few words. He chanced half a glance at Ron, but Ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling.
\par \lquote Very well, very well,\rquote  Snape snapped. \lquote Potter, leave your things here, I want you back down here later to test your anti\-dote.\rquote

\par \lquote Great,\rquote  said Harry, dully. \lquote Exactly what I need. More publi\-city.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good luck!\rquote  said Colin, when they had reached the right room. Harry knocked on the door, and entered.
\par He was in a fairly small classroom; most of the desks had been pushed away to the back of the room, leaving a large space in the middle; three o
f them, however, had been placed, end to end, in front of the blackboard, and covered with a long length of velvet. Five chairs had been set behind the velvet-covered desks, and Ludo Bagman was sitting in one of them, talking to a witch Harry had never se
en before, who was wear\-ing magenta robes.
\par Viktor Krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual, and not talking to anybody. Cedric and Fleur were in conversation. Fleur looked a good deal happier than Harry had seen her so far; she kept throwing back her 
head so that her long silvery hair caught the light. A paunchy man, holding a large black camera which was smoking slightly, was watching Fleur out of the corner of his eye.
\par Bagman suddenly spotted Harry, got up quickly and bound\-ed forwards. \lquote Ah, here he is! Champion number four! In you come, Harry, in you come ... nothing to worry about, it\rquote

\par Her hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly with her heavy-jawed face. She wore jewelled spectacles. The thick fingers clutching her crocodile-skin handbag ended in two-inch nails, painted crimson.
\par \lquote I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start?\rquote  she said to Bagman, but still gazing fixedly at Harry. \lquote The youngest champion, you know ... to add a bit of colour?\rquote 
\par \lquote Certainly!\rquote  cried Bagman. \lquote That is \endash  if Harry has no objec\-tion?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash \rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Lovely,\rquote  said Rita Skeeter, and in a second, her scarlet-taloned fingers had Harry\rquote s upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip, and she was steering him out of the room again, and opening a nearby door.
\par \lquote We don\rquote t want to be in there with all that noise,\rquote  she said. \lquote Let\rquote s see ... ah, yes, this is nice and cosy.\rquote 
\par It was a broom cupboard. Harry stared at her.
\par \lquote Come along, dear \endash  that\rquote s right \endash  lovely,\rquote  said Rita Skeeter again, perching herself precariously upon an upturned bucket, pushing Harry down onto a cardboard box and closing the door, throwing them into darkness. 
\lquote Let\rquote s see now ...\rquote 
\par She unsnapped her crocodile-skin handbag and pulled out a handful of candles, which she lit with a wave of her wand and magicked into mid-air, so that they could see what they were doing.
\par \lquote You won\rquote t mind, Harry, if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill? It leaves me free to talk to you normally ...\rquote 
\par \lquote A what?\rquote  said Harry.
\par Rita Skeeter\rquote s smile widened. Harry counted three gold teeth. She reached again into her crocodile bag, and drew out a long acid-green quill and a roll of parchment, which she stretched out between them on a crate of Mrs Skower\rquote 
s All-Purpose Magical Mess-Remover. She put the tip of the green quill into her mouth, sucked it for a moment with apparent relish, then placed it upright on the parchment, where it stood balanced on its point, quivering slightly.
\par \lquote Testing ... my name is Rita Skeeter, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 reporter.\rquote

\par \lquote Well ... they say it\rquote s going to be a lot safer this year,\rquote  said Harry.
\par The quill whizzed across the parchment between them, back and forwards as though it was skating.

Before Rita Skeeter could say a word, the door of the broom cupboard was pulled open. Harry looked around, blinking in the bright light. Albus Dumbledore stood there, looking down at both of them squashed into the cupboard.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Dumbledore!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 cried Rita Skeeter, with every appearance of delight 
\endash  but Harry noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from the box of Magical Mess-Remover, and Rita\rquote s clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her crocodile-skin bag. \lquote How are you?\rquote 
 she said, standing up and holding out one of her large, mannish hands to Dumbledore. \lquote I hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards\rquote  Conference?\rquote

\par \lquote I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rude\-ness, Rita,\rquote  said Dumbledore, with a courteous bow and a smile, \lquote but I\rquote 
m afraid we will have to discuss the matter later. The Weighing of the Wands is about to start, and it cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard.\rquote 
\par Very glad to get away from Rita Skeeter, Harry hurried back into the room. The other champions were now sitting in chairs near the door, and he sat down quickly next to Cedric, looking up at the velvet-cove
red table, where four of the five judges were now sitting \endash 
 Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Mr Crouch and Ludo Bagman. Rita Skeeter settled herself down in a corner; Harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again, spread it on her knee, suck the
 end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and place it once more on the parchment.
\par \lquote May I introduce Mr Ollivander?\rquote  said Dumbledore, taking his place at the judges\rquote  table, and talking to the champions. \lquote He will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the Tournament.\rquote 

\par Harry looked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with large, pale eyes standing quietly by the window. Harry had met Mr Ollivander before \endash  he was the wand-maker from whom Harry had bought his own wand ov

\par \lquote Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you forward first, please?\rquote  said Mr Ollivander, stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room.
\par Fleur Delacour swept over to Mr Ollivander, and handed him her wand.
\par \lquote Hmmm ...\rquote  he said.
\par He twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a number of pink and gold sparks. Then he held it close to his eyes and examined it carefully.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  he said quietly, \lquote nine and a half inches ... inflexible ... rosewood ... and containing ... dear me \'85\rquote

\par Mr Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand, apparently checking for scratches or bumps; then he muttered, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Orchideous!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39

\par \lquote Very well, very well, it\rquote s in fine working order,\rquote  said Mr Ollivander, scooping up the flowers and handing them to Fleur with her wand. \lquote Mr Diggory, you next.\rquote 
\par Fleur glided back to her seat, smiling at Cedric as he passed her.
\par \lquote Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Mr Ollivander, with much more enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand. \lquote 
Yes, I remember it well. Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn ... must have been seven\-teen hands; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail. Twelve and a quarter inches ... ash ... pleasantly spri

\par \lquote Polished it last night,\rquote  said Cedric, grinning.
\par Harry looked down at his own wand. He could see finger marks all over it. He gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to rub it clean surreptitiously. Several gold sparks shot out of the end of it. Fleur Delacour gave him a very patro\-
nising look, and he desisted.
\par Mr Ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the room from the tip of Cedric\rquote s wand, pronounced himself satis\-fied, and then said, \lquote Mr Krum, if you please.\rquote 
\par Viktor Krum got up and slouched, round-shouldered and duck-footed, towards Mr Ollivander. He thrust his wand out and stood scowling, with his hands in the pockets of his robes.
\par \lquote Hmm,\rquote  said Mr Ollivander, \lquote this is a Gregorovitch creation, unless I\rquote m much mistaken? A fine wand-maker, though the styling is never quite what I ... however ...\rquote

\par The hornbeam wand let off a blast like a gun, and a number of small, twittering birds flew out of the end, and through the open window into the watery sunlight.
\par \lquote Good,\rquote  said Mr Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand. \lquote Which leaves ... Mr Potter.\rquote 
\par Harry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr Ollivander. He handed over his wand.
\par \lquote Aaaah, yes,\rquote  said Mr Ollivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming. \lquote Yes, yes, yes. How well I remember.\rquote 
\par Harry could remember, too. He could remember it as though it had happened yesterday ...
\par Four summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had entered Mr Ollivander\rquote s shop with Hagrid to buy a wand. Mr Ollivander had taken his measurements and then started hand\-
ing him wands to try. Harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until at last he had found the one that suited him \endash  this one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single 
feather from the tail of a phoenix. Mr Ollivander had been very surprised that Harry had been so compatible with this wand. \lquote Curious,\rquote  he had said, \lquote ... curious\rquote 
, and not until Harry asked what was curious had Mr Ollivander explained that the phoenix feather in Harry\rquote s wand had come from the same bird which had supplied the core of Lord Voldemort\rquote s.
\par Harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody. He was very fond of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to Voldemort\rquote s wand was something it couldn\rquote t help \endash  rather as he couldn\rquote 
t help being related to Aunt Petunia. However, he really hoped that Mr Ollivander wasn\rquote t about to tell the room about it. He had a funny feeling Rita Skeeter\rquote s Quick-Quotes Quill might just explode with excite\-ment if he did.
\par Mr Ollivander spent much longer examining Harry\rquote s wand than anyone else\rquote s. Eventually, however, he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it back to Harry, announcing that it was still in perfect condition.
\par \lquote Thank you all,\rquote  said Dumbledore, standing up at the judges\rquote  table. \lquote You may go back to your lessons now \endash  or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to end \endash \rquote 
\par Feeling that at last something had gone right today, Harry got up to leave, but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat.
\par \lquote Photos, Dumbledore, photos!\rquote  cried Bagman excitedly. \lquote All the judges and champions. What do you think, Rita?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  yes, let\rquote s do those first,\rquote  said Rita Skeeter, whose eyes were upon Harry again. \lquote And then perhaps some individual shots.\rquote 
\par The photographs took a long time. Madame Maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood, and the photographer couldn\rquote t stand far enough back to get her into the frame; eventually she had to sit whi
le everyone else stood around her. Karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl; Krum, who Harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of thing, skulked, half-hidden, at the back of the group. The photograph
er seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater prominence. Then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions. At last, they were free to go.
\par Harry went down to dinner. Hermione wasn\rquote t there \endash 
 he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed. He ate alone at the end of the table, then returned to Gryffindor Tower, thinking of all the extra work on Summoning Charms that he had to do. Up in the dormitory, he came across Ron.

\par \lquote You\rquote ve had an owl,\rquote  said Ron brusquely, the moment he walked in. He was pointing at Harry\rquote s pillow. The school barn owl was waiting for him there.
\par \lquote Oh \endash  right,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote And we\rquote ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape\rquote s dungeon,\rquote  said Ron.
\par He then walked straight out of the room, not looking at Harry. For a moment, Harry considered going after him \endash  he wasn\rquote t sure whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him, both seemed quite appealing \endash  but the lure of Sirius\rquote 
 answer was too strong. Harry strode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg, and unrolled it.

The prospect of talking face to face with Sirius was all that sustained Harry over the next fortnight, the only bright spot on a horizon that had never looked darker. The shock of find\-
ing himself school champion had worn off slightly now, and the fear of what was facing him was starting to sink in. The first task was drawing steadily nearer; he felt as though it was crouching ahead of him like some horrific monster, barring hi
s path. He had never suffered nerves like these; they were way beyond anything he had felt before a Quidditch match, not even his last one against Slytherin, which had decided who would win the Quidditch Cup. Harry was finding it hard to think about the f
uture at all, he felt as if his whole life had been leading up to, and would finish with, the first task ...

t see how Sirius was going to make him feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic
 in front of hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment. Harry wrote back to Sirius, saying that he would be beside the common-room fire at the time Sirius had suggested, and he and Hermione spent a long tim
e going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the common room on the night in question. If the worst came to the worst, they were going to drop a bag of Dungbombs, but they hoped they wouldn\rquote t have to resort to that \endash 
 Filch would skin them alive.
\par In 
the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the confines of the castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece about the Triwizard Tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the Tournament, as a highly coloured life story 
o
f Harry. Much of the front page had been given over to a picture of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two, six and seven) had been all about Harry, the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last li
ne of the article, and Cedric hadn\rquote t been mentioned at all.
\par The article had appeared ten days ago, and Harry still got a sick, burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it. Rita Skeeter had reported him saying an awful lot of things that he couldn\rquote 
t remember ever saying in his life, let alone in that broom cupboard.

\par \lquote Ignore it,\rquote  Hermione said in a dignified voice, holding her head in the air and stalking past the sniggering Slytherin girls as though she couldn\rquote t hear them. \lquote Just ignore it, Harry.\rquote 
\par But Harry couldn\rquote t ignore it. Ron hadn\rquote t spoken to him at all since he had told him about Snape\rquote s detentions. Harry had half hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats\rquote  brains in Snape

\par Hermione was furious with the pair of them; she went from one to the other, trying to force them to talk to each other, but Harry was adamant: he would talk to Ron again only if Ron admitted that Harry hadn\rquote t put his name in the G

\par \lquote Oh, yeah?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Look behind you.\rquote 
\par Rita Skeeter and her photographer friend had just emerged from the Three Broomsticks pub. Talking in low voices, they passed right by Hermione without
 looking at her. Harry backed into the wall of Honeydukes to stop Rita Skeeter hitting him with her crocodile-skin handbag.
\par When they were gone, Harry said, \lquote She\rquote s staying in the village. I bet she\rquote s coming to watch the first task.\rquote 
\par As he said it, his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic. He didn\rquote t mention this; he and Hermione hadn\rquote t dis\-cussed what was coming in the first task much; he had the feeling she didn\rquote t want to think about it.
\par \lquote She\rquote s gone,\rquote  said Hermione, looking right through Harry towards the end of the High Street. \lquote Why don\rquote t we go and have a Butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks. It\rquote s a bit cold, isn\rquote t it? You don\rquote 
t have to talk to Ron!\rquote  she added irritably, correctly interpreting his silence.
\par The Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with Hogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon, but also with a variety of magical people Harry rarely saw anywhere else. Harry sup\-
posed that as Hogsmeade was the only all-wizard village in Britain, it was a bit of a haven for creatures like hags, who were not as adept as wizards at disguising themselves.
\par It was very hard to move through crowds in the Invisibility Cloak, in case you accidentally trod on someone, which tend\-ed to lead to awkward questions. Harry edged slowly towards a spare table in the c
orner while Hermione went to buy drinks. On his way through the pub, Harry spotted Ron, who was sit\-
ting with Fred, George and Lee Jordan. Resisting the urge to give Ron a good hard poke in the back of the head, he finally reached the table and sat down at it.
\par Hermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a Butterbeer under his Cloak.
\par \lquote I look such an idiot, sitting here on my own,\rquote  she muttered. \lquote Lucky I brought something to do.\rquote 
\par And she pulled out a notebook in which she had been keep\-ing a record of S.P.E.W. members. Harry saw his and Ron\rquote 
s names at the top of the very short list. It seemed a very long time ago that they had sat making up those predictions together, and Hermione had turned up and appointed them secretary and treasurer.
\par \lquote You know, maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved in S.P.E.W.,\rquote  Hermione said thoughtfully, looking around the pub.
\par \lquote Yeah, right,\rquote  said Harry. He took a swig of Butterbeer under his Cloak. \lquote Hermione, when are you going to give up on this S.P.E.W. stuff?\rquote 
\par \lquote When house-elves have decent wages and working condi\-tions!\rquote  she hissed back. \lquote You know, I\rquote m starting to think it\rquote s time for more direct action. I wonder how you get into the school kitchens?\rquote

\ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  badge, though ... this cheered Harry up very slightly ...
\par What wouldn\rquote t he have given to be one of these people, sitting around laughing and talking, with nothing to worry about but homework? He imagined how it would have felt to be here if his name }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 hadn\rquote t }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 come out of the Goblet of Fire. He wouldn\rquote 
t be wearing the Invisibility Cloak, for one thing. Ron would be sit\-ting with him. The three of them would probably be happily imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing on Tuesday. He\rquote d have been really looking for
\-ward to it, watching them do whatever it was ... cheering on Cedric with everyone else, safe in a seat at the back of the stands ...
\par He wondered how the other champions were feeling. Every time he had seen Cedric lately, he had been surrounded by admirers, and looking nervous but excited. Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour f
rom time to time in the corridors; she looked exactly as she always did, haughty and unruffled. And Krum just sat in the library, poring over books.
\par Harry thought of Sirius, and the tight, tense knot in his chest seemed to ease slightly. He would be speaking to him in just over twelve hours, for tonight was the night they were meeting at the common-room fire \endash 
 assuming nothing went wrong, as everything else had done lately ...
\par \lquote Look, it\rquote s Hagrid!\rquote  said Hermione.
\par The back of Hagrid\rquote s enormous shaggy head \endash  he had merci\-fully abandoned his bunches \endash  emerged over the crowd. Harry wondered why he hadn\rquote 
t spotted him at once, as Hagrid was so large, but standing up carefully, he saw that Hagrid had been leaning low, talking to Professor Moody. Hagrid had his usual
 enormous tankard in front of him, but Moody was drinking from his hip-flask. Madam Rosmerta, the pretty landlady, didn\rquote 
t seem to think much of this; she was looking askance at Moody as she collected glasses from tables around them. Perhaps she thought it 
was an insult to her mulled mead, but Harry knew better. Moody had told them all during their last Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson that he preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times, as it was so easy for Dark wizards to poison an unatt
ended cup.
\par As Harry watched, he saw Hagrid and Moody get up to leave. He waved, then remembered that Hagrid couldn\rquote t see him. Moody, however, paused, his magical eye on the corner where Harry was standing. He tapped Hagrid in the small of the back (being un
able to reach his shoulder), muttered some\-thing to him, and then the pair of them made their way back across the pub towards Harry and Hermione\rquote s table.
\par \lquote All right, Hermione?\rquote  said Hagrid loudly.
\par \lquote Hello,\rquote  said Hermione, smiling back.
\par Moody limped around the table and bent down; Harry thought he was reading the S.PE.W. notebook, until he mut\-tered, \lquote Nice Cloak, Potter.\rquote 
\par Harry stared at him in amazement. The large chunk missing from Moody\rquote s nose was particularly obvious at a few inches\rquote  distance. Moody grinned.
\par \lquote Can your eye \endash  I mean, can you \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, it can see through Invisibility Cloaks,\rquote  Moody said quietly. \lquote And it\rquote s come in useful at times, I can tell you.\rquote 
\par Hagrid was beaming down at Harry, too. Harry knew Hagrid couldn\rquote t see him, but Moody had obviously told Hagrid he was there.
\par Hagrid now bent down on the pretext of reading the S.P.E.W. notebook as well, and said in a whisper so low that only Harry could hear it, \lquote Harry, meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin. Wear that Cloak.\rquote 
\par Straightening up, Hagrid said loudly, \lquote Nice ter see yeh, Hermione,\rquote  winked, and departed. Moody followed him.
\par \lquote Why does he want me to meet him at midnight?\rquote  Harry said, very surprised.
\par \lquote Does he?\rquote  said Hermione, looking startled. \lquote I wonder what he\rquote s up to? I don\rquote t know whether you should go, Harry ...\rquote  She looked nervously around, and hissed, \lquote It might make you late for Sirius.\rquote 

\par It was true that going down to Hagrid\rquote s at midnight would mean cutting his meeting with Sirius very fine indeed; Hermione suggested sending Hedwig down to Hagrid\rquote s to tell him he couldn\rquote t go \endash 
 always assuming she would consent to take the note, of course \endash  Harry, however, thought it better just to be quick at whatever Hagrid wanted him for. He was very curious to know what this might be; Hagrid had never a
sked Harry to visit him so late at night.

Harry crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on his watch. Then Hermione opened the Fat Lady for him from outside as they had planned. He slipped past her with a whispered \lquote Thanks!\rquote 
 and set off through the castle.

\rquote s cabin. The inside of the enormous Beauxbatons carriage was also lit up; Harry could hear Madame Maxime talking inside it as he knocked on Hagrid\rquote s front door.
\par \lquote You there, Harry?\rquote  Hagrid whispered, opening the door and looking around.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, slipping inside the cabin and pulling the Cloak down off his head. \lquote What\rquote s up?\rquote 
\par \lquote Got summat ter show yeh,\rquote  said Hagrid.
\par There was an air of enormous excitement about Hagrid. He was wearing a flower that resembled an oversized artichoke in his buttonhole. It looked as though he had abandoned the use of axle grease, but he had certainly attempted to comb his hair \endash 
 Harry could see the comb\rquote s broken teeth tangled in it.
\par \lquote What\rquote re you showing me?\rquote  Harry said warily, wondering if the Skrewts had laid eggs, or Hagrid had managed to buy another giant three-headed dog off a stranger in a pub.
\par \lquote Come with me, keep quiet an\rquote  keep yerself covered with that Cloak,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote We won\rquote  take Fang, he won\rquote  like it ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Listen, Hagrid, I can\rquote t stay long ... I\rquote ve got to be back up at the castle for one o\rquote clock \endash \rquote 
\par But Hagrid wasn\rquote t listening; he was opening the cabin door and striding off into the night. Harry hurried to follow and found, to his great surprise, that Hagrid was leading him to the Beauxbatons carriage.
\par \lquote Hagrid, what \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Shhh!\rquote  said Hagrid, and he knocked three times on the door bearing the crossed, golden wands.
\par Madame Maxime opened it. She was wearing a silk shawl wrapped around her massive shoulders. She smiled when she saw Hagrid. \lquote Ah, \rquote Agrid ... it is time?\rquote 
\par \lquote Bong-sewer,\rquote  said Hagrid, beaming at her, and holding out a hand to help her down the golden steps.
\par Madame Maxime closed the door behind her, Hagrid offered her his arm, and they set off around the edge of the paddock containing Madame Maxime\rquote s giant winged horses, with Harry, totally bewildered, running to keep up wi
th them. Had Hagrid wanted to show him Madame Maxime? He could see her any old time he wanted ... she wasn\rquote t exactly hard to miss ...
\par But it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the same treat as Harry, because after a while she said playfully, \lquote Wair is it you are taking me, \rquote Agrid?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeh\rquote ll enjoy this,\rquote  said Hagrid gruffly. \lquote Worth seein\rquote , trust me. On\rquote y \endash  don\rquote  go tellin\rquote  anyone I showed yeh, right? Yeh\rquote re not s\rquote posed ter know.\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course not,\rquote  said Madame Maxime, fluttering her long black eyelashes.
\par And still they walked, Harry getting more and more irritable as he jogged along in their wake, checking his watch every now and then. Hagrid had some harebrained scheme in hand, which might make him miss Sirius. If they didn\rquote 
t get there soon, he was going to turn around, go straight back to the cas\-tle, and leave Hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with Madame Maxime ...
\par But then \endash  when they had walked so far around the perime\-ter of the Forest that the castle and the lake were out of sight \endash  Harry heard something. Men were shouting up ahead ... then came a deafening, ear-splitting roar ...
\par Hagrid led Madame Maxime around a clump of trees, and came to a halt. Harry hurried up alongside them \endash  for a split second, he thought he was seeing bonfires, and men darting around them \endash  and then his mouth fell open.

\par Four fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons were rearing on their hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks of wood, roaring and snorting \endash  torrents of fire were shooting into the dar
k sky from their open, fanged mouths, fifty feet above the ground on their outstretched necks. There was a silvery blue one with long, pointed horns, snapping and snarling at the wizards on the ground; a smooth-scaled green one, which was writhing and sta
mping with all its might; a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold spikes around its face, which was shooting mushroom-shaped fire clouds into the air, and a gigantic black one, more lizard-like than the others, which was nearest to them.
\par At least thirty w
izards, seven or eight to each dragon, were attempting to control them, pulling on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around their necks and legs. Mesmerised, Harry looked up, high above him, and saw the eyes of the black dragon, with vertical p

\par \lquote Isn\rquote  it beautiful?\rquote  said Hagrid softly.
\par \lquote It\rquote s no good!\rquote  yelled another wizard. \lquote Stunning Spells, on the count of three!\rquote

 several tons of sinewy, scaly black dragon hit the ground with a thud that Harry could have sworn had made the trees behind him quake.
\par The dragon-keepers lowered their wands and walked for\-wards to their fallen charges, each of which was the size of a small hill. They hurried to tighten the chains and fasten them securely to
 iron pegs, which they forced deep into the ground with their wands.
\par \lquote Wan\rquote  a closer look?\rquote  Hagrid asked Madame Maxime excited\-ly. The pair of them moved right up to the fence, and Harry followed. The wizard who had warned Hagrid not to come any closer turned, and Harry realised who it was \endash 
 Charlie Weasley.
\par \lquote All right, Hagrid?\rquote  he panted, coming over to talk. \lquote They should be OK now \endash  we put them out with a Sleeping Draught on the way here, thought it might be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet \endash 
 but, like you saw, they weren\rquote t happy, not happy at all \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What breeds you got here, Charlie?\rquote  said Hagrid, gazing at the closest dragon \endash  the black one \endash  with something close to reverence. Its eyes were still just open. Harry could see a strip of 
gleaming yellow beneath its wrinkled black eyelid.
\par \lquote This is a Hungarian Horntail,\rquote  said Charlie. \lquote There\rquote s a Common Welsh Green over there, the smaller one \endash  a Swedish Short-Snout, that blue grey \endash  and a Chinese Fireball, that\rquote s the red.\rquote 
\par Charlie looked around; Madame Maxime was strolling away around the edge of the enclosure, gazing at the Stunned dragons.
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t know you were bringing her, Hagrid,\rquote  Charlie said, frowning. \lquote The champions aren\rquote t supposed to know what\rquote s coming \endash  she\rquote s bound to tell her student, isn\rquote t she?\rquote 
\par \lquote Jus\rquote  thought she\rquote d like ter see \rquote em,\rquote  shrugged Hagrid, still gazing, enraptured, at the dragons.
\par \lquote Really romantic date, Hagrid,\rquote  said Charlie, shaking his head.
\par \lquote Four ...\rquote  said Hagrid, \lquote so it\rquote s one fer each o\rquote  the champions, is it? What\rquote ve they gotta do \endash  fight \rquote em?\rquote 
\par \lquote Just get past them, I think,\rquote  said Charlie. \lquote We\rquote ll be on hand if it gets nasty, extinguishing spells at the ready. They wanted nesting mothers, I don\rquote t know why ... but I tell you this, I don\rquote 
t envy the one who gets the Horntail. Vicious thing. Its back end\rquote s as dangerous as its front, look.\rquote 
\par Charlie pointed towards the Horntail\rquote s tail, and Harry saw long, bronze-coloured spikes protruding along it every few inches.
\par Five of Charlie\rquote s fellow keepers staggered up to the Horntail at that moment, carrying a clutch of huge granite-grey eggs between them in a blanket. They placed them carefully at the Horntail\rquote s side. Hagrid let out a moan of longing.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve got them counted, Hagrid,\rquote  said Charlie, sternly. Then he said, \lquote How\rquote s Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Fine,\rquote  said Hagrid. He was still gazing at the eggs.
\par \lquote Just hope he\rquote s still fine after he\rquote s faced this lot,\rquote  said Charlie grimly, looking out over the dragons\rquote  enclosure. \lquote I didn\rquote t dare tell Mum what he\rquote s got to do for the first task, she\rquote

\par Harry had had enough. Trusting to the fact that Hagrid wouldn\rquote t miss him, with the attractions of four dragons and Madame Maxime to occupy him, he turned silently, and began to walk away, back to the castle.
\par He didn\rquote t know whether he was glad he\rquote d seen what was coming or not. Perhaps this way was better. The first shock was over now. Maybe if he\rquote d seen the dragons for the first time on Tuesday, he would have passed ou

 against a fifty-foot-high, scaly, spike-ridden, fire-breathing dragon. And he had to get past it. With everyone watching. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 How?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Harry fell backwards, his glasses askew, clutching the Cloak around him. A voice nearby said, \lquote Ouch! Who\rquote s there?\rquote 
\par Harry hastily checked that the Cloak was covering him and lay very still, staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit. He recognised the goatee ... it was Karkaroff.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s there?\rquote  said Karkaroff again, very suspiciously, look\-ing around in the darkness. Harry remained still and silent. After a minute or so, Kark
aroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort of animal; he was looking around at waist height, as though expecting to see a dog. Then he crept back under the cover of the trees, and started to edge forwards towards the place where the dragons were.

\par Very slowly and very carefully, Harry got to his feet and set off again, as fast as he could without making too much noise, hurrying through the darkness back towards Hogwarts.
\par He had no doubt whatsoever what Karkaroff was up to. He had sneaked off his ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be. He might even have spotted Hagrid and Madame Maxime heading off around the Forest together \endash 
 they were hardly difficul
t to spot at a distance ... and now all Karkaroff had to do was follow the sound of voices, and he, like Madame Maxime, would know what was in store for the champions. By the looks of it, the only champion who would be facing the unknown on Tuesday was Ce
dric.
\par Harry reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors and began to climb the marble stairs; he was very out of breath, but he didn\rquote t dare slow down ... he had less than five minutes to get up to the fire ...
\par \lquote Balderdash!\rquote  he gasped at the Fat Lady, who was snoozing in her frame in front of the portrait hole.
\par \lquote If you say so,\rquote  she muttered sleepily, without opening her eyes, and the picture swung forwards to admit him. Harry climbed inside. The common room was deserted, and, judging by the fact th
at it smelled quite normal, Hermione had not needed to set off any Dungbombs to ensure that he and Sirius got privacy.
\par Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw himself into an armchair in front of the fire. The room was in semi-darkness; the flames were the only source of light. Nearby, on a table, the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote You and the rest of the world,\rquote  said Harry bitterly.
\par \lquote \endash  and, reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman\rquote s article last month, Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts. Yes, I know she says it was another false alarm,\rquote 
 Sirius said hastily, seeing Harry about to speak, \lquote but I don\rquote t think so, somehow. I think someone tried to stop him getting to Hogwarts. I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around. And no one\rquote 
s going to look into it too closely, Mad-Eye\rquote s heard intruders a bit too often. But that doesn\rquote t mean he can\rquote t still spot the real thing. Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had.\rquote 
\par \lquote So ... what are you saying?\rquote  said Harry slowly. \lquote Karkaroff\rquote s trying to kill me? But \endash  why?\rquote 
\par Sirius hesitated.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve been hearing some very strange things,\rquote  he said slowly. \lquote The Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately. They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup, didn\rquote 
t they? Someone set off the Dark Mark ... and then \endash  did you hear about that Ministry of Magic witch who\rquote s gone missing?\rquote 
\par \lquote Bertha Jorkins?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Exactly ... she disappeared in Albania, and that\rquote s definitely where Voldemort was rumoured to be last ... and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn\rquote t she?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, but ... it\rquote s not very likely she\rquote d have walked straight into Voldemort, is it?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,\rquote  said Sirius grimly. \lquote She was at Hogwarts when I was, a few years above your dad and me. And she was an idiot. Very nosy, but no brains, none at all. It\rquote s not a good combination, Harry. I\rquote 
d say she\rquote d be very easy to lure into a trap.\rquote 
\par \lquote So ... so Voldemort could have found out about the Tournament?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Is that what you mean? You think Karkaroff might be here on his orders?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Sirius slowly, \lquote I just don\rquote t know ... Karkaroff doesn\rquote t strike me as the type who\rquote d g
o back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him. But whoever put your name in that Goblet did it for a reason, and I can\rquote 
t help thinking the Tournament would be a very good way to attack you, and make it look like an accident.\rquote 
\par \lquote Looks like a really good plan from where I\rquote m standing,\rquote  said Harry bleakly. \lquote They\rquote ll just have to stand back and let the drag\-ons do their stuff.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right \endash  these dragons,\rquote  said Sirius, speaking very quickly now. \lquote There\rquote s a way, Harry. Don\rquote t be tempted to try a Stunning Spell \endash 
 dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner. You need about half-a-dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I know, I just saw,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote But you can do it alone,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote There is a way, and a simple spell\rquote s all you need. Just \endash \rquote 
\par But Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly pounding as though it would burst. He could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind him.
\par \lquote Go!\rquote  he hissed at Sirius. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Go! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 There\rquote

 he watched the bottom of the spiral staircase \endash  who had decided to go for a stroll at one o\rquote clock in the morn\-ing, and stopped Sirius telling him how to get past a dragon?
\par It was Ron. Dressed in his maroon paisley pyjamas, Ron stopped dead facing Harry across the room, and looked around.
\par \lquote Who were you talking to?\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote What\rquote s that got to do with you?\rquote  Harry snarled. \lquote What are you doing down here at this time of night?\rquote

\par \lquote Just thought you\rquote d come nosing around, did you?\rquote  Harry shouted. He knew that Ron had no idea what he\rquote d walked in on, knew he hadn\rquote t done it on purpose, but he didn\rquote t care \endash 
 at this moment he hated everything about Ron, right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pyjama trousers.
\par \lquote Sorry about that,\rquote  said Ron, his face reddening with anger. \lquote Should\rquote ve realised you didn\rquote t want to be disturbed. I\rquote ll let you get on with practising for your next interview in peace.\rquote

\par \lquote There you go,\rquote  Harry said. \lquote Something for you to wear on Tuesday. You might even have a scar now, if you\rquote re lucky ... that\rquote s what you want, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par He strode across the room towards the stairs; he half expect\-ed Ron to stop him, he would even have liked Ron to throw a punch at him, but Ron just stood there in his too small pyja\-

Harry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before he realised he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock. When he\rquote 
d finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body, he hurried off to find
 Hermione, locating her at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, where she was eating breakfast with Ginny. Feeling too queasy to eat, Harry waited until Hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then dragged her out into the grounds for ano
ther walk. There, he told her all about the dragons, and about everything Sirius had said, while they took another long walk around the lake.

\par They walked three times around the lake, trying all the way to think of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon. Nothi

Harry barely slept that night. When he awoke on Monday morning, he seriously considered, for the first time ever, just run
ning away from Hogwarts. But as he looked around the Great Hall at breakfast time, and thought about what leaving the castle would mean, he knew he couldn\rquote

Somehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back in Privet Drive with Dudley was good to know; it made him feel slightly calmer. He finished his bacon with difficulty (his throat wasn\rquote

s article at him every time he went near them. He followed Cedric at a distance, and saw that he was heading towards the Charms corridor. This gave Harry an idea. Pausing at a dis\-tance from them, he pulled out his wand, and took careful aim.

\par This was exactly what Harry had been hoping for. He slipped his wand back into his robes, waited until Cedric\rquote s friends had disappeared into their classroom, and hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of everyone but himself and Cedric.

\par \lquote Cedric,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote the first task is dragons.\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Cedric, looking up.
\par \lquote Dragons,\rquote  said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick came out to see where Cedric had got to. \lquote They\rquote ve got four, one for each of us, and we\rquote ve got to get past them.\rquote 
\par Cedric stared at him. Harry saw some of the panic he\rquote d been feeling since Saturday night flickering in Cedric\rquote s grey eyes.
\par \lquote Are you sure?\rquote  Cedric said, in a hushed voice.
\par \lquote Dead sure,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I\rquote ve seen them.\rquote 
\par \lquote But how did you find out? We\rquote re not supposed to know ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Never mind,\rquote  said Harry quickly \endash  he knew Hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth. \lquote But I\rquote m not the only one who knows. Fleur and Krum will know by now \endash  Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons, too.
\rquote 
\par Cedric straightened up, his arms full of inky quills, parch\-ment and books, his ripped bag dangling off one shoulder. He stared at Harry, and there was a puzzled, almost suspicious look in his eyes.
\par \lquote Why are you telling me?\rquote  he asked.
\par Harry looked at him in disbelief. He was sure Cedric would\-n\rquote t have asked that if he had seen the dragons himself. Harry wouldn\rquote t have let his worst enemy face those monsters unpre\-pared \endash  well, perhaps Malfoy or Snape ...
\par \lquote It\rquote s just ... fair, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  he said to Cedric. \lquote We all know now ... we\rquote re on an even footing, aren\rquote t we?\rquote 
\par Cedric was still looking at him in a slightly suspicious way when Harry heard a familiar clunking noise behind him. He turned around, and saw Mad-Eye Moody emerging from a nearby classroom.
\par \lquote Come with me, Potter,\rquote  he growled. \lquote Diggory, off you go.\rquote 
\par Harry stared apprehensively at Moody. Had he overheard them? \lquote Er \endash  Professor, I\rquote m supposed to be in Herbology \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Never mind that, Potter. In my office, please ...\rquote 
\par Harry followed him, wondering what was going to happen to him now. What if Moody wanted to know how he\rquote d found out about the dragons? Would Moody go to Dumbledore and tell o
n Hagrid, or just turn Harry into a ferret? Well, it might be easier to get past a dragon if he was a ferret, Harry thought dully, he\rquote d be smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet ...
\par He followed Moody into his office. Moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at Harry, his magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one.
\par \lquote That was a very decent thing you just did, Potter,\rquote  Moody said quietly.
\par Harry didn\rquote t know what to say; this wasn\rquote t the reaction he had expected at all.
\par \lquote Sit down,\rquote  said Moody, and Harry sat, looking around.
\par He had visited this office under two of its previous occu\-pants. In Professor Lockhart\rquote s day, the walls had been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of Professor Lockhart himself. When Lupin had li
ved here, you were more likely to come across a specimen of some fascinating new Dark creature he had procured for them to study in class. Now, however, the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that Harry supposed Moody had used in the
 days when he had been an Auror.
\par On his desk stood what looked like a large, cracked, glass spinning top; Harry recognised it at once as a Sneakoscope, because he owned one himself, though it was much smaller than Moody\rquote s. In the corner on a small table sto
od an object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial. It was humming slightly. What appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry on the wall, but it was not reflecting the room. Shadowy figures were moving around inside it, n
one of them clearly in focus.
\par \lquote Like my Dark detectors, do you?\rquote  said Moody, who was watching Harry closely.
\par \lquote What\rquote s that?\rquote  Harry asked, pointing at the squiggly golden aerial.
\par \lquote Secrecy Sensor. Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies ... no use here, of course, too much interference \endash  students in every direction lying about why they haven\rquote 
t done their homework. Been humming ever since I got here. I had to disable my Sneakoscope because it wouldn\rquote t stop whistling. It\rquote s extra sensitive, picks up stuff about a mile around. Of course, it could be picking up more than kids\rquote 
 stuff,\rquote  he added in a growl.
\par \lquote And what\rquote s the mirror for?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, that\rquote s my Foe-Glass. See them out there, skulking around? I\rquote m not really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes. That\rquote s when I open my trunk.\rquote 
\par He let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the large trunk under the window. It had seven keyholes in a row. Harry wondered what was in there, until Moody\rquote s next question brought him sharply back to earth.
\par \lquote So ... found out about the dragons, have you?\rquote 
\par Harry hesitated. He\rquote d been afraid of this \endash  but he hadn\rquote t told Cedric, and he certainly wasn\rquote t going to tell Moody, that Hagrid had broken the rules.
\par \lquote It\rquote s all right,\rquote  said Moody, sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with a groan. \lquote Cheating\rquote s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.\rquote 
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t cheat,\rquote  said Harry sharply. \lquote It was \endash  a sort of accident that I found out.\rquote 
\par Moody grinned. \lquote I wasn\rquote t accusing you, laddie. I\rquote ve been telling Dumbledore from the start, he can be as high minded as he likes, but you can bet old Karkaroff and Maxime won\rquote t be. They\rquote 
ll have told their champions everything they can. They want to win. They want to beat Dumbledore. They\rquote d like to prove he\rquote s only human.\rquote 
\par Moody gave a harsh laugh, and his magical eye swivelled around so fast it made Harry feel queasy to watch it.
\par \lquote So ... got any ideas how you\rquote re going to get past your dragon yet?\rquote  said Moody.

\par \lquote Yeah, but ...\rquote  Harry stared at him. \lquote I\rquote m not allowed a broom, I\rquote ve only got my wand \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote My second piece of general advice,\rquote  said Moody loudly, interrupting him, \lquote is to use a nice, simple spell which will enable you to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

\par \lquote Come on, boy ...\rquote  whispered Moody. \lquote Put them together ... it\rquote s not that difficult ...\rquote

\par He wanted to skip Divination to keep practising, but
 Hermione refused point-blank to skive off Arithmancy, and there was no point staying without her. He therefore had to endure over an hour of Professor Trelawney, who spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position of Mars in relation to Saturn a

\par Ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh; he certainly caught Harry\rquote

 wand. He managed to make a fly zoom straight into his hand, though he wasn\rquote t entirely sure that was owing to his prowess at Summoning Charms \endash  perhaps the fly was just stupid.
\par He forced down some dinner after Divination, then returned to the empty classro

Harry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning Charm that evening that some of his blind panic had left him. It returned in full measure, however, on the following morn\-ing. The atmosphere in the school was one of great ten
sion and excitement. Lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the stu\-dents time to get down to the dragons\rquote  enclosure \endash  though of course, they didn\rquote t yet know what they would find there.

g to curse everyone in sight.
\par Time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever, rushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson, History of Magic, and the next, walking into lunch ... and then (where
 had the morning gone? The last of the dragon-free hours?) Professor McGonagall was hurrying over to him in the Great Hall. Lots of people were watching.
\par \lquote Potter, the champions have to come down into the grounds now ... you have to get ready for your first task.\rquote 
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter.
\par \lquote Good luck, Harry,\rquote  Hermione whispered. \lquote You\rquote ll be fine!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, in a voice that was most unlike his own.
\par He left the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall. She didn\rquote t seem herself, either; in fact, she looked nearly as anxious as Hermione. As she walked him down the stone steps and out into the cold November afternoon, she put her hand on his shoulder.

\par \lquote Now, don\rquote t panic,\rquote  she said, \lquote just keep a cool head ... we\rquote 
ve got wizards on hand to control the situation if it gets out of hand ... the main thing is just to do your best, and nobody will think any the worse of you ... are you all right?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  Harry heard himself say. \lquote Yes, I\rquote m fine.\rquote 
\par She was leading him towards the place where the dragons were, around the edge of the Forest, but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible, Harry saw that a tent had been erected, its entrance facing them,
 screening the dragons from view.
\par \lquote You\rquote re to go in here with the other champions,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice, \lquote and wait for your turn, Potter. Mr Bagman is in there ... he\rquote ll be telling you the \endash 
 the procedure ... good luck.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  said Harry, in a flat, distant voice. She left him at the entrance of the tent. Harry went inside.
\par Fleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a low wooden stool. She didn\rquote t look nearly as composed as usual, but rather pale and clammy. Viktor Kru
m looked even surlier than usual, which Harry supposed was his way of showing nerves. Cedric was pacing up and down. When Harry entered, he gave him a small smile, which Harry returned, feeling the muscles in his face working rather hard, as though they h
ad forgotten how to do it.
\par \lquote Harry! Good-oh!\rquote  said Bagman happily, looking around at him. \lquote Come in, come in, make yourself at home!\rquote 
\par Bagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure, standing amid all the pale-faced champions. He was wearing his old Wasp robes again.
\par \lquote Well, now we\rquote re all here \endash  time to fill you in!\rquote  said Bagman brightly. \lquote When the audience has assembled, I\rquote m going to be offering each of you this bag\rquote  \endash 
 he held up a small sack of purple silk, and shook it at them \endash  \lquote from which you will each select a small model of the thing you are about to face! There are different \endash  er \endash 
 varieties, you see. And I have to tell you something else too ... ah, yes ... your task is to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 collect the golden egg!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par Harry glanced around. Cedric had nodded once, to show that he understood Bagman\rquote s words, and then started pacing around the tent again; he looked slightly green. Fleur Delacour and Krum hadn\rquote 
t reacted at all. Perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths; that was certainly how Harry felt. But they, at least, had volunteered for this ...
\par And in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard passing the tent, their owners talking excit\-edly, laughing, joking ... Harry felt as separate from the crowd as if they were a different species. And then \endash 
 it felt about a second later to Harry \endash  Bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sack.
\par \lquote Ladies first,\rquote  he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour.
\par She put a shaking hand inside the bag, and drew out a tiny, perfect model of a dragon \endash  a Welsh Green. It had the number \lquote two\rquote 
 around its neck. And Harry knew, by the fact that Fleur showed no sign of surprise, but rather a determined resigna\-tion, that he had been right: Madame Maxime had told her what was coming.
\par The same held true for Krum. He pulled out the scarlet Chinese Fireball. It had a number \lquote three\rquote  around its neck. He didn\rquote t even blink, just stared at the ground.
\par Cedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the blueish-grey Swedish Short-Snout, the number \lquote one\rquote  tied around its neck. Knowing what was left, Harry put his hand into the silk bag, and pulled out the Hungarian Horntail, and the number 
\lquote four\rquote . It stretched its wings as he looked down at it, and bared its minuscule fangs.
\par \lquote Well, there you are!\rquote  said Bagman. \lquote You have each pulled out the dragon you will face, and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the dragons, do you see? Now, I\rquote 
m going to have to leave you in a moment, because I\rquote m commen\-tating. Mr Diggory, you\rquote re first, just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle, all right? Now ... Harry ... could I have a quick word? Outside?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ... yes,\rquote  said Harry blankly, and he got up and went out of the tent with Bagman, who walked him a short way away, into the trees, and then turned to him with a fatherly expres\-sion on his face.
\par \lquote Feeling all right, Harry? Anything I can get you?\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I \endash  no, nothing.\rquote 
\par \lquote Got a plan?\rquote  said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorial\-ly. \lquote Because I don\rquote t mind sharing a few pointers, if you\rquote d like them, you know. I mean,\rquote  Bagman continued, lowering his voice still further, \lquote 
you\rquote re the underdog here, Harry ... any\-thing I can do to help ...\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, so quickly he knew he had sounded rude, \lquote no \endash  I \endash  I\rquote ve decided what I\rquote m going to do, thanks.\rquote 
\par \lquote Nobody would }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 know, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Harry,\rquote  said Bagman, winking at him.
\par \lquote No, I\rquote m fine,\rquote  said Harry, wondering why he kept telling people this, and wondering whether he had ever been less fine. \lquote I\rquote ve got a plan worked out, I \endash \rquote 
\par A whistle had blown somewhere.
\par \lquote Good Lord, I\rquote ve got to run!\rquote  said Bagman in alarm, and he hurried off.
\par Harry walked back to the tent, and saw Cedric emerging from it, greener than ever. Harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past, but all that came out of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt.
\par Harry went back inside to Fleur and Krum. Seconds later, they heard the roar of the crowd, which meant Cedric had entered the enclosure, and was now face to face with the living counterpart of his model ...
\par It was worse than Harry cou
ld ever have imagined, sitting there and listening. The crowd screamed ... yelled ... gasped like a single many-headed entity, as Cedric did whatever he was doing to get past the Swedish Short-Snout. Krum was still staring at the ground. Fleur had now tak
en to retracing Cedric\rquote s steps, round and round the tent. And Bagman\rquote s commentary made everything much, much worse ... horrible pictures formed in Harry\rquote s mind, as he heard: \lquote Oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow\rquote  ... 
\lquote He\rquote s taking risks, this one!\rquote  ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Clever }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 move 
\endash  pity it didn\rquote t work!\rquote 
\par And then, after about fifteen minutes, Harry heard the deaf\-ening roar that could mean only one thing: Cedric had got past his dragon, and seized the golden egg.
\par \lquote Very good indeed!\rquote  Bagman was shouting. \lquote And now the marks from the judges!\rquote 
\par But he didn\rquote t shout out the marks; Harry supposed the judges were holding them up and showing them to the crowd.
\par \lquote One down, three to go!\rquote  Bagman yelled, as the whistle blew again. \lquote Miss Delacour, if you please!\rquote 
\par Fleur was trembling from head to foot; Harry felt more warmly towards her than he had done so far, as she left the tent with her head held high, and her hand clutching her wand. He and Krum were left alone, at opposite sides of the tent, avoiding each oth
er\rquote s gaze.
\par The same process started again ... \lquote Oh, I\rquote m not sure that was wise!\rquote  they could hear Bagman shouting gleefully. \lquote Oh ... nearly! Careful now ... good Lord, I thought she\rquote d had it then!\rquote 
\par Ten minutes later, Harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once more ... Fleur must have been successful, too. A pause, while Fleur\rquote s marks were being shown ... more clapping ... then, for the third time, the whistle.
\par \lquote And here comes Mr Krum!\rquote  cried Bagman, and Krum slouched out, leaving Harry quite alone.
\par He felt much more aware of his body than usual; very aware of the way his heart was pumping fast, and his fingers tingling with fear ... yet at the same time, he seemed to be outside him\-
self, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far away ...
\par \lquote Very daring!\rquote  Bagman was yelling, and Harry heard the Chinese Fireball emit a horrible, roaring shriek, while the crowd drew its collective breath. \lquote That\rquote s some nerve he\rquote s show\-ing \endash  and \endash  yes, he\rquote 
s got the egg!\rquote 
\par Applause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass; Krum had finished \endash  it would be Harry\rquote s turn at any moment.
\par He stood up, noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallow. He waited. And then he heard the whistle blow. He walked out through the entrance of the tent, 
the panic rising into a crescendo inside him. And now he was walking past the trees, through a gap in the enclosure fence.
\par He saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly coloured dream. There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands which had been mag\-icked there since he\rquote 
d last stood on this spot. And there was the Horntail, at the other end of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of eggs, her wings half furled, her evil, yellow eyes upon him, a monstrous
, scaly black lizard, thrashing her spiked tail, leaving yard-long gouge marks in the hard ground. The crowd was making a great deal of noise, but whether friendly or not, Harry didn\rquote 
t know or care. It was time to do what he had to do ... to focus his mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that was his only chance ...
\par He raised his wand.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Accio Firebolt!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 he shouted.
\par He waited, every fibre of him hoping, praying ... if it hadn\rquote t worked ... if it wasn\rquote t coming ... he seemed to be looking at everything
 around him through some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely ...
\par And then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling towards him around the edge of the woods, soaring into the enclosure, and stop\-
ping dead in mid-air beside him, waiting for him to mount. The crowd was making even more noise ... Bagman was shout\-ing something ... but Harry\rquote s ears were not working properly any more ... listening wasn\rquote t important ...
\par He swung his leg over the broom, and kicked off from the ground. And a second later, something miraculous happened ...
\par As he soared upwards, as the wind rushed through his hair, as the crowd\rquote s faces beca
me mere flesh-coloured pinpricks below, and the Horntail shrank to the size of a dog, he realised that he had left not only the ground behind, but also his fear ... he was back where he belonged ...
\par This was just another Quidditch match, that was all ... just another Quidditch match, and that Horntail was just another ugly opposing team ...
\par He looked down at the clutch of eggs, and spotted the gold one, gleaming against its cement-coloured fellows, residing safely between the dragon\rquote s front legs. \lquote OK,\rquote  Harry told himself, \lquote diversionary tactics ... let\rquote 
s go ...\rquote 
\par He dived. The Horntail\rquote s head followed him; he knew what it was going to do, and pulled out of the dive just in time; a jet of fire had been released exactly where he would have been had he not swerved away ... but Harry didn\rquote 
t care ... that was no more than dodging a Bludger ...
\par \lquote Great Scott, he can fly!\rquote  yelled Bagman, as the crowd shrieked and gasped. \lquote Are you watching this, Mr Krum?\rquote 
\par Harry soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still follow\-ing his progress; its head revolving on its long neck \endash  if he kept this up, it would be nicely dizzy \endash  but better not push it too long, or it would be breathing fire again 
\endash 
\par Harry plummeted just as the Horntail opened its mouth, but this time he was less lucky \endash 
 he missed the flames, but the tail came whipping up to meet him instead, and as he swerved to the left, one of the long spikes grazed his shoulder, ripping his robes \endash 
\par He could feel it stinging, he could hear screaming and groans from the crowd, but the cut didn\rquote t seem to be deep ... now he zoomed around the back of the Horntail, and a possi\-bility occurred to him ...
\par The Horntail didn\rquote t seem to want to take off, she was too protective of her eggs. Though she writhed and twisted, furling and unfurling 
her wings and keeping those fearsome yellow eyes on Harry, she was afraid to move too far from them ... but he had to persuade her to do it, or he\rquote d never get near them ... the trick was to do it carefully, gradually ...
\par He began to fly, first this way, then the other, not near enough to make her breathe fire to stave him off, but still pos\-
ing a sufficient threat to ensure she kept her eyes on him. Her head swayed this way and that, watching him out of those vertical pupils, her fangs bared ...
\par He flew higher. The Horntail\rquote s head rose with him, her neck now stretched to its fullest extent, still swaying, like a snake before its charmer ...
\par Harry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of exasper\-ation. He was like a fly to her, a fly she was longing to
 swat; her tail thrashed again, but he was too high to reach now ... she shot fire into the air, which he dodged ... her jaws opened wide ...
\par \lquote Come on,\rquote  Harry hissed, swerving tantalisingly above her, \lquote come on, come and get me ... up you get, now ...\rquote 
\par And then she reared, spreading her great black leathery wings at last, as wide as those of a small aeroplane \endash 
 and Harry dived. Before the dragon knew what he had done, or where he had disappeared to, he was speeding towards the ground as fast as he could go, towards the eggs now unprotected by her clawed, front legs \endash 
 he had taken his hands off his Firebolt \endash  he had seized the golden egg \endash 
\par And with a huge spurt of speed, he was off, he was soaring out over the stands, the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm, and it was as though somebody had just turned the volume back up \endash 
 for the first time, he became properly aware of the noise of the crowd, which was screaming and applaud\-ing as loudly as the Irish supporters at the World Cup \endash 
\par \lquote Look at that!\rquote  Bagman was yelling. \lquote Will you look at that! Our youngest champion is quickest to get his egg! Well, this is going to shorten the odds on Mr Potter!\rquote 
\par Harry saw the dragon-keepers rushing forwards to subdue the Horntail, and, over at the entrance to the enclosur
e, Professor McGonagall, Professor Moody and Hagrid hurrying to meet him, all of them waving him towards them, their smiles evident even from this distance. He flew back over the stands, the noise of the crowd pounding his eardrums, and came in smoothly t
o land, his heart lighter than it had been in weeks ... he had got through the first task, he had survived ...
\par \lquote That was excellent, Potter!\rquote  cried Professor McGonagall as he got off the Firebolt \endash  which from her was extravagant praise. He noticed that her hand shook as she pointed at his shoulder. \lquote You\rquote 
ll need to see Madam Pomfrey before the judges give out your score ... over there, she\rquote s had to mop up Diggory already ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeh did it, Harry!\rquote  said Hagrid hoarsely. \lquote Yeh did it! An\rquote  agains\rquote  the Horntail an\rquote  all, an\rquote  yeh know Charlie said that was the wors\rquote  \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks, Hagrid,\rquote  said Harry loudly, so that Hagrid wouldn\rquote t blunder on and reveal that he had shown Harry the dragons beforehand.
\par Professor Moody looked very pleased, too; his magical eye was dancing in its socket.
\par \lquote Nice and easy does the trick, Potter,\rquote  he growled.
\par \lquote Right then, Potter, the first-aid tent, please ...\rquote  said Professor McGonagall.
\par Harry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw Madam Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent, look\-ing worried.
\par \lquote Dragons!\rquote  she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling Harry inside. The tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric\rquote s shadow through the canvas, but Cedric didn\rquote 
t seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined Harry\rquote s shoulder, talking furiously all the while. \lquote Last year Dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next? You\rquote 
re very lucky ... this is quite shallow ... it\rquote ll need cleaning before I heal it up, though ...\rquote 
\par She cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid which smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.

And then you can go and get your score.\rquote 
\par She bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say, \lquote How does it feel now, Diggory?\rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t want to sit still; he was still too full of adrena\-line. He got to his feet, wanting to see what was going on out\-side, but before he\rquote d reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside \endash 
 Hermione, followed closely by Ron.
\par \lquote Harry, you were brilliant!\rquote  Hermione said squeakily. There were fingernail marks on her face where she had been clutch\-ing it in fear. \lquote You were amazing! You really were!\rquote 
\par But Harry was looking at Ron, who was very white, and star\-ing at Harry as though he was a ghost.
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  he said, very seriously, \lquote whoever put your name in that Goblet \endash  I \endash  I reckon they\rquote re trying to do you in!\rquote 
\par It was as though the last few weeks had never happened \endash  as though Harry was meeting Ron for the first time, right after he\rquote d been made champion.
\par \lquote Caught on, have you?\rquote  said Harry coldly. \lquote Took you long enough.\rquote 
\par Hermione stood nervously between them, looking from one to the other. Ron opened his mouth uncertainly. Harry knew Ron was about to apologise and, suddenly, he found he didn\rquote t need to hear it.
\par \lquote It\rquote s OK,\rquote  he said, before Ron could get the words out. \lquote Forget it.\rquote

she shouted, stamping her foot on the ground, tears splashing down her front. Then, before either of them could stop her, she had given both of them a hug, and dashed away, now positively howling.
\par \lquote Barking,\rquote  said Ron, shaking his head. \lquote Harry, c\rquote mon, they\rquote ll be putting up your scores ...\rquote 
\par Picking up the golden egg and his Firebolt, feeling more elated than he would have believed possible an hour ago, Harry ducked out of the tent, Ron by his side, talking fast.
\par \lquote You were the best, you know, no competition. C
edric did this weird thing where he Transfigured a rock on the ground ... turned it into a dog ... he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him. Well, it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration, and it sort of worked, because he did get
 the egg, but he got burnt as well \endash 
 the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the labrador, he only just got away. And that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm, I think she was trying to put it into a trance \endash  we
ll, that kind of worked, too, it went all sleepy, but then it snored, and this great jet of flame shot out, and her skirt caught fire \endash  she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand. And Krum \endash  you won\rquote t believe this, but he didn
\rquote t even think of flying! He was probably the best after you, though. Hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye. Only thing is, it went tram\-pling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs \endash  they took marks off for that, he wasn
\rquote t supposed to do any damage to them.\rquote 
\par Ron drew breath as he and Harry reached the edge of the enclosure. Now that the Horntail had been taken away, Harry could see where the five judges were sitting \endash  right at the other end, in raised seats draped in gold.
\par \lquote It\rquote s marks out of ten from each one,\rquote  Ron said, and Harry, squinting up the field, saw the first judge \endash  Madame Maxime \endash  raise her wand in the air. What looked like a long, silver rib\-
bon shot out of it, which twisted itself into a large figure eight.
\par \lquote Not bad!\rquote  said Ron, as the crowd applauded. \lquote I suppose she took marks off for your shoulder ...\rquote 
\par Mr Crouch came next. He shot a number nine into the air.
\par \lquote Looking good!\rquote  Ron yelled, thumping Harry on the back.
\par Next, Dumbledore. He, too, put up a nine. The crowd were cheering harder than ever.
\par Ludo Bagman \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 ten.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

\par \lquote Harry, don\rquote t complain!\rquote  Ron yelled excitedly.
\par And now Karkaroff raised his wand. He paused for a moment, and then a number shot out of his wand, too \endash  four.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote What?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Ron bellowed furiously. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par But Harry didn\rquote t care, he wouldn\rquote t have cared if Karkaroff had given him zero; Ron\rquote s indignation on his behalf was worth about a hundred points to him. He didn\rquote t tell Ron t
his, of course, but his heart felt lighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure. And it wasn\rquote t just Ron ... those weren\rquote 
t only Gryffindors cheering in the crowd. When it had come to it, when they had seen what he was facing, most of the school had been on his side, as well as Cedric\rquote s ... he didn\rquote 
t care about the Slytherins, he could stand whatever they threw at him now.
\par \lquote You\rquote re tied in first place, Harry! You and Krum!\rquote  said Charlie Weasley, hurrying to meet them as they set off back towards the school. \lquote Listen, I\rquote ve got to run, I\rquote ve got to go and send Mum an owl, I swore I
\rquote d tell her what happened \endash  but that was unbelievable! Oh yeah \endash  and they told me to tell you you\rquote ve got to hang around for a few more minutes ... Bagman wants a word, back in the champions\rquote  tent.\rquote 
\par Ron said he would wait, so Harry re-entered the tent, which somehow looked quite different now; friendly and welcoming. He thought back to how he\rquote d felt while dodging the Horntail, and compared it to the long wait before he\rquote d walked out 
to face it ... there was no comparison, the wait had been immeasur\-ably worse.
\par Fleur, Cedric and Krum all came in together.
\par One side of Cedric\rquote s face was covered in a thick orange paste, which was presumably mending his burn. He grinned at Harry when he saw him. \lquote Good one, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote And you,\rquote  said Harry, grinning back.
\par \lquote Well done, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 all}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  of you!\rquote 
 said Ludo Bagman, bouncing into the tent, and looking as pleased as though he personally had just got past a dragon. \lquote Now, just a quick few words. You\rquote ve got a nice lo

\par Harry left the tent, rejoined Ron, and they st
arted to walk back around the edge of the Forest, talking hard; Harry wanted to hear what the other champions had done in more detail. Then, as they rounded the clump of trees behind which Harry had first heard the dragons roar, a witch leapt out from beh
ind them.
\par It was Rita Skeeter. She was wearing acid-green robes today; the Quick-Quotes Quill in her hand blended perfectly against them.
\par \lquote Congratulations, Harry!\rquote  she said, beaming at him. \lquote I won\-der if you could give me a quick word? How you felt facing that dragon? How you feel }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

Harry, Ron and Hermione went up to the Owlery that evening to find Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send Sirius a letter, telling him that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry filled Ron in on everything Sirius had told him ab
out Karkaroff. Though shocked at first to hear that Karkaroff had been a Death Eater, by the time they entered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it all along.

\par Pigwidgeon was so over-excited at the idea of a delivery, he was flying round and round Harry\rquote s head, hooting incessantly. Ron snatched Pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while Harry attached the letter to his leg.
\par \lquote There\rquote s no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous, how could they be?\rquote  Ron went on, as he carried Pigwidgeon to the window. \lquote You know what? I reckon you could win this Tournament, Harry, I\rquote m serious.
\rquote 
\par Harry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up for his behaviour of the last few weeks, but he appreciated it all the same. Hermione, however, leant against the Owlery wall, folded her arms and frowned at Ron.
\par \lquote Harry\rquote s got a long way to go before he finishes this Tournament,\rquote  she said seriously. \lquote If that was the first task, I hate to think what\rquote s coming next.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right little ray of sunshine, aren\rquote t you?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote You and Professor Trelawney should get together some time.\rquote 
\par He threw Pigwidgeon out of the window. Pigwidgeon plum\-meted twelve feet before managing to pull himself back up again; the letter attached to his leg was much longer and heav\-ier than usual \endash  Harry hadn\rquote t been able to resist giving 
Sirius a blow-by-blow account of exactly how he had swerved, circled and dodged the Horntail.
\par They watched Pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness, and then Ron said, \lquote Well, we\rquote d better get downstairs for your surprise party, Harry \endash  Fred and George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now.\rquote 
\par Sure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor common room it exploded with cheers and yells again. There were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and Butterbeer on every surface; Lee Jordan had let off some Dr Filibuster\rquote 
s Fabulous No-Heat, Wet-Start Fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean Thomas, who was very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners, most of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail\rquote 
s head on his Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his head on fire.
\par Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione. He couldn\rquote t believe how happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he\rquote 
d got through the first task, and he would\-n\rquote t have to face the second one for three months.
\par \lquote Blimey, this is heavy,\rquote  said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands. \lquote Open it, Harry, go on! Let\rquote s just see what\rquote s inside it!\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s supposed to work out the clue on his own,\rquote  Hermione said swiftly. \lquote It\rquote s in the Tournament rules ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own, too,\rquote  Harry muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and she grinned rather guiltily.
\par \lquote Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!\rquote  several people echoed.
\par Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it, and prised it open.
\par It was hollow and completely empty \endash  but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick\rquote 
s Deathday Party, who had all been playing the musical saw.
\par \lquote Shut it!\rquote  Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.
\par \lquote What was that?\rquote  said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed it shut again. \lquote Sounded like a banshee ... maybe you\rquote ve got to get past one of those next, Harry!\rquote 
\par \lquote It was someone being tortured!\rquote  said Neville, who had gone very white, and spilled sausage rolls over the floor. \lquote You\rquote re going to have to fight the Cruciatus curse!\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be a prat, Neville, that\rquote s illegal,\rquote  said George. \lquote They wouldn\rquote t use the Cruciatus curse on the champions. I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing ... maybe you\rquote ve got to attack him while he
\rquote s in the shower, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Want a jam tart, Hermione?\rquote  said Fred.
\par Hermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her. Fred grinned.
\par \lquote It\rquote s all right,\rquote  he said. \lquote I haven\rquote t done anything to them. It\rquote s the custard creams you\rquote ve got to watch \endash \rquote 
\par Neville, who had just bitten into a custard cream, choked and spat it out.
\par Fred laughed. \lquote Just my little joke, Neville ...\rquote 
\par Hermione took a jam tart.
\par Then she said, \lquote Did you get all this from the kitchens, Fred?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yep,\rquote  said Fred, grinning at her. He put on a high-pitched squeak and imitated a house-elf. \lquote  \'93Anything we can get you, sir, anything at all!\'94 They\rquote re dead helpful ... get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish.\rquote 

\par \lquote How do you get in there?\rquote  Hermione said, in an innocently casual sort of voice.
\par \lquote Easy,\rquote  said Fred, \lquote concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit. Just tickle the pear, and it giggles and \endash \rquote  He stopped, and looked suspiciously at her. \lquote Why?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  said Hermione quickly.
\par \lquote Going to try and lead the house-elves out on strike now, are you?\rquote  said George. \lquote Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion?\rquote 
\par Several people chortled. Hermione didn\rquote t answer.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you go upsetting them and telling them they\rquote ve got to take clothes and salaries!\rquote  said Fred warningly. \lquote You\rquote ll put them off their cooking!\rquote 
\par Just then, Neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large canary.
\par \lquote Oh \endash  sorry, Neville!\rquote  Fred shouted, over all the laughter. \lquote I forgot \endash  it }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 was}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Within a minute, however, Neville had moulted, and once his feathers had fallen off, he reappeared looking entirely normal. He even joined in laughing.

\par It was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally went up to the dormitory with Ron, Neville, Seamus and Dean. Before he pulled the curtains of his four-poster shu
t, Harry set his tiny model of the Hungarian Horntail on the table next to his bed, where it yawned, curled up and closed its eyes. Really, Harry thought, as he pulled the hangings on his four-poster closed, Hagrid had a point ... they were all right, rea

The start of December brought wind and sleet to Hogwarts. Draughty though the castle always was in winter, Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the high wi
nds, its black sails billowing against the dark skies. He thought the Beauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty chilly, too. Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping Madame Maxime\rquote 
s horses well provided with their preferred drink of single-malt whisky; the fumes 
wafting from the trough in the corner of their paddock were enough to make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class light headed. This was unhelpful, as they were still tending the horrible Skrewts, and needed their wits about them.

\par There were now only ten Skrewts left;
 apparently their desire to kill each other had not been exercised out of them. Each of them was now approaching six feet in length. Their thick grey armour, their powerful, scuttling legs, their fire-blasting ends, their stings and their suckers, combine

\par \lquote We\rquote ll jus\rquote  lead \rquote em in here,\rquote  Hagrid said, \lquote an\rquote  put the lids on, and we\rquote ll see what happens.\rquote

aged to restrain and tie up nine of the Skrewts, though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts; finally, only one Skrewt was left.
\par \lquote Don\rquote  frighten him, now!\rquote  Hagrid shouted, as Ron and Harry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the Skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back. \lquote Jus\rquote  try an

\par \lquote Who\rquote re you?\rquote  Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter, as he slipped a loop of rope around the Skrewt\rquote s sting and tightened it.
\par \lquote Rita Skeeter, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 reporter,\rquote 
 Rita replied, beaming at him. Her gold teeth glinted.
\par \lquote Thought Dumbledore said you weren\rquote  allowed inside the school any more?\rquote  said Hagrid, frowning slightly as he got off the slightly squashed Skrewt and started tugging it over to its fellows.
\par Rita acted as though she hadn\rquote t heard what Hagrid had said.
\par \lquote What are these fascinating creatures called?\rquote  she asked, beaming still more widely.
\par \lquote Blast-Ended Skrewts,\rquote  grunted Hagrid.
\par \lquote Really?\rquote  said Rita, apparently full of lively interest. \lquote I\rquote ve never heard of them before ... where do they come from?\rquote 
\par Harry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of Hagrid\rquote s wild black beard, and his heart sank. Where }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 had }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Hagrid got the Skrewts from?
\par Hermione, who seemed to be thinking along the same lines, said quickly, \lquote They\rquote re very interesting, aren\rquote t they? Aren\rquote t they, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote What? Oh, yeah ... ouch ... interesting,\rquote  said Harry, as she stepped on his foot.
\par \lquote Ah, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 you\rquote re }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 here, Harry!\rquote 
 said Rita Skeeter as she looked around. \lquote So you like Care of Magical Creatures, do you? One of your favourite lessons?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry stoutly. Hagrid beamed at him.
\par \lquote Lovely,\rquote  said Rita. \lquote Really lovely. Been teaching long?\rquote  she added to Hagrid.
\par Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across one cheek), Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several burnt fingers), and then 
to the cabin windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against the glass, waiting to see if the coast was clear.
\par \lquote This is on\rquote y me second year,\rquote  said Hagrid.
\par \lquote Lovely ... I don\rquote t suppose you\rquote d like to give an interview, would you? Share some of your experience of magical crea\-tures? The }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Prophet }{

\par \lquote Blast-Ended Skrewts,\rquote  Hagrid said eagerly. \lquote Er \endash  yeah, why not?\rquote 
\par Harry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of communicating it to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter see\-
ing, so he had to stand and watch in silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that week. Then the bell rang up at the castle, signalling the end of the lesson.
\par \lquote Well, goodbye, Harry!\rquote  Rita Skeeter called merrily to him, as he set off with Ron and Hermione. \lquote Until Friday night, then, Hagrid!\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote ll twist everything he says,\rquote  Harry said under his breath.
\par \lquote Just as long as he didn\rquote t import those Skrewts illegally or anything,\rquote  said Hermione desperately. They looked at each other \endash  it was exactly the sort of thing Hagrid might do.
\par \lquote Hagrid\rquote s been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledore\rquote s never sacked him,\rquote  said Ron consolingly. \lquote Worst that can hap\-pen is Hagrid\rquote ll have to get rid of the Skrewts. Sorry ... did I say worst? I meant best.
\rquote 
\par Harry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to lunch.
\par Harry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon; they were still doing star charts and predictions, but now that he and Ron were friends once more, the whole thing seemed very funny again. Professor Trelawney, who had been so pleased with the pa
ir of them when they had been predicting their own horrific deaths, quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation of the various ways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.

\par \lquote An ugly old bat in outsize specs?\rquote  Ron muttered under his breath.
\par Harry fought hard to keep his face straight.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Death, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 my dears.\rquote 
\par Parvati and Lavender both put their hands over their mouths, looking horrified.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively, \lquote it comes, ever closer, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower ... ever lower over the castle ...\rquote 
\par She stared pointedly at Harry, who yawned very widely and obviously.
\par \lquote It\rquote d be a bit more impressive if she hadn\rquote t done it about eighty times before,\rquote  Harry said, as they finally regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath Professor Trelawney\rquote s room. \lquote But if I\rquote 
d dropped dead every time she\rquote s told me I\rquote m going to, I\rquote d be a medical miracle.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote d be a sort of extra-concentrated ghost,\rquote  said Ron, chortling, as they passed the Bloody Baron going in the opposite direction, his wide eyes staring sinisterly. \lquote At least we didn\rquote 
t get homework. I hope Hermione got loads off Professor Vector, I love not working when she is ...\rquote 
\par But Hermione wasn\rquote t at dinner, and nor was she in the library when they went to look for her afterwards. The only person
 in there was Viktor Krum. Ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while, watching Krum, debating in whispers with Harry whether he should ask for an autograph \endash 
 but then Ron realised that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books, debating exactly the same thing, and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea.
\par \lquote Wonder where she\rquote s got to?\rquote  Ron said, as he and Harry went back to Gryffindor Tower.
\par \lquote Dunno ... Balderdash.\rquote 
\par But the Fat Lady had barely begun to swing forwards, when the sound of racing feet behind them announced Hermione\rquote s arrival.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  she panted, skidding to a halt beside him (the Fat Lady stared down at her, eyebrows raised). \lquote Harry, you\rquote ve got to come \endash  you\rquote ve }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par She seized Harry\rquote s arm and started to try and drag him back along the corridor.
\par \lquote What\rquote s the matter?\rquote  Harry said.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll show you when we get there \endash  oh, come on, quick \endash \rquote 
\par Harry looked around at Ron; he looked back at Harry, intrigued.
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with Hermione, Ron hurrying to keep up.
\par \lquote Oh, don\rquote t mind me!\rquote  the Fat Lady called irritably after them. \lquote Don\rquote t apologise for bothering me! I\rquote ll just hang here, wide open, until you get back, shall I?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, thanks,\rquote  Ron shouted over his shoulder.
\par \lquote Hermione, where are we going?\rquote  Harry asked, after she had led them down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the Entrance Hall.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll see, you\rquote ll see in a minute!\rquote  said Hermione excitedly.
\par She turned left at the bottom of the staircase, and hurried towards the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated his and Harry\rquote 
s names. Harry had never been through here before. He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one which led to Snape\rquote 
s dungeon, they found themselves in a broad, stone corridor, brightly lit with torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food.
\par \lquote Oh, hang on ...\rquote  said Harry slowly, halfway down the corri\-dor. \lquote Wait a minute, Hermione ...\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  She turned around to look at him, anticipation all over her face.
\par \lquote I know what this is about,\rquote  said Harry.
\par He nudged Ron, and pointed to the painting just behind Hermione. It showed a gigantic silver fruit-bowl.
\par \lquote Hermione!\rquote  said Ron, cottoning on. \lquote You\rquote re trying to rope us into that spew stuff again!\rquote 
\par \lquote No, no, I\rquote m not!\rquote  she said hastily. \lquote And it\rquote s not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 spew,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Changed the name, have you?\rquote  said Ron, frowning at her. \lquote What are we now, then, the House-Elf Liberation Front? I\rquote m not barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work, I\rquote m not doing it \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote I\rquote m not asking you to!\rquote  Hermione said impatiently. \lquote I came down here just now, to talk to them all, and I found \endash  oh, come }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 on, }{

\par She seized his arm again, pulled him in front of the picture of the giant fruit-bowl, stretched out her forefinger and tickled the huge green pear. It began to squirm, chuckling, and sud\-
denly turned into a large green door handle. Hermione seized it, pulled the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back, forcing him inside.
\par He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high-ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glitter\-
ing brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled towards him from the middle of the room, squealing, \lquote Harry Potter, sir! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Harry Potter!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.
\par \lquote D-Dobby?\rquote  Harry gasped.
\par \lquote It }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 is}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  Dobby, sir, it is!\rquote  squealed the voice from some\-
where around his navel. \lquote Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!\rquote 
\par Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his enormous, green, tennis-ball-shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness. He looked almost exactly
 as Harry remembered him; the pencil-shaped nose, the bat-like ears, the long fingers and feet \endash  all except the clothes, which were very different.
\par When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase. Now, however, he w
as wearing the strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen; he had made an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the World Cup. He was wearing a tea-cosy for a hat, on which he had pinned a number of bright badges; a tie patterne
d with horseshoes over a bare chest, a pair of what looked like children\rquote 
s football shorts, and odd socks. One of these, Harry saw, was the black one he had removed from his own foot and tricked Mr Malfoy into giving Dobby, thereby setting Dobby free. The other was covered in pink and orange stripes.
\par \lquote Dobby, what\rquote re you doing here?\rquote  Harry said in amazement.
\par \lquote Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts, sir!\rquote  Dobby squealed excitedly. \lquote Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs, sir!\rquote 
\par \lquote Winky?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote She\rquote s here, too?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, sir, yes!\rquote  said Dobby, and he seized Harry\rquote 
s hand, and pulled him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there. Each of these tables, Harry noticed as he passed them, was positioned exactly beneath the four hou
se tables above, in the Great Hall. At the moment, they were clear of food, dinner having finished, but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above.
\par At least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen, beaming, bowing and curtseying as Dobby led Harry past them. They were all wearing the same uniform; a tea-towel stamped with the Hogwarts crest, and tied, as Winky\rquote 
s had been, like a toga.
\par Dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace, and pointed.
\par \lquote Winky, sir!\rquote  he said.
\par Winky was sitting on a stool by the fire. Unlike Dobby, she had obviously not foraged for clothes. She was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a matching blue hat, which had holes in it for her large ears. However, while every one of Dobby\rquote 
s strange collection of garments was so clean and well cared for that it looked brand new, Winky was plainly not taking care of her clothes at all. There were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt.
\par \lquote Hello, Winky,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Winky\rquote s lip quivered. Then she burst into tears, which spilled out of her great brown eyes and splashed down her front, just as they had done at the Quidditch World Cup.
\par \lquote Oh, dear,\rquote  said Hermione. She and Ron had followed Harry and Dobby to the end of the kitchen. \lquote Winky, don\rquote t cry, please don\rquote t ...\rquote 
\par But Winky cried harder than ever. Dobby, on the other hand, beamed up at Harry.
\par \lquote Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea?\rquote  he squeaked loudly, over Winky\rquote s sobs.
\par \lquote Er \endash  yeah, OK,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Instantly, about six house-elves came trotting up behind him, bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot, cups for Harry, Ron and Hermione, a milk jug and a large plate of biscuits.
\par \lquote Good service!\rquote  Ron said, in an impressed voice. Hermione frowned at him, but the elves all looked delighted; they bowed very low and retreated.
\par \lquote How long have you been here, Dobby?\rquote  Harry asked, as Dobby handed round the tea.
\par \lquote Only a week, Harry Potter, sir!\rquote  said Dobby happily. \lquote Dobby came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir. You see, sir, it is very difficult for a house-elf who has been dismissed to get a new position, sir, very difficult indeed \endash 
\rquote 
\par At this, Winky howled even harder, her squashed tomato of a nose dribbling all down her front, though she made no effort to stem the flow.
\par \lquote Dobby has travelled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to find work!\rquote  Dobby squeaked. \lquote But Dobby hasn\rquote t found work, sir, because Dobby wants paying now!\rquote 
\par The house-elves all around the kitchen, who had been listening and watching with interest, all looked away at these words, as though Dobby had said something rude and embarrassing.
\par Hermione, however, said, \lquote Good for you, Dobby!\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you, miss!\rquote  said Dobby, grinning toothily at her. \lquote But most wizards doesn\rquote t want a house-elf who wants paying, miss. \'93That\rquote s not the point of a house-elf,\'94 they says, and they slammed the door in Dobby
\rquote s face! Dobby likes work, but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid, Harry Potter ... Dobby likes being free!\rquote 
\par The Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging away from Dobby, as though he was carrying something contagious. Winky, however, remained where she was, though there was a definite increase in the volume of her crying.
\par \lquote And then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky, and finds out Winky has been freed, too, sir!\rquote  said Dobby delight\-edly.
\par At this, Winky flung herself forwards off her stool, and lay, face down, on the flagged stone floor, beating her tiny fists upon it and positively 
screaming with misery. Hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her, and tried to comfort her, but nothing she said made the slightest difference.
\par Dobby continued with his story, shouting shrilly over Winky\rquote s screeches. \lquote And then Dobby had the idea, Harry Potter, sir! \'93Why doesn\rquote t Dobby and Winky find work together?\'94 Dobby says. \'93
Where is there enough work for two house-elves?\'94 says Winky. And Dobby thinks, and it comes to him, sir! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Hogwarts! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 So Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir, and Professor Dumbledore took us on!\rquote 
\par Dobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled in his eyes again.
\par \lquote And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, sir, if Dobby wants paying! And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month!\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s not very much!\rquote  Hermione shouted indignantly from the floor, over Winky\rquote s continued screaming and fist-beating.
\par \lquote Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends off,\rquote  said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the prospect of so much leisure and riches was frightening, \lquote 
but Dobby beat him down, miss ... Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he isn\rquote t wanting too much, miss, he likes work better.\rquote 
\par \lquote And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 you, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Winky?\rquote 
 Hermione asked kindly.
\par If she had thought this would cheer Winky up, she was wildly mistaken. Winky did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious.
\par \lquote Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting paid!\rquote  she squeaked. \lquote Winky is not sunk so low as that! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed!\rquote 
\par \lquote Ashamed?\rquote  said Hermione blankly. \lquote But \endash  Winky, come on! It\rquote s Mr Crouch who should be ashamed, not you! You didn\rquote t do anything wrong, he was really horrible to you \endash \rquote 
\par But at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat, flattening her ears so that she couldn\rquote t hear a word, and screeched, \lquote You is not insulting my master, miss! You is not insultin
g Mr Crouch! Mr Crouch is a good wizard, miss! Mr Crouch is right to sack bad Winky!\rquote 
\par \lquote Winky is having trouble adjusting, Harry Potter,\rquote  squeaked Dobby confidentially. \lquote Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr Crouch any more; she is allowed to speak her mind now, but she won\rquote t do it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Can\rquote t house-elves speak their minds about their masters, then?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote Oh, no, sir, no,\rquote  said Dobby, looking suddenly serious. \lquote  \rquote Tis part of the house-elf\rquote s enslavement, sir. We keeps their secrets and our silence, sir, we upholds the family\rquote 
s honour, and we never speaks ill of them \endash  though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he does not insist upon this. Professor Dumbledore said we is free to \endash  to \endash \rquote 
\par Dobby looked suddenly nervous, and beckoned Harry closer. Harry bent forwards.
\par Dobby whispered, \lquote He said we is free to call him a \endash  a barmy old codger if we likes, sir!\rquote 
\par Dobby gave a frightened sort of giggle.
\par \lquote But Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter,\rquote  he said, talking normally again, and shaking his head so that his ears flapped. \lquote Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore very much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets for him.\rquote 
\par \lquote But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now?\rquote  Harry asked him, grinning.
\par A slightly fearful look came into Dobby\rquote s immense eyes.
\par \lquote Dobby \endash  Dobby could,\rquote  he said doubtfully. He squared his small shoulders. \lquote Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were \endash  were \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Harry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the table.
\par \lquote Thank you, Harry Potter, thank you,\rquote  said Dobby breathlessly, rubbing his head.
\par \lquote You just need a bit of practice,\rquote  Harry said.
\par \lquote Practice!\rquote  squealed Winky furiously. \lquote You is ought to be ashamed of yourself, Dobby, talking that way about your mas\-ters!\rquote

\par \lquote You is seeing my master?\rquote  said Winky breathlessly, raising her tear-stained face out of her skirt once more, and goggling at Hermione. \lquote You is seeing him here at Hogwarts?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote He and Mr Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament.\rquote 
\par \lquote Mr Bagman comes, too?\rquote  squeaked Winky, and to Harry\rquote s great surprise (and Ron and Hermione\rquote s, too, by the looks on their faces), she looked angry again. \lquote Mr Bagman is a bad wizard! A very bad wizard! My master isn

\par She dissolved yet again in tears; they could hear her sobbing into her skirt, \lquote Poor master, poor master, no Winky to help him no more!\rquote 
\par They couldn\rquote t get another sensible word out of Winky. They left her to her crying, and finished their tea, while Dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf, and his plans for his wages.
\par \lquote Dobby is going to buy a jumper next, Harry Potter!\rquote  he said happily, pointing at his bare chest.
\par \lquote Tell you what, Dobby,\rquote  said Ron, who seemed to have taken a great liking to the elf, \lquote I\rquote ll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas, I always get one from her. You don\rquote t mind maroon, do you?\rquote 
\par Dobby was delighted.
\par \lquote We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you,\rquote  Ron told him, \lquote but it\rquote ll go well with your tea-cosy.\rquote 
\par As they prepared to take their leave, many of the surround\-ing elves pressed in upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs. Hermione refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and cu
rtseying, but Harry and Ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies.
\par \lquote Thanks a lot!\rquote  Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered around the door to say goodnight. \lquote See you, Dobby!\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry Potter ... can Dobby come and see you sometimes, sir?\rquote  Dobby asked tentatively.
\par \lquote  \rquote Course you can,\rquote  said Harry, and Dobby beamed.
\par \lquote You know what?\rquote  said Ron, once he, Hermione and Harry had left the kitchens behind, and were climbing the steps into the Entrance Hall again. \lquote All these years I\rquote ve been really imp
ressed with Fred and George, nicking food from the kitchens \endash  well, it\rquote s not exactly difficult, is it? They can\rquote t wait to give it away!\rquote 
\par \lquote I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves, you know,\rquote  said Hermione, leading the way back up the marble staircase. \lquote 
Dobby coming to work here, I mean. The other elves will see how happy he is, being free, and slowly it\rquote ll dawn on them that they want that, too!\rquote 
\par \lquote Let\rquote s hope they don\rquote t look too closely at Winky,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Oh, she\rquote ll cheer up,\rquote  said Hermione, though she sounded a bit doubtful. \lquote Once the shock\rquote s worn off, and she\rquote s got used to Hogwarts, she\rquote ll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man.\rquote 

\par \lquote She seems to love him,\rquote  said Ron thickly (he had just started on a cream cake).
\par \lquote Doesn\rquote t think much of Bagman, though, does she?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Wonder what Crouch says at home about him?\rquote 
\par \lquote Probably says he\rquote s not a very good Head of Department,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote and let\rquote s face it ... he\rquote s got a point, hasn\rquote t he?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote d still rather work for him than old Crouch,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote At least Bagman\rquote s got a sense of humour.\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t let Percy hear you saying that,\rquote  Hermione said, smiling slightly.
\par \lquote Yeah, well, Percy wouldn\rquote t want to work for anyone with a sense of humour, would he?\rquote  said Ron, now starting on a chocolate \'e9clair. \lquote Percy wouldn\rquote t recognise a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby

). The bell was due to ring at any moment, and Harry and Ron, who had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George\rquote s fake wands at the back of the class, looked up, Ron now holding a tin parrot, and Harry, a rubber haddock.

\par Lavender Brown let out a shrill giggle. Parvati Patil nudged her hard in the ribs, her face working furiously as she, too, fought not to giggle. They both looked around at Harry. Professor McGonagal

\par Lavender giggled harder than ever, with her hand pressed hard agains

A week ago, Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail. But now that he had done the latter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball, he thought he\rquote

Harry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas; he always did, of course, because the alternative was usually going back to Privet Drive, but he had always been very much in the minori\-
ty before now. This year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with the coming ball \endash  or, at 
least, all the girls were, and it was amazing how many girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite noticed that before. Girls giggling and whispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly compa
ring notes on what they were going to wear on Christmas night ...
\par \lquote Why do they have to move in packs?\rquote  Harry asked Ron, as a dozen or so girls walked past them, sniggering and staring at Harry. \lquote How\rquote re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?\rquote 
\par \lquote Lasso one?\rquote  Ron suggested. \lquote Got any idea who you\rquote re going to try?\rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t answer. He knew perfectly well whom he\rquote d }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 like }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
to ask, but working up the nerve was something else ... Cho was a year older than he was; she was very pretty; she was a very good Quidditch player, and she was also very popular.
\par Ron seemed to know what was going on inside Harry\rquote s head.
\par \lquote Listen, you\rquote re not going to have any trouble. You\rquote re a cham\-pion. You\rquote ve just beaten a Hungarian Horntail. I bet they\rquote ll be queuing up to go with you.\rquote 
\par In tribute to their recently repaired friendship, Ron had kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum. Moreover, to Harry\rquote s amazement, he turned out to be quite right.
\par A curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom Harry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day. Harry was so taken aback he said \lquote no\rquote  before he\rquote 
d even stopped to consider the matter. The girl walked off looking rather hurt, and Harry had to endure Dean\rquote s, Seamus\rquote s and Ron\rquote s taunts about
 her all through History of Magic. The following day, two more girls asked him, a second-year and (to his horror) a fifth-year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused.
\par \lquote She was quite good-looking,\rquote  said Ron fairly, after he\rquote d stopped laughing.
\par \lquote She was a foot taller than me,\rquote  said Harry, still unnerved. \lquote Imagine what I\rquote d look like trying to dance with her.\rquote 
\par Hermione\rquote s words about Krum kept coming back to him. \lquote They only like him because he\rquote s famous!\rquote  Harry doubted very much if any of the 
girls who had asked to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with him if he hadn\rquote t been school champion. Then he wondered if this would bother him if Cho asked him.
\par On the whole, Harry had to admit that even with the embar\-rassing prospect of opening the ball before him, life had defi\-nitely improved since he had got through the first task. He wasn\rquote t attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corri\-
dors any more, which he suspected had a lot to do with Cedric \endash  he had an idea Cedric might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave Harry alone, in gratitude for Harry\rquote s tip-off about the dragons. There seemed to be fewer }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39

\rquote s article at him at every possible opportunity, but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it \endash  and just to heighten Harry\rquote s feeling of well-being, no story about Hagrid had appeared in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Daily Prophet.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par \lquote She didn\rquote  seem very int\rquote rested in magical creatures, ter tell yeh the truth,\rquote  Hagrid said, when Harry, Ron and Hermione asked him how his interview with Rita Skeeter had gone dur\-
ing the last Care of Magical Creatures lesson of term. To their very great relief, Hagrid had given up on direct contact with the Skrewts now, and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today, sitting at a trestle table and preparing a fresh selec\-
tion of food with which to tempt the Skrewts.
\par \lquote She jus\rquote  wanted me ter talk about you, Harry,\rquote  Hagrid con\-tinued in a low voice. \lquote Well, I told her we\rquote d been friends since I went ter fetch yeh from the Dursleys. \'93Never had to tell him off in four years?\'94
 she said. \'93Never played you up in lessons, has he?\'94 I told her no, an\rquote  she didn\rquote  seem happy at all. Yeh\rquote d think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote  \rquote Course she did,\rquote  said Harry, throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more. \lquote She can\rquote t keep writing about what a tragic little hero I am, it\rquote ll get boring.
\rquote 
\par \lquote She wants a new angle, Hagrid,\rquote  said Ron wisely, as he shelled salamander eggs. \lquote You were supposed to say Harry\rquote s a mad delinquent!\rquote 
\par \lquote But he\rquote s not!\rquote  said Hagrid, looking genuinely shocked.
\par \lquote She should\rquote ve interviewed Snape,\rquote  said Harry grimly. \lquote He\rquote d give her the goods on me any day. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

\par \lquote Cheers, Hagrid,\rquote  said Harry, grinning.
\par \lquote You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, Hagrid?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Though\rquote  I might look in on it, yeah,\rquote  said Hagrid gruffly. \lquote Should be a good do, I reckon. You\rquote ll be openin\rquote  the dancin\rquote , won\rquote  yeh, Harry? Who\rquote re you takin\rquote ?\rquote 
\par \lquote No one, yet,\rquote  said Harry, feeling himself going red again. Hagrid didn\rquote t pursue the subject.
\par The last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed. Rumours about the Yule Ball were flying every\-where, though Harry didn\rquote t believe half of them \endash 
 for instance, that Dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from Madam Rosmerta. It seemed to be fact, however, that he had booked the Weird Sisters. Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were Harry didn\rquote t kno
w, never having had access to a wizard\rquote s wireless, but he deduced from the wild excite\-ment of those who had grown up listening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network) that they were a very famous musical group.
\par Some of the teachers, like little Professor 
Flitwick, gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play games in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent most of it talking to Harry about the perfect Summoning Charm he had used during the first task of 
the Triwizard Tournament. Other teachers were not so gener\-ous. Nothing would ever deflect Professor Binns, for example, from ploughing on through his notes on goblin rebellions \endash  as Binns hadn\rquote 
t let his own death stand in the way of continuing to teach, they supposed a small thing like Christmas wasn\rquote t going to put him off. It was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percy\rquote 
s cauldron-bottom report. Professors McGonagall and Moody kept them working until the very 
last second of their classes, too, and Snape, of course, would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt Harry. Staring nastily around at them all, he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the te
rm.
\par \lquote Evil, he is,\rquote  Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room. \lquote Springing a test on us on the last day. Ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of revision.\rquote 
\par \lquote Mmm ... you\rquote re not exactly straining yourself, though, are you?\rquote  said Hermione, looking at him over the top of her Potions notes. Ron was busy building a card castle out of his Exploding Snap pack \endash 
 a much more interesting pastime than with Muggle cards, because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at any second.
\par \lquote It\rquote s Christmas, Hermione,\rquote  said Harry lazily; he was re\-reading }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Flying with the Cannons }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire.
\par Hermione looked severely over at him, too. \lquote I\rquote d have thought you\rquote d be doing something constructive, Harry, even if you don\rquote t want to learn your antidotes!\rquote 
\par \lquote Like what?\rquote  Harry said, as he watched Joey Jenkins of the Cannons belt a Bludger towards a Ballycastle Bats Chaser.
\par \lquote That egg!\rquote  Hermione hissed.
\par \lquote Come on, Hermione, I\rquote ve got \rquote til February the twenty-fourth,\rquote  Harry said.
\par He had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk, and hadn\rquote t opened it since the celebration party after the first task. There were still two and a half months to go until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant, after all.
\par \lquote But it might take weeks to work it out!\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote You\rquote re going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you don\rquote t!\rquote 
\par \lquote Leave him alone, Hermione, he\rquote s earned a bit of a break,\rquote  said Ron, and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing his eyebrows.
\par \lquote Nice look, Ron ... go well with your dress robes, that will.\rquote 
\par It was Fred and George. They sat down at the table with Harry, Ron and Hermione as Ron felt how much damage had been done.
\par \lquote Ron, can we borrow Pigwidgeon?\rquote  George asked.
\par \lquote No, he\rquote s off delivering a letter,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Why?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because George wants to invite him to the ball,\rquote  said Fred sarcastically.
\par \lquote Because }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 we }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 want to send a letter, you stupid great prat,\rquote 
 said George.
\par \lquote Who d\rquote you two keep writing to, eh?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Nose out, Ron, or I\rquote ll burn that for you, too,\rquote  said Fred, wav\-ing his wand threateningly. \lquote So ... you lot got dates for the ball yet?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nope,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Well, you\rquote d better hurry up, mate, or all the good ones will be gone,\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote Who\rquote re you going with, then?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Angelina,\rquote  said Fred promptly, without a trace of embarrass\-ment.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Ron, taken aback. \lquote You\rquote ve already asked her?\rquote 
\par \lquote Good point,\rquote  said Fred. He turned his head and called across the common room, \lquote Oi! Angelina!\rquote 
\par Angelina, who had been chatting to Alicia Spinnet near the fire, looked over at him.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  she called back.
\par \lquote Want to come to the ball with me?\rquote 
\par Angelina gave Fred an appraising sort of look.
\par \lquote All right, then,\rquote  she said, and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting, with a bit of a grin on her face.
\par \lquote There you go,\rquote  said Fred to Harry and Ron, \lquote piece of cake.\rquote 
\par He got to his feet, yawning, and said, \lquote We\rquote d better use a school owl then, George, come on ...\rquote 
\par They left. Ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smouldering wreck of his card castle at Harry.

The Hogwarts staff, demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, seemed determined to show the castle at its best this Christmas. When the decorations went up, Harry noticed that they were the most stunning he 
had yet seen inside the school. Everlasting icicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase; the usual twelve Christmas trees in the Great Hall were bedecked with everything from luminous holly berries to real, hooting, golden owls, and
 the suits of armour had all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them. It was quite something to hear \lquote Oh Come, All Ye Faithful\rquote 
 sung by an empty helmet that only knew half the words. Several times, Filch the caretaker had to extract Peeves
 from inside the armour, where he had taken to hiding, filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own invention, all of which were very rude.

t asked Cho to the ball. He and Ron were getting very nervous now, though as Harry pointed out, Ron would look much less stupid than he would without a partner; Harry was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other champions.
\par \lquote I suppose there\rquote s always Moaning Myrtle,\rquote  he said gloomily, referring to the ghost who haunted the girls\rquote  toilets on the sec\-ond floor.
\par \lquote Harry \endash  we\rquote ve just got to grit our teeth and do it,\rquote  said Ron on Friday morning, in a tone that suggested they were plan\-ning the storming of an impregnable fortress. \lquote When we get back to the common room tonight, we
\rquote ll both have partners \endash  agreed?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ... OK,\rquote  said Harry.
\par But every time he glimpsed Cho that day \endash  during break, and then lunchtime, and once on the way to History of Magic \endash  she was surrounded by friends. Didn\rquote t she }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 ever }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 go anywhere alone? Could he perhaps ambush her as she was going into a bathroom? But no \endash 
 she even seemed to go there with an escort of four or five girls. Yet if he didn\rquote t do it soon, she was bound to have been asked by somebody else.
\par He found it hard to concentrate in Snape\rquote s Antidote test, and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient \endash  a bezoar \endash  meaning that he received bottom marks. He didn\rquote 
t care though; he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do. When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and hur\-ried to the dungeon door.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll meet you at dinner,\rquote  he said to Ron and Hermione, and he dashed off upstairs.
\par He\rquote d just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was all ... he hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her, and (rather sooner than he had expected) he found her, emerg\-ing from a Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson.
\par \lquote Er \endash  Cho? Could I have a word with you?\rquote 
\par Giggling should be made illegal, Harry thought furiously, as all the girls around Cho started doing it. She didn\rquote t, though. She said, \lquote OK\rquote , and followed him out of earshot of her class\-mates.
\par Harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs.
\par \lquote Er,\rquote  he said.
\par He couldn\rquote t ask her. He couldn\rquote t. But he had to. Cho stood there looking puzzled, watching him.
\par The words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around them.
\par \lquote Wangoballwime?\rquote 
\par \lquote Sorry?\rquote  said Cho.
\par \lquote D\rquote you \endash  d\rquote you want to go to the ball with me?\rquote  said Harry. Why did he have to go red now? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Why?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par \lquote Oh!\rquote  said Cho, and she went red, too. \lquote Oh, Harry, I\rquote m really sorry,\rquote  and she looked it, too. \lquote I\rquote ve already said I\rquote ll go with someone else.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Harry.
\par It was odd; a moment before, his insides had been writhing like snakes, but suddenly he didn\rquote t seem to have any insides at all.
\par \lquote Oh, OK,\rquote  he said, \lquote no problem.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m really sorry,\rquote  she said again.
\par \lquote That\rquote s OK,\rquote  said Harry.
\par They stood there looking at each other, and then Cho said, \lquote Well \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well, bye,\rquote  said Cho, still very red. She walked away.
\par Harry called after her, before he could stop himself.
\par \lquote Who\rquote re you going with?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh \endash  Cedric,\rquote  she said. \lquote Cedric Diggory.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, right,\rquote  said Harry.
\par His insides had come back again. It felt as though they had been filled with lead in their absence.
\par Completely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly back up to Gryffindor Tower, Cho\rquote s voice echoing in his ears with every step he took. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Cedric

handsome, and popular, and nearly everyone\rquote s favourite champion. Now he suddenly realised that Cedric was in fact a useless pretty-boy who didn\rquote t have enough brains to fill an eggcup.
\par \lquote Fairy lights,\rquote  he said dully to the Fat Lady \endash  the password had been changed the previous day.
\par \lquote Yes, indeed, dear!\rquote  she trilled, straightening her new tinsel hairband as she swung forwards to admit him.
\par Entering the common room, Harry looked around, and to his surprise he saw Ron sitting ashen faced in a distant corner. Ginny was sitting with him, talking to him in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice.
\par \lquote What\rquote s up, Ron?\rquote  said Harry, joining them.
\par Ron looked up at Harry, a sort of blind horror in his face.
\par \lquote Why did I do it?\rquote  he said wildly. \lquote I don\rquote t know what made me do it!\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote He \endash  er \endash  just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him,\rquote  said Ginny. She looked as though she was fighting back a smile, but she kept patting Ron\rquote s arm sympathetically.
\par \lquote You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 what?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 said Harry.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know what made me do it!\rquote  Ron gasped again. \lquote What was I playing at? There were people \endash  all around \endash  I\rquote ve gone mad \endash  everyone watching! I was just walking past her in the Entrance Hall 
\endash  she was standing there talking to Diggory \endash  and it sort of came over me \endash  and I asked her!\rquote 
\par Ron moaned and put his face in his hands. He kept talking, though the words were barely distinguishable. \lquote She looked at me like I was a sea slug or something. Didn\rquote t even answer. And then \endash  I dunno \endash 
 I just sort of came to my senses and ran for it.\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s part Veela,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote You were right \endash  her grandmother was one. It wasn\rquote t your fault, I bet you just walked past when she was turning on the old charm for Diggory and got a blast of it \endash 
 but she was wasting her time. He\rquote s going with Cho Chang.\rquote 
\par Ron looked up.
\par \lquote I asked her to go with me just now,\rquote  Harry said dully, \lquote and she told me.\rquote 
\par Ginny had suddenly stopped smiling.
\par \lquote This is mad,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote we\rquote re the only ones left who haven\rquote t got anyone \endash  well, except Neville. Hey \endash  guess who he asked? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Yeah, I know!\rquote  said Ron, some of the colour coming back into his face as he started to laugh. \lquote He told me after Potions! Said she\rquote s always been really nice, helping him out with work and stuff \endash 
 but she told him she was already going with some\-one. Ha! As if! She just didn\rquote t want to go with Neville ... I mean, who would?\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t!\rquote  said Ginny, annoyed. \lquote Don\rquote t laugh \endash \rquote 
\par Just then Hermione climbed in through the portrait hole.
\par \lquote Why weren\rquote t you two at dinner?\rquote  she said, coming over to join them.
\par \lquote Because \endash  oh, shut up laughing, you two \endash  because they\rquote ve both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball!\rquote  said Ginny.
\par That shut Harry and Ron up.
\par \lquote Thanks a bunch, Ginny,\rquote  said Ron sourly.
\par \lquote All the good-looking ones taken, Ron?\rquote  said Hermione loftily. \lquote Eloise Midgen starting to look quite pretty now, is she? Well, I\rquote m sure you\rquote ll find someone }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Ron goggled at Harry.
\par \lquote What\rquote s got into them?\rquote  he demanded.
\par But Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender come in through the portrait hole. The time had come for drastic action.
\par \lquote Wait here,\rquote  he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to Parvati and said, \lquote Parvati? Will you go to the ball with me?\rquote 
\par Parvati went into a fit of giggles. Harry waited for them to subside, his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes.
\par \lquote Yes, all right, then,\rquote  she said finally, blushing furiously.
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  said Harry, in relief. \lquote Lavender \endash  will you go with Ron?\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s going with Seamus,\rquote  said Parvati, and the pair of them giggled harder than ever.
\par Harry sighed.
\par \lquote Can\rquote t you think of anyone who\rquote d go with Ron?\rquote  he said, lowering his voice so that Ron wouldn\rquote t hear.
\par \lquote What about Hermione Granger?\rquote  said Parvati.
\par \lquote She\rquote s going with someone else.\rquote 
\par Parvati looked astonished.

\par \lquote Yeah, that would be great,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Let me know, will you?\rquote

Despite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth-years had been given for the holidays, Harry was in no mood to work when term ended, and spent the week leading up to Christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with everyone else. Gryffin
d
or Tower was hardly less crowded now than during term-time; it seemed to have shrunk slightly, too, as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual. Fred and George had had a great success with their Canary Creams, and for the first couple of day
s
 of the holidays, people kept bursting into feather all over the place. Before long, however, all the Gryffindors had learnt to treat food anybody else offered them with extreme caution, in case it had a Canary Cream concealed in the centre, and George co
nfided to Harry that he and Fred were now working on developing something else. Harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from Fred and George in future. He still hadn\rquote t forgotten Dudley and the Ton-Tongue Toffee.

upon the castle and its grounds now. The pale blue Beauxbatons carriage looked like a large, chilly, frosted pumpkin next to the iced gingerbread house that was Hagrid\rquote s cabin, while the Durmstrang ship\rquote 
s portholes were glazed with ice, the rigging white w

\par \lquote It is too \rquote eavy, all zis \rquote Ogwarts food,\rquote  they heard her saying grumpily, as they left the Great Hall behind her one evening (Ron skulking behind Harry, keen not to be spotted by Fleur). \lquote

\par \lquote Hermione \endash  who are you going to the ball with?\rquote  said Ron.
\par He kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it. However, Hermione merely frowned and said, \lquote I\rquote m not telling you, you\rquote ll just make fun of me.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re joking, Weasley?\rquote  said Malfoy, behind them. \lquote You\rquote re not telling me someone\rquote s asked }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39

\par Malfoy went pale and jumped backwards, looking wildly around for Moody, but he was still up at the staff table, finish\-ing his stew.
\par \lquote Twitchy little ferret, aren\rquote t you, Malfoy?\rquote  said Hermione scathingly, and she, Harry and Ron went up the marble stair\-case laughing heartily.

\par \lquote Well ... when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get them shrunk, she held up a mirror, and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally were,\rquote  she said. \lquote And I just ... let her carry on a bit.\rquote 
 She smiled even more widely. \lquote Mum and Dad won\rquote t be too pleased. I\rquote ve been trying to per\-suade them to let me shrink them for ages, but they wanted me to carry on with my brace. You know, they\rquote re dentists, they just don

\par Ron\rquote s tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the icicle-laden banisters, a scroll of parchment tied to his leg. People passing him were pointing and laughing, and a group of third-year girls paused and said, \lquote

\par Pigwidgeon hooted happily, his head protruding over Ron\rquote s fist. The third-year girls all looked very shocked.

Harry awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day. Wondering what had caused his abrupt return to consciousness, he opened his eyes, and saw something with very large, round, green eyes staring back at him in the darkness, so close they were almost nose to nose.

\par \lquote Dobby is sorry, sir!\rquote  squeaked Dobby anxiously, jumping backwards with his long fingers over his mouth. \lquote Dobby is only wanting to wish Harry Potter \'93Merry Christmas\'94
 and bring him a present, sir! Harry Potter did say Dobby could come and see him sometimes, sir!\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s OK,\rquote  said Harry, still breathing rather faster than usual, while his heart rate returned to normal. \lquote Just \endash  just prod me or something in future, all right, don\rquote t bend over me like that ...\rquote 
\par Harry pulled back the hangings around his four-poster, took his glasses from his bedside table and put them on. His yell had awoken Ron, Seamus, Dean and Neville. All of them were peering through the gaps
 in their own hangings, heavy eyed and tousle haired.
\par \lquote Someone attacking you, Harry?\rquote  Seamus asked sleepily.
\par \lquote No, it\rquote s just Dobby,\rquote  Harry muttered. \lquote Go back to sleep.\rquote 
\par \lquote Nah ... presents!\rquote  said Seamus, spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed. Ron, De
an and Neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some present-opening, too. Harry turned back to Dobby, who was now standing nervously next to Harry\rquote 
s bed, still looking worried that he had upset Harry. There was a Christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea-cosy.
\par \lquote Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present?\rquote  he squeaked ten\-tatively.
\par \lquote  \rquote Course you can,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Er ... I\rquote ve got something for you, too.\rquote 
\par It was a lie; he hadn\rquote t bought anything for Dobby at all, but he q
uickly opened his trunk, and pulled out a particularly knobbly rolled-up pair of socks. They were his oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had once belonged to Uncle Vernon. The reason they were extra knobbly was that Harry had been using them to cushi
on his Sneakoscope for over a year now. He pulled out the Sneakoscope and handed the socks to Dobby, saying, \lquote Sorry, I forgot to wrap them ...\rquote 
\par But Dobby was utterly delighted.
\par \lquote Socks are Dobby\rquote s favourite, favourite clothes, sir!\rquote  he said, ripping off his odd ones and pulling on Uncle Vernon\rquote s. \lquote I has seven now, sir ... but, sir ...\rquote 
 he said, his eyes widening, having pulled both socks up to their highest extent, so that they reached to the bottom of his shorts, \lquote they has made a mistake in the shop, Harry Potter, they is giving you two the same!\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, no, Harry, how come you didn\rquote t spot that!\rquote  said Ron, grin\-ning over from his own bed, which was now strewn with wrap\-ping paper. \lquote Tell you what, Dobby \endash  here you go \endash 
 take these two, and you can mix them up properly. And here\rquote s your jumper.\rquote 
\par He threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped, and the hand-knitted sweater Mrs Weasley had sent.
\par Dobby looked quite overwhelmed. \lquote Sir is very kind!\rquote  he squeaked, his eyes brimming with tears again, bowing deeply to Ron. \lquote Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard, for he is Harry Potter\rquote 
s greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote re only socks,\rquote  said Ron, who had gone slightly pink around the ears, though looking rather pleased all the same. \lquote Wow, Harry \endash \rquote  he had just opened Harry\rquote s present, a Chudley Cannon hat. \lquote Cool!
\rquote  He jammed it onto his head, where it clashed horribly with his hair.
\par Dobby now handed Harry a small package, which turned out to be \endash  socks.
\par \lquote Dobby is making them himself, sir!\rquote  the elf said happily. \lquote He is buying the wool out of his wages, sir!\rquote 
\par The left sock was bright red, and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it; the right sock was green, with a pattern of Snitches.
\par \lquote They\rquote re ... they\rquote re really ... well, thanks, Dobby,\rquote  said Harry, and he pulled them on, causing Dobby\rquote s eyes to leak with hap\-piness again.
\par \lquote Dobby must go now, sir, we is already making Christmas dinner in the kitchens!\rquote  said Dobby, and he hurried out of the dormitory, waving goodbye to Ron and the others as he passed.
\par Harry\rquote s other presents were much more satisfactory than Dobby\rquote s odd socks \endash  with the obvious exception of the Dursleys\rquote , which consisted of a single tissue, an all-time low \endash  Harry supposed they, too, we
re remembering the Ton-Tongue Toffee. Hermione had given Harry a book called }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland; }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Ron, a bulging bag of Dungbombs; Sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot; and Hagrid, a vast box of sweets including all Harry\rquote s favourites \endash 
 Bertie Bott\rquote s Every Flavour Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble\rquote s Best Blowing Gum and Fizzing Whizzbees. There was also, of course, Mrs Weasley\rquote s usual package, including a new jumper (green, with a picture of a dragon on it \endash 
 Harry supposed Charlie had told her all about the Horntail) and a large quantity of home-made mince pies.
\par Harry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common room, and they went down to breakfast together. They spent most of the morning in Gryffindor Tower, where everyone was enjoy\-ing their presents, then returned to the Great Hall for a magnif\-
icent lunch, which included at least a hundred turkeys and Christmas puddings, and large piles of Cribbages Wizarding Crackers.
\par They went out into the grounds in the afternoon; the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle. Hermione chose to watch Harry and the Weasleys\rquote 
 snowball fight rather than join in, and at five o\rquote clock said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball.
\par \lquote What, you need three hours?\rquote  said Ron, looking at her incredulously, and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball, thrown by George, hit him hard on the side of the head. \lquote Who\rquote re you going with?\rquote 
 he yelled after Hermione, but she just waved, and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle.
\par There was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven o\rquote clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others a
bandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs litter\-ing the bottom of her picture.
\par \lquote Lairy fights, that\rquote s the one!\rquote  she giggled when they gave the password, and she swung forwards to let them inside.
\par Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean and Neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them looking very self-conscious, but none as much 
as Ron, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face. There was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he 
used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs. It worked fairly well; at least he was now lace-free, although he hadn\rquote t done a very neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as they set off downstairs.
\par \lquote I still can\rquote t work out how you two got the best-looking girls in the year,\rquote  muttered Dean.
\par \lquote Animal magnetism,\rquote  said Ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of his cuffs.
\par The common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colours instead of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waitin
g for Harry at the foot of the stairs. She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists. Harry was relieved to see that she wasn\rquote t giggling.
\par \lquote You \endash  er \endash  look nice,\rquote  he said awkwardly.
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  she said. \lquote Padma\rquote s going to meet you in the Entrance Hall,\rquote  she added to Ron.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Ron, looking around. \lquote Where\rquote s Hermione?\rquote 
\par Parvati shrugged. \lquote Shall we go down, then, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room. Fred winked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole.
\par The Entrance Hall was packed with students too, all milling around waiting for eight o\rquote clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open. Thos
e people who were meeting partners from different houses were edging through the crowd, trying to find each other. Parvati found her sister Padma and led her over to Harry and Ron.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in robes of bright turquoise. She didn\rquote 
t look too enthusiastic about having Ron as a partner, though; her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and down.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around at the crowd. \lquote Oh, no ...\rquote 
\par He bent his knees slightly to hide behind Harry, because Fleur Delacour was passing, looking stunning in robes of silver-grey satin, and accompanied by the Ravenclaw Quidditch captain, Roger Davies. When they had disappeared, Ron stood str
aight again and stared over the heads of the crowd.
\par \lquote Where }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Hermione?\rquote  he said again.
\par A group of Slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room. Malfoy was in front; he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar, which in Harry\rquote s opin\-ion made him look like a vicar. Pansy Parkinson was clutching Malfoy
\rquote s arm, in very frilly robes of pale pink. Crabbe and Goyle were both wearing green; they resembled moss-coloured boulders, and neither of them, Harry was pleased to see, had managed to find a partner.
\par The oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the Durmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff. Krum was at the front of the party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes Harry didn\rquote t know. Over their heads 
he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been trans\-formed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights \endash 
 meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rose bushes that had been conjured there, and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be Father Christmas and his reindeer.
\par Then Professor McGonagall\rquote s voice called, \lquote Champions over here, please!\rquote 
\par Parvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and Harry said \lquote See you in a minute\rquote  to Ron and Padma, and walked forwards, th
e chattering crowd parting to let them through. Professor McGonagall, who was wearing dress robes of red tartan, and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim of her hat, told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else w
e
nt inside; they were to enter the Great Hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down. Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies stationed themselves nearest the doors; Davies looked so stunned by his good fortune in having Fleur for a partner that 
he could hardly take his eyes off her. Cedric and Cho were close to Harry, too; he looked away from them so he wouldn\rquote t have to talk to them. His eyes fell instead on the girl next to Krum. His jaw dropped.
\par It was Hermione.
\par But she didn\rquote t look like Hermione at all. She had done some\-
thing with her hair; it was no longer bushy, but sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head. She was wearing robes made of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she was holding herself differently, somehow \endash 
 or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung over her back. She was also smiling \endash  rather nervously, it was true \endash  but the reduction in the size of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever. Harry c
ouldn\rquote t understand how he hadn\rquote t spotted it before.
\par \lquote Hi, Harry!\rquote  she said. \lquote Hi, Parvati!\rquote 
\par Parvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief. She wasn\rquote t the only one, either; when the doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum\rquote s fan club from the library stalked past, throw\-
ing Hermione looks of deepest loathing. Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn\rquote t seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her. Ron, however, walked right past Hermione without looking at her.
\par Once
 everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor McGonagall told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs, and follow her. They did so, and everyone in the Great Hall applauded as they entered and started walking up towards a large round 
table at the top of the Hall, where the judges were sitting.
\par The walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost, with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling. The house tables had vanished; instead, ther
e were about a hundred smaller, lantern-lit ones, each seating about a dozen people.
\par Harry concentrated on not tripping over his feet. Parvati seemed to be enjoying herself; she was beaming around at everybody, steering Harry so forcefully that he felt as 
though he was a show dog she was putting through its paces. He caught sight of Ron and Padma as he neared the top table. Ron was watching Hermione pass with narrowed eyes. Padma was looking sulky.
\par Dumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table but Karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like Ron\rquote 
s as he watched Krum and Hermione draw nearer. Ludo Bagman, tonight in robes of bright purple with large yellow stars, was clapping as 
enthusiastically as any of the students; and Madame Maxime, who had changed her usual uniform of black satin for a flowing gown of lavender silk, was applauding them politely. But Mr Crouch, Harry suddenly realised, was not there. The fifth seat at the ta
ble was occupied by Percy Weasley.
\par When the champions and their partners reached the table, Percy drew out the empty chair beside him, staring pointedly at Harry. Harry took the hint and sat down next to Percy, who was wearing brand-new, navy-blue dress robes, and an expres\-
sion of great smugness.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve been promoted,\rquote  Percy said, before Harry could even ask, and from his tone, he might have been announcing his election as Supreme Ruler of the Universe. \lquote I\rquote m now Mr Crouch\rquote s personal assistant, and I\rquote 
m here representing him.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why didn\rquote t he come?\rquote  Harry asked. He wasn\rquote t looking for\-ward to being lectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinner.
\par \lquote I\rquote m afraid to say Mr Crouch isn\rquote t well, not well at all. Hasn\rquote t been right since the World Cup. Hardly surprising \endash  overwork. He\rquote s not as young as he was \endash 
 though still quite brilliant, of course, the mind remains as great as it ever was. But the World Cup was a fiasco for the whole Ministry, and then Mr Crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehaviour of that
 house-elf of his, Blinky or whatever she was called. Naturally, he dismissed her immediately afterwards, but \endash  well, as I say, he\rquote s getting on, he needs looking after, and I think he\rquote 
s found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left. And then we had the Tournament to arrange, and the aftermath of the Cup to deal with \endash  that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around \endash  no, poor man, he\rquote 
s having a well-earned, quiet Christmas. I\rquote m just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place.\rquote 
\par Harry wanted very much to ask whether Mr Crouch had stopped calling Percy \lquote Weatherby\rquote  yet, but resisted the tempta\-tion.
\par There was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates, but small menus lying in front of each of them. Harry picked his up uncertainly, and looked around \endash 
 there were no waiters. Dumbledore, however, looked carefully down his own menu, then said very clearly to his plate, \lquote Pork chops!\rquote 
\par And pork chops appeared. Getting the idea, the rest of the table placed their orders with their plates, too. Harry glanced up at Hermione to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining \endash 
 surely it meant plenty of extra work for the house-elves? \endash  but, for once, Hermione didn\rquote t seem to be thinking about S.P.E.W. She was deep in talk with Viktor Krum, and hardly seemed to notice what she was eating.
\par It now occurred to Harry that he had never actually heard Krum speak before, but he was certainly talking now, and very enthusiastically at that.
\par \lquote Vell, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as comfort\-able, I am thinking,\rquote  he was telling Hermione. \lquote Ve have just four floors, and the fires are lit only for magical purposes. But ve have grounds larger even than these 
\endash  though in vinter, ve have very little daylight, so ve are not enjoying them. But in summer ve are flying every day, over the lakes and the moun\-tains \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Now, now, Viktor!\rquote  said Karkaroff, with a laugh that didn\rquote t reach his cold eyes. \lquote Don\rquote t go giving away anything else, now, or your charming friend will know exactly where to find us!\rquote 
\par Dumbledore smiled, his eyes twinkling. \lquote Igor, all this secrecy ... one would almost think you didn\rquote t want visitors.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, Dumbledore,\rquote  said Karkaroff, displaying his yellowing teeth to their fullest extent, \lquote we are all protective of ou
r private domains, are we not? Do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us? Are we not right to be proud that we alone know our school\rquote s secrets, and right to protect them?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts\rquote  secrets, Igor,\rquote  said Dumbledore amicably. \lquote Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong turning on the way to the bath\-
room and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent c
ollection of chamberpots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished. But I must keep an eye out for it. Possibly it is only accessible at five thirty in the morning. Or it may only appear at the quarter moon 
\endash  or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder.\rquote 
\par Harry snorted into his plate of goulash. Percy frowned, but Harry could have sworn Dumbledore had given him a very small wink.
\par Meanwhile Fleur Delacour was criticising the Hogwarts decorations to Roger Davies.
\par \lquote Zis is nothing,\rquote  she said dismissively, looking around at the sparkling walls of the Great Hall. \lquote At ze Palace of Beauxbatons, we \rquote 
ave ice sculptures all around ze Dining Chamber at Chreestmas. Zey do not melt, of course ... zey are like \rquote uge statues of diamond, glittering around ze place. And ze food is seemply superb. And we \rquote ave choirs of wood-nymphs, \rquote

\par Roger Davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his face, and he kept missing his mouth with his fork. Harry had the impression that Davies was too busy staring at Fleur to take in a word she was saying.
\par \lquote Absolutely right,\rquote  he said quickly, slapping his own hand down on the table in imitation of Fleur. \lquote Like }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 that. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Harry looked around the Hall. Hagrid was sitting at one of the other staff tables; he was back in his horrible hairy
 brown suit, and gazing up at the top table. Harry saw him give a small wave and, looking around, saw Madame Maxime return it, her opals glittering in the candlelight.
\par Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name proper\-ly; he kept calling her \lquote Hermy-own\rquote .
\par \lquote Her \endash  my \endash  oh \endash  nee,\rquote  she said, slowly and clearly.
\par \lquote Herm \endash  own \endash  ninny.\rquote 
\par \lquote Close enough,\rquote  she said, catching Harry\rquote s eye and grinning.
\par When all the food had been consumed, Dumbledore stood up and asked the students to do the same. Then, at a wave of hi
s wand, the tables zoomed back along the walls, leaving the floor clear, and then he conjured a raised platform into existence along the right-hand wall. A set of drums, several guitars, a lute, a cello and some bagpipes were set upon it.
\par The Weird Sisters
 now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic applause; they were all extremely hairy, and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn. They picked up their instruments, and Harry, who had been so interested in watching them that
 he had almost forgotten what was coming, suddenly realised that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out, and that the other champions and their partners were standing up.
\par \lquote Come on!\rquote  Parvati hissed. \lquote We\rquote re supposed to dance!\rquote 
\par Harry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up. The Weird Sisters struck up a slow, mournful tune; Harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor, carefully avoiding catching anyone\rquote s eye (he could see Seamus and Dean waving at him and snig\-
gering), and next moment, Parvati had seized his hands, placed one around her waist, and was holding the other tightly in hers.
\par It wasn\rquote 
t as bad as it could have been, Harry thought, revolving slowly on the spot (Parvati was steering). He kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching people, and very soon many of them, too, had come onto the dance floor, so that the champions were no
 longer the centre of attention. Neville and Ginny were dancing nearby \endash  he could see Ginny wincing frequently as Neville trod on her feet \endash 
 and Dumbledore was waltzing with Madame Maxime. He was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat barely tick
led her chin; however, she moved very gracefully for a woman so large. Mad-Eye Moody was doing an extremely ungainly two-step with Professor Sinistra, who was nervously avoiding his wooden leg.
\par \lquote Nice socks, Potter,\rquote  Moody growled as he passed, his magi\-cal eye staring through Harry\rquote s robes.
\par \lquote Oh \endash  yeah, Dobby the house-elf knitted them for me,\rquote  said Harry, grinning.
\par \lquote He is so }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 creepy!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  Parvati whispered, as Moody clunked away.

\par Harry heard the final, quavering note from the bagpipe with relief. The Weird Sisters stopped playing, applause filled the Hall once more, and Harry let go of Parvati at once. \lquote Let\rquote s sit down, shall we?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh \endash  but \endash  this is a really good one!\rquote  Parvati said, as the Weird Sisters struck up a new song, which was much faster.
\par \lquote No, I don\rquote t like it,\rquote  Harry lied, and he led her away from the dance floor, past Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so exuberantly that people around them were backing away for fear of injury, and over to the table where Ron 
and Padma were sitting.
\par \lquote How\rquote s it going?\rquote  Harry asked Ron, sitting down and opening a bottle of Butterbeer.
\par Ron didn\rquote t answer. He was glaring at Hermione and Krum, who were dancing nearby. Padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed, one foot jiggling
 in time to the music. Every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at Ron, who was completely ignoring her. Parvati sat down on Harry\rquote s other side, crossed her arms and legs too, and within minutes, was asked to dance by a boy from Beauxbatons.

\par \lquote You don\rquote t mind, do you, Harry?\rquote  Parvati said.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry, who was now watching Cho and Cedric.
\par \lquote Oh, never mind,\rquote  snapped Parvati, and she went off with the boy from Beauxbatons. When the song ended, she did not return.
\par Hermione came over and sat down in Parvati\rquote s empty chair. She was a bit pink in the face from dancing.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  said Harry. Ron didn\rquote t say anything.
\par \lquote It\rquote s hot, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Hermione, fanning herself with her hand. \lquote Viktor\rquote s just gone to get some drinks.\rquote

\par \lquote Yeah, well \endash  that\rquote s his story,\rquote  said Ron nastily.
\par \lquote And what\rquote s that supposed to mean?\rquote

\par Hermione looked as though Ron had slapped her. When she spoke, her voice quivered. \lquote For your information, he hasn\rquote t asked me }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 one single thing }{

Hermione jumped to her feet, and stormed off across the dance floor, disappearing into the crowd.
\par Ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his face.
\par \lquote Are you going to ask me to dance at all?\rquote  Padma asked him.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Ron, still glaring after Hermione.
\par \lquote Fine,\rquote  snapped Padma, and she got up and went to join Parvati and the Beauxbatons boy, who conjured up one of his friends to join them so fast that Harry could have sworn he had zoomed him there by a Summoning Charm.
\par \lquote Vare is Herm-own-ninny?\rquote  said a voice.
\par Krum had just arrived at their table clutching two Butterbeers.
\par \lquote No idea,\rquote  said Ron mulishly, looking up at him. \lquote Lost her, have you?\rquote 
\par Krum was looking surly again.
\par \lquote Vell, if you see her, tell her I haff drinks,\rquote  he said, and he slouched off.
\par \lquote Made friends with Viktor Krum, have you, Ron?\rquote 
\par Percy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together and looking extremely pompous. \lquote Excellent! That\rquote s the whole point, you know \endash  international magical co-operation!\rquote 
\par To Harry\rquote s annoyance, Percy promptly took Padma\rquote s vacated seat. The top table was now empty; Professor Dumbledore was dancing
 with Professor Sprout; Ludo Bagman, with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime and Hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen. When the next song ended, everybody applaud
ed once more, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor McGonagall\rquote s hand and make his way back through the crowds, at which point Fred and George accosted him.
\par \lquote What do they think they\rquote re doing, annoying senior Ministry members?\rquote  Percy hissed, watching Fred and George suspicious\-ly. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote No}{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  respect ...\rquote 
\par Ludo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly quickly, however, and, spotting Harry, waved and came over to their table.
\par \lquote I hope my brothers weren\rquote t bothering you, Mr Bagman?\rquote  said Percy at once.
\par \lquote What? Oh, not at all, not at all!\rquote  said Bagman. \lquote No, they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs. Wondering if I could advise them on the marketing. I\rquote 
ve promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko\rquote s Joke Shop ...\rquote 
\par Percy didn\rquote t look happy about this at all, and Harry was pre\-pared to bet he would be rushing to tell Mrs Weasley about it the moment he got home. Apparently Fred and George\rquote 
s plans had grown even more ambitious lately, if they were hoping to sell to the public.
\par Bagman opened his mouth to ask Harry something, but Percy diverted him. \lquote How do you feel the Tournament\rquote s going, Mr Bagman? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Our }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39

nate, of course, but it seems to have gone very smoothly since, don\rquote t you think?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yes,\rquote  Bagman said cheerfully, \lquote it\rquote s all been enormous fun. How\rquote s old Barty doing? Shame he couldn\rquote t come.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, I\rquote m sure Mr Crouch will be up and about in no time,\rquote  said Percy importantly, \lquote but in the meantime, I\rquote m more than willing to take up the slack. Of course, it\rquote s not all attending balls \endash \rquote 
 he laughed airily \endash  \lquote oh, no, I\rquote ve had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence \endash  you heard Ali Bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying car\-pets into the country? And then we\rquote 
ve been trying to persuade the Transylvanians to sign the International Ban on Duelling, I\rquote ve got a meeting with their Head of Magical Co-operation in the new year \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Let\rquote s go for a walk,\rquote  Ron muttered to Harry, \lquote get away from Percy ...\rquote 
\par Pretending they wanted more drinks, Harry and Ron left the table, edged around the dance floor and slipped out into the Entrance Hall. The front doors stood open, and the fluttering
 fairy lights in the rose garden winked and twinkled as they went down the front steps, where they found themselves sur\-
rounded by bushes, winding ornamental paths, and large stone statues. Harry could hear splashing water, which sounded like a fountain. H
ere and there, people were sitting on carved benches. He and Ron set off along one of the winding paths through the rose bushes, but they had gone only a short way when they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice.
\par \lquote ... don\rquote t see what there is to fuss about, Igor.\rquote 
\par \lquote Severus, you cannot pretend this isn\rquote t happening!\rquote  Karkaroff\rquote s voice sounded anxious and hushed, as though keen not to be overheard. \lquote It\rquote 
s been getting clearer and clearer for months, I am becoming seriously concerned, I can\rquote t deny it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Then flee,\rquote  said Snape\rquote s voice curtly. \lquote Flee, I will make your excuses. I, however, am remaining at Hogwarts.\rquote 
\par Snape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Snape had his wand out, and was blasting rose bushes apart, his expression most ill-natured. Squeals issued from many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from them.
\par \lquote Ten points from Hufflepuff, Fawcett!\rquote  Snape snarled, as a girl ran past him. \lquote And ten points from Ravenclaw, too, Stebbins!\rquote  as a boy went rushing after her. \lquote And what are you two doing?\rquote  he added,
 catching sight of Harry and Ron on the path ahead. Karkaroff, Harry saw, looked slightly discomposed to see them standing there. His hand went nervously to his goatee, and he began winding it around his finger again.
\par \lquote We\rquote re walking,\rquote  Ron told Snape shortly. \lquote Not against the law, is it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Keep walking, then!\rquote  Snape snarled, and he brushed past them, his long black cloak billowing out behind him. Karkaroff hurried away after Snape. Harry and Ron continued down the path.
\par \lquote What\rquote s got Karkaroff all worried?\rquote  Ron muttered.
\par \lquote And since when have he and Snape been on first-name terms?\rquote  said Harry slowly.
\par They had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which they could see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain. The shad\-owy outlines of two enormous people were visi
ble on a stone bench, watching the water in the moonlight. And then Harry heard Hagrid speak.
\par \lquote Momen\rquote  I saw yeh, I knew,\rquote  he was saying, in an oddly husky voice.
\par Harry and Ron froze. This didn\rquote t sound like the sort of scene they ought to walk in on, someho
w ... Harry looked around, back up the path, and saw Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in a rose bush nearby. He tapped Ron on the shoulder and jerked his head towards them, meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without b
eing noticed (Fleur and Davies looked very busy to Harry) but Ron, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur, shook his head vigor\-ously, and pulled Harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer.
\par \lquote What did you know, \rquote Agrid?\rquote  said Madame Maxime, a distinct purr in her low voice.
\par Harry definitely didn\rquote t want to listen to this; he knew Hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like this (he certainly would have done) \endash  if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed l
oudly, but that wasn\rquote t real\-ly an option. Instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling along the stone reindeer\rquote s back, but the beetle just wasn\rquote t interesting enough to block out Hagrid\rquote s next words.
\par \lquote I jus\rquote  knew ... knew you were like me ... was it yer mother or yer father?\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  I don\rquote t know what you mean, \rquote Agrid ...\rquote 
\par \lquote It was my mother,\rquote  said Hagrid quietly. \lquote She was one o\rquote  the las\rquote  ones in Britain. \rquote Course, I can\rquote  remember her too well ... she left, see. When I was abou\rquote  three. She wasn\rquote  rea
lly the maternal sort. Well ... it\rquote s not in their natures, is it? Dunno what happened to her ... might be dead fer all I know ...\rquote 
\par Madame Maxime didn\rquote t say anything. And Harry, in spite of himself, took his eyes off the beetle, and looked over the top of the reindeer\rquote s antlers, listening ... he had never heard Hagrid talk about his childhood before.
\par \lquote Me dad was broken-hearted when she wen\rquote . Tiny little bloke, my dad was. By the time I was six I could lift him up an\rquote  put him on top o\rquote  the dresser if he annoyed me. Used ter make him laugh ...\rquote  Hagrid\rquote 
s deep voice broke. Madame Maxime was listening, motionless, apparently staring at the silvery fountain. \lquote Dad raised me ... but he died, o\rquote  course, jus\rquote  after I started school. Sorta had ter make me own way after 
that. Dumbledore was a real help, mind. Very kind ter me, he was ...\rquote 
\par Hagrid pulled out a large, spotted silk handkerchief and blew his nose heavily. \lquote So ... anyway ... enough abou\rquote  me. What about you? Which side you got it on?\rquote 
\par But Madame Maxime had suddenly got to her feet.
\par \lquote It is chilly,\rquote  she said \endash  but whatever the weather was doing, it was nowhere near as cold as her voice. \lquote I think I will go in now.\rquote 
\par \lquote Eh?\rquote  said Hagrid blankly. \lquote No, don\rquote  go! I\rquote ve \endash  I\rquote ve never met another one before!\rquote 
\par \lquote Anuzzer }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 what,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  precisely?\rquote  said Madame Maxime, her tone icy.
\par Harry could have told Hagrid it was best not to answer; he stood there in the shadows, gritting his teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn\rquote t \endash  but it was no good.
\par \lquote Another half-giant, o\rquote  course!\rquote  said Hagrid.
\par \lquote  \rquote Ow dare you!\rquote  shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice exploded through the peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him, Harry heard Fleur and Roger fall out of their rose bush. \lquote I \rquote 
ave nevair been more insulted in my life! \rquote Alf-giant? Moi? I \rquote ave \endash  I \rquote ave big bones!\rquote 
\par She stormed away; great multi-coloured swarms of fairies rose into the air as she passed, angrily pushing aside bushes. Hagrid was still sitting on the bench, staring after her. It was much too dark to make out his expressio
n. Then, after about a minute, he stood up and strode away, not back to the castle, but off out into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabin.
\par \lquote C\rquote mon,\rquote  Harry said, very quietly to Ron. \lquote Let\rquote s go ...\rquote 
\par But Ron didn\rquote t move.
\par \lquote What\rquote s up?\rquote  said Harry, looking at him.
\par Ron looked around at Harry, his expression very serious indeed.
\par \lquote Did you know?\rquote  he whispered. \lquote About Hagrid being half-giant?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  Harry said, shrugging. \lquote So what?\rquote 
\par He knew immediately from the look Ron was giving him, that he was once again 
revealing his ignorance of the wizarding world. Brought up by the Dursleys, there were many things that wizards took for granted that were revelations to Harry, but these surprises had become fewer as he had moved up the school. Now, however, he could tel
l that most wizards would not have said \lquote So what?\rquote  upon finding out that one of their friends had a giantess for a mother.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll explain inside,\rquote  said Ron quietly. \lquote C\rquote mon ...\rquote 
\par Fleur and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably into a more private clump of bus
hes. Harry and Ron returned to the Great Hall. Parvati and Padma were now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of Beauxbatons boys, and Hermione was once more dancing with Krum. Harry and Ron sat down at a table far removed from the dance floor.

\par \lquote So?\rquote  Harry prompted Ron. \lquote What\rquote s the problem with giants?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, they\rquote re ... they\rquote re ...\rquote  Ron struggled for words, \lquote not very nice,\rquote  he finished lamely.
\par \lquote Who cares?\rquote  Harry said. \lquote There\rquote s nothing wrong with Hagrid!\rquote 
\par \lquote I know there isn\rquote t, but ... blimey, no wonder he keeps it quiet,\rquote  Ron said, shaking his head. \lquote I always thought he\rquote d got in the way of a bad Engorgement Charm when he was a kid or something. Didn\rquote 
t like to mention it ...\rquote 
\par \lquote But what\rquote s it matter if his mother was a giantess?\rquote  said Harry.

\par \lquote I don\rquote t know who Maxime thinks she\rquote s kidding,\rquote  Harry said, watching Madame Maxime sitting alone at the judges\rquote  table, looking very sombre. \lquote If Hagrid\rquote 
s half-giant, she definitely is. Big bones ... the only thing that\rquote s got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur.\rquote 
\par Harry and Ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in their corner, neither of them having any inclination to dance. Harry tried not to watch Cho and Cedric; it gave him a strong desire to kick something.
\par When the Weird Sisters finished playing at midnight, everyone gave them a last, loud round of applause, and start\-
ed to wend their way into the Entrance Hall. Many people were expressing the wish that the ball could have gone on longer, but Harry was perfectly happy to be going to bed; as far as he was concerned, the evening hadn\rquote t been much fun.
\par Out in the Entrance Hall, Harry and Ron saw Hermione say\-ing goodnight to Krum before he went back to the Durmstrang ship. She gave Ron a very cold look, and swept
 past him up the marble staircase without speaking. Harry and Ron followed her, but halfway up the marble staircase, Harry heard someone calling him.
\par \lquote Hey \endash  Harry!\rquote 
\par It was Cedric Diggory. Harry could see Cho waiting for him in the Entrance Hall below.
\par \lquote Yeah?\rquote  said Harry coldly, as Cedric ran up the stairs towards him.
\par Cedric looked as though he didn\rquote t want to say whatever it was in front of Ron, who shrugged, looking bad-tempered, and continued to climb the stairs.
\par \lquote Listen ...\rquote  Cedric lowered his voice as Ron disappeared. \lquote I owe you one for telling me about the dragons. You know that golden egg? Does yours wail when you open it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well ... take a bath, OK?\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote 
\par \lquote Take a bath, and \endash  er \endash  take the egg with you, and \endash  er \endash  just mull things over in the hot water. It\rquote ll help you think ... trust me.\rquote 
\par Harry stared at him.

\par He grinned at Harry again and hurried back down the stairs to Cho.
\par Harry walked back to Gryffindor Tower alone. That had been extremely strange advice. Why would a bath help him to work out what the wailing egg meant? Was Cedri
c pulling his leg? Was he trying to make Harry look a fool, so Cho would like Cedric even more by comparison?
\par The Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait hole. Harry had to yell \lquote Fairy lights!\rquote  before he woke them up, and 
when he did, they were extremely irritated. He climbed into the common room, and found Ron and Hermione having a blazing row. Standing ten feet apart, they were bellowing at each other, each scarlet in the face.
\par \lquote Well, if you don\rquote t like it, you know what the solution is, don\rquote t you?\rquote  yelled Hermione; her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and her face was screwed up in anger.
\par \lquote Oh yeah?\rquote  Ron yelled back. \lquote What\rquote s that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Next time there\rquote s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!\rquote 
\par Ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as Hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the girls\rquote  stair\-case to bed. Ron turned to look at Harry.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  he spluttered, looking thunderstruck, \lquote well \endash  that just proves \endash  completely missed the point \endash \rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t say anything. He liked being back on speaking terms with Ron too much to speak his mind right now \endash  but he somehow thought that Hermione had got the point much better than Ron had.

Everybody got up late on Boxing Day. The Gryffindor common room was much quieter than it had been lately, many yawns punctuating the lazy conversations. Hermione\rquote s hair was bushy again; she confessed to Harry that she had used liberal amounts of S
leekeazy\rquote s Hair Potion on it for the ball, \lquote but it\rquote s way too much bother to do every day,\rquote  she said matter-of-factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.

ent. They were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal. Ron and Harry wasted no time in telling Hermione about the conversa\-tion they had overheard between Madame Maxime and Hagrid, but Hermione didn\rquote 
t seem to find the news that Hagrid was a half-giant nearly as shocking as Ron did.
\par \lquote Well, I thought he must be,\rquote  she said, shrugging. \lquote I knew he couldn\rquote t be pure giant, because they\rquote re about twenty feet tall. But honestly, all this hysteria about giants. They can\rquote t }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39

\rquote s just bigotry, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par Ron looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly, but perhaps he didn\rquote t want another row, because he contented himself with shaking his head disbelievingly while Hermione wasn\rquote t looking.
\par It was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the first week of the holidays. Everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat, now that Christmas was over \endash  everybody except Harry, that is, who was starti
ng (once again) to feel slightly nervous.
\par The trouble was that February the twenty-fourth looked a lot closer from this side of Christmas, and he still hadn\rquote t done anything about working out the clue inside the golden egg. He therefore started taking the e
gg out of his trunk every time he went up to the dormitory, opening it and listening intently, hoping that this time it would make some sense. He strained to think what the sound reminded him of, apart from thirty musi\-
cal saws, but he had never heard anything else like it. He closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and opened it again to see if the sound had changed, but it hadn\rquote t. He tried asking the egg questions, shouting over all the wailing, but nothing hap\-
pened. He even threw the egg across the room \endash  though he hadn\rquote t really expected that to help.
\par Harry had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given him, but his less-than-friendly feelings towards Cedric just now meant that he was keen not to accept his help if he could avoid it. In any case, it seeme
d to him that if Cedric had really wanted to give Harry a hand, he would have been a lot more explicit. He, Harry, had told Cedric exactly what was coming in the first task \endash  and Cedric\rquote 
s idea of a fair exchange had been to tell Harry to take a bath. Well, he didn\rquote t need that sort of rubbishy help \endash 
 not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with Cho, anyway. And so the first day of the new term arrived, and Harry set off to lessons, weighed down with books, parchment and quills as usual,
 but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his stomach, as though he was carrying that around with him too.
\par Snow was still thick upon the grounds, and the greenhouse windows were covered in condensation so thick that they couldn\rquote t see out of them
 in Herbology. Nobody was looking forward to Care of Magical Creatures much in this weather, though, as Ron said, the Skrewts would probably warm them up nicely, either by chasing them or by blasting off so forceful\-ly that Hagrid\rquote 
s cabin caught fire.
\par When they arrived at Hagrid\rquote s cabin, however, they found an elderly witch with closely cropped grey hair and a very promi\-nent chin standing before his front door.
\par \lquote Hurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago,\rquote  she barked at them, as they struggled towards her through the snow.
\par \lquote Who\rquote re you?\rquote  said Ron, staring at her. \lquote Where\rquote s Hagrid?\rquote 
\par \lquote My name is Professor Grubbly-Plank,\rquote  she said briskly, \lquote I am your temporary Care of Magical Creatures teacher.\rquote 
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Hagrid?\rquote  Harry repeated loudly.
\par \lquote He is indisposed,\rquote  said Professor Grubbly-Plank shortly.
\par Soft and unpleasant laughter reached Harry\rquote s ears. He turned; Draco Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherins were join\-ing the class. All of them looked gleeful, and none of them looked surprised to see Professor Grubbly-Plank.
\par \lquote This way, please,\rquote  said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and she strode off around the paddock where the huge Beauxbatons horses were shivering. Harry, Ron and Hermione followed her, looking back over their shoulders at Hagrid\rquote 
s cabin. All the curtains were closed. Was Hagrid in there, alone and ill?
\par \lquote What\rquote s wrong with Hagrid?\rquote  Harry said, hurrying to catch up with Professor Grubbly-Plank.
\par \lquote Never you mind,\rquote  she said, as though she thought he was being nosy.
\par \lquote I do mind, though,\rquote  said Harry hotly. \lquote What\rquote s up with him?\rquote 
\par Professor Grubbly-Plank acted as though she couldn\rquote t hear him. She led them past the paddock where the Beauxbatons horses were standing, huddled against the cold, and towards a tree on the edge of the Forest, where a large and beautiful unicorn was
 tethered.
\par Many of the girls \lquote ooooohed!\rquote  at the sight of the unicorn.
\par \lquote Oh, it\rquote s so beautiful!\rquote  whispered Lavender Brown. \lquote How did she get it? They\rquote re supposed to be really hard to catch!\rquote 
\par The unicorn was so brightly white that it made the snow all around look grey. It was pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves, and throwing back its horned head.
\par \lquote Boys keep back!\rquote  barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, throwing out an arm and catching Harry hard in the chest. \lquote They prefer the woman\rquote s touch, unicorns. Girls to the front, and approach with care. Come on, easy does it ...\rquote 

\par She and the girls walked slowly forwards towards the unicorn, leaving the boys standing near the paddock fence, watching.
\par The moment Professor Grubbly-Plank was out of earshot, Harry turned to Ron. \lquote What d\rquote you reckon\rquote s wrong with him? You don\rquote t think a Skrewt \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, he hasn\rquote t been attacked, Potter, if that\rquote s what you\rquote re thinking,\rquote  said Malfoy softly. \lquote No, he\rquote s just too ashamed to show his big ugly face.\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean?\rquote  said Harry sharply.
\par Malfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes, and pulled out a folded page of newsprint.
\par \lquote There you go,\rquote  he said. \lquote Hate to break it to you, Potter ...\rquote 
\par He smirked as Harry snatched the page, unfolded it, and read it, with Ron, Seamus, Dean and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.

\par \lquote That was a really good lesson,\rquote  said Hermione, as they entered the Great Hall. \lquote I didn\rquote t know half the things Professor Grubbly-Plank told us about uni\emdash \rquote 
\par \lquote Look at this!\rquote  Harry snarled, and he shoved the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
article under Hermione\rquote s nose.
\par Hermione\rquote s mouth fell open as she read. Her reaction was exactly the same as Ron\rquote s. \lquote How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out? You don\rquote t think Hagrid }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 told }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 her?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, leading the way over to the Gryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair, furious. \lquote He never even told us, did he? I reckon she was so mad he wouldn\rquote 
t give her loads of horrible stuff about me, she went ferreting around to get back at him.\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball,\rquote  said Hermione quietly.
\par \lquote We\rquote d have seen her in the garden!\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Anyway, she\rquote s not supposed to come into school any more, Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe she\rquote s got an Invisibility Cloak,\rquote  said Harry, ladling chicken casserole onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger. \lquote Sort of thing she\rquote d do, isn\rquote t it, hide in bushes listen\-ing to people.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Like you and Ron did, you mean,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote We weren\rquote t trying to hear him!\rquote  said Ron indignantly. \lquote We didn\rquote t have any choice! The stupid git, talking about his giant\-ess mother where anyone could have heard him!\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote ve got to go and see him,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote This evening, after Divination. Tell him we want him back ... You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 do }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 want him back?\rquote  he shot at Hermione.
\par \lquote I \endash  well, I\rquote m not going to pretend it didn\rquote t make a nice change, having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once \endash  but I do want Hagrid back, of course I do!\rquote 
 Hermione added hastily, quailing under Harry\rquote s furious stare.
\par So that evening after dinner, the three of them left the castle once more, and went down through the frozen grounds to Hagrid\rquote s cabin. They knocked, and Fang\rquote s booming barks answered.
\par \lquote Hagrid, it\rquote s us!\rquote  Harry shouted, pounding on the door. \lquote Open up!\rquote 
\par He didn\rquote t answer. They could hear Fang scratching at the door, whining, but it didn\rquote t open. They hammered on it for ten more minutes; Ron even went and banged on one of the win\-dows, but there was no response.
\par \lquote What\rquote s he avoiding }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 us }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 for?\rquote 
 Hermione said, when they had finally given up, and were walking back to the school. \lquote He surely doesn\rquote t think we\rquote d care about him being half-giant?\rquote 
\par But it seemed that Hagrid did care. They didn\rquote t see a sign of him all week. He didn\rquote t appear at the staff table at meal-times, they didn\rquote 
t see him going about his gamekeeper duties in the grounds, and Professor Grubbly-Plank continued to take the Care of Magical Creatures classes. Malfoy was gloating at every possible opportunity.
\par \lquote Missing your half-breed pal?\rquote  he kept whispering to Harry, whenever there was a teacher around, so that he was safe from Harry\rquote s retaliation. \lquote Missing the elephant man?\rquote 
\par There was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January. Hermione was very surprised that Harry was planning to go.
\par \lquote I just thought you\rquote d want to take advantage of the common room being quiet,\rquote  she said. \lquote Really get to work on that egg.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, I \endash  I reckon I\rquote ve got a pretty good idea what it\rquote s about now,\rquote  Harry lied.
\par \lquote Have you really?\rquote  said Hermione, looking impressed. \lquote Well done!\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them. He still had five weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages ... and if he went into Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and get a chance to persuade him to come back.

\par He, Ron and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday, and set off through the cold, wet grounds towards the gates. As they passed the Durmstrang ship mo
ored in the lake, they saw Viktor Krum emerge onto the deck, dressed in nothing but swimming trunks. He was very skinny, but apparently a lot tougher than he looked, because he climbed up onto the side of the ship, stretched out his arms and dived, right 
into the lake.
\par \lquote He\rquote s mad!\rquote  said Harry, staring at Krum\rquote s dark head, as it bobbed out into the middle of the lake. \lquote It must be freezing, it\rquote s January!\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s a lot colder where he comes from,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote I suppose it feels quite warm to him.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, but there\rquote s still the giant squid,\rquote  said Ron. He didn\rquote t sound anxious \endash  if anything, he sounded hopeful. Hermione noticed his tone of voice, and frowned.
\par \lquote He\rquote s really nice, you know,\rquote  she said. \lquote He\rquote s not at all like you\rquote d think, coming from Durmstrang. He likes it much better here, he told me.\rquote 
\par Ron said nothing. He hadn\rquote t mentioned Viktor Krum since the ball, but Harry had found a miniature arm under his bed on Boxing Day, which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing Bulgaria Quidditch robes.

\par Harry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagrid all the way down the slushy High Street, and suggested a visit to the Three Broomsticks once he had ascertained that Hagrid was not in any of the shops.
\par The pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at all the tables told Harry that Hagrid wasn\rquote t there. Heart sink\-
ing, he went up to the bar with Ron and Hermione, ordered three Butterbeers from Madam Rosmerta, and thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after all.
\par \lquote Doesn\rquote t he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 ever}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  go into the office?\rquote 
 Hermione whispered suddenly. \lquote Look!\rquote 
\par She pointed into the mirror behind the bar, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman reflected there, sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of g
oblins. Bagman was talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins, all of whom had their arms crossed, and were looking rather menacing.
\par It was indeed odd, Harry thought, that Bagman was here at the Three Broomsticks on a weekend when there was no Triwiza
rd event, and therefore no judging to be done. He watched Bagman in the mirror. He was looking strained again, quite as strained as he had done that night in the forest before the Dark Mark had appeared. But just then Bagman glanced over at the bar, saw H
arry, and stood up.
\par \lquote In a moment, in a moment!\rquote  Harry heard him say brusquely to the goblins, and Bagman hurried through the pub towards Harry, his boyish grin back in place.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  he said. \lquote How are you? Been hoping to run into you! Everything going all right?\rquote 
\par \lquote Fine, thanks,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Wonder if I could have a quick, private word, Harry?\rquote  said Bagman eagerly. \lquote You couldn\rquote t give us a moment, you two, could you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  OK,\rquote  said Ron, and he and Hermione went off to find a table.
\par Bagman led Harry along the bar to the end furthest from Madam Rosmerta.
\par \lquote Well, I just thought I\rquote d congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that Horntail, Harry,\rquote  said Bagman. \lquote Really superb.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  said Harry, but he knew this couldn\rquote t be all that Bagman wanted to say, because he could have congratulated Harry in front of Ron and Hermione. Bagman didn\rquote 
t seem in any particular rush to spill the beans, though. Harry saw him glance into the mirror over the bar at the goblins, who were all watching him and Harry in silence through their dark, slanting eyes.
\par \lquote Absolute nightmare,\rquote  said Bagman to Harry in an undertone, noticing Harry watching the goblins, too. \lquote Their English isn\rquote t too good ... it\rquote s like being back with all the Bulgarians at t
he Quidditch World Cup ... but at least }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 they }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
used sign language another human could recognise. This lot keep gabbling in Gobbledegook ... and I only know one word of Gobbledegook. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Bladvak. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 It means \lquote pickaxe\rquote . I don\rquote t like to use it in case they think I\rquote m threatening them.\rquote  He gave a short, booming laugh.
\par \lquote What do they want?\rquote  Harry said, noticing how the goblins were still watching Bagman very closely.
\par \lquote Er \endash  well ...\rquote  said Bagman, looking suddenly nervous. \lquote They ... er ... they\rquote re looking for Barty Crouch.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why are they looking for him here?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote He\rquote s at the Ministry in London, isn\rquote t he?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ... as a matter of fact, I\rquote ve no idea where he is,\rquote  said Bagman. \lquote He\rquote s sort of ... stopped coming to work. Been absent for a couple of weeks now. Young Percy, his assistant, says he\rquote s ill. Apparently he
\rquote s just been sending instructions in by owl. But would you mind not mentioning that to anyone, Harry? Because Rita Skeeter\rquote s still poking around everywhere she can, and I\rquote m willing to bet she\rquote d work Barty\rquote s illnes
s up into some\-thing sinister. Probably say he\rquote s gone missing like Bertha Jorkins.\rquote 
\par \lquote Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Bagman, looking strained again. \lquote I\rquote ve got people looking, of course ...\rquote  (About time, thought Harry) \lquote and it\rquote s all very strange. She definitely }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 arrived }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 in Albania, because she met her second cousin there. And then she left the cousin\rquote 
s house to go south and see an aunt ... and she seems to have vanished without trace, en route. Blowed if I can see where she\rquote s got to ... she doesn\rquote 
t seem the type to elope, for instance ... but still ... what are we doing, talking about goblins and Bertha Jorkins? I really wanted to ask you,\rquote  he lowered his voice, \lquote how are you getting on with your golden egg?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ... not bad,\rquote  Harry said untruthfully.
\par Bagman seemed to know he wasn\rquote t being honest.
\par \lquote Listen, Harry,\rquote  he said (still in a very low voice), \lquote I feel very bad about all this ... you were thrown into this Tournament, you didn\rquote t volunteer for it ... and if\rquote  (his voice w
as so quiet now, Harry had to lean closer to listen) \lquote ... if I can help at all ... a prod in the right direction ... I\rquote ve taken a liking to you ... the way you got past that dragon! ... Well, just say the word.\rquote 
\par Harry looked up into Bagman\rquote s round, rosy face, and wide, baby-blue eyes.
\par \lquote We\rquote re supposed to work out the clues alone, aren\rquote t we?\rquote  he said, careful to keep his voice casual, and not sound as though he was accusing the Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports of breaking the rules.
\par \lquote Well ... well, yes,\rquote  said Bagman impatiently, \lquote but \endash  come on, Harry \endash  we all want a Hogwarts victory, don\rquote t we?\rquote 
\par \lquote Have you offered Cedric help?\rquote  Harry said.
\par The smallest of frowns creased Bagman\rquote s smooth face.
\par \lquote No, I haven\rquote t,\rquote  he said. \lquote I \endash  well, like I say, I\rquote ve taken a liking to you. Just thought I\rquote d offer ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, thanks,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but I think I\rquote m nearly there with the egg ... couple more days should crack it.\rquote 
\par He wasn\rquote t entirely sure why he was refusing Bagman\rquote s help, except that Bagman was almost a stranger to him, and accept\-ing his assistance would feel somehow much more like cheat\-ing than asking advice from Ron, Hermione or Sirius.
\par Bagman looked almost affronted, but couldn\rquote t say much more as Fred and George turned up at that point.
\par \lquote Hello, Mr Bagman,\rquote  said Fred brightly. \lquote Can we buy you a drink?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ... no,\rquote  said Bagman, with a last disappointed glance at Harry, \lquote no thank you, boys ...\rquote 
\par Fred and George looked quite as disappointed as Bagman, who was surveying Harry as though he had let him down badly.
\par \lquote Well, I must dash,\rquote  he said. \lquote Nice seeing you all. Good luck, Harry.\rquote 
\par He hurried out of the pub. The goblins all slid off their chairs and exited after him. Harry went to rejoin Ron and Hermione.
\par \lquote What did he want?\rquote  Ron said, the moment Harry had sat down.
\par \lquote He offered to help me with the golden egg,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote He shouldn\rquote t be doing that!\rquote  said Hermione, looking very shocked. \lquote He\rquote s one of the judges! And anyway, you\rquote ve already worked it out \endash  haven\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ... nearly,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well, I don\rquote t think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat!\rquote  said Hermione, still looking deeply disapproving. \lquote I hope he\rquote s trying to help Cedric as much!\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s not. I asked,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Who cares if Diggory\rquote s getting help?\rquote  said Ron. Harry pri\-vately agreed.
\par \lquote Those goblins didn\rquote t look very friendly,\rquote  said Hermione, sip\-ping her Butterbeer. \lquote What were they doing here?\rquote 
\par \lquote Looking for Crouch, according to Bagman,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote He\rquote s still ill. Hasn\rquote t been into work.\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe Percy\rquote s poisoning him,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Probably thinks if Crouch snuffs it he\rquote ll be made Head of the Department of International Magical Co-operation.\rquote 
\par Hermione gave Ron a don\rquote t-joke-about-things-like-that look, and said, \lquote Funny, goblins looking for Mr Crouch ... they\rquote d normally deal with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.\rquote 
\par \lquote Crouch can speak loads of different languages, though,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Maybe they need an interpreter.\rquote 
\par \lquote Worrying about poor \rquote ickle goblins, now, are you?\rquote  Ron asked Hermione. \lquote Thinking of starting up S.P.U.G. or some\-thing? Society for the Protection of Ugly Goblins?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ha, ha, ha,\rquote  said Hermione sarcastically. \lquote Goblins don\rquote t need protection. Haven\rquote t you been listening to what Professor Binns has been telling us about goblin rebellions?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry and Ron together.
\par \lquote Well, they\rquote re quite capable of dealing with wizards,\rquote  said Hermione, sipping more of her Butterbeer. \lquote They\rquote re very clever. They\rquote re not like house-elves, who never stick up for them\-selves.\rquote 
\par \lquote Uh oh,\rquote  said Ron, staring at the door.
\par Rita Skeeter had just entered. She was wearing banana-yellow robes today; her long nails were painted shocking pink, and she was accompanied by her paunchy photographer. She bought drinks, a
nd she and the photographer made their way through the crowds to a table nearby, Harry, Ron and Hermione glaring at her as she approached. She was talking fast and looking very satisfied about something.
\par \lquote ... didn\rquote t seem very keen to talk to us, did he, Bozo? Now, why would that be, do you think? And what\rquote 
s he doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway? Showing them the sights ... what nonsense ... he was always a bad liar. Reckon some\-thing\rquote s up? Think we should do a bit of digging? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

 we just need to find a story to fit it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Trying to ruin someone else\rquote s life?\rquote  said Harry loudly.
\par A few people looked around. Rita Skeeter\rquote s eyes widened behind her jewelled spectacles as she saw who had spoken.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  she said, beaming. \lquote How lovely! Why don\rquote t you come and join \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote I wouldn\rquote t come near you with a ten-foot broomstick,\rquote  said Harry furiously. \lquote What did you do that to Hagrid for, eh?\rquote 
\par Rita Skeeter raised her heavily pencilled eyebrows.
\par \lquote Our readers have the right to know the truth, Harry, I am merely doing my \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Who cares if he\rquote s half-giant?\rquote  Harry shouted. \lquote There\rquote s noth\-ing wrong with him!\rquote 
\par The whole pub had gone very quiet. Madam Rosmerta was staring over from behind the bar, apparently oblivious of the fact that the flagon she was filling with mead was overflowing.
\par Rita Skeeter\rquote s smile flickered very slightly, but she hitched it back almost at once; she snapped open her crocodile-skin hand\-bag, pulled out her Quick-Quotes Quill and said, \lquote How about giving me an interview about the Hagrid }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 know, Harry? The man behind the muscles? Your unlikely friendship and the rea\-
sons behind it. Would you call him a father substitute?\rquote 
\par Hermione stood up very abruptly, her Butterbeer clutched in her hand as though it was a grenade.
\par \lquote You horrible woman,\rquote  she said, through gritted teeth, \lquote you don\rquote t care, do you, anything for a story, and anyone will do, won\rquote t they? Even Ludo Bagman \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Sit down, you silly little girl, and don\rquote t talk about things you don\rquote t understand,\rquote  said Rita Skeeter coldly, her eyes hardening as they fell on Hermione. \lquote 
I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
that it needs it \endash \rquote  she added, eyeing Hermione\rquote s bushy hair.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s go,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote C\rquote mon, Harry \endash  Ron ...\rquote 
\par They left; many people were staring at them as they went. Harry glanced back as they reached the door. Rita Skeeter\rquote s Quick-Quotes Quill was out; it was zooming backwards and forwards over a piece of parchment on the table.
\par \lquote She\rquote ll be after you next, Hermione,\rquote  said Ron, in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street.
\par \lquote Let her try!\rquote  said Hermione shrilly; she was shaking with rage. \lquote I\rquote ll show her! Silly little girl, am I? Oh, I\rquote ll get her back for this, first Harry, then Hagrid ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter,\rquote  said Ron nervously. \lquote I\rquote m serious, Hermione, she\rquote ll dig something up on you \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote My parents don\rquote t read the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Daily Prophet, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 she can\rquote 
t scare me into hiding!\rquote  said Hermione, now striding along so fast that it was all Harry and Ron could do to keep up with her. The last time Harry had seen Hermione in a rage like this, she had hit Draco Malfoy around the face. \lquote 
And Hagrid isn\rquote t going to hide any more! He should }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 never }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

\par Breaking into a run, she led them all the way back up the road, through the gates flanked by winged boars, and up through the grounds to Hagrid\rquote s cabin.
\par The curtains were still drawn, and they could hear Fang barking as they approached.
\par \lquote Hagrid!\rquote  Hermione shouted, pounding on his front door. \lquote Hagrid, that\rquote s enough! We know you\rquote re in there! Nobody cares if your mum was a giantess, Hagrid! You can\rquote t let that foul Skeeter woman do this to yo
u! Hagrid, get out here, you\rquote re just being \endash \rquote 
\par The door opened. Hermione said \lquote About t\emdash !\rquote  and then stopped, very suddenly, because she had found herself face to face, not with Hagrid, but with Albus Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Good afternoon,\rquote  he said pleasantly, smiling down at them.
\par \lquote We \endash  er \endash  we wanted to see Hagrid,\rquote  said Hermione in a rather small voice.
\par \lquote Yes, I surmised as much,\rquote  said Dumbledore, his eyes twink\-ling. \lquote Why don\rquote t you come in?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh ... um ... OK,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par She, Ron and Harry went into the cabin; Fang launched himself upon Harry the moment he entered, barking madly and trying to lick his ears. Harry fended Fang off, and looked around.
\par Hagrid was sitting at his table, where there were two large mugs of tea. He looked a real mess. His face was blotchy
, his eyes swollen, and he had gone to the other extreme where his hair was concerned; far from trying to make it behave, it now looked like a wig of tangled wire.
\par \lquote Hi, Hagrid,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Hagrid looked up.
\par \lquote  \rquote Lo,\rquote  he said, in a very hoarse voice.
\par \lquote More tea, I think,\rquote 
 said Dumbledore, closing the door behind Harry, Ron and Hermione, drawing out his wand and twiddling it; a revolving tea-tray appeared in mid-air, along with a plate of cakes. Dumbledore magicked the tray onto the table, and everybody sat dow
n. There was a slight pause, and then Dumbledore said, \lquote Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting, Hagrid?\rquote 
\par Hermione went slightly pink, but Dumbledore smiled at her, and continued, \lquote Hermione, Harry and Ron still seem to want to know you, judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door.\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course we still want to know you!\rquote  Harry said, staring at Hagrid. \lquote You don\rquote t think anything that Skeeter cow \endash  sorry, Professor,\rquote  he added quickly, looking at Dumbledore.
\par \lquote I have gone temporarily deaf and haven\rquote t any idea what you said, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore, twiddling his thumbs and star\-ing at the ceiling.
\par \lquote Er \endash  right,\rquote  said Harry sheepishly. \lquote I just meant \endash  Hagrid, how could you think we\rquote d care what that \endash  woman \endash  wrote about you?\rquote 
\par Two fat tears leaked out of Hagrid\rquote s beetle-black eyes and fell slowly into his tangled beard.
\par \lquote Living proof of what I\rquote ve been telling you, Hagrid,\rquote  said Dumbledore, still looking carefully up at the ceiling. \lquote I have shown you the letters from the countless parents who remem\-

\par \lquote Not all of \rquote em,\rquote  said Hagrid hoarsely. \lquote Not all of \rquote em wan\rquote  me ter stay.\rquote 
\par \lquote Really, Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal populari\-ty, I\rquote m afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time,\rquote  said Dumbledore, now peering sternly over his half-moon specta\-cles. \lquote 
Not a week has passed, since I became Headmaster of this school, when I haven\rquote t had at least one owl complaining about the way I run it. But what should I do? Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeh \endash  yeh\rquote re not half-giant!\rquote  said Hagrid croakily.
\par \lquote Hagrid, look what I\rquote ve got for relatives!\rquote  Harry said furious\-ly. \lquote Look at the Dursleys!\rquote 
\par \lquote An excellent point,\rquote  said Professor Dumbledore. \lquote My own brother, Aberforth, was prosecuted for practising inappropriate charms on a goat. It was all over the papers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He held his head high and 
went about his business as usual! Of course, I\rquote m not entirely sure he can read, so that may not have been bravery ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Come back and teach, Hagrid,\rquote  said Hermione quietly, \lquote please come back, we really miss you.\rquote 
\par Hagrid gulped. More tears leaked out down his cheeks and into his tangled beard. Dumbledore stood up.
\par \lquote I refuse to accept your resignation, Hagrid, and I expect you back at work on Monday,\rquote  he said. \lquote You will join me for break\-fast at eight thirty in the Great Hall. No excuses. Good after\-noon to you all.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore left the cabin, pausing only to scratch Fang\rquote s ears. When the door had shut behind him, Hagrid began to sob into his dustbin-lid-sized hands. Hermione kept patting his arm, and at last Hagrid looked up, his eyes very red indeed, and sai
d, \lquote Great man, Dumbledore ... great man ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, he is,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Can I have one of these cakes, Hagrid?\rquote 
\par \lquote Help yerself,\rquote  said Hagrid, wiping his eyes on the back of his hand. \lquote Ar, he\rquote s righ\rquote , o\rquote  course \endash  yeh\rquote re all righ\rquote  ... I bin stupid ... my ol\rquote  dad woulda bin ashamed o\rquote 
 the way I\rquote ve bin behavin\rquote  ...\rquote  More tears leaked out, but he wiped them away more force\-fully, and said, \lquote Never shown you a picture of my old dad, have I? Here ...\rquote 
\par Hagrid got up, went over to his dresser, opened a drawer and pulled out a picture of a short wizard with Hagrid\rquote s crin\-kled black eyes, beaming as he sat on top of Hagrid\rquote 
s shoulder. Hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall, judging by the apple tree beside him, but his face was beardless, young, round and smooth \endash  he looked hardly older than eleven.
\par \lquote Tha\rquote  was taken jus\rquote  after I got inter Hogwarts,\rquote  said Hagrid, croakily. \lquote Dad was dead chuffed ... thought I migh\rquote  not be a wizard, see, \rquote cos me mum ... well, anyway. \lquote 
Course, I never was great shakes at magic, really ... but at least he never saw me expelled. Died, see, in me second year ...
\par \lquote Dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after Dad went. Got me the gamekeeper job ... trusts people, he does. Gives \rquote em second chances ... tha\rquote s what sets him apar\rquote  from other Heads, see. He\rquote 
ll accept anyone at Hogwarts, s\rquote long as they\rquote ve got the talent. Knows people can turn out OK even if their families weren\rquote  ... well ... all tha\rquote  respectable. But some don\rquote  understand that. There\rquote s some who\rquote

\par Harry, Ron and Hermione looked at each other nervously; Harry would rather have taken fifty Blast-Ended Skrewts for a walk than admit to
 Hagrid that he had overheard him talking to Madame Maxime, but Hagrid was still talking, apparently unaware that he had said anything odd.
\par \lquote Yeh know wha\rquote , Harry?\rquote  he said, looking up from the photo\-graph of his father, his eyes very bright. \lquote When I firs\rquote  met you, you reminded me o\rquote  me a bit. Mum an\rquote  dad gone, an\rquote  you was feelin\rquote 
 like yeh wouldn\rquote  fit in at Hogwarts, remember? Not sure yeh were really up to it ... an\rquote  now look at yeh, Harry! School champion!\rquote 
\par He looked at Harry for a moment and then said, very seriously, \lquote Yeh know what I\rquote d love, Harry? I\rquote d love yeh ter win, I really would. It\rquote d show \rquote em all ... yeh don\rquote  have ter be pure-blood ter do it. Yeh don\rquote

\par \lquote Great,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Really great.\rquote 
\par Hagrid\rquote s miserable face broke into a wide, watery smile. Tha\rquote s my boy ... You show \rquote em, Harry, you show \rquote em. Beat \rquote em all.\rquote 
\par Lying to Hagrid wasn\rquote t quite like lying to anyone else. Harry went back to the castle later that afternoon with Ron and Hermione, unable to banish the image of the happy expression on Hagrid\rquote 
s whiskery face as he had imagined Harry winning the Tournament. The incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever on Harry\rquote s conscience that evening, and by the time he had got into bed, he had made up his mind \endash 
 it was time to shelve his pride, and see if Cedric\rquote s hint was worth anything.

As Harry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work out the secret of the golden egg, he decided to do it at night, when he would be able to take as much time as he wanted. Reluctant though he was to accept more favours from Cedric, he also decided
 to use the Prefects\rquote  bathroom; far fewer people were allowed in there, so it was much less likely that he would be disturbed.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
Harry planned his excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of bed and out of bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middl
e of the night once before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he would take the Marauder\rquote 
s Map, which, next to the Cloak, was the most useful aid to 
rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most importantly of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule, labelled dots, moving around the corridors, so that H
arry would be forewarned if somebody was approaching the bathroom.
\par On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the Cloak, crept back downstairs and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him the dragons, waited for the portrait hole 
to open. This time it was Ron who waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password (\lquote Banana fritters\rquote ). \lquote Good luck,\rquote  Ron muttered, climbing into the common room as Harry crept out past him.
\par It was awkward moving under the Cloak tonight, because Harry had the heavy egg under one arm, and the map held in front of his nose with the other. However, the moonlit corri\-dors were empty and silent, and by checking the map at strate\-
gic intervals, Harry was able to ensure that he wouldn\rquote t run into anyone he wanted to
 avoid. When he reached the statue of Boris the Bewildered, a lost-looking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands, he located the right door, leant close to it, and muttered the password, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Pine-fresh\rquote , }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 just as Cedric had told him.
\par The door creaked open. Harry slipped inside, bolted the door behind him, and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, looking around.
\par His immediate reaction was that it would be worth becom\-ing a Prefect just to be able to use this bathroom. It was softly lit by a splendid candle-fil
led chandelier, and everything was made of white marble, including what looked like an empty, rectangular swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor. About a hundred golden taps stood all around the pool\rquote 
s edges, each with a different-coloured jewel s
et into its handle. There was also a diving board. Long white linen curtains hung at the windows; a large pile of fluffy white towels sat in a corner, and there was a single golden-framed painting on the wall. It fea\-
tured a blonde mermaid, who was fast asleep on a rock, her long hair fluttering over her face every time she snored.
\par Harry put down his Cloak, the egg and the map, and moved forwards, looking around, his footsteps echoing off the walls. Magnificent though the bathroom was \endash  and quite keen though he was to try out a few of those taps \endash 
 now he was here he couldn\rquote t quite suppress the feeling that Cedric might have been having him on. How on earth was this supposed to help solve the mystery of the egg? Nevertheless, he put one of the fluffy towels, 
the Cloak, the map and the egg at the side of the swimming-pool-sized bath, then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps.
\par He could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bub\-ble bath mixed with the water, though it wasn\rquote t bubble bath as Harry
 had ever experienced it. One tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of footballs, another poured ice-white foam so thick that Harry thought it would have supported his weight if he\rquote 
d cared to test it; a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hoverin
g over the surface of the water. Harry amused himself for a while turning the taps on and off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs. Then, when the deep pool was full of hot water, foam and b
ubbles (which took a very short time considering its size), Harry turned off all the taps, pulled off his pyjamas, slippers and dressing-gown, and slid into the water.
\par It was so deep that his feet barely touched the bottom, and he actually did a couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water, staring at the egg. Highly enjoy\-
able though it was to swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of different-coloured steam wafting all around him, no stroke of brilliance came to him, no sudden burst of understanding.
\par Harry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet hands and opened it. The wailing, screeching sound filled the bath\-room, echoing and reverberating off the marble walls, but it sounded just as incomprehensible as ever, if not m
ore so with all the echoes. He snapped it shut again, worried that the sound would attract Filch, wondering whether that hadn\rquote t been Cedric\rquote s plan \endash 
 and then, making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg, which clattered away across the bathroom floor, someone spoke.
\par \lquote I\rquote d try putting it }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 the water, if I were you.\rquote 
\par Harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock. He stood up, spluttering, and saw the ghost of a very glum-looking girl sitting cross-legged on top of one of the taps. It was 
Moaning Myrtle, who was usually to be heard sobbing in the S-bend of a toilet three floors below.
\par \lquote Myrtle!\rquote  Harry said in outrage. \lquote I\rquote m \endash  I\rquote m not wearing anything!\rquote 
\par The foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but he had a nasty feeling that Myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he had arrived.
\par \lquote I closed my eyes when you got in,\rquote  she said, blinking at him through her thick spectacles. \lquote You haven\rquote t been to see me for }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 ages.\rquote }
{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par \lquote Yeah ... well ...\rquote  said Harry, bending his knees slightly, just to make absolutely sure Myrtle couldn\rquote t see anything but his head, \lquote I\rquote m not supposed to come into your bathroom, am I? It\rquote s a girls\rquote  one.
\rquote 
\par \lquote You didn\rquote t used to care,\rquote  said Myrtle miserably. \lquote You used to be in there all the time.\rquote 
\par This was true, though only because Harry, Ron and Hermione had found Myrtle\rquote s out-of-order toilets a convenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in secret \endash 
 a forbidden potion which had turned Harry and Ron into living replicas of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so that they could sneak into the Slytherin common room.
\par \lquote I got told off for going in there,\rquote  said Harry, which was half-true; Percy had once caught him coming out of Myrtle\rquote s bath\-room. \lquote I thought I\rquote d better not come back after that.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh ... I see ...\rquote  said Myrtle, picking at a spot on her chin in a morose sort of way. \lquote Well ... anyway ... I\rquote d try the egg in the water. That\rquote s what Cedric Diggory did.\rquote 
\par \lquote Have you been spying on him, too?\rquote  said Harry indignantly. \lquote What d\rquote you do, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the Prefects take baths?\rquote 
\par \lquote Sometimes,\rquote  said Myrtle, rather slyly, \lquote but I\rquote ve never come out to speak to anyone before.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m honoured,\rquote  said Harry darkly. \lquote You keep your eyes shut!\rquote 
\par He made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting himself out of the bath, wrapping the towel firmly around himself and going to get the egg.
\par Once he was back in the water, Myrtle peered through her fingers and said, \lquote Go on, then ... open it under the water!\rquote 
\par Harry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface, and opened it ... and, this time, it did not wail. A gurgling song was coming out of it, a song whose words he couldn\rquote t distin\-guish through the water.
\par \lquote You need to put your head under, too,\rquote  said Myrtle, who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying bossing him around. \lquote Go on!\rquote 
\par Harry took a great breath, and slid under the surface \endash  and now, sitting on the marble bottom of the bubble-filled bath, he heard a chorus of eerie voices singing to him from the open egg in his hands:

\par He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when Hermione\rquote s dose of Polyjuice Potion had given her the hairy face and tail of a cat.

\par \lquote Well, that\rquote s what Diggory thought,\rquote  she said. \lquote He lay there talking to himself for ages about it. Ages and ages ... nearly all the bubbles had gone ...\rquote

 she said shrilly, and her voice echoed loudly around the bathroom. \lquote When I can\rquote t ... when I haven\rquote t ... not for ages ...\rquote  She buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly.
\par Harry remembered how touchy Myrtle had always been about being dead, but none of the other ghosts he knew made such a fuss about it. \lquote Sorry,\rquote  he said impatiently. \lquote I didn\rquote t mean \endash  I just forgot ...\rquote

\par \lquote Will you come and visit me in my bathroom again some\-time?\rquote  Moaning Myrtle asked mournfully, as Harry picked up the Invisibility Cloak.
\par \lquote Er ... I\rquote ll try,\rquote  Harry said, though privately thinking the only way he\rquote d be visiting Myrtle\rquote s bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got blocked. \lquote See you, Myrtle ... thanks for your help.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Bye, bye,\rquote  she said gloomily, and as Harry put on the Invisibility Cloak, he saw her zoom back up the tap.
\par Out in the dark corridor, Harry examined the Marauder\rquote s Map to check that the coast was still clear. Yes, the dots belonging to Filch and Mrs Norris were safely in their office ... nothing else seemed to be moving 
apart from Peeves, who was bouncing around the trophy room on the floor above ... Harry had taken his first step back towards Gryffindor Tower, when something else on the map caught his eye ... something dis\-tinctly odd.
\par Peeves was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 the only thing that 
was moving. A single dot was flitting around a room in the bottom left-hand corner \endash  Snape\rquote s office. But the dot wasn\rquote t labelled \lquote Severus Snape\rquote  ... it was Bartemius Crouch.
\par Harry stared at the dot. Mr Crouch was supposed to be too ill to go to work or to come to the Yule Ball \endash  so what was he doing, sneaking into Hogwarts at one o\rquote 
clock in the morning? Harry watched closely as the dot moved round and round the room, pausing here and there ...
\par Harry hesitated, thinking ... and then his curiosity got the better of him. He turned, and set off in the opposite direction, towards the nearest staircase. He was going to see what Crouch was up to.
\par Harry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible, though the faces in some of the portraits still turned curiously at
 the squeak of a floorboard, the rustle of his pyjamas. He crept along the corridor below, pushed aside a tapestry about halfway along and proceeded down a narrower staircase, a shortcut which would take him down two floors. He kept glancing down at the m
ap, wondering ... it just didn\rquote t seem in character, somehow, for correct, law-abiding Mr Crouch to be sneaking around somebody else\rquote s office this late at night ...
\par And then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking about what he was doing, not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behaviour of Mr Crouch, Harry\rquote 
s leg suddenly sank right through the trick step Neville always forgot to jump. He gave an ungainly wobble, and the golden egg, still damp from the bath, slipped from under his arm \endash 
 he lurched forwards to try and catch it, but too late; the egg fell down the long stair\-case with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every step \endash  the Invisibility Cloak slipped \endash  Harry snatched at it, and the Marauder\rquote 
s Map fluttered out of his hand, and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in the step to above his knee, he couldn\rquote t reach it.
\par The golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the staircase, burst open and began wailing loudly in the corridor below. Harry pulled out his wand and struggled to touch the Marauder\rquote 
s Map, to wipe it blank, but it was too far away to reach \endash 
\par Pulling the Cloak back over himself Harry straightened up, listening hard, his eyes screwed up with fear ... and, almost immediately \endash 
\par \lquote PEEVES!\rquote 
\par It was the unmistakeable hunting cry of Filch the caretaker. Harry could hear his rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer, his wheezy voice raised in fury.
\par \lquote What\rquote s this racket? Wake up the whole castle, will you? I\rquote ll have you, Peeves, I\rquote ll have you, you\rquote ll ... and what is this?\rquote 
\par Filch\rquote s footsteps stopped; there was a clink of metal on metal, and the wailing stopped \endash  Filch had picked up the egg and closed it. Harry stood very still, one leg sti
ll jammed tightly in the magical step, listening. Any moment now, Filch was going to pull aside the tapestry, expecting to see Peeves ... and there would be no Peeves ... but if he came up the stairs, he would spot the Marauder\rquote 
s Map ... and, Invisibility Cloak or not, the map would show \lquote Harry Potter\rquote  standing exactly where he was.
\par \lquote Egg?\rquote  Filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs. \lquote My sweet!\rquote  \endash  Mrs Norris was obviously with him \endash  \lquote This is a Triwizard clue! This belongs to a school champion!\rquote 
\par Harry felt sick; his heart was hammering very fast \endash 
\par \lquote PEEVES!\rquote  Filch roared gleefully. \lquote You\rquote ve been stealing!\rquote 
\par He ripped back the tapestry below, and Harry saw his horri\-ble pouchy face, and bulging, pale eyes staring up the dark and (to Filch) deserted staircase.
\par \lquote Hiding, are you?\rquote  he said softly. \lquote I\rquote m coming to get you, Peeves ... you\rquote ve gone and stolen a Triwizard clue, Peeves ... Dumbledore\rquote ll have you out of here for this, you filthy pilfer\-ing poltergeist ...\rquote 

\par Filch started to climb the stairs, his scrawny, dust-coloured cat at his heels. Mrs Norris\rquote s lamp-like eyes, so very like her master\rquote 
s, were fixed directly upon Harry. He had had occasion before now to wonder whether the Invisibility Cloak worked on cats ... sick with apprehension, he watched Filch drawing nearer and nearer in his old flannel dressing-gown \endash 
 he tried desperately to pull his trapped leg free, but it merely sank a few more inches \endash  any second now, Filch was going to spot the map or walk right into him \endash 
\par \lquote Filch? What\rquote s going on?\rquote 
\par Filch stopped a few steps below Harry, and turned. At the foot of the stairs stood the only person who could make Harry\rquote s situation worse \endash  Snape. He was wearing a long grey nightshirt and he looked livid.
\par \lquote It\rquote s Peeves, Professor,\rquote  Filch whispered malevolently. \lquote He threw this egg down the stairs.\rquote 
\par Snape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped beside Filch. Harry gritted his teeth, convinced his loudly thumping heart would give him away at any second ...
\par \lquote Peeves?\rquote  said Snape softly, staring at the egg in Filch\rquote s hands. \lquote But Peeves couldn\rquote t get into my office ...\rquote 
\par \lquote This egg was in your office, Professor?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course not,\rquote  Snape snapped, \lquote I heard banging and wailing \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Professor, that was the egg \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  I was coming to investigate \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  Peeves threw it, Professor \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and when I passed my office, I saw that the torches were lit and a cupboard door was ajar! Somebody has been search\-ing it!\rquote 
\par \lquote But Peeves couldn\rquote t \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I know he couldn\rquote t, Filch!\rquote  Snape snapped. \lquote I seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break!\rquote  Snape looked up the stairs, straight through Harry, and then down into the cor\-ridor below. \lquote 
I want you to come and help me search for the intruder, Filch.\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  yes, Professor \endash  but \endash \rquote 
\par Filch looked yearningly up the stairs, right through Harry, who could see that he was very reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering Peeves. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Go, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Harry pleaded with him silently, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 go with Snape ... go ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Mrs Norris was peering around Filch\rquote s legs ... Harry had the distinct impression that she could smell him ... why had he filled that bath with so much perfumed foam?
\par \lquote The thing is, Professor,\rquote  said Filch plaintively, \lquote the Headmaster will have to listen to me this time, Peeves has been stealing from a student, it might be my chance to get him thrown out of the castle once and for all \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote Filch, I don\rquote t give a damn about that wretched poltergeist, it\rquote s my office that\rquote s \endash \rquote

\par Snape stopped talking very abruptly. He and Filch both looked down at the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Mad-Eye Moody limp into sight through the narrow gap between their heads. Moody was wearing his old travelling cloak over his nigh
tshirt, and leaning on his staff as usual.
\par \lquote Pyjama party, is it?\rquote  he growled up the stairs.
\par \lquote Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor,\rquote  said Filch at once. \lquote Peeves the poltergeist, throwing things around as usual \endash  and then Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into his off\emdash \rquote 
\par \lquote Shut up!\rquote  Snape hissed to Filch.
\par Moody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Moody\rquote s magical eye travel over Snape, and then, unmistake\-ably, onto himself.
\par Harry\rquote s heart gave a horrible jolt. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Moody could see through Invisibility Cloaks }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 ... he alone could see the full strangeness of the scene ... Snape in his nightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, Harry, trapped in the stairs behind them. Moody\rquote s lop\-
sided gash of a mouth opened in surprise. For a few seconds, he and Harry stared straight into each other\rquote s eyes. Then Moody closed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon Snape again.
\par \lquote Did I hear that correctly, Snape?\rquote  he asked slowly. \lquote Someone broke into your office?\rquote 
\par \lquote It is unimportant,\rquote  said Snape coldly.
\par \lquote On the contrary,\rquote  growled Moody, \lquote it is very important. Who\rquote d want to break into your office?\rquote 
\par \lquote A student, I daresay,\rquote  said Snape. Harry could see a vein flickering horribly on Snape\rquote s greasy temple. \lquote It has happened before. Potion ingredients h
ave gone missing from my private store cupboard ... students attempting illicit mixtures, no doubt ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Reckon they were after potion ingredients, eh?\rquote  said Moody. \lquote Not hiding anything else in your office, are you?\rquote 
\par Harry saw the edge of Snape\rquote s sallow face turn a nasty brick colour, the vein in his temple pulsing more rapidly.
\par \lquote You know I\rquote m hiding nothing, Moody,\rquote  he said, in a soft and dangerous voice, \lquote as you\rquote ve searched my office pretty thor\-oughly yourself.\rquote 
\par Moody\rquote s face twisted into a smile. \lquote Auror\rquote s privilege, Snape. Dumbledore told me to keep an eye \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore happens to trust me,\rquote  said Snape, through clenched teeth. \lquote I refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office!\rquote 
\par \lquote  \rquote Course Dumbledore trusts you,\rquote  growled Moody. \lquote He\rquote s a trusting man, isn\rquote t he? Believes in second chances. But me \endash  I say there are spots that don\rquote t come off, Snape. Spots that never come off, d
\rquote you know what I mean?\rquote 
\par Snape suddenly did something very strange. He seized his left forearm convulsively with his right hand, as though some\-thing on it had hurt him.
\par Moody laughed. \lquote Get back to bed, Snape.\rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t have the authority to send me anywhere!\rquote  Snape hissed, letting go of his arm as though angry with himself. \lquote I have as much right to prowl this school after dark as you do!\rquote 
\par \lquote Prowl away,\rquote  said Moody, but his voice was full of menace. \lquote I look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time ... you\rquote ve dropped something, by the way ...\rquote 
\par With a stab of horror, Harry saw Moody point at the Marauder\rquote s Map, still l
ying on the staircase six steps below him. As Snape and Filch both turned to look at it, Harry threw caution to the winds; he raised his arms under the Cloak and waved furiously at Moody to attract his attention, mouthing, \lquote It\rquote s mine! }{

\par The map flew up into the air, slipped through Snape\rquote s out\-stretched fingers, and soared down the stairs into Moody\rquote s hand.
\par \lquote My mistake,\rquote  Moody said calmly. \lquote It\rquote s mine \endash  must\rquote ve dropped it earlier \endash \rquote 
\par But Snape\rquote s black eyes were darting from the egg in Filch\rquote s arms to the map in Moody\rquote s hand, and Harry could tell he was putting two and two together, as only Snape could ...
\par \lquote Potter,\rquote  he said quietly.
\par \lquote What\rquote s that?\rquote  said Moody calmly, folding up the map and pocketing it.
\par \lquote Potter!\rquote  Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at the place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him. \lquote That egg is Potter\rquote s egg. That piece of parch\-ment belong
s to Potter. I have seen it before, I recognise it! Potter is here! Potter, in his Invisibility Cloak!\rquote 
\par Snape stretched out his hands like a blind man, and began to move up the stairs; Harry could have sworn his overlarge nostrils were dilating, trying to sniff Harry out \endash  trapped, Harry leant backwards, trying to avoid Snape\rquote 
s fingertips, but any moment now \endash 
\par \lquote There\rquote s nothing there, Snape!\rquote  barked Moody. \lquote But I\rquote ll be happy to tell the Headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to Harry Potter!\rquote 
\par \lquote Meaning what?\rquote  snarled Snape, turning again to look at Moody, his hands still outstretched, inches from Harry\rquote s chest.
\par \lquote Meaning that Dumbledore\rquote s very interested to know who\rquote s got it in for that boy!\rquote  said Moody, limping nearer still to the foot of the stairs. \lquote And so am I, Snape ... very interested ...\rquote 
 The torchlight flickered across his mangled face, so that the scars, and the chunk missing from his nose, looked deeper and darker than ever.
\par Snape was looking down at Moody, and Harry couldn\rquote t see the expression on his face. For a moment, nobody moved or said anything. Then Snape slowly lowered his hands.
\par \lquote I merely thought,\rquote  said Snape, in a voice of forced calm, \lquote that if Potter was wandering around after hours again ... it\rquote s an unfortunate habit of his ... he should be stopped. For \endash  for his own safety.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, I see,\rquote  said Moody softly. \lquote Got Potter\rquote s best interests at heart, have you?\rquote 
\par There was a pause. Snape and Moody were still staring at each other. Mrs Norris gave a loud miaow, still peering around Filch\rquote s legs, looking for the source of Harry\rquote s bubble-bath smell.
\par \lquote I think I will go back to bed,\rquote  Snape said curtly.
\par \lquote Best idea you\rquote ve had all night,\rquote  said Moody. \lquote Now, Filch, if you\rquote ll just give me that egg \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Filch, clutching the egg as though it was his first\-born son. \lquote Professor Moody, this is evidence of Peeves\rquote s treach\-ery!\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s the property of the champion he stole it from,\rquote  said Moody. \lquote Hand it over, now.\rquote 
\par Snape swept downstairs and passed Moody without another word. Filch made a chirruping noise to M
rs Norris, who stared blankly at Harry for a few more seconds before turning and following her master. Still breathing very fast, Harry heard Snape walking away down the corridor; Filch handed Moody the egg, and disappeared from view too, muttering to Mrs
 Norris, \lquote Never mind, my sweet ... we\rquote ll see Dumbledore in the morning ... tell him what Peeves was up to ...\rquote 
\par A door slammed. Harry was left staring down at Moody, who placed his staff on the bottom-most stair, and started to climb laboriously towards him, a dull }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 clunk }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 on every other step.
\par \lquote Close shave, Potter,\rquote  he muttered.
\par \lquote Yeah ... I \endash  er ... thanks,\rquote  said Harry weakly.
\par \lquote What is this thing?\rquote  said Moody, drawing the Marauder\rquote s Map out of his pocket and unfolding it.
\par \lquote Map of Hogwarts,\rquote  said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
\par \lquote Merlin\rquote s beard,\rquote  Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye going haywire. \lquote This ... this is some map, Potter!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, it\rquote s ... quite useful,\rquote  Harry said. His eyes were starting to water from the pain. \lquote Er \endash  Professor Moody, d\rquote you think you could help me \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote What? Oh! Yes ... yes, of course ...\rquote 
\par Moody took hold of Harry\rquote s arms and pulled; Harry\rquote s leg came free of the trick step, and he climbed onto the one above it.
\par Moody was still gazing at the map. \lquote Potter ...\rquote  he said slowly, \lquote you didn\rquote t happen, by any chance, to see who broke into Snape\rquote s office, did you? On this map, I mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ... yeah, I did ...\rquote  Harry admitted. \lquote It was Mr Crouch.\rquote 
\par Moody\rquote s magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map. He looked suddenly alarmed.
\par \lquote Crouch?\rquote  he said. \lquote You\rquote re \endash  you\rquote re sure, Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote Positive,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well, he\rquote s not here any more,\rquote  said Moody, his eye still whizzing over the map. \lquote Crouch ... that\rquote s very \endash  very interest\-ing ...\rquote 
\par He said nothing for almost a minute, still staring at the map. Harry could tell that this news meant something to Moody, and very much wanted to know what it was. He wondered whether he dared ask. Moody scared him slightl
y ... yet Moody had just helped him avoid an awful lot of trouble ...
\par \lquote Er ... Professor Moody ... why d\rquote you reckon Mr Crouch wanted to look around Snape\rquote s office?\rquote 
\par Moody\rquote s magical eye left the map and fixed, quivering, upon Harry. It was a penetrating glare, and Harry had the impression that Moody was sizing him up, wondering whether to answer or not, or how much to tell him.
\par \lquote Put it this way, Potter,\rquote  Moody muttered finally, \lquote they say old Mad-Eye\rquote s obsessed with catching Dark wizards ... but Mad-Eye\rquote s nothing \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 nothing \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 compared to Barty Crouch.\rquote 
\par He continued to stare at the map. Harry was burning to know more.
\par \lquote Professor Moody?\rquote  he said again. \lquote D\rquote you think ... could this have anything to do with ... maybe Mr Crouch thinks there\rquote s something going on ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Like what?\rquote  said Moody sharply.
\par Harry wondered how much he dare say. He didn\rquote t want Moody to guess that he had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to tricky questions about Sirius.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  Harry muttered, \lquote odd stuff\rquote s been happening lately, hasn\rquote t it? It\rquote s been in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Daily Prophet ..}{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 . the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the Death Eaters and everything ...\rquote 
\par Both of Moody\rquote s mismatched eyes widened.
\par \lquote You\rquote re a sharp boy, Potter,\rquote  he said. His magical eye roved back to the Marauder\rquote s Map. \lquote Crouch could be thinking along those lines,\rquote  he said slowly. \lquote 
Very possible ... there have been some funny rumours flying around lately \endash  helped along by Rita Skeeter, of course. It\rquote s making a lot of people nervous, I reckon.\rquote  A grim smile twisted his lop-sided mouth. \lquote Oh, if there
\rquote s one thing I hate,\rquote  he muttered, more to himself than Harry, and his magical eye was fixed on the bottom left-hand corner of the map, \lquote it\rquote s a Death Eater who walked free ...\rquote 
\par Harry stared at him. Could Moody possibly mean what Harry thought he meant?
\par \lquote And now I want to ask }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 a question, Potter,\rquote 
 said Moody, in a more businesslike tone.
\par Harry\rquote s heart sank; he had thought this was coming. Moody was going to ask where he had got this map, which was a very dubious magical object \endash 
 and the story of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated not only him, but his own father, Fred and George Weasley, and Professor Lupin, their last Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Moody waved the map in front of Harry, who braced himself 
\endash 
\par \lquote Can I borrow this?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh!\rquote  said Harry. He was very fond of his map, but on the other hand, he was extremely relieved that Moody wasn\rquote t ask\-ing where he\rquote d got it, and there was no doubt that he owed Moody a favour. \lquote Yeah, OK.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good boy,\rquote  growled Moody. \lquote I can make good use of this ... this might be }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 exactly }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 what I\rquote ve been looking for ... right, bed, Potter, come on, now ...\rquote 
\par They climbed to the top of the stairs together, Moody still examining the map as though it was a treasure the like of which he had never seen before. They walked in silence to the door of Moody\rquote s office, where he stopped, and looked up at Harry. 
\lquote You ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, taken aback.
\par \lquote You want to consider it,\rquote  said Moody, nodding, and looking at Harry thoughtfully. \lquote Yes, indeed ... and incidentally ... I\rquote m guessing you weren\rquote t just taking that egg for a walk tonight?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  no,\rquote  said Harry, grinning. \lquote I\rquote ve been working out the clue.\rquote 
\par Moody winked at him, his magical eye going haywire again. \lquote Nothing like a night-time stroll to give you ideas, Potter ... see you in the morning ...\rquote  He went back into his office, staring down at the Marauder\rquote 
s Map again, and closed the door behind him.
\par Harry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in thoug
ht about Snape, and Crouch, and what it all meant ... Why was Crouch pretending to be ill, if he could manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to? What did he think Snape was concealing in his office?
\par And Moody thought he, Harry, ought to be an Auror! Interesting idea ... but as Harry got quietly into his four-poster ten minutes later, the egg and the Cloak now safely back in his trunk, he somehow thought he\rquote 
d like to check how scarred the rest of them were, before he chose it as a career.

\par He, Ron and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a table to themselves. They were supposed to be practising the opposite of the Summoning Charm today \endash  the Banishing Charm. Owing to the potential for nasty acci\-
dents when objects kept flying across the room, Professor Flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practise, the theory being that these wouldn\rquote t hurt anyone if they went off target. It was a good theory, but it wasn\rquote 
t working very well. Neville\rquote s aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room \endash  Professor Flitwick, for instance.
\par \lquote Just forget the egg for a minute, all right?\rquote  Harry hissed, as Professor Flitwick went whizzing resignedly past them, land\-ing on top of a large cabinet. \lquote I\rquote m trying to tell you about Snape and Moody ...\rquote

\par \lquote Well, I dunno if that\rquote s what Dumbledore asked him to do, but he\rquote s definitely doing it,\rquote  said Harry, waving his wand with\-out paying much attention, so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk. \lquote 
Moody said Dumbledore only lets Snape stay here because he\rquote s giving him a second chance or something ...\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Ron, his eyes widening, his next cushion spin\-ning high into the air, ricocheting off the chandelier and drop\-ping heavily onto Flitwick\rquote s desk. \lquote Harry ... maybe Moody thinks }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

e\rquote d loathed Harry\rquote s father when they had been at school together. Snape loved taking points from Harry, and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments, or even to suggest that he should be suspended from the school.

\par \lquote I don\rquote t care what Moody says,\rquote  Hermione went on, \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s not stupid. He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin, even though loads of people wouldn\rquote t have given them jobs, so why shouldn\rquote

 wish of hearing about anything odd at Hogwarts, Harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night, explaining all about Mr Crouch breaking into Snape\rquote s office, and Moody and Snape\rquote s conversation. Then Harry turned his attention in earnest
 to the most urgent problem facing him: how to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty-fourth of February.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again \endash 
 Harry had explained about aqualungs, and Ron could\-n\rquote t see why Harry shouldn\rquote t Sum
mon one from the nearest Muggle town. Hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that, in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to operate an aqualung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the Internati
onal Code of Wizarding Secrecy \endash  it was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an aqualung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts.
\par \lquote Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a submarine or something,\rquote  she said. \lquote If only we\rquote d done human Transfiguration already! But I don\rquote 
t think we start that until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you don\rquote t know what you\rquote re doing ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I don\rquote t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I s\rquote pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody, he might do it for me ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think he\rquote d let you choose what you wanted to be turned into, though,\rquote  said Hermione seriously. \lquote No, I think your best chance is some sort of charm.\rquote 
\par So Harry, thi
nking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a lifetime, buried himself once more among the dusty volumes, looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen. However, though he, Ron and Hermione searched thro
ugh their lunchtimes, evenings and whole weekends \endash  though Harry asked Professor McGonagall for a note of permission to use the Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable, vulture-like librarian, Madam Pince, for help \endash 
 they found nothing whatsoever that would enable Harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.
\par Familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb Harry now, and he was finding it difficult to concentrate in lessons again. The lake, which Harry had always taken for gran
ted as just another feature of the grounds, drew his eyes whenever he was near a classroom window, a great, iron-grey mass of chilly water, whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon.
\par Just as it had done before he had faced the 
Horntail, time was slipping away as though somebody had bewitched the clocks to go extra fast. There was a week to go before February the twenty-fourth (there was still time) ... there were five days to go (he was bound to find something soon) ... three d
ays to go (please let me find something ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 please ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 ).
\par With two days left, Harry started to go off food again. The only good thing about breakfast on Monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to Sirius. He pulled off the parch\-ment, unrolled it, 
and saw the shortest letter Sirius had ever written to him.

\rquote s shoulder. \lquote Here \endash  take my quill and send this owl back straight away.\rquote 
\par Harry scribbled the dates down on the back of Sirius\rquote  letter, tied it back onto the brown owl\rquote s leg, and watched it take flight again. What had he
 expected? Advice on how to survive underwater? He had been so intent on telling Sirius all about Snape and Moody, he had completely forgotten to mention the egg\rquote s clue.
\par \lquote What\rquote s he want to know about the next Hogsmeade week\-end for?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Dunno,\rquote  said Harry dully. The momentary happiness that had flared inside him at the sight of the owl had died. \lquote Come on ... Care of Magical Creatures.\rquote 
\par Whether Hagrid was trying to make up for the Blast-Ended Skrewts, or because there were now only two Skrewts left, or because he was trying to prove he could do anything that Professor Grubbly-Plank could, Harry didn\rquote

s he did about monsters, though it was clear that he found their lack of poisonous fangs disappointing.
\par Today he had managed to capture two unicorn foals. Unlike full-grown unicorns, they were pure gold. Parvati and Lavender went into transports of delight at the sight of them, and even Pansy Parkinson had to work hard to conceal how much she liked them.

\par \lquote Easier ter spot than the adults,\rquote  Hagrid told the class. \lquote They turn silver when they\rquote re abou\rquote  two years old, an\rquote  they grow horns at aroun\rquote  four. Don\rquote  go pure white \rquote til they\rquote

\par \lquote You OK, Harry?\rquote  Hagrid muttered, moving aside slightly, while most of the others swarmed around the baby unicorns.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Jus\rquote  nervous, eh?\rquote  said Hagrid.
\par \lquote Bit,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  said Hagrid, clapping a massive hand on his shoul\-der, so that Harry\rquote s knees buckled under its weight, \lquote I\rquote d\rquote ve bin worried before I saw yeh take on tha\rquote  Horntail, but I know now yeh can do anythin
\rquote  yeh set yer mind ter. I\rquote m not worried at all. Yeh\rquote re goin\rquote  ter be fine. Got yer clue worked out, haven\rquote  yeh?\rquote 
\par Harry nodded, but even as he did so, an insane urge to con\-fess that he didn\rquote t have any idea how to survive at the bottom of the lake for an hour came over him. He looked up at Hagrid \endash 
 perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes, to deal with the creatures in it? He looked after everything else in the grounds, after all \endash 
\par \lquote Yeh\rquote re goin\rquote  ter win,\rquote  Hagrid growled, patting Harry\rquote s shoul\-der again, so that Harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the muddy ground. \lquote I know it. I can feel it. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39

\par Harry\rquote s doubts vanished. Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the Gillyweed and put it into his pocket, then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels.
\par \lquote Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!\rquote  Dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor. \lquote Dobby will be missed \endash  good luck, Harry Potter, sir, good luck!\rquote 
\par \lquote See you later, Dobby!\rquote  Harry shouted, and he sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs, three at a time.
\par The Entrance Hall contained a few last-min
ute stragglers, all leaving the Great Hall after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch the second task. They stared as Harry flashed past, sending Colin and Dennis Creevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out into the brig
ht, chilly grounds.
\par As he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the dragons\rquote  enclosure in November were now ranged along the opposite bank, rising in stands that were packed to bursting point and reflected in the lake below; the exc
ited babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as Harry ran, flat out, around the other side of the lake towards the judges, who were sitting at another gold-draped table at the water\rquote 
s edge. Cedric, Fleur and Krum were beside the judges\rquote  table, watching Harry sprint towards them.
\par \lquote I\rquote m ... here ...\rquote  Harry panted, skidding to a halt in the mud and accidentally splattering Fleur\rquote s robes.
\par \lquote Where have you been?\rquote  said a bossy, disapproving voice. \lquote The task\rquote s about to start!\rquote 
\par Harry looked around. Percy Weasley was sitting at the judges\rquote  table \endash  Mr Crouch had failed to turn up again.
\par \lquote Now, now, Percy!\rquote  said Ludo Bagman, who was looking intensely relieved to see Harry. \lquote Let him catch his breath!\rquote 
\par Dumbledore smiled at Harry, but Karkaroff and Madame Maxime didn\rquote t look at all pleased to see him ... it was obvious from the looks on their faces that they had thought he wasn\rquote t going to turn up.
\par Harry bent over, hands on his knees, gasping for breath; he had a stitch in his side that felt as though he had a kni
fe between his ribs, but there was no time to get rid of it; Ludo Bagman was now moving among the champions, spacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet. Harry was on the very end of the line, next to Krum, who was wearing swimming trunks, and wa
s holding his wand ready.
\par \lquote All right, Harry?\rquote  Bagman whispered, as he moved Harry a few feet further away from Krum. \lquote Know what you\rquote re going to do?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  Harry panted, massaging his ribs.
\par Bagman gave his shoulder a quick squeeze, and returned to the judges\rquote  table; he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the World Cup, said }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote 
Sonorus!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 and his voice boomed out across the dark water towards the stands.
\par \lquote Well, all our champions are ready for the second task, which will start on my whistle. They have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them. On the count of three, then. One ... two ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par The whistle echoed shrilly in the cold, still air; the stands erupted with
 cheers and applause; without looking to see what the other champions were doing, Harry pulled off his shoes and socks, pulled the handful of Gillyweed out of his pocket, stuffed it into his mouth, and waded out into the lake.
\par The lake was so cold he felt 
the skin on his legs searing as though this was fire, not icy water. His sodden robes weighed him down as he walked in deeper; now the water was over his knees, and his rapidly numbing feet were slipping over silt and flat, slimy stones. He was chewing th
e Gillyweed as hard and fast as he could; it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery, like octopus tentacles. Waist-deep in the freezing water he stopped, swallowed, and waited for something to happen.
\par He could hear laughter in the crowd, and knew he must look 
stupid, walking into the lake without showing any sign of magical power. The part of him that was still dry was covered in goosepimples; half-immersed in the icy water, a cruel breeze lifting his hair, Harry started to shiver violently. He avoided looking
 at the stands; the laughter was becoming louder, and there were catcalls and jeering from the Slytherins ...
\par Then, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been clapped over his mouth and nose. He tried to draw breath, but it made his head spin; his lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck \endash 

\par Harry clapped his hands around his throat, and felt two large slits just below his ears, flapping in the cold air ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 he had gills. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Without pausing to think, he did the only thing that made sense \endash  he flung himself forwards into the water.
\par The first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life. His head had stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills, sending oxy\-
gen back to his brain. He stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at them. They looked green and ghostly under the water, and they had become webbed. He twisted around and looked at his bare feet \endash  they had become elongated and his 
toes were webbed, too; it looked as though he had sprouted flippers.
\par The water didn\rquote t feel icy any more, either ... on the contrary, he felt pleasantly cool, and very light ... Harry struck out once more, marvelling at how far and fast his flipper-like feet pro\-
pelled him through the water, and noticing how clearly he could see, and how he no longer needed to blink. He had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bot\-tom. He flipped over, and dived into its depths.
\par Silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange, dark, foggy landscape. He could only see ten feet around him, so that as he sped through the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the oncoming darkness: forests of rip\-
pling, tangled black weed, wide plains
 of mud littered with dull, glimmering stones. He swam deeper and deeper, out towards the middle of the lake, his eyes wide, staring through the eerily grey-lit water around him to the shadows beyond, where the water became opaque.
\par Small fish flickered pas
t him like silver darts. Once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him, but when he got nearer, he discovered it to be nothing but a large, blackened log, or a dense clump of weed. There was no sign of any of the other champions, me
rpeople, Ron \endash  nor, thankfully, the giant squid.
\par Light-green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see, two feet deep, like a meadow of very overgrown grass. Harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him, trying to discern shapes through the gloom ..
. and then, without warning, something grabbed hold of his ankle.
\par Harry twisted his body around and saw a Grindylow, a small, horned water demon, poking out of the weeds, its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry\rquote s leg, its pointed fangs bared \endash  Harry
 stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand \endash  by the time he had grasped it, two more Grindylows had risen out of the weed, had seized hand\-fuls of Harry\rquote s robes, and were attempting to drag him down.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Relashio!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Harry shouted,
 except that no sound came out ... a large bubble issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the Grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where it struck them, angry red patches appeared on their gr
een skin. Harry pulled his ankle out of the Grindylows\rquote 
 grip and swam as fast as he could, occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random; every now and then he felt one of the Grindylows snatch at his foot again, and kicked out, ha
rd; finally, he felt his foot connect with a horned skull, and look\-ing back, saw the dazed Grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while its fellows shook their fists at Harry, and sank back into the weed.
\par Harry slowed down a little, slipped his wand back in
side his robes and looked around, listening again. He turned full circle in the water, the silence pressing harder than ever against his eardrums. He knew he must be even deeper in the lake now, but nothing was moving except the rippling weed.
\par \lquote How are you getting on?\rquote 
\par Harry thought he was having a heart attack. He whipped around, and saw Moaning Myrtle floating hazily in front of him, gazing at him through her thick pearly glasses.
\par \lquote Myrtle!\rquote  Harry tried to shout \endash  but, once again, nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble. Moaning Myrtle actually giggled.
\par \lquote You want to try over there!\rquote  she said, pointing. \lquote I won\rquote t come with you ... I don\rquote t like them much, they always chase me when I get too close ...\rquote 
\par Harry gave her the thumbs-up to show his thanks, and set off once more, careful to swim a bit higher over the weed, to avoid any more Grindylows that might be lurking there.
\par He swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes. He was passing over vast expanses of black mud now, which swirled murkily as he disturbed the water. Then, at long last, he heard a snatch of haunting mer-song.

Harry swam faster, and soon saw a large rock emerge out of the muddy water ahead. It had paintings of merpeople on it; they were carrying spears, and chasing what looked like the giant squid. Harry swam on past the rock, following the mer-song.

A cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae loomed suddenly out of the gloom on all sides. Here and there at the dark windows, Harry saw faces ... faces that bore no resem\-blance at all to the painting of the mermaid in the Prefects\rquote 
 bathroom ...
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
The merpeople had greyish skins and long, wild, dark green hair. Their eyes were yellow, as were their broken teeth, and they wore thick ropes of pebbles around their necks. They le
ered at Harry as he swam past; one or two of them emerged from their caves to watch him better, their powerful, silver fishtails beating the water, spears clutched in their hands.
\par Harry sped on, staring around, and soon the dwellings became more numerous; 
there were gardens of weed around some of them, and he even saw a pet Grindylow tied to a stake outside one door. Merpeople were emerging on all sides now, watching him eagerly, pointing at his webbed hands and gills, talking behind their hands to each ot
her. Harry sped around a corner, and a very strange sight met his eyes.
\par A whole crowd of merpeople were floating in front of the houses that lined what looked like a mer-version of a village square. A choir of merpeople were singing in the middle, call\-ing 
the champions towards them, and behind them rose a crude sort of statue; a gigantic merperson hewn from a boul\-der. Four people were bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson.
\par Ron was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang. There was also a girl who looked no older than eight, whose clouds of sil\-very hair made Harry feel sure that she was Fleur Delacour\rquote 
s sister. All four of them appeared to be in a very deep sleep. Their heads were lolling onto their shoulders, and fine streams of bubbles kept issuing from their mouths.
\par Harry sped towards the hostages, half expecting the mer\-people to lower their spears and charge at him, but they did nothing. The ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick, slimy and very strong. For a fleeting second he
 thought of the knife Sirius had brought him for Christmas \endash  locked in his trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away, no use to him whatsoever.
\par He looked around. Many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying spears. He swam swiftly towards a seve
n-foot-tall merman with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs, and tried to mime a request to borrow the spear. The merman laughed and shook his head.
\par \lquote We do not help,\rquote  he said in a harsh, croaky voice.
\par \lquote Come }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 ON!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Harry said fiercely (but only bub
bles issued from his mouth), and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman, but the merman yanked it back, still shaking his head and laughing.
\par Harry swirled around, staring about. Something sharp ... anything ...
\par There were rocks littering the lake bottom. He dived and snatched up a particularly jagged one, and returned to the statue. He began to hack at the ropes binding Ron, and after several minutes\rquote  hard work, they broke apart. Ron floated, uncon\-
scious, a few inches above the lake bottom, drifting a little in the ebb of the water.
\par Harry looked around. There was no sign of any of the other champions. What were they playing at? Why didn\rquote t they hurry up? He turned back to Hermione, raised the jagged rock and began to hack at her bindings, too \endash 
\par At once, several pairs of strong grey hands seized him. Half-a-dozen mermen were pulling him away from Hermione, shak\-ing their green-haired heads and laughing.
\par \lquote You take your own hostage,\rquote  one of them said to him. \lquote Leave the others ...\rquote 
\par \lquote No way!\rquote  said Harry furiously \endash  but only two large bubbles came out.

\par Cho\rquote s head was on Hermione\rquote s shoulder; the small silver-haired girl was ghostly green and pale. Harry struggled to fight
 off the mermen, but they laughed harder than ever, holding him back. Harry looked wildly around. Where were the other champions? Would he have time to take Ron to the surface, and come back down for Hermione and the others? Would he be able to find them 
again? He looked down at his watch to see how much time was left \endash  it had stopped working.
\par But then the merpeople around him started pointing excited\-ly over his head. Harry looked up and saw Cedric swimming towards them. There was an enormous bubble around his head, which made his features look oddly wide and stretched.
\par \lquote Got lost!\rquote  he mouthed, looking panic-stricken. \lquote Fleur and Krum\rquote re coming now!\rquote 
\par Feeling enormously relieved, Harry watched Cedric pull a knife out of his pocket and cut Cho free. He pulled her upwards and out of sight.
\par Harry looked around, waiting. Where were Fleur and Krum? Time was getting short and, according to the song, the hostages would be lost after an hour ...
\par The merpeople started screeching excitedly. Those holding Harry loosened t
heir grip, staring behind them. Harry turned, and saw something monstrous cutting through the water towards them: a human body in swimming trunks with the head of a shark ... it was Krum. He appeared to have Transfigured himself \endash  but badly.
\par The shark-man swam straight to Hermione and began snap\-ping and biting at her ropes: the trouble was that Krum\rquote s new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin, and Harry was quite sure that if Krum wasn
\rquote t careful, he was going to ri
p Hermione in half. Darting forwards, Harry hit Krum hard on the shoulder, and held up the jagged stone. Krum seized it, and began to cut Hermione free. Within seconds, he had done it; he grabbed Hermione around the waist and, without a backward glance, b
egan to rise rapidly with her towards the surface.
\par Now what? Harry thought desperately. If he could be sure that Fleur was coming ... But still no sign. There was nothing for it ...
\par He snatched up the stone, which Krum had dropped, but the mermen now closed in around Ron and the little girl, shak\-ing their heads at him.
\par Harry pulled out his wand. \lquote Get out of the way!\rquote 
\par Only bubbles flew out of his mouth, but he had the distinct impression that the mermen had understood him, because they suddenly stopped laughing. Their yellowish eyes were fixed upon Harry\rquote 
s wand, and they looked scared. There might be a lot more of them than there were of him, but Harry could tell, by the looks on their faces, that they knew no more magic than the giant squid did.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve got until three!\rquote  Harry shouted; a great stream of bubbles burst from him, but he held up three fingers to make sure they got the message. \lquote One ...\rquote  (he put down a finger) \endash  \lquote two ...\rquote 
 (he put down a second) \endash 
\par They scattered. Harry darted forwards and began to hack at the robes binding the small girl to the statue; and at last she was free. He seized the little girl around the waist, grabbed the neck of Ron\rquote s robes, and kicked off from the bottom.
\par It was very slow work. He could no longer use his webbed hands to propel himself forwards; he worked his flippers furi\-ously, but Ron and Fleur\rquote 
s sister were like potato-filled sacks dragging him back down ... he fixed his eyes skywards, though he knew he must still be very deep, the water above him was so dark ...
\par Merpeople were rising with him. He could see them swirling around him with ease, watching him struggle through the water ... would they pull him back down to the depths when the time was up? Did they perhaps eat humans? Harry\rquote 
s legs were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming; his shoul\-ders were aching horribly with the effort of dragging Ron and the girl ...
\par He was drawing breath with extreme difficulty. He could feel pain on the sides of his neck again ... he was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in his mouth ... yet the dark\-
ness was definitely thinning now ... he could see daylight above him ...
\par He kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that they were nothing more than feet ... water was flooding through his mouth into his lungs ... he
 was starting to feel dizzy, but he knew light and air were only ten feet above him ... he had to get there ... he had to ...
\par Harry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as though his muscles were screaming in protest; his very brain felt water\-logged, he couldn\rquote t breathe, he needed oxygen, he had to keep going, he could not stop \endash 
\par And then he felt his head break the surface of the lake; won\-derful, cold, clear air was making his wet face sting; he gulped it down, feeling as though he had never breathed 
properly before, and, panting, pulled Ron and the little girl up with him. All around him, wild, green-haired heads were emerging out of the water with him, but they were smiling at him.
\par The crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise; shouting an
d screaming, everybody seemed to be on their feet; Harry had the impression they thought that Ron and the little girl might be dead, but they were wrong ... both of them had opened their eyes; the girl looked scared and confused, but Ron merely expelled a
 great spout of water, blinked in the bright light, turned to Harry and said, \lquote Wet, this, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  Then he spotted Fleur\rquote s sister. \lquote What did you bring her for?\rquote 
\par \lquote Fleur didn\rquote t turn up. I couldn\rquote t leave her,\rquote  Harry panted.
\par \lquote Harry, you prat,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote you didn\rquote t take that song thing seriously, did you? Dumbledore wouldn\rquote t have let any of us drown!\rquote 
\par \lquote But the song said \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Only to make sure you got back inside the time limit!\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I hope you didn\rquote t waste time down there acting the hero!\rquote 
\par Harry felt both stupid and annoyed. It was all very well for Ron; }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 he\rquote d }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

\par \lquote C\rquote mon,\rquote  Harry said shortly, \lquote help me with her, I don\rquote t think she can swim very well.\rquote 
\par They pulled Fleur\rquote s sister through the water, back towards the bank where the judges stood watching, twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of honour, singing their hor\-rible screechy songs.
\par Harry could see Madam Po
mfrey fussing over Hermione, Krum, Cedric and Cho, all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets. Dumbledore and Ludo Bagman stood beaming at Harry and Ron from the bank as they swam nearer, but Percy, who looked very white and somehow much younger than usua

\par \lquote She\rquote s fine!\rquote  Harry tried to tell her, but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk, let alone shout.
\par Percy seized Ron and was dragging him back to the bank (\lquote Gerroff, Percy, I\rquote m all right!\rquote ); Dumbledore and Bagman were pulling Harry upright; Fleur had broken free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister.
\par \lquote It was ze Grindylows ... zey attacked me ... oh, Gabrielle, I thought ... I thought ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Come here, you,\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey\rquote s voice; she seized Harry and pulled him over to Hermione and the others, wrapped him so
 tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he was in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat. Steam gushed out of his ears.
\par \lquote Harry, well done!\rquote  Hermione cried. \lquote You did it, you found out how, all by yourself!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well \endash \rquote  sai
d Harry. He would have told her about Dobby, but he had just noticed Karkaroff watching him. He was the only judge who had not left the table; the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that Harry, Ron and Fleur\rquote 
s sister had got back safely. \lquote Yeah, that\rquote s right,\rquote  said Harry, raising his voice slightly so that Karkaroff could hear him.
\par \lquote You haff a water-beetle in your hair, Herm-own-ninny,\rquote  said Krum.
\par Harry had the impression that Krum was drawing her atten\-tion back onto himself; perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake, but Hermione brushed the beetle away impatiently and said, \lquote You\rquote 
re well outside the time limit, though, Harry ... Did it take you ages to find us?\rquote 
\par \lquote No ... I found you OK ...\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s feeling of stupidity was growing. Now he was out of the water, it seemed perfectly clear that Dumbledore\rquote s safety precautions wouldn\rquote t have permitted the death of a hostage just because their champion hadn\rquote 
t turned up. Why hadn\rquote t he just grabbed Ron and gone? He would have been first back ... Cedric and Krum hadn\rquote t wasted time worrying about anyone else; they hadn\rquote t taken the mer-song seriously ...
\par Dumbledore was crouching at the water\rquote s edge, deep in con\-versation with what seemed to be the chief merperson, a par\-ticularly wi
ld- and ferocious-looking female. He was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water; clearly, Dumbledore could speak Mermish. Finally he straightened up, turned to his fellow judges and said, \lquote 
A conference before we give the marks, I think.\rquote 
\par The judges went into a huddle. Madam Pomfrey had gone to rescue Ron from Percy\rquote s clutches; she led him over to Harry and the others, gave him a blanket and some Pepper-Up Potion, then went to fetch Fleur and her sister. Fl
eur had many cuts on her face and arms, and her robes were torn, but she didn\rquote t seem to care, nor would she allow Madam Pomfrey to clean them.
\par \lquote Look after Gabrielle,\rquote  she told her, and then she turned to Harry. \lquote You saved \rquote er,\rquote  she said breathlessly. \lquote Even though she was not your \rquote ostage.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, who was now heartily wishing he\rquote d left all three girls tied to the statue.
\par Fleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek (he felt his face burn and wouldn\rquote t have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again), then said to Ron, \lquote And you, too \endash  you \rquote elped \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Ron, looking extremely hopeful, \lquote yeah, a bit \endash \rquote 
\par Fleur swooped down on him, too, and kissed him. Hermione looked simply furious, but just then, Ludo Bagman\rquote s magically magnified voice boomed out beside them, making them all jump, and causing the crowd in the stands to go very quiet.
\par \lquote Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our decision. Mer-chieftainess Murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake, and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions, as follows ...
\par \lquote Miss Fleur Delacour, though she demonstrated excellent use of the Bubble-Head Charm, was attacked by Grindylows as she approached her goal, and failed to retrieve her hostage. We award her twenty-five points.\rquote 
\par Applause from the stands.
\par \lquote I deserved zero,\rquote  said Fleur throatily, shaking her magnifi\-cent head.
\par \lquote Mr Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head Charm, was first to return with his hostage, though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour.\rquote 
 Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the crowd; Harry saw Cho give Cedric a glowing look. \lquote We therefore award him forty-seven points.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s heart sank. If Cedric had been outside the time limit, he most certainly had been.
\par \lquote Mr Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of Trans\-figuration, which was nevertheless effective, and was second to return with his hostage. We award him forty points.\rquote 
\par Karkaroff clapped particularly hard, looking very superior.
\par \lquote Mr Harry Potter used Gillyweed to great effect,\rquote  Bagman continued. \lquote 
He returned last, and well outside the time limit of an hour. However, the Merchieftainess informs us that Mr Potter was first to reach the hostages, and that the delay in his return was due t
o his determination to return all hostages to safety, not merely his own.\rquote 
\par Ron and Hermione both gave Harry half-exasperated, half-commiserating looks.
\par \lquote Most of the judges\rquote  \endash  and here, Bagman gave Karkaroff a very nasty look \endash  \lquote feel that this shows moral fibre and merits full marks. However ... Mr Potter\rquote s score is forty-five points.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s stomach leapt \endash  he was now tying for first place with Cedric. Ron and Hermione, caught by surprise, stared at Harry, then laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowd.
\par \lquote There you go, Harry!\rquote  Ron shouted over the noise. \lquote You weren\rquote t being thick after all \endash  you were showing moral fibre!\rquote 
\par Fleur was clapping very hard, too, but Krum didn\rquote t look very happy at all. He attempted to engage Hermione in conver\-sation again, but she was too busy cheering Harry to listen.
\par \lquote The third and final task will take place at dusk on the twenty-fourth of June,\rquote  continued Bagman. \lquote The champions will be notified of what is coming, precisely one month beforehand. Thank you all for your support of the champions.
\rquote 
\par It was over, Harry thought dazedly, as Madam Pomfrey began herding the champions and hostages back to the castle to get into dry clothes ... it was over, he had got through ... he didn\rquote t have 
to worry about anything now until June the twenty-fourth ...
\par Next time he was in Hogsmeade, he decided, as he walked back up the stone steps into the castle, he was going to buy Dobby a pair of socks for every day of the year.

One of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake, which meant that for once Ron was getting to share Harry\rquote s limelight. Harry noticed that Ron
\rquote s version of events changed subtly with every retelling. At first, he gave what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with Hermione\rquote s story, anyway \endash  Dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor McGonagall
\rquote s office, first assuri
ng them that they would be quite safe, and would awake when they were back above the water. One week later, however, Ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled single-handedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him
 into submission before tying him up.

 post because the owls kept being blown off course. The brown owl that Harry had sent to Sirius with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way; Harry had no sooner torn off

\par The dungeon rang with the Slytherins\rquote  laughter, and an unpleasant smile curled Snape\rquote s thin mouth. To Harry\rquote s fury, he began to read the article aloud.

\par Harry could feel his face burning now. Snape was pausing at the end of every sentence to allow the Slytherins a hearty laugh. The article sounded ten times worse when read by Snape.
\par \lquote ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Harry Potter\rquote s well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 How very touch\-ing,\rquote  sneered Snape, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins. \lquote Well, I think I had better sepa\-
rate the three of you, so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than your tangled love lives. Weasley, you stay here. Miss Granger, over there, beside Miss Parkinson. Potter \endash  that table in front of my desk. Move. Now.\rquote 
\par Furious, Harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron, and dragged it up to the front of the dunge
on to the empty table. Snape followed, sat down at his desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron. Determined not to look at Snape, Harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to have Snape\rquote s face.
\par \lquote All this press attention seems to have inflated your already overlarge head, Potter,\rquote  said Snape quietly, once the rest of the class had settled down again.
\par Harry didn\rquote t answer. He knew Snape was trying to provoke him; he had done this before. No doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points from Gryffindor before the end of the class.
\par \lquote You might be labouring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you,\rquote  Snape went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him (Harry continued to pound his sca
rab beetles, even though he had already reduced them to a very fine powder), \lquote but I don\rquote t care how many times your picture appears in the papers. To me, Potter, you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him.
\rquote 
\par Harry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his ginger roots. His hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his eyes down, as though he couldn\rquote t hear what Snape was saying to him.
\par \lquote So I give you fair warning, Potter,\rquote  Snape continued, in a softer and more dangerous voice, \lquote pint-sized celebrity or not \endash  if I catch you breaking into my office one more time \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I haven\rquote t been anywhere near your office!\rquote  said Harry angrily, forgetting his feigned deafness.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t lie to me,\rquote  Snape hissed, his fathomless black eyes boring into Harry\rquote s. \lquote Boomslang skin. Gillyweed. Both come from my private stores, and I know who stole them.\rquote 
\par Harry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink, or to look guilty. In truth, he hadn\rquote t stolen either of these things from Snape. Hermione had taken the Boomslang skin back in their second year \endash 
 they had needed it for the Polyjuice Potion \endash  and while Snape had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been able to prove it. Dobby, of course, had stolen the Gillyweed.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know what you\rquote re talking about,\rquote  Harry lied coldly.
\par \lquote You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into!\rquote  Snape hissed. \lquote 
I know it, Potter! Now, Mad-Eye Moody might have joined your fan club, but I will not tolerate your behaviour! One more night-time stroll into my office, Potter, and you will pay!\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots, \lquote I\rquote ll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there.\rquote 
\par Snape\rquote s eyes flashed. He plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes. For one wild moment, Harry thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him \endash  then he saw that Snape had drawn out a sm
all crystal bottle of a completely clear potion. Harry stared at it.
\par \lquote Do you know what this is, Potter?\rquote  Snape said, his eyes glit\-tering dangerously again.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, completely honestly this time.
\par \lquote It is Veritaserum \endash  a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,\rquote  said Snape viciously. \lquote 
Now, the use of this Potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that my hand }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 slips \endash \rquote  
}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 he shook the crystal bottle slightly \lquote \endash  right over your evening pumpkin juice. And then, Potter ... then we\rquote ll find out whether you\rquote 
ve been in my office or not.\rquote 
\par Harry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked up his knife and started slicing them again. He didn\rquote 
t like the sound of that Truth Potion at all, and nor would he put it past Snape to slip him some. He repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape did ... quite apart 
from landing a whole lot of people in trouble \endash  Hermione and Dobby, for a start \endash  there were all the other things he was concealing ... like the fact that he was in contact with Sirius ... and \endash  his insides squirmed at the thought 
\endash  how he felt about Cho ... He tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too, and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of Moody\rquote s book and start drinking only from a pri\-vate hip-flask.
\par There was a knock on the dungeon door.
\par \lquote Enter,\rquote  said Snape, in his usual voice.
\par The class looked around as the door opened. Professor Karkaroff came in. Everyone watched him as he walked up towards Snape\rquote s desk. He was twisting his finger around his goatee again, and looking agitated.
\par \lquote We need to talk,\rquote  said Karkaroff abruptly, when he had r
eached Snape. He seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was barely opening his lips; it was as though he was a rather poor ventriloquist. Harry kept his eyes on his ginger roots, listening hard.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff \endash \rquote  Snape muttered, but Karkaroff interrupted him.
\par \lquote I want to talk now, while you can\rquote t slip off, Severus. You\rquote ve been avoiding me.\rquote 
\par \lquote After the lesson,\rquote  Snape snapped.
\par Under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if he\rquote d poured out enough armadillo bile, Harry sneaked a side\-long glance at the pair of them. Karkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked angry.
\par Karkaroff hovered behind Snape\rquote s desk for the rest of the double period. He seemed intent on preventing Snape slippin
g away at the end of class. Keen to hear what Karkaroff wanted to say, Harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell, which gave him an excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of 
the class moved noisily towards the door.
\par \lquote What\rquote s so urgent?\rquote  he heard Snape hiss at Karkaroff.
\par \lquote This,\rquote  said Karkaroff, and Harry, peering around the edge of his cauldron, saw Karkaroff pull up the left-hand sleeve of his robe, and show Snape something on his inner forearm.
\par \lquote Well?\rquote  said Karkaroff, still making every effort not to move his lips. \lquote Do you see? It\rquote s never been this clear, never since \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Put it away!\rquote  snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping the classroom.
\par \lquote But you must have noticed \endash \rquote  Karkaroff began in an agitated voice.
\par \lquote We can talk later, Karkaroff!\rquote  spat Snape. \lquote Potter! What are you doing?\rquote 
\par \lquote Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor,\rquote  said Harry inno\-cently, straightening up and showing Snape the sodden rag he was holding.
\par Karkaroff turned on h
is heel and strode out of the dungeon. He looked both worried and angry. Not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry Snape, Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag, and left at top speed to tell Ron and Hermione what he had jus
t witnessed.

They left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun shining down upon the grounds. The weather was milder than it had been all year, and by the time they arrived in Hogsmeade, all three of them had taken off their cloaks and thrown them ov
er their shoulders. The food Sirius had told them to bring was in Harry\rquote s bag; they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs, a loaf of bread and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch table.

y had fun selecting all the most lurid socks they could find, including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars, and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly. Then, at half past one, they made their way up the High Street, pas
t Dervish and Banges, and out towards the edge of the village.
\par Harry had never been in this direction before. The winding lane was leading them out into the wild countryside around Hogsmeade. The cottages were fewer here, and their gardens larger; they were
 walking towards the foot of the mountain in whose shadow Hogsmeade lay. Then they turned a corner, and saw a stile at the end of the lane. Waiting for them, its front paws on the topmost bar, was a very large, shaggy black dog, which was carrying some ne
wspapers in its mouth, and looked very familiar ...
\par \lquote Hello, Sirius,\rquote  said Harry, when they had reached him.
\par The black dog sniffed Harry\rquote s bag eagerly, wagged its tail once, then turned, and began to trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground whi
ch rose to meet the rocky foot of the mountain. Harry, Ron and Hermione climbed over the stile and followed.
\par Sirius led them to the very foot of the mountain, where the ground was covered with boulders and rocks. It was easy for him, with his four paws, bu
t Harry, Ron and Hermione were soon out of breath. They followed Sirius higher, up onto the mountain itself. For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep, winding and stony path, following Sirius\rquote 
 wagging tail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder straps of Harry\rquote s bag cutting into his shoulders.
\par Then, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached the place where he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the rock. They squeezed into it, and found them\-selves in a cool, dimly lit cave. Tethere
d at the end of it, one end of his rope around a large rock, was Buckbeak the Hippogriff. Half-grey horse, half-giant eagle, Buckbeak\rquote 
s fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them. All three of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperiously
 for a moment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees, and allowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck. Harry, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just turned into his godfather.
\par Sirius was wearing ragged grey robes; the same ones he had been wearing when he had left Azkaban. His black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted once more. He looked very thin.
\par \lquote Chicken!\rquote  he said hoarsely, after removing the old }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Daily Prophets }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
from his mouth and throwing them down onto the cave floor.
\par Harry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread.
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sit\-ting down on the cave floor and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth. \lquote I\rquote ve been living off rats mostly. Can\rquote t steal too much food from Hogsmeade; I
\rquote d draw attention to myself.\rquote 
\par He grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin only reluctantly.
\par \lquote What\rquote re you doing here, Sirius?\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote Fulfilling my duty as godfather,\rquote  said Sirius, gnawing on the chicken bone in a very dog-like way. \lquote Don\rquote t worry about me, I\rquote m pretending to be a loveable stray.\rquote 
\par He was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in Harry\rquote s face, said more seriously, \lquote I want to be on the spot. Your last letter ... well, let\rquote s just say things are getting fishier. I\rquote 
ve been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out, and by the looks of things, I\rquote m not the only one who\rquote s getting worried.\rquote

\par \lquote Getting his comeuppance for sacking Winky, isn\rquote t he?\rquote  said Hermione coldly. She was stroking Buckbeak, who was crunching up Sirius\rquote  chicken bones. \lquote I bet he wishes he hadn\rquote t done it now \endash

\par \lquote Hermione\rquote s obsessed with house-elves,\rquote  Ron muttered to Sirius, casting Hermione a dark look.
\par Sirius, however, looked interested. \lquote Crouch sacked his house-elf?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup,\rquote  said Harry, and he launched into the story of the Dark Mark\rquote s appearance, and Winky being found with Harry\rquote s wand clutched in her hand, and Mr Crouch\rquote s fury.
\par When Harry had finished, Sirius was on his feet again, and had started pacing up and down the cave. \lquote Let me get this straight,\rquote  he said after a while, brandishing a fresh chicken leg. \lquote 
You first saw the elf in the Top Box. She was saving Crouch a seat, right?\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry, Ron and Hermione together.
\par \lquote But Crouch didn\rquote t turn up for the match?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I think he said he\rquote d been too busy.\rquote 
\par Sirius paced all around the cave in silence. Then he said, \lquote Harry, did you check your pockets for your wand after you\rquote d left the Top Box?\rquote 
\par \lquote Erm ...\rquote  Harry thought hard. \lquote No,\rquote  he said finally. \lquote I didn\rquote t need to use it before we got in the forest. And then I put my hand in my pocket, and all that was in there were my Omnioculars.\rquote 
 He stared at Sirius. \lquote Are you saying whoever conjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s possible,\rquote  said Sirius.
\par \lquote Winky didn\rquote t steal that wand!\rquote  said Hermione shrilly.
\par \lquote The elf wasn\rquote t the only one in that box,\rquote  said Sirius, his brow furrowed as he continued to pace. \lquote Who else was sitting behind you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Loads of people,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Some Bulgarian ministers ... Cornelius Fudge ... the Malfoys ...\rquote 
\par \lquote The Malfoys!\rquote  said Ron suddenly, so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave, and Buckbeak tossed his head nervously. \lquote I bet it was Lucius Malfoy!\rquote 
\par \lquote Anyone else?\rquote  said Sirius.
\par \lquote No one,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Yes, there was, there was Ludo Bagman,\rquote  Hermione remind\-ed him.
\par \lquote Oh, yeah ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know anything about Bagman, except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps,\rquote  said Sirius, still pacing. \lquote What\rquote s he like?\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s OK,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard Tournament.\rquote 
\par \lquote Does he, now?\rquote  said Sirius, frowning more deeply. \lquote I wonder why he\rquote d do that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Says he\rquote s taken a liking to me,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Hmm,\rquote  said Sirius, looking thoughtful.
\par \lquote We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared,\rquote  Hermione told Sirius. \lquote Remember?\rquote  she said to Harry and Ron.
\par \lquote Yeah, but he didn\rquote t stay in the forest, did he?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote The moment we told him about the riot, he went off to the camp\-site.\rquote 
\par \lquote How d\rquote you know?\rquote  Hermione shot back. \lquote How d\rquote you know where he Disapparated to?\rquote 
\par \lquote Come off it,\rquote  said Ron incredulously, \lquote are you saying you reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s more likely he did it than Winky,\rquote  said Hermione stub\-bornly.
\par \lquote Told you,\rquote  said Ron, looking meaningfully at Sirius, \lquote told you she\rquote s obsessed with house\emdash 
\par But Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron. \lquote When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered holding Harry\rquote s wand, what did Crouch do?\rquote 
\par \lquote Went to look in the bushes,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but there wasn\rquote t anyone else there.\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course,\rquote  Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, \lquote of course, he\rquote d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf ... and then he sacked her?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Hermione in a heated voice, \lquote he sacked her, just because she hadn\rquote t stayed in her tent and let herself get tram\-pled \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hermione, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 will}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  you give it a rest with the elf!\rquote  said Ron.
\par But Sirius shook his head and said, \lquote She\rquote s got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you want to know what a man\rquote s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.\rquote 
\par He ran a hand over his unshaven face, evidently thinking hard. \lquote All these absences of Barty Crouch\rquote s ... he goes to the trouble of making sure his house-elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn\rquote 
t bother to turn up and watch. He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament, and then stops coming to that, too ... it\rquote s not like Crouch. If he\rquote s ever taken a day off work because of illness before this, I\rquote ll eat Buckbeak.
\rquote 
\par \lquote D\rquote you know Crouch, then?\rquote  said Harry.
\par Sirius\rquote  face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as the night when Harry had first met him, the night when Harry had still believed Sirius to be a murderer.
\par \lquote Oh, I know Crouch all right,\rquote  he said quietly. \lquote He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban \endash  without a trial.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote What?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 said Ron and Hermione together.
\par \lquote You\rquote re kidding!\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote No, I\rquote m not,\rquote  said Sirius, taking another great bite of chick\-en. \lquote Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn\rquote t you know?\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione shook their heads.
\par \lquote He was tipped as the next Minister for Magic,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote He\rquote s a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully magical \endash  and power-hungry. Oh, never a Voldemort supporter,\rquote  he said, read\-ing the look on Harry
\rquote s face. \lquote No, Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark side. But then a lot of people who were against the Dark side ... well, you wouldn\rquote t understand ... you\rquote re too young ...\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s what my dad said at the World Cup,\rquote  said Ron, with a trace of irritation in his voice. \lquote Try us, why don\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par A grin flashed across Sirius\rquote  thin face. \lquote All right, I\rquote ll try you ...\rquote 
\par He walked once up the cave, back again, and then said, \lquote Imagine that Voldemort\rquote s powerful now. You don\rquote t know who his supporters are, you don\rquote t know who\rquote s working for him and who isn\rquote 
t; you know he can control people so that they do ter\-rible things without being able to stop themselves. You\rquote 
re scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends. Every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing ... the Ministry of Magic\rquote s in disarray, they don\rquote t know what to do, they\rquote re tryi
ng to keep everything hidden from the Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too. Terror everywhere ... panic ... confusion ... that\rquote s how it used to be.
\par \lquote Well, times like that bring out the best in some people, and the worst in others. Crouch\rquote s principles might\rquote ve been good in the beginning \endash  I wouldn\rquote 
t know. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemort\rquote s supporters. The Aurors were given new powers \endash  powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn\rquote 
t the only one who was handed straight to the Dementors with\-out trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorised the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark s
ide. He had his supporters, mind you \endash 
 plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamouring for him to take over as Minister for Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a ma
tter of time until Crouch got the top job. But then something rather unfortunate happened ...\rquote  Sirius smiled grimly. \lquote Crouch\rquote s own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who\rquote 
d managed to talk their way out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power.\rquote 
\par \lquote Crouch\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 son }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 was caught?\rquote  gasped Hermione.
\par \lquote Yep,\rquote  said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, and flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half. \lquote Nasty little shock for old Barty, I\rquote 
d imagine. Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family, shouldn\rquote t he? Ought to have left the office early once in a while ... got to know his own son.\rquote 
\par He began to wolf down large pieces of bread.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 his son a Death Eater?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote No idea,\rquote  said Sirius, still stuffing down bread. \lquote I was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in. This is mostly stuff I\rquote ve found out since I got out. The boy was definitely caught in the company of people I\rquote 
d bet my life were Death Eaters \endash  but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the house-elf.\rquote 
\par \lquote Did Crouch try and get his son off?\rquote  Hermione whispered.
\par Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark. \lquote Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the measure
 of him, Hermione? Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go, he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister for Magic. You saw him dismiss a devoted house-elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again \endash  doesn
\rquote t that tell you what he\rquote s like? Crouch\rquote s fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial and, by all accounts, it wasn\rquote 
t much more than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy ... then he sent him straight to Azkaban.\rquote 
\par \lquote He gave his own son to the Dementors?\rquote  asked Harry quietly.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Sirius, and he didn\rquote t look remotely amused now. \lquote I saw the Dementors bringing him in, watched them through the bars in my cell door. He can\rquote t have been more than nineteen. They took him 
into a cell near mine. He was scream\-ing for his mother by nightfall. He went quiet after a few days, though ... they all went quiet in the end ... except when they shrieked in their sleep ...\rquote 
\par For a moment, the deadened look in Sirius\rquote  eyes became more pronounced than ever, as though shutters had closed behind them.
\par \lquote So he\rquote s still in Azkaban?\rquote  Harry said.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Sirius dully. \lquote No, he\rquote s not in there any more. He died about a year after they brought him in.\rquote 
\par \lquote He }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 died?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par \lquote He wasn\rquote t the only one,\rquote  said Sirius bitterly. \lquote 
Most go mad in there, and plenty stop eating in the end. They lose the will to live. You could always tell when a death was coming, because the Dementors could sense it, they got excited. That boy looked pretty sickly when
 he arrived. Crouch being an impor\-
tant Ministry member, he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit. That was the last time I saw Barty Crouch, half carrying his wife past my cell. She died herself, apparently, shortly afterwards. Grief. Wasted away jus
t like the boy. Crouch never came for his son\rquote s body. The Dementors buried him outside the fortress, I watched them do it.\rquote 
\par Sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth, and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it.
\par \lquote So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made,\rquote  he continued, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. \lquote 
One moment, a hero, poised to become Minister for Magic ... next, his son dead, his wife dead, the family name dishonoured, and, so I\rquote ve
 heard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity. Once the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic towards him, and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray. The conclusion was that his father nev
er cared much for him. So Cornelius Fudge got the top job, and Crouch was shunted sideways into the Department of International Magical Co-operation.\rquote 
\par There was a long silence. Harry was thinking of the way Crouch\rquote s eyes had bulged as he\rquote d looked down at his disobedi\-
ent house-elf back in the wood at the Quidditch World Cup. This, then, must have been why Crouch had overreacted to Winky being found beneath the Dark Mark. It had brought back memories of his son, and the old scandal, and his fall from grace at
 the Ministry.
\par \lquote Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wiz\-ards,\rquote  Harry told Sirius.
\par \lquote Yeah, I\rquote ve heard it\rquote s become a bit of a mania with him,\rquote  said Sirius, nodding. \lquote If you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more Death Eater.\rquote 
\par \lquote And he sneaked up here to search Snape\rquote s office!\rquote  said Ron triumphantly, looking at Hermione.
\par \lquote Yes, and that doesn\rquote t make sense at all,\rquote  said Sirius.
\par \lquote Yeah, it does!\rquote  said Ron excitedly.
\par But Sirius shook his head. \lquote Listen, if Crouch wants to inves\-tigate Snape, why hasn\rquote t he been coming to judge the Tournament? It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to Hogwarts and keep an eye on him.\rquote 
\par \lquote So you think Snape could be up to something, then?\rquote  asked Harry, but Hermione broke in.
\par \lquote Look, I don\rquote t care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, come off it, Hermione,\rquote  said Ron impatiently, \lquote I know Dumbledore\rquote s brilliant and everything, but that doesn\rquote t mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn\rquote t fool him \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Why did Snape save Harry\rquote s life in the first year, then? Why didn\rquote t he just let him die?\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno \endash  maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you think, Sirius?\rquote  Harry said loudly, and Ron and Hermione stopped bickering to listen.
\par \lquote I think they\rquote ve both got a point,\rquote  said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at Ron and Hermione. \lquote Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here, I\rquote ve wondered why Dumbledore hired him. Snape\rquote 
s always been fascinated by the Dark Arts, he was famous for it at school. Slimy, oily, greasy-haired kid, he was,\rquote  Sirius added, and Harry and Ron grinned at each other. \lquote 
Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year and he was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters.\rquote 
\par Sirius held up his fingers, and began ticking off names. \lquote Rosier and Wilkes \endash  they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell. The Lestranges \endash  they\rquote re a married cou\-ple \endash  they\rquote 
re in Azkaban. Avery \endash  from what I\rquote ve heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he\rquote d been acting under the Imperius curse \endash  he\rquote 
s still at large. But as far as I know, Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater \endash  not that that means much. Plenty of them were never caught. And Snape\rquote s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep him\-self out of trouble.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Yeah, you should\rquote ve seen Snape\rquote s face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!\rquote  said Harry quickly. \lquote Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says Snape\rquote 
s been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really worried. He showed Snape something on his arm, but I couldn\rquote t see what it was.\rquote 
\par \lquote He showed Snape something on his arm?\rquote  said Sirius, look\-ing frankly bewildered. He ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair, then shrugged again. \lquote Well, I\rquote ve no idea what that\rquote s about ... but if Karkaroff
\rquote s genuinely worried, and he\rquote s going to Snape for answers ...\rquote 
\par Sirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of frus\-tration. \lquote There\rquote s still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people would\-n\rquote t, but I just can\rquote 
t see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he\rquote d ever worked for Voldemort.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snape\rquote s office, then?\rquote  said Ron stubbornly.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Sirius slowly, \lquote I wouldn\rquote t put it past Mad-Eye to have searched every single teacher\rquote s office when he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defence Against the Dark Arts serious\-ly, Moody. I\rquote m not sure }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 trusts anyone at all, and after the things he\rquote s seen, it\rquote 
s not surprising. I\rquote ll say this for Moody, though, he never killed if he could help it. Always brought people in alive where possible. He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters. Crouch, though ... he\rquote 
s a different matter ... is he really ill? If he is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to Snape\rquote s office? And if he\rquote s not ... what\rquote s he up to? What was he doing at the World Cup that was so important he didn\rquote 
t turn up in the Top Box? What\rquote s he been doing while he should have been judging the Tournament?\rquote 
\par Sirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall. Buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor, searching for bones he might have overlooked.
\par Finally, Sirius looked up at Ron. \lquote You say your brother\rquote s Crouch\rquote s personal assistant? Any chance you could ask him if he\rquote s seen Crouch lately?\rquote 
\par \lquote I can try,\rquote  said Ron doubtfully. \lquote Better not make it sound like I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy, though. Percy loves Crouch.\rquote 
\par \lquote And you might try and find out whether they\rquote ve got any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you\rquote re at it,\rquote  said Sirius, gesturing at the second copy of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Bagman told me they hadn\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Yes, he\rquote s quoted in the article in there,\rquote  said Sirius, nodding at the paper. \lquote Blustering on about how bad Bertha\rquote s memory is. Well, maybe she\rquote s changed since I knew her, but the Bertha I knew wasn\rquote 
t forgetful at all \endash  quite the reverse. She was a bit dim, but she had an excellen
t memory for gossip. It used to get her into a lot of trouble, she never knew when to keep her mouth shut. I can see her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic ... maybe that\rquote s why Bagman didn\rquote 
t bother to look for her for so long ...\rquote 
\par Sirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes. \lquote What\rquote s the time?\rquote 
\par Harry checked his watch, then remembered it hadn\rquote t been working since it had spent an hour in the lake.
\par \lquote It\rquote s half past three,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote You\rquote d better get back to school,\rquote  Sirius said, getting to his feet. \lquote Now, listen ...\rquote  he looked particularly hard at Harry \endash  \lquote I don\rquote 
t want you lot sneaking out of school to see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still want to hear about anything odd. But you\rquote re not to go leaving Hogwarts without permis\-sion, it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you.
\rquote 
\par \lquote No one\rquote s tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a couple of Grindylows,\rquote  Harry said.
\par But Sirius scowled at him. \lquote I don\rquote t care ... I\rquote ll breathe freely again when this Tournament\rquote s over, and that\rquote s not until June. And don\rquote t forget, if you\rquote 
re talking about me among yourselves, call me Snuffles, OK?\rquote 
\par He handed Harry the empty napkin and flask, and went to pat Buckbeak goodbye. \lquote I\rquote ll walk to the edge of the village with you,\rquote  said Sirius, \lquote see if I can scrounge another paper.\rquote 
\par He transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave, and they walked back down the mountainside with him, across the boulder-strewn ground, and back to the stile. Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head, before turn\-
ing and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village.
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione made their way back into Hogsmeade, and up towards Hogwarts.
\par \lquote Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch?\rquote  Ron said, as they walked up the drive to the castle. \lquote But maybe he doesn\rquote t care ... it\rquote d probably just make him admire Crouch even more. Yeah, Percy loves rules. He
\rquote d just say Crouch was refusing to break them for his own son.\rquote 
\par \lquote Percy would never throw any of his family to the Dementors,\rquote  said Hermione severely.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote If he thought we were standing in the way of his career ... Percy\rquote s really ambitious, you know ...\rquote 
\par They walked up the stone steps into the Entrance Hall, where the delicious smells of dinner wafted towards them from the Great Hall.
\par \lquote Poor old Snuffles,\rquote  said Ron, breathing deeply. \lquote He must really like you, Harry ... imagine having to live off rats.\rquote

The house-elves gave them a very cheery welcome, bowing and curtseying and bustling around making tea again. Dobby was ecstatic about his present.
\par \lquote Harry Potter is too good to Dobby!\rquote  he squeaked, wiping large tears out of his enormous eyes.
\par \lquote You saved my life with that Gillyweed, Dobby, you really did,\rquote  said Harry.

\par \lquote You\rquote ve just had breakfast!\rquote  said Hermione irritably, but a great silver platter of \'e9clairs was already zooming towards them, supported by four elves.
\par \lquote We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles,\rquote  Harry muttered.
\par \lquote Good idea,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Give Pig something to do. You could\-n\rquote t give us a bit of extra food, could you?\rquote  he said to the sur\-rounding elves, and they bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some more.
\par \lquote Dobby, where\rquote s Winky?\rquote  said Hermione, who was looking around.
\par \lquote Winky is over there by the fire, miss,\rquote  said Dobby quietly, his ears drooping slightly.
\par \lquote Oh dear,\rquote  said Hermione, as she spotted Winky.
\par Harry looked over at the fireplace, too. Winky was sitting on the same stool as last time, but she had al
lowed herself to become so filthy that she was not immediately distinguishable from the smoke-blackened brick behind her. Her clothes were ragged and unwashed. She was clutching a bottle of Butterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool, staring into the fi
re. As they watched her, she gave an enormous hiccough.
\par \lquote Winky is getting through six bottles a day now,\rquote  Dobby whispered to Harry.
\par \lquote Well, it\rquote s not strong, that stuff,\rquote  Harry said.
\par But Dobby shook his head. \lquote  \rquote Tis strong for a house-elf, sir,\rquote  he said.

drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off her stool onto the hearth, snoring loudly. The empty bottle of Butterbeer rolled away across the stone-flagged floor.
\par Half-a-dozen house-elves came hurrying forward, looking disgusted. One of them picked up the bottle, the others cov\-ered Winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly, hiding her from view.
\par \lquote We is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss!\rquote  squeaked a nearby elf, shaking his head and looking very ashamed. \lquote We is hoping you will not judge us all by Winky, sirs and miss!\rquote

\par \lquote Miss will please keep Dobby out of this,\rquote  Dobby mumbled, looking scared. The cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the house-elves around the kitchen. They were suddenly looking at Hermione as though she was mad and dangerous.
\par \lquote We has your extra food!\rquote  squeaked an elf at Harry\rquote s elbow, and he shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes and some fruit into Harry\rquote s arms. \lquote Goodbye!\rquote 
\par The house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron and Hermione, and began shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backs.
\par \lquote Thank you for the socks, Harry Potter!\rquote  Dobby called miser\-ably from the hearth, where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was Winky.
\par \lquote You couldn\rquote t keep your mouth shut, could you, Hermione?\rquote  said Ron angrily, as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them. \lquote They won\rquote t want us visiting them now! We could\rquote 
ve tried to get more stuff out of Winky about Crouch!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, as if you care about that!\rquote  scoffed Hermione. \lquote You only like coming down here for the food!\rquote 
\par It was an irritable sort of day after that. Harry got so tired of Ron and Hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that he took Sirius\rquote  food up to the Owlery that evening on his own.
\par Pigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the mountain by himself, so Harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls as well. When they had set off into the dusk, looking extremely odd carrying the large package betw
een them, Harry leaned on the windowsill, looking out at the grounds, at the dark, rustling treetops of the Forbidden Forest, and the rippling sails of the Durmstrang ship. An eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from Hagrid\rquote s chim\-
ney; it soare
d towards the castle, around the Owlery and out of sight. Looking down, Harry saw Hagrid digging energetically in front of his cabin. Harry wondered what he was doing; it looked as though he was making a new vegetable patch. As he watched, Madame Maxime e
merged from the Beauxbatons car\-
riage and walked over to Hagrid. She appeared to be trying to engage him in conversation. Hagrid leant upon his spade, but did not seem keen to prolong their talk, because Madame Maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterwards.
\par Unwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to Ron and Hermione snarling at each other, Harry watched Hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed him, and the owls around Harry began to awake, swooshing past him, into the night.

\par Hagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns, was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet. Harry\rquote s heart sank at the sight of the crates \endash 
 surely not another Skrewt hatching? \endash  but when he got near enough to see inside, he found himself look\-ing at a number of fluffy blac
k creatures with long snouts. Their front paws were curiously flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled at all the attention.
\par \lquote These\rquote re Nifflers,\rquote  said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around. \lquote Yeh find \rquote em down mines mostly. They like sparkly stuff ... there yeh go, look.\rquote 
\par One of the Nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite Pansy Parkinson\rquote s watch off her wrist. She shrieked and jumped backwards.
\par \lquote Useful little treasure detectors,\rquote  said Hagrid happily. \lquote Thought we\rquote d have some fun with \rquote em today. See over there?\rquote 
 He pointed at the large patch of freshly turned earth Harry had watched him digging from the Owlery window. \lquote I\rquote ve buried some gold coins. I\rquote ve got a prize fer whoever picks the Niffler that digs up most. Jus\rquote 
 take off all yer valuables, an\rquote  choose a Niffler an\rquote  get ready ter set \rquote em loose.\rquote 
\par Harry took off his watch, which he was only wearing out of habit, as it didn\rquote t work any more, and stuffed it in his pocket. Then he picked up a Niffler. It put its long snout in Harry\rquote 
s ear and sniffed enthusiastically. It was really quite cuddly.
\par \lquote Hang on,\rquote  said Hagrid, looking down into the crate, \lquote there\rquote s a spare Niffler here ... who\rquote s missin\rquote ? Where\rquote s Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote She had to go to the hospital wing,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll explain later,\rquote  Harry muttered; Pansy Parkinson was listening.
\par It was easily the most fun they had ever had in Care of Magical Creatures. The Nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though it was water, each scurrying back to the stu\-dent who had released it and spitting gold into their hands. Ron\rquote 
s was particularly efficient; it had soon filled his lap with coins.
\par \lquote Can you buy these as pets, Hagrid?\rquote  he asked excitedly, as his Niffler dived back into the soil, splattering his robes.
\par \lquote Yer mum wouldn\rquote  be happy, Ron,\rquote  said Hagrid, grinning, \lquote they wreck houses, Nifflers. I reckon they\rquote ve nearly got the lot now,\rquote  he added, pacing around the patch of earth, while the Nifflers continued to dive. 
\lquote I on\rquote y buried a hundred coins. Oh, there y\rquote are, Hermione!\rquote 
\par Hermione was walking towards them across the lawn. Her hands were very heavily bandaged and she looked miserable. Pansy Parkinson was watching her beadily.
\par \lquote Well, let\rquote s check how yeh\rquote ve done!\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Count yer coins! An\rquote  there\rquote s no point tryin\rquote  ter steal any, Goyle,\rquote  he added, his beetle-black eyes narrowed. \lquote It\rquote 
s leprechaun gold. Vanishes after a few hours.\rquote 
\par Goyle emptied his pockets, looking extremely sulky. It turned out that Ron\rquote s Niffler had been most successful,
 so Hagrid gave him an enormous slab of Honeydukes chocolate for a prize. The bell rang across the grounds for lunch; the rest of the class set off back to the castle, but Harry, Ron and Hermione stayed behind to help Hagrid put the Nifflers back in their
 boxes. Harry noticed Madame Maxime watching them out of her carriage window.
\par \lquote What yeh done ter your hands, Hermione?\rquote  said Hagrid, looking concerned.
\par Hermione told him about the hate mail she had received that morning, and the envelope full of Bubotuber pus.
\par \lquote Aaah, don\rquote  worry,\rquote  said Hagrid gently, looking down at her. \lquote I got some o\rquote  those letters an\rquote  all, after Rita Skeeter wrote abou\rquote  me mum. \'93Yeh\rquote re a monster an\rquote  yeh should be put down.\'94

\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Hermione, looking shocked.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Hagrid, heaving the Niffler crates over by his cabin wall. \lquote They\rquote re jus\rquote  nutters, Hermione. Don\rquote  open \rquote em if yeh get any more. Chuck \rquote em straigh\rquote  in the fire.\rquote 
\par \lquote You missed a really good lesson,\rquote  Harry told Hermione, as they headed back towards the castle. \lquote They\rquote re good, Nifflers, aren\rquote t they, Ron?\rquote 
\par Ron, however, was frowning at the chocolate Hagrid had given him. He looked thoroughly put out about something.
\par \lquote What\rquote s the matter?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Wrong flavour?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Ron shortly. \lquote Why didn\rquote t you tell me about the gold?\rquote 
\par \lquote What gold?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote The leprechaun gold I gave you for my Omnioculars. In the Top Box. Why didn\rquote t you tell me it disappeared?\rquote 
\par Harry had to think for a moment before he realised what Ron was talking about.
\par \lquote Oh ...\rquote  he said, the memory coming back to him at last. \lquote I dunno ... I never noticed it had gone. I was more worried about my wand, wasn\rquote t I?\rquote 
\par They climbed the steps into the Entrance Hall and went into the Great Hall for lunch.
\par \lquote Must be nice,\rquote  Ron said abruptly, when they had sat down and started serving themselves roast beef and Yorkshire pud\-dings. \lquote To have so much money you don\rquote t notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing.\rquote 
\par \lquote Listen, I had other stuff on my mind that night!\rquote  said Harry impatiently. \lquote We all did, remember?\rquote 
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t know leprechaun gold vanishes,\rquote  Ron muttered. \lquote I thought I was paying you back. You shouldn\rquote t\rquote ve given me that Chudley Cannon hat for Christmas.\rquote

\par Hermione hung back in their next Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson to ask Professor Moody something. The rest of the class were very eager to leave; Moody had given them such a rigorous test of hex-de

\par \lquote Well, Rita\rquote s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak!\rquote  Hermione panted five minutes later, catching up with Harry and Ron in the Entrance Hall and pulling Harry\rquote

\par Hermione, however, did not ask Harry and Ron to help her pursue vengeance against Rita Skeeter, for which they were both grateful, because their workload was mounting ever higher in the run-up to the Easter holidays. Harry frankly marvelled at the fact t
hat Hermione could research magical methods of eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to do. He was working flat out just to get through all their homework, though he made a point of sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain 
for Sirius; after last summer, he had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry. He enclosed notes to Sirius, telling him that nothing out of the ordinary had happened, and that they were still waiting for an answer from Percy.
\par Hedwig didn\rquote t return until the end of the Easter holidays. Percy\rquote s letter was enclosed in a package of Easter eggs that Mrs Weasley had sent. Both Harry\rquote s and Ron\rquote s were the size of drag\-

The start of the summer term would normally have meant that Harry was training hard for the last Quidditch match of the season. This year, however, it was the third and final task in the Triwizard Tournament for which he needed to prepare, but he still di
dn\rquote t know what he would have to do. Finally, in the last week of May, Professor McGonagall held him back in Transfiguration.

\rquote  she told him. \lquote Mr Bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task.\rquote 
\par So at half past eight that night, Harry left Ron and Hermione in Gryffindor Tower, and went downstairs. As he crossed the Entrance Hall, Cedric came up from the Hufflepuff common room.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you reckon it\rquote s going to be?\rquote  he asked Harry, as they went together down the stone steps, out into the cloudy night. \lquote Fleur keeps going on about underground tunnels, she reckons we\rquote ve got to find treasure.
\rquote 
\par \lquote That wouldn\rquote t be too bad,\rquote  said Harry, thinking that he would simply ask Hagrid for a Niffler to do the job for him.
\par They walked down the dark lawn to the Quidditch stadium, turned through a gap in the stands, and walked out onto the pitch.
\par \lquote What\rquote ve they done to it?\rquote  Cedric said indignantly, stopping dead.
\par The Quidditch pitch was no longer smooth and flat. It looked as though somebody had been building long, low walls all over it, twisting and criss-crossing in every direction.
\par \lquote They\rquote re hedges!\rquote  said Harry, bending to examine the nearest one.
\par \lquote Hello there!\rquote  called a cheery voice.
\par Ludo Ba
gman was standing in the middle of the pitch with Krum and Fleur. Harry and Cedric made their way towards them, climbing over the hedges. Fleur beamed at Harry as he came nearer. Her attitude to him had changed completely since he had pulled her sister ou
t of the lake.
\par \lquote Well, what d\rquote you think?\rquote  said Bagman happily, as Harry and Cedric climbed over the last hedge. \lquote Growing nicely, aren\rquote t they? Give them a month and Hagrid\rquote ll have them twenty foot high. Don\rquote t worry,\rquote 
 he added grinning, spotting the less-than-happy expressions on Harry and Cedric\rquote s faces, \lquote you\rquote ll have your Quidditch pitch back to normal once the task is over! Now, I imagine you can guess what we\rquote re making here?\rquote 

\par No one spoke for a moment. Then \endash 
\par \lquote Maze,\rquote  grunted Krum.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right!\rquote  said Bagman. \lquote A maze. The third task\rquote s really very straightforward. The Triwizard Cup will be placed in the centre of the maze. The first champion to touch it will receive full marks.\rquote 
\par \lquote We seemply \rquote ave to get through the maze?\rquote  said Fleur.
\par \lquote There will be obstacles,\rquote  said Bagman happily, bouncing on the balls of his feet. \lquote 
Hagrid is providing a number of creatures ... then there will be spells that must be broken ... all that sort of thing, you know. Now, the champions who are leading on points will get a head start into the maze.\rquote 
 Bagman grinned at Harry and Cedric. \lquote Then Mr Krum will enter ... then Miss Delacour. But you\rquote ll all be in with a fighting chance, depending on how well you get past the obstacles. Should be fun, eh?\rquote 
\par Harry, who knew only too well the kind of creatures that Hagrid was likely to provide for an event like this, thought it was unlikely to be any fun at all. However, he nodded politely like the other champions.
\par \lquote Very well ... if you haven\rquote t got any questions, we\rquote ll go back up to the castle, shall we, it\rquote s a bit chilly ...\rquote 
\par Bagman hurried alongside Harry as they began to wend their way out of the growing maze. Harry had the feeling that Bagman was going to start offering to help him again, but just then, Krum tapped Harry on the shoulder.
\par \lquote Could I haff a vord?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, all right,\rquote  said Harry, slightly surprised.
\par \lquote Vill you valk vith me?\rquote 
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Harry curiously.
\par Bagman looked slightly perturbed. \lquote I\rquote ll wait for you, Harry, shall I?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, it\rquote s OK, Mr Bagman,\rquote  said Harry, suppressing a smile, \lquote I think I can find the castle on my own, thanks.\rquote 
\par Harry and Krum left the stadium together, but Krum did not set a course for the Durmstrang ship. Instead, he walked towards the Forest.
\par \lquote What\rquote re we going this way for?\rquote  said Harry, as they passed Hagrid\rquote s cabin, and the illuminated Beauxbatons carriage.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t vant to be overheard,\rquote  said Krum shortly.
\par When at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground, a short way from the Beauxbatons\rquote  horses\rquote  paddock, Krum stopped in the shade of the trees and turned to face Harry.
\par \lquote I vant to know,\rquote  he said, glowering, \lquote vot there is between you and Hermy-own-ninny.\rquote 
\par Harry, who from Krum\rquote s secretive manner had expected something much more serious than this, stared up at Krum in amazement.
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  he said. But Krum glowered at him, and Harry, somehow struck anew by how tall Krum was, elaborated. \lquote We\rquote re friends. She\rquote s not my girlfriend and she never has been. It\rquote 
s just that Skeeter woman making things up.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hermy-own-ninny talks about you very often,\rquote  said Krum, looking suspiciously at Harry.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote because we\rquote re }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 friends.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 

\par He couldn\rquote t quite believe he was having this conversation with Viktor Krum, the famous international Quidditch player. It was as though the eighteen-year-old Krum thought he, Harry, was an equal \endash  a real rival \endash 
\par \lquote You haff never ... you haff not ...\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, very firmly.
\par Krum looked slightly happier. He stared at Harry for a few seconds, then said, \lquote You fly very well. I vos votching at the first task.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  said Harry, grinning broadly, and suddenly feeling much taller himself. \lquote I saw you at the Quidditch World Cup. The Wronski Feint, you really \endash \rquote 
\par But something moved behind Krum in the trees, and Harry, who had some experience of the sort of thing that lurked in the Forest, instinctively grabbed Krum\rquote s arm and pulled him around.
\par \lquote Vot is it?\rquote 
\par Harry shook his head, staring at the place where he\rquote d seen movement. He slipped his hand inside his robes, reaching for his wand.
\par Next moment a man had staggered out from behind a tall oak. For a moment, Harry didn\rquote t recognise him ... then he realised it was Mr Crouch.
\par He looked as though he had been travelling f
or days. The knees of his robes were ripped and bloody; his face scratched; he was unshaven and grey with exhaustion. His neat hair and moustache were both in need of a wash and a trim. His strange appearance, however, was nothing to the way he was behavi
n
g. Muttering and gesticulating, Mr Crouch appeared to be talking to someone that he alone could see. He reminded Harry vividly of an old tramp he had seen once when out shopping with the Dursleys. That man, too, had been conversing wildly with thin air; A
unt Petunia had seized Dudley\rquote s hand and pulled him across the road to avoid him; Uncle Vernon had then treated the family to a long rant about what he would like to do with beggars and vagrants.
\par \lquote Vosn\rquote t he a judge?\rquote  said Krum, staring at Mr Crouch. \lquote Isn\rquote t he vith your Ministry?\rquote 
\par Harry nodded, hesitated for a moment, then walked slowly towards Mr Crouch, who did not look at him, but continued to talk to a nearby tree: \lquote ... and when you\rquote ve done that, Weatherby, send an owl to Dumbledore confirming the number 
of Durmstrang students who will be attending the Tournament, Karkaroff has just sent word there will be twelve ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Mr Crouch?\rquote  said Harry cautiously.
\par \lquote ... and then send another owl to Madame Maxime, because she might want to up the number of students she\rquote s bringing, now Karkaroff\rquote s made it a round dozen ... do that, Weatherby, will you? Will you? Will ...\rquote  Mr Crouch\rquote 
s eyes were bulging. He stood staring at the tree, muttering soundlessly at it. Then he staggered sideways, and fell to his knees.
\par \lquote Mr Crouch?\rquote  Harry said loudly. \lquote Are you all right?\rquote 
\par Crouch\rquote s eyes were rolling in his head. Harry looked around at Krum, who had followed him into the trees, and was look\-ing down at Crouch in alarm.
\par \lquote Vot is wrong with him?\rquote 
\par \lquote No idea,\rquote  Harry muttered. \lquote Listen, you\rquote d better go and get someone \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore!\rquote  gasped Mr Crouch. He reached out and seized a handful of Harry\rquote s robes, dragging him closer, though his eyes were staring over Harry\rquote s head. \lquote I need ... see ... Dumbledore ...\rquote 
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote if you get up, Mr Crouch, we can go up to the \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve done ... stupid ... thing ...\rquote  Mr Crouch breathed. He looked utterly mad. His eyes were rolling and bulging, and a trickle of spittle was sliding down his chin. Every word he spoke seemed to cost him a terrible effort. \lquote 
Must ... tell ... Dumbledore ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Get up, Mr Crouch,\rquote  said Harry loudly and clearly. \lquote Get up, I\rquote ll take you to Dumbledore!\rquote 
\par Mr Crouch\rquote s eyes rolled forwards onto Harry.
\par \lquote Who ... you?\rquote  he whispered.
\par \lquote I\rquote m a student at the school,\rquote  said Harry, looking around at Krum for some help, but Krum was hanging back, looking extremely nervous.
\par \lquote You\rquote re not ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 his?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 whispered Crouch, his mouth sagging.

\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, without the faintest idea what Crouch was talking about.
\par \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Crouch was pulling him closer; Harry tried to loosen Crouch\rquote s grip on his robes, but it was too powerful.
\par \lquote Warn ... Dumbledore ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll get Dumbledore if you let go of me,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Just let go, Mr Crouch, and I\rquote ll get him ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you, Weatherby, and when you have done that, I would like a cup of tea. My wife and son will be arriving short\-ly, we are attending a concert tonight with Mr and Mrs Fudge.\rquote 
 Crouch was now talking fluently to a tree again, and seemed completely unaware that Harry was there, which surprised Harry so much he didn\rquote t notice that Crouch had released him. \lquote Yes, my son has recently gained twelve O.W.Ls, most satisfac
\-tory, yes, thank you, yes, very proud indeed. Now, if you could bring me that memo from the Andorran Minister for Magic, I think I will have time to draft a response ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You stay here with him!\rquote  Harry said to Krum. \lquote I\rquote ll get Dumbledore, I\rquote ll be quicker, I know where his office is \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He is mad,\rquote  said Krum doubtfully, staring down at Crouch, who was still gabbling to the tree, apparently convinced it was Percy.
\par \lquote Just stay with him,\rquote  said Harry, starting to get up, but his movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in Mr Crouch, who seized him hard around the knees and pulled Harry back to the ground.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t ... leave ... me!\rquote  he whispered, his eyes bulging again. \lquote I ... escaped ... must warn ... must tell ... see Dumbledore ... my fault ... all my fault ... Bertha ... dead ... all my fault ..
. my son ... my fault ... tell Dumbledore ... Harry Potter ... the Dark Lord ... stronger ... Harry Potter ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll get Dumbledore if you let me go, Mr Crouch!\rquote  said Harry. He looked furiously around at Krum. \lquote Help me, will you?\rquote 
\par Looking extremely apprehensive, Krum moved forward and squatted down next to Mr Crouch.
\par \lquote Just keep him here,\rquote  said Harry, pulling himself free of Mr Crouch. \lquote I\rquote ll be back with Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hurry, von\rquote t you?\rquote  Krum called after him, as Harry sprinted away from the Forest, and up t
hrough the dark grounds. They were deserted; Bagman, Cedric and Fleur had disappeared. Harry tore up the stone steps, through the oak front doors and off up the marble staircase, towards the second floor.
\par Five minutes later he was hurtling towards a stone gargoyle standing halfway along an empty corridor.
\par \lquote Sher-sherbet lemon!\rquote  he panted at it.
\par This was the password to the hidden staircase to Dumbledore\rquote s office \endash  or, at least, it had been two years ago. The password had evidently changed, however, for the s
tone gargoyle did not spring to life and jump aside, but stood frozen, glaring at Harry malevolently.
\par \lquote Move!\rquote  Harry shouted at it. \lquote C\rquote mon!\rquote 
\par But nothing at Hogwarts had ever moved just because he shouted at it; he knew it was no good. He looked up and down the dark corridor. Perhaps Dumbledore was in the staff room? He started running as fast as he could towards the staircase \endash 
\par \lquote POTTER!\rquote 
\par Harry skidded to a halt and looked around.
\par Snape had just emerged from the hidden staircase behind the stone gargoyle. The wall was sliding shut behind him even as he beckoned Harry back towards him. \lquote What are you doing here, Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote I need to see Professor Dumbledore!\rquote  said Harry, running back up the corridor and skidding to a standstill in front of Snape instead. \lquote It\rquote s Mr Crouch ... he\rquote s just turned up ... he\rquote s in the Forest ... he\rquote 
s asking \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What is this rubbish?\rquote  said Snape, his black eyes glittering. \lquote What are you talking about?\rquote 
\par \lquote Mr Crouch!\rquote  Harry shouted. \lquote From the Ministry! He\rquote s ill or something \endash  he\rquote s in the Forest, he wants to see Dumbledore! Just give me the password up to \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote The Headmaster is busy, Potter,\rquote  said Snape, his thin mouth curling into an unpleasant smile.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve got to tell Dumbledore!\rquote  Harry yelled.
\par \lquote Didn\rquote t you hear me, Potter?\rquote 
\par Harry could tell Snape was thoroughly enjoying himself, denying Harry the thing he wanted when he was so panicky.
\par \lquote Look,\rquote  said Harry angrily, \lquote Crouch isn\rquote t right \endash  he\rquote s \endash  he\rquote s out of his mind \endash  he says he wants to warn \endash \rquote 
\par The stone wall behind Snape slid open. Dumbledore was standing there, wearing long green robes, and a mildly curious expression.
\par \lquote Is there a problem?\rquote  he said, looking between Harry and Snape.
\par \lquote Professor!\rquote  Harry said, side-stepping Snape before Snape could speak. \lquote Mr Crouch is here \endash  he\rquote s down in the Forest, he wants to speak to you!\rquote 
\par Harry expected Dumbledore to ask questions but, to his relief, Dumbledore did nothing of the sort. \lquote Lead the way,\rquote  he said promptly, and he swept off along the corridor behind Harry, leaving Snape standing next to the gargoyle an
d looking twice as ugly.
\par \lquote What did Mr Crouch say, Harry?\rquote  said Dumbledore, as they walked swiftly down the marble staircase.
\par \lquote Said he wants to warn you ... said he\rquote s done something terrible ... he mentioned his son ... and Bertha Jorkins ... and \endash  and Voldemort ... something about Voldemort getting stronger ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Indeed,\rquote  said Dumbledore, and he quickened his pace as they hurried out into the pitch-darkness.
\par \lquote He\rquote s not acting normally,\rquote  Harry said, hurrying along beside Dumbledore. \lquote He doesn\rquote t seem to know where he is. He keeps talking like he thinks Percy Weasley\rquote

\par \lquote You did?\rquote  said Dumbledore sharply, and he began to take longer strides still, so that Harry was running to keep up. \lquote Do you know if anybody else saw Mr Crouch?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Krum and I were talking, Mr Bagman had just finished telling us about the third task, we stayed behind, and then we saw Mr Crouch coming out of the Forest \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Where are they?\rquote  said Dumbledore, as the Beauxbatons car\-riage emerged from the darkness.
\par \lquote Over here,\rquote  said Harry, moving in front of Dumbledore, leading the way through the trees. He couldn\rquote t hear Crouch\rquote s voice any more, but he knew where he was going; it hadn\rquote t bee
n much past the Beauxbatons carriage ... somewhere around here ...
\par \lquote Viktor?\rquote  Harry shouted.
\par No one answered.
\par \lquote They were here,\rquote  Harry said to Dumbledore. \lquote They were definitely somewhere around here ...\rquote

\par Its narrow beam travelled from black trunk to black trunk, illuminating the ground. And then it fell upon a pair of feet.
\par Harry and Dumbledore hurried forwards. Krum was sprawled on the Forest floor. He seemed to be unconscious. There was no sign at all of Mr Crouch. Dumbledore bent over Krum and gently lifted one of his eyelids.
\par \lquote Stunned,\rquote  he said softly. His half-moon glasses glittered in the wandlight as he peered around at the surrounding trees.
\par \lquote Should I go and get someone?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Madam Pomfrey?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Dumbledore swiftly. \lquote Stay here.\rquote 
\par He raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direc\-tion of Hagrid\rquote s cabin. Harry saw something silvery dart out of it and streak away through the trees like a ghostly bird. Then Dumbledore ben

\par \lquote He attacked me!\rquote  Krum muttered, putting a hand up to his head. \lquote The old madman attacked me! I vos looking around to see vare Potter had gone and he attacked from behind!\rquote 
\par \lquote Lie still for a moment,\rquote  Dumbledore said.
\par The sound of thunderous footfalls reached them, and Hagrid came panting into sight with Fang at his heels. He was carry\-ing his crossbow.
\par \lquote Professor Dumbledore!\rquote  he said, his eyes widening. \lquote Harry \endash  what the \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hagrid, I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote His student has been attacked. When you\rquote ve done that, kindly alert Professor Moody \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No need, Dumbledore,\rquote  said a wheezy growl, \lquote I\rquote m here.\rquote  Moody was limping towards them, leaning on his staff, his wand lit.
\par \lquote Damn leg,\rquote  he said furiously. \lquote Would\rquote ve been here quicker ... what\rquote s happened? Snape said something about Crouch \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Crouch?\rquote  said Hagrid blankly.
\par \lquote Karkaroff, please, Hagrid!\rquote  said Dumbledore sharply.
\par \lquote Oh yeah ... right y\rquote are, Professor ...\rquote  said Hagrid, and he turned and disappeared into the dark trees, Fang trotting after him.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know where Barty Crouch is,\rquote  Dumbledore told Moody, \lquote but it is essential that we find him.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m onto it,\rquote  growled Moody, and he raised his wand, and limped off into the Forest.
\par Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke again until they heard the unmistakeable sounds of Hagrid and Fang returning. Karkaroff was hurrying along behind them. He was wearing his sleek silver furs, and he looked pale and agitated.
\par \lquote What is this?\rquote  he cried, when he saw Krum on the ground, and Dumbledore and Harry beside him. \lquote What\rquote s going on?\rquote 
\par \lquote I vos attacked!\rquote  said Krum, sitting up now, and rubbing his head. \lquote Mr Crouch or votever his name \endash \rquote

\par \lquote Igor,\rquote  Dumbledore began, but Karkaroff had drawn himself up, clutching his furs around him, looking livid.
\par \lquote Treachery!\rquote  he bellowed, pointing at Dumbledore. \lquote It is a plot! You and your Ministry of Magic have lured me here under false pretences, Dumbledore! This is not an equal com\-petition! First you sneak Potter into the Tournament, t

\par Karkaroff spat onto the ground at Dumbledore\rquote s feet. In one swift movement, Hagrid seized the front of Karkaroff\rquote s furs, lifted him into the air, and slammed him against a nearby tree.
\par \lquote Apologise!\rquote  Hagrid snarled, as Karkaroff gasped for breath, Hagrid\rquote s massive fist at his throat, his feet dangling in mid-air.
\par \lquote Hagrid, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 no!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Dumbledore shouted, his eyes flashing.
\par Hagrid removed the hand pinning Karkaroff to the tree, and Karkaroff slid all the way down the trunk and slumped in a huddle at its roots; a few twigs and leaves showered down upon his head.
\par \lquote Kindly escort Harry back up to the castle, Hagrid,\rquote  said Dumbledore sharply.
\par Breathing heavily, Hagrid gave Karkaroff a glowering look. \lquote Maybe I\rquote d better stay here, Headmaster ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You will take Harry back to school, Hagrid,\rquote  Dumbledore repeated firmly. \lquote Take him right up to Gryffindor Tower. And Harry \endash  I want you to stay there. Anything you might want to do \endash  any owls you might want to send 
\endash  they can wait until morning, do you understand me?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  yes,\rquote  said Harry, staring at him. How had Dumbledore known that, at that very moment, he had been thinking about sending Pigwidgeon straight to Sirius, to tell him what had happened?
\par \lquote I\rquote ll leave Fang with yeh, Headmaster,\rquote  Hagrid said, still star\-ing menacingly at Karkaroff, who was still sprawled at the foot of the tree, tangled in furs and tree-roots. \lquote Stay, Fang. C\rquote mon, Harry.\rquote 
\par They marched in silence past the Beauxbatons carriage and up towards the castle.
\par \lquote How dare he,\rquote  Hagrid growled, as they strode past the lake. \lquote How dare he accuse Dumbledore. Like Dumbledore\rquote d do any\-thin\rquote  like that. Like Dumbledore wanted }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote I\rquote ll be havin\rquote  a few words with her, an\rquote  all,\rquote  said Hagrid grimly, stomping up the stairs. \lquote The less you lot \rquote ave ter do with these foreigners, the happier yeh\rquote ll be. Yeh can\rquote  trust any of

\par \lquote You were getting on all right with Madame Maxime,\rquote  Harry said, annoyed.

\rquote s comin\rquote  in the third task. Ha! You can\rquote  trust any of \rquote em!\rquote 
\par Hagrid was in such a bad mood
, Harry was quite glad to say goodbye to him in front of the Fat Lady. He clambered through the portrait hole into the common room, and hurried straight for the corner where Ron and Hermione were sitting, to tell them what had happened.

\par \lquote And Mr Crouch evaporated, did he?\rquote  said Hermione coldly.
\par \lquote Oh, yeah ...\rquote 
\par It was daybr
eak. Harry, Ron and Hermione had crept out of their dormitories very early, and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius. Now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds. All three of them were puffy-eyed and pale, because they h
ad been talking late into the night about Mr Crouch.
\par \lquote Just go through it again, Harry,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote What did Mr Crouch actually say?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve told you, he wasn\rquote t making much sense,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something. He defi\-
nitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins, and he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying stuff was his fault ... he mentioned his son.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 was}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133  his fault,\rquote  said Hermione testily.
\par \lquote He was out of his mind,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive, and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving him instructions.\rquote 
\par \lquote And ... remind me what he said about You-Know-Who?\rquote  said Ron tentatively.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve told you,\rquote  Harry repeated dully. \lquote He said he\rquote s getting stronger.\rquote 
\par There was a pause.
\par Then Ron said in a falsely confident voice, \lquote But he was out of his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just raving ...\rquote 
\par \lquote He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort,\rquote  said Harry, ignoring Ron\rquote s wince. \lquote He was having
 real trouble stringing two words together, but that was when he seemed to know where he was, and know what he wanted to do. He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par Harry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters. Half the many perches were empty; every now and then, another owl would swoop in through one of the win\-dows, returning from its night\rquote s hunting with a mouse in its beak.
\par \lquote If Snape hadn\rquote t held me up,\rquote  Harry said bitterly, \lquote we might\rquote ve got there in time. \'93The Headmaster is busy, Potter ... what\rquote s this rubbish, Potter?\'94 Why couldn\rquote t he have just got out of the way?
\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe he didn\rquote t want you to get there!\rquote  said Ron quickly. \lquote Maybe \endash  hang on \endash  how fast d\rquote you reckon he could\rquote ve got down to the Forest? D\rquote you reckon he could\rquote

\par \lquote Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Wouldn\rquote t put it past him,\rquote  Ron muttered.
\par \lquote We need to see Professor Moody,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote We need to find out whether he found Mr Crouch.\rquote 
\par \lquote If he had the Marauder\rquote s Map on him, it would\rquote ve been easy,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote because it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn\rquote t \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Shh!\rquote  said Hermione suddenly.
\par Somebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery. Harry could hear two voices arguing, coming closer and closer.
\par \lquote \endash  that\rquote s blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for that \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  we\rquote ve tried being polite, it\rquote s time to play dirty, like him. He wouldn\rquote t like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did \endash \rquote

\par \lquote Yeah, and you won\rquote t be complaining if we get a nice fat pay\-off, will you?\rquote 
\par The Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came over the threshold, then froze at the sight of Harry, Ron and Hermione.
\par \lquote What\rquote re you doing here?\rquote  Ron and Fred said at the same time.
\par \lquote Sending a letter,\rquote  said Harry and George in unison.
\par \lquote What, at this time?\rquote  said Hermione and Fred.
\par Fred grinned. \lquote Fine \endash  we won\rquote t ask you what you\rquote re doing, if you don\rquote t ask us,\rquote  he said.
\par He was holding a sealed envelope in his hands. Harry glanced at it, but Fred, whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted his hand so that the name on it was covered.
\par \lquote Well, don\rquote t let us hold you up,\rquote  he said, making a mock bow, and pointing at the door.
\par Ron didn\rquote t move. \lquote Who\rquote re you blackmailing?\rquote  he said.
\par The grin vanished from Fred\rquote s face. Harry saw George half glance at Fred, before smiling at Ron.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be stupid, I was only joking,\rquote  he said easily.
\par \lquote Didn\rquote t sound like that,\rquote  said Ron.
\par Fred and George looked at each other.
\par Then Fred said abruptly, \lquote I\rquote ve told you before, Ron, keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is. Can\rquote t see why you would, but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s my business if you\rquote re blackmailing someone,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote George\rquote s right, you could end up in serious trouble for that.\rquote 
\par \lquote Told you, I was joking,\rquote  said George. He walked over to Fred, pulled the letter out of his hands, and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl. \lquote You\rquote re starting to sound a bit like our d
ear older brother, you are, Ron. Carry on like this and you\rquote ll be made a Prefect.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I won\rquote t!\rquote  said Ron hotly.
\par George carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off.
\par He turned round and grinned at Ron. \lquote Well, stop telling peo\-ple what to do then. See you later.\rquote 
\par He and Fred left the Owlery. Harry, Ron and Hermione stared at each other.
\par \lquote You don\rquote t think they know something about all this, do you?\rquote  Hermione whispered. \lquote About Crouch and everything?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote If it was something that serious, they\rquote d tell someone. They\rquote d tell Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par Ron, however, was looking uncomfortable.
\par \lquote What\rquote s the matter?\rquote  Hermione asked him.
\par \lquote Well ...\rquote  said Ron slowly, \lquote I dunno if they would. They\rquote re ... they\rquote re obsessed with making money lately, I noticed it when I was hanging around with them \endash  when \endash  you know \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We weren\rquote t talking,\rquote  Harry finished the sentence for him. Yeah, but blackmail ...\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s this joke-shop idea they\rquote ve got,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I thought they were only saying it to annoy Mum, but they really mean it, they want to start one. They\rquote 
ve only got a year left at Hogwarts, they keep going on about how it\rquote s time to think about their future, and Dad can\rquote t help them, and they need gold to get started.\rquote 
\par Hermione was looking uncomfortable now. \lquote Yes, but ... they wouldn\rquote t do anything against the law to get gold. Would they?\rquote 
\par \lquote Wouldn\rquote t they?\rquote  said Ron, looking sceptical. \lquote I dunno ... they don\rquote t exactly mind breaking rules, do they?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, but this is the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 law,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 said Hermione, looking scared. \lquote 
This isn\rquote t some silly school rule ... they\rquote ll get a lot more than detention for blackmail! Ron ... maybe you\rquote d better tell Percy ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Are you mad?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Tell Percy? He\rquote d probably do a Crouch and turn them in.\rquote  He stared at the window through which Fred and George\rquote s owl had departed, then said, \lquote Come on, let\rquote 
s get some breakfast.\rquote 
\par \lquote D\rquote you think it\rquote s too early to go and see Professor Moody?\rquote  Hermione said, as they went down the spiral staircase.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote He\rquote d probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn, he\rquote ll think we\rquote re trying to attack him while he\rquote s asleep. Let\rquote s give it \rquote til break.\rquote 

\par History of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept checking Ron\rquote s watch, having finally discarded his own, but Ron\rquote s was moving so
 slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too. All three of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept; even Hermione wasn\rquote 
t taking her usual notes, but was sitting with her head on her hand, gazing at Professor Binns with her eyes out of focus.
\par When the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corri\-dors towards the Dark Arts classroom, and found Professor Moody leaving it. He looked as tired as they felt. The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving his face an even more lop\-
sided appearance than usual.
\par \lquote Professor Moody?\rquote  Harry called, as they made their way towards him through the crowd.
\par \lquote Hello, Potter,\rquote  growled Moody. His magical eye followed a couple of passing first-years, who sped up, looking nervous; it rolled into the back of Moody\rquote s head and watched them around the corner before he spoke again. \lquote 
Come in here.\rquote 
\par He stood back to let them into his empty classroom, limped in after them and closed the door.
\par \lquote Did you find him?\rquote  Harry asked, without preamble. \lquote Mr Crouch?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Moody. He moved over to his desk, sat down, stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan and pulled out his hip-flask.
\par \lquote Did you use the map?\rquote  Harry said.
\par \lquote Of course,\rquote  said Moody, taking a swig from his flask. \lquote Took a leaf out of your book, Potter. Summoned it from my office into the Forest. He wasn\rquote t anywhere on there.\rquote 
\par \lquote So he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 did }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Disapparate?\rquote  said Ron.

\lquote There are other ways he could have disappeared, aren\rquote t there, Professor?\rquote 
\par Moody\rquote s magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione.
\par \lquote You\rquote re another one who might think about a career as an Auror,\rquote  he told her. \lquote Mind works the right way, Granger.\rquote 
\par Hermione flushed pink with pleasure.
\par \lquote Well, he wasn\rquote t invisible,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote the map shows invis\-ible people. He must\rquote ve left the grounds, then.\rquote 
\par \lquote But under his own steam?\rquote  said Hermione eagerly. \lquote Or because someone made him?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, someone could\rquote ve \endash  could\rquote ve pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him, couldn\rquote t they?\rquote  said Ron quickly, look\-ing hopefully at Moody, as if he, too, wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror.

\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote d\rquote you reckon he\rquote s somewhere in Hogsmeade?\rquote 
\par \lquote Could be anywhere,\rquote  said Moody, shaking his head. \lquote Only thing we know for sure is that he\rquote s not here.\rquote 
\par He yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and his lop\-sided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth.
\par Then he said, \lquote Now, Dumbledore\rquote s told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators, but there\rquote s nothing you can do for Crouch. The Ministry\rquote ll be looking for him now, Dumbledore\rquote 
s notified them. Potter, you just keep your mind on the third task.\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Oh, yeah ...\rquote 
\par He hadn\rquote t given the maze a single thought since he\rquote d left it with Krum the previous night.
\par \lquote Should be right up your street, this one,\rquote  said Moody, look\-ing up at Harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin. \lquote From what Dumbledore\rquote s said, you\rquote ve managed to get through stuff like this plent

\par Moody grinned. \lquote Well, help him practise for this one, and I\rquote ll be very surprised if he doesn\rquote t win,\rquote  he said. \lquote In the meantime ... constant vigilance, Potter. Constant vigilance.\rquote 
 He took another long draught from his hip-flask, and his magical eye swivelled onto the window. The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was visible through it.
\par \lquote You two\rquote  \endash  his normal eye was on Ron and Hermione \endash  \lquote you stick close to Potter, all right? I\rquote m keeping an eye on things, but all the same ... you can never have too many eyes out.\rquote

\par The bell rang. They hastily shoved the cushions back into Flitwick\rquote s cupboard, and slipped out of the classroom.
\par \lquote See you at dinner!\rquote  said Hermione, and she set off for Arithmancy, while Harry and Ron
 headed towards North Tower, and Divination. Broad strips of dazzling gold sunlight fell across the corridor from the high windows. The sky outside was so brightly blue it looked as though it had been enamelled.
\par \lquote It\rquote s going to be boiling in Trelawney\rquote s room, she never puts out that fire,\rquote  said Ron, as they started up the staircase towards the silver ladder and the trapdoor.
\par He was quite right. The dimly lit room was swelteringly hot. The fumes from the perfumed fire were heavier than ever. Harry\rquote s head swam
 as he made his way over to one of the curtained windows. While Professor Trelawney was looking the other way, disentangling her shawl from a lamp, he opened it an inch or so and settled back in his chintz armchair, so that a soft breeze played across his
 face. It was extremely comfortable.
\par \lquote My dears,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, sitting down in her winged armchair in front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes, \lquote we have almost fin\-
ished our work on planetary divination. Today, however, will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of Mars, for he is placed most interestingly at the present time. If you will all look this way, I will dim the lights ...\rquote 
\par She waved her wand a
nd the lamps went out. The fire was the only source of light now. Professor Trelawney bent down, and lifted, from under her chair, a miniature model of the solar system, contained within a glass dome. It was a beautiful thing; each of the moons glimmered 
i
n place around the nine planets and the fiery sun, all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass. Harry watched lazily as Professor Trelawney began to point out the fascinating angle Mars was making with Neptune. The heavily perfumed fumes washed over
 him, and the breeze from the window played across his face. He could hear an insect humming gently somewhere behind the curtain. His eyelids began to droop ...
\par He was riding on the back of an eagle owl, soaring through the clear blue sky towards an old, ivy-covered house set high on a hillside. Lower and lower they flew, the wind blowing pleasantly in Harry\rquote 
s face, until they reached a dark and broken window in the upper storey of the house, and entered. Now they were flying along a gloomy passageway, to a room at the very end ... through the door they went, into a dark room whose windows were boarded up ...

\par Harry had left the owl\rquote s back ... he was watching, now, as it fluttered across the room, into a chair with its back to him ... there were two dark shapes on the floor beside the chair ... both of them were stirring ...
\par One was a huge snake ... the other was a man ... a short, balding man, a man with watery eyes and a pointed nose ... he was wheezing and sobbing on the hearth-rug ...
\par \lquote You are in luck, Wormtail,\rquote  said a cold, high-pitched voice from the depths of the chair in which the owl had landed. \lquote You are very fortunate indeed. Your blunder has not ruined every\-thing. He is dead.\rquote 
\par \lquote My Lord!\rquote  gasped the man on the floor. \lquote My Lord, I am ... I am so pleased ... and so sorry ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Nagini,\rquote  said the cold voice, \lquote you are out of luck. I will not be feeding Wormtail to you, after all ... but never mind, never mind ... there is still Harry Potter ...\rquote 
\par The snake hissed. Harry could see its tongue fluttering.
\par \lquote Now, Wormtail,\rquote  said the cold voice, \lquote perhaps one more little reminder why I will not tolerate another blunder from you ...\rquote 
\par \lquote My Lord ... no ... I beg you ...\rquote 
\par The tip of a wand emerged from the depths of the chair. It was pointing at Wormtail. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Crucio,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 said the cold voice.
\par Wormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve in his body was on fire, the screaming filled Harry\rquote s ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain; he was yelling, too ... Voldemort would hear him, would know he was there ...
\par \lquote Harry! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Harry!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par Harry opened his eyes. He was lying on the floor of Professor Trelawney\rquote s room with his hands over his face. His scar was still burning so badly that his eyes were watering. The pain had been real. The whole class was standing around him, and Ron 
was kneeling next to him, looking terrified.
\par \lquote You all right?\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote Of course he isn\rquote t!\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, looking thor\-oughly excited. Her great eyes loomed over Harry, gazing at him. \lquote What was it, Potter? A premonition? An apparition? What did you see?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  Harry lied. He sat up. He could feel himself shak\-ing. He couldn\rquote t stop himself looking around, into the shadows behind him; Voldemort\rquote s voice had sounded so close ...
\par \lquote You were clutching your scar!\rquote  said Professor Trelawney. \lquote You were rolling on the floor, clutching your scar! Come now, Potter, I have experience in these matters!\rquote 
\par Harry looked up at her.
\par \lquote I need to go to the hospital wing, I think,\rquote  he said. \lquote Bad headache.\rquote 
\par \lquote My dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordi\-nary clairvoyant vibrations of my room!\rquote  said Professor Trelawney. \lquote If you leave now, you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t want to see anything except a headache cure,\rquote  said Harry.
\par He stood up. The class backed away. They all looked unnerved.
\par \lquote See you later,\rquote  Harry muttered to Ron, and he picked up his bag and headed for the trapdoor, ignoring Professor Trelawney, who was wearing an expression of great frustration, as though she had just been denied a real treat.
\par When Ha
rry reached the bottom of her stepladder, however, he did not set off for the hospital wing. He had no intention whatsoever of going there. Sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again, and Harry was going to follow his advice: he was going s
traight to Dumbledore\rquote s office. He marched down the corridors, thinking about what he had seen in the dream ... it had been as vivid as the one which had awoken him in Privet Drive ... he ran over the details in his mind, try\-
ing to make sure he could remem
ber them ... he had heard Voldemort accusing Wormtail of making a blunder ... but the owl had brought good news, the blunder had been repaired, somebody was dead ... so Wormtail was not going to be fed to the snake ... he, Harry, was going to be fed to it
 instead ...
\par Harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore\rquote s office without noticing. He blinked, looked around, realised what he had done and retraced his steps, stopping in front of it. Then he remembered that he didn
\rquote t know the password.
\par \lquote Sherbet lemon?\rquote  he tried tentatively.
\par The gargoyle did not move.
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Harry, staring at it. \lquote Pear drop. Er \endash  Liquorice wand. Fizzing Whizzbee. Drooble\rquote s Best Blowing Gum. Bertie Bott\rquote s Every Flavour Beans ... oh no, he doesn\rquote 
t like them, does he? ... Oh, just open, can\rquote t you?\rquote  he said angrily. \lquote I really need to see him, it\rquote s urgent!\rquote 
\par The gargoyle remained immovable.
\par Harry kicked it, achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in his big toe.
\par \lquote Chocolate Frog!\rquote  he yelled angrily, standing on one leg. \lquote Sugar quill! Cockroach cluster!\rquote 
\par The gargoyle sprang to life, and jumped aside. Harry blinked.
\par \lquote Cockroach cluster?\rquote  he said, amazed. \lquote I was only joking ...\rquote 
\par He hurried through the gap in the walls, and stepped onto the foot of a spiral stone staircase, which moved slowly upwards as the doors closed behind him, taking him up to a polished oak door with a brass door-knocker.
\par He could hear voices from inside the office. He stepped off the moving staircase and hesitated, listening.
\par \lquote Dumbledore, I\rquote m afraid I don\rquote t see the connection, don\rquote t see it at all!\rquote  It was the voice of the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge. \lquote Ludo says Bertha\rquote 
s perfectly capable of getting herself lost. I agree we would have expected to have found her by now, but all the same, we\rquote ve no evidence of foul play, Dumbledore, none at all. As for her disappearance being linked with Barty Crouch\rquote s!
\rquote 
\par \lquote And what do you think\rquote s happened to Barty Crouch, Minister?\rquote  said Moody\rquote s growling voice.
\par \lquote I see two possibilities, Alastor,\rquote  said Fudge. \lquote Either Crouch has finally cracked \endash  more than likely, I\rquote m sure you\rquote ll agree, given his personal history \endash  lost his mind, and gone wandering off somewhere 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case, Cornelius,\rquote  said Dumbledore calmly.
\par \lquote Or else \endash  well ...\rquote  Fudge sounded embarrassed. \lquote Well, I\rquote ll reserve judgement until after I\rquote

\par \lquote Wait here for me, Harry,\rquote  he said. \lquote Our examination of the grounds will not take long.\rquote

l minutes, he sat and watched the old Headmasters and mistresses snoozing in their frames, thinking about what he had just heard, and running his fingers over his scar. It had stopped hurting now.
\par He felt much calmer, somehow, now he was in Dumbledore\rquote s of
fice, knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at the walls behind the desk. The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing on a shelf. A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword, with large rubies set into th
e hilt, which Harry recognised as the one he himself had pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged to Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry\rquote 
s house. He was gazing at it, remembering how it had come to his aid when he had th
ought all hope was lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the glass case. He looked around for the source of the light, and saw a sliver of silver white shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him, whose door
 had not been closed properly. Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then got up, walked across the office, and pulled the cabinet door open.
\par A shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge; runes and symbols that Harry did not recognise. The silvery light was coming from the basin\rquote 
s contents, which were like nothing Harry had ever seen before. He could not tell whether the substance was liquid or gas. It was a bright, whitish silver, and it was moving ceaselessly; the surface of it became r
uffled like water beneath wind, and then, like clouds, separated and swirled smoothly. It looked like light made liq\-uid \endash  or like wind made solid \endash  Harry couldn\rquote t make up his mind.
\par He wanted to touch it, to find out what it felt like, but nearly four years\rquote  experience of the magical world told him that stick\-
ing his hand into a bowl full of some unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do. He therefore pulled his wand out of the inside of his robes, cast a nervous look around the office, looked back at
 the contents of the basin, and prodded them. The surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fast.
\par Harry bent closer, his head right inside the cabinet. The sil\-very substance had become transparent; it looked like glass. He looked down into it, expecting to see the stone bottom of the basin \endash  and saw instead an enormous room below the sur\-
face of the mysterious substance, a room into which he seemed to be looking through a circular window in the ceiling.
\par The room was dimly lit; he thought it might even be under\-
ground, for there were no windows, merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated the walls of Hogwarts. Lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy substance, Harry saw that rows and r
ows of witches and wizards were sat around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in levels. An empty chair stood in the very cen\-
tre of the room. There was something about the chair that gave Harry an ominous feeling. Chains encircled the arms of it, as though its occupants were usually tied to it.
\par Where was this place? It surely wasn\rquote t Hogwarts; he had never seen a room like that here in the castle. Moreover, the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was composed of adults, and H
arry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at Hogwarts. They seemed, he thought, to be waiting for something; even though he could only see the tops of their pointed hats, they all seemed to be facing in one direction, and nobody was talking to an
ybody else.
\par The basin being circular, and the room he was observing square, Harry could not make out what was going on in the corners of it. He leant even closer, tilting his head, trying to see ...
\par The tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he was staring.
\par Dumbledore\rquote s office gave an almighty lurch \endash  Harry was thrown forwards and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin \endash 
\par But his head did not hit the stone bottom. He was falling through something icy cold and black; it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool \endash 
\par And suddenly, he found himself sitting on a bench at the end of the room inside the basin, a bench raised high above the others. He looked up at the high stone ceiling, expecting to see the circular window through which he had just been star\-
ing, but there was nothing there but dark, solid stone.
\par Breathing hard and fast, Harry looked around him. Not one of the witches and wizards in the room (and there were at least two hundr
ed of them) was looking at him. Not one of them seemed to have noticed that a fourteen-year-old boy had just dropped from the ceiling into their midst. Harry turned to the wizard next to him on the bench, and uttered a loud cry of sur\-
prise that reverberated around the silent room.
\par He was sitting right next to Albus Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Professor!\rquote  Harry said, in a kind of strangled whisper. \lquote I\rquote m sorry \endash  I didn\rquote t mean to \endash  I was just looking at that basin in your cabinet \endash  I \endash  where are we?\rquote 
\par But Dumbledore didn\rquote t move or speak. He ignored Harry completely. Like every other wizard on the benches, he was staring into the far corner of the room, where there was a door.
\par Harry gazed, nonplussed, at Dumbledore, then around at the silently watchful crowd, then back at Dumbledore. And then it dawned on him ...
\par Once before, Harry had found himself a place where nobody could see or hear him. That time, he had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary, right into somebody else\rquote s memory ... and unless he was very much mistaken
, something of the sort had happened again ...
\par Harry raised his right hand, hesitated, and then waved it energetically in front of Dumbledore\rquote s face. Dumbledore did not blink, look around at Harry, or indeed move at all. And that, in Harry\rquote s opinion, settled the matter. Dumbledore would
\-n\rquote t ignore him like that. He was inside a memory, and this was not the present-day Dumbledore. Yet it couldn\rquote t be that long ago ... the Dumbledore sitting next to him now was silver-haired, just like the present-day Dumbledo
re. But what was this place? What were all these wizards waiting for?
\par Harry looked around more carefully. The room, as he had suspected when observing it from above, was almost certainly underground \endash  more of a dungeon than a room, he thought. There was a 
bleak and forbidding air about the place; there were no pictures on the walls, no decorations at all; just these serried rows of benches, rising in levels all around the room, all positioned so that they had a clear view of that chair with the chains on i
ts arms.
\par Before Harry could reach any conclusions about the place in which they were, he heard footsteps. The door in the corner of the dungeon opened, and three people entered \endash  or at least, one man, flanked by two Dementors.
\par Harry\rquote s insides went cold. The Dementors, tall, hooded crea\-tures whose faces were concealed, were gliding slowly towards the chair in the centre of the room, each grasping one of the man\rquote 
s arms with their dead and rotten-looking hands. The man between them looked as though he was about to faint, and Harry couldn\rquote 
t blame him ... he knew the Dementors could not touch him inside a memory, but Harry remembered their power only too well. The watching crowd recoiled slightly as the Dementors placed the man in the chained chair and glided bac
k out of the room. The door swung shut behind them.
\par Harry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair, and saw that it was Karkaroff.
\par Unlike Dumbledore, Karkaroff looked much younger; his hair and goatee were black. He was not dressed in sleek furs, bu
t in thin and ragged robes. He was shaking. Even as Harry watched, the chains on the arms of the chair glowed suddenly gold, and snaked their way up his arms, binding him there.
\par \lquote Igor Karkaroff,\rquote  said a curt voice to Harry\rquote s left. Harry looked around, and saw Mr Crouch standing up in the middle of the bench beside him. Crouch\rquote s hair was dark, his face was much less lined, he looked fit and alert. 
\lquote You have been brought from Azkaban to give evidence to the Ministry of Magic. You have given us to understand that you have impor\-tant information for us.\rquote 
\par Karkaroff straightened himself as best he could, tightly bound to the chair.
\par \lquote I have, sir,\rquote  he said, and although his voice was very scared, Harry could still hear the familiar unctuous note in it. \lquote I wish to be of use to the Ministry. I wish to help. I \endash  I know that the Ministry is trying to \endash 
 to round up the last of the Dark Lord\rquote s supporters. I am eager to assist in any way I can ...\rquote 
\par There was a murmur around the benches. Some of the wiz\-ards and witches were surveying Karkaroff with interest, others with pronounced mistrust. Then Harry heard, quite distinctly, from Dumbledore\rquote s other side, a familiar, growling voice say\-
ing, \lquote Filth.\rquote 
\par Harry leant forwards so that he could see past Dumbledore. Mad-Eye Moody was sitting there \endash 
 though there was a very noticeable difference in his appearance. He did not have his magical eye, but two normal ones. Both were looking down upon Karkaroff, and both were narrowed in intense dislike.
\par \lquote Crouch is going to let him out,\rquote  Moody breathed quietly to Dumbledore. \lquote He\rquote s done a deal with him. Took me six months to track him down, and Crouch is going to let him go if he\rquote s got enough new names. Let\rquote 
s hear his information, I say, and throw him straight back to the Dementors.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore made a small noise of dissent through his long, crooked nose.
\par \lquote Ah, I was forgetting ... you don\rquote t like the Dementors, do you, Albus?\rquote  said Moody, with a sardonic smile.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Dumbledore calmly, \lquote I\rquote m afraid I don\rquote t. I have long felt the Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures.\rquote 
\par \lquote But for filth like this ...\rquote  Moody said softly.
\par \lquote You say you have names for us, Karkaroff,\rquote  said Mr Crouch. \lquote Let us hear them, please.\rquote 
\par \lquote You must understand,\rquote  said Karkaroff hurriedly, \lquote that He Who Must Not Be Named operated always in the greatest secrecy ... he preferred that we \endash  I mean to say, his supporters \endash 
 and I regret now, very deeply, that I ever counted myself among them \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Get on with it,\rquote  sneered Moody.
\par \lquote \endash  we never knew the names of every one of our fellows \endash  he alone knew exactly who we all were \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Which was a wise move, wasn\rquote t it, as it prevented someone like you, Karkaroff, turning all of them in,\rquote  muttered Moody.
\par \lquote Yet you say you have }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 some }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 names for us?\rquote  said Mr Crouch.
\par \lquote I \endash  I do,\rquote  said Karkaroff breathlessly. \lquote And these were impor\-
tant supporters, mark you. People I saw with my own eyes doing his bidding. I give this information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him, and am filled with a remorse so deep I can barely \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote These names are?\rquote  said Mr Crouch sharply.
\par Karkaroff drew a deep breath.
\par \lquote There was Antonin Dolohov,\rquote  he said. \lquote I \endash  I saw him torture countless Muggles and \endash  and non-supporters of the Dark Lord.\rquote 
\par \lquote And helped him do it,\rquote  murmured Moody.
\par \lquote We have already apprehended Dolohov,\rquote  said Crouch. \lquote He was caught shortly after yourself.\rquote 
\par \lquote Indeed?\rquote  said Karkaroff, his eyes widening. \lquote I \endash  I am delight\-ed to hear it!\rquote 
\par But he didn\rquote t look it. Harry could tell that this news had come as a real blow to him. One of his names was worthless.
\par \lquote Any others?\rquote  said Crouch coldly.
\par \lquote Why, yes ... there was Rosier,\rquote  said Karkaroff hurriedly. \lquote Evan Rosier.\rquote 
\par \lquote Rosier is dead,\rquote  said Crouch. \lquote He was caught shortly after you were, too. He preferred to fight rather than coming quietly, and was killed in the struggle.\rquote 
\par \lquote Took a bit of me with him, though,\rquote  whispered Moody to Harry\rquote s right. Harry looked around at him once more, and saw him indicating the large chunk out of his nose to Dumbledore.
\par \lquote No \endash  no more than Rosier deserved!\rquote  said Karkaroff, a real note of panic in his voice now. Harry could see that he was starting to worry that none of his information would be any use to the Ministry. Karkaroff\rquote 
s eyes darted towards the door in the corner, behind which the Dementors undoubtedly still stood, waiting.
\par \lquote Any more?\rquote  said Crouch.
\par \lquote Yes!\rquote  said Karkaroff. \lquote There was Travers \endash  he helped murder the McKinnons! Mulciber \endash  he specialised in the Imperius curse, forced countless people to do horrific things! Rookwood, who was a spy, and passed He Who
 Must Not Be Named useful information from inside the Ministry itself!\rquote 
\par Harry could tell that, this time, Karkaroff had struck gold. The watching crowd were all murmuring together.
\par \lquote Rookwood?\rquote  said Mr Crouch, nodding to a witch sitting in front of him, who began scribbling upon her piece of parch\-ment. \lquote Augustus Rookwood of the Department of Mysteries?\rquote 
\par \lquote The very same,\rquote  said Karkaroff eagerly. \lquote I believe he used a network of well-placed wizards, both inside the Ministry and out, to collect information \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But Travers and Mulciber, we have,\rquote  said Mr Crouch. \lquote Very well, Karkaroff, if that is all, you will be returned to Azkaban while we decide \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Not yet!\rquote  cried Karkaroff, looking quite desperate. \lquote Wait, I have more!\rquote 
\par Harry could see him sweating in the torchlight, his white skin contrasting strongly with the black of his hair and beard.
\par \lquote Snape!\rquote  he shouted. \lquote Severus Snape!\rquote 
\par \lquote Snape has been cleared by this council,\rquote  said Crouch coldly. \lquote He has been vouched for by Albus Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote No!\rquote  shouted Karkaroff, straining at the chains which bound him to the chair. \lquote I assure you! Severus Snape is a Death Eater!\rquote 
\par Dumbledore had got to his feet. \lquote I have given evidence already on this matter,\rquote  he said calmly. \lquote Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater. However, he rejoined our side before Lord Voldemort\rquote 
s downfall and turned spy for us, at great per\-sonal risk. He is now no more a Death Eater than I am.\rquote 
\par Harry turned to look at Mad-Eye Moody. He was wearing a look of deep scepticism behind Dumbledore\rquote s back.
\par \lquote Very well, Karkaroff,\rquote  Crouch said coldly, \lquote you have been of assistance. I shall review your case. You will return to Azkaban in the meantime ...\rquote 
\par Mr Crouch\rquote s voice faded. Harry looked around; the dungeon was dissolving as though it was made of smoke; everything was fading, he could see only his own body, all else was swirling darkness ...
\par And then, the dungeon returned. Harry was sitting in a dif\-ferent seat; still on the highest bench, but now to the left side of Mr Crouch. The atmosphere seemed 
quite different; relaxed, even cheerful. The witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to each other, almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event. A witch halfway up the rows of benches opposite caught Harry\rquote 
s eye. She had short b
londe hair, was wearing magenta robes, and was sucking the end of an acid-green quill. It was, unmistakeably, a younger Rita Skeeter. Harry looked around; Dumbledore was sitting beside him again, wearing different robes. Mr Crouch looked tireder and someh
ow fiercer, gaunter ... Harry understood. It was a differ\-ent memory, a different day ... a different trial.
\par The door in the corner opened, and Ludo Bagman walked into the room.
\par This was not, however, a Ludo Bagman gone to seed, but a Ludo Bagman who was clearly at the height of his Quidditch-playing fitness. His nose wasn\rquote 
t broken now; he was tall and lean and muscly. Bagman looked nervous as he sat down in the chained chair, but it did not bind him there, as it had bound Karkaroff, and Bagman, perhaps taki
ng heart from this, glanced around at the watching crowd, waved at a couple of them, and managed a small smile.
\par \lquote Ludo Bagman, you have been brought here in front of the Council of Magical Law to answer charges relating to the activ\-ities of the Death Eaters,\rquote  said Mr Crouch. \lquote 
We have heard the evidence against you, and are about to reach our verdict. Do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pro\-nounce judgement?\rquote 
\par Harry couldn\rquote t believe his ears. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Ludo Bagman, a Death Eater?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par \lquote Only,\rquote  said Bagman, smiling awkwardly, \lquote well \endash  I know I\rquote ve been a bit of an idiot \endash \rquote 
\par One or two wizards and witches in the surrounding seats smiled indulgently. Mr Crouch did not appear to share their feelings. He was staring down at Ludo Bagman with an expres\-sion of the utmost severity and dislike.
\par \lquote You never spoke a truer word, boy,\rquote  someone muttered drily to Dumbledore behind Harry. He looked around, and saw Moody sitting there again. \lquote If I didn\rquote t know he\rquote d always been dim, I\rquote 
d have said some of those Bludgers had permanently affected his brain ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Ludovic Bagman, you were caught passing information to Lord Voldemort\rquote s supporters,\rquote  said Mr Crouch. \lquote For this, I suggest a term of imprisonment in Azkaban lasting no less than \endash \rquote 
\par But there was an angry outcry from the surrounding bench\-es. Several of the witches and wizards around the walls stood up, shaking their heads, and even their fists, at Mr Crouch.
\par \lquote But I\rquote ve told you, I had no idea!\rquote  Bagman called earnestly over the crowd\rquote s babble, his round blue eyes widening. \lquote None at all! Old Rookwood was a friend of my dad\rquote 
s ... never crossed my mind he was in with You-Know-Who! I thought I was col\-lecting information for our side! And Rookwood kept talking about getting me a job in the Ministry later on ... once my Quidditch days are over, you know ... I mean, I can
\rquote t keep get\-ting hit by Bludgers for the rest of my life, can I?\rquote 
\par There were titters from the crowd.
\par \lquote It will be put to the vote,\rquote  said Mr Crouch coldly. He turned to the right-hand side of the dungeon. \lquote The jury will please raise their hands ... those in favour of imprisonment ...\rquote 
\par Harry looked towards the right-hand side of the dungeon. Not one person raised their hand. Many of the witches and wizards around the walls began to clap. One of the witches on the jury stood up.
\par \lquote Yes?\rquote  barked Crouch.
\par \lquote We\rquote d just like to congratulate Mr Bagman on his splendid performance for England in the Quidditch match against Turkey last Saturday,\rquote  the witch said breathlessly.
\par Mr Crouch looked furious. The dungeon was ringing with applause now. Bagman got to his feet and bowed, beaming.
\par \lquote Despicable,\rquote  Mr Crouch spat at Dumbledore, sitting down as Bagman walked out of the dungeon. \lquote Rookwood get him a job indeed ... the day Ludo Bagman joins us will be a very sad day for the Ministry ...\rquote 
\par And th
e dungeon dissolved again. When it had returned, Harry looked around. He and Dumbledore were still sitting beside Mr Crouch, but the atmosphere could not have been more different. There was total silence, broken only by the dry sobs of a frail, wispy-look
ing witch in the seat next to Mr Crouch. She was clutching a handkerchief to her mouth with trembling hands. Harry looked up at Crouch, and saw that he looked gaunter, and greyer than ever before. A nerve was twitching in his temple.
\par \lquote Bring them in,\rquote  he said, and his voice echoed through the silent dungeon.
\par The door in the corner opened yet again. Six Dementors entered this time, flanking a group of four people. Harry saw the people in the crowd turn to look up at Mr Crouch. A few of them whispered to each other.
\par The Dementors placed each of the four people in the four chairs with chained arms which now stood on the dungeon floor. There was a thickset man who stared blankly up at Crouch, a thinner and more nervous-looking man, whose eyes were darting around t
he crowd, a woman, with thick, shining dark hair, and heavily hooded eyes, who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne, and a boy in his late teens, who looked nothing short of petrified. He was shivering, his straw-coloured hair all o
ver his face, his freckled skin milk-white. The wispy little witch beside Crouch began to rock backwards and forwards in her seat, whimpering into her handkerchief.
\par Crouch stood up. He looked down upon the four in front of him, and there was pure hatred in his face.
\par \lquote You have been brought here before the Council of Magical Law,\rquote  he said clearly, \lquote so that we may pass judgement on you, for a crime so heinous \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Father,\rquote  said the boy with the straw-coloured hair. \lquote Father ... please ...\rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court,\rquote  said Crouch, speaking more loudly, drowning out his son\rquote s voice. \lquote 
We have heard the evidence against you. The four of you stand accused of capturing an Auror \endash  Frank Longbottom \endash  and subjecting 
him to the Cruciatus curse, believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master, He Who Must Not Be Named \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Father, I didn\rquote t!\rquote  shrieked the boy in chains below. \lquote I didn\rquote t, I swear it, Father, don\rquote t send me back to the Dementors \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You are further accused,\rquote  bellowed Mr Crouch, \lquote of using the Cruciatus curse on Frank Longbottom\rquote 
s wife, when he would not give you information. You planned to restore He Who Must Not Be Named to power, and to resume the lives of vio\-lence you presumably led while he was strong. I now ask the jury \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Mother!\rquote  screamed the boy below, and the wispy little witch beside Crouch began to sob, rocking backwards and forwards. \lquote Mother, stop him, Mother, I didn\rquote t do it, it wasn\rquote t me!\rquote 
\par \lquote I now ask the jury,\rquote  shouted Mr Crouch, \lquote to raise their hands if they believe, as I do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban.\rquote 
\par In unison, the witches and wizards along the right-hand side of the dungeon raised their hands. The crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for Bagman, their faces full of savage tri\-umph. The boy began to scream.
\par \lquote No! Mother, no! I didn\rquote t do it, I didn\rquote t do it, I didn\rquote t know! Don\rquote t send me there, don\rquote t let him!\rquote 
\par The Dementors were gliding back into the room. The boy\rquote s three companions rose quietly from their seats; the woman with the heavy-lidded eyes looked up at Crouch and called, \lquote 
The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch! Throw us into Azkaban, we will wait! He will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to find him!\rquote 
\par But the boy was trying to fight the Dementors off, even though Harry could see their cold, draining power starting to affect him. The crowd were jeering, some of them on their feet, as the woman swept out of the dungeon, and the boy continued to struggle.

\par \lquote I\rquote m your son!\rquote  he screamed up at Crouch. \lquote I\rquote m your son!\rquote 
\par \lquote You are no son of mine!\rquote  bellowed Mr Crouch, his eyes bulging suddenly. \lquote I have no son!\rquote 
\par The wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp, and slumped in her seat. She had fainted. Crouch appeared not to have noticed.
\par \lquote Take them away!\rquote  Crouch roared at the Dementors, spit fly\-ing from his mouth. \lquote Take them away, and may they rot there!\rquote 
\par \lquote Father! Father, I wasn\rquote t involved! No! No! Father, please!\rquote 
\par \lquote I think, Harry, it is time to return to my office,\rquote  said a quiet voice in Harry\rquote s ear.
\par Harry started. He looked around. Then he looked on his other side.
\par There was an Albus Dumbledore sitting on his right, watching Crouch\rquote s son being dragged away by the Dementors \endash  and there was an Albus Dumbledore on his left, looking right at him.
\par \lquote Come,\rquote  said the Dumbledore on his left, and he put his hand under Harry\rquote s elbow. Harry felt himself rising into the air; the dungeon dissolved around him; for a
 moment, all was blackness, and then he felt as though he had done a slow-motion somersault, suddenly landing flat on his feet, in what seemed like the dazzling light of Dumbledore\rquote 
s sunlit office. The stone basin was shimmering in the cabinet in front of him, and Albus Dumbledore was standing beside him.
\par \lquote Professor,\rquote  Harry gasped, \lquote I know I shouldn\rquote t\rquote ve \endash  I didn\rquote t mean \endash  the cabinet door was sort of open and \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I quite understand,\rquote  said Dumbledore. He lifted the basin, carried it over to his desk, placed it upon the polished top, and sat down in the chair behind it. He motioned Harry to sit down opposite him.
\par Harry did so, staring at the stone basin. The contents had returned to their original, silvery white state, swirling and rip\-pling beneath his gaze.
\par \lquote What is it?\rquote  Harry asked shakily.
\par \lquote This? It is called a Pensieve,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I sometimes find, and I am sure you know the feeling, that I simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind.\rquote 
\par \lquote Er,\rquote  said Harry, who couldn\rquote t truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of the sort.
\par \lquote At these times,\rquote  said Dumbledore, indicating the stone basin, \lquote I use the Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one\rquote s mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one\rquote s leisure. It bec
omes easier to spot pat\-terns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.\rquote 
\par \lquote You mean ... that stuff\rquote s your }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 thoughts?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
Harry said, staring at the swirling white substance in the basin.
\par \lquote Certainly,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Let me show you.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes, and placed the tip into his own silvery hair, near his temple. When he took the wand away, hair seemed to be clinging to it \endash 
 but then Harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same stra
nge, silvery white substance that filled the Pensieve. Dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin, and Harry, astonished, saw his own face swimming around the surface of the bowl.
\par Dumbledore placed his long hands on either side of the Pensieve and swirled it, rather as a gold prospector would swirl for fragments of gold ... and Harry saw his own face change smoothly into Snape\rquote 
s, who opened his mouth, and spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly. \lquote It\rquote s coming back ... Karkaroff\rquote s too ... stronger and clearer than ever ...\rquote 
\par \lquote A connection I could have made without assistance,\rquote  Dumbledore sighed, \lquote but never mind.\rquote  He peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles at Harry, who was gaping at Snape\rquote 
s face, which was continuing to swirl around the bowl. \lquote 
I was using the Pensieve when Mr Fudge arrived for our meeting, and put it away rather hastily. Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door properly. Naturally, it would have attracted your attention.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry,\rquote  Harry mumbled.
\par Dumbledore shook his head.
\par \lquote Curiosity is not a sin,\rquote  he said. \lquote But we should exercise cau\-tion with our curiosity ... yes, indeed ...\rquote 
\par Frowning slightly, he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of his wand. Instantly, a figure rose out of it, a plump, scowling girl of around sixteen, who began to revolve slowly, with her feet still in the basin. She took no notice what\-
soever of Harry or Professor Dumbledore. When she spoke, her voice echoed as Snape\rquote s had done, as though it was coming from the depths of the stone basin: \lquote 
He put a hex on me, Professor Dumbledore, and I was only teasing him, sir, I only said I\rquote d seen him kissing Florence behind the greenhouses last Thursday ...\rquote 
\par \lquote But why, Bertha,\rquote  said Dumbledore sadly, looking up at the now silently revolving girl, \lquote why did you have to follow him in the first place?\rquote 
\par \lquote Bertha?\rquote  Harry whispered, looking up at her. \lquote Is that \endash  was that Bertha Jorkins?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore, prodding the thoughts in the basin again; Bertha sank back into them, and they became silvery and opaque once more. \lquote That was Bertha as I remember her at school.\rquote 
\par The silvery light from the Pensieve illuminated Dumble\-dore\rquote s face, and it struck Harry suddenly how very old he was looking. He knew, of course, that Dumbledore was getting on in years
, but somehow he never really thought of Dumbledore as an old man.
\par \lquote So, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly. \lquote Before you got lost in my thoughts, you wanted to tell me something.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Professor \endash  I was in Divination just now, and \endash  er \endash  I fell asleep.\rquote 
\par He hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was coming, but Dumbledore merely said, \lquote Quite understandable. Continue.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I had a dream,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote A dream about Lord Voldemort. He was torturing Wormtail ... you know who Wormtail \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I do know,\rquote  said Dumbledore, promptly. \lquote Please continue.\rquote 
\par \lquote Voldemort got a letter from an owl. He said something like, Wormtail\rquote s blunder had been repaired. He said someone was dead. Then he said, Wormtail wouldn\rquote t be fed to the snake \endash  there was a snake beside his chair. He said 
\endash  he said he\rquote d be feeding me to it, instead. Then he did the Cruciatus curse on Wormtail \endash  and my scar hurt,\rquote  Harry said. \lquote It woke me up, it hurt so badly.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore merely looked at him.
\par \lquote Er \endash  that\rquote s all,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote I see,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly. \lquote I see. Now, has your scar hurt at any other time this year, excepting the time it woke you up over the summer?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I \endash  how did you know it woke me up over the sum\-mer?\rquote  said Harry, astonished.
\par \lquote You are not Sirius\rquote  only correspondent,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I have also been in contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last year. It was I who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay.\rquote 

\par Dumbledore got up, and began walking up and down behind his desk. Every now and then, he placed his wand tip to his temple, removed another shining silver thought, and added it to the Pensieve. The thoughts inside began to swirl so fast that Harry couldn
\rquote t make out anything clearly; it was mere\-ly a blur of colour.
\par \lquote Professor?\rquote  he said quietly, after a couple of minutes.
\par Dumbledore stopped pacing, and looked at Harry.
\par \lquote My apologies,\rquote  he said quietly. He sat back down at his desk.
\par \lquote D\rquote you \endash  d\rquote you know why my scar\rquote s hurting me?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a moment, and then said, \lquote I have a theory, no more than that ... It is my belief that your scar hurts both when Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred.
\rquote 
\par \lquote But ... why?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote That is no ordinary scar.\rquote 
\par \lquote So you think ... that dream ... did it really happen?\rquote 
\par \lquote It is possible,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I would say \endash  probable. Harry \endash  did you see Voldemort?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Just the back of his chair. But \endash  there wouldn\rquote t have been anything to see, would there? I mean, he hasn\rquote t got a body, has he? But ... but then how could he have held the wand?\rquote 
 Harry said slowly.
\par \lquote How indeed?\rquote  muttered Dumbledore. \lquote How indeed ...\rquote 
\par Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while. Dumbledore was gazing across the room, every now and then placing his wand tip to his temple, and adding another shin\-ing, silver thought to the seething mass within the Pensieve.
\par \lquote Professor,\rquote  Harry said at last, \lquote do you think he\rquote s getting stronger?\rquote 
\par \lquote Voldemort?\rquote  said Dumbledore, looking at Harry over the Pensieve. It was the characteristic, piercing look Dumbledore had given him on other occasions, and always made Harry feel as though Dumbled
ore was seeing right through him, in a way that even Moody\rquote s magical eye could not. \lquote Once again, Harry, I can only give you my suspicions.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore sighed again, and he looked older, and wearier, than ever.
\par \lquote The years of Voldemort\rquote s ascent to power,\rquote  he said, \lquote 
were marked with disappearances. Bertha Jorkins has vanished without trace in the place where Voldemort was certainly known to be last. Mr Crouch, too, has disappeared ... within these very grounds. And there was a third disappearance, one which th
e Ministry, I regret to say, does not consider of any importance, for it concerns a Muggle. His name was Frank Bryce, he lived in the village where Voldemort\rquote 
s father grew up, and he has not been seen since last August. You see, I read the Muggle newspapers, unlike most of my Ministry friends.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore looked very seriously at Harry. \lquote These disap\-pearances seem to me to be linked. The Ministry disagrees \endash  as you may have heard, while waiting outside my office.\rquote 
\par Harry nodded. Silence fell between them again, Dumbledore extracting thoughts every now and then. Harry felt as though he ought to go, but his curiosity held him in his chair.
\par \lquote Professor?\rquote  he said again.
\par \lquote Yes, Harry?\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Er ... could I ask you about ... that court thing I was in ... in the Pensieve?\rquote 
\par \lquote You could,\rquote  said Dumbledore heavily. \lquote I attended it many times, but some trials come back to me more clearly than others ... particularly now ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You know \endash  you know the trial you found me in? The one with Crouch\rquote s son? Well ... were they talking about Neville\rquote s parents?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore gave Harry a very sharp look.
\par \lquote Has Neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother?\rquote  he said.
\par Harry shook his head, wondering, as he did so, how he could have failed to ask Neville this, in almost four years of knowing him.
\par \lquote Yes, they were talking about Neville\rquote s parents,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote His father, Frank, was an Auror just like Professor Moody. He and his wife were tortured for informa\-tion about Voldemort\rquote s whereabouts after he lost 
his powers, as you heard.\rquote 
\par \lquote So they\rquote re dead?\rquote  said Harry quietly.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Dumbledore, his voice full of a bitterness Harry had never heard there before, \lquote they are insane. They are both in St Mungo\rquote s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I believe 
Neville visits them, with his grandmother, during the holidays. They do not recognise him.\rquote 
\par Harry sat there, horror-struck. He had never known ... never, in four years, bothered to find out ...
\par \lquote The Longbottoms were very popular,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par The attacks on them came after Voldemort\rquote 
s fall from power, just when everyone thought they were safe. Those attacks caused a wave of fury such as I have never known. The Ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it. Unfortunately, the Longbottoms\rquote  evidence was 
\endash  given their condition \endash  none too reliable.\rquote 
\par \lquote Then Mr Crouch\rquote s son might not have been involved?\rquote  said Harry slowly.
\par Dumbledore shook his head. \lquote As to that, I have no idea.\rquote 
\par Harry sat in silence once more, watching the contents of the Pensieve swirl. There were two more questions he was burning to ask ... but they concerned the guilt of living people ...
\par \lquote Er,\rquote  he said, \lquote Mr Bagman ...\rquote 
\par \lquote ... has never been accused of any Dark activity since,\rquote  said Dumbledore calmly.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry hastily, staring at the contents of the Pensieve again, which were swirling more slowly now that Dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts. \lquote And ... er ...\rquote 
\par But the Pensieve seemed to be asking his question for him. Snape\rquote s face was swimming on the surface again. Dumbledore glanced down into it, and then up at Harry.
\par \lquote No more has Professor Snape,\rquote  he said.
\par Harry looked into Dumbledore\rquote s light-blue eyes, and the thing he really wanted to know spilled out of his mouth before he could stop it. \lquote What made you think he\rquote d really stopped supporting Voldemort, Professor?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore held Harry\rquote s gaze for a few seconds, and then said, \lquote That, Harry, is a matter between Professor Snape and myself.\rquote 
\par Harry knew that the interview was over; Dumbledore did not look angry, yet there was a finality in his tone that told Harry it was time to go. He stood up, and so did Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  he said, as Harry reached the door. \lquote Please do not speak about Neville\rquote s parents to anybody else. He has the right to let people know, when he is ready.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Professor,\rquote  said Harry, turning to go.
\par \lquote And \endash \rquote 
\par Harry looked back.
\par Dumbledore was standing over the Pensieve, his face lit from beneath by its silvery spots of light, looking older than ever. He stared at Harry for a moment, and then said, \lquote Good luck with the third task.\rquote

thing Dumbledore had told and shown him afterwards, he had now shared with Ron and Hermione \endash  and, of course, with Sirius, to whom Harry had sent an owl the moment he had left Dumbledore\rquote s office. Har
ry, Ron and Hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night, talking it all over until Harry\rquote 
s mind was reeling, until he understood what Dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off.
\par Ron stared into the common-room fire. Harry thought he saw Ron shiver slightly, even though the evening was warm.
\par \lquote And he trusts Snape?\rquote  Ron said. \lquote He really trusts Snape, even though he knows he was a Death Eater?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Hermione had not spoken for ten minutes. She was sitting with her forehead in her hands, staring at her knees. Harry thought she, too, looked as though she could have done with a Pensieve.
\par \lquote Rita Skeeter,\rquote  she muttered finally.
\par \lquote How can you be worrying about her now?\rquote  said Ron, in disbelief.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not worrying about her,\rquote  Hermione said to her knees. \lquote I\rquote m just thinking ... remember what she said to me in the Three Broomsticks? \'93I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl.\'94
 This is what she meant, isn\rquote t it? She reported his trial, she knew he\rquote d passed information to the Death Eaters. And Winky, too, remember ... \'93Mr Bagman is a bad wizard.\'94
 Mr Crouch would have been furious he got off, he would have talked about it at home.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, but Bagman didn\rquote t pass information on purpose, did he?\rquote 
\par Hermione shrugged.
\par \lquote And Fudge reckons }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Madame Maxime }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 attacked Crouch?\rquote 
 Ron said, turning back to Harry.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but he\rquote s only saying that because Crouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage.\rquote 
\par \lquote We never thought of her, did we?\rquote  said Ron, slowly. \lquote Mind you, she\rquote s definitely got giant blood, and she doesn\rquote t want to admit it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Of course she doesn\rquote t,\rquote  said Hermione sharply, looking up. \lquote Look what happened to Hagrid when Rita found out about his mother. Look at Fudge, jumping to conclusions about her, just because she\rquote 
s part giant. Who needs that sort of prejudice? I\rquote d probably say I had big bones if I knew that\rquote s what I\rquote d get for telling the truth.\rquote 
\par Hermione looked at her watch.
\par \lquote We haven\rquote t done any practising!\rquote  she said, looking shocked. \lquote We were going to do the Impediment Jinx! We\rquote ll have to really get down to it tomorrow! Come on, Harry, you need to get some sleep.\rquote 
\par Harry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory. As Harry pulled on his pyjamas, he looked over at Neville\rquote s bed. True to his word to Dumbledore, he had not told Ron and Hermione about Neville\rquote 
s parents. As Harry took off his glasses and climbed into his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living, but unable to recognise you. He often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan, but as he listened to Neville
\rquote s snores, he thought that Neville deserved it more than he did. Lying in the darkness, Harry felt a rush of anger and hate towards the people who had tortured Mr and Mrs Longbottom ... he remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch\rquote 
s son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the Dementors ... he understood how they had felt ... then he remembered the milk-white face of the screaming boy, and realised with a jolt that he had died a year later ...
\par It was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness, it all came back to Voldemort ... he was the one who had torn these families apart, who had ruined all these lives ...

 this out to them, and said he didn\rquote t mind practising on his own for a while. \lquote At least we\rquote ll get top marks in Defence Against the Dark Arts, we\rquote d never have found out about all these hexes in class.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good training for when we\rquote re all Aurors,\rquote  said Ron excitedly, attempting the Impediment Jinx on a wasp that had buzzed into the room, and making it stop dead in mid-air.
\par The mood in the castle as they entered June became excited and tense again. Everyone was looking forward to the third task, which would take
 place a week before the end of term. Harry was practising hexes in every available moment. He felt more confident about this task than either of the others. Difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be, Moody was right: Harry had managed to fin
d his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now, and this time he had some notice, some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead.
\par Tired of walking in on them all over the school, Professor McGonagall had given Harry permission to use the empty Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes. He had soon mas\-
tered the Impediment Jinx, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers, the Reductor curse, which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way, and the Four-Point Spell, a useful discovery of Hermione\rquote 
s which would make his wand point due north, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze. He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was sup\-posed to cast a tempor
ary, invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx. Harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterwards before she had looked up the counter-jinx.
\par \lquote You\rquote re still doing really well, though,\rquote  Hermione said encouragingly, looking down her list, and crossing off those spells they had already learnt. \lquote Some of these are bound to come in handy.\rquote 
\par \lquote Come and look at this,\rquote  said Ron, who was standing by the window. He was staring down into the grounds. \lquote What\rquote s Malfoy doing?\rquote 
\par Harry and Hermione went to see. Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below. Crabbe and Goyle seemed to be keeping a look out; both were smirking. Malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth, and speaking into it.
\par \lquote He looks like he\rquote s using a walkie-talkie,\rquote  said Harry curiously.
\par \lquote He can\rquote t be,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote I\rquote ve told you, those sort of things don\rquote t work around Hogwarts. Come on, Harry,\rquote  she added briskly, turning away from the window and moving back into the middle of the room,

Sirius was sending daily owls now. Like Hermione, he seemed to want to concentrate on getting Harry through the las

\par \lquote I\rquote ve been trying!\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote But I ... but ...\rquote 
\par An odd, dreamy expression suddenly came over Hermione\rquote s face. She slowly raised a hand, and ran her fingers through her hair.
\par \lquote Are you all right?\rquote  said Ron, frowning at her.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Hermione breathlessly. She ran her fingers through her hair again, and then held her hand up to her mouth, as though speaking into an invisible walkie-talkie. Harry and Ron stared at each other.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve had an idea,\rquote  Hermione said, gazing into space. \lquote I think I know ... because then no one would be able to see ... even Moody ... and she\rquote d have been able to get onto the window-ledge ... but she\rquote

\par With that, Hermione seized her schoolbag, and dashed out of the Great Hall.
\par \lquote Oi!\rquote  Ron called after her. \lquote We\rquote ve got our History of Magic exam in ten minutes! Blimey,\rquote  he said, turning back to Harry, \lquote she must really hate that Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam. What\rquote 
re you going to do in Binns\rquote s class \endash  read again?\rquote 
\par Exempt from the end-of-term tests as a Triwizard champion, Harry had been sitting at the back of every exam class so far, looking up fresh hexes for the third task.
\par \lquote S\rquote pose so,\rquote  Harry said to Ron; but just then, Professor McGonagall came walking along the Gryffindor table towards him.
\par \lquote Potter, the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after breakfast,\rquote  she said.
\par \lquote But the task\rquote s not \rquote til tonight!\rquote  said Harry, accidentally spilling scrambled eggs down his front, afraid he had mistaken the time.
\par \lquote I\rquote m aware of that, Potter,\rquote  she said. \lquote The champions\rquote  families are invited to watch the final task, you know. This is simply a chance for you to greet them.\rquote 
\par She moved away. Harry gaped after her.
\par \lquote She doesn\rquote t expect the Dursleys to turn up, does she?\rquote  he asked Ron blankly.
\par \lquote Dunno,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Harry, I\rquote d better hurry, I\rquote m going to be late for Binns. See you later.\rquote 
\par Harry finished his breakfast in the emp
tying Great Hall. He saw Fleur Delacour get up from the Ravenclaw table and join Cedric as he crossed to the side chamber and entered. Krum slouched off to join them shortly afterwards. Harry stayed where he was. He really didn\rquote 
t want to go into the chamber. He had no family \endash  no family who would turn up to see him risk his life, anyway. But just as he was getting up, thinking that he might as well go up to the library and do a spot more hex revi\-
sion, the door of the side chamber opened, and Cedric stuck his head out.
\par \lquote Harry, come on, they\rquote re waiting for you!\rquote 
\par Utterly perplexed, Harry got up. The Dursleys couldn\rquote t pos\-sibly be here, could they? He walked across the Hall and opened the door into the chamber.
\par Cedric and his parents were just inside the door. Viktor Krum was over in a corner, conversing with his dark-haired mother and father in rapid Bulgarian. He had inherited his father\rquote 
s hooked nose. On the other side of the room, Fleur was jabbering away in French to her mother. Fleur\rquote s little sister, Gabrielle, was holding her mother\rquote 
s hand. She waved at Harry, who waved back. Then he saw Mrs Weasley and Bill standing in front of the fireplace, beaming at him.
\par \lquote Surprise!\rquote  Mrs Weasley said excitedly, as Harry smiled broadly, and walked over to them. \lquote Thought we\rquote d come and watch you, Harry!\rquote  She bent down and kissed him on the cheek.
\par \lquote You all right?\rquote  said Bill, grinning at Harry and shaking his hand. \lquote Charlie wanted to come, but he couldn\rquote t get time off. He said you were incredible against the Horntail.\rquote 
\par Fleur Delacour, Harry noticed, was eyeing Bill with great interest over her mother\rquote s shoulder. Harry could tell she had no objection whatsoever to long hair or earrings with fangs on them.
\par \lquote This is really nice of you,\rquote  Harry muttered to Mrs Weasley. \lquote I thought for a moment \endash  the Dursleys \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hmm,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, pursing her lips. She had always refrained from criticising the Dursleys in front of Harry, but her eyes flashed every time they were mentioned.
\par \lquote It\rquote s great being back here,\rquote  said Bill, looking around the chamber (Violet, the Fat Lady\rquote s friend, winked at him from her frame). \lquote Haven\rquote 
t seen this place for five years. Is that picture of the mad knight still around? Sir Cadogan?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yeah,\rquote  said Harry, who had met Sir Cadogan the previ\-ous year.
\par \lquote And the Fat Lady?\rquote  said Bill.
\par \lquote She was here in my time,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. \lquote She gave me such a telling-off one night when I got back to the dormitory at four in the morning \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning?\rquote  said Bill, surveying Mrs Weasley with amazement.
\par Mrs Weasley grinned, her eyes twinkling.
\par \lquote Your father and I had been for a night-time stroll,\rquote  she said. \lquote He got caught by Apollyon Pringle \endash  he was the caretaker in those days \endash  your father\rquote s still got the marks.\rquote 
\par \lquote Fancy giving us a tour, Harry?\rquote  said Bill.
\par \lquote Yeah, OK,\rquote  said Harry, and they made their way back towards the door into the Great Hall.
\par As they passed Amos Diggory, he looked around. \lquote There you are, are you?\rquote  he said, looking Harry up and down. \lquote Bet you\rquote re not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedric\rquote s caught you up on points, are you?\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Ignore him,\rquote  said Cedric in a low voice to Harry, frowning after his father. \lquote He\rquote s been angry ever since Rita Skeeter\rquote s article about the Triwizard Tournament \endash 
 you know, when she made out you were the only Hogwarts champion.\rquote 
\par \lquote Didn\rquote t bother to correct her, though, did he?\rquote  said Amos Diggory, loudly enough for Harry to hear as he made to walk out of the door with Mrs Weasley and Bill. \lquote Still ... you\rquote ll 
show him, Ced. Beaten him once before, haven\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble, Amos!\rquote  Mrs Weasley said angrily. \lquote I would have thought you\rquote d know that, working at the Ministry!\rquote 
\par Mr Diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry, but his wife laid a hand on his arm, and he merely shrugged and turned away.
\par Harry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with Bill and Mrs Weasley, showing them the Beauxbatons carriage and the Durmstrang ship. Mrs Weasley
 was intrigued by the Whomping Willow, which had been planted after she had left school, and reminisced at length about the gamekeeper before Hagrid, a man called Ogg.
\par \lquote How\rquote s Percy?\rquote  Harry asked, as they walked around the greenhouses.
\par \lquote Not good,\rquote  said Bill.
\par \lquote He\rquote s very upset,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, lowering her voice and glancing around. \lquote The Ministry want to keep Mr Crouch\rquote s dis\-appearance quiet, but Percy\rquote 
s been hauled in for questioning about the instructions Mr Crouch has been sending in. They seem to think there\rquote s a chance they weren\rquote t genuinely written by him. Percy\rquote s been under a lot of strain. They\rquote 
re not letting him fill in for Mr Crouch as the fifth judge tonight. Cornelius Fudge is going to be doing it.\rquote 
\par They returned to the castle for lunch.
\par \lquote Mum \endash  Bill!\rquote  said Ron, looking stunned, as he joined the Gryffindor table. \lquote What\rquote re you doing here?\rquote 
\par \lquote Come to watch Harry in the last task!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley brightly. \lquote I must say, it makes a lovely change, not having to cook. How was your exam?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh ... OK,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Couldn\rquote t remember all the goblin rebels\rquote  names, so I invented a few. It\rquote s all right,\rquote  he said, helping himself to a Cornish pasty, while Mrs Weasley looked stern, \lquote they
\rquote re all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean, it wasn\rquote t hard.\rquote 
\par Fred, George and Ginny came to sit next to them, too, and Harry was having such a good time he felt almost as though he was back at The Burrow; he had forgotten to worry about that evening\rquote s task, and it wasn\rquote 
t until Hermione turned up, halfway through lunch, did he remember that she had had a brainwave about Rita Skeeter.
\par \lquote Are you going to tell us \endash ?\rquote 
\par Hermione shook her head warningly, and glanced at Mrs Weasley.
\par \lquote Hello, Hermione,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, much more stiffly than usual.
\par \lquote Hello,\rquote  said Hermione, her smile faltering at the cold expres\-sion on Mrs Weasley\rquote s face.
\par Harry looked between them, then said, \lquote Mrs Weasley, you didn\rquote t believe that rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Witch Weekly, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 did you? Because Hermione\rquote s not my girlfriend.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. \lquote No \endash  of course I didn\rquote t!\rquote 
\par But she became considerably warmer towards Hermione after that.
\par Harry, Bill and Mrs Weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk around the castle, and then returned to the Great Hall for the evening feast. Ludo Bagman an
d Cornelius Fudge had joined the staff table now. Bagman looked quite cheerful, but Cornelius Fudge, who was sitting next to Madame Maxime, looked stern and was not talking. Madame Maxime was concentrating on her plate, and Harry thought her eyes looked r
ed. Hagrid kept glancing along the table at her.
\par There were more courses than usual, but Harry, who was starting to feel really nervous now, didn\rquote t eat much. As the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple, Dumbledore rose to his
 feet at the staff table, and silence fell.
\par \lquote Ladies and gentlemen, in five minutes\rquote  time, I will be asking you to make your way down to the Quidditch pitch for the third and last task of the Triwizard Tournament. Will the champions please follow Mr Bagman down to the stadium now.
\rquote 
\par Harry got up. The Gryffindors all along the table were applauding him; the Weasleys and Hermione all wished him good luck, and he headed off out of the Great Hall, with Cedric, Fleur and Krum.
\par \lquote Feeling all right, Harry?\rquote  Bagman asked, as they went down the stone steps into the grounds. \lquote Confident?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m OK,\rquote  said Harry. It was sort of true; he was nervous, but he kept running over all the hexes and spells he had been practising in his mind as they walked, and the knowledge that he could remember them all made him feel better.

\par They walked onto the Quidditch pitch,
 which was now completely unrecognisable. A twenty-foot-high hedge ran all the way around the edge of it. There was a gap right in front of them; the entrance to the vast maze. The passage beyond it looked dark and creepy.
\par Five minutes later, the stands ha
d begun to fill; the air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats. The sky was a deep, clear blue now, and the first stars were starting to appear. Hagrid, Professor Moody, Professor McGonagall
 and Professor Flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached Bagman and the champions. They were wearing large, red, luminous stars on their hats, all except Hagrid, who had his on the back of his moleskin waistcoat.
\par \lquote We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall to the champions. \lquote If you get into diffi\-
culty, and wish to be rescued, send red sparks into the air, and one of us will come and get you, do you understand?\rquote 
\par The champions nodded.
\par \lquote Off you go, then!\rquote  said Bagman brightly to the four patrollers.
\par \lquote Good luck, Harry,\rquote  Hagrid whispered, and the four of them walked away in different directions, to station themselves around the maze. Bagman now pointed his wand at his throat, muttered }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently stand! Tied in first place, on eighty-five points each \endash  Mr Cedric Diggory an
d Mr Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts School!\rquote  The cheers and applause sent birds from the Forbidden Forest fluttering into the darkening sky. \lquote In second place, on eighty points \endash  Mr Viktor Krum, of Durmstrang Institute!\rquote 
 More applause. \lquote And in third place \endash  Miss Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons Academy!\rquote 
\par Harry could just make out Mrs Weasley, Bill, Ron and Hermione applauding Fleur politely, halfway up the stands. He waved up at them, and they waved back, beaming at him.
\par \lquote So ... on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!\rquote  said Bagman. \lquote Three \endash  two \endash  one \endash \rquote 
\par He gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forwards into the maze.
\par The towering hedges cast black shadows across the path, and, whether because they were so tall and thick, or because they had b
een enchanted, the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze. Harry felt almost as though he was underwater again. He pulled out his wand, muttered }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par After about fifty yards, they reached a fork. They looked at each other.
\par \lquote See you,\rquote  Harry said, and he took the left one, while Cedric took the right.
\par Harry heard Bagman\rquote s whistle for the second time. Krum had entered the maze. Harry sped up. His chosen path seemed completely deserted. He turned right, and hurried on, holding his wand high over his head, trying to see as far ahead as pos\-
sible. Still, there was nothing in sight.
\par Bagman\rquote s whistle blew in the distance for the third time. All of the champions were now inside the maze.
\par Harry kept looking behind him. The old feeling that he was being watched was upon him. The maze was growing darker with every passing minute as the sky overhead deepened to navy. He reached a second fork.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Point me,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 he whispered to his wand, holding it flat in his palm.

\par The wand spun around once, and pointed towards his right, into solid hedge. That way was north, and he knew that he needed to go north-west for the centre of the maze. The best he could do was to take the left fork, and go right again as soon as possible.

\par The path ahead was empty, too, and when Harry reached a right turn and took it, he again found his way unblocked. Harry didn\rquote t know why, but the lack of obstacles was unnerv\-ing him. Surely he should have met something by now? It fe
lt as though the maze was luring him into a false sense of securi\-
ty. Then he heard movement right behind him. He held out his wand, ready to attack, but its beam fell only upon Cedric, who had just hurried out of a path on the right-hand side. Cedric looked severely shaken. The sleeve of his robes was smoking.
\par \lquote Hagrid\rquote s Blast-Ended Skrewts!\rquote  he hissed. They\rquote re enormous \endash  I only just got away!\rquote 
\par He shook his head, and dived out of sight, along another path. Keen to put plenty of distance between himself and the Skrewts, Harry hurried off again. Then, as he turned a corner, he saw \endash 
\par A Dementor was gliding towards him. Twelve feet tall, its face hidden by its hood, its rotting, scabbed hands out\-stretched, it advanced, sensing its way blindly towards him. Harry
 could hear its rattling breath; he felt clammy coldness stealing over him, but knew what he had to do ...
\par He summoned the happiest thought he could, concentrated with all his might on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with Ron and Hermione, raised his wand and cried, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Left ... right ... left again ... twice he found himself facing dead ends. He did the Four-Point Spell again, and found that he was going too far east. He turned back, took a right turn, and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of him.

\par He was still hesitating, when a scream shattered the silence.
\par \lquote Fleur?\rquote  Harry yelled.
\par There was silence. He stared all around him. What had hap\-pened to her? Her scream seemed to have come from some\-where ahead. He took a deep breath, and ran through the enchanted mist.
\par The world turned upside-down. Harry was hanging from the ground, with his hair on end, his glasses dangling off his nose, threatening to fall into the bottomless sky. He clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there, 
terrified. It felt as though his feet were glued to the grass, which had now become the ceiling. Below him the dark, star-spangled heavens stretched endlessly. He felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet, he would fall away from the earth comple
tely.

\par But not one of the spells he had practised had been designed to combat a sudden reversal of ground and sky. Did he dare move his foot? He could hear the blood pounding in his ears. He had two choices \endash 
 try and move, or send up red sparks, and get rescued and disqualified from the task.
\par He shut his eyes, so he wouldn\rquote t be able to see the view of endless space below him, and pulled his right foot as hard as he could, away from the grassy ceiling.
\par Immediately, the world righted itself. Harry fell forwards onto his knees on the wonderfully solid ground. He felt tem\-porarily limp with shock. He took a deep, steadying breath, then got up again, and hurried forwards, looking back over his s
houlder as he ran out of the golden mist, which twinkled innocently at him in the moonlight.
\par He paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for some sign of Fleur. He was sure it had been she who had screamed. What had she met? Was she all right? There was no sign of red sparks \endash 
 did that mean she had got herself out of trouble, or was she in such trouble that she couldn\rquote t reach her wand? Harry took the right fork with a feeling of increasing unease ... but at the same time, he couldn\rquote t help thinking, }{\rtlch\fcs1

 saw again that image of himself, raising the Triwizard Cup in front of the rest of the school ...
\par He met nothing for ten minutes, except dead ends. Twice he took the same wrong turning. Finally he found a new route, and started to jog along it, his wand-light waving, making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge walls. Then he round\-

\par He took a left path, and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another: forcing himself to stop, heart hammering, he per\-formed the Four-Point Spell again, backtracked, and chose a path that would take him north-west.
\par He had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes, when he heard something in the path running parallel to his own which made him stop dead.

\par \lquote Are you all right?\rquote  Harry said roughly, grabbing Cedric\rquote s arm.

\par \lquote I can\rquote t believe this ... I thought he was all right,\rquote  Harry said, staring at Krum.
\par \lquote So did I,\rquote  said Cedric.
\par \lquote Did you hear Fleur scream earlier?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Cedric. \lquote You don\rquote t think Krum got her, too?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Harry slowly.
\par \lquote Should we leave him here?\rquote  Cedric muttered.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I reckon we should send up red sparks. Someone\rquote ll come and collect him ... otherwise he\rquote ll probably be eaten by a Skrewt.\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote d deserve it,\rquote  Cedric muttered, but all the same, he raised his wand and shot a shower of red sparks into the air, which hovered high above Krum, marking the spot where he lay.
\par Harry and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment, looking around them. Then Cedric said, \lquote Well ... I s\rquote pose we\rquote d better go on ...\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Oh ... yeah ... right ...\rquote 
\par It was an odd moment. He and Cedric had been briefly unit\-ed against Krum \endash  now the fact that they were opponents came back to them both. They proceeded up the dark path without speaking, then Harry turned left, and Cedric right. Cedric\rquote 
s footsteps soon died away.
\par Harry moved on, continuing to use the Four-Point Spell, making sure he was moving in the right direction. It was between him and Cedric now. His desire to reach the Cup first was now burning stronger than ever, but he could hardly believe what he\rquote 
d just seen Krum do. The use of an Unforgivable Curse on a fellow human being meant a life term in Azkaban, that was what Moody had told them. Krum surely couldn\rquote t have wanted the Triwizard Cup that badly ... Harry sped up.
\par Every so often he hit more dead ends, bu
t the increasing darkness made him feel sure he was getting near the heart of the maze. Then, as he strode down a long, straight path, he saw movement once again, and his beam of wand-light hit an extraordinary creature, one which he had only seen in pict
ure form, in his }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 Monster Book of Monsters.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par It was a sphinx. It had the body of an overlarge lion; great clawed paws, and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a woman. She turned her long, almond-shaped eyes upon Harry
 as he approached. He raised his wand, hesitating. She was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing from side to side of the path, blocking his progress.
\par Then she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice. \lquote You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me.\rquote 
\par \lquote So ... so will you move, please?\rquote  said Harry, knowing what the answer was going to be.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  she said, continuing to pace. \lquote Not unless you can answer my riddle. Answer on your first guess \endash  I let you pass. Answer wrongly \endash  I attack. Remain silent \endash  I will let you walk away from me, unscathed.

\par Harry\rquote s stomach slipped several notches. It was Hermione who was good at this sort of thing, not him. He weighed his chances. If the riddle was too hard, he could keep silent, get away from her unharmed, and try and 
find an alternative route to the centre.

\par \lquote Go on,\rquote  Cedric said. He looked as though this was costing him every ounce of resolution he had, but his face was set, his arms were folded, he seemed decided.

\par Cedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his feet, and they looked around.
\par They had left the Hogwarts grounds completely; they had obviously travelled miles \endash  perhaps hundreds of miles \endash 
 for even the mountains surrounding the castle were gone. They were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard; the black outline of a sm
all church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right. A hill rose above them to their left. Harry could just make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside.
\par Cedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry.
\par \lquote Did anyone tell }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 the Cup was a Portkey?\rquote  he asked.
\par \lquote Nope,\rquote  said Harry. He was looking around the graveyard. It was completely silent, and slightly eerie. \lquote Is this supposed to be part of the task?\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno,\rquote  said Cedric. He sounded slightly nervous. \lquote Wands out, d\rquote you reckon?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion rather than him.
\par They pulled out their wands. Harry kept looking around him. He had, yet again, the strange feeling that they were being watched.
\par \lquote Someone\rquote s coming,\rquote  he said suddenly.
\par Squinting tensely through the darkness, they watched the figure drawing nearer, walking steadily towards them between the graves. Harry couldn\rquote 
t make out a face; but from the way it was walking, and holding its arms, he could tell that it was carrying something. Whoever they were, they were short, and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over their head to obscure their face. And \endash 
 several paces nearer, the space between them closing all the time \endash  he saw that the thing in the person\rquote s arms looked like a baby ... or was it merely a bundle of robes?
\par Harry lowered his wand slightly, and glanced sideways at Cedric. Cedric shot him a quizzical look. They both turned back to watch the approaching figure.
\par It stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet from them. For a second, Harry and Cedric and the short fig\-ure simply looked at each other.
\par And then, without warning, Harry\rquote s scar exploded with pain. It was agony such as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands
 over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all, his head was about to split open.
\par From far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Kill the spare.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

s eyelids, and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he retched, and then it diminished; terrified of what he was about to see, he opened his stinging eyes.
\par Cedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside him. He was dead.
\par For a second that contained an eternity, Harry stared into Cedric\rquote s face, at his open grey eyes, blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted house, at his half-open mouth, which looked slightly surprised. And then, before Harry\rquote 
s mind had accepted what he was seeing, before he could feel anything but numb disbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet.
\par The short man in the cloak had put down his bundle, lit his wand, and was dragging Harry towards the marble headstone. Harry saw the name upon it flickering in the wand-light before he was forced around and slammed against it.

\par But Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply; he was busy checking the tightness of the cords, his fin\-gers trembling uncontrollably, fumbling over the knots. Once sure that Harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn
\rquote t move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into Harry\rquote s mouth; then, without a word, he turned from Harry and hurried away. Harry couldn\rquote t 
make a sound, nor could he see where Wormtail had gone; he couldn\rquote t turn his head to see beyond the headstone; he could see only what was right in front of him.
\par Cedric\rquote s body was lying some twenty feet away. Some way beyond him, glinting in the starlight, lay the Triwizard Cup. Harry\rquote 
s wand was on the ground at his feet. The bundle of robes that Harry had thought was a baby was close by, at the foot of the grave. It seemed to be stirring fretfully. Harry watched it, and his scar seared with pain again ... and he sud\-
denly knew that he didn\rquote t want to see what was in those robes ... he didn\rquote t want that bundle opened ...
\par He could hear noises at his feet. He looked down, and saw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass, circling the head\-stone where he was tied. Wormtail\rquote 
s fast, wheezy breathing was growing louder again. It sounded as though he was forcing something heavy across the ground. Then he came back within Harry\rquote s range of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the 
foot of the grave. It was full of what seemed to be water \endash  Harry could hear it slopping around \endash  and it was larger than any cauldron Harry had ever used; a great stone belly large enough for a full-grown man to sit in.
\par The thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stir\-ring more persistently, as though it was trying to free itself. Now Wormtail was busying himself at the bottom of the caul\-
dron with a wand. Suddenly there were crackling flames beneath it. The large snake slithered away into the darkness.
\par The liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast. The sur\-face began not only to bubble, but also to send out fiery sparks, as though it was on fire. Steam was thickening, blur\-ring the outline of Wormtail tending the fire. The movements beneath
 the cloak became more agitated. And Harry heard the high, cold voice again.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Hurry!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par The whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now. It might have been encrusted with diamonds.
\par \lquote It is ready, master.\rquote 
\par \lquote Now ...\rquote  said the cold voice.
\par Wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground, revealing what was inside them, and Harry let out a yell that was stran\-gled in the wad of material blocking his mouth.
\par It was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone, and revealed something ugly, slimy and blind \endash  but worse, a hun\-
dred times worse. The thing Wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child, except that Harry had never seen anything less like a child. It was hairless and scaly-looking, a dark, raw, reddish black. Its arms and legs were 
thin and feeble, and its face \endash  no child alive ever had a face like that \endash  was flat and snake-like, with gleaming red eyes.
\par The thing seemed almost helpless; it raised its thin arms, put them around Wormtail\rquote s neck, and Wormtail lifted it. As he did so, his hood fell back, and Harry saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail\rquote 
s weak, pale face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron. For one moment, Harry saw the evil, flat face illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of th
e potion. And then Wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron; there was a hiss, and it vanished below the surface; Harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft thud.
\par Let it drown, Harry thought, his scar burning almost past endurance, please ... let it drown ...
\par Wormtail was speaking. His voice shook, he seemed fright\-ened beyond his wits. He raised his wand, closed his eyes, and spoke to the night. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote

\par The surface of the grave at Harry\rquote s feet cracked. Horrified, Harry watched as a fine trickle of dust rose into the air at Wormtail\rquote 
s command, and fell softly into the cauldron. The diamond surface of the water broke and hissed; it sent sparks in all directions, and turned a vivid, poisonous-looking blue.
\par And now Wormtail was whimpering. He pulled a long, thin, shining silver dagger from inside his robes. His voice broke into petrified sobs. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Flesh \endash

\par Harry realised what Wormtail was about to do a second before it happened \endash  he closed his eyes as tightly as he c
ould, but he could not block the scream that pierced the night, that went through Harry as though he had been stabbed with the dagger too. He heard something fall to the ground, heard Wormtail\rquote 
s anguished panting, then a sickening splash, as something was dropped into the cauldron. Harry couldn\rquote t bear to look ... but the potion had turned a burning red, the light of it shone through Harry\rquote s closed eyelids ...
\par Wormtail was gasping and moaning with agony. Not until Harry felt Wormtail\rquote s anguished breath on his face did he realise that Wormtail was right in front of him.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote B-blood of the enemy ... forcibly taken ... you will ... resurrect your foe.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 
\par Harry could do nothing to prevent it, he was tied too tightly ... squinting down, struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him, he saw the shining silver dagger shaking in Wormtail\rquote 
s remaining hand. He felt its point penetrate the crook of his right arm, and blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes. Wormtail, still panting with pain, fumbled in his pocket for a glass phial and held it to Harry\rquote 
s cut, so that a dribble of blood fell into it.
\par He staggered back to the cauldron with Harry\rquote s blood. He poured it inside. The liquid within turned, instantly, a blinding white. Wormtail, his job done, dropped to his kne
es beside the cauldron, then slumped sideways and lay on the ground, cradling the bleeding stump of his arm, gasping and sobbing.
\par The cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond sparks in all directions, so blindingly bright that it turned all else to vel\-vety blackness. Nothing happened ...
\par Let it have drowned, Harry thought, let it have gone wrong ...
\par And then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished. A surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead, obliterating everything in front of Harry, so that he couldn\rquote 
t see Wormtail or Cedric or anything but vapour hanging in the air ... it\rquote s gone wrong, he thought ... it\rquote s drowned ... please ... please let it be dead ...
\par But then, through the mist in front of him, he saw, with an icy surge of terror, the dark outline of a man, tall and skeletally thin, rising slowly from inside the cauldron.
\par \lquote Robe me,\rquote  said the high, cold voice from behind the steam, and Wormtail, sobbing and moaning, still cradling his mutilat\-ed arm, s
crambled to pick up the black robes from the ground, got to his feet, reached up, and pulled them one-handed over his master\rquote s head.
\par The thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at Harry ... and Harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years. Whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes, and a nose that was as flat as a snake\rquote 
s, with slits for nostrils ...

Voldemort looked away from Harry, and began examining his own body. His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cat\rquote 
s, gleamed still more brightly
 through the darkness. He held up his hands, and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight,
 
and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally long-fingered hands into a deep pocket, and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently, too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground, an
d thrown against the head\-stone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh.

 a skull, with a snake protruding from its mouth \endash  the same image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail\rquote s uncontrollable weeping.
\par \lquote It is back,\rquote  he said softly, \lquote they will all have noticed it ... and now, we shall see ... now we shall know ...\rquote 
\par He pressed his long, white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail\rquote s arm.
\par The scar on Harry\rquote s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl: Voldemort removed his fin\-gers from Wormtail\rquote s Mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black.

\par One of the men suddenly flung himself forwards, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort\rquote s feet.
\par \lquote Master!\rquote  he shrieked. \lquote Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!\rquote

\par The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around ... let the police come, he thought desperately ... anyone ... anything ...
\par Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping.
\par \lquote Get up, Avery,\rquote  said Voldemort softly. \lquote Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years ... I want thirteen years\rquote 
 repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not, Wormtail?\rquote 
\par He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob.
\par \lquote You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, master,\rquote  moaned Wormtail, \lquote please, master ... please ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yet you helped return me to my body,\rquote  said Voldemort cool\-ly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground. \lquote Worthless and trai\-torous as you are, you helped me ... and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers ...\rquote 
\par Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand\rquote 
s wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downwards and fixed itself upon Wormtail\rquote s bleeding wrist.
\par Wormtail\rquote s sobbing stopped 
abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig
 on the ground, and crushed it into powder.
\par \lquote My Lord,\rquote  he whispered. \lquote Master ... it is beautiful ... thank you ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 thank you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort\rquote s robes.
\par \lquote May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,\rquote  said Voldemort.
\par \lquote No, my Lord ... never, my Lord ...\rquote 
\par Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail\rquote s right.
\par \lquote Lucius, my slippery friend,\rquote  he whispered, halting before him. \lquote 
I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle-torture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Luciu
s ... your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay ... but might not your energies have been better directed towards finding and aiding your master?\rquote 
\par \lquote My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,\rquote  came Lucius Malfoy\rquote s voice swiftly from beneath the hood. \lquote 
Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have pre\-vented me \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?\rquote  said Voldemort lazily, and Mr Malfoy stopped talking abruptly. \lquote 
Yes, I know all about that, Lucius ... you have disappointed me ... I expect more faithful service in future.\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course, my Lord, of course ... you are merciful, thank you ...\rquote 
\par Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space \endash  large enough for two people \endash  which separated Malfoy and the next man.
\par \lquote The Lestranges should stand here,\rquote  said Voldemort quietly. \lquote But they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather tha
n renounce me ... when Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be honoured beyond their dreams. The Dementors will join us ... they are our natural allies ... we will recall the banished giants ... I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, 
and an army of creatures whom all fear ...\rquote 
\par He walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others, and spoke to them.
\par \lquote Macnair ... destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you, master ... thank you,\rquote  murmured Macnair.
\par \lquote And here,\rquote  Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures, \lquote we have Crabbe ... you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle?\rquote 
\par They bowed clumsily, muttering dully.
\par \lquote Yes, master ...\rquote 
\par \lquote We will, master ...\rquote 
\par \lquote The same goes for you, Nott,\rquote  said Voldemort quietly, as he walked past a stooped figure in Mr Goyle\rquote s shadow.
\par \lquote My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That will do,\rquote  said Voldemort.
\par He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there.
\par \lquote And here we have six missing Death Eaters ... three dead 
in my service. One, too cowardly to return ... he will pay. One, who I believe has left me for ever ... he will be killed, of course ... and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already re-entered my service.\rquote 
\par The Death Eaters stirred; Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at each other through their masks.
\par \lquote He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived tonight ...
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth, as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry\rquote s direction. \lquote Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honour.
\rquote 
\par There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy\rquote s voice spoke from under the mask.
\par \lquote Master, we crave to know ... we beg you to tell us ... how you have achieved this ... this miracle ... how you managed to return to us ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,\rquote  said Voldemort. \lquote And it begins \endash  and ends \endash  with my young friend here.\rquote 
\par He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake con\-tinued to circle.
\par \lquote You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?\rquote  Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. \lquote 
You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the attempt to save him \endash  and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen ... I could not touch the boy.\rquote 
\par Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers, and put it very close to Harry\rquote s cheek. \lquote His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice ... this is old 
magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it ... but no matter. I can touch him now.\rquote 
\par Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with the pain.
\par Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away, and continued addressing the Death Eaters. \lquote I miscalcu\-lated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the woman\rquote 
s foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon me. Aaah ... pain beyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepare
d me for it. I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost ... but still, I was alive. What I was, even I do not know ... I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality. You know my goal 
\endash  to
 conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked ... for I had not been killed, though the curse should have done it. Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means
 to help myself ... for I had no body, and every spell which might have helped me required the use of a wand ...
\par \lquote I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to exist ... I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited ... surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me ... one of them would come and per\-
form the magic I could not, to restore me to a body ... but I waited in vain ...\rquote 
\par The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters. Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing. \lquote 
Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others. But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me. I sometimes inhabited animals \endash 
 snakes, of course, being my preference \endash  but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill-adapted to perform magic ... and my possession of them shortened their lives; none of them lasted long ...
\par \lquote Then ... four years ago ... the means for my return seemed assured. A wizard \endash  young, foolish and gullible \endash 
 wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of ... for he was a teacher at Dumbledore\rquote 
s school ... he was easy to bend to my will ... he brought me back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he car\-ried out my orders. But my plan failed. I did not manage to steal the Philosopher
\rquote s Stone. I was not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted ... thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter ...\rquote 
\par Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry.
\par \lquote The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had been,\rquote  Voldemort continued. \lquote I returned to my hiding place far away, and I will not pretend to you that I didn\rquote t then fear that I m
ight never regain my powers ... yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour ... I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess ... and I had given up hope, now, that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me ...\rquote 
\par One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice.
\par \lquote And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost aban\-doned hope, it happened at last ... a servant returned to me: Wormtail here, who had faked his own death to escape justice, wa
s driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master. He sought me in the coun\-
try where it had long been rumoured I was hiding ... helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way. Wormtail has a curious affi
nity with rats, do you not, Wormtail? His filthy little friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them ...
\par \lquote But his journey ba
ck to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail? For, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food ... and whom should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Minist
ry of Magic?
\par \lquote Now see the way that fate favours Lord Voldemort. This might have been the end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail \endash  displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected of him \endash 
 convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a night-time stroll. He overpowered her ... he brought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams ... for \endash  with a little persuasion 
\endash  she became a verit\-able mine of information.
\par \lquote 
She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She told me many things ... but the means I u
sed to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and when I had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her. I disposed of her.\rquote 
\par Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless.
\par \lquote Wormtail\rquote s body, of course, was ill-adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much atten\-tion if seen. However, he was the able-bodied servant I needed, and, poor wizar
d though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimen\-
tary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth ... a spell or two of my own invention ... a little help from my dear Nagini\rquote  \endash  Voldemort\rquote 
s red eyes fell upon the continually cir\-cling snake \endash  \lquote a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided ... I was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong enough to travel.
\par \lquote There was no hope of stealing the Philosopher\rquote 
s Stone any more, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortal. I set my sights lower ... I would set\-tle for my old body back again, and my old strength.

\par \lquote I knew that to achieve this \endash  it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight \endash  I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant ...

\par \lquote My father\rquote s bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here, where he was buried. But the blood of a foe ... Wormtail would have had me use any wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated me ... as 
so many of them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potter\rquote 
s blood. I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago, for the lin\-gering protection his mother once gave him, would then reside in my veins, too ...
\par \lquote But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better pro\-tected than I think even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy\rquote 
s future. Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy\rquote s protection as long as he is in his relations\rquote 
 care. Not even I can touch him there ... then, of course, there was the Quidditch World Cup ... I thought his protection might be weaker
 there, away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that Muggle-loving fool from m
orning until night. So how could I take him?
\par \lquote Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins\rquote s information, of course. Use my one faithful Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy\rquote s name was entered into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure t
hat the boy won the Tournament \endash  that he touched the Triwizard Cup first \endash  the Cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore\rquote 
s help and protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is ... the boy you all believed had been my downfall ...\rquote 
\par Voldemort moved slowly forward, and turned to face Harry. He raised his wand. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Crucio!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\par It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end ... to black out ... to die ...
\par And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort\rquote s father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters\rquote  laughter.

\par \lquote You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,\rquote  said Voldemort. \lquote But I want there to be no mistake in anybody\rquote 
s mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowe
d to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,\rquote  he whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass, to where the Death Eaters stood watching.

There was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might have considered running for it, but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave, as the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter circle around him and Voldem
ort, so that the gaps where the missing Death Eaters should have stood were filled. Wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where Cedric\rquote s body lay, and returned with Harry\rquote s wand, which he thrust roughly into Harry\rquote 
s hand without looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed his place in the circle of watch\-ing Death Eaters.
\par \lquote You have been taught how to duel, Harry Potter?\rquote  said Voldemort softly, his red eyes glinting through the darkness.

and what use would it be, even if he could, to deprive Voldemort of his wand, when he was surrounded by Death Eaters, out
numbered by at least thirty to one? He had never learnt anything that could possibly fit him for this. He knew he was facing the thing against which Moody had always warned ... the unblockable Avada Kedavra curse \endash  and Voldemort was right \endash 
 his mother was not here to die for him this time ... he was quite unprotected ...
\par \lquote We bow to each other, Harry,\rquote  said Voldemort, bending a lit\-tle, but keeping his snake-like face upturned to Harry. \lquote Come, the niceties must be observed ... Dumbledore would like you to show manners ... bow to death, Harry ...

\par \lquote Very good,\rquote  said Voldemort softly, and as he raised his wand, the pressure bearing down upon Harry lifted too. \lquote And now you face me, like a man ... straight backed and proud, the way your father died ...
\par \lquote And now \endash  we duel.\rquote 
\par Voldemort raised his wand, and before Harry could do any\-thing to defend himself, bef

\par And then it stopped. Harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet; he was shaking as uncontrollably as Wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off; he staggered sideways into the wall of

\par Before Voldemort could stick his snake-like face around the headstone, Harry had stood up ... he gripped his wand tightly in his hand, thrust it out in front of him, and threw himself around the headstone, facing Voldemort.
\par Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Expelliarmus!\rquote , }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133

s long white fingers, too, were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating.
\par And then \endash  nothing could have prepared Harry for this \endash 
 he felt his feet lift from the ground. He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air, their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light. They were gliding away from the tombstone of Voldemort\rquote s fat
her, and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves ... The Death Eaters were shouting, they were asking Voldemort for instructions; they were closing in, re-forming the circle around Harry and Voldemort, the snake slithering
 at their heels, some of them drawing their wands \endash 
\par The golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort splintered: though the wands remained connected, a thousand more offshoots arced high over Harry and Voldemort, criss\-crossing all around them, until they w
ere enclosed in a golden, dome-shaped web, a cage of light, beyond which the Death Eaters circled like jackals, their cries strangely muffled now ...
\par \lquote Do nothing!\rquote  Voldemort shrieked to the Death Eaters, and Harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening, saw him fighting to break the thread of light still connecting his wand with Harry\rquote 
s; Harry held onto his wand more tightly, with both hands, and the golden thread remained unbroken. \lquote Do nothing unless I command you!\rquote  Voldemort shouted to the Death Eaters.
\par And then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air ... it was coming from every thread of the light-spun web vibrat\-ing around Harry and Voldemort. It was a sound Harry recog\-nised, though he had heard it only once before in his
 life ... phoenix song ...
\par It was the sound of hope to Harry ... the most beautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his life ... he felt as though the song was inside him instead of just around him ... it was the sound he connected with Dumbledore, 
and it was almost as though a friend was speaking in his ear ...

\par I know, Harry told the music, I know I mustn\rquote t ... but no sooner had he thought it, than the thing became much harder to do. His wand began to vibrate more powerfu
lly than ever ... and now the beam between him and Voldemort changed, too ... it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands \endash 
 Harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand, as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his way ... the direction of the beam\rquote s movement was now towards him, from Voldemort, and he felt his wand shudder angrily ...
\par As the nearest bead of light moved nearer to Harry\rquote s wand tip, the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame. The closer that bead moved, the harder Harry\rquote 
s wand vibrated; he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it; it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers \endash 
\par He concentrated every last particle of h
is mind upon forcing the bead backwards towards Voldemort, his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixated ... and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to move the other way ... and it was Voldem
ort\rquote s wand that was vibrating extra hard now ... Voldemort who looked astonished, and almost fearful ...
\par One of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemort\rquote s wand. Harry didn\rquote t understand why he was doing it, didn\rquote t know what it might achieve ... but he now con\-
centrated as he had never done in his life, on forcing that bead of light right back into Voldemort\rquote s wand ... and slowly ... very slowly ... it moved along the golden thread ... it trembled for a moment ... and then it connected ...
\par At once, Voldemort\rquote s wand began to emit echoing screams of pain ... then \endash  Voldemort\rquote s red eyes widened with shock \endash 
 a dense, smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanished ... the ghost of the hand he had made Wormtail ... more shouts of pain ... and then something much larger began to blossom from Voldemort\rquote 
s wand tip, a great, greyish something that looked as though it was made of the solidest, densest smoke ... it was a head ... now a chest and arms ... the torso of Cedric Diggory.
\par If ever Harr
y might have released his wand from shock, it would have been then, but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of golden light remained unbroken, even though the thick grey ghost of Cedric Diggory (was it a ghost? It looked so so
lid) emerged in its entirety from the end of Voldemort\rquote s wand, as though it was squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunnel ... and this shade of Cedric stood up, and looked up and down the golden thread of light, and spoke.
\par \lquote Hold on, Harry,\rquote  it said.
\par Its 
voice was distant and echoing. Harry looked at Voldemort ... his wide, red eyes were still shocked ... he had no more expected this than Harry had ... and, very dimly, Harry heard the frightened yells of the Death Eaters, prowling around the edges of the 
golden dome ...
\par More screams of pain from the wand ... and then something else emerged from its tip ... the dense shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms and torso ... an old man Harry had once seen in a dream was now pushing himself out of the en
d of the wand just as Cedric had done ... and his ghost, or his shadow, or whatever it was, fell next to Cedric\rquote s, and surveyed Harry and Voldemort, and the golden web, and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning on his walking stick ...

\par \lquote He was a real wizard, then?\rquote  the old man said, his eyes on Voldemort. \lquote Killed me, that one did ... you fight him, boy ...\rquote 
\par But already, yet another head was emerging ... and this head, grey as a smoky statue, was a woman\rquote s ... Harry, both arms shaking now, as he fought to keep his wand still, saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others, staring ...

\par The shadow of Bertha Jorkins surveyed the battle before her with wide eyes.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t let go, now!\rquote  she cried, and her voice echoed like Cedric\rquote s, as though from very far away. \lquote Don\rquote t let him get you, Harry \endash  don\rquote t let go!\rquote 
\par She and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web, while the Death Eaters flitted around the outside of it ... and Voldemort\rquote s dead v
ictims whispered as they circled the duellers, whispered words of encouragement to Harry, and hissed words Harry couldn\rquote t hear to Voldemort.
\par And now another head was emerging from the tip of Voldemort\rquote s wand ... and Harry knew when he saw it who it would b
e ... he knew, as though he had expected it from the moment when Cedric had appeared from the wand ... knew, because the woman appearing was the one he\rquote d thought of more than any other tonight ...
\par The smoky shadow of a young woman with long hair fell to the ground as Bertha had done, straightened up, and looked at him ... and Harry, his arms shaking madly now, looked back into the ghostly face of his mother.
\par \lquote Your father\rquote s coming ...\rquote  she said quietly. \lquote He wants to see you ... it will be all right ... hold on ...\rquote 
\par And he came ... first his head, then his body ... tall and untidy-haired like Harry, the smoky, shadowy form of James Potter blossomed from the end of Voldemort\rquote s wand, fell to the ground, and straightened like his wife. He walked close to Harry, l
ooking down at him, and he spoke in the same distant, echoing voice as the others, but quietly, so that Voldemort, his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around him, could not hear ...
\par \lquote When the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments ... but we will give you time ... you must get to the Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts ... do you understand, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  Harry gasped; fighting now to keep a hold on his wand, which was slipping and sliding beneath his fingers.
\par \lquote Harry ...\rquote  whispered the figure of Cedric, \lquote take my body back, will you? Take my body back to my parents ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I will,\rquote  said Harry, his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand.
\par \lquote Do it now,\rquote  whispered his father\rquote s voice. \lquote Be ready to run ... do it now ...\rquote 
\par \lquote NOW!\rquote  Harry yelled; he didn\rquote t think he could have held on for another moment anyway \endash  he pulled his wand upwards with an almighty wrench, and the golden thread broke; the cage of light vanished, the phoenix song died \endash 
 but the shad\-owy figures of Voldemort\rquote s victims did not disappear \endash  they were closing in upon Voldemort, shielding Harry from his gaze \endash 
\par And Harry ran as he had never run in his life, knocking two stunned Death Eaters aside as he passed; he zig-zagged behind headstones, feeling their curses following him, hearing them hit the headstones \endash 
 he was dodging curses and graves, pelting towards Cedric\rquote s body, no longer aware of the pain in his leg, his whole being concentrated on what he had to do \endash

\par \lquote You had an easier time of it than you should have done in that maze tonight, of course,\rquote  said Moody. \lquote 
That was because I was patrolling around it, able to see through the outer hedges, able to curse many obstacles out of your way. I Stunned Fleur Delacour as she passed. I put the Imperius cur

There was a blinding flash of red light, and with a great splintering and crashing, the door of Moody\rquote s office was blasted apart \endash 
\par Moody was thrown backwards onto the office floor. Harry, still staring at the place where Moody\rquote 
s face had been, saw Albus Dumbledore, Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall looking back at him out of the Foe-Glass. He looked around, and saw the three of them standing in the doorway, Dumbledore in front, his wand outstretched.
\par At that moment, Harry fully understood for the first time why people said Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort had ever feared. The look upon Dumbledore\rquote s face as he stared
 down at the unconscious form of Mad-Eye Moody was more terrible than Harry could ever have imagined. There was no benign smile upon Dumbledore\rquote 
s face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles. There was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of power radiated from Dumbledore as though he was giving off burning heat.
\par He stepped into the office, placed a foot underneath Moody\rquote s unconscious body and kicked him over onto his back, so that his face was visible. Snape followed him, looking into
 the Foe-Glass, where his own face was still visible, glaring into the room.
\par Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry.
\par \lquote Come along, Potter,\rquote  she whispered. The thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry. \lquote Come along ... hospital wing ...\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Dumbledore sharply.
\par \lquote Dumbledore, he ought to \endash  look at him \endash  he\rquote s been through enough tonight \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He will stay, Minerva, because he needs to understand,\rquote  said Dumbledore curtly. \lquote Understanding is the first step to accep\-tance, and onl
y with acceptance can there be recovery. He needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suf\-fered tonight, and why.\rquote 
\par \lquote Moody,\rquote  Harry said. He was still in a state of complete dis\-belief. \lquote How can it have been Moody?\rquote 
\par \lquote This is not Alastor Moody,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly. \lquote You have never known Alastor Moody. The real Moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight. The moment he took you, I knew \endash  and I followed.
\rquote 
\par Dumbledore bent down over Moody\rquote s limp form and put a hand inside his robes. He pulled out Moody\rquote s hip-flask, and a set of keys on a ring. Then he turned to Professor McGonagall and Snape.
\par \lquote Severus, please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess, and then go down to the kitchens, and bring up the house-elf called Winky. Minerva, kindly go down to Hagrid\rquote 
s house, where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch. Take the dog up to my office, tell him I will be with him shortly, then come back here.\rquote 
\par If either Snape or McGonagall found these instructions peculiar, they hid their confusion. Both turned at once, and left the office. Dumbledore walked over to the trunk with seven locks, fitted the first key in the lock, and opened it. It con\-
tained a mass of spellbooks. Dumbledore closed the tr
unk, placed a second key in the second lock, and opened the trunk again. The spellbooks had vanished; this time it contained an assortment of broken Sneakoscopes, some parchment and quills, and what looked like a silvery Invisibility Cloak. Harry watched,
 
astounded, as Dumbledore placed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth keys in their respective locks, reopening the trunk, and each time revealing different contents. Then he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw open the lid, and Harry let out a cry of 
amazement.
\par He was looking down into a kind of pit, an underground room, and lying on the floor some ten feet below, apparently fast asleep, thin and starved in appearance, was the real Mad-Eye Moody. His wooden leg was gone, the socket which should have hel
d the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid, and chunks of his grizzled hair were missing. Harry stared, thunderstruck, between the sleeping Moody in the trunk, and the unconscious Moody lying on the floor of the office.
\par Dumbledore climbed into the trunk, lowered himself and fell lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping Moody. He bent over him.
\par \lquote Stunned \endash  controlled by the Imperius curse \endash  very weak,\rquote  he said. \lquote Of course, they would have needed to keep him alive. Harry, throw down the impostor\rquote s cloak,
 Alastor is freezing. Madam Pomfrey will need to see him, but he seems in no immediate danger.\rquote 
\par Harry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak, tucked it around him, and clambered out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the hip-flask tha
t stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over. A thick glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor.
\par \lquote Polyjuice Potion, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote You see the sim\-plicity of it, and the brilliance. For Moody never }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 does }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 drink except from his hip-flask, he\rquote 
s well known for it. The impostor needed, of course, to keep the real Moody close by, so that he could continue making the Potion. You see his hair ...\rquote  Dumbledore looked down on the Moody in the trunk. \lquote 
The impostor has been cutting it off all year, see where it is uneven? But I think, in the excitement of tonight, our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he should have done ... on the hour ... every hour ... we shall see.\rquote 

\par Dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it, his eyes fixed upon the unconscious Moody on the floor. Harry stared at him, too. Minutes passed in silence ...
\par Then, before Harry\rquote s very eyes, the face of the man on the floor began to change. The scars were disappearing, the skin was b
ecoming smooth; the mangled nose became whole, and started to shrink. The long mane of grizzled grey hair was withdrawing into the scalp, and turning the colour of straw. Suddenly, with a loud }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 clunk, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 the wooden leg fell away as a nor\-mal leg regrew in its 
place; next moment, the magical eyeball had popped out of the man\rquote s face as a real eye replaced it; it rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every direction.
\par Harry saw a man lying before him, pale-skinned, slightly freckled, with a mop of fair hair. He knew who he was. He had seen him in Dumbledore\rquote 
s Pensieve, had watched him being led away from court by the Dementors, trying to convince Mr Crouch that he was innocent ... but he was lined around the eyes now, and looked much older ...
\par There were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor. Snape had returned with Winky at his heels. Professor McGonagall was right behind them.
\par \lquote Crouch!\rquote  Snape said, stopping dead in the doorway. \lquote Barty Crouch!\rquote 
\par \lquote Good heavens,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, stopping dead and staring down at the man on the floor.
\par Filthy, dishevelled, Winky peered around Snape\rquote s legs. Her mouth opened wide and she let out a piercing shriek. \lquote Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?\rquote 
\par She flung herself forwards onto the young man\rquote s chest. \lquote You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed master\rquote s son!\rquote 
\par \lquote He is simply Stunned, Winky,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Step aside, please. Severus, you have the Potion?\rquote 
\par Snape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid; the Veritaserum with which he had threatened Harry in class. Dumbledore got up, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position against the wall beneath t
he Foe-Glass, in which the reflections of Dumbledore, Snape and McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all. Winky remained on her knees, trembling, her hands over her face. Dumbledore forced the man\rquote 
s mouth open, and poured three drops inside it. Then he pointed his wand at the man\rquote s chest, and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 \lquote Rennervate.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39

\par Crouch\rquote s son opened his eyes. His face was slack, his gaze unfocused. Dumbledore knelt before him, so that their faces were level.
\par \lquote Can you hear me?\rquote  Dumbledore asked quietly.
\par The man\rquote s eyelids flickered.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  he muttered.
\par \lquote I would like you to tell us,\rquote  said Dumbledore softly, \lquote how you come to be here. How did you escape from Azkaban?\rquote 
\par Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat, expressionless voice. \lquote My mother sav
ed me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favour to her. He loved her as he had never loved me. He agreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draught of Polyjuice Potion, containing one of my mother\rquote 
s hairs. She took a draught of Polyjuice Potion, containing one of my hairs. We took on each other\rquote s appearance.\rquote 
\par Winky was shaking her head, trembling. \lquote Say no more, Master Barty, say no more, you is getting your father into trouble!\rquote 
\par But Crouch took another deep breath, and continued in the same flat voice. \lquote 
The Dementors are blind. They sensed one healthy, one dying person entering Azkaban. They sensed one healthy, one dying person leaving it. My father smuggled me out, disguised as my mother, in case any prisoners were watch\-ing through their doors.
\par \lquote My mother died a short while afterwards in Azkaban. She was careful to drink Polyjuice Potion until the end. She was buried under my name, and bearing my appearance. Everyone believed her to be me.\rquote 
\par The man\rquote s eyelids flickered.
\par \lquote And what did your father do with you, when he had got you home?\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly.
\par \lquote Staged my mother\rquote s death. A quiet, private funeral. That grave is empty. The house-elf nursed me back to health. Then I had to be concealed. I had to be controll
ed. My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me. When I had recovered my strength, I thought only of finding my master ... of return\-ing to his service.\rquote 
\par \lquote How did your father subdue you?\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote The Imperius curse,\rquote  Crouch said. \lquote I was under my father\rquote 
s control. I was forced to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night. I was always with the house-elf. She was my keeper and carer. She pitied me. She persuaded my father to give me occa\-sional treats. Rewards for my good behaviour.\rquote 
\par \lquote Master Barty, Master Barty,\rquote  sobbed Winky through her hands. \lquote You isn\rquote t ought to tell them, we is getting in trouble ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive?\rquote  said Dumbledore softly. \lquote Did anyone know except your father, and the house-elf?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Crouch, his eyelids flickering again. \lquote A witch in my father\rquote s office. Bertha Jorkins. She came to the house, with papers for my father\rquote 
s signature. He was not at home. Winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen, to me. But Bertha Jorkins heard Winky talking to me. She came to investi\-
gate. She heard enough to guess who was hiding under the Invisibility Cloak. My father arrived home. She confronted him. He put a very powerful Memory Charm on her to make her forget what she\rquote d found out. Too powerful. He said it dam\-
aged her memory permanently.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why is she coming to nose in my master\rquote s private business?\rquote  sobbed Winky. \lquote Why isn\rquote t she leaving us be?\rquote 
\par \lquote Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Winky talked my father into it,\rquote  said Crouch, still in the same monotonous voice. \lquote 
She spent months persuading him. I had not left the house for years. I had loved Quidditch. Let him go, she said. He will be in his Invisibility Cloak. He can watch. Let him smell fresh air for once. She said m
y mother would have wanted it. She told my father that my mother had died to give me freedom. She had not saved me for a life of imprisonment. He agreed in the end.
\par \lquote 
It was carefully planned. My father led myself and Winky up to the Top Box early in the day. Winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father. I was to sit there, invisible. When everyone had left the box, we would emerge. Winky would appear to b
e alone. Nobody would ever know.
\par \lquote But Winky didn\rquote t know that I was growing stronger. I was starting to fight my father\rquote s Imperius curse. There were times when I was almost myself again. There were brief periods when I seemed outside his control. It happened
, there, in the Top Box. It was like waking from a deep sleep. I found myself out in public, in the middle of the match, and I saw a wand sticking out of a boy\rquote 
s pocket in front of me. I had not been allowed a wand since before Azkaban. I stole it. Winky didn\rquote t know. Winky is frightened of heights. She had her face hid\-den.\rquote 
\par \lquote Master Barty, you bad boy!\rquote  whispered Winky, tears trickling between her fingers.
\par \lquote So you took the wand,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote and what did you do with it?\rquote 
\par \lquote We went back to the tent,\rquote  said Crouch. \lquote 
Then we heard them. We heard the Death Eaters. The ones who had never been to Azkaban. The ones who had never suffered for my master. They had turned their backs on him. They were not enslaved, as I was. They were free to seek him, but they did
 not. They were merely making sport of Muggles. The sound of their voices awoke me. My mind was clearer than it had been in years. I was angry. I had the wand. I wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master. My father had left the tent, he had 
g
one to free the Muggles. Winky was afraid to see me so angry. She used her own brand of magic to bind me to her. She pulled me from the tent, pulled me into the forest, away from the Death Eaters. I tried to hold her back. I wanted to return to the campsi
te. I wanted to show those Death Eaters what loyal\-ty to the Dark Lord meant, and to punish them for their lack of it. I used the stolen wand to cast the Dark Mark into the sky.
\par \lquote Ministry wizards arrived. They shot Stunning Spells every\-where. One of the Spells came through the trees where Winky and I stood. The bond connecting us was broken. We were both Stunned.
\par \lquote When Winky was discovered, my father knew I must be nearby. He searched the bushes where she had been found, and felt me lying there. He waited u
ntil the other Ministry members had left the forest. He put me back under the Imperius curse, and took me home. He dismissed Winky. She had failed him. She had let me acquire a wand. She had almost let me escape.\rquote 
\par Winky let out a wail of despair.
\par \lquote Now it was just Father and I, alone in the house. And then ... and then ...\rquote  Crouch\rquote s head rolled on his neck, and an insane grin spread across his face. \lquote My master came for me.
\par \lquote He arrived at our house late one night, in the arms of his servant Wormtail. My master had found out that I was still alive. He had captured Bertha Jorkins in Albania. He had tor\-
tured her. She told him a great deal. She told him about the Triwizard Tournament. She told him the old Auror, Moody, was going to teach at Hogwarts. He tortured 
her until he broke through the Memory Charm my father had placed upon her. She told him I had escaped from Azkaban. She told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me seeking my master. And so my master knew that I was still his faithful servant 
\endash  perhaps the most faithful of all. My master conceived a plan, based upon the information Bertha had given him. He needed me. He arrived at our house near midnight. My father answered the door.\rquote 
\par The smile spread wider over Crouch\rquote s face, as though recall\-ing the sweetest memory of his life. Winky\rquote s petrified brown eyes were visible through her fingers. She seemed too appalled to speak.
\par \lquote It was very quick. My father was placed under the Imperius curse by my master. Now my father was the one imprisoned, controlle
d. My master forced him to go about his business as usual, to act as though nothing was wrong. And I was released. I awoke. I was myself again, alive as I hadn\rquote t been in years.\rquote 
\par \lquote And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do?\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote He asked me whe
ther I was ready to risk everything for him. I was ready. It was my dream, my greatest ambition, to serve him, to prove myself to him. He told me he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts. A servant who would guide Harry Potter through the Triwiza
rd Tournament without appearing to do so. A servant who would watch over Harry Potter. Ensure he reached the Triwizard Cup. Turn the Cup into a Portkey, which would take the first person to touch it to my master. But first \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You needed Alastor Moody,\rquote  said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were blazing, though his voice remained calm.
\par \lquote Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand. We journeyed to his house. Moody put up a strug\-gle. There was a commotion. We managed to subdue him just in 
time. Forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the Potion. I drank it, I became Moody\rquote 
s double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who 
had heard a disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set the dustbins off. Then I packed up Moody\rquote 
s clothes and Dark detectors, put them in the trunk with Moody, and set off for Hogwarts. I kept him alive, under the Imperius curse. I wanted to be able to ques\-
tion him. To find out about his past, learn his habits, so that I could fool even Dumbledore. I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice Potion. The other ingredients were 
easy. I stole Boomslang skin from the dungeons. When the Potions master found me in his office, I said I was under orders to search it.\rquote 
\par \lquote And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my father\rquote s house, and to keep watch over my father.\rquote 
\par \lquote But your father escaped,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius curse just as I had done. There were periods where he knew what was happening. My master decided it was no l
onger safe for my father to leave the house. He forced him to send letters to the Ministry instead. He made him write and say he was ill. But Wormtail neglected his duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped. My master guessed that he was heading
 for Hogwarts. My father was going to tell Dumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to admit that he had smuggled me from Azkaban.
\par \lquote My master sent me word of my father\rquote s escape. He told me to stop him at all costs. So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry Potter. The map that had almost ruined everything.\rquote 
\par \lquote Map?\rquote  said Dumbledore quickly. \lquote What map is this?\rquote 
\par \lquote Potter\rquote s map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape\rquote 
s office one night. He thought I was my father as we have the same first name. I took the map from Potter that night. I told him my father hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my father was after Snape.
\par \lquote For a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwar

Dumbledore stood up. He stared down at Barty Crouch for a moment with disgust on his face. Then he raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it, ropes which twisted them\-selves around Barty Crouch, binding him tightly.

Minerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry upstairs?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. She looked slightly nauseous, as though she had just watched someone being sick. However, when she drew out her wand and pointed it at Barty Crouch, her hand was quite steady.
\par \lquote Severus,\rquote  Dumbledore turned to Snape, \lquote please tell Madam Pomfrey to come down here. We need to get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing. Then go down into the grounds, find Cornelius Fudge, and bring him up to this 
office. He will undoubtedly want to question Crouch himself. Tell him I will be in the hospital wing in half an hour\rquote s time if he needs me.\rquote 
\par Snape nodded silently and swept out of the room.
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote  Dumbledore said gently.
\par Harry got up and swayed again; the pain in his leg, which he had not noticed all the time he had listened to Crouch, now returned in full measure. He also realised that he was shaking. Dumbledore gripped his arm, and helped him out into the dark corridor.

\par \lquote I want you to come up to my office first, Harry,\rquote  he said quietly, as they headed up the passageway. \lquote Sirius is waiting for us there.\rquote 
\par Harry nodded. A kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon him, but he did not care; he was even glad of it. He didn\rquote t want to have to think about anything that had happened since he had first touched the Triwizard Cup. He didn
\rquote t want to have to examine the memories, fresh and sharp as photographs, which kept flashing across his mind. Mad-Eye Moody, inside the trunk. Wormtail, slumped on 
the ground, cradling his stump of an arm. Voldemort, rising from the steaming cauldron. Cedric ... dead ... Cedric, asking to be returned to his parents ...
\par \lquote Professor,\rquote  Harry mumbled, \lquote where are Mr and Mrs Diggory?\rquote 
\par \lquote They are with Professor Sprout,\rquote  said Dumbledore. His voice, which had been so calm throughout the interrogation of Barty Crouch, shook very slightly for the first time. \lquote She was Head of Cedric\rquote s house, and knew him best.
\rquote 
\par They had reached the stone gargoyle. Dumbledore gave the password, it sprang aside, and he and Harry went up the mov\-ing spiral staircase to the oak door. Dumbledore pushed it open.
\par Sirius was standing there. His face was white and gaunt as it had been when he had escaped Azkaban. In one swift moment, he had crossed the room. \lquote Harry, are you all right? I knew it \endash  I knew something like this \endash  what happened?
\rquote 
\par His hands shook as he helped Harry into a chair in front of the desk.
\par \lquote What happened?\rquote  he asked, more urgently.
\par Dumbledore began to tell Sirius everything Barty Crouch had said. Harry was only half listening. So tired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until he fell asleep, and didn\rquote 
t have to think or feel any more.
\par There was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix had left his perch, flown across the office, and landed on Harry\rquote s knee.
\par \lquote  \rquote Lo, Fawkes,\rquote  said Harry quietly. He stroked the phoenix\rquote s beautiful scarlet and gold plumage. Fawkes blinked peacefully up at him. There was something comforting about his warm weight.
\par Dumbledore had stopped talking. He sat down opposite Harry, behind his desk. He was looking at Harry, who avoided his eyes. Dumbledore was going to question him. He was going to make Harry relive everything.
\par \lquote I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote We can leave that \rquote til morning, can\rquote t we, Dumbledore?\rquote  said Sirius harshly. He had put a hand on Harry\rquote s shoulder. \lquote Let him have a sleep. Let him rest.\rquote 
\par Harry felt a rush of gratitude towards Sirius, but Dumbledore took no notice of Sirius\rquote  words. He leant forward towards Harry. Very unwillingly, Harry raised his head, and looked into those blue eyes.
\par \lquote If I thought I could help you,\rquote  Dumbledore said gently, \lquote by putting you into an enchanted sleep, and allowing you to post\-
pone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight, I would do it. But I know better. Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse
 when you finally feel it. You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you. I ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time. I ask you to tell us what happened.\rquote 
\par The phoenix let out one soft, quavering note. It shivered in the air, and Harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach, warming him, and strengthening him.
\par He took a deep breath, and began to tell them. As he spoke, visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise befo
re his eyes; he saw the sparkling surface of the Potion which had revived Voldemort; he saw the Death Eaters Apparating between the graves around them; he saw Cedric\rquote s body, lying on the ground beside the Cup.
\par Once or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his hand still tight on Harry\rquote 
s shoulder, but Dumbledore raised his hand to stop him, and Harry was glad of this, because it was easier to keep going now he had started. It was even a relief; he felt almost as though something pois\-o
nous was being extracted from him; it was costing him every bit of determination he had to keep talking, yet he sensed that once he had finished, he would feel better.
\par When Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger, however, Sirius let out a 
vehement exclamation; and Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry started. Dumbledore walked around the desk and told Harry to stretch out his arm. Harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn, and the cut beneath them.
\par \lquote He said my blood would make him stronger than if he\rquote d used someone else\rquote s,\rquote  Harry told Dumbledore. \lquote He said the pro\-tection my \endash  my mother left in me \endash  he\rquote d have it, too. And he was right \endash 
 he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face.\rquote 
\par For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore\rquote s eyes. But next sec\-
ond, Harry was sure he had imagined it, for when Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry had ever seen him.
\par \lquote Very well,\rquote  he said, sitting down again. \lquote Voldemort has over\-come that particular barrier. Harry, continue, please.\rquote 
\par Harry went on; he explained how Voldemort had emerged from the cauldron, and told them all he could remember of Voldemort\rquote s speech to the Death Eaters. Then he told how Voldemort had untied him, returned his wand to him, and pre\-pared to duel.

\par But when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and Voldemort\rquote s wands, he found his throat obstructed. He tried to keep talking, but the memories of what had come out of Voldemort\rquote 
s wand were flooding into his mind. He could see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha Jorkins ... his mother ... his father ...
\par He was glad when Sirius broke the silence.
\par \lquote The wands connected?\rquote  he said, looking from Harry to Dumbledore. \lquote Why?\rquote 
\par Harry looked up again at Dumbledore, on whose face there was an arrested look.
\par \lquote Priori Incantatem,\rquote  he muttered.
\par His eyes gazed into Harry\rquote s and it was almost as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them.
\par \lquote The reverse spell effect?\rquote  said Sirius sharply.
\par \lquote Exactly,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Harry\rquote s wand and Voldemort\rquote s wand share cores. Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0

\rquote s knee.
\par \lquote My wand\rquote s feather came from Fawkes?\rquote  Harry said, amazed.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Mr Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand, the moment you left his shop four years ago.\rquote 
\par \lquote So what happens when a wand meets its brother?\rquote  said Sirius.
\par \lquote They will not work properly against each other,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote If, however, the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle ... a very rare effect will take place.
\par \lquote One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed \endash  in reverse. The most recent first ... and then those which preceded it ...\rquote 
\par He looked interrogatively at Harry, and Harry nodded.
\par \lquote Which means,\rquote  said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes upon Harry\rquote s face, \lquote that some form of Cedric must have reappeared.\rquote 
\par Harry nodded again.
\par \lquote Diggory came back to life?\rquote  said Sirius sharply.
\par \lquote No spell can reawaken the dead,\rquote  said Dumbledore heavily. \lquote All that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo. A shadow of the living Cedric would have emerged from the wand ... am I correct, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote He spoke to me,\rquote  Harry said. He was suddenly shaking again. The ... the ghost Cedric, or whatever he was, spoke.\rquote 
\par \lquote An echo,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote which retained Cedric\rquote s appear\-ance and character. I am guessing other such forms appeared ... less recent victims of Voldemort\rquote s wand ...\rquote 
\par \lquote An old man,\rquote  Harry said, his throat still constricted. \lquote Bertha Jorkins. And ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Your parents?\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Sirius\rquote  grip on Harry\rquote s shoulder was now so tight it was painful.
\par \lquote The last murders the wand performed,\rquote  said Dumbledore, nodding. \lquote In reverse order. More would have appeared, of course, had you maintained the connection. Very well, Harry, these echoes, these shadows ... what did they do?\rquote 

\par Harry described how the figures which had emerged from the wand had prowled the edges of the golden web, how Voldemort had seemed to fear them, how the shadow of Harry\rquote s father had told him what to do, how Cedric\rquote s had 
made its final request.
\par At this point, Harry found he could not continue. He looked around at Sirius, and saw that he had his face in his hands.
\par Harry suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left his knee. The phoenix had fluttered to the floor. It was resting its beauti\-ful head against Harry\rquote 
s injured leg, and thick, pearly tears were falling from its eyes onto the wound left by the spider. The pain vanished. The skin mended. His leg was repaired.
\par \lquote I will say it again,\rquote  said Dumbledore, as the phoenix rose into the air, and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door. \lquote You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expect\-
ed of you tonight, Harry. You have shown bravery equal to those who died fighting Voldemort at the height of his powers. You have shouldered a grown wizard\rquote s burden and found your\-self equal to it \endash 
 and you have now given us all that we have a right to expect. You will come with me to the hospital wing. I do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight. A Sleeping Potion, and some peace ... Sirius, would you like to stay with him?\rquote 
\par Sirius nodded, and stood up. He transformed back into the great black dog, and walked with Harry and Dumbledore out of the office, accompanying them down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing.
\par When Dumbledore pushed open the door, Harry saw Mrs Weasley, Bill, Ron and Hermione grouped around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey. They appeared to be demanding to know where Harry was and what had happened to him.
\par All of them whipped around as Harry, Dumbledore and the black dog entered, and Mrs Weasley let out a kind of muffled scream. \lquote Harry! Oh, Harry!\rquote 
\par She started to hurry towards him, but Dumbledore moved between them.
\par \lquote Molly,\rquote  he said, holding up a hand, \lquote please listen to me for a moment. Harry has been t
hrough a terrible ordeal tonight. He has just had to relive it for me. What he needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet. If he would like you all to stay with him,\rquote  he added, looking around at Ron, Hermione and Bill, too, \lquote 
you may do so. But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer, and certainly not this evening.\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley nodded. She was very white.
\par She rounded on Ron, Hermione and Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed, \lquote Did you hear? He needs quiet!\rquote 
\par \lquote Headmaster,\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey, staring at the great black dog that was Sirius, \lquote may I ask what \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while,\rquote  said Dumbledore simply. \lquote I assure you, he is extremely well trained. Harry \endash  I will wait while you get into bed.\rquote 
\par Harry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to Dumbledore for asking the others not to question him. It wasn\rquote t as though he didn\rquote 
t want them there; but the thought of explaining it all over again, the idea of reliving it one more time, was more than he could stand.
\par \lquote I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I would like you to remain here tomorrow, until I have spoken to the school.\rquote  He left.
\par As Madam Pomfrey led Harry to a nearby bed, he caught sight of the real Moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the room. His wooden leg and magical eye were lying on the bedside table.
\par \lquote Is he OK?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote He\rquote ll be fine,\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey, giving Harry some pyja\-mas and pulling screens around him. He took 
off his robes, pulled on the pyjamas and got into bed. Ron, Hermione, Bill, Mrs Weasley and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him. Ron and Hermione were looking at him almost cautiously, as though scar
ed of him.
\par \lquote I\rquote m all right,\rquote  he told them. \lquote Just tired.\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley\rquote s eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bed\-covers unnecessarily.
\par Madam Pomfrey, who had bustled off to her office, returned holding a goblet and a small bottle of some purple potion.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll need to drink all of this, Harry,\rquote  she said. \lquote It\rquote s a potion for dreamless sleep.\rquote 
\par Harry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls. He felt himself becoming drowsy at once. Everything around him became hazy; the lamps around the hospital wing seemed
 to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen around his bed; his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather mattress. Before he could finish the Potion, before he could say another word, his exhaustion had carri
ed him off to sleep.

\par \lquote They\rquote ll wake him if they don\rquote t shut up!\rquote 
\par \lquote What are they shouting about? Nothing else can have hap\-pened, can it?\rquote 
\par Harry opened his eyes blearily. Someone had removed his glasses. He could see the fuzzy outlines of Mrs Weasley and Bill close by. Mrs Weasley was on her feet.
\par \lquote That\rquote s Fudge\rquote s voice,\rquote  she whispered. \lquote And that\rquote s Minerva McGonagall\rquote s, isn\rquote t it? But what are they arguing about?\rquote 
\par Now Harry could hear them, too: people shouting and run\-ning towards the hospital wing.
\par \lquote Regrettable, but all the same, Minerva \endash \rquote  Cornelius Fudge was saying loudly.
\par \lquote You should never have brought it inside the castle!\rquote  yelled Professor McGonagall. \lquote When Dumbledore finds out \endash \rquote 
\par Harry heard hospital doors burst open. Unnoticed by any of the people around his bed, all of whom were staring at the door as Bill pulled back the screens, Harry sat up, and put his glasses back on.
\par Fudge came striding up the ward. Professors McGonagall and Snape were at his heels.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Dumbledore?\rquote  Fudge demanded of Mrs Weasley.
\par \lquote He\rquote s not here,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley angrily. \lquote This is a hospital wing, Minister, don\rquote t you think you\rquote d do better to \endash \rquote 
\par But the door opened, and Dumbledore came sweeping up the ward.
\par \lquote What has happened?\rquote  said Dumbledore sharply, looking from Fudge to Professor McGonagall. \lquote Why are you disturbing these people? Minerva, I\rquote m surprised at you \endash  I asked you to stand guard over Barty Crouch \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote There is no need to stand guard over him any more, Dumbledore!\rquote  she shrieked. \lquote The Minister has seen to that!\rquote 
\par Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall lose control like this. There were angry blotches of colour in her cheeks, her hands were balled into fists; she was trembling with fury.
\par \lquote When we told Mr Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight\rquote s events,\rquote  said Snape, in a low voice, \lquote 
he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question. He insisted on summoning a Dementor to accompany him into the castle. He brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I told him you would not agree, Dumbledore!\rquote  stormed Professor McGonagall. \lquote I told him you would never allow Dementors to set foot inside the castle, but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote My dear woman!\rquote  roared Fudge, who likewise looked angri\-er than Harry had ever seen him. \lquote As Minister for Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous \endash \rquote 

\par But Professor McGonagall\rquote s voice drowned Fudge\rquote s.
\par \lquote The moment that \endash  that thing entered the room,\rquote  she screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over, \lquote it swooped down on Crouch and \endash  and \endash \rquote 
\par Harry felt a chill in his stomach, as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened. He did not need her to finish her sentence. He knew what the Dementor must 
have done. It had administered its fatal kiss to Barty Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his mouth. He was worse than dead.
\par \lquote By all accounts, he is no loss!\rquote  blustered Fudge. \lquote It seems he has been responsible for several deaths!\rquote 
\par \lquote But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,\rquote  said Dumbledore. He was staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. \lquote He cannot give evidence about why he killed those people.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why he killed them? Well, that\rquote s no mystery, is it?\rquote  blustered Fudge. \lquote He was a raving lunatic! From what Minerva and Severus have told me, he seems to have thought he was doing it all on You-Know-Who\rquote s instructions!
\rquote

 Dumbledore said. \lquote Those people\rquote s deaths were mere by-products of a plan to restore Voldemort to full strength again. The plan succeeded. Voldemort has been restored to his body.\rquote 
\par Fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face. Dazed and blinking, he stared back at Dumbledore as if he couldn\rquote t quite believe what he had just heard.
\par He began to splutter, still goggling at Dumbledore. \lquote You-Know-Who ... returned? Preposterous. Come now, Dumbledore ...\rquote 
\par \lquote As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote we heard Barty Crouch confess. Under the influ\-ence of Veritaserum, he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and how Voldemort \endash

\par \lquote When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported straight to Voldemort,\rquote  said Dumbledore steadily. \lquote He witnessed Lord Voldemort\rquote s rebirth. I will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office.\rquote 

\par Dumbledore glanced around at Harry and saw that he was awake, but shook his head, and said, \lquote I am afraid I cannot per\-mit you to question Harry tonight.\rquote 
\par Fudge\rquote s curious smile lingered.
\par He too glanced at Harry, then looked back at Dumbledore, and said, \lquote You are \endash  er \endash  prepared to take Harry\rquote s word on this, are you, Dumbledore?\rquote 
\par There was a moment\rquote s silence, which was broken by Sirius growling. His hackles were raised, and he was baring his teeth at Fudge.
\par \lquote Certainly I believe Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore. His eyes were blazing now. \lquote I heard Crouch\rquote s confession, and I heard Harry\rquote s account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make 
sense, they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.\rquote 
\par Fudge still had that strange smile on his face. Once again, he glanced at Harry before answering. \lquote You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who ... well ...\rquote 
\par Fudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly under\-stood.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve been reading Rita Skeeter, Mr Fudge,\rquote  he said quietly.
\par Ron, Hermione, Mrs Weasley and Bill all jumped. None of them had realised that Harry was awake.
\par Fudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face.
\par \lquote And if I have?\rquote  he said, looking at Dumbledore. \lquote If I have discovered that you\rquote ve been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet? A Parselmouth, eh? And having funny turns all over the place \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar?\rquote  said Dumbledore coolly.
\par \lquote You admit that he has been having these pains, then?\rquote  said Fudge quickly. \lquote Headaches? Nightmares? Possibly \endash  hallucina\-tions?\rquote 
\par \lquote Listen to me, Cornelius,\rquote  said Dumbledore, taking a step towards Fudge, and once again he seemed to radiate that inde\-finable sense of power that Harry had felt after Dumbledore had Stunned young Crouch. \lquote 
Harry is as sane as you or I. That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains. I believe it hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by, or feeling particu\-larly murderous.\rquote 
\par Fudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore, but he looked no less stubborn. \lquote You\rquote ll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I\rquote ve never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Look, I saw Voldemort come back!\rquote  Harry shouted. He tried to get out of bed again, but Mrs Weasley forced him back. \lquote I saw the Death Eaters! I can give you their names! Lucius Malfoy \endash \rquote 
\par Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape\rquote s eyes flew back to Fudge.
\par \lquote Malfoy was cleared!\rquote  said Fudge, visibly affronted. \lquote A very old family \endash  donations to excellent causes \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Macnair!\rquote  Harry continued.
\par \lquote Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!\rquote 
\par \lquote Avery \endash  Nott \endash  Crabbe \endash  Goyle \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years ago!\rquote  said Fudge angrily. \lquote You could have found those names in old reports of the trials! For heaven\rquote s sake, Dumbledore 
\endash  the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year, too \endash  his tales are getting taller, and you\rquote re still swallowing them \endash  the boy can talk to snakes, Dumbledore, and you still think he\rquote s trustworthy?
\rquote 
\par \lquote You fool!\rquote  Professor McGonagall cried. \lquote Cedric Diggory! Mr Crouch! These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic!\rquote 
\par \lquote I see no evidence to the contrary!\rquote  shouted Fudge, now matching her anger, his face purpling. \lquote It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilise every\-
thing we have worked for these last thirteen years!\rquote 
\par Harry couldn\rquote t believe what he was hearing. He had always thought of Fudge as a kind
ly figure, a little blustering, a little pompous, but essentially good-natured. But now a short, angry wizard stood before him, refusing, point-blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world \endash 
 to believe that Voldemort could have risen.
\par \lquote Voldemort has returned,\rquote  Dumbledore repeated. \lquote 
If you accept that fact straight away, Fudge, and take the necessary measures, we may still be able to save the situation. The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the Dementors \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Preposterous!\rquote  shouted Fudge again. \lquote Remove the Dementors! I\rquote d be kicked out of office for suggesting it! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the Dementors are standing guard at Azkaban!\rquote 

\par \lquote The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds, Cornelius, knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort\rquote s most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them!\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote 
They will not remain loyal to you, Fudge! Voldemort can of
fer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can! With the Dementors behind him, and his old supporters returned to him, you will be hard pressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago!\rquote 
\par Fudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express his outrage.
\par \lquote The second step you must take \endash  and at once,\rquote  Dumbledore pressed on, \lquote is to send envoys to the giants.\rquote 
\par \lquote Envoys to the giants?\rquote  Fudge shrieked, finding his tongue again. \lquote What madness is this?\rquote 
\par \lquote Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote or Voldemort will persuade them, as he did before, that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom!\rquote 
\par \lquote You \endash  you cannot be serious!\rquote  Fudge gasped, shaking his head, and retreating further from Dumbledore. \lquote If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants \endash  people hate them, Dumbledore \endash 
 end of my career \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You are blinded,\rquote  said Dumbledore, his voice rising now, the aura of power around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more, \lquote 
by the love of the office you hold, Cornelius! You place too much importance, and you always have done, on the so-called purity of blood! You fail to recognise that it matters not what someone is bo
rn, but what they grow to be! Your Dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a pure-blood family as old as any \endash  and see what that man chose to make of his life! I tell you now \endash  take the steps I have sug\-
gested, and you will be remembered, in office or out, as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers for Magic we have ever known. Fail to act \endash 
 and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside, and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!\rquote 
\par \lquote Insane,\rquote  whispered Fudge, still backing away. \lquote Mad ...\rquote 
\par And then there was silence. Madam Pomfrey was standing frozen at the foot of Harry\rquote s bed, her hands over her mouth. Mrs Weasley was still standing over Harry, her hand on his shoulder to prevent him ris
ing. Bill, Ron and Hermione were staring at Fudge.
\par \lquote If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this, Cornelius,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote we have reached a part\-ing of the ways. You must act as you see fit. And I \endash  I shall act as I see fit.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore\rquote s voice carried no hint of a threat; it sounded like a mere statement, but Fudge bristled as though Dumbledore was advancing upon him with a wand.
\par \lquote Now, see here, Dumbledore,\rquote  he said, waving a threatening finger. \lquote I\rquote ve given you free rein, always. I\rquote ve had a lot of respect for you. I might not have agreed with some of your decisions, but I\rquote 
ve kept quiet. There aren\rquote t many who\rquote d have let you hire werewolves, or keep Hagrid, or decide what to teach your stu\-dents, without reference to the Ministry. But if you\rquote re going to work against me \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote The only one against whom I intend to work,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote is Lord Voldemort. If you are against him, then we remain, Cornelius, on the same side.\rquote 
\par It seemed Fudge could think of no answer to this. He rocked backwards and forwards on his small feet for a moment, and spun his bowler hat in his hands.
\par Finally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, \lquote He can\rquote t be back, Dumbledore, he just can\rquote t be ...\rquote 
\par Snape strode forwards, past Dumbledore, pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as he went. He stuck out his forearm, and showed it to Fudge, who recoiled.
\par \lquote There,\rquote  said Snape harshly. \lquote There. The Dark Mark. It is not as clear as it was, an hour or so ago, when it burnt black, but y
ou can still see it. Every Death Eater had the sign burnt into him by the Dark Lord. It was a means of distinguishing each other, and his means of summoning us to him. When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate, inst
antly, at his side. This Mark has been grow\-ing clearer all year. Karkaroff\rquote s, too. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the Mark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord\rquote 
s vengeance. He betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold.\rquote 
\par Fudge stepped back from Snape, too. He was shaking his head. He did not seem to have taken in a word Snape had said. He stared, apparently repelled, at the ugly mark on Snape\rquote s arm, then looked up at Dumbledore and whispered, \lquote I don\rquote 
t know what you and your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have heard enough. I have no more to add. I will be in touch with you tomorrow, Dumbledore, to discuss the running of this school. I must return to the Ministry.\rquote 
\par He had almost reached the door when he paused. He turned around, strode back down the dormitory, and stopped at Harry\rquote s bed.
\par \lquote Your winnings,\rquote  he said shortly, taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket, and dropping it onto Harry\rquote s bedside table. \lquote One thousand Galleons. There should have been a presenta\-tion ceremony, but in the circumstances ...
\rquote 
\par He crammed his bowler hat onto his head, and walked out of the room, slamming the door behind him. The moment he had disappeared, Dumbledore turned to look at the group around Harry\rquote s bed.
\par \lquote There is work to be done,\rquote  he said. \lquote Molly ... am I right in thinking that I can count on you and Arthur?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course you can,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. She was white to the lips, but she looked resolute. \lquote He knows what Fudge is. It\rquote s Arthur\rquote 
s fondness for Muggles that has held him back at the Ministry all these years. Fudge thinks he lacks proper wizard\-ing pride.\rquote 
\par \lquote Then I need to send a message to him,\rquote  said Dumbledore. All those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately, and Arthur is well placed to contact those at the Ministry who are not as short-sighted as Cornelius.\rquote 

\par \lquote I\rquote ll go to Dad,\rquote  said Bill, standing up. \lquote I\rquote ll go now.\rquote 
\par \lquote Excellent,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Tell him what has happened. Tell him I will be in direct contact with him shortly. He will need to be discreet, however. If Fudge thinks I am interfering at the Ministry \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Leave it to me,\rquote  said Bill.
\par He clapped a hand on Harry\rquote s shoulder, kissed his mother on the cheek, pulled on his cloak, and strode quickly from the room.
\par \lquote Minerva,\rquote  said Dumbledore, turning to Professor McGonagall, \lquote I want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible. Also \endash  if she will consent to come \endash  Madame Maxime.\rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall nodded, and left without a word.
\par \lquote Poppy,\rquote  Dumbledore said to Madam Pomfrey, \lquote would you be very kind, and go down to Professor Moody\rquote 
s office, where I think you will find a house-elf called Winky in considerable distress? Do what you can for her, and take her back to the kitchens. I think Dobby will look after her for us.\rquote 
\par \lquote Very \endash  very well,\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey, looking startled, and she too left.
\par Dumbledore made sure that the door was closed, and that Madam Pomfrey\rquote s footsteps had died away, before he spoke again.
\par \lquote And now,\rquote  he said, \lquote it is time for two of our number to recognise each other for what they are. Sirius ... if you could resume your usual form.\rquote 
\par The great black dog looked up at Dumbledore, then, in an instant, turned back into a man.
\par Mrs Weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed.
\par \lquote Sirius Black!\rquote  she shrieked, pointing at him.
\par \lquote Mum, shut up!\rquote  Ron yelled. \lquote It\rquote s OK!\rquote 
\par Snape had not yelled or jumped backwards, but the look on his face was one of mingled fury and horror.
\par \lquote Him!\rquote  he snarled, staring at Sirius, whose face showed equal dislike. \lquote What is he doing here?\rquote 
\par \lquote He is here at my invitation,\rquote  said Dumbledore, looking between them, \lquote as are you, Severus. I trust you both. It is time for you to lay aside your old differences, and trust each other.\rquote 
\par Harry thought Dumbledore was asking for a near miracle. Sirius and Snape were eyeing each other with the utmost loathing.
\par \lquote I will settle, in the short term,\rquote  said Dumbledore, with a bite of impatience in his voice, \lquote for a lack of open 
hostility. You will shake hands. You are on the same side now. Time is short, and unless the few of us who know the truth stand united, there is no hope for any of us.\rquote 
\par Very slowly \endash  but still glaring at each other as though each wished the other nothing but ill \endash  Sirius and Snape moved towards each other, and shook hands. They let go extremely quickly.
\par \lquote That will do to be going on with,\rquote  said Dumbledore, step\-ping between them once more. \lquote Now I have work for each of you. Fudge\rquote s attitude, though not unexpe
cted, changes everything. Sirius, I need you to set off at once. You are to alert Remus Lupin, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher \endash  the old crowd. Lie low at Lupin\rquote s for a while, I will contact you there.\rquote 
\par \lquote But \endash \rquote  said Harry.
\par He wanted Sirius to stay. He did not want to say goodbye again so quickly.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll see me very soon, Harry,\rquote  said Sirius, turning to him. \lquote I promise you. But I must do what I can, you understand, don\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Yeah ... of course I do.\rquote 
\par Sirius grasped his hand briefly, nodded to Dumbledore, trans\-formed again into the black dog, and ran the length of the room to the door, whose handle he turned with a paw. Then he was gone.
\par \lquote Severus,\rquote  said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, \lquote you know what I must ask you to do. If you are ready ... if you are pre\-pared ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I am,\rquote  said Snape.
\par He looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold, black eyes glittered strangely.
\par \lquote Then, good luck,\rquote  said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a trace of apprehension on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after Sirius.
\par It was several minutes before Dumbledore spoke again.
\par \lquote I must go downstairs,\rquote  he said finally. \lquote I must see the Diggorys. Harry \endash  take the rest of your potion. I will see all of you later.\rquote 
\par Harry slumped back against his pillows as Dumbledore dis\-appeared. Hermione, Ron and Mrs Weasley were all looking at him. None of them spoke for a very long time.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve got to take the rest of your potion, Harry,\rquote  Mrs Weasley said at last. Her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle and the goblet. \lquote 
You have a good long sleep. Try and think about something else for a while ... think about what you\rquote re going to buy with your winnings!\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t want that gold,\rquote  said Harry in an expressionless voice. \lquote You have it. Anyone can have it. I shouldn\rquote t have won it. It should\rquote ve been Cedric\rquote s.\rquote 
\par The thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to overpower him. He could feel a burning, prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes. He blinked and stared up at the ceiling.
\par \lquote It wasn\rquote t your fault, Harry,\rquote  Mrs Weasley whispered.
\par \lquote I told him to take the Cup with me,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Now the burning feeling was in his throat, too. He wished Ron would look away.
\par Mrs Weasley 
set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother. The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs Weasley he
ld him to her. His mother\rquote s face, his father\rquote 
s voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground, all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him.
\par There was a loud slamming noise, and Mrs Weasley and Harry broke apart. Hermione was standing by the window. She was holding something tight in her hand.
\par \lquote Sorry,\rquote  she whispered.
\par \lquote Your potion, Harry,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley quickly, wiping her eyes on the back of her hand.
\par Harry drank it in one. The effect was instantaneous. Heavy, irresistible waves of dreamless sleep broke over him, he fell back onto his pillows, and thought no more.

When he looked back, even a month later, Harry found he had few memories of the following days. It was as though he had been through too much to take in any more. The recollections he did have were very painful. The worst, perhaps, was the meeting with th
e Diggorys that took place the following morning.

Harry returned to Gryffindor Tower the following evening. From what Hermione and Ron told him, Dumbledore had spo\-ken to the school that morning at breakfast. He had merely requested that they leave Harry alone, that nobody ask him quest
ions or badger him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze. Most people, he noticed, were skirting him in the corridors, avoiding his eyes. Some whispered behind their hands as he passed. He guessed that many of them had believed Rita Skeeter
\rquote s article about how disturbed and possi\-bly dangerous he was. Perhaps they were formulating their own theories about how Cedric had died. He found he didn\rquote 
t care very much. He liked it best when he was with Ron and Hermione, and they were talking about other things, or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess. He felt as though all three of them had reached an understanding they didn\rquote 
t need to put into words; that each was waiting for some sign, some word, of what was going on outside Hogwarts \endash 
 and that it was useless to speculate about what might be coming until they knew anything for certain. The only time they touched upon the subject was when Ron told Harry about a meeting Mrs Weasley had had with Dumbledore before going home.

When he, Ron and Hermione entered the Hall, they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing. The Great Hall was normally decorated with the winning house\rquote 
s colours for the Leaving Feast. Tonight, however, there were black drapes on the wall behind the teachers\rquote  table. Harry knew instantly that they were there as a mark of respect for Cedric.
\par The real Mad-Eye Moody was at the staff table, his wooden leg and his magical eye back in place. He was extremely twitchy, jumping every time someone spoke to him. Harry couldn\rquote t blame him; Moody\rquote 
s fear of attack was bound to have been increased by his ten-month imprisonment in his own trunk. Professor Karkaroff\rquote 
s chair was empty. Harry wondered, as he sat down with the other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff was now; whether Voldemort had caught up with him.
\par Madame Maxime was still there. She was sitting next to Hagrid. They
 were talking quietly together. Further along the table, sitting next to Professor McGonagall, was Snape. His eyes lingered on Harry for a moment as Harry looked at him. His expression was difficult to read. He looked as sour and unpleasant as ever. Harry
 continued to watch him, long after Snape had looked away.
\par What was it that Snape had done on Dumbledore\rquote s orders, the night that Voldemort had returned? And why ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 why ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f39\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid15346133 was Dumbledore so convinced that Snape was truly on their side? He had been their spy, Dumbledore had said so in the Pensieve. Snape had turned spy against Voldemort, \lquote at great personal risk
\rquote . Was that the job he had taken up again? Had he made contact with the Death Eaters, perhaps? Pretended that he had never really gone over to Dumbledore, that he had been, like Voldemort himself, biding his time?
\par Harry\rquote s musings were ended by Professor Dumbledore, who stood up at the staff table. The Great Hall, which in any case had been less noisy than it usually was at the Leaving Feast, became very quiet.
\par \lquote The end,\rquote  said Dumbledore, looking around at them all, \lquote of another year.\rquote 
\par He paused, and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff table. Theirs had been the most subdued table before he had got to his feet, and theirs were still the saddest and palest faces in the Hall.
\par \lquote There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who should be sitting here\rquote  \endash  he gestured towards the Hufflepuffs \endash  
\lquote enjoying our Feast with us. I would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory.\rquote 
\par They did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the Hall stood, and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, \lquote Cedric Diggory.\rquote 
\par Harry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd. There were tears pouring silently down her face. He looked down at the table as they all sat down again.
\par \lquote Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities which distinguish Hufflepuff house,\rquote  Dumbledore continued. \lquote 
He was a good and loyal friend, a hard worker, he valued fair play. His death has affected you all, whether you knew him well or not. I think that you have the right, therefore, to know exactly how it came about.\rquote 
\par Harry raised his head, and stared at Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort.\rquote 
\par A panicked whisper swept the Great Hall. People were staring at Dumbledore in disbelief, in horror. He looked perfectly calm as he watched them mutter themselves into silence.
\par \lquote The Ministry of Magic,\rquote  Dumbledore continued, \lquote does not wish me to tell you this. It is possible that some of your par\-ents will be horrified that I have done so \endash 
 either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returne
d, or because they think I should not tell you so, young as you are. It is my belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident, or some sort of blunder of his ow
n, is an insult to his memory.\rquote 
\par Stunned and frightened, every face in the Hall was turned towards Dumbledore now ... or almost every face. Over at the Slytherin table, Harry saw Draco Malfoy muttering something to Crabbe and Goyle. Harry felt a hot, sick sw
oop of anger in his stomach. He forced himself to look back at Dumbledore.
\par \lquote There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connec\-tion with Cedric\rquote s death,\rquote  Dumbledore went on. \lquote I am talking, of course, about Harry Potter.\rquote 
\par A kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall, as a few heads turned in Harry\rquote s direction before flicking back to face Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote He risked his own life to return Cedric\rquote s body to Hogwarts. He showed, in every respect, the so
rt of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort, and for this, I honour him.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore turned gravely to Harry, and raised his goblet once more. Nearly everyone in the Great Hall followed suit. They murmured his name, as they had murmured Cedric\rquote 
s, and drank to him. But, through a gap in the standing figures, Harry saw that Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle and many of the other Slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched. Dumbledore, who after all possessed no ma
gical eye, did not see them.
\par When everyone had once again resumed their seats, Dumbledore continued, \lquote The Triwizard Tournament\rquote s aim was to further and promote magical understanding. In the light of what has happened \endash  of Lord Voldemort\rquote s return \endash 
 such ties are more important than ever before.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore looked from Madame Maxime and Hagrid, to Fleur Delacour and her fellow Beauxbatons students, to Viktor Krum and the Durmstrangs at the Slytherin table. Krum, Harry saw, looked wary, almost frightened, as t
hough he expected Dumbledore to say something harsh.
\par \lquote Every guest in this Hall,\rquote  said Dumbledore, and his eyes lin\-gered upon the Durmstrang students, \lquote will be welcomed back here, at any time, should they wish to come. I say to you all, once again \endash  in the
 light of Lord Voldemort\rquote s return, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.
\par \lquote Lord Voldemort\rquote s gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. Dif
ferences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.
\par \lquote It is my belief \endash  and never have I so hoped that I am mistak\-en \endash  that we are all facing dark and difficult times. Some of you, in this Hall, have already
 suffered directly at the hands of Lord Voldemort. Many of your families have been torn asun\-der. A week ago, a student was taken from our midst.
\par \lquote Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right, and 
what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.\rquote

\par He looked around. Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Beyond her, far across the grounds, Harry could see Hagrid helping Madame Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness. The Beauxbatons car\-

\par \lquote We will see each uzzer again, I \rquote ope,\rquote  said Fleur, as she reached him, holding out her hand. \lquote I am \rquote oping to get a job \rquote ere, to improve my Eenglish.\rquote

\par Harry\rquote s spirits couldn\rquote t help but lift slightly, as he watched Fleur hurry back across the lawns to Madame Maxime, her sil\-very hair rippling in the sunlight.

\par \lquote Karkaroff did not steer,\rquote  said a gruff voice. \lquote He stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork.\rquote  Krum had come to say goodbye to Hermione. \lquote Could I have a vord?\rquote  he asked her.
\par \lquote Oh ... yes ... all right,\rquote  said Hermione, looking slightly flus\-tered, and following Krum through the crowd and out of sight.
\par \lquote You\rquote d better hurry up!\rquote  Ron called loudly after her. \lquote The car-riages\rquote ll be here in a minute!\rquote 
\par He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and Hermione might be up to. They returned quite soon. Ron stared at Hermione, but her face was impassive.
\par \lquote I liked Diggory,\rquote  said Krum abruptly, to Harry. \lquote He vos alvays polite to me. Alvays. Even though I vos from Durmstrang \endash  with Karkaroff,\rquote  he added, scowling.
\par \lquote Have you got a new Headmaster yet?\rquote  said Harry.
\par Krum shrugged. He held out his hand as Fleur had done, shook Harry\rquote s hand and then Ron\rquote s.
\par Ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of painful internal struggle. Krum had already started walking away when Ron burst out, \lquote Can I have your autograph?\rquote 
\par Hermione turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages which were now trundling towards them up the drive, as Krum, looking surprised, but gratified, signed a fragment of parchment for Ron.

\par \lquote I\rquote ve told her I\rquote ll let her out when we get back to London,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote I\rquote ve put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar, you see, so she can\rquote t transform. And I\rquote ve told her she\rquote

\par Smiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag.
\par The door of the compartment slid open.
\par \lquote Very clever, Granger,\rquote  said Draco Malfoy.
\par Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him. All three of them looked more pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more menacing, than Harry had ever seen them.
\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compart\-ment, and looking around at them, a smirk quivering on his lips. \lquote You caught some pathetic reporter, and Potter\rquote s Dumbledore\rquote s favourite boy again. Big deal.
\rquote 
\par His smirk widened. Crabbe and Goyle leered.
\par \lquote Trying not to think about it, are we?\rquote  said Malfoy softly, looking around at all three of them. \lquote Trying to pretend it hasn\rquote t happened?\rquote 
\par \lquote Get out,\rquote  said Harry.
\par He had not been near Malfoy since he had watched him muttering to Crabbe and Goyle during Dumbledore\rquote s speech about Cedric. He could feel a kind of ringing in his ears. His hand gripped his wand under his robes.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember? When we met on the train, first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with riff-raff like this!\rquote

\par It was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the compartment. Blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every direction, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry blinked, and looked down at the floor.
\par Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway. He, Ron and Hermione were on their feet, all three of them having used a different hex. Nor were they the only ones to have done so.
\par \lquote Thought we\rquote d see what those three were up to,\rquote  said Fred matter-of-factly, stepping onto Goyle, and into the compart\-ment. He had his wand out, and so did George, who was care\-ful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside.

\par \lquote Interesting effect,\rquote  said George, looking down at Crabbe. \lquote Who used the Furnunculus curse?\rquote 
\par \lquote Me,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Odd,\rquote  said George lightly. \lquote I used Jelly-Legs. Looks as though those two shouldn\rquote t be mixed. He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face. Well, let\rquote s not leave them here, they don\rquote

\par But Harry, Ron and Hermione kept on asking, and finally Fred said, \lquote All right, all right, if you really want to know ... it was Ludo Bagman.\rquote 
\par \lquote Bagman?\rquote  said Harry sharply. \lquote Are you saying he was involved in \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Nah,\rquote  said George gloomily. \lquote Nothing like that. Stupid git. He wouldn\rquote t have the brains.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, what, then?\rquote  said Ron.
\par Fred hesitated, then said, \lquote You remember that bet we had with him, at the Quidditch World Cup? About how Ireland would win, but Krum would get the Snitch?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry and Ron slowly.
\par \lquote Well, the git paid us in leprechaun gold he\rquote d caught from the Irish mascots.\rquote 
\par \lquote So?\rquote 
\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Fred impatiently, \lquote it vanished, didn\rquote t it? By next morning, it had gone!\rquote 
\par \lquote But \endash  it must\rquote ve been an accident, mustn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par George laughed very bitterly. \lquote Yeah, that\rquote s what we thought, at first. We thought if we just wrote to him, and told him he\rquote d made a mistake, he\rquote 
d cough up. But nothing doing. Ignored our letter. We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts, but he was always making some excuse to get away from us.\rquote 
\par \lquote In the end, he turned pretty nasty,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote Told us we were too young to gamble, and he wasn\rquote t giving us anything.\rquote 
\par \lquote So we asked for our money back,\rquote  said George, glowering.
\par \lquote He didn\rquote t refuse!\rquote  gasped Hermione.
\par \lquote Right in one,\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote But that was all your savings!\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Tell me about it,\rquote  said George. \lquote  \rquote Course, we found out what was going on in the end. Lee Jordan\rquote s dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as well. Turns out he\rquote 
s in big trouble with the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had, and it still wasn\rquote 
t enough to cover all his debts. They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He\rquote s lost everything gambling. Hasn\rquote t got two Galleons to rub together. And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back?\rquote 

\par \lquote How?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote He put a bet on you, mate,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote Put a big bet on you to win the Tournament. Bet against the goblins.\rquote

\lquote Well \endash  I did win, didn\rquote t I? So he can pay you your gold!\rquote 
\par \lquote Nope,\rquote  said George, shaking his head. \lquote The goblins play as dirty as him. They say you drew with Diggory, and Bagman was betting you\rquote d win outright. So Bagman had to run for it. He made a run for it right after the third task.
\rquote 
\par George sighed deeply, and started dealing out the cards again.
\par The rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry wished it could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at King\rquote s Cross ... but as he had learnt the hard way that
 year, time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead, and all too soon the Hogwarts Express was slowing down at platform nine and three-quarters. The usual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark. Ron and
 Hermione struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle, carrying their trunks.
\par Harry, however, stayed put. \lquote Fred \endash  George \endash  wait a moment.\rquote 
\par The twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk, and drew out his Triwizard winnings.
\par \lquote Take it,\rquote  he said, and he thrust the sack into George\rquote s hands.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Fred, looking flabbergasted.
\par \lquote Take it,\rquote  Harry repeated firmly. \lquote I don\rquote t want it.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re mental,\rquote  said George, trying to push it back at Harry.
\par \lquote No, I\rquote m not,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote You take it, and get inventing. It\rquote s for the joke-shop.\rquote

\par \lquote Listen,\rquote  said Harry firmly. \lquote If you don\rquote t take it, I\rquote m throwing it down the drain. I don\rquote t want it and I don\rquote t need it. But I could do with a few laughs. We could all do with a few laughs. I\rquote

\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  said George weakly, weighing the money bag in his hands, \lquote there\rquote s got to be a thousand Galleons in here.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, grinning. \lquote Think how many Canary Creams that is.\rquote 
\par The twins stared at him.
\par \lquote Just don\rquote t tell your mum where you got it ... although she might not be so keen for you to join the Ministry any more, come to think of it ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  Fred began, but Harry pulled out his wand.
\par \lquote Look,\rquote  he said flatly, \lquote take it, or I\rquote ll hex you. I know some good ones now. Just do me one favour, OK? Buy Ron some dif\-ferent dress robes, and say they\rquote re from you.\rquote 
\par He left the compartment before they could say another word, stepping over Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex marks.
\par Uncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier. Mrs Weasley was close by him. She hugged Harry very tightly when she saw him, and whispered in his ear, \lquote I think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer. Keep in touch, Harry.\rquote 

\par \lquote See you, Harry,\rquote  said Ron, clapping him on the back.
\par \lquote Bye, Harry!\rquote  said Hermione, and she did something she had never done before, and kissed him on the cheek.
\par \lquote Harry \endash  thanks,\rquote  George muttered, while Fred nodded fervently at his side.
\par Harry winked at them, turned to Uncle Vernon, and followed him silently from the station. There was no point worrying yet, he told himself, as he got into the back of the Dursleys\rquote  car.
\par As Hagrid had said, what would come, would come ... and he would have to meet it when it did.
