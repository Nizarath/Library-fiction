The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emeral
d green lay parched and yellowing \endash  for the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhab\-
itants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a non\-
existent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flowerbed outside number four.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slightly unhealthy 
look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers. Harry Potter\rquote 
s appearance did not endear him to the neighbours, who were the sort of people who thought scruffi\-ness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had hidden him\-
self behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passers-by. In fact, the only way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon 
or Aunt Petunia stuck their heads out of the living-room window and looked straight down into the flowerbed below.
\par On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, ha
rd earth but, on the other hand, nobody was glaring at him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room to watch television wit
h his aunt and uncle.
\par Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry\rquote s uncle, suddenly spoke.
\par \lquote Glad to see the boy\rquote s stopped trying to butt in. Where is he, anyway?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Aunt Petunia, unconcerned. \lquote Not in the house.\rquote 
\par Uncle Vernon grunted.

\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh \endash  yes \endash  sorry, dear.\rquote 
\par The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit \rquote n\rquote 
 Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs Figg, a batty cat-loving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was frowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased he was concealed behind the bush, as Mrs Figg had recently taken 
to asking him round for tea whenever she met him in the street. She had rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon\rquote s voice floated out of the window again.
\par \lquote Dudders out for tea?\rquote 
\par \lquote At the Polkisses\rquote ,\rquote  said Aunt Petunia fondly. \lquote He\rquote s got so many little friends, he\rquote s so popular ...\rquote 
\par Harry suppressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley. They had swal\-lowed all his dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang eve
ry night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening vandalising the play park, smoking on street corners and throwing stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen 
them at it during his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers from bins along the way.
\par The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o\rquote clock news reached Harry\rquote s ears and his stomach turned over. Perhaps tonight \endash  after a month of waiting \endash  would be the night.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Record numbers of stranded holiday makers fill airports as the Spanish baggage-handlers\rquote  strike reaches its second week \endash \rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par \lquote Give \rquote em a lifelong siesta, I would,\rquote  snarled Uncle Vernon over the end of the newsreader\rquote s sentence, but no matter: outside in the flowerbed, Harry\rquote s stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had hap\-
pened, it would surely have been the first item on the news; death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers.
\par He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky. Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again ... and always, growing m
ore insistent all the time, the question of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 why }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 nothing had happened yet.
\par He kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not recognised for what it really was by the Muggles \endash  an unexplained disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident ... but the baggage-handlers\rquote 
 strike was followed by news about the drought in the Southeast (\lquote I hope he\rquote s listening next door!\rquote  bellowed Uncle Vernon. \lquote Him with his sprinklers on at three in the morning!\rquote 
), then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress\rquote s divorce from her famous husband (\lquote As if we\rquote re interested in their sordid affairs,\rquote 
 sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on).
\par Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote \endash

\par Harry opened his eyes. If they had reached water-skiing budgeri\-gars, there would be nothing else worth hearing. He rolled cau\-tiously on to his front and raised himself on to his knees and elbows, preparing to crawl out from under the window.
\par He had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession.
\par A loud, echoing }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 crack }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys\rquote 
 living room, and as though this was the signal Harry had been waiting for he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword \endash  but before he could 
draw himself up to full height, the top of his head collided with the Dursleys\rquote  open window. The resultant }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 crash }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 made Aunt Petunia scream even louder.
\par Harry felt as though his head had been split in two. Eyes streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the st
reet to spot the source of the noise, but he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat.

arly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an electric shock. Some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew, making him impossible to hold.
\par Panting, Harry fell forwards over the hydrangea bush, straight\-
ened up and stared around. There was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent.
\par \lquote Lovely evening!\rquote  shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs Number Seven opposite, who was glaring from behind her net curtains. \lquote Did you hear that car backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!\rquote 
\par He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious neighbours had disappeared from their various windows, then the grin became a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back towards him.

 Harry, his temper rising, and before the Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall and was striding off up the street.
\par He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he did not care very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing matters on his mind.
\par Harry was sure the cracking noise had been made by someone Apparating or Disapparating. It was exactly the 
sound Dobby the house-elf made when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following him right at this very moment? As this thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back down Privet Drive, but i
t appeared to be completely deserted and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to become invisible.
\par He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was taking, for he had pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his favourite haunt
s automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over his shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt Petunia\rquote s dying begonias, he was sure of it. Why hadn\rquote t they spoken to him, why hadn\rquote 
t they made contact, why were they hiding now?
\par And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his certainty leaked away.
\par Perhaps it hadn\rquote t been a magical sound after all. Perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises. Could he be }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 sure }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 it hadn\rquote t been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbour\rquote s house?
\par Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach and before he knew it the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again.
\par Tomorrow morning he would be woken by the alarm at five o\rquote clock so he could pay the owl that delivered the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 but was there any point continuing to take it? Harry merely glanced at the front page before throwing it asid
e these days; when the idiots who ran the paper finally realised that Voldemort was back it would be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry cared about.
\par If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his best friends Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he\rquote d had that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 We can\rquote t say much about you-know-what, obviously ... We\rquote ve been told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray ... We\rquote

\par But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed too bothered with a precise date. Hermione had scribbled }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 I expect we\rquote ll be seeing you quite soon }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their let\-
ters, Hermione and Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron\rquote s parents\rquote  house. He could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having
 fun at The Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he was so angry with them he had thrown away, unopened, the two boxes of Honeydukes chocolates they\rquote d sent him for his birthday. He\rquote 
d regretted it later, after the wilted salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night.
\par And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasn\rquote t he, Harry, busy? Hadn\rquote t he proved himself capable of handling much more than them? Had they all forgotten what he had done? Hadn\rquote t it been }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being murdered, and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed?
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Don\rquote t think about that, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth time that summer. It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking moments too.
\par He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to under\-
stand how Harry was feeling. Admittedly, his letters were just as empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione\rquote s, but at least they con\-tained words of caution and consolation instead of tantalising hints: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 I know this must be frustrating for you ... Keep your nose clean and everything will be OK ... Be careful and don\rquote t do anything rash ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road and headed towards the darkening play park, he had (by and large) done as Siriu
s advised. He had at least resisted the temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for The Burrow by himself. In fact, Harry thought his behaviour had been very good considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet Driv
e
 so long, reduced to hiding in flowerbeds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing. Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, 
escaped, attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone on the run with a stolen Hippogriff.
\par Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the parched grass. The park was as empty as the surrounding stree
ts. When he reached the swings he sank on to the only one that Dudley and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around the chain and stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to hide in the Dursleys\rquote 
 flowerbed again. Tomorrow, he would have to think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the mean\-time, he had nothing to look forward to but another restless, dis\-
turbed night, because even when he escaped the nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling dreams about long dark 
corridors, all finishing in dead ends and locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when he was awake. Often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that Ron or Hermione or
 
Sirius would find that very interesting any more. In the past, his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was getting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be expected ... no
thing to worry about ... old news ...
\par The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell with fury. If it hadn\rquote t been for him, nobody would even have known Voldemort was back! And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four so
lid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so that he could hear about water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting
 him along, too? How much longer was he supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the stupid }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and point out that Voldemort had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around in Harry\rquote 
s head, and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell around him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass, and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park railings.
\par He did not know how long h
e had sat on the swing before the sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up. The streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the park. One of them wa
s singing a loud, crude song. The others were laughing. A soft ticking noise came from several expen\-sive racing bikes that they were wheeling along.
\par Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front was unmistakeably his cousin, Dudley Dursley, wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful gang.
\par Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year\rquote s hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique. As Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had recent
ly become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Champion of the Southeast. \lquote The noble sport\rquote 
, as Uncle Vernon called it, had made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry in their primary school days when he had served as Dudley\rquote s first punchball. Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin any more but he still didn
\rquote t think that Dudley learning to punch harder and more accurately was cause for cele\-bration. Neighbourhood children all around were terrified of him \endash  even more terrified than they were of \lquote that Potter boy\rquote 
 who, they had been warned, was a hardened hooligan and attended St Brutus\rquote s Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys.
\par Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered who they had been beating up tonight. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Look round, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Harry found himself thinking as he watched them. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Come on ... look round ... I\rquote

\par If Dudley\rquote s friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then? He wouldn\rquote t want to lose face in front of the gang, but he\rquote d be terri\-
fied of provoking Harry ... it would be really fun to watch Dudley\rquote s dilemma, to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond ... and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, he was ready \endash  he had his wand. Let them try ... he
\rquote d love to vent some of his frus\-tration on the boys who had once made his life hell.
\par But they didn\rquote t turn around, they didn\rquote t see him, they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after them ... seeking a fight was not a smart move ... he must not use magic ... he would be risking expulsion again.

\par The voices of Dudley\rquote s gang died away; they were out of sight, heading along Magnolia Road.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 There you go, Sirius, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Harry thought dully. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Nothing rash. Kept my nose dean. Exactly the opposite of what you\rquote d have done.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to be home, and any time after that was much too
 late. Uncle Vernon had threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home after Dudley ever again, so, stifling a yawn, and still scowling, Harry set off towards the park gate.
\par Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses with perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon\rquote s. Harry pre\-
ferred Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches of jewel-bright colour in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about his \lquote delinquent\rquote 
 appearance when he passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that halfway along Magnolia Road Dudley\rquote s gang came into view again; they were saying their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent
. Harry stepped into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited.
\par \lquote ... squealed like a pig, didn\rquote t he?\rquote  Malcolm was saying, to guf\-faws from the others.
\par \lquote Nice right hook, Big D,\rquote  said Piers.
\par \lquote Same time tomorrow?\rquote  said Dudley.
\par \lquote Round at my place, my parents will be out,\rquote  said Gordon.
\par \lquote See you then,\rquote  said Dudley.
\par \lquote Bye, Dud!\rquote 
\par \lquote See ya, Big D!\rquote 
\par Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off again. When their voices had faded once more he headed around the corner into Magnolia Crescent and by
 walking very quickly he soon came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his ease, humming tunelessly.
\par \lquote Hey, Big D!\rquote 
\par Dudley turned.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  he grunted. \lquote It\rquote s you.\rquote 
\par \lquote How long have you been \'93Big D\'94 then?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Shut it,\rquote  snarled Dudley, turning away.
\par \lquote Cool name,\rquote  said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his cousin. \lquote But you\rquote ll always be \'93Ickle Diddykins\'94 to me.\rquote 
\par \lquote I said, SHUT IT!\rquote  said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled into fists.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t the boys know that\rquote s what your mum calls you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Shut your face.\rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t tell }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 her}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148  to shut her face. What about \'93Popkin\'94 and 
\'93Dinky Diddydums\'94, can I use them then?\rquote 
\par Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting Harry seemed to demand all his self-control.
\par \lquote So who\rquote ve you been beating up tonight?\rquote  Harry asked, his grin fading. \lquote Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He was asking for it,\rquote  snarled Dudley.
\par \lquote Oh yeah?\rquote 
\par \lquote He cheeked me.\rquote

\par A muscle was twitching in Dudley\rquote s jaw. It gave Harry enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet he had.
\par They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a short cut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their foot\-
steps were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on the other.

\par He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley was curled up on the ground, his arms clamped over hi

s when the silver antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness; the stag cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.
\par Moon, stars and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighbouring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars 
in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again. Harry stood quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to normality. After a moment, he became aware that his T-shirt was sticking to him; he was drenched in sweat.

\par Mrs Figg, their batty old neighbour, came panting into sight. Her grizzled grey hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string shopping bag was swinging from her wrist and her feet were ha

\par But Mrs Figg had already set off at a trot, carpet slippers flop\-ping, string bag clanking.
\par \lquote Wait!\rquote  Harry shouted after her. He had a million questions to ask anyone who was in contact with Dumbledore; but within sec\-on
ds Mrs Figg was swallowed by the darkness. Scowling, Harry readjusted Dudley on his shoulder and made his slow, painful way up number four\rquote s garden path.
\par The hall light was on. Harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans, rang the bell and watched Aunt Petunia\rquote s outline grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door.

\par \lquote DIDDY! Diddy, what\rquote s the matter with you? Vernon? VERNON!\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s uncle came galumphing out of the living room, wa

\par \lquote Who did it, son? Give us names. We\rquote ll get them, don\rquote t worry.\rquote

\par \lquote BOY! COME HERE!\rquote 
\par With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to follow the Dursleys.
\par The scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the darkness outside. Aunt Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair;
 he was still very green and clammy-looking. Uncle Vernon was standing in front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through tiny, narrowed eyes.
\par \lquote What have you done to my son?\rquote  he said in a menacing growl.
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  said Harry, knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon wouldn\rquote t believe him.
\par \lquote What did he do to you, Diddy?\rquote  Aunt Petunia said in a quaver\-ing voice, now sponging sick from the front of Dudley\rquote s leather jacket. \lquote Was it \endash  was it you-know-what, darling? Did he use \endash  his }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par \lquote I didn\rquote t!\rquote  Harry said sharply, as Aunt Petunia let out a wail and Uncle Vernon raised his fists. \lquote I didn\rquote t do anything to him, it wasn\rquote t me, it was \endash \rquote 
\par But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window. Narrowly missing the top of Uncle Vernon\rquote s head, it soared across the kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at Harry\rquote 
s feet, turned grace\-fully, the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside again and off across the garden.
\par \lquote OWLS!\rquote  bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut. \lquote OWLS AGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE OWLS IN MY HOUSE!\rquote 
\par But Harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside, his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his Adam\rquote s apple.

\par \lquote Go on, son,\rquote  said Uncle Vernon, \lquote what did he do?\rquote

\par Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia exchanged looks of utter horror. If their least favourite thing in the world was magic \endash  closely followed by neighbours who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban \endash 
 people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten. They obviously thought Dudley was losing his mind.
\par \lquote What sort of things did you hear, Popkin?\rquote  breathed Aunt Petunia, very white-faced and with tears in her eyes.
\par But Dudley seemed incapable of saying. He shuddered again and shook his large blond head, and de
spite the sense of numb dread that had settled on Harry since the arrival of the first owl, he felt a certain curiosity. Dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of their life. What would spoiled, pampered, bullying Dudley have been forced to
 hear?
\par \lquote How come you fell over, son?\rquote  said Uncle Vernon, in an un\-naturally quiet voice, the kind of voice he might adopt at the bedside of a very ill person.
\par \lquote T-tripped,\rquote  said Dudley shakily. \lquote And then \endash \rquote 
\par He gestured at his massive chest. Harry understood. Dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you.
\par \lquote Horrible,\rquote  croaked Dudley. \lquote Cold. Really cold.\rquote 
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Uncle Vernon, in a voice of forced calm, while Aunt Petunia laid an anxious hand on Dudley\rquote s forehead to feel his tem\-perature. \lquote What happened then, Dudders?\rquote 
\par \lquote Felt ... felt ... felt ... as if ... as if ...\rquote 
\par \lquote As if you\rquote d never be happy again,\rquote  Harry supplied tonelessly.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  Dudley whispered, still trembling.
\par \lquote So!\rquote  said Uncle Vernon, voice restored to full and considerable volume as he straightened up. \lquote You put some crackpot spell on my son so he\rquote d hear voices and believe he was \endash  was doomed to misery, or something, did you?
\rquote 
\par \lquote How many times do I have to tell you?\rquote  said Harry, temper and voice both rising. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote It wasn\rquote t me! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban,\rquote  said Aunt Petunia.
\par Two seconds of ringing silence followed these words before Aunt Petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word. Uncle Vernon was goggling at her. Harry\rquote s brain reeled. Mrs Figg was one thing \endash  but

\par \lquote How d\rquote you know that?\rquote  he asked her, astonished.
\par Aunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself. She glanced at Uncle Vernon in fearful apology, then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsy teeth.
\par \lquote I heard \endash  that awful boy \endash  telling }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 her }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 about them \endash 
 years ago,\rquote  she said jerkily.
\par \lquote If you mean my mum and dad, why don\rquote t you use their names?\rquote  said Harry loudly, but Aunt Petunia ignored him. She seemed hor\-ribly flustered.
\par Harry was stunned. Except for one outburst years ago, in the course of which Aunt Petunia had screamed that Harry\rquote 
s mother had been a freak, he had never heard her mention her sister. He was astounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the magical world for so long, when she usually put all her energies into pretending it didn\rquote t exist.

\par Uncle Vernon opened his mouth, closed it again, opened it once more, shut it, then, apparently struggling to remember how to talk, opened it for a third time and croaked, \lquote So \endash  so \endash  they \endash  er \endash  they \endash  er \endash 
 they actually exist, do they \endash  er \endash  Dementy-whatsits?\rquote 
\par Aunt Petunia nodded.
\par Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout \lquote April Fool!\rquote  When nobody did, he opened his mouth yet again, but was spared the struggle to 
find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening. It zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannon-ball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the Dursleys to jump with fright. Harry tore a second 
official-looking envelope from the owl\rquote s beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped back out into the night.

Harry read this letter through three times in quick succession. The miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly with the relief of 
knowing he was not yet definitely expelled, though his fears were by no means banished. Everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of August.

\par \lquote Because I used the Patronus \endash \rquote 
\par WHOOSH. With a clattering, a whirring of wings and a soft fall of dust, a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace.
\par \lquote FOR GOD\rquote S SAKE!\rquote  roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps of hair out of his moustache, something he hadn\rquote t been driven to do in a long time. \lquote I WILL NOT HAVE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS, I TELL YOU!\rquote 

\par But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the owl\rquote s leg. He was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore, explaining everything \endash  the 
Dementors, Mrs Figg, what the Ministry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything out \endash  that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sirius\rquote s handwriting. Ignoring Uncle Vernon\rquote

\par Harry took a deep, steadying breath. His head was beginning to ache again. He wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen, and away from the Dursleys.
\par \lquote I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the Dementors,\rquote  he said, forcing himself to remain calm. \lquote It\rquote s the only thing that works against them.\rquote

\par \lquote Couldn\rquote t tell you,\rquote  said Harry wearily. \lquote No idea.\rquote

\par \lquote It\rquote s you,\rquote  said Uncle Vernon forcefully. \lquote It\rquote s got something to do with you, boy, I know it. Why else would they turn up here? Why else would they be down that alleyway? You\rquote ve got to be the only \endash

\par \lquote Of course I\rquote m not,\rquote  said Harry, shaking his head as though to scare off a fly, his mind racing now.
\par \lquote Then why \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote He must have sent them,\rquote  said Harry quietly, more to himself than to Uncle Vernon.
\par \lquote What\rquote s that? Who must have sent them?\rquote 
\par \lquote Lord Voldemort,\rquote  said Harry.
\par He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who flinched, winced and squawked if they heard words like \lquote wizard\rquote , \lquote magic\rquote  or \lquote wand\rquote , could hear the name of the most evil wiza
rd of all time without the slightest tremor.
\par \lquote Lord \endash  hang on,\rquote  said Uncle Vernon, his face screwed up, a look of dawning comprehension coming into his piggy eyes. \lquote I\rquote ve heard that name ... that was the one who \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Murdered my parents, yes,\rquote  Harry said.
\par \lquote But he\rquote s gone,\rquote  said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slightest sign that the murder of Harry\rquote s parents might be a painful topic. \lquote That giant bloke said so. He\rquote s gone.\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s back,\rquote  said Harry heavily.
\par It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia\rquote s surgi\-
cally clean kitchen, beside the top-of-the-range fridge and the wide-screen television, talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon. The arrival of the Dementors in Little Whinging seeme
d to have breached the great, invisible wall that divided the relent\-lessly non-magical world of Privet Drive and the world beyond. Harry\rquote 
s two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upside-down; the Dursleys were asking for details 
about the magical world, and Mrs Figg knew Albus Dumbledore; Dementors were soaring around Little Whinging, and he might never return to Hogwarts. Harry\rquote s head throbbed more painfully.
\par \lquote Back?\rquote  whispered Aunt Petunia.
\par She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at him before. And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was his mother\rquote 
s sister. He could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment. All he knew was that he was not
 the only person in the room who had an inkling of what Lord Voldemort being back might mean. Aunt Petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before. Her large, pale eyes (so unlike her sister\rquote 
s) were not narrowed in dislike or anger, they were wide and fearful. The furious pretence that Aunt Petunia had maintained all Harry\rquote s life \endash  that there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with Uncle Vernon \endash 
 seemed to have fallen away.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia now. \lquote He came back a month ago. I saw him.\rquote 
\par Her hands found Dudley\rquote s massive leather-clad shoulders and clutched them.
\par \lquote Hang on,\rquote  said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and back again, apparently dazed and confused by the unprece\-dented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them. \lquote Hang on. This Lord Voldything\rquote

ment the moment he reached the desk in his dark be
droom. He addressed the first to Sirius, the second to Ron and the third to Hermione. His owl, Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on the desk. Harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back, his head pounding, his brain too busy for sleep
 even though his eyes stung and itched with tiredness. His back ached from hauling Dudley home, and the two lumps on his head where the window and Dudley had hit him were throbbing painfully.
\par Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration, grindi
ng his teeth and clenching his fists, casting angry looks out at the empty, star-strewn sky every time he passed the window. Dementors sent to get him, Mrs Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at t

\par And what, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 what, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far from relieving his anger he felt worse, as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his body.
\par Just as he limped past the window, Hedwig soared through it with a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost.
\par \lquote About time!\rquote  Harry snarled, as she landed lightly on top of her cage. \lquote You can put that down, I\rquote ve got work for you!\rquote 
\par Hedwig\rquote s large, round, amber eyes gazed at him reproachfully over the dead frog clamped in her beak.
\par \lquote Come here,\rquote  said Harry, picking up the three small rolls of parch\-ment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg. \lquote Take these straight to Sirius, Ron and Hermione and don\rquote 
t come back here without good long replies. Keep pecking them till they\rquote ve written decent-length answers if you\rquote ve got to. Understand?\rquote 
\par Hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise, her beak still full of frog.
\par \lquote Get going, then,\rquote  said Harry.
\par She took off immediately. The moment she\rquote d gone, Harry threw himself down on his bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling. In addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty that he\rquote 
d been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he had at number four, Privet Drive. But he\rquote d make it up to her when she came back with the answers from Sirius, Ron and Hermione.
\par They were bound to write back quickly; they couldn\rquote t possibly ignore a Dementor attack. He\rquote d probably wake up tomor
row to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to The Burrow. And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, stifling all further thought.

aving it only to go to the bathroom. Three times that day Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat-flap Uncle Vernon had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he mi
ght as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got. Otherwise, the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom. Harry couldn\rquote

So it went on for three whole days. Harry was alternately filled with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during which time he paced his bedroom, furious at the whole lot of them for leaving him to ste
w in this mess; and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing.
\par What if they ruled against him? What if he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 expelled and his wand w
as snapped in half? What would he do, where would he go? He could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged. Might he be able to move into Sirius\rquote 
s house, as Sirius had suggested 
a year ago, before he had been forced to flee from the Ministry? Would Harry be allowed to live there alone, given that he was still underage? Or would the matter of where he went next be decided for him? Had his breach of the International Statute of Sec
recy been severe enough to land him in a cell in Azkaban? Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again.
\par On the fourth night after Hedwig\rquote s departure Harry was lying in one of his apathetic phases, staring at the c
eiling, his exhausted mind quite blank, when his uncle entered his bedroom. Harry looked slowly around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugness.
\par \lquote We\rquote re going out,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote Sorry?\rquote 
\par \lquote We \endash  that is to say, your aunt, Dudley and I \endash  are going out.\rquote 
\par \lquote Fine,\rquote  said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling.
\par \lquote You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.\rquote 
\par \lquote OK.\rquote 
\par \lquote You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our possessions.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right.\rquote 
\par \lquote You are not to steal food from the fridge.\rquote 
\par \lquote OK.\rquote 
\par \lquote I am going to lock your door.\rquote 
\par \lquote You do that.\rquote 
\par Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of argument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him. Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon\rquote s footsteps walking heavily down the stairs. A few min\-
utes later he heard the slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakeable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive.
\par Harry had no particular f
eeling about the Dursleys leaving. It made no difference to him whether they were in the house or not. He could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light. The room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the night s
ounds through the window he kept open all the time, waiting for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned.
\par The empty house creaked around him. The pipes gurgled. Harry lay there in a kind of stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in misery.
\par Then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below.
\par He sat bolt upright, listening intently. The Dursleys couldn\rquote t be back, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadn\rquote t heard their car.
\par There was silence for a few seconds, then voices.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Burglars, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 he thought, sliding off the bed on to his feet \endash 
 but a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not troubling to do so.
\par He snatched up his wand from the bedside table and stood facing his bedroom door, listening with all his might. Next moment, he jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open.
\par Harry stood motionless, staring through the open doorway at the dark upstairs landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came. He hesitated for a moment, then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of the stairs.
\par His heart shot upwards into his throat. There were people standing in the shadowy hall below, silhouetted against the street\-light glowing through the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he could see, looking up at him.
\par \lquote Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone\rquote s eye out,\rquote  said a low, growling voice.
\par Harry\rquote s heart was thumping uncontrollably. He knew that voice, but he did not lower his wand.
\par \lquote Professor Moody?\rquote  he said uncertainly.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know so much about \'93Professor\'94,\rquote  growled the voice, \lquote never got round to much teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you properly.\rquote 
\par Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it, nor did he move. He had very good reason to be suspicious. He had recently spent nine months in what he had thought was Mad-Eye Moody\rquote s company only to find out that it wasn\rquote 
t Moody at all, but an impostor; an impostor, moreover, who had tried to kill Harry before being unmasked. But before he could make a decision about what to do next, a second, slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs.
\par \lquote It\rquote s all right, Harry. We\rquote ve come to take you away.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s heart leapt. He knew that voice, too, though he hadn\rquote t heard it for over a year.
\par \lquote P-Professor Lupin?\rquote  he said disbelievingly. \lquote Is that you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Why are we all standing in the dark?\rquote  said a third voice, this one completely unfamiliar, a woman\rquote s. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Lumos.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par A wand-tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light. Harry blinked. The people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs, gazing up at him intently, some craning their heads for a better look.
\par Remus Lupin stood nearest to him. Though still qui
te young, Lupin looked tired and rather ill; he had more grey hairs than when Harry had last said goodbye to him and his robes were more patched and shabbier than ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry, who tried to smile back despite his sta
te of shock.
\par \lquote Oooh, he looks just like I thought he would,\rquote  said the witch who was holding her lit wand aloft. She looked the youngest there; she had a pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes, and short spiky hair that was a violent shade of violet. 
\lquote Wotcher, Harry!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,\rquote  said a bald black wizard standing furthest back \endash  he had a deep, slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear \endash  \lquote he looks exactly like James.\rquote 
\par \lquote Except the eyes,\rquote  said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired wizard at the back. \lquote Lily\rquote s eyes.\rquote 
\par Mad-Eye Moody, who had long grizzled grey hair and a large chunk missing from his nose, was squinting suspiciously at Harry through his mismatched eyes. One eye was small, dark and beady, the other large, round and electric blue \endash 
 the magical eye that could see through walls, doors and the back of Moody\rquote s own head.
\par \lquote Are you quite sure it\rquote s him, Lupin?\rquote  he growled. \lquote It\rquote d be a nice lookout if we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him. We ought to ask him something only 
the real Potter would know. Unless anyone brought any Veritaserum?\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, what form does your Patronus take?\rquote  Lupin asked.
\par \lquote A stag,\rquote  said Harry nervously.
\par \lquote That\rquote s him, Mad-Eye,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par Very conscious of everybody still staring at him, Harry descended the stairs, stowing his wand in the back pocket of his jeans as he came.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t put your wand there, boy!\rquote  roared Moody. \lquote What if it ignited? Better wizards than you have lost buttocks, you know!\rquote 
\par \lquote Who d\rquote you know who\rquote s lost a buttock?\rquote  the violet-haired woman asked Mad-Eye interestedly.
\par \lquote Never you mind, you just keep your wand out of your back pocket!\rquote  growled Mad-Eye. \lquote Elementary wand-safety, nobody bothers about it any more.\rquote  He stumped off towards the kitchen. \lquote And I saw that,\rquote 
 he added irritably, as the woman rolled her eyes towards the ceiling.
\par Lupin held out his hand and shook Harry\rquote s.
\par \lquote How are you?\rquote  he asked, looking closely at Harry.
\par \lquote F-fine ...\rquote 
\par Harry could hardly believe this was real. Four weeks with nothing, not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from Privet Drive, and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matter-of-factly in the house as though this was a long-standing arrange
\-ment. He glanced at the people surrounding Lupin; they were still gazing avidly at him. He felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his hair for four days.
\par \lquote I\rquote m \endash  you\rquote re really lucky the Dursleys are out ...\rquote  he mumbled.
\par \lquote Lucky, ha!\rquote  said the violet-haired woman. \lquote It was me who lured them out of the way. Sent a letter by Muggle post telling them they\rquote d been short-listed for the All-England Best Kept Suburban Lawn Competition. They\rquote 
re heading off to the prize-giving right now ... or they think they are.\rquote 
\par Harry had a fleeting vision of Uncle Vernon\rquote s face when he realised there was no All-England Best Kept Suburban Lawn Competition.
\par \lquote We are leaving, aren\rquote t we?\rquote  he asked. \lquote Soon?\rquote 
\par \lquote Almost at once,\rquote  said Lupin, \lquote we\rquote re just waiting for the all-clear.\rquote 
\par \lquote Where are we going? The Burrow?\rquote  Harry asked hopefully.
\par \lquote Not The Burrow, no,\rquote  said Lupin, motioning Harry towards the kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curiously. \lquote Too risky. We\rquote ve set up Headquarters somewhere un\-detectable. It\rquote 
s taken a while ...\rquote 
\par Mad-Eye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a hip flask, his magical eye spinning in all directions, taking in the Dursleys\rquote  many labour-saving appliances.
\par \lquote This is Alastor Moody, Harry,\rquote  Lupin continued, pointing towards Moody.
\par \lquote Yeah, I know,\rquote  said Harry uncomfortably. It felt odd to be intro\-duced to somebody he\rquote d thought he\rquote d known for a year.
\par \lquote And this is Nymphadora \endash \rquote

 said the young witch with a shudder, \lquote it\rquote s Tonks.\rquote

\par \lquote Emmeline Vance.\rquote  A stately-looking witch in an emerald green shawl inclined her head. \lquote Sturgis Podmore.\rquote  A square-jawed wizard with thick straw-coloured hair winked. \lquote And Hestia Jones.\rquote 
 A pink-cheeked, black-haired witch waved from next to the toaster.
\par Harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced. He wished they would look at something other than him; it was as though he had suddenly been ushered on-stage. He also wondered why so many of them were there.
\par \lquote A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,\rquote  said Lupin, as though he had read Harry\rquote s mind; the corners of his mouth twitched slightly.
\par \lquote Yeah, well, the more the better,\rquote  said Moody darkly. \lquote We\rquote re your guard, Potter.\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re just waiting for the signal to tell us it\rquote s safe to set off,\rquote  said Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window. \lquote We\rquote ve got about fifteen minutes.\rquote 
\par \lquote Very }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 clean, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 aren\rquote t they, these Muggles?\rquote 
 said the witch called Tonks, who was looking around the kitchen with great interest. \lquote My dad\rquote s Muggle-born and he\rquote s a right old slob. I suppose it varies, just as it does with wizards?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  yeah,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Look \endash \rquote  he turned back to Lupin, \lquote what\rquote s going on, I haven\rquote t heard anything from anyone, what\rquote s Vol\emdash ?\rquote 
\par Several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises; Dedalus Diggle dropped his hat again and Moody growled, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Shut up!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote We\rquote re not discussing anything here, it\rquote s too risky,\rquote  said Moody, turning his normal eye on Harry. His magical eye remained focused on the ceiling. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Damn it,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 he added angrily, putting a hand up to the magical eye, \lquote it keeps getting stuck 
\endash  ever since that scum wore it.\rquote 
\par And with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink, he popped out his eye.
\par \lquote Mad-Eye, you do know that\rquote s disgusting, don\rquote t you?\rquote  said Tonks conversationally.
\par \lquote Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry,\rquote  requested Moody.
\par Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean glass and filled it with water at the sink, still watched eagerly by the band of wizards. Their relentless staring was starting to annoy him.
\par \lquote Cheers,\rquote  said Moody, when Harry handed him the glass. He dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and down; the eye whizzed around, staring at them all in turn. \lquote 
I want three hundred and sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.\rquote 
\par \lquote How\rquote re we getting \endash  wherever we\rquote re going?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote Brooms,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote Only way. You\rquote re too young to Apparate, they\rquote ll be watching the Floo Network and it\rquote s more than our life\rquote s worth to set up an unauthorised Portkey.\rquote 
\par \lquote Remus says you\rquote re a good flier,\rquote  said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep voice.
\par \lquote He\rquote s excellent,\rquote  said Lupin, who was checking his watch. \lquote Anyway, you\rquote d better go and get packed, Harry, we want to be ready to go when the signal comes.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll come and help you,\rquote  said Tonks brightly.
\par She followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking around with much curiosity and interest.
\par \lquote Funny place,\rquote  she said. \lquote It\rquote s a bit }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 too }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 clean, d
\rquote you know what I mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is better,\rquote  she added, as they entered Harry\rquote s bedroom and he turned on the light.
\par His room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house. Confined to it for four days in a very bad mood, Harry had not bothered tidying up after himself. Most of the books he owned were strewn over the floor where he\rquote d 
tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside; Hedwig\rquote s cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell; and his trunk lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle clothes and wizards\rquote 
 robes that had spilled on to the floor around it.
\par Harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his trunk. Tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door.
\par \lquote You know, I don\rquote t think violet\rquote s really my colour,\rquote  she said pen\-sively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair. \lquote D\rquote you think it makes me look a bit peaky?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash \rquote  said Harry, looking up at her over the top of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote Yeah, it does,\rquote  said Tonks decisively. She screwed up her eyes in a strained expression as though she was struggling to remember something. A second later, her hair had turned bubble-gum pink.
\par \lquote How did you do that?\rquote  said Harry, gaping at her as she opened her eyes again.
\par \lquote I\rquote m a Metamorphmagus,\rquote  she said, looking back at her reflec\-tion and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions. \lquote It means I can change my appearance at will,\rquote  she added, spotting Harry\rquote 
s puzzled expression in the mirror behind her. \lquote I was born one. I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training without any study at all, it was great.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re an Auror?\rquote  said Harry, impressed. Being a Dark-wizard-catcher was the only career he\rquote d ever considered after Hogwarts.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Tonks, looking proud. \lquote Kingsley is as well, he\rquote s a bit higher up than me, though. I only qualified a year ago. Nearly failed on Stealth and Tracking. I\rquote 
m dead clumsy, did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairs?\rquote 
\par \lquote Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?\rquote  Harry asked her, straightening up, completely forgetting about packing.
\par Tonks chuckled.
\par \lquote Bet you wouldn\rquote t mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?\rquote 
\par Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry\rquote s forehead.
\par \lquote No, I wouldn\rquote t mind,\rquote  Harry mumbled, turning away. He did not like people staring at his scar.
\par \lquote Well, you\rquote ll have to learn the hard way, I\rquote m afraid,\rquote  said Tonks. \lquote Metamorphmagi are really rare, they\rquote re born, not made. Most wizards need to use a wand, or potions, to change their appearance. But we\rquote 
ve got to get going, Harry, we\rquote re supposed to be packing,\rquote  she added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor.
\par \lquote Oh \endash  yeah,\rquote  said Harry, grabbing a few more books.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be stupid, it\rquote ll be much quicker if I \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 pack!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 cried Tonks, waving her wand in a long, sweeping movement over the floor.
\par Books, clothes, telescope and scales all soared into the air and flew pell-mell into the trunk.
\par \lquote It\rquote s not very neat,\rquote  said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside. \lquote My mum\rquote s got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatly \endash  she even gets the socks to fold themselves 
\endash  but I\rquote ve never mastered how she does it \endash  it\rquote s a kind of flick \endash \rquote  She flicked her wand hopefully.
\par One of Harry\rquote s socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess in the trunk.
\par \lquote Ah, well,\rquote  said Tonks, slamming the trunk\rquote s lid shut, \lquote at least it\rquote s all in. That could do with a bit of cleaning, too.\rquote  She pointed her wand at Hedwig\rquote s cage. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry\rquote s right hand. It was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international-standard broomstick.
\par \lquote And I\rquote m still riding a Comet Two Sixty,\rquote  said Tonks enviously. \lquote Ah well ... wand still in your jeans? Both buttocks still on? OK, let\rquote s go. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Harry\rquote s trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding her wand like a conductor\rquote s baton, Tonks made the trunk hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them, Hedwig\rquote 
s cage in her left hand. Harry followed her down the stairs carrying his broomstick.
\par Back in the kitchen Moody had replaced his eye, which was spinning so fast after i
ts cleaning it made Harry feel sick to look at it. Kingsley Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore were examining the microwave and Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the drawers. Lupin was sealing a letter addres
sed to the Dursleys.
\par \lquote Excellent,\rquote  said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered. \lquote We\rquote ve got about a minute, I think. We should probably get out into the garden so we\rquote re ready. Harry, I\rquote 
ve left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote They won\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote \endash  that you\rquote re safe \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote ll just depress them.\rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and you\rquote ll see them next summer.\rquote 
\par \lquote Do I have to?\rquote 
\par Lupin smiled but made no answer.
\par \lquote Come here, boy,\rquote  said Moody gruffly, beckoning Harry towards him with his wand. \lquote I need to Disillusion you.\rquote 
\par \lquote You need to what?\rquote  said Harry nervously.
\par \lquote Disillusionment Charm,\rquote  said Moody, raising his wand. \lquote Lupin says you\rquote ve got an Invisibility Cloak, but it won\rquote t stay on while we\rquote re flying; this\rquote ll disguise you better. Here you go \endash \rquote 
\par He rapped him hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody had just smashed an egg there; cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck.
\par \lquote Nice one, Mad-Eye,\rquote  said Tonks appreciatively, staring at Harry\rquote s midriff.
\par Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body, for it didn\rquote t look anything like his any more. It was not invis\-ible; it had simply taken on the exact colour and texture of the kitchen unit behind him. He seemed to have 
become a human chameleon.
\par \lquote Come on,\rquote  said Moody, unlocking the back door with his wand.
\par They all stepped outside on to Uncle Vernon\rquote s beautifully kept lawn.
\par \lquote Clear night,\rquote  grunted Moody, his magical eye scanning the heavens. \lquote Could\rquote ve done with a bit more cloud cover. Right, you,\rquote  he barked at Harry, \lquote we\rquote re going to be flying in close formation. Tonks\rquote 
ll be right in front of you, keep close on her tail. Lupin\rquote ll be covering you from below. I\rquote m going to be behind you. The rest\rquote ll be circling us. We don\rquote t break ranks for anything, got me? If one of us is killed \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote Is that likely?\rquote  Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody ignored him.
\par \lquote \endash  the others keep flying, don\rquote t stop, don\rquote t break ranks. If they take out all of us and you survive, Harry, the rear guard are standing by to take over; keep flying east and they\rquote ll join you.\rquote 
\par \lquote Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he\rquote ll think we\rquote re not taking this seriously,\rquote  said Tonks, as she strapped Harry\rquote s trunk and Hedwig\rquote s cage into a harness hanging from her broom.
\par \lquote I\rquote m just telling the boy the plan,\rquote  growled Moody. \lquote Our job\rquote s to deliver him safely to Headquarters and if we die in the attempt \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No one\rquote s going to die,\rquote  said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep, calming voice.
\par \lquote Mount your brooms, that\rquote s the first signal!\rquote  said Lupin sharply, pointing into the sky.
\par Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had flared among the stars. Harry recognised them at once as wand sparks. He swung his right leg over his Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly and felt it vibrating very sli
ghtly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in the air once more.
\par \lquote Second signal, let\rquote s go!\rquote  said Lupin loudly as more sparks, green this time, exploded high above them.
\par Harry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night air rushed through his ha
ir as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away, shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of his head. He felt as tho
ugh his heart was going to explode with pleasure; he was flying again, flying away from Privet Drive as he\rquote 
d been fantasising about all summer, he was going home ... for a few glorious moments, all his problems seemed to recede to nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky.
\par \lquote Hard left, hard left, there\rquote s a Muggle looking up!\rquote  shouted Moody from behind him. Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom. \lquote 
We need more height ... give it another quarter of a mile!\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s eyes watered in the chill as they soared upwards; he could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Vernon\rquote 
s car ... the Dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now, full of rage about the non\-
existent Lawn Competition ... and Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was drowned by the flapping robes of the others, the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the ca
ge, and the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air. He had not felt this alive in a month, or this happy.
\par \lquote Bearing south!\rquote  shouted Mad-Eye. \lquote Town ahead!\rquote 
\par They soared right to avoid passing directly over the glittering spider\rquote s web of lights below.
\par \lquote Bear southeast and keep climbing, there\rquote s some low cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in!\rquote  called Moody.
\par \lquote We\rquote re not going through clouds!\rquote  shouted Tonks angrily, \lquote we\rquote ll get soaked, Mad-Eye!\rquote 
\par Harry was relieved to hear her say this; his hands were growing numb on the Firebolt\rquote s handle. He wished he had thought to put on a coat; he was starting to shiver.
\par They altered their course every now and then according to Mad-Eye\rquote s instructions. Harry\rquote s eyes were screwed up against the rush of ic
y wind that was starting to make his ears ache; he could remember being this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff in his third year, which had taken place in a storm. The guard around him was circling continuousl
y like giant birds of prey. Harry lost track of time. He wondered how long they had been flying, it felt like an hour at least.
\par \lquote Turning southwest!\rquote  yelled Moody. \lquote We want to avoid the motorway!\rquote 
\par Harry was now so chilled he thought longingly of the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming along below, then, even more long\-
ingly, of travelling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames ... Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around him, bald pate an
d earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight ... now Emmeline Vance was on his right, her wand out, her head turning left and right ... then she, too, swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore ...
\par \lquote We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure we\rquote re not being followed!\rquote  Moody shouted.
\par \lquote ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE?\rquote  Tonks screamed from the front. \lquote We\rquote re all frozen to our brooms! If we keep going off-course we\rquote re not going to get there until next week! Besides, we\rquote re nearly there now!\rquote 
\par \lquote Time to start the descent!\rquote  came Lupin\rquote s voice. \lquote Follow Tonks, Harry!\rquote 
\par Harry followed Tonks into a dive. They were heading for the largest collection of lights he had yet seen, a huge, sprawling criss-crossing mass, glittering in lines and grids, interspersed with pat
ches of deepest black. Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could see individual headlights and streetlamps, chimneys and television aerials. He wanted to reach the ground very much, though he felt sure someone would have to unfreeze him from his broom.

\par \lquote Here we go!\rquote  called Tonks, and a few seconds later she had landed.
\par Harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square. Tonks was already unbuckling Harry\rquote s trunk. Shivering, Harry looked around. 
The grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamps, paint was peeling from many of the doors and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps.

\par \lquote Where are we?\rquote  Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, \lquote In a minute.\rquote 
\par Moody was rummaging in his cloak, his gnarled hands clumsy with cold.
\par \lquote Got it,\rquote  he muttered, raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it.
\par The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. He clicked the unlighter again; the next lamp went out; he kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only remaining light came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead.

\par \lquote Borrowed it from Dumbledore,\rquote  growled Moody, pocketing the Put-Outer. \lquote That\rquote ll take care of any Muggles looking out of the window, see? Now come on, quick.\rquote 
\par He took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass, across the road and on to the pavement; Lupin and Tonks fol\-lowed, carrying Harry\rquote s trunk between them, the rest of the guard, all with their wands out, flanking them.
\par The muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house. A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging bin-bags just inside the broken gate.
\par \lquote Here,\rquote  Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of parchment towards Harry\rquote s Disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it, so as to illuminate the writing. \lquote Read quickly and memorise.\rquote 
\par Harry looked down at the piece of paper. The narrow hand\-writing was vaguely familiar. It said:

\par He pulled the piece of parchment out of Harry\rquote s hand and set fire to it with his wand-tip. As the message curled into flames and floated to the ground, Harry looked around at the house
s again. They were standing outside number eleven; he looked to the left and saw number ten; to the right, however, was number thirteen.
\par \lquote But where\rquote s \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Think about what you\rquote ve just memorised,\rquote  said Lupin quietly.
\par Harry thought, and no sooner had he reac
hed the part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing those on either si
de out of its way. Harry gaped at it. The stereo in number eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles inside hadn\rquote t felt anything.
\par \lquote Come on, hurry,\rquote  growled Moody, prodding Harry in the back.
\par Harry walked up the worn stone steps, staring at the newly materialised door. Its black paint was shabby and scratched. The silver doorknocker was in the form of a twisted serpent. There was no keyhole or letterbox.
\par Lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once. Harry heard many loud, metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a chain. The door creaked open.
\par \lquote Get in quick, Harry,\rquote  Lupin whispered, \lquote but don\rquote t go far inside and don\rquote t touch anything.\rquote 
\par Harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of the hall. He could smell damp, dust and a s
weetish, rotting smell; the place had the feeling of a derelict building. He looked over his shoulder and saw the others filing in behind him, Lupin and Tonks carrying his trunk and Hedwig\rquote 
s cage. Moody was standing on the top step releasing the balls of l
ight the Put-Outer had stolen from the streetlamps; they flew back to their bulbs and the square glowed momentarily with orange light before Moody limped inside and closed the front door, so that the darkness in the hall became complete.
\par \lquote Here \endash \rquote 
\par He rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand; Harry felt as though something hot was trickling down his back this time and knew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted.
\par \lquote Now stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light in here,\rquote  Moody whispered.
\par The others\rquote 
 hushed voices were giving Harry an odd feeling of foreboding; it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying person. He heard a soft hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas lamps sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a flicker\-
ing insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls. Harry heard something scuttling behind the sk
irting board. Both the chandelier and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents.
\par There were hurried footsteps and Ron\rquote s mother, Mrs Weasley, emerged from a door at the far end of the hall. She was beaming in welcome as she hurried 
towards them, though Harry noticed that she was rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen her.
\par \lquote Oh, Harry, it\rquote s lovely to see you!\rquote  she whispered, pulling him into a rib-cracking hug before holding him at arm\rquote s length and examining him critically. \lquote You\rquote re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you\rquote 
ll have to wait a bit for dinner, I\rquote m afraid.\rquote 
\par She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered urgently, \lquote He\rquote s just arrived, the meeting\rquote s started.\rquote 
\par The wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest and excite\-ment and began filing past him towards the door through which Mrs Weasley had just come. Harry made to follow Lupin, but Mrs Weasley held him back.
\par \lquote No, Harry, the meeting\rquote s only for members of the Order. Ron and Hermione are upstairs, you can wait with them until the meeting\rquote s over, then we\rquote ll have dinner. And keep your voice down in the hall,\rquote 
 she added in an urgent whisper.
\par \lquote Why?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t want anything to wake up.\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll explain later, I\rquote ve got to hurry, I\rquote m supposed to be at the meeting \endash  I\rquote ll just show you where you\rquote re sleeping.\rquote 
\par Pressing her finger to her lips, she led him on tiptoe past a pair of long, moth-eaten curtains, behind which Harry supposed there must be another door, and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed troll
\rquote s leg they started up the dark staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall. A closer look showed Harry that the heads belonged to house-elves. All of them had the same rather snout-like nose.
\par Harry\rquote s bewilderment deepened with every step he took. What on earth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to the Darkest of wizards?
\par \lquote Mrs Weasley, why \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I\rquote ve really got to dash,\rquote  Mrs Weasley whispered distractedly. \lquote There \endash \rquote  they had reached the second landing, \lquote \endash  you\rquote re the door on the right. I
\rquote ll call you when it\rquote s over.\rquote 
\par And she hurried off downstairs again.
\par Harry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom doorknob, which was shaped like a serpent\rquote s head, and opened the door.
\par He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded room; then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even louder shriek, and his vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair. Hermione had thrown her\-
self on to him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat, while Ron\rquote s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, zoomed excitedly round and round their heads.
\par \lquote HARRY! Ron, he\rquote s here, Harry\rquote s here! We didn\rquote t hear you arrive! Oh, how }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 you? Are you all right? Have you been furious with us? I bet you have, I know our letters were useless \endash  but we couldn\rquote t tell you anything, Dumbledore made us swear we wouldn\rquote 
t, oh, we\rquote ve got so much to tell you, and you\rquote ve got things to tell us \endash  the Dementors! When we heard \endash  and that Ministry hearing \endash  it\rquote s just outrageous, I\rquote ve looked it all up, they can\rquote 
t expel you, they just can\rquote t, there\rquote s provision in the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in life-threatening situations \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Let him breathe, Hermione,\rquote  said Ron, grinning as he closed the door behind Harry. He seemed to have grown several more inches during their month apart, maki
ng him taller and more gangly looking than ever, though the long nose, bright red hair and freckles were the same.
\par Still beaming, Hermione let go of Harry, but before she could say another word there was a soft whooshing sound and some\-thing white soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on Harry\rquote s shoulder.
\par \lquote Hedwig!\rquote 
\par The snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affection\-ately as Harry stroked her feathers.
\par \lquote She\rquote s been in a right state,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Pecked us half to death when she brought your last letters, look at this \endash \rquote 
\par He showed Harry the index finger of his right hand, which sported a half-healed but clearly deep cut.
\par \lquote Oh, yeah,\rquote  Harry said. \lquote Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, you know \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We wanted to give them to you, mate,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Hermione was going spare, she kept saying you\rquote d do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news, but Dumbledore made us-\rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  swear not to tell me,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Yeah, Hermione\rquote s already said.\rquote 
\par The warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two best friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his stomach. All of a sudden \endash  after yearning to see them for a solid month \endash 
 he felt he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone.
\par There was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig automatically, not looking at either of the others.
\par \lquote He seemed to think it was best,\rquote  said Hermione rather breath\-lessly. \lquote Dumbledore, I mean.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry. He noticed that her hands, too, bore the marks of Hedwig\rquote s beak and found that he was not at all sorry.
\par \lquote I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles \endash \rquote  Ron began.
\par \lquote Yeah?\rquote  said Harry, raising his eyebrows. \lquote Have either of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 been attacked by Dementors this summer?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, no \endash  but that\rquote s why he\rquote s had people from the Order of the Phoenix tailing you all the time \endash \rquote 
\par Harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a step going downstairs. So everyone had known he was being fol\-lowed, except him.
\par \lquote Didn\rquote t work that well, though, did it?\rquote  said Harry, doing his utmost to keep his voice even. \lquote Had to look after myself after all, didn\rquote t I?\rquote 
\par \lquote He was so angry,\rquote  said Hermione, in an almost awestruck voice. \lquote Dumbledore. We saw him. When he found out Mundungus had left before his shift had ended. He was scary.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote m glad he left,\rquote  Harry said coldly. \lquote If he hadn\rquote t, I wouldn\rquote t have done magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at Privet Drive all summer.\rquote 
\par \lquote Aren\rquote t you ... aren\rquote t you worried about the Ministry of Magic hearing?\rquote  said Hermione quietly.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  Harry lied defiantly. He walked away from them, looking around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder, but this room was not likely to raise his spirits. It was dank and dark. A blank stretch of canvas in an ornate picture 
frame was all that relieved the bareness of the peeling walls, and as Harry passed it he thought he heard someone, who was lurking out of sight, snigger.
\par \lquote So why\rquote s Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark?\rquote  Harry asked, still trying hard to keep his voice casual. \lquote Did you \endash  er \endash  bother to ask him at all?\rquote 
\par He glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told him he was behaving just as they had feared he would. It did nothing to improve his temper.
\par \lquote We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote We did, mate. But he\rquote s really busy now, we\rquote ve only seen him twice since we came here and he didn\rquote 
t have much time, he just made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, he said the owls might be intercepted.\rquote 
\par \lquote He could still\rquote ve kept me informed if he\rquote d wanted to,\rquote  Harry said shortly. \lquote You\rquote re not telling me he doesn\rquote t know ways to send messages without owls.\rquote 
\par Hermione glanced at Ron and then said, \lquote I thought that, too. But he didn\rquote t want you to know }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 anything.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote Maybe he thinks I can\rquote t be trusted,\rquote  said Harry, watching their expressions.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be thick,\rquote  said Ron, looking highly disconcerted.
\par \lquote Or that I can\rquote t take care of myself.\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course he doesn\rquote t think that!\rquote  said Hermione anxiously.
\par \lquote So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys\rquote  while you two get to join in everything that\rquote s going on here?\rquote  said Harry, the words tumbling over one another in a rush, his voice growing louder with every word. \lquote 
How come you two are allowed to know every\-thing that\rquote s going on?\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re not!\rquote  Ron interrupted. \lquote Mum won\rquote t let us near the meet\-ings, she says we\rquote re too young \endash \rquote 
\par But before he knew it, Harry was shouting.
\par \lquote SO YOU HAVEN\rquote T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG DEAL! YOU\rquote VE STILL BEEN HERE, HAVEN\rquote T YOU? YOU\rquote VE STILL BEEN TOGETHER! ME, I\rquote VE BEEN STUCK AT THE DURSLEYS\rquote  FOR A MONTH! AND I\rquote VE HANDLED MORE THAN YOU TWO
\rquote VE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE KNOWS IT \endash  WHO SAVED THE PHILOSOPHER\rquote S STONE? WHO GOT RID OF RIDDLE? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS?\rquote 
\par Every bitter and resentful thought Harry had had in the past month was pouring out of him: his frustration at the lack of news, the hurt that they had all been together without him, his fury at being followed and not told about it \endash 
 all the feelings he was half-ashamed of finally burst their boundaries. Hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off to the top of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon twittered in alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads.
\par \lquote WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR? WHO SAW }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 HIM}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Ron was standing there with his mouth half-open, clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say, whilst Hermione looked on the verge of tears.
\par \lquote BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT\rquote S GOING ON? WHY SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO TELL ME WHAT\rquote S BEEN HAPPENING?\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did \endash \rquote  Hermione began.
\par \lquote CAN\rquote T\rquote VE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR YOU\rquote D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 DUMBLEDORE MADE YOU SWEAR \endash \rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par \lquote Harry, we\rquote re really sorry!\rquote  said Hermione desperately, her eyes now sparkling with tears. \lquote You\rquote re absolutely right, Harry \endash  I\rquote d be furious if it was me!\rquote 
\par Harry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from them again, pacing up and down. Hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe. There was a long pause, broken only by the mournful creak of the floorboards below Harry\rquote s feet.

\par \lquote What }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 is}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148  this place, anyway?\rquote  he shot at Ron and Hermione.
\par \lquote Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,\rquote  said Ron at once.
\par \lquote Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the Phoenix \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s a secret society,\rquote  said Hermione quickly. \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s in charge, he founded it. It\rquote s the people who fought against You-Know-Who last time.\rquote 
\par \lquote Who\rquote s in it?\rquote  said Harry, coming to a halt with his hands in his pockets.
\par \lquote Quite a few people \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote ve met about twenty of them,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote but we think there are more.\rquote 
\par Harry glared at them.

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Voldemort!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said Harry furiously, and b

\par \lquote We\rquote ve }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 told }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 you, the Order don\rquote t let us in on their meetings,
\rquote  said Hermione nervously. \lquote So we don\rquote t know the details \endash  but we\rquote ve got a general idea,\rquote  she added hastily, seeing the look on Harry\rquote s face.
\par \lquote Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote They\rquote re really useful.\rquote 
\par \lquote Extendable \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ears, yeah. Only we\rquote ve had to stop using them lately because Mum found out and went berserk. 
Fred and George had to hide them all to stop Mum binning them. But we got a good bit of use out of them before Mum realised what was going on. We know some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you know \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote Some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order \endash \rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote And some of them are standing guard over something,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote They\rquote re always talking about guard duty.\rquote 
\par \lquote Couldn\rquote t have been me, could it?\rquote  said Harry sarcastically.
\par \lquote Oh, yeah,\rquote  said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension.
\par Harry snorted. He walked around the room again, looking any\-where but at Ron and Hermione. \lquote So, what have you two been doing, if you\rquote re not allowed in meetings?\rquote  he demanded. \lquote You said you\rquote d been busy.\rquote 
\par \lquote We have,\rquote  said Hermione quickly. \lquote We\rquote ve been decontaminating this house, it\rquote s been empty for ages and stuff\rquote s been breeding in here. We\rquote ve managed to clean out the kitchen, most of the bed\-
rooms and I think we\rquote re doing the drawing room tomo\emdash  AARGH!\rquote 
\par With two loud cracks, Fred and George, Ron\rquote s elder twin brothers, had materialised out of thin air in the middle of the room. Pigwidgeon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join Hedwig on top of the wardrobe.
\par \lquote Stop }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 doing }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 that!\rquote 
 Hermione said weakly to the twins, who were as vividly red-haired as Ron, though stockier and slightly shorter.
\par \lquote Hello, Harry,\rquote  said George, beaming at him. \lquote We thought we heard your dulcet tones.\rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all out,\rquote  said Fred, also beaming. \lquote There might be a couple of people fifty miles away who didn\rquote t hear you.\rquote 
\par \lquote You two passed your Apparation tests, then?\rquote  asked Harry grumpily.
\par \lquote With distinction,\rquote  said Fred, who was holding what looked like a piece of very long, flesh-coloured string.
\par \lquote It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Time is Galleons, little brother,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote Anyway, Harry, you\rquote re interfering with reception. Extendable Ears,\rquote  he added in response to Harry\rquote 
s raised eyebrows, and held up the string which Harry now saw was trailing out on to the landing. \lquote We\rquote re trying to hear what\rquote s going on downstairs.\rquote 
\par \lquote You want to be careful,\rquote  said Ron, staring at the Ear, \lquote if Mum sees one of them again ...\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s worth the risk, that\rquote s a major meeting they\rquote re having,\rquote  said Fred.
\par The door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared.
\par \lquote Oh, hello, Harry!\rquote  said Ron\rquote s younger sister, Ginny, brightly. \lquote I thought I heard your voice.\rquote 
\par Turning to Fred and George, she said, \lquote It\rquote s no-go with the Extendable Ears, she\rquote s gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen door.\rquote 
\par \lquote How d\rquote you know?\rquote  said George, looking crestfallen.
\par \lquote Tonks told me how to find out,\rquote  said Ginny. \lquote You just chuck stuff at the door and if it can\rquote t make contact the door\rquote s been Imperturbed. I\rquote 
ve been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it, so there\rquote s no way the Extendable Ears will be able to get under the gap.\rquote 
\par Fred heaved a deep sigh.
\par \lquote Shame. I really fancied finding out what old Snape\rquote s been up to.\rquote 
\par \lquote Snape!\rquote  said Harry quickly. \lquote Is he here?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said George, carefully closing the door and sitting down on one of the beds; Fred and Ginny followed. \lquote Giving a report. Top secret.\rquote 
\par \lquote Git,\rquote  said Fred idly.
\par \lquote He\rquote s on our side now,\rquote  said Hermione reprovingly.
\par Ron snorted. \lquote Doesn\rquote t stop him being a git. The way he looks at us when he sees us.\rquote 
\par \lquote Bill doesn\rquote t like him, either,\rquote  said Ginny, as though that settled the matter.
\par Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his thirst for information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting. He sank on to the bed opposite the others.
\par \lquote Is Bill here?\rquote  he asked. \lquote I thought he was working in Egypt?\rquote 
\par \lquote He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the Order,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote He says he misses the tombs, but,\rquote  he smirked, \lquote there are compensations.\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote Remember old Fleur Delacour?\rquote  said George. \lquote She\rquote s got a job at Gringotts to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 eemprove \rquote er Eeenglish \endash \rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote And Bill\rquote s been giving her a lot of private lessons,\rquote  sniggered Fred.
\par \lquote Charlie\rquote s in the Order, too,\rquote  said George, \lquote but he\rquote s still in Romania. Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so Charlie\rquote s trying to make contacts on his days off.\rquote 
\par \lquote Couldn\rquote t Percy do that?\rquote  Harry asked. The last he had heard, the third Weasley brother was working in the Department of International Magical Co-operation at the Ministry of Magic.
\par At Harry\rquote s words, all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly significant looks.
\par \lquote Whatever you do, don\rquote t mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,\rquote  Ron told Harry in a tense voice.
\par \lquote Why not?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because every time Percy\rquote s name\rquote s mentioned, Dad breaks what\-ever he\rquote s holding and Mum starts crying,\rquote  Fred said.
\par \lquote It\rquote s been awful,\rquote  said Ginny sadly.
\par \lquote I think we\rquote re well shot of him,\rquote  said George, with an uncharacter\-istically ugly look on his face.
\par \lquote What\rquote s happened?\rquote  Harry said.
\par \lquote Percy and Dad had a row,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote I\rquote ve never seen Dad row with anyone like that. It\rquote s normally Mum who shouts.\rquote 
\par \lquote It was the first week back after term ended,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote We were about to come and join the Order. Percy came home and told us he\rquote d been promoted.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re kidding?\rquote  said Harry.
\par Though he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious, Harry\rquote s impression was that Percy
 had not made a great success of his first job at the Ministry of Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by Lord Voldemort (not that the Ministry had believed it \endash 
 they all thought Mr Crouch had gone mad).
\par \lquote Yeah, we were all surprised,\rquote  said George, \lquote 
because Percy got into a load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything. They said Percy ought to have realised Crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left him in charge, he wasn\rquote 
t going to complain.\rquote 
\par \lquote So how come they promoted him?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s exactly what we wondered,\rquote  said Ron, who seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped yelling. \lquote He came home really pleased with himself \endash 
 even more pleased than usual, if you can imagine that \endash  and told Dad he\rquote d been offered a position in Fudge\rquote s own office. A really good one for someone only a year out of Hogwarts: Junior Assistant to the Minister. He expected Dad 
to be all impressed, I think.\rquote 
\par \lquote Only Dad wasn\rquote t,\rquote  said Fred grimly.
\par \lquote Why not?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry checking that nobody\rquote s having any contact with Dumbledore,\rquote  said George.
\par \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s name is mud with the Ministry these days, see,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote They all think he\rquote s just making trouble saying You-Know-Who\rquote s back.\rquote 
\par \lquote Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who\rquote s in league with Dumbledore can clear out their desks,\rquote  said George.
\par \lquote Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he\rquote s friendly with Dumbledore, and he\rquote s always thought Dad\rquote s a bit of a weirdo because of his Muggle obsession.\rquote 
\par \lquote But what\rquote s that got to do with Percy?\rquote  asked Harry, confused.
\par \lquote I\rquote m coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy on the family \endash  and Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par Harry let out a low whistle.
\par \lquote Bet Percy loved that.\rquote 
\par Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way.
\par \lquote He went completely berserk. He said \endash  well, he said loads of terrible stuff. He said he\rquote s been having to struggle against Dad\rquote s lousy reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad\rquote s got no ambition and that
\rquote s why we\rquote ve always been \endash  you know \endash  not had a lot of money, I mean \endash \rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote What?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an angry cat.
\par \lquote I know,\rquote  said Ron in a low voice. \lquote And it got worse. He said Dad was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore, that Dumble\-dore was heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and that he \endash  Percy \endash 
 knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the Ministry. And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he didn\rquote t belong to our family any more. And he packed his bags the 
same night and left. He\rquote s living here in London now.\rquote 
\par Harry swore under his breath. He had always liked Percy least of Ron\rquote s brothers, but he had never imagined he would say such things to Mr Weasley.
\par \lquote Mum\rquote s been in a right state,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote You know \endash  crying and stuff. She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed the door in her face. I dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work \endash 
 ignores him, I s\rquote pose.\rquote 
\par \lquote But Percy }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 must }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 know Voldemort\rquote s back,\rquote  said Harry slowly. 
\lquote He\rquote s not stupid, he must know your mum and dad wouldn\rquote t risk every\-thing without proof.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,\rquote  said Ron, shooting Harry a furtive look. \lquote Percy said the only evidence was your word and ... I dunno ... he didn\rquote t think it was good enough.\rquote 
\par \lquote Percy takes the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 seriously,\rquote 
 said Hermione tartly, and the others all nodded.
\par \lquote What are you talking about?\rquote  Harry asked, looking around at them all. They were all regarding him warily.
\par \lquote Haven\rquote t \endash  haven\rquote t you been getting the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Hermione asked nervously.
\par \lquote Yeah, I have!\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Have you \endash  er \endash  been reading it thoroughly?\rquote  Hermione asked, still more anxiously.
\par \lquote Not cover to cover,\rquote  said Harry defensively. \lquote If they were going to report anything about Voldemort it would be headline news, wouldn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par The others flinched at the sound of the name. Hermione hur\-ried on, \lquote Well, you\rquote d need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but they \endash  um \endash  they mention you a couple of times a week.\rquote 
\par \lquote But I\rquote d have seen \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Not if you\rquote ve only been reading the front page, you wouldn\rquote t,\rquote  said Hermione, shaking her head. \lquote I\rquote m not talking about big articles. They just slip you in, like you\rquote re a standing joke.\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s quite nasty, actually,\rquote  said Hermione in a voice of forced calm. \lquote They\rquote re just building on Rita\rquote s stuff.\rquote 
\par \lquote But she\rquote s not writing for them any more, is she?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, no, she\rquote s kept her promise \endash  not that she\rquote s got any choice,\rquote  Hermione added with satisfaction. \lquote But she laid the foundation for what they\rquote re trying to do now.\rquote 
\par \lquote Which is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 what?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said Harry impatiently.
\par \lquote OK, you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was hurting and all that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita Skeeter\rquote s stories about him in a hurry.
\par \lquote Well, they\rquote re writing about you as though you\rquote re this deluded, attention-seeking person who thinks he\rquote s a great tragic hero or something,\rquote 
 said Hermione, very fast, as though it would be less unpleasant for Harry to hear these facts quickly. \lquote They keep slip\-ping in snide comments about you. If some far-fetched story appears, they say something like, \'93A tale worthy of Harry Potter
\'94, and if anyone has a funny accident or anything it\rquote s, \'93Let\rquote s hope he hasn\rquote t got a scar on his forehead or we\rquote ll be asked to worship him next\'94 \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t want anyone to worship \endash \rquote  Harry began hotly.
\par \lquote I know you don\rquote t,\rquote  said Hermione quickly, looking frightened. \lquote I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 know, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Harry. But you see what they\rquote re doing? They want to turn you into someone nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, I\rquote ll bet anything. They want wizards on the street to think you\rquote 
re just some stupid boy who\rquote s a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it going.\rquote 
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t ask \endash  I didn\rquote t want \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Voldemort killed my parents!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Harry spluttered. \lquote I got famous because he murdered my family but couldn\rquote t kill me! Who wants to be famous for that? Don\rquote t they think I\rquote d rather it\rquote d never \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote We }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 know, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Harry,\rquote  said Ginny earnestly.
\par \lquote And of course, they didn\rquote t report a word about the Dementors attacking you,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Someone\rquote s told them to keep that quiet. That should\rquote ve been a really big story, out-of-control Dementors. They haven
\rquote t even reported that you broke the International Statute of Secrecy. We thought they would, it would tie in so well with this image of you as some stupid show-off. We think they\rquote re biding their time until you\rquote re expelled, then they
\rquote re really going to go to town \endash  I mean, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 if }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 you\rquote 
re expelled, obviously,\rquote  she went on hastily. \lquote You really shouldn\rquote t be, not if they abide by their own laws, there\rquote s no case against you.\rquote 
\par They were back on the hearing and Harry did not want to think about that. He cast around for another change of subject, but was saved the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs.
\par \lquote Uh oh.\rquote 
\par Fred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was another loud crack and he and George vanished. Seconds later, Mrs Weasley appeared in the bedroom doorway.
\par \lquote The meeting\rquote s over, you can come down and have dinner now. Everyone\rquote s dying to see you, Harry. And who\rquote s left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen door?\rquote 
\par \lquote Crookshanks,\rquote  said Ginny unblushingly. \lquote He loves playing with them.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, \lquote I thought it might have been Kreacher, he keeps doing odd things like that. Now don\rquote t forget to keep your voices down in the hall. Ginn
y, your hands are filthy, what have you been doing? Go and wash them before dinner, please.\rquote 
\par Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room, leaving Harry alone with Ron and Hermione. Both of them were watching him apprehensively, as 
though they feared he would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone. The sight of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed.
\par \lquote Look ...\rquote  he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Hermione said quietly, \lquote We knew you\rquote d be angry, Harry, we really don\rquote t blame you, but you\rquote ve got to understand, we }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 did }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 try to persuade Dumbledore \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I know,\rquote  said Harry shortly.
\par He cast around for a topic that didn\rquote t involve his headmaster, because the very thought of Dumbledore made Harry\rquote s insides burn with anger again.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s Kreacher?\rquote  he asked.
\par \lquote The house-elf who lives here,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Nutter. Never met one like him.\rquote 
\par Hermione frowned at Ron.
\par \lquote He\rquote s not a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 nutter, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Ron.\rquote 
\par \lquote His life\rquote s ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like his mother,\rquote  said Ron irritably. \lquote Is that normal, Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well \endash  well, if he is a bit strange, it\rquote s not his fault.\rquote 
\par Ron rolled his eyes at Harry.
\par \lquote Hermione still hasn\rquote t given up on SPEW.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s not SPEW!\rquote  said Hermione heatedly. \lquote It\rquote s the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare. And it\rquote s not just me, Dumbledore says we should be kind to Kreacher too.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, yeah,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote C\rquote mon, I\rquote m starving.\rquote 
\par He led the way out of the door and on to the landing, but before they could descend the stairs \endash 
\par \lquote Hold it!\rquote  Ron breathed, flinging out an arm to stop Harry and Hermione walking any further. \lquote They\rquote re still in the hall, we might be able to hear something.\rquote 
\par The three of them looked cautiously over the banisters. The gloomy hallway below was packed with witches and wizards, including all of Harry\rquote 
s guard. They were whispering excitedly together. In the very centre of the group Harry saw the dark, greasy-haired head and promi\-nent nose of his least favourite teacher at Hogwarts, Professor Snape. Harry leant 
further over the banisters. He was very interested in what Snape was doing for the Order of the Phoenix ...
\par A thin piece of flesh-coloured string descended in front of Harry\rquote s eyes. Looking up, he saw Fred and George on the landing above, cautiously loweri
ng the Extendable Ear towards the dark knot of people below. A moment later, however, they all began to move towards the front door and out of sight.
\par \lquote Dammit,\rquote  Harry heard Fred whisper, as he hoisted the Extendable Ear back up again.
\par They heard the front door open, then close.
\par \lquote Snape never eats here,\rquote  Ron told Harry quietly. \lquote Thank God. C\rquote mon.\rquote 
\par \lquote And don\rquote t forget to keep your voice down in the hall, Harry,\rquote  Hermione whispered.
\par As they passed the row of house-elf heads on the wall, they saw Lupin, Mrs Weasley and Tonks at the front door, magically sealing its many locks and bolts behind those who had just left.
\par \lquote We\rquote re eating down in the kitchen,\rquote  Mrs Weasley whispered, meeting them at the bottom of the stairs. \lquote Harry, dear, if you\rquote ll just tiptoe across the hall it\rquote s through this door here \endash \rquote 
\par CRASH.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Tonks!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
cried Mrs Weasley in exasperation, turning to look behind her.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry!\rquote  wailed Tonks, who was lying flat on the floor. \lquote It\rquote s that stupid umbrella stand, that\rquote s the second time I\rquote ve tripped over \endash \rquote 
\par But the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible, ear-splitting, blood-curdling screech.
\par The moth-eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed earlier had flown apart, but there was 
no door behind them. For a split second, Harry thought he was looking through a window, a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she were being tortured \endash 
 then he realised it was simply a life-size portrait, but the most realistic, and the most unpleasant, he had ever seen in his life.
\par The old woman was drooling, her eyes were rolling, the yel\-lowing skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed; and all along the hall behind them, the other portraits awoke a
nd began to yell, too, so that Harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands over his ears.
\par Lupin and Mrs Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the cur\-tains shut over the old woman, but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever, brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at their faces.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Filth! Scum! By-products of dirt and vileness! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers \endash

\par Tonks apologised over and over again, dragging the huge, heavy troll\rquote 
s leg back off the floor; Mrs Weasley abandoned the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall, Stunning all the other portraits with her wand; and a man with long black hair came charging out of a door facing Harry.
\par \lquote Shut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!\rquote  he roared, seizing the curtain Mrs Weasley had abandoned.
\par The old woman\rquote s face blanched.

\par \lquote But what\rquote s a portrait of your mother doing here?\rquote  Harry asked, bewildered, as they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps, the others just behind them.
\par \lquote Hasn\rquote t anyone told you? This was my parents\rquote  house,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote But I\rquote m the last Black left, so it\rquote s mine now. I offered it to Dumbledore for Headquarters \endash  about the only useful thing I\rquote 
ve been able to do.\rquote 
\par Harry, who had expected a better welcome, noted how hard and bitter Sirius\rquote s voice sounded. He followed his godfather to the bottom of the steps and through a door leading into the basement kitchen.
\par It was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above, a cavernous room with rough stone walls. Most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the room. A haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes, through whi
ch loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling. Many chairs had been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the middle of them, littered with rolls of parchment, goblets, empty wine 
bottles, and a heap of what appeared to be rags. Mr Weasley and his eldest son Bill were talking quietly with their heads together at the end of the table.
\par Mrs Weasley cleared her throat. Her husband, a thin, balding, red-haired man who wore horn-rimmed glasses, looked around and jumped to his feet.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  Mr Weasley said, hurrying forward to greet him, and shaking his hand vigorously. \lquote Good to see you!\rquote 
\par Over his shoulder Harry saw Bill, who still wore his long hair in a ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table.
\par \lquote Journey all right, Harry?\rquote  Bill called, trying to gather up twelve scrolls at once. \lquote Mad-Eye didn\rquote t make you come via Greenland, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote He tried,\rquote  said Tonks, striding over to help Bill and immedi\-ately toppling a candle on to the last piece of parchment. \lquote Oh no \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 sorry

\par \lquote Here, dear,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand. In the flash of light caused by Mrs Weasley\rquote s charm Harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building.

\par Mrs Weasley had seen him looking. She snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into Bill\rquote s already overladen arms.
\par \lquote This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings,\rquote  she snapped, before sweeping off towards an ancient dresser from which she started unloading dinner plates.
\par Bill took out his wand, muttered, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Evanesco!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
and the scrolls vanished.
\par \lquote Sit down, Harry,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote You\rquote ve met Mundungus, haven\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par The thing Harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged, grunting snore, then jerked awake.
\par \lquote Some\rquote n say m\rquote name?\rquote  Mundungus mumbled sleepily. \lquote I \rquote gree with Sirius ...\rquote  He raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting, his droopy, bloodshot eyes unfocused.
\par Ginny giggled.
\par \lquote The meeting\rquote s over, Dung,\rquote  said Sirius, as they all sat down around him at the table. \lquote Harry\rquote s arrived.\rquote 
\par \lquote Eh?\rquote  said Mundungus, peering balefully at Harry through his matted ginger hair. \lquote Blimey, so \rquote e \rquote as. Yeah ... you all right, \rquote Arry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Mundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets, still staring at Harry, and pulled out a grimy black pipe. He stuck it in his mouth, ignited the end of it with his wand and took a deep pull on it. Great billowing clouds of greenish smoke obscured him within s
econds.
\par \lquote Owe you a \rquote pology,\rquote  grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly cloud.
\par \lquote For the last time, Mundungus,\rquote  called Mrs Weasley, \lquote will you please }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  said Mundungus. \lquote Right. Sorry, Molly.\rquote 
\par The cloud of smoke vanished as Mundungus stowed his pipe back in his pocket, but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered.
\par \lquote And if you want dinner before midnight I\rquote ll need a hand,\rquote  Mrs Weasley said to the room at large. \lquote No, you can stay where you are, Harry dear, you\rquote ve had a long journey.\rquote 
\par \lquote What can I do, Molly?\rquote  said Tonks enthusiastically, bounding forwards.
\par Mrs Weasley hesitated, looking apprehensive.
\par \lquote Er \endash  no, it\rquote s all right, Tonks, you have a rest too, you\rquote ve done enough today.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, no, I want to help!\rquote  said Tonks brightly, knocking over a chair as she hurried towards the dresser, from which Ginny was collecting cutlery.
\par Soon, a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegeta\-bles of their own accord, supervised by Mr Weasley,
 while Mrs Weasley stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates, more goblets and food from the pantry. Harry was left at the table with Sirius and Mundungus, who was still blinking at him mournfully.
\par \lquote Seen old Figgy since?\rquote  he asked.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote I haven\rquote t seen anyone.\rquote 
\par \lquote See, I wouldn\rquote t \rquote ave left,\rquote  said Mundungus, leaning forward, a pleading note in his voice, \lquote but I \rquote ad a business opportunity \endash \rquote 
\par Harry felt something brush against his knees and started, but it was only Crookshanks, Hermione\rquote s bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself once around Harry\rquote s legs, purring, then jumped on to Sirius\rquote 
s lap and curled up. Sirius scratched him absent-mindedly behind the ears as he turned, still grim-faced, to Harry.
\par \lquote Had a good summer so far?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, it\rquote s been lousy,\rquote  said Harry.
\par For the first time, something like a grin flitted across Sirius\rquote s face.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t know what you\rquote re complaining about, myself.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote What?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said Harry incredulously.
\par \lquote Personally, I\rquote d have welcomed a Dementor attack. A deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely. You think you\rquote ve had it bad, at least you\rquote

\par \lquote How come?\rquote  asked Harry, frowning.
\par \lquote Because the Ministry of Magic\rquote s still after me, and Voldemort will know all about me being an Animagus by now, Wormtail will have told him, so my big disguise is useless. There\rquote 
s not much I can do for the Order of the Phoenix ... or so Dumbledore feels.\rquote 
\par There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which Sirius uttered Dumbledore\rquote s name that told Harry that Sirius, too, was not very happy with the Headmaster. Harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection for his godfather.
\par \lquote At least you\rquote ve known what\rquote s been going on,\rquote  he said bracingly.
\par \lquote Oh yeah,\rquote  said Sirius sarcastically. \lquote Listening to Snape\rquote s reports, having to take all his snide hints that he\rquote s out there risking his life while I\rquote m sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable t
ime ... asking me how the cleaning\rquote s going \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What cleaning?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,\rquote  said Sirius, waving a hand around the dismal kitchen. \lquote No one\rquote s lived here for ten years, not since my dear mother died, unless you count her old house-elf, and he\rquote 
s gone round the twist \endash  hasn\rquote t cleaned any\-thing in ages.\rquote 
\par \lquote Sirius,\rquote  said Mundungus, who did not appear to have paid any attention to the conversation, but had been minutely examining an empty goblet. \lquote This solid silver, mate?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Sirius, surveying it with distaste. \lquote Finest fifteenth-century goblin-wrought silver, embossed with the Black family crest.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote d come orf, though,\rquote  muttered Mundungus, polishing it with his cuff.
\par \lquote Fred \endash  George \endash  NO, JUST CARRY THEM!\rquote  Mrs Weasley shrieked.
\par Harry, Sirius and Mundungus looked round and, within a split second, they had dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, an i
ron flagon of Butterbeer and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air towards them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface; the flag
on of Butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents everywhere; the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius\rquote s right hand had been seconds before.
\par \lquote FOR HEAVEN\rquote S SAKE!\rquote  screamed Mrs Weasley. \lquote THERE WAS NO NEED \endash  I\rquote VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS \endash  JUST BECAUSE YOU\rquote RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW, YOU DON\rquote 
T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING!\rquote 
\par \lquote We were just trying to save a bit of time!\rquote  said Fred, hurrying forward to wrench the bread knife out of the table. \lquote Sorry, Sirius, mate \endash  didn\rquote t mean to \endash \rquote 
\par Harry and Sirius were both laughing; Mundungus, who had top\-pled backwards off his chair, was swearing as he got to his feet; Crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser, from where his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness.

\par \lquote Boys,\rquote  Mr Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of the table, \lquote your mother\rquote s right, you\rquote re supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you\rquote ve come of age \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote None of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!\rquote  Mrs Weasley raged at the twins as she slammed a fresh flagon of Butterbeer on to the table, and spilling almost as much again. \lquote Bill didn\rquote 
t feel the need to Apparate every few feet! Charlie didn\rquote t charm everything he met! Percy \endash \rquote 
\par She stopped dead, catching her breath with a frightened look at her husband, whose expression was suddenly wooden.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s eat,\rquote  said Bill quickly.
\par \lquote It looks wonderful, Molly,\rquote  said Lupin, ladling stew on to a plate for her and handing it across the table.
\par For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their food. Then Mrs Weasley turned to Sirius.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve been meaning to tell you, Sirius, there\rquote s something trapped in tha
t writing desk in the drawing room, it keeps rattling and shaking. Of course, it could just be a Boggart, but I thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at it before we let it out.\rquote 
\par \lquote Whatever you like,\rquote  said Sirius indifferently.
\par \lquote The curtains in there are full of Doxys, too,\rquote  Mrs Weasley went on. \lquote I thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow.\rquote 
\par \lquote I look forward to it,\rquote  said Sirius. Harry heard the sarcasm in his voice, but he was not sure that anyone else did.
\par Opposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by transforming her nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry\rquote 
s bedroom, her nose swelled to a beak-like protuberance that resembled Snape\rquote s, shrank to the size of a
 button mushroom and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because Hermione and Ginny were soon requesting their favourite noses.
\par \lquote Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks.\rquote 
\par Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impres\-sion that a female Dudley was grinning at him from across the table.
\par Mr Weasley, Bill and Lupin were having an intense discussion about goblins.
\par \lquote They\rquote re not giving anything away yet,\rquote  said Bill. \lquote I still can\rquote t work out whether or not they believe he\rquote s back. Course, they might prefer not to take sides at all. Keep out of it.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m sure they\rquote d never go over to You-Know-Who,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, shaking his head. \lquote They\rquote ve suffered losses too; remember that goblin family he murdered last time, somewhere near Nottingham?\rquote 
\par \lquote I think it depends what they\rquote re offered,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote And I\rquote m not talking about gold. If they\rquote re offered the freedoms we\rquote ve been denying them for centuries they\rquote 
re going to be tempted. Have you still not had any luck with Ragnok, Bill?\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,\rquote  said Bill, \lquote he hasn\rquote t stopped raging about the Bagman business, he reckons the Ministry did a cover-up, those goblins never got their gold from him, you know \endash 
\rquote 
\par A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of Bill\rquote s words. Fred, George, Ron and Mundungus were rolling around in their seats.
\par \lquote ... and then,\rquote  choked Mundungus, tears running down his face, \lquote and then, if you\rquote ll believe it, \rquote e says to me, \rquote e says, \'93\rquote Ere, Dung, where didja get all them toads from? \rquote Cos some son of a Bludger
\rquote s gone and nicked all mine!\'94 And I says, \'93Nicked all your toads, Will, what next? So you\rquote ll be wanting some more, then?\'94 And if you\rquote ll believe me, lads, the gormless gargoyle buys all \rquote 
is own toads back orf me for a lot more\rquote n what \rquote e paid in the first place \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think we need to hear any more of your business deal\-ings, thank you very much, Mundungus,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley sharply, as Ron slumped forwards on to the table, howling with laughter.
\par \lquote Beg pardon, Molly,\rquote  said Mundungus at once, wiping his eyes and winking at Harry. \lquote But, you know, Will nicked \rquote em orf Warty Harris in the first place so I wasn\rquote t really doing nothing wrong.\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know where you learned about right and wrong, Mundungus, but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley coldly.
\par Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of Butterbeer; George was hiccoughing. For some reason, Mrs Weasley threw a very nasty look at Siri
us before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding. Harry looked round at his godfather.
\par \lquote Molly doesn\rquote t approve of Mundungus,\rquote  said Sirius in an under\-tone.
\par \lquote How come he\rquote s in the Order?\rquote  Harry said, very quietly.
\par \lquote He\rquote s useful,\rquote  Sirius muttered. \lquote Knows all the crooks \endash  well, he would, seeing as he\rquote s one himself. But he\rquote 
s also very loyal to Dumbledore, who helped him out of a tight spot once. It pays to have someone like Dung around, he hears things we don\rquote t. But Molly thinks inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far. She hasn\rquote 
t forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you.\rquote 
\par Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on Harry\rquote s jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was saying something as the jeans had once been Dudley\rquote 
s). As he laid down his spoon there was a lull in the general conversation: Mr Weasley was leaning back in his chair, looking replete and relaxed; Tonks was yawning widely, her nose now back to
 normal; and Ginny, who had lured Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on the floor, rolling Butterbeer corks for him to chase.
\par \lquote Nearly time for bed, I think,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley with a yawn.
\par \lquote Not just yet, Molly,\rquote  said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at Harry. \lquote You know, I\rquote m surprised at you. I thought the first thing you\rquote 
d do when you got here would be to start asking questions about Voldemort.\rquote 
\par The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry associated with the arrival of Dementors. Where seconds before it had been sleepily relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. A frisson had gone around the table at the mention of Voldemort\rquote 
s name. Lupin, who had been about to take a sip of wine, lowered his goblet slowly, looking wary.
\par \lquote I did!\rquote  said Harry indignantly. \lquote I asked Ron and Hermione but they said we\rquote re not allowed in the Order, so \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote And they\rquote re quite right,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. \lquote You\rquote re too young.\rquote 
\par She was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists clenched on its arms, every trace of drowsiness gone.
\par \lquote Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to ask questions?\rquote  asked Sirius. \lquote Harry\rquote s been trapped in that Muggle house for a month. He\rquote s got the right to know what\rquote s been happen\emdash \rquote 

\par \lquote Hang on!\rquote  interrupted George loudly.
\par \lquote How come Harry gets his questions answered?\rquote  said Fred angrily.
\par \lquote We\rquote ve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you haven\rquote t told us a single stinking thing!\rquote  said George.

\par \lquote It\rquote s not my fault you haven\rquote t been told what the Order\rquote s doing,\rquote  said Sirius calmly, \lquote that\rquote s your parents\rquote  decision. Harry, on the other hand \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s not down to you to decide what\rquote s good for Harry!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley sharply. The expression on her normally kind face looked dangerous. \lquote You haven\rquote t forgotten what Dumbledore said, I sup\-pose?\rquote 
\par \lquote Which bit?\rquote  Sirius asked politely, but with the air of a man readying himself for a fight.
\par \lquote The bit about not telling Harry more than he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 needs to know,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
said Mrs Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words.
\par Ron, Hermione, Fred and George\rquote s heads swivelled from Sirius to Mrs Weasley as though they were following a tennis rally. Ginny was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned Butterbeer corks, watching the conversation with her mouth slightly open. Lupin
\rquote s eyes were fixed on Sirius.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t intend to tell him more than he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 needs to know, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Molly,

\par \lquote He\rquote s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. \lquote He\rquote s only fifteen and \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote And he\rquote s dealt with as much as most in the Order,\rquote  said Sirius, \lquote and more than some.\rquote 
\par \lquote No one\rquote s denying what he\rquote s done!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, her voice rising, her fists trembling on the arms of her chair. \lquote But he\rquote s still \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s not a child!\rquote  said Sirius impatiently.
\par \lquote He\rquote s not an adult either!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, the colour rising in her cheeks. \lquote He\rquote s not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 James, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote I\rquote m perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,\rquote  said Sirius coldly.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not sure you are!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. \lquote Sometimes, the way you talk about him, it\rquote s as though you think you\rquote ve got your best friend back!\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s wrong with that?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote What\rquote s wrong, Harry, is that you are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
your father, however much you might look like him!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, her eyes still boring into Sirius. \lquote You are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it!\rquote 
\par \lquote Meaning I\rquote m an irresponsible godfather?\rquote  demanded Sirius, his voice rising.
\par \lquote Meaning you have been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why Dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote ll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of this, if you please!\rquote  said Sirius loudly.
\par \lquote Arthur!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, rounding on her husband. \lquote Arthur, back me up!\rquote 
\par Mr Weasley did not speak at once. He took off his glasses and cleaned them slowly on his robes, not looking at his wife. Only when he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he reply.
\par \lquote Dumbledore knows the position has changed, Molly. He accepts that Harry will have to be filled in, to a certain extent, now that he is staying at Headquarters.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, but there\rquote s a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he likes!\rquote 
\par \lquote Personally,\rquote  said Lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius at last, as Mrs Weasley turned quickly to him, hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally, \lquote I think it better that Harry gets the facts \endash 
 not all the facts, Molly, but the general picture \endash  from us, rather than a garbled version from ... others.\rquote 
\par His expression was mild, but Harry felt sure Lupin, at least, knew that some Extendable Ears had survived Mrs Weasley\rquote s purge.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come, \lquote well ... I can see I\rquote m going to be overruled. I\rquote 
ll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has Harry\rquote s best interests at heart \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s not your son,\rquote  said Sirius quietly.
\par \lquote He\rquote s as good as,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley fiercely. \lquote Who else has he got?\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s got me!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, her lip curling, \lquote the thing is, it\rquote s been rather difficult for you to look after him while you\rquote ve been locked up in Azkaban, hasn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par Sirius started to rise from his chair.
\par \lquote Molly, you\rquote re not the only person at this table who cares about Harry,\rquote  said Lupin sharply. \lquote Sirius, sit }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 down.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par Mrs Weasley\rquote s lower lip was trembling. Sirius sank slowly back into his chair, his face white.
\par \lquote I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this,\rquote  Lupin con\-tinued, \lquote he\rquote s old enough to decide for himself.\rquote 
\par \lquote I want to know what\rquote s been going on,\rquote  Harry said at once.
\par He did not look at Mrs Weasley. He had been touched by what she had said about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient with her mollycoddling. Sirius was right, he was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 a child.
\par \lquote Very well,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, her voice cracking. \lquote Ginny \endash  Ron \endash  Hermione \endash  Fred \endash  George \endash  I want you out of this kitchen, now.\rquote 
\par There was instant uproar.

\par \lquote They\rquote re still at school.\rquote 
\par \lquote But they\rquote re legally adults now,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, in the same tired voice.
\par Mrs Weasley was now scarlet in the face.
\par \lquote I \endash  oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but Ron \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Harry\rquote ll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway!\rquote  said Ron hotly. \lquote Won\rquote t \endash  won\rquote t you?\rquote  he added uncertainly, meeting Harry\rquote s eyes.
\par For a split second, Harry considered telling Ron that he wouldn\rquote t tell him a single word, that he could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked it. But the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at each other.
\par \lquote Course I will,\rquote  Harry said.
\par Ron and Hermione beamed.
\par \lquote Fine!\rquote  shouted Mrs Weasley. \lquote Fine! Ginny \endash  BED!\rquote 
\par Ginny did not go quietly. They could hear her raging and storming at her mother all the way up the stairs, and when she reached the hall Mrs Black\rquote 
s ear-splitting shrieks were added to the din. Lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm. It was only after he had returned, closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table again, that Sirius spoke.
\par \lquote OK, Harry ... what do you want to know?\rquote 
\par Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had obsessed him for the last month.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Voldemort?\rquote  he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name. \lquote What\rquote s he doing? I\rquote ve been trying to watch the Muggle news, and there hasn\rquote 
t been anything that looks like him yet, no funny deaths or anything.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s because there haven\rquote t been any funny deaths yet,\rquote  said Sirius, \lquote not as far as we know, anyway ... and we know quite a lot.\rquote 
\par \lquote More than he thinks we do, anyway,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par \lquote How come he\rquote s stopped killing people?\rquote  Harry asked. He knew Voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone.
\par \lquote Because he doesn\rquote t want to draw attention to himself,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote It would be dangerous for him. His comeback didn\rquote t come off quite the way he wanted it to, you see. He messed it up.\rquote 
\par \lquote Or rather, you messed it up for him,\rquote  said Lupin, with a satis\-fied smile.
\par \lquote How?\rquote  Harry asked, perplexed.
\par \lquote You weren\rquote t supposed to survive!\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote Nobody apart from his Death Eaters was supposed to know he\rquote d come back. But you survived to bear witness.\rquote 
\par \lquote And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Dumbledore,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote And you made sure Dumbledore knew at once.\rquote 
\par \lquote How has that helped?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote Are you kidding?\rquote  said Bill incredulously. \lquote Dumbledore was the only one You-Know-Who was ever scared of!\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned,\rquote  said Sirius.
\par \lquote So, what\rquote s the Order been doing?\rquote  said Harry, looking around at them all.
\par \lquote Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort can\rquote t carry out his plans,\rquote  said Sirius.
\par \lquote How d\rquote you know what his plans are?\rquote  Harry asked quickly.
\par \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s got a shrewd idea,\rquote  said Lupin, \lquote and Dumbledore\rquote s shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.\rquote 
\par \lquote So what does Dumbledore reckon he\rquote s planning?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote In the old days he had huge numbers at his command: witches and wizards he\rquote 
d bullied or bewitched into following him, his faithful Death Eaters, a great variety of Dark creatures. You heard him plan\-ning to recruit the giants; well, they\rquote ll be just one of the groups he\rquote s after. He\rquote 
s certainly not going to try and take on the Ministry of Magic with only a dozen Death Eaters.\rquote 
\par \lquote So you\rquote re trying to stop him getting more followers?\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re doing our best,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par \lquote How?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that You-Know-Who really has returned, to put them on their guard,\rquote  said Bill. \lquote It\rquote s proving tricky, though.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because of the Ministry\rquote s attitude,\rquote  said Tonks. \lquote You saw Cornelius Fudge after You-Know-Who came back, Harry. Well, he hasn\rquote t shifted his position at all. He\rquote s absolutely refusing to believe it\rquote 
s happened.\rquote 
\par \lquote But why?\rquote  said Harry desperately. \lquote Why\rquote s he being so stupid? If Dumbledore \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, well, you\rquote ve put your finger on the problem,\rquote  said Mr Weasley with a wry smile. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Dumbledore.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote Fudge is frightened of him, you see,\rquote  said Tonks sadly.
\par \lquote Frightened of Dumbledore?\rquote  said Harry incredulously.
\par \lquote Frightened of what he\rquote s up to,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote Fudge thinks Dumbledore\rquote s plotting to overthrow him. He thinks Dumbledore wants to be Minister for Magic.\rquote 
\par \lquote But Dumbledore doesn\rquote t want \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Of course he doesn\rquote t,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote He\rquote s never wanted the Minister\rquote s job, even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when Millicent Bagnold retired. Fudge came to power instead, but he\rquote 
s never quite forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore had, even though Dumbledore never applied for the job.\rquote 
\par \lquote Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore\rquote s much cleverer than he is, a much more powerful wizard, and in the early days of his Ministry he was forever asking Dumbledore for help and advice,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote But it seems he\rquote 
s become fond of power, and much more confident. He loves being Minister for Magic and he\rquote s man\-aged to convince himself that he\rquote s the clever one and Dumbledore\rquote s simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it.\rquote

\par \lquote Because accepting that Voldemort\rquote s back would mean trouble like the Ministry hasn\rquote t had to cope with for nearly fourteen years,\rquote  said Sirius bitterly. \lquote Fudge just can\rquote t bring himself to face it. It\rquote 
s so much more comfortable to convince himself Dumbledore\rquote s lying to destabilise him.\rquote 
\par \lquote You see the problem,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote While the Ministry insists there is nothing to fear from Voldemort it\rquote s hard to convince people he\rquote s back, especially as they really don\rquote 
t want to believe it in the first place. What\rquote s more, the Ministry\rquote s leaning heavily on the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 not to report any of what they\rquote re calling Dumbledore\rquote s rumour-mongering, so most of the wizarding community are com\-pletely unaware anything\rquote 
s happened, and that makes them easy targets for the Death Eaters if they\rquote re using the Imperius Curse.\rquote 
\par \lquote But you\rquote re telling people, aren\rquote t you?\rquote  said Harry, looking around at Mr Weasley, Sirius, Bill, Mundungus, Lupin and Tonks. \lquote You\rquote re letting people know he\rquote s back?\rquote 
\par They all smiled humourlessly.
\par \lquote Well, as everyone thinks I\rquote m a mad mass-murderer and the Ministry\rquote s put a ten thousand Galleon price on my head, I can hardly stroll up the street and start handing out leaflets, can I?\rquote  said Sirius restlessly.
\par \lquote And I\rquote m not a very popular dinner guest with most of the com\-munity,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote It\rquote s an occupational hazard of being a were\-wolf.\rquote 
\par \lquote Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they started shooting their mouths off,\rquote  said Sirius, \lquote and it\rquote s very important for us to have spies inside the Ministry, because you can bet Voldemort will have them.
\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote ve managed to convince a couple of people, though,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. Tonks here, for one \endash  she\rquote s too young to have been in the Order of the Phoenix last time, and having Aurors on our side is a huge advantage 
\endash  Kingsley Shacklebolt\rquote s been a real asset, too; he\rquote s in charge of the hunt for Sirius, so he\rquote s been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in Tibet.\rquote 
\par \lquote But if none of you are putting the news out that Voldemort\rquote s back \endash \rquote  Harry began.
\par \lquote Who said none of us are putting the news out?\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote Why d\rquote you think Dumbledore\rquote s in such trouble?\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote They\rquote re trying to discredit him,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote Didn\rquote t you see the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 last week? They reported that he\rquote d been voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because he\rquote s getting old and losing his grip, but it\rquote 
s not true; he was voted out by Ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing Voldemort\rquote s return. They\rquote ve demoted him from Chief Warlock on the Wizengamot \endash  that\rquote s the Wizard High Court \endash  and they\rquote 
re talking about taking away his Order of Merlin, First Class, too.\rquote 
\par \lquote But Dumbledore says he doesn\rquote t care what they do as long as they don\rquote t take him off the Chocolate Frog Cards,\rquote  said Bill, grinning.
\par \lquote It\rquote s no laughing matter,\rquote  said Mr Weasley sharply. \lquote If he carries on defying the Ministry like this he could end up in Azkaban, and the last thing we want is to have Dumbledore locked up. While You-Know-Who knows Dumbledore
\rquote s out there and wise to what he\rquote s up to he\rquote s going to go cautiously. If Dumbledore\rquote s out of the way \endash  well, You-Know-Who will have a clear field.\rquote 
\par \lquote But if Voldemort\rquote s trying to recruit more Death Eaters it\rquote s bound to get out that he\rquote s come back, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  asked Harry desperately.
\par Voldemort doesn\rquote t march up to people\rquote s houses and bang on their front doors, Harry,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote He tricks, jinxes and black\-mails them. He\rquote 
s well-practised at operating in secret. In any case, gathering followers is only one thing he\rquote s interested in. He\rquote s got other plans too, plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed, and he\rquote 
s concentrating on those for the moment.\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s he after apart from followers?\rquote  Harry asked swiftly. He thought he saw Sirius and Lupin exchange the most fleeting of looks before Sirius answered.
\par \lquote Stuff he can only get by stealth.\rquote 
\par When Harry continued to look puzzled, Sirius said, \lquote Like a weapon. Something he didn\rquote t have last time.\rquote 
\par \lquote When he was powerful before?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes.\rquote 
\par \lquote Like what kind of weapon?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Something worse than the Avada Kedavra \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s enough!\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door. Harry hadn\rquote t noticed her return from taking Ginny upstairs. Her arms were crossed and she looked furious.
\par \lquote I want you in bed, now. All of you,\rquote  she added, looking around at Fred, George, Ron and Hermione.
\par \lquote You can\rquote t boss us \endash \rquote  Fred began.
\par \lquote Watch me,\rquote  snarled Mrs Weasley. She was trembling slightly as she looked at Sirius. \lquote You\rquote ve given Harry plenty of information. Any more and you might just as well induct him into the Order straightaway.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why not?\rquote  said Harry quickly. \lquote I\rquote ll join, I want to join, I want to fight.\rquote 
\par \lquote No.\rquote 
\par It was not Mrs Weasley who spoke this time, but Lupin.
\par \lquote The Order is comprised only of overage wizards,\rquote  he said. \lquote Wizards who have left school,\rquote  he added, as Fred and George opened their mouths. \lquote 
There are dangers involved of which you can have no idea, any of you ... I think Molly\rquote s right, Sirius. We\rquote ve said enough.\rquote 
\par Sirius half-shrugged but did not argue. Mrs Weasley beckoned imperiously to her sons and Hermione. One by one they stood up and Harry, recognising defeat, followed suit.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote \rquote Night,\rquote  Harry and Ron said to the twins.
\par \lquote Sleep tight,\rquote  said Fred, winking.
\par Mrs Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a sharp snap. The bedroom looked, if anything, even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight. The blank picture 
on the wall was now breathing very slowly and deeply, as though its invisible occupant was asleep. Harry put on his pyjamas, took off his glasses and climbed into his chilly bed while Ron threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify Hedwig and Pig
widgeon, who were clat\-tering around and rustling their wings restlessly.
\par \lquote We can\rquote t let them out to hunt every night,\rquote  Ron explained as he pulled on his maroon pyjamas. \lquote Dumbledore doesn\rquote t want too many owls swooping around the square, thinks it\rquote ll look suspi\-

\par \lquote What\rquote re you doing that for?\rquote 
\par \lquote Kreacher,\rquote  said Ron as he turned off the light. \lquote First night I was here he came wandering in at three in the morning. Trust me, you don\rquote t want to wake up and find him prowling around your room. Anyway ...\rquote

\par Harry saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George leaping down from Ron\rquote s bed. There was a groan of bedsprings and Harry\rquote s mattress descended a few inches as George sat down near his feet.
\par \lquote So, got there yet?\rquote  said George eagerly.
\par \lquote The weapon Sirius mentioned?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Let slip, more like,\rquote  said Fred with relish, now sitting next to Ron. \lquote We didn\rquote t hear about }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Maybe it\rquote s something that can kill loads of people at once,\rquote  sug\-gested George.
\par \lquote Maybe it\rquote s some particularly painful way of killing people,\rquote  said Ron fearfully.
\par \lquote He\rquote s got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote he doesn\rquote t need anything more efficient than that.\rquote 
\par There was a pause and Harry knew that the others, like him, were wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate.
\par \lquote So who d\rquote you think\rquote s got it now?\rquote  asked George.
\par \lquote I hope it\rquote s our side,\rquote  said Ron, sounding slightly nervous.
\par \lquote If it is, Dumbledore\rquote s probably keeping it,\rquote  said Fred.

\par \lquote A weapon\rquote s going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, though!\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Not necessarily,\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote Yeah, size is no guarantee of power,\rquote  said George. \lquote Look at Ginny.\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey Hexes, have you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Shhh!\rquote  said Fred, half-rising from the bed. \lquote Listen!\rquote 
\par They fell silent. Footsteps were coming up the stairs.
\par \lquote Mum,\rquote  said George and without further ado there was a loud }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 crack }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
and Harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed. A few seconds later, they heard the floorboard creak outside their door; Mrs Weasley was plainly listening to check whether or not they were talking.
\par Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully. The floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and George.
\par \lquote She doesn\rquote t trust us at all, you know,\rquote  said Ron regretfully.
\par Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had been so packed with things to think abo
ut that he fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over. He wanted to continue talking to Ron, but Mrs Weasley was now creaking back downstairs again, and once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs ... in fact, man
y-legged creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door, and Hagrid the Care of Magical Creatures teacher was saying, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Beauties, aren

\par The next thing he knew, he was curled into a warm ball under his bedclothes and George\rquote s loud voice was filling the room.
\par \lquote Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs you in the drawing room, there are loads more Doxys than she thought and she\rquote s found a nest of dead Puffskeins under the sofa.\rquote 
\par Half an hour later Harry and Ron, who had dressed and break\-fasted quickly, entered the drawing room, a long, high-ceilinged room on the first floor with olive green walls covered in dirty tap\-
estries. The carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long, moss green velvet curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible bees. It was aro
und these that Mrs Weasley, Hermione, Ginny, Fred and George were grouped, all looking rather peculiar as they had each tied a cloth over their nose and mouth. Each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the end.
\par \lquote Cover your faces and take a spray,\rquote  Mrs Weasley said to Harry and Ron the moment she saw them, pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a spindle-legged table. \lquote It\rquote s Doxycide. I\rquote

\par \lquote Kreacher\rquote s really old, he probably couldn\rquote t manage \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote d be surprised what Kreacher can manage when he wants to, Hermione,\rquote  said Sirius, who had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats. \lquote I\rquote ve just been feeding Buckbeak,\rquote 
 he added, in reply to Harry\rquote s enquiring look. \lquote I keep him upstairs in my mother\rquote s bedroom. Anyway ... this writing desk ...\rquote 
\par He dropped the bag of rats into an armchair, then bent over to examine the locked cabinet which, Harry now noticed for the first time, was shaking slightly.
\par \lquote Well, Molly, I\rquote m pretty sure this is a Boggart,\rquote  said Sirius, peering through the keyhole, \lquote but perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a shufti at it before we let it out \endash 
 knowing my mother, it could be something much worse.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right you are, Sirius,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley.
\par They were both speaking in carefully light, polite voices that told Harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagree\-ment of the night before.
\par A loud, clanging bell sounded from downstairs, followed at once by the cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night by Tonks knocking over the umbrella stand.
\par \lquote I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!\rquote  said Sirius exas\-peratedly, hurrying out of the room. They heard him thundering down the stairs as Mrs Black\rquote s screeches echoed up through the house once more:

\par \lquote Close the door, please, Harry,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley.
\par Harry took as much time as he dared to close the drawing-room door; he wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs. Sirius had obviously managed to shut the curtains over his mother\rquote s por\-
trait because she had stopped screaming. He heard Sirius walking down the hall, then the clattering of the chain on the front door, and then a deep voice he recognised as Kingsley Shacklebolt\rquote s saying, \lquote Hestia\rquote 
s just relieved me, so she\rquote s got Moody\rquote s Cloak now, thought I\rquote d leave a report for Dumbledore ...\rquote 
\par Feeling Mrs Weasley\rquote s eyes on the back of his head, Harry regret\-fully closed the drawing-room door and rejoined the Doxy party.
\par Mrs Weasley was bending over to check the page on Doxys in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Gilderoy Lockhart\rquote s Guide to Household Pests, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because Doxys bite and their teeth are poisonous. I\rquote ve got a bottle of antidote here, but I\rquote d rather nobody needed it.\rquote 
\par She straightened up, positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains and beckoned them all forward.
\par \lquote When I say the word, start spraying immediately,\rquote  she said. \lquote They\rquote ll come flying out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyse them. When they\rquote 
re immobilised, just throw them in this bucket.\rquote 
\par She stepped carefully out of their line of fire, and raised her own spray.
\par \lquote All right \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 squirt!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fully-grown Doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material, shiny beetle-like wings whirring, tiny needle-sharp teeth bared, its fairy-like body covered with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenc
hed with fury. Harry caught it full in the face with a blast of Doxycide. It froze in midair and fell, with a surprisingly loud }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 thunk, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 on to the worn carpet below. Harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket.
\par \lquote Fred, what are you doing?\rquote  said Mrs Weasley sharply. \lquote Spray that at once and throw it away!\rquote 
\par Harry looked round. Fred was holding a struggling Doxy between his forefinger and thumb.
\par \lquote Right-o,\rquote  Fred said brightly, spraying the Doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted, but the moment Mrs Weasley\rquote s back was turned he pocketed it with a wink.
\par \lquote We want to experiment with Doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes,\rquote  George told Harry under his breath.
\par Deftly spraying two Doxys at once as they soared straight for his nose, Harry moved closer to George and muttered out of the corner of his mouth, \lquote What are Skiving Snackboxes?\rquote 
\par \lquote Range of sweets to make you ill,\rquote  George whispered, keeping a wary eye on Mrs Weasley\rquote s back. \lquote Not seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. Fr

But they still need a bit of work. At the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping themselves puking long enough to swallow the purple end.\rquote

\par Har
ry grinned. He had forced the Weasley twins to take the thousand Galleons prize money he had won in the Triwizard Tournament to help them realise their ambition to open a joke shop, but he was still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was
 unknown to Mrs Weasley. She did not think running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons.
\par The de-Doxying of the curtains took most of the morning. It was past midday when Mrs Weasley finally removed her protec\-tive scarf, sank into a sagging
 armchair and sprang up again with a cry of disgust, having sat on the bag of dead rats. The curtains were no longer buzzing; they hung limp and damp from the inten\-
sive spraying. At the foot of them unconscious Doxys lay crammed in the bucket beside a bowl of their black eggs, at which Crook\-shanks was now sniffing and Fred and George were shooting covetous looks.
\par \lquote I think we\rquote ll tackle }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 those}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148  after lunch.\rquote 
 Mrs Weasley pointed at the dusty glass-fronted cabinets standing on either side of the mantelpiece. Th
ey were crammed with an odd assortment of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages Harry could not understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with a 
large opal set into the stopper, full of what Harry was quite sure was blood.
\par The clanging doorbell rang again. Everyone looked at Mrs Weasley.
\par \lquote Stay here,\rquote  she said firmly, snatching up the bag of rats as Mrs Black\rquote s screeches started up again from down below. \lquote I\rquote ll bring up some sandwiches.\rquote 
\par She left the room, closing the door carefully behind her. At once, everyone dashed over to the window to look down on the doorstep. They could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of precariously balanced cauldrons.
\par \lquote Mundungus!\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote What\rquote s he brought all those caul\-drons for?\rquote 
\par \lquote Probably looking for a safe place to keep them,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Isn\rquote t that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me? Picking up dodgy cauldrons?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, you\rquote re right!\rquote  said Fred, as the front door opened; Mun\-dungus heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view. \lquote Blimey, Mum won\rquote t like that ...\rquote 
\par He and George crossed to the door and stood beside it, listening intently. Mrs Black\rquote s screaming had stopped.
\par \lquote Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,\rquote  Fred muttered, frowning with concentration. \lquote Can\rquote t hear properly ... d\rquote you reckon we can risk the Extendable Ears?\rquote 
\par \lquote Might be worth it,\rquote  said George. \lquote I could sneak upstairs and get a pair \endash \rquote 
\par But at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from downstairs that rendered Extendable Ears quite unnecessary. All of them could hear exactly what Mrs Weasley was shouting at the top of her voice.
\par \lquote WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN GOODS!\rquote 
\par \lquote I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,\rquote  said Fred, with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow Mrs Weasley\rquote s voice to permeate the room better, \lquote it makes such a nice change.\rquote 

\par \lquote \endash  COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVEN\rquote T GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote The idiots are letting her get into her stride,\rquote  said George, shaking his head. \lquote You\rquote ve got to head her off early otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours. And she\rquote 
s been dying to have a go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you, Harry \endash  and there goes Sirius\rquote s mum again.\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley\rquote s voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hall.
\par George made to shut the door to drown the noise, but before he could do so, a house-elf edged into the room.
\par Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was completely naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several
 times too big for it and, though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its eyes were a bloodshot and watery grey and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike.
\par The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. Acting as though it could not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, towards the far end of the room, all the while mut\-
tering under its breath in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrog\rquote s.
\par \lquote ... smells like a drain and a criminal to boot, but she\rquote s no better, nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my mistress\rquote s house, oh, my poor mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum they\rquote 
ve let into her house, what would she say to old Kreacher, oh, the shame of it, Mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves, poor old Kreacher, what can he do ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Hello, Kreacher,\rquote  said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a snap.
\par The house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, and gave a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise.
\par \lquote Kreacher did not see young master,\rquote  he said, turning around and bowing to Fred. Still facing the carpet, he added, perfectly audibly, \lquote Nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is.\rquote 
\par \lquote Sorry?\rquote  said George. \lquote Didn\rquote t catch that last bit.\rquote 
\par \lquote Kreacher said nothing,\rquote  said the elf, with a second bow to George, adding in a clear undertone, \lquote and there\rquote s its twin, unnatural little beasts they are.\rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t know whether to laugh or not. The elf straight\-ened up, eyeing them all malevolently, and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter.
\par \lquote ... and there\rquote s the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh, if my mistress knew, oh, how she\rquote d cry, and there\rquote s a new boy, Kreacher doesn\rquote t know his name. What is he doing here? Kreacher doesn\rquote t know ...
\rquote 
\par \lquote This is Harry, Kreacher,\rquote  said Hermione tentatively. \lquote Harry Potter.\rquote 
\par Kreacher\rquote s pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever.
\par \lquote The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if Kreacher\rquote s mistress saw him in such company, oh, what would she say \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t call her a Mudblood!\rquote  said Ron and Ginny together, very angrily.
\par \lquote It doesn\rquote t matter,\rquote  Hermione whispered, \lquote he\rquote s not in his right mind, he doesn\rquote t know what he\rquote s \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t kid yourself, Hermione, he knows }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 exactly }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 what he\rquote 
s saying,\rquote  said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike.
\par Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry.
\par \lquote Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true, that\rquote s the boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher won\-ders how he did it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t we all, Kreacher,\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote What do you want, anyway?\rquote  George asked.
\par Kreacher\rquote s huge eyes darted towards George.
\par \lquote Kreacher is cleaning,\rquote  he said evasively.
\par \lquote A likely story,\rquote  said a voice behind Harry.
\par Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the doorway. The noise in the hall had abated; p
erhaps Mrs Weasley and Mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen. At the sight of Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor.
\par \lquote Stand up straight,\rquote  said Sirius impatiently. \lquote Now, what are you up to?\rquote 
\par \lquote Kreacher is cleaning,\rquote  the elf repeated. \lquote Kreacher lives to serve the Noble House of Black \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote And it\rquote s getting blacker every day, it\rquote s filthy,\rquote  said Sirius.
\par \lquote Master always liked his little joke,\rquote  said Kreacher, bowing again, and continuing in an undertone, \lquote Master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his mother\rquote s heart \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote My mother didn\rquote t have a heart, Kreacher,\rquote  snapped Sirius. \lquote She kept herself alive out of pure spite.\rquote 
\par Kreacher bowed again as he spoke.
\par \lquote Whatever Master says,\rquote  he muttered furiously. \lquote Master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother\rquote s boots, oh, my poor mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher serving him, how she hated him, what a disappointment he was 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I asked you what you were up to,\rquote  said Sirius coldly. \lquote Every time you show up pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to your room so we can\rquote t throw it out.\rquote 
\par \lquote Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master\rquote s house,\rquote  said the elf, then muttered very fast, \lquote Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven cen\-turies it\rquote 
s been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I thought it might be that,\rquote  said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall. \lquote She\rquote ll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it, I don\rquote 
t doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will. Now go away, Kreacher.\rquote 
\par It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order; nevertheless, the look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was full of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room.
\par \lquote \endash  comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around, oh, my poor mistress, what would she say if she saw the house now, scum living in it, her treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers and he\rquote s back, they say he\rquote 
s a murderer too \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Keep muttering and I will be a murderer!\rquote  said Sirius irritably as he slammed the door shut on the elf.
\par \lquote Sirius, he\rquote s not right in the head,\rquote  Hermione pleaded, \lquote I don\rquote t think he realises we can hear him.\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s been alone too long,\rquote  said Sirius, \lquote taking mad orders from my mother\rquote s portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul little \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote If you could just set him free,\rquote  said Hermione hopefully, \lquote maybe \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We can\rquote t set him free, he knows too much about the Order,\rquote  said Sirius curtly. \lquote And anyway, the shock would kill him. You sug\-gest to him that he leaves this house, see how he takes it.\rquote 
\par Sirius walked across the room to where the tapestry Kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length of the wall. Harry and the others followed.
\par The tapestry looked immensely old; it was faded and looked as though Doxys had gnawed it in places. Nevertheless, the golden thread with which it was em
broidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back (as far as Harry could tell) to the Middle Ages. Large words at the very top of the tapestry read:

 said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred hole in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn. \lquote My sweet old mother blasted me off after I ran away from home \endash  Kreacher\rquote s quite fond of muttering the story under his breath.
\rquote 
\par \lquote You ran away from home?\rquote 
\par \lquote When I was about sixteen,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote I\rquote d had enough.\rquote 
\par \lquote Where did you go?\rquote  asked Harry, staring at him.
\par \lquote Your dad\rquote s place,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote Your grandparents were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out at your dad\rquote 
s in the school holidays, and when I was seventeen I got a place of my own. My Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold \endash  he\rquote s been wiped off here, too, that\rquote s prob\-ably why \endash 
 anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr and Mrs Potter\rquote s for Sunday lunch, though.\rquote 
\par \lquote But ... why did you ...?\rquote 
\par \lquote Leave?\rquote  Sirius smiled bitterly and ran his fingers through his long, unkempt hair. \lquote Because I h
ated the whole lot of them: my parents, with their pure-blood mania, convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal ... my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them ... that\rquote s him.\rquote 
\par Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, at the name \lquote Regulus Black\rquote . A date of death (some fifteen years previously) fol\-lowed the date of birth.
\par \lquote He was younger than me,\rquote  said Sirius, \lquote and a much better son, as I was constantly reminded.\rquote 
\par \lquote But he died,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote Stupid idiot ... he joined the Death Eaters.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re kidding!\rquote 
\par \lquote Come on, Harry, haven\rquote t you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizards my family were?\rquote  said Sirius testily.
\par \lquote Were \endash  were your parents Death Eaters as well?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right idea, they were all for the purification of the wizarding race, get\-ting rid of Muggle-borns and having pure-bloods in charge. They weren\rquote 
t alone, either, there were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed his true colours, who
 thought he had the right idea about things ... they got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power, though. But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first.\rquote 
\par \lquote Was he killed by an Auror?\rquote  Harry asked tentatively.
\par \lquote Oh, no,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote No, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on Voldemort\rquote s orders, more likely; I doubt Regulus was ever impor\-
tant enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out after he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you don\rquote t just hand in your resignation to Voldemort. It\rquote 
s a lifetime of service or death.\rquote 
\par \lquote Lunch,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley\rquote s voice.
\par She was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a 
huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip. She was very red in the face and still looked angry. The others moved over to her, eager for some food, but Harry remained with Sirius, who had bent closer to the tapestry.
\par \lquote I haven\rquote t looked at this for years. There\rquote s Phineas Nigellus ... my great-great-grandfather, see? ... least popular Headmaster Hogwarts ever had ... and Araminta Meliflua ... cousin of my mother\rquote 
s ... tried to force through a Ministry Bill to make Muggle-hunting legal ... and dear Au
nt Elladora ... she started the family tradition of beheading house-elves when they got too old to carry tea trays ... of course, any time the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned. I see Tonks isn\rquote t on here. Maybe that\rquote 
s why Kreacher won\rquote t take orders from her \endash  he\rquote s sup\-posed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You and Tonks are related?\rquote  Harry asked, surprised.
\par \lquote Oh, yeah, her mother Andromeda was my favourite cousin,\rquote  said Sirius, examining the tapestry carefully. \lquote No, Andromeda\rquote s not on here either, look \endash \rquote 
\par He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names, Bellatrix and Narcissa.
\par \lquote Andromeda\rquote s sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so \endash \rquote 
\par Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly. Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of Andromeda\rquote s burn mark. A double line of gold embroidery linked Narcissa Black with Luc
ius Malfoy and a single vertical gold line from their names led to the name Draco.
\par \lquote You\rquote re related to the Malfoys!\rquote 
\par \lquote The pure-blood families are all interrelated,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote If you\rquote 
re only going to let your sons and daughters marry pure-bloods your choice is very limited; there are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are cousins by marriage and Arthur\rquote s something like my second cousin once removed. But there\rquote 
s no point looking for them on here \endash  if ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors it\rquote s the Weasleys.\rquote 
\par But Harry was now looking at the name to the left of Andromeda\rquote s burn: Bellatrix Black, which was connected by a double line to Rodolphus Lestrange.
\par \lquote Lestrange ...\rquote  Harry said aloud. The name had stirred some\-thing in his memory; he knew it from somewhere, but for a moment he couldn\rquote t think where, though it gave him an odd, creeping sensation in the pit of his stomach.
\par \lquote They\rquote re in Azkaban,\rquote  said Sirius shortly.
\par Harry looked at him curiously.
\par \lquote Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch junior,\rquote  said Sirius, in the same brusque voice. \lquote Rodolphus\rquote s brother Rabastan was with them, too.\rquote 
\par Then Harry remembered. He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside Dumbledore\rquote s Pensi
eve, the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes, who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to Lord Voldemort, her pride that she had tried to find him after his dow
nfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty.
\par \lquote You never said she was your \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Does it matter if she\rquote s my cousin?\rquote  snapped Sirius. \lquote As far as I\rquote m concerned, they\rquote re not my family. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 She\rquote s }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 certainly not my family. I haven\rquote t seen her since I was your age, unless you count a glimpse of her coming into Azkaban. D\rquote you think I\rquote 
m proud of having a relative like her?\rquote 
\par \lquote Sorry,\rquote  said Harry quickly, \lquote I didn\rquote t mean \endash  I was just surprised, that\rquote s all \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It doesn\rquote t matter, don\rquote t apologise,\rquote  Sirius mumbled. He turned away from the tapestry, his hands deep in his pockets. \lquote I don\rquote t like being back here,\rquote  he said, staring across the drawing room. \lquote 
I never thought I\rquote d be stuck in this house again.\rquote 
\par Harry understood completely. He knew how he would feel, when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place for ever, to return and live at number four, Privet Drive.
\par \lquote It\rquote s ideal for Headquarters, of course,\rquote  Sirius said. \lquote My father put every security measure known to wizardkind on it when he lived here. It\rquote s unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call \endash  as if they
\rquote d ever have wanted to \endash  and now Dumbledore\rquote s added his pro\-tection, you\rquote d be hard put to find a safer house anywhere. Dumbledore is Secret Keeper for the Order, you know \endash  nobody can
 find Headquarters unless he tells them personally where it is \endash  that note Moody showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore ...\rquote  Sirius gave a short, bark-like laugh. \lquote 
If my parents could see the use their house was being put to now ... well, my mother\rquote s portrait should give you some idea ...\rquote 
\par He scowled for a moment, then sighed.
\par \lquote I wouldn\rquote t mind if I could just get out occasionally and do something useful. I\rquote ve asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your hearing \endash  as Snuffles, obviously \endash  so I can give you a bit of moral support, what d
\rquote you think?\rquote 
\par Harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet. He had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening; in the excitement of being back with the people he like
d best, and hearing everything that was going on, it had completely flown his mind. At Sirius\rquote 
s words, however, the crushing sense of dread returned to him. He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t worry,\rquote  Sirius said. Harry looked up and realised that Sirius had been watching him. \lquote I\rquote m sure they\rquote ll clear you, there\rquote 
s definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life.\rquote 
\par \lquote But if they do expel me,\rquote  said Harry quietly, \lquote can I come back here and live with you?\rquote 
\par Sirius smiled sadly.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll see.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote d feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn\rquote t have to go back to the Dursleys\rquote ,\rquote  Harry pressed him.
\par \lquote They must be bad if you prefer this place,\rquote  said Sirius gloomily.
\par \lquote Hurry up, you two, or there won\rquote t be any food left,\rquote  Mrs Weasley called.
\par Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at the tap\-estry, then he and Harry went to join the others.
\par Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while they emptied the glass-fronted cabinets that afternoon. Fortunately for him, it was a job that required a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctan
t to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox; within seconds his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove.
\par \lquote It\rquote s OK,\rquote  he said, examining the hand with interest before tap\-ping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal, \lquote must be Wartcap powder in there.\rquote 
\par He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already Doxy-filled pocket.
\par They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry\rquote s arm like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin. 
Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Nature\rquote s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy, until 
Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; a heavy locket that none of them could open; a number of ancient seals; and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius\rquote s grandfather for \lquote 
services to the Ministry\rquote .
\par \lquote It means he gave them a load of gold,\rquote  said Sirius contemptu\-ously, throwing the medal into the rubbish sack.
\par Several times Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses every time they caught him at it. When Sirius wrested a large golden ring bearing the Black crest from his grip, Kreacher actu
\-ally burst into furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling Sirius names Harry had never heard before.

The drawing room took three days to decontaminate. Finally, the only undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree, which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall, and the rattling writing desk. Moody had not dropp
ed by Headquarters yet, so they could not be sure what was inside it.
\par They moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor where they found spiders as large as saucers lurking in the dresser (Ron left the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea
 and did not return for an hour and a half). The china, which bore the Black crest and motto, was all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by Sirius, and the same fate met a set of old photographs in tarnished silver frames, all of whose occupants squealed 
shrilly as the glass covering them smashed.
\par Snape might refer to their work as \lquote cleaning\rquote , but in Harry\rquote s opinion they were really waging war on the house, which was put\-ting up a very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher. The house-elf kept appearing 
wherever they were congregated, his mut\-tering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks. Sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said, 
\lquote Master must do as Master wishes,\rquote  before turning away and muttering very loudly, \lquote 
but Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he is plotting against the Dark Lord, yes, with these Mudbloods and traitors and scum ...\rquote 
\par At which Sirius, ignoring Hermione\rquote s protests, seized Kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room.
\par The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the cue for Sirius\rquote s mother to start shrieking again, and for Harry 
and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on the visitor, though they gleaned very little from the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to sneak before Mrs Weasley recalled them to their tasks. Snape flitted in and out of the house seve
ral times more, though to Harry\rquote 
s relief they never came face to face; Harry also caught sight of his Transfiguration teacher Professor McGonagall, looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, and she also seemed too busy to linger. Sometimes, however, the 
visitors stayed to help. Tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for th
e Order, helped them repair a grand\-father clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at passers-by. Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in Mrs Weasley\rquote 
s eyes by rescuing Ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe.
\par Despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly, still having dreams about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle, Harry was managing to have fun for the first time all summer. As long 
as he was busy he was happy; when the action abated, how\-
ever, whenever he dropped his guard, or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling, the thought of the looming Ministry hearing returned to him. Fear jabbed at his insides 
like needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled. The idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to Ron and Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his 
direction, followed his lead in not mentioning it. Sometimes, he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the Dursleys\rquote 
 ... but he would not go. He was deter\-mined on that. He would come back here to Grimmauld Place and live with Sirius.
\par He felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when Mrs Weasley turned to him during dinner on Wednesday evening and said quietly, \lquote I\rquote ve ironed your best clothes for tomorrow 
morning, Harry, and I want you to wash your hair tonight, too. A good first impression can work wonders.\rquote 
\par Ron, Hermione, Fred, George and Ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him. Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chop, but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew.
\par \lquote How am I getting there?\rquote  he asked Mrs Weasley, trying to sound unconcerned.
\par \lquote Arthur\rquote s taking you to work with him,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley gently.
\par Mr Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table.
\par \lquote You can wait in my office until it\rquote s time for the hearing,\rquote  he said.
\par Harry looked over at Sirius, but before he could ask the ques\-tion, Mrs Weasley had answered it.
\par \lquote Professor Dumbledore doesn\rquote t think it\rquote s a good idea for Sirius to go with you, and I must say I \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  think he\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 quite right,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par Mrs Weasley pursed her lips.
\par \lquote When did Dumbledore tell you that?\rquote  Harry said, staring at Sirius.
\par \lquote He came last night, when you were in bed,\rquote  said Mr Weasley.
\par Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork. Harry lowered his own eyes to his plate. The thought that Dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel, if it were possible, even worse.}{\rtlch\fcs1

Harry awoke at half past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the disciplinary hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it,
 he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses. Mrs Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on the wall sniggered.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide 
open, fast asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out on to the landing and closed the door softly behind him. Trying not to think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walke
d quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreacher\rquote s ancestors, and down into the kitchen.
\par He had expected it to be empty, but when he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side. He pushed it open and saw Mr and Mrs Weasley, Sirius, Lupin and Tonks sit\-
ting there almost as though they were waiting for him. All were fully dressed except Mrs Weasley, who was wearing a quilted purple dressing gown. She leapt to her feet the moment Harry entered.
\par \lquote Breakfast,\rquote  she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire.
\par \lquote M \endash  m \endash  morning, Harry,\rquote  yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and curly this morning. \lquote Sleep all right?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve b \endash  b \endash  been up all night,\rquote  she said, with another shuddering yawn. \lquote Come and sit down ...\rquote 
\par She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it in the process.
\par \lquote What do you want, Harry?\rquote  Mrs Weasley called. \lquote Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?\rquote 
\par \lquote Just \endash  just toast, thanks,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, \lquote What were you saying about Scrimgeour?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh ... yeah ... well, we need to be a bit more careful, he\rquote s been asking Kingsley and me funny questions ...\rquote 
\par Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation. His insides wer
e squirming. Mrs Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs Weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out
 the creases across his shoulders. He wished she wouldn\rquote t.
\par \lquote ... and I\rquote ll have to tell Dumbledore I can\rquote t do night duty tomorrow, I\rquote m just t \endash  t \endash  too tired,\rquote  Tonks finished, yawning hugely again.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll cover for you,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote I\rquote m OK, I\rquote ve got a report to finish anyway ...\rquote 
\par Mr Weasley was not wearing wizards\rquote  robes but a pair of pin\-striped trousers and an old bomber jacket. He turned from Tonks to Harry.
\par \lquote How are you feeling?\rquote 
\par Harry shrugged.
\par \lquote It\rquote ll all be over soon,\rquote  Mr Weasley said bracingly. \lquote In a few hours\rquote  time you\rquote ll be cleared.\rquote 
\par Harry said nothing.
\par \lquote The hearing\rquote s on my floor, in Amelia Bones\rquote s office. She\rquote s Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and the one who\rquote ll be questioning you.\rquote 
\par \lquote Amelia Bones is OK, Harry,\rquote  said Tonks earnestly. \lquote She\rquote s fair, she\rquote ll hear you out.\rquote 
\par Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t lose your temper,\rquote  said Sirius abruptly. \lquote Be polite and stick to the facts.\rquote 
\par Harry nodded again.
\par \lquote The law\rquote s on your side,\rquote  said Lupin quietly. \lquote Even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations.\rquote 
\par Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry\rquote s neck; for a moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm on him, then he realised that Mrs Weasley was attacking
 his hair with a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head.
\par \lquote Doesn\rquote t it ever lie flat?\rquote  she said desperately.
\par Harry shook his head.
\par Mr Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry.
\par \lquote I think we\rquote ll go now,\rquote  he said. \lquote We\rquote re a bit early, but I think you\rquote ll be better off at the Ministry than hanging around here.\rquote 
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to his feet.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll be all right, Harry,\rquote  said Tonks, patting him on the arm.
\par \lquote Good luck,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote I\rquote m sure it will be fine.\rquote 
\par \lquote And if it\rquote s not,\rquote  said Sirius grimly, \lquote I\rquote ll see to Amelia Bones for you ...\rquote 
\par Harry smiled weakly. Mrs Weasley hugged him.
\par \lquote We\rquote ve all got our fingers crossed,\rquote  she said.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Well ... see you later then.\rquote 
\par He followed Mr Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He could hear Sirius\rquote s mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains. Mr Weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold, grey dawn.
\par \lquote You don\rquote t normally walk to work, do you?\rquote  Harry asked him, as they set off briskly around the square.
\par \lquote No, I usually Apparate,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, \lquote but obviously you can\rquote t, and I think it\rquote s best we arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion ... makes a better impression, given what you\rquote re being dis\-ciplined for ...
\rquote 
\par Mr Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry knew it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were almost deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little under\-
ground station they found it already full of early-morning com\-muters. As ever when he found himself in close proximity to Muggles going about their daily business, Mr Weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm.
\par \lquote Simply fabulous,\rquote  he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket machines. \lquote Wonderfully ingenious.\rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote re out of order,\rquote  said Harry, pointing at the sign.
\par \lquote Yes, but even so ...\rquote  said Mr Weasley, beaming at them fondly.
\par They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard (Harry handled the transaction, as Mr Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and five m
inutes later they were boarding an underground train that rattled them off towards the centre of London. Mr Weasley kept anxiously checking and re-checking the Underground Map above the windows.
\par \lquote Four more stops, Harry ... Three stops left now ... Two stops to go, Harry ...\rquote 
\par They got off at a station in the very heart of London, and were swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carry\-ing briefcases. Up the escalator they went, through the ticket bar\-
rier (Mr Weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged on to a broad street lined with imposing-looking buildings and already full of traffic.
\par \lquote Where are we?\rquote  said Mr Weasley blankly, and for one heart-stopping moment Harry thought they had got off at the wrong sta\-tion despite Mr Weasley\rquote s continual references to the map; but a second later he said, \lquote 
Ah yes ... this way, Harry,\rquote  and led him down a side road.
\par \lquote Sorry,\rquote  he said, \lquote but I never come by train and it all looks rather different from a Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact, I\rquote ve never even used the visitors\rquote  entrance before.\rquote 
\par The further they walked, the smaller and less imposing the build\-ings became, until finally they reached a street that contained sev\-
eral rather shabby-looking offices, a pub and an overflowing skip. Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry of Magic.
\par \lquote Here we are,\rquote  said Mr Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red telephone box, which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffitied wall. \lquote After you, Harry.\rquote 
\par He opened the telephone-box door.
\par Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door. It was a tight f
it; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off. Mr Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver.
\par \lquote Mr Weasley, I think this might be out of order, too,\rquote  Harry said.
\par \lquote No, no, I\rquote m sure it\rquote s fine,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial. \lquote Let\rquote s see ... six ...\rquote  he dialled the number, \lquote 
two ... four ... and another four ... and another two ...\rquote 
\par As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr Weasley\rquote s hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invis\-ible woman were standing right beside them.
\par \lquote Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ...\rquote  said Mr Weasley, clearly uncertain whether or not he should talk into the receiver. He compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear, \lquote 
Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, here to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote  said the cool female voice. \lquote Visitor, please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes.\rquote 
\par There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked it up: it was a square silver badge with }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hearing }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 on it. He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again.

\par \lquote Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.\rquote 
\par The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking slowly into the ground. Harry watched apprehensively as the pave\-ment seemed to rise up pas
t the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at all; he could hear only a dull grinding noise as the tele\-
phone box made its way down through the earth. After about a minute, though it felt much
 longer to Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and, widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes watering.
\par \lquote The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,\rquote  said the woman\rquote s voice.
\par The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr Weasley stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open.
\par They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished, dark wood floor. The peacock blue ceiling was inlaid w
ith gleaming golden symbols that kept moving and changing like some enormous heavenly noticeboard. The walls on each side were panelled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them. Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from 
one of the left-hand fireplaces with a soft }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 whoosh.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
 On the right-hand side, short queues were forming before each fire\-place, waiting to depart.
\par Halfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of golden statues, larger than life-size, stood in the middle of a
 circular pool. Tallest of them all was a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air. Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur, a goblin and a house-elf. The last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and wiz
ard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of their wands, the point of the centaur\rquote s arrow, the tip of the goblin\rquote s hat and each of the house-elf\rquote s ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the }{

tors and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing glum, early-morning looks, strode towards a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall.
\par \lquote This way,\rquote  said Mr Weasley.
\par They joined the throng, wending their way between the Ministry workers, some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parch\-ment, others battered briefcases; still others were reading the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 while they walked. As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and bronze Knuts glin
ting up at him from the bottom of the pool. A small smudged sign beside it read:

\par \lquote I\rquote m escorting a visitor,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, gesturing towards Harry.
\par \lquote Step over here,\rquote  said the wizard in a bored voice.
\par Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry\rquote s front and back.
\par \lquote Wand,\rquote  grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the golden instrument and holding out his hand.
\par Harry produced his wand. The 
wizard dropped it on to a strange brass instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish. It began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base. The wizard tore this off and read the writing on 
it.
\par \lquote Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That correct?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry nervously.
\par \lquote I keep this,\rquote  said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike. \lquote You get this back,\rquote  he added, thrusting the wand at Harry.
\par \lquote Thank you.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hang on ...\rquote  said the wizard slowly.
\par His eyes had darted from the silver visitor\rquote s badge on Harry\rquote s chest to his forehead.
\par \lquote Thank you, Eric,\rquote  said Mr Weasley firmly, and grasping Harry by the shoulder he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates.
\par Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles. Harry and M
r Weasley joined the crowd around one of them. Nearby, stood a big bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box which was emitting rasping noises.
\par \lquote All right, Arthur?\rquote  said the wizard, nodding at Mr Weasley.
\par \lquote What\rquote ve you got there, Bob?\rquote  asked Mr Weasley, looking at the box.
\par \lquote We\rquote re not sure,\rquote  said the wizard seriously. \lquote We thought it was a bog-standard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.\rquote 
\par With a great jangling and clattering a lift 
descended in front of them; the golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr Weasley stepped into the lift with the rest of the crowd and Harry found himself jammed against the back wall. Several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously; he stared at
 his feet to avoid catching anyone\rquote s eye, flattening his fringe as he did so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly, chains rattling, while the same cool female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again.

\par \lquote Level Seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incor\-porating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club and Ludicrous Patents Office.\rquote 
\par The lift doors opened. Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking cor\-ridor, with various posters of
 Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls. One of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and dis\-
appeared down the corridor. The doors closed, the lift juddered upwards again and the woman\rquote s voice announced:
\par \lquote Level Six, Department of Magical Transportation, incorporating the Floo Network Authority, Broom Regulatory Control, Portkey Office and Apparation Test Centre.\rquote 
\par Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards go
t out; at the same time, several paper aeroplanes swooped into the lift. Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head; they were a pale violet colour and he could see }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Just inter-departmental memos,\rquote  Mr Weasley muttered to him. \lquote We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable ... droppings all over the desks ...\rquote 
\par As they clattered upwards again the memos flapped around the lamp swaying from the lift\rquote s ceiling.
\par \lquote Level Five, Department of International Magical Co-operation, incorporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the International Magical Office of Law and the International Confederation of Wizards, British Seats.\rquote 
\par When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few more of the witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that the light from the lamp flickered and flashed overhead as they darted around it.
\par \lquote Level Four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office and Pest Advisory Bureau.\rquote 
\par \lquote \rquote S\rquote cuse,\rquote  said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged shut yet again.
\par \lquote Level Three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Head-quarters and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.\rquote 
\par Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr Weasley, Harry and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parch\-ment that was trailing on the floor. The remaining memos con\-
tinued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upwards again, then the doors opened and the voice made its announcement.
\par \lquote Level Two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters and Wizengamot Administration Services.\rquote 
\par \lquote This is us, Harry,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors. \lquote My office is on the other side of the floor.\rquote 
\par \lquote Mr Weasley,\rquote  said Harry, as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming, \lquote aren\rquote t we still underground?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, we are,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote Those are enchanted windows. Magical Maintenance decide what weather we\rquote ll get every day. We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay rise ... Just round here, Harry.
\rquote 
\par They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors and emerged in a cluttered open area divided into cubicles, which 
was buzzing with talk and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Auror Headquarters.

\par Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed. The Aurors had covered 
their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters of their favourite Quidditch teams and articles from the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

h his boots up on his desk, dictating a report to his quill. A little further along, a witch with a patch over one eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt.
\par \lquote Morning, Weasley,\rquote  said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer. \lquote I\rquote ve been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, if it really is a second,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, \lquote I\rquote m in rather a hurry.\rquote 
\par They were talking as though they hardly knew each other and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr Weasley stood on his foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle.
\par Harry received a slight shock; blinking down at him from every direction was Sirius\rquote s face. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs \endash  even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters\rquote  wedding \endash 
 papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels.
\par \lquote Here,\rquote  said Kingsley brusquely to Mr Weasley, shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand. \lquote I need as much information as pos\-sible on flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We\rquote 
ve received information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.\rquote 
\par Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, \lquote Give him the magazine, he might find it interesting.\rquote  Then he said in normal tones, \lquote And don\rquote 
t take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month.\rquote 
\par \lquote If you had read my report you would know that the term is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 firearms,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said Mr Weasley coolly. \lquote And I\rquote m afraid you\rquote ll have to wait for information on motorcycles; we\rquote re extremely busy at the moment.\rquote  He dropped his voice and said, \lquote 
If you can get away before seven, Molly\rquote s making meatballs.\rquote 
\par He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley\rquote 
s cubicle, through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a
 broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Misuse of Muggle Artefacts.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Mr Weasley\rquote s dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard. Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely space to move around them because of all the over\-
flowing filing cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were totter\-ing piles of files. The little wall space available bore witness to Mr Weasley\rquote s obsessions: several posters of cars, including one of a dismantl
ed engine; two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children\rquote s books; and a diagram showing how to wire a plug.
\par Sitting on top of Mr Weasley\rquote s overflowing in-tray was an old toaster that was hiccoughing in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs. A photo\-
graph of the Weasley family stood beside the in-tray. Harry noticed that Percy appeared to have walked out of it.
\par \lquote We haven\rquote t got a window,\rquote  said Mr Weasley apologetically, taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair. \lquote We\rquote ve asked, but they don\rquote t seem to think we need one. Have a seat, Harry, doesn
\rquote t look as if Perkins is in yet.\rquote 
\par Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkins\rquote s desk while Mr Weasley riffled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shacklebolt had given him.
\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  he said, grinning, as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled The }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Quibbler }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par A memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccoughing toaster. Mr Weasley unfolded it and read it aloud.
\par \lquote \'93Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, kindly investigate immediately.\'94 This is getting ridiculous ...\rquote 
\par \lquote A regurgitating toilet?\rquote 
\par \lquote Anti-Muggle pranksters,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, frowning. \lquote We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disap\-pearing \endash

\par \lquote Exactly, yes, but of course they\rquote re flummoxed. I only hope we can catch whoever\rquote s doing it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Will it be Aurors who catch them?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it\rquote ll be the ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol \endash  ah, Harry, this is Perkins.\rquote 
\par A stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room, panting.
\par \lquote Oh, Arthur!\rquote  he said desperately, without looking at Harry. \lquote Thank goodness, I didn\rquote t know what to do for the best, whether to wait here for you or not. I\rquote ve just sent an owl to your home but you\rquote

\par \lquote Down in old \endash  but they told me \endash  Merlin\rquote s beard!\rquote 
\par Mr Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp and leapt from his chair.
\par \lquote Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!\rquote 
\par Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr Weasley left the office at a run, Harry close on his heels.
\par \lquote Why have they changed the time?\rquote  Harry said breathlessly, as they hurtled past the Auror cubicles; people poked out their heads and stared as they streaked past. Harry felt as though he\rquote d left all his insides back at Perkins\rquote 
s desk.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if you\rquote d missed it, it would have been catastrophic!\rquote 
\par Mr Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed im\-patiently at the \lquote down\rquote  button.
\par \lquote Come ON!\rquote 
\par The lift clattered into view and they hurried inside. Every time it stopped Mr Weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button.
\par \lquote Those courtrooms haven\rquote t been used in years,\rquote  said Mr Weasley angrily. \lquote I can\rquote t think why they\rquote re doing it down there \endash  unless \endash  but no \endash \rquote 
\par A plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment, and Mr Weasley did not elaborate.
\par \lquote The Atrium,\rquote  said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid open, showing Harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain. The plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with a very mournful face got in.
\par \lquote Morning, Arthur,\rquote  he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to descend. \lquote Don\rquote t often see you down here.\rquote 
\par \lquote Urgent business, Bode,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, who was bouncing on the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at Harry.
\par \lquote Ah, yes,\rquote  said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. \lquote Of course.\rquote 
\par Harry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his unfaltering gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable.
\par \lquote Department of Mysteries,\rquote  said the cool female voice, and left it at that.
\par \lquote Quick, Harry,\rquote 
 said Mr Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above. The walls were bare; there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor. Harry expecte
d them to go through it, but instead Mr Weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left, where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps.
\par \lquote Down here, down here,\rquote  panted Mr Weasley, taking two steps at a time. \lquote The lift doesn\rquote t even come down this far ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 why}{\rtlch\fcs1

\par They reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor, which bore a great resemblance to the one that led to Snape\rquote s dungeon at Hogwarts, with rough stone walls and torches in bracket
s. The doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes.
\par \lquote Courtroom ... Ten ... I think ... we\rquote re nearly ... yes.\rquote 
\par Mr Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall, clutching at a stitch in his chest.
\par \lquote Go on,\rquote  he panted, pointing his thumb at the door. \lquote Get in there.\rquote 
\par \lquote Aren\rquote t \endash  aren\rquote t you coming with \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, no, I\rquote m not allowed. Good luck!\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s heart was beating a violent tattoo against his Adam\rquote s apple. He swallowed hard, turned the heavy iron door handle and stepped inside the courtroom.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

Harry gasped; he could not help himself. The large dungeon he had entered was horribly familiar. He had not only seen it before, he had }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 been }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

 of him, but ahead, in the highest benches of all, were many shadowy figures. They had been talking in low voices, but as the heavy door swung closed behind Harry an omi\-nous silence fell.
\par A cold male voice rang across the courtroom.
\par \lquote You\rquote re late.\rquote 
\par \lquote Sorry,\rquote  said Harry nervously. \lquote I \endash  I didn\rquote t know the time had been changed.\rquote 
\par \lquote That is not the Wizengamot\rquote s fault,\rquote  said the voice. \lquote An owl was sent to you this morning. Take your seat.\rquote 
\par Harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the centre of the room, the arms of which were covered in chains. He had seen those chains spring to life and bind whoever sat between them. His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked across the stone floor. When he sa
t gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains clinked threateningly, but did not bind him. Feeling rather sick, he looked up at the people seated at the bench above.
\par There were about fifty of them, all, as far as he could see, wearing plum-coloured robes with an elaborately worked silver \lquote W\rquote 
 on the left-hand side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him, some with very austere expressions, others looks of frank curiosity.
\par In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for 
Magic. Fudge was a portly man who often sported a lime-green bowler hat, though today he had dispensed with it; he had dispensed, too, with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to Harry. A broad, square-jawed witch with very short grey hair 
sat on Fudge\rquote s left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding. On Fudge\rquote s right was another witch, but she was sit\-ting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow.
\par \lquote Very well,\rquote  said Fudge. \lquote The accused being present \endash  finally \endash  let us begin. Are you ready?\rquote  he called down the row.
\par \lquote Yes, sir,\rquote  said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron\rquote s brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came. Percy\rquote s eyes, behind his h
orn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a quill poised in his hand.
\par \lquote Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,\rquote  said Fudge in a ringing voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, \lquote into offences committed under the Decree for the Reasonable 
Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.
\par \lquote Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister for Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister. Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote Witness for the defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumble\-dore,\rquote  said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck.
\par Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long midnight-blue robes and a perfectly calm expression. His long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry and looked up at Fu
dge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose.
\par The members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All eyes were now on Dumbledore. Some looked annoyed, others slightly fright\-ened; two elderly witches in the back row, however, raised their hands and waved in welcome.
\par A powerful emotion had risen in Harry\rquote s chest at the sight of Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him. He wanted to catch Dumbledore\rquote s eye, but Dumbledore was not lo
oking his way; he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered Fudge.
\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted. \lquote Dumble\-dore. Yes. You \endash  er \endash  got our \endash  er \endash  message that the time and \endash  er \endash  place of the hearing had been changed, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote I must have missed it,\rquote  said Dumbledore cheerfully. \lquote However, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes \endash  well \endash  I suppose we\rquote ll need another chair \endash  I \endash  Weasley, could you \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not to worry, not to worry,\rquote  said Dumbledore pleasantly; he took out his wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz arm\-
chair appeared out of nowhere next to Harry. Dumbledore sat down, put the tips of his long fingers together and looked at Fudge over them with an expression
 of polite interest. The Wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly; only when Fudge spoke again did they settle down.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Fudge again, shuffling his notes. \lquote Well, then. So. The charges. Yes.\rquote 
\par He extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him, took a deep breath, and read out, \lquote The charges against the accused are as follows:
\par \lquote That he did knowingly, deliberately and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, having received a previous written warning from the Ministry 
of Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus Charm in a Muggle-inhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on the second of August at twenty-three minutes past nine, which constitutes an offence under Paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable Rest
riction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under Section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks\rquote  Statute of Secrecy.
\par \lquote You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey?\rquote  Fudge said, glaring at Harry over the top of his parchment.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  Harry said.
\par \lquote You received an official warning from the Ministry for using illegal magic three years ago, did you not?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote And yet you conjured a Patronus on the night of the second of August?\rquote  said Fudge.

\par Some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again; a few nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads.
\par \lquote It\rquote s not a question of how impressive the magic was,\rquote  said Fudge in a testy voice, \lquote in fact, the more impressive the worse it is, I would have thought, given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle!\rquote 
\par Those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement, but it was the sight of Percy\rquote s sanctimonious little nod that goaded Harry into speech.
\par \lquote I did it because of the Dementors!\rquote  he said loudly, before anyone could interrupt him again.
\par He had expected more muttering, but the silence that fell seemed to be somehow denser than before.
\par \lquote Dementors?\rquote  said Madam Bones after a moment, her thick eye\-brows rising until her monocle looked in danger of falling out. \lquote What do you mean, boy?\rquote 
\par \lquote I mean there were two Dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin!\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  said Fudge again, smirking unpleasantly as he looked around at the Wizengamot, as though inviting them to share the joke. \lquote Yes. Yes, I thought we\rquote d be hearing something like this.\rquote

\par \lquote Don\rquote t you, Amelia?\rquote  said Fudge, still smirking. \lquote Let me explain. He\rquote s been thinking it through and decided Dementors would make a very nice little cover story, very nice indeed. Muggles can\rquote t see Dementors, 
can they, boy? Highly convenient, highly convenient ... so it\rquote s just your word and no witnesses ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not lying!\rquote  said Harry loudly, over another outbreak of mut\-tering from the court. \lquote There were two of them, coming from oppo\-site ends of the alley, everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Enough, enough!\rquote  said Fudge, with a very supercilious look on his face. \lquote I\rquote m sorry to interrupt what I\rquote m sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story \endash \rquote 
\par Dumbledore cleared his throat. The Wizengamot fell silent again.
\par \lquote We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of Dementors in that alleyway,\rquote  he said, \lquote other than Dudley Dursley, I mean.\rquote 
\par Fudge\rquote s plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let air out of it. He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two, then, with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together, said, \lquote We haven\rquote 
t got time to listen to more tarradiddles, I\rquote m afraid, Dumbledore. I want this dealt with quickly \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I may be wrong,\rquote  said Dumbledore pleasantly, \lquote but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case? Isn\rquote 
t that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones?\rquote  he continued, addressing the witch in the monocle.
\par \lquote True,\rquote  said Madam Bones. \lquote Perfectly true.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, very well, very well,\rquote  snapped Fudge. \lquote Where is this person?\rquote 
\par \lquote I brought her with me,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote She\rquote s just outside the door. Should I \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote No \endash  Weasley, you go,\rquote  Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at once, ran down the stone steps from the judge\rquote s balcony and hur\-ried past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them.
\par A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs Figg. She looked scared and more batty than ever. Harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers.
\par Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs Figg his chair, conjuring a second one for himself.
\par \lquote Full name?\rquote  said Fudge loudly, when Mrs Figg had perched her\-self nervously on the very edge of her seat.
\par \lquote Arabella Doreen Figg,\rquote  said Mrs Figg in her quavery voice.
\par \lquote And who exactly are you?\rquote  said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice.
\par \lquote I\rquote m a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,\rquote  said Mrs Figg.
\par \lquote We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging, other than Harry Potter,\rquote  said Madam Bones at once. \lquote That situation has always been closely monitored, given ... given past events.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m a Squib,\rquote  said Mrs Figg. \lquote So you wouldn\rquote t have me regis\-tered, would you?\rquote 
\par \lquote A Squib, eh?\rquote  said Fudge, eyeing her suspiciously. \lquote We\rquote ll be checking that. You\rquote ll leave details of your parentage with my assistant Weasley. Incidentally, can Squibs see Dementors?\rquote 
 he added, looking left and right along the bench.
\par \lquote Yes, we can!\rquote  said Mrs Figg indignantly.
\par Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. \lquote Very well,\rquote  he said aloofly. \lquote What is your story?\rquote 
\par \lquote I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk, around about nine o\rquote clock, on the evening of the second of August,\rquote  gabbled Mrs Figg at once, as though she had learned what she was saying by heart, 
\lquote when I heard a dis\-turbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw Dementors running \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Running?\rquote  said Madam Bones sharply. \lquote Dementors don\rquote t run, they glide.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s what I meant to say,\rquote  said Mrs Figg quickly, patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks. \lquote Gliding along the alley towards what looked like two boys.\rquote 
\par \lquote What did they look like?\rquote  said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so that the edge of the monocle disappeared into her flesh.
\par \lquote Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, no,\rquote  said Madam Bones impatiently. \lquote The Dementors ... describe them.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Mrs Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now. \lquote They were big. Big and wearing cloaks.\rquote 
\par Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever Mrs Figg might say, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a Dementor, a
nd a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering inches over the ground; or the rotting smell of them; or that terrible rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air ...
\par In the second row, a dumpy wizard with a large black mous\-tache leaned close to whisper in the ear of his neighbour, a frizzy-haired witch. She smirked and nodded.
\par \lquote Big and wearing cloaks,\rquote  repeated Madam Bones coolly, while Fudge snorted derisively. \lquote I see. Anything else?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Mrs Figg. \lquote I felt them. Everything went cold, and this was a very warm summer\rquote s night, mark you. And I felt ... as though all happiness had gone from the world ... and I remembered ... dreadful things ...\rquote 

\par Her voice shook and died.
\par Madam Bones\rquote s eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it.
\par \lquote What did the Dementors do?\rquote  she asked, and Harry felt a rush of hope.
\par \lquote They went for the boys,\rquote  said Mrs Figg, her voice stronger and more confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. \lquote 
One of them had fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the Dementor. That was Harry. He tried twice and produced only silver vapour. On the third attempt, he produced a Patronus, which charged down the first Dementor and then, with his encour
\-agement, chased the second one away from his cousin. And that ... that is what happened,\rquote  Mrs Figg finished, somewhat lamely.
\par Madam Bones looked down at Mrs Figg in silence. Fudge was not looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally, he raised his eyes and said, rather aggressively, \lquote That\rquote s what you saw, is it?\rquote 
\par \lquote That is what happened,\rquote  Mrs Figg repeated.
\par \lquote Very well,\rquote  said Fudge. \lquote You may go.\rquote 
\par Mrs Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then got up and shuffled off towards the door. Harry heard it thud shut behind her.
\par \lquote Not a very convincing witness,\rquote  said Fudge loftily.
\par \lquote Oh, I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Madam Bones, in her booming voice. \lquote She certainly described the effects of a Dementor attack very accu\-rately. And I can\rquote t imagine why she would say they were there if they weren\rquote t.
\rquote 
\par \lquote But Dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 hap\-pening }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
to come across a wizard?\rquote  snorted Fudge. \lquote The odds on that must be very, very long. Even Bagman wouldn\rquote t have bet \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, I don\rquote t think any of us believe the Dementors were there by coincidence,\rquote  said Dumbledore lightly.
\par The witch sitting to the right of Fudge, with her face in shadow, moved slightly but everyone else was quite still and silent.
\par \lquote And what is that supposed to mean?\rquote  Fudge asked icily.
\par \lquote It means that I think they were ordered there,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of Dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging!\rquote  barked Fudge.
\par \lquote Not if the Dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days,\rquote  said Dumbledore calmly. \lquote I have already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, you have,\rquote  said Fudge forcefully, \lquote and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The Dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing every\-thing we ask them to.\rquote 
\par \lquote Then,\rquote  said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, \lquote we must ask our\-selves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of Dementors into that alleyway on the second of August.\rquote 
\par In the complete silence that greeted these words, the witch to the right of Fudge leaned forwards so that Harry saw her for the first time.
\par He thought she looked just like a la
rge, pale toad. She was rather squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon and a very wide, slack mouth. Her eyes were large, round and slightly bulging. Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him i
n mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue.
\par \lquote The Chair recognises Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Under\-secretary to the Minister,\rquote  said Fudge.
\par The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took Harry aback; he had been expecting a croak.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,\rquote  she said, with a simper that left her big, round eyes as cold as ever. \lquote 
So silly of me. But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy!\rquote 
\par She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry\rquote s neck stand up. A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with her. It could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused.
\par \lquote 
If it is true that the Dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two Dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,
\rquote  said Dumbledore politely. \lquote Of course, these particular Dementors may have been outside Ministry control \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote There are no Dementors outside Ministry control!\rquote  snapped Fudge, who had turned brick red.
\par Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow.
\par \lquote Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they attacked without authorisation.\rquote 
\par \lquote It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does not do, Dumbledore!\rquote  snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of which Uncle Vernon would have been proud.
\par \lquote Of course it isn\rquote t,\rquote  said Dumbledore mildly. \lquote I was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvesti\-gated.\rquote 
\par He glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him, frowning slightly.
\par \lquote I would remind everybody that the behaviour of these Dementors, if indeed they are not figments of this boy\rquote s imagina\-tion, is not the subject of this hearing!\rquote  said Fudge. \lquote We are here to examine Harry Potter\rquote 
s offences under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery!\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course we are,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote but the presence of Dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant. Clause Seven of the Decree states that magic may be used before Muggles in excep\-
tional circumstances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations which threaten the life of the wizard or witch him- or herself, or any witches, wizards or Muggles present at the time of the \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We are familiar with Clause Seven, thank you very much!\rquote  snarled Fudge.
\par \lquote Of course you are,\rquote  said Dumbledore courteously. \lquote Then we are in agreement that Harry\rquote s use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circum\-stances the clause describes?
\rquote 
\par \lquote If there were Dementors, which I doubt.\rquote 
\par \lquote You have heard it from an eyewitness,\rquote  Dumbledore interrupted.
\par \lquote If you still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again. I am sure she would not object.\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  that \endash  not \endash \rquote  blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers before him. \lquote It\rquote s \endash  I want this over with today, Dumbledore!\rquote 
\par \lquote But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of jus\-tice,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Serious miscarriage, my hat!\rquote  said Fudge at the top of his voice. \lquote 
Have you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull stories this boy has come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school? I suppose you\rquote ve forgotten the Hover Charm he used three years ago 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That wasn\rquote t me, it was a house-elf!\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote YOU SEE?\rquote  roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry\rquote s direction. \lquote A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you.\rquote 
\par \lquote The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish.\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  not \endash  I haven\rquote t got time to listen to house-elves! Anyway, that\rquote s not the only \endash  he blew up his aunt, for God\rquote s sake!\rquote  Fudge shouted, banging his fist on the judge\rquote 
s bench and upsetting a bottle of ink.
\par \lquote And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions,\rquote  said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes.
\par \lquote And I haven\rquote t even started on what he gets up to at school.\rquote 
\par \lquote But, as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts stu\-dents for misdemeanours at school, Harry\rquote s behaviour there is not relevant to this hearing,\rquote  said 
Dumbledore, as politely as ever, but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words.
\par \lquote Oho!\rquote  said Fudge. \lquote Not our business what he does at school, eh? You think so?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts stu\-dents, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Nor does it have the right to confis\-
cate wands until charges have been successfully proven; again, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August. In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, in\-advertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Laws can be changed,\rquote  said Fudge savagely.
\par \lquote Of course they can,\rquote  said Dumbledore, inclining his head. \lquote And you certainly seem to be making many changes,
 Cornelius. Why, in the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic!\rquote 
\par A few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce. The toadlike witch on his right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face quite expressionless.
\par \lquote As far as I am aware,\rquote  Dumbledore continued, \lquote there is no law yet in place that says this court\rquote 
s job is to punish Harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed. He has been charged with a specific offence and he has presented his defence. All he and I can do now is to await your verdict.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no
 more. Fudge glared at him, evidently incensed. Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, seeking reassurance; he was not at all sure that Dumbledore was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about time they made a decision. Again, however, 
Dumbledore seemed oblivious to Harry\rquote s attempt to catch his eye. He continued to look up at the benches where the entire Wizengamot had fallen into urgent, whispered conversations.
\par Harry looked at his feet. His heart, which seemed to have swollen to an unna
tural size, was thumping loudly under his ribs. He had expected the hearing to last longer than this. He was not at all sure that he had made a good impression. He had not really said very much. He ought to have explained more fully about the Dementors, a
bout how he had fallen over, about how both he and Dudley had nearly been kissed ...
\par Twice he looked up at Fudge and opened his mouth to speak, but his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he merely took a deep breath and looked back down at his shoes.
\par Then the whispering stopped. Harry wanted to look up at the judges, but found that it was really much, much easier to keep examining his laces.
\par \lquote Those in favour of clearing the accused of all charges?\rquote  said Madam Bones\rquote s booming voice.
\par Harry\rquote s head jerked upwards. There were hands in the air, many of them ... more than half! Breathing very fast, he tried to count, but before he could finish, Madam Bones had said, \lquote And those in favour of conviction?\rquote 
\par Fudge raised his hand; so did half a dozen others, including the witch on his right and the heavily-moustached wizard and the frizzy-haired witch in the second row.
\par Fudge glanced around at them all, looking as though there was something large stuck in his throat, then lowered his own hand. He took two deep breaths and said, in a voice distorted by sup\-pressed rage, \lquote 
Very well, very well ... cleared of all charges.\rquote 
\par \lquote Excellent,\rquote  said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feet, pulling out his wand and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish. \lquote Well, I must be getting along. Good-day to you all.\rquote 
\par And without looking once at Harry, he swept from the dungeon.

s right, who was now gazing down at him instead of at Dumbledore. Ignoring her, he tried to catch Fudge\rquote s eye, or Madam Bones\rquote s, wanting to ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined not to
 notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase, so he took a few tentative steps towards the exit and, when nobody called him back, broke into a very fast walk.

\par \lquote Dumbledore didn\rquote t say \endash \rquote

\par \lquote Harry, that\rquote s wonderful! Well, of course, they couldn\rquote t have found you guilty, not on the evidence, but even so, I can\rquote t pretend I wasn\rquote t \endash \rquote 
\par But Mr Weasley broke off, because the courtroom door had just opened again. The Wizengamot were filing out.
\par \lquote Merlin\rquote s beard!\rquote  exclaimed Mr Weasley wonderingly, pulling Harry aside to let them all pass. \lquote You were tried by the full court?\rquote 
\par \lquote I think so,\rquote  said Harry quietly.
\par One or two of the wizards nodded to Harry as they passed and a few, including Madam Bones, said, \lquote Morning, Arthur,\rquote 
 to Mr Weasley, but most averted their eyes. Cornelius Fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon. Fudge acted as though Mr Weasley and Harry were part of the wall, but again, the witch looked almost appraisingly at Harry as
 she passed. Last of all to pass was Percy. Like Fudge, he completely ignored his father and Harry; he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills, his back rigid and his nose in the air. The lines around Mr Weasley
\rquote s mouth tightened slightly, but other than this he gave no sign that he had seen his third son.
\par \lquote I\rquote m going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news,\rquote  he said, beckoning Harry forwards as Percy\rquote s heels disappeared up the steps to Level Nine. \lquote I\rquote 
ll drop you off on the way to that toilet in Bethnal Green. Come on ...\rquote 
\par \lquote So, what will you have to do about the toilet?\rquote  Harry asked, grinning. Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual. It was starting to sink in: he was cleared, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Oh, it\rquote s a simple enough anti-jinx,\rquote  said Mr Weasley as they mounted the stairs, \lquote but it\rquote s not so much having to repair the damage, it\rquote 
s more the attitude behind the vandalism, Harry. Muggle-baiting might strike some wizards as funny, but it\rquote s an expression of some\-thing much deeper and nastier, and I for one \endash \rquote 
\par Mr Weasley broke off in mid-sentence. They had just reached the ninth-level corridor and Cornelius Fudge was standing a few feet away from them, talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a pointed, pale face.
\par The second man turned at the sound of their footsteps. He, too, broke off in mid-conversation, his cold grey eyes narrowed and fixed upon Harry\rquote s face.
\par \lquote Well, well, well ... Patronus Potter,\rquote  said Lucius Malfoy coolly.
\par Harry felt winded, as though he had just walked into something solid. He had last seen those cold grey eyes through slits in a Death Eater\rquote s hood, and last heard that man\rquote s voice jeering in a dark grave\-yard while Lord Voldemort torture
d him. Harry could not believe that Lucius Malfoy dared look him in the face; he could not believe that he was here, in the Ministry of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talking to him, when Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy was a Death Eat

\par \lquote I don\rquote t think private matters between myself and the Minister are any concern of yours, Potter,\rquote  said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his robes. Harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold.

\par \lquote Certainly,\rquote  said Fudge, turning his back on Harry and Mr Weasley. \lquote This way, Lucius.\rquote

\par \lquote Why wasn\rquote t he waiting outside Fudge\rquote s office if they\rquote ve got busi\-ness to do together?\rquote  Harry burst out furiously. \lquote What was he doing down here?\rquote

\par The lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around Mr Weasley\rquote s head as he pressed the button for the Atrium and the doors clanged shut. He waved them away irritably.
\par \lquote Mr Weasley,\rquote  said Harry slowly, \lquote if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like Malfoy, if he\rquote s seeing them alone, how do we know they haven\rquote t put the Imperius Curse on him?\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t think it hasn\rquote t occurred to us, Harry,\rquote  said Mr Weasley quietly. \lquote But Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment \endash  which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of com\-
fort. Best not talk about it any more just now, Harry.\rquote 
\par The doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almost-deserted Atrium. Eric the watchwizard was hidden behind his }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 again. They had walked straight past the golden fountain before Harry remembered.
\par \lquote Wait ...\rquote  he told Mr Weasley, and, pulling his moneybag from his pocket, he turned back to the fountain.
\par He looked up into the handsome wizard\rquote s face, but close-to Harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish. The witch was wearin
g a vapid smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of goblins and centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring so soppily at humans of any description. Only the house-elf\rquote 
s attitude of creeping servility looked convincing. With a 
grin at the thought of what Hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf, Harry turned his moneybag upside-down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the whole contents into the pool.

Over the next few days Harry could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not seem wholly overjoyed 
that he would be returning to Hogwarts. Sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news, wringing Harry\rquote

\par \lquote Come off it!\rquote  said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely shrugged.

Harry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached; he could not wait to see Hagrid again, to play Quidditch, e
ven to stroll across the vegetable patches to the Herbology greenhouses; it would be a treat just to leave this dusty, musty house, where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and Kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed, though Ha
rry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of Sirius.

The fact was that living at the Headquarters of the anti-Voldemort movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would have expected before he\rquote 
d experienced it. Though members of the Order of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for meals, sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered con\-
versation, Mrs Weasley made sure that Harry and the others were kept well out of earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody, not even Sirius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival.

\par On the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hedwig\rquote s owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.
\par \lquote Booklists have arrived,\rquote  he said, throwing one of the envelopes up to Harry, who was standing on a chair. \lquote About time, I thought they\rquote d forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this ...\rquote 
\par Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over Ron\rquote s head into the wastepaper basket in the corner, which swallowed it and belched loudly. He then opened his letter. It contained two pieces of parchment: one
 the usual reminder that term started on the first of September; the other telling him which books he would need for the coming year.

\par \lquote We were just wondering who set the Slinkhard book,\rquote  said Fred conversationally.

\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean?\rquote  Harry asked, jumping down beside them.
\par \lquote Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back,\rquote  Fred told Harry, \lquote and from what they were saying, Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year.\rquote 
\par \lquote Not surprising, is it, when you look at what\rquote s happened to the last four?\rquote  said George.
\par \lquote One sacked, one dead, one\rquote s memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine months,\rquote  said Harry, counting them off on his fingers. \lquote Yeah, I see what you mean.\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s up with you, Ron?\rquote  asked Fred.
\par Ron did not answer. Harry looked round. Ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts.
\par \lquote What\rquote s the matter?\rquote  said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment.
\par Fred\rquote s mouth fell open, too.

\par Fred and George exchanged looks.
\par \lquote You don\rquote t mind if we don\rquote t kiss you, do you, Ron?\rquote  said Fred in a falsely anxious voice.
\par \lquote We could curtsey, if you like,\rquote  said George.
\par \lquote Oh, shut up,\rquote  said Ron, scowling at them.
\par \lquote Or what?\rquote  said Fred, an evil grin spreading across his face. \lquote Going to put us in detention?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote d love to see him try,\rquote  sniggered George.

\par \lquote We\rquote re going to have to watch our step, George,\rquote  said Fred, pre\-tending to tremble, \lquote with these two on our case ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally over,\rquote  said George, shaking his head.

\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think they are,\rquote  said Ron doubtfully, also looking up at the ceiling. \lquote They\rquote ve always said only prats become prefects ... still,\rquote  he added on a happier note, \lquote they\rquote

 just so she knows ...\rquote 
\par He dashed from the room, leaving Harry and Hermione alone.
\par For some reason, Harry found he did not want to look at Hermione. He turned to his bed, picked up the pile of clean robes Mrs Weasley had laid on it and crossed the room to his trunk.
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote  said Hermione tentatively.
\par \lquote Well done, Hermione,\rquote  said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all, and, still not looking at her, \lquote brilliant. Prefect. Great.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Erm \endash  Harry \endash  could I borrow Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad? They\rquote ll be really pleased \endash  I mean }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Yeah, no problem,\rquote  said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him. \lquote Take her!\rquote 
\par He leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on 
the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called Hedwig down. A few moments passed; Harry heard the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only sounds he could hear were the blank 
picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings.
\par He straightened up and looked behind him. Hermione had left and Hedwig had gone. Harry returned slowly to his bed and sank on to it, gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe.
\par He had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year. He had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way towards certain people. But if he }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 had }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 remem\-bered ... if he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Not this, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said a small and truthful voice inside his head.
\par Harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands. He could not lie to himself; if he had known the prefect badge was on its way, he would have expected it to come to him, not Ron. Did this make him as arrogant as Draco Malfoy? Did he think himself sup
erior to everyone else? Did he really believe he was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 better }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 than Ron?
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 No, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said the small voice defiantly.
\par Was that true? Harry wondered, anxiously probing his own feelings.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 I\rquote m better at Quidditch, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said the voice. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 That 
was definitely true, Harry thought; he was no better than Ron in lessons. But what about outside lessons? What about those adventures he, Ron and Hermione had had together since starting at Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion?
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Well, Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said the voice in Harry
\rquote s head.
\par Not all the time, though, Harry argued with himself. They didn\rquote t fight Quirrell with me. They didn\rquote t take on Riddle and the Basilisk. They didn\rquote t get rid of all those Dementors the night Sirius escaped. They weren\rquote 
t in that graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned ...
\par And the same feeling of ill-usage that had overwhelmed him on the night he had arrived rose again. I\rquote ve definitely done more, Harry thought indignantly. I\rquote ve done more than either of them!
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 But maybe, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said the small voice fairly, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 maybe Dumbledore doesn\rquote t choose prefects because they\rquote ve got themselves into a load of dangerous situations ... maybe he chooses them for other reasons ... Ron must have something you don
\rquote t ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the wardrobe\rquote s clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said: \lquote No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect ...\rquote 
\par Harry gave a small snort of laughter. A second later he felt sick\-ened with himself.
\par Ron had not asked Dumbledore to give him the prefect badge. This was not Ron\rquote s fault. Was he, Harry, Ron\rquote s best friend in the world, going to sulk because he didn\rquote t have a badge, laugh with the twins behind Ron\rquote 
s back, ruin this for Ron when, for the first time, he had beaten Harry at something?
\par At this point Harry heard Ron\rquote s footsteps on the stairs again. He stood up, straightened his glasses, and hitched a grin on to his face as Ron bounded back through the door.
\par \lquote Just caught her!\rquote  he said happily. \lquote She says she\rquote ll get the Cleansweep if she can.\rquote 
\par \lquote Cool,\rquote  Harry said, and he was relieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty. \lquote Listen \endash  Ron \endash  well done, mate.\rquote 
\par The smile faded off Ron\rquote s face.
\par \lquote I never thought it would be me!\rquote  he said, shaking his head. \lquote I thought it would be you!\rquote 
\par \lquote Nah, I\rquote ve caused too much trouble,\rquote  Harry said, echoing Fred.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote yeah, I suppose ... well, we\rquote d better get our trunks packed, hadn\rquote t we?\rquote 
\par It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scat\-
tered themselves since they had arrived. It took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks. Harry noticed that Ron kept moving his prefect\rquote 
s badge around, first p
lacing it on his bedside table, then putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and laying it on his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the black. Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead
 with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk.
\par Mrs Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o\rquote clock, laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron took from her with a moan of longing.
\par \lquote Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I want you all downstairs,\rquote  she said, but the moment she was out of sight Ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom, an ecstatic ex
pression on his face.
\par Down in the basement Mrs Weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table, which read:

\par Sirius, Lupin, Tonks and Kingsley Shacklebolt were already there and Mad-Eye Moody stumped in shortly after Harry had got himself a Butterbeer.
\par \lquote Oh, Alastor, I am glad you\rquote re here,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley brightly, as Mad-Eye shrugged off his travelling cloak. \lquote We\rquote ve been wanting to ask you for ages \endash 
 could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us what\rquote s inside it? We haven\rquote t wanted to open it just in case it\rquote s something really nasty.\rquote 
\par \lquote No problem, Molly ...\rquote 
\par Moody\rquote s electric-blue eye swivelled upwards and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen.
\par \lquote Drawing room ...\rquote  he growled, as the pupil contracted. \lquote Desk in the corner? Yeah, I see it ... yeah, it\rquote s a Boggart ... want me to go up and get rid of it, Molly?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, no, I\rquote ll do it myself later,\rquote  beamed Mrs Weasley, \lquote you have your drink. We\rquote re having a little bit of a celebration, actually ...\rquote  She gestured at the scarlet banner. \lquote Fourth prefect in the family!
\rquote  she said fondly, ruffling Ron\rquote s hair.
\par \lquote Prefect, eh?\rquote  growled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and his magical eye swivelling around to gaze into the side of his head. Harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away towards Sirius and Lupin.
\par \lquote Well, congratulations,\rquote  said Moody, still glaring at Ron with his normal eye, \lquote authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose Dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he wouldn\rquote t have appointed you ...
\rquote 
\par Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble o
f responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother. Mrs Weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had brought Mundungus with them; he was wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined t
he offer to remove it and put it with Moody\rquote s travelling cloak.
\par \lquote Well, I think a toast is in order,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, when everyone had a drink. He raised his goblet. \lquote To Ron and Hermione, the new Gryffindor prefects!\rquote 
\par Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them, and then applauded.
\par \lquote I was never a prefect myself,\rquote  said Tonks brightly from behind Harry as everybody moved towards the table to help themselves to food. Her hair was tomato red and waist-length today; she looked like Ginny\rquote s older sister. \lquote 
My Head of House said I lacked certain necessary qualities.\rquote 
\par \lquote Like what?\rquote  said Ginny, who was choosing a baked potato.
\par \lquote Like the ability to behave myself,\rquote  said Tonks.
\par Ginny laughed; Hermione looked as though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of Butterbeer and choking on it.
\par \lquote What about you, Sirius?\rquote  Ginny asked, thumping Hermione on the back.
\par Sirius, who was right beside Harry, let out his usual bark-like laugh.
\par \lquote No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in detention with James. Lupin was the good boy, he got the badge.\rquote 
\par \lquote I think Dumbledore might have hoped I would be able to exer\-cise some control over my best friends,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote I need scarcely say that I failed dismally.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been a prefect either. All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; he loaded up his plate, feeling doubly fond of everyone in the room.
\par Ron was rhapsodising about his new broom to anybody who would listen.
\par \lquote ... nought to seventy in ten seconds, not bad, is it? When you think the Comet Two Ninety\rquote s only nought to sixty and that\rquote s with a decent tailwind according to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Hermione was talking very earnestly to Lupin about her view of elf rights.
\par \lquote I mean, it\rquote s the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation, isn\rquote t it? It all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking they\rquote re superior to other creatures ...\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley and Bill were having their usual argument about Bill\rquote s hair.
\par \lquote ... getting really out of hand, and you\rquote re so good-looking, it would look much better shorter, wouldn\rquote t it, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh \endash  I dunno \endash \rquote  said Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion; he slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George, who were huddled in a corner with Mundungus.
\par Mundungus stopped talking when he saw Harry, but Fred winked and beckoned Harry closer.
\par \lquote It\rquote s OK,\rquote  he told Mundungus, \lquote we can trust Harry, he\rquote s our finan\-cial backer.\rquote 
\par \lquote Look what Dung\rquote s got us,\rquote  said George, holding out his hand to Harry. It was full of what looked like shrivelled black pods. A faint rattling noise was coming from them, even though they were completely stationary.
\par \lquote Venomous Tentacula seeds,\rquote  said George. \lquote We need them for the Skiving Snackboxes but they\rquote re a Class C Non-Tradeable Substance so we\rquote ve been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ten Galleons the lot, then, Dung?\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote Wiv all the trouble I went to to get \rquote em?\rquote  said Mundungus, his saggy, bloodshot eyes stretching even wider. \lquote I\rquote m sorry, lads, but I\rquote m not taking a Knut under twenty.\rquote 
\par \lquote Dung likes his little joke,\rquote  Fred said to Harry.
\par \lquote Yeah, his best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of Knarl quills,\rquote  said George.
\par \lquote Be careful,\rquote  Harry warned them quietly.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Fred. \lquote Mum\rquote s busy cooing over Prefect Ron, we\rquote re OK.\rquote 
\par \lquote But Moody could have his eye on you,\rquote  Harry pointed out.
\par Mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder.
\par \lquote Good point, that,\rquote  he grunted. \lquote All right, lads, ten it is, if you\rquote ll take \rquote em quick.\rquote 
\par \lquote Cheers, Harry!\rquote  said Fred delightedly, when Mundungus had emptied his pockets into the twins\rquote  outstretched hands and scuttled off towards the food. \lquote We\rquote d better get these upstairs ...\rquote 
\par Harry watched them go, feeling slightly uneasy. It had just occurred to him that Mr an
d Mrs Weasley would want to know how Fred and George were financing their joke shop business when, as was inevitable, they finally found out about it. Giving the twins his Triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but what if it led 
to another family row and a Percy-like estrangement? Would Mrs Weasley still feel that Harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for Fred and George to start a career she thought quite unsuitable?
\par Standing where the twins had left him, with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company, Harry caught the sound of his own name. Kingsley Shacklebolt\rquote s deep voice was audible even over the surrounding chatter.
\par \lquote ... why Dumbledore didn\rquote t make Potter a prefect?\rquote  said Kingsley.
\par \lquote He\rquote ll have had his reasons,\rquote  replied Lupin.
\par \lquote But it would\rquote ve shown confidence in him. It\rquote s what I\rquote d\rquote ve done,\rquote  persisted Kingsley, \lquote \rquote specially with the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 having a go at him every few days ...\rquote 
\par Harry did not look round; he did not want
 Lupin or Kingsley to know he had heard. Though not remotely hungry, he followed Mundungus back towards the table. His pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as it had come; he wished he were upstairs in bed.
\par Mad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken-leg with what remained of his nose; evidently he could not detect any trace of poison, because he then tore a strip off it with his teeth.
\par \lquote ... the handle\rquote s made of Spanish oak with anti-jinx varnish and in-built vibration control \endash \rquote  Ron was saying to Tonks.
\par Mrs Weasley yawned widely.
\par \lquote Well, I think I\rquote ll sort out that Boggart before I turn in ... Arthur, I don\rquote t want this lot up too late, all right? Night, Harry, dear.\rquote 
\par She left the kitchen. Harry set down his plate and wondered whether he could follow her without attracting attention.
\par \lquote You all right, Potter?\rquote  grunted Moody.
\par \lquote Yeah, fine,\rquote  lied Harry.
\par Moody took a swig from his hipflask, his electric-blue eye staring sideways at Harry.
\par \lquote Come here, I\rquote ve got something that might interest you,\rquote  he said.
\par From an inner pocket of his robes Moody pulled a very tattered old wizarding photograph.
\par \lquote Original Order of the Phoenix,\rquote  growled Moody. \lquote Found it last night when I was looking for my spare Invisibility Cloak, seeing as Podmore hasn\rquote t had the manners to return my best one ... thought people might like to see it.
\rquote 
\par Harry took the photograph. A small crowd of people, some waving at him, others lifting their glasses, looked back up at him.
\par \lquote There\rquote s me,\rquote  said Moody, unnecessarily pointing at himself. The Moody in the picture was unmistakeable, though his hair was slightly less grey and his nose was intact. \lquote And there\rquote 
s Dumbledore beside me, Dedalus Diggle on the other side ... that\rquote s Marlene McKinnon, she was killed two weeks after this was taken, they got her whole family. That\rquote s Frank and Alice Longbottom \endash \rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s stomach, already uncomfortable, clenched as he looked at Alice Longbottom; he knew her round, friendly face very well, even though he had never met her, because she was the image of her son, Neville.
\par \lquote \endash  poor devils,\rquote  growled Moody. \lquote Better dead than what hap\-pened to them ... and that\rquote s Emmeline Vance, you\rquote ve met her, and that there\rquote 
s Lupin, obviously ... Benjy Fenwick, he copped it too, we only ever found bits of him ... shift aside there,\rquote  he added, poking the picture, and the little photographic people edged side\-
ways, so that those who were partially obscured could move to the front.
\par \lquote That\rquote s Edgar Bones ... brother of Amelia Bones, they got him and his family, too, he was a great wizard ... Sturgis Podmo
re, blimey, he looks young ... Caradoc Dearborn, vanished six months after this, we never found his body ... Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the same as ever ... Elphias Doge, you\rquote ve met him, I\rquote d for\-
gotten he used to wear that stupid hat ... Gideon Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to kill him and his brother Fabian, they fought like heroes ... budge along, budge along ...\rquote 
\par The little people in the photograph jostled among themselves and those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture.
\par \lquote That\rquote s Dumbledore\rquote s brother Aberforth, only time I ever met him, strange bloke ... that\rquote 
s Dorcas Meadowes, Voldemort killed her personally ... Sirius, when he still had short hair ... and ... there you go, thought that would interest you!\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s heart turned over. His mother and father were beaming up at him, sitting on either side of a small, watery-eyed man whom Harry recognised at once as Wormtail, the one who had betrayed his parents\rquote 
 whereabouts to Voldemort and so helped to bring about their deaths.
\par \lquote Eh?\rquote  said Moody.
\par Harry looked up into Moody\rquote s heavily scarred and pitted face. Evidently Moody was under the impression he had just given Harry a bit of a treat.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, once again attempting to grin. \lquote Er ... listen, I\rquote ve just remembered, I haven\rquote t packed my ...\rquote 
\par He was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not packed. Sirius had just said, \lquote What\rquote s that you\rquote ve got there, Mad-Eye?\rquote  and Moody had turned towards him. Harry crossed the kitchen, slipped through the
 door and up the stairs before anyone could call him back.
\par He did not know why it had been such a shock; he had seen pictures of his parents before, after all, and he had met Wormtail ... but to have them sprung on him like that, when he was least expecting it ... no one would like that, he thought angrily ...

\par And then, to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces ... Benjy Fenwick, who had been found in bits, and Gideon Prewett, who had died like a hero, and the Longbottoms, who had been tortured 
into madness ... all waving happily out of the photograph forever more, not knowing that they were doomed ... well, Moody might find that interesting ... he, Harry, found it disturbing ...
\par Harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elf-heads, glad to be on his own again, but as he approached the first landing he heard noises. Someone was sobbing in the drawing room.
\par \lquote Hello?\rquote  Harry said.
\par There was no answer but the sobbing continued. He climbed the remaining stairs two at a time, walked across the landing and opened the drawing-room door.
\par Someone was cowering against the dark wall, her wand in her hand, her whole body shaking with sobs. Sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of moonlight, clearly dead, was Ron.

\par \lquote What\rquote s going on?\rquote 
\par Lupin had come running into the room, closely followed by Sirius, with Moody stumping along behind them. Lupin looked from Mrs Weasley to the dead Harry on the floor and seemed to
 understand in an instant. Pulling out his own wand, he said, very firmly and clearly:
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Riddikulus!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Harry\rquote s body vanished. A silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain. Lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke.
\par \lquote Oh \endash  oh \endash  oh!\rquote  gulped Mrs Weasley, and she broke into a storm of crying, her face in her hands.
\par \lquote Molly,\rquote  said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her. \lquote Molly, don\rquote t ...\rquote 
\par Next second, she was sobbing her heart out on Lupin\rquote s shoulder.
\par \lquote Molly, it was just a Boggart,\rquote  he said soothingly, patting her on the head. \lquote Just a stupid Boggart ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I see them d \endash  d \endash  dead all the time!\rquote  Mrs Weasley moaned into his shoulder. \lquote All the t \endash  t \endash  time! I d \endash  d \endash  dream about it ...\rquote 
\par Sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the Boggart, pre\-tending to be Harry\rquote s body, had lain. Moody was looking at Harry, who avoided his gaze. He had a funny feeling Moody\rquote 
s magical eye had followed him all the way out of the kitchen.
\par \lquote D \endash  d \endash  don\rquote t tell Arthur,\rquote  Mrs Weasley was gulping now, mopping her eyes frantically with her cuffs. \lquote I d \endash  d \endash  don\rquote t want him to know ... being silly ...\rquote 
\par Lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose.
\par \lquote Harry, I\rquote m so sorry. What must you think of me?\rquote  she said shakily. \lquote Not even able to get rid of a Boggart ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be stupid,\rquote  said Harry, trying to smile.
\par \lquote I\rquote m just s \endash  s \endash  so worried,\rquote  she said, tears spilling out of her eyes again. \lquote Half the f \endash  f \endash  family\rquote s in the Order, it\rquote ll b \endash  b \endash  be a miracle if we all come through t

s going to happen if Arthur and I get killed, who\rquote s g \endash  g \endash  going to look after Ron and Ginny?\rquote 
\par \lquote Molly, that\rquote s enough,\rquote  said Lupin firmly. \lquote This isn\rquote t like last time. The Order is better prepared, we\rquote ve got a head start, we know what Voldemort\rquote s up to \endash \rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name.
\par \lquote Oh, Molly, come on, it\rquote s about time you got used to hearing his name \endash  look, I can\rquote t promise no one\rquote s going to get hurt, nobody can promise that, but we\rquote re much better off than we were last time. You weren
\rquote t in the Order then, you don\rquote t understand. Last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the Death Eaters and they were picking us off one by one ...\rquote 
\par Harry thought of the photograph again, of his parents\rquote  beaming faces. He knew Moody was still watching him.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t worry about Percy,\rquote  said Sirius abruptly. \lquote He\rquote ll come round. It\rquote s only a matter of time before Voldemort moves into the open; once he does, the whole Ministry\rquote 
s going to be begging us to forgive them. And I\rquote m not sure I\rquote ll be accepting their apology,\rquote  he added bitterly.
\par \lquote And as for who\rquote s going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur died,\rquote  said Lupin, smiling slightly, \lquote what do you think we\rquote d do, let them starve?\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley smiled tremulously.
\par \lquote Being silly,\rquote  she muttered again, mopping her eyes.
\par But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later, could not t
hink Mrs Weasley silly. He could still see his parents beaming up at him from the tattered old photograph, unaware that their lives, like so many of those around them, were drawing to a close. The image of the Boggart posing as the corpse of each member o
f Mrs Weasley\rquote s family in turn kept flashing before his eyes.
\par Without warning, the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horribly.
\par \lquote Cut it out,\rquote  he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded.
\par \lquote First sign of madness, talking to your own head,\rquote  said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall.
\par Harry ignored it. He felt older than he had ever felt in his life and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had got a prefect\rquote s badge.

\par There was a lot of commotion in the house. From what he heard as he dressed at top speed, Harry gathered that Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the 
bother of carrying them, with the result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mrs Black and Mrs Weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices.

\par \lquote WILL YOU LOT GET DOWN HERE NOW, PLEASE!\rquote  Mrs Weasley bellowed and Hermione jumped as though scalded and hurried out of the room. Harry seized Hedwig, stuffed her uncere\-mon

\par \lquote Oh honestly ...\rquote  said Mrs Weasley despairingly. \lquote Well, on your own head be it!\rquote 
\par She wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak September sunlight. Harry and the dog followed her. The door slammed behind them and Mrs Black\rquote s screeches were cut off instantly.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Tonks?\rquote  Harry said, looking round as they went down the stone steps of number twelve, which vanished the moment they reached the pavement.
\par \lquote She\rquote s waiting for us just up here,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley stiffly, averting her eyes from the lolloping black dog beside Harry.
\par An old woman greeted them on the corner. She had tightly curled grey hair and wore a purple hat shaped like a pork pie.
\par \lquote Wotcher, Harry,\rquote  she said, winking. \lquote Better hurry up, hadn\rquote t we, Molly?\rquote  she added, checking her watch.
\par \lquote I know, I know,\rquote  moaned Mrs Weasley, lengthening her stride, \lquote but Mad-Eye wanted to wait for Sturgis ... if only Arthur could have got us cars from the Ministry again ... but Fudge won\rquote

Muggles can stand travelling without magic ...\rquote 
\par But the great black dog gave a joyful bark and gambolled around them, snapping at pigeons and chasing its own tail. Harry couldn\rquote t help laughing. Sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time. Mrs Weasley pursed her lips in an almost Au
nt Petunia-ish way.
\par It took them twenty minutes to reach King\rquote s Cross on foot and nothing more eventful happened during that time than Sirius scaring a couple of cats for Harry\rquote s entertainment. Once inside the station they lingered casually beside the barr
ier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear, then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through on to platform nine and three-quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with dep
arting students and their families. Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar ... he was really going back ...
\par \lquote I hope the others make it in time,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley anxiously, staring behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which new arrivals would come.
\par \lquote Nice dog, Harry!\rquote  called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
\par \lquote Thanks, Lee,\rquote  said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail frantically.
\par \lquote Oh good,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, sounding relieved, \lquote here\rquote s Alastor with the luggage, look ...\rquote 
\par A porter\rquote s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came limping through the archway pushing a trolley loaded with their trunks.
\par \lquote All OK,\rquote  he muttered to Mrs Weasley and Tonks, \lquote don\rquote t think we were followed ...\rquote 
\par Seconds later, Mr Weasley emerged on to the platform with Ron and Hermione. They had almost unloaded Moody\rquote s luggage trolley when Fred, George and Ginny turned up with Lupin.
\par \lquote No trouble?\rquote  growled Moody.
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll still be reporting Sturgis to Dumbledore,\rquote  said Moody, \lquote that\rquote s the second time he\rquote s not turned up in a week. Getting as unreliable as Mundungus.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, look after yourselves,\rquote  said Lupin, shaking hands all round. He reached Harry last and gave him a clap on the shoulder. \lquote You too, Harry. Be careful.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, keep your head down and your eyes peeled,\rquote  said Moody, shaking Harry\rquote s hand too. \lquote And don\rquote t forget, all of you \endash  careful what you put in writing. If in doubt, don\rquote t put it in a letter at all.\rquote 

\par \lquote It\rquote s been great meeting all of you,\rquote  said Tonks, hugging Hermione and Ginny. \lquote We\rquote ll see you soon, I expect.\rquote 
\par A warning whistle sounded; the students still on the platform started hurrying on to the train.
\par \lquote Quick, quick,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley distractedly, hugging them at random and catching Harry twice. \lquote Write ... be good ... if you\rquote ve forgotten anything we\rquote ll send it on ... on to the train, now, hurry ...\rquote 
\par For one brief moment, the great black dog reared on to its hind legs and placed its front paws on Harry\rquote s shoulders, but Mrs Weasley shoved Harry away towards the train door, hissing, \lquote For heaven\rquote s sake, act more like a dog, Sirius!
\rquote 
\par \lquote See you!\rquote  Harry called out of the open window as the train began to move, while Ron, Hermione and Ginny waved beside him. The figures of Tonks, Lupin, Moody and Mr and Mrs Weasley shrank 
rapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window, wagging its tail; blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it chasing the train, then they rounded a bend, and Sirius was gone.
\par \lquote He shouldn\rquote t have come with us,\rquote  said Hermione in a worried voice.
\par \lquote Oh, lighten up,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote he hasn\rquote t seen daylight for months, poor bloke.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Fred, clapping his hands together, \lquote can\rquote t stand around chatting all day, we\rquote ve got business to discuss with Lee. See you later,\rquote  and he and George disappeared down the corridor to the right.
\par The train was gathering still more speed, so that the houses out\-side the window flashed past, and they swayed where they stood.
\par \lquote Shall we go and find a compartment, then?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par Ron and Hermione exchanged looks.
\par \lquote Er,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote We\rquote re \endash  well \endash  Ron and I are supposed to go into the prefect carriage,\rquote  Hermione said awkwardly.
\par Ron wasn\rquote t looking at Harry; he seemed to have become intensely interested in the fingernails on his left hand.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Right. Fine.\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think we\rquote ll have to stay there all journey,\rquote  said Hermione quickly. \lquote Our letters said we just get instructions from the Head Boy and Girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time.\rquote 
\par \lquote Fine,\rquote  said Harry again. \lquote Well, I \endash  I might see you later, then.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, definitely,\rquote  said Ron, casting a shifty, anxious look at Harry. \lquote It\rquote s a pain having to go down there, I\rquote d rather \endash  but we have to \endash  I mean, I\rquote m not enjoying it, I\rquote m not Percy,\rquote 
 he finished defiantly.
\par \lquote I know you\rquote re not,\rquote 
 said Harry and he grinned. But as Hermione and Ron dragged their trunks, Crookshanks and a caged Pigwidgeon off towards the engine end of the train, Harry felt an odd sense of loss. He had never travelled on the Hogwarts Express without Ron.
\par \lquote Come on,\rquote  Ginny told him, \lquote if we get a move on we\rquote ll be able to save them places.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry, picking up Hedwig\rquote s cage in one hand and the handle of his trunk in the other. They struggled off down the corridor, peering through the glass-panelled doors into the com\-
partments they passed, which were already full. Harry could not help noticing that a lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their neighbours and pointed him out. After he had met this behaviour in five consec
\-utive carriages he remembered that the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
had been telling its readers all summer what a lying show-off he was. He wondered bleakly whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories.
\par In the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, Harry\rquote s fellow fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on his struggling toad, Trevor.
\par \lquote Hi, Harry,\rquote  he panted. \lquote Hi, Ginny ... everywhere\rquote s full ... I can\rquote t find a seat ...\rquote 
\par \lquote What are you talking about?\rquote  said Ginny, who had squeezed past Neville to peer into the compartment behind him. \lquote There\rquote s room in this one, there\rquote s only Loony Lovegood in here \endash \rquote 
\par Neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be silly,\rquote  said Ginny, laughing, \lquote she\rquote s all right.\rquote 
\par She slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside. Harry and Neville followed.
\par \lquote Hi, Luna,\rquote  said Ginny, \lquote is it OK if we take these seats?\rquote 
\par The girl beside the window looked up. Sh
e had straggly, waist-length, dirty blonde hair, very pale eyebrows and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look. Harry knew at once why Neville had chosen to pass this compartment by. The girl gave off an aura of distinct dottiness. Pe
r
haps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of Butterbeer corks, or that she was reading a magazine upside-down. Her eyes ranged over Neville and came to rest on Harry. Sh
e nodded.
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  said Ginny, smiling at her.
\par Harry and Neville stowed the three trunks and Hedwig\rquote s cage in the luggage rack and sat down. Luna watched them over her upside-down magazine, which was called }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Quibbler. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 She did not seem to need to blink a
s much as normal humans. She stared and stared at Harry, who had taken the seat opposite her and now wished he hadn\rquote t.
\par \lquote Had a good summer, Luna?\rquote  Ginny asked.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Luna dreamily, without taking her eyes off Harry. \lquote Yes, it was quite enjoyable, you know. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 You\rquote re }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Harry Potter,\rquote  she added.
\par \lquote I know I am,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Neville chuckled. Luna turned her pale eyes on him instead.
\par \lquote And I don\rquote t know who you are.\rquote

s magazine; Ginny, who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time, merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy green hat, but Harry, whose hands had been busy preventing Trevor\rquote

\par Neville, whose face and torso were also drenched, shook his head to get the worst out of his eyes.

 he added nervously, as Harry spat a mouthful on to the floor.
\par At that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open.
\par \lquote Oh ... hello, Harry,\rquote  said a nervous voice. \lquote Um ... bad time?\rquote 
\par Harry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his Trevor-free hand. A very pretty girl with long, shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling at him: Cho Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team.
\par \lquote Oh ... hi,\rquote  said Harry blankly.
\par \lquote Um ...\rquote  said Cho. \lquote Well ... just thought I\rquote d say hello ... bye then.\rquote 
\par Rather pink in the face, she closed the door and departed. Harry slumped back in his seat and groaned. He would have liked Cho to discover him sitting with a group of v

\par Ron and Hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which time the food trolley had already gone by. Harry, Ginny and Neville had finishe

\par \lquote Are you taking the mickey?\rquote  said Ron, frowning at her.

s hands. Riffling through it to page fifty-seven, she turned it resolutely upside-down again and disappeared behind it, just as the compartment door opened for the third time.
\par Harry looked around; he had expected this, but that did not make the sight of Draco Malfoy smirking at him from between his cronies Crabbe and Goyle any more enjoyable.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  he said aggressively, before Malfoy could open his mouth.
\par \lquote Manners, Potter, or I\rquote ll have to give you a detention,\rquote  drawled Malfoy, whose sleek blond hair and pointed chin were just like his father\rquote s. \lquote

\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.\rquote

\par \lquote Shut up, Malfoy,\rquote  said Hermione sharply.

\par \lquote Get out!\rquote  said Hermione, standing up.
\par Sniggering, Malfoy gave Harry a last malicious look and departed, with Crabbe and Goyle lumbering along in his w
ake. Hermione slammed the compartment door behind them and turned to look at Harry, who knew at once that she, like him, had registered what Malfoy had said and been just as unnerved by it.
\par \lquote Chuck us another Frog,\rquote  said Ron, who had clearly noticed nothing.
\par Harry could not talk freely in front of Neville and Luna. He exchanged another nervous look with Hermione, then stared out of the window.
\par He had thought Sirius coming with him to the station was a bit of a laugh, but suddenly it seemed reckless, if not downright dan\-
gerous ... Hermione had been right ... Sirius should not have come. What if Mr Malfoy had noticed the black dog and told Draco? What if he had deduced that the Weasleys, Lupin, Tonks and Moody knew where Sirius was hiding? Or had Malfoy\rquote s use 
of the word \lquote dogging\rquote  been a coincidence?
\par The weather remained undecided as they travelled further and further north. Rain spattered the windows in a half-hearted way, then the sun put in a feeble appearance before clouds drifted over it once more. When da
rkness fell and lamps came on inside the carriages, Luna rolled up }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Quibbler, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
put it carefully away in her bag and took to staring at everyone in the compartment instead.
\par Harry was sitting with his forehead pressed against the train window, trying to get a first distant glimpse of Hogwarts, but it was a moonless night and the rain-streaked window was grimy.
\par \lquote We\rquote d better change,\rquote  said Hermione at last. She and Ron pinned their prefect badges carefully to their chests. Harry saw Ron checking his reflection in the black window.
\par At last, the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket up and down it as everybody scrambled to get their luggage \line \line and pets assembled, ready to get off. As Ron and Hermione were supposed to supervise all this, they dis
appeared from the carriage again, leaving Harry and the others to look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll carry that owl, if you like,\rquote  said Luna to Harry, reaching out for Pigwidgeon as Neville stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket.
\par \lquote Oh \endash  er \endash  thanks,\rquote  said Harry, handing her the cage and hoisting Hedwig\rquote s more securely into his arms.
\par They shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the night air on their faces as they joined the crowd in the cor\-ridor. Slowly, they moved towards 
the doors. Harry could smell the pine trees that lined the path down to the lake. He stepped down on to the platform and looked around, listening for the familiar call of \lquote firs\rquote -years over \rquote ere ... firs\rquote -years ...\rquote 

\par But it did not come. Instead, a quite different voice, a brisk female one, was calling out, \lquote First-years line up over here, please! All first-years to me!\rquote 
\par A lantern came swinging towards Harry and by its light he saw the prominent chin and severe haircut of Professor Grubbly-Plank, the witch who had taken over Hagrid\rquote s Care of Magical Creatures lessons for a while the previous year.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Hagrid?\rquote  he said out loud.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Ginny, \lquote but we\rquote d better get out of the way, we\rquote re blocking the door.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yeah ...\rquote 
\par Harry and Ginny became separated as they moved off along the platform and out through the station. Jostled by the crowd, Harry squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of Hagrid; he had to be here, Harry had been relying on it \endash 
 seeing Hagrid again was one of the things he\rquote d been looking forward to most. But there was no sign of him.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 He can\rquote t have left, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
Harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway on to the road outside with the rest of the crowd. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 He\rquote s just got a cold or something }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 ...
\par He looked around for R
on or Hermione, wanting to know what they thought about the reappearance of Professor Grubbly-Plank, but neither of them was anywhere near him, so he allowed himself to be shunted forwards on to the dark rain-washed road outside Hogsmeade station.
\par Here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always took the students above first year up to the castle. Harry glanced quickly at them, turned away to keep a lookout for Ron and Hermione, then did a double-take.
\par The coaches were no longer horseless. Th
ere were creatures standing between the carriage shafts. If he had had to give them a name, he supposed he would have called them horses, though there was something reptilian about them, too. They were completely fleshless, their black coats clinging to t
heir skeletons, of which every bone was visible. Their heads were dragonish, and their pupil-less eyes white and staring. Wings sprouted from each wither \endash 
 vast, black leathery wings that looked as though they ought to belong to giant bats. Standing still a
nd quiet in the gloom, the creatures looked eerie and sinister. Harry could not understand why the coaches were being pulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of moving along by themselves.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Pig?\rquote  said Ron\rquote s voice, right behind Harry.
\par \lquote That Luna girl was carrying him,\rquote  said Harry, turning quickly, eager to consult Ron about Hagrid. \lquote Where d\rquote you reckon \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  Hagrid is? I dunno,\rquote  said Ron, sounding worried. \lquote He\rquote d better be OK ...\rquote 
\par A short distance away, Draco Malfoy, followed by a small gang of cronies including Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy Parkinson, was pushing some timid-looking second-years out of the way so that he and his friends could get a coach to themselves. Seconds later, Her
mione emerged panting from the crowd.
\par \lquote Malfoy was being absolutely foul to a first-year back there. I swear I\rquote m going to report him, he\rquote s only had his badge three min\-utes and he\rquote s using it to bully people worse than ever ... where\rquote s Crookshanks?\rquote 

\par \lquote Ginny\rquote s got him,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote There she is ...\rquote 
\par Ginny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a squirming Crookshanks.
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  said Hermione, relieving Ginny of the cat. \lquote Come on, let\rquote s get a carriage together before they all fill up ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I haven\rquote t got Pig yet!\rquote  Ron said, but Hermione was already heading off towards the nearest unoccupied coach. Harry remained behind with Ron.
\par \lquote What }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 those things, d\rquote you reckon?\rquote 
 he asked Ron, nodding at the horrible horses as the other students surged past them.
\par \lquote What things?\rquote 
\par \lquote Those horse \endash \rquote 
\par Luna appeared holding Pigwidgeon\rquote s cage in her arms; the tiny owl was twittering excitedly as usual.
\par \lquote Here you are,\rquote  she said. \lquote He\rquote s a sweet little owl, isn\rquote t he?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ... yeah ... he\rquote s all right,\rquote  said Ron gruffly. \lquote Well, come on then, let\rquote s get in ... what were you saying, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote I was saying, what are those horse things?\rquote  Harry said, as he, Ron and Luna made for the carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were already sitting.
\par \lquote What horse things?\rquote 
\par \lquote The horse things pulling the carriages!\rquote  said Harry impatiently. They were, after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was watching them with empty white eyes. Ron, however, gave Harry a perplexed look.
\par \lquote What are you talking about?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m talking about \endash  look!\rquote 
\par Harry grabbed Ron\rquote s arm and wheeled him about so that he was face to face with the winged horse. Ron stared straight at it for a second, then looked back at Harry.
\par \lquote What am I supposed to be looking at?\rquote 
\par \lquote At the \endash  there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! It\rquote s right there in front \endash \rquote 
\par But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred to Harry.
\par \lquote Can\rquote t ... can\rquote t you see them?\rquote 
\par \lquote See what?\rquote 
\par \lquote Can\rquote t you see what\rquote s pulling the carriages?\rquote 
\par Ron looked seriously alarmed now.
\par \lquote Are you feeling all right, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote I ... yeah ...\rquote 
\par Harry felt utterly bewildered. The horse was there in front of him, gleaming solidly in the dim light issuing from the station win\-dows behind them, vapour rising from its nostrils in the chilly night air. Yet, unless Ron was faking \endash  and it w
as a very feeble joke if he was \endash  Ron could not see it at all.
\par \lquote Shall we get in, then?\rquote  said Ron uncertainly, looking at Harry as though worried about him.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Yeah, go on ...\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s all right,\rquote  said a dreamy voice from beside Harry as Ron van\-ished into the coach\rquote s dark interior. \lquote You\rquote re not going mad or any\-thing. I can see them, too.\rquote 
\par \lquote Can you?\rquote  said Harry desperately, turning to Luna. He could see the bat-winged horses reflected in her wide silvery eyes.
\par \lquote Oh, yes,\rquote  said Luna, \lquote I\rquote ve been able to see them ever since my first day here. They\rquote ve always pulled the carriages. Don\rquote t worry. You\rquote re just as sane as I am.\rquote 
\par Smiling faintly, she climbed into the musty interior of the car\-riage after Ron. Not altogether reassured, Harry followed her.

Harry did not want to tell the others that he and Luna were having the same hallucination, if that was what it was, so he said nothing more about the horses as he sa
t down inside the carriage and slammed the door behind him. Nevertheless, he could not help watching the silhouettes of the horses moving beyond the window.

\par \lquote I\rquote ll be quite glad if he has,\rquote  said Luna, \lquote he isn\rquote t a very good teacher, is he?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, he is!\rquote  said Harry, Ron and Ginny angrily.
\par Harry glared at Hermione. She cleared her throat and quickly said, \lquote Erm ... yes ... he\rquote s very good.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, we in Ravenclaw think he\rquote s a bit of a joke,\rquote  said Luna, unfazed.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve got a rubbish sense of humour then,\rquote  Ron snapped, as the wheels below them creaked into motion.
\par Luna did not seem perturbed by Ron\rquote s rudeness; on the con\-trary, she simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly interesting television programme.
\par Rattling and swaying, the carriages moved in convoy up the road. When they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars on either side of the gates to the schoo
l grounds, Harry leaned forwards to try and see whether there were any lights on in Hagrid\rquote 
s cabin by the Forbidden Forest, but the grounds were in complete darkness. Hogwarts Castle, however, loomed ever closer: a towering mass of turrets, jet black against the dark sky, here and there a window blazing fiery bright above them.
\par The carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the oak front doors and Harry got out of the carriage first. He turned again to look for lit windows down by the Forest, but there was definitely no sign of life within Hagrid\rquote 
s cabin. Unwillingly, because he had half-hoped they would have vanished, he turned his eyes instead upon the strange, skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night air, their blank white eyes gleaming.
\par Harry had once before had the experience of seeing someth
ing that Ron could not, but that had been a reflection in a mirror, something much more insubstantial than a hundred very solid-looking beasts strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages. If Luna was to be believed, the beasts had always been there but inv
isible. Why, then, could Harry suddenly see them, and why could Ron not?
\par \lquote Are you coming or what?\rquote  said Ron beside him.
\par \lquote Oh ... yeah,\rquote  said Harry quickly and they joined the crowd hurry\-ing up the stone steps into the castle.
\par The Entrance Hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with footsteps as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double doors to the right, leading to the Great Hall and the start-of-term feast.
\par The four long house tables in the Great Hall were filling up under the starless 
black ceiling, which was just like the sky they could glimpse through the high windows. Candles floated in midair all along the tables, illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted about the Hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly, exchangin
g summer news, shouting greetings at friends from other houses, eyeing one another\rquote 
s new haircuts and robes. Again, Harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as he passed; he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor cared.
\par Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table. The moment they reached Gryffindor\rquote s, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth-years and left to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville found seats together about halfway down the table
 between Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor house ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom gave Harry airy, overly-friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had stopped talking about him a split second before. He had more
 important things to worry about, however: he was looking over the students\rquote  heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.
\par \lquote He\rquote s not there.\rquote 
\par Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real need; Hagrid\rquote s size made him instantly obvious in any line\-up.
\par \lquote He can\rquote t have left,\rquote  said Ron, sounding slightly anxious.
\par \lquote Of course he hasn\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry firmly.
\par \lquote You don\rquote t think he\rquote s ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 hurt, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 or anything, do you?\rquote 
 said Hermione uneasily.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry at once.
\par \lquote But where is he, then?\rquote 
\par There was a pause, then Harry said very quietly, so that Neville, Parvati and Lavender could not hear, \lquote Maybe he\rquote s not back yet. You know \endash  from his mission \endash  the thing he was doing over the summer for Dumbledore.\rquote 

\par \lquote Yeah ... yeah, that\rquote ll be it,\rquote  said Ron, sounding reassured, but Hermione bit her lip, looking up and down the staff table as though hoping for some conclusive explanation of Hagrid\rquote s absence.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 that?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
she said sharply, pointing towards the middle of the staff table.
\par Harry\rquote s eyes followed hers. They lit first upon Professor Dumbledore, sitting in his high-backed golden chair at the centre of the long staff table, wearing deep-purple robes scattered with silvery stars and a matching hat. Dumbledore\rquote 
s head was inclined towards the woman sitting next to him, who was talking into his ear. She looked, Harry thought, like somebody\rquote 
s maiden aunt: squat, with short, curly, mouse-brown hair in which she had placed a horrible pink Alice band that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she wore ov
er her robes. Then she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw, with a shock of recognition, a pallid, toadlike face and a pair of prominent, pouchy eyes.
\par \lquote It\rquote s that Umbridge woman!\rquote 
\par \lquote Who?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote She was at my hearing, she works for Fudge!\rquote 
\par \lquote Nice cardigan,\rquote  said Ron, smirking.
\par \lquote She works for Fudge!\rquote  Hermione repeated, frowning. \lquote What on earth\rquote s she doing here, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dunno ...\rquote 
\par Hermione scanned the staff table, her eyes narrowed.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  she muttered, \lquote no, surely not ...\rquote 
\par Harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not ask; his attention had been caught by Professor Grubbly-Plank who had just appeared behind the staff table; she worked her way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been 
Hagrid\rquote 
s. That meant the first-years must have crossed the lake and reached the castle, and sure enough, a few seconds later, the doors from the Entrance Hall opened. A long line of scared-looking first-years entered, led by Professor McGonagall, who was ca
rrying a stool on which sat an ancient wizard\rquote s hat, heavily patched and darned with a wide rip near the frayed brim.
\par The buzz of talk in the Great Hall faded away. The first-years lined up in front of the staff table facing the rest of the students, and Professor McGonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them, then stood back.
\par The first-years\rquote  faces glowed palely in the candlelight. A small boy right in the middle of the row looked as though he was trem\-bling. Harry recalled, fleetingly, how te
rrified he had felt when he had stood there, waiting for the unknown test that would deter\-mine to which house he belonged.
\par The whole school waited with bated breath. Then the rip near the hat\rquote s brim opened wide like a mouth and the Sorting Hat burst into song:

The Hat became motionless once more; applause broke out, though it was punctured, for the first time in Harry\rquote s memory, with mut\-tering and whispers. All across the G
reat Hall students were exchanging remarks with their neighbours, and Harry, clapping along with everyone else, knew exactly what they were talking about.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Branched out a bit this year, hasn\rquote t it?\rquote 
 said Ron, his eyebrows raised.
\par \lquote Too right it has,\rquote  said Harry.
\par The Sorting Hat usually confined itself to describing the dif\-ferent qualities looked for by each of the four Hogwarts houses and its own role in Sorting them. Harry could not remember it ever trying to give the school advice before.
\par \lquote I wonder if it\rquote s ever given warnings before?\rquote  said Hermione, sounding slightly anxious.
\par \lquote Yes, indeed,\rquote  said Nearly Headless Nick knowledgeably, leaning across Neville towards her (Neville winced; it was very uncom\-fortable to have a ghost lean through you). \lquote The Hat feels
 itself honour-bound to give the school due warning whenever it feels \endash \rquote 
\par But Professor McGonagall, who was waiting to read out the list of first-years\rquote  names, was giving the whispering students the sort of look that scorches. Nearly Headless Nick placed a 
see-through finger to his lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt end. With a last frowning look that swept the four house tables, Professor McGonagall lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment and called out the first n
ame.
\par \lquote Abercrombie, Euan.\rquote 
\par The terrified-looking boy Harry had noticed earlier stumbled forwards and put the Hat on his head; it was only prevented from falling right down to his shoulders by his very prominent ears. The Hat considered for a moment, then the
 rip near the brim opened again and shouted:
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Gryffindor!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Harry clapped loudly with the rest of Gryffindor house as Euan Abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down, looking as though he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be looked at again.
\par Slowly, the long line of first-years thinned. In the pauses between the names and the Sorting Hat\rquote s decisions, Harry could hear Ron\rquote s stomach rumbling loudly. Finally, \lquote Zeller, Rose\rquote 
 was Sorted into Hufflepuff, and Professor McGonagall picked up the Hat and stool and marched them away as Professor Dumbledore rose to his feet.
\par Whatever his recent bitter feelings had been towards his Headmaster, Harry was somehow soothed to see Dumbledore standing before them all. Between the absence of Hagrid 
and the presence of those dragonish horses, he had felt that his return to Hogwarts, so long anticipated, was full of unexpected surprises, like jarring notes in a familiar song. But this, at least, was how it was supposed to be: their Headmaster rising t
o greet them all before the start-of-term feast.
\par \lquote To our newcomers,\rquote  said Dumbledore in a ringing voice, his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips, \lquote welcome! To our old hands \endash  welcome back! There is a time for speech-making, but this is not it. Tuck in!\rquote 

\par There was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as Dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as to keep it out of the way of his plate \endash  for food had appeared out of nowhere, so that the five long tab
les were groaning under joints and pies and dishes of vegetables, bread and sauces and flagons of pumpkin juice.
\par \lquote Excellent,\rquote  said Ron, with a kind of groan of longing, and he seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them on to his plate, watched wistfully by Nearly Headless Nick.
\par \lquote What were you saying before the Sorting?\rquote  Hermione asked the ghost. \lquote About the Hat giving warnings?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yes,\rquote  said Nick, who seemed glad of a reason to turn away from Ron, who was now eating roast potatoes with almost indecent enthusiasm. \lquote 
Yes, I have heard the Hat give several warnings before, always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school. And always, of course, its advice is the same: stand together, be strong from within.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat?\rquote  said Ron.
\par His mouth was so full Harry thought it was quite an achieve\-ment for him to make any noise at all.
\par \lquote I beg your pardon?\rquote  said Nearly Headless Nick politely, while Hermione looked revolted. Ron gave an enormous swallow and said, \lquote How can it know if the school\rquote s in danger if it\rquote s a Hat?\rquote 
\par \lquote I have no idea,\rquote  said Nearly Headless Nick. \lquote Of course, it lives in Dumbledore\rquote s office, so I daresay it picks things up there.\rquote 
\par \lquote And it wants all the houses to be friends?\rquote  said Harry, looking over at the Slytherin table, where Draco Malfoy was holding court. \lquote Fat chance.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, now, you shouldn\rquote t take that attitude,\rquote  said Nick reprov\-ingly. \lquote Peaceful co-operation, that\rquote 
s the key. We ghosts, though we belong to separate houses, maintain links of friendship. In spite of the competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I would never dream of seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron.\rquote 
\par \lquote Only because you\rquote re terrified of him,\rquote  said Ron.
\par Nearly Headless Nick looked highly affronted.
\par \lquote Terrified? I hope I, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, have never been guilty of cowardice in my life! The noble blood that runs in my veins \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What blood?\rquote  asked Ron. \lquote Surely you haven\rquote t still got \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s a figure of speech!\rquote  said Nearly Headless Nick, now so annoyed his head was trembling ominously on his partially severed neck. \lquote I assume I am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever words I like, even if 
the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me! But I am quite used to students poking fun at my death, I assure you!\rquote 
\par \lquote Nick, he wasn\rquote t really laughing at you!\rquote  said Hermione, throwing a furious look at Ron.
\par Unfortunately, Ron\rquote s mouth was packed to exploding point again and all he could manage was \lquote Node iddum eentup sechew,\rquote 
 which Nick did not seem to think constituted an adequate apology. Rising into the air, he straightened his feathered hat and swept away from them to the other end of the table, coming to rest between the Creevey brothers, Colin and Dennis.
\par \lquote Well done, Ron,\rquote  snapped Hermione.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Ron indignantly, having managed, finally, to swallow his food. \lquote I\rquote m not allowed to ask a simple question?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, forget it,\rquote  said Hermione irritably, and the pair of them spent the rest of the meal in huffy silence.
\par Harry was too used to their bickering to bother trying to recon\-cile them; he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his way steadily through his steak and kidney pie, then a large plateful of his favourite treacle tart.
\par When all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the Hall was starting to creep upwards again, Dumbledore got to his feet once more. Talking ceased immediately as all turned to face the Headmaster. Harry
 was feeling pleasantly drowsy now. His four-poster bed was waiting somewhere above, wonderfully warm and soft ...
\par \lquote Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote 
First-years ought to know that the Forest in the grounds is out-of-bounds to students \endash  and a few of our older students ought to know by now, too.\rquote  (Harry, Ron and Hermione exchanged smirks.)
\par \lquote Mr Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for wha
t he tells me is the four-hundred-and-sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other things, all of which can be checked on the exten\-sive list now fastened to Mr Filch\rquote 
s office door.
\par \lquote 
We have had two changes in staffing this year. We are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge, our new Defence Against the Dark Art
s teacher.\rquote 
\par There was a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic applause, during which Harry, Ron and Hermione exchanged slightly panicked looks; Dumbledore had not said for how long Grubbly-Plank would be teaching.
\par Dumbledore continued, \lquote Tryouts for the house Quidditch teams will take place on the \endash \rquote 
\par He broke off, looking enquiringly at Professor Umbridge. As she was not much taller standing than sitting, there was a moment when nobody understood why Dumbledore had stopped talking, but then Professor Umbridge cleared her throat, }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Hem, hem,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
and it became clear that she had got to her feet and was intending to make a speech.
\par Dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment, then he sat down smartly and looked alertly at Professor Umbridge as though he desir
ed nothing better than to listen to her talk. Other members of staff were not as adept at hiding their surprise. Professor Sprout\rquote s eyebrows had disappeared into her flyaway hair and Professor McGonagall\rquote 
s mouth was as thin as Harry had ever seen it. No new teacher had ever interrupted Dumbledore before. Many of the students were smirking; this woman obviously did not know how things were done at Hogwarts.
\par \lquote Thank you, Headmaster,\rquote  Professor Umbridge simpered, \lquote for those kind words of welcome.\rquote 
\par Her voice was high-pitched, breathy and little-girlish and, again, Harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that he could not explain to himself; all he knew was that he loathed everything about her, from her stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan. She gav
e another little throat-clearing cough }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 (\lquote hem, hem\rquote ) }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and continued.

\par \lquote Well, it is lovely to be back at Hogwarts, I must say!\rquote  She smiled, revealing very pointed teeth. \lquote And to see such happy little faces looking up at me!\rquote 
\par Harry glanced around. None of the faces he could see looked happy. On the contrary, they all looked rather taken-aback at being addressed as though they were five years old.
\par \lquote I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all and I\rquote m sure we\rquote ll be very good friends!\rquote 
\par Students exchanged looks at this; some of them were barely concealing grins.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll be her friend as long as I don\rquote t have to borrow that cardigan,\rquote  Parvati whispered to Lavender, and both of them lapsed into silent giggles.
\par Professor Umbridge cleared her throat again }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 (\lquote hem, hem\rquote ), }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
but when she continued, some of the breathiness had vanished from her voice. She sounded much more businesslike and now her words had a dull learned-by-heart sound to them.
\par \lquote The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches
 and wizards to be of vital importance. The rare gifts with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful instruction. The ancient skills unique to the wizarding community must be passed down the generations lest we lose the
m for ever. The treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our ancestors must be guarded, replenished and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching.\rquote 
\par Professor Umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her fellow staff members, none of whom bowed back to her. Professor McGonagall\rquote 
s dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively hawklike, and Harry distinctly saw her exchange a sig\-nificant glance with Professor Sprout as Umbridge gave another little }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote hem, hem\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and went on with her speech.
\par \lquote Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school, and that is as it should be, for without progress there will be stag\-nation and decay. There a
gain, progress for progress\rquote s sake must be discouraged, for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering. A balance, then, between old and new, between per\-manence and change, between tradition and innovation ...\rquote 
\par Harry found his attentivenes
s ebbing, as though his brain was slipping in and out of tune. The quiet that always filled the Hall when Dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put their heads together, whispering and giggling. Over on the Ravenclaw table Cho Chang was chat
ting animatedly with her friends. A few seats along from Cho, Luna Lovegood had got out }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Quibbler }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 again. Meanwhile, at the Hufflepuff table Ernie Macmillan was one of the few still staring at Professor Umbridge, but he was glassy-eyed and Harry was sure 
he was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new prefect\rquote s badge gleaming on his chest.
\par Professor Umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her audience. Harry had the impression that a full-scale riot could have broken out un
der her nose and she would have ploughed on with her speech. The teachers, however, were still listening very attentively, and Hermione seemed to be drinking in every word Umbridge spoke, though, judging by her expression, they were not at all to her tast
e.
\par \lquote 
... because some changes will be for the better, while others will come, in the fullness of time, to be recognised as errors of judgement. Meanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandon
ed. Let us move forward, then, into a new era of openness, effective\-ness and accountability, intent on preserving what ought to be pre\-served, perfecting what needs to be perfected, and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited.
\rquote 
\par She 
sat down. Dumbledore clapped. The staff followed his lead, though Harry noticed that several of them brought their hands together only once or twice before stopping. A few students joined in, but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech, not 
having listened to more than a few words of it, and before they could start applauding properly, Dumbledore had stood up again.
\par \lquote Thank you very much, Professor Umbridge, that was most illu\-minating,\rquote  he said, bowing to her. \lquote Now, as I was saying, Quidditch tryouts will be held ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, it certainly was illuminating,\rquote  said Hermione in a low voice.
\par \lquote You\rquote re not telling me you enjoyed it?\rquote  Ron said quietly, turning a glazed face towards Hermione. \lquote That was about the dullest speech I\rquote ve ever heard, and }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote I said illuminating, not enjoyable,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote It explained a lot.\rquote 
\par \lquote Did it?\rquote  said Harry in surprise. \lquote Sounded like a load of waffle to me.\rquote 
\par \lquote There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle,\rquote  said Hermione grimly.
\par \lquote Was there?\rquote  said Ron blankly.
\par \lquote How about: \'93progress for progress\rquote s sake must be discouraged\'94? How about: \'93pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited\'94?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, what does that mean?\rquote  said Ron impatiently.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll tell you what it means,\rquote  said Hermione ominously. \lquote It means the Ministry\rquote s interfering at Hogwarts.\rquote 
\par There was a great clattering and banging all around them; Dumbledore had obviously just dismissed the school, because everyone was standing up ready to leave the Hall. Hermione jumped up, looking flustered.
\par \lquote Ron, we\rquote re supposed to show the first-years where to go!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yeah,\rquote  said Ron, who had obviously forgotten. \lquote Hey \endash  hey, you lot! Midgets!\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Ron!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par \lquote I know, but you can\rquote t call them midgets! \endash  First-years!\rquote  Hermione called commandingly along the table. \lquote This way, please!\rquote 
\par A group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables, all of them trying hard not to lead the group. They did indeed seem very small; Harry was sure 
he had not appeared that young when he had arrived here. He grinned at them. A blond boy next to Euan Abercrombie looked petrified; he nudged Euan and whispered something in his ear. Euan Abercrombie looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at
 Harry, who felt the grin slide off his face like Stinksap.
\par \lquote See you later,\rquote  he said to Ron and Hermione and he made his way out of the Great Hall alone, doing everything he could to ignore more whispering, staring and pointing as he passed. He kept his eye
s fixed ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the Entrance Hall, then he hurried up the marble staircase, took a couple of concealed short cuts and had soon left most of the crowds behind.
\par He had been stupid not to expect this, he thought angrily a
s he walked through the much emptier upstairs corridors. Of course everyone was staring at him; he had emerged from the Triwizard maze two months previously clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming to have seen Lord Voldemort return to pow
er. There had not been time last term to explain himself before they\rquote d all had to go home \endash  even if he had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the terrible events in that graveyard.
\par Harry had reached the end of the corridor to the Gryffindor common room and come to a halt in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady before he realised that he did not know the new password.
\par \lquote Er ...\rquote  he said glumly, staring up at the Fat Lady, who smoothed the folds of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at him.
\par \lquote No password, no entrance,\rquote  she said loftily.
\par \lquote Harry, I know it!\rquote  Someone panted up behind him and he turned to see Neville jogging towards him. \lquote Guess what it is? I\rquote m actually going to be able to remember it for once \endash \rquote  He waved the stunted li
ttle cactus he had shown them on the train. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Mimbulus mimble\-tonia!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Correct,\rquote  said the Fat Lady, and her portrait swung open towards them like a door, revealing a circular hole in the wall behind, through which Harry and Neville now climbed.
\par The Gryffind
or common room looked as welcoming as ever, a cosy circular tower room full of dilapidated squashy armchairs and rickety old tables. A fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people were warming their hands by it before going up to their dormito
ries; on the other side of the room Fred and George Weasley were pinning something up on the noticeboard. Harry waved good\-night to them and headed straight for the door to the boys\rquote  dor\-
mitories; he was not in much of a mood for talking at the moment. Neville followed him.
\par Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan had reached the dormitory first and were in the process of covering the walls beside their beds with posters and photographs. They had been talking as Harry pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the mom
ent they saw him. Harry wondered whether they had been talking about him, then whether he was being paranoid.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  he said, moving across to his own trunk and opening it.
\par \lquote Hey, Harry,\rquote  said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pyjamas in the West Ham colours. \lquote Good holiday?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not bad,\rquote  muttered Harry, as a true account of his holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it. \lquote You?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, it was OK,\rquote  chuckled Dean. \lquote Better than Seamus\rquote s, anyway, he was just telling me.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why, what happened, Seamus?\rquote  Neville asked as he placed his }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Mimbulus mimbletonia }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 tenderly on his bedside cabinet.
\par Seamus did not answer immediately; he was making rather a meal of ensuring that his poster of the Kenmare Kestrels Quidditch team was quite straight. Then he said, with his back still turned to Harry, \lquote Me mam didn\rquote t want me to come back.
\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry, pausing in the act of pulling off his robes.
\par \lquote She didn\rquote t want me to come back to Hogwarts.\rquote 
\par Seamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pyjamas out of his trunk, still not looking at Harry.
\par \lquote But \endash  why?\rquote  said Harry, astonished. He knew that Seamus\rquote s mother was a witch and could not understand, therefore, why she should have come over so Dursleyish.
\par Seamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his pyjamas.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  he said in a measured voice, \lquote I suppose ... because of you.\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean?\rquote  said Harry quickly.
\par His heart was beating rather fast. He felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry\rquote s eye, \lquote she ... er ... well, it\rquote s not just you, it\rquote s Dumbledore, too ...\rquote 
\par \lquote She believes the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said Harry. \lquote She thinks I
\rquote m a liar and Dumbledore\rquote s an old fool?\rquote 
\par Seamus looked up at him.
\par \lquote Yeah, something like that.\rquote 
\par Harry said nothing. He threw his wand down on to his bedside table, pulled off his robes, stuffed them angrily into his trunk and pulled on his pyjamas. He was sick of it; sick of being the person who is stared at and talked about all the time. If any of 
them knew, if any of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these things had happened to ... Mrs Finnigan had no idea, the stupid woman, he thought savagely.
\par He got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him, but before he could do so, Seamus said, \lquote Look ... what }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 did }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 happen that night when ... you know, when ... with Cedric Diggory and all?\rquote 
\par Seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time. Dean, who had been bending over his trunk trying to retrieve a slipper, went oddly still and Harry knew he was listening hard.
\par \lquote What are you asking me for?\rquote  Harry retorted. \lquote Just read the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Don\rquote t you have a go at my mother,\rquote  Seamus snapped.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t talk to me like that!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll talk to you how I want,\rquote  said Harry, his temper rising so fast he snatched his wand back from his bedside table. \lquote If you\rquote 
ve got a problem sharing a dormitory with me, go and ask McGonagall if you can be moved ... stop your mummy worrying \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Leave my mother out of this, Potter!\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s going on?\rquote 
\par Ron had appeared in the doorway. His wide eyes travelled from Harry, who was kneeling on his bed with his wand pointing at Seamus, to Seamus, who was standing there with his fists raised.
\par \lquote He\rquote s having a go at my mother!\rquote  Seamus yelled.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Harry wouldn\rquote t do that \endash  we met your mother, we liked her ...\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s before she started believing every word the stinking }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 writes about me!\rquote  said Harry at the top of his voice.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Ron, comprehension dawning across his freckled face. \lquote Oh ... right.\rquote 
\par \lquote You know what?\rquote  said Seamus heatedly, casting Harry a venom\-ous look. \lquote He\rquote s right, I don\rquote t want to share a dormitory with him any more, he\rquote s mad.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s out of order, Seamus,\rquote  said Ron, whose ears were starting to glow red \endash  always a danger sign.
\par \lquote Out of order, am I?\rquote  shouted Seamus, who in contrast with Ron was going pale. \lquote You believe all the rubbish he\rquote s come out with about You-Know-Who, do you, you reckon he\rquote s telling the truth?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I do!\rquote  said Ron angrily.
\par \lquote Then you\rquote re mad, too,\rquote  said Seamus in disgust.
\par \lquote Yeah? Well, unfortunately for you, pal, I\rquote m also a prefect!\rquote  said Ron, jabbing himself in the chest with a finger. \lquote So unless you want detention, watch your mouth!\rquote 
\par Seamus looked for a few seconds as though detention would be 
a reasonable price to pay to say what was going through his mind; but with a noise of contempt he turned on his heel, vaulted into bed and pulled the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and fell in a dusty pile to the floor
. Ron glared at Seamus, then looked at Dean and Neville.
\par \lquote Anyone else\rquote s parents got a problem with Harry?\rquote  he said aggres\-sively.
\par \lquote My parents are Muggles, mate,\rquote  said Dean, shrugging. \lquote They don\rquote t know nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts, because I\rquote m not stupid enough to tell them.\rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t know my mother, she\rquote d weasel anything out of anyone!\rquote  Seamus snapped at him. \lquote Anyway, your parents don\rquote t get the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
Daily Prophet. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 They don\rquote t know our Headmaster\rquote s been sacked from the Wizengamot and the International Confederation of Wizards because he\rquote 
s losing his marbles \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote My gran says that\rquote s rubbish,\rquote  piped up Neville. \lquote She says it\rquote s the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

limbed into bed and pulled the covers up to his chin, looking owlishly over them at Seamus. \lquote My gran\rquote s always said You-Know-Who would come back one day. She says if Dumbledore says he\rquote s back, he\rquote s back.\rquote 
\par Harry felt a rush of gratitude towards Neville. Nobody else said anything. Seamus got out his wand, repaired the bed hangings and vanished behind them. Dean got into bed, rolled over and fell silent. Neville, who appeared to have nothing more to say eithe
r, was gazing fondly at his moonlit cactus.
\par Harry lay back on his pillows while Ron bustled around the next bed, putting his things away. He felt shaken by the argument with Seamus, whom he had always liked very much. How many more people were going to suggest that he was lying, or unhinged?
\par Had Dumbledore suffered like this all summer, as first the Wizengamot, then the International Confederation of Wizards had thrown him from their ranks? Was it anger at Harry, perhaps, that had stopped Dumbledore getting 
in touch with him for months? The two of them were in this together, after all; Dumbledore had believed Harry, announced his version of events to the whole school and then to the wider wizarding community. Anyone who thought Harry was a liar had to think 
that Dumbledore was, too, or else that Dumbledore had been hoodwinked ...
\par They\rquote ll know we\rquote re right in the end, thought Harry miserably, as Ron got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormi\-tory. But he wondered how many more attacks like Seamus\rquote s he would have to endure before that time came.

\par \lquote Anyway, what\rquote s up, Harry?\rquote  Hermione continued, as they walked down a flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wiz\-ards, all of whom ignored them, being engrossed in their own con\-versation. \lquote 
You look really angry about something.\rquote 
\par \lquote Seamus reckons Harry\rquote s lying about You-Know-Who,\rquote  said Ron succinctly, when Harry did not respond.
\par Hermione, who Harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf, sighed.
\par \lquote Yes, Lavender thinks so too,\rquote  she said gloomily.
\par \lquote Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I\rquote m a lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?\rquote  Harry said loudly.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Hermione calmly. \lquote I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats, Harry, because in case you haven\rquote

\par There was a short pause.
\par \lquote Sorry,\rquote  said Harry in a low voice.
\par \lquote That\rquote s quite all right,\rquote  said Hermione with dignity. Then she shook her head. \lquote Don\rquote t you remember what Dumbledore said at the last end-of-term feast?\rquote

\par \lquote How do you remember stuff like that?\rquote  asked Ron, looking at her in admiration.

\par \lquote Well, I think it\rquote s a pity we\rquote re not trying for a bit of inter-house unity,\rquote  said Hermione crossly.
\par They had reached the foot of the marble staircase. A line of fourth-year Ravenclaws was crossing the Entrance Hall; they caught sight of Harry and hurried to form a tighter group, as though fright\-ened he might attack stragglers.
\par \lquote Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that,\rquote  said Harry sarcastically.
\par They followed the Ravenclaws into the Great Hall, all looking instinctively at the staff table as they entered
. Professor Grubbly-Plank was chatting to Professor Sinistra, the Astronomy teacher, and Hagrid was once again conspicuous only by his absence. The enchanted ceiling above them echoed Harry\rquote s mood; it was a mis\-erable rain-cloud grey.
\par \lquote Dumbledore didn\rquote t even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank woman\rquote s staying,\rquote  he said, as they made their way across to the Gryffindor table.
\par \lquote Maybe ...\rquote  said Hermione thoughtfully.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said both Harry and Ron together.
\par \lquote Well ... maybe he didn\rquote t want to draw attention to Hagrid not being here.\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean, draw attention to it?\rquote  said Ron, half-laughing. \lquote How could we not notice?\rquote 
\par Before Hermione could answer, a tall black girl with long braided hair had marched up to Harry.
\par \lquote Hi, Angelina.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  she said briskly, \lquote good summer?\rquote  And without waiting for an answer, \lquote Listen, I\rquote ve been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.\rquote 
\par \lquote Nice one,\rquote  said Harry, grinning at her; he suspected Angelina\rquote s pep talks might not be as long-winded as Oliver Wood\rquote s had been, which could only be an improvement.
\par \lquote Yeah, well, we need a new Keeper now Oliver\rquote s left. Tryouts are on Friday at five o\rquote clock and I want the whole team there, all right? Then we can see how the new person\rquote ll fit in.\rquote 
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Angelina smiled at him and departed.
\par \lquote I\rquote d forgotten Wood had left,\rquote  said Hermione vaguely as she sat down beside Ron and pulled a plate of toast towards her. \lquote I sup\-pose that will make quite a difference to the team?\rquote 
\par \lquote I s\rquote pose,\rquote  said Harry, taking the bench opposite. \lquote He was a good Keeper ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Still, it won\rquote t hurt to have some new blood, will it?\rquote  said Ron.
\par With a whoosh and a clatter, hundreds of owls came soaring in through the upper windows. They descended all over the Hall, bringing letters and packages to their owners and showering the breakfasters with droplets of water; it was clearly raining hard out
\-side. Hedwig was nowhere to be seen, but Harry was hardly sur\-prised; his only correspondent was Sirius, and he doubted Sirius would have anything new to tell him after only twenty-four hours apa
rt. Hermione, however, had to move her orange juice aside quickly to make way for a large damp barn owl bearing a sodden }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par \lquote It\rquote s best to know what the enemy is saying,\rquote  said Hermione darkly, and she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it, not emerging until Harry and Ron had finished eating.
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  she said simply, rolling up the newspaper and laying it down by her plate. \lquote Nothing about you or Dumbledore or any\-thing.\rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall was now moving along the table handing out timetables.
\par \lquote Look at today!\rquote  groaned Ron. \lquote History of Magic, double Potions, Divination and double Defence Against the Dark Arts ... Binns, Snape, Trelawney and that Umbridge woman all in one day! I wish Fred and George\rquote 
d hurry up and get those Skiving Snackboxes sorted ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Do mine ears deceive me?\rquote  said Fred, arriving with George and squeezing on to the bench beside Harry. \lquote Hogwarts prefects surely don\rquote t wish to skive off lessons?\rquote 
\par \lquote Look what we\rquote ve got today,\rquote  said Ron grumpily, shoving his timetable under Fred\rquote s nose. \lquote That\rquote s the worst Monday I\rquote ve ever seen.\rquote 
\par \lquote Fair point, little bro,\rquote  said Fred, scanning the column. \lquote You can have a bit of Nosebleed Nougat cheap if you like.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why\rquote s it cheap?\rquote  said Ron suspiciously.
\par \lquote Because you\rquote ll keep bleeding till you shrivel up, we haven\rquote t got an antidote yet,\rquote  said George, helping himself to a kipper.
\par \lquote Cheers,\rquote  said Ron moodily, pocketing his timetable, \lquote but I think I\rquote ll take the lessons.\rquote 
\par \lquote And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,\rquote  said Hermione, eyeing Fred and George beadily, \lquote you can\rquote t advertise for testers on the Gryffindor noticeboard.\rquote 
\par \lquote Says who?\rquote  said George, looking astonished.
\par \lquote Says me,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote And Ron.\rquote 
\par \lquote Leave me out of it,\rquote  said Ron hastily.
\par Hermione glared at him. Fred and George sniggered.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,\rquote  said Fred, thickly buttering a crumpet. \lquote You\rquote re starting your fifth year, you\rquote ll be begging us for a Snackbox before long.\rquote 
\par \lquote And why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snackbox?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote Fifth year\rquote s OWL year,\rquote  said George.
\par \lquote So?\rquote 
\par \lquote So you\rquote ve got your exams coming up, haven\rquote t you? They\rquote ll be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone they\rquote ll be rubbed raw,\rquote  said Fred with satisfaction.

\par \lquote Anyway, it\rquote s a nightmare of a year, the fifth,\rquote  said George. \lquote If you care about exam results, anyway. Fred and I managed to keep our peckers up somehow.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... you got, what was it, three OWLs each?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Yep,\rquote  said Fred unconcernedly. \lquote But we feel our futures lie out\-side the world of academic achievement.\rquote 
\par \lquote We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for our seventh year,\rquote  said George brightly, \lquote now that we\rquote ve got \endash \rquote 
\par He broke off at a warning look from Harry, who knew George had been about to mention the Triwizard winnings he had given them.
\par \lquote \endash  now that we\rquote ve got our OWLs,\rquote  George said hastily. \lquote I mean, do we really need NEWTs? But we didn\rquote t think Mum could take us leaving school early, not on top of Percy turning out to be the world\rquote

\par \lquote We\rquote re not going to waste our last year here, though,\rquote  said Fred, looking affectionately around at the Great Hall. \lquote We\rquote re going to use it to do a bit of market research
, find out exactly what the average Hogwarts student requires from a joke shop, carefully evaluate the results of our research, then produce products to fit the demand.\rquote 
\par \lquote But where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop?\rquote  Hermione asked sceptically. \lquote You\rquote re going to need all the ingredi\-ents and materials \endash  and premises too, I suppose ...\rquote 
\par Harry did not look at the twins. His face felt hot; he deliber\-ately dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it. He heard Fred say overhead, \lquote Ask us no questions and we\rquote ll tell you no lies, Hermione. C\rquote 
mon, George, if we get there early we might be able to sell a few Extendable Ears before Herbology.\rquote 
\par Harry emerged from under the table to see Fred and George walking away, each carrying a stack of toast.
\par \lquote What did that mean?\rquote  said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron. \lquote \'93Ask us no questions ...\'94 Does that mean they\rquote ve already got some gold to start a joke shop?\rquote 
\par \lquote You know, I\rquote ve been wondering about that,\rquote  said Ron, his brow furrowed. \lquote They bought me a new set of dress robes this summer and I couldn\rquote t understand where they got the Galleons ...\rquote 
\par Harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these dangerous waters.
\par \lquote D\rquote you reckon it\rquote s true this year\rquote s going to be really tough? Because of the exams?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yeah,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Bound to be, isn\rquote 
t it? OWLs are really important, affect the jobs you can apply for and everything. We get career advice, too, later this year, Bill told me. So you can choose what NEWTs you want to do next year.\rquote 
\par \lquote D\rquote you know what you want to do after Hogwarts?\rquote  Harry asked the other two, as they left the Great Hall shortly afterwards and set off towards their History of Magic classroom.
\par \lquote Not really,\rquote  said Ron slowly. \lquote Except ... well ...\rquote 
\par He looked slightly sheepish.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  Harry urged him.
\par \lquote Well, it\rquote d be cool to be an Auror,\rquote  said Ron in an off-hand voice.
\par \lquote Yeah, it would,\rquote  said Harry fervently.
\par \lquote But they\rquote re, like, the elite,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote You\rquote ve got to be really good. What about you, Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  she said. \lquote I think I\rquote d like to do something really worthwhile.\rquote 
\par \lquote An Auror\rquote s worthwhile!\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Yes, it is, but it\rquote s not the only worthwhile thing,\rquote  said Hermione thoughtfully, \lquote I mean, if I could take SPEW further ...\rquote 
\par Harry and Ron carefully avoided looking at each other.
\par History of Magic was by common consent the most boring sub\-ject ever devised by wizardkind. Professor Binns, their ghost teacher, had a wheezy, droning voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe drowsiness within ten minutes,
 five in warm weather. He never varied the form of their lessons, but lectured them without pausing while they took notes, or rather, gazed sleepily into space. Harry and Ron had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying Hermione
\rquote s notes before exams; she alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binns\rquote s voice.
\par Today, they suffered through three quarters of an hour\rquote s}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
droning on the subject of giant wars. Harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher\rquote 
s hands this subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain disengaged, and he spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them filthy looks out 
of the corner of her eye.
\par \lquote How would it be,\rquote  she asked them coldly, as they left the class\-room for break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), \lquote if I refused to lend you my notes this year?\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote d fail our OWL,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote If you want that on your con\-science, Hermione ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, you\rquote d deserve it,\rquote  she snapped. \lquote You don\rquote t even try to listen to him, do you?\rquote 
\par \lquote We do try,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote We just haven\rquote t got your brains or your memory or your concentration \endash  you\rquote re just cleverer than we are \endash  is it nice to rub it in?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, don\rquote t give me that rubbish,\rquote  said Hermione, but she looked slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard.
\par A fine misty drizzle was falling, so that the people standing in huddles around the yard looked blurred at the e
dges. Harry, Ron and Hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony, turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air and talking about what Snape was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year. They had go
t as far as agreeing that it was likely to be something extremely difficult, just to catch them off guard after a two-month holiday, when someone walked around the corner towards them.
\par \lquote Hello, Harry!\rquote 
\par It was Cho Chang and, what was more, she was on her own again. This was most unusual: Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls; Harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by herself to ask her to the Yule Ball.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  said Harry, feeling his face grow hot. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 At least you\rquote re not}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 he told himself. Cho seemed to be thinking along the same lines.
\par \lquote You got that stuff off, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, trying to grin as though the memory of their last meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying. \lquote So, did you ... er ... have a good summer?\rquote 
\par The moment he had said this he wished he hadn\rquote t \endash  Cedric had been Cho\rquote s boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her holiday almost as badly as it had affected Harry\rquote 
s. Something seemed to tauten in her face, but she said, \lquote Oh, it was all right, you know ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Is that a Tornados badge?\rquote  Ron demanded suddenly, pointing to the front of Cho\rquote s robes, where a sky-blue badge emblazoned with a double gold \lquote T\rquote  was pinned. \lquote You don\rquote t support them, do you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I do,\rquote  said Cho.
\par \lquote Have you always supported them, or just since they started winning the league?\rquote  said Ron, in what Harry considered an unnec\-essarily accusatory tone of voice.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve supported them since I was six,\rquote  said Cho coolly. \lquote Anyway ... see you, Harry.\rquote 
\par She walked away. Hermione waited until Cho was halfway across the courtyard before rounding on Ron.
\par \lquote You are so tactless!\rquote 
\par \lquote What? I only asked her if \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Couldn\rquote t you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own?\rquote 
\par \lquote So? She could\rquote ve done, I wasn\rquote t stopping \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Why on earth were you attacking her about her Quidditch team?\rquote 
\par \lquote Attacking? I wasn\rquote t attacking her, I was only \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Who }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 cares }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 if she supports the Tornados?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those badges only bought them last season \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But what does it }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 matter!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote It means they\rquote re not real fans, they\rquote re just jumping on the band\-wagon \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s the bell,\rquote  said Harry listlessly, because Ron and Hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it. They did not stop arguing all the way down to Snape\rquote 
s dungeon, which gave Harry plenty of time to reflect that between Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever to have two minutes of conversation with Cho that he could look back on without wanting to leave the country.
\par And yet, he thought, as they joined the queue lining up out\-side Snape\rquote s classroom door, she had chosen to come and talk to him, hadn\rquote t she? She had been Cedric\rquote 
s girlfriend; she could easily have hated Harry for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when 
Cedric had died, yet she was talking to him in a perfectly friendly way, not as though she thought him mad, or a liar, or in some horrible way responsible for Cedric\rquote 
s death ... yes, she had definitely chosen to come and talk to him, and that made the second time in two days ... and at this thought, Harry\rquote s spirits rose. Even the ominous sound of Snape\rquote 
s dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the small, hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in his chest. He filed into the classroom behind Ron and 
Hermione and followed them to their usual table at the back, ignoring the huffy, irritable noises now issuing from both of them.
\par \lquote Settle down,\rquote  said Snape coldly, shutting the door behind him.
\par There was no real need for the call to order; the moment the class had heard the door close, quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped. Snape\rquote s mere presence was usually enough to ensure a class\rquote s silence.
\par \lquote Before we begin today\rquote s lesson,\rquote  said Snape, sweeping over to his desk and staring around at them all, \lquote I think it appropriate to remind you that next June you will be sitting an important exam\-
ination, during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potions. Moronic though some of this class undoubtedly are, I expect you to scrape an \'93Acceptable\'94 in your OWL, or suffer my ... displeasure.
\rquote 
\par His gaze lingered this time on Neville, who gulped.
\par \lquote After this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with me,\rquote  Snape went on. \lquote I take only the very best into my NEWT Potions class, which means that some of us will certainly be saying goodbye.\rquote 
\par His eyes rested on Harry and his lip curled. Harry glared back, feeling a grim pleasure at the idea that he would be able to give up Potions after fifth year.
\par \lquote But we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell,\rquote  said Snape softly, \lquote 
so, whether or not you are intending to attempt NEWT, I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high pass level I have come to expect from my OWL students.
\par \lquote Toda
y we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation. Be warned: if you are too heavy-handed with the ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and some\-
times irreversible sleep, so you will need to pay close attention to what you are doing.\rquote  On Harry\rquote s left, Hermione sat up a little straighter, her expression one of utmost attention. \lquote The ingredients and method \endash \rquote 
 Snape flicked his wand \lquote \endash  are on the blackboard \endash \rquote  (they appeared there) \lquote \endash  you will find everything you need \endash \rquote  he flicked his wand again \lquote \endash  in the store cupboard \endash \rquote 
 (the door of the said cupboard sprang open) \lquote \endash  you have an hour and a half ... start.\rquote 
\par Just as Harry, Ron and Hermione had predicted, Snape could hardly have set them a more difficult, fiddly potion. The ingredi\-
ents had to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quantities; the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times, firstly in clockwise, then in
 anti-clockwise directions; the heat of the flames on which it was simmering had to be lowered to exactly the right level for a specific number of minutes before the final ingredient was added.
\par \lquote A light silver vapour should now be rising from your potion,\rquote  called Snape, with ten minutes left to go.
\par Harry, who was sweating profusely, looked desperately around the dungeon. His own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark grey steam; Ron\rquote s was spitting green sparks. Seamus was fever\-
ishly prodding the flames at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand, as they seemed to be going out. The surface of Hermione\rquote 
s potion, however, was a shimmering mist of silver vapour, and as Snape swept by he looked down his hooked nose at it without comment, which meant he could find nothing to criticise. At Harry\rquote 
s cauldron, however, Snape stopped, and looked down at it with a horrible smirk on his face.
\par \lquote Potter, what is this supposed to be?\rquote 
\par The Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly; they loved hearing Snape taunt Harry.
\par \lquote The Draught of Peace,\rquote  said Harry tensely.
\par \lquote Tell me, Potter,\rquote  said Snape softly, \lquote can you read?\rquote 
\par Draco Malfoy laughed.
\par \lquote Yes, I can,\rquote  said Harry, his fingers clenched tightly around his wand.
\par \lquote Read the third line of the instructions for me, Potter.\rquote 
\par Harry squinted at the blackboard; it was not easy to make out the instructions through the haze of multi-coloured steam now filling the dungeon.
\par \lquote \'93Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counter-clockwise, allow to simmer for seven minutes then add two drops of syrup of hellebore.\'94\rquote 
\par His heart sank. He had not added syrup of hellebore, but had proceeded straight to the fourth line of the instructions after allowing his potion to simmer for seven minutes.
\par \lquote Did you do everything on the third line, Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry very quietly.
\par \lquote I beg your pardon?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, more loudly. \lquote I forgot the hellebore.\rquote 
\par \lquote I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly worthless. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Evanesco.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par The contents of Harry\rquote s potion vanished; he was left standing foolishly beside an empty cauldron.
\par \lquote Those of you who }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 have }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
managed to read the instructions, fill one flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name and bring it up to my desk for testing,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote 
Homework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.\rquote 
\par While everyone around him filled their flagons, Harry cleared away his things, seething. His potion had been no worse than Ron\rquote s, which was now giving off a foul odour of bad eggs; or Neville\rquote 
s, which had achieved the consistency of just-mixed cement and which Neville was now having to gouge out of his cauldron; yet it was he, Harry, who would be receiving zero marks for the day\rquote 
s work. He stuffed his wand back into his bag and slumped down on to his seat, watching everyone else march up to Snape\rquote s desk with filled and corked flagons. When at long last the bell rang, Harry was first out of the dungeon and had already sta
rted his lunch by the time Ron and Hermione joined him in the Great Hall. The ceiling had turned an even murkier grey during the morning. Rain was lashing the high windows.
\par \lquote That was really unfair,\rquote  said Hermione consolingly, sitting down next to Harry and helping herself to shepherd\rquote s pie. \lquote Your potion wasn\rquote t nearly as bad as Goyle\rquote 
s; when he put it in his flagon the whole thing shattered and set his robes on fire.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, well,\rquote  said Harry, glowering at his plate, \lquote since when has Snape ever been fair to me?\rquote 
\par Neither of the others answered; all three of them knew that Snape and Harry\rquote s mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment Harry had set foot in Hogwarts.
\par \lquote I did think he might be a bit better this year,\rquote  said Hermione in a disappointed voice. \lquote I mean ... you know ...\rquote 
 she looked around carefully; there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and nobody was passing the table \lquote ... now he\rquote s in the Order and everything.\rquote 
\par \lquote Poisonous toadstools don\rquote t change their spots,\rquote  said Ron sagely. \lquote Anyway, I\rquote ve always thought Dumbledore was cracked to trust Snape. Where\rquote s the evidence he ever really stopped working for You-Know-Who?\rquote 

\par \lquote I think Dumbledore\rquote s probably got plenty of evidence, even if he doesn\rquote t share it with you, Ron,\rquote  snapped Hermione.
\par \lquote Oh, shut up, the pair of you,\rquote  said Harry heavily, as Ron opened his mouth to argue back. Hermione and Ron both froze, looking angry and offended. \lquote Can\rquote t you give it a rest?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote You\rquote 
re always having a go at each other, it\rquote s driving me mad.\rquote  And aban\-doning his shepherd\rquote s pie, he swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left them sitting there.
\par He walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time, past the many students hurrying towards lunch. The anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside him, and the vision of Ron and Hermione\rquote 
s shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Serve them right, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
he thought, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 why can\rquote t they give it a rest ... bickering all the time ... it\rquote s enough to drive anyone up the wall ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par He passed the large picture of Sir Cadogan the knight on a landing; Sir Cadogan drew his sword and brandished it fiercely at Harry, who ignored him.
\par \lquote Come back, you scurvy dog! Stand fast and fight!\rquote  yelled Sir Cadogan in a muffled voice from behind his visor, but Harry merely walked on and when Sir Cadogan attempted to follow him by run\-
ning into a neighbouring picture, he was rebuffed by its inhabi\-tant, a large and angry-looking wolfhound.
\par Harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the trapdoor at the top of North Tower. Consequently, he was the first to ascend the silver ladder that led to Sybill Trelawney\rquote s class\-room when the bell rang.
\par After Potions, Divination was Harry\rquote s least favourite class, which was due mainly to Professor Trelawney\rquote 
s habit of predicting his premature death every few lessons. A thin woman, heavily draped in shawls and glittering with strings of beads, she always reminded Harry of some kind of insect, wi
th her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes. She was busy putting copies of battered leather-bound books on each of the spindly little tables with which her room was littered when Harry entered the room, but the light cast by the lamps covered by scarves an
d the low-burning, sickly-scented fire was so dim she appeared not to notice him as he took a seat in the shadows. The rest of the class arrived over the next five min\-
utes. Ron emerged from the trapdoor, looked around carefully, spotted Harry and made directly for him, or as directly as he could while having to wend his way between tables, chairs and over\-stuffed pouffes.
\par \lquote Hermione and me have stopped arguing,\rquote  he said, sitting down beside Harry.
\par \lquote Good,\rquote  grunted Harry.
\par \lquote But Hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you stopped taking out your temper on us,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m just passing on the message,\rquote  said Ron, talking over him. \lquote But I reckon she\rquote s right. It\rquote s not our fault how Seamus and Snape treat you.\rquote 
\par \lquote I never said it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Good-day,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney in her usual misty, dreamy voice, and Harry broke off, again feeling both annoyed and slightly ashamed of himself. \lquote 
And welcome back to Divination. I have, of course, been following your fortunes most carefully over the holi\-days, and am delighted to see that you have all returned to Hogwarts safely \endash  as, of course, I knew you would.
\par \lquote You will find on the tables before you copies of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Dream Oracle, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
by Inigo Imago. Dream interpretation is a most important means of divining the future an
d one that may very probably be tested in your OWL. Not, of course, that I believe examination passes or failures are of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of divination. If you have the Seeing Eye, certificates and grades matter very
 little. However, the Headmaster likes you to sit the examination, so ...\rquote 
\par Her voice trailed away delicately, leaving them all in no doubt that Professor Trelawney considered her subject above such sordid matters as examinations.
\par \lquote Turn, please, to the introduction and read what Imago has to say on the matter of dream interpretation. Then, divide into pairs. Use }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Dream Oracle }{

\par The one good thing to be said for this lesson was that it was not a double 
period. By the time they had all finished reading the introduction of the book, they had barely ten minutes left for dream interpretation. At the table next to Harry and Ron, Dean had paired up with Neville, who immediately embarked on a long-winded expla
nation of a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his grandmother\rquote s best hat; Harry and Ron merely looked at each other glumly.
\par \lquote I never remember my dreams,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote you say one.\rquote 
\par \lquote You must remember one of them,\rquote  said Harry impatiently.
\par He was not going to share his dreams with anyone. He knew perfectly well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant, he did not need Ron or Professor Trelawney or the stupid }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Well, I dreamed I was playing Quidditch the other night,\rquote  said Ron, screwing up his face in an effort to remember. \lquote What d\rquote you reckon that means?\rquote 
\par \lquote Probably that you\rquote re going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something,\rquote  said Harry, turning the pages of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Dream Oracle }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 without interest. It was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Oracle }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
and Harry was not cheered up when Professor Trelawney set them the task of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework. When the bell went, he and Ron led the way back down the ladder, Ron grumbling loudly.
\par \lquote D\rquote you realise how much homework we\rquote ve got already? Binns set us a foot-and-a-half-long essay on giant wars, Snape wants a foot on the use of moonstones, and now we\rquote ve got a month\rquote 
s dream diary from Trelawney! Fred and George weren\rquote t wrong about OWL year, were they? That Umbridge woman had better not give us any ...\rquote 
\par When they entered the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom they found Professor Umbridge already seated at the teacher\rquote s desk, wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the
 black velvet bow on top of her head. Harry was again reminded forcibly of a large fly perched unwisely on top of an even larger toad.
\par The class was quiet as it entered the room; Professor Umbridge was, as yet, an unknown quantity and nobody knew how strict a disciplinarian she was likely to be.
\par \lquote Well, good afternoon!\rquote  she said, when finally the whole class had sat down.
\par A few people mumbled \lquote good afternoon\rquote  in reply.
\par \lquote Tut, tut,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge. \lquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 That }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 won\rquote

\par Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair behind the teacher\rquote s desk, observing them all with those pouchy toad\rquote s eyes. Harry turned to page five of his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns. He felt his concentration
 sliding away from him; he had soon read the same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few words. Several silent minutes passed. Next to him, Ron was absent-mindedly turning his quill over and over in his fingers, staring at the s
ame spot on the page. Harry looked right and received a surprise to shake him out of his torpor. Hermione had not even opened her copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Defensive Magical Theory. }{

\par Harry could not remem
ber Hermione ever neglecting to read when instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under her nose. He looked at her enquiringly, but she merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to answer questi
ons, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who was looking just as resolutely in another direction.
\par After several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the only one watching Hermione. The chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch Hermione\rquote 
s mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge\rquote s eye rather than struggle on with \lquote Basics for Beginners\rquote .
\par When more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather than at their books, Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the situation no longer.
\par \lquote Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?\rquote  she asked Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her.
\par \lquote Not about the chapter, no,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Well, we\rquote re reading just now,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge, showing her small pointed teeth. \lquote If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve got a query about your course aims,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows.
\par \lquote And your name is?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hermione Granger,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness.

\par \lquote Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Weasley,\rquote  said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.
\par Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on him. Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Professor Umbridge\rquote s pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before she addressed Hermione.
\par \lquote Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Surely the whole point of Defence Against the Dark Arts is to practise defensive spells?\rquote 
\par \lquote Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?\rquote  asked Professor Umbridge, in her falsely sweet voice.

\par \lquote Dean Thomas.\rquote

\lquote Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which, after all, is what school is all about. And your name is?\rquote 
 she added, staring at Parvati, whose hand had just shot up.
\par \lquote Parvati Patil, and isn\rquote t there a practical bit in our Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL? Aren\rquote t we supposed to show that we can actu\-ally do the counter-curses and things?\rquote 
\par \lquote As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under care\-fully controlled examination conditions,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge dismissively.

\par \lquote There is nothing waiting out there, Mr Potter.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yeah?\rquote  said Harry. His temper, which seemed to have been bubbling just beneath the surface all day, was reaching boiling point.
\par \lquote Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves?\rquote  enquired Professor Umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice.

\par \lquote Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr Potter.\rquote 
\par The classroom was silent and still. Everyone was staring at either Umbridge or Harry.
\par \lquote Now, let me make a few things quite plain.\rquote 
\par Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned towards them, her stubby-fingered hands splayed on her desk.
\par \lquote You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead \endash \rquote

\par \lquote Harry, no!\rquote  Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at his sleeve, but Harry jerked his arm out of her reach.
\par \lquote So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord, did he?\rquote  Harry asked, his voice shaking.
\par There was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of them, apart from Ron and Hermione, had ever heard Harry talk about what had happened on the night Cedric had died. They stare
d avidly from Harry to Professor Umbridge, who had raised her eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face.
\par \lquote Cedric Diggory\rquote s death was a tragic accident,\rquote  she said coldly.
\par \lquote It was murder,\rquote  said Harry. He could feel himself shaking. He had hardly spoken to anyone about this, least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates. \lquote Voldemort killed him and you know it.\rquote 
\par Professor Umbridge\rquote s face was quite blank. For a moment, Harry thought she was going to scream at him. Then she said, in her softest, most sweetly girlish voice, \lquote Come here, Mr Potter, dear.\rquote 
\par He kicked his chair aside, strode around Ron and Hermione and up to the teacher\rquote s desk. He could feel the rest of the class holding its breath. He felt so angry he did not care what happened next.
\par Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped her quill into a bottle of ink and started scribbling, hunched over so that Harry could not see what she was writing. Nobody spo
ke. After a minute or so she rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand; it sealed itself seamlessly so that he could not open it.
\par \lquote Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge, holding out the note to him.
\par He took it from her without saying a word, and left the room, not even looking back at Ron and Hermione, slamming the class\-
room door shut behind him. He walked very fast along the corridor, the note to McGonagall clutched tight in his hand, and turning a corner walked slap 
into Peeves the poltergeist, a wide-mouthed little man floating on his back in midair, juggling several ink\-wells.
\par \lquote Why, it\rquote s Potty Wee Potter!\rquote  cackled Peeves, allowing two of the inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the walls with ink; Harry jumped backwards out of the way with a snarl.

side to side behind their square spectacles as she read what Umbridge had written, and with each line they became narrower.
\par \lquote Come in here, Potter.\rquote

\par There had been a previous occasion when Harry, expecting to be caned by Professor McGonagall, had instead been appointed by her to the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He sank into a chair oppo\-site her and helped himself to a Ginger Newt, feeling just as con

\par Professor McGonagall set down Professor Umbridge\rquote s note and looked very seriously at Harry.
\par \lquote Potter, you need to be careful.\rquote 
\par Harry swallowed his mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at her. Her tone of voice was not at all what he was used to; it was not brisk, crisp and stern; it was low and anxious and somehow much more human than usual.

\par \lquote Every evening this week!\rquote  Harry repeated, horrified. \lquote But, Professor, couldn\rquote t you \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I couldn\rquote t,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall flatly.
\par \lquote But \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote She is your teacher and has every right to give you detention. You will go to her room at five o\rquote clock tomorrow for the first one. Just remember: tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge.\rquote 
\par \lquote But I was telling the truth!\rquote  said Harry, outraged. \lquote Voldemort is back, you know he is; Professor Dumbledore knows he is \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote For heaven\rquote s sake, Potter!\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, straight\-ening her glasses angrily (she had winced horribly when he had used Voldemort\rquote s name). \lquote Do you really think this is about truth or lies? It\rquote 
s about keeping your head down and your temper under control!\rquote 
\par She stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and Harry stood up, too.
\par \lquote Have another biscuit,\rquote  she said irritably, thrusting the tin at him.
\par \lquote No, thanks,\rquote  said Harry coldly.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be ridiculous,\rquote  she snapped.
\par He took one.
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  he said grudgingly.
\par \lquote Didn\rquote t you listen to Dolores Umbridge\rquote s speech at the start-of-term feast, Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Yeah ... she said ... progress will be prohibited or ... well, it meant that ... that the Ministry of Magic is trying to interfere at Hogwarts.\rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall eyed him for a moment, then sniffed, walked around her desk and held open the door for him.
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote m glad you listen to Hermione Granger at any rate,\rquote  she said, pointing him out of her office.

Dinner in the Great Hall that night was not a pleasant experience for Harry. The news about his shouting match with Umbridge had travelled exceptionally fast even by Hogwarts\rquote 
 standards. He heard whispers all around him as he sat eating between Ron and Hermione. The funny thing was that none of the whisperers seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying about him. On the con\-
trary, it was as though they were hoping he would get angry and start shouting again, so that they could hear his story firsthand.

\par \lquote The thing is, Harry, I\rquote m not sure they did,\rquote  said Hermione grimly. \lquote Oh, let\rquote s get out of here.\rquote 
\par She slammed down her own knife and fork; Ron looked long\-ingly at his half-finished apple pie but followed suit. People stared at them all the way out of the Hall.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean, you\rquote re not sure they believed Dumbledore?\rquote  Harry asked Hermione when they reached the first-floor landing.
\par \lquote Look, you don\rquote t understand what it was like after it happened,\rquote  said Hermione quietly. \lquote You arrived back in the middle of the lawn clutching Cedric\rquote s dead body ... none of
 us saw what happened in the maze ... we just had Dumbledore\rquote s word for it that You-Know-Who had come back and killed Cedric and fought you.\rquote 
\par \lquote Which is the truth!\rquote  said Harry loudly.
\par \lquote I know it is, Harry, so will you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 please }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 stop biting my head off?\rquote 
 said Hermione wearily. \lquote It\rquote s just that before the truth could sink in, everyone went home for the summer, where they spent two months reading about how you\rquote re a nutcase and Dumbledore\rquote s going senile!\rquote 
\par Rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empt
y corridors back to Gryffindor Tower. Harry felt as though his first day had lasted a week, but he still had a mountain of homework to do before bed. A dull pounding pain was developing over his right eye. He glanced out of a rain-washed window at the dar
k grounds as they turned into the Fat Lady\rquote s corridor. There was still no light in Hagrid\rquote s cabin.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Mimbulus mimbletonia,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
said Hermione, before the Fat Lady could ask. The portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind it and the three of them scrambled through it.
\par The common room was almost empty; nearly everyone was still down at dinner. Crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them, purring loudly, and when Harry, Ron and Hermione took their three favourite chairs at the fireside 
he leapt lightly on to Hermione\rquote s lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion. Harry gazed into the flames, feeling drained and exhausted.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote How }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 can Dumbledore have let this happen?\rquote 
 Hermione cried suddenly, making Harry and Ron jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted. She pounded the arms of her chair in fury, so that bits of stuffing leaked out of the holes. \lquote 
How can he let that terrible woman teach us? And in our OWL year, too!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, we\rquote ve never had great Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers, have we?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote You know what it\rquote s like, Hagrid told us, nobody wants the job; they say it\rquote s jinxed.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, but to employ someone who\rquote s actually refusing to let us do magic! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 What\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Dumbledore playing at?\rquote 
\par \lquote And she\rquote s trying to get people to spy for her,\rquote  said Ron darkly. \lquote Remember when she said she wanted us to come and tell her if we hear anyone saying You-Know-Who\rquote s back?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course she\rquote s here to spy on us all, that\rquote s obvious, why else would Fudge have wanted her to come?\rquote  snapped Hermione.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t start arguing again,\rquote  said Harry wearily, as Ron opened his mouth to retaliate. \lquote Can\rquote t we just ... let\rquote s just do that home\-work, get it out of the way ...\rquote 
\par They collected their schoolbags from a corner and returned to the chairs by the fire. People were coming back from dinner now. Harry kept his face averted from the portrait hole, but could still sense the stares he was attracting.
\par \lquote Shall we do Snape\rquote s stuff first?\rquote  said Ron, dipping his quill into his ink. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote \'93
The properties ...of moonstone ... and its uses ...in potion-making ...\'94\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 he muttered, writing the words across the top of his parchment as he spoke them. 
\lquote There.\rquote  He underlined the title, then looked up expectantly at Hermione.
\par \lquote So, what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making?\rquote 
\par But Hermione was not listening; she was squinting over into the far corner of the room, where Fred, George and Lee Jordan were now sitting at the centre of
 a knot of innocent-looking first-years, all of whom were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that Fred was holding.
\par \lquote No, I\rquote m sorry, they\rquote ve gone too far,\rquote  she said, standing up and looking positively furious. \lquote Come on, Ron.\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  what?\rquote  said Ron, plainly playing for time. \lquote No \endash  come on, Hermione \endash  we can\rquote t tell them off for giving out sweets.\rquote 
\par \lquote You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat or \endash  or Puking Pastilles or \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Fainting Fancies?\rquote  Harry suggested quietly.
\par One by one, as though hit over the head with an invisible mallet, the first-years were slumping unconscious in their seats; some slid right on to the floor, others merely hung over the arms of their chairs, their tongues lolling out. Most of the pe
ople watching were laughing; Hermione, however, squared her shoulders and marched directly over to where Fred and George now stood with clipboards, closely observing the unconscious first-years. Ron rose halfway out of his chair, hovered uncertainly for a
 moment or two, then mut\-tered to Harry, \lquote She\rquote s got it under control,\rquote  before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame permitted.
\par \lquote That\rquote s enough!\rquote  Hermione said forcefully to Fred and George, both of whom looked up in mild surprise.
\par \lquote Yeah, you\rquote re right,\rquote  said George, nodding, \lquote this dosage looks strong enough, doesn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote I told you this morning, you can\rquote t test your rubbish on students!\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re paying them!\rquote  said Fred indignantly.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t care, it could be dangerous!\rquote 
\par \lquote Rubbish,\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote Calm down, Hermione, they\rquote re fine!\rquote  said Lee reassuringly as he walked from first-year to first-year, inserting purple sweets into their open mouths.
\par \lquote Yeah, look, they\rquote re coming round now,\rquote  said George.
\par A few of the first-years were indeed stirring. Several looked so shocked to find themselves lying on the floor, or dangling off their chairs, that Harry was sure Fred and George had not warned them what the sweets were going to do.
\par \lquote Feel all right?\rquote  said George kindly to a small dark-haired girl lying at his feet.
\par \lquote I \endash  I think so,\rquote  she said shakily.
\par \lquote Excellent,\rquote  said Fred happily, but the next second Hermione had snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of Fainting Fancies from his hands.
\par \lquote It is NOT excellent!\rquote 
\par \lquote Course it is, they\rquote re alive, aren\rquote t they?\rquote  said Fred angrily.
\par \lquote You can\rquote t do this, what if you made one of them really ill?\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re not going to make them ill, we\rquote ve already tested them all on ourselves, this is just to see if everyone reacts the same \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote If you don\rquote t stop doing it, I\rquote m going to \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Put us in detention?\rquote  said Fred, in an I\rquote d-like-to-see-you-try-it voice.
\par \lquote Make us write lines?\rquote  said George, smirking.
\par Onlookers all over the room were laughing. Hermione drew her\-self up to her full height; her eyes were narrowed and her bushy hair seemed to crackle with electricity.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  she said, her voice quivering with anger, \lquote but I will write to your mother.\rquote 
\par \lquote You wouldn\rquote t,\rquote  said George, horrified, taking a step back from her.
\par \lquote Oh, yes, I would,\rquote  said Hermione grimly. \lquote I can\rquote t stop you eating the stupid things yourselves, but you\rquote re not to give them to the first-years.\rquote 
\par Fred and George looked thunderstruck. It was clear that as far as they were concerned, Hermione\rquote s threat was way below the belt. With a last threatening look at them, she thrust Fred\rquote 
s clipboard and the bag of Fancies back into his arms, and stalked back to her chair by the fire.
\par Ron was now so low in his seat that his nose was roughly level with his knees.
\par \lquote Thank you for your support, Ron,\rquote  Hermione said acidly.
\par \lquote You handled it fine by yourself,\rquote  Ron mumbled.
\par Hermione stared down at her blank piece of parchment for a few seconds, then said edgily, \lquote Oh, it\rquote s no good, I can\rquote t concentrate now. I\rquote m going to bed.\rquote 
\par Sh
e wrenched her bag open; Harry thought she was about to put her books away, but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly objects, placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace, covered them with a few screwed-up bits of parchment and a broken quill
 and stood back to admire the effect.
\par \lquote What in the name of Merlin are you doing?\rquote  said Ron, watching her as though fearful for her sanity.
\par \lquote They\rquote re hats for house-elves,\rquote  she said briskly, now stuffing her books back into her bag. \lquote I did them over the summer. I\rquote m a really slow knitter without magic but now I\rquote 
m back at school I should be able to make lots more.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re leaving out hats for the house-elves?\rquote  said Ron slowly. \lquote And you\rquote re covering them up with rubbish first?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Hermione defiantly, swinging her bag on to her back.
\par \lquote That\rquote s not on,\rquote  said Ron angrily. \lquote You\rquote re trying to trick them into picking up the hats. You\rquote re setting them free when they might not want to be free.\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course they want to be free!\rquote  said Hermione at once, though her face was turning pink. \lquote Don\rquote t you dare touch those hats, Ron!\rquote 
\par She left. Ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to the girls\rquote  dormitories, then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats.
\par \lquote They should at least see what they\rquote re picking up,\rquote  he said firmly. \lquote Anyway ...\rquote  he rolled up the parchment on which he had written the title of Snape\rquote s essay, \lquote there\rquote 
s no point trying to finish this now, I can\rquote t do it without Hermione, I haven\rquote t got a clue what you\rquote re supposed to do with moonstones, have you?\rquote 
\par Harr
y shook his head, noticing as he did so that the ache in his right temple was getting worse. He thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply. Knowing perfectly well that when the morning came, he would regret not finishing h
is homework that night, he piled his books back into his bag.
\par \lquote I\rquote m going to bed too.\rquote 
\par He passed Seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormi\-tories, but did not look at him. Harry had a fleeting impression that Seamus had opened his mouth to speak, bu
t he sped up and reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation.

The following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous one. Hagrid was still absent from the staff table at breakfast.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote But on the plus side, no Snape today,\rquote  said Ron bracingly.
\par Hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee. She looked mildly pleased about something, and when Ron asked her what she had to be so happy about, she simply said, \lquote The hats have gone. Seems the house-elves do want freedom after all.
\rquote 
\par \lquote I wouldn\rquote t bet on it,\rquote  Ron told her cuttingly. \lquote They might not count as clothes. They didn\rquote t look anything like hats to me, more like woolly bladders.\rquote 
\par Hermione did not speak to him all morning.
\par Double Charms was succeeded by double Transfiguration. Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the impor\-tance of OWLs.
\par \lquote What you must remember,\rquote  said little Professor Flitwick squeakily, perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top of his desk, \lquote 
is that these examinations may influence your futures for many years to come! If you have not already given serious thought to your careers, now is the time to do so. And in the meantime, I\rquote 
m afraid, we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice!\rquote 
\par They then spent over an hour revising Summoning Charms, which according to Professor Flitwick were bound to come up in their OWL, and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest ever amount of Charms homework.
\par It was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration.
\par \lquote You cannot pass an OWL,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall grimly, \lquote without serious application, practice and study. I see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an OWL in Transfiguration as long as they put in the work.
\rquote  Neville made a sad little disbelieving noise. \lquote Yes, you too, Longbottom,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote There\rquote s nothing wrong with your w
ork except lack of confidence. So ... today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until NEWT level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your OWL
.\rquote 
\par She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly difficult. By the end of a double period neither he nor Ron had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practising, though Ron said hopefully he thought his looked a bit paler. Hermio
ne, on the other hand, successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt, earning her a ten-point bonus for Gryffindor from Professor McGonagall. She was the only person not given homework; every\-
body else was told to practise the spell overnight, ready for a fresh attempt on their snails the following afternoon.
\par Now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do, Harry and Ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of moonstones in potion-making. Still angry about Ron\rquote 
s slur on her woolly hats, Hermione did not join them. By the time they reached Care of Magical Creatures in the after\-noon, Harry\rquote s head was aching again.
\par The day had become cool and breezy, and as they walked down the sloping lawn towards Hagrid\rquote s cabin 
on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, they felt the occasional drop of rain on their faces. Professor Grubbly-Plank stood waiting for the class some ten yards from Hagrid\rquote 
s front door, a long trestle table in front of her laden with twigs. As Harry and Ron 
reached her, a loud shout of laughter sounded behind them; turning, they saw Draco Malfoy striding towards them, surrounded by his usual gang of Slytherin cronies. He had clearly just said something highly amusing, because Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy Parkinson a
nd the rest continued to snigger heartily as they gathered around the trestle table and, judging by the way they all kept looking over at Harry, he was able to guess the sub\-ject of the joke without too much difficulty.
\par \lquote Everyone here?\rquote  barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, once all the Slytherins and Gryffindors had arrived. \lquote Let\rquote s crack on then. Who can tell me what these things are called?\rquote 
\par She indicated the heap of twigs in front of her. Hermione\rquote s hand shot into the air. Behind her back, Malfoy did a buck-too
thed imitation of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question. Pansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream, as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what looked like ti
ny pixie\-ish creatures made of wood, each with knobbly brown arms and legs, two twiglike fingers at the end of each hand and a funny flat, barklike face in which a pair of beetle-brown eyes glittered.
\par \lquote Oooooh!\rquote  said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating Harry. Anyone would have thought Hagrid had never shown them impres\-
sive creatures; admittedly, the Flobberworms had been a bit dull, but the Salamanders and Hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so.
\par \lquote Kindly keep your voices down, girls!\rquote  said Professor Grubbly-Plank sharply, scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice among the stick-creatures, who immediately fell upon the food. \lquote So \endash 
 anyone know the names of these creatures? Miss Granger?\rquote 
\par \lquote Bowtruckles,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote They\rquote re tree-guardians, usually live in wand-trees.\rquote 
\par \lquote Five points for Gryffindor,\rquote  said Professor Grubbly-Plank. \lquote Yes, these are Bowtruckles, and as Miss Granger rightly says, they generally live in trees whose wood is of wand quality. Anybody know what they eat?\rquote 
\par \lquote Woodlice,\rquote  said Hermione promptly, which explained why what Harry had taken to be grains of brown rice were moving. \lquote But fairy eggs if they can get them.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good girl, take another five points. So, whenever you need leaves
 or wood from a tree in which a Bowtruckle lodges, it is wise to have a gift of woodlice ready to distract or placate it. They may not look dangerous, but if angered they will try to gouge at human eyes with their fingers, which, as you can see, are very 
sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs. So if you\rquote d like to gather closer, take a few woodlice and a Bowtruckle \endash  I have enough here for one between three \endash 
 you can study them more closely. I want a sketch from each of you with all body-parts labelled by the end of the lesson.\rquote 
\par The class surged forwards around the trestle table. Harry delib\-erately circled around the back so that he ended up right next to Professor Grubbly-Plank.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Hagrid?\rquote  he asked her, while everyone else was choosing Bowtruckles.
\par \lquote Never you mind,\rquote 
 said Professor Grubbly-Plank repressively, which had been her attitude last time Hagrid had failed to turn up for a class, too. Smirking all over his pointed face, Draco Malfoy leaned across Harry and seized the largest Bowtruckle.
\par \lquote Maybe,\rquote  said Malfoy in an undertone, so that only Harry could hear him, \lquote the stupid great oaf\rquote s got himself badly injured.\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe you will if you don\rquote t shut up,\rquote  said Harry out of the side of his mouth.
\par \lquote Maybe he\rquote s been messing with stuff that\rquote s too }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 big }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
for him, if you get my drift.\rquote 
\par Malfoy walked away, smirking over his shoulder at Harry, who felt suddenly sick. Did Malfoy know something? His father was a Death Eater after all; what if he had information about Hagrid\rquote s fate that had not yet reached th
e ears of the Order? He hurried back around the table to Ron and Hermione who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to persuade a Bowtruckle to remain still long enough for them to draw it. Harry pulled out parchment and quill, cro
uched down beside the others and related in a whisper what Malfoy had just said.
\par \lquote Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid,\rquote  said Hermione at once. \lquote It\rquote s just playing into Malfoy\rquote s hands to look worried; it tells him we don\rquote t know exactly what\rquote s going on. We\rquote 
ve got to ignore him, Harry. Here, hold the Bowtruckle for a moment, just so I can draw its face ...\rquote

\par \lquote OUCH!\rquote 
\par Harry had gr
ipped the Bowtruckle so hard that it had almost snapped, and it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its sharp fingers, leaving two long deep cuts there. Harry dropped it. Crabbe and Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea o
f
 Hagrid being sacked, laughed still harder as the Bowtruckle set off at full tilt towards the Forest, a little moving stick-man soon swallowed up among the tree roots. When the bell echoed distantly over the grounds, Harry rolled up his blood-stained Bowt
ruckle picture and marched off to Herbology with his hand wrapped in Hermione\rquote s handkerchief, and Malfoy\rquote s derisive laughter still ringing in his ears.
\par \lquote If he calls Hagrid a moron one more time ...\rquote  snarled Harry.
\par \lquote Harry, don\rquote t go picking a row with Malfoy, don\rquote t forget, he\rquote s a prefect now, he could make life difficult for you ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Wow, I wonder what it\rquote d be like to have a difficult life?\rquote  said Harry sarcastically. Ron laughed, but Hermione frowned. Together, they traipsed across the vegetable patch. The sk
y still appeared unable to make up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not.
\par \lquote I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, that\rquote s all,\rquote  said Harry in a low voice, as they reached the greenhouses. \lquote And }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 don\rquote

\par \lquote I wasn\rquote t going to,\rquote  said Hermione calmly.
\par \lquote Because she\rquote ll never be as good as Hagrid,\rquote  said Harry firmly, fully aware that he had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it.
\par The door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some fourth-years spilled out of it, including Ginny.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  she said brightly as she passed. A few seconds later, Luna Lovegood emerged, trailing behind the rest of the class, a smudge of earth on her nose,
 and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head. When she saw Harry, her prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and she made a beeline straight for him. Many of his classmates turned curiously to watch. Luna took a great breath and then said, withou
t so much as a preliminary hello, \lquote I believe He Who Must Not Be Named is back and I believe you fought him and escaped from him.\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  right,\rquote  said Harry awkwardly. Luna was wearing what looked like a pair of orange radishes for earrings, a fact that Parvati and Lavender seemed to have noticed, as they were both giggling and pointing at her earlobes.
\par \lquote You can laugh,\rquote  Luna said, her voice rising, apparently under the impression that Parvati and Lavender were laughing at what she had said rather than what she was wearing, \lquote 
but people used to believe there were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, they were right, weren\rquote t they?\rquote  said Hermione impatiently. \lquote There }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 weren\rquote t }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Luna gave her a withering look and flounced away, radishes swinging madly. Parvati and Lavender were not the only ones hooting with laughter now.
\par \lquote D\rquote you mind not offending the only people who believe me?\rquote  Harry asked Hermione as they made their way into class.
\par \lquote Oh, for heaven\rquote s sake, Harry, you can do better than }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 her,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par Harry thought of the sinister winged horses he had seen on the night he had arrived and how Luna had said she could see them too. His spirits sank slightly. Had she been lying? But before he could devote muc
h more thought to the matter, Ernie Macmillan had stepped up to him.
\par \lquote I want you to know, Potter,\rquote  he said in a loud, carrying voice, \lquote that it\rquote s not only weirdos who support you. I personally believe you one hundred per cent. My family have always stood firm behind Dumbledore, and so do I.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  thanks very much, Ernie,\rquote  said Harry, taken aback but pleased. Ernie might be pompous on occasions like this, but Harry was in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from somebody who did not have radishe
s dangling from their ears. Ernie\rquote s words had certainly wiped the smile from Lavender Brown\rquote s face and as he turned to talk to Ron and Hermione, Harry caught Seamus\rquote s expression, which looked both confused and defiant.
\par To nobody\rquote s surprise, Professor Sprout started their lesson by lecturing them about the importance of OWLs. Harry wished all the teachers would stop doing this; he was starting to get an anx\-
ious, twisted feeling in his stomach every time he remembered how much homework he had to do, a feeling that worsened dramati\-
cally when Professor Sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class. Tired and smelling strongly of dragon dung, Professor Sprout\rquote s preferred type of fertiliser, the Gryffindors trooped back up to the castle, none of them ta
lking very much; it had been another long day.
\par As Harry was starving, and he had his first detention with Umbridge at five o\rquote clock, he headed straight for dinner without dropping off his bag in Gryffindor Tower so that he could bolt something down before f
acing whatever she had in store for him. He had barely reached the entrance of the Great Hall, however, when a loud and angry voice yelled, \lquote Oi, Potter!\rquote 
\par \lquote What now?\rquote  he muttered wearily, turning to face Angelina Johnson, who looked as though she was in a towering temper.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll tell you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 what now,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par \lquote I didn\rquote t decide not to be there!\rquote  said Harry, stung by the in\-justice of these words. \lquote I got detention from that Umbridge woman, just because I told her the truth about You-Know-Who.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off on Friday,\rquote  said Angelina fiercely, \lquote and I don\rquote t care how you do it. Tell her You-Know-Who\rquote s a figment of your imagination if you like, just }{

\par \lquote What d\rquote you reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting you off on Friday?\rquote  said Ron sceptically, as they sat down at the Gryffindor table.
\par \lquote Less than zero,\rquote  said Harry glumly, tipping lamb chops on to his plate and starting to eat. \lquote Better try, though, hadn\rquote t I? I\rquote ll offer to do two more detentions or something, I dunno ...\rquote 
 He swallowed a mouthful of potato and added, \lquote I hope she doesn\rquote t keep me too long this evening. You realise we\rquote ve got to write three essays, prac\-tise Vanishing Spells for McGonagall, work out a counter-charm for Fl
itwick, finish the Bowtruckle drawing and start that stupid dream diary for Trelawney?\rquote 
\par Ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling.

\par \lquote What\rquote s that got to do with our homework?\rquote  said Hermione, her eyebrows raised.
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  said Ron at once, his ears reddening.
\par At five to five Harry bade the other two goodbye and set off for Umbridge\rquote s office on the third floor. When he knocked on the door she called, \lquote Come in,\rquote  in a sugary voice. He entered cautiously, looking around.
\par He had known this office under three of its previous occupants. In the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in beaming portraits of himself. When Lupin had occu\-pied it, it was likely you would meet some fascinating Dark crea
\-ture in a cage or tank if you came to call. In the impostor Moody\rquote s days it had been packed with various instruments and artefacts for the detection of wrongdoing and concealment.
\par Now, however, it looked totally unrecognisable. The surfaces had
 all been draped in lacy covers and cloths. There were several vases full of dried flowers, each one residing on its own doily, and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates, each decorated with a large technicoloured kitten wearing a diff
erent bow around its neck. These were so foul that Harry stared at them, transfixed, until Professor Umbridge spoke again.
\par \lquote Good evening, Mr Potter.\rquote 
\par Harry started and looked around. He had not noticed her at first because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her.
\par \lquote Evening, Professor Umbridge,\rquote  Harry said stiffly.
\par \lquote Well, sit down,\rquote  she said, pointing towards a small table draped in lace beside which she had drawn up a straight-backed chair. A piece of blank parchment lay on the table, apparently waiting for him.
\par \lquote Er,\rquote  said Harry, without moving. \lquote Professor Umbridge. Er \endash  before we start, I \endash  I wanted to ask you a ... a favour.\rquote 
\par Her bulging eyes narrowed.
\par \lquote Oh, yes?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote m ... I\rquote m in the Gryffindor Quidditch team. And I was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new Keeper at five o\rquote clock on Friday and I was \endash  was wondering whether I could skip deten\-tion that night and do it 
\endash  do it another night ... instead ...\rquote 
\par He knew long before he reached the end of his sentence that it was no good.
\par \lquote Oh, no,\rquote  said Umbridge, smiling so widely that she looked as though she had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly. \lquote Oh, no, no, no. This is your punishment for spreading evil, nasty, attention-se
eking stories, Mr Potter, and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty one\rquote s convenience. No, you will come here at five o\rquote 
clock tomorrow, and the next day, and on Friday too, and you will do your detentions as planned. I think it rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do. It ought to reinforce the lesson I am trying to teach you.\rquote 
\par Harry felt the blood surge to his head and heard a thumping noise in his ears. So he told \lquote evil, nasty, attention-seeking stories\rquote , did he?
\par She was watching him with her head slightly to one side, still smiling widely, as though she knew exactly what he was thinking and was waiting to see whether he would start shouting again. With a massive effort, Harry looked away from her, drop
ped his schoolbag beside the straight-backed chair and sat down.
\par \lquote There,\rquote  said Umbridge sweetly, \lquote we\rquote re getting better at control\-ling our temper already, aren\rquote t we? Now, you are going to be doing some lines for me, Mr Potter. No, not with your quill,\rquote  she
 added, as Harry bent down to open his bag. \lquote You\rquote re going to be using a rather special one of mine. Here you are.\rquote 
\par She handed him a long, thin black quill with an unusually sharp point.
\par \lquote I want you to write, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 I must not tell lies,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 she told him softly.

\par \lquote How many times?\rquote  Harry asked, with a creditable imitation of politeness.
\par \lquote Oh, as long as it takes for the message to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 sink in,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
said Umbridge sweetly. \lquote Off you go.\rquote 
\par She moved over to her desk, sat down and bent over a stack of parchment that looked like essays for marking. Harry raised the sharp black quill, then realised what was missing.
\par \lquote You haven\rquote t given me any ink,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote Oh, you won\rquote t need ink,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge, with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice.
\par Harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 I must not tell lies.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 

\par He let out a gasp of pain. The words had appeared on the parch\-ment in what appeared to be shining red ink. At the same time, the words had appeared on the back of Harry\rquote s right hand, cut into his skin as though traced there by a scalpel \endash 
 yet even as he stared at the shining cut, the skin healed over again, leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but quite smooth.
\par Harry looked round at Umbridge. She was watching him, her wide, toadlike mouth stretched in a smile.
\par \lquote Yes?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  said Harry quietly.
\par He looked back at the parchment, placed the quill on it once more, wrote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 I must not tell lies, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a second time; once again, the words had been cut into his skin; once again, they healed over seconds later.
\par And on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the words on the parchment in what he soon came to realise was not ink, but his own blood. And, again and aga
in, the words were cut into the back of his hand, healed, and reappeared the next time he set quill to parchment.
\par Darkness fell outside Umbridge\rquote s window. Harry did not ask when he would be allowed to stop. He did not even check his watch. He knew she was 
watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any, not even if he had to sit there all night, cutting open his own hand with this quill ...
\par \lquote Come here,\rquote  she said, after what seemed hours.
\par He stood up. His hand was stinging painfully. When he looked down at it he saw that the cut had healed, but that the skin there was red raw.
\par \lquote Hand,\rquote  she said.
\par He extended it. She took it in her own. Harry repressed a shudder as she touched him with her thick, stubby fingers on which she wore a number of ugly old rings.
\par \lquote Tut, tut, I don\rquote t seem to have made much of an impression yet,\rquote  she said, smiling. \lquote Well, we\rquote ll just have to try again tomorrow evening, won\rquote t we? You may go.\rquote 
\par Harry left her office without a word. The school was quite deserted; it was surely past midnight. He walked slowly up the corridor, then, when he had turned the corner and was sure she would not hear him, broke into a run.

\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Ron groaned sympathetically.
\par It was another bad day for Harry; he was one of the worst in Transfiguration, not having practised Vanishing Spells at all. He had to give up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the Bowtruckle and, meanwhile, Professors M
cGonagall, Grubbly-Plank and Sinistra gave them yet more homework, which he had no prospect of finishing that evening because of his second deten\-
tion with Umbridge. To cap it all, Angelina Johnson tracked him down at dinner again and, on learning that he would not be able to attend Friday\rquote 
s Keeper tryouts, told him she was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected players who wished to remain on the team to put training before their other commitments.
\par \lquote I\rquote m in detention!\rquote  Harry yelled after her as she stalked away. \lquote D\rquote you think I\rquote d rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing Quidditch?\rquote 
\par \lquote At least it\rquote s only lines,\rquote  said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back on to his bench and looked down at his steak and kidney pie, which he no longer fancied very much. \lquote It\rquote s not as if it\rquote

\par Harry opened his mouth, closed it again and nodded. He was not really sure why he was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was happening in Umbridge\rquote s room: he only kn
ew that he did not want to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face. He also felt dimly that this was between himself and Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and he was not going to give h
er the satis\-faction of hearing that he had complained about it.
\par \lquote I can\rquote t believe how much homework we\rquote ve got,\rquote  said Ron miserably.
\par \lquote Well, why didn\rquote t you do any last night?\rquote  Hermione asked him. \lquote Where were you, anyway?\rquote

\par But Ron had grabbed Harry\rquote s forearm and pulled the back of Harry\rquote s hand up level with his eyes. There was a pause, during which he stared at the words carved into the skin, then, looking sick, he released Harry.
\par \lquote I thought you said she was just giving you lines?\rquote 
\par Harry hesitated, but after all, Ron had been honest with him, so he told Ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in Umbridge\rquote s office.

Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week. Though Harry automatically glanced towards the staff table when he entered the Great Hall, it was without any real hope of seeing Hagrid, and he turned his mind immediately to his more pressing prob
lems, such as the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with Umbridge.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
Two things sustained Harry that day. One was the thought that it was almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though his final detention with Umbridge was sure to be, he had a dis\-
tant view of the Quidditch pitch from her window and might, with luck, be able to see something of Ron\rquote s tryout. These were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but Harry was grateful for any\-thing that 
might lighten his present darkness; he had never had a worse first week of term at Hogwarts.
\par At five o\rquote clock that evening he knocked on Professor Umbridge\rquote s office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time, and was told to enter. The blank p
archment lay ready for him on the lace-covered table, the pointed black quill beside it.
\par \lquote You know what to do, Mr Potter,\rquote  said Umbridge, smiling sweetly at him.
\par Harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window. If he just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right ... on the pre\-
text of shifting himself closer to the table, he managed it. He now had a distant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch, while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high g
oalposts, apparently awaiting their turn to Keep. It was impossible to tell which one was Ron at this dis\-tance.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 I must not tell lies, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
Harry wrote. The cut in the back of his right hand opened and began to bleed afresh.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 I must not tell lies. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The cut dug deeper, stinging and smarting.

\par He chanced another glance out of the window. Whoever was defending the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed. Katie Bell scored twice in the few seconds Harry dared to watch. Hoping very much that the Keeper wasn\rquote 
t Ron, he dropped his eyes back to the parchment dotted with blood.

\par He looked up whenever he thought he could risk it; when he could hear the scratching of Umbridge\rquote 
s quill or the opening of a desk drawer. The third person to try out was pretty good, the fourth was terrible, the fifth dodged a Bludger exceptionally well but then fumbled an easy save. The sky was darkening, and Harry doubted he would be able to see th
e sixth and seventh people at all.

\par The parchment was now shining with drops of blood from the back of his hand, which was searing with pain. When he next looked up, night had fallen and the Quidditch pitch was no longer visible.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s see if you\rquote ve got the message yet, shall we?\rquote  said Umbridge\rquote s soft voice half an hour later.
\par She moved towards him, stretching out her short ringed fingers for his arm. And then, as she took hold of him to examine the words now cut 
into his skin, pain seared, not across the back of his hand, but across the scar on his forehead. At the same time, he had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his midriff.
\par He wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet, staring at her. She looked back at him, a smile stretching her wide, slack mouth.
\par \lquote Yes, it hurts, doesn\rquote t it?\rquote  she said softly.
\par He did not answer. His heart was thumping very hard and fast. Was she talking about his hand or did she know what he had just felt in his forehead?
\par \lquote Well, I think I\rquote ve made my point, Mr Potter. You may go.\rquote 
\par He caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he could.

he gasped at the Fat Lady, who swung forwards once more.
\par A roar of sound greeted him. Ron came running towards him, beaming all over his face and slopping Butterbeer down his front from the goblet he was clutching.
\par \lquote Harry, I did it, I\rquote m in, I\rquote m Keeper!\rquote 
\par \lquote What? Oh \endash  brilliant!\rquote  said Harry, trying to smile naturally, while his heart continued to race and his hand throbbed and bled.
\par \lquote Have a Butterbeer.\rquote  Ron pressed a bottle on him. \lquote I can\rquote t believe it \endash  where\rquote s Hermione gone?\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s there,\rquote  said Fred, who was also swigging Butterbeer, and pointed to an armchair by the fire. Hermione was dozing in it, her drink tipping precariously in her hand.
\par \lquote Well, she said she was pleased when I told her,\rquote  said Ron, looking slightly put out.
\par \lquote Let her sleep,\rquote  said George hastily. It was a few moments before Harry noticed that several of the first-years gathered around them bore unmistakeable signs of recent nosebleeds.
\par \lquote Come here, Ron, and see if Oliver\rquote s old robes fit you,\rquote  called Katie Bell, \lquote we can take off his name and put yours on instead \'85\rquote 
\par As Ron moved away, Angelina came striding up to Harry.
\par \lquote Sorry I was a bit short with you earlier, Potter,\rquote  she said abruptly. \lquote It\rquote s stressful this managing lark, you know, I\rquote m starting to think I was a bit hard on Wood sometimes.\rquote 
 She was watching Ron over the rim of her goblet with a slight frown on her face.
\par \lquote Look, I know he\rquote s your best mate, but he\rquote s not fabulous,\rquote  she said bluntly. \lquote I think with a bit of training he\rquote ll be all right, though. He comes from a family of good Quidditch players. I\rquote 
m banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today, to be honest. Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better this evening, but Hooper\rquote s a real whiner, he\rquote s always moaning about something or other, and Vicky
\rquote s involved in all sorts of societies. She admitted herself that if training clashed with her Charms Club she\rquote d put Charms first. Anyway, we\rquote re having a practice session at two o\rquote clock tomorrow, so just make sure you\rquote re 
there this time. And do me a favour and help Ron as much as you can, OK?\rquote 
\par He nodded, and Angelina strolled back to Alicia Spinnet. Harry moved over to sit next to Hermione, who awoke with a jerk as he put down his bag.
\par \lquote Oh, Harry, it\rquote s you ... good about Ron, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  she said blearily. \lquote I\rquote m just so-so \endash  so tired,\rquote  she yawned. \lquote I was up until one o\rquote clock making more hats. They\rquote 
re disappearing like mad!\rquote 
\par And sure enough, now that he looked, Harry saw that there were woolly hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might accidentally pick them up.
\par \lquote Great,\rquote  said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon, he would burst. \lquote Listen, Hermione, I was just up in Umbridge\rquote s office and she touched my arm ...\rquote 
\par Hermione listened closely. When Harry had finished, she said slowly, \lquote You\rquote re worried You-Know-Who\rquote s controlling her like he controlled Quirrell?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Harry, dropping his voice, \lquote it\rquote s a possibility, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote I suppose so,\rquote  said Hermione, though she sounded unconvinced. \lquote But I don\rquote t think he can be }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 possessing }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

s. He could have her under the Imperius Curse, I suppose ...\rquote 
\par Harry watched Fred, George and Lee Jordan juggling empty Butterbeer bottles for a moment. Then Hermione said, \lquote But last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn\rquote 
t Dumbledore say it had to do with what You-Know-Who was feeling at the time? I mean, maybe this hasn\rquote t got anything to do with Umbridge at all, maybe it\rquote s just coincidence it happened while you were with her?\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s evil,\rquote  said Harry flatly. \lquote Twisted.\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s horrible, yes, but ... Harry, I think you ought to tell Dumbledore your scar hurt.\rquote 
\par It was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to Dumbledore and his answer to Hermione was just the same as his answer to Ron.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not bothering him with this. Like you just said, it\rquote s not a big deal. It\rquote s been hurting on and off all summer \endash  it was just a bit worse tonight, that\rquote s all \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, I\rquote m sure Dumbledore would }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 want }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 to be bothered by this 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, before he could stop himself, \lquote that\rquote s the only bit of me Dumbledore cares about, isn\rquote t it, my scar?\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t say that, it\rquote s not true!\rquote 
\par \lquote I think I\rquote ll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he thinks \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, you can\rquote t put something like that in a letter!\rquote  said Hermione, looking alarmed. \lquote Don\rquote t you remember, Moody told us to be careful what we put in writing! We just can\rquote t guarantee owls aren\rquote 
t being intercepted any more!\rquote 
\par \lquote All right, all right, I won\rquote t tell him, then!\rquote  said Harry irritably. He got to his feet. \lquote I\rquote m going to bed. Tell Ron for me, will you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh no,\rquote  said Hermione, looking relieved, \lquote if you\rquote re going that means I can go too, without being rude. I\rquote m absolutely exhausted and I want to make some more hats tomorrow. Listen, you can help me if you like, it\rquote 
s quite fun, I\rquote m getting better, I can do pat\-terns and bobbles and all sorts of things now.\rquote 
\par Harry looked into her face, which was shining with glee, and tried to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer.
\par \lquote Er ... no, I don\rquote t think I will, thanks,\rquote  he said. \lquote Er \endash  not tomorrow. I\rquote ve got loads of homework to do ...\rquote 
\par And he traipsed off to the boys\rquote  stairs, leaving her looking slightly disappointed.

Harry was first to wake up in his dormitory next morning. He lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the ray of sunlight coming through the gap in his four-poster\rquote 
s hangings, and savoured the thought that it was Saturday. The first week of term seemed to have dragged on for ever, like one gigantic History of Magic lesson.

, it was just after daybreak. He pulled open the curtains around his bed, got up and started to dress. The only sound apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow, deep breathing of his fellow Gryffindors. He opened his schoolbag care\-
fully, pulled out parchment and quill and headed out of the dormitory for the common room.
\par Making straight for his favourite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire, Harry settled himself down comfortably and unrolled his parchment while looking around the room. The detritus of crumpled-up bits of parchment, old Gobstones, empty ingre
\-dient jars and sweet wrappers that usually covered the common room at the end of each day was gone, as were all Hermione\rquote s elf hats. Wondering vaguely how many elves had now be
en set free whether they wanted to be or not, Harry uncorked his ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment, thinking hard ... but after a minute or so he found himself staring 
into the empty grate, at a complete loss for what to say.
\par He could now appreciate how hard it had been for Ron and Hermione to write him letters over the summer. How was he sup\-posed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose al
l the questions he was burning to ask without giving potential letter-thieves a lot of information he did not want them to have?
\par He sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace, then, finally coming to a decision, he dipped his quill into the ink bottle once more and set it resolutely on the parchment.

Harry reread the letter several times, trying to see it from the point of view of an outsider. He could not see how they would know what he was talking about \endash  or who he was talking to \endash 
 just from reading this letter. He did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about Hagrid and tell them when he might be back. Harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what Hagrid might be up to while he was not at Hogwarts.

 to write; sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been working on it and he could now hear distant sounds of movement from the dormitories above. Sealing the parchment care\-
fully, he climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the Owlery.
\par \lquote I would }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 go that way if I were you,\rquote

\par \lquote Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the person\rquote s head?\rquote  asked Harry.

said Nearly Headless Nick in a bored voice. \lquote Subtlety has never been Peeves\rquote s strong point. I\rquote m off to try and find the Bloody Baron ... he might be able to put a stop to it ... see you, Harry ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, bye,\rquote  said Harry and instead of turning right, he turned left, taking a longer but safer route up to the Owlery. His spirits rose as he walked past window after window showing
 brilliantly blue sky; he had training later, he would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last.
\par Something brushed his ankles. He looked down and saw the caretaker\rquote s skeletal grey cat, Mrs Norris, slinking past him. She turned lamplike yellow eyes on him for a moment before disap\-pearing behind a statue of Wilfred the Wistful.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not doing anything wrong,\rquote  Harry called after her. She had the unmistakeable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss, yet Harry could not see why; he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the Owlery on a Saturday morning.

\par The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the Owlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes; thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on r
afters, a little restless in the early-morning light, some clearly just returned from hunting. The straw-covered floor crunched a little as he stepped across tiny animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of Hedwig.
\par \lquote There you are,\rquote  he said, spotting her somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling. \lquote Get down here, I\rquote ve got a letter for you.\rquote 
\par With a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared down on to his shoulder.
\par \lquote Right, I know this says Snuffles on the outside,\rquote  he told her, giving her the letter to clasp in her beak and, without knowing exactly why, whispering, \lquote but it\rquote s for Sirius, OK?\rquote 
\par She blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she understood.
\par \lquote Safe flight, then,\rquote  said Harry and he carried her to one of the windows; with a moment\rquote 
s pressure on his arm, Hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky. He watched her until she became a tiny black speck and vanished, then switched his gaze to Hagrid\rquote s hut, clearly visible from this window, and just as clearly uninhabi
ted, the chimney smokeless, the curtains drawn.
\par The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze. Harry watched them, savouring the fresh air on his face, thinking about Quidditch later ... then he saw it. A great, reptilian winged horse, just
 like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leathery black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl\rquote 
s, rose up out of the trees like a grotesque, giant bird. It soared in a great circle, then plunged back into the trees. The whole thing had happened so quickly, Harry could hardly believe what he had seen, except that his heart was hammering madly.

\par The Owlery door opened behind him. He leapt in shock and, turning quickly, saw Cho Chang holding a letter and a parcel in her hands.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  said Harry automatically.
\par \lquote Oh ... hi,\rquote  she said breathlessly. \lquote I didn\rquote t think anyone would be up here this early ... I only remembered five minutes ago, it\rquote s my mum\rquote s birthday.\rquote 
\par She held up the parcel.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry. His brain seemed to have jammed. He wanted to say something funny and interesting, but the memory of that terrible winged horse was fresh in his mind.
\par \lquote Nice day,\rquote  he said, gesturing to the windows. His insides seemed to shrivel with embarrassment. The weather. He was talking about the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 weather ...}{

\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl. \lquote Good Quidditch conditions. I haven\rquote t been out all week, have you?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Cho had selected one of the school barn owls. She coaxed it down on to her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach the parcel.
\par \lquote Hey, has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet?\rquote  she asked.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote It\rquote s my friend Ron Weasley, d\rquote you know him?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Tornados-hater?\rquote  said Cho rather coolly. \lquote Is he any good?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote I think so. I didn\rquote t see his tryout, though, I was in detention.\rquote 
\par Cho looked up, the parcel only half-attached to the owl\rquote s legs.
\par \lquote That Umbridge woman\rquote s foul,\rquote  she said in a low voice. \lquote Putting you in detention just because you told the truth about how \endash  how \endash 
 how he died. Everyone heard about it, it was all over the school. You were really brave standing up to her like that.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s insides re-inflated so rapidly he felt as though he might actually float a few inches 
off the dropping-strewn floor. Who cared about a stupid flying horse; Cho thought he had been really brave. For a moment, he considered accidentally-on-purpose showing her his cut hand as he helped her tie her parcel on to her owl ... but the very instant
 this thrilling thought occurred, the Owlery door opened again.
\par Filch the caretaker came wheezing into the room. There were purple patches on his sunken, veined cheeks, his jowls were aquiver and his thin grey hair dishevelled; he had obviously run here. Mr
s Norris came trotting at his heels, gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing hungrily. There was a restless shifting of wings from above and a large brown owl snapped his beak in a menacing fashion.
\par \lquote Aha!\rquote  said Filch, taking a flat-footed step towards Harry, his pouchy cheeks trembling with anger. \lquote I\rquote ve had a tip-off that you are intending to place a massive order for Dungbombs!\rquote 
\par Harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker.
\par \lquote Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs?\rquote 
\par Cho was looking from Harry to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl on her arm, tired of standing on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it.
\par \lquote I have my sources,\rquote  said Filch in a self-satisfied hiss. \lquote Now hand over whatever it is you\rquote re sending.\rquote 
\par Feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off the letter, Harry said, \lquote I can\rquote t, it\rquote s gone.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Gone?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said Filch, his face contorting with rage.
\par \lquote Gone,\rquote  said Harry calmly.
\par Filch opened his mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then raked Harry\rquote s robes with his eyes.
\par \lquote How do I know you haven\rquote t got it in your pocket?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I saw him send it,\rquote  said Cho angrily.
\par Filch rounded on her.
\par \lquote You saw him \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s right, I saw him,\rquote  she said fiercely.
\par There was a moment\rquote s pause in which Filch glared at Cho and Cho glared right back, then the caretaker turned and shuffled back towards the door. He stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at Harry.
\par \lquote If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb ...\rquote 
\par He stumped off down the stairs. Mrs Norris cast a last longing look at the owls and followed him.
\par Harry and Cho looked at each other.
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  Harry said.
\par \lquote No problem,\rquote  said Cho, finally fixing the parcel to the barn owl\rquote s other leg, her face slightly pink. \lquote You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 weren\rquote t }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote I wonder why he thought you were, then?\rquote  she said as she car\-ried the owl to the window.
\par Harry shrugged. He was quite as mystified by that as she was, though oddly it was not bothering him very much at the moment.
\par They left the Owlery together. At the entrance of a corridor that led towards the west wing of the castle, Cho said, \lquote I\rquote m going this way. Well, I\rquote ll ... I\rquote ll see you around, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... see you.\rquote 
\par She smiled at him and departed. Harry walked on, feeling quietly elated. He had managed to have an entire conversation with her and not embarrassed himself once ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par Of course, she had preferred Cedric, he knew that ... though if he\rquote d only asked her to the Ball before Cedric had, things might have turned out differently ... she had seemed sincerely sorry that she\rquote d had to refuse when Harry asked her ...

\par \lquote Morning,\rquote  Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione as he joined them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall.
\par \lquote What are you looking so pleased about?\rquote  said Ron, eyeing Harry in surprise.
\par \lquote Erm ... Quidditch later,\rquote  said Harry happily, pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs towards him.
\par \lquote Oh ... yeah ...\rquote  said Ron. He put down the piece of toast he was eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice. Then he said, \lquote Listen ... you don\rquote t fancy going out a bit earlier with me, do you? Just to \endash  er \endash 
 give me some practice before training? So I can, you know, get my eye in a bit.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, OK,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Look, I don\rquote t think you should,\rquote  said Hermione seriously. \lquote You\rquote re both really behind on homework as it \endash \rquote 
\par But she broke off; the morning post was arriving and, as usual, the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
was soaring towards her in the beak of a screech owl, which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg. Hermione pushed a Knut into its leather pouch, took the newspaper, and scanned the front page critically as the owl took off.
\par \lquote Anything interesting?\rquote  said Ron. Harry grinned, knowing Ron was keen to keep her off the subject of homework.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  she sighed, \lquote just some guff about the bass player in the Weird Sisters getting married.\rquote 
\par Hermione opened the paper and disappeared behind it. Harry devoted himself to another helping of eggs and bacon. Ron was staring up at the high windows, looking slightly preoccupied.
\par \lquote Wait a moment,\rquote  said Hermione suddenly. \lquote Oh no ... Sirius!\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s happened?\rquote  said Harry, snatching at the paper so vio\-lently it ripped down the middle, with him and Hermione each holding one half.

\par \lquote Do you know, I wouldn\rquote t be at all surprised if that were true.\rquote

y good; he blocked three-quarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past him and played better the longer they prac\-tised. After a couple of hours they returned to the castle for lunch \endash 
 during which Hermione made it quite clear she thought they were irresponsible \endash  then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the real training session. All their teammates but Angelina were already in the changing room when they entered.
\par \lquote All right, Ron?\rquote  said George, winking at him.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Ron, who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch.
\par \lquote Ready to show us all up, Ickle Prefect?\rquote  said Fred, emerging tousle-haired from the neck of his Quidditch robes, a slightly mali\-cious grin on his face.
\par \lquote Shut up,\rquote  said Ron, stony-faced, pulling on his own team robes for the first time. They fitted him well considering they had been Oliver Wood\rquote s, who was rather broader in the shoulder.
\par \lquote OK, everyone,\rquote  said Angelina, entering from the Captain\rquote s office, already changed. \lquote Let\rquote s get to it; Alicia and Fred, if you can 
just bring out the ball crate for us. Oh, and there are a couple of people out there watching but I want you to just ignore them, all right?\rquote 
\par Something in her would-be casual voice made Harry think he might know who the uninvited spectators were, and sure 
enough, when they left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch it was to a storm of catcalls and jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch team and assorted hangers-on, who were grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly ar
ound the stadium.
\par \lquote What\rquote s that Weasley\rquote s riding?\rquote  Malfoy called in his sneering drawl. \lquote Why would anyone put a flying charm on a mouldy old log like that?\rquote 
\par Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter. Ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and Harry followed him, watching his ears turn red from behind.
\par \lquote Ignore them,\rquote  he said, accelerating to catch up with Ron, \lquote we\rquote ll see who\rquote s laughing after we play them ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Exactly the attitude I want, Harry,\rquote  said Angelina approvingly, soaring around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot in front of her airborne team. \lquote OK, everyone, we\rquote 
re going to start with some passes just to warm up, the whole team please \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hey, Johnson, what\rquote s with that hairstyle, anyway?\rquote  shrieked Pansy Parkinson from below. \lquote Why would anyone want to look like they\rquote ve got worms coming out of their head?\rquote 
\par Angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and con\-tinued calmly, \lquote Spread out, then, and let\rquote s see what we can do ...\rquote 
\par Harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch. Ron fell back towards the opposite goal. Angelina raised the Quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who passed to Harry, who passed to Ron, who dropped it.

\par The Slytherins, led by Malfoy, roared and screamed with laughter. Ron, who had pelted towards the ground to catch the Quaffle before it landed, pulled out of the dive untidily, so that he slipped sideways on his broom, and returned to playing height, blus
hing. Harry saw Fred and George exchange looks, but unchar\-acteristically neither of them said anything, for which he was grateful.
\par \lquote Pass it on, Ron,\rquote  called Angelina, as though nothing had happened.
\par Ron threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to Harry, who passed to George ...
\par \lquote Hey, Potter, how\rquote s your scar feeling?\rquote  called Malfoy. \lquote Sure you don\rquote t need a lie down? It must be, what, a whole week since you were in the hospital wing, that\rquote s a record for you, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par George passed to Angelina; she reverse-passed to Harry, who had not been expecting it, but caught it in the very tips of his fingers and passed it quickly to Ron, who lunged for it and missed by inches.
\par \lquote Come on now, Ron,\rquote  said Angelina crossly, as he dived for the ground again, chasing the Quaffle. \lquote Pay attention.\rquote 
\par It would have been hard to say whether Ron\rquote s face or the Quaffle was a deeper scarlet when he again returned to playing height. Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team were howling with laughter.
\par On his third attempt, Ron caught the Quaffle; perhaps out of relief he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight through Katie\rquote s outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face.
\par \lquote Sorry!\rquote  Ron groaned, zooming forwards to see whether he had done any damage.
\par \lquote Get back in position, she\rquote s fine!\rquote  barked Angelina. \lquote But as you\rquote re passing to a teammate, do try not to knock her off her broom, won\rquote t you? We\rquote ve got Bludgers for that!\rquote 
\par Katie\rquote s nose was bleeding. Down below, the Slytherins were stamping their feet and jeering. Fred and George converged on Katie.
\par \lquote Here, take this,\rquote  Fred told her, handing her something small and purple from out of his pocket, \lquote it\rquote ll clear it up in no time.\rquote 
\par \lquote All right,\rquote  called Angelina, \lquote Fred, George, go and get your bats and a Bludger. Ron, get up to the goalposts. Harry, release the Snitch when I say so. We\rquote re going to aim for Ron\rquote s goal, obviously.\rquote 
\par Harry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the Snitch.
\par \lquote Ron\rquote s making a right pig\rquote s ear of things, isn\rquote t he?\rquote  muttered George, as the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls and opened it to extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch.
\par \lquote He\rquote s just nervous,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote he was fine when I was prac\-tising with him this morning.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, well, I hope he hasn\rquote t peaked too soon,\rquote  said Fred gloomily.
\par They returned to the air. When Angelina blew her whistle, Harry released the Snitch and Fred and George let fly the Bludger. From that moment on, Harry was barely aware of what the others were doing. It was his job to recapture t
he tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth a hundred and fifty points to the Seeker\rquote 
s team and doing so required enormous speed and skill. He accelerated, rolling and swerving in and out of the Chasers, the warm autumn air whipping his face, and the dis
tant yells of the Slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ears ... but too soon, the whistle brought him to a halt again.
\par \lquote Stop \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 stop \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 STOP!\rquote  screamed Angelina. \lquote Ron 
\endash  you\rquote re not covering your middle post!\rquote 
\par Harry looked round at Ron, who was hovering in front of the left-hand hoop, leaving the other two completely unprotected.
\par \lquote Oh ... sorry ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You keep shifting around while you\rquote re watching the Chasers!\rquote  said Angelina. \lquote Either stay in centre position until you have to move to defend a hoop, or else circle the hoops, but don\rquote 
t drift vaguely off to one side, that\rquote s how you let in the last three goals!\rquote 
\par \lquote Sorry ...\rquote  Ron repeated, his red face shining like a beacon against the bright blue sky.
\par \lquote And Katie, can\rquote t you do something about that nosebleed?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s just getting worse!\rquote  said Katie thickly, attempting to stem the flow with her sleeve.
\par Harry glanced round at Fred, who was looking anxious and checking his pockets. He saw Fred pull out something purple, examine it for a second and then look round at Katie, evidently horror-struck.
\par \lquote Well, let\rquote s try again,\rquote  said Angelina. She was ignoring the Slytherins, who had now set up a chant of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote

\par This time they had been flying for barely three minutes when Angelina\rquote s whistle sounded. Harry, who had just sighted the Snitch circling the opposite goalpost, pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved.
\par \lquote What now?\rquote  he said impatiently to Alicia, who was nearest.
\par \lquote Katie,\rquote  she said shortly.
\par Harry turned and saw Angelina, Fred and George all flying as fast as they could towards Katie. Harry and Alicia sped towards her, too. It was plain that Angelina had stopped training just in time; Katie was now chalk white and covered in blood.
\par \lquote She needs the hospital wing,\rquote  said Angelina.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll take her,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote She \endash  er \endash  might have swallowed a Blood Blisterpod by mistake \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Well, there\rquote s no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser gone,\rquote  said Angelina glumly as Fred and George zoomed off towards the castle supporting Katie between them. \lquote Come on, let\rquote s go and get changed.\rquote 

\par The Slytherins continued to chant as they trailed back into the changing rooms.
\par \lquote How was practice?\rquote  asked Hermione rather coolly half an hour later, as Harry and Ron climbed through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room.
\par \lquote It was \endash \rquote  Harry began.
\par \lquote Completely lousy,\rquote  said Ron in a hollow voice, sinking into a chair beside Hermione. She looked up at Ron and her frostiness seemed to melt.
\par \lquote Well, it was only your first one,\rquote  she said consolingly, \lquote it\rquote s bound to take time to \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Who said it was me who made it lousy?\rquote  snapped Ron.
\par \lquote No one,\rquote  said Hermione, looking taken aback, \lquote I thought \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You thought I was bound to be rubbish?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, of course I didn\rquote t! Look, you said it was lousy so I just \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m going to get started on some homework,\rquote  said Ron angrily and stomped off to the staircase to the boys\rquote  dormitories and van\-ished from sight. Hermione turned to Harry.

\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry loyally.
\par Hermione raised her eyebrows.
\par \lquote Well, I suppose he could\rquote ve played better,\rquote  Harry muttered, \lquote but it was only the first training session, like you said ...\rquote 
\par Neither Harry nor Ron seemed to make much headway with their homework that night. Harry knew Ron was too preoccupied with how badly he had performed at Quidditch practice and he himself was having difficulty in getting the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Gryffindor are losers\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 chant out of his head.
\par They spent the whole of Sunday in the common room, buried in their books while the room around them filled up, then emp\-
tied. It was another clear, fine day and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent the day out in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that y
ear. By the evening, Harry felt as though somebody had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull.
\par \lquote You know, we probably should try and get more homework done during the week,\rquote  Harry muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside Professor McGonagall\rquote 
s long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus Spell and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra\rquote s equally long and difficult essay about Jupiter\rquote s many moons.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Ron, rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them. \lquote Listen ... shall we just ask Hermione if we can have a look at what she\rquote s done?\rquote 
\par Harry glanced over at her; she was sitting with Crookshanks on her lap and chatting merrily to Ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair in front of her, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  he said heavily, \lquote you know she won\rquote t let us.\rquote 
\par And so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became steadily darker. Slowly, the crowd in the common room began to thin again. At half past eleven, Hermione wandered over to them, yawning.
\par \lquote Nearly done?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Ron shortly.
\par \lquote Jupiter\rquote s biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,\rquote  she said, pointing over Ron\rquote s shoulder at a line in his Astronomy essay, \lquote and it\rquote s Io that\rquote s got the volcanoes.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  snarled Ron, scratching out the offending sentences.
\par \lquote Sorry, I only \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, well, if you\rquote ve just come over here to criticise \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ron \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I haven\rquote t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I\rquote m up to my neck in it here \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No \endash  look!\rquote 
\par Hermione was pointing to the nearest window. Harry and Ron both looked over. A handsome screech owl was standing on the windowsill, gazing into the room at Ron.
\par \lquote Isn\rquote t that Hermes?\rquote  said Hermione, sounding amazed.
\par \lquote Blimey, it is!\rquote  said Ron quietly, throwing down his quill and get\-ting to his feet. \lquote What\rquote s Percy writing to me for?\rquote 
\par He crossed to the window and opened it; Hermes flew inside, landed on Ron\rquote s essay and held out a leg to which a letter was attached. Ron took the letter off it and the owl departed at once, leaving inky footprints across Ron\rquote 
s drawing of the moon Io.
\par \lquote That\rquote s definitely Percy\rquote s handwriting,\rquote  said Ron, sinking back into his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par \lquote Open it!\rquote  said Hermione eagerly, and Harry nodded.
\par Ron unrolled the scroll and began to read. The further down the parchment his eyes travelled, the more pronounced became his scowl. When he had finish
ed reading, he looked disgusted. He thrust the letter at Harry and Hermione, who leaned towards each other to read it together:

\par \lquote What you can say is, \'93We promise we\rquote ll never leave our home\-work this late again,\'94\rquote  she said, holding out both hands for their essays, but she looked slightly amused all the same.
\par \lquote Thanks a million, Hermione,\rquote  said Harry weakly, passing over his essay and sinking back into his armchair, rubbing his eyes.
\par It was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but for the three of them and Crookshanks. The only sound was that of Hermione\rquote 
s quill scratching out sentences here and there on their essays and the ruffle of pages as she checked various facts in the reference books strewn across the table. Harry was exhausted. He also felt an odd, si
ck, empty feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire.
\par He knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought him strange, even mad; he knew that the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 had been making snide allusions to him for months, but there was something about seeing it written down like that in Percy\rquote 
s writing, about knowing that Percy was advising Ron to drop him and even to tell tales about him to Umbridge, that made his sit
uation real to him as nothing else had. He had known Percy for four years, had stayed in his house during the summer holidays, shared a tent with him during the Quidditch World Cup, had even been awarded full marks by him in the second task of the Triwiza
rd Tournament last year, yet now, Percy thought him unbalanced and possibly violent.
\par And with a surge of sympathy for his godfather, Harry thought Sirius was probably the only person he knew who could really understand how he felt at the moment, because Sir
ius was in the same situation. Nearly everyone in the wizarding world thought Sirius a dangerous murderer and a great Voldemort supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge for fourteen years ...
\par Harry blinked. He had just seen something in the fire that could not have been there. It had flashed into sight and vanished imme\-diately. No ... it could not have been ... he had imagined it because he had been thinking about Sirius ...
\par \lquote OK, write that down,\rquote  Hermione said to Ron, pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own writing back to Ron, \lquote then add this conclusion I\rquote ve written for you.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I\rquote ve ever met,\rquote  said Ron weakly, \lquote and if I\rquote m ever rude to you again \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  I\rquote ll know you\rquote re back to normal,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Harry, yours is OK except for this bit at the end, I think you must have misheard Professor Sinistra, Europa\rquote s covered in ice, not mice \endash  Harry?
\rquote 
\par Harry had slid off his chair on to his knees and was now crouching on the singed and threadbare hearthrug, gazing into the flames.
\par \lquote Er \endash  Harry?\rquote  said Ron uncertainly. \lquote Why are you down there?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because I\rquote ve just seen Sirius\rquote s head in the fire,\rquote  said Harry.
\par He spoke quite calmly; after all, he had seen Sirius\rquote s head in this very fire the previous year and talked to it, too; nevertheless, he could not be sure that he had really seen it this time ... it had vanished so quickly ...
\par \lquote Sirius\rquote s head?\rquote  Hermione repeated. \lquote You mean like when he wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament? But he wouldn\rquote t do that now, it would be too \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par She gasped, gazing at the fire; Ron dropped his quill. There in the middle of the dancing flames sat Sirius\rquote s head, long dark hair falling around his grinning face.
\par \lquote I was starting to think you\rquote d go to bed before everyone else had disappeared,\rquote  he said. \lquote I\rquote ve been checking every hour.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote ve been popping into the fire every hour?\rquote  Harry said, half-laughing.
\par \lquote Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear.\rquote 
\par \lquote But what if you\rquote d been seen?\rquote  said Hermione anxiously.
\par \lquote Well, I think a girl \endash  first-year, by the look of her \endash  might\rquote ve got a glimpse of me earlier, but don\rquote t worry,\rquote  Sirius said hastily, as Hermione clapped a hand to her mouth, \lquote 
I was gone the moment she looked back at me and I\rquote ll bet she just thought I was an oddly-shaped log or something.\rquote 
\par \lquote But, Sirius, this is taking an awful risk \endash \rquote  Hermione began.
\par \lquote You sound like Molly,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote This was the only way I could come up with of answering Harry\rquote s letter without resorting to a code \endash  and codes are breakable.\rquote 
\par At the mention of Harry\rquote s letter, Hermione and Ron both turned to stare at him.
\par \lquote You didn\rquote t say you\rquote d written to Sirius!\rquote  said Hermione accusingly.
\par \lquote I forgot,\rquote  said Harry, which was perfectly true; his meeting with Cho in the Owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind. \lquote Don\rquote 
t look at me like that, Hermione, there was no way anyone would have got secret information out of it, was there, Sirius?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, it was very good,\rquote  said Sirius, smiling. \lquote Anyway, we\rquote d better be quick, just in case we\rquote re disturbed \endash  your scar.\rquote 
\par \lquote What about \endash ?\rquote  Ron began, but Hermione interrupted him.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll tell you afterwards. Go on, Sirius.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I know it can\rquote t be fun when it hurts, but we don\rquote t think it\rquote s anything to really worry about. It kept aching all last year, didn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion,\rquote  said Harry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and Hermione\rquote s winces. \lquote So maybe he was just, I dunno, really angry or something the night 
I had that detention.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, now he\rquote s back it\rquote s bound to hurt more often,\rquote  said Sirius.
\par \lquote So you don\rquote t think it had anything to do with Umbridge touching me when I was in detention with her?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote I doubt it,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote I know her by reputation and I\rquote m sure she\rquote s no Death Eater \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s foul enough to be one,\rquote  said Harry darkly, and Ron and Hermione nodded vigorously in agreement.
\par \lquote Yes, but the world isn\rquote t split into good people and Death Eaters,\rquote  said Sirius with a wry smile. \lquote I know she\rquote s a nasty piece of work, though \endash  you should hear Remus talk about her.\rquote 
\par \lquote Does Lupin know her?\rquote  asked Harry quickly, remembering Umbridge\rquote s comments about dangerous half-breeds during her first lesson.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Sirius, \lquote but she drafted a bit of anti-werewolf legisla\-tion two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job.\rquote 
\par Harry remembered how much shabbier Lupin looked these days and his dislike of Umbridge deepened even further.
\par \lquote What\rquote s she got against werewolves?\rquote  said Hermione angrily.
\par \lquote Scared of them, I expect,\rquote  said Sirius, smiling at her indigna\-tion. \lquote 
Apparently, she loathes part-humans; she campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year, too. Imagine wasting your time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags like Kreacher on the loose.\rquote 
\par Ron laughed but Hermione looked upset.
\par \lquote Sirius!\rquote  she said reproachfully. \lquote Honestly, if you made a bit of an effort with Kreacher, I\rquote m sure he\rquote d respond. After all, you are the only member of his family he\rquote s got left, and Professor Dumbledore said 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote So, what are Umbridge\rquote s lessons like?\rquote  Sirius interrupted. \lquote Is she training you all to kill half-breeds?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, ignoring Hermione\rquote s affronted look at being cut off in her defence of Kreacher. \lquote She\rquote s not letting us use magic at all!\rquote 
\par \lquote All we do is read the stupid textbook,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Ah, well, that figures,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote Our information from inside the Ministry is that Fudge doesn\rquote t want you trained in combat.\rquote

What does he think we\rquote re doing here, forming some sort of wizard army?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s exactly what he thinks you\rquote re doing,\rquote  said Sirius, \lquote or, rather, that\rquote s exactly what he\rquote s afraid Dumbledore\rquote s doing \endash  forming his own private army, with which he will be able t
o take on the Ministry of Magic.\rquote 
\par There was a pause at this, then Ron said, \lquote That\rquote s the most stupid thing I\rquote ve ever heard, including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood comes out with.\rquote 
\par \lquote So we\rquote re being prevented from learning Defence Against the Dark Arts because Fudge is scared we\rquote ll use spells against the Ministry?\rquote  said Hermione, looking furious.
\par \lquote Yep,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote Fudge thinks Dumbledore will stop at nothing to seize power. He\rquote s getting more paranoid about Dumbledore by the day. It\rquote s a matter of time before he has Dumbledore arrested on some trumped-up charge.
\rquote 
\par This reminded Harry of Percy\rquote s letter.

\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Sirius, \lquote I haven\rquote t seen anyone from the Order all weekend, they\rquote re all busy. It\rquote s just been Kreacher and me here ...\rquote 
\par There was a definite note of bitterness in Sirius\rquote s voice.
\par \lquote So you haven\rquote t had any news about Hagrid, either?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah ...\rquote  said Sirius, \lquote well, he was supposed to be back by now, no one\rquote s sure what\rquote s happened to him.\rquote  Then, seeing their stricken faces, he added quickly, \lquote But Dumbledore\rquote s not worried, so don
\rquote t you three get yourselves in a state; I\rquote m sure Hagrid\rquote s fine.\rquote 
\par \lquote But if he was supposed to be back by now ...\rquote  said Hermione in a small, anxious voice.
\par \lquote Madame Maxime was with him, we\rquote ve been in touch with her and she says they got separated on the journey home \endash  but there\rquote s nothing to suggest he\rquote s hurt or \endash  well, nothing to suggest he\rquote s not perfectly OK.
\rquote 
\par Unconvinced, Harry, Ron and Hermione exchanged worried looks.
\par \lquote Listen, don\rquote t go asking too many questions about Hagrid,\rquote  said Sirius hastily, \lquote it\rquote ll just draw even more attention to the fact that he\rquote s not back and I know Dumbledore doesn\rquote t want that. Hagrid\rquote 
s tough, he\rquote ll be OK.\rquote  And when they did not appear cheered by this, Sirius added, \lquote When\rquote s your next Hogsmeade weekend, anyway? I was thinking, we got away with the dog disguise at the station, didn\rquote

\par \lquote Yeah, but we think this time they have,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Something Malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you, and his father was on the platform, Sirius \endash  you know, Lucius Malfoy \endash  so don\rquote

\par \lquote All right, all right, I\rquote ve got the point,\rquote  said Sirius. He looked most displeased. \lquote Just an idea, thought you might like to get together.\rquote 
\par \lquote I would, I just don\rquote t want you chucked back in Azkaban!\rquote  said Harry.
\par There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry, a crease between his sunken eyes.
\par \lquote You\rquote re less like your father than I thought,\rquote  he said finally, a definite coolness in his voice. \lquote The risk would\rquote ve been what made it fun for James.\rquote

\par Harry realised that Hermione was looking sideways to see what grade he had received; he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as possible, feeling that he would rather keep that information private.
\par Determined not to give Snape an excuse to fail him this lesson, Harry read and reread every line of instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them. His Strengthening So

\par Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll. When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full flow about OWL grades.
\par \lquote So top grade\rquote s \'93O\'94 for \'93Outstanding\'94,\rquote  she was saying, \lquote and then there\rquote s \'93A\'94 \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, \'93E\'94,\rquote  George corrected her, \lquote \'93E\'94 for \'93Exceeds Expectations\'94. And I\rquote ve always thought Fred and I should\rquote ve got \'93E\'94 in every\-

\par They all laughed except Hermione, who ploughed on, \lquote So, after \'93E\'94 it\rquote s \'93A\'94 for \'93Acceptable\'94, and that\rquote s the last pass grade, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yep,\rquote  said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his soup, transferring it to his mouth and swallowing it whole.
\par \lquote Then you get \'93P\'94 for \'93Poor\'94 \endash \rquote  Ron raised both his arms in mock celebration \endash  \lquote and \'93D\'94 for \'93Dreadful\'94.\rquote 
\par \lquote And then \'93T\'94,\rquote  George reminded him.
\par \lquote \'93T\'94?\rquote  asked Hermione, looking appalled. \lquote Even lower than a \'93D\'94? What on earth does \'93T\'94 stand for?\rquote 
\par \lquote \'93Troll\'94,\rquote  said George promptly.
\par Harry laughed again, though he was not sure whether or not George was joking. He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione that he had received \lquote T\rquote s in all his OWLs and immediately resolved to work harder from now on.
\par \lquote You lot had an inspected lesson yet?\rquote  Fred asked them.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Hermione at once. \lquote Have you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Just now, before lunch,\rquote  said George. \lquote Charms.\rquote 
\par \lquote What was it like?\rquote  Harry and Hermione asked together.
\par Fred shrugged.
\par \lquote Not that bad. Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard. You know what Flitwick\rquote s like, he treated her like a guest, didn\rquote t seem to bother him at all. She didn\rquote 
t say much. Asked Alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are nor\-mally like, Alicia told her they were really good, that was it.\rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t see old Flitwick getting marked down,\rquote  said George, \lquote he usually gets everyone through their exams all right.\rquote 
\par \lquote Who\rquote ve you got this afternoon?\rquote  Fred asked Harry.
\par \lquote Trelawney \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote A \'93T\'94 if ever I saw one.\rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and Umbridge herself.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today,\rquote  said George. Angelina\rquote ll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices.\rquote 
\par But Harry did not have to wait for Defence Against the Dark Arts to meet Professor Umbridge. He was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back
 of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed him in the ribs and, looking round, he saw Professor Umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor. The class, which had been talking cheerily, fell silent at once. The abrupt fall in the noise level 
made Professor Trelawney, who had been wafting about handing out copies of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Dream Oracle, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 look round.
\par \lquote Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge with her wide smile. \lquote You received my note, I trust? Giving the time and date of your inspection?\rquote 
\par Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very disgrun\-tled, turned her back on Professor Umbridge and continued to give out books. Still smiling, Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the 
class so that it was a few inches behind Professor Trelawney\rquote s seat. She then sat down, took her clipboard from her flowery bag and looked up expectantly, waiting for the class to begin.
\par Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses.
\par \lquote We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today,\rquote  she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her voice shook slightly. \lquote Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each other\rquote 
s latest night-time visions with the aid of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Oracle.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Umbridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left towards Parvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati\rquote s most recent dream.
\par Harry opened his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Dream Oracle, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
watching Umbridge covertly. She was already making notes on her clipboard. After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawney\rquote s wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there. H
arry bent his head hurriedly over his book.
\par \lquote Think of a dream, quick,\rquote  he told Ron, \lquote in case the old toad comes our way.\rquote 
\par \lquote I did it last time,\rquote  Ron protested, \lquote it\rquote s your turn, you tell me one.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, I dunno ...\rquote  said Harry desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days. \lquote Let\rquote s say I dreamed I was ... drowning Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, that\rquote ll do ...\rquote 
\par Ron chortled as he opened his }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Dream Oracle.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote OK, we\rquote ve got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the number of letters in the subject ... would that be \'93drowning\'94 or \'93cauldron\'94 or \'93Snape\'94?\rquote 
\par \lquote It doesn\rquote t matter, pick any of them,\rquote  said Harry, chancing a glance behind him. Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Trelawney\rquote 
s shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned Neville about his dream diary.
\par \lquote What night did you dream this again?\rquote  Ron said, immersed in calculations.
\par \lquote I dunno, last night, whenever you like,\rquote  Harry told hi
m, trying to listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney. They were only a table away from him and Ron now. Professor Umbridge was making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking extremely put out.
\par \lquote Now,\rquote  said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, \lquote you\rquote ve been in this post how long, exactly?\rquote 
\par Professor Trelawney scowled at her, arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection. After a slight p
ause in which she seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it, she said in a deeply resentful tone, \lquote Nearly sixteen years.\rquote 
\par \lquote Quite a period,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her clipboard. \lquote So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney shortly.
\par Professor Umbridge made another note.
\par \lquote And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher.
\par Another note on the clipboard.
\par \lquote But I think \endash  correct me if I am mistaken \endash  that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of Second Sight?\rquote 
\par \lquote These things often skip \endash  er \endash  three generations,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney.
\par Professor Umbridge\rquote s toadlike smile widened.
\par \lquote Of course,\rquote  she said sweetly, making yet another note. \lquote Well, if you could just predict something for me, then?\rquote  And she looked up enquiringly, still smiling.
\par Professor Trelawney stiffened as though unable to believe her ears. \lquote I don\rquote t understand you,\rquote  she said, clutching convulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck.
\par \lquote I\rquote d like you to make a prediction for me,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge very clearly.
\par Harry and Ron were not the only people now watching and lis\-tening sneakily from behind their books. Most of the class were staring transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew herself up to her full height, her beads and bangles clinking.
\par \lquote The Inner Eye does not See upon command!\rquote  she said in scan\-dalised tones.
\par \lquote I see,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge softly, making yet another note on her clipboard.
\par \lquote I \endash  but \endash  but ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 wait!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
 said Professor Trelawney suddenly, in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice, though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger. \lquote I ... I think I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 do }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 see something ... something that concerns }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Umbridge who continued to smile blandly at her, eyebrows raised.
\par \lquote I am afraid ... I am afraid that you are in grave danger!\rquote  Professor Trelawney finished dramatically.
\par There was a pause. Professor Umbridge\rquote s eyebrows were still raised.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  she said softly, scribbling on her clipboard once more. \lquote Well, if that\rquote s really the best you can do ...\rquote 
\par She turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted to the spot, her chest heaving. Harry caught Ron\rquote s eye and knew that Ron was thinking exactly the same as he was: they both knew th
at Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the other hand, they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Trelawney\rquote s side \endash  until she swooped down on them a few seconds later, that is.
\par \lquote Well?\rquote  she said, snapping her long fingers under Harry\rquote s nose, uncharacteristically brisk. \lquote Let me see the start you\rquote ve made on your dream diary, please.\rquote 
\par And by the time she had interpreted Harry\rquote s dreams at the top of her voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating por\-
ridge, apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), he was feeling much less sympathetic towards her. All the while, Professor Umbridge stood a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first
 and was waiting for them all when they reached their Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later.
\par She was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room. Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Defensive Magical Theory, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
but before Hermione could ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell.
\par \lquote Wands away,\rquote  she instructed them all with a smile, and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out, sadly returned them to their bags. \lquote 
As we finished Chapter One last lesson, I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence \'93Chapter Two, Common Defensive Theories and their Derivation\'94. There will be no need to talk.\rquote 
\par Still smiling her wide, self-satisfied smile, she sat down at her desk. The class gave an audible sigh as it turned, as one, to page nineteen. Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chap\-ters in the book to keep them reading through all this year
\rquote s les\-sons and was on the point of checking the contents page when he noticed that Hermione had her hand in the air again.
\par Professor Umbridge had noticed, too, and what was more, she seemed to have worked out a strategy for j
ust such an eventuality. Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face to face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the class could not hear, 
\lquote What is it this time, Miss Granger?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve already read Chapter Two,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Well then, proceed to Chapter Three.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve read that too. I\rquote ve read the whole book.\rquote 
\par Professor Umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly.
\par \lquote Well, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counter-jinxes in Chapter Fifteen.\rquote 
\par \lquote He says that counter-jinxes are improperly named,\rquote  said Hermione promptly. \lquote He says \'93counter-jinx\'94 is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable.\rquote 
\par Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows and Harry knew she was impressed, against her will.
\par \lquote But I disagree,\rquote  Hermione continued.
\par Professor Umbridge\rquote s eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder.
\par \lquote You disagree?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I do,\rquote  said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whis\-pering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted the attention of the rest of the class. \lquote Mr Slinkhard doesn\rquote

\par \lquote Oh, you do, do you?\rquote  said Professor Umbridge, forgetting to whisper and straightening up. \lquote Well, I\rquote m afraid it is Mr Slinkhard\rquote s opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss Granger.\rquote 
\par \lquote But \endash \rquote  Hermione began.
\par \lquote That is enough,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge. She walked back to the front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone. \lquote 
Miss Granger, I am going to take five points from Gryffindor house.\rquote 
\par There was an outbreak of muttering at this.
\par \lquote What for?\rquote  said Harry angrily.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you get involved!\rquote  Hermione whispered urgently to him.
\par \lquote For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge smoothly. \lquote I am here to teach you using a Ministry-approved method that does not include inviting students to give their opin\-
ions on matters about which they understand very little. Your pre\-vious teachers in this subject may have allowed you more licence, but as none of them \endash  with the pos
sible exception of Professor Quirrell, who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age-appropriate subjects \endash  would have passed a Ministry inspection \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,\rquote  said Harry loudly, \lquote there was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head.\rquote 
\par This pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences Harry had ever heard. Then \endash 
\par \lquote I think another week\rquote s detentions would do you some good, Mr Potter,\rquote  said Umbridge sleekly.

terrupt me? You see, I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking.\rquote 
\par Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face. She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously.
\par Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more.
\par \lquote As I was saying: the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be Vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a chal
lenge; the mouse, as a mammal, offers a much greater one. This is not, therefore, magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner. So \endash  you know the incantation, let me see what you can do ...\rquote 
\par \lquote How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with Umbridge!\rquote  Harry muttered to Ron under his breath, but he was grin\-ning \endash  his anger with Professor McGonagall had quite evaporated.
\par Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she realised Professor McGonagall would not permit it. She did, how\-
ever, take many more notes while sitting in her corner, and when Professor McGonagall finally told them all to pack away, she rose with a grim expression on her face.
\par \lquote Well, it\rquote s a start,\rquote  said Ron, holding up a long wriggling mouse-tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around.
\par As they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw Professor Umbridge approach the teacher\rquote s desk; he nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop.
\par \lquote How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?\rquote  Professor Umbridge asked.
\par \lquote Thirty-nine years this December,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall brusquely, snapping her bag shut.
\par Professor Umbridge made a note.
\par \lquote Very well,\rquote  she said, \lquote you will receive the results of your inspec\-tion in ten days\rquote  time.\rquote 
\par \lquote I can hardly wait,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, in a coldly indif\-ferent voice, and she strode off towards the door. \lquote Hurry up, you three,\rquote  she added, sweeping Harry, Ron and Hermione before her.
\par Harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return.
\par He had thought that the next time he would see Umbridge would be in his detention that evening, but he was wrong. When they walked do
wn the lawns towards the Forest for Care of Magical Creatures, they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside Professor Grubbly-Plank.
\par \lquote You do not usually take this class, is that correct?\rquote  Harry heard her ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of cap\-tive Bowtruckles were scrabbling around for woodlice like so many living twigs.
\par \lquote Quite correct,\rquote  said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet. \lquote I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid.\rquote 
\par Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione. Malfoy was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; he would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry.
\par \lquote Hmm,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, though Harry could still hear her quite clearly. \lquote I wonder \endash  the Headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter \endash  can }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid\rquote s very extended leave of absence?\rquote 

\par Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly.
\par \lquote \rquote Fraid I can\rquote t,\rquote  said Professor Grubbly-Plank breezily. \lquote Don\rquote t know anything more about it than you do. Got an owl from Dumbledore, would I like a couple of weeks\rquote  teaching work. I accepted. That\rquote 
s as much as I know. Well ... shall I get started then?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, please do,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge, scribbling on her clip\-board.
\par Umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered amongst the students, questioning them on magical creatures. Most people were able to answer well and Harry\rquote s spirits lifted some\-what; at least the class was not letting Hagrid down.

\par \lquote Overall,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor Grubbly-Plank\rquote s side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, \lquote how do you, as a temporary member of staff \endash  an objective outsider, I suppose you might say 
\endash  how do you find Hogwarts? Do you feel you receive enough support from the school management?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yes, Dumbledore\rquote s excellent,\rquote  said Professor Grubbly-Plank heartily. \lquote Yes, I\rquote m very happy with the way things are run, very happy indeed.\rquote 
\par Looking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny note on her clipboard and went on, \lquote And what are you planning to cover with this class this year \endash  assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not return?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, I\rquote ll take them through the creatures that most often come up in OWL,\rquote  said Professor Grubbly-Plank. \lquote Not much left to do \endash  they\rquote ve studied unicorns and Nifflers, I thought we\rquote 
d cover Porlocks and Kneazles, make sure they can recognise Crups and Knarls, you know ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 seem to know what you\rquote re doing, at any rate,\rquote 
 said Professor Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard. Harry did not like the emphasis she put on }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote you\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and liked it even less when she put her next question to Goyle. \lquote Now, I hear there have been injuries in this class?\rquote 
\par Goyle gave a stupid grin. Malfoy hastened to answer the ques\-tion.
\par \lquote That was me,\rquote  he said. \lquote I was slashed by a Hippogriff.\rquote 
\par \lquote A Hippogriff?\rquote  said Professor Umbridge, now scribbling franti\-cally.
\par \lquote Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,\rquote  said Harry angrily.
\par Both Ron and Hermione groaned. Professor Umbridge turned her head slowly in Harry\rquote s direction.
\par \lquote Another night\rquote s detention, I think,\rquote  she said softly. \lquote Well, thank you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that\rquote s all I need here. You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days.\rquote 

\par \lquote Jolly good,\rquote  said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle.

\par He was suddenly so tired he was tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there, but instead he forced himself to his feet and followed Ron upstairs. 
His restless night was punctuated once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again.

Hermione made no mention of Harry giving Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original sugges\-tion. Harry\rquote 
s detentions with Umbridge were finally over (he doubted whether the words now etched into the back of his hand would e

\par \lquote You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Harry,\rquote  said Hermione gently, \lquote but all the same, there\rquote s no point pretending that you\rquote re not good at Defence Against the Dark Arts, because you are. You were the only person last year who could throw o

\par When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, \lquote Listen, Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defence Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem interested. We\rquote 
ve told them to meet us in Hogsmeade.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t worry, Harry,\rquote  Hermione said quietly. \lquote You\rquote ve got enough on your plate without Sirius, too.\rquote 
\par She was quite right, of course, he was barely keeping up with his homework, though he was doing much better now that he
 was no longer spending every evening in detention with Umbridge. Ron was even further behind with his work than Harry, because while they both had Quidditch practice twice a week, Ron also had his prefect duties. However, Hermione, who was taking more su
bjects than either of them, had not only finished all her home\-work but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes. Harry had to admit that she was getting better; it was now almost always pos\-sible to distinguish between the hats and the socks.

\par The mor
ning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. After breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village. With a slight pang, Harry r
emembered that if it hadn\rquote t been for Sirius, he would not have been going at all.
\par When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry. Then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on, out on to the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day.
\par \lquote Er \endash  why was Filch sniffing you?\rquote  asked Ron, as he, Harry and Hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates.
\par \lquote I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,\rquote  said Harry with a small laugh. \lquote I forgot to tell you ...\rquote 
\par And he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch bursting in seconds later, demanding to see the letter. To his slight surprise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more, indeed, than he did himself.
\par \lquote He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But who tipped him off?\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno,\rquote  said Harry, shrugging. \lquote Maybe Malfoy, he\rquote d think it was a laugh.\rquote 
\par They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left on to the road into the village, the wind whip\-ping their hair into their eyes.
\par \lquote Malfoy?\rquote  said Hermione, sceptically. \lquote Well ... yes ... maybe ...\rquote 
\par And she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of Hogsmeade.
\par \lquote Where are we going, anyway?\rquote  Harry asked. \lquote The Three Broomsticks?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh \endash  no,\rquote  said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, \lquote no, it\rquote s always packed and really noisy. I\rquote ve told the others to meet us in the Hog\rquote s Head, that other pub, you know the one, it\rquote 
s not on the main road. I think it\rquote s a bit ... you know ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 dodgy ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
but students don\rquote t normally go in there, so I don\rquote t think well be overheard.\rquote 
\par They walked down the main street past Zonko\rquote 
s Wizarding Joke Shop, where they were not surprised to see Fred, George and Lee Jordan, past the post office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up a side-street at the top of which stood a small inn. A battered wooden sign hung from
 a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture on it of a wild boar\rquote s severed head, leaking blood on to the white cloth around it. The sign creaked in the wind as they approached. All three of them hesitated outside the door.
\par \lquote Well, come on,\rquote  said Hermione, slightly nervously. Harry led the way inside.
\par It was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness. The Hog\rquote s Head bar comprised one small, dingy and very dirty room that smelled strongly of s
omething that might have been goats. The bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room, which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables. The floor seemed at first glance to be com
pressed earth, though as Harry stepped on to it he realised that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries.
\par Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year: \lquote Yeh get a lot o\rquote  funny folk in the Hog\rquote s Head,\rquote  he had said, explaining how he had won a dragon\rquote 
s egg from a hooded stranger there. At the time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog\rquote 
s Head. There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty grey bandages, though he was still man\-aging to gulp endless glasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his mouth; two figures shr
ouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows; Harry might have thought them Dementors if they had not been talking in strong Yorkshire accents, and in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes.
 They could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know about this, Hermione,\rquote  Harry muttered, as they crossed to the bar. He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch. \lquote Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that?\rquote 
\par Hermione cast an appraising eye over the veiled figure.
\par \lquote Umbridge is shorter than that woman,\rquote  she said quietly. \lquote And anyway, even if Umbridge does come in here there\rquote s nothing she can do to stop us, Harry, because I\rquote ve double- and triple-checked the school rules. We\rquote 
re not out of bounds; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog\rquote s Head, and he said yes, but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses. And I\rquote ve looked up everything
 I can think of about study groups and homework groups and they\rquote re definitely allowed. I just don\rquote t think it\rquote s a good idea if we }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 parade }{

\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry drily, \lquote especially as it\rquote s not exactly a homework group you\rquote re planning, is it?\rquote 
\par The barman sidled towards them out of a back room. He was a grumpy-looking old man with a great deal of long grey hair and beard. He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  he grunted.
\par \lquote Three Butterbeers, please,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par The man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty, very dirty bottles, which he slammed on the bar.
\par \lquote Six Sickles,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll get them,\rquote  said Harry quickly, passing over the silver. The barman\rquote s eyes travelled over Harry, resting for a fraction of a second on his scar. Then he turned away and deposited Harry\rquote 
s money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it. Harry, Ron and Hermione retreated to the furthest table from the bar and sat down, looking around. Th
e man in the dirty grey bandages rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman.
\par \lquote You know what?\rquote  Ron murmured, looking over at the bar with enthusiasm. \lquote We could order anything we liked in here. I bet that bloke would sell us anything, he wouldn\rquote t care. I\rquote ve always wanted to try Firewhisky \endash

\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Ron, the smile fading from his face. \lquote Yeah ...\rquote 
\par \lquote So, who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?\rquote  Harry asked, wrenching open the rusty top of his Butterbeer and taking a swig.
\par \lquote Just a couple of people,\rquote  Hermione repeated, checking her watch and looking anxiously towards the door. \lquote I told them to be here about now and I\rquote m sure they all know where it is \endash  oh, look, this might be them now.
\rquote 
\par The door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sun\-light split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people.
\par First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry\rquote 
s stomach did a back-flip) Cho and one of her usually-giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by acci\-dent) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Joh

a
nd Terry Boot, Ginny, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognised vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and, bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of 
whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko\rquote s merchandise.
\par \lquote A couple of people?\rquote  said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote A couple of people?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed. Possibly, he had never seen his pub so full.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his com\-panions quickly, \lquote could we have ... twenty-five Butterbeers, please?\rquote

oins. He could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting some kind of speech, at which he rounded on Hermione.
\par \lquote What have you been telling people?\rquote  he said in a low voice. \lquote What are they expecting?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve told you, they just want to hear what you\rquote ve got to say,\rquote  said Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly, \lquote you don\rquote t have to do anything yet, I\rquote 
ll speak to them first.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hi, Harry,\rquote  said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite him.
\par Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was exceptionally dry. Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron\rquote s right. Her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile
, but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him that, given her way, she would not be here at all.
\par In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron and Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry.
\par \lquote Er,\rquote  said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. \lquote Well \endash  er \endash  hi.\rquote 
\par The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry.
\par \lquote Well ... erm ... well, you know why you\rquote re here. Erm ... well, Harry here had the idea \endash  I mean\rquote  (Harry had thrown her a sharp look) \lquote I had the idea \endash  that it might be good if people who wanted to study 
Defence Against the Dark Arts \endash  and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us \endash \rquote  (Hermione\rquote s voice became suddenly much stronger and more con\-fident) \lquote \endash 
 because nobody could call that Defence Against the Dark Arts \endash \rquote  (\lquote Hear, hear,\rquote  said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened) \lquote \endash 
 Well, I thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands.\rquote 
\par She paused, looked sideways at Harry, and went on, \lquote And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just in theory but doing the real spells \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You want to pass your Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL too, though, I bet?\rquote  said Michael Corner.
\par \lquote Of course I do,\rquote  said Hermione at once. \lquote But more than that, I want to be properly trained in defence because ... because ...\rquote  she took a great breath and finished, \lquote because Lord Voldemort is back.\rquote 
\par The reaction was immediate and predictable. Cho\rquote s friend shrieked and slopped Butterbeer down herself; Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch; Padm
a Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry.
\par \lquote Well ... that\rquote s the plan, anyway,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote If you want to join us, we need to decide how we\rquote re going to \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Where\rquote s the proof You-Know-Who\rquote s back?\rquote  said the blond Hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice.
\par \lquote Well, Dumbledore believes it \endash \rquote  Hermione began.
\par \lquote You mean, Dumbledore believes }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 him,\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
 said the blond boy, nodding at Harry.
\par \lquote Who are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 you?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said Ron, rather rudely.
\par \lquote Zacharias Smith,\rquote  said the boy, \lquote and I think we\rquote ve got the right to know exactly what makes him say You-Know-Who\rquote s back.\rquote 
\par \lquote Look,\rquote  said Hermione, intervening swiftly, \lquote that\rquote s really not what this meeting was supposed to be about \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s OK, Hermione,\rquote  said Harry.
\par It had just dawned on him why there were so many people there. He thought Hermione should have seen this coming. Some of these people \endash  maybe even most of them \endash  had turned up in the hopes of hearing Harry\rquote s story firsthand.
\par \lquote What makes me say You-Know-Who\rquote s back?\rquote  he asked, looking Zacharias straight in the face. \lquote I saw him. But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year, and if you didn\rquote t believe him, you won\rquote 
t believe me, and I\rquote m not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone.\rquote 
\par The whole group seemed to have held its breath while Harry spoke. Harry had the impression that even the barman was lis\-tening. He was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag, making it steadily dirtier.
\par Zacharias said dismissively, \lquote All Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You-Know-Who and that you brought Diggory\rquote s body back to Hogwarts. He didn\rquote t give us details, he didn\rquote 
t tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we\rquote d all like to know \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote If you\rquote ve come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort murders someone I can\rquote t help you,\rquote 
 Harry said. His temper, always so close to the surface these days, was rising again. He did not take his eyes from Zacharias Smith\rquote s aggressive face, and was deter\-mined not to look at Cho. \lquote I don\rquote 
t want to talk about Cedric Diggory, all right? So if that\rquote s what you\rquote re here for, you might as well clear out.\rquote 
\par He cast an angry look in Hermione\rquote s direction. This was, he felt, all her fault; she had decided to displ
ay him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just how wild his story was. But none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though he continued to gaze intently at Harry.
\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again. \lquote So ... like I was saying ... if you want to learn some defence, then we need to work out how we\rquote re going to do it, how often we\rquote re going to meet and where we
\rquote re going to \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Is it true,\rquote  interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back, looking at Harry, \lquote that you can produce a Patronus?\rquote 
\par There was a murmur of interest around the group at this.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry slightly defensively.
\par \lquote A corporeal Patronus?\rquote 
\par The phrase stirred something in Harry\rquote s memory.
\par \lquote Er \endash  you don\rquote t know Madam Bones, do you?\rquote  he asked.
\par The girl smiled.
\par \lquote She\rquote s my auntie,\rquote  she said. \lquote I\rquote m Susan Bones. She told me about your hearing. So \endash  is it really true? You make a stag Patronus?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Blimey, Harry!\rquote  said Lee, looking deeply impressed. \lquote I never knew that!\rquote 
\par \lquote Mum told Ron not to spread it around,\rquote  said Fred, grinning at Harry. \lquote She said you got enough attention as it was.\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s not wrong,\rquote  mumbled Harry, and a couple of people laughed.
\par The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat.
\par \lquote And did you kill a Basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore\rquote s office?\rquote  demanded Terry Boot. \lquote That\rquote s what one of the portraits on the wall told me when I was in there last year ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  yeah, I did, yeah,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Justin Finch-Fletchley whistled; the Creevey brothers exchanged awestruck looks and Lavender Brown said \lquote Wow!\rquote  softly. Harry was feeling slightly hot around the collar now; he was determinedly looking anywhere but at Cho.
\par \lquote And in our first year,\rquote  said Neville to the group at large, \lquote he saved that Philological Stone \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Philosopher\rquote s,\rquote  hissed Hermione.
\par \lquote Yes, that \endash  from You-Know-Who,\rquote  finished Neville.
\par Hannah Abbott\rquote s eyes were as round as Galleons.
\par \lquote And that\rquote s not to mention,\rquote  said Cho (Harry\rquote s eyes snapped across to her; she was looking at him, smiling; his stomach did another somersault) \lquote all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year 
\endash  getting past dragons and merpeople and Acromantula and things ...\rquote 
\par There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table. Harry\rquote s 
insides were squirming. He was trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself. The fact that Cho had just praised him made it much, much harder for him to say the thing he had sworn to himself he would tell them.
\par \lquote Look,\rquote  he said, and everyone fell silent at once, \lquote I ... I don\rquote t want to sound like I\rquote m trying to be modest or anything, but ... I had a lot of help with all that stuff ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Not with the dragon, you didn\rquote t,\rquote  said Michael Corner at once. \lquote That was a seriously cool bit of flying ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, well \endash \rquote  said Harry, feeling it would be churlish to dis\-agree.
\par \lquote And nobody helped you get rid of those Dementors this summer,\rquote  said Susan Bones.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote no, OK, I know I did bits of it without help, but the point I\rquote m trying to make is \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff?\rquote  said Zacharias Smith.
\par \lquote Here\rquote s an idea,\rquote  said Ron loudly, before Harry could speak, \lquote why don\rquote t you shut your mouth?\rquote 
\par Perhaps the word \lquote weasel\rquote  had affected Ron particularly strongly. In any case, he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump him. Zacharias flushed.
\par \lquote Well, we\rquote ve all turned up to learn from him and now he\rquote s telling us he can\rquote t really do any of it,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote That\rquote s not what he said,\rquote  snarled Fred.
\par \lquote Would you like us to clean out your ears for you?\rquote  enquired George, pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of the Zonko\rquote s bags.
\par \lquote Or any part of your body, really, we\rquote re not fussy where we stick this,\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote Yes, well,\rquote  said Hermione hastily, \lquote moving on ... the point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry?\rquote 
\par There was a murmur of general agreement. Zacharias folded his arms and said nothing, though perhaps this was because he was too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in Fred\rquote s hand.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Hermione, looking relieved that something had at last been settled. \lquote Well, then, the next question is how often we do it. I really don\rquote t think there\rquote s any point in meeting less than once a week \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote Hang on,\rquote  said Angelina, \lquote we need to make sure this doesn\rquote t clash with our Quidditch practice.\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Cho, \lquote nor with ours.\rquote 
\par \lquote Nor ours,\rquote  added Zacharias Smith.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sure we can find a night that suits everyone,\rquote  said Hermione, slightly impatiently, \lquote but you know, this is rather important, we\rquote re talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort\rquote 
s Death Eaters \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Well said!\rquote  barked Ernie Macmillan, who Harry had been expecting to speak long before this. \lquote Personally, I think this is really important, possibly more important than anything else we\rquote 
ll do this year, even with our OWLs coming up!\rquote 
\par He looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry \lquote Surely not!\rquote  When nobody spoke, he went on, \lquote I, personally, am at a loss t
o see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher on us at this critical period. Obviously, they are in denial about the return of You-Know-Who, but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote We think the reason Umbridge doesn\rquote t want us trained in Defence Against the Dark Arts,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote is that she\rquote 
s got some ... some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army. She thinks he\rquote d mobilise us against the Ministry.\rquote 
\par Nearly everybody looked stunned at this news; everybody except Luna Lovegood, who piped up, \lquote Well, that makes sense. After all, Cornelius Fudge has got his own private army.\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry, completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information.
\par \lquote Yes, he\rquote s got an army of Heliopaths,\rquote  said Luna solemnly.
\par \lquote No, he hasn\rquote t,\rquote  snapped Hermione.
\par \lquote Yes, he has,\rquote  said Luna.
\par \lquote What are Heliopaths?\rquote  asked Neville, looking blank.
\par \lquote They\rquote re spirits of fire,\rquote  said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever, \lquote great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote They don\rquote t exist, Neville,\rquote  said Hermione tartly.
\par \lquote Oh, yes, they do!\rquote  said Luna angrily.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry, but where\rquote s the proof of that?\rquote  snapped Hermione.
\par \lquote There are plenty of eye-witness accounts. Just because you\rquote re so narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you \endash \rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Hem, hem,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said Ginny, in such a good imi
tation of Professor Umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed. \lquote Weren\rquote t we trying to decide how often we\rquote re going to meet and have defence lessons?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Hermione at once, \lquote yes, we were, you\rquote re right, Ginny.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, once a week sounds cool,\rquote  said Lee Jordan.
\par \lquote As long as \endash \rquote  began Angelina.
\par \lquote Yes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,\rquote  said Hermione in a tense voice. \lquote Well, the other thing to decide is where we\rquote re going to meet ...\rquote 
\par This was rather more difficult; the whole group fell silent.
\par \lquote Library?\rquote  suggested Katie Bell after a few moments.
\par \lquote I can\rquote t see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Maybe an unused classroom?\rquote  said Dean.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote McGonagall might let us have hers, she did when Harry was practising for the Triwizard.\rquote 
\par But Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would not be so accommodating this time. For all that Hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling that this one might be considered a lot more rebellious.
\par \lquote Right, well, we\rquote ll try to find somewhere,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote We\rquote ll send a message round to everybody when we\rquote ve got a time and a place for the first meeting.\rquote 
\par She rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill, then hesitated, rather as though she was steeling herself to say something.
\par \lquote I \endash  I think everybody should write their name down, just so we know who was here. But I also think,\rquote  she took a deep breath, \lquote that we all ought to agree not to shout about what we\rquote re doing. So if you sign, you\rquote 
re agreeing not to tell Umbridge or anybody else what we\rquote re up to.\rquote 
\par Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully wrote his signature, but Harry noticed at once that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list.
\par \lquote Er ...\rquote  said Zacharias slowly, not taking the parchment that George was trying to pass to him, \lquote well ... I\rquote m sure Ernie will tell me when the meeting is.\rquote 
\par But Ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing, too. Hermione raised her eyebrows at him.
\par \lquote I \endash  well, we are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 prefects,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Ernie burst out. \lquote 
And if this list was found ... well, I mean to say ... you said yourself, if Umbridge finds out \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You just said this group was the most important thing you\rquote d do this year,\rquote  Harry reminded him.
\par \lquote I \endash  yes,\rquote  said Ernie, \lquote yes, I do believe that, it\rquote s just \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ernie, do you really think I\rquote d leave that list lying around?\rquote  said Hermione testily.
\par \lquote No. No, of course not,\rquote  said Ernie, looking slightly less anx\-ious. \lquote I \endash  yes, of course I\rquote ll sign.\rquote 
\par Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though Harry saw Cho\rquote s friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her own name. When the last person \endash  Zacharias \endash 
 had signed, Hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag. There was an odd feeling in the group now. It was as though they had just signed some kind of contract.
\par \lquote Well, time\rquote s ticking on,\rquote  said Fred briskly, getting to his feet. \lquote George, Lee and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase, we\rquote ll be seeing you all later.\rquote 
\par In twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave, too. Cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving, her long dark curtain of hair swinging forwards to hide her face, but her friend stood
 beside her, arms folded, clicking her tongue, so that Cho had little choice but to leave with her. As her friend ushered her through the door, Cho looked back and waved at Harry.
\par \lquote Well, I think that went quite well,\rquote  said Hermione happily, as she, Harry and Ron walked out of the Hog\rquote s Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later. Harry and Ron were clutching their bottles of Butterbeer.
\par \lquote That Zacharias bloke\rquote s a wart,\rquote  said Ron, who was glowering after the figure of Smith, just discernible in the distance.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t like him much, either,\rquote  admitted Hermione, \lquote but he over\-
heard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming, so what could I say? But the more people the better really \endash  I mean, Michael Corner and his friends wouldn\rquote t have come if he hadn\rquote 
t been going out with Ginny \endash \rquote 
\par Ron, who had been draining the last few drops from his Butterbeer bottle, gagged and sprayed Butterbeer down his front.
\par \lquote He\rquote s WHAT?\rquote  spluttered Ron, outraged, his ears now resembling curls of raw beef. \lquote She\rquote s going out with \endash  my sister\rquote s going \endash  what d\rquote you mean, Michael Corner?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, that\rquote s why he and his friends came, I think \endash  well, they\rquote re obviously interested in learning defence, but if Ginny hadn\rquote t told Michael what was going on \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote When did this \endash  when did she \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote They met at the Yule Ball and got together at the end of last year,\rquote  said Hermione composedly. They had turned into the High Street and she paused outside Scrivenshaft\rquote s Quill Shop, where there was a handsome d
isplay of pheasant feather quills in the window. \lquote Hmm ... I could do with a new quill.\rquote 
\par She turned into the shop. Harry and Ron followed her.
\par \lquote Which one was Michael Corner?\rquote  Ron demanded furiously.
\par \lquote The dark one,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t like him,\rquote  said Ron at once.
\par \lquote Big surprise,\rquote  said Hermione under her breath.
\par \lquote But,\rquote  said Ron, following Hermione along a row of quills in copper pots, \lquote I thought Ginny fancied Harry!\rquote 
\par Hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head.
\par \lquote Ginny }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 used }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 to fancy Harry, b
ut she gave up on him months ago. Not that she doesn\rquote t }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 like }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 you, of course,
\rquote  she added kindly to Harry while she examined a long black and gold quill.
\par Harry, whose head was still full of Cho\rquote s parting wave, did not find this subject quite as interesting as Ron, who was positively quivering with indignation, but it did bring something home to him that until now he had not really registered.
\par \lquote So that\rquote s why she talks now?\rquote  he asked Hermione. \lquote She never used to talk in front of me.\rquote 
\par \lquote Exactly,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Yes, I think I\rquote ll have this one ...\rquote 
\par She went up to the counter and handed over fifteen Sickles and two Knuts, with Ron still breathing down her neck.
\par \lquote Ron,\rquote  she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet, \lquote this is exactly why Ginny hasn\rquote t told you she\rquote s seeing Michael, she knew you\rquote d take it badly. So don\rquote t }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 harp on }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 about it, for heaven\rquote s sake.\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean? Who\rquote s taking anything badly? I\rquote m not going to harp on about anything ...\rquote  Ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street.
\par Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry and then said in an under\-tone, while Ron was still muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, \lquote And talking about Michael and Ginny ... what about Cho and you?\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean?\rquote  said Harry quickly.
\par It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him; a burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold \endash  had he been that obvious?
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Hermione, smiling slightly, \lquote she just couldn\rquote t keep her eyes off you, could she?\rquote 
\par Harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of Hogsmeade was.

Harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done all term. He and Ron spent much of Sunday c
atching up with all their homework again, and although this could hardly be called fun, the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the common room they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a l
a
rge beech tree on the edge of the lake. Hermione, who of course was up to date with all her work, brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting needles so that they flashed and clicked in midair beside her, producing more hats and scarves.

 knowing all those people did not think him a lying weirdo, but someone to be admired, buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on Monday morning, despite the imminent prospect of all his least favourite classes.
\par He and Ron headed downstairs from their dormitory, discussing Angelina\rquote s idea that they were to work on a new move called the Sloth Grip Roll during that night\rquote 
s Quidditch practice, and not until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they notice the addition to the room that had already attracted the atten\-tion of a small group of people.
\par A large sign had been affixed to the Gryffindor noticeboard, so large it covered everything else on it \endash  the lists of second\-
hand spellbooks for sale, the regular reminders of school rules from Argus Filch, the Quidditch team training timetable, the offers to barter certain Chocolate Frog Cards for others, the Weasleys\rquote 
 latest advertisement for testers, the dates of the Hogsmeade weekends and the lost and found notices. The new sign was printed in large black letters and there was a highly official-looking seal at the bottom beside a neat and curly signature.

\par Harry was reading the notice through again. The happiness that had filled him since Saturday was gone. His insides were pulsing with rage.
\par \lquote This isn\rquote t a coincidence,\rquote  he said, his hands forming fists. \lquote She knows.\rquote 
\par \lquote She can\rquote t,\rquote  said Ron at once.
\par \lquote There were people listening in that pub. And let\rquote s face it, we don\rquote t know how many of the people who turned up we can trust ... any of them could have run off and told Umbridge ...\rquote 
\par And he had thought they believed him, thought they even admired him ...
\par \lquote Zacharias Smith!\rquote  said Ron at once, punching a fist into his hand. \lquote Or \endash  I thought that Michael Corner had a really shifty look, too \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I wonder if Hermione\rquote s seen this yet?\rquote  Harry said, looking round at the door to the girls\rquote  dormitories.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s go and tell her,\rquote  said Ron. He bounded forwards, pulled open the door and set off up the spiral staircase.
\par He wa
s on the sixth stair when there was a loud, wailing, klaxon-like sound and the steps melted together to make a long, smooth stone slide like a helter-skelter. There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep running, arms working madly like windmills, then
 he toppled over backwards and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on his back at Harry\rquote s feet.
\par \lquote Er \endash  I don\rquote t think we\rquote re allowed in the girls\rquote  dormitories,\rquote  said Harry, pulling Ron to his feet and trying not to laugh.
\par Two fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide.
\par \lquote Oooh, who tried to get upstairs?\rquote  they giggled happily, leaping to their feet and ogling Harry and Ron.
\par \lquote Me,\rquote  said Ron, who was still rather dishevelled. \lquote I didn\rquote t realise that would happen. It\rquote s not fair!\rquote  he added to Harry, as the girls headed off for the portrait hole, still giggling madly. \lquote Hermione
\rquote s allowed in our dormitory, how come we\rquote re not allowed \endash ?\rquote

 that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls. Anyway, why were you trying to get in there?\rquote 
\par \lquote To see you \endash  look at this!\rquote  said Ron, dragging her over to the noticeboard.
\par Hermione\rquote s eyes slid rapidly down the notice. Her expression became stony.
\par \lquote Someone must have blabbed to her!\rquote  Ron said angrily.
\par \lquote They can\rquote t have done,\rquote  said Hermione in a low voice.
\par \lquote You\rquote re so naive,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote you think just because you\rquote re all honourable and trustworthy \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, they can\rquote t have done, because I put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed,\rquote  said Hermione grimly. \lquote Believe me, if anyone\rquote s run off and told Umbridge, we\rquote ll know exactly wh

\par \lquote What\rquote ll happen to them?\rquote  said Ron eagerly.
\par \lquote Well, put it this way,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote it\rquote ll make Eloise Midgeon\rquote s acne look like a couple of cute freckles. Come on, let\rquote s get down to breakfast and see what the oth

\par It was immediately apparent on entering the Great Hall that Umbridge\rquote s sign had not only appeared in Gryffindor Tower. There was a peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra mea
sure of movement in the Hall as people scurried up and down their tables conferring on what they had read. Harry, Ron and Hermione had barely taken their seats when Neville, Dean, Fred, George and Ginny descended upon them.
\par \lquote Did you see it?\rquote 
\par \lquote D\rquote you reckon she knows?\rquote 
\par \lquote What are we going to do?\rquote 
\par They were all looking at Harry. He glanced around to make sure there were no teachers near them.
\par \lquote We\rquote re going to do it anyway, of course,\rquote  he said quietly.
\par \lquote Knew you\rquote d say that,\rquote  said George, beaming and thumping Harry on the arm.
\par \lquote The prefects as well?\rquote  said Fred, looking quizzically at Ron and Hermione.
\par \lquote Of course,\rquote  said Hermione coolly.
\par \lquote Here come Ernie and Hannah Abbott,\rquote  said Ron, looking over his shoulder. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote And }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Never mind spots, the idiots can\rquote t come over here now, it\rquote ll look really suspicious \endash  sit down!\rquote  she mouthed to Ernie and Hannah, gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the Hufflepuff table. \lquote Later! We\rquote

\par She hurried off towards the Ravenclaw table; Harry watched her go. Cho was sitting not far away, talking to the curly-haired friend she had brought along to the Hog\rquote s Head. Would Umbridge\rquote s notice scare her off meeting them again?
\par But the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were leaving the Great Hall for History of Magic.
\par \lquote Harry! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Ron!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par \lquote You realise she\rquote s including Quidditch in this?\rquote  Angelina said over him. \lquote We have to go and ask permission to re-form the Gryffindor team!\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote What?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said Harry.
\par \lquote No way,\rquote  said Ron, appalled.
\par \lquote You read the sign, it mentions teams too! So listen, Harry ... I am saying this for the last time ... please, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 please }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote OK, OK,\rquote  said Harry, for Angelina looked as though she was on the verge of tears. \lquote Don\rquote t worry, I\rquote ll behave myself ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Bet Umbridge is in History of Magic,\rquote  said Ron grimly, as they set off for Binns\rquote s lesson. \lquote She hasn\rquote t inspected Binns yet ... bet you anything she\rquote s there ...\rquote 
\par But he was wrong; the only teacher present when they entered was Professor Binns, floating an inch or so above his chair as usual and preparing to con
tinue his monotonous drone on giant wars. Harry did not even attempt to follow what he was saying today; he doodled idly on his parchment ignoring Hermione\rquote 
s frequent glares and nudges, until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote What?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par She pointed at the window. Harry looked round. Hedwig was perched on the narrow window ledge, gazing through the thick glass at him, a letter tied to her leg. Harry could not understand it; they had just had breakfast, why on earth hadn\rquote t she del
ivered the letter then, as usual? Many of his classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other, too.
\par \lquote Oh, I\rquote ve always loved that owl, she\rquote s so beautiful,\rquote  Harry heard Lavender sigh to Parvati.
\par He glanced round at Professor Binns who continued to read his notes, serenely unaware that the class\rquote 
s attention was even less focused upon him than usual. Harry slipped quietly off his chair, crouched down and hurried along the row to the window, where he slid the catch and opened it very slowly.
\par He had expected Hed
wig to hold out her leg so that he could remove the letter and then fly off to the Owlery, but the moment the window was open wide enough she hopped inside, hooting dolefully. He closed the window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns, crouched low ag
ain and sped back to his seat with Hedwig on his shoulder. He regained his seat, transferred Hedwig to his lap and made to remove the letter tied to her leg.
\par Only then did he realise that Hedwig\rquote s feathers were oddly ruf\-fled; some were bent the wrong way, and she was holding one of her wings at an odd angle.
\par \lquote She\rquote s hurt!\rquote  Harry whispered, bending his head low over her. Hermione and Ron leaned in closer; Hermione even put down her quill. \lquote Look \endash  there\rquote s something wrong with her wing \endash \rquote 
\par Hedwig was quivering; when Harry made to touch the wing she gave a little jump, all her feathers on end as though she was inflating herself, and gazed at him reproachfully.
\par \lquote Professor Binns,\rquote  said Harry loudly, and everyone in the class turned to look at him. \lquote I\rquote m not feeling well.\rquote 
\par Professor Binns raised his eyes from his notes, looking amazed, as always, to find the room in front of him full of people.
\par \lquote Not feeling well?\rquote  he repeated hazily.
\par \lquote Not at all well,\rquote  said Harry firmly, getting to his feet with Hedwig concealed behind his back. \lquote I think I need to go to the hospital wing.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Professor Binns, clearly very much wrong-footed. \lquote Yes ... yes, hospital wing ... well, off you go, then, Perkins ...\rquote 
\par Once outside the room, Harry returned Hedwig to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor, pausing to think only when he was out of sight of Binns\rquote 
s door. His first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would have been Hagrid, of course, but as he had no idea where Hagrid was his only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly-Plank and hope she would help.
\par He peered out of a window at the blustery, overcast grounds. There was no sign of her anywhere near Hagrid\rquote s cabin; if she was not teaching, she was probably in the staff room. He set off down\-stairs, Hedwig hooting fee
bly as she swayed on his shoulder.
\par Two stone gargoyles flanked the staff-room door. As Harry approached, one of them croaked, \lquote You should be in class, Sonny Jim.\rquote 
\par \lquote This is urgent,\rquote  said Harry curtly.
\par \lquote Ooooh, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 urgent, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 is it?\rquote  said the other gargoyle in a hig
h-pitched voice. \lquote Well, that\rquote s put }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 us }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 in our place, hasn\rquote 
t it?\rquote 
\par Harry knocked. He heard footsteps, then the door opened and he found himself face to face with Professor McGonagall.
\par \lquote You haven\rquote t been given another detention!\rquote  she said at once, her square spectacles flashing alarmingly.
\par \lquote No, Professor!\rquote  said Harry hastily.
\par \lquote Well then, why are you out of class?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 urgent, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 apparently,\rquote  said the second gargoyle snidely.

\par \lquote I\rquote m looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank,\rquote  Harry explained. \lquote It\rquote s my owl, she\rquote s injured.\rquote 
\par \lquote Injured owl, did you say?\rquote 
\par Professor Grubbly-Plank appeared at Professor McGonagall\rquote s shoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry, lifting Hedwig carefully off his shoulder, \lquote she turned up after the other post owls and her wing\rquote s all funny, look \endash \rquote 
\par Professor Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took Hedwig from Harry while Professor McGonagall watched.
\par \lquote Hmm,\rquote  said Professor Grubbly-Plank, her pipe waggling slightly as she talked. \lquote Looks like something\rquote s attacked her. Can\rquote 
t think what would have done it, though. Thestrals will sometimes go for birds, of course, but Hagrid\rquote s got the Hogwarts Thestrals well-trained not to touch owls.\rquote 
\par Harry neither knew nor cared what Thestrals were; he just wanted to know that Hedwig was going to be all right. Professor McGonagall, however, looked sharply at Harry and said, \lquote Do you know how far this owl\rquote s travelled, Potter?\rquote 

\par \lquote Er,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote From London, I think.\rquote 
\par He met her eyes briefly and knew, by the way her eyebrows had joined in the middle, that she understood \lquote London\rquote  to mean \lquote number twelve, Grimmauld Place\rquote .
\par Professor Grubbly-Plank pulled a monocle out of the inside of her robes and screwed it into her eye to examine Hedwig\rquote s wing closely. \lquote I should be able to sort this out if you leave her with me, Potter,\rquote  she said, \lquote she shouldn
\rquote t be flying long distances for a few days, in any case.\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  right \endash  thanks,\rquote  said Harry, just as the bell rang for break.
\par \lquote No problem,\rquote  said Professor Grubbly-Plank gruffly, turning back into the staff room.
\par \lquote Just a moment, Wilhelmina!\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote Potter\rquote s letter!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yeah!\rquote  said Harry, who had momentarily forgotten the scroll tied to Hedwig\rquote s leg. Professor Grubbly-Plank handed it over and then disappeared into
 the staff room carrying Hedwig, who was staring at Harry as though unable to believe he would give her away like this. Feeling slightly guilty, he turned to go, but Professor McGonagall called him back.
\par \lquote Potter!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Professor?\rquote 
\par She glanced up and down the corridor; there were students coming from both directions.
\par \lquote Bear in mind,\rquote  she said quickly and quietly, her eyes on the scroll in his hand, \lquote that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts may be being watched, won\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash \rquote  said Harry, but 
the flood of students rolling along the corridor was almost upon him. Professor McGonagall gave him a curt nod and retreated into the staff room, leaving Harry to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd. He spotted Ron and Hermione already standing
 in a sheltered corner, their cloak col\-lars turned up against the wind. Harry slit open the scroll as he hurried towards them and found five words in Sirius\rquote s handwriting:
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Today, same time, same place.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote Is Hedwig OK?\rquote  asked Hermione anxiously, the moment he was within earshot.
\par \lquote Where did you take her?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote To Grubbly-Plank,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote And I met McGonagall ... listen ...\rquote 
\par And he told them what Professor McGonagall had said. To his surprise, neither of the others looked shocked. On the contrary, they exchanged significant looks.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry, looking from Ron to Hermione and back again.
\par \lquote Well, I was just saying to Ron ... what if someone had tried to intercept Hedwig? I mean, she\rquote s never been hurt on a flight before, has she?\rquote 
\par \lquote Who\rquote s the letter from, anyway?\rquote  asked Ron, taking the note from Harry.
\par \lquote Snuffles,\rquote  said Harry quietly.
\par \lquote \'93Same time, same place?\'94 Does he mean the fire in the common room?\rquote 
\par \lquote Obviously,\rquote  said Hermione, also reading the note. She looked uneasy. \lquote I just hope nobody else has read this ...\rquote 
\par \lquote But it was still sealed and everything,\rquote  said Harry, trying to con\-vince himself as much as her. \lquote And nobody would understand what it meant if they didn\rquote t know where we\rquote d spoken to him before, would they?\rquote 

\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Hermione anxiously, hitching her bag back over her shoulder as the bell rang again, \lquote it wouldn\rquote t be exactly difficult to re-seal the scroll by magic ... and if anyone\rquote 
s watching the Floo Network ... but I don\rquote t really see how we can warn him not to come without }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 being intercepted, too!\rquote 
\par They trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for Potions, all three of them lost in thought, but as they reached the bottom of the steps they were recalled to themselves by the voice of Draco Malfoy, who was standing just outside Snape\rquote 
s classroom door, waving around an official-looking piece of parchment and talking much louder than was necessary so that they could hear every word.
\par \lquote Yeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to continue playing straightaway, I went to ask her first thing this morning. Well, it was pretty much automatic, I mean, she knows my father really well, he\rquote 
s always popping in and out of the Ministry ... it\rquote ll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing, won\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t rise,\rquote  Hermione whispered imploringly to Harry and Ron, who were both watching Malfoy, faces set and fists clenched. \lquote It\rquote s what he wants.\rquote 
\par \lquote I mean,\rquote  said Malfoy, raising his voice a little more, his grey eyes glittering malevolently in Harry and Ron\rquote s direction, \lquote if it\rquote s a question of influence with the Ministry, I don\rquote t think they\rquote 
ve got much chance ... from what my father says, they\rquote ve been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years ... and as for Potter ... my father says it\rquote s a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St Mungo\rquote 
s ... apparently they\rquote ve got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic.\rquote 
\par Malfoy made a grotesque face, his mouth sagging open and his eyes rolling. Crabbe and Goyle gave their usual grunts of laughter; Pansy Parkinson shrieked with glee.
\par Something collided hard with Harry\rquote s shoulder, knocking him sideways. A split second later he realised that Neville had just charged past him, heading straight for Malfoy.
\par \lquote Neville, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 no!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Harry leapt forward and seized the back of Neville\rquote s robes; Neville struggled frantically, his fists flailing, trying desperately to get at Malfoy who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked.
\par \lquote Help me!\rquote  Harry flung at Ron, managing to get an arm around Neville\rquote 
s neck and dragging him backwards, away from the Slytherins. Crabbe and Goyle were flexing their arms as they stepped in front of Malfoy, ready for the fight. Ron seized Neville\rquote s arms, and together he and Harry succeeded in dr
agging Neville back into the Gryffindor line. Neville\rquote s face was scarlet; the pressure Harry was exerting on his throat rendered him quite incomprehensible, but odd words spluttered from his mouth.

\par The dungeon door opened. Snape appeared there. His black eyes swept up the Gryffindor line to the point where Harry and Ron were wrestling with Neville.
\par \lquote Fighting, Potter, Weasley, Longbottom?\rquote  Snape said in his cold, sneering voice. \lquote Ten points from Gryffindor. Release Longbottom, Potter, or it will be detention. Inside, all of you.\rquote 
\par Harry let go of Neville, who stood panting and glaring at him.
\par \lquote I had to stop you,\rquote  Harry gasped, picking up his bag. \lquote Crabbe and Goyle would\rquote ve torn you apart.\rquote 
\par Neville said nothing; he merely snatched up his own bag and stalked off into the dungeon.
\par \lquote What in the name of Merlin,\rquote  said Ron slowly, as they followed Neville, \lquote was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 about?\rquote 
\par Harry did not answer. He knew exactly why the subject of people who were in St Mungo\rquote s because of magical damage to their brains was highly distressing to Neville, but he had sworn to Dumbledore that he would not tell anyone Neville\rquote 
s secret. Even Neville did not know Harry knew.
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione took their usual seats at the back of the class, pulled out parchment, quills and their copies of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi. }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The class around them was whis\-pering about what Neville had just done, but when Snape closed the dungeon door with an echoing bang, everybody immediately fell silent.

\par \lquote You will notice,\rquote  said Snape, in his low, sneering voice, \lquote that we have a guest with us today.\rquote 
\par He gestured towards the dim corner of the dungeon and Harry saw Professor Umbridge sitting there, clipboard on her knee. He glanced sideways at Ron a
nd Hermione, his eyebrows raised. Snape and Umbridge, the two teachers he hated most. It was hard to decide which one he wanted to triumph over the other.
\par \lquote We are continuing with our Strengthening Solution today. You will find your mixtures as you left them last lesson; if correctly made they should have matured well over the weekend \endash  instruc\-tions \endash \rquote  he waved his wand again 
\lquote \endash  on the board. Carry on.\rquote 
\par Professor Umbridge spent the first half hour of the lesson making notes in her corner. Harry was very interested in hearing her ques\-tion Snape; so interested, that he was becoming careless with his potion again.
\par \lquote Salamander blood, Harry!\rquote  Hermione moaned, grabbing his wrist to prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time, \lquote not pomegranate juice!\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry vaguely, putting down the bottle and con\-tinuing to watch the corner. Umbridge had just got to her feet. \lquote Ha,\rquote 
 he said softly, as she strode between two lines of desks towards Snape, who was bending over Dean Thomas\rquote s cauldron.
\par \lquote Well, the class seem fairly advanced for their level,\rquote  she said briskly to Snape\rquote s back. \lquote 
Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus.\rquote 
\par Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her.
\par \lquote Now ... how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?\rquote  she asked, her quill poised over her clipboard.
\par \lquote Fourteen years,\rquote  Snape replied. His expression was unfathom\-able. His eyes on Snape, Harry added a few drops to his potion; it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange.
\par \lquote You applied first for the Defence Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?\rquote  Professor Umbridge asked Snape.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Snape quietly.
\par \lquote But you were unsuccessful?\rquote 
\par Snape\rquote s lip curled.
\par \lquote Obviously.\rquote 
\par Professor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard.
\par \lquote And you have applied regularly for the Defence Against the Dark Arts post since you first joined the school, I believe?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips. He looked very angry.
\par \lquote Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you?\rquote  asked Umbridge.
\par \lquote I suggest you ask him,\rquote  said Snape jerkily.
\par \lquote Oh, I shall,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge, with a sweet smile.
\par \lquote I suppose this is relevant?\rquote  Snape asked, his black eyes nar\-rowed.
\par \lquote Oh yes,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge, \lquote yes, the Ministry wants a thorough understanding of teachers\rquote  \endash  er \endash  backgrounds.\rquote 
\par She turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began questioning her about the lessons. Snap
e looked round at Harry and their eyes met for a second. Harry hastily dropped his gaze to his potion, which was now congealing foully and giving off a strong smell of burned rubber.
\par \lquote No marks again, then, Potter,\rquote  said Snape maliciously, emptying Harry\rquote s cauldron with a wave of his wand. \lquote 
You will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion, indicating how and why you went wrong, to be handed in next lesson, do you understand?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry furiously. Snape had already given them home\-
work and he had Quidditch practice this evening; this would mean another couple of sleepless nights. It did not seem possible that he had awoken that morning feeling very happy. All he felt now was a fervent desire for this day to end.
\par \lquote Maybe I\rquote ll skive off Divination,\rquote  he said glumly, as they stood in the courtyard after lunch, the wind whipping at the hems of robes and brims of hats. \lquote I\rquote ll pretend to be ill and do Snape\rquote 
s essay instead, then I won\rquote t have to stay up half the night.\rquote 
\par \lquote You can\rquote t skive off Divination,\rquote  said Hermione severely.
\par \lquote Hark who\rquote s talking, you walked out of Divination, you hate Trelawney!\rquote  said Ron indignantly.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 hate }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 her,\rquote  said Hermione loftily. \lquote 
I just think she\rquote s an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud. But Harry\rquote s already missed History of Magic and I don\rquote t think he ought to miss any\-thing else today!\rquote 
\par There was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an hour later Harry took his seat in the hot, overperfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom, feeling angry at everybody. Professor Trelawney was yet again handing out copies of }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Dream Oracle. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Harry thought he\rquote d surely be much better employed doing Snape\rquote 
s punishment essay than sitting here trying to find meaning in a lot of made-up dreams.
\par It seemed, however, that he was not the only person in Divination who was in a temper. Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Oracle }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 down on the table between Harry and Ron and swept away, her lips pursed; she threw the next copy of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Oracle }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 at Seamus and Dean, narrowly avoiding Seamus\rquote s head, and thrust the final one into Neville\rquote 
s chest with such force that he slipped off his pouffe.
\par \lquote Well, carry on!\rquote  said Professor Trelawney loudly, her voice high-pitched and somewhat hysterical, \lquote you know what to do! Or am I such a sub-standard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book?\rquote 
\par The class stared perplexedly at her, then at each other. Harry, however, thought he knew what was the matter. As Professor Trelawney flounced back to the high-backed teacher\rquote 
s chair, her magnified eyes full of angry tears, he leaned his head closer to Ron\rquote s and muttered, \lquote I think she\rquote s got the results of her inspection back.\rquote 
\par \lquote Professor?\rquote  said Parvati Patil in a hushed voice (she and Lavender had always rather admired Professor Trelawney). \lquote Professor, is there anything \endash  er \endash  wrong?\rquote 
\par \lquote Wrong!\rquote  cried Professor Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion. \lquote Certainly not! I have been insulted, certainly ... insinu\-atio
ns have been made against me ... unfounded accusations levelled ... but no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not!\rquote 
\par She took a great shuddering breath and looked away from Parvati, angry tears spilling from under her glasses.
\par \lquote I say nothing,\rquote  she choked, \lquote of sixteen years of devoted service ... it has passed, apparently, unnoticed ... but I shall not be insulted, no, I shall not!\rquote 
\par \lquote But, Professor, who\rquote s insulting you?\rquote  asked Parvati timidly.
\par \lquote The Establishment!\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, in a deep, dra\-matic, wavering voice. \lquote 
Yes, those with eyes too clouded by the mundane to See as I See, to Know as I Know ... of course, we Seers have always been feared, always persecuted ... it is \endash  alas \endash  our fate.\rquote 
\par She gulped, dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of her shawl, then she pulled a small embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve, and blew her nose very hard with a sound like Peeves blowing a raspberry.
\par Ron sniggered. Lavender shot him a disgusted look.
\par \lquote Professor,\rquote  said Parvati, \lquote do you mean ... is it something Professor Umbridge \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Do not speak to me about that woman!\rquote  cried Professor Trelawney, leaping to her feet, her beads rattling and her spectacles flashing. \lquote Kindly continue with your work!\rquote 
\par And she spent the rest of the lesson striding among them, tears still leaking from behind her glasses, muttering what sounded like threats under her breath.
\par \lquote ... may well choose to leave ... the indignity of it ... on pro\-bation ... we shall see ... how she dares ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You and Umbridge have got something in common,\rquote  Harry told Hermione quietly when they met again in Defence Against the Dark Arts. \lquote She obviously reckons Trelawney\rquote s an old fraud, too ... looks like she\rquote 
s put her on probation.\rquote 
\par Umbridge entered the room as he spoke, wearing her black velvet bow and an expression of great smugness.
\par \lquote Good afternoon, class.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,\rquote  they chanted drearily.
\par \lquote Wands away, please.\rquote 
\par But there was no answering flurry of movement this time; nobody had bothered to take out their wands.
\par \lquote Please turn to page thirty-four of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Defensive Magical Theory }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par \lquote I know, I know,\rquote  said Angelina miserably. \lquote She just said she needed a bit of time to consider.\rquote 
\par \lquote Consider what?\rquote  said Ron angrily. \lquote She\rquote s given the Slytherins per\-mission, why not us?\rquote 
\par But Harry could imagine how much Umbridge was enjoying holding the threat of no Gryffindor Quidditch team over their heads and could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that weapon over them too soon.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote look on the bright side \endash  at least now you\rquote ll have time to do Snape\rquote s essay!\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s a bright side, is it?\rquote  snapped Harry, while Ron stared incredulously at Hermione. \lquote No Quidditch practice, and extra Potions?\rquote 
\par Harry slumped down into a chair, dragged his Potions essay reluctantly from his bag and set to work. It was very hard to con\-
centrate; even though he knew Sirius was not due in the fire until much later, he could not help glancing into the flames every few minutes just in case. There was also an incredible amou
nt of noise in the room: Fred and George appeared finally to have perfected one type of Skiving Snackbox, which they were taking turns to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd.
\par First, Fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew, at which 
he would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in front of them. Then he would force down the purple end of the chew, at which the vomiting would immediately cease. Lee Jordan, who was assisting the demonstration, was lazily Vanish\-
ing the vomit at regular intervals with the same Vanishing Spell Snape kept using on Harry\rquote s potions.
\par What with the regular sounds of retching, cheering and the sound of Fred and George taking advance orders from the crowd, Harry was finding it exceptionally difficult
 to focus on the correct method for Strengthening Solution. Hermione was not helping matters; the cheers and the sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred and George\rquote s bucket were punctuated by her loud and dis\-
approving sniffs, which Harry found, if anything, more distracting.
\par \lquote Just go and stop them, then!\rquote  he said irritably, after crossing out the wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time.
\par \lquote I can\rquote t, they\rquote re not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 technically }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 doing anything wrong,
\rquote  said Hermione through gritted teeth. \lquote They\rquote re quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves and I can\rquote t find a rule that says the other idiots aren\rquote t entitled to buy them, not unless they\rquote 
re proven to be dangerous in some way and it doesn\rquote t look as though they are.\rquote 
\par She, Harry and Ron watched George projectile-vomit into the bucket, gulp down the rest of the chew and straighten up, beaming with his arms wide to protracted applause.
\par \lquote You know, I don\rquote t get why Fred and George only got three OWLs each,\rquote  said Harry, watching as Fred, George and Lee col\-lected gold from the eager crowd. \lquote They really know their stuff.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, they only know flashy stuff that\rquote s of no real use to anyone,\rquote  said Hermione disparagingly.
\par \lquote No real use?\rquote  said Ron in a strained voice. \lquote Hermione, they\rquote ve made about twenty-six Galleons already.\rquote 
\par It was a long while before the crowd around the Weasley twins dispersed, then Fred, Lee and George sat up counting their tak\-ings even longer, so it was well past midnight when Harry, Ron and Hermione finally had the common room to 
themselves. At long last, Fred had closed the doorway to the boys\rquote 
 dormitories behind him, rattling his box of Galleons ostentatiously so that Hermione scowled. Harry, who was making very little progress with his Potions essay, decided to give it up for th
e night. As he put his books away, Ron, who was dozing lightly in an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, and looked blearily into the fire.
\par \lquote Sirius!\rquote  he said.
\par Harry whipped round. Sirius\rquote s untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  he said, grinning.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  chorused Harry, Ron and Hermione, all three kneeling down on the hearthrug. Crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire, trying, despite the heat, to put his face close to Sirius\rquote s.
\par \lquote How\rquote re things?\rquote  said Sirius.
\par \lquote Not that good,\rquote  said Harry, as Hermione pulled Crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers. \lquote The Ministry\rquote s forced through another decree, which means we\rquote re not allowed to have Quidditch teams \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote Or secret Defence Against the Dark Arts groups?\rquote  said Sirius.
\par There was a short pause.
\par \lquote How did you know about that?\rquote  Harry demanded.
\par \lquote You want to choose your meeting places more carefully,\rquote  said Sirius, grinning still more broadly. \lquote The Hog\rquote s Head, I ask you.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, it was better than the Three Broomsticks!\rquote  said Hermione defensively. \lquote That\rquote s always packed with people \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Which means you\rquote d have been harder to overhear,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote You\rquote ve got a lot to learn, Hermione.\rquote 
\par \lquote Who overheard us?\rquote  Harry demanded.
\par \lquote Mundungus, of course,\rquote  said Sirius, and when they all looked puzzled he laughed. \lquote He was the witch under the veil.\rquote 
\par \lquote That was Mundungus?\rquote  Harry said, stunned. \lquote What was he doing in the Hog\rquote s Head?\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you think he was doing?\rquote  said Sirius impatiently. \lquote Keeping an eye on you, of course.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m still being followed?\rquote  asked Harry angrily.
\par \lquote Yeah, you are,\rquote  said Sirius, \lquote and just as well, isn\rquote t it, if the first thing you\rquote re going to do on your weekend off is organise an illegal defence group.\rquote 
\par But he looked neither angry nor worried. On the contrary, he was looking at Harry with distinct pride.
\par \lquote Why was Dung hiding from us?\rquote  asked Ron, sounding disap\-pointed. We\rquote d\rquote ve liked to\rquote ve seen him.\rquote 
\par \lquote He was banned from the Hog\rquote s Head twenty years ago,\rquote  said Sirius, \lquote and that barman\rquote s got a long memory. We lost Moody\rquote s spare Invisibility Cloak when Sturgis was arrested, so Dung\rquote 
s been dressing as a witch a lot lately ... anyway ... first of all, Ron \endash  I\rquote ve sworn to pass on a message from your mother.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yeah?\rquote  said Ron, sounding apprehensive.
\par \lquote She says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal secret Defence Against the Dark Arts group. She says you\rquote 
ll be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined. She says there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now. She also\rquote  (Sinus\rquote 
s eyes turned to the other two) \lquote advises Harry and Hermione not to proceed with the group, though she accepts that she has no authority over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has their bes
t interests at heart. She would have written all this to you, but if the owl had been intercepted you\rquote d all have been in real trouble, and she can\rquote t say it for herself because she\rquote s on duty tonight.\rquote 
\par \lquote On duty doing what?\rquote  said Ron quickly.
\par \lquote Never you mind, just stuff for the Order,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote So it\rquote s fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her I passed it all on, because I don\rquote t think she trusts me to.\rquote 
\par There was another pause in which Crookshanks, mewing, attempted to paw Sirius\rquote s head, and Ron fiddled with a hole in the hearthrug.
\par \lquote So, you want me to say I\rquote m not going to take part in the Defence group?\rquote  he muttered finally.
\par \lquote Me? Certainly not!\rquote  said Sirius, looking surprised. \lquote I think it\rquote s an excellent idea!\rquote 
\par \lquote You do?\rquote  said Harry, his heart lifting.
\par \lquote Of course I do!\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote D\rquote you think your father and I would\rquote ve lain down and taken orders from an old hag like Umbridge?\rquote 
\par \lquote But \endash  last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Last year, all the evidence was that someone inside Hogwarts was trying to kill you, Harry!\rquote  said Sirius impatiently. \lquote This year, we know there\rquote s someone outside Hogwarts who\rquote 
d like to kill us all, so I think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea!\rquote 
\par \lquote And if we do get expelled?\rquote  Hermione asked, a quizzical look on her face.
\par \lquote Hermione, this whole thing was your idea!\rquote  said Harry, staring at her.
\par \lquote I know it was. I just wondered what Sirius thought,\rquote  she said, shrugging.
\par \lquote Well, better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue,\rquote  said Sirius.
\par \lquote Hear, hear,\rquote  said Harry and Ron enthusiastically.
\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Sirius, \lquote how are you organising this group? Where are you meeting?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, that\rquote s a bit of a problem now,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Dunno where we\rquote re going to be able to go.\rquote 
\par \lquote How about the Shrieking Shack?\rquote  suggested Sirius.
\par \lquote Hey, that\rquote s an idea!\rquote  said Ron excitedly, but Hermione made a sceptical noise and all three of them looked at her, Sirius\rquote s head turning in the flames.
\par \lquote Well, Sirius, it\rquote s just that there were only four of you meeting in the Shrieking Shack when you were at school,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote 
and all of you could transform into animals and I suppose you could all have squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if you\rquote d wanted to. But there are twenty-eight of us and none of us is an Animagus, so we wouldn\rquote 
t need so much an Invisibility Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Fair point,\rquote  said Sirius, looking slightly crestfallen. \lquote Well, I\rquote m sure you\rquote ll come up with somewhere. There used to be 
a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor, you might have enough space to practise jinxes in there.\rquote 
\par \lquote Fred and George told me it\rquote s blocked,\rquote  said Harry, shaking his head. \lquote Caved in or something.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh ...\rquote  said Sirius, frowning. \lquote Well, I\rquote ll have a think and get back to \endash \rquote 
\par He broke off. His face was suddenly tense, alarmed. He turned sideways, apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fire\-place.
\par \lquote Sirius?\rquote  said Harry anxiously.
\par But he had vanished. Harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at Ron and Hermione.
\par \lquote Why did he \endash ?\rquote 
\par Hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet, still staring at the fire.
\par A hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as though to catch hold of something; a stubby, short-fingered hand covered in ugly old-fashioned rings.
\par The three of them ran for it. At the door of the boys\rquote  dormitory Harry looked back. Umbridge\rquote s hand was still making snatching move\-ments amongst the flames, as though she knew exactly where Sirius\rquote 
s hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it.

was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat; there was generally so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight. Today, with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy 
downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the class\-room windows, Harry, Ron and Hermione\rquote s whispered discussion about how Umbridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite un\-noticed.

\par She, too, was gazing at the window, but not as though she really saw it. Her eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on her face.

\par \lquote Yes, I do!\rquote  said Harry at once. \lquote He\rquote s always given us great advice!\rquote 
\par An ink pellet whizzed past them, striking Katie Bell squarely in the ear. Hermione watched Katie leap to her feet and start throwing things at Peeves; it was a few moments before Hermione spoke again and it sounded as though she was ch

\par They all stowed their wands back in the inside pockets of their robes, shouldered their brooms and followed Angelina out of the changing rooms.
\par They squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the pitch; visibility was still very poor even with the Impervius Charm; light was fading fast and curtains of rain were sweeping the grounds.
\par \lquote All right, on my whistle,\rquote  shouted Angelina.
\par Harry kicked off from the ground, spraying mud in all direc\-tions, and shot upwards, the wind pulling him slightly off course. He had no idea how he was going to see the Snitch in this weather; he was having enough difficulty se
eing the one Bludger with which they were practising; a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it. Unfortunately, Angelina did not see this. In fact, she did not appear to be able to see anything; no
ne of them had a clue what the others were doing. The wind was picking up; even at a distance Harry could hear the swishing, pounding sounds of the rain pummelling the surface of the lake.
\par Angelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before conceding defeat.
 She led her sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing rooms, insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time, though without any real conviction in her voice. Fred and George were looking particularly annoyed; both were bandy-legged and
 winced with every movement. Harry could hear them com\-plaining in low voices as he towelled his hair dry.
\par \lquote I think a few of mine have ruptured,\rquote  said Fred in a hollow voice.
\par \lquote Mine haven\rquote t,\rquote  said George, wincing, \lquote they\rquote re throbbing like mad ... feel bigger if anything.\rquote 
\par \lquote OUCH!\rquote  said Harry.
\par He pressed the towel to his face, his eyes screwed tight with pain. The scar on his forehead had seared again, more painfully than it had in weeks.
\par \lquote What\rquote s up?\rquote  said several voices.
\par Harry emerged from behind his towel; the changing room was blurred because he was not wearing his glasses, but he could still tell that everyone\rquote s face was turned towards him.
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  he muttered, \lquote I \endash  poked myself in the eye, that\rquote s all.\rquote 
\par But he gave Ron a significant look and the two of them hung back as the rest of the team filed back outside, muffled in their cloaks, their hats pulled low over their ears.
\par \lquote What happened?\rquote  said Ron, the moment Alicia had disappeared through the door. \lquote Was it your scar?\rquote 
\par Harry nodded.
\par \lquote But ...\rquote  looking scared, Ron strode across to the window and stared out into the rain, \lquote he \endash  he can\rquote t be near us now, can he?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  Harry muttered, sinking on to a bench and rubbing his forehead. \lquote He\rquote s probably miles away. It hurt because ... he\rquote s ... angry.\rquote 
\par Harry had not meant to say that at all, and heard the words as though a stranger had spoken them \endash 
 yet knew at once that they were true. He did not know how he knew it, but he did; Voldemort, wherever he was, whatever he was doing, was in a towering temper.
\par \lquote Did you see him?\rquote  said Ron, looking horrified. \lquote Did you ... get a vision, or something?\rquote 
\par Harry sat quite still, staring at his feet, allowing his mind and his memory to relax in the aftermath of the pain.
\par A confused tangle of shapes, a howling rush of voices ...
\par \lquote He wants something done, and it\rquote s not happening fast enough,\rquote  he said.
\par Again, he felt surprised to hear the words coming out of his mouth, and yet was quite certain they were true.
\par \lquote But ... how do you know?\rquote  said Ron.
\par Harry shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands, pressing down upon them with his palms. Little stars erupted in them. He felt Ron sit down on the bench beside him and knew Ron was staring at him.
\par \lquote Is this what it was about last time?\rquote  said Ron in a hushed voice. \lquote When your scar hurt in Umbridge\rquote s office? You-Know-Who was angry?\rquote 
\par Harry shook his head.
\par \lquote What is it, then?\rquote 
\par Harry was thinking himself back. He had been looking into Umbridge\rquote s face ... his scar had hurt ... and he had had that odd feeling in his stomach ... a strange, leaping feeling ... a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 happy }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
feeling ... but of course, he had not recognised it for what it was, as he had been feeling so miserable himself ...
\par \lquote Last time, it was because he was pleased,\rquote  he said. \lquote Really pleased. He thought ... something good was going to happen. And the night before we came back to Hogwarts ...\rquote 
 he thought back to the moment when his scar had hurt so badly in his and Ron\rquote s bedroom in Grimmauld Place ... \lquote he was furious ...\rquote 
\par He looked round at Ron, who was gaping at him.
\par \lquote You could take over from Trelawney, mate,\rquote  he said in an awed voice.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not making prophecies,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote No, you know what you\rquote re doing?\rquote  Ron said, sounding both scared and impressed. \lquote Harry, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 you\rquote re reading You-Know-Who\rquote s mind!

s in. Dumbledore said something like this was happening last year. He said that when Voldemort was near me, or when he was feeling hatred, I could tell. Well, now I\rquote m feeling it when he\rquote s pleased, too ...\rquote 
\par There was a pause. The wind and rain lashed at the building.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve got to tell someone,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote I told Sirius last time.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, tell him about this time!\rquote 
\par \lquote Can\rquote t, can I?\rquote  said Harry grimly. \lquote Umbridge is watching the owls and the fires, remember?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well then, Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve just told you, he already knows,\rquote  said Harry shortly, get\-ting to his feet, taking his cloak off his peg and swinging it around him. \lquote There\rquote s no point telling him again.\rquote

\par \lquote Dumbledore\rquote d want to know,\rquote  he said.
\par Harry shrugged.
\par \lquote C\rquote mon ... we\rquote ve still got Silencing Charms to practise.\rquote 
\par They hurried back through the dark grounds, sliding and stum\-bling up the muddy lawns, not talking. Harry was thinking hard. What was it that Voldemort wanted done that was not happening quickly enough?

\par It appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early, leaving Crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly knitted elf h

\par He stretched out his hand ... his fingertips were inches from it ...
\par \lquote Harry Potter, sir!\rquote 
\par He awoke with a start. The candles had all been extinguished in the common room, but there was something moving close by.
\par \lquote Whozair?\rquote  said Harry, sitting upright in his chair. The fire was almost out, the room very dark.
\par \lquote Dobby has your owl, sir!\rquote  said a squeaky voice.
\par \lquote Dobby?\rquote  said Harry thickly, peering through the gloom towards the source of the voice.
\par Dobby the house-elf was standing beside the table on which Herm
ione had left half a dozen of her knitted hats. His large, pointed ears were now sticking out from beneath what looked like all the hats Hermione had ever knitted; he was wearing one on top of the other, so that his head seemed elongated by two or three f
eet, and on the very topmost bobble sat Hedwig, hooting serenely and obviously cured.
\par \lquote Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potter\rquote s owl,\rquote  said the elf squeakily, with a look of positive adoration on his face, \lquote Professor Grubbly-Plank says she is all well now, sir.\rquote 
 He sank into a deep bow so that his pencil-like nose brushed the threadbare surface of the hearthrug and Hedwig gave an indignant hoot and fluttered on to the arm of Harry\rquote s chair.
\par \lquote Thanks, Dobby!\rquote  said Harry, stroking Hedwig\rquote s head and blinking har
d, trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream ... it had been very vivid. Looking back at Dobby, he noticed that the elf was also wearing several scarves and innumerable socks, so that his feet looked far too big for his body.
\par \lquote Er ... have you been taking }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 all }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 the clothes Hermione\rquote

\par \lquote Oh, no, sir,\rquote  said Dobby happily. \lquote Dobby has been taking some for Winky, too, sir.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, how is Winky?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par Dobby\rquote s ears drooped slightly.
\par \lquote Winky is still drinking lots, sir,\rquote  he said sadly, his enormous round green eyes, large as tennis balls, downcast. \lquote 
She still does not care for clothes, Harry Potter. Nor do the other house-elves. None of them will clean Gryffindor Tower any more, not with the hats and socks hidden everywhe
re, they finds them insulting, sir. Dobby does it all himself, sir, but Dobby does not mind, sir, for he always hopes to meet Harry Potter and tonight, sir, he has got his wish!\rquote  Dobby sank into a deep bow again. \lquote 
But Harry Potter does not seem happy,\rquote  Dobby went on, straightening up again and looking timidly at Harry. \lquote Dobby heard him muttering in his sleep. Was Harry Potter having bad dreams?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not really bad,\rquote  said Harry, yawning and rubbing his eyes. \lquote I\rquote ve had worse.\rquote 
\par The elf surveyed Harry out of his vast, orb-like eyes. Then he said very seriously, his ears drooping, \lquote Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter, for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much, much happier now.\rquote 
\par Harry smiled.
\par \lquote You can\rquote t help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer.\rquote 
\par He bent and picked up his Potions book. He\rquote d have to try to finish the essay tomorrow. He closed the book and as he did so the firelight illuminated the thin white scars on the back of his hand \endash 
 the result of his detentions with Umbridge ...
\par \lquote Wait a moment \endash  there }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 something you can do for me, Dobby,
\rquote  said Harry slowly.
\par The elf looked round, beaming.
\par \lquote Name it, Harry Potter, sir!\rquote 
\par \lquote I need to find a place where twenty-eight people can practise Defence Against the Dark Arts without being discovered by any of the teachers. Especially,\rquote  Harry clenched his hand on the book, so that the scars shone pearly white, \lquote 
Professor Umbridge.\rquote 
\par He expected the elf\rquote s smile to vanish, his ears to droop; he expected him to say it was impossible, or else that he would try to find some
where, but his hopes were not high. What he had not expected was for Dobby to give a little skip, his ears waggling cheerfully, and clap his hands together.
\par \lquote Dobby knows the perfect place, sir!\rquote  he said happily. \lquote Dobby heard tell of it from the other house-elves when he came to Hogwarts, sir. It is known by us as the Come and Go Room, sir, or else as the Room of Requirement!\rquote 

\par \lquote Why?\rquote  said Harry curiously.
\par \lquote Because it is a room that a person can only enter,\rquote  said Dobby seriously, \lquote when they have real need of it. Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker\rquote 
s needs. Dobby has used it, sir,\rquote  said the elf, drop\-ping his voice and looking guilty, \lquote when Winky has been very drunk; he has hidden her in the 
Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to Butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her on while she sleeps it off, sir ... and Dobby knows Mr Filch has found extra cleaning materials there when he has run short, sir, and \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote And if you really needed a bathroom,\rquote  said Harry, suddenly remembering something Dumbledore had said at the Yule Ball the previous Christmas, \lquote would it fill itself with chamber pots?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dobby expects so, sir,\rquote  said Dobby, nodding earnestly. \lquote It is a most amazing room, sir.\rquote 
\par \lquote How many people know about it?\rquote  said Harry, sitting up straighter in his chair.
\par \lquote Very few, sir. Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it, sir, but often they never finds it again, for they do not know that it is always there waiting to be called into service, sir.\rquote 
\par \lquote It sounds brilliant,\rquote  said Harry, his heart racing. \lquote It sounds per\-fect, Dobby. When can you show me where it is?\rquote 
\par \lquote Any time, Harry Potter, sir,\rquote  said Dobby, looking delighted at Harry\rquote s enthusiasm. \lquote We could go now, if you like!\rquote 
\par For a moment Harry was tempted to go with Dobby. He was halfway out of his seat, intending to hurry upstairs for his Invisibility Cloak when, not for the first time, a voice very much like Hermione\rquote s whispered in his ear: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 reckless. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 It was, after all, very late and he was exhausted.
\par \lquote Not tonight, Dobby,\rquote  said Harry reluctantly, sinking back into his chair. \lquote This is really important ... I don\rquote t want to blow it, it\rquote 
ll need proper planning. Listen, can you just tell me exactly where this Room of Requirement is, and how to get in there?\rquote

Their robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across the flooded vegetable patch to double Herbology, where they could hardly hear what Professor Sprout was saying over the ham\-mering of raindrops hard as h

\par She looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others. Harry returned hungrily to his sausages and mash. When he looked up to take a drink of pumpkin juice, he found Hermione watching him.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  he said thickly.
\par \lquote Well ... it\rquote s just that Dobby\rquote s plans aren\rquote t always that safe. Don\rquote t you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm?\rquote 
\par \lquote This room isn\rquote t just some mad idea of Dobby\rquote s; Dumbledore knows about it, too, he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball.\rquote

\par \lquote Dumbledore told you about it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Just in passing,\rquote  said Harry, shrugging.
\par \lquote Oh, well, that\rquote s all right then,\rquote  said Hermione briskly and raised no more objections.
\par Together with Ron they had spent most of the day seeking out those people who had signed their names to the list in the Hog\rquote s Head and telling them where to meet that evening. Somewhat to Harry\rquote s disappointment, it was Ginny who 
managed to find Cho Chang and her friend first; however, by the end of dinner he was confident that the news had been passed to every one of the twenty-five people who had turned up in the Hog\rquote s Head.
\par At half past seven Harry, Ron and Hermione left the Gryffindor common room, Harry clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in his hand. Fifth-years were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine o\rquote 
clock, but all three of them kept looking around nerv\-ously as they made their way along the seventh floor.
\par \lquote Hold it,\rquote  Harry warned, unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase, tapping it with his wand and mutter\-ing, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote

\par A map of Hogwarts appeared on the blank surface of the parch\-ment. Tiny black moving dots, labelled with names, showed where various people were.
\par \lquote Filch is on the second floor,\rquote  said Harry, holding the map close to his eyes, \lquote and Mrs Norris is on the fourth.\rquote 
\par \lquote And Umbridge?\rquote  said Hermione anxiously.
\par \lquote In her office,\rquote  said Harry, pointing. \lquote OK, let\rquote s go.\rquote 
\par They hurried along the corridor to the place Dobby had described to Harry, a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting Barnabas the Barmy\rquote s foolish attempt to train trolls for the ballet.
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Harry quietly, while a moth-eaten troll paused in his relentless clubbing of the would-be ballet teacher to watch them. \lquote Dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times, concentrating hard on what we need.\rquote 

\par They did so, turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank stretch of wall, then at the man-sized vase on its other side. Ron had screwed up his eyes in concentration; Hermione was whis\-pering something under her breath; Harry\rquote 
s fists were clenched as he stared ahead of him.

\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  said Hermione sharply, as they wheeled around after their third walk past.
\par A highly polished door had appeared in the wall. Ron was staring at it, looking sli
ghtly wary. Harry reached out, seized the brass handle, pulled open the door and led the way into a spacious room lit with flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors below.
\par The walls were lined with wooden bookcases and instea
d of chairs there were large silk cushions on the floor. A set of shelves at the far end of the room carried a range of instruments such as Sneakoscopes, Secrecy Sensors and a large, cracked Foe-Glass that Harry was sure had hung, the previous year, in th
e fake Moody\rquote s office.
\par \lquote These will be good when we\rquote re practising Stunning,\rquote  said Ron enthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his foot.
\par \lquote And just look at these books!\rquote  said Hermione excitedly, run\-ning a finger along the spines of the large leather-bound tomes. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote

 She looked around at Harry, her face glowing, and he saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced Hermione that what they were doing was right. \lquote Harry, this is wonderful, there\rquote s every\-thing we need here!\rquote 
\par And without further ado she slid }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Jinxes for the Jinxed }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
from its shelf, sank on to the nearest cushion and began to read.
\par There was a gentle knock on the door. Harry looked round. Ginny, Neville, Lavender, Parvati and Dean had arrived.
\par \lquote Whoa,\rquote  said Dean, staring around, impressed. \lquote What is this place?\rquote 
\par Harry began to explain, but before he had finished more people had arrived and he had to start all over again. By the time eight o\rquote 
clock arrived, every cushion was occupied. Harry moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at him. Hermione carefully marked her page of }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Jinxes for the Jinxed }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and set the book aside.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Harry, slightly nervously. \lquote This is the place we\rquote ve found for practice sessions, and you\rquote ve \endash  er \endash  obviously found it OK.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s fantastic!\rquote  said Cho, and several people murmured their agreement.
\par \lquote It\rquote s bizarre,\rquote  said Fred, frowning around at it. \lquote We once hid from Filch in here, remember, George? But it was just a broom cup\-board then.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hey, Harry, what\rquote s this stuff?\rquote  asked Dean from the rear of the room, indicating the Sneakoscopes and the Foe-Glass.
\par \lquote Dark detectors,\rquote  said Harry, stepping between the cushions to reach them. \lquote Basically they all show when Dark wizards or ene\-mies are around, but you don\rquote t want to rely on them too much, they can be fooled ...\rquote 
\par He gazed for a moment into the cracked Foe-Glass; shadowy figures were moving around inside it, though none was recognis\-able. He turned his back on it.
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote ve been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and \endash  er \endash \rquote  He noticed a raised hand. \lquote What, Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote I think we ought to elect a leader,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Harry\rquote s leader,\rquote  said Cho at once, looking at Hermione as though she were mad.
\par Harry\rquote s stomach did yet another back-flip.
\par \lquote Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly,\rquote  said Hermione, unperturbed. \lquote It makes it formal and it gives him authority. So \endash  everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader?\rquote 
\par Everybody put up their hand, even Zacharias Smith, though he did it very half-heartedly.
\par \lquote Er \endash  right, thanks,\rquote  said Harry, who could feel his face burning. \lquote And \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 what, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote I also think we ought to have a name,\rquote  she said brightly, her hand still in the air. \lquote It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, don\rquote t you think?\rquote 
\par \lquote Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League?\rquote  said Angelina hopefully.
\par \lquote Or the Ministry of Magic are Morons Group?\rquote  suggested Fred.
\par \lquote I was thinking,\rquote  said Hermione, frowning at Fred, \lquote more of a name that didn\rquote t tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings.\rquote

\par The room was suddenly full of shouts of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Expelliarmus. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
Wands flew in all directions; missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the ai
r. Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm. Glancing around, he thought he had b
e
en right to suggest they practise the basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding in Disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump backwards a few paces or wince as their feeble spell who
oshed over them.

said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand fly out of his hand.
\par \lquote I DID IT!\rquote  said Neville gleefully. \lquote I\rquote ve never done it before \endash  I DID IT!\rquote 
\par \lquote Good one!\rquote  said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a real duel Neville\rquote s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. \lquote 
Listen, Neville, can you take it in turns to practise with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?\rquote 
\par Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was happening to Zacharias Smith. Every time he opened his mouth to disarm Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did not seem to be mak
ing a sound. Harry did not have to look far to solve the mystery: Fred and George were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.
\par \lquote Sorry, Harry,\rquote  said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. \lquote Couldn\rquote t resist.\rquote 
\par Harry
 walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her. Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand u
n
necessarily, giving his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them; Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justi
n Finch-Fletchley\rquote s wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end.
\par \lquote OK, stop!\rquote  Harry shouted. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Stop! STOP!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

he thought, and immediately spotted one lying on top of the nearest row of books. He caught it up and blew hard. Everyone lowered their wands.
\par \lquote That wasn\rquote t bad,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but there\rquote s definite room for improvement.\rquote  Zacharias Smith glared at him. \lquote Let\rquote s try again.\rquote 
\par He moved off around the room again, stopping here and there to make suggestion
s. Slowly, the general performance improved. He avoided going near Cho and her friend for a while, but after walking twice around every other pair in the room felt he could not ignore them any longer.
\par \lquote Oh no,\rquote  said Cho rather wildly as he approached. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Expelliarmious! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\endash  oh, sorry, Marietta!\rquote 
\par Her curly-haired friend\rquote s sleeve had caught fire; Marietta extin\-guished it with her own wand and glared at Harry as though it was his fault.
\par \lquote You made me nervous, I was doing all right before then!\rquote  Cho told Harry ruefully.
\par \lquote That was quite good,\rquote  Harry lied, but when she raised her eye\-brows he said, \lquote Well, no, it was lousy, but I know you can do it properly, I was watching from over there.\rquote 
\par She laughed. Her friend Marietta looked at them rather sourly and turned away.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t mind her,\rquote  Cho muttered. \lquote She doesn\rquote t really want to be here but I made her come with me. Her parents have forbidden her to do anything that might upset Umbridge. You see \endash  her mum works for the Ministry.
\rquote 
\par \lquote What about your parents?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Well, they\rquote ve forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge, too,\rquote  said Cho, drawing herself up proudly. \lquote But if they think I\rquote m not going to fight You-Know-Who after what happened to Cedric \endash \rquote 
\par She broke off, looking rather confused, and an awkward silence fell between them; Terry Boot\rquote s wand went whizzing past Harry\rquote s ear and hit Alicia Spinnet hard on the nose.
\par \lquote Well, my dad is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 very}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148  supportive of any anti-Ministry action!\rquote  sai
d Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry; evidently she had been eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin Finch-Fletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up over his head. \lquote He\rquote s always saying he
\rquote d believe anything of Fudge; I mean, the number of goblins Fudge has had assassi\-nated! And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons, which he secretly feeds to anybody who disagrees with him. And then there
\rquote s his Umgubular Slashkilter \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t ask,\rquote  Harry muttered to Cho as she opened her mouth, looking puzzled. She giggled.
\par \lquote Hey, Harry,\rquote  Hermione called from the other end of the room, \lquote have you checked the time?\rquote 
\par He looked down at his watch and was shocked to see it was already ten past nine, which meant they needed to get back to their common rooms immediately or risk being caught and pun\-ished by Filch for being out of bounds. He blew his whistle; every\-
body stopped shouting }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Expelliarmus\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
 and the last couple of wands clattered to the floor.
\par \lquote Well, that was pretty good,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but we\rquote ve overrun, we\rquote d better leave it here. Same time, same place next week?\rquote 
\par \lquote Sooner!\rquote  said Dean Thomas eagerly and many people nodded in agreement.
\par Angelina, however, said quickly, \lquote The Quidditch season\rquote s about to start, we need team practices too!\rquote 
\par \lquote Let\rquote s say next Wednesday night, then,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote we can decide on additional meetings then. Come on, we\rquote d better get going.\rquote 
\par He pulled out the Marauder\rquote s Map again and checked it care\-fully for signs of teac
hers on the seventh floor. He let them all leave in threes and fours, watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they returned safely to their dormitories: the Hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also led to the kitchens; the Ravenclaws to a tow
er on the west side of the castle, and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the Fat Lady\rquote s portrait.
\par \lquote That was really, really good, Harry,\rquote  said Hermione, when finally it was just her, Harry and Ron who were left.
\par \lquote Yeah, it was!\rquote  said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into stone behind them. \lquote Did you see me disarm Hermione, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Only once,\rquote  said Hermione, stung. \lquote I got you loads more than you got me \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I did not only get you once, I got you at least three times \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Well, if you\rquote re counting the one where you tripped over your own feet and knocked the wand out of my hand \endash \rquote 
\par They argued all the way back to the common room, but Harry was not listening to them. He had one eye on the Marauder\rquote s Map, but he was also thinking of Cho saying he made her nervous.

Harry felt as though he were carrying some kind of talisman inside his chest over the following two weeks, a glowing secret that sup\-ported him through Umbridge\rquote 
s classes and even made it possible for him to smile blandly as he looked into her horrible bulging eyes. He and the DA were resisting her under her very nose, doing the very thing she and the Ministry most feared, and whenever he was supposed to be readi
ng Wilbert Slinkhard\rquote s book during her lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most recent meetings, remembering how Neville had successfully dis\-
armed Hermione, how Colin Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx after three meetings\rquote  hard effort, how Parvati Patil had pro\-duced such a good Reductor Curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the Sneakoscopes to dust.

He was finding it almost impossible to fix a regular night of the week for the DA meetings, as they had to accommodate three sepa\-rate team\rquote 
s Quidditch practices, which were often rearranged due to bad weather conditions; but Harry was not sorry about this; he had a feeling that it was probably better to keep the timing of their meetings unpredictable. If anyone was wat
ching them, it would be hard to make out a pattern.
\par Hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they needed to change it at short notice, because it would look sus\-picious if 
people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great Hall to talk to each other too often. She gave each of the members of the DA a fake Galleon (Ron became very excited when he first saw the basket and was convinced she was actually giving out gold)
.
\par \lquote You see the numerals around the edge of the coins?\rquote  Hermione said, holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meeting. The coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches. \lquote On real Galleons that\rquote 
s just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin. On these fake coins, though, the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting. The coins will grow hot when the date changes, so if you\rquote re carry\-
ing them in a pocket you\rquote ll be able to feel them. We take one each, and when Harry sets the date of the next meeting he\rquote ll change the numbers on }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 his }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 coin, and because I\rquote ve put a Protean Charm on them, they\rquote ll all change to mimic his.\rquote 
\par A blank silence greeted Hermione\rquote s words. She looked around at all the faces upturned to her, rather disconcerted.
\par \lquote Well \endash  I thought it was a good idea,\rquote  she said uncertainly, \lquote I mean, even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets, there\rquote s nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon, is there? But ... well, if you don\rquote 
t want to use them \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You can do a Protean Charm?\rquote  said Terry Boot.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote But that\rquote s ... that\rquote s NEWT standard, that is,\rquote  he said weakly.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Hermione, trying to look modest. \lquote Oh ... well ... yes, I suppose it is.\rquote 
\par \lquote How come you\rquote re not in Ravenclaw?\rquote  he demanded, staring at Hermione with something close to wonder. With brains like yours?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Ravenclaw during my Sorting,\rquote  said Hermione brightly, \lquote but it decided on Gryffindor in the end. So, does that mean we\rquote re using the Galleons?\rquote 
\par There was a murmur of assent and everybody moved forwards to collect one from the basket. Harry looked sideways at Hermione.
\par \lquote You know what these remind me of?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, what\rquote s that?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Death Eaters\rquote  scars. Voldemort touches one of them, and all their scars burn, and they know they\rquote ve got to join him.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well ... yes,\rquote  said Hermione quietly, \lquote that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
where I got the idea ... but you\rquote ll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members\rquote  skin.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... I prefer your way,\rquote  said Harry, grinning, as he slipped his Galleon into his pocket. \lquote I suppose the only danger with these is that we might accidentally spend them.\rquote 
\par \lquote Fat chance,\rquote  said Ron, who was examining his own fake Galleon with a slightly mournful air, \lquote I haven\rquote t got any real Galleons to con\-fuse it with.\rquote 
\par As the first Quidditch match of the season, Gryffindor versus Slytherin, drew nearer, their DA meetings were put on hold because Angelina insisted on almost daily practices. The fact
 that the Quidditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game; the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome, for they, of course, would be playing bo
t
h teams over the coming year; and the Heads of House of the competing teams, though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretence of sportsmanship, were determined to see their own side victorious. Harry realised how much Professor McGonagall care
d about beating Slytherin when she abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the match.
\par \lquote I think you\rquote ve got enough to be getting on with at the moment,\rquote  she said loftily. Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at Harry and Ron and said grimly, \lquote I\rquote 
ve become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don\rquote t want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to practise, won\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par Snape was no less obviously partisan; he had booked the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play. He was also turning a deaf ear to the many reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor p
l
ayers in the corridors. When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so thick and fast they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth, Snape insisted that she must have attempted a Hair-thickening Charm on herself and re
fused to listen to the fourteen eye-witnesses who insisted they had seen the Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library.
\par Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindor\rquote s chances; they had, after all, never lost to Malfoy\rquote s team. Admittedly, Ron was still not per\-forming to Wood\rquote 
s standard, but he was working extremely hard to improve. His greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confi\-dence after he\rquote d made a blunder; if he let in one goal he became flustered an
d was therefore likely to miss more. On the other hand, Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form; during one memorable practice he had hung one-handed from his broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goalhoop tha
t it soared the length of the pitch and through the centre hoop at the other end; the rest of the team felt this save compared favourably with one made recently by Barry Ryan, the Irish International Keeper, against Poland\rquote 
s top Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski. Even Fred had said that Ron might yet make him and George proud, and that they were seriously considering admitting he was related to them, something they assured him they had been trying to deny for four years.
\par The only thing really worrying Harry was how much Ron was allowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to upset him before they even got on to the pitch. Harry, of course, had endured their snide comments for over four years, so whispers of, \lquote 
Hey, Potty, I heard Warrington\rquote s sworn to knock you off your broom on Saturday\rquote , far from chilling his blood, made him laugh. \lquote Warrington\rquote s aim\rquote s so pathetic I\rquote 
d be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me,\rquote  he retorted, which made Ron and Hermione laugh and wiped the smirk off Pansy Parkinson\rquote s face.
\par But Ron had never endured a relentless campaign of insults, jeers and intimidation. When Slytherins, some of them seventh-years and considerably larger than he was, muttered as they passed in the corridors, \lquote 
Got your bed booked in the hospital wing, Weasley?\rquote  he didn\rquote t laugh, but turned a delicate shade of green. When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron dropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they came within sight of each other), Ron\rquote 
s ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he was likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time, too.
\par October extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving rain and November arrived, cold as frozen iron, with hard frosts every morning and icy draughts that bit at exposed hands and faces. The skies and the
 ceiling of the Great Hall turned a pale, pearly grey, the mountains around Hogwarts were snowcapped, and the temperature in the castle dropped so low that many stu\-dents wore their thick protective dragonskin gloves in the corri\-dors between lessons.

\par The morning of the match dawned bright and cold. When Harry awoke he looked round at Ron\rquote s bed and saw him sitting bolt upright, his arms around his knees, staring fixedly into space.
\par \lquote You all right?\rquote  said Harry.
\par Ron nodded but did not speak. Harry was reminded forcibly of the time Ron had accidentally put a Slug-vomiting Charm on him\-self; he looked just as pale and sweaty as he had done then, not to mention as reluctant to open his mouth.
\par \lquote You just need some breakfast,\rquote  Harry said bracingly. \lquote C\rquote mon.\rquote 
\par The Grea
t Hall was filling up fast when they arrived, the talk louder and the mood more exuberant than usual. As they passed the Slytherin table there was an upsurge of noise. Harry looked round and saw that, in addition to the usual green and silver scarves and 
hats, every one of them was wearing a silver badge in the shape of what seemed to be a crown. For some reason many of them waved at Ron, laughing uproariously. Harry tried to see what was written on the badges as he walked by, but he was too con\-
cerned to get Ron past their table quickly to linger long enough to read them.
\par They received a rousing welcome at the Gryffindor table, where everyone was wearing red and gold, but far from raising Ron\rquote s spirits the cheers seemed to sap the last of his morale; he col
lapsed on to the nearest bench looking as though he were facing his final meal.
\par \lquote I must\rquote ve been mental to do this,\rquote  he said in a croaky whisper. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Mental.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be thick,\rquote  said Harry firmly, passing him a choice of cereals, \lquote you\rquote re going to be fine. It\rquote s normal to be nervous.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m rubbish,\rquote  croaked Ron. \lquote I\rquote m lousy. I can\rquote t play to save my life. What was I thinking?\rquote 
\par \lquote Get a grip,\rquote  said Harry sternly. \lquote Look at that save you made with your foot the other day, even Fred and George said it was brilliant.\rquote 
\par Ron turned a tortured face to Harry.
\par \lquote That was an accident,\rquote  he whispered miserably. \lquote I didn\rquote t mean to do it \endash  I slipped off my broom when none of you were look\-ing and when I was trying to get back on I kicked the Quaffle by accident.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Harry, recovering quickly from this unpleasant sur\-prise, \lquote a few more accidents like that and the game\rquote s in the bag, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par Hermione and Ginny sat down opposite them wearing red and gold scarves, gloves and rosettes.
\par \lquote How\rquote re you feeling?\rquote  Ginny asked Ron, who was now staring into the dregs of milk at the bottom of his empty cereal bowl as though seriously considering attempting to drown himself in them.
\par \lquote He\rquote s just nervous,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well, that\rquote s a good sign, I never feel you perform as well in exams if you\rquote re not a bit nervous,\rquote  said Hermione heartily.
\par \lquote Hello,\rquote  said a vague and dreamy voice from behind them. Harry looked up: Luna Lovegood had drifted over from the Ravenclaw table. Many people were staring at her and a few were openly laugh\-ing and pointing; sh
e had managed to procure a hat shaped like a life-size lion\rquote s head, which was perched precariously on her head.
\par \lquote I\rquote m supporting Gryffindor,\rquote  said Luna, pointing unnecessarily at her hat. \lquote Look what it does ...\rquote 
\par She reached up and tapped the hat with her wand. It opened its mouth wide and gave an extremely realistic roar that made everyone in the vicinity jump.
\par \lquote It\rquote s good, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Luna happily. \lquote I wanted to have it chewing up a serpent to represent Slytherin, you know, but there wasn\rquote t time. Anyway ... good luck, Ronald!\rquote 
\par She drifted away. They had not quite recovered from the shock of Luna\rquote s hat before Angelina came hurrying towards them, accom\-panied by Katie and Alicia, whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned to normal by Madam Pomfrey.
\par \lquote When you\rquote re ready,\rquote  she said, \lquote we\rquote re going to go straight down to the pitch, check out conditions and change.\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote ll be there in a bit,\rquote  Harry assured her. \lquote Ron\rquote s just got to have some breakfast.\rquote 
\par It became clear after ten minutes, however, that Ron was not capable of eating anything more and Harry thought it best to get him down to the changing rooms. As they rose from the table, Hermione got up, too, and taking Harry\rquote 
s arm she drew him to one side.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t let Ron see what\rquote s on those Slytherins\rquote  badges,\rquote  she whis\-pered urgently.
\par Harry looked questioningly at her, but she shook her head warn\-ingly; Ron had just ambled over to them, looking lost and desperate.
\par \lquote Good luck, Ron,\rquote  said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek. \lquote And you, Harry \endash \rquote 
\par Ron seemed to come to himself slightly as they walked back across the Great Hall. He touched the spot on his face where Hermione had kissed him, looking puzzled, as though he was not quite sure wh
at had just happened. He seemed too distracted to notice much around him, but Harry cast a curious glance at the crown-shaped badges as they passed the Slytherin table, and this time he made out the words etched on to them:

The frosty grass crunched under their feet as they hurried down the sloping lawns towards the stadium. There was no wind at all and the sky was a uniform pearly white, which meant that visi\-
bility would be good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eyes. Harry pointed out these encouraging factors to Ron as they walked, but he was not sure that Ron was listening.
\par Angelina had changed already and was talking to the rest of the team when they entered. Harry and Ron pulled on their robes (Ron attempted to do his up back-to-front for several minutes before Alicia took pity on him and went to help), then sat down to 
listen to the pre-match talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came pouring out of the castle towards the pitch.
\par \lquote OK, I\rquote ve only just found out the final line-up for Slytherin,\rquote  said Angelina, consulting a piece of parchment. \lquote Last year\rquote s Beaters, Derrick and Bole, have left, but it looks as though Montague\rquote 
s replaced them with the usual gorillas, rather than anyone who can fly particularly well. They\rquote re two blokes called Crabbe and Goyle, I don\rquote t know much about them \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We do,\rquote  said Harry and Ron together.
\par \lquote Well, they don\rquote t look bright enough to tell one end of a broom from the other,\rquote  said Angelina, pocketing her parchment, \lquote but then I was always surprised Derrick and Bole managed to find their way on to the pitch without
 signposts.\rquote 
\par \lquote Crabbe and Goyle are in the same mould,\rquote  Harry assured her.
\par They could hear hundreds of footsteps mounting the banked benches of the spectators\rquote  stands. Some people were singing, though Harry could not make out the words. He was starting to f
eel nervous, but he knew his butterflies were as nothing compared to Ron\rquote s, who was clutching his stomach and staring straight ahead again, his jaw set and his complexion pale grey.
\par \lquote It\rquote s time,\rquote  said Angelina in a hushed voice, looking at her watch. \lquote C\rquote mon everyone ... good luck.\rquote 
\par The team rose, shouldered their brooms and marched in single file out of the changing room and into the dazzling sunlight. A roar of sound greeted them in which Harry could still hear singing, though it was muffled by the cheers and whistles.
\par The Slytherin team was standing waiting for them. They, too, were wearing those silver crown-shaped badges. The new Captain, Montague, was built along the same lines as Dudley Dursley, with massive forearms like hairy hams. Behind him lurked C
rabbe and Goyle, almost as large, blinking stupidly in the sunlight, swinging their new Beaters\rquote  bats. Malfoy stood to one side, the sunlight gleaming on his white-blond head. He caught Harry\rquote 
s eye and smirked, tapping the crown-shaped badge on his chest.
\par \lquote Captains, shake hands,\rquote  ordered the referee Madam Hooch, as Angelina and Montague reached each other. Harry could tell that Montague was trying to crush Angelina\rquote s fingers, though she did not wince. \lquote Mount your brooms ...
\rquote 
\par Madam Hooch placed her whistle in her mouth and blew.
\par The balls were released and the fourteen players shot upwards. Out of the corner of his eye Harry saw Ron streak off towards the goalhoops. Harry zoomed higher, dodging a Bludger, and set off on a wide lap of the pitch, gazing around 
for a glint of gold; on the other side of the stadium, Draco Malfoy was doing exactly the same.
\par \lquote And it\rquote s Johnson \endash  Johnson with the Quaffle, what a player that girl is, I\rquote ve been saying it for years but she still won\rquote t go out with me \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote JORDAN!\rquote  yelled Professor McGonagall.

\par In a matter of seconds, Malfoy was streaking out of the sky on Harry\rquote s left, a green and silver blur lying flat on his broom ...
\par The Snitch skirted the foot of one of the goalhoops and scooted off towards the other side of the stands; its change of direction suited Malfoy, who was nearer; Harry pulled his Firebolt around, he and Malfoy were now neck and neck ...
\par Feet from the ground, Harry lifted his right hand from his broom, stretching towards the Snitch ... to his right, Malfoy\rquote s arm extended too, was reaching, groping ...
\par It was over in two breathless, desperate, windswept seconds \endash  Harry\rquote s fingers closed around the tiny, struggling ball \endash  Malfoy\rquote s fingernails scrabbled the back of Harry\rquote s hand hopelessly \endash 
 Harry pulled his broom upwards, holding the struggling ball in his hand and the Gryffindor spectators screamed their approval ...
\par They were saved, it did not matter that Ron had let in those goals, nobody would remember as long as Gryffindor had won \endash 
\par WHAM.
\par A Bludger hit Harry squarely in the small of the back and he flew forwards off his broom. Luckily he was only five or six feet above the ground, having di
ved so low to catch the Snitch, but he was winded all the same as he landed flat on his back on the frozen pitch. He heard Madam Hooch\rquote s shrill whistle, an uproar in the stands compounded of catcalls, angry yells and jeering, a thud, then Angelina
\rquote s frantic voice.
\par \lquote Are you all right?\rquote 
\par \lquote Course I am,\rquote  said Harry grimly, taking her hand and allowing her to pull him to his feet. Madam Hooch was zooming towards one of the Slytherin players above him, though he could not see who it was from this angle.
\par \lquote It was that thug Crabbe,\rquote  said Angelina angrily, \lquote he whacked the Bludger at you the moment he saw you\rquote d got the Snitch \endash  but we won, Harry, we won!\rquote 
\par Harry heard a snort from behind him and turned around, still holding the Snitch tightly in his hand: Draco Malfoy had landed close by. White-faced with fury, he was still managing to sneer.
\par \lquote Saved Weasley\rquote s neck, haven\rquote t you?\rquote  he said to Harry. \lquote I\rquote ve never seen a worse Keeper ... but then he was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par Harry didn\rquote t answer. He 
turned away to meet the rest of the team who were now landing one by one, yelling and punching the air in triumph; all except Ron, who had dismounted from his broom over by the goalposts and seemed to be making his way slowly back to the changing rooms al
one.
\par \lquote We wanted to write another couple of verses!\rquote  Malfoy called, as Katie and Alicia hugged Harry. \lquote But we couldn\rquote t find rhymes for fat and ugly \endash  we wanted to sing about his mother, see \endash \rquote

\par Fred and George had realised what Malfoy was talking about. Halfway through shaking Harry\rquote s hand, they stiffened, looking round at Malfoy.
\par \lquote Leave it!\rquote  said Angelina at once, taking Fred by the arm. \lquote Leave it, Fred, let him yell, he\rquote s just sore he lost, the jumped-up little \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  but you like the Weasleys, don\rquote t you, Potter?\rquote  said Malfoy, sneering. \lquote Spend holidays there and everything, don\rquote t you? Can\rquote t see how you stand the stink, but I suppose when you\rquote

\par Harry grabbed hold of George. Meanwhile, it was taking the combined efforts of Angelina, Alicia and Katie to stop Fred leaping on Malfoy, who was laughing open
ly. Harry looked around for Madam Hooch, but she was still berating Crabbe for his illegal Bludger attack.
\par \lquote Or perhaps,\rquote  said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, \lquote you can remember what }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 your }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Harry was not aware of releasing George, all he knew was that a second later both of them were sprinting towards Malfoy. He had completely forgotten that all the teachers were watching: all he wanted to do was cause Malfoy as much pain as pos

\par \lquote What do you think you\rquote re doing?\rquote 
 screamed Madam Hooch, as Harry leapt to his feet. It seemed to have been her who had hit him with the Impediment Jinx; she was holding her whistle in one hand and a wand in the other; her broom lay abandoned severa
l feet away. Malfoy was curled up on the ground, whimpering and moaning, his nose bloody; George was sporting a swollen lip; Fred was still being forcibly restrained by the three Chasers, and Crabbe was cackling in the background. \lquote I\rquote

\par Harry and George marched off the pitch, both panting, neither saying a word to the other. The howling and jeering of the crowd grew fainter and fainter u
ntil they reached the Entrance Hall, where they could hear nothing except the sound of their own footsteps. Harry became aware that something was still struggling in his right hand, the knuckles of which he had bruised against Malfoy\rquote 
s jaw. Looking down, he saw the Snitch\rquote s silver wings protruding from between his fingers, struggling for release.
\par They had barely reached the door of Professor McGonagall\rquote s office when she came marching along the corridor behind them. She was wearing a Gryffindor scarf, but tore it from her throat with shaking hands as she strode towards them, looking livid.

\par \lquote In!\rquote  she said furiously, pointing to the door. Harry and George entered. She strode around behind her desk and faced them, quivering with rage as she threw the Gryffindor scarf aside on to the floor.

\rquote s Map from his trunk; he was so quick that he and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before Hermione hurried back down from the girls\rquote  dormitories, wearing scarf, gloves and one of her own knobbly elf hats.

 she said defensively, as Ron clicked his tongue impatiently.
\par They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the Cloak \endash  Ron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showing \endash  then, moving slowly and cau\-
tiously, they proceeded down the many staircases, pausing at inter\-vals to check on the map for signs of Filch or Mrs Norris. They were lucky; they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick, who was gliding along abse
nt-mindedly humming something that sounded horribly like \lquote Weasley is our King\rquote 
. They crept across the Entrance Hall and out into the silent, snowy grounds. With a great leap of his heart, Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from Hagrid\rquote 
s chimney. He set off at a quick march, the other two jostling and bumping along behind him. They crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door. When Harry raised his fist and knocked three time
s, a dog started barking frantically inside.
\par \lquote Hagrid, it\rquote s us!\rquote  Harry called through the keyhole.
\par \lquote Shoulda known!\rquote  said a gruff voice.
\par They beamed at each other under the Cloak; they could tell by Hagrid\rquote s voice that he was pleased. \lquote Bin home three seconds ... out the way, Fang ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par The bolt was drawn back, the door creaked open and Hagrid\rquote s head appeared in the gap.
\par Hermione screamed.
\par \lquote Merlin\rquote s beard, keep it down!\rquote  said Hagrid hastily, staring wildly over their heads. \lquote Under that Cloak, are yeh? Well, get in, get in!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry!\rquote  Hermione gasped, as the three of them squeezed past Hagrid into the house and pulled the Cloak off themselves so he could see them. \lquote I just \endash  oh, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote It\rquote s nuthin\rquote , it\rquote s nuthin\rquote !\rquote  said Hagrid hastily, shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains, but Hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror.
\par Hagrid\rquote s hair was matted with congealed blood and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple and black
 bruising. There were many cuts on his face and hands, some of them still bleeding, and he was moving gingerly, which made Harry suspect broken ribs. It was obvious that he had only just got home; a thick black travelling cloak lay over the back of a chai
r and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door. Hagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man, was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it.
\par \lquote What happened to you?\rquote  Harry demanded, while Fang danced around them all, trying to lick their faces.
\par \lquote Told yeh, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 nuthin\rquote ,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said Hagrid firmly. \lquote 
Want a cuppa?\rquote 
\par \lquote Come off it,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote you\rquote re in a right state!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m tellin\rquote  yeh, I\rquote m fine,\rquote  said Hagrid, straightening up and turning to beam at them all, but wincing. \lquote Blimey, it\rquote s good ter see yeh three again \endash  had good summers, did yeh?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hagrid, you\rquote ve been attacked!\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Fer the las\rquote  time, it\rquote s nuthin\rquote !\rquote  said Hagrid firmly.
\par \lquote Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face?\rquote  Ron demanded.
\par \lquote You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,\rquote  said Hermione anxiously, \lquote some of those cuts look nasty.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m dealin\rquote  with it, all righ\rquote ?\rquote  said Hagrid repressively.
\par He walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it. Underneath was a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tyre.
\par \lquote You\rquote re not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid?\rquote  said Ron, leaning in for a closer look. \lquote It looks poisonous.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s s\rquote posed ter look like that, it\rquote s dragon meat,\rquote  Hagrid said. \lquote An\rquote  I didn\rquote  get it ter eat.\rquote 
\par He picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face. Greenish blood trickled down into his beard as he gave a soft moan of satisfaction.
\par \lquote Tha\rquote s better. It helps with the stingin\rquote , yeh know.\rquote 
\par \lquote So, are you going to tell us what\rquote s happened to you?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote Can\rquote t, Harry. Top secret. More\rquote n me job\rquote s worth ter tell yeh that.\rquote 
\par \lquote Did the giants beat you up, Hagrid?\rquote  asked Hermione quietly.
\par Hagrid\rquote s fingers slipped on the dragon steak and it slid squelchily on to his chest.
\par \lquote Giants?\rquote  said Hagrid, catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face, \lquote who said anythin\rquote  abou\rquote  giants? Who yeh bin talkin\rquote  to? Who\rquote s told yeh what I\rquote ve \endash  who
\rquote s said I\rquote ve bin \endash  eh?\rquote 
\par \lquote We guessed,\rquote  said Hermione apologetically.
\par \lquote Oh, yeh did, did yeh?\rquote  said Hagrid, fixing her sternly with the eye that was not hidden by the steak.
\par \lquote It was kind of ... obvious,\rquote  said Ron. Harry nodded.
\par Hagrid glared at them, then snorted, threw the steak back on to the table and strode over to the kettle, which was now whistling.
\par \lquote Never known kids like you three fer knowin\rquote  more\rquote n yeh oughta,\rquote  he muttered, splashing boiling water into three of his bucket-shaped mugs. \lquote An\rquote  I\rquote m not complimentin\rquote  yeh, neither. Nosy, some\rquote 
d call it. Interferin\rquote .\rquote 
\par But his beard twitched.
\par \lquote So you have been to look for giants?\rquote  said Harry, grinning as he sat down at the table.
\par Hagrid set tea in front of each of them, sat down, picked up his steak again and slapped it back over his face.
\par \lquote Yeah, all righ\rquote ,\rquote  he grunted, \lquote I have.\rquote 
\par \lquote And you found them?\rquote  said Hermione in a hushed voice.
\par \lquote Well, they\rquote re not that difficult ter find, ter be honest,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Pretty big, see.\rquote 
\par \lquote Where are they?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Mountains,\rquote  said Hagrid unhelpfully.
\par \lquote So why don\rquote t Muggles \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote They do,\rquote  said Hagrid darkly. \lquote On\rquote y their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin\rquote  accidents, aren\rquote  they?\rquote 
\par He adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising.
\par \lquote Come on, Hagrid, tell us what you\rquote ve been up to!\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Tell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the Dementors \endash \rquote 
\par Hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time; a large quantity of spit, tea and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid, with a soft }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 splat,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148  on to the floor.
\par \lquote Whadda yeh mean, attacked by Dementors?\rquote  growled Hagrid.
\par \lquote Didn\rquote t you know?\rquote  Hermione asked him, wide-eyed.
\par \lquote I don\rquote  know anythin\rquote  that\rquote s bin happenin\rquote  since I left. I was on a secret mission, wasn\rquote  I, didn\rquote  wan\rquote  owls followin\rquote  me all over the place \endash  ruddy Dementors! Yeh\rquote 
re not serious?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I am, they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my cousin and me, and then the Ministry of Magic expelled me \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote WHAT?\rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and I had to go to a hearing and everything, but tell us about the giants first.\rquote 
\par \lquote You were }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 expelled?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote Tell us about your summer and I\rquote ll tell you about mine.\rquote 
\par Hagrid glared at him through his one open eye. Harry looked right back, an expression of innocent determination on his face.
\par \lquote Oh, all righ\rquote ,\rquote  Hagrid said in a resigned voice.
\par He bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fang\rquote s mouth.
\par \lquote Oh, Hagrid, don\rquote t, it\rquote s not hygien\emdash \rquote  Hermione began, but Hagrid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye.
\par He took another fortifying gulp of tea, then said, \lquote Well, we set off righ\rquote  after term ended \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Madame Maxime went with you, then?\rquote  Hermione interjected.
\par \lquote Yeah, tha\rquote s righ\rquote ,\rquote  said Hagrid, and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak. \lquote Yeah, it was jus\rquote  the pair of us. An\rquote  I\rquote 
ll tell yeh this, she\rquote s not afraid of roughin\rquote  it, Olympe. Yeh know, she\rquote s a fine, well-dressed woman, an\rquote  knowin\rquote  where we was goin\rquote  I wondered \rquote ow she\rquote d feel abou\rquote  clamberin\rquote 
 over boulders an\rquote  sleepin\rquote  in caves an\rquote  tha\rquote , bu\rquote  she never complained once.\rquote 
\par \lquote You knew where you were going?\rquote  Harry asked. \lquote You knew where the giants were?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, Dumbledore knew, an\rquote  he told us,\rquote  said Hagrid.
\par \lquote Are they hidden?\rquote  asked Ron. \lquote Is it a secret, where they are?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not really,\rquote  said Hagrid, shaking his shaggy head. \lquote It\rquote s jus\rquote  that mos\rquote  wizards aren\rquote  bothered where they are, \rquote s\rquote long as it\rquote s a good long way away. But where they are\rquote 
s very difficult ter get ter, fer humans anyway, so we needed Dumbledore\rquote s instructions. Took us abou\rquote  a month ter get there \endash \rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote A month?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
said Ron, as though he had never heard of a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time. \lquote But \endash  why couldn\rquote t you just grab a Portkey or something?\rquote 
\par There was an odd expression in Hagrid\rquote s unobscured eye as he squinted at Ron; it was almost pitying.
\par \lquote We\rquote re bein\rquote  watched, Ron,\rquote  he said gruffly.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeh don\rquote  understand,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote The Ministry\rquote s keepin\rquote  an eye on Dumbledore an\rquote  anyone they reckon\rquote s in league with \rquote im, an\rquote -\rquote 
\par \lquote We know about that,\rquote  said Harry quickly, keen to hear the rest of Hagrid\rquote s story, \lquote we know about the Ministry watching Dumbledore \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote So you couldn\rquote t use magic to get there?\rquote  asked Ron, looking thunderstruck, \lquote you had to act like Muggles }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 all the way?\rquote }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote Well, not exactly all the way,\rquote  said Hagrid cagily. \lquote We jus\rquote  had ter be careful, \rquote cause Olympe an\rquote  me, we stick out a bit \endash \rquote 
\par Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea.
\par \lquote \endash  so we\rquote re not hard ter follow. We was pretendin\rquote  we was goin\rquote  on holiday together, so we got inter France an\rquote  we made like we was headin\rquote  fer where Olympe\rquote s school is, \rquote 
cause we knew we was bein\rquote  tailed by someone from the Ministry. We had to go slow, \rquote cause I\rquote m not really s\rquote posed ter use magic an\rquote  we knew the Ministry\rquote d be lookin\rquote 
 fer a reason ter run us in. But we managed ter give the berk tailin\rquote  us the slip round abou\rquote  Dee-John \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ooooh, Dijon?\rquote  said Hermione excitedly. \lquote I\rquote ve been there on holiday, did you see \endash ?\rquote 
\par She fell silent at the look on Ron\rquote s face.
\par \lquote We chanced a bit o\rquote  magic after that an\rquote  it wasn\rquote  a bad journey. Ran inter a couple o\rquote  mad trolls on the Polish border an\rquote  I had a sligh\rquote  disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, bu\rquote 
 apart from tha\rquote  couldn\rquote t\rquote a bin smoother.
\par \lquote An\rquote  then we reached the place, an\rquote  we started trekkin\rquote  up through the mountains, lookin\rquote  fer signs of \rquote em ...
\par \lquote We had ter lay off the magic once we got near \rquote em. Partly \rquote cause they don\rquote  like wizards an\rquote  we didn\rquote  want ter put their backs up too soon, an\rquote  partly \rquote 
cause Dumbledore had warned us You-Know-Who was bound ter be after the giants an\rquote  all. Said it was odds on he\rquote d sent a messenger off ter them already. Told us ter be very careful of drawin\rquote 
 attention ter ourselves as we got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around.\rquote 
\par Hagrid paused for a long draught of tea.
\par \lquote Go on!\rquote  said Harry urgently.
\par \lquote Found \rquote em,\rquote  said Hagrid baldly. Went over a ridge one nigh\rquote  an\rquote  there they was, spread ou\rquote  underneath us. Little fires burnin\rquote  below an\rquote  huge shadows ... it was like watchin\rquote  bits o\rquote 
 the moun\-tain movin\rquote .\rquote 
\par \lquote How big are they?\rquote  asked Ron in a hushed voice.
\par \lquote \rquote Bout twenty feet,\rquote  said Hagrid casually. \lquote Some o\rquote  the bigger ones mighta bin twenty-five.\rquote 
\par \lquote And how many were there?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote I reckon abou\rquote  seventy or eighty,\rquote  said Hagrid.
\par \lquote Is that all?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Yep,\rquote  said Hagrid sadly, \lquote eighty left, an\rquote  there was loads once, musta bin a hundred diff\rquote rent tribes from all over the world. Bu\rquote  they\rquote ve bin dyin\rquote  out fer ages. Wizards killed a few, o\rquote 
 course, bu\rquote  mostly they killed each other, an\rquote  now they\rquote re dyin\rquote  out faster than ever. They\rquote re not made ter live bunched up together like tha\rquote . Dumbledore says it\rquote 
s our fault, it was the wizards who forced \rquote em to go an\rquote  made \rquote em live a good long way from us an\rquote  they had no choice bu\rquote  ter stick together fer their own protection.\rquote 
\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote you saw them and then what?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, we waited till morning, didn\rquote  want ter go sneakin\rquote  up on \rquote em in the dark, fer our own safety,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote \rquote Bout three in the mornin\rquote  they fell asleep jus\rquote  where they was sittin
\rquote . We didn\rquote  dare sleep. Fer one thing, we wanted ter make sure none of \rquote em woke up an\rquote  came up where we were, an\rquote  fer another, the snorin\rquote  was unbelievable. Caused an avalanche near mornin\rquote .
\par \lquote Anyway, once it was light we wen\rquote  down ter see \rquote em.\rquote 
\par \lquote Just like that?\rquote  said Ron, looking awestruck. \lquote You just walked right into a giant camp?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, Dumbledore\rquote d told us how ter do it,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Give the Gurg gifts, show some respect, yeh know.\rquote 
\par \lquote Give the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 what }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 gifts?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Oh, the Gurg \endash  means the chief.\rquote 
\par \lquote How could you tell which one was the Gurg?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par Hagrid grunted in amusement.
\par \lquote No problem,\rquote  he said. \lquote He was the biggest, the ugliest an\rquote  the laziest. Sittin\rquote  there waitin\rquote  ter be brought food by the others. Dead goats an\rquote  such like. Name o\rquote  Karkus. I\rquote 
d put him at twenty-two, twenty-three feet an\rquote  the weight o\rquote  a couple o\rquote  bull elephants. Skin like rhino hide an\rquote  all.\rquote 
\par \lquote And you just walked up to him?\rquote  said Hermione breathlessly.
\par \lquote Well ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 down }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 ter him, where he was lyin\rquote 
 in the valley. They was in this dip between four pretty high mountains, see, beside a mountain lake, an\rquote  Karkus was lyin\rquote  by the lake roarin\rquote  at the others ter feed him an\rquote  his wife. Olympe an\rquote  I went down the mountain
\-side \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But didn\rquote t they try and kill you when they saw you?\rquote  asked Ron incredulously.
\par \lquote It was def\rquote nitely on some o\rquote  their minds,\rquote  said Hagrid, shrug\-ging, \lquote but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do, which was ter hold our gift up high an\rquote  keep our eyes on the Gurg an\rquote 
 ignore the others. So tha\rquote s what we did. An\rquote  the rest of \rquote em went quiet an\rquote  watched us pass an\rquote  we got right up ter Karkus\rquote s feet an\rquote  we bowed an\rquote  put our present down in front o\rquote  him.
\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you give a giant?\rquote  asked Ron eagerly. \lquote Food?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nah, he can get food all righ\rquote  fer himself,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote We took him magic. Giants like magic, jus\rquote  don\rquote  like us usin\rquote  it against \rquote em. Anyway, that firs\rquote  day we gave \rquote im a branch o
\rquote  Gubraithian fire.\rquote 
\par Hermione said, \lquote Wow!\rquote  softly, but Harry and Ron both frowned in puzzlement.
\par \lquote A branch of \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Everlasting fire,\rquote  said Hermione irritably, \lquote you ought to know that by now. Professor Flitwick\rquote s mentioned it at least twice in class!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, anyway,\rquote  said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could answer back, \lquote Dumbledore\rquote d bewitched this branch to burn fer evermore, which isn\rquote  somethin\rquote  any wizard could do, an\rquote 
 so I lies it down in the snow by Karkus\rquote s feet and says, \'93A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his respectful greetings.\'94\rquote 
\par \lquote And what did Karkus say?\rquote  asked Harry eagerly.
\par \lquote Nothin\rquote ,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Didn\rquote  speak English.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re kidding!\rquote 
\par \lquote Didn\rquote  matter,\rquote  said Hagrid imperturbably, \lquote Dumbledore had warned us tha\rquote  migh\rquote  happen. Karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o\rquote  giants who knew our lingo an\rquote  they translated fer us.\rquote 
\par \lquote And did he like the present?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote Oh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it was,\rquote  said Hagrid, turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his swollen eye. \lquote Very pleased. So then I said, \'93
Albus Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift.\'94\rquote 
\par \lquote Why couldn\rquote t you speak to them that day?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Let \rquote em see we kept our promises. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 We\rquote 
ll come back tomorrow with another present, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 an\rquote  then we do come back with another present \endash  gives a good impression, see? An\rquote 
 gives them time ter test out the firs\rquote  present an\rquote  find out it\rquote s a good one, an\rquote  get \rquote em eager fer more. In any case, giants like Karkus \endash  overload \rquote em with information an\rquote  they\rquote 
ll kill yeh jus\rquote  to simplify things. So we bowed outta the way an\rquote  went off an\rquote  found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in an\rquote  the followin\rquote  mornin\rquote  we went back an\rquote  this time we fo
und Karkus sittin\rquote  up waitin\rquote  fer us lookin\rquote  all eager.\rquote 
\par \lquote And you talked to him?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yeah. Firs\rquote  we presented him with a nice battle helmet \endash  goblin-made an\rquote  indestructible, yeh know \endash  an\rquote  then we sat down an\rquote  we talked.\rquote 
\par \lquote What did he say?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not much,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Listened mostly. Bu\rquote  there were good signs. He\rquote d heard o\rquote  Dumbledore, heard he\rquote d argued against the killin\rquote  o\rquote 
 the last giants in Britain. Karkus seemed ter be quite int\rquote rested in what Dumbledore had ter say. An\rquote  a few o\rquote  the others, \rquote specially the ones who had some English, they gathered round an\rquote 
 listened too. We were hopeful when we left that day. Promised ter come back next mornin\rquote  with another present.
\par \lquote Bu\rquote  that night it all wen\rquote  wrong.\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean?\rquote  said Ron quickly.
\par \lquote Well, like I say, they\rquote re not meant ter live together, giants,\rquote  said Hagrid sadly. \lquote Not in big groups like that. They can\rquote  help themselves, they half kill each other every few weeks. The men fight each other an\rquote 
 the women fight each other; the remnants of the old tribes fight each other, an\rquote  that\rquote s even without squabbles over food an\rquote  the best fires an\rquote  sleepin\rquote  spots. Yeh\rquote d think, seein\rquote 
 as how their whole race is abou\rquote  finished, they\rquote d lay off each other, bu\rquote  ...\rquote 
\par Hagrid sighed deeply.
\par \lquote That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our cave, lookin\rquote  down on the valley. Went on fer hours, yeh wouldn\rquote  believe the noise. An\rquote  when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an\rquote  his head was lyin
\rquote  at the bottom o\rquote  the lake.\rquote 
\par \lquote Whose head?\rquote  gasped Hermione.
\par \lquote Karkus\rquote s,\rquote  said Hagrid heavily. \lquote There was a new Gurg, Golgomath.\rquote  He sighed deeply. Well, we hadn\rquote  bargained on a new Gurg two days after we\rquote d made friendly contact with the firs\rquote  one, an\rquote 
 we had a funny feelin\rquote  Golgomath wouldn\rquote  be so keen ter listen to us, bu\rquote  we had ter try.\rquote 
\par \lquote You went to speak to him?\rquote  asked Ron incredulously. \lquote After you\rquote d watched him rip off another giant\rquote s head?\rquote 
\par \lquote Course we did,\rquote  said Hagrid, \lquote we hadn\rquote  gone all that way ter give up after two days! We wen\rquote  down with the next present we\rquote d meant ter give ter Karkus.
\par \lquote I knew it was no go before I\rquote d opened me mouth. He was sit\-ting there wearin\rquote  Karkus\rquote s helmet, leerin\rquote  at us as we got nearer. He\rquote s massive, one o\rquote  the biggest ones there. Black hair an\rquote  matchin
\rquote  teeth an\rquote  a necklace o\rquote  bones. Human-lookin\rquote  bones, some of \rquote em. Well, I gave it a go \endash  held out a great roll o\rquote  dragon skin \endash  an\rquote  said, \'93A gift fer the Gurg of the giants \endash \'94
 Nex\rquote  thing I knew, I was hangin\rquote  upside-down in the air by me feet, two of his mates had grabbed me.\rquote 
\par Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth.
\par \lquote How did you get out of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 that? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 asked Harry.
\par \lquote Wouldn\rquote ta done if Olympe hadn\rquote  bin there,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote She pulled out her wand an\rquote  did some o\rquote  the fastes\rquote  spellwork I\rquote ve ever seen. Ruddy marvellous. Hit the two holdin\rquote 
 me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an\rquote  they dropped me straightaway \endash  bu\rquote  we were in trouble then, \rquote cause we\rquote d used magic against \rquote em, an\rquote  that\rquote s what giants hate abou\rquote 
 wizards. We had ter leg it an\rquote  we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter the camp again.\rquote 
\par \lquote Blimey, Hagrid,\rquote  said Ron quietly.
\par \lquote So, how come it\rquote s taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote We didn\rquote  leave after three days!\rquote  said Hagrid, looking outraged. \lquote Dumbledore was relyin\rquote  on us!\rquote 
\par \lquote But you\rquote ve just said there was no way you could go back!\rquote 
\par \lquote Not by daylight we couldn\rquote , no. We just had ter rethink a bit. Spent a couple o\rquote  days lyin\rquote  low up in the cave an\rquote  watchin\rquote . An\rquote  wha\rquote  we saw wasn\rquote  good.\rquote 
\par \lquote Did he rip off more heads?\rquote  asked Hermione, sounding squeamish.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Hagrid, \lquote I wish he had.\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote I mean we soon found out he didn\rquote  object ter all wizards \endash  just us.\rquote 
\par \lquote Death Eaters?\rquote  said Harry quickly.
\par \lquote Yep,\rquote  said Hagrid darkly. \lquote Couple of \rquote em were visitin\rquote  him ev\rquote ry day, bringin\rquote  gifts ter the Gurg, an\rquote  he wasn\rquote  dangling them upside-down.\rquote 
\par \lquote How d\rquote you know they were Death Eaters?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Because I recognised one of \rquote em,\rquote  Hagrid growled. \lquote Macnair, remember him? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, he is. Likes killin\rquote  as much as Golgomath; no wonder they were gettin\rquote  on so well.\rquote 

\par \lquote So Macnair\rquote s persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who?\rquote  said Hermione desperately.
\par \lquote Hold yer Hippogriffs, I haven\rquote  finished me story yet!\rquote  said Hagrid indignantly, who, considering he had not wanted to tell them any\-thing in the first place, now seemed to be rather enjoying himself. \lquote Me an\rquote 
 Olympe talked it over an\rquote  we agreed, jus\rquote  \rquote cause the Gurg looked like favourin\rquote  You-Know-Who didn\rquote  mean all of \rquote em would. We had ter try an\rquote  persuade some o\rquote  the others, the ones who hadn\rquote 
 wanted Golgomath as Gurg.\rquote 
\par \lquote How could you tell which ones they were?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote Well, they were the ones bein\rquote  beaten to a pulp, weren\rquote  they?\rquote  said Hagrid patiently. \lquote The ones with any sense were keepin\rquote  outta Golgomath\rquote s way, hidin\rquote  out in caves roun\rquote  the gully jus
\rquote  like we were. So we decided we\rquote d go pokin\rquote  round the caves by night an\rquote  see if we couldn\rquote  persuade a few o\rquote  them.\rquote 
\par \lquote You went poking around dark caves looking for giants?\rquote  said Ron, with awed respect in his voice.
\par \lquote Well, it wasn\rquote  the giants who worried us most,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote We were more concerned abou\rquote  the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had told us before we wen\rquote  not ter tangle with \rquote em if we could avoid it, an\rquote 
 the trouble was they knew we was around \endash  \rquote spect Golgomath told \rquote em abou\rquote  us. At night, when the giants were sleepin\rquote  an\rquote  we wanted ter be creepin\rquote  inter the caves, Macnair an\rquote 
 the other one were sneakin\rquote  round the mountains lookin\rquote  fer us. I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin\rquote  out at \rquote em,\rquote  said Hagrid, the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard, \lquote she was rarin\rquote  ter attack 
\rquote em ... she\rquote s somethin\rquote  when she\rquote s roused, Olympe ... fiery, yeh know ... \rquote spect it\rquote s the French in her ...\rquote 
\par Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire. Harry allowed him thirty seconds of reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly.
\par \lquote So, what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants?\rquote 
\par \lquote What? Oh ... oh, yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed we crept outta the cave we\rquote d bin hidin\rquote  in an\rquote  headed back down inter the gully, keepin\rquote 
 our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o\rquote  the caves, no go \endash  then, in abou\rquote  the sixth one, we found three giants hidin\rquote .\rquote 
\par \lquote Cave must\rquote ve been cramped,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Wasn\rquote  room ter swing a Kneazle,\rquote  said Hagrid.
\par \lquote Didn\rquote t they attack you when they saw you?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote Probably woulda done if they\rquote d bin in any condition,\rquote  said Hagrid, \lquote but they was badly hurt, all three o\rquote  them; Golgomath\rquote s lot had beaten \rquote em unconscious; they\rquote d woken up an\rquote  crawled
 inter the nearest shelter they could find. Anyway, one o\rquote  them had a bit of English an\rquote  \rquote e translated fer the others, an\rquote  what we had ter say didn\rquote  seem ter go down too badly. So we kep\rquote  goin\rquote 
 back, visitin\rquote  the wounded ... I reckon we had abou\rquote  six or seven o\rquote  them con\-vinced at one poin\rquote .\rquote 
\par \lquote Six or seven?\rquote  said Ron eagerly. \lquote Well that\rquote s not bad \endash  are they going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us?\rquote 
\par But Hermione said, \lquote What do you mean \'93at one point\'94, Hagrid?\rquote 
\par Hagrid looked at her sadly.
\par \lquote Golgomath\rquote s lot raided the caves. The ones tha\rquote  survived didn\rquote  wan\rquote  no more ter to do with us after that.\rquote 
\par \lquote So ... so there aren\rquote t any giants coming?\rquote  said Ron, looking disappointed.
\par \lquote Nope,\rquote  said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak and applied the cooler side to his face, \lquote but we did wha\rquote  we meant ter do, we gave \rquote em Dumbledore\rquote s message an\rquote  some o\rquote 
 them heard it an\rquote  I \rquote spect some o\rquote  them\rquote ll remember it. Jus\rquote  maybe, them that don\rquote  want ter stay around Golgomath\rquote ll move outta the moun\-tains, an\rquote  there\rquote s gotta be a chance they\rquote 
ll remember Dumbledore\rquote s friendly to \rquote em ... could be they\rquote ll come.\rquote 
\par Snow was filling up the window now. Harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through: Fang was drooling with his head in Harry\rquote s lap.
\par \lquote Hagrid?\rquote  said Hermione quietly after a while.
\par \lquote Mmm?\rquote 
\par \lquote Did you ... was there any sign of ... did you hear anything about your ... your ... mother while you were there?\rquote 
\par Hagrid\rquote s unobscured eye rested upon her and Hermione looked rather scared.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry ... I ... forget it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Dead,\rquote  Hagrid grunted. \lquote Died years ago. They told me.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh ... I\rquote m ... I\rquote m really sorry,\rquote  said Hermione in a very small voice. Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders.
\par \lquote No need,\rquote  he said shortly. \lquote Can\rquote t remember her much. Wasn\rquote  a great mother.\rquote 
\par They were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron, plainly wanting them to speak.
\par \lquote But you still haven\rquote t explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,\rquote  Ron said, gesturing towards Hagrid\rquote s bloodstained face.
\par \lquote Or why you\rquote re back so late,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Sirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Who attacked you?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote I haven\rquote  bin attacked!\rquote  said Hagrid emphatically. \lquote I \endash \rquote 
\par But the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door. Hermione gasped; her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. All four of them stared at the window beside the doorway. The shadow of some\-
body small and squat rippled across the thin curtain.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote It\rquote s her!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Ron whispered.
\par \lquote Get under here!\rquote 
 Harry said quickly; seizing the Invisibility Cloak, he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the table and dived under the Cloak as well. Huddled together, they backed away into a corner. Fang was barking madly at the door. Hagrid
 looked thoroughly confused.
\par \lquote Hagrid, hide our mugs!\rquote 
\par Hagrid seized Harry and Ron\rquote s mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fang\rquote s basket. Fang was now leaping up at the door; Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open.
\par Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps. Lips pursed, she leaned back so as to see Hagrid\rquote s face; she barely reached his navel.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote So,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 she said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to some\-
body deaf. \lquote You\rquote re Hagrid, are you?\rquote 
\par Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room, her bulging eyes rolling in every direction.
\par \lquote Get away,\rquote  she snapped, waving her handbag at Fang, who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face.
\par \lquote Er \endash  I don\rquote  want ter be rude,\rquote  said Hagrid, staring at her, \lquote but who the ruddy hell are you?\rquote 
\par \lquote My name is Dolores Umbridge.\rquote 
\par Her eyes were sweeping the cabin. Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood, sandwiched between Ron and Hermione.
\par \lquote Dolores Umbridge?\rquote  Hagrid said, sounding thoroughly confused. \lquote I thought you were one o\rquote  them Ministry \endash  don\rquote  you work with Fudge?\rquote 
\par \lquote I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,\rquote  said Umbridge, now pacing around the cabin, taking in every tiny detail within, from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned travelling cloak. \lquote 
I am now the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Tha\rquote s brave of yeh,\rquote  said Hagrid, \lquote there\rquote s not many\rquote d take tha\rquote  job any more.\rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,\rquote  said Umbridge, giving no sign that she had heard him.
\par \lquote Wha\rquote s that?\rquote  said Hagrid, frowning.
\par \lquote Precisely what I was going to ask,\rquote  said Umbridge, pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione\rquote s mug.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance towards the corner where Harry, Ron and Hermione stood hidden, \lquote oh, tha\rquote  was ... was Fang. He broke a mug. So I had ter use this one instead.\rquote 
\par Hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking, one hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye. Umbridge stood facing him now, taking in every detail of his appearance instead of the cabin\rquote s.
\par \lquote I heard voices,\rquote  she said quietly.
\par \lquote I was talkin\rquote  ter Fang,\rquote  said Hagrid stoutly.
\par \lquote And was he talking back to you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well ... in a manner o\rquote  speakin\rquote ,\rquote  said Hagrid, looking uncom\-fortable. \lquote I sometimes say Fang\rquote s near enough human \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin,\rquote  said Umbridge sleekly.
\par Hermione gasped; Harry clapped a hand over her mouth. Luckily, Fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of Professor Umbridge\rquote s robes and she did not appear to have heard.
\par \lquote Well, I on\rquote y jus\rquote  got back,\rquote  said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand at the haversack. \lquote Maybe someone came ter call earlier an\rquote  I missed \rquote em.\rquote 
\par \lquote There are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I ... I don\rquote  know why that\rquote d be ...\rquote  said Hagrid, tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing towards the corner where Harry, Ron and Hermione stood, as though asking for help. \lquote Erm ...\rquote 
\par Umbridge wheeled round and strode the length of the cabin, looking around carefully. She bent and peered under the bed. She opened Hagrid\rquote s cupboards. She passed within two inches of where Harry, Ron and Hermione stood pressed agains
t the wall; Harry actually pulled in his stomach as she walked by. After looking care\-fully inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking, she wheeled round again and said, \lquote What has happened to you? How did you sustain those injuries?
\rquote 
\par Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face, which in Harry\rquote s opinion was a mistake, because the black and purple bruising all around his eye was now clearly visible, not to men\-
tion the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face. \lquote Oh, I ... had a bit of an accident,\rquote  he said lamely.
\par \lquote What sort of accident?\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  I tripped.\rquote 
\par \lquote You tripped,\rquote  she repeated coolly.
\par \lquote Yeah, tha\rquote s right. Over ... over a friend\rquote s broomstick. I don\rquote  fly, meself. Well, look at the size o\rquote  me, I don\rquote  reckon there\rquote s a broom\-stick that\rquote d hold me. Friend o\rquote 
 mine breeds Abraxan horses, I dunno if you\rquote ve ever seen \rquote em, big beasts, winged, yeh know, I\rquote ve had a bit of a ride on one o\rquote  them an\rquote  it was \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Where have you been?\rquote  asked Umbridge, cutting coolly through Hagrid\rquote s babbling.
\par \lquote Where\rquote ve I \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Been, yes,\rquote  she said. \lquote Term started two months ago. Another teacher has had to cover your classes. None of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts. You left no address. Where have you been?
\rquote 
\par There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye. Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously.
\par \lquote I \endash  I\rquote ve been away for me health,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote For your health,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge. Her eyes travelled over Hagrid\rquote s discoloured and swollen face; dragon blood dripped gently and silently on to his waistcoat. \lquote I see.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Hagrid, \lquote bit o\rquote  \endash  o\rquote  fresh air, yeh know \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by,\rquote  said Umbridge sweetly. The small patch of Hagrid\rquote s face that was not black or purple, flushed.
\par \lquote Well \endash  change o\rquote  scene, yeh know \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Mountain scenery?\rquote  said Umbridge swiftly.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 She knows, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Harry thought desperately.
\par \lquote Mountains?\rquote  Hagrid repeated, clearly thinking fast. \lquote Nope, South o\rquote  France fer me. Bit o\rquote  sun an\rquote  ... an\rquote  sea.\rquote 
\par \lquote Really?\rquote  said Umbridge. \lquote You don\rquote t have much of a tan.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... well ... sensitive skin,\rquote  said Hagrid, attempting an ingra\-tiating smile. Harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out. Umbridge looked at him coldly;
 his smile faltered. Then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said, \lquote I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.\rquote 
\par \lquote Righ\rquote ,\rquote  said Hagrid, nodding.
\par \lquote You ought to know, too, that as High Inquisitor it is my unfor\-tunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers. So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough.\rquote 
\par She turned sharply and marched back to the door.
\par \lquote You\rquote re inspectin\rquote  us?\rquote  Hagrid echoed blankly, looking after her.
\par \lquote Oh, yes,\rquote  said Umbridge softly, looking back at him with her hand on the door handle. \lquote The Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers, Hagrid. Goodnight.\rquote 
\par She left, closing the door behind her with a snap. Harry made to pull off the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione seized his wrist.
\par \lquote Not yet,\rquote  she breathed in his ear. \lquote She might not be gone yet.\rquote 
\par Hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way; he stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so.
\par \lquote She\rquote s goin\rquote  back ter the castle,\rquote  he said in a low voice. \lquote Blimey ... inspectin\rquote  people, is she?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, pulling off the Cloak. \lquote Trelawney\rquote s on proba\-tion already ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Um ... what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class, Hagrid?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote Oh, don\rquote  you worry abou\rquote  that, I\rquote ve got a great load o\rquote  lessons planned,\rquote  said Hagrid enthusiastically, scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again. \lquote I\rquote 
ve bin keepin\rquote  a couple o\rquote  creatures saved fer yer OWL year; you wait, they\rquote re somethin\rquote  really special.\rquote 
\par \lquote Erm ... special in what way?\rquote  asked Hermione tentatively.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not sayin\rquote ,\rquote  said Hagrid happily. \lquote I don\rquote  want ter spoil the surprise.\rquote 
\par \lquote Look, Hagrid,\rquote  said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretence, \lquote Professor Umbridge won\rquote t be at all happy if you bring anything to class that\rquote s too dangerous.\rquote 
\par \lquote Dangerous?\rquote  said Hagrid, looking genially bemused. \lquote Don\rquote  be silly, I wouldn\rquote  give yeh anythin\rquote  dangerous! I mean, all righ\rquote , they can look after themselves \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hagrid, you\rquote ve got to pass Umbridge\rquote s inspection, and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after Porlocks, how to tell the difference between Knarls and hedgehogs, stuff like that!\rquote 
 said Hermione earnestly.
\par \lquote But tha\rquote s not very interestin\rquote , Hermione,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote The stuff I\rquote ve got\rquote s much more impressive. I\rquote ve bin bringin\rquote  \rquote em on fer years, I reckon I\rquote ve got the on\rquote 
y domestic herd in Britain.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hagrid ... please ...\rquote  said Hermione, a note of real desperation in her voice. \lquote Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore. Please, Hagrid, teach us something dull that\rquote 
s bound to come up in our OWL.\rquote 
\par But Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one-eyed look of longing towards the vast bed in the corner.
\par \lquote Lis\rquote en, it\rquote s bin a long day an\rquote  it\rquote s late,\rquote  he said, patting Hermione gently on the shoulder, so that her knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud. \lquote Oh \endash  sorry \endash \rquote 
 He pulled her back up by the neck of her robes. \lquote Look, don\rquote  you go worryin\rquote  abou\rquote  me, I promise yeh I\rquote ve got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I\rquote 
m back ... now you lot had better get back up to the castle, an\rquote  don\rquote  forget ter wipe yer footprints out behind yeh!\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno if you got through to him,\rquote  said Ron a short while later when, having checked that 
the coast was clear, they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind them due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was per\-forming as they went.
\par \lquote Then I\rquote ll go back again tomorrow,\rquote  said Hermione determinedly. \lquote I\rquote ll plan his lessons for him if I have to. I don\rquote t care if she throws out Trelawney but she\rquote s not getting rid of Hagrid!\rquote

Harry and Ron wanted to go with her, but their mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again, so they remained grudgingly in the common room, trying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside, where students were enjoyin
g themselves skating on the frozen lake, tobogganing and, worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up to Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows.

 bellowed Ron, finally losing patience and sticking his head out of the window, \lquote I am a prefect and if one more snowball hits this window \endash  OUCH!\rquote 
\par He withdrew his head sharply, his face covered in snow.
\par \lquote It\rquote s Fred and George,\rquote  he said bitterly, slamming the window behind him. \lquote Gits ...\rquote 
\par Hermione returned from Hagrid\rquote s just before lunch, shivering slightly, her robes damp to the knees.
\par \lquote So?\rquote  said Ron, looking up when she entered. \lquote Got all his les\-sons planned for him?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I tried,\rquote  she said dully, sinking into a chair beside Harry. She pulled out her wand and gave 
it a complicated little wave so that hot air streamed out of the tip; she then pointed this at her robes, which began to steam as they dried out. \lquote He wasn\rquote 
t even there when I arrived, I was knocking for at least half an hour. And then he came stumping out of the Forest \endash \rquote 
\par Harry groaned. The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of creatures most likely to get Hagrid the sack. \lquote What\rquote s he keeping in there? Did he say?\rquote  he asked.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Hermione miserably. \lquote He says he wants them to be a surprise. I tried to explain about Umbridge, but he just doesn\rquote t get it. He kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study Knarls than Chimaeras \endash 
 oh, I don\rquote t think he\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 got }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 a Chimaera,\rquote 
 she added at the appalled look on Harry and Ron\rquote s faces, \lquote but that\rquote s not for lack of trying, from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs. I don\rquote t know how many times I told him he\rquote 
d be better off following Grubbly-Plank\rquote s plan, I honestly don\rquote t think he lis\-tened to half of what I said. He\rquote s in a bit of a funny mood, you know. He still won\rquote t say how he got all those injuries.\rquote 
\par Hagrid\rquote s reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from all students. Some, like Fred, George and Lee, roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle betwee
n the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrid\rquote s enormous hand; others, like Parvati and Lavender, exchanged gloomy looks and shook their heads. Harry knew that many of them preferred Professor Grubbly-Plank\rquote 
s lessons, and the worst of it was that a very small, unbiased part of him knew that they had good reason: Grubbly-Plank\rquote s idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that somebody might have their head ripped off.
\par It was with a certain amount of apprehension that Harry, Ron and Hermione headed down to Hagrid\rquote 
s on Tuesday, heavily muffled against the cold. Harry was worried, not only about what Hagrid might have decided to teach them, but also about how the rest of the class, particularly Malfoy and his cronies, would behave if Umbridge was watching them.

\par However, the High Inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they struggled through the snow towards Hagrid, who stood waiting for them on the edge of the Forest. He did not present a reassuring sight; the bruises that had been purp
le on Saturday night were now tinged with green and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding. Harry could not understand this: had Hagrid per\-
haps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from healing? As though to complete the omi\-nous picture, Hagrid was carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder.
\par \lquote We\rquote re workin\rquote  in here today!\rquote  Hagrid called happily to the approaching students, jerking his head back at the dark trees behind him. \lquote Bit more sheltered! Anyway, they prefer the dark.\rquote 
\par \lquote What prefers the dark?\rquote  Harry heard Malfoy say sharply to Crabbe and Goyle, a trace of panic in his voice. \lquote What did he say prefers the dark \endash  did you hear?\rquote 
\par Harry remembered the only other occasion on which Malfoy had entered the Forest before now; he had not been very brave then, either. He smiled to himself; after the Quidditch match any\-thing that caused Malfoy discomfort was all right with him.
\par \lquote Ready?\rquote  said Hagrid cheerfully, looking around at the class. \lquote Right, well, I\rquote ve bin savin\rquote  a trip inter the Forest fer yer fifth year. Thought we\rquote d go an\rquote 
 see these creatures in their natural habitat. Now, what we\rquote re studyin\rquote  today is pretty rare, I reckon I\rquote m prob\-ably the on\rquote y person in Britain who\rquote s managed ter train \rquote em.\rquote 
\par \lquote And you\rquote re sure they\rquote re trained, are you?\rquote  said Malfoy, the panic in his voice even more pronounced. \lquote Only it wouldn\rquote t be the first time you\rquote d brought wild stuff to class, would it?\rquote 
\par The Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked as though they thought Malfoy had a fair point, too.
\par \lquote Course they\rquote re trained,\rquote  said Hagrid, scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his shoulder.
\par \lquote So what happened to your face, then?\rquote  demanded Malfoy.
\par \lquote Mind yer own business!\rquote  said Hagrid, angrily. \lquote Now, if yeh\rquote ve finished askin\rquote  stupid questions, follow me!\rquote 
\par He turned and strode straight into the Forest. Nobody seemed much disposed to follow. Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after Hagrid, leading the rest of the class.
\par They walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow at all on the ground. With a grunt, Hagrid deposited his half a cow 
on the ground, stepped back and turned to face his class, most of whom were creeping from tree to tree towards him, peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at any moment.
\par \lquote Gather roun\rquote , gather roun\rquote ,\rquote  Hagrid encouraged. \lquote Now, they\rquote ll be attracted by the smell o\rquote  the meat but I\rquote m goin\rquote  ter give \rquote em a call anyway, \rquote cause they\rquote 
ll like ter know it\rquote s me.\rquote 
\par He turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face and gave an odd, shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird. Nobody laughed: most of them looked too scared to make a sound.
\par Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again. A minute passed in which the class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of w
hatever it was that was coming. And then, as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enormous chest, Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees.
\par A pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing lar
ger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face, neck and then skeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerged from the darkness. It looked around at the class for a few seconds, swishing its long black tail, then bowed its head and bega
n to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs.
\par A great wave of relief broke over Harry. Here at last was proof that he had not imagined these creatures, that they were real: Hagrid knew about them too. He looked eagerly at Ron, but Ron was still 
staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, \lquote Why doesn\rquote t Hagrid call again?\rquote 
\par Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as Ron\rquote s and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse stand
ing feet from them. There were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face; and Neville, whose eyes were followi
ng the swishing progress of the long black tail.
\par \lquote Oh, an\rquote  here comes another one!\rquote  said Hagrid proudly, as a second black horse appeared out of the dark trees, folded its leathery wings closer to its body and dipped its head to gorge on the meat. \lquote Now ... p
ut yer hands up, who can see \rquote em?\rquote 
\par Immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to under\-stand the mystery of these horses, Harry raised his hand. Hagrid nodded at him.
\par \lquote Yeah ... yeah, I knew you\rquote d be able ter, Harry,\rquote  he said seri\-ously. \lquote An\rquote  you too, Neville, eh? An\rquote  \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Excuse me,\rquote  said Malfoy in a sneering voice, \lquote but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing?\rquote 
\par For an answer, Hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground. The whole class stared at it for a few seconds, then several people
 gasped and Parvati squealed. Harry understood why: bits of flesh stripping themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to look very odd indeed.
\par \lquote What\rquote s doing it?\rquote  Parvati demanded in a terrified voice, retreating behind the nearest tree. \lquote What\rquote s eating it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Thestrals,\rquote  said Hagrid proudly and Hermione gave a soft }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Oh!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 of comprehension at Harry\rquote s shoulder. \lquote Hogwarts has got a whole herd of \rquote em in here. Now, who knows \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote But they\rquote re really, really unlucky!\rquote  interrupted Parvati, looking alarmed. \lquote They\rquote re supposed to bring all sorts of horrible mis\-fortune on people who see them. Professor Trelawney told me once \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, no, no,\rquote  said Hagrid, chuckling, \lquote tha\rquote s jus\rquote  superstition, that is, they aren\rquote  unlucky, they\rquote re dead clever an\rquote  useful! Course, this lot don\rquote  get a lot o\rquote  work, it\rquote

\par Two more horses came quietly out of the trees, one of them passing very close to Parvati, who shivered and pressed herself closer to the tree, saying, \lquote I think I felt something, I think it\rquote s near me!\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote  worry, it won\rquote  hurt yeh,\rquote  said Hagrid patiently. \lquote Righ\rquote , now, who can tell me why some o\rquote  yeh can see \rquote em an\rquote  some can\rquote t?\rquote 
\par Hermione raised her hand.
\par \lquote Go on then,\rquote  said Hagrid, beaming at her.
\par \lquote The only people who can see Thestrals,\rquote  she said, \lquote are people who have seen death.\rquote 
\par \lquote Tha\rquote s exactly right,\rquote  said Hagrid solemnly, \lquote ten points ter Gryffindor. Now, Thestrals \endash \rquote

\par Professor Umbridge had arrived. She was standing a few feet away from Harry, wearing her green hat and cloak again, her clip\-board at the ready. Hagrid, who had never heard Umbridge\rquote s fake cough before, was gazing in some concern at the closes
t Thestral, evidently under the impression that it had made the sound.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Hem, hem.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote Oh, hello!\rquote  Hagrid said, smiling, having located the source of the noise.
\par \lquote You received the note I sent to your cabin this morning?\rquote  said Umbridge, in the same loud, slow voice she had used with him earlier, as though she were addressing somebody both foreign and very slow. \lquote 
Telling you that I would be inspecting your lesson?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yeah,\rquote  said Hagrid brightly. \lquote Glad yeh found the place all righ\rquote ! Well, as you can see \endash  or, I dunno \endash  can you? We\rquote re doin\rquote  Thestrals today \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry?\rquote  said Professor Umbridge loudly, cupping her hand around her ear and frowning. \lquote What did you say?\rquote 
\par Hagrid looked a little confused.
\par \lquote Er \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Thestrals! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 he said loudly. \lquote Big \endash  er \endash 
 winged horses, yeh know!\rquote 
\par He flapped his gigantic arms hopefully. Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on her clipboard: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Appears ... to ... have ... poor ... short ... term ... memory,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
mut\-tered Umbridge, loudly enough for everyone to hear her. Draco Malfoy looked as though Christmas had come a month early; Hermione, on the other hand, had turned scarlet with suppressed rage.
\par \lquote Oh, yeah,\rquote  said Hagrid, throwing an uneasy glance at Umbridge\rquote s clipboard, but ploughing on valiantly. \lquote Yeah, I was gonna tell yeh how come we got a herd. Yeah, so, we started off with a male an\rquote  five females. This one,
\rquote  he patted the first horse to have appeared, \lquote name o\rquote  Tenebrus, he\rquote s my special favourite, firs\rquote  one born here in the Forest \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Are you aware,\rquote  Umbridge said loudly, interrupting him, \lquote that the Ministry of Magic has classified Thestrals as \'93dangerous\'94?\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s heart sank like a stone, but Hagrid merely chuckled.
\par \lquote Thestrals aren\rquote  dangerous! All righ\rquote , they might take a bite outta yeh if yeh really annoy them \endash \rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Shows ... signs ... of ... pleasure ... at ... idea ... of ... violence,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 muttered Umbridge, scribbling on her clipboard again.
\par \lquote No \endash  come on!\rquote  said Hagrid, looking a little anxious now. \lquote I mean, a dog\rquote ll bite if yeh bait it, won\rquote  it \endash  but Thestrals have jus\rquote  got a bad reputation because o\rquote  the death thing \endash 
 people used ter think they were bad omens, didn\rquote  they? Jus\rquote  didn\rquote  understand, did they?\rquote 
\par Umbridge did not answer; she finished writing her last note, then looked up at Hagrid and said, again very loudly and slowly, \lquote Please continue teaching as usual. I am going to walk,\rquote 
 she mimed walking (Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson were having silent fits of laughter) \lquote among the students\rquote  (she pointed around at individual members of the class) \lquote and ask them questions.\rquote  
She pointed at her mouth to indicate talking.
\par Hagrid stared at her, clearly at a complete loss to understand why she was acting as though he did not understand normal English. Hermione had tears of fury in her eyes now.
\par \lquote You hag, you evil hag!\rquote  she whispered, as Umbridge walked towards Pansy Parkinson. \lquote I know what you\rquote re doing, you awful, twisted, vicious \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Erm ... anyway,\rquote  said Hagrid, clearly struggling to regain the flow of his lesson, \lquote so \endash  Thestrals. Yeah. Well, there\rquote s loads o\rquote  good stuff abou\rquote  them ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Do you find,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge in a ringing voice to Pansy Parkinson, \lquote that you are able to understand Professor Hagrid when he talks?\rquote 
\par Just like Hermione, Pansy had tears in her eyes, but these were tears of laughter; indeed, her answer was almost incoherent because she was trying to suppress her giggles.
\par \lquote No ... because ... well ... it sounds ... like grunting a lot of the time ...\rquote 
\par Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard. The few unbruised bits of Hagrid\rquote s face flushed, but he tried to act as though he had not heard Pansy\rquote s answer.
\par \lquote Er ... yeah ... good stuff abou\rquote  Thestrals. Well, once they\rquote re tamed, like this lot, yeh\rquote ll never be lost again. \rquote Mazin\rquote  sense o\rquote  direction, jus\rquote  tell \rquote em where yeh want ter go \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote Assuming they can understand you, of course,\rquote  said Malfoy loudly, and Pansy Parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles. Professor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to Neville.
\par \lquote You can see the Thestrals, Longbottom, can you?\rquote  she said.
\par Neville nodded.
\par \lquote Who did you see die?\rquote  she asked, her tone indifferent.
\par \lquote My ... my grandad,\rquote  said Neville.
\par \lquote And what do you think of them?\rquote  she said, waving her stubby hand at the horses, who by now had stripped a great deal of the carcass down to bone.
\par \lquote Erm,\rquote  said Neville nervously, with a glance at Hagrid. \lquote Well, they\rquote re ... er ... OK ...\rquote

muttered Umbridge, making another note on her clipboard.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Neville, looking upset. \lquote No, I\rquote m not scared of them!\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s quite all right,\rquote  said Umbridge, patting Neville on the shoulder with what she evidently intended to be an understanding smile, though it looked more like a leer to Harry. \lquote Well, Hagrid,\rquote 
 she turned to look up at him again, speaking once more in that loud, slow voice, \lquote I think I\rquote ve got enough to be getting along with. You will receive\rquote  (she mimed taking something from the air in front of her) \lquote 
the results of your inspection\rquote  (she pointed at the clipboard) \lquote in ten days\rquote  time.\rquote  She held 
up ten stubby little fingers, then, her smile wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath her green hat, she bustled from their midst, leaving Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson in fits of laughter, Hermione actually shaking with fury and Neville looking con
fused and upset.
\par \lquote That foul, lying, twisting old gargoyle!\rquote  stormed Hermione half an hour later, as they made their way back up to the castle through the channels they had made earlier in the snow. \lquote You see what she\rquote s up to? It\rquote

\par \lquote Umbridge said they\rquote re dangerous,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Well, it\rquote s like Hagrid said, they can look after themselves,\rquote  said Hermione impatiently, \lquote and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank wouldn\rquote t usually show them to us before NEWT level, but, well, they }{\rtlch\fcs1

\lquote Three in a class \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, Weasley, we were just wondering,\rquote  said a malicious voice. Unheard by any of them in the muffling snow, Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle were walking along right behind them. \lquote D\rquote you reckon if you saw someone snuff it you\rquote 
d be able to see the Quaffle better?\rquote 
\par He, Crabbe and Goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on their way to the castle, then broke into a chorus of \lquote Weasley is our King\rquote . Ron\rquote s ears turned scarlet.
\par \lquote Ignore them, just ignore them,\rquote  intoned Hermione, pulling out her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again, so that she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouses.

s guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with Sirius. He wondered whether he could possibly persuade Mrs Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities. Even though he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit S
irius to leave Grimmauld Place anyway, he could not help but think Mrs Weasley might not want him; they were so often at loggerheads. Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire, and although Harry knew that with Umbridge o
n con\-stant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him, he did not like to think of Sirius alone in his mother\rquote s old house, perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher.
\par Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last DA meeting before
 the holidays and was very glad he had, because when the torches burst into flame he saw that Dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for Christmas. He could tell the elf had done it, because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden ba
ubles from the ceiling, each showing a picture of Harry\rquote s face and bearing the legend: HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS!
\par Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and Luna Lovegood entered, looking as dreamy as usual.
\par \lquote Hello,\rquote  she said vaguely, looking around at what remained of the decorations. \lquote These are nice, did you put them up?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote it was Dobby the house-elf.\rquote 
\par \lquote Mistletoe,\rquote  said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harry\rquote s head. He jumped out from under it. \lquote Good thinking,\rquote  said Luna very seriously. \lquote It\rquote 
s often infested with Nargles.\rquote 
\par Harry was saved the necessity of asking what Nargles are by the arrival of Angelina, Katie and Alicia. All three of them were breath\-less and looked very cold.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Angelina dully, pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner, \lquote we\rquote ve finally replaced you.\rquote 
\par \lquote Replaced me?\rquote  said Harry blankly.
\par \lquote You and Fred and George,\rquote  she said impatiently. \lquote We\rquote ve got another Seeker!\rquote 
\par \lquote Who?\rquote  said Harry quickly.
\par \lquote Ginny Weasley,\rquote  said Katie.
\par Harry gaped at her.
\par \lquote Yeah, I know,\rquote  said Angelina, pulling out her wand and flexing her arm, \lquote but she\rquote s pretty good, actually. Nothing on you, of course,\rquote  she said, throwing him a very dirty look, \lquote but as we can\rquote t have you ...
\rquote 
\par Harry bit back the retort he was longing to utter: did she imagine for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hundred times more than she did?
\par \lquote And what about the Beaters?\rquote  he asked, trying to keep his voice even.
\par \lquote Andrew Kirke,\rquote  said Alicia without enthusiasm, \lquote and Jack Sloper. Neither of them are brilliant, but compared to the rest of the idiots who turned up ...\rquote 
\par The arrival of Ron, Hermione and Neville brought this depressing discussion to an end, and within five minutes the room was full enough to prevent Harry seeing Angelina\rquote s burning, reproachful looks.
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  he said, calling them all to order. \lquote I thought this evening we should just go over the things we\rquote ve done so far, because it\rquote s the last meeting before the holidays and there\rquote 
s no point starting anything new right before a three-week break \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re not doing anything new?\rquote  said Zacharias Smith, in a dis\-gruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room. \lquote If I\rquote d known that, I wouldn\rquote t have come.\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re all really sorry Harry didn\rquote t tell you, then,\rquote  said Fred loudly.
\par Several people sniggered. Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in his stomach, as though he had missed a step going downstairs.
\par \lquote \endash  we can practise in pairs,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote We\rquote ll start with the Impediment Jinx, for ten minutes, then we can get out the cush\-ions and try Stunning again.\rquote 
\par They all divided up obediently; Harry partnered Neville as usual. The room was soon full of intermittent cries of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Impedimenta!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 People froze for a minute or so, during which their partner would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work, then would unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx.
\par Neville had improved beyond all recognition. After a while, when Harry had unfrozen three times in a row, he had Neville join Ron and Hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the others. When he passed Cho she beamed at him; he resis
ted the temptation to walk past her several more times.
\par After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, they laid out cush\-ions all over the floor and started practising Stunning again. Space was really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once; h
alf the group observed the others for a while, then swapped over. Harry felt himself positively swelling with pride as he watched them all. True, Neville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean, at whom he had been aiming, but it was a much closer miss than
 usual, and everybody else had made enormous progress.
\par At the end of an hour, Harry called a halt.
\par \lquote You\rquote re getting really good,\rquote  he said, beaming around at them. \lquote When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuff \endash  maybe even Patronuses.\rquote 
\par There was a murmur of excitement. The room began to clear in the usual twos and threes; most people wished Harry a \lquote Happy Christmas\rquote 
 as they went. Feeling cheerful, he collected up the cushions with Ron and Hermione and stacked them neatly away. Ron and Hermione left before he did; he hung back a little, because Cho was still there and he was hoping to receive a \lquote 
Merry Christmas\rquote  from her.
\par \lquote No, you go on,\rquote  he heard her say to her friend Marietta and his heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his Adam\rquote s apple.
\par He pretended to be straightening the cushion pile. He was quite sure they were alone now and waited for her to speak. Instead, he heard a hearty sniff.
\par He turned and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down her face.
\par \lquote Wha\emdash ?\rquote 
\par He didn\rquote t know what to do. She was simply standing there, crying silently.
\par \lquote What\rquote s up?\rquote  he said, feebly.
\par She shook her head and wiped her eyes on her sleeve.
\par \lquote I\rquote m \endash  sorry,\rquote  she said thickly. \lquote I suppose ... it\rquote s just ... learning all this stuff ... it just makes me ... wonder whether ... if }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Harry\rquote s heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled somewhere around his navel. He ought to have known. She wanted to talk about Cedric.
\par \lquote He did know this stuff,\rquote  Harry said heavily. \lquote He was really good at it, or he could never have got to the middle of that maze. But if Voldemort really wants to kill you, you don\rquote t stand a chance.\rquote 
\par She hiccoughed at the sound of Voldemort\rquote s name, but stared at Harry without flinching.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 survived when you were just a baby,\rquote  she said quietly.
\par \lquote Yeah, well,\rquote  said Harry wearily, moving towards the door, \lquote I dunno why, nor does anyone else, so it\rquote s nothing to be proud of.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, don\rquote t go!\rquote  said Cho, sounding tearful again. \lquote I\rquote m really sorry to get all upset like this ... I didn\rquote t mean to ...\rquote 
\par She hiccoughed again. She was very pretty even when her eyes were red and puffy. Harry felt thoroughly miserable. He\rquote d have been so pleased with just a \lquote Merry Christmas\rquote .
\par \lquote I know it must be horrible for you,\rquote  she said, mopping her eyes on her sleeve again. \lquote Me mentioning Cedric, when you saw him die ... I suppose you just want to forget about it?\rquote 
\par Harry did not say anything to this; it was quite true, but he felt heartless saying it.
\par \lquote You\rquote re a r-really good teacher, you know,\rquote  said Cho, with a watery smile. \lquote I\rquote ve never been able to Stun anything before.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  said Harry awkwardly.
\par They looked at each other for a long moment. Harry felt a burning desire to run from the room and, at the same time, a complete inability to move his feet.
\par \lquote Mistletoe,\rquote  said Cho quietly, pointing at the ceiling over his head.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry. His mouth was very dry. \lquote It\rquote s probably full of Nargles, though.\rquote 
\par \lquote What are Nargles?\rquote 
\par \lquote No idea,\rquote  said Harry. She had moved closer. His brain seemed to have been Stunned. \lquote You\rquote d have to ask Loony. Luna, I mean.\rquote 
\par Cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh. She was even nearer to him now. He could have counted the freckles on her nose.
\par \lquote I really like you, Harry.\rquote 
\par He could not think. A tingling sensation was spreading through him, paralysing his arms, legs and brain.
\par She was much too close. He could see every tear clinging to her eyelashes ...

\par Harry didn\rquote t answer. He was in a state of shock. Half of him wanted to tell Ron and Hermione what had just happened, but the other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave.
\par \lquote Are you all right, Harry?\rquote  Hermione asked, peering at him over the tip of her quill.
\par Harry gave a half-hearted shrug. In truth, he didn\rquote t know whether he was all right or not. \lquote What\rquote s up?\rquote  said Ron, hoisting himself up on his elbow to get a clearer view of Harry. \lquote What\rquote s happened?\rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t quite know how to set about telling them, and still wasn\rquote t sure whether he wanted to. Just as he had decided not to say anything, Hermione took matters out of his hands.
\par \lquote Is it Cho?\rquote  she asked in a businesslike way. \lquote Did she corner you after the meeting?\rquote 
\par Numbly surprised, Harry nodded. Ron sniggered, breaking off when Hermione caught his eye.
\par \lquote So \endash  er \endash  what did she want?\rquote  he asked in a mock casual voice.
\par \lquote She \endash \rquote  Harry began, rather hoarsely; he cleared his throat and tried again. \lquote She \endash  er \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Did you kiss?\rquote  asked Hermione briskly.
\par Ron sat up so fast he sent his ink bottle flying all over the rug. Disregarding this completely, he stared avidly at Harry.
\par \lquote Well?\rquote  he demanded.
\par Harry looked from Ron\rquote s expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to Hermione\rquote s slight frown, and nodded.
\par \lquote HA!\rquote 
\par Ron made a triumphant gesture with his fist and went into a raucous peal of laughter that made several timid-looking second-years over beside the window jump. A reluctant grin spread over Harry\rquote 
s face as he watched Ron rolling around on the hearthrug. Hermione gave Ron a look of deep disgust and returned to her letter.
\par \lquote Well?\rquote  Ron said finally, looking up at Harry. \lquote How was it?\rquote 
\par Harry considered for a moment.
\par \lquote Wet,\rquote  he said truthfully.
\par Ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or dis\-gust, it was hard to tell.
\par \lquote Because she was crying,\rquote  Harry continued heavily.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Ron, his smile fading slightly. \lquote Are you that bad at kissing?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dunno,\rquote  said Harry, who hadn\rquote t considered this, and immedi\-ately felt rather worried. \lquote Maybe I am.\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course you\rquote re not,\rquote  said Hermione absently, still scribbling away at her letter.
\par \lquote How do you know?\rquote  said Ron very sharply.
\par \lquote Because Cho spends half her time crying these days,\rquote  said Hermione vaguely. \lquote She does it at mealtimes, in the loos, all over the place.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote d think a bit of kissing would cheer her up,\rquote  said Ron, grin\-ning.
\par \lquote Ron,\rquote  said Hermione in a dignified voice, dipping the point of her quill into her inkpot, \lquote you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet.\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s that supposed to mean?\rquote  said Ron indignantly. \lquote What sort of person cries while someone\rquote s kissing them?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, slightly desperately, \lquote who does?\rquote 
\par Hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on her face.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you understand how Cho\rquote s feeling at the moment?\rquote  she asked.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry and Ron together.
\par Hermione sighed and laid down her quill.
\par \lquote Well, obviously, she\rquote s feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying. Then I expect she\rquote s feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry, and she can\rquote t work out who she likes best. Then she\rquote 
ll be feeling guilty, thinking it\rquote s an insult to Cedric\rquote s memory to be kissing Harry at all, and she\rquote ll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry. And she probably can\rquote 
t work out what her feelings towards Harry are, anyway, because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that\rquote s all very mixed up and painful. Oh, and she\rquote s afraid she\rquote 
s going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she\rquote s been flying so badly.\rquote 
\par A slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech, then Ron said, \lquote One person can\rquote t feel all that at once, they\rquote d explode.\rquote 
\par \lquote Just because you\rquote ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn\rquote t mean we all have,\rquote  said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again.
\par \lquote She was the one who started it,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I wouldn\rquote t\rquote ve \endash  she just sort of came at me \endash  and next thing she\rquote s crying all over me \endash  I didn\rquote t know what to do \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t blame you, mate,\rquote  said Ron, looking alarmed at the very thought.
\par \lquote You just had to be nice to her,\rquote  said Hermione, looking up anx\-iously. \lquote You were, weren\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Harry, an unpleasant heat creeping up his face, \lquote I sort of \endash  patted her on the back a bit.\rquote 
\par Hermione looked as though she was restraining herself from rolling her eyes with extreme difficulty.
\par \lquote Well, I suppose it could have been worse,\rquote  she said. \lquote Are you going to see her again?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll have to, won\rquote t I?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote We\rquote ve got DA meetings, haven\rquote t we?\rquote 
\par \lquote You know what I mean,\rquote  said Hermione impatiently.
\par Harry said nothing. Hermione\rquote s words opened up a whole new vista of frightening possibilities. He tried to imagine going some\-where with Cho \endash  Hogsmeade, perhaps \endash 
 and being alone with her for hours at a time. Of course, she would have been expecting him to ask her out after what had just happened ... the thought made his stomach clench painfully.
\par \lquote Oh well,\rquote  said Hermione distantly, buried in her letter once more, \lquote you\rquote ll have plenty of opportunities to ask her.\rquote 
\par \lquote What if he doesn\rquote t want to ask her?\rquote  said Ron, who had been watching Harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be silly,\rquote  said Hermione vaguely, \lquote Harry\rquote s liked her for ages, haven\rquote t you, Harry?\rquote 
\par He did not answer. Yes, he had liked Cho for ages, but when\-ever he had imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured a Cho who was enjoying herself, as opposed to a Cho who was sobbing uncontrollably into his shoulder.
\par \lquote Who\rquote re you writing the novel to, anyway?\rquote  Ron asked Hermione, trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor. Hermione hitched it up out of sight.
\par \lquote Viktor.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Krum?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote How many other Viktors do we know?\rquote 
\par Ron said nothing, but looked disgruntled. They sat in silence for another twenty minutes, Ron finishing his Transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience and crossings-out, Hermione writing steadily t
o the very end of the parchment, rolling it up carefully and sealing it, and Harry staring into the fire, wishing more than any\-thing that Sirius\rquote 
s head would appear there and give him some advice about girls. But the fire merely crackled lower and lower, until the red-hot embers crumbled into ash and, looking around, Harry saw that they were, yet again, the last ones in the common room.
\par \lquote Well, night,\rquote  said Hermione, yawning widely as she set off up the girls\rquote  staircase.
\par \lquote What does she see in Krum?\rquote  Ron demanded, as he and Harry climbed the boys\rquote  stairs.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Harry, considering the matter, \lquote I s\rquote pose he\rquote s older, isn\rquote t he ... and he\rquote s an international Quidditch player ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, but apart from that,\rquote  said Ron, sounding aggravated. \lquote I mean, he\rquote s a grouchy git, isn\rquote t he?\rquote 
\par \lquote Bit grouchy, yeah,\rquote  said Harry, whose thoughts were still on Cho.
\par They pulled off their robes and put on pyjamas in silence; Dean, Seamus and Neville were already asleep. Harry put his glasses on his bedside table and got into bed but 
did not pull the hangings closed around his four-poster; instead, he stared at the patch of starry sky visible through the window next to Neville\rquote s bed. If he had known, this time last night, that in twenty-four hours\rquote 
 time he would have kissed Cho Chang ...
\par \lquote Night,\rquote  grunted Ron, from somewhere to his right.
\par \lquote Night,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Maybe next time ... if there was a next time ... she\rquote d be a bit happier. He ought to have asked her out; she had probably been expecting it and was now really angry with him ... or 
was she lying in bed, still crying about Cedric? He did not know what to think. Hermiones explanation had made it all seem more compli\-cated rather than easier to understand.

\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Neville snuffled in his sleep. An owl hooted somewhere out in the night.
\par Harry dreamed he was back in the DA room. Cho was accusing him of luring her there under false pretences; she said he had promised her a hundred and fifty Chocolate Frog Cards if she showed up. Harry protested ... Cho shouted, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Cedric gave me loads of Chocolate Frog Cards, look!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
And she pulled out fistfuls of Cards from inside her robes and threw them into the air. Then she turned into Hermione, who said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote

And Harry was protesting that he could not give Cho his Firebolt, because Umbridge had it, and anyway the whole thing was ridiculous, he\rquote d only come to the DA room to put up some Christmas baubles shaped like Dobby\rquote s head ...
\par The dream changed ...
\par His body felt smooth, powerful and flexible. He was gliding between shining metal bars, across dark, cold stone ... he was flat against the floor, sliding along on his belly ... it was dark, yet he could see objects around him shimmering in 
strange, vibrant colours ... he was turning his head ... at first glance the corridor was empty ... but no ... a man was sitting on the floor ahead, his chin drooping on to his chest, his outline gleaming in the dark ...
\par Harry put out his tongue ... he tasted the man\rquote s scent on the air ... he was alive but drowsy ... sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor ...
\par Harry longed to bite the man ... but he must master the impulse ... he had more important work to do ...
\par But the man was stirring ... a silver Cloak fell from his legs as he jumped to his feet; and Harry saw his vibrant, blurred outline tow\-
ering above him, saw a wand withdrawn from a belt ... he had no choice ... he reared high from the floor and struck once, twice, three times, plunging his fangs deeply into the man\rquote 
s flesh, feeling his ribs splinter beneath his jaws, feeling the warm gush of blood ...
\par The man was yelling in pain ... then he fell silent ... he slumped backwards against the wall ... blood was splattering on to the floor ...
\par His forehead hurt terribly ... it was aching fit to burst ...
\par \lquote Harry! HARRY!\rquote 
\par He opened his eyes. Every inch of his body was covered in icy sweat; his bed covers were twisted all around him like a strait-jacket; he felt as though a white-hot poker were being applied to his forehead.

\par \lquote Harry, mate,\rquote  said Ron uncertainly, \lquote you ... you were just dreaming ...\rquote 
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Harry furiously; it was crucial that Ron understand. \lquote It wasn\rquote t a dream ... not an ordinary dream ... I was there, I saw it ... I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par He could hear Seamus and Dean muttering but did not care. The pain in his forehead was subsiding slightly, though he was still sweating and shivering feverishly. He retched again and Ron leapt backwards out of the way.
\par \lquote Harry, you\rquote re not well,\rquote  he said shakily. \lquote Neville\rquote s gone for help.\rquote

\par He tried to get out of bed but Ron pushed him back into it; Dean and Seamus were still whispering somewhere nearby. Whether one minute passed or ten, Harry did not know; he simply sat 
there shaking, feeling the pain recede very slowly from his scar ... then there were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs and he heard Neville\rquote s voice again.
\par \lquote Over here, Professor.\rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in her tartan dressing gown, her glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her bony nose.
\par \lquote What is it, Potter? Where does it hurt?\rquote 
\par He had never been so pleased to see her; it was a member of the Order of the Phoenix he needed now, not someone fussing over him and prescribing useless potions.
\par \lquote It\rquote s Ron\rquote s dad,\rquote  he said, sitting up again. \lquote He\rquote s been attacked by a snake and it\rquote s serious, I saw it happen.\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you mean, you saw it happen?\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, her dark eyebrows contracting.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know ... I was asleep and then I was there ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You mean you dreamed this?\rquote 
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Harry angrily; would none of them understand? \lquote I was having a dream at first about something completely different, some\-thing stupid ... and then this interrupted it. It was real, I didn\rquote 
t imagine it. Mr Weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a gigantic snake, there was a load of blood, he collapsed, someone\rquote s got to find out where he is ...\rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall was gazing at him through her lopsided spectacles as though horrified at what she was seeing.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not lying and I\rquote m not mad!\rquote  Harry told her, his voice rising to a shout. \lquote I tell you, I saw it happen!\rquote 
\par \lquote I believe you, Potter,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall curtly. \lquote Put on your dressing gown \endash  we\rquote re going to see the Headmaster.\rquote

\par They followed Professor McGonagall past the silent figures of Neville, Dean and Seamus, out of the dormitory, down the spiral stairs into the common room, through the portrait hole and off along the Fat Lady\rquote 
s moonlit corridor. Harry felt as though the panic inside him might spill over at any moment; he wanted to run, to yell for Dumbledore; Mr Weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately, and what if those fangs (Harry tried hard not to think 
\lquote my fangs\rquote ) had been poisonous? They passed Mrs Norris, who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly, but Professor McGonagall said, \lquote Shoo!\rquote 
 Mrs Norris slunk away into the shadows, and in a few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore\rquote s office.
\par \lquote Fizzing Whizzbee,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall.
\par The gargoyle spran
g to life and leapt aside; the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continually upwards like a spiral escalator. The three of them stepped on to the moving stairs; the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were mo
ving upwards in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin.
\par Though it was now well past midnight there were voices coming from inside the room, a positive babble of them. It sounded as though Dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people.
\par Professor McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off. The door opened of its own accord and Professor McGonagall led Harry and Ron inside.
\par The room was in half-darkness; the strange silver instruments standing o
n tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did; the portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snooz\-
ing in their frames. Behind the door, a magnificent red and gold bird the size of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing.
\par \lquote Oh, it\rquote s you, Professor McGonagall ... and ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 ah.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Dumbledore was sitting in a high-backed chair behind his desk; he leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him. He was wearing a magnificently embroi\-dered purple and gold dressing gown over a snowy white night
\-shirt, but seemed wide-awake, his penetrating light blue eyes fixed intently upon Professor McGonagall.
\par \lquote Professor Dumbledore, Potter has had a ... well, a nightmare,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote He says ...\rquote 
\par \lquote It wasn\rquote t a nightmare,\rquote  said Harry quickly.
\par Professor McGonagall looked round at Harry, frowning slightly.
\par \lquote Very well, then, Potter, you tell the Headmaster about it.\rquote 
\par \lquote I ... well, I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 was}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148  asleep ...\rquote 
 said Harry and, even in his terror and his desperation to make Dumbledore understand, he felt slightly irritated that the Headmaster was not looking at him, but exam\-ining his own interlocked fingers. \lquote But it wasn\rquote t an ordinary dream ... i
t was real ... I saw it happen ...\rquote  He took a deep breath, \lquote Ron\rquote s dad \endash  Mr Weasley \endash  has been attacked by a giant snake.\rquote 
\par The words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them, sounding slightly ridiculous, even comic. There was a pause in whic
h Dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling. Ron looked from Harry to Dumbledore, white-faced and shocked.
\par \lquote How did you see this?\rquote  Dumbledore asked quietly, still not looking at Harry.
\par \lquote Well ... I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Harry, rather angrily \endash  what did it matter? \lquote Inside my head, I suppose \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You misunderstand me,\rquote  said Dumbledore, still in the same calm tone. \lquote I mean ... can you remember \endash  er \endash  where you were posi\-tioned as you watched this attack happen? Were you perhaps standing beside th
e victim, or else looking down on the scene from above?\rquote 
\par This was such a curious question that Harry gaped at Dumbledore; it was almost as though he knew ...
\par \lquote I was the snake,\rquote  he said. \lquote I saw it all from the snake\rquote s point of view.\rquote 
\par Nobody else spoke for a moment, then Dumbledore, now looking at Ron who was still whey-faced, asked in a new and sharper voice, \lquote Is Arthur seriously injured?\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Yes,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said Harry emphatically \endash 
 why were they all so slow on the uptake, did they not realise how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side? And why could Dumbledore not do him the courtesy of looking at him?
\par But Dumbledore stood up, so quickly it made Harry jump, and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling. \lquote Everard?\rquote  he said sharply. \lquote And you too, Dilys!\rquote 
\par A sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him, both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps, opened their eyes immediately.
\par \lquote You were listening?\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par The wizard nodded; the witch said, \lquote Naturally.\rquote 
\par \lquote The man has red hair and glasses,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Everard, you will need to raise the alarm, make sure he is found by the right people \endash \rquote 
\par Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead of emerging in neighbouring pictures (as usually happened at Hogwarts) neither reappeared. One frame now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain, the other a handsome leather arm\-
chair. Harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mis\-tresses on the walls, though snoring and drooling most convincingly, kept sneaking peeks at him from under their eyelids, and he sud\-
denly understood who had been talking when they had knocked.
\par \lquote Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts\rquote s most celebrated Heads,\rquote  Dumbledore said, now sweeping around Harry, Ron and Professor McGonagall to approach the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door. \lquote 
Their renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other important wizarding institutions. As they are free to move between their own portraits, they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere ...\rquote 
\par \lquote But Mr Weasley could be anywhere!\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Please sit down, all three of you,\rquote  said Dumbledore, as though Harry had not spoken, \lquote Everard and Dilys may not be back for several minutes. Professor McGonagall, if you could draw up extra chairs.\rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air, straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured up at Harry\rquote 
s hearing. Harry sat down, watching Dumbledore over his shoulder. Dumble\-dore was now stroking Fawkes\rquote s plumed golden head with one finger. The phoenix awoke immediately. He stretched his beau\-
tiful head high and observed Dumbledore through bright, dark eyes.
\par \lquote We will need,\rquote  Dumbledore said very quietly to the bird, \lquote a warning.\rquote 
\par There was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone.
\par Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function Harry had never known, carried it over to his desk, sat down facing them again and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand.
\par The instrument tinkled into life at once wit
h rhythmic clinking noises. Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top. Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow furrowed. After a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and co
iled in the air ... a serpent\rquote s head grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide. Harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story: he looked eagerly at Dumbledore for a sign that he was right, but Dumbledore did not look up.

\par \lquote Naturally, naturally,\rquote  murmured Dumbledore apparently to him\-self, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise. \lquote But in essence divided?\rquote 
\par Harry could make neither head nor tail of this question. The smoke serpent, however, split itself instantly into two snakes, both coiling and undulating in the dark air. With a look of grim satis\-
faction, Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand: the clinking noise slowed and died and the smoke ser\-pents grew faint, became a formless haze and vanished.
\par Dumbledore replaced the instrument on its spindly little table. Harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes, then, realising that Harry was watching them, hastily pretend to be sleeping again. 
Harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for, but before he could do so, there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his portrait, panting slightly.
\par \lquote Dumbledore!\rquote 
\par \lquote What news?\rquote  said Dumbledore at once.
\par \lquote I yelled until someone came running,\rquote  said the wizard, who was mopping his brow on the curtain behind him, \lquote said I\rquote d heard some\-thing moving downstairs \endash  they weren\rquote 
t sure whether to believe me but went down to check \endash  you know there are no portraits down there to watch from. Anyway, they carried him up a few minutes later. He doesn\rquote t look good, he\rquote s covered in blood, I ran along to Elfrida Cragg
\rquote s portrait to get a good view as they left \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Good,\rquote  said Dumbledore as Ron made a convulsive movement. \lquote I take it Dilys will have seen him arrive, then \endash \rquote 
\par And moments later, the silver-ringleted witch had reappeared in her picture, too; she sank, coughing, into her armchair and said, \lquote Yes, they\rquote ve taken him to St Mungo\rquote s, Dumbledore ... they car\-
ried him past my portrait ... he looks bad ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote  said Dumbledore. He looked round at Professor McGonagall.
\par \lquote Minerva, I need you to go and wake the other Weasley children.\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course ...\rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door. Harry cast a sideways glance at Ron, who was looking terrified.
\par \lquote And Dumbledore \endash  what about Molly?\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, pausing at the door.
\par \lquote That will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote But she may already know ... that excellent clock of hers ...\rquote 
\par Harry knew Dumbledore was referring to the clock that told, not the time, but the whereabouts and conditions of the various Weasley family members, and with a pang he thought that Mr Weasley\rquote s hand must, even now, be pointing at }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 mortal peril. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
But it was very late. Mrs Weasley was probably asleep, not watching the clock. Harry felt cold as he remembered Mrs Weasley\rquote s Boggart turning into Mr Weasley\rquote s lifeless body, his glasses aske
w, blood running down his face ... but Mr Weasley wasn\rquote t going to die ... he couldn\rquote t ...
\par Dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind Harry and Ron. He emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle, which he placed carefully on his desk. He raised his wand and murmured, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Portus!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
For a moment the kettle trembled, glowing with an odd blue light; then it quivered to rest, as solidly black as ever.
\par Dumbledore marched over to another portrait, this time of a clever-looking wizard with a pointed beard, who had been painted wearing the Slytherin colours of green and silver and was appar\-ently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear Dumbledore
\rquote s voice when he attempted to rouse him.
\par \lquote Phineas. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Phineas.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par The subjects of the portraits lining the room were no
 longer pretending to be asleep; they were shifting around in their frames, the better to watch what was happening. When the clever-looking wizard continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his name, too.
\par \lquote Phineas! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Phineas! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 PHINEAS!\rquote 
\par He could not pretend any longer; he gave a theatrical jerk and opened his eyes wide.
\par \lquote Did someone call?\rquote 
\par \lquote I need you to visit your other portrait again, Phineas,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I\rquote ve got another message.\rquote 
\par \lquote Visit my other portrait?\rquote  said Phineas in a reedy voice, giving a long, fake yawn (his eyes travelling around the room and focusing on Harry). \lquote Oh, no, Dumbledore, I am too tired tonight.\rquote 
\par Something about Phineas\rquote s voice was familiar to Harry, where had he heard it before? But before he could think, the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest.
\par \lquote Insubordination, sir!\rquote  roared a corpulent, red-nosed wizard, brandishing his fists. \lquote Dereliction of duty!\rquote 
\par \lquote We are honour-bound to give service to the present Headmaster of Hogwarts!\rquote  cried a frail-looking old wizard whom Harry recog\-nised as Dumbledore\rquote s predecessor, Armando Dippet. \lquote Shame on you, Phineas!\rquote 
\par \lquote Shall I persuade him, Dumbledore?\rquote  called a gimlet-eyed witch, raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod.
\par \lquote Oh, very }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 well,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing the wand with mild apprehension, \lquote though he may well have destroyed my picture by now, he\rquote s done away with most of the family \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,\rquote  said Dumbledore, and Harry realised immediately where he had heard Phineas\rquote s voice before: issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place. \lquote 
You are to give him the message that Arthur Weasley has been gravely injured and that his wife, children and Harry Potter will be arriving at his house shortly. Do you understand?\rquote 
\par \lquote Arthur Weasley, injured, wife and children and Harry Potter coming to stay,\rquote  recited Phineas in a bored voice. \lquote Yes, yes ... very well ...\rquote 
\par He sloped away into the frame of the portrait 
and disappeared from view at the very moment the study door opened again. Fred, George and Ginny were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall, all three of them looking dishevelled and shocked, still in their night things.
\par \lquote Harry \endash  what\rquote s going on?\rquote  asked Ginny, who looked frightened. \lquote Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad get hurt \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order of the Phoenix,\rquote  said Dumbledore, before Harry could speak. \lquote He has been taken to St Mungo\rquote s Hospital for 
Magical Maladies and Injuries. I am sending you back to Sirius\rquote s house, which is much more convenient for the hospital than The Burrow. You will meet your mother there.\rquote 
\par \lquote How\rquote re we going?\rquote  asked Fred, looking shaken. \lquote Floo powder?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote Floo powder is not safe at the moment, the Network is being watched. You will be taking a Portkey.\rquote  He indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk. \lquote 
We are just waiting for Phineas Nigellus to report back ... I want to be sure that the coast is clear before sending you \endash \rquote 
\par There was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office, leaving behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor.
\par \lquote It is Fawkes\rquote s warning,\rquote  said Dumbledore, catching the feather as it fell. \lquote Professor Umbridge must know you\rquote re out of your beds ... Minerva, go and head her off \endash  tell her any story \endash \rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan.
\par \lquote He says he\rquote ll be delighted,\rquote  said a bored voice behind Dumbledore; the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his Slytherin banner. \lquote My great-great-grandson has always had an odd taste in house-guests.\rquote 
\par \lquote Come here, then,\rquote  Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys. \lquote And quickly, before anyone else joins us.\rquote 
\par Harry and the others gathered around Dumbledore\rquote s desk.
\par \lquote You have all used a Portkey before?\rquote  asked Dumbledore, and they nodded, each reaching out to touch some part of the black\-ened kettle. \lquote Good. On the count of three, then ... one ... two ...\rquote 
\par It happened in a fraction of a second: in the infinitesimal pause before Dumbledore said \lquote three\rquote , Harry looked up at him \endash  they were very close together \endash  and Dumbledore\rquote s clear blue gaze moved from the Portkey to Harry
\rquote s face.
\par At once, Harry\rquote s scar burned white-hot, as though the old wound had burst open again \endash 
 and unbidden, unwanted, but terrifyingly strong, there rose within Harry a hatred so powerful he felt, for that instant, he would like nothing better than to strike \endash  to bite \endash  to sink his fangs into the man before him \endash 
\par \lquote ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 three.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Harry felt a powerful jerk behind his navel, the ground van\-
ished from beneath his feet, his hand was glued to the kettle; he was banging into the others as they all sped forwards in a swirl of colours and a rush of wind, the kettle pulling them onwards ... until his feet hi
t the ground so hard his knees buckled, the kettle clattered to the ground, and somewhere close at hand a voice said:
\par \lquote Back again, the blood-traitor brats. Is it true their father\rquote s dying?\rquote 
\par \lquote OUT!\rquote  roared a second voice.
\par Harry scrambled to his feet and look
ed around; they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve, Grimmauld Place. The only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle, which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper. Kreacher was disappearing through the door 
to the hall, looking back at them malevolently as he hitched up his loincloth; Sirius was hurry\-ing towards them all, looking anxious. He was unshaven and still in his day clothes; there was also a slightly Mundungus-like whiff of stale drink about him.

\par \lquote What\rquote s going on?\rquote  he said, stretching out a hand to help Ginny up. \lquote Phineas Nigellus said Arthur\rquote s been badly injured \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ask Harry,\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote Yeah, I want to hear this for myself,\rquote  said George.
\par The twins and Ginny were staring at him. Kreacher\rquote s footsteps had stopped on the stairs outside.
\par \lquote It was \endash \rquote  Harry began; this was even worse than telling McGonagall and Dumbledore. \lquote I had a \endash  a kind of \endash  vision ...\rquote 
\par And he told them all that he had seen, though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the side\-lines as the snake attacked, rather than from behind the snake\rquote 
s own eyes. Ron, who was still very white, gave him a fleeting look, but did not speak. When Harry had finished, Fred, George and Ginny continued to stare at 
him for a moment. Harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not, but he fancied there was some\-
thing accusatory in their looks. Well, if they were going to blame him just for seeing the attack, he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the snake at the time.
\par \lquote Is Mum here?\rquote  said Fred, turning to Sirius.
\par \lquote She probably doesn\rquote t even know what\rquote s happened yet,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote The important thing was to get you away before Umbridge could interfere. I expect Dumbledore\rquote s letting Molly know now.\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote ve got to go to St Mungo\rquote s,\rquote  said Ginny urgently. She looked around at her brothers; they were of course still in their pyjamas. \lquote Sirius, can you lend us cloaks or anything?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hang on, you can\rquote t go tearing off to St Mungo\rquote s!\rquote  said Sirius.
\par \lquote Course we can go to St Mungo\rquote s if we want,\rquote  said Fred, with a mulish expression. \lquote He\rquote s our dad!\rquote 
\par \lquote And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know?\rquote 
\par \lquote What does that matter?\rquote  said George hotly.
\par \lquote It matters because we don\rquote t want to draw attention to the fact that Harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles away!\rquote  said Sirius angrily. \lquote 
Have you any idea what the Ministry would make of that information?\rquote 
\par Fred and George looked as though they could not care less what the Ministry made of anything. Ron was still ashen-faced and silent.
\par Ginny said, \lquote Somebody else could have told us ... we could have heard it somewhere other than Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Like who?\rquote  said Sirius impatiently. \lquote Listen, your dad\rquote 
s been hurt while on duty for the Order and the circumstances are fishy enough without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened, you could seriously damage the Order\rquote s \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We don\rquote t care about the dumb Order!\rquote  shouted Fred.

\par \lquote Easy for you to say, stuck here!\rquote  bellowed Fred. \lquote I don\rquote t see you risking your neck!\rquote 
\par The little colour remaining in Sirius\rquote s face drained from it. He looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit Fred, but when he spoke, it was in a voice of determined calm.
\par \lquote I know it\rquote s hard, but we\rquote ve all got to act as though we don\rquote t know anything yet. We\rquote ve got to stay put, at least until we hear from your mother, all right?\rquote 
\par Fred and George still looked mutinous. Ginny, h
owever, took a few steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it. Harry looked at Ron, who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and a shrug, and they sat down too. The twins glared at Sirius for another minute, then took seats either side of G

\par He raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying towards them out of the pantry, skidded along the table, scattering the debris of Sirius\rquote 
s meal, and stopped neatly in front of the six of them. They all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table.
\par Harry was only drin
king to have something to do with his hands. His stomach was full of horrible hot, bubbling guilt. They would not be here if it were not for him; they would all still be asleep in bed. And it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had en
sured that Mr Weasley was found, because there was also the inescapable business of it being he who had attacked Mr Weasley in the first place.

\par He put the bottle down a little harder than he meant to, a
nd it slopped over on to the table. No one took any notice. Then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them and, as they gave cries of shock, a scroll of parchment fell with a thud on to the table, accompanied by a single gold
en phoenix tail feather.
\par \lquote Fawkes!\rquote  said Sirius at once, snatching up the parchment. \lquote That\rquote s not Dumbledore\rquote s writing \endash  it must be a message from your mother \endash  here \endash \rquote 
\par He thrust the letter into George\rquote s hand, who ripped it open and read aloud: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Dad is still alive. I am setting out for St Mungo\rquote

\par George looked around the table.
\par \lquote Still alive ...\rquote he said slowly. \lquote But that makes it sound ...\rquote 
\par He did not need to finish the sentence. It sounded to Harry, too, as though Mr Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death. Still exceptionally pale, Ron stared at the back of his mother\rquote 
s letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him. Fred pulled the parchment out of George\rquote s h
ands and read it for himself, then looked up at Harry, who felt his hand shaking on his Butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling.
\par If Harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one, he could not remember it. Sirius suggested once, without any real conviction, that they all go to bed, but the Weasleys\rquote 
 looks of disgust were answer enough. They mostly sat in silence around the table, watching the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax, occasionally raisin
g a bottle to their lips, speaking only to check the time, to wonder aloud what was happening, and to reassure each other that if there was bad news, they would know straightaway, for Mrs Weasley must long since have arrived at St Mungo\rquote s.
\par Fred fell into a
 doze, his head lolling sideways on to his shoulder. Ginny was curled like a cat on her chair, but her eyes were open; Harry could see them reflecting the firelight. Ron was sitting with his head in his hands, whether awake or asleep it was impossible to 
tell. Harry and Sirius looked at each other every so often, intruders upon the family grief, waiting ... waiting ...
\par At ten past five in the morning by Ron\rquote s watch, the kitchen door swung open and Mrs Weasley entered the kitchen. She was extremely pale, but
 when they all turned to look at her, Fred, Ron and Harry half rising from their chairs, she gave a wan smile.
\par \lquote He\rquote s going to be all right,\rquote  she said, her voice weak with tired\-ness. \lquote He\rquote s sleeping. We can all go and see him later. Bill\rquote s sitting with him now; he\rquote s going to take the morning off work.\rquote 
\par Fred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face. George and Ginny got up, walked swiftly over to their mother and hugged her. Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his Butterbeer in one.
\par \lquote Breakfast!\rquote  said Sirius loudly and joyfully, jumping to his feet. \lquote Where\rquote s that accursed house-elf? Kreacher! KREACHER!\rquote 
\par But Kreacher did not answer the summons.
\par \lquote Oh, forget it, then,\rquote  muttered Sirius, counting the people in front of him. \lquote So, it\rquote s breakfast for \endash  let\rquote s see \endash  seven ... bacon and eggs, I think, and some tea, and toast \endash \rquote 
\par Harry hurried over to the stove to help. He did not want to intrude on the Weasleys\rquote  happiness and he dreaded the moment when Mrs Weasley would ask him to recount his vis
ion. However, he had barely taken plates from the dresser when Mrs Weasley lifted them out of his hands and pulled him into a hug.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know what would have happened if it hadn\rquote t been for you, Harry,\rquote  she said in a muffled voice. \lquote They might not have found Arthur for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to you he\rquote 
s alive and Dumbledore\rquote s been able to think up a good cover story for Arthur being where he was, you\rquote ve no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise, look at poor Sturgis ...\rquote 
\par Harry could hardly bear her gratitude, but fortunately she soon released him to turn to Sirius and thank him for looking after her children through the night. Sirius said he was very pleased to have been able to help, and hoped they would all sta
y with him as long as Mr Weasley was in hospital.
\par \lquote Oh, Sirius, I\rquote m so grateful ... they think he\rquote ll be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer ... of course, that might mean we\rquote re here for Christmas.\rquote 
\par \lquote The more the merrier!\rquote  said Sirius with such obvious sincerity that Mrs Weasley beamed at him, threw on an apron and began to help with breakfast.
\par \lquote Sirius,\rquote  Harry muttered, unable to stand it a moment longer. \lquote Can I have a quick word? Er \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 now?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par He walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed. Without preamble, Harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had, including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked Mr Weasley.
\par When he paused for breath, Sirius said, \lquote Did you tell Dumbledore this?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry impatiently, \lquote but he didn\rquote t tell me what it meant. Well, he doesn\rquote t tell me anything any more.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about,\rquote  said Sirius steadily.
\par \lquote But that\rquote s not all,\rquote  said Harry, in a voice only a little above a whisper. \lquote Sirius, I ... I think I\rquote m going mad. Back in Dumbledore\rquote

\par He could only see a sliver of Sirius\rquote s face; the rest was in dark\-ness.
\par \lquote It must have been the aftermath of the vision, that\rquote s all,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote You were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It wasn\rquote t that,\rquote  said Harry, shaking his head, \lquote it was like some\-thing rose up inside me, like there\rquote s a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 snake }{\rtlch\fcs1

Everyone but Harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping. He went up to the bedroom he and Ron had shared over the last few weeks of summer, but while Ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, Harry sat fully clothed, hunched against the cold m
etal bars of the bedstead, keeping himself deliberately uncom\-
fortable, determined not to fall into a doze, terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and wake to find that he had attacked Ron, or else slithered through the house after one of the others ...

When Ron woke up, Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too. Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating lunch, so they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St Mungo\rquote s. Everybody except Harry was riotously hap
py and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts. When Tonks and Mad-Eye turned up to escort them across London, they greeted them gleefully, laughing at the bowler hat Mad-Eye was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical e
ye and assuring him, truthfully, that Tonks, whose hair was short and bright pink again, would attract far less attention on the Underground.
\par Tonks was very interested in Harry\rquote s vision of the attack on Mr Weasley, something Harry was not remotely interested in discussing.
\par \lquote There isn\rquote t any }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Seer }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 blood in your family, is there?\rquote 
 she enquired curiously, as they sat side by side on a train rattling towards the heart of the city.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling insulted.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Tonks musingly, \lquote no, I suppose it\rquote s not really prophecy you\rquote re doing, is it? I mean, you\rquote re not seeing the future, you\rquote re seeing the present ... it\rquote s odd, isn\rquote 
t it? Useful, though ...\rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t answer; fortunately, they got out at the next stop, a stati
on in the very heart of London, and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow Fred and George to get between himself and Tonks, who was leading the way. They all followed her up the escalator, Moody clunking along at the back of the group, h
is bowler tilted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat, clutching his wand. Harry thought he sensed the concealed eye staring hard at him. Trying to avoid any more questions about his dream, he asked Mad-Eye where St Mungo
\rquote s was hidden.
\par \lquote Not far from here,\rquote 
 grunted Moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad store-lined street packed with Christmas shoppers. He pushed Harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind; Harry knew the eye was rolling in all dire
ctions under the tilted hat. \lquote Wasn\rquote t easy to find a good location for a hos\-pital. Nowhere in Diagon Alley was big enough and we couldn\rquote t have it underground like the Ministry \endash  wouldn\rquote 
t be healthy. In the end they managed to get hold of a building up here. Theory was, sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd.\rquote 
\par He seized Harry\rquote s shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets.
\par \lquote Here we go,\rquote  said Moody a moment later.
\par They had arrived outside a large, old-fashioned, red-brick department store called Purge & Dowse Ltd. The place had a shabby, miserable air; the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies with their wigs askew, st
anding at random and modelling fashions at least ten years out of date. Large signs on all the dusty doors read: \lquote Closed for Refurbishment\rquote 
. Harry distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed, \lquote It\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 never }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 open, that place ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Tonks, beckoning them towards a window dis\-playing nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy. Its false eyelashes were hanging off and it was modelling a green nylon pinafore dress. \lquote Everybody ready?\rquote 
\par They nodded, clustering around her. Moody gave Harry another shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy, her breath steaming up the glass. \lquote Wotcher,\rquote 
 she said, \lquote we\rquote re here to see Arthur Weasley.\rquote 
\par Harry thought how absurd it was for Tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking so quietly through a sheet of glass, with buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shoppers. Then he reminded himself that dummies couldn
\rquote t hear anyway. Next second, his mouth opened in shock as the dummy gave a tiny nod and beckoned with its jointed finger, and Tonks had seized Ginny and Mrs Weasley by the elbows, stepped right through the glass and vanished.
\par Fred, George and Ron stepped a
fter them. Harry glanced around at the jostling crowd; not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as those of Purge & Dowse Ltd; nor did any of them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in fr
ont of them.
\par \lquote C\rquote mon,\rquote  growled Moody, giving Harry yet another poke in the back, and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water, emerging quite warm and dry on the other side.
\par There was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space w
here she had stood. They were in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden chairs, some looking perfectly normal and perusing out-of-date copies of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Witch Weekly, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 others sporting gruesome disfigurem
ents such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests. The room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises: a sweaty-faced witch in the centre of the front row, who was fan
ning herself vig\-orously with a copy of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
kept letting off a high-pitched whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth; a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved and, with each clang, his head vibrated
 horribly so that he had to seize himself by the ears to hold it steady.
\par Witches and wizards in lime-green robes were walking up and down the rows, asking questions and making notes on clipboards like Umbridge\rquote s. Harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests: a wand and bone, crossed.
\par \lquote Are they doctors?\rquote  he asked Ron quietly.
\par \lquote Doctors?\rquote  said Ron, looking startled. \lquote Those Muggle nutters that cut people up? Nah, they\rquote re Healers.\rquote 
\par \lquote Over here!\rquote  called Mrs Weasley, above the renewed clanging of the warlock in the corner, and they followed her to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Well, I start bleeding like mad every time they try,\rquote  said Mr Weasley cheerfully, reaching across for his wand, which lay on his bedside cabinet, and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bedside to seat them all. \lquote 
It seems there was some rather unusual kind of poison in that snake\rquote s fangs that keeps wounds open. They\rquote re sure they\rquote ll find an antidote, though; they say they\rquote ve had much worse cases than
 mine, and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour. But that fellow over there,\rquote 
 he said, dropping his voice and nodding towards the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling. \lquote Bitten by a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par \lquote It\rquote s two weeks till full moon,\rquote  Mr Weasley reminded her quietly. They\rquote ve been talking to him this morning, the Healers, you know, trying to persuade him he\rquote ll be able to lead an almost normal life. I said to him 
\endash  didn\rquote t mention names, of course \endash  but I said I knew a werewolf personally, very nice man, who finds the condition quite easy to manage.\rquote

\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 shook it open again and said, \lquote I was just reading about Willy Widdershins\rquote s arrest when you arrived. You know Willy turned out to be behind those regurgi\-
tating toilets back in the summer? One of his jinxes backfired, the toilet exploded and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote When you say you were \'93on duty\'94,\rquote  Fred interrupted in a low voice, \lquote what were you doing?\rquote 
\par \lquote You heard your father,\rquote  whispered Mrs Weasley, \lquote we are not dis\-cussing this here! Go on about Willy Widdershins, Arthur.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, don\rquote t ask me how, but he actually got off the toilet charge,\rquote  said Mr Weasley grimly. \lquote I can only suppose gold changed hands \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You were guarding it, weren\rquote t you?\rquote  said George quietly. \lquote The weapon? The thing You-Know-Who\rquote s after?\rquote 
\par \lquote George, be quiet!\rquote  snapped Mrs Weasley.
\par \lquote Anyway,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, in a raised voice, \lquote this time Willy\rquote s been caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles and I don\rquote t think he\rquote ll be able to worm his way out of it because, according 
to this article, two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St Mungo\rquote s for emergency bone re-growth and memory modification. Just think of it, Muggles in St Mungo\rquote s! I wonder which ward they\rquote re in?\rquote 
\par And he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a sign\-post.
\par \lquote Didn\rquote t you say You-Know-Who\rquote s got a snake, Harry?\rquote  asked Fred, looking at his father for a reaction. \lquote A massive one? You saw it the night he returned, didn\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s enough,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley crossly. \lquote Mad-Eye and Tonks are outside, Arthur, they want to come and see you. And you lot can wait outside,\rquote  she added to her children and Harry. \lquote 
You can come and say goodbye afterwards. Go on.\rquote 
\par They trooped back into the corridor. Mad-Eye and Tonks went in and closed the door of the ward behind them. Fred raised his eyebrows.
\par \lquote Fine,\rquote  he said coolly, rummaging in his pockets, \lquote be like that. Don\rquote t tell us anything.\rquote 
\par \lquote Looking for these?\rquote  said George, holding out what looked like a tangle of flesh-coloured string.
\par \lquote You read my mind,\rquote  said Fred, grinning. \lquote Let\rquote s see if St Mungo\rquote s puts Imperturbable Charms on its ward doors, shall we?\rquote 
\par He and George disentangled the string and separated five Extendable Ears from each other. Fred and George handed them around. Harry hesitated to take one.
\par \lquote Go on, Harry, take it! You saved Dad\rquote s life. If anyone\rquote s got the right to eavesdrop on him, it\rquote s you.\rquote 
\par Grinning in spite of himself, Harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear as the twins had done.
\par \lquote OK, go!\rquote  Fred whispered.
\par The flesh-coloured strings wriggled like long skinny worms and snaked under the door. At first, Harry could hear nothing, then he jumped as he heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside him.
\par \lquote ... they searched the whole area but couldn\rquote t find the snake anywhere. It just seems to have vanished after it attacked you, Arthur ... but You-Know-Who can\rquote t have expected a snake to get in, can he?\rquote 
\par \lquote I reckon he sent it as a lookout,\rquote  growled Moody, \lquote \rquote cause he\rquote s not had any luck so far, has he? No, I reckon he\rquote s trying to get a clearer picture of what he\rquote s facing and if Arthur hadn\rquote 
t been there the beast would\rquote ve had a lot more time to look around. So, Potter says he saw it all happen?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. She sounded rather uneasy. \lquote You know, Dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for Harry to see something like this.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, well,\rquote  said Moody, \lquote there\rquote s something funny about the Potter kid, we all know that.\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore seemed worried about Harry when I spoke to him this morning,\rquote  whispered Mrs Weasley.
\par \lquote Course he\rquote s worried,\rquote  growled Moody. \lquote The boy\rquote s seeing things from inside You-Know-Who\rquote s snake. Obviously, Potter doesn\rquote t realise what that means, but if You-Know-Who\rquote s possessing him \endash 
\rquote 
\par Harry pulled the Extendable Ear out of his own, his heart ham\-mering very fast and heat rushing up his face. He looked around at the others. They were all staring at him, the strings still trailing from their ears, looking suddenly fearful.

\par Here, he began to pace up and down, past the two beds and Phineas Nigellus\rquote s empty picture frame, his brain teeming and seething with questions and ever more dreadful ideas.
\par How had he become a snake? Perhaps he was an Animagus ... no, he couldn\rquote t be, he would know ... perhaps }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Voldemort }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 was an Animagus ... yes, thought Harry, that would fit, he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 would }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 turn into a snake of course ... and when he\rquote s possessing me, then we both transform ... that still doesn\rquote t explain how I got to London and back to my bed in
 the space of about five minutes ... but then Voldemort\rquote s about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from Dumbledore, it\rquote s probably no problem at all to him to trans\-port people like that.
\par And then, with a terrible stab of panic, he thought, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 but this is insane \endash  if Voldemort\rquote s possessing me, I\rquote 
m giving him a clear view into the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now! He\rquote ll know who\rquote s in the Order and where Sirius is ... and I\rquote ve heard loads of stuff I shouldn\rquote t have, everything Sirius to
ld me the first night I was here ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par There was only one thing for it: he would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway. He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others, which would keep them safe over the holidays at least ... but no, that wouldn\rquote 
t do, there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to maim and injure. What if it was Seamus, Dean or Neville next time? He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigellus\rquote s empty frame. A leaden sensa\-
tion was settling in the pit of his stomach. He had no alternative: he was going to have to return to Privet Drive, cut himself off from other wizards entirely.
\par Well, if he had to do it, he thought, there was no point hanging around. Trying with all his might not to think how the Dursleys were goi
ng to react when they found him on their doorstep six months earlier than they had expected, he strode over to his trunk, slammed the lid shut and locked it, then glanced around auto\-matically for Hedwig before remembering that she was still at Hogwarts 
\endash  well, her cage would be one less thing to carry \endash  he seized one end of his trunk and had dragged it halfway towards the door when a snide voice said, \lquote Running away, are we?\rquote 
\par He looked around. Phineas Nigellus had appeared on the canvas of his portrait and was leaning against the frame, watching Harry with an amused expression on his face.
\par \lquote Not running away, no,\rquote  said Harry shortly, dragging his trunk a few more feet across the room.
\par \lquote I thought,\rquote  said Phineas Nigellus, stroking his pointed beard, \lquote that to belong in Gryffindor house you were supposed to be }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 brave? }{\rtlch\fcs1

It looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own house. We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid. For instance, given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s not my own neck I\rquote m saving,\rquote  said Harry tersely, tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in front of the door.
\par \lquote Oh, I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 see,\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148  said Phineas Nigellus, still stroking his beard,

\par Harry ignored him. His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus said lazily, \lquote I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par Harry spun round.
\par \lquote What is it?\rquote 
\par \lquote \'93Stay where you are.\'94\rquote 
\par \lquote I haven\rquote t moved!\rquote  said Harry, his hand still upon the doorknob. \lquote So what\rquote s the message?\rquote 
\par \lquote I have just given it to you, dolt,\rquote  said Phineas Nigellus smoothly. \lquote Dumbledore says, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \'93Stay where you are.\'94\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par \lquote Why?\rquote  said Harry eagerly, dropping the end of his trunk. Why does he want me to stay? What else did he say?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nothing whatsoever,\rquote  said Phineas Nigellus, raising a thin black eyebrow as though he found Harry impertinent.
\par Harry\rquote s temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass. He was exhausted, he was confused beyond measure, he had experienced terr
or, relief, then terror again in the last twelve hours, and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him!
\par \lquote So that\rquote s it, is it?\rquote  he said loudly. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote \'93Stay where you are\'94? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote You know,\rquote  said Phineas Nigellus, even more loudly than Harry, \lquote this is precisely why I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 loathed }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 being a teacher! Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about every\-
thing. Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there might be an excellent reason why the Headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every 
tiny detail of his plans to you? Have you never paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore\rquote 
s orders has never yet led you into harm? No. No, like all young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognise danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realise what the Dark Lord may be planning \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote He }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 is}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148  planning something to do with me, then?\rquote  said Harry swiftly.

\par \lquote Did I say that?\rquote  said Phineas Nigellus, idly examining his silk gloves. \lquote Now, if you will excuse me, I have better things to do than listen to adolescent agonising ... good-day to you.\rquote 
\par And he strolled to the edge of his frame and out of sight.
\par \lquote Fine, go then!\rquote  Harry bellowed at the empty frame. \lquote And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing!\rquote 
\par The empty canvas remained silent. Fuming, Harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of his bed, then threw himself face down on the moth-eaten covers, his eyes shut, his body heavy and aching.
\par He felt as though he had journeyed for miles and miles ... it seemed impossible that less than twenty-four hours ago Cho Chang had been approaching him under the mistletoe ... he was so tired ... he was scared to sleep ... yet he did not know how long he 
could fight it ... Dumbledore had told him to stay ... that must mean he was allowed to sleep ... but he was scared ... what if it happened again?
\par He was sinking into shadows ...
\par It was as though a film in his head had been waiting to start. He was walking down a deserted corridor towards a plain black door, past rough stone walls, torches, and an open doorway on to a flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left ...
\par He reached the black door but could not open it ... he stood gazing at it, desperate 
for entry ... something he wanted with all his heart lay beyond ... a prize beyond his dreams ... if only his scar would stop prickling ... then he would be able to think more clearly ...
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  said Ron\rquote s voice, from far, far away, \lquote Mum says dinner\rquote s ready, but she\rquote ll save you something if you want to stay in bed.\rquote 
\par Harry opened his eyes, but Ron had already left the room.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 He doesn\rquote t want to be on his own with me,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148  Harry thought. }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par He supposed none of them would want him there any more, now that they knew what was inside him.
\par He would not go down to dinner; he would not inflict his com\-pany on them. He turned over on to his other side and, after a while, dropped back off to sleep. He woke much later, in the early hours of th
e morning, his insides aching with hunger and Ron snoring in the next bed. Squinting around the room, he saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to Harry that Dumbledore had probably sent Phineas Nigellus to
 watch over him, in case he attacked somebody else.
\par The feeling of being unclean intensified. He half-wished he had not obeyed Dumbledore ... if this was how life was going to be for him in Grimmauld Place from now on, maybe he would be better off in Privet Drive after all.

Everybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas decorations. Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a good mood; he was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that he was to have company over Christmas
. Harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold drawing room where he was sitting alone, watching the sky growing whiter out\-
side the windows, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the 
opportunity to keep talking about him, as they were bound to be doing. When he heard Mrs Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime, he retreated further upstairs and ignored her.

 she said briskly, \lquote let\rquote s go to your bedroom, Ron\rquote s mum has lit a fire in there and she\rquote s sent up sandwiches.\rquote 
\par Harry followed her back to the second floor. When he entered the bedroom, he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them, sitting on Ron\rquote s bed.
\par \lquote I came on the Knight Bus,\rquote  said Hermione airily, pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak. \lquote Dumbledore told me w

\par \lquote Didn\rquote t work,\rquote  said George, helping himself to a Chocolate Frog. \lquote So Lupin took over. Best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast, I reckon.\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s that supposed to be, anyway?\rquote  asked Fred, squinting at Dobby\rquote s painting. \lquote Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s Harry!\rquote  said George, pointing at the back of the picture, \lquote says so on the back!\rquote 
\par \lquote Good likeness,\rquote  said Fred, grinning. Harry threw his new home\-work diary at him; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par They got up and dressed. They could hear the various inhabi\-tants of the house calling \lquote Merry Christmas\rquote  to one another. On their way downstairs they met Hermione.
\par \lquote Thanks for the book, Harry,\rquote  she said happily. \lquote I\rquote ve been wanting that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 New Theory of Numerology }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote No problem,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Who\rquote s that for, anyway?\rquote  he added, nod\-ding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying.
\par \lquote Kreacher,\rquote  said Hermione brightly.
\par \lquote It had better not be clothes!\rquote  Ron warned her. \lquote You know what Sirius said: Kreacher knows too much, we can\rquote t set him free!\rquote 
\par \lquote It isn\rquote t clothes,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote although if I had my way I\rquote d certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No, it\rquote s a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bed\-room.
\rquote 
\par \lquote What bedroom?\rquote  said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Sinus\rquote s mother.
\par \lquote Well, Sirius says it\rquote s not so much a bedroom, more a kind of \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 den,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said Hermione. \lquote Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen.\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there. She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she had a bad head cold as she wished them \lquote Merry Christmas\rquote , and they all averted their eyes.
\par \lquote So, is this Kreacher\rquote s bedroom?\rquote  said Ron, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry. Harry had never seen it open.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous. \lquote Er ... I think we\rquote d better knock.\rquote 
\par Ron rapped on the door with his knuckles but there was no reply.
\par \lquote He must be sneaking around upstairs,\rquote  he said, and without further ado pulled open the door. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Urgh!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Harry peered inside. Most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot of space under\-
neath the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest. A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets
 were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night. Here and there among the material were stale bread crusts and mouldy old bits of cheese. In a far corner glinted small objects and coins 
that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved, magpie-like, from Sirius\rquote 
s purge of the house, and he had also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer. Their glass might be shattered, but still the little 
black-and-white people inside them peered up at him haughtily, including \endash  he felt a little jolt in his stomach \endash  the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dumbledore\rquote 
s Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange. By the looks of it, hers was Kreacher\rquote s favourite photograph; he had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape.
\par \lquote I think I\rquote ll just leave his present here,\rquote  said Hermione, laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly. \lquote He\rquote ll find it later, that\rquote ll be fine.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Come to think of it,\rquote  said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carry\-ing a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door, \lquote has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately?\rquote 
\par \lquote I haven\rquote t seen him since the night we came back here,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote You were ordering him out of the kitchen.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ...\rquote  said Sirius, frowning. \lquote You know, I think that\rquote s the last time I saw him, too ... he must be hiding upstairs somewhere.\rquote 
\par \lquote He couldn\rquote t have left, could he?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I mean, when you said }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \'93out\'94, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 maybe he thought you meant get out of the house?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, no, house-elves can\rquote t leave unless they\rquote re given clothes. They\rquote re tied to their family\rquote s house,\rquote  said Sirius.
\par \lquote They can leave the house if they really want to,\rquote  Harry contra\-dicted him. \lquote Dobby did, he left the Malfoys\rquote  to give me warnings two years ago. He had to punish himself afterwards, but he still managed it.\rquote 
\par Sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment, then said, \lquote I\rquote ll look for him later, I expect I\rquote ll find him upstairs crying his eyes out over my mother\rquote 
s old bloomers or something. Of course, he might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died ... but I mustn\rquote t get my hopes up.\rquote 
\par Fred, George and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked reproachful.
\par Once they had eaten their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys, Harry and Hermione were planning to pay Mr Weasley another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye and Lupin. Mundungus turned up in time for Christmas pudding and trifle, having managed to \lquote borrow
\rquote  a car for the occasion, as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day. The car, which Harry doubted very much had been taken with the consent of its owner, had been enlarged with a spell like the Weasleys\rquote 
 old Ford Anglia had once been. Although normally proportioned outside, ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably. Mrs Weasley hesitated before getting inside \endash 
 Harry knew her disapproval of Mundungus was battling with her dislike of travelling without magic \endash  but, finally, the cold outside and her children\rquote 
s pleading triumphed, and she settled herself into the back seat between Fred and Bill with good grace.
\par The journey to St Mungo\rquote s was quite quick as there was very little traffic on the roads. A small trickle of witches
 and wizards was creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital. Harry and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them. They strolled casu\-
ally towards the window where the dummy in green nylon stood, then, one by one, stepped through the glass.
\par The reception area looked pleasantly festive: the crystal orbs that illuminated St Mungo\rquote s had been coloured red and gold to become gigantic, glowing Christmas baubles; holly hung around every 
doorway; and shining white Christmas trees covered in mag\-
ical snow and icicles glittered in every corner, each one topped with a gleaming gold star. It was less crowded than the last time they had been there, although halfway across the room Harry found h
imself shunted aside by a witch with a satsuma jammed up her left nostril.
\par \lquote Family argument, eh?\rquote  smirked the blonde witch behind the desk. \lquote You\rquote re the third I\rquote ve seen today ... Spell Damage, fourth floor.\rquote 
\par They found Mr Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his turkey dinner on a tray on his lap and a rather sheepish expression on his face.
\par \lquote Everything all right, Arthur?\rquote  asked Mrs Weasley, after they had all greeted Mr Weasley and handed over their presents.
\par \lquote Fine, fine,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, a little too heartily. \lquote You \endash  er \endash  haven\rquote t seen Healer Smethwyck, have you?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley suspiciously, \lquote why?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nothing, nothing,\rquote  said Mr Weasley airily, starting to unwrap his pile of gifts. \lquote Well, everyone had a good day? What did you all get for Christmas? Oh, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Harry \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 this is absolutely }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Mrs Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr Weasley\rquote s answer. As her husband leaned over to shake Harry\rquote s hand, she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt.
\par \lquote Arthur,\rquote  she said, with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap, \lquote you\rquote ve had your bandages changed. Why have you had your band\-ages changed a day early, Arthur? They told me they wouldn\rquote t need doing until tomorrow.
\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Mr Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his chest. \lquote No, no \endash  it\rquote s nothing \endash  it\rquote s \endash  I \endash \rquote 
\par He seemed to deflate under Mrs Weasley\rquote s piercing gaze.
\par \lquote Well \endash  now don\rquote t get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an idea ... he\rquote s t
he Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and very interested in ... um ... complementary medicine ... I mean, some of these old Muggle remedies ... well, they\rquote re called }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Mrs Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl. Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wist\-
fully at the crowd around Mr Weasley; Bill muttered something about getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him, grinning.
\par \lquote Do you mean to tell me,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover, \lquote that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not messing about, Molly, dear,\rquote  said Mr Weasley imploringly, \lquote it was just \endash  just something Pye and I thought we\rquote d try \endash  only, most unfortunately \endash  well, with these particular kinds of wounds \endash 
 it doesn\rquote t seem to work as well as we\rquote d hoped \endash \rquote

\par \lquote Well ... well, I don\rquote t know whether you know what \endash  what stitches are?\rquote 
\par \lquote It sounds as though you\rquote ve been trying to sew your skin back together,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter, \lquote but even you, Arthur, wouldn\rquote t be }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote I fancy a cup of tea, too,\rquote  said Harry, jumping to his feet.
\par Hermione, Ron and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him. As it swung closed behind them, they heard Mrs Weasley shriek, \lquote WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT\rquote S THE GENERAL IDEA?\rquote 
\par \lquote Typical Dad,\rquote  said Ginny, shaking her head as they set off up the corridor. \lquote Stitches ... I ask you ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,\rquote  said Hermione fairly. \lquote I suppose something in that snake\rquote s venom dissolves them or something. I wonder where the tearoom is?\rquote 
\par \lquote Fifth floor,\rquote  said Harry, remembering the sign over the welcomewitch\rquote s desk.
\par They walked along the corridor, through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutal-looking Healers. As
 they climbed it, the various Healers called out to them, diagnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible reme\-dies. Ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit.
\par \lquote And what\rquote s that supposed to be?\rquote  he asked angrily, as the Healer pursued him through six more portraits, shoving the occupants out of the way.
\par \lquote \rquote Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin, young master, that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Watch who you\rquote re calling gruesome!\rquote  said Ron, his ears turning red.
\par \lquote \endash  the only remedy is to take the liver of a toad, bind it tight about your throat, stand naked at the full moon in a barrel of eels\rquote  eyes \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I have not got spattergroit!\rquote 
\par \lquote But the unsightly blemishes upon your visage, young master \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote re freckles!\rquote  said Ron furiously. \lquote Now get back in your own picture and leave me alone!\rquote 
\par He rounded on the others, who were all keeping determinedly straight faces.
\par \lquote What floor\rquote s this?\rquote 
\par \lquote I think it\rquote s the fifth,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Nah, it\rquote s the fourth,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote one more \endash \rquote 
\par But as he stepped on to the landing he came to an abrupt halt, staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted SPELL DAMAGE. A man wa
s peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass. He had wavy blond hair, bright blue eyes and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth.
\par \lquote Blimey!\rquote  said Ron, also staring at the man.
\par \lquote Oh, my goodness,\rquote  said Hermione suddenly, sounding breath\-less. \lquote Professor Lockhart!\rquote 
\par Their ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher pushed open the doors and moved towards them, wearing a long lilac dressing gown.
\par \lquote Well, hello there!\rquote  he said. \lquote I expect you\rquote d like my autograph, would you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hasn\rquote t changed much, has he?\rquote  Harry muttered to Ginny, who grinned.
\par \lquote Er \endash  how are you, Professor?\rquote  said Ron, sounding slightly guilty. It had been Ron\rquote s malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor Lockhart\rquote s memory so badly that he had landed in St Mungo\rquote 
s in the first place, though as Lockhart had been attempting to per\-manently wipe Harry and Ron\rquote s memories at the time, Harry\rquote s sympathy was limited.
\par \lquote I\rquote m very well indeed, thank you!\rquote  said Lockhart exuberantly, pulling a rather battered peacock-feather quill from his pocket. \lquote Now, how many autographs would you like? I can do joined-up writing now, you know!\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  we don\rquote t want any at the moment, thanks,\rquote  said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry, who asked, \lquote Professor, should you be wander\-ing around the corridors? Shouldn\rquote t you be in a ward?\rquote 
\par The smile faded slowly from Lockhart\rquote s face. For a few moments he gazed intently at Harry, then he said, \lquote Haven\rquote t we met?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ... yeah, we have,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote You used to teach us at Hogwarts, remember?\rquote 
\par \lquote Teach?\rquote  repeated Lockhart, looking faintly unsettled. \lquote Me? Did I?\rquote 
\par And then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was rather alarming.
\par \lquote Taught you everything you know, I expect, did I? Well, how about those autographs, then? Shall we say a round dozen, you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out!\rquote 
\par But just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice called, \lquote Gilderoy, you naughty boy, where have you wandered off to?\rquote 
\par A motherly-looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor, smiling warmly at Harry and the others.
\par \lquote Oh, Gilderoy, you\rquote ve got visitors! How }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 lovely, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
and on Christmas Day, too! Do you know, he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 never }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
gets visitors, poor lamb, and I can\rquote t think why, he\rquote s such a sweetie, aren\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re doing autographs!\rquote  Gilderoy told the Healer with another glittering smile. \lquote They want loads of them, won\rquote t take no for an answer! I just hope we\rquote ve got enough photographs!\rquote 
\par \lquote Listen to him,\rquote  said the Healer, taking Lockhart\rquote s arm and beaming fondly at him as though he were a precocious two-year-old. \lquote 
He was rather well known a few years ago; we very much hope that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be starting to come back. Will you step this way? He\rquote 
s in a closed ward, you know, he must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas presents, the door\rquote s usually kept locked ... not that he\rquote s dangerous! But,\rquote  she lowered her voice to a whisper, \lquote he\rquote 
s a bit of a danger to himself, bless him ... doesn\rquote t know who he is, you see, wanders off and can\rquote t remember how to get back ... it }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 is }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 nice of you to have come to see him.\rquote 
\par \lquote Er,\rquote  said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, \lquote actually, we were just \endash  er \endash \rquote 
\par But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Ron\rquote s feeble mutter of \lquote going to have a cup of tea\rquote  trailed away into nothing\-ness. They looked at each other helplessly, then followed Lockhart and his Healer along the corridor.

\par \lquote Let\rquote s not stay long,\rquote  Ron said quietly.
\par The Healer pointed her wand at the door of the Janus Thickey Ward and muttered, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Alohomora.\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The door swung open and she led the way inside, keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoy\rquote s arm until she had settled him into an armchair beside his bed.
\par \lquote This is our long-term residents\rquote  ward,\rquote  she informed Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny in a low voice. \lquote 
For permanent spell damage, you know. Of course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck, we can produce some improvement. Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself; and we\rquote 
ve seen a real improvement in Mr Bode, he seems to be regaining the power of speech very well, though he isn\rquote t speaking any language we recognise yet. Well, I must finish giving out the Christmas presents, I\rquote ll leave you all to chat.\rquote 

\par Harry looked around. The ward bore unmistakeable signs of being a permanent home to its residents. They had many more personal effects around their beds than in Mr Weasley\rquote s ward; the wall around Gilderoy\rquote 
s headboard, for instance, was papered 
with pictures of himself, all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals. He had autographed many of them to himself in disjointed, childish writing. The moment he had been deposited in his chair by the Healer, Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photog
raphs towards him, seized a quill and started signing them all feverishly.
\par \lquote You can put them in envelopes,\rquote  he said to Ginny, throwing the signed pictures into her lap one by one as he finished them. \lquote I am not forgotten, you know, no, I still receive a very great deal of fan mail ... Gladys Gudgeon writes }{

 He paused, looking faintly puzzled, then beamed again and returned to his signing with renewed vigour. \lquote I suspect it is simply my good looks ...\rquote 
\par A sallow-skinned, mournful-looking wizard lay in the bed oppo\-
site staring at the ceiling; he was mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him. Two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur; Harry remembered something similar happening 
to Hermione during their second year, although fortunately the damage, in her case, had not been permanent. At the far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy.
\par \lquote Here you are, Agnes,\rquote  said the Healer brightly to the furry-faced woman, handing her a small pile of Christmas presents. \lquote See, not forgotten, are you? And your son\rquote s sent an owl to say he\rquote s visiting tonight, so that
\rquote s nice, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par Agnes gave several loud barks.
\par \lquote And look, Broderick, you\rquote ve been sent a pot plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy Hippogriff for each month; they\rquote ll brighten things up, won\rquote t they?\rquote 
 said the Healer, bustling along to the mumbling man, setting a rather ugly plant with long, swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her wand. \lquote And \endash  oh, Mrs Longbottom, are you leaving already?
\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s head spun round. The curtains had been drawn back from the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors we
re walking back down the aisle between the beds: a formidable-looking old witch wearing a long green dress, a moth-eaten fox fur and a pointed hat decorated with what was unmistakeably a stuffed vulture and, trailing behind her looking thoroughly depresse
d \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Neville.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par With a sudden rush of understanding, Harry realised who the people in the end beds must be. He cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that Neville could leave the ward unnoticed and unquestioned, but Ron had also looked 
up at the sound of the name \lquote Longbottom\rquote , and before Harry could stop him had called out, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Neville!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Neville jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly missed him.
\par \lquote It\rquote s us, Neville!\rquote  said Ron brightly, getting to his feet. \lquote Have you seen \endash ? Lockhart\rquote s here! Who\rquote ve you been visiting?\rquote 
\par \lquote Friends of yours, Neville, dear?\rquote  said Neville\rquote s grandmother graciously, bearing down upon them all.
\par Neville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world but here. A dull purple flush was creeping up his plump face and he was not making eye contact with any of them.
\par \lquote Ah, yes,\rquote  said his grandmother, glaring at Harry and sticking out a shrivelled, clawlike hand for him to shake. \lquote Yes, yes, I know who you are, of course. Neville speaks most highly of you.\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  thanks,\rquote  said Harry, shaking hands. Neville did not look at him, but stared at his own feet, the colour deepening in his face all the while.
\par \lquote And you two are clearly Weasleys,\rquote  Mrs Longbottom continued, proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn. \lquote Yes, I know your parents \endash  not well, of course \endash 
 but fine people, fine people ... and you must be Hermione Granger?\rquote 
\par Hermione looked rather startled that Mrs Longbottom knew her name, but shook hands all the same.
\par \lquote Yes, Neville\rquote s told me all about you. Helped him out of a few sticky spots, haven\rquote t you? He\rquote s a good boy,\rquote  she said, casting a sternly appraising look down her rather bony nose at Neville, \lquote but he hasn\rquote 
t got his father\rquote s talent, I\rquote m afraid to say.\rquote  And she jerked her head in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward, so that the stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Ron, looking amazed. (Harry wanted to stamp on Ron\rquote s foot, but that sort of thing is much harder to bring off unno\-ticed when you\rquote re wearing jeans rather than robes.) \lquote Is that your }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 dad }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 down the end, Neville?\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s this?\rquote  said Mrs Longbottom sharply. \lquote Haven\rquote t you told your friends about your parents, Neville?\rquote 
\par Neville took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling and shook his head. Harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone, but he could not think of any way of helping Neville out of the situation.
\par \lquote Well, it\rquote s nothing to be ashamed of!\rquote  said Mrs Longbottom angrily. \lquote You should be }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 proud, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Neville, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 proud! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 They didn
\rquote t give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them, you know!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not ashamed,\rquote  said Neville, very faintly, still looking any\-where but at Harry and the others. Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds.
\par \lquote Well, you\rquote ve got a funny way of showing it!\rquote  said Mrs Longbottom. \lquote My son and his wife,\rquote  she said, turning haughtily to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny, \lquote were tortured into insanity by You-Know-Who\rquote 
s followers.\rquote 
\par Hermione and Ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths. Ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of Neville\rquote s parents and looked mortified.
\par \lquote They were Aurors, you know, and very well respected within the wizarding community,\rquote  Mrs Longbottom went on. \lquote Highly gifted, the pair of them. I \endash  yes, Alice dear, what is it?\rquote 
\par Neville\rquote s mother had come edging down the ward in her night\-dress. She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in Moody\rquote s old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix. Her face was t
hin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge and her hair, which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made timid motions towards Neville, holding some\-
thing in her outstretched hand.
\par \lquote Again?\rquote  said Mrs Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. \lquote Very well, Alice dear, very well \endash  Neville, take it, whatever it is.\rquote 
\par But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his mother dropped an empty Drooble\rquote s Best Blowing Gum wrapper.
\par \lquote Very nice, dear,\rquote  said Neville\rquote s grandmother in a falsely cheery voice, patting his mother on the shoulder.
\par But Neville said quietly, \lquote Thanks, Mum.\rquote 
\par His mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to her\-self. Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he\rquote d ever found anything less funny in his life.
\par \lquote Well, we\rquote d better get back,\rquote  sighed Mrs Longbottom, drawing on long green gloves. \lquote Very nice to have met you all. Neville, put that wrapper in the bin, she must have given you enough of them to paper your bedroom by now.
\rquote 
\par But as they left, Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the sweet wrapper into his pocket.
\par The door closed behind them.
\par \lquote I never knew,\rquote  said Hermione, who looked tearful.
\par \lquote Nor did I,\rquote  said Ron rather hoarsely.
\par \lquote Nor me,\rquote  whispered Ginny.
\par They all looked at Harry.
\par \lquote I did,\rquote  he said glumly. \lquote Dumbledore told me but I promised I wouldn\rquote t tell anyone ... that\rquote s what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for, using the Cruciatus Curse on Neville\rquote 
s parents until they lost their minds.\rquote 
\par \lquote Bellatrix Lestrange did that?\rquote  whispered Hermione, horrified. \lquote That woman Kreacher\rquote s got a photo of in his den?\rquote 
\par There was a long silence, broken by Lockhart\rquote s angry voice.
\par \lquote Look, I didn\rquote t learn joined-up writing for nothing, you know!\rquote

Kreacher, it transpired, had been lurking in the attic. Sirius said he had found him up there, covered in dust, no doubt looking for more relics of the Black family t
o hide in his cupboard. Though Sirius seemed satisfied with this story, it made Harry uneasy. Kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on his reappearance, his bitter muttering had subsided somewhat and he submitted to orders more docilely than usual, thoug
h once or twice Harry caught the house-elf staring at him avidly, but always looking quickly away whenever he saw that Harry had noticed.

Harry did not mention his vague suspicions to Sirius, whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that Christmas was over. As the date of their departure back to Hogwarts drew nearer, he became more and more prone to what Mrs Weasley called \lquote 
fits of the sul\-lens\rquote , in which he would become taciturn and grumpy, often with\-drawing to Buckbeak\rquote s room for hours at a time. His g
loom seeped through the house, oozing under doorways like some noxious gas, so that all of them became infected by it.
\par Harry didn\rquote t want to leave Sirius again with only Kreacher for company; in fact, for the first time in his life, he was not looking forwa
rd to returning to Hogwarts. Going back to school would mean placing himself once again under the tyranny of Dolores Umbridge, who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in their absence; there was no Quidditch to look forward to now 
that he had been banned; there was every likeli\-hood that their burden of homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer; and Dumbledore remained as remote as ever. In fact, if it hadn\rquote 
t been for the DA, Harry thought he might have begged Sirius to let him leave Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place.
\par Then, on the very last day of the holidays, something happened that made Harry positively dread his return to school.
\par \lquote Harry, dear,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, poking her head into his and Ron\rquote s bedroom, where the pair of them were playing wizard chess watched by Hermione, Ginny and Crookshanks, \lquote 
could you come down to the kitchen? Professor Snape would like a word with you.\rquote 
\par Harry did not immediately register what she had said; one of his castles was engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of Ron\rquote s and he was egging it on enthusiastically.
\par \lquote Squash him \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 squash him, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 he\rquote 
s only a pawn, you idiot. Sorry, Mrs Weasley, what did you say?\rquote 
\par \lquote Professor Snape, dear. In the kitchen. He\rquote d like a word.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s mouth fell open 
in horror. He looked around at Ron, Hermione and Ginny, all of whom were gaping back at him. Crookshanks, whom Hermione had been restraining with difficulty for the past quarter of an hour, leapt gleefully on to the board and set the pieces running for co
ver, squealing at the top of their voices.
\par \lquote Snape?\rquote  said Harry blankly.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Professor }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Snape, dear,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley reprovingly. \lquote 
Now come on, quickly, he says he can\rquote t stay long.\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s he want with you?\rquote  said Ron, looking unnerved as Mrs Weasley withdrew from the room. \lquote You haven\rquote t done anything, have you?\rquote 
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Harry indignantly, racking his brains to think what he could have done that would make Snape pursue him to Grimmauld Place. Had his last piece of homework perhaps earned a \lquote T\rquote ?
\par A minute or tw
o later, he pushed open the kitchen door to find Sirius and Snape both seated at the long kitchen table, glaring in opposite directions. The silence between them was heavy with mutual dislike. A letter lay open on the table in front of Sirius.
\par \lquote Er,\rquote  said Harry, to announce his presence.
\par Snape looked around at him, his face framed between curtains of greasy black hair.
\par \lquote Sit down, Potter.\rquote 
\par \lquote You know,\rquote  said Sirius loudly, leaning back on his rear chair legs and speaking to the ceiling, \lquote I think I\rquote d prefer it if you didn\rquote t give orders here, Snape. It\rquote s my house, you see.\rquote 
\par An ugly flush suffused Snape\rquote s pallid face. Harry sat down in a chair beside Sirius, facing Snape across the table.
\par \lquote I was supposed to see you alone, Potter,\rquote  said Snape, the familiar sneer curling his mouth, \lquote but Black \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m his godfather,\rquote  said Sirius, louder than ever.
\par \lquote I am here on Dumbledore\rquote s orders,\rquote  said Snape, whose voice, by contrast, was becoming more and more quietly waspish, \lquote but by all means stay, Black, I know you like to feel ... involved.\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s that supposed to mean?\rquote  said Sirius, letting his chair fall back on to all four legs with a loud bang.
\par \lquote Merely that I am sure you must feel \endash  ah \endash  frustrated by the fact that you can do nothing }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 useful,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Snape laid a delicate stress on the word, \lquote for the Order.\rquote 
\par It was Sirius\rquote s turn to flush. Snape\rquote s lip curled in triumph as he turned to Harry.
\par \lquote The Headmaster has sent me to tell you, Potter, that it is his wish for you to study Occlumency this term.\rquote 
\par \lquote Study what?\rquote  said Harry blankly.
\par Snape\rquote s sneer became more pronounced.
\par \lquote Occlumency, Potter. The magical defence of the mind against external penetration. An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful one.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s heart began to pump very fast indeed. Defence against external penetration? But he was not being possessed, they had all agreed on that ...
\par \lquote Why do I have to study Occlu\emdash  thing?\rquote  he blurted out.
\par \lquote Because the Headmaster thinks it a good idea,\rquote  said Snape smoothly. \lquote You will receive private lessons once a week, but you will not tell anybody what you are doing, least of all Dolores Umbridge. You understand?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Who\rquote s going to be teaching me?\rquote 
\par Snape raised an eyebrow.
\par \lquote I am,\rquote  he said.
\par Harry had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting. Extra lessons with Snape \endash  what on earth had he done to deserve this? He looked quickly round at Sirius for support.
\par \lquote Why can\rquote t Dumbledore teach Harry?\rquote  asked Sirius aggressively. \lquote Why you?\rquote 
\par \lquote I suppose because it is a headmaster\rquote s privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks,\rquote  said Snape silkily. \lquote I assure you I did not beg for the job.\rquote  He got to his feet. \lquote I will expect you at six o\rquote 
clock on Monday evening, Potter. My office. If anybody asks, you are taking remedial Potions. Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them.\rquote 
\par He turned to leave, his black travelling cloak billowing behind him.
\par \lquote Wait a moment,\rquote  said Sirius, sitting up straighter in his chair.
\par Snape turned back to face them, sneering.
\par \lquote I am in rather a hurry, Black. Unlike you, I do not have un\-limited leisure time.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll get to the point, then,\rquote  said Sirius, standing up. He was rather taller than Snape who, Harry noticed, balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what Harry was sure was the handle of his wand. \lquote If I hear you\rquote 
re using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time, you\rquote ll have me to answer to.\rquote 
\par \lquote How touching,\rquote  Snape sneered. \lquote But surely you have noticed that Potter is very like his father?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I have,\rquote  said Sirius proudly.
\par \lquote Well then, you\rquote ll know he\rquote s so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him,\rquote  Snape said sleekly.
\par Sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table towards Snape, pulling out his wand as he went. Snape whipped out his own. They were squaring up to each other, Sirius looking livid, Snape calculating, his eyes darting from Sirius\rquote 
s wand-tip to his face.
\par \lquote Sirius!\rquote  said Harry loudly, but Sirius appeared not to hear him.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve warned you, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Snivellus,\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
 said Sirius, his face barely a foot from Snape\rquote s, \lquote I don\rquote t care if Dumbledore thinks you\rquote ve reformed, I know better \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, but why don\rquote t you tell him so?\rquote  whispered Snape. \lquote Or are you afraid he might not take very seriously the advice of a man who has been hiding inside his mother\rquote s house for six months?\rquote 
\par \lquote Tell me, how is Lucius Malfoy these days? I expect he\rquote s delighted his lapdog\rquote s working at Hogwarts, isn\rquote t he?\rquote 
\par \lquote Speaking of dogs,\rquote  said Snape softly, \lquote did you know that Lucius Malfoy recognised you last time you risked a little jaunt outside? Clever idea, Black, getting yourse
lf seen on a safe station platform ... gave you a cast-iron excuse not to leave your hidey-hole in future, didn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par Sirius raised his wand.
\par \lquote NO!\rquote  Harry yelled, vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them. \lquote Sirius, don\rquote t!\rquote 
\par \lquote Are you calling me a coward?\rquote  roared Sirius, trying to push Harry out of the way, but Harry would not budge.
\par \lquote Why, yes, I suppose I am,\rquote  said Snape.
\par \lquote Harry \endash  get \endash  out \endash  of \endash  it!\rquote  snarled Sirius, pushing him aside with his free hand.
\par The kitchen door opened and the entire Weasley family, plus Hermione, came inside, all looking very happy, with Mr Weasley walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pyjamas covered by a mackintosh.
\par \lquote Cured!\rquote  he announced brightly to the kitchen at large. \lquote Com\-pletely cured!\rquote 
\par He and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold, gazing at the scene in front of them, which was also suspended in mid-action, both Sirius and Snape looking towards the door with their wands pointing into each other\rquote 
s faces and Harry immobile between them, a hand stretched out to each, trying to force them apart.
\par \lquote Merlin\rquote s beard,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, the smile sliding off his face, \lquote what\rquote s going on here?\rquote 
\par Both Sirius and Snape lowered their wands. Harry looked from one to the other. Each wore an expression
 of utmost contempt, yet the unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought them to their senses. Snape pocketed his wand and swept back across the kitchen, passing the Weasleys without comment. At the door he looked back.
\par \lquote Six o\rquote clock, Monday evening, Potter.\rquote 
\par And he was gone. Sirius glared after him, his wand at his side.
\par \lquote What\rquote s been going on?\rquote  asked Mr Weasley again.
\par \lquote Nothing, Arthur,\rquote  said Sirius, who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance. \lquote Just a friendly little chat between two old school friends.\rquote  With what looked like an enor\-mous effort, he smiled. \lquote 
So ... you\rquote re cured? That\rquote s great news, really great.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, leading her husband forward to a chair. \lquote Healer Smethwyck worked his magic in the end, found an antidote to whatever that snake\rquote s got in its fangs, and Arthur\rquote 
s learned his lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 haven\rquote t you, dear?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 she added, rather menacingly.
\par \lquote Yes, Molly, dear,\rquote  said Mr Weasley meekly.
\par That night\rquote s meal should have been a cheerful one, with Mr Weasley back amongst them. Harry could tell Sirius was trying to make it so, yet when his godfather was not forcing himself to laugh loudly at Fred and George\rquote 
s jokes or offering everyone more food, his face fell 
back into a moody, brooding expression. Harry was separated from him by Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to offer Mr Weasley their congratulations. He wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell him he shouldn\rquote 
t listen to a word Snape said, that Snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them didn\rquote 
t think Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in Grimmauld Place. But he had no opportunity to do so, and, eyeing the ugly look on Sirius\rquote s face, Harry wondered occa\-sional
ly whether he would have dared to mention it even if he had the chance. Instead, he told Ron and Hermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with Snape.
\par \lquote Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort,\rquote  said Hermione at once. \lquote Well, you won\rquote t be sorry not to have them any more, will you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Extra lessons with Snape?\rquote  said Ron, sounding aghast. \lquote I\rquote d rather have the nightmares!\rquote 
\par They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the fol\-lowing day, escorted once again by Tonks and Lupin, both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when Harry, Ron and Hermione came down next morning. The adults seemed to have been mid\-
way through a whispered conversation as Harry opened the door; all of them looked round hastily and fell silent.
\par After a hurried breakfast, they all pulled on jackets and scarves against the chilly grey January morning. Harry had an unpleasant constricted sensation in his chest; he did not want to say goodbye to Sirius. He had a bad feeling about this pa
rting; he didn\rquote t know when they would next see each other and he felt it was incum\-bent upon him to say something to Sirius to stop him doing any\-thing stupid \endash  Harry was worried that Snape\rquote 
s accusation of cowardice had stung Sirius so badly he might even now be plan\-ning some foolhardy trip beyond Grimmauld Place. Before he could think of what to say, however, Sirius had beckoned him to his side.
\par \lquote I want you to take this,\rquote  he said quietly, thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harry\rquote s hands.
\par \lquote What is it?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote A way of letting me know if Snape\rquote s giving you a hard time. No, don\rquote t open it in here!\rquote  said Sirius, with a wary look at Mrs Weasley, who was trying to persuade the twins to wear hand-knitted mittens. \lquote I 
doubt Molly would approve \endash  but I want you to use it if you need me, all right?\rquote 
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Harry, stowing the package away in the inside pocket of his jacket, but he knew he would never use whatever it was. It would not be he, Harry, who lured Sirius from
 his place of safety, no matter how foully Snape treated him in their forthcoming Occlumency classes.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s go, then,\rquote  said Sirius, clapping Harry on the shoulder and smiling grimly, and before Harry could say anything else, they were heading upstairs, stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front door, surrounded by Weasleys.

\par \lquote Goodbye, Harry, take care,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, hugging him.
\par \lquote See you, Harry, and keep an eye out for snakes for me!\rquote  said Mr Weasley genially, shaking his hand.
\par \lquote Right \endash  yeah,\rquote  said Harry distractedly; it was his last chance to tell Sirius to be careful; he turned, looked into his godfather\rquote 
s face and opened his mouth to speak, but before he could do so Sirius was giving him a brief, one-armed hug, and saying gruffly, \lquote Look after yourself, Harry.\rquote 
 Next moment, Harry found himself being shunted out into the icy winter air, with Tonks (today heavily dis\-guised as a tall, tweedy woman with iron-grey hair) chivvying him down the steps.
\par The door of number twelve slammed shut behind t
hem. They followed Lupin down the front steps. As he reached the pavement, Harry looked round. Number twelve was shrinking rapidly as those on either side of it stretched sideways, squeezing it out of sight. One blink later, it had gone.
\par \lquote Come on, the quicker we get on the bus the better,\rquote  said Tonks, and Harry thought there was nervousness in the glance she threw around the square. Lupin flung out his right arm.
\par BANG.
\par A violently purple, triple-decker bus had appeared out of thin air in front of them, narrowly avoiding the nearest lamppost, which jumped backwards out of its way.
\par A thin, pimply, jug-eared youth in a purple uniform leapt down on to the pavement and said, \lquote Welcome to the \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, yes, we know, thank you,\rquote  said Tonks swiftly. \lquote On, on, get on \endash \rquote 
\par And she shoved Harry forwards towards the steps, past the con\-ductor, who goggled at Harry as he passed.
\par \lquote \rquote Ere \endash  it\rquote s \rquote Arry \endash !\rquote 
\par \lquote If you shout his name I will curse you into oblivion,\rquote  muttered Tonks menacingly, now shunting Ginny and Hermione forwards.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve always wanted to go on this thing,\rquote  said Ron happily, joining Harry on board and looking around.
\par It had been evening the last time Harry had travelled by Knight Bus and its three decks had been full of brass bedsteads. Now, in the early morning, it was crammed with an assortment of mis\-
matched chairs grouped haphazardly around windows. Some of these appeared to have fallen over when the bus stopped abruptly in Grimmauld Place; a few witches and wizards were still get\-ting to their feet, grumbling, and somebody\rquote 
s shopping bag had slid the length of the bus: an unpleasant mixture of frogspawn, cockroaches and custard creams was scattered all over the floor.
\par \lquote Looks like we\rquote ll have to split up,\rquote  said Tonks briskly, looking around for empty chairs. \lquote Fred, George and Ginny, if you just take those seats at the back ... Remus can stay with you.\rquote 
\par She, Harry, Ron and Hermione proceeded up to the very top deck, where there were two unoccupied chairs at the very front of the bus and two at the back. Stan Shunpike, the conductor, fol\-
lowed Harry and Ron eagerly to the back. Heads turned as Harry passed and, when he sat down, he saw all the faces flick back to the front again.
\par As Harry and Ron handed Stan eleven Sickles each, the bus set off again, swaying ominously. It rumbled around Grimmauld Place, weaving on and off the pavement, then, with another tremendous BANG, they were all flung backwards; Ron\rquote 
s chair toppled right over and Pigwidgeon, who had been on his lap, burst out of his cage and flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where he fluttered down on to Hermione\rquote 
s shoulder instead. Harry, who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket, looked out of the window: they were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway.
\par \lquote Just outside Birmingham,\rquote  said Stan happily, answering Harry\rquote s unasked question as Ron struggled up from the floor. \lquote You keepin\rquote  well, then, \rquote 
Arry? I seen your name in the paper loads over the summer, but it weren\rquote t never nuffink very nice. I said to Ern, I said, \rquote e didn\rquote t seem like a nutter when we met \rquote im, just goes to show, dunnit?\rquote 
\par He handed over their tickets and continued to gaze, enthralled, at Harry. Apparently, Stan did not care how nutty somebody was, if they were famous enough to be in the paper. The Knight Bus 
swayed alarmingly, overtaking a line of cars on the inside. Looking towards the front of the bus, Harry saw Hermione cover her eyes with her hands, Pigwidgeon swaying happily on her shoulder.
\par BANG.
\par Chairs slid backwards again as the Knight Bus jumped from the Birmingham motorway to a quiet country lane full of hairpin bends. Hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of their way as they mounted the verges. From here they moved to a main 
street in the middle of a busy town, then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hills, then to a windswept road between high-rise flats, each time with a loud BANG.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve changed my mind,\rquote  muttered Ron, picking himself up from the floor for the sixth time, \lquote I never want to ride on this thing again.\rquote 
\par \lquote Listen, it\rquote s \rquote Ogwarts stop after this,\rquote  said Stan brightly, swaying towards them. \lquote That bossy woman up front \rquote oo got on with you, she\rquote s given us a little tip to move you up the queue. We\rquote 
re just gonna let Madam Marsh off first, though \endash \rquote  there was a retching sound from downstairs, followed by a horrible spattering noise \lquote \endash  she\rquote s not feeling \rquote er best.\rquote 
\par A few minutes later, the Knight Bus screeched to a halt outside a small pub, which squeezed itself out of the way to av
oid a collision. They could hear Stan ushering the unfortunate Madam Marsh out of the bus and the relieved murmurings of her fellow passengers on the second deck. The bus moved on again, gather\-ing speed, until \endash 
\par BANG.
\par They were rolling through a snowy Hogsmeade. Harry caught a glimpse of the Hog\rquote s Head down its side street, the severed boar\rquote 
s head sign creaking in the wintry wind. Flecks of snow hit the large window at the front of the bus. At last they rolled to a halt out\-side the gates to Hogwarts.
\par Lupin and Tonks helped them off the bus with their luggage, then got off to say goodbye. Harry glanced up at the three decks of the Knight Bus and saw all the passengers staring down at them, noses flat against the windows.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll be safe once you\rquote re in the grounds,\rquote  said Tonks, casting a careful eye around at the deserted road. \lquote Have a good term, OK?\rquote 
\par \lquote Look after yourselves,\rquote  said Lupin, shaking hands all round and reaching Harry last. \lquote And listen ...\rquote  he lowered his voice while the rest of them exchanged last-minute goodbyes with Tonks, \lquote Harry, I know you don\rquote 
t like Snape, but he is a superb Occlumens and we all \endash  Sirius included \endash  want you to learn to protect yourself, so work hard, all right?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, all right,\rquote  said Harry heavily, looking up into Lupin\rquote s pre\-maturely lined face. \lquote See you, then.\rquote 
\par The six of them struggled up the slippery drive towards the castle, dragging their trunks. Hermione was already talking about knitting a few elf hats before bedtime. Harry glanced back when they reached the oaken fr
ont doors; the Knight Bus had already gone and he half-wished, given what was coming the following evening, that he was still on board.

Harry spent most of the next day dreading the evening. His morning double-Potions lesson did nothing to dispel his tre
pidation, as Snape was as unpleasant as ever. His mood was further lowered by the DA members constantly approaching him in the corridors between classes, asking hopefully if there would be a meeting that night.

\par \lquote Shall I jinx him? I can still get him from here,\rquote  he said, raising his wand and taking aim between Smith\rquote s shoulder blades.

\par \lquote We\rquote ll be in the library, Harry,\rquote  said Hermione firmly as she seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off towards the marble stair\-case.
\par \lquote Had a good Christmas?\rquote  asked Cho.
\par \lquote Yeah, not bad,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Mine was pretty quiet,\rquote  said Cho. For some reason, she was looking rather embarrassed. \lquote Erm ... there\rquote s another Hogsmeade trip next month, did you see the notice?\rquote 
\par \lquote What? Oh, no, I haven\rquote t checked the noticeboard since I got back.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, it\rquote s on Valentine\rquote s Day ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry, wondering why she was telling him this. \lquote Well, I suppose you want to \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Only if you do,\rquote  she said eagerly.
\par Harry stared. He had been about to say, \lquote I suppose you want to know when the next DA meeting is?\rquote  but her response did not seem to fit.
\par \lquote I \endash  er \endash \rquote  he said.
\par \lquote Oh, it\rquote s OK if you don\rquote t,\rquote  she said, looking mortified. \lquote Don\rquote t worry. I \endash  I\rquote ll see you around.\rquote 
\par She walked away. Harry stood staring after her, his brain working frantically. Then something clunked into place.
\par \lquote Cho! Hey \endash  CHO!\rquote 
\par He ran after her, catching her halfway up the marble staircase.
\par \lquote Er \endash  d\rquote you want to come into Hogsmeade with me on Valentine\rquote s Day?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oooh, yes!\rquote  she said, blushing crimson and beaming at him.
\par \lquote Right ... well ... that\rquote s settled then,\rquote  said Harry, and feeling that the day was not going to be a complete loss after all, he virtually bounced off to the library to pick up Ron and Hermione before their afternoon lessons.
\par By six o\rquote clock that evening, however, even the glow of having suc\-cessfully asked out Cho Chang could not lighten the ominous feel\-ings that intensified with every step Harry took towards Snape\rquote s office.
\par He paused outside the door when he reached it, wishing he were almost anywhere else, then, taking a deep breath, he knocked and entered.
\par The shadowy room was lined with shelves bearing hundreds of glass jars in which slimy bits of animals and plants were suspended in variously coloured potions. In one corner stood the cupboard full of ingredients that Snape had once accused Harry \endash 
 not without reason \endash  of robbing. Harry\rquote s attention was drawn towards the desk, however, where a shallow stone basin engraved with runes and symbols lay in a pool of candlelight. Harry recognised it at once \endash  it was Dumbledore\rquote 
s Pensieve. Wondering what on earth it was doing there, he jumped when Snape\rquote s cold voice came out of the shadows.
\par \lquote Shut the door behind you, Potter.\rquote 
\par Harry did as he was told, with the horrible feeling that he was imprisoning himself. When he turned back into the room, Snape had moved into the light and w
as pointing silently at the chair opposite his desk. Harry sat down and so did Snape, his cold black eyes fixed unblinkingly upon Harry, dislike etched in every line of his face.
\par \lquote Well, Potter, you know why you are here,\rquote  he said. \lquote The Headmaster has asked me to teach you Occlumency. I can only hope that you prove more adept at it than at Potions.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry tersely.
\par \lquote This may not be an ordinary class, Potter,\rquote  said Snape, his eyes narrowed malevolently, \lquote but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me \'93sir\'94 or \'93Professor\'94 at all times.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 sir,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Now, Occlumency. As I told you back in your dear godfather\rquote s kitchen, this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intru\-sion and influence.\rquote 
\par \lquote And why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it, sir?\rquote  said Harry, looking directly into Snape\rquote s eyes and wondering whether Snape would answer.
\par Snape looked back at him for a moment and then said con\-temptuously, \lquote Surely even you could have worked that out by now, Potter? The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s that? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Sir?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \rquote 
\par \lquote It is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another person\rquote s mind \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He can read minds?\rquote  said Harry quickly, his worst fears con\-firmed.
\par \lquote You have no subtlety, Potter,\rquote  said Snape, his dark eyes glit\-tering. \lquote You do not understand fine distinctions. It is one of the shortcomings that makes you such a lamentable potion-maker.\rquote 
\par Snape paused for a moment, apparently to savour the pleasure of insulting Harry, before continuing.
\par \lquote Only Muggles talk of \'93mind-reading\'94. The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be perused by any invader. The mind is a complex and many-layered thing, Potter 
\endash  or at least, most minds are.\rquote  He smirked. \lquote It is true, however, that those who have mastered Legilimency are able, under certain conditions, to delve into the minds of their victims and to interpret their find\-
ings correctly. The Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to him. Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contra\-
dict the lie, and so can utter falsehoods in his presence without detection.\rquote 
\par Whatever Snape said, Legilimency sounded like mind-reading to Harry, and he didn\rquote t like the sound of it at all.
\par \lquote So he could know what we\rquote re thinking right now? Sir?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote 
Time and space matter in magic, Potter. Eye contact is often essential to Legilimency.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well then, why do I have to learn Occlumency?\rquote 
\par Snape eyed Harry, tracing his mouth with one long, thin finger as he did so.
\par \lquote The usual rules do not seem to apply with you, Potter. The curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the Dark Lord. The evidence sug\-gests that at times, when your mind is most relaxed and vulner\-
able \endash  when you are asleep, for instance \endash  you are sharing the Dark Lord\rquote s thoughts and emotions. The Headmaster thinks it inadvis\-able for this to continue. He wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark Lord.\rquote 

\par Harry\rquote s heart was pumping fast again. None of this added up.
\par \lquote But why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it?\rquote  he asked abruptly. \lquote I don\rquote t like it much, but it\rquote s been useful, hasn\rquote t it? I mean ... I saw that snake attack Mr Weasley and if I hadn\rquote t, Professor 
Dumbledore wouldn\rquote t have been able to save him, would he? Sir?\rquote 
\par Snape stared at Harry for a few moments, still tracing his mouth with his finger. When he spoke again, it was slowly and deliber\-ately, as though he weighed every word.
\par \lquote It appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the con\-
nection between you and himself until very recently. Up till now it seems that you have been experiencing his emotions, and sharing his thoughts, without his being any the wiser. However, the vision you had shortly before Christmas \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote The one with the snake and Mr Weasley?\rquote 
\par \lquote Do not interrupt me, Potter,\rquote  said Snape in a dangerous voice. \lquote As I was saying, the vision you had shortly before Christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon the Dark Lord\rquote s thoughts \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I saw inside the snake\rquote s head, not his!\rquote 
\par \lquote I thought I just told you not to interrupt me, Potter?\rquote 
\par But Harry did not care if Snape was angry; at last he seemed to be getting to the bottom of this business; he had moved forwards in his chair so that, without realising it, he was perched on the very edge, tense as though poised for flight.
\par \lquote How come I saw through the snake\rquote s eyes if it\rquote s Voldemort\rquote s thoughts I\rquote m sharing?\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Do not say the Dark Lord\rquote s name!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 spat Snape.
\par There was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the Pensieve.
\par \lquote Professor Dumbledore says his name,\rquote  said Harry quietly.
\par \lquote Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,\rquote  Snape muttered. \lquote While }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote I just wanted to know,\rquote  Harry began again, forcing his voice back to politeness, \lquote why \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You seem to have visited the snake\rquote s mind because that was where the Dark Lord was at that particular moment,\rquote  snarled Snape. \lquote He was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it, too.\rquote 
\par \lquote And Vol\emdash  he \endash  realised I was there?\rquote 
\par \lquote It seems so,\rquote  said Snape coolly.
\par \lquote How do you know?\rquote  said Harry urgently. \lquote Is this just Professor Dumbledore guessing, or \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote I told you,\rquote  said Snape, rigid in his chair, his eyes slits, \lquote to call me \'93sir\'94.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, sir,\rquote  said Harry impatiently, \lquote but how do you know \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote It is enough that we know,\rquote  said Snape repressively. \lquote The impor\-
tant point is that the Dark Lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thoughts and feelings. He has also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse; that is to say, he has realised that he might be able to access your thoughts and fe
elings in return \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote And he might try and make me do things?\rquote  asked Harry. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Sir?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par \lquote He might,\rquote  said Snape, sounding cold and unconcerned. \lquote Which brings us back to Occlumency.\rquote 
\par Snape pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of his robes a
nd Harry tensed in his chair, but Snape merely raised the wand to his temple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his hair. When he withdrew it, some silvery substance came away, stretching from temple to wand like a thick gossamer strand, which br
oke as he pulled the wand away from it and fell gracefully into the Pensieve, where it swirled silvery-white, neither gas nor liquid. Twice more, Snape raised the wand to his temple and deposited the silvery sub\-
stance into the stone basin, then, without offering any explanation of his behaviour, he picked up the Pensieve carefully, removed it to a shelf out of their way and returned to face Harry with his wand held at the ready.
\par \lquote Stand up and take out your wand, Potter.\rquote 
\par Harry got to his feet, feeling nervous. They faced each other with the desk between them.
\par \lquote You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me, or defend yourself in any other way you can think of,\rquote  said Snape.
\par \lquote And what are you going to do?\rquote  Harry asked, eyeing Snape\rquote s wand apprehensively.
\par \lquote I am about to attempt to break into your mind,\rquote 
 said Snape softly. We are going to see how well you resist. I have been told that you have already shown aptitude at resisting the Imperius Curse. You will find that similar powers are needed for this ... brace yourself, now. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37

wless corridor ending in a locked door for months, without once realising that it was a real place. Now, seeing the memory again, he knew that all along he had been dreaming about the corridor down which he had run with Mr Weasley on the twelfth of August
 as they hurried to the courtrooms in the Ministry; it was the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries and Mr Weasley had been there the night that he had been attacked by Voldemort\rquote s snake.
\par He looked up at Snape.
\par \lquote What\rquote s in the Department of Mysteries?\rquote 
\par \lquote What did you say?\rquote  Snape asked quietly and Harry saw, with deep satisfaction, that Snape was unnerved.
\par \lquote I said, what\rquote s in the Department of Mysteries, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 sir?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
Harry said.
\par \lquote And why,\rquote  said Snape slowly, \lquote would you ask such a thing?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because,\rquote  said Harry, watching Snape closely for a reaction, \lquote that corridor I\rquote ve just seen \endash  I\rquote ve been dreaming about it for months \endash  I\rquote ve just recognised it \endash 
 it leads to the Department of Mysteries ... and I think Voldemort wants something from \endash \rquote

\par They glared at each other. Harry\rquote s scar seared again, but he did not care. Snape looked agitated; but when he spoke again he sounded as though he was trying to appear cool and unconcerned.
\par \lquote There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, few of which you would understand and none of which concern you. Do I make myself plain?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  Harry said, still rubbing his prickling scar, which was becoming more painful.
\par \lquote I want you back here same time on Wednesday. We will con\-tinue work then.\rquote 
\par \lquote Fine,\rquote  said Harry. He was desperate to get out of Snape\rquote s office and find Ron and Hermione.
\par \lquote You are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before sleep; empty it, make it blank and calm, you understand?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry, who was barely listening.
\par \lquote And be warned, Potter ... I shall know if you have not prac\-tised ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  Harry mumbled. He picked up his schoolbag, swung it over his shoulder and hurried towards the office door. As he open
ed it, he glanced back at Snape, who had his back to Harry and was scooping his own thoughts out of the Pensieve with the tip of his wand and replacing them carefully inside his own head. Harry left without another word, closing the door carefully behind 
him, his scar still throbbing painfully.
\par Harry found Ron and Hermione in the library, where they were working on Umbridge\rquote s most recent ream of homework. Other stu\-dents, nearly all of them fifth-years, sat at lamp-lit tables nearby, noses close to books, q
uills scratching feverishly, while the sky outside the mullioned windows grew steadily blacker. The only other sound was the slight squeaking of one of Madam Pince\rquote 
s shoes, as the librarian prowled the aisles menacingly, breathing down the necks of those touching her precious books.
\par Harry felt shivery; his scar was still aching, he felt almost feverish.
\par When he sat down opposite Ron and Hermione, he caught sight of himself in the window opposite; he was very white and his scar seemed to be showing up more clearly than usual.
\par \lquote How did it go?\rquote  Hermione whispered, and then, looking con\-cerned. \lquote Are you all right, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... fine ... I dunno,\rquote  said Harry impatiently, wincing as pain shot through his scar again. \lquote Listen ... I\rquote ve just realised some\-thing ...\rquote 
\par And he told them what he had just seen and deduced.
\par \lquote So ... so are you saying ...\rquote  whispered Ron, as Madam Pince swept past, squeaking slightly, \lquote that the weapon \endash  the thing You-Know-Who\rquote s after \endash  is in the Ministry of Magic?\rquote 
\par \lquote In the Department of Mysteries, it\rquote s got to be,\rquote  Harry whispered. \lquote I saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for my hearing and it\rquote s definitely the same one he was guarding when the snake bit him.
\rquote 
\par Hermione let out a long, slow sigh.
\par \lquote Of course,\rquote  she breathed.
\par \lquote Of course what?\rquote  said Ron rather impatiently.
\par \lquote Ron, think about it ... Sturgis Podmore was trying to get through a door at the Ministry of Magic ... it must have been that one, it\rquote s too much of a coincidence!\rquote 
\par \lquote How come Sturgis was trying to break in when he\rquote s on our side?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Well, I don\rquote t know,\rquote  Hermione admitted. \lquote That is a bit odd ...\rquote 
\par \lquote So what\rquote s in the Department of Mysteries?\rquote  Harry asked Ron. \lquote Has your dad ever mentioned anything about it?\rquote 
\par \lquote I know they call the people who work in there \'93Unspeakables\'94,\rquote  said Ron, frowning. \lquote Because no one really seems to know what they do \endash  weird place to have a weapon.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s not weird at all, it makes perfect sense,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote It will be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing, I expect ... Harry, are you sure you\rquote re all right?\rquote 
\par For Harry had just run both his hands hard over his forehead as though trying to iron it.
\par \lquote Yeah ... fine ...\rquote  he said, lowering his hands, which were trem\-bling. \lquote I just feel a bit ... I don\rquote t like Occlumency much.\rquote 
\par \lquote I expect anyone would feel shaky if they\rquote d had their mind attacked over and over again,\rquote  said Hermione sympathetically. \lquote Look, let\rquote s get back to the common room, we\rquote ll be a bit more comfort\-able there.\rquote 

\par But the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter and excitement; Fred and George were demonstrating their latest bit of joke shop merchandise.
\par \lquote Headless Hats!\rquote  shouted George, as Fred waved a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students. \lquote Two Galleons each, watch Fred, now!\rquote 
\par Fred swept the hat on to his head, beaming. For a second he merely looked rather stupid; then both hat and head vanished.
\par Several girls screamed, but everyone else was roaring with laughter.
\par \lquote And off again!\rquote  shouted George, and Fred\rquote s hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder; then his head reappeared as he swept the pink-feathered hat from it.
\par \lquote How do those hats work, then?\rquote  said Hermione, distracted from her homework and watching Fred and George. \lquote I mean, obviously it\rquote s some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it\rquote 
s rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object ... I\rquote d imagine the charm wouldn\rquote t have a very long life though.\rquote 
\par Harry did not answer; he was feeling ill.
\par \lquote I\rquote m going to have to do this tomorrow,\rquote  he muttered, pushing the books he had just taken out of his bag back inside it.
\par \lquote Well, write it in your homework planner then!\rquote  said Hermione encouragingly. \lquote So you don\rquote t forget!\rquote 
\par Harry and Ron exchanged looks as he reached into his bag, withdrew the planner and opened it tentatively.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Don\rquote t leave it till later, you big second-rater!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
chided the book as Harry scribbled down Umbridge\rquote s homework. Hermione beamed at it.
\par \lquote I think I\rquote ll go to bed,\rquote  said Harry, stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got.
\par He walked across the common room, dodging George, who tried to put a Headless Hat on him, and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys\rquote 
 dormitories. He was feeling sick again, just as he had the night he had had the vision of the snake, but thought that if he could just lie down for a while he would be all right.
\par He opene
d the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must have sliced into the top of his head. He did not know where he was, whether he was standing or lying down, he did not even know his own 
name.
\par Maniacal laughter was ringing in his ears ... he was happier than he had been in a very long time ... jubilant, ecstatic, trium\-phant ... a wonderful, wonderful thing had happened ...
\par \lquote Harry? HARRY!\rquote 
\par Someone had hit him around the face. The insane laughter was punctuated with a cry of pain. The happiness was draining out of him, but the laughter continued ...
\par He opened his eyes and, as he did so, he became aware that the wild laughter was coming out of his own mouth. The moment he realised this, it die
d away; Harry lay panting on the floor, staring up at the ceiling, the scar on his forehead throbbing horribly. Ron was bending over him, looking very worried.
\par \lquote What happened?\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote I ... dunno ...\rquote  Harry gasped, sitting up again. \lquote He\rquote s really happy ... really happy ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You-Know-Who is?\rquote 
\par \lquote Something good\rquote s happened,\rquote  mumbled Harry. He was shaking as badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack Mr Weasley and felt very sick. \lquote Something he\rquote s been hoping for.\rquote 
\par The words came, just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing room, as though a stranger was speaking them through Harry\rquote 
s mouth, yet he knew they were true. He took deep breaths, willing himself not to vomit all over Ron. He was very glad that Dean and Seamus were not here to watch this time.
\par \lquote Hermione told me to come and check on you,\rquote  said Ron in a low voice, helping Harry to his feet. \lquote She says your defences will be low at the moment, after Snape\rquote s been fiddling around with your mind ... still, I suppose it
\rquote ll help in the long run, won\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par He looked doubtfully at Harry as he helped him towards his bed. Harry nodded without any conviction and slumped back on his pillows, aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening, his scar still prickling painfully. He could n
ot help feeling that his first foray into Occlumency had weakened his mind\rquote 
s resistance rather than strengthening it, and he wondered, with a feeling of great trepidation, what had happened to make Lord Voldemort the happiest he had been in fourteen years.

\par For answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of them and pointed at ten black-and-white photographs that filled the whole of the front page, nine showing wizards\rquote  faces and the tenth, a witch\rquote

\par Hagrid was standing beside the doors into the Entrance Hall, waiting for a crowd of Ravenclaws to pass. He was still as heavily bruised as he had been on the day he had come back from his mission to the giants and there was a new cut right across the

s, Harry, Ron and Hermione seemed to b
e the only people who knew or cared. There was only one topic of conversation in the corridors now: the ten escaped Death Eaters, whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspapers. Rumours were flying that s
ome of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade, that they were sup\-posed to be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to break into Hogwarts, just as Sirius Black had once done.

ing the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear as Voldemort\rquote s; the crimes they had committed during the days of Voldemort\rquote 
s reign of terror were legendary. There were relatives of their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found them\-
selves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, whose uncle, aunt and cousins had all died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what
 it felt like to be Harry.
\par \lquote And I don\rquote t know how you stand it \endash  it\rquote s horrible,\rquote  she said bluntly, dumping far too much dragon manure on her tray of Screechsnap seedlings, causing them to wriggle and squeak in discomfort.
\par It was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days, yet he thought he detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers\rquote 
 voices. They sounded curious rather than hostile now, and once or twice he was sure he overheard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of the Azkaban fortress. In their confusion and fear, these doubters 
now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them: the one that Harry and Dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year.
\par It was not only the students\rquote  mood that had changed. It was now quite common to come across two or three teachers con\-versing in low, urgent whispers in the corridors, breaking off their conversations the moment they saw students approaching.

\par \lquote They obviously can\rquote t talk freely in the staff room any more,\rquote  said Hermione in a low voice, as she, Harry and Ron passed Professors McGonagall, Flitwick and Sprout huddled together out\-side the Charms classroom one day. \lquote

s got nothing to do with Defence Against the Dark Arts, Professor! That\rquote s not information relating to your subject!\rquote 
\par When Harry next saw Lee, the back of his hand was bleeding rather badly. Harry recommended essence of Murtlap.
\par Harry had thought the br
eakout from Azkaban might have humbled Umbridge a little, that she might have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under the nose of her beloved Fudge. It seemed, however, to have only intensified her furious desire to bring every aspec
t of life at Hogwarts under her personal control. She seemed determined at the very least to achieve a sacking before long, and the only question was whether it would be Professor Trelawney or Hagrid who went first.
\par Every single Divination and Care of Magical Creatures lesson was now conducted in the presence of Umbridge and her clipboard. She lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room, inter\-rupting Professor Trelawney\rquote 
s increasingly hysterical talks with dif\-ficult questions about ornithomancy and heptomology, insisting that she predict students\rquote 
 answers before they gave them and demanding that she demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball, the tea leaves and the rune stones in turn. Harry thought Professor Trelawney might soon crack under the strain. Several times he passed her in the corridors 
\endash  in itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in her tower room \endash  muttering wildly to herself, wringing her hands and shooting terrified glances over her shoulder, and all the while givin
g off a powerful smell of cooking sherry. If he had not been so worried about Hagrid, he would have felt sorry for her \endash  but if one of them was to be ousted from their job, there could be only one choice for Harry as to who should remain.
\par Unfortunately, Harry could not see that Hagrid was putting up a better show than Trelawney. Though he seemed to be following Hermione\rquote s advice and had shown them nothing more frightening than a Crup \endash 
 a creature indistinguishable from a Jack Russell ter\-rier except for its forked tail \endash 
 since before Christmas, he too seemed to have lost his nerve. He was oddly distracted and jumpy during lessons, losing the thread of what he was saying to the class, answering questions wrongly, and all the time glancing anxiously at Umbridg
e. He was also more distant with Harry, Ron and Hermione than he had ever been before, and had expressly for\-bidden them to visit him after dark.
\par \lquote If she catches yeh, it\rquote ll be all of our necks on the line,\rquote  he told them flatly, and with no desire to do anything that might jeopar\-dise his job further they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evenings.
\par It seemed to Harry that Umbridge was steadily depriving him of everything that made his life at Hogwarts worth living: visits to Hagrid\rquote s house, letters from Sirius, his Firebolt and Quidditch. He took his revenge the only way he could \endash 
 by redoubling his efforts for the DA.
\par Harry was pleased to see that all of them, even Zacharias Smith, had been spurred on to work harder than ever by the news that ten more Death Eaters were now on the loose, but in nobody was this improvement more pronounced than in Neville. The news of his
 parents\rquote  attackers\rquote  escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him. He had not once mentioned his meeting with Harry, Ron and Hermione on the closed ward in St Mungo\rquote 
s and, taking their lead from him, they had kept quiet about it too. Nor had he said anything on the subject of Bellatrix and her fellow torturers\rquote 
 escape. In fact, Neville barely spoke during the DA meetings any more, but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and counter-curse Harry taught them, his plump face screwed up
 in concentration, apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents and working harder than anyone else in the room. He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught them the Shield Charm \endash 
 a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attacker \endash  only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville.
\par Harry would have given a great deal to be making as much progress at Occlumency as Neville was making during the DA meet\-ings. Harry\rquote s sessions with Snape, which had star
ted badly enough, were not improving. On the contrary, Harry felt he was getting worse with every lesson.
\par Before he had started studying Occlumency, his scar had prickled occasionally, usually during the night, or else following one of those strange flashes of Voldemort\rquote 
s thoughts or mood that he experienced every now and then. Nowadays, however, his scar hardly ever stopped prickling, and he often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was hap\-pening to him at the time, which
 were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar. He had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Voldemort\rquote 
s mood, and he was sure he could date this increase
d sensitivity firmly from his first Occlumency lesson with Snape. What was more, he was now dreaming about walking down the corridor towards the entrance to the Department of Mysteries almost every night, dreams which always culminated in him standing lon
gingly in front of the plain black door.
\par \lquote Maybe it\rquote s a bit like an illness,\rquote  said Hermione, looking con\-cerned when Harry confided in her and Ron. \lquote A fever or some\-thing. It has to get worse before it gets better.\rquote 
\par \lquote The lessons with Snape are making it worse,\rquote  said Harry flatly. \lquote I\rquote m getting sick of my scar hurting and I\rquote m getting bored with walking down that corridor every night.\rquote  He rubbed his forehead angrily. \lquote 
I just wish the door would open, I\rquote m sick of standing staring at it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s not funny,\rquote  said Hermione sharply. \lquote Dumbledore doesn\rquote t want you to have dreams about that corridor at all, or he wouldn\rquote t have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency. You\rquote 
re just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons.\rquote 
\par \lquote I am working!\rquote  said Harry, nettled. \lquote You try it some time \endash  Snape trying to get inside your head \endash  it\rquote s not a bundle of laughs, you know!\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe ...\rquote  said Ron slowly.
\par \lquote Maybe what?\rquote  said Hermione, rather snappishly.
\par \lquote Maybe it\rquote s not Harry\rquote s fault he can\rquote t close his mind,\rquote  said Ron darkly.
\par \lquote What do you mean?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Well, maybe Snape isn\rquote t really trying to help Harry ...\rquote

\par \lquote Maybe,\rquote  he said again, in a lower voice, \lquote he\rquote s actually trying to open Harry\rquote s mind a bit wider ... make it easier for You-Know\emdash \rquote

\par \lquote It\rquote s because you\rquote re good when you\rquote re on form, that\rquote s why,\rquote  said Harry irritably.
\par He found it very hard to be sympathetic to Ron\rquote s plight, when he himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against Hufflepuff. Ron seemed to have noticed Harry\rquote 
s tone, because he did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said goodbye to each other shortly afterwards. Ron departed for the Quidditch pitch and Harry, after attempting to flatten his hai
r while staring at his reflection in the back of a teaspoon, proceeded alone to the Entrance Hall to meet Cho, feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about.
\par She was waiting for him a little to the side of the oak front doors, looking very pretty with her hair tied back in a long pony\-tail. Harry\rquote 
s feet seemed to be too big for his body as he walked towards her and he was suddenly horribly aware of his arms and how stupid they must look swinging at his sides.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  said Cho slightly breathlessly.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  said Harry.
\par They stared at each other for a moment, then Harry said, \lquote Well \endash  er \endash  shall we go, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh \endash  yes ...\rquote 
\par They joined the queue of people being signed out by Filch, occasionally catching each other\rquote s eye and gri
nning shiftily, but not talking to each other. Harry was relieved when they reached the fresh air, finding it easier to walk along in silence than just stand about looking awkward. It was a fresh, breezy sort of a day and as they passed the Quidditch stad
ium Harry glimpsed Ron and Ginny skimming along over the stands and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them.
\par \lquote You really miss it, don\rquote t you?\rquote  said Cho.
\par He looked round and saw her watching him.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  sighed Harry. \lquote I do.\rquote 
\par \lquote Remember the first time we played against each other, in the third year?\rquote  she asked him.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, grinning. \lquote You kept blocking me.\rquote 
\par \lquote And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to,\rquote  said Cho, smiling reminiscently. \lquote I heard he got taken on by Pride of Portree, is that right?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nah, it was Puddlemere United; I saw him at the World Cup last year.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, I saw you there, too, remember? We were on the same campsite. It was really good, wasn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par The subject of the Quidditch World Cup carried them all the way down the drive and out through the gates. Harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to her \endash  no more difficult, in fact, than talking to Ron and Hermione \endash 
 and he was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them, including Pansy Parkinson.
\par \lquote Potter and Chang!\rquote  screeched Pansy, to a chorus of snide gig\-gles. \lquote Urgh, Chang, I don\rquote t think much of your taste ... at least Diggory was good-looking!\rquote 
\par The girls sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho, leaving an embar\-
rassed silence in their wake. Harry could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching her feet.
\par \lquote So ... where d\rquote you want to go?\rquote  Harry asked as they entered Hogsmeade. The High Street was full of students ambling up and down, peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements.
\par \lquote Oh ... I don\rquote t mind,\rquote  said Cho, shrugging. \lquote Um ... shall we just have a look in the shops or something?\rquote 
\par They wandered towards Dervish and Banges. A large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at it. They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry found himself staring once more
 at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters. The poster, \lquote By Order of the Ministry of Magic\rquote , offered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with informa\-tion leading to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured.
\par \lquote It\rquote s funny, isn\rquote t it,\rquote  said Cho in a low voice, gazing up at the pic\-tures of the Death Eaters, \lquote 
remember when that Sirius Black escaped, and there were Dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there are no Dementors anywhere ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Bellatrix Lestrange\rquote s face to glance up and down the High Street. \lquote Yeah, that is weird.\rquote 
\par He wasn\rquote t sorry that there were no Dementors nearby, but now he came to think of it, their absence was highly significant. They had not only let the Death Eaters escape, they weren\rquote 
t bothering to look for them ... it looked as though they really were outside Ministry control now.
\par The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he and Cho passed. It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft\rquote s; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry\rquote s face and the back of his neck.
\par \lquote Um ... d\rquote you want to get a coffee?\rquote  said Cho tentatively, as the rain began to fall more heavily.
\par \lquote Yeah, all right,\rquote  said Harry, looking around. \lquote Where?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, there\rquote s a really nice place just up here; haven\rquote t you ever been to Madam Puddifoot\rquote s?\rquote 
 she said brightly, leading him up a side road and into a small teashop that Harry had never noticed before. It was a cramped, steamy litt
le place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows. Harry was reminded unpleasantly of Umbridge\rquote s office.
\par \lquote Cute, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Cho happily.
\par \lquote Er ... yeah,\rquote  said Harry untruthfully.
\par \lquote Look, she\rquote s decorated it for Valentine\rquote s Day!\rquote  said Cho, indi\-cating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small, circular tables, occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants.
\par \lquote Aaah ...\rquote 
\par They sat down at the last remaining table, which was over by the steamy window. Roger Davies, the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl. They were holding hands. The sight made Harry feel uncomfort
\-able, particularly when, looking around the teashop, he saw that it was full of nothing but couples, all of them holding hands. Perhaps Cho would expect him to hold }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 her }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 hand.
\par \lquote What can I get you, m\rquote dears?\rquote  said Madam Puddifoot, a very stout woman with a shiny black bun, squeezing between their table and Roger Davies\rquote s with great difficulty.
\par \lquote Two coffees, please,\rquote  said Cho.
\par In the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his girlfriend had started kissing over their sugar bowl. Harry wished they wouldn\rquote t; he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which Cho would s
oon expect him to compete. He felt his face growing hot and tried staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up he couldn\rquote 
t see the street outside. To postpone the moment when he would have to look at Cho, he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub.
\par After a few more painful minutes, Cho mentioned Umbridge. Harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing her, but the subject had already been so thoroughly can\-
vassed during DA meetings it did not last very long. Silence fell again. Harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say.
\par \lquote Er ... listen, d\rquote you want to come with me to the Three Broomsticks at lunchtime? I\rquote m meeting Hermione Granger there.\rquote 
\par Cho raised her eyebrows.
\par \lquote You\rquote re meeting Hermione Granger? Today?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah. Well, she asked me to, so I thought I would. D\rquote you want to come with me? She said it wouldn\rquote t matter if you did.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh ... well ... that was nice of her.\rquote 
\par But Cho did not sound as though she thought it was nice at all. On the contrary, her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather forbidding.
\par A few more minutes passed in total silence, Harry drinking his coffee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup. Beside them, Roger Davies and his girlfriend seemed glued together at the lips.
\par Cho\rquote s hand was lying on the table beside her coffee and Harry was feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Just do it, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 he told himself, as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his chest, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
just reach out and grab it. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Amazing, how much more difficult it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than it was to sna
tch a speeding Snitch from midair ...
\par But just as he moved his hand forwards, Cho took hers off the table. She was now watching Roger Davies kissing his girlfriend with a mildly interested expression.
\par \lquote He asked me out, you know,\rquote  she said in a quiet voice. \lquote A couple of weeks ago. Roger. I turned him down, though.\rquote 
\par Harry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table, could not think why she was telling him this. If she wished she were sitting at the next table being h
eartily kissed by Roger Davies, why had she agreed to come out with him?
\par He said nothing. Their cherub threw another handful of con\-fetti over them; some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee Harry had been about to drink.
\par \lquote I came in here with Cedric last year,\rquote  said Cho.
\par In the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said, Harry\rquote s insides had become glacial. He could not believe she wanted to talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads.
\par Cho\rquote s voice was rather higher when she spoke again.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve been meaning to ask you for ages ... did Cedric \endash  did he \endash  m \endash  m \endash  mention me at all before he died?\rquote 
\par This was the very last subject on earth Harry wanted to discuss, and least of all with Cho.
\par \lquote Well \endash  no \endash \rquote  he said quietly. \lquote There \endash  there wasn\rquote t time for him to say anything. Erm ... so ... d\rquote you ... d\rquote you get to see a lot of Quidditch in the holidays? You
 support the Tornados, right?\rquote 
\par His voice sounded falsely bright and cheery. To his horror, he saw that her eyes were swimming with tears again, just as they had been after the last DA meeting before Christmas.
\par \lquote Look,\rquote  he said desperately, leaning in so that nobody else could overhear, \lquote let\rquote s not talk about Cedric right now ... let\rquote s talk about something else ...\rquote 
\par But this, apparently, was quite the wrong thing to say.
\par \lquote I thought,\rquote  she said, tears spattering down on to the table, \lquote I thought }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 you\rquote d }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 to talk about it! Surely you n \endash  need to talk about it t \endash  too! I mean, you saw it happen, d \endash  didn\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par Everything was going nightmarishly wrong; Roger Daviess girl\-friend had even unglued herself to look round at Cho crying.
\par \lquote Well \endash  I have talked about it,\rquote  Harry said in a whisper, \lquote to Ron and Hermione, but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, you\rquote ll talk to Hermione Granger!\rquote  she said shrilly, her face now shining with tears. Several more kissing couples broke apart to stare. \lquote But you won\rquote t talk to me! P \endash  perhaps
 it would be best if we just ... just p \endash  paid and you went and met up with Hermione G \endash  Granger, like you obviously want to!\rquote 
\par Harry stared at her, utterly bewildered, as she seized a frilly napkin and dabbed at her shining face with it.
\par \lquote Cho?\rquote  he said weakly, wishing Roger would seize his girlfriend and start kissing her again to stop her goggling at him and Cho.
\par \lquote Go on, leave!\rquote  she said, now crying into the napkin. \lquote I don\rquote t know why you asked me out in the first place if you\rquote re going to make arrangements 
to meet other girls right after me ... how many are you meeting after Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s not like that!\rquote  said Harry, and he was so relieved at finally understanding what she was annoyed about that he laughed, which he realised a split second too late was also a mistake.
\par Cho sprang to her feet. The whole tearoom was quiet and every\-body was watching them now.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll see you around, Harry,\rquote  she said dramatically, and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain.
\par \lquote Cho!\rquote  Harry called after her, but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle.
\par There was total silence within the teashop. Every eye was on Harry. He threw a Galleon down on to the table, shook pink con\-fetti out of his hair, and followed Cho out of the door.
\par It was raining hard now and she was nowhere to be seen. He simply did not understand what had happened; half an hour ago they had been getting along fine.
\par \lquote Women!\rquote  he muttered angrily, sloshing down the rain-washed street with his hands in his pockets. \lquote 
What did she want to talk about Cedric for, anyway? Why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe?\rquote 
\par He turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within min\-utes he was turning into 
the doorway of the Three Broomsticks. He knew he was too early to meet Hermione, but he thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time. He shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around. Hagrid was sit
ting alone in a corner, looking morose.
\par \lquote Hi, Hagrid!\rquote  he said, when he had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair beside him.
\par Hagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he barely recognised him. Harry saw that he had two fresh cuts on his face and several new bruises.
\par \lquote Oh, it\rquote s yeh, Harry,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Yeh all righ\rquote ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I\rquote m fine,\rquote  lied Harry; but, next to this battered and mournful-looking Hagrid, he felt he didn\rquote t really have much to complain about. \lquote Er \endash  are you OK?\rquote 
\par \lquote Me?\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Oh yeah, I\rquote m grand, Harry, grand.\rquote 
\par He gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard, which was the size of a large bucket, and sighed. Harry didn\rquote t know what to say to him. They sat side by side in silence for a moment. Then Hagrid said abruptly, \lquote In the same boat, yeh an
\rquote  me, aren\rquote  we, \rquote Arry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash \rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Yeah ... I\rquote ve said it before ... both outsiders, like,\rquote  said Hagrid, nodding wisely. \lquote An\rquote  both orphans. Yeah ... both orphans.\rquote 
\par He took a great swig from his tankard.
\par \lquote Makes a diff\rquote rence, havin\rquote  a decent family,\rquote  he said. \lquote Me dad was decent. An\rquote  your mum an\rquote  dad were decent. If they\rquote d lived, life woulda bin diff\rquote rent, eh?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... I s\rquote pose,\rquote  said Harry cautiously. Hagrid seemed to be in a very strange mood.
\par \lquote Family,\rquote  said Hagrid gloomily. \lquote Whatever yeh say, blood\rquote s impor\-tant ...\rquote 
\par And he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye.
\par \lquote Hagrid,\rquote  said Harry, unable to stop himself, \lquote where are you get\-ting all these injuries?\rquote 
\par \lquote Eh?\rquote  said Hagrid, looking startled. \lquote Wha\rquote  injuries?\rquote 
\par \lquote All those!\rquote  said Harry, pointing at Hagrid\rquote s face.
\par \lquote Oh ... tha\rquote s jus\rquote  normal bumps an\rquote  bruises, Harry,\rquote  said Hagrid dismissively, \lquote I got a rough job.\rquote 
\par He drained his tankard, set it back on the table and got to his feet.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll be seein\rquote  yeh, Harry ... take care now.\rquote 
\par And he lumbered out of the pub looking wretched, and disap\-peared into the torrential rain. Harry watched him go, feeling mis\-
erable. Hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something, but he seemed determined not to accept help. What was going on? But before Harry could think about it any further, he heard a voice calling his name.
\par \lquote Harry! Harry, over here!\rquote 
\par Hermione was waving at him from the other side of the room. He got up and made his way towards her through the crowded pub. He was still a few tables away 
when he realised that Hermione was not alone. She was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could ever have imagined: Luna Lovegood and none other than Rita Skeeter, ex-journalist on the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and one of Hermione\rquote s least favourite people in the world.
\par \lquote You\rquote re early!\rquote  said Hermione, moving along to give him room to sit down. \lquote I thought you were with Cho, I wasn\rquote t expecting you for another hour at least!\rquote 
\par \lquote Cho?\rquote  said Rita at once, twisting round in her seat to stare avidly at Harry. \lquote A }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 girl?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \rquote 
\par She snatched up her crocodile-skin handbag and groped within it.
\par \lquote It\rquote s none of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 your }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 business if Harry\rquote 
s been with a hundred girls,\rquote  Hermione told Rita coolly. \lquote So you can put that away right now.\rquote 
\par Rita had been on the point of withdrawing an acid-green quill from her bag. Looking as though she had been forced to swallow Stinksap, she snapped her bag shut again.
\par \lquote What are you up to?\rquote  Harry asked, sitting down and staring from Rita to Luna to Hermione.
\par \lquote Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived,\rquote  said Rita, taking a large slurp of her drink. \lquote I suppose I\rquote m allowed to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par \lquote Yes, I suppose you are,\rquote  said Hermione coldly.
\par Unemployment did not suit Rita. The hair that had once been set i
n elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face. The scarlet paint on her two-inch talons was chipped and there were a couple of false jewels missing from her winged glasses. She took another great gulp of her drink and said out of the corner 
of her mouth, \lquote Pretty girl, is she, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote One more word about Harry\rquote s love life and the deal\rquote s off and that\rquote s a promise,\rquote  said Hermione irritably.
\par \lquote What deal?\rquote  said Rita, wiping her mouth on the back of her hand. \lquote You haven\rquote t mentioned a deal yet, Miss Prissy, you just told me to turn up. Oh, one of these days ...\rquote  She took a deep shud\-dering breath.
\par \lquote Yes, yes, one of these days you\rquote ll write more horrible stories about Harry and me,\rquote  said Hermione indifferently. \lquote Find someone who cares, why don\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote ve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year without my help,\rquote  said Rita, shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper, \lquote 
How has that made you feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstood?\rquote 
\par \lquote He feels angry, of course,\rquote  said Hermione in a hard, clear voice. \lquote Because he\rquote s told the Minister for Magic the truth and the Minister\rquote s too much of an idiot to believe him.\rquote 
\par \lquote So you actually stick to it, do you, that He Who Must Not Be Named is back?\rquote  said Rita, lowering her glass and subjecting Harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag. \lquote 
You stand by all this garbage Dumbledore\rquote s been telling everybody about You-Know-Who returning and you being the sole witness?\rquote 
\par \lquote I wasn\rquote t the sole witness,\rquote  snarled Harry. \lquote There were a dozen-odd Death Eaters there as well. Want their names?\rquote

\par \lquote It\rquote s the right thing to do, Harry,\rquote  said Neville, who was sitting opposite him. He was rather pale, but went on in a low voice, \lquote It must have been ... tough ... talking about it ... was it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  mumbled Harry, \lquote but people have got to know what Voldemort\rquote s capable of, haven\rquote t they?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Neville, nodding, \lquote and his Death Eaters, too ... people should know ...\rquote 
\par Neville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato. Seamus looked up, but when he caught Harry\rquote s eye he looked quickly back at his plate again. After a while, Dean, Seamus and Neville departed 
for the common room, leaving Harry and Hermione at the table waiting for Ron, who had not yet had dinner because of Quidditch practice.
\par Cho Chang walked into the Hall with her friend Marietta. Harry\rquote s stomach gave an unpleasant lurch, but she did not look over at the Gryffindor table, and sat down with her back to him.
\par \lquote Oh, I forgot to ask you,\rquote  said Hermione brightly, glancing over at the Ravenclaw table, \lquote what happened on your date with Cho? How come you were back so early?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ... well, it was ...\rquote  said Harry, pulling a dish of rhubarb crumble towards him and helping himself to seconds, \lquote a complete fiasco, now you mention it.\rquote 
\par And he told her what had happened in Madam Puddifoot\rquote s teashop.
\par \lquote ... so then,\rquote  he finished several minutes later, as the final bit of crumble disappeared, \lquote she jumps up, right, and says, \'93I\rquote ll see you around, Harry,\'94 and runs out of the place!\rquote 
 He put down his spoon and looked at Hermione. \lquote I mean, what was all that about? What was going on?\rquote 
\par Hermione glanced over at the back of Cho\rquote s head and sighed.
\par \lquote Oh, Harry,\rquote  she said sadly. \lquote Well, I\rquote m sorry, but you were a bit tactless.\rquote 
\par \lquote Me, tactless?\rquote  said Harry, outraged. \lquote One minute we were get\-ting on fine, next minute she was telling me that Roger Davies asked her out and how she used to go and snog Cedric in that stupid teashop \endash 
 how was I supposed to feel about that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, you see,\rquote  said Hermione, with the patient air of someone explaining that one plus one equals two to an over-emotional toddler, \lquote you shouldn\rquote t have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date.\rquote 

\par \lquote But, but,\rquote  spluttered Harry, \lquote but \endash  you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along, how was I supposed to do that without telling her?\rquote 
\par \lquote You should have told her differently,\rquote  said Hermione, still with that maddeningly patient air. \lquote You should have said it was really annoying, but I\rquote d }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 made }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks, and you really didn\rquote t want to go, you\rquote 
d much rather spend the whole day with her, but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please, please come along with you and hopefully you\rquote 
d be able to get away more quickly. And it might have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am, too,\rquote  Hermione added as an afterthought.
\par \lquote But I don\rquote t think you\rquote re ugly,\rquote  said Harry, bemused.
\par Hermione laughed.
\par \lquote Harry, you\rquote re worse than Ron ... well, no, you\rquote re not,\rquote  she sighed, as Ron himself came stumping into the Hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy. \lquote Look \endash  you upset Cho when you said you were 
going to meet me, so she tried to make you jealous. It was her way of trying to find out how much you liked her.\rquote 
\par \lquote Is that what she was doing?\rquote  said Harry, as Ron dropped on to the bench opposite them and pulled every dish within reach towards him. \lquote Well, wouldn\rquote t it have been easier if she\rquote 
d just asked me whether I liked her better than you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Girls don\rquote t often ask questions like that,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Well, they should!\rquote  said Harry forcefully. \lquote Then I could\rquote ve just told her I fancy her, and she wouldn\rquote t have had to get herself all worked up again about Cedric dying!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not saying what she did was sensible,\rquote  said Hermione, as Ginny joined them, just as muddy as Ron and looking equally dis\-gruntled. \lquote I\rquote m just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time.\rquote 
\par \lquote You should write a book,\rquote  Ron told Hermione as he cut up his potatoes, \lquote translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry fervently, looking over at the Ravenclaw table. Cho had just got up, and, still not looking at him, she left the Great Hall. Feeling rather depressed, he looked back at Ron and Ginny. \lquote 
So, how was Quidditch practice?\rquote 
\par \lquote It was a nightmare,\rquote  said Ron in a surly voice.
\par \lquote Oh come on,\rquote  said Hermione, looking at Ginny, \lquote I\rquote m sure it wasn\rquote t that \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, it was,\rquote  said Ginny. \lquote It was appalling. Angelina was nearly in tears by the end of it.\rquote 
\par Ron and Ginny went off for baths after dinner; Harry and Hermione returned to the busy Gryffindor common room and their usual pile of homework. Harry had been struggling with a new star-chart for Astronomy for half an hour when Fred and George turned up.

\par \lquote Ron and Ginny not here?\rquote  asked Fred, looking around as he pulled up a chair, and when Harry shook his head, he said, \lquote Good. We were watching their practice. They\rquote re going to be slaughtered. They\rquote 
re complete rubbish without us.\rquote 
\par \lquote Come on, Ginny\rquote s not bad,\rquote  said George fairly, sitting down next to Fred. \lquote Actually, I dunno how she got so good, seeing how we never let her play with us.\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you weren\rquote t looking,\rquote  said Hermione from behind her tottering pile of Ancient Rune books.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said George, looking mildly impressed. \lquote Well \endash  that\rquote d explain it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Has Ron saved a goal yet?\rquote  asked Hermione, peering over the top of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Well, he can do it if he doesn\rquote t think anyone\rquote s watching him,\rquote  said Fred, rolling his eyes. \lquote 
So all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk among themselves every time the Quaffle goes up his end on Saturday.\rquote 
\par He got up again and moved restlessly to the window, staring out across the dark grounds.
\par \lquote You know, Quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth staying for.\rquote 
\par Hermione cast him a stern look.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve got exams coming!\rquote 
\par \lquote Told you already, we\rquote re not fussed about NEWTs,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote The Snackboxes are ready to roll, we found out how to get rid of those boils, just a couple of drops of Murtlap essence sorts them, Lee put us on to it.\rquote 

\par George yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy night sky.
\par \lquote I dunno if I even want to watch this match. If Zacharias Smith beats us I might have to kill myself.\rquote 
\par \lquote Kill him, more like,\rquote  said Fred firmly.
\par \lquote That\rquote s the trouble with Quidditch,\rquote  said Hermione absent-mindedly, once again bent over her Runes translation, \lquote it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the houses.\rquote 
\par She looked up to find her copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Spellman\rquote s Syllabary, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
and caught Fred, George and Harry all staring at her with expressions of mingled disgust and incredulity on their faces.
\par \lquote Well, it does!\rquote  she said impatiently. \lquote It\rquote s only a game, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hermione,\rquote  said Harry, shaking his head, \lquote you\rquote re good on feel\-ings and stuff, but you just don\rquote t understand about Quidditch.\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe not,\rquote  she said darkly, returning to her translation, \lquote but at least my happiness doesn\rquote t depend on Ron\rquote s goalkeeping ability.\rquote 
\par And though Harry would rather have jumped off the Astronomy Tower than admit it to her, by the time he had watched the game the following Saturday he would have given any number of Galleons not to care about Quidditch either.
\par The very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short; the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty-two minutes of agony. It was hard to say what the worst thing was: Harry thought it was a close-run contest between Ron\rquote 
s fourteenth failed save, Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his bat, and Kirke shrieking and falling backwards off his broom when Zacharias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle. The miracle was that Gryffindor
 only lost by ten points: Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby\rquote s nose, so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty.
\par \lquote Good catch,\rquote  Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where the atmosphere resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral.
\par \lquote I was lucky,\rquote  she shrugged. \lquote It wasn\rquote t a very fast Snitch and Summerby\rquote s got a cold, he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment. Anyway, once you\rquote re back on the team \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ginny, I\rquote ve got a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 lifelong }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 ban.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re banned as long as Umbridge is in the school,\rquote  Ginny cor\-rected him. \lquote There\rquote s a difference. Anyway, once you\rquote re back, I think I\rquote 
ll try out for Chaser. Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year and I prefer goal-scoring to Seeking anyway.\rquote 
\par Harry looked over at Ron, who was hunched in a corner, staring at his knees, a bottle of Butterbeer clutched in his hand.
\par \lquote Angelina still won\rquote t let him resign,\rquote  Ginny said, as though reading Harry\rquote s mind. \lquote She says she knows he\rquote s got it in him.\rquote 
\par Harry liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in Ron, but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team. Ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of \lquote Weasley is our King\rquote 
 sung with great gusto by the Slytherins, who were now favourites to win the Quidditch Cup.
\par Fred and George wandered over.
\par \lquote I haven\rquote t even got the heart to take the mickey out of him,\rquote  said Fred, looking over at Ron\rquote s crumpled figure. \lquote Mind you ... when he missed the fourteenth \endash \rquote 
\par He made wild motions with his arms as though doing an upright doggy-paddle.
\par \lquote \endash  well, I\rquote ll save it for parties, eh?\rquote 
\par Ron dragged himself up to bed shortly after this. Out of respect for his feelings, Harry waited a while before going up to the dormi\-
tory himself, so that Ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to. Sure enough, when Harry finally entered the room Ron was snoring a little too loudly to be entirely plausible.
\par Harry got into bed, thinking about the match. It had been immensely frustrating watching from the sidelines. He was quite impressed by Ginny\rquote 
s performance but he knew if he had been playing he could have caught the Snitch sooner ... there had been a moment when it had been fluttering near Kirke\rquote s ankle; if Ginny hadn\rquote 
t hesitated, she might have been able to scrape a win for Gryffindor.
\par Umbridge had been sitting a few rows below Harry and Hermione. Once or twice she had turned squatly in her seat to look at him, her wide toad\rquote s mouth stretched in what he thought 
had been a gloating smile. The memory of it made him feel hot with anger as he lay there in the dark. After a few minutes, how\-
ever, he remembered that he was supposed to be emptying his mind of all emotion before he slept, as Snape kept instructing him at the end of every Occlumency lesson.
\par He tried for a moment or two, but the thought of Snape on top of memories of Umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling resentment and he found himself focusing instead on how much he loathed the pair of them. Slowly, Ron\rquote 
s snores died away, to be replaced by the sound of deep, slow breathing. It took Harry much longer to get to sleep; his body was tired, but it took his brain a long time to close down.
\par He dreamed that Neville and Professor Sprout were waltzing around the Room of Requirement while Professor McGonagall played the bagpipes. He watched them happily for a while, then decided to go and find the other members of the DA.
\par But when he left the room he found himself facing, not the tap\-estry of Barnabas the B
army, but a torch burning in its bracket on a stone wall. He turned his head slowly to the left. There, at the far end of the windowless passage, was a plain, black door.
\par He walked towards it with a sense of mounting excitement. He had the strangest feelin
g that this time he was going to get lucky at last, and find the way to open it ... he was feet from it, and saw with a leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light down the right-hand side ... the door was ajar ... he stretched o

\par Ron gave a loud, rasping, genuine snore and Harry awoke abruptly with his right hand stretched in front of him in the dark\-ness, to open a door that was hundreds of miles away. He let it fall with a feeling of mingled disap
pointment and guilt. He knew he should not have seen the door, but at the same time felt so con\-
sumed with curiosity about what was behind it that he could not help feeling annoyed with Ron ... if only he could have saved his snore for just another minute.

They entered the Great Hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls on Monday morning. Hermione was not the only person eagerly awaiting her }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

owl landed with a thud in front of him, that it had made a mistake.

\par Harry looked up with his hands full of envelopes. Professor Umbridge was standing behind Fred and Luna, her bulging toad\rquote s eyes scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front o

\par \lquote Be careful, Mr Weasley, or I shall have to put you in detention,\rquote  said Umbridge. \lquote Well, Mr Potter?\rquote 
\par Harry hesitated, but he did not see how he could keep what he had done quiet; it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Quibbler }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par \lquote People have written to me because I gave an interview,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote About what happened to me last June.\rquote 
\par For some reason he glanced up at the staff table as he said this. Harry had the strangest feeling that Dumbledore had been watching him a second before, but when he looked towards the Headmas
ter he seemed to be absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick.
\par \lquote An interview?\rquote  repeated Umbridge, her voice thinner and higher than ever. \lquote What do you mean?\rquote

to her. She caught it and stared down at the cover. Her pale, doughy face turned an ugly, patchy violet.
\par \lquote When did you do this?\rquote  she asked, her voice trembling slightly.
\par \lquote Last Hogsmeade weekend,\rquote  said Harry.
\par She looked up at him, incandescent with rage, the magazine shaking in her stubby fingers.
\par \lquote There will be no more Hogsmeade trips for you, Mr Potter,\rquote  she whispered. \lquote How you dare ... how you could ...\rquote  She took a deep breath. \lquote I have tried again and again to teach y

\par \lquote Oh, Harry, don\rquote t you see?\rquote  Hermione breathed. \lquote If she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview, it was banning it!\rquote 
\par And it seemed that Hermione was quite right. By the end of the day, though Harry had not seen so much as a corner of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Quibbler }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 anywhere in the school, the whole place seemed to be quoting the interview to each other. Harry heard them whispering about it as they queued up outside classes, discussing i
t over lunch and in the back of lessons, while Hermione even reported that every occu\-pant of the cubicles in the girls\rquote  toilets had been talking about it when she nipped in there before Ancient Runes.
\par \lquote Then they spotted me, and obviously they know I know you, so they bombarded me with questions,\rquote  Hermione told Harry, her eyes shining, \lquote and Harry, I think they believe you, I really do, I think you\rquote 
ve finally got them convinced!\rquote 
\par Meanwhile, Professor Umbridge was stalking the school, stop\-ping students at random and demanding that they turn out their books and pockets: Harry knew she was looking for copies of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Quibbler, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 but the students were several steps ahead of her. The pages carrying Harry\rquote 
s interview had been bewitched to resemble extracts from textbooks if anyone but themselves read it, or else wiped magically blank until they wanted to peruse it again. Soon it seemed that every single person in the school had read it.
\par The teachers were of course forbidden from mentioning the interview by Educational 
Decree Number Twenty-six, but they found ways to express their feelings about it all the same. Professor Sprout awarded Gryffindor twenty points when Harry passed her a watering can; a beaming Professor Flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar mice on hi
m at the end of Charms, said, \lquote Shh!\rquote  and hurried away; and Professor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during Divination and announced to the startled class, and a very disapproving Umbridge, that Harry was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 going to suffer an early death after all, b
ut would live to a ripe old age, become Minister for Magic and have twelve children.
\par But what made Harry happiest was Cho catching up with him as he was hurrying along to Transfiguration the next day. Before he knew what had happened, her hand was in his and she was breathing in his ear, \lquote I\rquote 
m really, really sorry. That interview was so brave ... it made me cry.\rquote 
\par He was sorry to hear she had shed even more tears over it, but very glad they were on speaking terms again, and even more pleased when she gave him a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again. And unbelievably, no sooner had he 
arrived outside Transfiguration than something just as good happened: Seamus stepped out of the queue to face him.
\par \lquote I just wanted to say,\rquote  he mumbled, squinting at Harry\rquote s left knee, \lquote I believe you. And I\rquote ve sent a copy of that magazine to me mam.\rquote 
\par If anything more was needed to complete Harry\rquote 
s happiness, it was the reaction he got from Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle. He saw them with their heads together later that afternoon in the library; they were with a weedy-looking boy Hermione whispered was called Theodo
re Nott. They looked round at Harry as he browsed the shelves for the book he needed on Partial Vanishment: Goyle cracked his knuckles threateningly and Malfoy whispered some\-
thing undoubtedly malevolent to Crabbe. Harry knew perfectly well why they were acting like this: he had named all of their fathers as Death Eaters.
\par \lquote And the best bit,\rquote  whispered Hermione gleefully, as they left the library, \lquote is they can\rquote t contradict you, because they can\rquote t admit they\rquote ve read the article!\rquote 
\par To cap it all, Luna told him over dinner that no issue of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Quibbler }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par \lquote Dad\rquote s reprinting!\rquote  she told Harry, her eyes popping excitedly. \lquote He can\rquote t believe it, he says people seem even more interested in this than the Crumple-Horned Snorkacks!\rquote 
\par Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night. Daringly, Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front cover of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Quibbler }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and hung it on the wall, so that Harry\rquote s giant head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally saying things like \lquote THE MINISTRY ARE MORONS\rquote  and \lquote 
EAT DUNG, UMBRIDGE\rquote  in a booming voice. Hermione did not find this very amusing; she said it interfered with her concentration, and she ended up going to bed early out of irritation. Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite 
as funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had started to wear off, so that it merely shouted disconnected words like \lquote DUNG\rquote  and \lquote UMBRIDGE\rquote 
 at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice. In fact, it started to make his head ache and his scar began prickling uncomfortably again. To disappointed moans from the many people who were sit\-
ting around him, asking him to relive his interview for the umpteenth time, he announced that he too needed an early night.
\par The dormi
tory was empty when he reached it. He rested his forehead for a moment against the cool glass of the window beside his bed; it felt soothing against his scar. Then he undressed and got into bed, wishing his headache would go away. He also felt slightly si
ck. He rolled over on to his side, closed his eyes, and fell asleep almost at once ...
\par He was standing in a dark, curtained room lit by a single branch of candles. His hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of him. They were long-fingered and w
hite as though they had not seen sunlight for years and looked like large, pale spiders against the dark velvet of the chair.
\par Beyond the chair, in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the candles, knelt a man in black robes.
\par \lquote I have been badly advised, it seems,\rquote  said Harry, in a high, cold voice that pulsed with anger.
\par \lquote Master, I crave your pardon,\rquote  croaked the man kneeling on the floor. The back of his head glimmered in the candlelight. He seemed to be trembling.
\par \lquote I do not blame you, Rookwood,\rquote  said Harry in that cold, cruel voice.
\par He relinquished his grip on the chair and walked around it, closer to the man cowering on the floor, until he stood directly over him in the darkness, looking down from a far greater height than usual.
\par \lquote You are sure of your facts, Rookwood?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Yes, My Lord, yes ... I used to work in the Department after \endash  after all ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Bode could never have taken it, Master ... Bode would have known he could not ... undoubtedly, that is why he fought so hard against Malfoy\rquote s Imperius Curse ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Stand up, Rookwood,\rquote  whispered Harry.
\par The kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey. His face was pockmarked; the scars were thrown into relief by the candle\-light. He remained a little stooped when standing, as though halfway through a bow, and he darted terrified looks up at Harry
\rquote s face.
\par \lquote You have done well to tell me this,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Very well ... I have wasted months on fruitless schemes, it seems ... but no matter ... we begin again, from now. You have Lord Voldemort\rquote s grati\-tude, Rookwood ...\rquote 

\par \lquote My Lord ... yes, My Lord,\rquote  gasped Rookwood, his voice hoarse with relief.
\par \lquote I shall need your help. I shall need all the information you can give me.\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course, My Lord, of course ... anything ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Very well ... you may go. Send Avery to me.\rquote 
\par Rookwood scurried backwards, bowing, and disappeared through a door.
\par Left alone in the dark room, Harry turned towards the wall. A cracked, age-spotted mirror hung on the wall in the shadows. Har
ry moved towards it. His reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness ... a face whiter than a skull ... red eyes with slits for pupils ...
\par \lquote NOOOOOOOOO!\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  yelled a voice nearby.
\par Harry flailed around madly, became entangled in the hangings and fell out of his bed. For a few seconds he did not know where he was; he was convinced he was about to see the white, skull\-
like face looming at him out of the dark again, then very near to him Ron\rquote s voice spoke.
\par \lquote Will you stop acting like a maniac so I can get you out of here!\rquote 
\par Ron wrenched the hangings apart and Harry stared up at him in the moonlight, flat on his back, his scar searing with pain. Ron looked as though he had just been getting ready for bed; one arm was out of his robes.

\par \lquote What are you talking about?\rquote  said Ron, sounding scared. \lquote D\rquote you mean ... did you just see You-Know-Who?\rquote 
\par \lquote I was You-Know-Who,\rquote  said Harry, and he stretched out his hands in the darkness and held them up to his face, to check that they were no longer deathly white and long-fingered. \lquote He was with Rookwood, he\rquote

\par \lquote Done what?\rquote 
\par \lquote Remove something ... he said Bode would have known he couldn\rquote t have done it ... Bode was under the Imperius Curse ... I think he said Malfoy\rquote s dad put it on him.\rquote

\par By \lquote they\rquote  he meant Dumbledore. He got back into bed and rolled over on to his side with his back to Ron and after a while he heard Ron\rquote s mattress creak as he, too, lay back down. Harry\rquote s scar began to burn; he bit hard on his
 pillow to stop himself making a noise. Somewhere, he knew, Avery was being punished.

Harry and Ron waited until break next morning to tell Hermione exactly what had happened; they wanted to be absolutely sure they could not be overheard. Standing in the
ir usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard, Harry told her every detail of the dream he could remember. When he had finished, she said nothing at all for a few moments, but stared with a kind of painful inten\-
sity at Fred and George, who were both headless and selling their magical hats from under their cloaks on the other side of the yard.

\par \lquote He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote In the \endash  hang on ...\rquote  he said slowly. \lquote

\par \lquote Sorry?\rquote  said Ron, looking bewildered.
\par \lquote Sturgis Podmore \endash \rquote  said Hermione breathlessly, \lquote arrested for trying to get through a door! Lucius Malfoy must have got him too! I bet he did it the day you saw him there, Harry. Sturgis had Moody\rquote

\par She gazed at Harry.
\par \lquote And now Rookwood\rquote s told Voldemort how to get the weapon?\rquote 
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t hear all the conversation, but that\rquote s what it sounded like,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Rookwood used to work there ... maybe Voldemort\rquote ll send Rookwood to do it?\rquote 
\par Hermione nodded, apparently still lost in thought. Then, quite abruptly, she said, \lquote But you shouldn\rquote t have seen this at all, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  he said, taken aback.
\par \lquote You\rquote re supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing,\rquote  said Hermione, suddenly stern.
\par \lquote I know I am,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote But \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I think we should just try and forget what you saw,\rquote  said Hermione firmly. \lquote And you ought to put in a bit more effort on your Occlumency from now on.\rquote 
\par The week did not improve as it progressed. Harry received two more \lquote D\rquote s in Potions; he was still on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get the sack; and he couldn\rquote t stop himself dwelling on the dream in which he had been Voldemort \endash 
 though he didn\rquote t bring it up with Ron and Hermione again; he didn\rquote t want another telling-off from Hermione. He wished very much that he could have talked to Sirius about it, but that was out of the question, so he tr
ied to push the matter to the back of his mind.
\par Unfortunately, the back of his mind was no longer the secure place it had once been.
\par \lquote Get up, Potter.\rquote 
\par A couple of weeks after his dream of Rookwood, Harry was to be found, yet again, kneeling on the floor of Snape\rquote 
s office, trying to clear his head. He had just been forced, yet again, to relive a stream of very early memories he had not even realised he still had, most of them concerning humiliations Dudley and his gang had inflicted upon him in primary school.

\par \lquote That last memory,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote What was it?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Harry, getting wearily to his feet. He was finding it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the rush of images and sound that Snape kept calling forth. \lquote You mean 
the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Snape softly. \lquote I mean the one with a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room ...\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s ... nothing,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Snape\rquote s dark eyes bored into Harry\rquote s. Remembering what Snape had said about eye contact being crucial to Legilimency, Harry blinked and looked away.
\par \lquote How do that man and that room come to be inside your head, Potter?\rquote  said Snape.
\par \lquote It \endash \rquote  said Harry, looking everywhere but at Snape, \lquote it was \endash  just a dream I had.\rquote 
\par \lquote A dream?\rquote  repeated Snape.
\par There was a pause during which Harry stared fixedly at a large dead frog suspended in a jar of purple liquid.
\par \lquote You do know why we are here, don\rquote t you, Potter?\rquote  said Snape, in a low, dangerous voice. \lquote You do know why I am giving up my evenings to this tedious job?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry stiffly.
\par \lquote Remind me why we are here, Potter.\rquote 
\par \lquote So I can learn Occlumency,\rquote  said Harry, now glaring at a dead eel.
\par \lquote Correct, Potter. And dim though you may be \endash \rquote  Harry looked back at Snape, hating him \lquote \endash 
 I would have thought that after over two months of lessons you might have made some progress. How many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had?\rquote 
\par \lquote Just that one,\rquote  lied Harry.
\par \lquote Perhaps,\rquote  said Snape, his dark, cold eyes narrowing slightly, \lquote perhaps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams, Potter. Maybe they make you feel special \endash  important?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, they don\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry, his jaw set and his fingers clenched tightly around the handle of his wand.
\par \lquote That is just as well, Potter,\rquote  said Snape coldly, \lquote because you are neither special nor important, and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters.\rquote 
\par \lquote No \endash  that\rquote s your job, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  Harry shot at him.
\par He had not meant to say it; it had burst out of him in temper. For a long moment they stared at each other, Harry convinced he had gone too far. But there was a curious, almost satisfied expres\-sion on Snape\rquote s face when he answered.
\par \lquote Yes, Potter,\rquote  he said, his eyes glinting. \lquote That is my job. Now, if you are ready, we will start again.\rquote 
\par He raised his wand: \lquote One \endash  two \endash  three \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Legilimens!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par A hundred Dementors were swooping towards Harry across the lake in the grounds ... he screwed up his face in concentration ... they were coming closer ... he could see the dark holes

\par \lquote ENOUGH!\rquote 
\par Harry felt as though he had been pushed hard in the chest; he staggered several steps backwards, hit some of the shelves covering Snape\rquote s walls and heard something crack. Snape was shaking slightly, and was very white in the face.
\par The back of Harry\rquote s robes was damp. One of the jars behind him had broken when he fell against it; the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in its draining potion.

Well, Potter ... that was certainly an improvement ...\rquote  Panting slightly, Snape straightened the Pensieve in which he had again stored some of his thoughts before starting the lesson, almost as though he was checking they were still there. \lquote 
I don\rquote t remember telling you to use a Shield Charm ... but there is no doubt that it was effective ...\rquote 
\par Harry did not speak; he felt that to say anything might be danger\-ous. He was sure he had just broken into Snape\rquote s memories, that he had just seen scenes from Snape\rquote 
s childhood. It was unnerving to think that the little boy who had been crying as he watched his parents shouting was actually standing in front of him with such loathing in his eyes.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s try again, shall we?\rquote  said Snape.
\par Harry felt a thrill of dread; he was about to pay for what had just happened, he was sure of it. They moved back into position with the desk between them, Harry feeling he was going to find it much harder to empty his mind this time.
\par \lquote On the count of three, then,\rquote  said Snape, raising his wand once more. \lquote One \endash  two \endash \rquote 
\par Harry did not have time to gather himself together and attempt to clear his mind before Snape cried, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Legilimens!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote POTTER!\rquote 
\par Harry opened his eyes. He was flat on his back again with no memory of having got there; he was also panting as though he really had run the length of the Department of Mysteries corridor, really had sprinted throug

\par \lquote Explain yourself!\rquote  said Snape, who was standing over him, looking furious.
\par \lquote I ... dunno what happened,\rquote  said Harry truthfully, standing up. There was a lump on the back of his head from where he had hit the ground and he felt feverish. \lquote I\rquote ve never seen that before. I mean, I told you, I\rquote 
ve dreamed about the door ... but it\rquote s never opened before ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You are not working hard enough!\rquote 
\par For some reason, Snape seemed even angrier than he had done two minutes before, when Harry had seen into his teacher\rquote s mem\-ories.

\lquote Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord? I\rquote ve only ever heard Death Eaters call him that.\rquote 
\par Snape opened his mouth in a snarl \endash  and a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room.
\par Snape\rquote s head jerked upwards; he was gazing at the ceiling.
\par \lquote What the \endash ?\rquote  he muttered.
\par Harry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what he thought might be the Entrance Hall. Snape looked round at him, frowning.
\par \lquote Did you see anything unusual on your way down here, Potter?\rquote 
\par Harry shook his head. Somewhere above them, the woman screamed again. Snape strode to his office door, his wand still held at the ready, and swept out of sight. Harry hesitated for a moment, then followed.
\par The screams were indeed coming from the Entrance Hall; they grew louder as Harry ran towards the stone steps leading up from the dungeons. When he rea
ched the top he found the Entrance Hall packed; students had come flooding out of the Great Hall, where dinner was still in progress, to see what was going on; others had crammed themselves on to the marble staircase. Harry pushed forwards through a knot 
o
f tall Slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a great ring, some of them looking shocked, others even frightened. Professor McGonagall was directly opposite Harry on the other side of the Hall; she looked as though what she was watching made her
 feel faintly sick.
\par Professor Trelawney was standing in the middle of the Entrance Hall with her wand in one hand and an empty sherry bottle in the other, looking utterly mad. Her hair was sticking up on end, her glasses were lopsided so that one eye was ma
gnified more than the other; her innumerable shawls and scarves were trailing haphazardly from her shoulders, giving the impression that she was falling apart at the seams. Two large trunks lay on the floor beside her, one of them upside-down; it looked v
ery much as though it had been thrown down the stairs after her. Professor Trelawney was staring, apparently terrified, at something Harry could not see but which seemed to be standing at the foot of the stairs.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  she shrieked. \lquote NO! This cannot be happening ... it cannot ... I refuse to accept it!\rquote 
\par \lquote You didn\rquote t realise this was coming?\rquote  said a high girlish voice, sounding callously amused, and Harry, moving slightly to his right, saw that Trelawney\rquote s terrifying vision was nothing other than Professor Umbridge. \lquote 
Incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrow\rquote s weather, you must surely have realised that your pitiful performance during my inspections, and lack of any improvement, would make it inevitable that you would be sacked?\rquote 
\par \lquote You c \endash  can\rquote t!\rquote  howled Professor Trelawney, tears streaming down her face from behind her enormous lenses, \lquote you c \endash  can\rquote t sack me! I\rquote ve b \endash  been here sixteen years! H \endash  Hogwarts is m 
\endash  my h \endash  home!\rquote

 said Professor Umbridge, and Harry was revolted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face as she watched Professor Trelawney sink, sobbing uncontrollably, on to one of her trunks, \lquote 
until an hour ago, when the Minister for Magic countersigned your Order of Dismissal. Now kindly remove your\-self from this Hall. You are embarrassing us.\rquote 
\par But she stood and watched, with an expression of gloating enjoy\-ment, as Professor Trelawney shuddered and moaned, rocking back\-wards and forwards on her trunk in paroxysms of grief. Harry heard a muffled sob to his left and
 looked around. Lavender and Parvati were both crying quietly, their arms round each other. Then he heard footsteps. Professor McGonagall had broken away from the spectators, marched straight up to Professor Trelawney and was patting her firmly on the bac
k while withdrawing a large handker\-chief from within her robes.
\par \lquote There, there, Sybill ... calm down ... blow your nose on this ... it\rquote s not as bad as you think, now ... you are not going to have to leave Hogwarts ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh really, Professor McGonagall?\rquote  said Umbridge in a deadly voice, taking a few steps forward. \lquote And your authority for that statement is ...?\rquote 
\par \lquote That would be mine,\rquote  said a deep voice.
\par The oaken front doors had swung open. Students beside them scuttled out of the way as Dumbledore appeared in 
the entrance. What he had been doing out in the grounds Harry could not imagine, but there was something impressive about the sight of him framed in the doorway against an oddly misty night. Leaving the doors wide open behind him he strode forwards throug
h the circle of onlookers towards Professor Trelawney, tear-stained and trembling, on her trunk, Professor McGonagall alongside her.
\par \lquote Yours, Professor Dumbledore?\rquote  said Umbridge, with a singu\-larly unpleasant little laugh. \lquote I\rquote m afraid you do not understand the position. I have here \endash \rquote  she pulled a parchment scroll from within her robes 
\lquote \endash  an Order of Dismissal signed by myself and the Minister for Magic. Under the terms of Educational Decree Number Twenty-three, the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts has the power to inspect, place upon probation and sack any teacher she \endash 
 that is to say, I \endash  feel is not performing to the standards required by the Ministry of Magic. I have decided that Professor Trelawney is not up to scratch. I have dismissed her.\rquote 
\par To Harry\rquote s very great surprise, Dumbledore continued to smile. He looked down at Professor Trelawney, who was still sobbing and choking on her trunk, and said, \lquote 
You are quite right, of course, Professor Umbridge. As High Inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to send them away from the castle. I am afraid,\rquote  he went on, with a courteous little bow, 
\lquote that the power to do that still resides with the Headmaster, and it is my wish that Professor Trelawney con\-tinue to live at Hogwarts.\rquote 
\par At this, Professor Trelawney gave a wild little laugh in which a hiccough was barely hidden.
\par \lquote No \endash  no, I\rquote ll g \endash  go, Dumbledore! I sh \endash  shall \endash  leave Hogwarts and s \endash  seek my fortune elsewhere \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Dumbledore sharply. \lquote It is my wish that you remain, Sybill.\rquote 
\par He turned to Professor McGonagall.
\par \lquote Might I ask you to escort Sybill back upstairs, Professor McGonagall?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course,\rquote  said McGonagall. \lquote Up you get, Sybill ...\rquote 
\par Professor Sprout came hurrying forwards out of the crowd and grabbed Professor Trelawney\rquote 
s other arm. Together, they guided her past Umbridge and up the marble stairs. Professor Flitwick went scurrying after them, his wand held out before him; he squeaked }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Professor Umbridge was standing stock-still, staring at Dumbledore, who continued to smile benignly.
\par \lquote And what,\rquote  she said, in a whisper that carried all around the Entrance Hall, \lquote are you going to do with her once I appoint a new Divination teacher who needs her lodgings?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, that won\rquote t be a problem,\rquote  said Dumbledore pleasantly. \lquote You see, I have already found us a new Divination teacher, and he will prefer lodgings on the ground floor.\rquote

\rquote 
\par He turned to face the open front doors, through which night mist wa
s now drifting. Harry heard hooves. There was a shocked murmur around the Hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even further backwards, some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for the newcomer.
\par Through the mist came a face Harry had seen once before on a dark, dangerous night in the Forbidden Forest: white-blond hair and astonishingly blue eyes; the head and torso of a man joined to the palomino body of a horse.

\par \lquote Not really,\rquote  said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Either way, he\rquote s still got four legs,\rquote  said Hermione coolly. \lquote Anyway, I thought you two were all upset that Trelawney had gone?\rquote 
\par \lquote We are!\rquote  Lavender assured her. \lquote We went up to her office to see her; we took her some daffodils \endash  not the honking ones that Sprout\rquote s got, nice ones.\rquote 
\par \lquote How is she?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Not very good, poor thing,\rquote  said Lavender sympathetically. \lquote She was crying and saying she\rquote d rather leave the castle for ever than stay here where Umbridge is, and I don\rquote t blame her, Umbridge was horrible to her, wasn
\rquote t she?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve got a feeling Umbridge has only just started being horrible,\rquote  said Hermione darkly.
\par \lquote Impossible,\rquote  said Ron, who was tucking into a large plate of eggs and bacon. \lquote She can\rquote t get any worse than she\rquote s been already.\rquote 
\par \lquote You mark my words, she\rquote s going to want revenge on Dumbledore for appointing a new teacher without consulting her,\rquote  said Hermione, closing the newspaper. \lquote 
Especially another part-human. You saw the look on her face when she saw Firenze.\rquote 
\par After breakfast Hermione departed for her Arithmancy class as Harry and Ron followed Parvati and Lavender into the Entrance Hall, heading for Divination.
\par \lquote Aren\rquote t we going up to North Tower?\rquote  asked Ron, looking puzzled, as Parvati bypassed the marble staircase.
\par Parvati looked at him scornfully over her shoulder.
\par \lquote How d\rquote you expect Firenze to climb that ladder? We\rquote re in class\-room eleven now, it was on the noticeboard yesterday.\rquote 
\par Classroom eleven was on the ground floor along the corridor leading off the Entrance Hall from the opposite side to the Great Hall. Harry knew it was one
 of those classrooms that were never used regularly, and therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or storeroom. When he entered it right behind Ron, and found himself in the middle of a forest clearing, he was there\-
fore momentarily stunned.
\par \lquote What the \endash ?\rquote 
\par The classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were growing out of it; their leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and windows, so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft, dappled, green light. The students who had 
already arrived were sitting on the earthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders, arms wrapped around their knees or folded tightly across their chests, and all looking rather nervous. In the middle of the clearing, where there we
re no trees, stood Firenze.
\par \lquote Harry Potter,\rquote  he said, holding out a hand when Harry entered.
\par \lquote Er \endash  hi,\rquote  said Harry, shaking hands with the centaur, who sur\-veyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did not smile. \lquote Er \endash  good to see you.\rquote 
\par \lquote And you,\rquote  said the centaur, inclining his white-blond head. \lquote It was foretold that we would meet again.\rquote 
\par Harry noticed there was the shadow of a hoof-shaped bruise on Firenze\rquote s chest. As he turned to join the rest of the class on the ground, he saw they 
were all looking at him in awe, apparently deeply impressed that he was on speaking terms with Firenze, whom they seemed to find intimidating.
\par When the door was closed and the last student had sat down on a tree stump beside the wastepaper basket, Firenze gestured around the room.
\par \lquote Professor Dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us,\rquote  said Firenze, when everyone had settled down, \lquote in imitation of my natural habitat. I would have preferred to teach you in the Forbidden Forest, which was \endash 
 until Monday \endash  my home ... but that is no longer possible.\rquote 
\par \lquote Please \endash  er \endash  sir \endash \rquote  said Parvati breathlessly, raising her hand, \lquote \endash  why not? We\rquote ve been in there with Hagrid, we\rquote re not frightened!\rquote 
\par \lquote It is not a question of your bravery,\rquote  said Firenze, \lquote but of my position. I cannot return to the Forest. My herd has banished me.\rquote 
\par \lquote Herd?\rquote  said Lavender in a confused voice, and Harry knew she was thinking of cows. \lquote What \endash  oh!\rquote 
\par Comprehension dawned on her face. \lquote There are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 more of you?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \rquote 
 she said, stunned.
\par \lquote Did Hagrid breed you, like the Thestrals?\rquote  asked Dean eagerly.
\par Firenze turned his head very slowly to face Dean, who seemed to realise at once that he had said something very offensive.
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t \endash  I meant \endash  sorry,\rquote  he finished in a hushed voice.
\par \lquote Centaurs are not the servants or playthings of humans,\rquote  said Firenze quietly. There was a pause, then Parvati raised her hand again.
\par \lquote Please, sir ... why have the other centaurs banished you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because I have agreed to work for Professor Dumbledore,\rquote  said Firenze. \lquote They see this as a betrayal of our kind.\rquote 
\par Harry remembered how, nearly four years ago, the centaur Bane had shouted at Firenze for allowing Harry to ride to safety on his back; he had called him a \lquote common mule\rquote . He wondered whether it had been Ba
ne who had kicked Firenze in the chest.
\par \lquote Let us begin,\rquote  said Firenze. He swished his long palomino tail, raised his hand towards the leafy canopy overhead, then lowered it slowly, and as he did so, the light in the room dimmed, so that they now seemed to b
e sitting in a forest clearing by twilight, and stars appeared on the ceiling. There were }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 oohs }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and gasps and Ron said audibly, \lquote Blimey!\rquote 
\par \lquote Lie back on the floor,\rquote  said Firenze in his calm voice, \lquote and observe the heavens. Here is written, for those who can see, the fortune of our races.\rquote 
\par Harry stretched out on his back and gazed upwards at the ceiling. A twinkling red star winked at him from overhead.
\par \lquote I know that you have learned the names of the planets and their moons in Astronomy,\rquote  said Firenze\rquote s calm voice, \lquote and that you have mapped the stars\rquote 
 progress through the heavens. Centaurs have unravelled the mysteries of these movements over centuries. Our findings teach us that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Professor Trelawney did astrology with us!\rquote  said Parvati excit\-edly, raising her hand in front of her so that it stuck up in the air as she lay on her back. \lquote 
Mars causes accidents and burns and things like that, and when it makes an angle to Saturn, like now \endash \rquote  she drew a right-angle in the air above her \lquote \endash  that means people need to be extra careful when handling hot things \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote That,\rquote  said Firenze calmly, \lquote is human nonsense.\rquote 
\par Parvati\rquote s hand fell limply to her side.
\par \lquote Trivial hurts, tiny human accidents,\rquote  said Firenze, as his hooves thudded over the mossy floor. \lquote These are of no more significance than the scurryings of ants to the wide universe, and are unaffected by planetary movements.\rquote 

\par \lquote Professor Trelawney \endash \rquote  began Parvati, in a hurt and indignant voice.
\par \lquote \endash  is a human,\rquote  said Firenze simply. \lquote And is therefore blinkered and fettered by the limitations of your kind.\rquote 
\par Harry turned his head very slightly to look at Parvati. She looked very offended, as did several of the people surrounding her.
\par \lquote Sybill Trelawney may have Seen, I do not know,\rquote  continued Firenze, and Harry heard the swishing of his tail again as he walked up and down before them, \lquote 
but she wastes her time, in the main, on the self-flattering nonsense humans call fortune-telling. I, how\-ever, am here to explain the wisdom of centaurs, which is imper\-
sonal and impartial. We watch the skies for the great tides of evil or change that are sometimes marked there. It may take ten years to be sure of what we are seeing.\rquote 
\par Firenze pointed to the red star directly above Harry.
\par \lquote In the past deca
de, the indications have been that wizardkind is living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars. Mars, bringer of battle, shines brightly above us, suggesting that the fight must soon break out again. How soon, centaurs may attempt to divi
ne by the burning of certain herbs and leaves, by the observation of fume and flame ...\rquote 
\par It was the most unusual lesson Harry had ever attended. They did indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor, and Firenze told them to look for certain shapes and sym\-
bols in the pungent fumes, but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of them could see any of the signs he described, telling them that humans were hardly ever good at this, that it took cen\-taurs years and years to become competent
, and finished by telling them that it was foolish to put too much faith in such things, anyway, because even centaurs sometimes read them wrongly. He was nothing like any human teacher Harry had ever had. His prior\-
ity did not seem to be to teach them what he knew, but rather to impress upon them that nothing, not even centaurs\rquote  knowledge, was foolproof.
\par \lquote He\rquote s not very definite on anything, is he?\rquote  said Ron in a low voice, as they put out their mallowsweet fire. \lquote I mean, I could do with a few more details about this war we\rquote re about to have, couldn\rquote t you?\rquote 

\par The bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone jumped; Harry had completely forgotten they were still inside the castle, and quite convinced that he was really in the Forest. The class filed out, looking slightly perplexed.
\par Harry and Ron were on the point of following them when Firenze called, \lquote Harry Potter, a word, please.\rquote 
\par Harry turned. The centaur advanced a little towards him. Ron hesitated.
\par \lquote You may stay,\rquote  Firenze told him. \lquote But close the door, please.\rquote 
\par Ron hastened to obey.
\par \lquote Harry Potter, you are a friend of Hagrid\rquote s, are you not?\rquote  said the centaur.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry.

\par \lquote But \endash  what\rquote s Hagrid attempting to do?\rquote  said Harry nervously.

Umbridge had continued attending all Care of Magical Creatures lessons, so it had been very difficult to deliver Firenze\rquote s warning to Hagrid. At last, Harry had managed it by pretending he\rquote d lost his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and doubling back after class one day. When he\rquote 
d passed on Firenze\rquote s message, Hagrid gazed at him for a moment through his puffy, blackened eyes, apparently taken aback. Then he seemed to pull himself together.
\par \lquote Nice bloke, Firenze,\rquote  he said gruffly, \lquote but he don\rquote  know what he\rquote s talkin\rquote  abou\rquote  on this. The attemp\rquote s comin\rquote  on fine.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hagrid, what\rquote re you up to?\rquote  asked Harry seriously. \lquote Because you\rquote ve got to be careful, Umbridge has already sacked Trelawney and, if you ask me, she\rquote s on a roll. If you\rquote re doing anything you shouldn\rquote 
t be, you\rquote ll be \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote There\rquote s things more importan\rquote  than keepin\rquote  a job,\rquote  said Hagrid, though his hands shook slightly as he said this and a basin full of Knarl droppings crashed to the floor. \lquote Don\rquote  worry abou\rquote 
 me, Harry, jus\rquote  get along now, there\rquote s a good lad.\rquote 
\par Harry had no choice but to leave Hagrid mopping up the dung all over his floor, but he felt thoroughly dispirited as he trudged back up to the castle.
\par Meanwhile, as the teachers and Hermione persisted in reminding them, the OWLs were drawing ever nearer. All the fifth-years were suffering from stress to some degree, but Hannah Abbott became the first to receive a Calm
ing Draught from Madam Pomfrey after she burst into tears during Herbology and sobbed that she was too stupid to take exams and wanted to leave school now.
\par If it had not been for the DA lessons, Harry thought he would have been extremely unhappy. He someti
mes felt he was living for the hours he spent in the Room of Requirement, working hard but thoroughly enjoying himself at the same time, swelling with pride as he looked around at his fellow DA members and saw how far they had come. Indeed, Harry sometime
s wondered how Umbridge was going to react when all the members of the DA received \lquote Outstanding\rquote  in their Defence Against the Dark Arts OWLs.
\par They had finally started work on Patronuses, which everybody had been very keen to practise, though, as Harry kept reminding them, producing a Patronus in the middle of a brightly lit class\-
room when they were not under threat was very different from producing it when confronted by something like a Dementor.
\par \lquote Oh, don\rquote t be such a killjoy,\rquote  said Cho brightly, watching her sil\-very swan-shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement during their last lesson before Easter. \lquote They\rquote re so pretty!\rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote re not supposed to be pretty, they\rquote re supposed to protect you,\rquote  said Harry patiently. \lquote What we really need is a Boggart or something; that\rquote 
s how I learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while the Boggart was pretending to be a Dementor \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But that would be really scary!\rquote  said Lavender, who was shooting puffs of silver vapour out of the end of her wand. And I still \endash  can\rquote t \endash  do it!\rquote  she added angrily.
\par Neville was having trouble, too. His face was screwed up in con\-centration, but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand-tip.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve got to think of something happy,\rquote  Harry reminded him.
\par \lquote I\rquote m trying,\rquote  said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard his round face was actually shining with sweat.
\par \lquote Harry, I think I\rquote m doing it!\rquote  yelled Seamus, who had been brought along to his first ever DA meeting by Dean. \lquote Look \endash  ah \endash  it\rquote s gone ... but it was definitely something hairy, Harry!\rquote 
\par Hermione\rquote s Patronus, a shining silver otter, was gambolling around her.
\par \lquote They }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 sort of nice, aren\rquote t they?\rquote 
 she said, looking at it fondly.
\par The door of the Room of Requirement opened, and closed. Harry looked round to see who had entered, but there did not seem to be anybody there. It was a few moments before he realised that the people close to the door had fallen silent. Next thing he knew,
 something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee. He looked down and saw, to his very great astonishment, Dobby the house-elf peering up at him from beneath his usual eight woolly hats.
\par \lquote Hi, Dobby!\rquote  he said. \lquote What are you \endash  What\rquote s wrong?\rquote 
\par The elf\rquote 
s eyes were wide with terror and he was shaking. The members of the DA closest to Harry had fallen silent; everybody in the room was watching Dobby. The few Patronuses people had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist, leaving the room looking muc
h darker than before.
\par \lquote Harry Potter, sir ...\rquote  squeaked the elf, trembling from head to foot, \lquote Harry Potter, sir ... Dobby has come to warn you ... but the house-elves have been warned not to tell \'85\rquote 
\par He ran head-first at the wall. Harry, who had some experience of Dobby\rquote 
s habits of self-punishment, made to seize him, but Dobby merely bounced off the stone, cushioned by his eight hats. Hermione and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy.
\par \lquote What\rquote s happened, Dobby?\rquote  Harry asked, grabbing the elf\rquote s tiny arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek to hurt himself.
\par \lquote Harry Potter ... she ... she ...\rquote 
\par Dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist. Harry seized that, too.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s \'93she\'94, Dobby?\rquote 
\par But he thought he knew; surely only one \lquote she\rquote  could induce such fear in Dobby? The elf looked up at him, slightly cross-eyed, and mouthed wordlessly.
\par \lquote Umbridge?\rquote  asked Harry, horrified.
\par Dobby nodded, then tried to bang his head on Harry\rquote s knees. Harry held him at arm\rquote s length.
\par \lquote What about her? Dobby \endash  she hasn\rquote t found out about this \endash  about us \endash  about the DA?\rquote 
\par He read the answer in the elf\rquote s stricken face. His hands held fast by Harry, the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor.
\par \lquote Is she coming?\rquote  Harry asked quietly.
\par Dobby let out a howl, and began beating his bare feet hard on the floor.
\par \lquote Yes, Harry Potter, yes!\rquote 
\par Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf.
\par \lquote WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?\rquote  Harry bellowed. \lquote RUN!\rquote 
\par They al
l pelted towards the exit at once, forming a scrum at the door, then people burst through. Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitories. It was only ten to nine; i
f they just took refuge in the library or the Owlery, which were both nearer \endash 
\par \lquote Harry, come on!\rquote  shrieked Hermione from the centre of the knot of people now fighting to get out.
\par He scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do himself serious injury, and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the queue.
\par \lquote Dobby \endash  this is an order \endash  get back down to the kitchen with the other elves and, if she asks you whether you warned me, lie and say no!\rquote  said Harry. \lquote And I forbid you to hurt yourself!\rquote  he adde
d, dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slammed the door behind him.
\par \lquote Thank you, Harry Potter!\rquote  squeaked Dobby, and he streaked off. Harry glanced left and right, the others were all moving so fast he caught only glimpses of flying
 heels at either end of the corridor before they vanished; he started to run right; there was a boys\rquote  bathroom up ahead, he could pretend he\rquote d been in there all the time if he could just reach it \endash 
\par \lquote AAARGH!\rquote 
\par Something caught him around the ankles and he fell spectacu\-
larly, skidding along on his front for six feet before coming to a halt. Someone behind him was laughing, He rolled over on to his back and saw Malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragon-shaped vase.
\par \lquote Trip Jinx, Potter!\rquote  he said. \lquote Hey, Professor \endash  PROFESSOR! I\rquote ve got one!\rquote 
\par Umbridge came bustling round the far corner, breathless but wearing a delighted smile.
\par \lquote It\rquote s him!\rquote  she said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor. \lquote Excellent, Draco, excellent, oh, very good \endash  fifty points to Slytherin! I\rquote ll take him from here ... stand up, Potter!\rquote 
\par Harry got to his feet, glaring at the pair of them. He had never seen Umbridge looking so happy. She seized his arm in a vice-like grip and turned, beaming broadly, to Malfoy.
\par \lquote You hop along and see if you can round up any more of them, Draco,\rquote  she said. \lquote Tell the others to look in the library \endash  anybody out of breath \endash  check the bathrooms, Miss Parkinson can do the girls\rquote  ones \endash 
 off you go \endash  and you,\rquote  she added in her softest, most dangerous voice, as Malfoy walked away, \lquote you can come with me to the Headmaster\rquote s office, Potter.\rquote 
\par They were at the stone gargoyle within minutes. Harry won\-dered how many of the others had been caught. He thought of Ron \endash  Mrs Weasley would kill him \endash  and of how Hermion
e would feel if she was expelled before she could take her OWLs. And it had been Seamus\rquote s very first meeting ... and Neville had been get\-ting so good ...
\par \lquote Fizzing Whizzbee,\rquote  sang Umbridge; the stone gargoyle jumped aside, the wall behind split open, and t
hey ascended the moving stone staircase. They reached the polished door with the griffin knocker, but Umbridge did not bother to knock, she strode straight inside, still holding tight to Harry.
\par The office was full of people. Dumbledore was sitting behind h
is desk, his expression serene, the tips of his long fingers together. Professor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him, her face extremely tense. Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic, was rocking backwards and forwards on his toes beside the fire, apparently
 
immensely pleased with the situation; Kingsley Shacklebolt and a tough-looking wizard with very short wiry hair whom Harry did not recognise, were positioned either side of the door like guards, and the freckled, bespectacled form of Percy Weasley hovered
 excitedly beside the wall, a quill and a heavy scroll of parchment in his hands, appar\-ently poised to take notes.
\par The portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses were not shamming sleep tonight. All of them were alert and serious, watching what was ha
ppening below them. As Harry entered, a few flitted into neighbouring frames and whispered urgently into their neigh\-bour\rquote s ear.
\par Harry pulled himself free of Umbridge\rquote s grasp as the door swung shut behind them. Cornelius Fudge was glaring at him with a kind of vicious satisfaction on his face.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  he said. \lquote Well, well, well ...\rquote 
\par Harry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster. His heart drummed madly inside him, but his brain was oddly cool and clear.
\par \lquote He was heading back to Gryffindor Tower,\rquote  said Umbridge. There was an indecent excitement in her voice, the same callous pleasure Harry had heard as she watched Professor Trelawney dis\-solving with misery in the Entrance Hall. \lquote 
The Malfoy boy cor\-nered him.\rquote 
\par \lquote Did he, did he?\rquote  said Fudge appreciatively. \lquote I must remember to tell Lucius. Well, Potter ... I expect you know why you are here?\rquote 
\par Harry fully intended to respond with a defiant \lquote yes\rquote : his mouth had opened and the word was half-formed when he caught sight of Dumbledore\rquote s face. Dumbledore was not looking directly at Harry \endash 
 his eyes were fixed on a point just over his shoulder \endash  but as Harry stared at him, he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side.
\par Harry changed direction mid-word.
\par \lquote Ye\emdash no.\rquote 
\par \lquote I beg your pardon?\rquote  said Fudge.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, firmly.
\par \lquote You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 don\rquote t }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 know why you are here?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I don\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Fudge looked incredulously from Harry to Professor Umbridge. Harry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another quick look at Dumbledore, who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods and the shadow of a wink.
\par \lquote So you have no idea,\rquote  said Fudge, in a voice positively sagging with sarcasm, \lquote why Professor Umbridge has brought you to this office? You are not aware that you have broken any school rules?\rquote 
\par \lquote School rules?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote No.\rquote 
\par \lquote Or Ministry Decrees?\rquote  amended Fudge angrily.
\par \lquote Not that I\rquote m aware of,\rquote  said Harry blandly.
\par His heart was still hammering very fast. It was almost worth telling these lies to watch Fudge\rquote s blood pressure rising, but he could not see how on earth he would get away with them; if some\-
body had tipped off Umbridge about the DA then he, the leader, might as well be packing his trunk right now.
\par \lquote So, it\rquote s news to you, is it,\rquote  said Fudge, his voice now thick with anger, \lquote that an illegal student organisation has been discovered within this school?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, it is,\rquote  said Harry, hoisting an unconvincing look of inno\-cent surprise on to his face.
\par \lquote I think, Minister,\rquote  said Umbridge silkily from beside him, \lquote we might make better progress if I fetch our informant.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, yes, do,\rquote  said Fudge, nodding, and he glanced maliciously at Dumbledore as Umbridge left the room. \lquote There\rquote s nothing like a good witness, is there, Dumbledore?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nothing at all, Cornelius,\rquote  said Dumbledore gravely, inclining his head.
\par There was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at each other, then Harry heard the door open behind him. Umbridge moved past him into the room, gripping by the shoulder Cho\rquote 
s curly-haired friend, Marietta, who was hiding her face in her hands.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be scared, dear, don\rquote t be frightened,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge softly, patting her on the back, \lquote it\rquote s quite all right, now. You have done the right thing. The Minister is very pleased with you. He\rquote 
ll be telling your mother what a good girl you\rquote ve been. Marietta\rquote s mother, Minister,\rquote  she added, looking up at Fudge, \lquote is Madam Edgecombe from the Department of Magical Transportation, Floo Network office \endash  she\rquote 
s been helping us police the Hogwarts fires, you know.\rquote 
\par \lquote Jolly good, jolly good!\rquote  said Fudge heartily. \lquote Like mother, like daughter, eh? Well, come on, now, dear, look up, don\rquote t be shy, let\rquote s hear what you\rquote ve got to \endash  galloping gargoyles!\rquote 
\par As Marietta raised her head, Fudge leapt backwards in shock, nearly landing himself in the fire. He cursed, and stamped on the hem
 of his cloak which had started to smoke. Marietta gave a wail and pulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes, but not before everyone had seen that her face was horribly disfigured by a series of close-set purple pustules that had spread across he
r nose and cheeks to form the word \lquote SNEAK\rquote .
\par \lquote Never mind the spots now, dear,\rquote  said Umbridge impatiently, \lquote just take your robes away from your mouth and tell the Minister \endash \rquote 
\par But Marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head frantically.
\par \lquote Oh, very well, you silly girl, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 I\rquote ll}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148  tell him,\rquote 
 snapped Umbridge. She hitched her sickly smile back on to her face and said, \lquote Well, Minister, Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me. Sh
e said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the sev\-enth floor, sometimes known as the Room of Requirement, I would find out something to my advantage. I questioned her a little fur\-
ther and she admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there. Unfortunately, at that point this hex,\rquote  she waved impatiently at Marietta\rquote s concealed face, \lquote 
came into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, now,\rquote  said Fudge, fixing Marietta with what he evidently imagined was a kind and fatherly look, \lquote 
it is very brave of you, my dear, coming to tell Professor Umbridge. You did exactly the right thing. Now, will you tell me what happened at this meeting? What was its purpose? Who was there?\rquote 
\par But Marietta would not speak; she merely shook her head again, her eyes wide and fearful.
\par \lquote Haven\rquote t we got a counter-jinx for this?\rquote  Fudge asked Umbridge impatiently, gesturing at Marietta\rquote s face. \lquote So she can speak freely?\rquote 
\par \lquote I have not yet managed to find one,\rquote  Umbridge admitted grudg\-ingly, and Harry felt a surge of pride in Hermione\rquote s jinxing ability. \lquote But it doesn\rquote t matter if she won\rquote t speak, I can take up the story from here.

\par \lquote You will remember, Minister, that I sent you a report back in October that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog\rquote s Head in Hogsmeade \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote And what is your evidence for that?\rquote  cut in Professor McGonagall.
\par \lquote I have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who hap\-pened to be in the bar at the time. He was heavily bandaged, it is true, but his hearing was quite unimpaired,\rquote  said Umbridge smugly. \lquote 
He heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, so }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 that\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 why he wasn\rquote 
t prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets!\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, raising her eye\-brows. \lquote What an interesting insight into our justice system!\rquote 
\par \lquote Blatant corruption!\rquote  roared the portrait of the corpulent, red-nosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore\rquote s desk. \lquote The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not!\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,\rquote  said Dumbledore softly.
\par \lquote The purpose of Potter\rquote s meeting with these students,\rquote  continued Professor Umbridge, \lquote was to persuade them to join an illegal society, whose a
im was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school-age \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I think you\rquote ll find you\rquote re wrong there, Dolores,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly, peering at her over the half-moon spectacles perched halfway down his crooked nose.
\par Harry stared at him. He could not see how Dumbledore was going to talk him out of this one; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard every word he had said in the Hog\rquote s Head there was simply no escaping it.
\par \lquote Oho!\rquote  said Fudge, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet again. \lquote Yes, do let\rquote s hear the latest cock-and-bull story designed to pull Potter out of trouble! Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on \endash 
 Willy Widdershins was lying, was he? Or was it Potter\rquote s identical twin in the Hog\rquote s Head that day? Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time, a dead man coming back to life and a couple of invisible Dementors?
\rquote 
\par Percy Weasley let out a hearty laugh.
\par \lquote Oh, very good, Minister, very good!\rquote 
\par Harry could have kicked him. Then he saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore was smiling gently, too.
\par \lquote Cornelius, I do not deny \endash  and nor, I am sure, does Harry \endash  that he was in the Hog\rquote 
s Head that day, nor that he was trying to recruit students to a Defence Against the Dark Arts group. I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was, at that time, illegal. If you remember, the Ministry Decree bannin
g all student societies was not put into effect until two days after Harry\rquote s Hogsmeade meeting, so he was not breaking any rules at all in the Hog\rquote s Head.\rquote 
\par Percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by some\-thing very heavy. Fudge remained motionless in mid-bounce, his mouth hanging open.
\par Umbridge recovered first.
\par \lquote That\rquote s all very fine, Headmaster,\rquote  she said, smiling sweetly, \lquote but we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twenty-four. If the first meeting w
as not illegal, all those that have happened since most certainly are.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Dumbledore, surveying her with polite interest over the top of his interlocked fingers, \lquote they certainly }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 would }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 be, if they }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 had }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
continued after the Decree came into effect. Do you have any evidence that any such meetings continued?\rquote 
\par As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather thought Kingsley whispered something. He could have sworn, too, that he felt something brush against his side, a gentle some\-thing l
ike a draught or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there.
\par \lquote Evidence?\rquote  repeated Umbridge, with that horrible wide toad-like smile. \lquote Have you not been listening, Dumbledore? Why do you think Miss Edgecombe is here?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, can she tell us about six months\rquote  worth of meetings?\rquote  said Dumbledore, raising his eyebrows. \lquote I was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight.\rquote 
\par \lquote Miss Edgecombe,\rquote  said Umbridge at once, \lquote tell us how long these meetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your head, I\rquote m sure that won\rquote 
t make the spots worse. Have they been happening regularly over the last six months?\rquote 
\par Harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach. This was it, they had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even Dumbledore would be able to shift aside.
\par \lquote Just nod or shake your head, dear,\rquote  Umbridge said coaxingly to Marietta, \lquote come on, now, that won\rquote t re-activate the jinx.\rquote 
\par Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta\rquote s face. Only her eyes were visible between the pulled-up robes and her curly fringe. Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight, but her eyes looked oddly blank. And then \endash  to Harry\rquote 
s utter amazement \endash  Marietta shook her head.
\par Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge, then back at Marietta.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think you understood the question, did you, dear? I\rquote m asking whether you\rquote ve been going to these meetings for the past six months? You have, haven\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par Again, Marietta shook her head.
\par \lquote What do you mean by shaking your head, dear?\rquote  said Umbridge in a testy voice.
\par \lquote I would have thought her meaning was quite clear,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall harshly, \lquote there have been no secret meetings for the past six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?\rquote 
\par Marietta nodded.
\par \lquote But there was a meeting tonight!\rquote  said Umbridge furiously. \lquote There was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter organised it, Potter \endash  }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 why are you shaking your head, girl?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \rquote 
\par \lquote Well, usually when a person shakes their head,\rquote  said McGonagall coldly, \lquote they mean \'93no\'94. So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of sign-language as yet unknown to humans \endash \rquote 
\par Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her round to face her and began shaking her very hard. A split second later Dumbledore was on hi
s feet, his wand raised; Kingsley started forwards and Umbridge leapt back from Marietta, waving her hands in the air as though they had been burned.
\par \lquote I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores,\rquote  said Dumbledore and, for the first time, he looked angry.
\par \lquote You want to calm yourself, Madam Umbridge,\rquote  said Kingsley, in his deep, slow voice. \lquote You don\rquote t want to get yourself into trouble, now.\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Umbridge breathlessly, glancing up at the towering figure of Kingsley. \lquote I mean, yes \endash  you\rquote re right, Shacklebolt \endash  I \endash  I forgot myself.\rquote 
\par Marietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released her. She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge\rquote s sudden attack, nor relieved by her release; she was still clutching her robe up to her oddly blank eyes and staring straight ahead of her.

\par A sudden suspicion, connected to Kingsley\rquote s whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him, sprang into Harry\rquote s mind.
\par \lquote Dolores,\rquote  said Fudge, with the air of trying to settle something once and for all, \lquote the meeting tonight \endash  the one we know definitely happened \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Umbridge, pulling herself together, \lquote yes ... well, Miss Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh floor, accompanied by certain }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 trustworthy }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 students, so as to catch those in the meeting red-handed. It appears that they were fore\-
warned of my arrival, however, because when we reached the sev\-enth floor they were running in every direction. It does not matter, however. I have all their names here, Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of Requireme
nt for me to see if they had left anything behind. We needed evidence and the room provided.\rquote 
\par And to Harry\rquote s horror, she withdrew from her pocket the list of names that had been pinned upon the Room of Requirement\rquote s wall and handed it to Fudge.
\par \lquote The moment I saw Potter\rquote s name on the list, I knew what we were dealing with,\rquote  she said softly.
\par \lquote Excellent,\rquote  said Fudge, a smile spreading across his face, \lquote excel\-lent, Dolores. And ... by thunder ...\rquote 
\par He looked up at Dumbledore, who was still standing beside Marietta, his wand held loosely in his hand.
\par \lquote See what they\rquote ve named themselves?\rquote  said Fudge quietly. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s Army.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from Fudge. He gazed at the heading scribbled by Hermione months before and for a moment seemed unable to speak. Then he looked up, smiling.
\par \lquote Well, the game is up,\rquote  he said simply. \lquote Would you like a written confession from me, Cornelius \endash  or will a statement before these witnesses suffice?\rquote 
\par Harry saw McGonagall and Kingsley look at each other. There was fear in both faces. He did not understand what was going on, and nor, apparently, did Fudge.
\par \lquote Statement?\rquote  said Fudge slowly. \lquote What \endash  I don\rquote t \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s Army, Cornelius,\rquote  said Dumbledore, still smiling as he waved the list of names before Fudge\rquote s face. \lquote Not Potter\rquote s Army. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote But \endash  but \endash \rquote 
\par Understanding blazed suddenly in Fudge\rquote s face. He took a hor\-rified step backwards, yelped, and jumped out of the fire again.
\par \lquote You?\rquote  he whispered, stamping again on his smouldering cloak.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Dumbledore pleasantly.
\par \lquote You organised this?\rquote 
\par \lquote I did,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote You recruited these students for \endash  for your army?\rquote 
\par \lquote Tonight was supposed to be the first meeting,\rquote  said Dumbledore, nodding. \lquote Merely to see whether they would be interested in joining me. I see now that it was a mistake to invite Miss Edgecombe, of course.\rquote 
\par Marietta nodded. Fudge looked from her to Dumbledore, his chest swelling.
\par \lquote Then you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 have }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 been plotting against me!\rquote  he yelled.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Dumbledore cheerfully.
\par \lquote NO!\rquote  shouted Harry.
\par Kingsley flashed a look of warning at him, McGonagall widened her eyes threateningly, but it had suddenly dawned on Harry what Dumbledore was about to do, and he could not let it happen.
\par \lquote No \endash  Professor Dumbledore \endash !\rquote 
\par \lquote Be quiet, Harry, or I am afraid you will have to leave my office,\rquote  said Dumbledore calmly.
\par \lquote Yes, shut up, Potter!\rquote  barked Fudge, who was still ogling Dumbledore with a kind of horrified delight. \lquote Well, well, well \endash  I came here tonight expecting to expel Potter and instead \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Instead you get to arrest me,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling. \lquote It\rquote s like losing a Knut and finding a Galleon, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Weasley!\rquote  cried Fudge, now positively quivering with delight, \lquote Weasley, have you written it all down, everything he\rquote s said, his confession, have you got it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, sir, I think so, sir!\rquote  said Percy eagerly, whose nose was splat\-tered with ink from the speed of his note-taking.
\par \lquote The bit about how he\rquote s been trying to build up an army against the Ministry, how he\rquote s been working to destabilise me?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, sir, I\rquote ve got it, yes!\rquote  said Percy, scanning his notes joyfully.
\par \lquote Very well, then,\rquote  said Fudge, now radiant with glee, \lquote duplicate your notes, Weasley, and send a copy to the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 at once. If we send a fast owl we should make the morning edition!\rquote  Percy dashed from the room, slamming the door behind him, and Fudge turned back to Dumbledore. \lquote 
You will now be escorted back to the Ministry, where you will be formally charged, then sent to Azkaban to await trial!\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  said Dumbledore gently, \lquote yes. Yes, I thought we might hit that little snag.\rquote 
\par \lquote Snag?\rquote  said Fudge, his voice still vibrating with joy. \lquote I see no snag, Dumbledore!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Dumbledore apologetically, \lquote I\rquote m afraid I do.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, really?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well \endash  it\rquote s just that you seem to be labouring under the delu\-sion that I am going to \endash  what is the phrase? \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 come quietly. }{

 but what a waste of time, and frankly, I can think of a whole host of things I would rather be doing.\rquote 
\par Umbridge\rquote s face was growing steadily redder; she looked as though she was being filled with boiling water. Fudge stared at Dumbledore with a very s
illy expression on his face, as though he had just been stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had happened. He made a small choking noise, then looked round at Kingsley and the man with short grey hair, who alone of everyone in the room 
had remained entirely silent so far. The latter gave Fudge a reassuring nod and moved forwards a little, away from the wall. Harry saw his hand drift, almost casually, towards his pocket.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be silly, Dawlish,\rquote  said Dumbledore kindly. \lquote I\rquote m sure you are an excellent Auror \endash  I seem to remember that you achieved \'93Outstanding\'94 in all your NEWTs \endash  but if you attempt to \endash  er

\par The man called Dawlish blinked rather foolishly. He looked towards Fudge again, but this time seemed to be hoping for a clue as to what to do next.
\par \lquote So,\rquote  sneered Fudge, recovering himself, \lquote you intend to take on Dawlish, Shacklebolt, Dolores and myself single-handed, do you, Dumbledore?\rquote 
\par \lquote Merlin\rquote s beard, no,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling, \lquote not unless you are foolish enough to force me to.\rquote 
\par \lquote He will not be single-handed!\rquote  said Professor McGonagall loudly, plunging her hand inside her robes.
\par \lquote Oh yes he will, Minerva!\rquote  said Dumbledore sharply. \lquote Hogwarts needs you!\rquote 
\par \lquote Enough of this rubbish!\rquote  said Fudge, pulling out his own wand. \lquote Dawlish! Shacklebolt! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Take him!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par A streak of silver light flashed around the room; there was a bang like a gunshot and the floor trembled; a hand grabbed the scruff of Harry\rquote s neck and forced him down on the floor as a second
 silver flash went off; several of the portraits yelled, Fawkes screeched and a cloud of dust filled the air. Coughing in the dust, Harry saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in front of him; there was a shriek and a thud and somebody cried, 
\lquote No!\rquote ; then there was the sound of breaking glass, frantically scuffling footsteps, a groan ... and silence.
\par Harry struggled around to see who was half-strangling him and saw Professor McGonagall crouched beside him; she had forced both him and Marietta out of harm\rquote 
s way. Dust was still floating gently down through the air on to them. Panting slightly, Harry saw a very tall figure moving towards them.
\par \lquote Are you all right?\rquote  Dumbledore asked.
\par \lquote Yes!\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, getting up and dragging Harry and Marietta with her.
\par The dust was clearing. The wreckage of the office loomed into view: Dumbledore\rquote s desk had been overturned, all of the spindly tables had been knocked to the floor, their silver instruments in pieces. Fudge, Umbridge, Kingsley and Dawlish 
lay motionless on the floor. Fawkes the phoenix soared in wide circles above them, singing softly.
\par \lquote Unfortunately, I had to hex Kingsley too, or it would have looked very suspicious,\rquote  said Dumbledore in a low voice. \lquote He was remark\-ably quick on the uptake, modifying Miss Edgecombe\rquote 
s memory like that while everyone was looking the other way \endash  thank him, for me, won\rquote t you, Minerva?
\par \lquote Now, they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do not know that we had time to communicate \endash  you must act as though no time has passed, as though they were merely knocked to the ground, they will not remember \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote Where will you go, Dumbledore?\rquote  whispered Professor McGonagall. \lquote Grimmauld Place?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh no,\rquote  said Dumbledore, with a grim smile, \lquote I am not leaving to go into hiding. Fudge will soon wish he\rquote d never dislodged me from Hogwarts, I promise you.\rquote 
\par \lquote Professor Dumbledore ...\rquote  Harry began.
\par He did not know what to say first: how sorry he was that he had started the DA in the first place and caused all this trouble, or 
how terrible he felt that Dumbledore was leaving to save him from expulsion? But Dumbledore cut him off before he could say another word.
\par \lquote Listen to me, Harry,\rquote  he said urgently. \lquote You must study Occlumency as hard as you can, do you understand me? Do every\-

\par \lquote \endash  you will understand,\rquote  whispered Dumbledore.
\par Fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him. Dumbledore released Harry, raised his hand and grasped the phoenix\rquote s long golden tail. There was a flash of fire and the pair of them were gone.

\par \lquote The stairs!\rquote  cried Dawlish, and he flung 
himself upon the door, wrenched it open and disappeared, followed closely by Kingsley and Umbridge. Fudge hesitated, then got slowly to his feet, brushing dust from his front. There was a long and painful silence.
\par \lquote Well, Minerva,\rquote  said Fudge nastily, straightening his torn shirt\-sleeve, \lquote I\rquote m afraid this is the end of your friend Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote You think so, do you?\rquote  said Professor McGonagall scornfully.
\par Fudge seemed not to hear her. He was looking around at the wrecked office. A few of the portraits hissed at him; one or two even made rude hand gestures.
\par \lquote You\rquote d better get those two off to bed,\rquote  said Fudge, looking back at Professor McGonagall with a dismissive nod towards Harry and Marietta.

\par The notices had gone up all around the school overnight, but they did not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that Dumbledore had overcome two Aurors, the High Inquisitor, the Minister for Magic an
d his Junior Assistant to escape. No matter where Harry went within the castle, the sole topic of conversation was Dumbledore\rquote 
s flight, and though some of the details may have gone awry in the retelling (Harry overheard one second-year girl assuring another that Fudge was now lying in St Mungo\rquote s with a pumpkin for a head) it was surprising how accu\-
rate the rest of their information was. Everybody knew, for instance, that Harry and Marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in Dumbledore\rquote s

A select group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic, hand-picked by Professor Umbridge. Anyway, members of the Inquisitorial Squad }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 do }{

\rquote re a Mudblood, Granger, so ten off for that.\rquote 
\par Ron pulled out his wand, but Hermione pushed it away, whis\-pering, \lquote Don\rquote t!\rquote 
\par \lquote Wise move, Granger,\rquote  breathed Malfoy. \lquote New Head, new times ... be good now, Potty ... Weasel King ...\rquote 
\par Laughing heartily, he strode away with Crabbe and Goyle.
\par \lquote He was bluffing,\rquote  said Ernie, looking appalled. \lquote He can\rquote t be allowed to dock points ... that would be ridiculous ... it would completely undermine the prefect system.\rquote 
\par But Harry, Ron and Hermione had turned automatically towards the giant hour-glasses set in niches along the wall behind them, which recorded the house-points. Gryffindor and Ravenclaw had been neck and neck in the lead th
at morning. Even as they watched, stones flew upwards, reducing the amounts in the lower bulbs. In fact, the only glass that seemed unchanged was the emerald-filled one of Slytherin.
\par \lquote Noticed, have you?\rquote  said Fred\rquote s voice.
\par He and George had just come down the marble staircase and joined Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ernie in front of the hour-glasses.
\par \lquote Malfoy just docked us all about fifty points,\rquote  said Harry furi\-ously, as they watched several more stones fly upwards from the Gryffindor hour-glass.
\par \lquote Yeah, Montague tried to do us during break,\rquote  said George.
\par \lquote What do you mean, \'93tried\'94?\rquote  said Ron quickly.
\par \lquote He never managed to get all the words out,\rquote  said Fred, \lquote due to the fact that we forced him head-first into that Vanishing Cabinet on the first floor.\rquote 
\par Hermione looked very shocked.
\par \lquote But you\rquote ll get into terrible trouble!\rquote 
\par \lquote Not until Montague reappears, and that could take weeks, I dunno where we sent him,\rquote  said Fred coolly. \lquote Anyway ... we\rquote ve decided we don\rquote t care about getting into trouble any more.\rquote 
\par \lquote Have you ever?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote Course we have,\rquote  said George. \lquote Never been expelled, have we?\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote ve always known where to draw the line,\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote We might have put a toe across it occasionally,\rquote  said George.
\par \lquote But we\rquote ve always stopped short of causing real mayhem,\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote But now?\rquote  said Ron tentatively.
\par \lquote Well, now \endash \rquote  said George.
\par \lquote \endash  what with Dumbledore gone \endash \rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote \endash  we reckon a bit of mayhem \endash \rquote  said George.
\par \lquote \endash  is exactly what our dear new Head deserves,\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote You mustn\rquote t!\rquote  whispered Hermione. \lquote You really mustn\rquote t! She\rquote d love a reason to expel you!\rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t get it, Hermione, do you?\rquote  said Fred, smiling at her. \lquote We don\rquote t care about staying any more. We\rquote d walk out right now if we weren\rquote t determined to do our bit for Dumbledore first. So, anyway,
\rquote  he checked his watch, \lquote phase one is about to begin. I\rquote d get in the Great Hall for lunch, if I were you, that way the teachers will see you can\rquote t have had anything to do with it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Anything to do with what?\rquote  said Hermione anxiously.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll see,\rquote  said George. \lquote Run along, now.\rquote 
\par Fred and George turned away and disappeared into the swelling crowd descending the stairs towards lunch. Looking highly discon\-certed, Ernie muttered something about unfinished Transfiguration homework and scurried away.
\par \lquote I think we }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 should }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 get out of here, you know,\rquote 
 said Hermione nervously. \lquote Just in case ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, all right,\rquote  said Ron, and the three of them moved towards the doors to the Great Hall, but Harry had barely glimpsed the day\rquote s ceiling of 
scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoulder and, turning, he found himself almost nose-to-nose with Filch the caretaker. He took several hasty steps back\-wards; Filch was best viewed at a distance.
\par \lquote The Headmistress would like to see you, Potter,\rquote  he leered.
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t do it,\rquote  said Harry stupidly, thinking of whatever Fred and George were planning. Filch\rquote s jowls wobbled with silent laughter.
\par \lquote Guilty conscience, eh?\rquote  he wheezed. \lquote Follow me.\rquote 
\par Harry glanced back at Ron and Hermione, who were both looking worried. He shrugged, and followed Filch back into the Entrance Hall, against the tide of hungry students.
\par Filch seemed to be in an extremely good mood; he hummed creakily under his breath as they climbed the marble staircase. As they reached the first landing he said, \lquote Things are changing around here, Potter.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve noticed,\rquote  said Harry coldly.
\par \lquote Yerse ... I\rquote ve been telling Dumbledore for years and years he\rquote s too soft with you all,\rquote  said Filch, chuckling nastily. \lquote You filthy little beasts would never have dropped Stink Pellets if you\rquote 
d known I had it in my power to whip you raw, would you, now? Nobody would have thought of throwing Fanged Frisbees down the corri\-dors if I could\rquote ve strung you up by
 the ankles in my office, would they? But when Educational Decree Number Twenty-nine comes in, Potter, I\rquote ll be allowed to do them things ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par Umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get Filch on her side, Harry thought, and the worst of it was that he would probably prove an important weapon; his knowledge of the school\rquote s secret passageways and hid
ing places was probably second only to that of the Weasley twins.
\par \lquote Here we are,\rquote  he said, leering down at Harry as he rapped three times on Professor Umbridge\rquote s door and pushed it open. \lquote The Potter boy to see you, Ma\rquote am.\rquote 
\par Umbridge\rquote s office, so very familiar to Harry from his many deten\-
tions, was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying across the front of her desk on which golden letters spelled the word: HEADMISTRESS. Also, his Firebolt and Fred and George\rquote s Cleansweeps, which he saw with
 a pang, were chained and pad\-locked to a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk.
\par Umbridge was sitting behind the desk, busily scribbling on some of her pink parchment, but she looked up and smiled widely at their entrance.
\par \lquote Thank you, Argus,\rquote  she said sweetly.
\par \lquote Not at all, Ma\rquote am, not at all,\rquote  said Filch, bowing as low as his rheumatism would permit, and exiting backwards.
\par \lquote Sit,\rquote  said Umbridge curtly, pointing towards a chair. Harry sat. She continued to scribble for a few moments. He watched some of th
e foul kittens gambolling around the plates over her head, wondering what fresh horror she had in store for him.
\par \lquote Well, now,\rquote  she said finally, setting down her quill and looking like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly. \lquote What would you like to drink?\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry, quite sure he had misheard her.
\par \lquote To drink, Mr Potter,\rquote  she said, smiling still more widely. \lquote Tea? Coffee? Pumpkin juice?\rquote 
\par As she named each drink, she gave her short wand a wave, and a cup or glass of it appeared on her desk.
\par \lquote Nothing, thank you,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote I wish you to have a drink with me,\rquote  she said, her voice becoming dangerously sweet. \lquote Choose one.\rquote 
\par \lquote Fine ... tea then,\rquote  said Harry, shrugging.
\par She got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with her back to him. She then bustled around the desk with it, smiling in a sinisterly sweet fashion.
\par \lquote There,\rquote  she said, handing it to him. \lquote Drink it before it gets cold, won\rquote t you? Well, now, Mr Potter ... I thought we ought to have a little chat, after the distressing events of last night.\rquote 
\par He said nothing. She settled herself back into her seat and waited. When several long moments had passed in silence, she said gaily, \lquote You\rquote re not drinking up!\rquote 
\par He raised the cup to his lips and then, just as suddenly, low\-ered it. One of the horrible painted kittens behind Umbridge had great round blue eyes just like Mad-Eye Moody\rquote 
s magical one and it had just occurred to Harry what Mad-Eye would say if he ever heard that Harry had drunk anything offered by a known enemy.
\par \lquote What\rquote s the matter?\rquote  said Umbridge, who was still watching him. \lquote Do you want sugar?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry.
\par He raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip, though keeping his mouth tightly closed. Umbridge\rquote s smile widened.
\par \lquote Good,\rquote  she whispered. \lquote Very good. Now then ...\rquote  She leaned forwards a little. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Where is Albus Dumbledore?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par \lquote No idea,\rquote  said Harry promptly.
\par \lquote Drink up, drink up,\rquote  she said, still smiling. \lquote 
Now, Mr Potter, let us not play childish games. I know that you know where he has gone. You and Dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning. Consider your position, Mr Potter ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know where he is.\rquote 
\par Harry pretended to drink again.
\par \lquote Very well,\rquote  said Umbridge, looking displeased. \lquote In that case, you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s stomach turned over and his hand holding the teacup shook so that it rattled in its saucer. He tilted the cup to his mouth with his lips pressed together, so that some of the hot liquid trickled down on to his robes.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  he said, a little too quickly.
\par \lquote Mr Potter,\rquote  said Umbridge, \lquote let me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire i
n October. I know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if I had had any proof neither of you would be at large today, I promise you. I repeat, Mr Potter ... where is Sirius Black?\rquote 
\par \lquote No idea,\rquote  said Harry loudly. \lquote Haven\rquote t got a clue.\rquote 
\par They stared at each other so long that Harry felt his eyes watering. Then Umbridge stood up.
\par \lquote Very well, Potter, I will take your word for it this time, but be warned: the might of the Ministry stands behind me. All channels of communication in and out of this school are
 being monitored. A Floo Network Regulator is keeping watch over every fire in Hogwarts \endash 
 except my own, of course. My Inquisitorial Squad is opening and reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle. And Mr Filch is observing all secret passages in and out of the castle. If I find a shred of evidence ...\rquote 
\par BOOM!
\par The very floor of the office shook. Umbridge slipped sideways, clutching her desk for support, and looking shocked.
\par \lquote What was \endash ?\rquote 
\par She was gazing towards the door. Harry took the opportunity to empty his almost-full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers. He could hear people running and screaming several floors below.
\par \lquote Back to lunch you go, Potter!\rquote  cried Umbridge, raising her wand and dashing out of the office. Harry gave her a few seconds\rquote  start, then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar was.
\par It was not difficult to find. One floor down, pandemonium reigned. Somebody (and Harry had a very shrewd idea who) had set off what seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks.
\par Dragons comprised entirely of green and gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors, emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went; shocking-pink Catherine wheels five feet in diam\-eter were whizzing lethally through the air lik
e so many flying saucers; rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were rico\-cheting off the walls; sparklers were writing swear words in midair of their own accord; firecrackers were exploding like mines every\-
where Harry looked, and instead of burning themselves out, fading from sight or fizzling to a halt, these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched.
\par Filch and Umbridge were standing, apparently transfixed in horror, halfway down the stairs. As H
arry watched, one of the larger Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more room to manoeuvre; it whirled towards Umbridge and Filch with a sinister \lquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par A jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the rockets. Instead of freezing in midair, it exploded with such force that it blasted a hole in a painting of a soppy-looking witch in the middle of a meadow; she ran for it just in time,
 reappearing seconds later squashed into the next painting, where a couple of wizards playing cards stood up hastily to make room for her.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t Stun them, Filch!\rquote  shouted Umbridge angrily, for all the world as though it had been his incantation.
\par \lquote Right you are, Headmistress!\rquote 
 wheezed Filch, who as a Squib could no more have Stunned the fireworks than swallowed them. He dashed to a nearby cupboard, pulled out a broom and began swatting at the fireworks in midair; within seconds the head of the broom was ablaze.
\par Harry had seen enough; laughing, he ducked down low, ran to a door he knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the corridor and slipped through it to find Fred and George hiding just behind it, listening to Umbridge and Filch\rquote

\par \lquote Impressive,\rquote  Harry said quietly, grinning. \lquote Very impressive ... you\rquote ll put Dr Filibuster out of business, no problem ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Cheers,\rquote  whispered George, wiping tears of laughter from his face. \lquote Oh, I hope she tries Vanishing them next ... they multiply by ten every time you try.\rquote 
\par The fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school that afternoon. Though they caused plenty of disruption, particularly the firecrackers, the other teachers didn\rquote t seem to mind them very much.
\par \lquote Dear, dear,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall sardonically, as one of the dragons soared around her classroom, emitting loud bangs and exhaling flame. \lquote 
Miss Brown, would you mind running along to the Headmistress and informing her that we have an escaped fire\-work in our classroom?\rquote 
\par The upshot of it all was that Professor Umbridge spent her first afternoon as Headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers, none of whom seemed able to rid their rooms of the firework
s without her. When the final bell rang and they were heading back to Gryffindor Tower with their bags, Harry saw, with immense satisfaction, a dishevelled and soot-blackened Umbridge tottering sweaty-faced from Professor Flitwick\rquote s classroom.

\par \lquote Thank you so much, Professor!\rquote  said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice. \lquote I could have got rid of the sparklers myself, of course, but I wasn\rquote t sure whether or not I had the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Fred and George were heroes that night in the Gryffindor common room. Even Hermione fought her way through the excited crowd to congratulate them.
\par \lquote They were wonderful fireworks,\rquote  she said admiringly.
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  said George, looking both surprised and pleased. \lquote Weasleys\rquote  Wildfire Whiz-bangs. Only thing is, we used our whole stock; we\rquote re going to have to start again from scratch now.\rquote

\par He got into bed, yawning. With his glasses off, the occasional firework passing the window had become blurred, looking like sparkling clouds, beautiful and
 mysterious against the black sky. He turned on to his side, wondering how Umbridge was feeling about her first day in Dumbledore\rquote

\par Harry heard Ron and Dean scramble out of bed for a better look. He lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar sub\-

\par Glittering pink and silver 
winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of Gryffindor Tower. Harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them. His stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had Occlumency the following e

\par \lquote Go and cope with it then!\rquote  Cho said furiously, turning on her heel and stalking off.
\par Fuming, Harry descended the stairs to Snape\rquote s dungeon and, though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for Snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful, he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more thing
s he should have said to Cho about Marietta before reaching the dun\-geon door.
\par \lquote You\rquote re late, Potter,\rquote  said Snape coldly, as Harry closed the door behind him.
\par Snape was standing with his back to Harry, removing, as usual, certain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in Dumbledore\rquote s Pensieve. He dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and turned to face Harry.
\par \lquote So,\rquote  he said. \lquote Have you been practising?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  Harry lied, looking carefully at one of the legs of Snape\rquote s desk.
\par \lquote Well, we\rquote ll soon find out, won\rquote t we?\rquote  said Snape smoothly. \lquote Wand out, Potter.\rquote 
\par Harry moved into his usual position, facing Snape with the desk between them. His heart was pumping fast with anger at Cho and anxiety about how much Snape was about to extract from his mind.
\par \lquote On the count of three then,\rquote  said Snape lazily. \lquote One \endash  two \endash \rquote 
\par Snape\rquote s office door banged open and Draco Malfoy sped in.
\par \lquote Professor Snape, sir \endash  oh \endash  sorry \endash \rquote 
\par Malfoy was looking at Snape and Harry in some surprise.
\par \lquote It\rquote s all right, Draco,\rquote  said Snape, lowering his wand. \lquote Potter is here for a little remedial Potions.\rquote 
\par Harry had not seen Malfoy look so gleeful since Umbridge had turned up to inspect Hagrid.
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t know,\rquote  he said, leering at Harry, who knew his face was burning. He would have given a great deal to be able to shout the truth at Malfoy \endash  or, even better, to hit him with a good curse.
\par \lquote Well, Draco, what is it?\rquote  asked Snape.
\par \lquote It\rquote s Professor Umbridge, sir \endash  she needs your help,\rquote  said Malfoy. \lquote They\rquote ve found Montague, sir, he\rquote s turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor.\rquote 
\par \lquote How did he get in there?\rquote  demanded Snape.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know, sir, he\rquote s a bit confused.\rquote 
\par \lquote Very well, very well. Potter,\rquote  said Snape, \lquote we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening.\rquote 
\par He turned and swept from his office. Malfoy mouthed, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Remedial Potions?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\rquote  at Harry behind Snape\rquote s back before following him.
\par Seething, Harry replaced his wand inside his robes and made to leave the room. At least he had twenty-four more hours in which to practise; he knew he ought to feel grateful fo
r the narrow escape, though it was hard that it came at the expense of Malfoy telling the whole school that he needed remedial Potions.
\par He was at the office door when he saw it: a patch of shivering light dancing on the doorframe. He stopped, and stood loo
king at it, reminded of something ... then he remembered: it was a little like the lights he had seen in his dream last night, the lights in the second room he had walked through on his journey through the Department of Mysteries.
\par He turned around. The light was coming from the Pensieve sit\-ting on Snape\rquote s desk. The silver-white contents were ebbing and swirling within. Snape\rquote s thoughts ... things he did not want Harry to see if he broke through Snape\rquote 
s defences accidentally ...
\par Harry gazed at the Pensieve, curiosity welling inside him ... what was it that Snape was so keen to hide from Harry?
\par The silvery lights shivered on the wall ... Harry took two steps towards the desk, thinking hard. Could it possibly be information about the Department of Mysteries that Snape was determined to keep from him?
\par Harry looked over his shoulder, his heart now pumping harder and faster than ever. How long would it take Snape to release Montague from the toilet? Would he come straight back to his office afterwards, or accompan
y Montague to the hospital wing? Surely the latter ... Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, Snape would want to make sure he was all right.
\par Harry walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve and stood over it, gazing into its depths. He hesitated, listening, then pulled out his wand again. The office and the corridor beyond were com\-
pletely silent. He gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand.
\par The silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast. Harry leaned forwards over it and saw that it had become transparent. He was, once again, looking down into a room as though through a cir\-cular window in the ceiling ... in fact, unless he was much mis
\-taken, he was looking down into the Great Hall.
\par His breath was actually fogging the surface of Snape\rquote 
s thoughts ... his brain seemed to be in limbo ... it would be insane to do the thing he was so strongly tempted to do ... he was trembling ... Snape could be back at any moment ... but Harry thought of Cho\rquote s anger, of Malfoy\rquote 
s jeering face, and a reckless daring seized him.
\par He took a great gulp of breath, and plunged his face into the surface of Snape\rquote s thoughts. At once, the floor of the office lurched, tipping Harry head-first into the Pensieve ...
\par He was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as he went, and then \endash 
\par He was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four house tables were gone. Instead, there were more than a hundred smaller tables, all facing the same way, at each of which sat a stu\-dent,
 head bent low, scribbling on a roll of parchment. The only sound was the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted their parchment. It was clearly exam time.
\par Sunshine was streaming through the high windows on to the bent heads, which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light. Harry looked around carefully. Snape had to be here somewhere ... this was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 his }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 memory ...
\par And there he was, at a table right behind Harry. Harry stared. Snape-the-teenager had a stringy, pallid look about him, like a plant kept in the dark. His hair was lank and greasy and was flop\-
ping on to the table, his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as he scribbled. Harry moved around behind Snape and read the heading of the examination paper: DEFENCE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS \endash  ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL.

\par So Snape had to be fifteen or sixteen, around Harry\rquote s own age. His hand was flying across the parchment; he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbours, and yet his writing was minuscule and cramped.
\par \lquote Five more minutes!\rquote 
\par The voice made Harry jump. Turning, he saw the top of Professor Flitwick\rquote s head moving between the desks a short distance away. Professor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair ... very untidy black hair ...
\par Harry moved so quickly that, had he been solid, he would have knocked desks flying. Instead he seemed to slide, dreamlike, across two aisles and up a third. The back of the black-haired boy\rquote s head drew nearer and ... he was 
straightening up now, putting down his quill, pulling his roll of parchment towards him so as to reread what he had written ...
\par Harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteen-year-old father.
\par Excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach: it was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes. James\rquote s eyes were hazel, his nose was slightly longer than Harry\rquote 
s and there was no scar on his forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same eyebrows; James\rquote s hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry\rquote s did, his hands could have been Harry\rquote 
s and Harry could tell that, when James stood up, they would be within an inch of each other in height.
\par James yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair, making it even messier than it had been. Then, with a glance towards Professor Flitwick, he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats behind him.
\par With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease, tilting it back on two legs. He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James
\rquote s nor Harry\rquote s could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, though he didn\rquote t seem to have noticed. And two seats along from this girl \endash  Harry\rquote 
s stomach gave another pleasurable squirm \endash  was Remus Lupin. He looked rather pale and peaky (was the full moon approaching?) and was absorbed in the exam: as he reread his answers, he scratched his chin 
with the end of his quill, frowning slightly.
\par So that meant Wormtail had to be around here somewhere, too ... and sure enough, Harry spotted him within seconds: a small, mousy-haired boy with a pointed nose. Wormtail looked anxious; he was chewing his fing
ernails, staring down at his paper, scuffing the ground with his toes. Every now and then he glanced hope\-fully at his neighbour\rquote 
s paper. Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment, then back at James, who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment. He had drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters \lquote L.E.\rquote . What did they stand for?
\par \lquote Quills down, please!\rquote  squeaked Professor Flitwick. \lquote That means you too, Stebbins! Please remain seated while I collect your parch\-ment! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Accio!}
{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \rquote 
\par Over a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and into Professor Flitwick\rquote 
s outstretched arms, knocking him backwards off his feet. Several people laughed. A couple of students at the front desks got up, took hold of Professor Flitwick beneath the elbows and lifted him back on to his feet.
\par \lquote Thank you ... thank you,\rquote  panted Professor Flitwick. \lquote Very well, everybody, you\rquote re free to go!\rquote 
\par Harry looked down at his father, who had hastily crossed out the \lquote L.E.\rquote  he had been embellishing, jumped to his feet, stuffed his quill and the exam paper into his bag, which he slung over his back, and stood waiting for Sirius to join him.

\par Harry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away, moving between the tables towards the doors to the Entrance Hall, still absorbed in his own exam paper. Rou
nd-shouldered yet angular, he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, and his oily hair was jumping about his face.
\par A gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James, Sirius and Lupin, and by planting himself in their midst, Harry managed to keep Snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of James and his friends.
\par \lquote Did you like question ten, Moony?\rquote  asked Sirius as they emerged into the Entrance Hall.
\par \lquote Loved it,\rquote  said Lupin briskly. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Give five signs that identify the werewolf. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote D\rquote you think you managed to get all the signs?\rquote  said James in tones of mock concern.
\par \lquote Think I did,\rquote  said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds. \lquote One: he\rquote s sitting on my chair. Two: he\rquote s wearing my clothes. Three: his name
\rquote s Remus Lupin.\rquote 
\par Wormtail was the only one who didn\rquote t laugh.
\par \lquote I got the snout shape, the pupils of the eyes and the tufted tail,\rquote  he said anxiously, \lquote but I couldn\rquote t think what else \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote How thick are you, Wormtail?\rquote  said James impatiently. \lquote You run round with a werewolf once a month \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Keep your voice down,\rquote  implored Lupin.
\par Harry looked anxiously behind him again. Snape remained close by, still buried in his exam questions \endash  but this was Snape\rquote 
s memory and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds, he, Harry, would not be able to follow James any further. To his intense relief, however, when James and his three friends strode off down
 the lawn towards the lake, Snape followed, still poring over the exam paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going. By keeping a little ahead of him, Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others.
\par \lquote Well, I thought that paper was a piece of cake,\rquote  he heard Sirius say. \lquote I\rquote ll be surprised if I don\rquote t get \'93Outstanding\'94 on it at least.\rquote 
\par \lquote Me too,\rquote  said James. He put his hand in his pocket and took out a struggling Golden Snitch.
\par \lquote Where\rquote d you get that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nicked it,\rquote  said James casually. He started playing with the Snitch, allowing it to fly as much as a foot away before seizing it again; his reflexes were excellent. Wormtail watched him in awe.
\par They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where Har
ry, Ron and Hermione had once spent a Sunday finishing their homework, and threw themselves down on the grass. Harry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw, to his delight, that Snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadow of a clump of 
b
ushes. He was as deeply immersed in the OWL paper as ever, which left Harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree. The sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake, on the bank of w
hich the group of laughing girls who had just left the Great Hall were sitting, with their shoes and socks off, cooling their feet in the water.
\par Lupin had pulled out a book and was reading. Sirius stared around at the students milling over the grass, looking rather haughty and bored, but very handsomely so. James was still playing with the Snitch, letting it zoom further and further away, almost e
scaping but always grabbed at the last second. Wormtail was watching him with his mouth open. Every time James made a particularly difficult catch, Wormtail gasped and applauded. After five minutes of this, Harry wondered why James didn\rquote 
t tell Wormtail to get a grip on himself, but James seemed to be enjoying the attention. Harry noticed that his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to keep it from getting too tidy, and he also kept looking over at the girls by the water
\rquote s edge.
\par \lquote Put that away, will you,\rquote  said Sirius finally, as James made a fine catch and Wormtail let out a cheer, \lquote before Wormtail wets himself with excitement.\rquote 
\par Wormtail turned slightly pink, but James grinned.
\par \lquote If it bothers you,\rquote  he said, stuffing the Snitch back in his pocket. Harry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only one for whom James would have stopped showing off.
\par \lquote I\rquote m bored,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote Wish it was full moon.\rquote 
\par \lquote You might,\rquote  said Lupin darkly from behind his book. \lquote We\rquote ve still got Transfiguration, if you\rquote re bored you could test me. Here ...\rquote  and he held out his book.
\par But Sirius snorted. \lquote I don\rquote t need to look at that rubbish, I know it all.\rquote 
\par \lquote This\rquote ll liven you up, Padfoot,\rquote  said James quietly. \lquote Look who it is ...\rquote 
\par Sirius\rquote s head turned. He became very still, like a dog that has scented a rabbit.
\par \lquote Excellent,\rquote  he said softly. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Snivellus.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \rquote 
\par Harry turned to see what Sirius was looking at.
\par Snape was on his feet again, and was stowing the OWL paper in his bag. As he left the shadows of the bushes and set off across the grass, Sirius and James stood up.
\par Lupin and Wormtail remained sitting: Lupin was still staring down at his book, though his eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his eyebrows; Wormtail was looking from Sirius and James to Snape with a look of avid anti\-
cipation on his face.
\par \lquote All right, Snivellus?\rquote  said James loudly.
\par Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack: dropping his bag, he plunged his hand inside his robes and his wand was halfway into the air when James shouted, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Expelliarmus!}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \rquote 
\par Snape\rquote s wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud in the grass behind him. Sirius let out a bark of laughter.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Impedimenta!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
he said, pointing his wand at Snape, who was knocked off his feet halfway through a dive towards his own fallen wand.
\par Students all around had turned to watch. Some of them had got to their feet and were edging nearer. Some looked apprehensive, others entertained.
\par Snape lay panting on the ground. James and Sirius advanced on him, wands raised, James glancing over his shoulder at the girls at the water\rquote 
s edge as he went. Wormtail was on his feet now, watching hungrily, edging around Lupin to get a clearer view.
\par \lquote How\rquote d the exam go, Snivelly?\rquote  said James.
\par \lquote I was watching him, his nose was touching the parchment,\rquote  said Sirius viciously. \lquote There\rquote ll be great grease marks all over it, they won\rquote t be able to read a word.\rquote 
\par Several people watching laughed; Snape was clearly unpopular. Wormtail sniggered shrilly. Snape was trying to get up, but the jinx was still operating on him; he was struggling, as though bound by invisible ropes.
\par \lquote You \endash  wait,\rquote  he panted, staring up at James with an expression of purest loathing, \lquote you \endash  wait!\rquote 
\par \lquote Wait for what?\rquote  said Sirius coolly. \lquote What\rquote re you going to do, Snivelly, wipe your nose on us?\rquote 
\par Snape let out a stream of mixed swear words and hexes, but with his wand ten feet away nothing happened.
\par \lquote Wash out your mouth,\rquote  said James coldly. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Scourgify!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 

\par Pink soap bubbles streamed from Snape\rquote s mouth at once; the froth was covering his lips, making him gag, choking him \endash 
\par \lquote Leave him ALONE!\rquote 
\par James and Sirius looked round. James\rquote s free hand immediately jumped to his hair.
\par It was one of the girls from the lake edge. She had thick, dark red hair that fell to her shoulders, and startlingly green almond-shaped eyes \endash  Harry\rquote s eyes.
\par Harry\rquote s mother.
\par \lquote All right, Evans?\rquote  said James, and the tone of his voice was sud\-denly pleasant, deeper, more mature.
\par \lquote Leave him alone,\rquote  Lily repeated. She was looking at James with every sign of great dislike. \lquote What\rquote s he done to you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said James, appearing to deliberate the point, \lquote it\rquote s more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean ...\rquote 
\par Many of the surrounding students laughed, Sirius and Wormtail included, but Lupin, still apparently intent on his book, didn\rquote t, and nor did Lily.
\par \lquote You think you\rquote re funny,\rquote  she said coldly. \lquote But you\rquote re just an arro\-gant, bullying toerag, Potter. Leave him }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 alone.}{\rtlch\fcs1

\par \lquote I will if you go out with me, Evans,\rquote  said James quickly. \lquote Go on ... go out with me and I\rquote ll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again.\rquote 
\par Behind him, the Impediment Jinx was wearing off. Snape was beginning to inch towards his fallen wand, spitting out soapsuds as he crawled.
\par \lquote I wouldn\rquote t go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid,\rquote  said Lily.
\par \lquote Bad luck, Prongs,\rquote  said Sirius briskly, and turned back to Snape. \lquote OI!\rquote 
\par But too late; Snape had directed his wand straight at James; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James\rquote 
s face, spattering his robes with blood. James whirled about: a second flash of light later, Snape was hanging upside-down in the air, his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny, pallid legs and a pair of greying underpants.
\par Many people in the small crowd cheered; Sirius, James and Wormtail roared with laughter.
\par Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile, said, \lquote Let him down!\rquote 
\par \lquote Certainly,\rquote  said James and he jerked his wand upwards; Snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ground. Disentangling himself from his robes he got quickly to his feet, wand up, but Sirius said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Petrificus Totalus!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and Snape keeled over again, rigid as a board.
\par \lquote LEAVE HIM ALONE!\rquote  Lily shouted. She had her own wand out now. James and Sirius eyed it warily.
\par \lquote Ah, Evans, don\rquote t make me hex you,\rquote  said James earnestly.
\par \lquote Take the curse off him, then!\rquote 
\par James sighed deeply, then turned to Snape and muttered the counter-curse.
\par \lquote There you go,\rquote  he said, as Snape struggled to his feet. \lquote You\rquote re lucky Evans was here, Snivellus \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her!\rquote 
\par Lily blinked.
\par \lquote Fine,\rquote  she said coolly. \lquote I won\rquote t bother in future. And I\rquote d wash your pants if I were you, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Snivellus.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par \lquote Apologise to Evans!\rquote  James roared at Snape, his wand pointed threateningly at him.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t want }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 to make him apologise,\rquote 
 Lily shouted, rounding on James. \lquote You\rquote re as bad as he is.\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  yelped James. \lquote I\rquote d NEVER call you a \endash  you-know-what!\rquote 
\par \lquote Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you\rquote ve just got off your broomstick, showing off with that stupid Snitch, walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can \endash  I\rquote 
m surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it. You make me SICK.\rquote 
\par She turned on her heel and hurried away.
\par \lquote Evans!\rquote  James shouted after her. \lquote Hey, EVANS!\rquote 
\par But she didn\rquote t look back.
\par \lquote What is it with her?\rquote  said James, trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him.
\par \lquote Reading between the lines, I\rquote d say she thinks you\rquote re a bit con\-ceited, mate,\rquote  said Sirius.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said James, who looked furious now, \lquote right \endash \rquote 
\par There was another flash of light, and Snape was once again hanging upside-down in the air.
\par \lquote Who wants to see me take off Snivelly\rquote s pants?\rquote 
\par But whether James really did take off Snape\rquote s pants, Harry never found out. A hand had closed tight over his upper 
arm, closed with a pincer-like grip. Wincing, Harry looked round to see who had hold of him, and saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adult-sized Snape standing right beside him, white with rage.
\par \lquote Having fun?\rquote 
\par Harry felt himself rising into the air; the summer\rquote s day evapo\-rated around him; he was floating upwards through icy blackness, Snape\rquote 
s hand still tight upon his upper arm. Then, with a swooping feeling as though he had turned head-over-heels in midair, his feet hit the stone floor of Snape\rquote s dungeon and he was standing again beside the Pensieve on Snape\rquote 
s desk in the shadowy, present-day Potion master\rquote s study.
\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Snape, gripping Harry\rquote s arm so tightly Harry\rquote s hand was starting to feel numb. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote So ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 been enjoying yourself, Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote N-no,\rquote  said Harry, trying to free his arm.
\par It was scary: Snape\rquote s lips were shaking, his face was white, his teeth were bared.
\par \lquote Amusing man, your father, wasn\rquote t he?\rquote  said Snape, shaking Harry so hard his glasses slipped down his nose.
\par \lquote I \endash  didn\rquote t \endash \rquote 
\par Snape threw Harry from him with all his might. Harry fell hard on to the dungeon floor.
\par \lquote You will not tell anybody what you saw!\rquote  Snape bellowed.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, getting to his feet as far from Snape as he could. \lquote No, of course I w\emdash \rquote 
\par \lquote Get out, get out, I don\rquote t want to see you in this office ever again!\rquote 
\par And as Harry hurtled towards the door, a jar of dead cockroaches exploded over his head. He wrenched the door open and flew along the corridor, stopping only when he had put three floors between himself and Snape. T
here he leaned against the wall, panting, and rubbing his bruised arm.
\par He had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower so early, nor to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just seen. What was making Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being sho
uted at or having jars thrown at him; it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew exactly how Snape had felt as his father had taunted him, and that judging from what he had just seen, his father had been 
every bit as arro\-gant as Snape had always told him.

\rquote 
\par \lquote So you\rquote ve stopped having funny dreams?\rquote  said Hermione scep\-tically.
\par \lquote Pretty much,\rquote  said Harry, not looking at her.
\par \lquote Well, I don\rquote t think Snape should stop until you\rquote re absolutely sure you can control them!\rquote  said Hermione indignantly. \lquote Harry, I think you should go back to him and ask \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry forcefully. \lquote Just drop it, Hermione, OK?\rquote 
\par It was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione, as was her custom, had spent a large part of the day drawing up revision timetables for 
the three of them. Harry and Ron had let her do it; it was easier than arguing with her and, in any case, they might come in useful.
\par Ron had been startled to discover there were only six weeks left until their exams.
\par \lquote How can that come as a shock?\rquote  Hermione demanded, as she tapped each little square on Ron\rquote s timetable with her wand so that it flashed a different colour according to its subject.
\par \lquote I dunno,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote there\rquote s been a lot going on.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, there you are,\rquote  she said, handing him his timetable, \lquote if you follow that you should do fine.\rquote 
\par Ron looked down it gloomily, but then brightened.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve given me an evening off every week!\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s for Quidditch practice,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par The smile faded from Ron\rquote s face.
\par \lquote What\rquote s the point?\rquote  he said. \lquote We\rquote ve got about as much chance of winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad\rquote s got of becoming Minister for Magic.\rquote 
\par Hermione said nothing; she was looking at Harry, who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks pawed at his hand, trying to get his ears scratched.
\par \lquote What\rquote s wrong, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  he said quickly. \lquote Nothing.\rquote 
\par He seized his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Defensive Magical Theory }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
and pretended to be looking something up in the index. Crookshanks gave him up as a bad job and slunk away under Hermione\rquote s chair.
\par \lquote I saw Cho earlier,\rquote  said Hermione tentatively. \lquote She looked really miserable, too ... have you two had a row again?\rquote 
\par \lquote Wha\emdash  oh, yeah, we have,\rquote  said Harry, seizing gratefully on the excuse.
\par \lquote What about?\rquote 
\par \lquote That sneak friend of hers, Marietta,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Yeah, well, I don\rquote t blame you!\rquote  said Ron angrily, setting down his revision timetable. \lquote If it hadn\rquote t been for her ...\rquote 
\par Ron went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe, which Harry found helpful; all he had to do was look angry, nod and say \lquote Yeah\rquote  and \lquote That\rquote s right\rquote 
 whenever Ron drew breath, leaving his mind free to dwell, ever more miserably, on what he had seen in the Pensieve.
\par He felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside. He had been so sure his parents were wonderful people that he had never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving the aspersions Snape cast on his father\rquote s character. Hadn\rquote 
t people like Hagrid and Sirius }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 told }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Harry how wonderful his father had been? }{

Yes, he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and Harry coul
d not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside-down for the fun of it ... not unless they really loathed them ... perhaps Malfoy, or somebody who really deserved it ...
\par Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at James\rquote s hands: but hadn\rquote t Lily asked, \lquote What\rquote s he done to you?\rquote  And hadn\rquote t James replied, \lquote It\rquote s more the fact that he }{

t James started it all simply because Sirius had said he was bored? Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius ... but in the 
Pensieve, he had sat there and let it all happen ...
\par Harry kept reminding himself that Lily had intervened; his mother had been decent. Yet, the memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as any\-thing else; she ha
d clearly loathed James, and Harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married. Once or twice he even wondered whether James had forced her into it ...
\par For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort, of inspiration. Whenever someone had told him he was like James, he had glowed with pride inside. And now ... now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him.
\par The weather grew breezier, brighter and warmer as the Easter holidays passed, but Harry, along wi
th the rest of the fifth- and seventh-years, was trapped inside, revising, traipsing back and forth to the library. Harry pretended his bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams, and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of studying themselves, 
his excuse went unchallenged.
\par \lquote Harry, I\rquote m talking to you, can you hear me?\rquote 
\par \lquote Huh?\rquote 
\par He looked round. Ginny Weasley, looking very windswept, had joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone. It was late on Sunday evening: Hermione had gone back to Gryffindor Tower to revise Ancient Runes, and Ron had Quidditch practice.

\par \lquote Oh, hi,\rquote  said Harry, pulling his books towards him. \lquote How come you\rquote re not at practice?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s over,\rquote  said Ginny. \lquote Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hospital wing.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, we\rquote re not sure, but we }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 think }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
he knocked himself out with his own bat.\rquote  She sighed heavily. \lquote Anyway ... a package just arrived, it\rquote s only just got through Umbridge\rquote s new screening process.\rquote 
\par She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper on to the table; it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly re-wrapped. There was a scribbled note across it in red ink, reading: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Inspected and Passed by the Hogwarts High Inquisitor.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote It\rquote s Easter eggs from Mum,\rquote  said Ginny. \lquote There\rquote s one for you ... there you go.\rquote 
\par She handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small, iced Snitches and, according to the packaging, containing a bag of Fizzing Whizzbees. Harry looked at it for a moment, then, to his horror, felt a lump rise in his throat.
\par \lquote Are you OK, Harry?\rquote  Ginny asked quietly.
\par \lquote Yeah, I\rquote m fine,\rquote  said Harry gruffly. The lump in his throat was painful. He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made him feel like this.
\par \lquote You seem really down lately,\rquote  Ginny persisted. \lquote You know, I\rquote m sure if you just }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 talked }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote It\rquote s not Cho I want to talk to,\rquote  said Harry brusquely.
\par \lquote Who is it, then?\rquote  asked Ginny.
\par \lquote I ...\rquote 
\par He glanced around to make quite sure nobody was listening. Madam Pince was several shelves away, stamping out a pile of books for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott.

Harry awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic. It was not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridge\rquote s office and using her 
fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous, though that was certainly bad enough; today also happened to be the first time Harry would be in close proximity to Snape since Snape had thrown him out of his office.

After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville\rquote 
s bed, and stared out on a truly glorious morning. The sky was a clear, misty, opalescent blue. Directly ahead of him, Harr
y could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented Snape. He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was desperate to hear Sirius\rquote 
s own account of what had happened, to know of any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for his father\rquote s behaviour ...
\par Something caught Harry\rquote s attention: movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging from
 between the trees. He seemed to be limping. As Harry watched, Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and dis\-
appeared inside it. Harry watched the cabin for several minutes. Hagrid did not emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire.
\par Harry turned away from the window, headed back to his trunk and started to dress.
\par With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge\rquote s office ahead, Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not reckoned on Hermione\rquote s almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five o
\rquote clock. For the first time ever, she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic as Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore.
\par \lquote ... and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled, she\rquote ll be able to guess you\rquote ve been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect she\rquote ll }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Hermione,\rquote  said Ron in a low and indignant voice, \lquote are you going to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take my own notes?\rquote 
\par \lquote You take notes for a change, it won\rquote t kill you!\rquote 
\par By t
he time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry nor Ron was speaking to Hermione. Undeterred, she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings, all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to wa
ste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks.
\par Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were invisible. Harry was, of course, well-used to this tactic, as it was one of Uncle Vernon\rquote s favourites, and on the whole was grateful
 he had to suffer nothing worse. In fact, compared to what he usually had to endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he found the new approach something of an improve\-
ment, and was pleased to find that when left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily. At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask, corked it and took it up to Snape\rquote 
s desk for marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an \lquote E\rquote .
\par He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise. Malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around. His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and Snape was watching him with a look of gloating pleasure.
\par \lquote Whoops,\rquote  he said softly. \lquote Another zero, then, Potter.\rquote 
\par Harry was too incensed to speak. He strode back to his caul\-dron, intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry!\rquote  said Hermione, with her hands over her mouth. \lquote I\rquote m really sorry, Harry. I thought you\rquote d finished, so I cleared up!\rquote 
\par Harry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang, he hurried out of the dungeon without a backwards glance, and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so 
that Hermione could not start nagging him again about using Umbridge\rquote s office.
\par He was in such a bad mood by the time he got to Divination that he had quite forgotten his careers appointment with Professor McGonagall, remembering it only when Ron asked him why he wasn\rquote 
t in her office. He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only a few minutes late.
\par \lquote Sorry, Professor,\rquote  he panted, as he closed the door. \lquote I forgot.\rquote 
\par \lquote No matter, Potter,\rquote  she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody else sniffed from the corner. Harry looked round.
\par Professor Umbridge was sitting there, a clipboard on her knee, a fussy little pie-frill around her neck and a small, horribly smug smile on her face.
\par \lquote Sit down, Potter,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall tersely. Her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk.
\par Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clip\-board.
\par \lquote Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote 
Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash \rquote  said Harry.
\par He was finding the scratching noise from behind him very dis\-tracting.
\par \lquote Yes?\rquote  Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.
\par \lquote Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,\rquote  Harry mumbled.
\par \lquote You\rquote d need top grades for that,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it. \lquote They ask for a minimum of five NEWTs, and nothing under \'93Exceeds Expectations\'94
 grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It\rquote s a difficult career path, Potter, they only take the best. In fact, I don\rquote 
t think anybody has been taken on in the last three years.\rquote 
\par At this moment, Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it. Professor McGonagall ignored her.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I sup\-pose?\rquote  she went on, talking a little louder than before.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Defence Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?\rquote 
\par \lquote Naturally,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall crisply. \lquote I would also advise \endash \rquote 
\par Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this time. Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had hap\-pened.
\par \lquote I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my NEWT classes unless they have achieved \'93
Exceeds Expectations\'94 or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level. I\rquote d say you\rquote re averaging \'93Acceptable\'94 at the moment, so you\rquote 
ll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,\rquote  she added, with the merest flicker of a smile. \lquote 
Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than \'93Outstanding\'94 in their OWLs, so \endash \rquote 
\par Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet.
\par \lquote May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?\rquote  Professor McGonagall asked curtly, without looking at Professor Umbridge.
\par \lquote Oh, no, thank you very much,\rquote  said Umbridge, with that sim\-pering laugh Harry hated so much. \lquote I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption, Minerva?\rquote 
\par \lquote I daresay you\rquote ll find you can,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth.
\par \lquote I was just wondering whether Mr Potter has }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 quite }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 the tem\-
perament for an Auror?\rquote  said Professor Umbridge sweetly.
\par \lquote Were you?\rquote  said Professor McGonagall haughtily. \lquote Well, Potter,\rquote  she continued, as though there had been no interruption, \lquote 
if you are serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between \'93Acceptable\'94 and \'93Exceeds Expectations\'94
 for the last two years, so your Charmwork seems satisfactory. As for Defence Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 are you quite sure you wouldn\rquote t like a cough drop, Dolores?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,\rquote  simpered Professor Umbridge, who had just coughed her loudest yet. \lquote I was just concerned that you might not have Harry\rquote s most recent Defence Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you. I
\rquote m quite sure I slipped in a note.\rquote 
\par \lquote What, this thing?\rquote  said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revul\-sion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry\rquote s
 folder. She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised, then placed it back into the folder without comment.
\par \lquote Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject, and obviously for an Auror \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Did you not understand my note, Minerva?\rquote  asked Professor Umbridge in honeyed tones, quite forgetting to cough.
\par \lquote Of course I understood it,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, her teeth clenched so tightly the words came out a little muffled.
\par \lquote Well, then, I am confused ... I\rquote m afraid I don\rquote t quite under\-stand how you can give Mr Potter false hope that \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote False hope?\rquote  repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look round at Professor Umbridge. \lquote He has achieved high marks in all his Defence Against the Dark Arts tests \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I should have made my meaning plainer,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes. \lquote He has achieved high marks in all Defence Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher.\rquote 

\par Professor Umbridge\rquote s smile vanished as suddenly as a light bulb blowing. She sat back in her chair, turned a sheet on her cli
pboard and began scribbling very fast indeed, her bulging eyes rolling from side to side. Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin nostrils flared, her eyes burning.
\par \lquote Any questions, Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you, if you get enough NEWTs?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, you\rquote ll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pres\-sure and so forth,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, \lquote perseverance and dedi\-cation, because Auror training takes a further three year
s, not to mention very high skills in practical Defence. It will mean a lot more study even after you\rquote ve left school, so unless you\rquote re prepared to \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I think you\rquote ll also find,\rquote  said Umbridge, her voice very cold now, \lquote that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors. Their criminal records.\rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  unless you\rquote re prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts, you should really look at another \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school.\rquote 
\par \lquote A very good chance, then,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall.
\par \lquote Potter has a criminal record,\rquote  said Umbridge loudly.
\par \lquote Potter has been cleared of all charges,\rquote  said McGonagall, even more loudly.
\par Professor Umbridge stood up. She was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanour had given place to a hard fury that made her broad, flabby face look oddly sinister.
\par \lquote Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!\rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall got to her feet, too, and in her case this was a much more impressive move; she towered over Professor Umbridge.
\par \lquote Potter,\rquote  she said in ringing tones, \lquote I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly, I will make sure you achieve the required results!\rquote 
\par \lquote The Minister for Magic will never employ Harry Potter!\rquote  said Umbridge, her voice rising furiously.
\par \lquote There may well be a new Minister for Magic by the time Potter is ready to join!\rquote  shouted Professor McGonagall.
\par \lquote Aha!\rquote  shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby finger at McGonagall. \lquote Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Of course! That\rquote s what you want, isn\rquote t it, Minerva McGonagall? You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore! Y

\par \lquote You are raving,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful. \lquote Potter, that concludes our careers consultation.\rquote 
\par Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at Professor Umbridge. He could hear her and Professor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor.
\par Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon.
\par \lquote I hope you\rquote ve thought better of what you were planning to do, Harry,\rquote  Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their books to \lquote Chapter Thirty-four, Non-Retaliation and Negotiation\rquote . \lquote Umbridge looks like she
\rquote s in a really bad mood already ...\rquote 
\par Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who kept his head down, staring at }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Defensive Magical Theory, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

re was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father\rquote s old Invisibility Cloak.
\par But the fact remained that if he was caught ...
\par \lquote Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school, Harry!\rquote  whispered Hermione, raising her book to hide her face from Umbridge. \lquote And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing!\rquote 
\par He could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summer\rquote s day more than twenty years ago ...

\par But did he want to be like his father any more?
\par \lquote Harry, don\rquote t do it, please don\rquote t do it!\rquote  Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class.
\par He did not answer; he did not know what to do.
\par Ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice; he would not look at Harry, though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading Harry some more, he said in a low voice, \lquote Give it a rest, OK? He can make up his own mind.\rquote 

\par Harry\rquote s heart beat very fast as he left the classroom. He was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistake\-
able sounds of a diversion going off in the distance. There were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them; people exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully \endash 

\par Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her. Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the opposite direction: it was now or never.
\par \lquote Harry \endash  please!\rquote  Hermione pleaded weakly.
\par But he had made up his mind; hitching his bag more securely on to his shoulder, he set off at a run, weaving in and out of stu\-dents now hurrying in the opposite direction to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing.
\par Harry reached the corridor to Umbridge\rquote s office and found it deserted. Dashing behind a large suit of armour whose helmet creaked around to watch him, he pulled open his bag, seized Sirius\rquote 
s knife and donned the Invisibility Cloak. He then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armour and along the corridor until he reached Umbridge\rquote s door.
\par He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down, then withdrew it. There was a tiny click, and the door swung open. He ducked inside the office, closed the door quickly behind him and looked around.

\par Nothing was moving except the horrible kittens that were still frolicking on the wall plates above the confiscated broomsticks.
\par Harry pulled off his Cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found what he was looking for within seconds: a small box con\-taining glittering Floo powder.
\par He crouched down in front
 of the empty grate, his hands shaking. He had never done this before, though he thought he knew how it must work. Sticking his head into the fireplace, he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it on to the logs stacked neatly beneath him. They explode
d at once into emerald green flames.
\par \lquote Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!\rquote  Harry said loudly and clearly.
\par It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experi\-enced. He had travelled by Floo powder before, of course, but then it had been his entire body
 that had spun around and around in the flames through the network of wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country. This time, his knees remained firm upon the cold floor of Umbridge\rquote 
s office, and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire ...
\par And then, as abruptly as it had begun, the spinning stopped. Feeling rather sick and as though he were wearing an exception\-
ally hot muffler around his head, Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment.
\par \lquote Sirius?\rquote 
\par The man jumped and looked around. It was not Sirius, but Lupin.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  he said, looking thoroughly shocked. \lquote What are you \endash  what\rquote s happened, is everything all right?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I just wondered \endash  I mean, I just fancied a \endash  a chat with Sirius.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll call him,\rquote  said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking per\-plexed, \lquote he went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the attic again ...\rquote 
\par And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen. Now he was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs. He won\-
dered why Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the fire; his knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact with Umbridge\rquote s hard stone floor.
\par Lupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later.
\par \lquote What is it?\rquote  said Sirius urgently, sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire, so that he and Harry were on a level. Lupin knelt down too, looking very concerned. \lquote 
Are you all right? Do you need help?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote it\rquote s nothing like that ... I just wanted to talk ... about my dad.\rquote 
\par They exchanged a look of great surprise, but Harry did not have time to feel 
awkward or embarrassed; his knees were becoming sorer by the second and he guessed five minutes had already passed from the start of the diversion; George had only guaranteed him twenty. He therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen 
in the Pensieve.
\par When he had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a moment. Then Lupin said quietly, \lquote I wouldn\rquote t like you to judge your father on what you saw there, Harry. He was only fifteen \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m fifteen!\rquote  said Harry heatedly.
\par \lquote Look, Harry,\rquote  said Sirius placatingly, \lquote James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can\rquote 
t you? I think James was everything Snape wanted to be \endash  he was popular, he was good at Quidditch \endash  good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts, and James \endash 
 whatever else he may have appeared to you, Harry \endash  always hated the Dark Arts.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because \endash  well, just because you said you were bored,\rquote  he fin\-ished, with a slightly apologetic note in his voice.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not proud of it,\rquote  said Sirius quickly.
\par Lupin looked sideways at Sirius, then said, \lquote Look, Harry, what you\rquote ve got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did \endash  everyone thought they were the height of cool \endash 
 if they sometimes got a bit carried away \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,\rquote  said Sirius.
\par Lupin smiled.
\par \lquote He kept messing up his hair,\rquote  said Harry in a pained voice.
\par Sirius and Lupin laughed.
\par \lquote I\rquote d forgotten he used to do that,\rquote  said Sirius affectionately.
\par \lquote Was he playing with the Snitch?\rquote  said Lupin eagerly.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin beamed reminiscently. \lquote Well ... I thought he was a bit of an idiot.\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course he was a bit of an idiot!\rquote  said Sirius bracingly, \lquote we were all idiots! Well \endash  not Moony so much,\rquote  he said fairly, looking at Lupin.
\par But Lupin shook his head. \lquote Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?\rquote  he said. \lquote Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, well,\rquote  said Sirius, \lquote you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes ... that was something ...\rquote 
\par \lquote And,\rquote  said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here, \lquote he kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around,\rquote  said Sirius, shrugging, \lquote he couldn\rquote t stop himself showing off whenever he got near her.\rquote 
\par \lquote How come she married him?\rquote  Harry asked miserably. \lquote She hated him!\rquote 
\par \lquote Nah, she didn\rquote t,\rquote  said Sirius.
\par \lquote She started going out with him in seventh year,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par \lquote Once James had deflated his head a bit,\rquote  said Sirius.
\par \lquote And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par \lquote Even Snape?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Lupin slowly, \lquote Snape was a special case. I mean, he never lost an opportunity to curse James so you couldn\rquote t really expect James to take that lying down, could you?\rquote 
\par \lquote And my mum was OK with that?\rquote 
\par \lquote She didn\rquote t know too much about it, to tell you the truth,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote I mean, James didn\rquote t take Snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her, did he?\rquote 
\par Sirius frowned at Harry, who was still looking unconvinced.
\par \lquote Look,\rquote  he said, \lquote your father was the best friend I ever had and he was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fif\-teen. He grew out of it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, OK,\rquote  said Harry heavily. \lquote I just never thought I\rquote d feel sorry for Snape.\rquote 
\par \lquote Now you mention it,\rquote  said Lupin, a faint crease between his eyebrows, \lquote how did Snape react when he found you\rquote d seen all this?\rquote 
\par \lquote He told me he\rquote d never teach me Occlumency again,\rquote  said Harry indifferently, \lquote like that\rquote s a big disappoint\emdash \rquote 
\par \lquote He WHAT?\rquote  shouted Sirius, causing Harry to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes.
\par \lquote Are you serious, Harry?\rquote  said Lupin quickly. \lquote He\rquote s stopped giving you lessons?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, surprised at what he considered a great over-reaction. \lquote But it\rquote s OK, I don\rquote t care, it\rquote s a bit of a relief to tell you the \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m coming up there to have a word with Snape!\rquote  said Sirius forcefully, and he actually made to stand up, but Lupin wrenched him back down again.
\par \lquote If anyone\rquote s going to tell Snape it will be me!\rquote  he said firmly. \lquote But Harry, first of all, you\rquote re to go back to Snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons \endash  when Dumbledore hears 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t tell him that, he\rquote d kill me!\rquote  said Harry, outraged. \lquote You didn\rquote t see him when we got out of the Pensieve.\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency!\rquote  said Lupin sternly. \lquote Do you understand me? Nothing!\rquote 
\par \lquote OK, OK,\rquote  said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention annoyed. \lquote I\rquote ll ... I\rquote ll try and say something to him ... but it won\rquote t be \endash \rquote 
\par He fell silent. He could hear distant footsteps.
\par \lquote Is that Kreacher coming downstairs?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Sirius, glancing behind him. \lquote It must be somebody your end.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s heart skipped several beats.
\par \lquote I\rquote d better go!\rquote  he said hastily and pulled his head backwards out of the Grimmauld Place fire. For a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulders, then he found himself kneeling in front of Umbridge\rquote 
s fire with it firmly back on and watching the emerald flames flicker and die.
\par \lquote Quickly, quickly!\rquote  he heard a wheezy voice mutter right out\-side the office door. \lquote Ah, she\rquote s left it open \endash \rquote 
\par Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when Filch burst into the office. He l
ooked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in Umbridge\rquote s desk and began rifling through the papers inside it.
\par \lquote Approval for Whipping ... Approval for Whipping ... I can do it at last ... they\rquote ve had it coming to them for years ...\rquote 
\par He pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rap\-idly back out of the door, clutching it to his chest.
\par Harry leapt to his feet and, making sure he had his bag and that the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him go.
\par One landing down from Umbridge\rquote s office, Harry thought it was safe to become visible 
again. He pulled off the Cloak, shoved it in his bag and hurried onwards. There was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the Entrance Hall. He ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there.
\par It was 
just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them, Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap); teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. Prominent amo
n
g the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was bobbing overhead, gazed down at Fred and George who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakeable look of tw
o people who had just been cornered.
\par \lquote So!\rquote  said Umbridge triumphantly. Harry realised she was standing just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down upon her prey. \lquote So \endash  you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp, do you?\rquote 

\par \lquote Pretty amusing, yeah,\rquote  said Fred, looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear.
\par Filch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with happiness.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve got the form, Headmistress,\rquote  he said hoarsely, waving the piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk. \lquote I\rquote ve got the form and I\rquote ve got the whips waiting ... oh, let me do it now ...\rquote 

\par \lquote Very good, Argus,\rquote  she said. \lquote You two,\rquote  she went on, gazing down at Fred and George, \lquote are about to learn what happens to wrong\-doers in my school.\rquote 
\par \lquote You know what?\rquote  said Fred. \lquote I don\rquote t think we are.\rquote 
\par He turned to his twin.
\par \lquote George,\rquote  said Fred, \lquote I think we\rquote ve outgrown full-time education.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I\rquote ve been feeling that way myself,\rquote  said George lightly.
\par \lquote Time to test our talents in the real world, d\rquote you reckon?\rquote  asked Fred.
\par \lquote Definitely,\rquote  said George.
\par And before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands and said together:
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Accio brooms!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to his left, he ducked just in time. Fred and George\rquote 
s broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corri
dor towards their owners; they turned left, streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor.
\par \lquote We won\rquote t be seeing you,\rquote  Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick.
\par \lquote Yeah, don\rquote t bother to keep in touch,\rquote  said George, mounting his own.
\par Fred looked around at the assembled students, at the silent, watchful crowd.
\par \lquote If anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley \endash  Weasleys\rquote  Wizarding Wheezes,\rquote  he said in a loud voice. \lquote Our new premises!\rquote 
\par \lquote Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they\rquote re going to use our products to get rid of this old bat,\rquote  added George, pointing at Professor Umbridge.
\par \lquote STOP THEM!\rquote 
 shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing o
n his level above the crowd.
\par \lquote Give her hell from us, Peeves.\rquote 
\par And Peeves, who Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from t
he students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset.

s flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon become the stuff 
of Hogwarts legend: within a week, even those who had been eye-witnesses were half-convinced they had seen the twins dive-bomb Umbridge on their brooms and pelt her with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors. In the immediate aftermath of their depart
ure there was a great wave of talk about copying them. Harry frequently heard students saying things like, \lquote Honestly, some days I just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place,\rquote  or else, \lquote 
One more lesson like that and I might just do a Weasley.\rquote 
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
Fred and George had made sure nobody was likely to forget them too soon. For one thing, they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing. Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying
 different means of removing it but without success. Eventually, the area was roped off and Filch, gnashing his teeth furiously, was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms. Harry was certain that teachers like McGonagall or Flitw
ick could have removed the swamp in an instant but, just as in the case of Fred and George\rquote s Wildfire Whiz-bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle.
\par Then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Umbridge\rquote s office door, through which Fred and George\rquote s Cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters. Filch fitted a new door and removed Harry\rquote 
s Firebolt to the dungeons where, it was rumoured, Umbridge had set an armed security troll to guard it. However, her troubles were far from over.
\par Inspired by Fred and George\rquote s example, a great number of stu\-dents were now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers-in-Chief. In spite of the new door, somebody man\-aged to slip a hairy-snouted Niffler into Umbridge\rquote 
s office, which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects, leapt on Umbridge when she entered and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers. Dungbombs and Stink Pellets were dropped so fre\-
quently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for stu\-dents t
o perform Bubble-Head Charms on themselves before leaving lessons, which ensured them a supply of fresh air, even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads.
\par Filch prowled the corridors with a horse
whip ready in his hands, desperate to catch miscreants, but the problem was that there were now so many of them he never knew which way to turn. The Inquisitorial Squad was attempting to help him, but odd things kept happening to its members. Warrington o
f the Slytherin Quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes; Pansy Parkinson, to Hermione\rquote 
s delight, missed all her lessons the following day as she had sprouted antlers.
\par Meanwhile, it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts. Umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the students assem\-bled there to faint, vomit, develop dangerous fevers or else sp
out blood from both nostrils. Shrieking with rage and frustration, she attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source, but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering from \lquote Umbridge\-itis\rquote 
. After putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret, she was forced to give up and allow the bleeding, swooning, sweating and vomiting students to leave her classes in droves.
\par But not even the users of the Snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos, Peeves, who seemed to have taken Fred\rquote 
s parting words deeply to heart. Cackling madly, he soared through the school, upending tables, bursting out of blackboards, toppling statues and vases; twice he shut Mrs Norris inside a suit of armour, from which she was resc
ued, yowling loudly, by the furious care\-
taker. Peeves smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles, juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students, caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows; flooded the seco
nd floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms, dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and, whenever he fancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge and blowing loud raspberries ever
y time she spoke.
\par None of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her. Indeed, a week after Fred and George\rquote s departure Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves, who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier,
 and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, \lquote It unscrews the other way.\rquote 
\par To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet; he remained confused and disorientated and his par\-ents were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive, looking extremely angry.
\par \lquote Should we say something?\rquote  said Hermione in a worried voice, pressing her cheek against the Charms window so that she could see Mr and Mrs Montague marching inside. \lquote About what happened to him? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him?
\rquote 
\par \lquote Course not, he\rquote ll recover,\rquote  said Ron indifferently.
\par \lquote Anyway, more trouble for Umbridge, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Harry in a satisfied voice.
\par He and Ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be charming with their wands. Harry\rquote s spouted four very short legs that could not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair. Ron\rquote 
s grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with great difficulty, trembled for a few seconds, then folded, causing the cup to crack into two.

t have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he? If you want to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me!\rquote 
\par \lquote You?\rquote  she said, catching her teacup as it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little willow-patterned legs, and replacing it in front of her. \lquote Why should I be worried about you?\rquote 
\par \lquote When Mum\rquote s next letter finally gets through Umbridge\rquote s screening process,\rquote  said Ron bitterly, now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight, \lquote I\rquote 
m going to be in deep trouble. I wouldn\rquote t be surprised if she\rquote s sent another Howler.\rquote 
\par \lquote But \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote ll be my fault Fred and George left, you wait,\rquote  said Ron darkly. \lquote She\rquote ll say I should\rquote ve stopped them leaving, I should\rquote ve grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something ... yeah, it\rquote 
ll be all my fault.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, if she }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 does }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 say that it\rquote ll be very unfair, you couldn\rquote 
t have done anything! But I\rquote m sure she won\rquote t, I mean, if it\rquote s really true they\rquote ve got premises in Diagon Alley, they must have been plan\-ning this for ages.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, but that\rquote s another thing, how did they get premises?\rquote  said Ron, hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs col\-lapsed again and it lay twitching before him. \lquote It\rquote s a bit dodgy, isn\rquote t it? They
\rquote ll need loads of Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley. She\rquote ll want to know what they\rquote ve been up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, yes, that occurred to me, too,\rquote  said Hermione, allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circles around Harry\rquote s, whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop, \lquote I\rquote ve been won\-
dering whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful.\rquote 
\par \lquote He hasn\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry curtly.
\par \lquote How do you know?\rquote  said Ron and Hermione together.
\par \lquote Because \endash \rquote  Harry hesitated, but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come. There was no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant anyone suspected that Fred and George were criminals. \lquote 
Because they got the gold from me. I gave them my Triwizard winnings last June.\rquote 
\par There was a shocked silence, then Hermione\rquote s teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor.
\par \lquote Oh, Harry, you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 didn\rquote t!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148  she said.
\par \lquote Yes, I did,\rquote  said Harry mutinously. \lquote And I don\rquote t regret it, either. I didn\rquote t need the gold and they\rquote ll be great at running a joke shop.\rquote 
\par \lquote But this is excellent!\rquote  said Ron, looking thrilled. \lquote It\rquote s all your fault, Harry \endash  Mum can\rquote t blame me at all! Can I tell her?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I suppose you\rquote d better,\rquote  said Harry dully, \lquote \rquote specially if she thinks they\rquote re receiving stolen cauldrons or something.\rquote 
\par Hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson, but Harry had a shrewd suspicion that her self-restraint was bound to crack befo
re long. Sure enough, once they had left the castle for break and were standing around in the weak May sunshine, she fixed Harry with a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air.
\par Harry interrupted her before she had even started.
\par \lquote It\rquote s no good nagging me, it\rquote s done,\rquote  he said firmly. \lquote Fred and George have got the gold \endash  spent a good bit of it, too, by the sounds of it \endash  and I can\rquote t get it back from them and I don\rquote 
t want to. So save your breath, Hermione.\rquote 
\par \lquote I wasn\rquote t going to say anything about Fred and George!\rquote  she said in an injured voice.
\par Ron snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him a very dirty look.
\par \lquote No, I wasn\rquote t!\rquote  she said angrily. \lquote As a matter of fact, I was going to ask Harry when he\rquote s going to go back to Snape and ask for more Occlumency lessons!\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s heart sank. Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred and George\rquote 
s dramatic departure, which admittedly had taken many hours, Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news of Sirius. As Harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to Sirius in the first place, it had been hard to think of what to tell the
m; he had ended up saying, truthfully, that Sirius wanted Harry to resume Occlumency lessons. He had been regretting this ever since; Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when Harry least expected it.
\par \lquote You can\rquote t tell me you\rquote ve stopped having funny dreams,\rquote  Hermione said now, \lquote because Ron told me you were muttering in your sleep again last night.\rquote 
\par Harry threw Ron a furious look. Ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself.
\par \lquote You were only muttering a bit,\rquote  he mumbled apologetically. \lquote Something about \'93just a bit further\'94.\rquote 
\par \lquote I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch,\rquote  Harry lied brutally. \lquote I was trying to get you to stretch out a bit further to grab the Quaffle.\rquote 
\par Ron\rquote s ears went red. Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure; he had not, of course, dreamed anything of the sort.
\par Last night, he had once again made the journey along the Department of Mysteries corridor. He had passed through the cir\-cular room, then the room full of clicking and dancing light, until he found himself 
again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass spheres.
\par He had hurried straight towards row number ninety-seven, turned left and run along it ... it had probably been then that he had spoken aloud ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 just a bit further .
.. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
for he felt his conscious self struggling to wake ... and before he had reached the end of the row, he had found himself lying in bed again, gazing up at the canopy of his four-poster.
\par \lquote You are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 trying }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 to block your mind, aren\rquote t you?\rquote 
 said Hermione, looking beadily at Harry. \lquote You are keeping going with your Occlumency?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course I am,\rquote  said Harry, trying to sound as though this question was insulting, but not quite meeting her eye. The truth was he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that 
room full of dusty orbs, that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue.
\par The problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to revision, his mind seemed so saturated with information when he went to bed he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all; and when he did, his over\-
wrought brain presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams. He also suspected that part of his mind \endash  the part that often spoke in Hermione\rquote s voice \endash  now felt guilty o
n the occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door, and sought to wake him before he could reach the journey\rquote s end.
\par \lquote You know,\rquote  said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, \lquote if Montague doesn\rquote t recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I s\rquote pose so,\rquote  said Harry, glad of a change of subject.
\par \lquote I mean, we\rquote ve won one, lost one \endash  if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, that\rquote s right,\rquote  said Harry, losing track of what he was agreeing to. Cho Chang had just walked across the courtyard, determinedly not looking at him.

The final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw, was to take place on the last weekend of May. Although Slytherin had been narrowly defea
ted by Hufflepuff in their last match, Gryffindor were not daring to hope for victory, due mainly (though of course nobody said it to him) to Ron\rquote s abysmal goal-keeping record. He, however, seemed to have found a new optimism.

 he told Harry and Hermione grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match. \lquote Nothing to lose now, is there?\rquote 
\par \lquote You know,\rquote  said Hermione, as she and Harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd, \lquote I think Ron might do better without Fred and George around. They never exactly gave him a lot of confidence.
\rquote 
\par Luna Lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head.
\par \lquote Oh, gosh, I forgot!\rquote  said Hermione, watching the eagle flapping its wings as Luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing Slytherins. \lquote Cho will be playing, won\rquote t she?\rquote 
\par Harry, who had not forgotten this, merely grunted.
\par They found seats in the topmost row of the stands. It was a fine, clear day; Ron could not wish for better, and Harry found himself hoping against hope that Ron would not give the Slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of \lquote Weasley is our King
\rquote .
\par Lee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred and George had left, was commentating as usual. As the teams zoomed out on to the pitch he named the players with something less than his usual gusto.
\par \lquote ... Bradley ... Davies ... Chang,\rquote  he said, and Harry felt his stomach perform, less of a back flip, more a feeble lurch as Cho walked out on 
to the pitch, her shiny black hair rippling in the slight breeze. He was not sure what he wanted to happen any more, except that he could not stand any more rows. Even the sight of her chatting animatedly to Roger Davies as they prepared to mount their br
ooms caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy.
\par \lquote And they\rquote re off!\rquote  said Lee. And Davies takes the Quaffle immedi\-ately, Ravenclaw Captain Davies with the Quaffle, he dodges Johnson, he dodges Bell, he dodges Spinnet as well ... he\rquote s going straight for goal! He\rquote 
s going to shoot \endash  and \endash  and \endash \rquote  Lee swore very loudly. And he\rquote s scored.\rquote

\par \lquote Er ... can\rquote t it wait, Hagrid?\rquote  asked Harry. \lquote Till the match is over?\rquote

\par Hagrid\rquote s nose was gently dripping blood. His eyes were both blackened. Harry had not seen him this close-up since his return to the school; he looked utterly woebegone.
\par \lquote Course,\rquote  said Harry at once, \lquote course we\rquote ll come.\rquote 
\par He and Hermione edged back along their row of seats, causing much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them. The people in Hagrid\rquote s row were not complaining, merely attempting to make themselves as small as possible.
\par \lquote I \rquote ppreciate this, you two, I really do,\rquote  said Hagrid as they reached the stairs. He kept looking around nervously as they descended towards the lawn below. \lquote I jus\rquote  hope she doesn\rquote  notice us goin\rquote .\rquote 

\par \lquote You mean Umbridge?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote She won\rquote t, she\rquote s got her whole Inquisitorial Squad sitting with her, didn\rquote t you see? She must be expecting trouble at the match.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, well, a bit o\rquote  trouble wouldn\rquote  hurt,\rquote  said Hagrid, pausing to peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and his cabin was deserted. \lquote Give us more time.\rquote 
\par \lquote What is it, Hagrid?\rquote  said Hermione, looking up at him with a concerned expression on her face as they hurried across the grass towards the edge of the Forest.
\par \lquote Yeh \endash  yeh\rquote ll see in a mo\rquote ,\rquote  said Hagrid, looking over his shoulder as a great roar rose from the stands behind them. \lquote Hey \endash  did someone jus\rquote  score?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote ll be Ravenclaw,\rquote  said Harry heavily.
\par \lquote Good ... good ...\rquote  said Hagrid distractedly. Tha\rquote s good ...\rquote 
\par They had to jog to keep up with him as he strode across the lawn, looking around with every other step. Wh
en they reached his cabin, Hermione turned automatically left towards the front door. Hagrid, however, walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the Forest, where he picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree. 
When he realised they were no longer with him, he turned.
\par \lquote We\rquote re goin\rquote  in here,\rquote  he said, jerking his shaggy head behind him.
\par \lquote Into the Forest?\rquote  said Hermione, perplexed.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote C\rquote mon now, quick, before we\rquote re spotted!\rquote 
\par Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then ducked into the cover of the trees behind Hagrid, who was already striding away from them into the green gloom, his crossbow over his arm. Harry and Hermione ran to catch up with him.
\par \lquote Hagrid, why are you armed?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Jus\rquote  a precaution,\rquote  said Hagrid, shrugging his massive shoul\-ders.
\par \lquote You didn\rquote t bring your crossbow the day you showed us the Thestrals,\rquote  said Hermione timidly.
\par \lquote Nah, well, we weren\rquote  goin\rquote  in so far then,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote An\rquote  anyway, tha\rquote  was before Firenze left the Forest, wasn\rquote  it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Why does Firenze leaving make a difference?\rquote  asked Hermione curiously.
\par \lquote \rquote Cause the other centaurs are good an\rquote  riled at me, tha\rquote s why,\rquote  said Hagrid quietly, glancing around. \lquote They used ter be \endash  well, yeh couldn\rquote  call \rquote em friendly \endash  but we got on all righ
\rquote . Kept \rquote emselves to \rquote emselves, bu\rquote  always turned up if I wanted a word. Not any more.\rquote 
\par He sighed deeply.
\par \lquote Firenze said they\rquote re angry because he went to work for Dumbledore,\rquote  Harry said, tripping on a protruding root because he was busy watching Hagrid\rquote s profile.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Hagrid heavily. \lquote Well, angry doesn\rquote  cover it. Ruddy livid. If I hadn\rquote  stepped in, I reckon they\rquote d\rquote ve kicked Firenze ter death \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote They attacked him?\rquote  said Hermione, sounding shocked.
\par \lquote Yep,\rquote  said Hagrid gruffly, forcing his way through several low-hanging branches. \lquote He had half the herd on to him.\rquote 
\par \lquote And you stopped it?\rquote  said Harry, amazed and impressed. \lquote By yourself?\rquote 
\par \lquote Course I did, couldn\rquote t stand by an\rquote  watch \rquote em kill \rquote im, could I?\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Lucky I was passin\rquote , really ... an\rquote  I\rquote d\rquote ve thought Firenze mighta remembered tha\rquote 
 before he started sendin\rquote  me stupid warnin\rquote s!\rquote  he added hotly and unexpectedly.
\par Harry and Hermione looked at each other, startled, but Hagrid, scowling, did not elaborate.
\par \lquote Anyway,\rquote  he said, breathing a little more heavily than usual, \lquote since then the other centaurs\rquote ve bin livid with me, an\rquote  the trouble is they\rquote ve got a lot of influence in the Forest ... cleverest creatures in here.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Is that why we\rquote re here, Hagrid?\rquote  asked Hermione. \lquote The centaurs?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, no,\rquote  said Hagrid, shaking his head dismissively, \lquote no, it\rquote s not them. Well, o\rquote  course, they could complicate the problem, yeah ... but yeh\rquote ll see what I mean in a bit.\rquote 
\par On this incomprehensible note he fell silent and forged a little ahead, taking one stride for every three of theirs, so that they had great trouble keeping up with him.
\par The path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as they walked further and further into the Forest that it was
 as dark as dusk. They were soon a long way past the clearing where Hagrid had shown them the Thestrals, but Harry felt no sense of unease until Hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees towards the dark heart 
of the Forest.
\par \lquote Hagrid!\rquote  said Harry, fighting his way through thickly knotted brambles, over which Hagrid had stepped with ease, and remem\-bering very vividly what had happened to him on the other occa\-sion he had stepped off the Forest path. \lquote 
Where are we going?\rquote 
\par \lquote Bit further,\rquote  said Hagrid over his shoulder. \lquote C\rquote mon, Harry ... we need ter keep together now.\rquote 
\par It was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid, what with branches and thickets of thorn through which Hagrid marched as easily as if they were cobwebs, but which snagged Harry and Hermione\rquote 
s robes, frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free themselves. Harry\rquote s arms and legs were soon covered in small cuts and scratches. They were so deep in the Forest now t
hat sometimes all Harry could see of Hagrid in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him. Any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence. The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement, even though it might have been ma
de by an innocent sparrow, caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit. It occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the Forest without meeting some kind of creature; their absence struck him as rather ominous.
\par \lquote Hagrid, would it be all right if we lit our wands?\rquote  said Hermione quietly.
\par \lquote Er ... all righ\rquote ,\rquote  Hagrid whispered back. \lquote In fact \endash \rquote 
\par He stopped suddenly and turned around; Hermione walked right into him and was knocked over backwards. Harry caught her just before she hit the Forest floor.
\par \lquote Maybe we bes\rquote  jus\rquote  stop fer a momen\rquote , so I can ... fill yeh in,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Before we ge\rquote  there, like.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good!\rquote  said Hermione, as Harry set her back on her feet. They both murmured }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Lumos!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and their wand-tips ignited. Hagrid\rquote s face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and Harry saw again that he looked nervous and sad.
\par \lquote Righ\rquote ,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Well ... see ... the thing is ...\rquote 
\par He took a great breath.
\par \lquote Well, there\rquote s a good chance I\rquote m goin\rquote  ter be gettin\rquote  the sack any day now,\rquote  he said.
\par Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then back at him.
\par \lquote But you\rquote ve lasted this long \endash \rquote  Hermione said tentatively. \lquote What makes you think \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Umbridge reckons it was me that put tha\rquote  Niffler in her office.\rquote 
\par \lquote And was it?\rquote  said Harry, before he could stop himself.
\par \lquote No, it ruddy well wasn\rquote !\rquote  said Hagrid indignantly. \lquote On\rquote y any\-thin\rquote  ter do with magical creatures an\rquote  she thinks it\rquote s got somethin\rquote  ter do with me. Yeh know she\rquote s bin lookin\rquote

 now, before she\rquote s go\rquote  the chance ter do it in front o\rquote  the whole school, like she did with Trelawney.\rquote 
\par Harry and Hermione both made noises of protest, but Hagrid overrode them with a wave of one of his enormous hands.
\par \lquote It\rquote s not the end o\rquote  the world, I\rquote ll be able ter help Dumbledore once I\rquote m outta here, I can be useful ter the Order. An\rquote  you lot\rquote ll have Grubbly-Plank, yeh\rquote ll \endash  yeh\rquote 
ll get through yer exams fine ...\rquote 
\par His voice trembled and broke.
\par \lquote Don\rquote  worry abou\rquote  me,\rquote  he said hastily, as Hermione made to pat his arm. He pulled his enormous spotted handkerchief from the pocket of his waistcoat and mopped his eyes with it. \lquote Look, I wouldn\rquote  be tellin\rquote 
 yer this at all if I didn\rquote  have ter. See, if I go ... well, I can\rquote  leave withou\rquote  ... withou\rquote  tellin\rquote  someone ... because I\rquote ll \endash  I\rquote ll need you two ter help me. An\rquote  Ron, if he\rquote s willin
\rquote .\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course we\rquote ll help you,\rquote  said Harry at once. \lquote What do you want us to do?\rquote 
\par Hagrid gave a great sniff and patted Harry wordlessly on the shoulder with such force Harry was knocked sideways into a tree.
\par \lquote I knew yeh\rquote d say yes,\rquote  said Hagrid into his handkerchief, \lquote but I won\rquote  ... never ... forget ... well ... c\rquote mon ... jus\rquote  a little bit fur\-ther through here ... watch yerselves, now, there\rquote 
s nettles ...\rquote 
\par They walked on in silence for another fifteen minutes; Harry had opened his mouth to ask how much further they had to go when Hagrid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop.
\par \lquote Really easy,\rquote  he said softly. \lquote Very quiet, now ...\rquote 
\par They crept forwards and Harry saw that they were facing a large, smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as Hagrid that he thought, with a jolt of dread, w
as sure to be the lair of some enormous animal. Trees had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound, so that it stood on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that formed a kind of fence or barricade, behind which Harry, H
ermione and Hagrid now stood.
\par \lquote Sleepin\rquote ,\rquote  breathed Hagrid.
\par Sure enough, Harry could hear a distant, rhythmic rumbling that sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work. He glanced sideways at Hermione, who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly open. She looked utterly terrified.
\par \lquote Hagrid,\rquote  she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature, \lquote who is he?\rquote 
\par Harry found this an odd question ... \lquote What is it?\rquote  was the one he had been planning on asking.
\par \lquote Hagrid, you told us \endash \rquote  said Hermione, her wand now shaking in her hand, \lquote you told us none of them wanted to come!\rquote 
\par Harry looked from her to Hagrid and then, as realisation hit him, he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror.

\par \lquote Well, tha\rquote s why it took so long, see,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Could on\rquote y travel by nigh\rquote  an\rquote  through wild country an\rquote  stuff. Course, he covers the ground pretty well when he wants ter, but he kep\rquote

\par \lquote Well, now \endash  \'93violent\'94 \endash  tha\rquote s a bit harsh,\rquote  said Hagrid, still twisting his hands agitatedly. \lquote I\rquote ll admit he mighta taken a couple o\rquote  swings at me when he\rquote s bin in a bad mood, but he
\rquote s gettin\rquote  better, loads better, settlin\rquote  down well.\rquote 
\par \lquote What are those ropes for, then?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par He had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest nearby trees towards the place where Grawp lay curled on the ground with his back to them.
\par \lquote You have to keep him tied up?\rquote  said Hermione faintly.
\par \lquote Well ... yeah ...\rquote  said Hagrid, looking anxious. \lquote See \endash  it\rquote s like I say \endash  he doesn\rquote  really know \rquote is own strength.\rquote 
\par Harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in this part of the Forest.
\par \lquote So, what is it you want Harry and Ron and me to do?\rquote  Hermione asked apprehensively.
\par \lquote Look after him,\rquote  said Hagrid croakily. \lquote After I\rquote m gone.\rquote 
\par Harry and Hermione exchanged miserable looks, Harry uncom\-fortably aware that he had already promised Hagrid that he would do whatever he asked.
\par \lquote What \endash  what does that involve, exactly?\rquote  Hermione enquired.
\par \lquote Not food or anythin\rquote !\rquote  said Hagrid eagerly. \lquote He can get his own food, no problem. Birds an\rquote  deer an\rquote  stuff ... no, it\rquote s company he needs. If I jus\rquote  knew someone was carryin\rquote  on tryin\rquote 
 ter help him a bit ... teachin\rquote  him, yeh know.\rquote 
\par Harry said nothing, but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in front of them. Unlike Hagrid, who simply looked like an oversized human, Gra
wp looked strangely misshapen. What Harry had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he now recognised as Grawp\rquote 
s head. It was much larger in proportion to the body than a human head, and was almost perfectly round and cove
red with tightly curling, close-growing hair the colour of bracken. The rim of a single large, fleshy ear was visible on top of the head, which seemed to sit, rather like Uncle Vernon\rquote 
s, directly upon the shoulders with little or no neck in between. The ba
ck, under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together, was very broad; and as Grawp slept, it seemed to strain a little at the rough seams of the skins. The legs were curled up under the body. Harry could see th
e soles of enormous, filthy, bare feet, large as sledges, resting one on top of the other on the earthy Forest floor.
\par \lquote You want us to teach him,\rquote  Harry said in a hollow voice. He now understood what Firenze\rquote s warning had meant. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 His attempt is not working. H

\par \lquote Yeah \endash  even if yeh jus\rquote  talk ter him a bit,\rquote  said Hagrid hope\-fully. \lquote \rquote Cause I reckon, if he can talk ter people, he\rquote ll understand more that we all like \rquote im really, an\rquote  want \rquote 
im ter stay.\rquote 
\par Harry looked at Hermione, who peered back at him from between the fingers over her face.
\par \lquote Kind of makes you wish we had Norbert back, doesn\rquote t it?\rquote  he said, and she gave a very shaky laugh.
\par \lquote Yeh\rquote ll do it, then?\rquote  said Hagrid, who did not seem to have caught what Harry had just said.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll ...\rquote  said Harry, already bound by his promise. We\rquote ll try, Hagrid.\rquote 
\par \lquote I knew I could count on yeh, Harry,\rquote  Hagrid said, beaming in a very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief again. \lquote An\rquote  I don\rquote  wan\rquote  yeh ter put yerself out too much, like ... I know yeh\rquote 
ve got exams ... if yeh could jus\rquote  nip down here in yer Invisibility Cloak maybe once a week an\rquote  have a little chat with \rquote im. I\rquote ll wake \rquote im up, then \endash  introduce yeh \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Wha\emdash  no!\rquote  said Hermione, jumping up. \lquote Hagrid, no, don\rquote t wake him, really, we don\rquote t need \endash \rquote 
\par But Hagrid had already stepped over the great tree trunk in front of them and was proceeding towards Grawp. When
 he was about ten feet away, he lifted a long, broken bough from the ground, smiled reassuringly over his shoulder at Harry and Hermione, then poked Grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough.
\par The giant gave a roar that echoed around th
e silent Forest; birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away. In front of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp was rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push him
self on to his knees. He turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him.
\par \lquote All righ\rquote , Grawpy?\rquote  said Hagrid, in a would-be cheery voice, backing away with the long bough raised, ready to poke Grawp again. \lquote Had a nice sleep, eh?\rquote 
\par Harry and Hermione retr
eated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights. Grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet uprooted. They looked up into his startlingly huge face that resembled a grey full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing. It wa
s
 as though the features had been hewn on to a great stone ball. The nose was stubby and shapeless, the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks; the eyes, small by giant standards, were a muddy greenish-brown and just now 
were half-gummed together with sleep. Grawp raised dirty knuckles, each as big as a cricket ball, to his eyes, rubbed vigorously, then, without warning, pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and agility.
\par \lquote Oh my!\rquote  Harry heard Hermione squeal, terrified, beside him.
\par The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp\rquote s wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously. He was, as Hagrid had said, at least sixteen feet tall. Gazing blearily around, Grawp reached out a hand the size of a beach
 umbrella, seized a bird\rquote 
s nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside-down with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it; eggs fell like grenades towards the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself.
\par \lquote Anyway, Grawpy,\rquote  shouted Hagrid, looking up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs, \lquote I\rquote ve brought some friends ter meet yeh. Remember, I told yeh I might? Remember, when I said I might have ter go on a little trip an
\rquote  leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit? Remember that, Grawpy?\rquote 
\par But Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard to say whether he was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognised the sounds Hagrid was making as speech. He had now seized the top of the pine tree
 and was pulling it towards him, evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go.
\par \lquote Now, Grawpy, don\rquote  do that!\rquote  shouted Hagrid. Tha\rquote s how you ended up pullin\rquote  up the others \endash \rquote 
\par And sure enough, Harry could see the earth around the tree\rquote s roots beginning to crack.
\par \lquote I got company for yeh!\rquote  Hagrid shouted. \lquote Company, see! Look down, yeh big buffoon, I brought yeh some friends!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, Hagrid, don\rquote t,\rquote  moaned Hermione, but Hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave Grawp\rquote s knee a sharp poke.
\par The giant let go of the top of the tree, which swayed alarmingly and deluged Hagrid with a rain of pine needles, and looked down.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote This,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
said Hagrid, hastening over to where Harry and Hermione stood, \lquote is Harry, Grawp! Harry Potter! He migh\rquote  be comin\rquote  ter visit yeh if I have ter go away, understand?\rquote 
\par The giant had only just realised that Harry and Hermione were there. They watched, in great trepidation, as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them.
\par \lquote An\rquote  this is Hermione, see? Her\emdash \rquote  Hagrid hesitated. Turning to Hermione, he said, \lquote Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy, Hermione? On\rquote y it\rquote s a difficult name fer him ter remember.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, not at all,\rquote  squeaked Hermione.
\par \lquote This is Hermy, Grawp! An\rquote  she\rquote s gonna be comin\rquote  an\rquote  all! Is\rquote n\rquote  tha\rquote  nice? Eh? Two friends fer yeh ter \endash  GRAWPY, NO!\rquote 
\par Grawp\rquote s hand had shot out of nowhere towards Hermione; Harry seized her and pulled her backwards behind the tree, so that Grawp\rquote s fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air.
\par \lquote BAD BOY, GRAWPY!\rquote  they heard Hagrid yelling, as Hermione clung to Harry behind the tree, shaking and whimpering. \lquote VERY BAD BOY! YEH DON\rquote  GRAB \endash  OUCH!\rquote 
\par Harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw Hagrid lying on his back, his hand over his nose. Grawp, apparently losing interest, had straightened up and was again engaged in pulling back the pine as far as it would go.
\par \lquote Righ\rquote ,\rquote  said Hagrid thickly, getting up with one hand pinching his bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow, \lquote well ... there yeh are ... yeh\rquote ve met him an\rquote  \endash  an\rquote  now he\rquote 
ll know yeh when yeh come back. Yeah ... well ...\rquote 
\par He looked up at Grawp, who was now pulling back the pine with an expression of detached pleasure on his boulderish face; the roots were creaking as he ripped them away from the ground.
\par \lquote Well, I reckon tha\rquote s enough fer one day,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote We\rquote ll \endash  er \endash  we\rquote ll go back now, shall we?\rquote 
\par Harry and Hermione nodded. Hagrid shouldered his crossbow again and, still pinching his nose, led the way back into the trees.
\par Nobody spoke for a while, not even when they heard the dis\-tant crash that meant Grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last. Hermione\rquote 
s face was pale and set. Harry could not think of a single thing to say. What on earth was going to happen when somebody found out that Hagrid had hidden Grawp in the Forbidden Forest? And he had promised that he, Ron and Hermione would continue Hagrid
\rquote s totally pointless attempts to civilise the giant. How could Hagrid, even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were loveably harmless, fool himself that Grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans?
\par \lquote Hold it,\rquote  said Hagrid abruptly, just as Harry and Hermione were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him. He pulled an arrow out 
of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the crossbow. Harry and Hermione raised their wands; now that they had stopped walking, they, too, could hear movement close by.
\par \lquote Oh, blimey,\rquote  said Hagrid quietly.
\par \lquote I thought we told you, Hagrid,\rquote  said a deep male voice, \lquote that you are no longer welcome here?\rquote 
\par A man\rquote s naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating towards them through the dappled green half-light; then they saw that his waist joined smoothly into a horse\rquote s chestnut body. This centaur had a
 proud, high-cheekboned face and long black hair. Like Hagrid, he was armed; a quiverful of arrows and a longbow were slung over his shoulders.
\par \lquote How are yeh, Magorian?\rquote  said Hagrid warily.
\par The trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more cen\-taur
s emerged behind him. Harry recognised the black-bodied and bearded Bane, whom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met Firenze. Bane gave no sign that he had ever seen Harry before.
\par \lquote So,\rquote  he said, with a nasty inflection in his voice, before turning immediately to Magorian. \lquote We agreed, I think, what we would do if this human ever showed his face in the Forest again?\rquote 
\par \lquote \'93This human\'94 now, am I?\rquote  said Hagrid testily. \lquote Jus\rquote  fer stoppin\rquote  all of yeh committin\rquote  murder?\rquote 
\par \lquote You ought not to have meddled, Hagrid,\rquote  said Magorian. \lquote Our ways are not yours, nor are our laws. Firenze has betrayed and dishonoured us.\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno how yeh work that out,\rquote  said Hagrid impatiently. \lquote He\rquote s done nothin\rquote  except help Albus Dumbledore \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Firenze has entered into servitude to humans,\rquote  said a grey cen\-taur with a hard, deeply lined face.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Servitude!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said Hagrid scathingly. \lquote He\rquote s doin
\rquote  Dumbledore a favour is all \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans,\rquote  said Magorian quietly. \lquote There can be no return from such disgrace.\rquote 
\par \lquote If yeh say so,\rquote  said Hagrid, shrugging, \lquote but personally I think yeh\rquote re makin\rquote  a big mistake \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote As are you, human,\rquote  said Bane, \lquote coming back into our Forest when we warned you \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Now, yeh listen ter me,\rquote  said Hagrid angrily. \lquote I\rquote ll have less of the \'93our\'94 Forest, if it\rquote s all the same ter yeh. It\rquote s not up ter yeh who comes an\rquote  goes in here \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No more is it up to you, Hagrid,\rquote  said Magorian smoothly. \lquote I shall let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote re not his!\rquote  interrupted Bane contemptuously. \lquote Students, Magorian, from up at the school! They have probably already prof\-ited from the traitor Firenze\rquote s teachings.\rquote 
\par \lquote Nevertheless,\rquote  said Magorian calmly, \lquote the slaughter of foals is a terrible crime \endash  we do not touch the innocent. Today, Hagrid, you pass. Henceforth, stay away from this place. You forfeited the friend\-
ship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor Firenze escape us.\rquote 
\par \lquote I won\rquote  be kept outta the Fores\rquote  by a bunch o\rquote  old mules like yeh!\rquote  said Hagrid loudly.
\par \lquote Hagrid,\rquote  said Hermione in a high-pitched and terrified voice, as both Bane and the grey centaur pawed at the ground, \lquote let\rquote s go, please let\rquote s go!\rquote 
\par Hagrid moved forwards, but his crossbow was still raised and his eyes were still fixed threateningly upon Magorian.
\par \lquote We know what you are keeping in the Forest, Hagrid!\rquote  Magorian called after them, as the centaurs slipped out of sight. \lquote And our tolerance is waning!\rquote 
\par Hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk straight back to Magorian.
\par \lquote Yeh\rquote ll tolerate \rquote im as long as he\rquote s here, it\rquote s as much his Forest as yours!\rquote  he yelled, as Harry and Hermione both pushed with all their might against Hagrid\rquote 
s moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him moving forwards. Still scowling, he looked down; his expres\-sion changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him; he seemed not to have felt it.
\par \lquote Calm down, you two,\rquote  he said, turning to walk on while they panted along behind him. \lquote Ruddy old mules, though, eh?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hagrid,\rquote  said Hermione breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there, \lquote if the centaurs don\rquote t want humans in the Forest, it doesn\rquote t really look as though Harry and I will be able \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, you heard what they said,\rquote  said Hagrid dismissively, \lquote they wouldn\rquote t hurt foals \endash  I mean, kids. Anyway, we can\rquote  let ourselves be pushed aroun\rquote  by that lot.\rquote 
\par \lquote Nice try,\rquote  Harry murmured to Hermione, who looked crest\-fallen.
\par At last they rejoined the path and, after another ten minutes, the trees began to thin; they were able to see patches of clear blue sky again and, in the distance, the definite sounds of cheering and shouting.
\par \lquote Was that another goal?\rquote  asked Hagrid, pausing in the shelter of the trees as the Quidditch stadium came into view. \lquote Or d\rquote yeh reckon the match is over?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote 
 said Hermione miserably. Harry saw that she looked much the worse for wear; her hair was full of twigs and leaves, her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on her face and arms. He knew he must look little better.
\par \lquote I reckon it\rquote s over, yeh know!\rquote  said Hagrid, still squinting towards the stadium. \lquote Look \endash  there\rquote s people comin\rquote  out already \endash  if yeh two hurry yeh\rquote ll be able ter blend in with the crowd an
\rquote  no one\rquote ll know yeh weren\rquote t there!\rquote 
\par \lquote Good idea,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Well ... see you later, then, Hagrid.\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t believe him,\rquote  said Hermione in a very unsteady voice, the moment they were out of earshot of Hagrid. \lquote I don\rquote t believe him. I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Oh, come off it, Harry!\rquote  said Hermione angrily, stopping dead in her tracks so that the people behind had to swerve to avoid her. \lquote Of course he\rquote s going to be chucked out and, to be perfectly honest, after what we\rquote

 he concluded modestly, sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest to them \endash  a bunch of gossiping third-year Hufflepuffs \endash  had heard him.

\par \lquote I\rquote m not,\rquote  said Harry quickl

\par \lquote I suppose she cried, did she?\rquote  said Harry bitterly.

\par \lquote Er \endash \rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well, actually ... no, Ron,\rquote  said Hermione with a heavy sigh, putting down her book and looking at him apologetically. \lquote As a matter of fact, the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies\rquote s first goal.\rquote 
\par Ron\rquote s carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment. \lquote You didn\rquote t watch?\rquote  he said faintly, looking from one to the other. \lquote You didn\rquote t see me make any of those saves?\rquote

s mind, though he did wonder occasionally duri
ng Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told Snape that he must continue giving Harry Occlumency tuition. If he had, then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring Harry. This suited Harry very well; he was quite busy and tense enough
 without extra classes with Snape, and to his relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about Occlumency; she was spending a lot of time muttering to herself, and had not laid out any elf clothes for days.
\par She was not the only person acting oddly as the OWLs drew steadily nearer. Ernie Macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their revision practices.
\par \lquote How many hours d\rquote you think you\rquote re doing a day?\rquote  he demanded of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam in his eyes.
\par \lquote I dunno,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote A few.\rquote 
\par \lquote More or less than eight?\rquote 
\par \lquote Less, I s\rquote pose,\rquote  said Ron, looking slightly alarmed.

\par Harry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point, forcing Ernie to abandon his recital.
\par Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce panic.
\par \lquote Of course, it\rquote s not what you know,\rquote  he was heard to tell Crabbe and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to start, \lquote it\rquote s who you know. Now, Father\rquote

\par \lquote Nothing we can do about it if it is,\rquote  said Ron gloomily.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think it\rquote s true,\rquote  said Neville quietly from behind them. \lquote Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran\rquote s, and she\rquote s never mentioned the Malfoys.\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s she like, Neville?\rquote  asked Hermione at once. \lquote Is she strict?\rquote 
\par \lquote Bit like Gran, really,\rquote  said Neville in a subdued voice.
\par \lquote Knowing her won\rquote t hurt your chances, though, will it?\rquote  Ron told him encouragingly.
\par \lquote Oh, I don\rquote t think it will make any difference,\rquote  said Neville, still more miserably. \lquote Gran\rquote s always telling Professor Marchbanks I\rquote m not as good as my dad ... well ... you saw what she\rquote s like at St Mungo
\rquote s ...\rquote 
\par Neville looked fixedly at the floor. Harry, Ron and Hermione glanced at each other, but didn\rquote t know what to say. It was the first time Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital.
\par Meanwhile, a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concen\-tration, mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth- and seventh-years. Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffio\rquote 
s Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth-year Eddie Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine \lquote Outstanding\rquote 
 OWLs he had gained the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons. Ron assured Harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts and got a job, but before they could close the dea
l, Hermione had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet.
\par \lquote Hermione, we wanted to buy that!\rquote  shouted Ron.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be stupid,\rquote  she snarled. \lquote You might as well take Harold Dingle\rquote s powdered dragon claw and have done with it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Dingle\rquote s got powdered dragon claw?\rquote  said Ron eagerly.
\par \lquote Not any more,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote I confiscated that, too. None of these things actually work, you know.\rquote 
\par \lquote Dragon claw does work!\rquote  said Ron. \lquote It\rquote s supposed to be incredible, really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few hours \endash  Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, it can\rquote t hurt \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote This stuff can,\rquote  said Hermione grimly. \lquote I\rquote ve had a look at it, and it\rquote s actually dried Doxy droppings.\rquote 
\par This information took the edge off Harry and Ron\rquote s desire for brain stimulants.
\par They received their examination timetables and details of the procedure for OWLs during their next Transfiguration lesson.
\par \lquote As you can see,\rquote  Professor McGonagall told the class as they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the black\-board, \lquote 
your OWLs are spread over two successive weeks. You will sit the theory papers in the mornings and the practice in the after\-noons. Your practical Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at night.
\par \lquote Now, I must wa
rn you that the most stringent anti-cheating charms have been applied to your examination papers. Auto-Answer Quills are banned from the examination hall, as are Remembralls, Detachable Cribbing Cuffs and Self-Correcting Ink. Every year, I am afraid to sa
y, seems to harbour at least one stu\-dent who thinks that he or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authority\rquote s rules. I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor. Our new \endash  Headmistress \endash \rquote 
 Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that Aunt Petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stub\-born bit of dirt \lquote \endash  has asked the Heads of House to tell their stu\-
dents that cheating will be punished most severely \endash  because, of course, your examination results will reflect upon the Headmistress\rquote s new regime at the school \endash \rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall gave a tiny sigh; Harry saw the nostrils of her sharp nose flare.
\par \lquote \endash  however, that is no reason not to do your very best. You have your own futures to think about.\rquote 
\par \lquote Please, Professor,\rquote  said Hermione, her hand in the air, \lquote when will we find out our results?\rquote 
\par \lquote An owl will be sent to you some time in July,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall.
\par \lquote Excellent,\rquote  said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, \lquote so we don\rquote t have to worry about it till the holidays.\rquote 
\par Harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks\rquote  time, waiting for his OWL results. Well, he thought, at least he would be sure of one bit of post that summer.
\par Their first examination, Theory of Charms, was scheduled fo
r Monday morning. Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday, but regretted it almost at once; she was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had got the answer completely right, finally hitting him hard on the 
nose with the sharp edge of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Achievements in Charming.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote Why don\rquote t you just do it yourself?\rquote  he said firmly, handing the book back to her, his eyes watering.
\par Meanwhile, Ron was reading two years\rquote  worth of Charms notes with his fingers in his ears, his lips moving soundlessly; Seamus Finnigan was lying flat on his back on the floor, reciting the def\-
inition of a Substantive Charm while Dean checked it against }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Standard Book of Spells, Grade }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 5; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practising basic Locomotion Charms, were making their pencil-cases race each other around the edge of the table.
\par Dinner was a subdued affair that night. Harry and Ron did not talk much, but ate with gusto, having studied h
ard all day. Hermione, on the other hand, kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag, from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure. Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she woul
d not sleep that night, when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate.
\par \lquote Oh, my goodness,\rquote  she said faintly, staring into the Entrance Hall. \lquote Is that them? Is that the examiners?\rquote 
\par Harry and Ron whipped around on their bench. Through the doors to the Great Hall they could see Umbridge standing with a small group of ancient-looking witches and wizards. Umbridge, Harry was pleased to see, looked rather nervous.
\par \lquote Shall we go and have a closer look?\rquote  said Ron.
\par Harry and Hermio
ne nodded and they hastened towards the double doors into the Entrance Hall, slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners. Harry thought Professor Marchbanks must be the tiny, stooped witch with a face so lined it lo
oked as though it had been draped in cobwebs; Umbridge was speaking to her deferentially. Professor Marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf; she was answering Professor Umbridge very loudly considering they were only a foot apart.
\par \lquote Journey was fine, journey was fine, we\rquote ve made it plenty of times before!\rquote  she said impatiently. \lquote Now, I haven\rquote t heard from Dumbledore lately!\rquote 
 she added, peering around the Hall as though hopeful he might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard. \lquote No idea where he is, I suppose?\rquote 
\par \lquote None at all,\rquote  said Umbridge, shooting a malevolent look at Harry, Ron and Hermione, who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as Ron pretended to do up his shoelace. \lquote 
But I daresay the Ministry of Magic will track him down soon enough.\rquote 
\par \lquote I doubt it,\rquote  shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks, \lquote not if Dumbledore doesn\rquote t want to be found! I should know ... exam\-ined him personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did NEWTs ... did things with a wand I\rquote 
d never seen before.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes ... well ...\rquote  said Professor Umbridge as Harry, Ron and Hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they dared, \lquote let me show you to the staff room. I daresay you\rquote d like a cup of tea after your journey.
\rquote 
\par It was an uncomfortable sort of an evening. Everyone was tr
ying to do some last-minute revising but nobody seemed to be getting very far. Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours. He remembered his careers consultation and McGonagall\rquote 
s furious declaration that she would help him become a
n Auror if it was the last thing she did. He wished he had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here. He knew he was not the only one lying awake, but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally, one by one, they fell asle
ep.
\par None of the fifth-years talked very much at breakfast next day, either: Parvati was practising incantations under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched; Hermione was rereading }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

lurred; and Neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade.
\par Once breakfast was over, the fifth- and seventh-years milled around in the Entrance Hall while the other students went off to lessons; then, at half past nine, they were 
called forwards class by class to re-enter the Great Hall, which had been rearranged exactly as Harry had seen it in the Pensieve when his father, Sirius and Snape had been taking their OWLs; the four house tables had been removed and replaced instead wit
h many tables for one, all facing the staff-table end of the Hall where Professor McGonagall stood facing them. When they were all seated and quiet, she said, \lquote You may begin,\rquote 
 and turned over an enormous hour-glass on the desk beside her, on which there were also spare quills, ink bottles and rolls of parchment.
\par Harry turned over his paper, his heart thumping hard \endash  three rows to his right and four seats ahead Hermione was already scrib\-bling \endash  and lowered his eyes to the first question: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll ... smiling slightly, he bent over the paper and began to write.

ve been through this before ... we\rquote re not going through every exam afterwards, it\rquote s bad enough doing them once.\rquote 
\par The fifth-years ate lunch
 with the rest of the school (the four house tables had reappeared for the lunch hour), then they trooped off into the small chamber beside the Great Hall, where they were to wait until called for their practical examination. As small groups of students w
ere called forwards in alphabetical order, those left behind muttered incantations and practised wand movements, occasionally poking each other in the back or eye by mistake.
\par Hermione\rquote s name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle and Daphne Greengrass. Students who had already been tested did not return afterwards, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.
\par \lquote She\rquote ll be fine, remember she got a hundred and twelve per cent on one of our Charms tests?\rquote  said Ron.
\par Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, \lquote Parkinson, Pansy \endash  Patil, Padma \endash  Patil, Parvati \endash  Potter, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good luck,\rquote  said Ron quietly. Harry walked into the Great Hall, clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook.
\par \lquote Professor Tofty is free, Potter,\rquote 
 squeaked Professor Flitwick, who was standing just inside the door. He pointed Harry towards what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner, a short distance from Professor Marchbanks, who w
as halfway through testing Draco Malfoy.
\par \lquote Potter, is it?\rquote  said Professor Tofty, consulting his notes and peering over his pince-nez at Harry as he approached. \lquote The famous Potter?\rquote 
\par Out of the corner of his eye, Harry distinctly saw Malfoy throw a scathing look over at him; the wine-glass Malfoy had been levi\-tating fell to the floor and smashed. Harry could not suppress a grin; Professor Tofty smiled back at him encouragingly.

\par \lquote That\rquote s it,\rquote  he said in his quavery old voice, \lquote no need to be nervous. Now, if I could ask you to take this egg cup and make it do some cartwheels for me.\rquote 
\par On the whole, Harry thought it went rather well. His Levitation Charm was certainly much better than Malfoy\rquote 
s had been, though he wished he had not mixed up the incantations for Colour Change and Growth Charms, so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before Harry could rectify his mistake. He was gla
d Hermione had not been in the Hall at the time and neglected to mention it to her afterwards. He could tell Ron, though; Ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened.
\par There was no time to relax that night; they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in revision for Transfiguration next day; Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with complex spell models and theories.
\par He forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during h
is written paper next morning but thought his practical could have been a lot worse. At least he managed to Vanish the whole of his iguana, whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret in
to a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall.
\par They had their Herbology exam on Wednesday (other than a small bite from a Fanged Geranium, Harry felt he had done rea\-s
onably well); and then, on Thursday, Defence Against the Dark Arts. Here, for the first time, Harry felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing 
all the counter-jinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from near the doors into the Entrance Hall.
\par \lquote Oh, bravo!\rquote  cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, when Harry demonstrated a perfect Boggart banishing spell. \lquote Very good indeed! Well, I think that\rquote s all, Potter ... unless ...\rquote 
\par He leaned forwards a little.
\par \lquote I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can pro\-duce a Patronus? For a bonus point ... ?\rquote 
\par Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge and imag\-ined her being sacked.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Expecto patronum!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par His silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the Hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically.

\par \lquote Excellent!\rquote  he said. \lquote Very well, Potter, you may go!\rquote 
\par As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door, their eyes met. There was a nasty smile playing around her wide, slack mouth, but he did not care. Unles
s he was very much mistaken (and he was not planning on telling anybody, in case he was), he had just achieved an \lquote Outstanding\rquote  OWL.
\par On Friday, Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat her Ancient Runes exam, and as they had the whole weekend in fron
t of them they permitted themselves a break from revision. They stretched and yawned beside the open window, through which warm summer air was wafting as they played wizard chess. Harry could see Hagrid in the distance, teaching a class on the edge of the
 Forest. He was trying to guess what creatures they were exam\-ining \endash  he thought it must be unicorns, because the boys seemed to be standing back a little \endash 
 when the portrait hole opened and Hermione clambered in, looking thoroughly bad-tempered.
\par \lquote How were the Runes?\rquote  said Ron, yawning and stretching.
\par \lquote I mis-translated }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 ehwaz,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said Hermione furiously. \lquote It means

\par \lquote He\rquote s teaching at the moment; she can\rquote t blame him,\rquote  said Harry, gesturing out of the window.
\par \lquote Oh, you\rquote re so }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 na}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\insrsid11862148 \'ef}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

 said Hermione, who seemed determined to be in a towering temper, and she swept off towards the girls\rquote  dormi\-tories, banging the door behind her.
\par \lquote Such a lovely, sweet-tempered girl,\rquote  said Ron, very quietly, prod\-ding his queen forward to beat up one of Harry\rquote s knights.
\par Hermione\rquote s bad mood persisted for most of the weekend, though Harry and Ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of Saturday and Sunday revising for Potions on Monday, the exam which Harry had been looking forward to least \endash  and 
which he was sure would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an Auror. Sure enough, he found the written paper difficult, though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice Potion; he could describe its effects accurately
, having taken it illegally in his second year.
\par The afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected it to be. With Snape absent from the proceedings, he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions. Neville, who was sitting very near Harry, also looked hap\-
pier than Harry had ever seen him during a Potions class. When Professor Marchbanks said, \lquote Step away from your cauldrons, please, the examination is over,\rquote  Harry corked his sample flask feeling that he might not h
ave achieved a good grade but he had, with luck, avoided a fail.
\par \lquote Only four exams left,\rquote  said Parvati Patil wearily as they headed back to Gryffindor common room.
\par \lquote Only!\rquote  said Hermione snappishly. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote I\rquote ve}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
 got Arithmancy and it\rquote s probably the toughest subject there is!\rquote 
\par Nobody was foolish enough to snap back, so she was unable to vent her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some first-years for giggling too loudly in the common room.
\par Harry was determined to perform well in Tuesday\rquote s Care of Magical Creatures exam so as not to let Hagrid down. The prac\-
tical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, where students were required to cor\-rectly identify the Knarl hidden among a dozen hedgeh
ogs (the trick was to offer them all milk in turn: Knarls, highly suspicious creatures whose quills had many magical properties, generally went berserk at what they saw as an attempt to poison them); then demonstrate correct handling of a Bowtruckle; feed
 and clean out a Fire Crab without sustaining serious burns; and choose, from a wide selection of food, the diet they would give a sick unicorn.
\par Harry could see Hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin window. When Harry\rquote s examiner, a plump little witch this time, smiled at him and told him he could leave, Harry gave Hagrid a fleeting thumbs-up before heading back to the castle.
\par The Astronomy theory paper on Wednesday morning went well enough. Harry was not convinced he had got the names of all Jupiter\rquote s m
oons right, but was at least confident that none of them was inhabited by mice. They had to wait until evening for their practical Astronomy; the afternoon was devoted instead to Divination.
\par Even by Harry\rquote s low standards in Divination, the exam went very b
adly. He might as well have tried to see moving pictures on the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball; he lost his head completely during tea-leaf reading, saying it looked to him as though Professor Marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round, 
dark, soggy stranger, and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous Tuesday.
\par \lquote Well, we were always going to fail that one,\rquote  said Ron gloomily as they ascended the
 marble staircase. He had just made Harry feel rather better by telling him how he had told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball, only to look up and realise he had been describing his examiner\rquote 
s reflection.
\par \lquote We shouldn\rquote t have taken the stupid subject in the first place,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Still, at least we can give it up now.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote No more pretending we care what happens when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly.\rquote 
\par \lquote And from now on, I don\rquote t care if my tea-leaves spell }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 die, Ron, die \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 I\rquote m just chucking them in the bin where they belong.\rquote 
\par Harry laughed just as Hermione came running up behind them. He stopped laughing at once, in case it annoyed her.
\par \lquote Well, I think I\rquote ve done all right in Arithmancy,\rquote  she said, and Harry and Ron both sighed with relief. \lquote Just time for a quick look over our star-charts before dinner, then ...\rquote 
\par When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven o\rquote clock, they found a perfect night for stargazing, cloudless and still
. The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight and there was a slight chill in the air. Each of them set up his or her telescope and, when Professor Marchbanks gave the word, proceeded to fill in the blank star-chart they had been given.
\par Professors Marchba
nks and Tofty strolled among them, watching as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets they were observing. All was quiet except for the rustle of parchment, the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand, and the 
scribbling of many quills. Half an hour passed, then an hour; the little squares of reflected gold light flickering on the ground below started to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished.
\par As Harry completed the constellation Orion on his chart, how\-
ever, the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where he was standing, so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn. Harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment to the position of his telescop
e and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more.
\par Harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it, now examining Venus. He looked down at his chart to enter the planet there, but something distracted him; pausing with his quill sus\-
pended over the parchment, he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn. If they had not been moving, and the moonlight h
ad not been gilding the tops of their heads, they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they walked. Even at this distance, Harry had a funny feeling he recognised the walk of the squattest of them, who seemed to be leading the g
roup.
\par He could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll out\-side after midnight, much less accompanied by five others. Then somebody coughed behind him, and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam. He had quite forgotten Venus\rquote 
s position. J
amming his eye to his telescope, he found it again and was once more about to enter it on his chart when, alert for any odd sound, he heard a distant knock which echoed through the deserted grounds, followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large d
og.
\par He looked up, his heart hammering. There were lights on in Hagrid\rquote 
s windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them. The door opened and he distinctly saw six sharply defined figures walk over the threshold. The door closed again and there was silence.
\par Harry felt very uneasy. He glanced around to see whether Ron or Hermione had noticed what he had, but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment and, not wanting to look as though he was sneaking looks at anyone else\rquote 
s work, Harry hastily bent over his star-chart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet towards Hagrid\rquote s cabin. Figures were now moving across the cabin win\-dows, temporarily blocking the light.

\par He could feel Professor Marchbanks\rquote 
s eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope, staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago, but as Professor Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant
 cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower. Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid\rquote s cabin.
\par Professor Tofty gave another dry little cough.
\par \lquote Try and concentrate, now, boys and girls,\rquote  he said softly.
\par Most people returned to their telescopes. Harry looked to his left. Hermione was gazing transfixed at Hagrid\rquote s cabin.
\par \lquote Ahem \endash  twenty minutes to go,\rquote  said Professor Tofty.
\par Hermione jumped and returned at once to her star-chart; Harry looked down at his own and noticed that he had mis-labelled Venus as Mars. He bent to correct it.
\par There was a loud BANG from the grounds. Several people cried \lquote Ouch!\rquote  when they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes as they hastened to see what was going on below.
\par Hagrid\rquote s door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly, a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists, surrounded by six people, all of
 whom, judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction, seemed to be attempting to Stun him.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  cried Hermione.
\par \lquote My dear!\rquote  said Professor Tofty in a scandalised voice. \lquote This is an examination!\rquote 
\par But nobody was paying the slightest attention to their star-charts any more. Jets of red light were still flying about beside Hagrid\rquote 
s cabin, yet somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him; he was still upright and still, as far as Harry could see, fighting. Cries and yells echoed across the grounds; a man yelled, \lquote Be reasonable, Hagrid!\rquote 
\par Hagrid roared, \lquote Reasonable be damned, yeh won\rquote  take me like this, Dawlish!\rquote 
\par Harry could see the tiny outline of Fang, attempting to defend Hagrid, leaping repeatedly at th
e wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell caught him and he fell to the ground. Hagrid gave a howl of fury, lifted the culprit bodily from the ground and threw him; the man flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again. Hermione gasped, b
oth hands over her mouth; Harry looked round at Ron and saw that he, too, was looking scared. None of them had ever seen Hagrid in a real temper before.
\par \lquote Look!\rquote  squealed Parvati, who was leaning over the parapet and pointing to the foot of the castle where 
the front doors had opened again; more light was spilling out on to the dark lawn and a single long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn.
\par \lquote Now, really!\rquote  said Professor Tofty anxiously. \lquote Only sixteen min\-utes left, you know!\rquote 
\par But nobody paid him the slightest attention: they were watching the person now sprinting towards the battle beside Hagrid\rquote s cabin.
\par \lquote How dare you!\rquote  the figure shouted as she ran. \lquote How }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 dare }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 you!
\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s McGonagall!\rquote  whispered Hermione.
\par \lquote Leave him alone! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Alone, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 I say!\rquote  said Professor McGonagall\rquote 
s voice through the darkness. \lquote On what grounds are you attacking him? He has done nothing, nothing to warrant such \endash \rquote 
\par Hermione, Parvati and Lavender all screamed. The figures around the cabin had shot no fewer than four Stunners at Professor McGonagall. Halfway between cabin and castle the red beams col\-
lided with her; for a moment she looked luminous and glowed an eerie red, then she lifted right off her feet, landed hard on her back, and moved no more.
\par \lquote Galloping gargoyles!\rquote  shouted Professor Tofty, who also seemed to have forgotten the exam completely. \lquote Not so much as a warning! Outrageous behaviour!\rquote 
\par \lquote COWARDS!\rquote  bellowed Hagrid; his voice carried clearly to the top of the tower, and several lights flickered back on inside the castle. \lquote RUDDY COWARDS! HAVE SOME O\rquote  THAT \endash  AN\rquote  THAT \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh my \endash \rquote  gasped Hermione.
\par Hagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers; judging by their immediate collapse, they had been knocked cold. Harry saw Hagrid double over, and thought he had finally been over\-
come by a spell. But, on the contrary, next moment Hagrid was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back \endash  then Harry realised that Fang\rquote s limp body was draped around his shoulders.
\par \lquote Get him, get him!\rquote  screamed Umbridge, but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of Hagrid\rquote 
s fists; indeed, he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over. Hagrid had turned and begun to run with Fang still hung around his neck. Umbridge sent
 one last Stunning Spell after him but it missed; and Hagrid, running full-pelt towards the distant gates, disappeared into the darkness.
\par There was a long minute\rquote s quivering silence as everybody gazed open-mouthed into the grounds. Then Professor Tofty\rquote s voice said feebly, \lquote Um ... five minutes to go, everybody.\rquote 
\par Though he had only filled in two-thirds of his chart, Harry was desperate for the exam to end. When it came at last he, Ron and Hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders a
nd dashed back down the spiral staircase. None of the students were going to bed; they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what they had witnessed.
\par \lquote That evil woman!\rquote  gasped Hermione, who seemed to be having difficulty talking due to rage. \lquote Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the dead of night!\rquote 
\par \lquote She clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawney\rquote s,\rquote  said Ernie Macmillan sagely, squeezing over to join them.
\par \lquote Hagrid did well, didn\rquote t he?\rquote  said Ron, who looked more alarmed than impressed. \lquote How come all the spells bounced off him?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote ll be his giant blood,\rquote  said Hermione shakily. \lquote It\rquote s very hard to Stun a giant, they\rquote re like trolls, really tough ... but poor Professor McGonagall ... four Stunners straight in the chest and she\rquote 
s not exactly young, is she?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dreadful, dreadful,\rquote  said Ernie, shaking his head pompously. \lquote Well, I\rquote m off to bed. Night, all.\rquote 
\par People around them were drifting away, still talking excitedly about what they had just seen.
\par \lquote At least they didn\rquote t get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I \rquote spect he\rquote s gone to join Dumbledore, hasn\rquote t he?\rquote 
\par \lquote I suppose so,\rquote  said Hermione, who looked tearful. \lquote Oh, this is awful, I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now we\rquote ve lost Hagrid too.\rquote 
\par They traip
sed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full. The commotion out in the grounds had woken several people, who had hastened to rouse their friends. Seamus and Dean, who had arrived ahead of Harry, Ron and Hermione, were now telling everyone what t

\par \lquote But why sack Hagrid now?\rquote  asked Angelina Johnson, shaking her head. \lquote It\rquote s not like Trelawney; he\rquote s been teaching much better than usual this year!\rquote 
\par \lquote Umbridge hates part-humans,\rquote  said Hermione bitterly, flopping down into an armchair. \lquote She was always going to try and get Hagrid out.\rquote 
\par \lquote And she thought Hagrid was putting Nifflers in her office,\rquote  piped up Katie Bell.
\par \lquote Oh, blimey,\rquote  said Lee Jordan, covering his mouth. \lquote It\rquote s me who\rquote s been putting the Nifflers in her office. Fred and George left me a couple; I\rquote ve been levitating them in through her window.\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote d have sacked him anyway,\rquote  said Dean. \lquote He was too close to Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s true,\rquote  said Harry, sinking into an armchair beside Hermione\rquote s.
\par \lquote I just hope Professor McGonagall\rquote s all right,\rquote  said Lavender tear\-fully.
\par \lquote They carried her back up to the castle, we watched through the dormitory window,\rquote  said Colin Creevey. \lquote She didn\rquote t look very well.\rquote 
\par \lquote Madam Pomfrey will sort her out,\rquote  said Alicia Spinnet firmly. \lquote She\rquote s never failed yet.\rquote 
\par It was nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared. Harry felt wide awake; the image of Hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him; he was so angry with Umbridge he could not think of a punishment bad enough for her, though Ron
\rquote s suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts had its merits. He fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested.
\par Their
 final exam, History of Magic, was not to take place until that afternoon. Harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast, but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of last-minute revision, so instead he sat with his head in h
is hands by the common-room window, trying hard not to doze off as he read through some of the three-and-a-half-feet-high stack of notes that Hermione had lent him.
\par The fifth-years entered the Great Hall at two o\rquote clock and took their places in front of thei
r face-down examination papers. Harry felt exhausted. He just wanted this to be over, so that he could go and sleep; then tomorrow, he and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch pitch \endash  he was going to have a fly on Ron\rquote s broom \endash 
 and savour their freedom from revision.
\par \lquote Turn over your papers,\rquote  said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Hall, flicking over the giant hour-glass. \lquote You may begin.\rquote 
\par Harry stared fixedly at the first question. It was several seconds before it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it; there was a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high win\-
dows. Slowly, tortuously, he at last began to write an answer.
\par He was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates. He simply skipped question four }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
(In your opinion, did wand legislation contribute to, or lead to better control of, goblin riots of the eighteenth century?), }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
thinking that he would go back to it if he had time at the end. He had a stab at question five }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 (How was the Statute of Se
crecy breached in 1749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence?) }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several important points; he had a feeling vampires had come into the story somewhere.
\par He looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eyes alighted upon number ten: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
Describe the circumstances that led to the formation of the International Confederation of Wizards and explain why the warlocks of Liechtenstein refused to join.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

is brain felt torpid and slack. He could visualise a heading, in Hermione\rquote s handwriting: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The for\-mation of the International Confederation of Wizards }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 ... he had read those notes only this morning.
\par He began to write, looking up now and again to check the large hour-glass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks. He was sit\-
ting right behind Parvati Patil, whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair. Once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when she moved 
her head slightly, and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par All around Harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurry\-ing, burrowing rats. The sun was very hot on the back of his head. What was it that Bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of Liechtenstein? Harry had a feeling it had something to d
o with trolls ... he gazed blankly at the back of Parvati\rquote 
s head again. If he could only perform Legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between Pierre Bonaccord and Liechtenstein ...
\par Harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands, so that the glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool. Bonaccord had wanted to stop troll-hunting and give the trolls rights ... but Liechtenstein was having problems with a tribe of particularl
y vicious mountain trolls ... that was it.
\par He opened his eyes; they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing white parchment. Slowly, he wrote two lines about the trolls, then read through what he had done so far. It did not seem very informative or detailed, yet he was sure Hermione\rquote 
s notes on the Confederation had gone on for pages and pages.
\par He closed his eyes again, trying to see them, trying to remember ... the Confederation had met for the first time in France, yes, he had written that already ...
\par Goblins had tried to attend and been ousted ... he had written that, too ...
\par And nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come ...
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Think, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
he told himself, his face in his hands, while all around him quills scratched out never-ending answers and the sand trickled through the hour-glass at the front ...
\par He was walking along the cool, dark corridor to the Department of Mysteries again, walking with a firm and purposeful tread, breaking occasionally into a run, determined to reach his destina\-tion at last ... 
the black door swung open for him as usual, and here he was in the circular room with its many doors ...
\par Straight across the stone floor and through the second door ... patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking, but no time to explore, he must hurry ...
\par He jogged the last few feet to the third door, which swung open just like the others ...
\par Once again he was in the cathedral-sized room full of shelves and glass spheres ... his heart was beating very fast now ... he was going to get there this time ... when he reached number ninety-seven he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two 
rows ...
\par But there was a shape on the floor at the very end, a black shape moving on the floor like a wounded animal ... Harry\rquote s stomach contracted with fear ... with excitement ...
\par A voice issued from his own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of any human kindness ...
\par \lquote Take it for me ... lift it down, now ... I cannot touch it ... but you can ...\rquote 
\par The black shape on the floor shifted a little. Harry saw a long-fingered white hand clutching a wand rise at the end of his own arm ... heard the high, cold voice say }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Crucio!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par The man on the floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand but fell back, writhing. Harry was laughing. He raised his wand, the curse lifted and the figure groaned and became motion\-less.
\par \lquote Lord Voldemort is waiting ...\rquote 
\par Very slowly, his arms trembling, the man on the ground raised his shoulders a few inches and lifted his head. His face was blood-stained and gaunt, twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance ...
\par \lquote You\rquote ll have to kill me,\rquote  whispered Sirius.
\par \lquote Undoubtedly I shall in the end,\rquote  said the cold voice. \lquote But you will fetch it for me first, Black ... you think you have felt pain thus far? Think again ... we have hours ahead of us and nobody to hear you scream ...\rquote 
\par But somebody screamed as Voldemort lowered his wand again; somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk on to the cold stone floor; Harry awoke as he hit the ground, still yelling, his scar on fire, as the Great Hall erupted all around him.

He was gibbering as he tried to pull away from Professor Tofty, who was looking at Harry with much concern after helping him out into the Entrance Hall with the students all around them staring.
\par \lquote I\rquote m \endash  I\rquote m fine, sir,\rquote  Harry stammered, wiping the sweat from his face. \lquote Really ... I just fell asleep ... had a nightmare ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Pressure of examinations!\rquote  said the old wizard sympathetically, patting Harry shakily on the shoulder. \lquote It happens, young man, it happens! Now, a cooling dri
nk of water, and perhaps you will be ready to return to the Great Hall? The examination is nearly over, but you may be able to round off your last answer nicely?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry wildly. \lquote I mean ... no ... I\rquote ve done \endash  done as much as I can, I think ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Very well, very well,\rquote  said the old wizard gently. \lquote I shall go and collect your examination paper and I suggest that you go and have a nice lie down.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll do that,\rquote  said Harry, nodding vigorously. \lquote Thanks very much.\rquote 
\par The second that the old man\rquote s heels disappeared over the threshold into the Great Hall, Harry ran up the marble staircase, hurtled along the corridors so fast the portraits he passed mut\-
tered reproaches, up more flights of stairs, and finally burst like a hurricane through the double doors of the hospital wing, causing Madam Pomfrey \endash  who had been spooning some bright blue liquid into Montague\rquote s open mouth \endash 
 to shriek in alarm.
\par \lquote Potter, what do you think you\rquote re doing?\rquote 
\par \lquote I need to see Professor McGonagall,\rquote  gasped Harry, the breath tearing his lungs. \lquote Now ... it\rquote s urgent!\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s not here, Potter,\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey sadly. \lquote She was transferred to St Mungo\rquote s this morning. Four Stunning Spells straight to the chest at her age? It\rquote s a wonder they didn\rquote t kill her.\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s ... gone?\rquote  said Harry, shocked.
\par The bell rang just outside the dormitory and he heard the usual distant rumbling of students starting to flood out into the corri\-dors above and below him. He remained quite still, looking at Madam Pomfrey. Terror was rising inside him.
\par There was nobody left to tell. Dumbledore had gone, Hagrid had gone, but he had always expected Professor McGonagall to be there, irascible and inflexible, perhaps, but always dependably, solidly present ...
\par \lquote I don\rquote t wonder you\rquote re shocked, Potter,\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey, with a kind of fierce approval in her face. \lquote As if one of them could have Stunned Minerva McGonagall face-on by daylight! Cowardice, that\rquote 
s what it was ... despicable cowardice ... if I wasn\rquote t worried what would happen to you students without me, I\rquote d resign in protest.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry blankly.
\par He strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor where he stood, buffeted by the crowd, panic expanding inside him like poison gas so that his head swam and he could not think what to do ...

\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  said Hermione at once, looking very frightened. \lquote What happened? Are you all right? Are you ill?\rquote 
\par \lquote Where have you been?\rquote  demanded Ron.

\par \lquote I never said I had a problem!\rquote  said Ron heatedly.
\par \lquote But Harry, you\rquote ve just said it,\rquote  said Hermione fiercely, \lquote Dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind, if you\rquote d done Occlumency properly you\rquote d never have seen this \endash \rquote

\par \lquote WELL, I EXPECT HE\rquote D SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF HE KNEW WHAT I\rquote D JUST \endash \rquote 
\par The classroom door opened. Harry, Ron and Hermione whipped around. Ginny walked in, looking curious, followed by Luna, who as usual looked as though she had drifted in accidentally.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  said Ginny uncertainly. \lquote We recognised Harry\rquote s voice. What are you yelling about?\rquote 
\par \lquote Never you mind,\rquote  said Harry roughly.
\par Ginny raised her eyebrows.
\par \lquote There\rquote s no need to take that tone with me,\rquote  she said coolly, \lquote I was only wondering whether I could help.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, you can\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry shortly.
\par \lquote You\rquote re being rather rude, you know,\rquote  said Luna serenely.
\par Harry swore and turned away. The very last thing he wanted now was a conversation with Luna Lovegood.
\par \lquote Wait,\rquote  said Hermione suddenly. \lquote Wait ... Harry, they }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 can }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par Harry and Ron looked at her.
\par \lquote Listen,\rquote  she said urgently, \lquote Harry, we need to establish whether Sirius really has left Headquarters.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve told you, I saw \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, I\rquote m begging you, please!\rquote  said Hermione desperately. \lquote Please let\rquote s just check that Sirius isn\rquote t at home before we go charging off to London. If we find out he\rquote s not there, then I swear I won\rquote 
t try to stop you. I\rquote ll come, I\rquote ll d \endash  do whatever it takes to try and save him.\rquote 
\par \lquote Sirius is being tortured NOW!\rquote  shouted Harry. \lquote We haven\rquote t got time to waste.\rquote 
\par \lquote But if this is a trick of Voldemort\rquote s, Harry, we\rquote ve got to check, we\rquote ve got to.\rquote 
\par \lquote How?\rquote  Harry demanded. \lquote How\rquote re we going to check?\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote ll have to use Umbridge\rquote s fire and see if we can contact him,\rquote  said Hermione, who looked positively terrified at the thought. \lquote We\rquote ll draw Umbridge away again, but we\rquote ll need lookouts, and that\rquote 
s where we can use Ginny and Luna.\rquote 
\par Though clearly struggling to understand what was going on, Ginny said immediately, \lquote Yeah, we\rquote ll do it,\rquote  and Luna said, \lquote When you say \'93Sirius\'94, are you talking about Stubby Boardman?\rquote 
\par Nobody answered her.
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  Harry said aggressively to Hermione, \lquote OK, if you can think of a way of doing this quickly, I\rquote m with you, otherwise I\rquote m going to the Department of Mysteries right now.\rquote 
\par \lquote The Department of Mysteries?\rquote  said Luna, looking mildly sur\-prised. \lquote But how are you going to get there?\rquote 
\par Again, Harry ignored her.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Hermione, twisting her hands together and pacing up and down between the desks. \lquote Right ... well ... one of us has to go and find Umbridge and \endash 
 and send her off in the wrong direction, keep her away from her office. They could tell her \endash  I don\rquote t know \endash  that Peeves is up to something awful as usual \'85\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll do it,\rquote  said Ron at once. \lquote I\rquote ll tell her Peeves is smashing up the Transfiguration department or something, it\rquote 
s miles away from her office. Come to think of it, I could probably persuade Peeves to do it if I met him on the way.\rquote 
\par It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the Transfiguration depart\-ment.
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  she said, her brow furrowed as she continued to pace. \lquote Now, we need to keep students right away from her office while we force entry, or some Slytherin\rquote s bound to go and tip her off.\rquote 
\par \lquote Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,\rquote  said Ginny promptly, \lquote and warn people not to go down there because someone\rquote s let off a load of Garrotting Gas.\rquote  Hermione looked surprised at the readiness with whi
ch Ginny had come up with this lie; Ginny shrugged and said, \lquote Fred and George were planning to do it before they left.\rquote 
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Well then, Harry, you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak and we\rquote ll sneak into the office and you can talk to Sirius \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s not there, Hermione!\rquote 
\par \lquote I mean, you can \endash  can check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch, I don\rquote t think you should be in there alone, Lee\rquote s already proved the window\rquote s a weak spot, sending those Nifflers through it.\rquote 

\par Even through his anger and impatience, Harry recognised Hermione\rquote s offer to accompany him into Umbridge\rquote s office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty.
\par \lquote I ... OK, thanks,\rquote  he muttered.
\par \lquote Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don\rquote t think we\rquote re going to be able to bank on more than five minutes,\rquote  said Hermione, looking relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan, \lquote 
not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.\rquote 
\par \lquote Five minutes\rquote ll be enough,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote C\rquote mon, let\rquote s go \endash \rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Now?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148  said Hermione, looking shocked.
\par \lquote Of course now!\rquote  said Harry angrily. \lquote What did you think, we\rquote re going to wait until after dinner or something? Hermione, Sirius is being tortured right }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote I \endash  oh, all right,\rquote  she said desperately. \lquote You go and get the Invisibility Cloak and we\rquote ll meet you at the end of Umbridge\rquote s cor\-ridor, OK?\rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t answer, but flung himself out of the room and began to fight his way through the milling crowds outside. Two floors up he met Seamus and Dean, who hailed him jovially and told him they were planning a dusk-till-dawn end-of-exams cele\-
bration in the common room. Harry barely heard them. He scram\-bled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many black-market Butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it, the Invisibility Cloak and Sirius\rquote 
s knife secure in his bag, before they noticed he had left them.
\par \lquote Harry, d\rquote you want to chip in a couple of Galleons? Harold Dingle reckons he could sell us some Firewhisky \endash \rquote 
\par But Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor, and a couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Luna, who were huddled together at the end of Umbridge\rquote s corridor.
\par \lquote Got it,\rquote  he panted. \lquote Ready to go, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote All right,\rquote  whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth-years passed them. \lquote So Ron \endash 
 you go and head Umbridge off ... Ginny, Luna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor ... Harry and I will get the Cloak on and wait until the coast is clear ...\rquote 
\par Ron strode away, his bright-red hair visible right to the end of the passage; meanwhile Ginny\rquote s equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling students surrounding them in the other direction, trailed by Luna\rquote s blonde one.
\par \lquote Get over here,\rquote  muttered Hermione, tugging at Harry\rquote s wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column. \lquote Are \endash  are you sure you\rquote 
re OK, Harry? You\rquote re still very pale.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m fine,\rquote  he said shortly, tuggin
g the Invisibility Cloak from out of his bag. In truth, his scar was aching, but not so badly that he thought Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius a fatal blow; it had hurt much worse than this when Voldemort had been punishing Avery ...
\par \lquote Here,\rquote  he said; he threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them and they stood listening carefully over the Latin mumblings of the bust in front of them.
\par \lquote You can\rquote t come down here!\rquote  Ginny was calling to the crowd. \lquote No, sorry, you\rquote re going to have to go round by the swivelling stair\-case, someone\rquote s let off Garrotting Gas just along here \endash \rquote 
\par They could hear people complaining; one surly voice said, \lquote I can\rquote t see no gas.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s because it\rquote s colourless,\rquote  said Ginny in a convincingly exas\-perated voice, \lquote but if you want to walk through it, carry on, then we\rquote ll have your body as proof for the next idiot who doesn\rquote 
t believe us.\rquote 
\par Slowly, the crowd thinned. The news about the Garrotting Gas seemed to have spread; people were not coming this way any more. When at last the surrounding area was quite clear, Hermione said quietly, \lquote I think that\rquote s as good as we\rquote 
re going to get, Harry \endash  come on, let\rquote s do it.\rquote 
\par They moved forwards, covered by the Cloak. Luna was standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor. As they passed Ginny, Hermione whispered, \lquote Good one ... don\rquote t forget the signal.\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s the signal?\rquote  muttered Harry, as they approached Umbridge\rquote s door.
\par \lquote A loud chorus of \'93Weasley is our King\'94 if they see Umbridge coming,\rquote  replied Hermione, as Harry inserted the blade of Sirius\rquote s knife in the crack between door and wall. The lock clicked open and they entered the office.
\par The garish kittens were basking in the late-afternoon sunshine that was warming their plates, but otherwise the office was as still and unoccupied as last time. Hermione breathed a sigh of relief.
\par \lquote I thought she might have added extra security after the second Niffler.\rquote 
\par They pulled off the Cloak; Hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight, peering d
own into the grounds with her wand out. Harry dashed over to the fireplace, seized the pot of Floo powder and threw a pinch into the grate, causing emerald flames to burst into life there. He knelt down quickly, thrust his head into the dancing fire and c
ried, \lquote Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!\rquote 
\par His head began to spin as though he had just got off a fair\-ground ride though his knees remained firmly planted on the cold office floor. He kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash and when the spinning sto
pped he opened them to find himself looking out at the long, cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place.
\par There was nobody there. He had expected this, yet was not pre\-pared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst through his stomach at the sight of the deserted room.
\par \lquote Sirius?\rquote  he shouted. \lquote Sirius, are you there?\rquote 
\par His voice echoed around the room, but there was no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s there?\rquote  he called, wondering whether it was just a mouse.
\par Kreacher the house-elf crept into view. He looked highly delighted about something, though he seemed to have recently sustained a nasty injury to both hands, which were heavily bandaged.
\par \lquote It\rquote s the Potter boy\rquote s head in the fire,\rquote  Kreacher informed the empty kitchen, stealing furtive, oddly triumphant glances at Harry. \lquote What has he come for, Kreacher wonders?\rquote 
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Sirius, Kreacher?\rquote  Harry demanded.
\par The house-elf gave a wheezy chuckle.
\par \lquote Master has gone out, Harry Potter.\rquote 
\par \lquote Where\rquote s he gone? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Where\rquote s he gone, Kreacher?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \rquote 
\par Kreacher merely cackled.
\par \lquote I\rquote m warning you!\rquote  said Harry, fully aware that his scope for inflicting punishment upon Kreacher was almost non-existent in this position. \lquote What about Lupin? Mad-Eye? Any of them, are any of them there?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nobody here but Kreacher!\rquote  said the elf gleefully, and turning away from Harry he began to walk slowly towards the door at the end of the kitchen. \lquote Kreacher thinks he will have a little chat with his mistress now, yes, he hasn
\rquote t had a chance in a long time, Kreacher\rquote s master has been keeping him away from her \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Where has Sirius gone?\rquote  Harry yelled after the elf. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Kreacher, has he gone to the Department of Mysteries?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \rquote 
\par Kreacher stopped in his tracks. Harry could just make out the back of his bald head through the forest of chair legs before him.
\par \lquote Master does not tell poor Kreacher where he is going,\rquote  said the elf quietly.
\par \lquote But you know!\rquote  shouted Harry. \lquote Don\rquote t you? You know where he is!\rquote 
\par There was a moment\rquote s silence, then the elf let out his loudest cackle yet.
\par \lquote Master will not come back from the Department of Mysteries!\rquote  he said gleefully. \lquote Kreacher and his mistress are alone again!\rquote 
\par And he scurried forwards and disappeared through the door to the hall.
\par \lquote You \endash !\rquote 
\par But before he could utter a single curse or insult,
 Harry felt a great pain at the top of his head; he inhaled a lot of ash and, choking, found himself being dragged backwards through the flames, until with a horrible abruptness he was staring up into the wide, pallid face of Professor Umbridge who had dr
agged him backwards out of the fire by the hair and was now bending his neck back as far as it would go, as though she were going to slit his throat.
\par \lquote You think,\rquote  she whispered, bending Harry\rquote s neck back even fur\-ther, so that he was looking up at the ceiling, \lquote 
that after two Nifflers I was going to let one more foul, scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge? I had Stealth Sensoring Spells placed all around my doorway after the last one got in, you foolish boy. Take his wand,\rquote 
 she barked at someone he could not see, and he felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the wand. \lquote Hers, too.\rquote 
\par Harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that Hermione had also just had her wand wrested from her.
\par \lquote I want to know why you are in my office,\rquote  said Umbridge, shaking the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered.
\par \lquote I was \endash  trying to get my Firebolt!\rquote  Harry croaked.
\par \lquote Liar.\rquote  She shook his head again. \lquote Your Firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons, as you very well know, Potter. You had your head in my fire. With whom have you been communicating?\rquote 
\par \lquote No one \endash \rquote  said Harry, trying to pull away from her. He felt several hairs part company with his scalp.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Liar!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
shouted Umbridge. She threw him from her and he slammed into the desk. Now he could see Hermione pinioned against the wall by Millicent Bulstrode. Malfoy was leaning on the windowsill, smirking as he threw Harry\rquote 
s wand into the air one-handed and caught it again.
\par There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins entered, each gripping Ron, Ginny, Luna and \endash  to Harry\rquote s bewil\-derment \endash 
 Neville, who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation. All four of them had been gagged.
\par \lquote Got \rquote em all,\rquote  said Warrington, shoving Ron roughly forwards into the room. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote That }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \rquote  he pointed at Ginny, who was trying to kick the shins of the large Slytherin girl holding her, \lquote so I brought him along too.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good, good,\rquote  said Umbridge, watching Ginny\rquote s struggles. \lquote Well, it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley-free zone, doesn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par Malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically. Umbridge gave her wide, complacent smile and settled herself into a chintz-covered armchair, blinking up at her captives like a toad in a flowerbed.
\par \lquote So, Potter,\rquote  she said. \lquote You stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon,\rquote  she nodded at Ron \endash  Malfoy laughed even louder \endash  \lquote to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Trans
figuration department when I knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes \endash  Mr Filch having just informed me so.
\par \lquote Clearly, it was very important for you to talk to somebody. Was it Albus Dumbledore? Or the half-breed, Hagrid? I doubt it was Minerva McGonagall, I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone.\rquote 
\par Malfoy and a few of the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad laughed some more at that. Harry found he was so full of rage and hatred he was shaking.
\par \lquote It\rquote s none of your business who I talk to,\rquote  he snarled.
\par Umbridge\rquote s slack face seemed to tighten.
\par \lquote Very well,\rquote  she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice. \lquote Very well, Mr Potter ... I offered you the chance to tell me freely. You refused. I have no alternative but to force you. Draco \endash  fetch Professor Snape.
\rquote 
\par Malfoy stowed Harry\rquote s wand inside his robes and left the room smirking, but Harry hardly noticed. He had just realised some\-thing; he could not believe he had been so stupid as to forget it
. He had thought that all the members of the Order, all those who could help him save Sirius, were gone \endash  but he had been wrong. There was still a member of the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts \endash  Snape.
\par There was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scuf\-flings resulting from the Slytherins\rquote  efforts to keep Ron and the others under control. Ron\rquote s lip was bleeding on to Umbridge\rquote 
s carpet as he struggled against Warrington\rquote s half-nelson; Ginny was still trying to stamp on the feet of the sixth-year girl who had both her upper arms in a tight grip; Neville was turning steadily more purple in the face while tugging at Crabbe
\rquote s arms; and Hermione was attempting, in vain, to throw Millicent Bulstrode off her. Luna, however, stood limply by the side of her captor, gazing vaguely out of the window as though rather bored by the proceedings.
\par Harry looked back at Umbridge, who was watching him closely. He kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and Draco Malfoy came back into the room, holding open the door for Snape.
\par \lquote You wanted to see me, Headmistress?\rquote  said Snape, looking around at all the pairs of struggling students with an expression of com\-plete indifference.
\par \lquote Ah, Professor Snape,\rquote  said Umbridge, smiling widely and standing up again. \lquote Yes, I would like another bottle of Veritaserum, as quick as you can, please.\rquote 
\par \lquote You took my last bottle to interrogate Potter,\rquote  he said, observing her coolly through his greasy curtains of black hair. \lquote Surely you did not use it all? I told you that three drops would be sufficient.\rquote 
\par Umbridge flushed.
\par \lquote You can make some more, can\rquote t you?\rquote  she said, her voice becoming more sweetly girlish as it always did when she was furious.
\par \lquote Certainly,\rquote  said Snape, his lip curling. \lquote It takes a full moon-cycle to mature, so I should have it ready for you in around a month.\rquote 
\par \lquote A month?\rquote  squawked Umbridge, swelling toadishly. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote A month? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
But I need it this evening, Snape! I have just found Potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown!\rquote 
\par \lquote Really?\rquote  said Snape, showing his first, faint sign of interest as he looked round at Harry. \lquote Well, it doesn\rquote t surprise me. Potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules.\rquote 
\par His cold, dark eyes were boring into Harry\rquote s, who met his gaze unflinchingly, concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream, willing Snape to read it in his mind, to understand ...
\par \lquote I wish to interrogate him!\rquote  shouted Umbridge angrily, and Snape looked away from Harry back into her furiously quivering face. \lquote I wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me the truth!\rquote 
\par \lquote I have already told you,\rquote  said Snape smoothly, \lquote that I have no further stocks of Veritaserum. Unless you wish to poison Potter \endash  and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did \endash 
 I cannot help you. The only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim much time for truth-telling.\rquote 
\par Snape looked back at Harry, who stared at him, frantic to com\-municate without words.

\par \lquote You are on probation!\rquote  shrieked Professor Umbridge, and Snape looked back at her, his eyebrows slightly raised. \lquote You are being deliberately unhelpful! I expecte
d better, Lucius Malfoy always speaks most highly of you! Now get out of my office!\rquote 
\par Snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave. Harry knew his last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking out of the door.
\par \lquote He\rquote s got Padfoot!\rquote  he shouted. \lquote He\rquote s got Padfoot at the place where it\rquote s hidden!\rquote 
\par Snape had stopped with his hand on Umbridge\rquote s door handle.
\par \lquote Padfoot?\rquote  cried Professor Umbridge, looking eagerly from Harry to Snape. \lquote What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What does he mean, Snape?\rquote 
\par Snape looked round at Harry. His face was inscrutable. Harry could not tell whether he had understood or not, but he did not dare speak more plainly in front of Umbridge.
\par \lquote I have no idea,\rquote  said Snape coldly. \lquote Potter, when I want non\-sense shouted at 
me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage. And Crabbe, loosen your hold a little. If Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job.\rquote 
\par He closed the door behind him with a snap, leaving Harry in a state of worse turmoil than before: Snape had been his very last hope. He looked at Umbridge, who seemed to be feeling the same way; her chest was heaving with rage and frustration.
\par \lquote Very well,\rquote  she said, and she pulled out her wand. \lquote Very well ... I am left with no alternative ... this is more than a matter of school discipline ... this is an issue of Ministry security ... yes ... yes ...\rquote 
\par She seemed to be talking herself into something. She was shifting her weight
 nervously from foot to foot, staring at Harry, beating her wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily. As he watched her, Harry felt horribly powerless without his own wand.
\par \lquote You are forcing me, Potter ... I do not want to,\rquote  said Umbridge, still moving restlessly on the spot, \lquote but sometimes circumstances justify the use ... I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice ...\rquote 
\par Malfoy was watching her with a hungry expression on his face.
\par \lquote The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,\rquote  said Umbridge quietly.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  shrieked Hermione. \lquote Professor Umbridge \endash  it\rquote s illegal.\rquote 
\par But Umbridge took no notice. There was a nasty, eager, excited look on her face that Harry had never seen before. She raised her wand.
\par \lquote The Minister wouldn\rquote t want you to break the law, Professor Umbridge!\rquote  cried Hermione.
\par \lquote What Cornelius doesn\rquote t know won\rquote t hurt him,\rquote  said Umbridge, who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of Harry\rquote s body in turn, apparently trying to decide where it would hurt most. \lquote 
He never knew I ordered Dementors to go after Potter last summer, but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him, all the same.\rquote

\par \lquote We\rquote ll have to, Harry, she\rquote ll force it out of you anyway, what\rquote s ... what\rquote s the point?\rquote 
\par And Hermione began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bulstrode\rquote s robes. Millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted.

\par \lquote Er \endash  my \endash  nee \endash  no!\rquote  shouted Ron through his gag.
\par Ginny was staring at Hermione as though she had never seen her before. Neville, still choking for breath, was gazing at her, too. But Harry had just noticed something. Though Hermione was sob\-bing desperately into her hands, there was no trace of a tear.

to speak to Professor Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par Ron froze, his eyes wide; Ginny stopped trying to stamp on her Slytherin captor\rquote s toes; and even Luna looked mildly surprised. Fortunately, the attent
ion of Umbridge and her minions was focused too exclusively upon Hermione to notice these suspicious signs.
\par \lquote Dumbledore?\rquote  said Umbridge eagerly. \lquote You know where Dumbledore is, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well ... no!\rquote  sobbed Hermione. We\rquote ve tried the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley and the Three Broomsticks and even the Hog\rquote s Head \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Idiot girl \endash  Dumbledore won\rquote t be sitting in a pub when the whole Ministry\rquote s looking for him!\rquote  shouted Umbridge, disappoint\-ment etched in every sagging line of her face.
\par \lquote But \endash  but we needed to tell him something important!\rquote  wailed Hermione, holding her hands more tightly over her face, not, Harry knew, out of anguish, but to disguise the continued absence of tears.
\par \lquote Yes?\rquote  said Umbridge with a sudden resurgence of excitement. \lquote What was it you wanted to tell him?\rquote 
\par \lquote We ... we wanted to tell him it\rquote s r \endash  ready!\rquote  choked Hermione.
\par \lquote What\rquote s ready?\rquote  demanded Umbridge, and now she grabbed Hermione\rquote s shoulders again and shook her slightly. \lquote What\rquote s ready, girl?\rquote 
\par \lquote The ... the weapon,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Weapon? Weapon?\rquote  said Umbridge, and her eyes seemed to pop with excitement. \lquote You have been developing some method of resistance? A weapon you could use against the Ministry? On Professor Dumbledore\rquote s orders, of course?\rquote 

\par \lquote Y \endash  y \endash  yes,\rquote  gasped Hermione, \lquote but he had to leave before it was finished and n \endash  n \endash  now we\rquote ve finished it for him, and we c \endash  c \endash  can\rquote t find him t \endash  t \endash

\par \lquote We don\rquote t r \endash  r \endash  really understand it,\rquote  said Hermione, sniffing loudly. \lquote We j \endash  j \endash  just did what P \endash  P \endash  Professor Dumbledore told us t \endash  t \endash  to do.\rquote 
\par Umbridge straightened up, looking exultant.
\par \lquote Lead me to the weapon,\rquote  she said.

 looking around at the Slytherins through her fingers.
\par \lquote It is not for you to set conditions,\rquote  said Professor Umbridge harshly.
\par \lquote Fine,\rquote  said Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again. \lquote Fine ... let them see it, I hope they use it on you! In fact, I wish you\rquote d invite loads and loads of people to come and see! Th \endash  that would serve you right 
\endash  oh, I\rquote d love it if the wh \endash  whole school knew where it was, and how to u \endash  use it, and then if you annoy any of them they\rquote ll be able to s \endash  sort you out!\rquote 
\par These words had a powerful impact on Umbridge: she glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at her Inquisitorial Squad, her bulging eyes resting for a moment on Malfoy, who was too slow to disguise t
he look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face.
\par Umbridge contemplated Hermione for another long moment, then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice.
\par \lquote All right, dear, let\rquote s make it just you and me ... and we\rquote ll take Potter, too, shall we? Get up, now.\rquote 
\par \lquote Professor,\rquote  said Malfoy eagerly, \lquote Professor Umbridge, I think some of the Squad should come with you to look after \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone?\rquote  asked Umbridge sharply. \lquote 
In any case, it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see. You will remain here until I return and make sure none of these \endash \rquote  she ges\-tured around at Ron, Ginny, Neville and Luna \lquote \endash  es
cape.\rquote 
\par \lquote All right,\rquote  said Malfoy, looking sulky and disappointed.
\par \lquote And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way,\rquote  said Umbridge, pointing at Harry and Hermione with her wand. \lquote Lead on.\rquote

Hermione led the way down the stairs into the Entrance Hall. The din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out of the double doors to the Great Hall \endash  it seemed incred\-
ible to Harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, celebrating the end of exams, not a care in the world ...
\par Hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air. The sun was falling towards the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now, and as Hermione marched purposefully across the grass \endash 
 Umbridge jog\-ging to keep up \endash  their long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks.
\par \lquote It\rquote s hidden in Hagrid\rquote s hut, is it?\rquote  said Umbridge eagerly in Harry\rquote s ear.
\par \lquote Of course not,\rquote  said Hermione scathingly. \lquote Hagrid might have set it off accidentally.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Umbridge, whose excitement seemed to be mounting. \lquote Yes, he would have done, of course, the great half-breed oaf.\rquote 
\par She laughed. Harry felt a strong urge to swing round and seize her by the throat, but resisted. His scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned white-hot, as he knew it would if Voldemort had moved in for the kill.
\par \lquote Then ... where is it?\rquote  asked Umbridge, with a hint of uncertainty in her voice as Hermione continued to stride towards the Forest.
\par \lquote In there, of course,\rquote  said Hermione, pointing into the dark trees. \lquote It had to be somewhere that students weren\rquote t going to find it acci\-dentally, didn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course,\rquote  said Umbridge, though she sounded a little appre\-hensive now. \lquote Of course ... very well, then ... you two stay ahead of me.\rquote 
\par \lquote Can we have your wand, then, if we\rquote re going first?\rquote  Harry asked her.
\par \lquote No, I don\rquote t think so, Mr Potter,\rquote  said Umbridge sweetly, poking him in the back with it. \lquote The Ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours, I\rquote m afraid.\rquote 
\par As they reached the cool shade of the first trees, Harry tried to catch Hermione\rquote 
s eye; walking into the Forest without wands seemed to him to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening. She, however, merely gave Umbridge a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the trees, moving at such a pace
 that Umbridge, with her shorter legs, had difficulty in keeping up.
\par \lquote Is it very far in?\rquote  Umbridge asked, as her robe ripped on a bramble.
\par \lquote Oh yes,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote yes, it\rquote s well hidden.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s misgivings increased. Hermione was not taking the path they
 had followed to visit Grawp, but the one he followed three years ago to the lair of the monster Aragog. Hermione had not been with him on that occasion; he doubted she had any idea what danger lay at the end of it.
\par \lquote Er \endash  are you sure this is the right way?\rquote  he asked her pointedly.
\par \lquote Oh yes,\rquote  she said in a steely voice, crashing through the under\-growth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of noise. Behind them, Umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling. Neither of them paused to help her up aga
in; Hermione merely strode on, calling loudly over her shoulder, \lquote It\rquote s a bit further in!\rquote 
\par \lquote Hermione, keep your voice down,\rquote  Harry muttered, hurrying to catch up with her. \lquote Anything could be listening in here \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I want us heard,\rquote  she answered quietly, as Umbridge jogged noisily after them. \lquote You\rquote ll see ...\rquote 
\par They walked on for what seemed a long time, until they were once again so deep into the Forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light. Harry had the feeling he had had before in the Forest, one of being watched by unseen eyes.
\par \lquote How much further?\rquote  demanded Umbridge angrily from behind him.
\par \lquote Not far now!\rquote  shouted Hermione, as they emerged into a dim, dank clearing. \lquote Just a little bit \endash \rquote 
\par An arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud 
in the tree just over her head. The air was suddenly full of the sound of hooves; Harry could feel the Forest floor trembling; Umbridge gave a little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield \endash 
\par He wrenched himself free of her and turned. Around fifty cen\-taurs were emerging on every side, their bows raised and loaded, pointing at Harry, Hermione and Umbridge. They backed slowly into the centre of the clearing, Umbridge uttering odd little whim
\-pers of terror. Harry looked sideways at Hermione. She was wearing a triumphant smile.
\par \lquote Who are you?\rquote  said a voice.
\par Harry looked left. The chestnut-bodied centaur called Magorian was walking towards them out of the circle: his bow, like those of the others, was raised. On Harry\rquote s right, Umbridge was still whim\-
pering, her wand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur.
\par \lquote I asked you who are you, human,\rquote  said Magorian roughly.
\par \lquote I am Dolores Umbridge!\rquote  said Umbridge in a high-pitched, terri\-fied voice. \lquote Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic and Headmistress and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts!\rquote 
\par \lquote You are from the Ministry of Magic?\rquote  said Magorian, as many of the centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right!\rquote  said Umbridge, in an even higher voice, \lquote so be very careful! By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, any attack by half-breeds such as yourselves on a human 
\endash \rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote What }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 did you call us?\rquote 
 shouted a wild-looking black centaur, whom Harry recognised as Bane. There was a great deal of angry muttering and tightening of bowstrings around them.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t call them that!\rquote  Hermione said furiously, but Umbridge did not appear to have heard her. Still pointing her shaking wand at Magorian, she continued, \lquote Law Fifteen \'93B\'94 states clearly that \'93
any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelligence, and therefore considered responsible for its actions \endash \'94\rquote 
\par \lquote \'93Near-human intelligence\'94?\rquote  repeated Magorian, as Bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground. \lquote We con\-sider that a great insult, human! Our intelligence, thankfully, far outstrips your own.\rquote 
\par \lquote What are you doing in our Forest?\rquote  bellowed the hard-faced grey centaur Harry and Hermione had seen on their last trip into the Forest. \lquote Why are you here?\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Your }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Forest?\rquote 
 said Umbridge, shaking now not only with fright but also, it seemed, with indignation. \lquote I would remind you that you live here only because the Ministry of Magic permits you cer\-tain areas of land \endash \rquote 
\par An arrow flew so close to her head
 that it caught at her mousy hair in passing: she let out an ear-splitting scream and threw her hands over her head, while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and others laughed raucously. The sound of their wild, neighing laughter echoing around
 the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving.
\par \lquote Whose Forest is it now, human?\rquote  bellowed Bane.
\par \lquote Filthy half-breeds!\rquote  she screamed, her hands still tight over her head. \lquote Beasts! Uncontrolled animals!\rquote 
\par \lquote Be quiet!\rquote  shouted Hermione, but it was too late: Umbridge pointed her wand at Magorian and screamed, \lquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Incarcerous!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes, wrapping themselves tightly around the centaur\rquote s torso and trapping his arms: he gave a cry of rage and reared on to his hind legs, attempting to free himself, while the other centaurs charged.
\par Harry grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the ground; face down on the Forest floor, he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered around him, but the centaurs leapt over and around them, bellowing and screaming with rage.
\par \lquote Nooooo!\rquote  he heard Umbridge shriek. \lquote Noooooo ... I am Senior Undersecretary ... you cannot \endash  Unhand me, you animals ... nooooo!\rquote 
\par Harry saw a flash of red light and knew she had attempted to Stun one o
f them; then she screamed very loudly. Lifting his head a few inches, Harry saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by Bane and lifted high into the air, wriggling and yelling with fright. Her wand fell from her hand to the ground, and Harry\rquote 
s heart leapt. If he could just reach it \endash 
\par But as he stretched out a hand towards it, a centaur\rquote s hoof descended upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half.
\par \lquote Now!\rquote  roared a voice in Harry\rquote s ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged him upright.
 Hermione, too, had been pulled to her feet. Over the plunging, many-coloured backs and heads of the centaurs, Harry saw Umbridge being borne away through the trees by Bane. Screaming non-stop, her voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer
 hear it over the trampling of hooves surrounding them.
\par \lquote And these?\rquote  said the hard-faced, grey centaur holding Hermione.
\par \lquote They are young,\rquote  said a slow, doleful voice from behind Harry. \lquote We do not attack foals.\rquote 
\par \lquote They brought her here, Ronan,\rquote  replied the centaur who had such a firm grip on Harry. \lquote And they are not so young ... he is nearing manhood, this one.\rquote 
\par He shook Harry by the neck of his robes.
\par \lquote Please,\rquote  said Hermione breathlessly, \lquote please, don\rquote t attack us, we don\rquote t think like her, we aren\rquote t Ministry of Magic employees! We only came in here because we hoped you\rquote d drive her off for us.\rquote 

\par Harry knew at once, from the look on the face of the grey cen\-taur holding Hermione, that she had made a terrible mistake in saying this. The grey centaur threw back his head, his back legs stamping furiously, and bellowed, \lquote 
You see, Ronan? They already have the arrogance of their kind! So we were to do your dirty work, were we, human girl? We were to act as your servants, drive away your enemies like obedient hounds?\rquote 
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Hermione in a horror-struck squeak. \lquote Please \endash  I didn\rquote t mean that! I just hoped you\rquote d be able to \endash  to help us \endash \rquote 
\par But she seemed to be going from bad to worse.
\par \lquote We do not help humans!\rquote  snarled the centaur holding Harry, tightening his grip and rearing a little at the same time, so that Harry\rquote s feet left the ground momentarily. \lquote 
We are a race apart and proud to be so. We will not permit you to walk from here, boasting that we did your bidding!\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re not going to say anything like that!\rquote  Harry shouted. \lquote We know you didn\rquote t do what you did because we wanted you to \endash \rquote 
\par But nobody seemed to be listening to him.
\par A bearded centaur towards the back of the crowd shouted, \lquote They came here unasked, they must pay the consequences!\rquote 
\par A roar of approval met these words and a dun-coloured cen\-taur shouted, \lquote They can join the woman!\rquote 
\par \lquote You said you didn\rquote t hurt the innocent!\rquote  shouted Hermione, real tears sliding down her face now. \lquote We haven\rquote t done anything to hurt you, we haven\rquote t used wands or threats, we just want to go b
ack to school, please let us go back \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We are not all like the traitor Firenze, human girl!\rquote  shouted the grey centaur, to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows. \lquote Perhaps you thought us pretty talking horses? We are an ancient people who will n
ot stand wizard invasions and insults! We do not recognise your laws, we do not acknowledge your superiority, we are \endash \rquote 
\par But they did not hear what else centaurs were, for at that moment there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all of them, Harry, Hermione and the fifty or so centaurs filling the clearing, looked around. Harry\rquote 
s centaur let him fall to the ground again as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows. Hermione had been dropped, too, and Harry hurried towards her 
as two thick tree trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant appeared in the gap.
\par The centaurs nearest him backed into those behind; the clearing was now a forest of bows and arrows waiting to be fired, all pointing upwards at the enormous greyish face now looming over them from just beneath the thick canopy of branches. Grawp\rquote 
s lopsided mouth was gaping stupidly; they could see his bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the half-light, his dull sludge-coloured eyes narrowed as he squinted down at the creatures at his feet. Broken ropes trailed from both ankles.
\par He opened his mouth even wider.
\par \lquote Hagger.\rquote 
\par Harry did not know what \lquote hagger\rquote  meant, or what language it was from, nor did he much care; he was watching Grawp\rquote s feet, which were almost as long as Harry\rquote 
s whole body. Hermione gripped his arm tightly; the centaurs were quite silent, staring up at the giant, whose huge, round head moved from side to side as he con\-tinued to peer amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Hagger!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 he said again, more insistently.
\par \lquote Get away from here, giant!\rquote  called Magorian. \lquote You are not wel\-come among us!\rquote 
\par These words seemed to make no impression whatsoever on Grawp. He stooped a little (the centaurs\rquote  arms tensed on their bows), then bellowed, \lquote HAGGER!\rquote 
\par A few of the centaurs looked worried now. Hermione, however, gave a gasp.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  she whispered. \lquote I think he\rquote s trying to say \'93Hagrid\'94!\rquote 
\par At this precise moment Grawp caught sight of them, the only two humans in a sea of centaurs. He lowered his head another foot or so, staring intently at them. Harry could feel Hermione shaking as Grawp opened his mouth wide again and said, in a deep, rum
\-bling voice, \lquote Hermy.\rquote 
\par \lquote Goodness,\rquote  said Hermione, gripping Harry\rquote s arm so tightly it was growing numb and looking as though she was about to faint, \lquote he \endash  he remembered!\rquote 
\par \lquote HERMY!\rquote  roared Grawp. \lquote WHERE HAGGER?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know!\rquote  squealed Hermione, terrified. \lquote I\rquote m sorry, Grawp, I don\rquote t know!\rquote 
\par \lquote GRAWP WANT HAGGER!\rquote 
\par One of the giant\rquote s massive
 hands reached down. Hermione let out a real scream, ran a few steps backwards and fell over. Wandless, Harry braced himself to punch, kick, bite or whatever else it took as the hand swooped towards him and knocked a snow-white centaur off his legs.

\par It was what the centaurs had been waiting for \endash  Grawp\rquote s out\-
stretched fingers were a foot from Harry when fifty arrows soared through the air at the giant, peppering his enormous face, causing him to howl with pain and rage and straighten up, rubbing his face wi
th his enormous hands, breaking off the arrow shafts but forcing the arrowheads in still deeper.
\par He yelled and stamped his enormous feet and the centaurs scattered out of the way; pebble-sized droplets of Grawp\rquote s blood showered Harry as he pulled Hermione 
to her feet and the pair of them ran as fast as they could for the shelter of the trees. Once there they looked back; Grawp was snatching blindly at the cen\-taurs as blood ran down his face; they were retreating in dis\-
order, galloping away through the trees on the other side of the clearing. Harry and Hermione watched Grawp give another roar of fury and plunge after them, smashing more trees aside as he went.
\par \lquote Oh no,\rquote  said Hermione, quaking so badly that her knees gave way. \lquote Oh, that was horrible. And he might kill them all.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not that fussed, to be honest,\rquote  said Harry bitterly.
\par The sounds of the galloping centaurs and the blundering giant grew fainter and fainter. As Harry listened to them, his scar gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him.
\par They had wasted so much time \endash  they were even further from rescuing Sirius than they had been when he had had the vision. Not only had Harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the middle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transp
ort whatsoever.
\par \lquote Smart plan,\rquote  he spat at Hermione, having to release some of his fury. \lquote Really smart plan. Where do we go from here?\rquote 
\par \lquote We need to get back up to the castle,\rquote  said Hermione faintly.
\par \lquote By the time we\rquote ve done that, Sirius\rquote ll probably be dead!\rquote  
said Harry, kicking a nearby tree in temper. A high-pitched chattering started up overhead and he looked up to see an angry Bowtruckle flexing its long twiglike fingers at him.
\par \lquote Well, we can\rquote t do anything without wands,\rquote  said Hermione hopelessly, dragging herself up again. \lquote Anyway, Harry, how exactly were you planning to get all the way to London?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, we were just wondering that,\rquote  said a familiar voice from behind her.
\par Harry and Hermione moved together instinctively and peered through the trees.
\par Ron came into sight with Ginny, Neville and Luna hurrying along behind him. All of them looked a little the worse for wear \endash  there were several long scratches running the length of Ginny\rquote 
s cheek; a large purple lump was swelling above Neville\rquote s right eye; Ron\rquote s lip was bleeding worse than ever \endash  but all were looking rather pleased with themselves.
\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Ron, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding out Harry\rquote s wand, \lquote had any ideas?\rquote 
\par \lquote How did you get away?\rquote  asked Harry in amazement, taking his wand from Ron.
\par \lquote Couple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, Neville brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx,\rquote  said Ron airily, now handing back Hermione\rquote s wand, too. \lquote But Ginny was best, she got Malfoy \endash  Bat Bogey Hex \endash 
 it was superb, his whole face was covered in the great flapping things. Anyway we saw you out of the window heading into the Forest and followed. What\rquote ve you done with Umbridge?\rquote 
\par \lquote She got carried away.\rquote  said Harry. \lquote By a herd of centaurs.\rquote 
\par \lquote And they left you behind?\rquote  asked Ginny, looking astonished.
\par \lquote No, they got chased off by Grawp,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s Grawp?\rquote  Luna asked interestedly.
\par \lquote Hagrid\rquote s little brother,\rquote  said Ron promptly. \lquote Anyway, never mind that now. Harry, what did you find out in the fire? Has You-Know-Who got Sirius or \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry, as his scar gave another painful prickle, \lquote and I\rquote m sure Sirius is still alive, but I can\rquote t see how we\rquote re going to get there to help him.\rquote 
\par They all fell silent, looking rather scared; the problem facing them seemed insurmountable.
\par \lquote Well, we\rquote ll have to fly, won\rquote t we?\rquote  said Luna, in the closest thing to a matter-of-fact voice Harry had ever heard her use.
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Harry irritably, rounding on her. \lquote First of all, \'93}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 we}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \'94 aren\rquote t doing anything if you\rquote re including yourself in that, and second of all, Ron\rquote s the only one with a broomstick that isn\rquote t being guarded by a security troll, so 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve got a broom!\rquote  said Ginny.
\par \lquote Yeah, but you\rquote re not coming,\rquote  said Ron angrily.
\par \lquote Excuse me, but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do!\rquote  said Ginny, her jaw set so that her resemblance to Fred and George was suddenly striking.
\par \lquote You\rquote re too \endash \rquote  Harry began, but Ginny said fiercely, \lquote I\rquote m three years older than you were when you fought You-Know-Who over the Philosopher\rquote s Stone, and it\rquote s because of me that Malfoy\rquote 
s stuck back in Umbridge\rquote s office with giant flying bogies attacking him \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We were all in the DA together,\rquote  said Neville quietly. \lquote It was all supposed to be about fighting You-Know-Who, wasn\rquote t it? And this is the first chance we\rquote ve had to do something real \endash 
 or was that all just a game or something?\rquote 
\par \lquote No \endash  of course it wasn\rquote t \endash \rquote  said Harry impatiently.
\par \lquote Then we should come too,\rquote  said Neville simply. \lquote We want to help.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Luna, smiling happily.
\par Harry\rquote s eyes met Ron\rquote s. He knew Ron was thinking exactly what he was: if he could have chosen any members of the DA, in addi\-
tion to himself, Ron and Hermione, to join him in the attempt to rescue Sirius, he would not have picked Ginny, Neville or Luna.
\par \lquote Well, it doesn\rquote t matter, anyway,\rquote  said Harry frustratedly, \lquote because we still don\rquote t know how to get there \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I thought we\rquote d settled that,\rquote  said Luna maddeningly. \lquote We\rquote re flying!\rquote 
\par \lquote Look,\rquote  said Ron, barely containing his anger, \lquote you might be able to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us can\rquote t sprout wings whenever we \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote There are ways of flying other than with broomsticks,\rquote  said Luna serenely.
\par \lquote I s\rquote pose we\rquote re going to ride on the back of the Kacky Snorgle or whatever it is?\rquote  Ron demanded.
\par \lquote The Crumple-Horned Snorkack can\rquote t fly,\rquote  said Luna in a digni\-fied voice, \lquote but }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 they }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 can, and Hagrid says they\rquote re very good at finding places their riders are looking for.\rquote 
\par Harry whirled round. Standing between two trees, their white eyes gleaming eerily, were two Thestrals, watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word.
\par \lquote Yes!\rquote  he whispered, moving towards them. They tossed their reptilian heads, throwing back long black manes, and Harry stretched out his hand eagerly and patted the nearest one\rquote s shining neck; how could he ever have thought them ugly?

\par \lquote Is it those mad horse things?\rquote  said Ron uncertainly, staring at a point slightly to the left of the Thestral Harry was patting. \lquote Those ones you can\rquote t see unless you\rquote ve watched someone snuff it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote How many?\rquote 
\par \lquote Just two.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, we need three,\rquote  said Hermione, who was still looking a little shaken, but determined just the same.
\par \lquote Four, Hermione,\rquote  said Ginny, scowling.
\par \lquote I think there are six of us, actually,\rquote  said Luna calmly, counting.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be stupid, we can\rquote t all go!\rquote  said Harry angrily. \lquote Look, you three \endash \rquote  he pointed at Neville, Ginny and Luna, \lquote you\rquote re not involved in this, you\rquote re not \endash \rquote 
\par They burst into more protests. His scar gave another, more painful, twinge. Every moment they delayed was precious; he did not have time to argue.
\par \lquote OK, fine, it\rquote s your choice,\rquote  he said curtly, \lquote but unless we can find more Thestrals you\rquote re not going to be able \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, more of them will come,\rquote  said Ginny confidently, who like Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the impression that she was looking at the horses.
\par \lquote What makes you think that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because, in case you hadn\rquote t noticed, you and Hermione are both covered in blood,\rquote  she said coolly, \lquote and we know Hagrid lures Thestrals with raw meat. That\rquote s probably why these two turned up in the first place.\rquote 

\par Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest Thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with Grawp\rquote s blood.
\par \lquote OK, then,\rquote  he said, a bright idea occurring, \lquote Ron and I will take these two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three and she\rquote ll attract more Thestrals \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not staying behind!\rquote  said Hermione furiously.
\par \lquote There\rquote s no need,\rquote  said Luna, smiling. \lquote Look, here come more now ... you two must really smell ...\rquote 
\par Harry turned: no fewer than six or seven Thestrals were picking their way through the trees, their great leathery wings folded tight to their bodies, their eyes gleaming through the darkness. He had no excuse now.
\par \lquote All right,\rquote  he said angrily, \lquote pick one and get on, then.\rquote

Harry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest Thestral, placed a foot on a stump nearby and scrambled clumsily on to the horse\rquote 
s silken back. It did not object, but twisted its head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes.

He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure, then looked around at
 the others. Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next Thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature\rquote 
s back. Luna was already in place, sitting side-saddle and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day. Ron, Hermione and Ginny, however, were still standing motionless on the spot, open-mouthed and staring.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote How\rquote re we supposed to get on?\rquote  said Ron faintly. \lquote When we can\rquote t see the things?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, it\rquote s easy,\rquote  said Luna, sliding obligingly from her Thestral and marching over to him, Hermione and Ginny. \lquote Come here ...\rquote 
\par She pulled them over to the other Thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help them on to the back of their mount. All three looked extremely nervous as she wound their hands into their horse\rquote 
s mane and told them to grip tightly before she got back on to her own steed.
\par \lquote This is mad,\rquote  Ron murmured, moving his free hand gingerly up and down his horse\rquote s neck. \lquote Mad ... if I could just see it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote d better hope it stays invisible,\rquote  said Harry darkly. \lquote We all ready, then?\rquote 
\par They all nodded and he saw five pairs of knees tighten beneath their robes.
\par \lquote OK ...\rquote 
\par He looked down at the back of his Thestral\rquote s glossy black head and swallowed.
\par \lquote Ministry of Magic, visitors\rquote  entrance, London, then,\rquote  he said uncertainly. \lquote Er ... if you know ... where to go ...\rquote 
\par For a moment Harry\rquote s Thestral did nothing at all; then, with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him, the wings on either side extended; the horse crouched slowly, then rocketed upwa
rds so fast and so steeply that Harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backwards over its bony rump. He closed his eyes and pressed his face down into the horse\rquote 
s silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out into a blood-red sunset.
\par Harry did not think he had ever moved so fast: the Thestral streaked over the castle, its wide wings hardly beating; the cooling air was slapping Harry\rquote s face; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind,
 he looked round and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him, each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their Thestral to protect themselves from his slipstream.
\par They were over the Hogwarts grounds, they had passed Hogsmeade; Harry could 
see mountains and gullies below them. As the daylight began to fail, Harry saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills ...
\par \lquote This is bizarre!\rquote  Harry barely heard Ron yell from somewhere behind him, and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support.
\par Twilight fell: the sky was turning to a light, dusky purple lit\-tered with tiny silver stars, and soon only the lights of Muggle towns gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were, or how very fast they were travelling. Harry\rquote 
s arms were wrapped tightly around his horse\rquote s neck as he willed it to go even faster. How much time had elapsed since he 
had seen Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries floor? How much longer would Sirius be able to resist Voldemort? All Harry knew for sure was that his godfather had neither done as Voldemort wanted, nor died, for he was convinced that either outcome w
ould have caused him to feel Voldemort\rquote s jubilation or fury course through his own body, making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr Weasley was attacked.
\par On they flew through the gathering darkness; Harry\rquote s face felt stiff and cold, his legs numb from gripping the Thestral\rquote 
s sides so tightly, but he did not dare shift his position lest he slip ... he was deaf from the thundering rush of air in his ears, and his mouth was dry and frozen from the cold night wind. He had lost all sense of how f
ar they had come; all his faith was in the beast beneath him, still streaking purposefully through the night, barely flapping its wings as it sped ever onwards.
\par If they were too late ...
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 He\rquote s still alive, he\rquote s still fighting, I can feel it ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par Harry\rquote s stomach gave a jolt; the Thestral\rquote 
s head was suddenly pointing towards the ground and he actually slid forwards a few inches along its neck. They were descending at last ... he thought he heard a shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously, but could see no sign of a falling body ...
 presumably they had all received a shock from the change of direction, just as he had.
\par And now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides; they could see the tops of buildings, streams of head\-lights like luminous insect eyes, square
s of pale yellow that were windows. Quite suddenly, it seemed, they were hurtling towards the pavement; Harry gripped the Thestral with every last ounce of his strength, braced for a sudden impact, but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a sha
dow and Harry slid from its back, looking around at the street where the overflowing skip still stood a short way from the vandalised telephone box, both drained of colour in the flat orange glare of the streetlights.
\par Ron landed a short way off and toppled immediately from his Thestral on to the pavement.
\par \lquote Never again,\rquote  he said, struggling to his feet. He made as though to stride away from his Thestral, but, unable to see it, collided with its hindquarters and almost fell over again. \lquote Never, ever again ... that was the worst \endash 
\rquote 
\par Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him: both slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than Ron, though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground; Neville jumped down, shaking; and Luna dismounted smoothly.
\par \lquote Where do we go from here, then?\rquote  she asked Harry in a politely interested voice, as though this was all a rather interesting day-trip.
\par \lquote Over here,\rquote  he said. He gave his Thestral a quick, grateful pat, then led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the door. \lquote Come }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 on!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 he urged the others, as they hesitated.
\par Ron and Ginny marched in obediently; Hermione, Neville and Luna squashed themselves in after them; Harry took one glance back at the Thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the skip, then forced himself into the box after Luna.
\par \lquote Whoever\rquote s nearest the receiver, dial six two four four two!\rquote  he said.
\par Ron did it, his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial; as it whirred back into place the cool female voice sounded inside the box.
\par \lquote Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger,\rquote  Harry said very quickly, \lquote Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood ... we\rquote re here to save someone, unless your Ministry can do it first!\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote  said the cool female voice. \lquote Visitors, please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes.\rquote 
\par Half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned coins normally appeared. Hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to Harry over Ginny\rquote s head; he glanced at the top\-most one, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Harry Potter, Rescue Mission.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par \lquote Visitors to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wands for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.\rquote 
\par \lquote Fine!\rquote  Harry said loudly, as his scar gave another throb. \lquote Now can we }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 move?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \rquote 
\par The floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past its glass windows; the scavenging Thestrals were sliding out of si
ght; blackness closed over their heads and with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Ministry of Magic.
\par A chink of soft golden light hit their feet and, widening, rose up their bodies. Harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready 
as he could in such cramped conditions as he peered through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed to be completely empty. The light was dimmer than it had been by day; there were no fires burning under the mant
el\-pieces set into the walls, but as the lift slid smoothly to a halt he saw that golden symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling.
\par \lquote The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening,\rquote  said the woman\rquote s voice.
\par The door of the telephone 
box burst open; Harry toppled out of it, followed by Neville and Luna. The only sound in the Atrium was the steady rush of water from the golden fountain, where jets from the wands of the witch and wizard, the point of the centaur\rquote 
s arrow, the tip of the goblin\rquote s hat and the house-elf\rquote s ears continued to gush into the surrounding pool.
\par \lquote Come on,\rquote  said Harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall, Harry in the lead, past the fountain towards the desk where the watchwizard who had weighed Harry\rquote s wand had sat, and which was now deserted.
\par Harry felt sure there ought to be a security person there, sure their absence was an ominous sign, and his feeling of foreboding increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts. He pressed the nearest \lquote down\rquote 
 button and a lift clattered into sight almost immediately, the golden grilles slid apart with a great, echoing clanking and they dashed inside. Harry stabbed the number nine button; the grilles closed with a bang and the lift began to descend,
 jangling and rattling. Harry had not realised how noisy the lifts were on the day he had come with Mr Weasley; he was sure the din would raise every security person within the building, yet when the lift halted, the cool female voice said, \lquote 
Department of Mysteries,\rquote  and the grilles slid open. They stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving but the nearest torches, flick\-ering in the rush of air from the lift.
\par Harry turned towards the plain black door. After months and months of dreaming about it, he was here at last.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s go,\rquote  he whispered, and he led the way down the corridor, Luna right behind him, gazing around with her mouth slightly open.
\par \lquote OK, listen,\rquote  said Harry, stopping again within six feet of the door. \lquote Maybe ... maybe a couple of people should stay here as a \endash  as a lookout, and \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote And how\rquote re we going to let you know something\rquote s coming?\rquote  asked Ginny, her eyebrows raised. \lquote You could be miles away.\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re coming with you, Harry,\rquote  said Neville.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s get on with it,\rquote  said Ron firmly.
\par Harry still did not want to take them all with him, but it seemed he had no choice. He turned to face the door and walked forwards ... just as it had in his dream, it swung open and he marched forwards, leading the others over the threshold.
\par They were stan
ding in a large, circular room. Everything in here was black including the floor and ceiling; identical, unmarked, handleless black doors were set at intervals all around the black walls, interspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue; the
ir cool, shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor made it look as though there was dark water underfoot.
\par \lquote Someone shut the door,\rquote  Harry muttered.
\par He regretted giving this order the moment Neville had obeyed it. Without the long chink of light 
from the torchlit corridor behind them, the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and their ghostly reflections in the floor.
\par In his dream, Harry had always walked purpo
sefully across this room to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on. But there were around a dozen doors here. Just as he was gazing ahead at the doors opposite him, trying to decide which was the right one, there was a great rumbling noi
se and the candles began to move sideways. The circular wall was rotating.
\par Hermione grabbed Harry\rquote s arm as though frightened the floor might move, too, but it did not. For a few seconds, the blue flames around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the
 wall sped around; then, quite as suddenly as it had started, the rumbling stopped and everything became stationary once again.
\par Harry\rquote s eyes had blue streaks burned into them; it was all he could see.
\par \lquote What was that about?\rquote  whispered Ron fearfully.
\par \lquote I think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in through,\rquote  said Ginny in a hushed voice.
\par Harry realised at once she was right: he could no sooner iden\-tify the exit door than locate an ant on the jet-black floor; }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 the door through which they needed to proceed could be any one of the dozen surrounding them.
\par \lquote How\rquote re we going to get back out?\rquote  said Neville uncomfortably.
\par \lquote Well, that doesn\rquote t matter now,\rquote  said Harry forcefully, blinking to try to erase the blue lines from his vision, and clutching his wand tighter than ever, \lquote we won\rquote t need to get out till we\rquote ve found Sirius \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t go calling for him, though!\rquote  Hermione said urgently; but Harry had never needed her advice less, his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible.
\par \lquote Where do we go, then, Harry?\rquote  Ron asked.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t \endash \rquote  Harry began. He swallowed. \lquote In the dreams I went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark room \endash  that\rquote s this one \endash 
 and then I went through another door into a room that kind of ... glitters. We should try a few doors,\rquote  he said hastily, \lquote I\rquote ll know the right way when I see it. C\rquote mon.\rquote 
\par He marched straight at the door now facing him, the others following close behind him, set his left hand against its cool, shining surface, raised his wand ready to strike the moment it opened, and pushed.
\par It swung open easily.
\par After the darkness of the first room, the lamps hanging low on golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rectangular room was much brighter, though there were no glit\-tering, shimme
ring lights as Harry had seen in his dreams. The place was quite empty except for a few desks and, in the very middle of the room, an enormous glass tank of deep green liquid, big enough for all of them to swim in; a number of pearly-white objects were dr
ifting around lazily in it.
\par \lquote What\rquote re those things?\rquote  whispered Ron.
\par \lquote Dunno,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Are they fish?\rquote  breathed Ginny.
\par \lquote Aquavirius Maggots!\rquote  said Luna excitedly. \lquote Dad said the Ministry were breeding \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Hermione. She sounded odd. She moved forward to look through the side of the tank. \lquote They\rquote re brains.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Brains?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \rquote 
\par \lquote Yes ... I wonder what they\rquote re doing with them?\rquote 
\par Harry joined her at the tank. Sure enough, there could be no mistake now he saw them at close quarters. Glimmering eerily, they drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green liquid, looking something like slimy cauliflowers.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s get out of here,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote This isn\rquote t right, we need to try another door.\rquote 
\par \lquote There are doors here, too,\rquote  said Ron, pointing around the walls. Harry\rquote s heart sank; how big was this place?
\par \lquote In my dream I went through that dark room into the second one,\rquote  he said. \lquote I think we should go back and try from there.\rquote 
\par So they hurried back into the dark, circular room; the ghostly shapes of the brains were now swimming before Harry\rquote s eyes instead of the blue candle flames.
\par \lquote Wait!\rquote  said Hermione sharply, as Luna made to close the door of the brain room behind them. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Flagrate!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par She drew with her wand in midair and a fiery \lquote X\rquote  appeared on the door. No sooner had the d
oor clicked shut behind them than there was a great rumbling, and once again the wall began to revolve very fast, but now there was a great red-gold blur in amongst the faint blue and, when all became still again, the fiery cross still burned, showing the
 door they had already tried.
\par \lquote Good thinking,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote OK, let\rquote s try this one \endash \rquote 
\par Again, he strode directly at the door facing him and pushed it open, his wand still raised, the others at his heels.
\par This room was larger than the last, dimly lit and rect
angular, and the centre of it was sunken, forming a great stone pit some twenty feet deep. They were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep steps like an amphitheatre, or the cou
r
troom in which Harry had been tried by the Wizengamot. Instead of a chained chair, however, there was a raised stone dais in the centre of the pit, on which stood a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thin
g was still standing. Unsupported by any surrounding wall, the archway was hung with a tattered black curtain or veil which, despite the com\-plete stillness of the cold surrounding air, was fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched.

\par \lquote Who\rquote s there?\rquote  said Harry, jumping down on to the bench below. There was no answering voice, but the veil continued to flutter and sway.
\par \lquote Careful!\rquote  whispered Hermione.
\par Harry scrambled down the benches one by one until he reached the stone bottom of the sunken pit. His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked slowly towards the dais. The pointed archway looked much taller from where he now stood than it had when he\rquote 
d been looking down on it from above. Still the veil swayed gently, as though somebody had just passed through it.
\par \lquote Sirius?\rquote  Harry spoke again, but more quietly now that he was nearer.
\par He had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the veil on the other side of the archway. Gripping his wand very tightly, he edged around the dais, but there was nobody there; all that could be seen was the other side of the tat
\-tered black veil.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s go,\rquote  called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps. \lquote This isn\rquote t right, Harry, come on, let\rquote s go.\rquote 
\par She sounded scared, much more scared than she had 
in the room where the brains swam, yet Harry thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it, old though it was. The gently rippling veil intrigued him; he felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it.
\par \lquote Harry, let\rquote s go, OK?\rquote  said Hermione more forcefully.
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  he said, but did not move. He had just heard something. There were faint whispering, murmuring noises coming from the other side of the veil.
\par \lquote What are you saying?\rquote  he said, very loudly, so that his words echoed all around the stone benches.
\par \lquote Nobody\rquote s talking, Harry!\rquote  said Hermione, now moving over to him.
\par \lquote Someone\rquote s whispering behind there,\rquote  he said, moving out of her reach and continuing to frown at the veil. \lquote Is that you, Ron?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m here, mate,\rquote  said Ron, appearing around the side of the archway.
\par \lquote Can\rquote t anyone else hear it?\rquote  Harry demanded, for the whispering and murmuring was becoming louder; without really meaning to put it there, he found his foot was on the dais.
\par \lquote I can hear them too,\rquote  breathed Luna, joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil. \lquote There are people }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 in there!

\par \lquote Sirius,\rquote  Harry repeated, still gazing, mesmerised, at the contin\-uously swaying veil. \lquote Yeah ...\rquote 
\par Something finally slid back into place in his brain; }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Sirius, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 cap\-
tured, bound and tortured, and he was staring at this archway ...
\par He took several paces back from the dais and wrenched his eyes from the veil.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s go,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote That\rquote s what I\rquote ve been trying to \endash  well, come on, then!\rquote  said Hermione, and she led the way back around the dais. On the other side, Ginny and Neville were s
taring, apparently entranced, at the veil too. Without speaking, Hermione took hold of Ginny\rquote s arm, Ron grabbed Neville\rquote s, and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the door.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you reckon that arch was?\rquote  Harry asked Hermione as they regained the dark circular room.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know, but whatever it was, it was dangerous,\rquote  she said firmly, again inscribing a fiery cross on the door.
\par Once more, the wall spun and became still again. Harry approached another door at random and pushed. It did not move.
\par \lquote What\rquote s wrong?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote It\rquote s ... locked ...\rquote  said Harry, throwing his weight at the door, but it didn\rquote t budge.
\par \lquote This is it, then, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Ron excitedly, joining Harry in the attempt to force the door open. \lquote Bound to be!\rquote 
\par \lquote Get out of the way!\rquote  said Hermione sharply. She pointed her wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote

\par Nothing happened.
\par \lquote Sirius\rquote s knife!\rquote  said Harry. He pulled it out from insid
e his robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall. The others all watched eagerly as he ran it from top to bottom, withdrew it and then flung his shoulder again at the door. It remained as firmly shut as ever. What was more, when Harry 
looked down at the knife, he saw the blade had melted.
\par \lquote Right, we\rquote re leaving that room,\rquote  said Hermione decisively.
\par \lquote But what if that\rquote s the one?\rquote  said Ron, staring at it with a mix\-ture of apprehension and longing.
\par \lquote It can\rquote t be, Harry could get through all the doors in his dream,\rquote  said Hermione, marking the door with another fiery cross as Harry replaced the now-useless handle of Sirius\rquote s knife in his pocket.
\par \lquote You know what could be in there?\rquote  said Luna eagerly, as the wall started to spin yet again.
\par \lquote Something blibbering, no doubt,\rquote  said Hermione under her breath and Neville gave a nervous little laugh.
\par The wall slid to a halt and Harry, with a feeling of increasing desperation, pushed the next door open.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote This is it!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par He knew it at once by the beautiful, dancing, diamond-sparkling light. As Harry\rquote s eyes became accustomed to the brilliant glare, he saw clocks gleaming from every surface, large and small, grand\-
father and carriage, hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length 
of the room, so that a busy, relentless ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule, marching footsteps. The source of the dancing, diamond-bright light was a towering crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room.
\par \lquote This way!\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s hea
rt was pumping frantically now that he knew they were on the right track; he led the way down the narrow space between the lines of desks, heading, as he had done in his dream, for the source of the light, the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he was that
 stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing, glittering wind.
\par \lquote Oh, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 look!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
said Ginny, as they drew nearer, pointing at the very heart of the bell jar.
\par Drifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny, jewel-bright egg. As it rose in the jar, it cracked open and a humming\-
bird emerged, which was carried to the very top of the jar, but as it fell on the draught its feathers became bedraggled and damp again, and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg.
\par \lquote Keep going!\rquote  said Harry sharply, because Ginny showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the egg\rquote s progress back into a bird.
\par \lquote You dawdled enough by that old arch!\rquote  she said crossly, but fol\-lowed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it.
\par \lquote This is it,\rquote  Harry said again, and his heart was now pumping so hard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech, \lquote it\rquote s through here \endash \rquote 
\par He glanced around at them all; they had their wands out and looked suddenly serious and anxious. He looked back at the door and pushed. It swung open.
\par They were there, they had found the place: high as a church and full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small, dusty, glass orbs. They glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle-brackets set at intervals along the shelves. Like those in
 the circular room behind them, their flames were burning blue. The room was very cold.
\par Harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles between two rows of shelves. He could not hear anything or see the slightest sign of movement.
\par \lquote You said it was row ninety-seven,\rquote  whispered Hermione.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  breathed Harry, looking up at the end of the closest row. Beneath the branch of blue-glowing candles protruding from it glimmered the silver figure fifty-three.
\par \lquote We need to go right, I think,\rquote  whispered Hermione, squinting to the next row. \lquote Yes ... that\rquote s fifty-four ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Keep your wands ready,\rquote  Harry said softly.
\par They crept forward, glancing behind them as they went on down the long alleys of shelves, the further ends of which were in near-total darkness.
 Tiny, yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb on the shelves. Some of them had a weird, liquid glow; others were as dull and dark within as blown light bulbs.
\par They passed row eighty-four ... eighty-five ... Harry was lis\-tening hard for the slightest sound of movement, but Sirius might be gagged now, or else unconscious ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 or, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 said an unbidden voice inside his head, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 he might already be dead ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par I\rquote d have felt it, he told himself, his heart now hammering against his Adam\rquote s apple, I\rquote d already know ...
\par \lquote Ninety-seven!\rquote  whispered Hermione.
\par They stood grouped around the end of the row, gazing down the alley beside it. There was nobody there.
\par \lquote He\rquote s right down at the end,\rquote  said Harry, whose mouth had become slightly dry. \lquote You can\rquote t see properly from here.\rquote 
\par And he led them between the towering rows of glass balls, some of which glowed softly as they passed ...
\par \lquote He should be near here,\rquote  whispered Harry, convinced that every step was going to bring the ragged form of Sirius into view on the darkened floor. \lquote Anywhere here ... really close ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote  said Hermione tentatively, but he did not want to respond. His mouth was very dry.
\par \lquote Somewhere about ... here ...\rquote  he said.
\par They had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim candlelight. There was nobody there. All was echoing, dusty silence.
\par \lquote He might be ...\rquote  Harry whispered hoarsely, peering down the next alley. \lquote Or maybe ...\rquote  He hurried to look down the one beyond that.
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote  said Hermione again.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  he snarled.
\par \lquote I ... I don\rquote t think Sirius is here.\rquote 
\par Nobody spoke. Harry did not want to look at any of them. He felt sick. He did not understand why Sirius was not here. He had to be here. This was where he, Harry, had seen him ...
\par He ran up the space at the end of the rows, staring down them. Empty aisle after empty aisle flickered past. He ran the other way, back past his staring companions. There was no sign of Sirius any\-where, nor any hint of a struggle.
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote  Ron called.
\par \lquote What?\rquote 
\par He did not want to hear what Ron had to say; did not want t
o hear Ron tell him he had been stupid or suggest that they ought to go back to Hogwarts, but the heat was rising in his face and he felt as though he would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while before facing the brightness of the Atriu
m above and the others\rquote  accusing stares ...
\par \lquote Have you seen this?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry, but eagerly this time \endash  it had to be a sign that Sirius had been there, a clue. He strode back to where they were all standing, a little way down row ninety-seve
n, but found nothing except Ron staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelf.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  Harry repeated glumly.
\par \lquote It\rquote s \endash  it\rquote s got your name on,\rquote  said Ron.
\par Harry moved a little closer. Ron was pointing at one of the small glass spheres that glowed with a dull inner light, though it was very dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many years.
\par \lquote My name?\rquote  said Harry blankly.
\par He stepped forwards. Not as tall as Ron, he had to crane his neck to read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty glass ball. In spidery writing was written a date of some sixteen years previously, and below that:

\par \lquote Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me?\rquote  he said quietly, gazing at Lucius Malfoy, his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand. It was hardly larger than a Snitch and still gritty with dust. \lquote And he\rquote

\par \lquote RUN!\rquote  Harry yelled, as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to fall from above. He seized a handful of Hermione\rquote

\par They ran as quietly as they could, past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching, towards the exit into the circular hallway at the far end 
of the room. They were almost there when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door Hermione had charmed shut.

\par It was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull; his cheeks becoming smooth, his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz ...
\par A baby\rquote s head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again; but even as they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previous prop
ortions again; thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin ...
\par \lquote It\rquote s Time,\rquote  said Hermione in an awestruck voice. Time ...\rquote 
\par The Death Eater shook his ugly head again, trying to clear it, but before he could pull himself together it began to shrink back to babyhood once more ...
\par There was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream.
\par \lquote RON?\rquote  Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous trans\-formation taking place before them. \lquote GINNY? LUNA?\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  Hermione screamed.
\par The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar. His appearance was utterly bizarre, his tiny baby\rquote 
s head bawling loudly while his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions, narrowly missing Harry, who had ducked. Harry raised his wand but to his amazement Hermione seized his arm.
\par \lquote You can\rquote t hurt a baby!\rquote 
\par There was no time to argue the point; Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy and knew, too late, that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position.
\par \lquote Come on!\rquote  he said, and leaving the ugly baby-headed Death Eater staggering behind them they took off for the door that stood open at the other end of the room, leading back into the black hallway.
\par They had run halfway towards it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters running across the black room towards them; veering left, he burst instead into a small, dark, cluttered office and slammed the door behind them.

\par With a cry of triumph, both yelled:

\par \lquote Well done, Ha\emdash \rquote 
\par But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand; a streak of what looked like purple flame passed right across Hermione\rquote s chest. She gave a tiny \lquote Oh!\rquote 
 as though of surprise and crumpled on to the floor, where she lay motionless.
\par \lquote HERMIONE!\rquote 
\par Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly towards her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of him. The Death Eater kicked out hard at Neville\rquote s head as he emerged \endash  his foot broke Neville\rquote 
s wand in two and connected with his face. Neville 
gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching his mouth and nose. Harry twisted around, his own wand held high, and saw that the Death Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at Harry, who recognised the long, pale, twisted face fro
m the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Daily Prophet: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts.

\par Dolohov grinned. With his free hand, he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in Harry\rquote s hand, to himself, then at Hermione. Though he could no longer speak, his meaning coul
d not have been clearer. Give me the prophecy, or you get the same as her ...
\par \lquote Like you won\rquote t kill us all anyway, the moment I hand it over!\rquote  said Harry.
\par A whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly: he had one hand on Hermione\rquote s shoulder, which was still warm, yet did not dare look at her properly. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Then there was a crash outside the door and Dolohov looked over his shoulder \endash  the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncon\-
trollably at everything around him. Harry seized his chance:
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote PETRIFICUS TOTALUS!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par The spell hit Dolohov before he could block it and he toppled forwards across his comrade, both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch.
\par \lquote Hermione,\rquote  Harry said at once, shaking her as the baby-headed Death Eater blundered out of sight again. \lquote Hermione, wake up \'85\rquote 
\par \lquote Whaddid he do to her?\rquote  said Neville, crawling out from under the desk to kneel at her other side, blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose.
\par \lquote I dunno ...\rquote 
\par Neville groped for Hermione\rquote s wrist.
\par \lquote Dat\rquote s a pulse, Harry, I\rquote b sure id is.\rquote 
\par Such a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a moment he felt light-headed.
\par \lquote She\rquote s alive?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I dink so.\rquote 
\par There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sound of more footsteps, but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby-headed Death Eater in the next room.
\par \lquote Neville, we\rquote re not far from the exit,\rquote  Harry whispered, \lquote we\rquote re right next to that circular room ... if we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I\rquote

\par He stood up and seized one of Hermione\rquote s arms, glaring at Harry, who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione\rquote s limp form over Neville\rquote s shoulders.
\par \lquote Wait,\rquote  said Harry, snatching up Hermione\rquote s wand from the floor and shoving it into Neville\rquote s hand, \lquote you\rquote d better take this.\rquote 
\par Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly towards the door.
\par \lquote My gran\rquote s going do kill be,\rquote  said Neville thickly, blood spattering from his nose as he spoke, \lquote dat was by dad\rquote s old wand.\rquote 
\par Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cau\-tiously. The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling and confused, while th
e glass-fronted cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter and repair itself on the wall behind them.
\par \lquote He\rquote s never going to notice us,\rquote  he whispered. \lquote C\rquote mon ... keep close behind me ...\rquote 
\par They crept out of the office and back towards the door into the black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted. They walked a few steps forwards, Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione\rquote 
s weight; the door of the Time Room swung shut behind them and the walls began to rotate once more. The recent blow on the back of Harry\rquote 
s head seemed to have unsteadied him; he narrowed his eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again. With a sinking heart, Harry saw that Hermione\rquote s fiery crosses had faded from the doors.
\par \lquote So which way d\rquote you reck\emdash ?\rquote 
\par But before they could make a decision as to which way to try, a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it.
\par \lquote Ron!\rquote  croaked Harry, dashing towards them. \lquote Ginny \endash  are you all \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forwards, seizing the front of Harry\rquote s robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes, \lquote there you are ... ha ha ha ... you look funny, Harry ... you\rquote re all messed up ...\rquote 

\par Ron\rquote s face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth. Next moment his knees had given way, but he still clutched the front of Harry\rquote s robes, so that Harry was pulled into a kind of bow.
\par \lquote Ginny?\rquote  Harry said fearfully. \lquote What happened?\rquote 
\par But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle.
\par \lquote I think her ankle\rquote s broken, I heard something crack,\rquote  whispered Luna, who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt. \lquote Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets; it was a very odd place,

\par \lquote Harry, we saw Uranus up close!\rquote  said Ron, still giggling feebly. \lquote Get it, Harry? We saw Uranus \endash  ha ha ha \endash \rquote 
\par A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron\rquote s mouth and burst.
\par \lquote \endash  anyway, one of them grabbed Ginny\rquote s foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but ...\rquote 
\par Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes still closed.
\par \lquote And what about Ron?\rquote  said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of Harry\rquote s robes.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know what they hit him with,\rquote  said Luna sadly, \lquote but he\rquote s gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all.\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  said Ron, pulling Harry\rquote s ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly, \lquote you know who this girl is, Harry? She\rquote s Loony ... Loony Lovegood ... ha ha ha ...\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote ve got to get out of here,\rquote  said Harry firmly. \lquote Luna, can you help Ginny?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping, then putting an arm around Ginny\rquote s waist and pulling her up.
\par \lquote It\rquote s only my ankle, I can do it myself!\rquote  said Ginny impatiently, but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support. Harry pulled Ron\rquote s arm over his shoulder just as, so many months ago, he had pulled Dud
ley\rquote s. He looked around: they had a one in twelve chance of getting the exit right first time \endash 
\par He heaved Ron towards a door; they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped in, led by Bellatrix Lestrange.

\par \lquote It doesn\rquote t matter!\rquote  said a man\rquote s voice. \lquote There are other ways in \endash  WE\rquote VE GOT THEM, THEY\rquote RE HERE!\rquote 
\par Harry spun around; they were back in the Brain Room and, sure enough, there were doors all around the walls. He could hear foot\-steps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first.
\par \lquote Luna \endash  Neville \endash  help me!\rquote 
\par The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they went; Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door:
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Colloportus!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par There were footsteps running along behind the doors, every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one, so it creaked and shuddered; Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall \endash 
 then, as Harry reached the very top of the room, he heard Luna cry:

\par He turned in time to see her flying through the air; five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and on to the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still a

\par \lquote Get Potter!\rquote  shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him; he dodged her and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy \endash 
\par \lquote Hey!\rquote  said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now tot\-tering drunkenly towards Harry, giggling. \lquote Hey, Harry, there are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 brains }{

towards Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unravelling like rolls of film \endash

\par Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would not be anything good. He darted forwards but Ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands.

\par One of the Death Eaters shot their own Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him by inches. Harry and Neville were now the
 only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of whom sent off streams of silver light like arrows which missed but left craters in the wall behind them. Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange raced right at him: holding the prophecy high above his 
head, he sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others.
\par It seemed to have worked; they streaked after him, knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the proph
ecy, and he dashed through the only door still open, the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come; inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron and find some way of releasing him. He ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor v
anish \endash 
\par He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body, he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais. The 
whole room was ringing with the Death Eaters\rquote 
 laughter: he looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending towards him, while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench towards him. Harry got to h
is feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him: the prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand, his wand clutched tightly in his right. He backed away, looking around, trying to keep all the Death Eaters within hi
s sight. The back of his legs hit something solid: he had reached the dais where the archway stood. He climbed backwards onto it.
\par The Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him. Some were panting as hard as he was. One was bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the Body-Bind Curse, was leering, his wand pointing straight at Harry\rquote s face.
\par \lquote Potter, your race is run,\rquote  drawled Lucius Malfoy, pulling off his mask, \lquote now hand me the prophecy like a good boy.\rquote

\par Then, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks and Kingsley.
\par Malfoy turned, and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him. Harry did not wait to see wheth
er it had made contact, but dived off the dais out of the way. The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step towards the sunken floor.
 Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville crawling along. He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville.
\par \lquote Are you OK?\rquote  he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their heads.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Neville, trying to pull himself up.
\par \lquote And Ron?\rquote 
\par \lquote I dink he\rquote s all righd \endash  he was still fighding de brain when I lefd \endash \rquote 
\par The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Neville\rquote s hand had been only seconds befor
e; both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere, seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes were barely touching the floor.
\par \lquote Give it to me,\rquote  growled a voice in his ear, \lquote give me the pro\-phecy \endash \rquote 
\par The man was pressing so tightly on Harry\rquote 
s windpipe that he could not breathe. Through watering eyes he saw Sirius duelling with a Death Eater some ten feet away; Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix \endash 
 nobody seemed to realise that Harry was dying. He turned his wand backwards towards the man\rquote s side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and the man\rquote s free hand was groping towards the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy 
\endash 
\par \lquote AARGH!\rquote 
\par Neville had come lunging out of nowhere; unable to articulate a spell, he had jabbed Hermione\rquote s wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eater\rquote 
s mask. The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of pain. Harry whirled around to face him and gasped:

\par \lquote Thanks!\rquote  Harry said to Neville, pulling him aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past, duelling so fiercely that their wands were blurs; then Harry\rquote 
s foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped. For a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy, but then he saw Moody\rquote s magical eye spinning away across the floor.
\par Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his long pale face twisted with glee.

\par Dolohov raised his wand again. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Accio proph}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \emdash \rquote 
\par Sirius had hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder and sent him flying out of the way. The prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harry\rquote 
s fingers but he had managed to cling on to it. Now Sirius and Dolohov were duelling, their wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from their wand-tips \endash 
\par Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing move\-ment he had used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Petrificus Totalus!\rquote  }{

\par They both ducked again; a jet of green light had narrowly missed Sirius. Across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps, her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat and Bellatrix, triumphant, running back towards the fray.

\par \lquote Harry, take the prophecy, grab Neville and run!\rquote  Sirius yelled, dashing to meet Bellatrix. Harry did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across his field of vision, battling with the pock\-

\par \lquote The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!\rquote  snarled Lucius Malfoy\rquote s voice in his ear, and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy\rquote s wand pressing hard between his ribs.
\par \lquote No \endash  get \endash  off \endash  me ... Neville \endash  catch it!\rquote 
\par Harry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville spun himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest. Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled, \lquote }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par Malfoy was blasted off his back. As Harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw Malfoy smash into t
he dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now duelling. Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and Neville again, but before he could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between them.
\par \lquote Harry, round up the others and GO!\rquote 
\par Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily on to the first tier of stone steps; Neville\rquote 
s legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight; Harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step \endash 
\par A spell hit the stone bench at Harry\rquote s heel; it crumbled away and he fell back to the step below. Neville sank to the ground, his legs still jerking and thrashing, and he thrust the prophecy into his pocket.
\par \lquote Come on!\rquote  said Harry desperately, hauling at Neville\rquote s robes. \lquote Just try and push with your legs \endash \rquote 
\par He gave another stupendous heave and Neville\rquote s robes tore all along the left seam \endash  the small spun-glass ball dropped from his pocket and, before either of them could catch it, one of Neville\rquote s floundering feet kicked it: it flew some
 ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them. As both of them stared at the place where it had broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any but them. Harry cou
ld see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he hear. The figure stopped speaking and dis\-solved into nothingness.
\par \lquote Harry, I\rquote b sorry!\rquote  cried Neville, his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder. \lquote I\rquote b so sorry, Harry, I didn\rquote d bean do \endash \rquote

said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported, staring over Harry\rquote s shoulder.
\par \lquote What?\rquote 
\par \lquote DUBBLEDORE!\rquote 
\par Harry turned to look where Neville was staring. Directly above them, framed in the doorway from the Brain Room, stood Albus Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his face white and furious. Harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of 
his body \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 they were saved.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
\par Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry, who had no more thoughts of leaving. Dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realised he was there and yelled to the others. One of the
 Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite. Dumbledore\rquote s spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line \endash 
\par Only one pair was still battling, apparently unaware of the new arrival. Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix\rquote s jet of red light: he was laughing at her.
\par \lquote Come on, you can do better than that!\rquote  he yelled, his voice echoing around the cavernous room.
\par The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest.
\par The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened in shock.
\par Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so. He was jumping down the steps again, pulling out his wand, as Dumbledore, too, turned towards the dais.
\par It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall: his body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backwards through the ragged veil hanging from the arch.
\par Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his god\-father\rquote s wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient do
orway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind, then fell back into place.

\par But Sirius did not reappear.
\par \lquote SIRIUS!\rquote  Harry yelled. \lquote SIRIUS!\rquote 
\par He had reached the floor, his breath coming in searing gasps. Sirius must be just behind the curtain, he, Harry, would pull him back out ...
\par But as he reached the ground and sprinted towards the dais, Lupin grabbed Harry around the chest, holding him back.
\par \lquote There\rquote s nothing you can do, Harry \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Get him, save him, he\rquote s only just gone through!\rquote

\endash  who was standing feet from them behind that old curtain \endash  was not going to emerge at any moment, shaking back his dark hair and eager to re-enter the battle.
\par Lupin dragged Harry away from the dais. Harry, still staring at the archway, was angry at Sirius now for keeping him waiting \endash 
\par But some part of him realised
, even as he fought to break free from Lupin, that Sirius had never kept him waiting before ... Sirius had risked everything, always, to see Harry, to help him ... if Sirius was not reappearing out of that archway when Harry was yelling for him as though 
his life depended on it, the only possible expla\-nation was that he could not come back ... that he really was \endash 
\par Dumbledore had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in the middle of the room, seemingly immobilised by invisible ropes; Mad-Eye Moody had
 crawled across the room to where Tonks lay, and was attempting to revive her; behind the dais there were still flashes of light, grunts and cries \endash  Kingsley had run for\-ward to continue Sirius\rquote s duel with Bellatrix.
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote 
\par Neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where Harry stood. Harry was no longer struggling against Lupin, who maintained a precautionary grip on his arm nevertheless.
\par \lquote Harry ... I\rquote b really sorry ...\rquote  said Neville. His legs were still dancing uncontrollably. \lquote Was dad man \endash  was Sirius Black a \endash  a friend of yours?\rquote 
\par Harry nodded.
\par \lquote Here,\rquote  said Lupin quietly, and pointing his wand at Neville\rquote s legs he said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Finite.\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par There was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais. Harry saw Kingsley hit the ground yelling in pain: Bellatrix Lestrange turned tail and ran as Dumbledore whipped around. He aimed a spell at her but she deflected it; she was halfway up the steps now 
\endash 
\par \lquote Harry \endash  no!\rquote  cried Lupin, but Harry had already ripped his arm from Lupin\rquote s slackened grip.
\par \lquote SHE KILLED SIRIUS!\rquote  bellowed Harry. \lquote SHE KILLED HIM \endash  I\rquote LL KILL HER!\rquote 
\par And he was off, scrambling up the stone benches; people were shouting behind him but he did not care. The hem of Bellatrix\rquote s robes whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the brains were swimming ...
\par She aimed a curse over her shoulder. The tank rose into the air and tipped. Harry was deluged in the foul-smelling potion within: the brains slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long coloured tentacles, but he shouted, }{\rtlch\fcs1

, past Ron, who giggled feebly, and Hermione, who was still unconscious. He wrenched open the door into the circular black hall and saw Bellatrix dis
appearing through a door on the other side of the room; beyond her was the corridor leading back to the lifts.
\par He ran, but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls were already rotating. Once more, he was surrounded by streaks of blue light from the whirling candelabra.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s the exit?\rquote  he shouted desperately, as the wall rumbled to a halt again. \lquote Where\rquote s the way out?\rquote 
\par The room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask. The door right behind him flew open and the corridor towards the lifts stretched ahead of him, torch-lit and empty. He ran ...
\par He could hear a lift clattering ahead; he sprinted up the passageway, swung around the coiner and slammed his fist on to the button to call a second lift. It jangled and banged lower and lower; the grille
s slid open and Harry dashed inside, now hammering the button marked \lquote Atrium\rquote . The doors slid shut and he was rising ...
\par He forced his way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open and looked around. Bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at t
he other end of the hall, but she looked back as he sprinted towards her and aimed another spell at him. He dodged behind the Fountain of Magical Brethren: the spell zoomed past him and hit the wrought-gold gates at the other end of the Atrium so that the
y rang like bells. There were no more footsteps. She had stopped running. He crouched behind the statues, listening.

\par Voldemort raised his wand and another jet of green light streaked at Dumbledor
e, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak. Next second, he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his wand towards the remnants of the fountain. The other statues sprang to life. The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and se
n
t spells streaming uselessly off its chest, before it dived at her, pinning her to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin and the house-elf scuttled towards the fireplaces set along the wall and the one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reap
peared beside the pool. The headless statue thrust Harry backwards, away from the fight, as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both.
\par \lquote It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,\rquote  said Dumbledore calmly. \lquote The Aurors are on their way \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote By which time I shall be gone, and you will be dead!\rquote  spat Voldemort. He sent another killing curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security guard\rquote s desk, which burst into flame.
\par Dumbledore flicked his own wand: the force o
f the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his golden guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. The spell, whatever it
 was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gong-like note reverberated from it \endash  an oddly chilling sound.
\par \lquote You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?\rquote  called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. \lquote Above such brutality, are you?\rquote 
\par \lquote We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,\rquote  Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk towards Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall. 
\lquote Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!\rquote  snarled Voldemort.
\par \lquote You are quite wrong,\rquote  said Dumbledore, still closing in upon Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the mat
ter over drinks. Harry felt scared to see him walking along, undefended, shieldless; he wanted to cry out a warning, but his headless guard kept shunting him backwards towards the wall, blocking his every attempt to get out from behind it. \lquote 
Indeed, your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness \endash \rquote 
\par Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the
 blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip. A long thin flame flew from the tip; it wrapped itself around Voldemort, shield and 
all. For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had won, but then the fiery rope became a serpent, which relin\-quished its hold on Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furi\-ously, to face Dumbledore.
\par Voldemort vanished; the snake reared from the floor, ready to strike \endash 
\par There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood.

\par Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole: he burst into flame and fell to

 the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; and the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass.
\par For a few seconds Voldemort was visible only as a dark, rip\-pling, faceless figure, shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth, clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass \endash

\par The Atrium was full of people; the floor was reflecting the emerald green flames that had burst into life in all the fireplaces along one wal

\par \lquote He was there!\rquote  shouted a scarlet-robed man with a ponytail, who was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall, where Bellatrix had lain trapped only moments before. \lquote

s absence. The delicate silver instruments stood once more on the spindle-legged tables, puffing and whirring serenely
. The portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames, heads lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of the picture. Harry looked through the window. There was a cool line of pale green along the horizon: dawn was appro
aching.
\par The silence and the stillness, broken only by the occasional grunt or snuffle of a sleeping portrait, was unbearable to him. If his surroundings could have reflected the feelings inside him, the pictures would have been screaming in pain. He walked 
around the quiet, beautiful office, breathing quickly, trying not to think. But he had to think ... there was no escape ...

\par A picture behind him gave a particularly loud grunting snore, and a cool voice said, \lquote Ah ... Harry Potter ...\rquote 
\par Phineas Nigellus gave a long yawn, stretching his arms as he watched Harry with shrewd, narrow eyes.
\par \lquote And what brings you here in the early hours of the morning?\rquote  said Phineas eventually. \lquote This office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful Headmaster. Or has Dumbledore sent you here? Oh, don\rquote t tell me ...\rquote 
 He gave another shuddering yawn. \lquote Another message for my worthless great-great-grandson?\rquote 
\par Harry could not speak. Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius was dead, but Harry could not tell him. To say it aloud would be to make it final, absolute, irretrievable.
\par A few more of the portraits had stirred now. Terror of being inter\-rogated made Harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob.
\par It would not turn. He was shut in.
\par \lquote I hope this means,\rquote  said the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who hung on the wall behind the Headmaster\rquote s desk, \lquote that Dumbledore will soon be back among us?\rquote 
\par Harry turned. The wizard was eying him with great interest. Harry nodded. He tugged again on the doorknob behind his back, but it remained immovable.
\par \lquote Oh good,\rquote  said the wizard. \lquote It has been very dull without him, very dull indeed.\rquote 
\par He settled himself on the throne-like chair on which he had been painted and smiled benignly upon Harry.
\par \lquote Dumbledore thinks very highly of you, as I am sure you know,\rquote  he said comfortably. \lquote Oh yes. Holds you in great esteem.\rquote 
\par The guilt filling the whole of Harry\rquote 
s chest like some monstrous, weighty parasite, now writhed and squirmed. Harry could not stand this, he could not stand being himself any more ... he had never felt more trapped inside his own head and body, never wished so intensely that he could b
e somebody, anybody, else ...
\par The empty fireplace burst into emerald green flame, making Harry leap away from the door, staring at the man spinning inside the grate. As Dumbledore\rquote s tall form unfolded itself from the fire, the wizards and witches on the su
rrounding walls jerked awake, many of them giving cries of welcome.
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote  said Dumbledore softly.
\par He did not look at Harry at first, but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew, from an inside pocket of his robes, the tiny, ugly, feath
erless Fawkes, whom he placed gently on the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the full-grown Fawkes usually stood.
\par \lquote Well, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore, finally turning away from the baby bird, \lquote you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the night\rquote s events.\rquote 
\par Harry tried to say, \lquote Good,\rquote  but no sound came out. It seemed to him that Dumbledore was reminding him of the amount of damage he had caused, and although Dumbledore was for once looking
 at him directly, and although his expression was kindly rather than accusatory, Harry could not bear to meet his eyes.
\par \lquote Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St Mungo\rquote s, but it seems she will make a full recovery.\rquote 
\par Harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet, which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler. He was sure all the portraits around the room were listening eagerly to every word Dumbledore spoke, wondering whe
re Dumbledore and Harry had been, and why there had been injuries.
\par \lquote I know how you\rquote re feeling, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore very quietly.
\par \lquote No, you don\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry, and his voice was suddenly loud and strong; white-hot anger leapt inside him; Dumbledore knew }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 nothing }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par \lquote That\rquote s enough, Phineas,\rquote  said Dumbledore.

\par \lquote There is no shame in what you are feeling, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore\rquote s voice. \lquote On the contrary ... the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.\rquote

\par \lquote THEN \endash  I \endash  DON\rquote T \endash  WANT \endash  TO \endash  BE \endash  HUMAN!\rquote  Harry roared, and he seized the delicate silver instrument from the spindle-legged table beside him and flung it across the ro
om; it shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall. Several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright, and the portrait of Armando Dippet said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par He seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that, too. It broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in different directions.
\par \lquote You do care,\rquote  said Dumbledore. He had not flinched or made a single move to stop Harry demolishing his office. His expression was calm, almost detached. \lquote 
You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it.\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  DON\rquote T!\rquote  H
arry screamed, so loudly that he felt his throat might tear, and for a second he wanted to rush at Dumbledore and break him, too; shatter that calm old face, shake him, hurt him, make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside himself.
\par \lquote Oh, yes, you do,\rquote  said Dumbledore, still more calmly. \lquote You have now lost your mother, your father, and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known. Of course you care.\rquote 
\par \lquote YOU DON\rquote T KNOW HOW I FEEL!\rquote  Harry roared. \lquote YOU \endash  STANDING THERE \endash  YOU \endash \rquote 
\par But words were no longer enough, smashing things was no more help; he wanted to run, he wanted to keep running and never look back, he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes staring at him, that hatefully calm old face. He ran to the 
door, seized the doorknob again and wrenched at it.
\par But the door would not open.
\par Harry turned back to Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Let me out,\rquote  he said. He was shaking from head to foot.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Dumbledore simply.
\par For a few seconds they stared at each other.
\par \lquote Let me out,\rquote  Harry said again.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  Dumbledore repeated.
\par \lquote If you don\rquote t \endash  if you keep me in here \endash  if you don\rquote t let me \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote By all means continue destroying my possessions,\rquote  said Dumbledore serenely. \lquote I daresay I have too many.\rquote 
\par He walked around his desk and sat down behind it, watching Harry.
\par \lquote Let me out,\rquote  Harry said yet again, in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as Dumbledore\rquote s.
\par \lquote Not until I have had my say,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Do you \endash  do you think I want to \endash  do you think I give a \endash  I DON\rquote T CARE WHAT YOU\rquote VE GOT TO SAY!\rquote  Harry roared. \lquote I don\rquote t want to hear }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote You will,\rquote  said Dumbledore steadily. \lquote Because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be. If you are to attack me, as I know you are close to doing, I would like to have thoroughly earned it.\rquote 
\par \lquote What are you talking \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote It is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 my }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 fault that Sirius died,\rquote  said Dumbledore clearly. \lquote 
Or should I say, almost entirely my fault \endash  I will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole. Sirius was a brave, clever a
nd energetic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the Department of Mysterie
s
 tonight. If I had been open with you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight. And Sirius woul
d not have had to come after you. That blame lies with me, and with me alone.\rquote 
\par Harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but was unaware of it. He was gazing at Dumbledore, hardly breathing, listening yet barely understanding what he was hearing.
\par \lquote Please sit down,\rquote  said Dumbledore. It was not an order, it was a request.
\par Harry hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now lit\-tered with silver cogs and fragments of wood, and took the seat facing Dumbledore\rquote s desk.
\par \lquote Am I to understand,\rquote  said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harry\rquote s left, \lquote that my great-great-grandson \endash  the last of the Blacks \endash  is dead?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Phineas,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t believe it,\rquote  said Phineas brusquely.
\par Harry turned his head in time to see Phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in Grimmauld Place. He would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait, calling for Sirius through the house ...
\par \lquote Harry, I owe you an explanation,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote An expla\-nation of an old man\rquote s
 mistakes. For I see now that what I have done, and not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age. Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young ... and I seem to h
ave forgotten, lately ...\rquote 
\par The sun was rising properly now; there was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colour\-less and bright. The light fell upon Dumbledore, upon the silver of his eyebrows and beard, upon the li
nes gouged deeply into his face.
\par \lquote I guessed, fifteen years ago,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote when I saw the scar on your forehead, what it might mean. I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote ve told me this before, Professor,\rquote  said Harry bluntly. He did not care about being rude. He did not care about anything very much any more.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore apologetically. \lquote Yes, but you see \endash  it is necessary to start with your scar. For it became a
pparent, shortly after you rejoined the magical world, that I was correct, and that your scar was giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you, or else feeling powerful emotion.\rquote 
\par \lquote I know,\rquote  said Harry wearily.
\par \lquote And this ability of yours \endash  to detect Voldemort\rquote s presence, even when he is disguised, and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused \endash 
 has become more and more pronounced since Voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers.\rquote 
\par Harry did not bother to nod. He knew all of this already.
\par \lquote More recently,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote 
I became concerned that Voldemort might realise that this connection between you exists. Sure enough, there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence. I am spea
king, of course, of the night when you witnessed the attack on Mr Weasley.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, Snape told me,\rquote  Harry muttered.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Professor }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Snape, Harry,\rquote  Dumbledore corrected him quietly. \lquote 
But did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you? Why I did not teach you Occlumency? Why I had not so much as looked at you for months?\rquote 
\par Harry looked up. He could see now that Dumbledore looked sad and tired.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  Harry mumbled. \lquote Yeah, I wondered.\rquote 
\par \lquote You see,\rquote  Dumbledore continued, \lquote I believed it could not be long 
before Voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind, to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager to give him more incentives to do so. I was sure that if he realised that our relationship was \endash  or had ever been \endash 
 closer than that 
of headmaster and pupil, he would seize his chance to use you as a means to spy on me. I feared the uses to which he would put you, the possibility that he might try and possess you. Harry, I believe I was right to think that Voldemort would have made use
 of you in such a way. On those rare occasions when we had close con\-tact, I thought I saw a shadow of him stir behind your eyes ...\rquote 
\par Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him, ready to strike, in those moments when he and Dumbledore had made eye-contact.
\par \lquote Voldemort\rquote s aim in possessing you, as he demonstrated tonight, would not have been my destruction. It would have been yours. He hoped, when he possessed you briefly a short while ago, that I would sacrifice you in the hope of killi
ng him. So you see, I have been trying, in distancing myself from you, to protect you, Harry. An old man\rquote s mistake ...\rquote 
\par He sighed deeply. Harry was letting the words wash over him. He would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago, but now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that was the loss of Sirius; none of it mattered ...
\par \lquote Sirius told me you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley\rquote s attack. I knew at once that my w
orst fears were correct: Voldemort had realised he could use you. In an attempt to arm you against Voldemort\rquote s assaults on your mind, I arranged Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape.\rquote 
\par He paused. Harry watched the sunlight, which was sliding slowly across the polished surface of Dumbledore\rquote s desk, illuminate a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill. Harry could tell that the por\-
traits all around them were awake and listening raptly to Dumbledore\rquote s explanation; he could hear the occasional rustle of robes, the slight clearing of a throat. Phineas Nigellus had still not returned ...
\par \lquote Professor Snape discovered,\rquote  Dumbledore resumed, \lquote that you had been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for months. Voldemort, of course, had been obsessed with the pos\-
sibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body; and as he dwelled on the door, so did you, though you did not know what it meant.
\par \lquote And then you saw Rookwood, who worked in the Department of Mysteries before his arrest, telling Voldemort what we had known all along \endash 
 that the prophecies held in the Ministry of Magic are heavily protected. Only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the shelves without suffering madness: in this case, either Voldemort himself would
 have to enter the Ministry of Magic, and risk revealing himself at last \endash  or else you would have to take it for him. It became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master Occlumency.\rquote 
\par \lquote But I didn\rquote t,\rquote  muttered Harry. He said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside him: a confession must surely relieve some of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart. \lquote I didn\rquote t practise, I didn\rquote 
t bother, I could\rquote ve stopped myself having those dreams, Hermione kept telling me to do it, if I had he\rquote d never have been able to show me where to go, and \endash  Sirius wouldn\rquote t \endash  Sirius wouldn\rquote t \endash \rquote 

\par Something was erupting inside Harry\rquote s head: a need to justify himself, to explain \endash 
\par \lquote I tried to check he\rquote d really taken Sirius, I went to Umbridge\rquote s office, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire and he said Sirius wasn\rquote t there, he said he\rquote d gone!\rquote 
\par \lquote Kreacher lied,\rquote  said Dumbledore calmly. \lquote You are not his master, he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself. Kreacher intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic.\rquote 
\par \lquote He \endash  he sent me on purpose?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yes. Kreacher, I am afraid, has been serving more than one master for months.\rquote 
\par \lquote How?\rquote  said Harry blankly. \lquote He hasn\rquote t been out of Grimmauld Place for years.\rquote 
\par \lquote Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote when Sirius, apparently, shouted at him to \'93get out\'94
. He took Sirius at his word, and interpreted this as an order to leave the house. He went to the only Black family member for whom he had any respect left ... Black\rquote s cousin Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy.\rquote 
\par \lquote How do you know all this?\rquote  Harry said. His heart was beating very fast. He felt sick. He remembered worrying about Kreacher\rquote s odd absence over Christmas, remembered him turning up again in the attic ...
\par \lquote Kreacher told me last night,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote 
You see, when you gave Professor Snape that cryptic warning, he realised that you had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries. He, like you, attempted to contact Sirius at once. 
I should explain that members of the Order of the Phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire in Dolores Umbridge\rquote s office. Professor Snape found that Sirius was alive and safe in Grimmauld Place.
\par \lquote When, however, you did not return from your trip into the Forest with Dolores Umbridge, Professor Snape grew worried that you still believed Sirius to be a captive of Lord Voldemort\rquote s. He alerted certain Order members at once.\rquote 

\par Dumbledore heaved a great sigh and continued, \lquote 
Alastor Moody, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Remus Lupin were at Headquarters when he made contact. All agreed to go to your aid at once. Professor Snape requested that Sirius remain behind, as he needed somebody to remain a
t Headquarters to tell me what had happened, for I was due there at any moment. In the mean\-time he, Professor Snape, intended to search the Forest for you.
\par \lquote But Sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you. He delegated to 
Kreacher the task of telling me what had happened. And so it was that when I arrived in Grimmauld Place shortly after they had all left for the Ministry, it was the elf who told me \endash  laughing fit to burst \endash  where Sirius had gone.\rquote 

\par \lquote He was laughing?\rquote  said Harry in a hollow voice.
\par \lquote Oh, yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote You see, Kreacher was not able to betray us totally. He is not Secret Keeper for the Order, he could not give the Malfoys our whereabouts, or tell them any of the Order\rquote 
s confidential plans that he had b
een forbidden to reveal. He was bound by the enchantments of his kind, which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master, Sirius. But he gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort, yet must have seemed 
much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from repeating it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Like what?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world was you,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly. \lquote Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a
 mixture of father and brother. Voldemort knew already, of course, that Sirius was in the Order, and that you knew where he was \endash  but Kreacher\rquote 
s information made him realise that the one person for whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius Black.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s lips were cold and numb.
\par \lquote So ... when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night ...\rquote 
\par \lquote The Malfoys \endash  undoubtedly on Voldemort\rquote s instructions \endash  had told him he must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of
 Sirius being tortured. Then, if you decided to check whether Sirius was at home or not, Kreacher would be able to pretend he was not. Kreacher injured Buckbeak the Hippogriff yesterday, and, at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire, Sirius
 was upstairs tending to him.\rquote 
\par There seemed to be very little air in Harry\rquote s lungs; his breathing was quick and shallow.
\par \lquote And Kreacher told you all this ... and laughed?\rquote  he croaked.
\par \lquote He did not wish to tell me,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote But I am a suf\-ficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I \endash  persuaded him \endash 
 to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries.\rquote 
\par \lquote And,\rquote  whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees, \lquote and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote She was quite right, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I warned Sirius when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our Headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect. I also told him that Kreacher could be dangerous to
 us. I do not think Sirius took me very seriously, or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human\rquote s \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you blame \endash  don\rquote t you \endash  talk \endash  about Sirius like \endash \rquote  Harry\rquote s breath was constricted, he could not get the words out prop
erly; but the rage that had subsided briefly flared in him again: he would not let Dumbledore criticise Sirius. \lquote Kreacher\rquote s a lying \endash  foul \endash  he deserved \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Yes, he is to be pitied. His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby\rquote s. He was forced to do Sirius\rquote 
s bidding, because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved, but he felt no true loyalty to him. And whatever Kreacher\rquote s faults, it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher\rquote s lot easier \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote DON\rquote T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT!\rquote  Harry yelled.
\par He was on his feet again, furious, ready to fly at Dumbledore, who had plainly not understood Sirius at all, how brave he was, how much he had suffered ...
\par \lquote What about Snape?\rquote  Harry spat. \lquote You\rquote re not talking about him, are you? When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me as usual \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, you know Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge,\rquote  said Dumbledore steadily, \lquote 
but as I have explained, he informed the Order as soon as possible about what you had said. It was he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the Forest. It was he, too, who gave Professor Umbridge f
ake Veritaserum when she was attempting to force you to tell her Sirius\rquote s where\-abouts.\rquote 
\par Harry disregarded this; he felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape, it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt, and he wanted to hear Dumbledore agree with him.
\par \lquote Snape \endash  Snape g \endash  goaded Sirius about staying in the house \endash  he made out Sirius was a coward \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Snape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons!\rquote  Harry snarled. \lquote He threw me out of his office!\rquote 
\par \lquote I am aware of it,\rquote  said Dumbledore heavily. \lquote I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your
 mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him \endash \rquote  Harry remembered Ron\rquote s thoughts on the subject and plunged on \lquote \endash  how do you know he wasn\rquote t trying to soften me up for Voldemor
t, make it easier for him to get inside my \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I trust Severus Snape,\rquote  said Dumbledore simply. \lquote But I forgot \endash  another old man\rquote s mistake \endash  that some wounds run too deep for the healing. I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about your father 
\endash  I was wrong.\rquote 
\par \lquote But that\rquote s OK, is it?\rquote  yelled Harry, ignoring the scandalised faces and disapproving mutterings of the portraits on the walls. \lquote It\rquote s OK for Snape to hate my dad, but it\rquote s not OK for Sirius to hate Kreacher?
\rquote 
\par \lquote Sirius did not hate Kreacher,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote 
He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike ... the fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mis\-
treated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward.\rquote 
\par \lquote SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID HE?\rquote  Harry yelled.
\par \lquote I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it,\rquote  Dumbledore replied quietly. \lquote Sirius was not a cruel man, he w
as kind to house-elves in general. He had no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living reminder of the home Sirius had hated.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, he did hate it!\rquote  said Harry, his voice cracking, turning his back on Dumbledore and walking away. The sun was brigh
t inside the room now and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked, without realising what he was doing, without seeing the office at all. \lquote You made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it, that\rquote 
s why he wanted to get out last night \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I was trying to keep Sirius alive,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly.
\par \lquote People don\rquote t like being locked up!\rquote  Harry said furiously, rounding on him. \lquote You did it to me all last summer \endash \rquote 
\par Dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his long-fingered hands. Harr
y watched him, but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion, or sadness, or whatever it was from Dumbledore, did not soften him. On the contrary, he felt even angrier that Dumbledore was showing signs of weakness. He had no business being weak when Harry 
wanted to rage and storm at him.
\par Dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his half-moon glasses.
\par \lquote It is time,\rquote  he said, \lquote for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago, Harry. Please sit down. I am going to tell you everything. I ask only a little patience. You will have your chance to rage at me \endash 
 to do whatever you like \endash  when I have finished. I will not stop you.\rquote 
\par Harry glared at him for a moment, then flung himself back into the chair opposite Dumbledore and waited.
\par Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, \lquote Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well \endash 
 not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle\rquote s doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.\rquote 
\par He paused. Harry said nothing.
\par \lquote You might ask \endash  and with good reason \endash  why it had to be so. Why could some wizarding family not have taken you in? Many would have done so more than gladly, would have been honoured and delighted to raise you as a son.
\par \lquote My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but I realised. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters \endash  and many of them are almost as terrible as he \endash 
 were still at large, angry, desperate and violent. And I had to make my decision, too, with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone for ever? No. I knew 
not whether it would be ten, twenty or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure, too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you.
\par \lquote I knew that Voldemort\rquote s knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most com\-plex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power.

\par \lquote But I knew, too, where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated \endash 
 to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother\rquote 
s blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.\rquote 
\par \lquote She doesn\rquote t love me,\rquote  said Harry at once. \lquote She doesn\rquote t give a damn \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But she took you,\rquote  Dumbledore cut across him. \lquote She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother\rquote 
s sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.\rquote 
\par \lquote I still don\rquote t \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote While you can still call home the place where your mother\rquote s blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need
 return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, whilst you are there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom ma
y well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years.\rquote 
\par \lquote Wait,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Wait a moment.\rquote 
\par He sat up straighter in his chair, staring at Dumbledore.
\par \lquote You sent that Howler. You told her to remember \endash  it was your voice \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I thought,\rquote  said Dumbledore, inclining his head slightly, \lquote that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you. I suspected the Dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son.
\rquote 
\par \lquote It did,\rquote  said Harry quietly. \lquote Well \endash  my uncle more than her. He wanted to chuck me out, but after the Howler came she \endash  she said I had to stay.\rquote 
\par He stared at the floor for a moment, then said, \lquote But what\rquote s this got to do with \endash \rquote 
\par He could not say Sirius\rquote s name.
\par \lquote Five years ago, then,\rquote  continued Dumbledore, as though he had not paused in his story, \lquote 
you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well-nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could h
ave hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was working well.
\par \lquote And then ... well, you will remember the events of your first year at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do. You rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you and sooner \endash  much sooner \endash 
 than I had anticipated, you found yourself face to face with Voldemort. You survived again. You did more. You delayed his return to full power and strength. You fought a man\rquote s fight. I was ... prouder of you than I can say.
\par \lquote Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote 
An obvious flaw that I knew, even then, might be the undoing of it all. And yet, knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed, I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin it. I alone could
 prevent this, so I alone must be strong. And here was my first test, as you lay in the hospital wing, weak from your struggle with Voldemort.\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t understand what you\rquote re saying,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you remember asking me, as you lay in the hospital wing, why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby?\rquote 
\par Harry nodded.
\par \lquote Ought I to have told you then?\rquote

\par \lquote You do not see the flaw in the plan yet? No ... perhaps not. W
ell, as you know, I decided not to answer you. Eleven, I told myself, was much too young to know. I had never intended to tell you when you were eleven. The knowledge would be too much at such a young age.
\par \lquote I should have recognised the danger signs then. I should have asked myself why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which I knew, one day, I must give a ter\-
rible answer. I should have recognised that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day ... you were too young, much too young.
\par \lquote And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts. And once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced; once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams. You did not ask me again
, however, why Voldemort had left that mark on you. We discussed your scar, oh yes ... we came very, very close to the subject. Why did I not tell you everything?
\par \lquote Well, it seemed to me that twelve was, after all, hardly better than eleven to receive such 
information. I allowed you to leave my presence, bloodstained, exhausted but exhilarated, and if I felt a twinge of unease that I ought, perhaps, to have told you then, it was swiftly silenced. You were still so young, you see, and I could not find it in 
myself to spoil that night of triumph ...

\par \lquote I cared about you too much,\rquote  said Dumbledore simply. \lquote 
I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act.

\par \lquote Is there a defence? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have \endash  and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined \endash 
 not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. What did I care if numbers of nameless an
d faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands.
\par \lquote We entered your third year. I watched from afar as you strug\-gle
d to repel Dementors, as you found Sirius, learned what he was and rescued him. Was I to tell you then, at the moment when you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the Ministry? But now, at the age of thirteen, my excuses were run\-
ning out. Young you might be, but you had proved you were excep\-tional. My conscience was uneasy, Harry. I knew the time must come soon ...
\par \lquote But you came out of the maze last year, having watched Cedric Diggory die, having escaped death so narrowly yourself ..
. and I did not tell you, though I knew, now Voldemort had returned, I must do it soon. And now, tonight, I know you have long been ready for the knowledge I have kept from you for so long, because you have proved that I should have placed the burden upon
 you before this. My only defence is this: I have watched you struggling under more burdens than any student who has ever passed through this school and I could not bring myself to add another \endash  the greatest one of all.\rquote 
\par Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak.
\par \lquote I still don\rquote t understand.\rquote 
\par \lquote Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth. He knew the prophecy had been made, though he did not know its full contents. He set out to kill you when you were 
still a baby, believing he was ful\-
filling the terms of the prophecy. He discovered, to his cost, that he was mistaken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired. And so, since his return to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary escape fr
om him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his return: the knowledge of how to destroy you.\rquote 
\par The sun had risen fully now: Dumbledore\rquote s office was bathed in it.
 The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of a
shes.
\par \lquote The prophecy\rquote s smashed,\rquote  Harry said blankly. \lquote I was pulling Neville up those benches in the \endash  the room where the archway was, and I ripped his robes and it fell ...\rquote 
\par \lquote The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the Department of Mysteries. But the prophecy was made to somebody, and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly.\rquote 
\par \lquote Who heard it?\rquote  asked Harry, though he thought he knew the answer already.
\par \lquote I did,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote On a cold, wet night sixteen years ago, in a room above the bar at the Hog\rquote 
s Head inn. I had gone there to see an applicant for the post of Divination teacher, though it was against my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all. The applicant, however, was the great-great-gr
anddaughter of a very famous, very gifted Seer and I thought it common politeness to meet her. I was disappointed. It seemed to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself. I told her, courteously I hope, that I did not think she would be suitable for
 the post. I turned to leave.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore got to his feet and walked past Harry to the black cabinet that stood beside Fawkes\rquote s perch. He bent down, slid back a catch and took from inside it the shallow stone basin, carved with runes around the edges, in wh
ich Harry had seen his father tormenting Snape. Dumbledore walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve upon it, and raised his wand to his own temple. From it, he withdrew silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand and deposited them 
into the basin. He sat back down behind his desk and watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment. Then, with a sigh, he raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with its tip.
\par A figure rose out of it, draped in shawls, her 
eyes magnified to enormous size behind her glasses, and she revolved slowly, her feet in the basin. But when Sybill Trelawney spoke, it was not in her usual ethereal, mystic voice, but in the harsh, hoarse tones Harry had heard her use once before:

\par \lquote Professor Dumbledore?\rquote  Harry said very quietly, for Dumbledore, still staring at the Pensieve, seemed completely lost in thought. \lquote It ... did that mean ... what did that mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote It meant,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end of July, nearly sixteen years ago. This boy would be born
 to parents who had already defied Voldemort three times.\rquote 
\par Harry felt as though something was closing in on him. His breathing seemed difficult again.
\par \lquote It means \endash  me?\rquote 
\par \lquote The odd thing, Harry,\rquote  he said softly, \lquote is that it may not have meant you at all. Sybill\rquote 
s prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the end of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix, both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times. One, of course, was you. The other was Nev
ille Longbottom.\rquote 
\par \lquote But then ... but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and not Neville\rquote s?\rquote 
\par \lquote The official record was re-labelled after Voldemort\rquote s attack on you as a child,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that 
Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom Sybill was referring.\rquote 
\par \lquote Then \endash  it might not be me?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote I am afraid,\rquote  said Dumbledore slowly, looking as though every word cost him a great effort, \lquote that there is no doubt that it }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 is }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par \lquote But you said \endash  Neville was born at the end of July, too \endash  and his mum and dad \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final iden\-tifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort ... Voldemort himself would }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
mark him as his equal. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 And so he did, Harry. He chose you, not Neville. He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse.\rquote 
\par \lquote But he might have chosen wrong!\rquote  said Harry. \lquote He might have marked the wrong person!\rquote 
\par \lquote He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote 
And notice this, Harry: he chose, not the pure-blood (which, according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing) but the half-blood, like himself. He saw himself in you before he h
ad ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not kill you, as he intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to escape him not once, but four times so far \endash  something that neither your parents, nor Neville
\rquote s parents, ever achieved.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why did he do it, then?\rquote  said Harry, who felt numb and cold. \lquote Why did he try and kill me as a baby? He should have waited to see whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That might, indeed, have been the more practical course,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote except that Voldemort\rquote s information about the prophecy was incomplete. The Hog\rquote 
s Head inn, which Sybill chose for its cheapness, has long attracted, shall we say, a more inter\-esting clie
ntele than the Three Broomsticks. As you and your friends found out to your cost, and I to mine that night, it is a place where it is never safe to assume you are not being overheard. Of course, I had not dreamed, when I set out to meet Sybill Trelawney, 
that I would hear anything worth overhearing. My \endash  our \endash  one stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the prophecy and thrown from the building.\rquote 
\par \lquote So he only heard \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote He heard only the beginning, the part foretel
ling the birth of a boy in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort. Consequently, he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you, and marking you as his equal. So Voldemort never knew that there might be
 danger in attacking you, that it might be wise to wait, to learn more. He did not know that you would have }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 power the Dark Lord knows not \endash \rquote }{

\par \lquote But I don\rquote t!\rquote  said Harry, in a strangled voice. \lquote I haven\rquote t any powers he hasn\rquote t got, I couldn\rquote t fight the way he did tonight, I can\rquote t possess people or \endash  or kill them \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote There is a room in the Department of Mysteries,\rquote  interrupted Dumbledore, \lquote that is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human 
intelligence, than the forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there. It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all. That power to
ok you to save Sirius tonight. That power also saved you from pos\-
session by Voldemort, because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your heart that saved you.\rquote 
\par Harry closed his eyes. If he had not gone to save Sirius, Sirius would not have died ... More to stave off the moment when he would have to think of Sirius again, Harry asked, without caring much about the answer, \lquote The end of the prophecy ... it w
as some\-thing about ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 neither can live ...\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148

\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Harry, dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him, \lquote so does that mean that ... that one of us has got to kill the other one ... in the end?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par For a long time, neither of them spoke. Somewhere far beyond the office walls, Harry could hear the sound of voices, students heading down to the Great Hall for an early breakfast, perhaps. It seemed impossib
le that there could be people in the world who still desired food, who laughed, who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone for ever. Sirius seemed a million miles away already; even now a part of Harry still believed that if he had only pulled 
back that veil, he would have found Sirius looking back at him, greeting him, perhaps, with his laugh like a bark ...
\par \lquote I feel I owe you another explanation, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore hesitantly. \lquote You may, perhaps, have wondered why I never chose you as a pref

\par Ginny caught Harry\rquote s eye and looked away quickly, grinning.
\par \lquote So, anyway,\rquote  said Hermione, sitting up a little straighter and wincing again, \lquote what\rquote s going on in school?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, Flitwick\rquote s got rid of Fred and George\rquote s swamp,\rquote  said Ginny, \lquote he did it in about three seconds. But he left a tiny patch under the window and he\rquote s roped it off \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Why?\rquote  said Hermione, looking startled.
\par \lquote Oh, he just says it was a really good bit of magic,\rquote  said Ginny, shrugging.
\par \lquote I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George,\rquote  said Ron, through a mouthful of chocolate. \lquote They sent me all these, you know,\rquote  he told Harry, pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside him. \lquote 
Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?\rquote 
\par Hermione looked rather disapproving and asked, \lquote So has all the trouble stopped now Dumbledore\rquote s back?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Neville, \lquote everything\rquote s settled right back to normal.\rquote 
\par \lquote I s\rquote pose Filch is happy, is he?\rquote  asked Ron, propping a Chocolate Frog Card featuring Dumbledore against his water jug.
\par \lquote Not at all,\rquote  said Ginny. \lquote He\rquote s really, really miserable, actually ...\rquote  She lowered her voice to a whisper. \lquote He keeps saying Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts ...\rquote 
\par All six of them looked around. Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode alone into the Forest to rescue her from the centaurs; how he had done it \endash 
 how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him \endash  nobody knew, and Umbridge was certainly no
t telling. Since she had returned to the castle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. Nobody really knew what was wrong with her, either. Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were still bits of twigs and leaves i
n it, but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed.
\par \lquote Madam Pomfrey says she\rquote s just in shock,\rquote  whispered Hermione.
\par \lquote Sulking, more like,\rquote  said Ginny.
\par \lquote Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,\rquote  said Ron, and with his tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises. Umbridge sat bolt upright, looking around wildly.
\par \lquote Anything wrong, Professor?\rquote  called Madam Pomfrey, poking her head around her office door.
\par \lquote No ... no ...\rquote  said Umbridge, sinking back into her pillows. \lquote No, I must have been dreaming ...\rquote 
\par Hermione and Ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes.
\par \lquote Speaking of centaurs,\rquote  said Hermione, when she had recovered a little, \lquote who\rquote s Divination teacher now? Is Firenze staying?\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s got to,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote the other centaurs won\rquote t take him back, will they?\rquote 
\par \lquote It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach,\rquote  said Ginny.
\par \lquote Bet Dumbledore wishes he could\rquote ve got rid of Trelawney for good,\rquote  said Ron, now munching on his fourteenth Frog. \lquote Mind you, the whole subject\rquote s useless if you ask me, Firenze isn\rquote t a lot better ...\rquote 
\par \lquote How can you say that?\rquote  Hermione demanded. \lquote After we\rquote ve just found out that there }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 real prophecies?\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s heart began to race. He had not told Ron, Hermione or anyone else what the prophecy had contained. Neville had told them it had smashed while Harry was pulling him up the steps in the Death Room and Harry had not yet corrected this impres\-
sion. He was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim, there was no other way ...
\par \lquote It is a pity it broke,\rquote  said Hermione quietly, shaking her head.
\par \lquote Yeah, it is,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Still, at least You-Know-Who never found out what was in it either \endash  where are you going?\rquote  he added, looking both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up.
\par \lquote Er \endash  Hagrid\rquote s,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote You know, he just got back and I promised I\rquote d go down and see him and tell him how you two are.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, all right then,\rquote  said Ron grumpily, looking out of the dor\-mitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond. \lquote Wish we could come.\rquote 
\par \lquote Say hello to him for us!\rquote  called Hermione, as Harry proceeded down the ward. \lquote And ask him what\rquote s happening about ... about his little friend!\rquote 
\par Harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and under\-stood as he left the dormitory.
\par The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday. Everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds, enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by revi\-sion or homework. Harry walked slowly along the deserted cor\-
ridor, peering out of windows as he went; he could see people messing around in the air over the Quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming in the lake, accompanied by the giant squid.
\par He was finding it hard to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not; whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company. He thought he might really go and visit Hagrid, though, a
s he had not talked to him properly since he\rquote d returned ...
\par Harry had just descended the last marble step into the Entrance Hall when Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room. Harry sto
pped dead; so did Malfoy and the others. The only sounds were the shouts, laughter and splashes drifting into the Hall from the grounds through the open front doors.
\par Malfoy glanced around \endash  Harry knew he was checking for signs of teachers \endash  then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice, \lquote You\rquote re dead, Potter.\rquote 
\par Harry raised his eyebrows.
\par \lquote Funny,\rquote  he said, \lquote you\rquote d think I\rquote d have stopped walking around ...\rquote 
\par Malfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him; he felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale, pointed face contorted with rage.
\par \lquote You\rquote re going to pay,\rquote  said Malfoy, in a voice barely louder than a whisper. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote I\rquote m}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148  going to make you pay for what you\rquote ve done to my father ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote m terrified now,\rquote  said Harry sarcastically. \lquote I s\rquote pose Lord Voldemort\rquote s just a warm-up act compared to you three \endash  what\rquote s the matter?\rquote 
 he added, for Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name. \lquote He\rquote s a mate of your dad, isn\rquote t he? Not scared of him, are you?\rquote 
\par \lquote You think you\rquote re such a big man, Potter,\rquote  said Malfoy, advancing now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him. \lquote You wait. I\rquote ll have you. You can\rquote t land my father in prison \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I thought I just had,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote The Dementors have left Azkaban,\rquote  said Malfoy quietly. \lquote Dad and the others\rquote ll be out in no time ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I expect they will,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Still, at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now \endash \rquote 
\par Malfoy\rquote s hand flew towards his wand, but Harry was too quick for him; he had drawn his own wand before Malfoy\rquote s fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes.
\par \lquote Potter!\rquote 
\par The voice rang across the Entrance Hall. Snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to his office and at the sight of him Harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt towards Malfoy ... wha
tever Dumbledore said, he would never forgive Snape ... never ...
\par \lquote What are you doing, Potter?\rquote  said Snape, as coldly as ever, as he strode over to the four of them.
\par \lquote I\rquote m trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,\rquote  said Harry fiercely.
\par Snape stared at him.
\par \lquote Put that wand away at once,\rquote  he said curtly. \lquote Ten points from Gryff\emdash \rquote 
\par Snape looked towards the giant hour-glasses on the walls and gave a sneering smile.
\par \lquote Ah. I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hour-glass to take away. In that case, Potter, we will simply have to \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Add some more?\rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone steps into the castle; she was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her other, but otherwise looked quite well.
\par \lquote Professor McGonagall!\rquote  said Snape, striding forwards. \lquote Out of St Mungo\rquote s, I see!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Professor Snape,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, shrugging off her travelling cloak, \lquote I\rquote m quite as good as new. You two \endash  Crabbe \endash  Goyle \endash \rquote 
\par She beckoned them forwards imperiously and they came, shuf\-fling their large feet and looking awkward.
\par \lquote Here,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, thrusting her carpetbag into Crabbe\rquote s chest and her cloak into Goyle\rquote s, \lquote take these up to my office for me.\rquote 
\par They turned and stumped away up the marble staircase.
\par \lquote Right then,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, looking up at the hour\-glasses on the wall. \lquote Well, I think Potter and his friends ought to ha
ve fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of You-Know-Who! What say you, Professor Snape?\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  snapped Snape, though Harry knew he had heard per\-fectly well. \lquote Oh \endash  well \endash  I suppose ...\rquote 
\par \lquote So that\rquote s fifty each for Potter, the two Weasleys, Longbottom and Miss Granger,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor\rquote s hour-glass as she spoke. \lquote Oh \endash 
 and fifty for Miss Lovegood, I suppose,\rquote  she added, and a number of sapphires fell into Ravenclaw\rquote s glass. \lquote Now, you wanted to take ten from Mr Potter, I think, Professor Snape \endash  so there we are ...\rquote 
\par A few rubies retreated into the upper bulb, leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless.
\par \lquote Well, Potter, Malfoy, I think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this,\rquote  Professor McGonagall continued briskly.
\par Harry did not need telling twice; he thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at Snape and Malfoy.
\par The hot sun hit him with a blast as he walked across the lawns towards Hagrid\rquote s cabin. Students lying around on the grass sun\-bathing, talking, reading the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
Sunday Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and eating sweets, looked up at him as he passed; some called out to him, or else waved, clearly eager to show that they, like the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Prophet, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
had decided he was something of a hero. Harry said nothing to any of them. He had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago, but he had so far avoided being questioned and pre\-ferred to keep it that way.
\par He thought at first when he knocked on Hagrid\rquote 
s cabin door that he was out, but then Fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome. Hagrid, it transpired, was picking runner beans in his back garden.
\par \lquote All righ\rquote , Harry!\rquote  he said, beaming, when Harry approached the fence. \lquote Come in, come in, we\rquote ll have a cup o\rquote  dandelion juice ...
\par \lquote How\rquote s things?\rquote  Hagrid asked him, as they settled down at his wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice. \lquote Yeh \endash  er \endash  feelin\rquote  all righ\rquote , are yeh?\rquote 
\par Harry knew from the look of concern on Hagrid\rquote s face that he was not referring to Harry\rquote s physical well-being.
\par \lquote I\rquote m fine,\rquote  Harry said quickly, because he could not bear to dis\-cuss the thing that he knew was in Hagrid\rquote s mind. \lquote So, where\rquote ve you been?\rquote 
\par \lquote Bin hidin\rquote  out in the mountains,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Up in a cave, like Sirius did when he \endash \rquote 
\par Hagrid broke off, cleared his throat gruffly, looked at Harry, and took a long draught of juice.
\par \lquote Anyway, back now,\rquote  he said feebly.
\par \lquote You \endash  you look better,\rquote  said Harry, who was determined to keep the conversation moving away from Sirius.
\par \lquote Wha\rquote ?\rquote  said Hagrid, raising a massive hand and feeling his face. \lquote Oh \endash  oh yeah. Well, Grawpy\rquote s loads better behaved now, loads. Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back, ter tell yeh the truth. He\rquote 
s a good lad, really ... I\rquote ve bin thinkin\rquote  abou\rquote  tryin\rquote  ter find him a lady friend, actually ...\rquote 
\par Harry would normally have tried to persuade Hagrid out of this idea at once; the prospect of a second giant taking up reside
nce in the Forest, possibly even wilder and more brutal than Grawp, was positively alarming, but somehow Harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the point. He was starting to wish he was alone again, and with the idea of hastening his departu
re he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice, half-emptying his glass.
\par \lquote Ev\rquote ryone knows yeh\rquote ve bin tellin\rquote  the truth now, Harry,\rquote  said Hagrid softly and unexpectedly. Tha\rquote s gotta be better, hasn\rquote  it?\rquote 
\par Harry shrugged.
\par \lquote Look ...\rquote  Hagrid leaned towards him across the table, \lquote I knew Sirius longer \rquote n yeh did ... he died in battle, an\rquote  tha\rquote s the way he\rquote d\rquote ve wanted ter go \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He didn\rquote t want to go at all!\rquote  said Harry angrily.
\par Hagrid bowed his great shaggy head.
\par \lquote Nah, I don\rquote  reckon he did,\rquote  he said quietly. \lquote But still, Harry ... he was never one ter sit aroun\rquote  at home an\rquote  let other people do the fightin\rquote . He couldn\rquote ve lived with himself if he hadn\rquote 
 gone ter help \endash \rquote 
\par Harry leapt up.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing,\rquote  he said mechanically.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Hagrid, looking rather upset. \lquote Oh ... all righ\rquote  then, Harry ... take care o\rquote  yerself then, an\rquote  drop back in if yeh\rquote ve got a mo ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... right ...\rquote 
\par Harry crossed to the door as fast as he could and pulled it op
en; he was out in the sunshine again before Hagrid had finished saying goodbye, and walking away across the lawn. Once again, people called out to him as he passed. He closed his eyes for a few moments, wishing they would all vanish, that he could open hi
s eyes and find himself alone in the grounds ...
\par A few days ago, before his exams had finished and he had seen the vision Voldemort had planted in his mind, he would have given almost anything for the wizarding world to know he had been telling the truth, f
or them to believe that Voldemort was back, and to know that he was neither a liar nor mad. Now, however ...
\par He walked a short way around the lake, sat down on its bank, sheltered from the gaze of passers-by behind a tangle of shrubs, and stared out over the gleaming water, thinking ...
\par Perhaps the reason he wanted to be alone was because he had felt isolated from everybody since his talk with Dumbledore. An invisible barrier separated him from the rest of the world. He was \endash  he had always been \endash  a marked m
an. It was just that he had never really understood what that meant ...
\par And yet sitting here on the edge of the lake, with the terrible weight of grief dragging at him, with the loss of Sirius so raw and fresh inside, he could not muster any great sense of
 fear. It was sunny, and the grounds around him were full of laughing people, and even though he felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race, it was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include, or end in, m
urder ...
\par He sat there for a long time, gazing out at the water, trying not to think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here, on the opposite bank, that Sirius had once col\-lapsed trying to fend off a hundred Dementors ...
\par The sun had set before he realised he was cold. He got up and returned to the castle, wiping his face on his sleeve as he went.

Ron and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term. Hermione kept showing signs of wanting to talk about Sirius, but Ron tended to make \lquote hushing\rquote 
 noises every time she mentioned his name. Harry was still not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet; his wishes varied with his mood. He knew one thing, though: unhappy as h
e felt at the moment, he would greatly miss Hogwarts in a few days\rquote 
 time when he was back at number four, Privet Drive. Even though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer, he did not feel any better about it. Indeed, he had never dreaded his return more.
\par Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term. It seemed she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortu\-nately for her, she met Peeves on the way, who
 seized his last chance to do as Fred had instructed, and chased her gleefully from the premises whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk. Many students ran out into the Entrance Hall to watch her running away down the path a
n
d the Heads of Houses tried only half-heartedly to restrain them. Indeed, Professor McGonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after Umb
ridge herself, because Peeves had borrowed her walking stick.
\par Their last evening at school arrived; most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the end-of-term leaving feast, but Harry had not even started.
\par \lquote Just do it tomorrow!\rquote  said Ron, who was waiting by the door of their dormitory. \lquote Come on, I\rquote m starving.\rquote 
\par \lquote I won\rquote t be long ... look, you go ahead ...\rquote 
\par But when the dormitory door closed behind Ron, Harry made no effort to speed up his packing. The very last thing he wanted to do was 
to attend the Leaving Feast. He was worried that Dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech. He was sure to mention Voldemort\rquote s return; he had talked to them about it last year, after all ...
\par Harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very 
bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and, as he did so, noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it. He could not think what it was doing there. He bent down, pulled it out from underneath his trainers and examined it.
\par He realised what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of number twelve Grimmauld Place. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote

\par Harry sank down on to his bed and unwrapped the package. Out fell a small, square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him.
\par He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scrib\-bled note from Sirius.

He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory was quite empty. He looked back at the mirror, raised it in front of his face with trembling hands and said, loudly and clearly, \lquote Sirius.\rquote 
\par His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even closer, excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own.
\par He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly through the room:
\par \lquote Sirius Black!\rquote 
\par Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was still, definitely, his own ...

\par Harry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered. He had been convinced, for a whole, shining minute, that he was going to see Sirius, talk to him again ...
\par Disappointment was burning in his throat; he got up and began throwing his things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror \endash 
\par But then an idea struck him ... a better idea than a mirror ... a much bigger, more important idea ... how had he never thought of it before \endash  why had he never asked?
\par He was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase, hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing; he hurtled
 across the empty common room, through the portrait hole and off along the corridor, ignoring the Fat Lady, who called after him: \lquote The feast is about to start, you know, you\rquote re cutting it very fine!\rquote 
\par But Harry had no intention of going to the feast ...
\par How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you didn\rquote t need one, yet now ...
\par He ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead. They were all, clearly, in the Great Hall. Outside his Charms classroom he came to a halt, panting and thinking dis\-
consolately that he would have to wait until later, until after the end of the feast ...
\par But just as he had given up hope, he saw it \endash  a translucent some\-body drifting across the end of the corridor.
\par \lquote Hey \endash  hey, Nick! NICK!\rquote 
\par The ghost stuck its head back out of the wall, revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington.
\par \lquote Good evening,\rquote  he said, withdrawing the rest of his body from the solid stone and smiling at Harry. \lquote I am not the only one who is late, then? Though,\rquote  he sighed, \lquote in a rather different sense, of course ...\rquote 

\par \lquote Nick, can I ask you something?\rquote 
\par A most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nick\rquote s face as he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck 
and tugged it a little straighter, apparently to give himself thinking time. He desisted only when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely.
\par \lquote Er \endash  now, Harry?\rquote  said Nick, looking discomfited. \lquote Can\rquote t it wait until after the feast?\rquote 
\par \lquote No \endash  Nick \endash  please,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote I really need to talk to you. Can we go in here?\rquote 
\par Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Headless Nick sighed.
\par \lquote Oh, very well,\rquote  he said, looking resigned. \lquote I can\rquote t pretend I haven\rquote t been expecting it.\rquote 
\par Harry was holding the door open for him, but he drifted through the wall instead.
\par \lquote Expecting what?\rquote  Harry asked, as he closed the door.
\par \lquote You to come and find me,\rquote  said Nick, now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds. \lquote It happens, sometimes ... when somebody has suffered a ... loss.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Harry, refusing to be deflected. \lquote You were right, I\rquote ve \endash  I\rquote ve come to find you.\rquote 
\par Nick said nothing.
\par \lquote It\rquote s \endash \rquote  said Harry, who was finding this more awkward than he had anticipated, \lquote it\rquote s just \endash  you\rquote re dead. But you\rquote re still here, aren\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par Nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  Harry urged him. \lquote You died, but I\rquote m talking to you ... you can walk around Hogwarts and everything, can\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Nearly Headless Nick quietly, \lquote I walk and talk, yes.\rquote 
\par \lquote So, you came back, didn\rquote t you?\rquote  said Harry urgently. \lquote People can come back, right? As ghosts. They don\rquote t have to disappear completely. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Well?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 he added impatiently, when Nick continued to say nothing.
\par Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, \lquote Not everyone can come back as a ghost.\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean?\rquote  said Harry quickly.
\par \lquote Only ... only wizards.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Harry, and he almost laughed with relief. \lquote Well, that\rquote s OK then, the person I\rquote m asking about is a wizard. So he can come back, right?\rquote 
\par Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry.
\par \lquote He won\rquote t come back.\rquote 
\par \lquote Who?\rquote 
\par \lquote Sirius Black,\rquote  said Nick.
\par \lquote But you did!\rquote  said Harry angrily. \lquote You came back \endash  you\rquote re dead and you didn\rquote t disappear \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod,\rquote  said Nick miser\-ably. \lquote But very few wizards choose that path.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why not?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Anyway \endash  it doesn\rquote t matter \endash  Sirius won\rquote t care if it\rquote s unusual, he\rquote ll come back, I know he will!\rquote 
\par And so strong was his belief, Harry actually turned his head to check the door, sure, for a split second, that he was going to see Sirius, pearly-white and transparent but beaming, walking through it towards him.
\par \lquote He will not come back,\rquote  repeated Nick. \lquote He will have ... gone on.\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean, \'93gone on\'94?\rquote  said Harry quickly. \lquote Gone on where? Listen \endash  what happens when you die, anyway? Where do you go? Why doesn\rquote t everyone come back? Why isn\rquote t this place full of ghosts? Why 
\endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote I cannot answer,\rquote  said Nick.
\par \lquote You\rquote re dead, aren\rquote t you?\rquote  said Harry exasperatedly. \lquote Who can answer better than you?\rquote 
\par \lquote I was afraid of death,\rquote  said Nick softly. \lquote I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn\rquote t to have ... well, that is neither here nor there ... in fact, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 I}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148  am neither here nor there ...\rquote  He gave a small sad chuckle. \lquote 
I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry, for I chose my feeble imitation of life instead. I believe learned wizards study the matter in the Department of Mysteries \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t talk to me about that place!\rquote  said Harry fiercely.
\par \lquote I am sorry not to have been more help,\rquote  said Nick gently. \lquote Well ... well, do excuse me ... the feast, you know ...\rquote 
\par And he left the room, leaving Harry there alone, gazing blankly at the wall through which Nick had disappeared.
\par Harry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once more. He walked slowly and miserably back u
p through the empty castle, wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again.
\par He had turned the corner towards the Fat Lady\rquote s corridor when he saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall. A second glance showed him it was Luna. There w
ere no good hiding places nearby, she was bound to have heard his footsteps, and in any case, Harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment.
\par \lquote Hello,\rquote  said Luna vaguely, glancing around at him as she stepped back from the notice.
\par \lquote How come you\rquote re not at the feast?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote ve lost most of my possessions,\rquote  said Luna serenely. \lquote People take them and hide them, you know. But as it\rquote s the last night, I really do need them back, so I\rquote ve been putting up signs.\rquote 
\par She gestured towards the noticeboard, upon which, sure enough, she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes, with a plea for their return.
\par An odd feeling rose in Harry; an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled him since Sirius\rquote s death. It was a few moments before he realised that he was feeling sorry for Luna.
\par \lquote How come people hide your stuff?\rquote  he asked her, frowning.
\par \lquote Oh ... well ...\rquote  she shrugged. \lquote I think they think I\rquote m a bit odd, you know. Some people call me \'93Loony\'94 Lovegood, actually.\rquote 
\par Harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully.
\par \lquote That\rquote s no reason for them to take your things,\rquote  he said flatly. \lquote D\rquote you want help finding them?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, no,\rquote  she said, smiling at him. \lquote They\rquote ll come back, they always do in the end. It was just that I wanted to pack tonight. Anyway ... why aren\rquote t }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 at the feast?\rquote 
\par Harry shrugged. \lquote Just didn\rquote t feel like it.\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Luna, observing him with those oddly misty, protu\-berant eyes. \lquote I don\rquote t suppose you do. That man the Death Eaters killed was your godfather, wasn\rquote t he? Ginny told me.\rquote 
\par Harry nodded curtly, but found that for some reason he did not mind Luna talking about Sirius. He had just remembered that she, too, could see Thestrals.
\par \lquote Have you ...\rquote  he began. \lquote I mean, who ... has anyone you known ever died?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Luna simply, \lquote my mother. She was a quite extraordi\-nary witch, you know, but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day. I was nine.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry,\rquote  Harry mumbled.
\par \lquote Yes, it was rather horrible,\rquote  said Luna conversationally. \lquote I still feel very sad about it sometimes. But I\rquote ve still got Dad. And anyway, it\rquote s not as though I\rquote ll never see Mum again, is it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  isn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Harry uncertainly.
\par She shook her head in disbelief.
\par \lquote Oh, come on. You heard them, just behind the veil, didn\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote You mean ...\rquote 
\par \lquote In that room with the archway. They were just lurking out of sight, that\rquote s all. You heard them.\rquote 
\par They looked at each other. Luna was smiling slightly. Harry did not know what to say, or to think; Luna believed so many extraor\-dinary things ... yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil, too.
\par \lquote Are you sure you don\rquote t want me to help you look for your stuff?\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote Oh, no,\rquote  said Luna. \lquote No, I think I\rquote ll just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up ... it always does in the end ... well, have a nice holiday, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... yeah, you too.\rquote 
\par She walked away from him and, as he watched her go, he found that the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly.

The journey home on the Hogwarts Express next day was eventful in several ways. Firstly, Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle, who had clearly been waiting al
l week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses, attempted to ambush Harry halfway down the train as he made his way back from the toilet. The attack might have suc\-
ceeded had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of DA members, who saw what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to Harry\rquote 
s aid. By the time Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein and Terry Boot h
ad finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry had taught them, Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniform as Harry, Ernie and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and lef
t them there to ooze.

s face when he gets off the train,\rquote  said Ernie, with some satisfaction, as he watched Malfoy squirm above him. Ernie had never quite got over the indignity of Malfoy docking po
ints from Hufflepuff during his brief spell as a member of the Inquisitorial Squad.
\par \lquote Goyle\rquote s mum\rquote ll be really pleased, though,\rquote  said Ron, who had come to investigate the source of the commotion. \lquote He\rquote s loads better-looking now ... anyway, Harry, the food trolley\rquote 
s just stopped if you want anything ...\rquote 
\par Harry thanked the others and accompanied Ron back to their compartment, where he bought a large pile of cauldron cakes and pumpkin pasties. Hermione was reading the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 again, Ginny was doing a quiz in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Quibbler }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 and Neville was stroking his }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Mimbulus mimbletonia, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched.
\par Harry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while Hermione read out snippets from the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Prophet. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
It was now full of articles about how to repel Dementors, attempts by the Ministry to track down Death Eaters and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very morning ...
\par \lquote It hasn\rquote t really started yet,\rquote  sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up the newspaper again. \lquote But it won\rquote t be long now ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Hey, Harry,\rquote  said Ron softly, nodding towards the glass window on to the corridor.
\par Harry looked around. Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. His and Cho\rquote 
s eyes met for a moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by Ron\rquote s knight.
\par \lquote What\rquote s \endash  er \endash  going on with you and her, anyway?\rquote  Ron asked quietly.
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  said Harry truthfully.
\par \lquote I \endash  er \endash  heard she\rquote s going out with someone else now,\rquote  said Hermione tentatively.
\par Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all. Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him; so much of what he had wanted before Sirius\rquote 
s death felt that way these days ... the week that had elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer; it stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in it, and the one without.
\par \lquote You\rquote re well out of it, mate,\rquote  said Ron forcefully. \lquote I mean, she\rquote s quite good-looking and all that, but you want someone a bit more cheerful.\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s probably cheerful enough with someone else,\rquote  said Harry, shrugging.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s she with now, anyway?\rquote  Ron asked Hermione, but it was Ginny who answered.
\par \lquote Michael Corner,\rquote  she said.
\par \lquote Michael \endash  but \endash \rquote  said Ron, craning around in his seat to stare at her. \lquote But you were going out with him!\rquote 
\par \lquote Not any more,\rquote  said Ginny resolutely. \lquote He didn\rquote t like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch, and got really sulky, so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead.\rquote 
 She scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill, turned }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Quibbler }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 
upside-down and began marking her answers. Ron looked highly delighted.
\par \lquote Well, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot,\rquote  he said, prod\-ding his queen forwards towards Harry\rquote s quivering castle. \lquote Good for you. Just choose someone \endash  better \endash  next time.\rquote 
\par He cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he said it.
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote ve chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he\rquote s better?\rquote  asked Ginny vaguely.
\par \lquote WHAT?\rquote  shouted Ron, upending the chessboard: Crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twit\-tered and hooted angrily from overhead.
\par As the train slowed down in the approach to King\rquote s Cross, Harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less. He even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off, but remained stubbornly sitting
 there until the first of September, when it would take him back to Hogwarts. When it finally puffed to a standstill, however, he lifted down Hedwig\rquote s cage and prepared to drag his trunk from the train as usual.
\par When the ticket inspector signalled to Harry, Ron and Hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between plat\-
forms nine and ten, however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side: a group of people standing there to greet him who he had not expected at all.
\par There was Ma
d-Eye Moody, looking quite as sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done without it, his gnarled hands clutching a long staff, his body wrapped in a voluminous travelling cloak. Tonks stood just behind him, her brig
ht bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass of the station ceiling, wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 The Weird Sisters. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 Next to Tonks was Lupin, his face pale, his hair greyi
ng, a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers. At the front of the group stood Mr and Mrs Weasley, dressed in their Muggle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new jackets in some lurid green, scaly material.

\par \lquote Ron, Ginny!\rquote  called Mrs Weasley, hurrying forwards and hug\-ging her children tightly. \lquote Oh, and Harry dear \endash  how are you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Fine,\rquote  lied Harry, as she pulled him into a tight embrace. Over her shoulder he saw Ron goggling at the twins\rquote  new clothes.
\par \lquote What are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 they }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 supposed to be?\rquote  he asked, pointing at the jackets.

\par \lquote Finest dragonskin, little bro\rquote ,\rquote  said Fred, giving his zip a little tweak. \lquote Business is booming and we thought we\rquote d treat ourselves.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hello, Harry,\rquote  said Lupin, as Mrs Weasley let go of Harry and turned to greet Hermione.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I didn\rquote t expect ... what are you all doing here?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Lupin with a slight smile, \lquote we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home.\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno if that\rquote s a good idea,\rquote  said Harry at once.
\par \lquote Oh, I think it is,\rquote  growled Moody, who had limped a little closer. \lquote That\rquote ll be them, will it, Potter?\rquote 
\par He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder; his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his 
bowler hat. Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad-Eye was pointing and there, sure enough, were the three Dursleys, who looked positively appalled to see Harry\rquote s reception committee.
\par \lquote Ah, Harry!\rquote  said Mr Weasley, turning from Hermione\rquote s parents, who he had just greeted enthusiastically, and who were now taking it in turns to hug Hermione. \lquote Well \endash  shall we do it, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I reckon so, Arthur,\rquote  said Moody.
\par He and Mr Weasley took the lead across the station towards the Dursleys, who were apparently rooted to the floor. Hermione dis\-engaged herself gently from her mother to join the group.
\par \lquote Good afternoon,\rquote  said Mr Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon as he came to a halt right in front of him. \lquote You might remember me, my name\rquote s Arthur Weasley.\rquote 
\par As Mr Weasley had single-handedly demolished most of the Dursleys\rquote 
 living room two years previously, Harry would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him. Sure enough, Uncle Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr Weasle
y, but chose not to say anything, partly, perhaps, because the Dursleys were outnumbered two to one. Aunt Petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed; she kept glancing around, as though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company. Dudley
, meanwhile, seemed to be trying to look small and insignif\-icant, a feat at which he was failing extravagantly.
\par \lquote We thought we\rquote d just have a few words with you about Harry,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, still smiling.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  growled Moody. \lquote About how he\rquote s treated when he\rquote s at your place.\rquote 
\par Uncle Vernon\rquote s moustache seemed to bristle with indignation. Possibly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression that he was dealing with a kindred spirit, he addressed himself to Moody.
\par \lquote I am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I expect what you\rquote re not aware of would fill several books, Dursley,\rquote  growled Moody.
\par \lquote Anyway, that\rquote s not the point,\rquote  interjected Tonks, whose pink hair seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together, for she closed her eyes rather than look at her. \lquote The point is, if we find out you\rquote 
ve been horrible to Harry \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  And make no mistake, we\rquote ll hear about it,\rquote  added Lupin pleasantly.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, \lquote even if you won\rquote t let Harry use the felly\-tone \endash \rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 \lquote Telephone,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid11862148 whispered Hermione.
\par \lquote \endash  Yeah, if we get any hint that Potter\rquote s been mistreated in any way, you\rquote ll have us to answer to,\rquote  said Moody.
\par Uncle Vernon swelled ominously. His sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs.
\par \lquote Are you threatening me, sir?\rquote  he said, so loudly that passers-by actually turned to stare.
\par \lquote Yes, I am,\rquote  said Mad-Eye, who seemed rather pleased that Uncle Vernon had grasped this fact so quickly.
\par \lquote And do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated?\rquote  barked Uncle Vernon.
\par \lquote Well ...\rquote  said Moody, pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his sinisterly revolving magical eye. Uncle Vernon leapt backwards in horror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley. \lquote Yes, I\rquote d have to say you do, Dursley.
\rquote 
\par He turned from Uncle Vernon to Harry.
\par \lquote So, Potter ... give us a shout if you need us. If we don\rquote t hear from you for three days in a row, we\rquote ll send someone along ...\rquote 
\par Aunt Petunia whimpered piteously. It could not have been plainer that she was thinking of what the neighbours would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path.
\par \lquote Bye, then, Potter,\rquote  said Moody, grasping Harry\rquote s shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand.
\par \lquote Take care, Harry,\rquote  said Lupin quietly. \lquote Keep in touch.\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, we\rquote ll have you away from there as soon as we can,\rquote  Mrs Weasley whispered, hugging him again.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll see you soon, mate,\rquote  said Ron anxiously, shaking Harry\rquote s hand.
\par \lquote Really soon, Harry,\rquote  said Hermione earnestly. \lquote We promise.\rquote 
\par Harry
 nodded. He somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him, to see them all ranged there, on his side. Instead, he smiled, raised a hand in farewell, turned around and led the way out of the station towards the sunlit street, with Uncle Ve
rnon, Aunt Petunia and Dudley hurrying along in his wake.
