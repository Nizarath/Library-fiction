It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting alone in his office, reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of mean\-
ing behind. He was waiting for a call from the president of a far-distant co
untry, and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long, tiring and difficult week, there was not much space in his head for any\-
thing else. The more he attempted to focus 
on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents. This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had
 happened in the last week (as though anyone needed remind\-ing) but also to explain why each and every one of them was the government\rquote s fault.

s pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations, for they were neither fair nor true
. How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was less than ten years old, and the best experts were at a loss to expla
i
n why it had snapped cleanly in two, sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below. And how dared anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and well-publicised murders? Or that the government s
hould have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country that had caused so much damage to both people and property? And was it }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 his}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699  fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert Chorley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be spend\-ing a lot more time with his family?
\par \lquote A grim mood has gripped the country,\rquote  the opponent had concluded, barely concealing his own broad grin.
\par And unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime Minister felt it himself; people really did seem more miser\-able than usual. Even the weather was dismal; all this chilly mist in the middle of July ... it wasn\rquote t right, it wasn\rquote 
t normal ...
\par He turned over the second page of the memo, saw how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad job. Stretch\-ing his arms above his head he looked around his office mournfully. It was a handsome room, with a fine marble fire\-
place facing the long sash windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable chill. With a slight shiver, the Prime Minister got up and
 moved over to the windows, looking out at the thin mist that was pressing itself against the glass. It was then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he heard a soft cough behind him.
\par He froze, nose-to-nose with his own scared-looking reflec\-tion in the dark glass. He knew that cough. He had heard it before. He turned, very slowly, to face the empty room.
\par \lquote Hello?\rquote  he said, trying to sound braver than he felt.
\par For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him. However, a voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement. It was coming \endash 
 as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough \endash  from the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small and dirty oil-painting in the far corner of the room.
\par \lquote To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. Kindly respond immediately. Sincerely, Fudge.\rquote  The man in the paint\-ing looked enquiringly at the Prime Minister.
\par \lquote Er,\rquote  said the Prime Minister, \lquote listen ... it\rquote s not a very good time for me ... I\rquote m waiting for a telephone call, you see ... from the president of \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That can be rearranged,\rquote  said the portrait at once. The Prime Minister\rquote s heart sank. He had been afraid of that.
\par \lquote But I really was rather hoping to speak \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We shall arrange for the president to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead,\rquote  said the little man. \lquote Kindly respond immediately to Mr Fudge.\rquote 
\par \lquote I ... oh ... very well,\rquote  said the Prime Minister weakly. \lquote Yes, I\rquote ll see Fudge.\rquote 
\par He hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as he went. He had barely resumed his seat, and arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression, when bright green flames burst into life in the empty grate beneat
h his marble mantelpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast as a top. Seconds later, he had climbed out on to a rather fine antique rug, brushing ash from the slee
ves of his long pinstriped cloak, a lime-green bowler hat in his hand.
\par \lquote Ah ... Prime Minister,\rquote  said Cornelius Fudge, striding forwards with his hand outstretched. \lquote Good to see you again.\rquote 
\par The Prime Minister could not honestly return this compli\-ment, so sa
id nothing at all. He was not remotely pleased to see Fudge, whose occasional appearances, apart from being down-right alarming in themselves, generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news. Furthermore, Fudge was looking distinctly careworn
. He was thinner, balder and greyer, and his face had a crumpled look. The Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in politicians before, and it never boded well.
\par \lquote How can I help you?\rquote  he said, shaking Fudge\rquote s hand very briefly and gesturing towards the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk.
\par \lquote Difficult to know where to begin,\rquote  muttered Fudge, pulling up the chair, sitting down and placing his green bowler upon his knees. \lquote What a week, what a week ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Had a bad one too, have you?\rquote  asked the Prime Minister stiffly, hoping to convey by this that he had quite enough on his plate already without any extra helpings from Fudge.
\par \lquote Yes, of course,\rquote  said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the Prime Minister. \lquote I\rquote ve been having the same week 
you have, Prime Minister. The Brockdale bridge ... the Bones and Vance murders ... not to mention the ruckus in the West Country ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You \endash  er \endash  your \endash  I mean to say, some of your people were \endash  were involved in those \endash  those things, were they?\rquote 
\par Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look.
\par \lquote Of course they were,\rquote  he said. \lquote Surely you\rquote ve realised what\rquote s going on?\rquote 
\par \lquote I ...\rquote  hesitated the Prime Minister.
\par It was precisely this sort of behaviour that made him dislike Fudge\rquote s visits so much. He was, aft
er all, the Prime Minister, and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy. But of course, it had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister. He remembered it as though it were y
esterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day.
\par He had been standing alone in this very office, savouring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to
 find that ugly little portrait talking to him, announcing that the Minister for Magic was about to arrive and introduce himself.
\par Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad. He had been utterly 
terrified to find a portrait talking to him, though this had been nothing to how he had felt when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained speechless throughout Fudge\rquote 
s kindly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret all over the world, and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole wizarding community and pre\-
vented the non-magical population fro
m getting wind of them. It was, said Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control (the Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this
 point). Fudge had then patted the shoulder of the still-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way.
\par \lquote Not to worry,\rquote  he had said, \lquote it\rquote s odds on you\rquote ll never see me again. I\rquote ll only bother you if there\rquote s something really ser\-ious going on our end, something that\rquote s likely to affect the Muggles 
\endash  the non-magical population, I should say. Other\-wise it\rquote s live and let live. And I must say, you\rquote re taking it a lot better than your predecessor. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 He }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 tried to throw me out of the window, thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition.\rquote 
\par At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last.
\par \lquote You\rquote re \endash  you\rquote re }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 a hoax, then?\rquote 
\par It had been his last, desperate hope.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Fudge gently. \lquote No, I\rquote m afraid I\rquote m not. Look.\rquote 
\par And he had turned the Prime Minister\rquote s teacup into a gerbil.
\par \lquote But,\rquote  said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech, \lquote but why \endash  why has nobody told me \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Minister for Magic only reveals him or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,\rquote  said Fudge, poking his wand back inside his jacket. \lquote We find it the best way to main\-tain secrecy.\rquote 
\par \lquote But then,\rquote  bleated the Prime Minister, \lquote why hasn\rquote t a former Prime Minister warned me \endash ?\rquote 
\par At this, Fudge had actually laughed.
\par \lquote My dear Prime Minister, are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 ever going to tell anybody?\rquote 
\par Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames and vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime Minister had sto
od there, quite motionless, and realised that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?
\par The shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a time he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his gruel\-
ling election campaign. In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his Private Sec\-
retary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had announced Fudge\rquote s arrival. To the Prime Minister\rquote s dis\-may, however, the portrait had proved impossible to remove. When several carpenters, a builder or two, an art 
historian and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried unsuccess\-
fully to prise it from the wall, the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office
. Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. 
However, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened.
\par Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace, sopping wet and in a state of considerable p
anic. Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was dripping all over the Axminster, Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never heard of, a man named \lquote Serious\rquote 
 Black, something that sounded like Hogwarts and a boy called Harry Potter, none of which made the remotest sense to the Prime Minister.
\par \lquote ... I\rquote ve just come from Azkaban,\rquote  Fudge had panted, tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket. \lquote Middle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flight ... the Dementors are in uproar \endash 
\rquote  he shuddered \lquote \endash  they\rquote ve never had a breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime Minister. Black\rquote s a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin You-Know-Who ... but of course, you don\rquote 
t even know who You-Know-Who is!\rquote  He had gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a moment, then said, \lquote Well, sit down, sit down, I\rquote d better fill you in ... have a whisky ...\rquote 
\par The Prime Minister had rather resented being told to sit down in his own office, let alone offered his ow
n whisky, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge had pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime Minister\rquote s hand and drawn up a chair.
\par Fudge had talked for over an hour. At one point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud, and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Min\-ister\rquote 
s whisky-free hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the Prime Minister had stood up too.
\par \lquote So you think that ...\rquote  he had squinted down at the name in his left hand, \lquote Lord Vol\emdash \rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote He Who Must Not Be Named!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 snarled Fudge.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry ... you think that He Who Must Not Be Named is still alive, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, Dumbledore says he is,\rquote  said Fudge, as he had fast\-ened his pinstriped cloak under his chin, \lquote but we\rquote ve never found him. If you ask me, he\rquote s not dangerous unless he\rquote s got support, so it\rquote 
s Black we ought to be worrying about. You\rquote ll put out that warning, then? Excellent. Well, I hope we don\rquote t see each other again, Prime Minister! Goodnight.\rquote 
\par But they had seen each other again. Less than a year later a harassed-looking Fudge had appeared out of thin air in the Cabinet Room to inform the Prime Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the Kwidditch (or that was what it
 had sounded like) World Cup and that several Muggles had been \lquote involved\rquote , but that the Prime Minister was not to worry, the fact that You-Know-Who\rquote 
s Mark had been seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it was an isolated incident and the Muggle Liaison Office was dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke.
\par \lquote Oh, and I almost forgot,\rquote  Fudge had added. \lquote We\rquote re importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tourna\-ment, quite routine, but the Department for the Regulation and Control 
of Magical Creatures tells me that it\rquote s down in the rulebook that we have to notify you if we\rquote re bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country.\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  what \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 dragons?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 spluttered the Prime Minister.

\par \lquote Yes, three,\rquote  said Fudge. \lquote And a sphinx. Well, good day to you.\rquote 
\par The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it, but no. Less than two years later, Fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again, this time with the news that there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban.
\par \lquote A }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 mass }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 breakout?\rquote  the Prime Minister had repeated hoarsely.
\par \lquote No need to worry, no need to worry!\rquote  Fudge had shouted, already with one foot in the flames. \lquote We\rquote ll have them rounded up in no time \endash  just thought you ought to know!\rquote 
\par And before the Prime Minister had been able to shout, \lquote Now, wait just one moment!\rquote  Fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks.
\par Whatever the press and the opposition might say, the Prime Minister was not a foolish man. It had not escaped his notice that, despite Fudge\rquote s assu
rances at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more flustered with each visit. Little though he liked to think about the Minister for Magic (or, as he always called Fudge in his head, the }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Other }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 M
inister), the Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next time Fudge appeared it would be with graver news still. The sight, therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the fire once more, look\-
ing dishevelled and fretful and sternly surprised that the Prime Minister did not know exactly why he was there, was about the worst thing that had happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week.
\par \lquote How should I know what\rquote s going on in the \endash  er \endash  wizard\-ing community?\rquote  snapped the Prime Minister now. \lquote I have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We have the same concerns,\rquote  Fudge interrupted. \lquote The Brockdale bridge didn\rquote t wear out. That wasn\rquote t really a hurri\-cane. Those murders were not the work of Muggles. And Herbert Chorley\rquote s famil
y would be safer without him. We are currently making arrangements to have him transferred to St Mungo\rquote s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The move should be effected tonight.\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you ... I\rquote m afraid I ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 what?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
 blustered the Prime Minister.
\par Fudge took a great, deep breath and said, \lquote Prime Minister, I am very sorry to have to tell you that he\rquote s back. He Who Must Not Be Named is back.\rquote 
\par \lquote Back? When you say \'93back\'94 ... he\rquote s alive? I mean \endash \rquote 
\par The Prime Minister groped in his memory for the details
 of that horrible conversation of three years previously, when Fudge had told him about the wizard who was feared above all others, the wizard who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier.
\par \lquote Yes, alive,\rquote  said Fudge. \lquote That is \endash  I don\rquote t know \endash  is a man alive if he can\rquote t be killed? I don\rquote t really understand it, and Dumbledore won\rquote t explain properly \endash  but anyway, he\rquote 
s certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for the purposes of our discussion, yes, he\rquote s alive.\rquote 
\par The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well-informed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember of their previous conversations.
\par \lquote Is Serious Black with \endash  er \endash  He Who Must Not Be Named?\rquote 
\par \lquote Black? Black?\rquote  said Fudge distractedly, turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers. \lquote Sirius Black, you mean? Merlin\rquote s beard, no. Black\rquote s dead. Turns out we were \endash  er \endash  mistaken about Blac
k. He was innocent after all. And he wasn\rquote t in league with He Who Must Not Be Named either. I mean,\rquote  he added defen\-sively, spinning the bowler hat still faster, \lquote all the evidence pointed \endash 
 we had more than fifty eye-witnesses \endash  but anyway, as I say, he\rquote s dead. Murdered, as a matter of fact. On Ministry of Magic premises. There\rquote s going to be an inquiry, actually ...\rquote 
\par To his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of pity for Fudge at this point. It was, however, eclipsed almost immediately b
y a glow of smugness at the thought that, deficient though he himself might be in the area of materialising out of fireplaces, there had never been a murder in any of the government departments under }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 his }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 charge ... not yet, anyway ...
\par While the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk, Fudge continued, \lquote But Black\rquote s by-the-by now. The point is, we\rquote re at war, Prime Minister, and steps must be taken.\rquote 
\par \lquote At war?\rquote  repeated the Prime Minister nervously. \lquote Surely that\rquote s a little bit of an overstatement?\rquote 
\par \lquote He Who Must Not Be Named has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January,\rquote  said Fudge, speaking more and more rapidly, and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a lime-green blur. \lquote Since the
y have moved into the open, they have been wreaking havoc. The Brockdale bridge \endash  he did it, Prime Minister, he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Good grief, so it\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 your }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 fault those people were killed and I\rquote 
m having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and I don\rquote t know what else!\rquote  said the Prime Minister furiously.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote My }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 fault!\rquote  said Fudge, colouring up. \lquote 
Are you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe not,\rquote  said the Prime Minister, standing up and striding about the room, \lquote but I would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity!\rquote 
\par \lquote Do you really think I wasn\rquote t already making every effort?\rquote  demanded Fudge heatedly. \lquote Every Auror in the Ministry was \endash  and is \endash 
 trying to find him and round up his followers, but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wiz\-ards of all time, a wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades!\rquote 
\par \lquote So I suppose you\rquote re going to tell me he caused the hurri\-cane in the West Country, too?\rquote 
 said the Prime Minister, his temper rising with every pace he took. It was infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public; almost worse than it being the government\rquote s fault after all.

\par \lquote That was no hurricane,\rquote  said Fudge miserably.
\par \lquote Excuse me!\rquote  barked the Prime Minister, now positively stamping up and down. \lquote Trees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It was the Death Eaters,\rquote  said Fudge. \lquote He Who Must Not Be Named\rquote s followers. And ... and we suspect giant involvement.\rquote 
\par The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote What }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 involvement?\rquote 
\par Fudge grimaced. \lquote He used giants last time, when he wanted to go for the grand effect. The Office of Misinformation has been working round the clock, we\rquote 
ve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened, we\rquote ve got most of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset, but we can\rquote 
t find the giant \endash  it\rquote s been a disaster.\rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t say!\rquote  said the Prime Minister furiously.
\par \lquote I won\rquote t deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry,\rquote  said Fudge. \lquote What with all that, and then losing Amelia Bones.\rquote 
\par \lquote Losing who?\rquote 
\par \lquote Amelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. We think He Who Must Not Be Named may have murdered her in person, because she was a very gifted witch and \endash  and all the evidence was that she put up a real fight.\rquote 

\par Fudge cleared his throat and, with an effort, it seemed, stopped spinning his bowler hat.
\par \lquote But that murder was in the newspapers,\rquote  said the Prime Minister, momentarily diverted from his anger. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Our }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 news\-papers. Amelia Bones ... it just said she was a middle-aged woman who lived alone. It was a \endash  a nasty killing, wasn\rquote t it? It\rquote 
s had rather a lot of publicity. The police are baffled, you see.\rquote 
\par Fudge sighed. \lquote Well, of course they are. Killed in a room that was locked from the inside, wasn\rquote t she? We, on the other hand, know exactly who did it, not that that gets us any fur\-
ther towards catching him. And then there was Emmeline Vance, maybe you didn\rquote t hear about that one \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yes I did!\rquote  said the Prime Minister. \lquote It happened just round the corner from here, as a matter of fact. The papers had a field day with it: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
Breakdown of law and order in the Prime Minister\rquote s back yard \endash \rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote And as if all that wasn\rquote t enough,\rquote  said Fudge, barely listen\-ing to the Prime Minister, \lquote we\rquote ve got Dementors swarming all over the place, attacking people left right and centre ...\rquote 
\par Once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible to the Prime Minister, but he was wiser now.
\par \lquote I thought Dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban?\rquote  he said cautiously.
\par \lquote They did,\rquote  said Fudge wearily. \lquote But not any more. They\rquote ve deserted the prison and joined He Who Must Not Be Named. I won\rquote t pretend that wasn\rquote t a blow.\rquote 
\par \lquote But,\rquote  said the Prime Minister, with a sense of dawning horror, \lquote didn\rquote t you tell me they\rquote re the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s right. And they\rquote re breeding. That\rquote s what\rquote s causing all this mist.\rquote 
\par The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the nearest chair. The idea of invisible creatures swooping through the towns and countryside, spreading despair and hopelessness in his voters, made him feel quite faint.
\par \lquote Now see here, Fudge \endash  you\rquote ve got to do something! It\rquote s your responsibility as Minister for Magic!\rquote 
\par \lquote My dear Prime Minister, you can\rquote t honestly think I\rquote m still Minister for Magic after all this? I was sacked three days ago! The whole wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. I\rquote 
ve never known them so united in my whole term of office!\rquote  said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile.
\par The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words. Des\-pite his indignation at the position into which he had been placed, he still rather felt for the shrunken-looking man sitting opposite him.
\par \lquote I\rquote m very sorry,\rquote  he said finally. \lquote If there\rquote s anything I can do?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is nothing. I was sent here tonight to bring you up-to-date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor. I rather thought he\rquote d be here by now, but of course he\rquote 
s very busy at the moment, with so much going on.\rquote 
\par Fudge looked round at the portrait of the ugly little man wearing the long curly silver wig, who was digging in his ear with the point of a quill.
\par Catching Fudge\rquote s eye the portrait said, \lquote He\rquote ll be here in a moment, he\rquote s just finishing a letter to Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote I wish him luck,\rquote  said Fudge, sounding bitter for the first time. \lquote I\rquote ve been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight, but he won\rquote t budge. If he\rquote 
d just been prepared to persuade the boy, I might still be ... well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more success.\rquote 
\par Fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence, but it was broken almost immediately by the portrait, which suddenly spoke in its crisp, official voice.
\par \lquote To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a meeting. Urgent. Kindly respond immediately. Rufus Scrimgeour, Minister for Magic.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, yes, fine,\rquote  said the Prime Minister distractedly, a
nd he barely flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald-green again, rose up and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him moments later on to the antique rug. Fudge got to his feet, and after a moment\rquote 
s hesitation the Prime Minister did the same, watching the new arrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes and look around.
\par The Prime Minister\rquote s first, foolish thought was that Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion. There were streaks of grey in his mane of t
awny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minis
ter thought he understood why the wizarding community pre\-ferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangerous times.
\par \lquote How do you do?\rquote  said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his hand.
\par Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then pulled out a wand from under his robes.
\par \lquote Fudge told you everything?\rquote  he asked, striding over to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand. The Prime Minister heard the lock click.
\par \lquote Er \endash  yes,\rquote  said the Prime Minister. \lquote And if you don\rquote t mind, I\rquote d rather that door remained unlocked.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote d rather not be interrupted,\rquote  said Scrimgeour shortly, \lquote or watched,\rquote  he added, pointing his wand at the windows so that the curtains swept across them. \lquote Right, well, I\rquote m a busy man, so let\rquote 
s get down to business. First of all, we need to discuss your security.\rquote 
\par The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied, \lquote I am perfectly happy with the security I\rquote ve already got, thank you very \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Well, we\rquote re not,\rquote  Scrimgeour cut in. \lquote It\rquote ll be a poor lookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse. The new secretary in your outer office \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that\rquote s what you\rquote re suggesting!\rquote  said the Prime Minister hotly. \lquote He\rquote s highly efficient, gets through twice the work the rest of them \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s because he\rquote s a wizard,\rquote  said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of a smile. \lquote A highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for your protection.\rquote 
\par \lquote Now, wait a moment!\rquote  declared the Prime Minister. \lquote You can\rquote t just put your people into my office, I decide who works for me \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?\rquote  said Scrim\-geour coldly.
\par \lquote I am \endash  that\rquote s to say, I was \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Then there\rquote s no problem, is there?\rquote  said Scrimgeour.
\par \lquote I ... well, as long as Shacklebolt\rquote s work continues to be ... er ... excellent,\rquote  said the Prime Minister lamely, but Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him.
\par \lquote Now, about Herbert Chorley \endash  your Junior Minister,\rquote  he continued. \lquote The one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck.\rquote 
\par \lquote What about him?\rquote  asked the Prime Minister.
\par \lquote He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse,\rquote  said Scrimgeour. \lquote It\rquote s addled his brains, but he could still be dangerous.\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s only quacking!\rquote  said the Prime Minister weakly. \lquote Surely a bit of a rest ... maybe go easy on the drink ...\rquote 
\par \lquote A team of Healers from St Mungo\rquote s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries is examining him as we speak. So far he has attempted to strangle three of them,\rquote  said Scrimgeour. \lquote I think it best tha
t we remove him from Muggle society for a while.\rquote 
\par \lquote I ... well ... he\rquote ll be all right, won\rquote t he?\rquote  said the Prime Minister anxiously. Scrimgeour merely shrugged, already moving back towards the fireplace.
\par \lquote Well, that\rquote s really all I had to say. I will keep you posted of developments, Prime Minister \endash 
 or, at least, I shall probably be too busy to come personally, in which case I shall send Fudge here. He has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity.\rquote 
\par Fudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he merely
 looked as though he had toothache. Scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for the mysterious powder that turned the fire green. The Prime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them for a moment, then the words he had fought to suppress all eve
ning burst from him at last.

\par With a second and louder }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 pop, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 another hooded figure materialised.
\par \lquote Wait!\rquote 
\par The harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth. It leapt from its hiding place and up the bank. There was a flash of green light, a yelp, and the fox fell back to the ground, dead.
\par The second figure turned over the animal with its toe.
\par \lquote Just a fox,\rquote  said a woman\rquote s voice dismissively from under the hood. \lquote I thought perhaps an Auror \endash  Cissy, wait!\rquote 
\par But her quarry, who had paused and looked back at the flash of light, was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down.
\par \lquote Cissy \endash  Narcissa \endash  listen to me \endash \rquote 
\par The second woman caught the first and seized her arm, but the other wrenched it away.
\par \lquote Go back, Bella!\rquote 
\par \lquote You must listen to me!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve listened already. I\rquote ve made my decision. Leave me alone!\rquote 
\par The woman called Narcissa gained the top of the bank, where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow cobbled street. The other woman, Bella, followed at once. Side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows a
nd rows of dilapidated brick houses, their windows dull and blind in the darkness.
\par \lquote He lives here?\rquote  asked Bella in a voice of contempt. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Here? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699

\par Bella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw Narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second, almost identical street. Some 
of the streetlamps were broken; the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness. The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner, this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her round so that t
hey faced each other.
\par \lquote Cissy, you must not do this, you can\rquote t trust him \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote The Dark Lord trusts him, doesn\rquote t he?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Dark Lord is ... I believe ... mistaken,\rquote  Bella panted, and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone. \lquote 
In any case, we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone. This is a betrayal of the Dark Lord\rquote s \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Let go, Bella!\rquote  snarled Narcissa and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak, holding it threateningly in the other\rquote s face. Bella merely laughed.
\par \lquote Cissy, your own sister? You wouldn\rquote t \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote There is nothing I wouldn\rquote t do any more!\rquote  Narcissa breathed, a note of hysteria in her voice, and as she brought down the wand like a knife, there was another flash of light. Bella let go of her sister\rquote s arm as though burned.

\par But Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, her pursuer followed again, keeping her distance now, as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses. At last Narcissa hurried up a street called Spinner\rquote 
s End, over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger. Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows, until she reached the very last house, where a dim light glimmered through th
e curtains in a downstairs room.
\par She had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing under her breath, had caught up. Together they stood waiting, pant\-ing slightly, breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze. Afte
r a few seconds, they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack. A sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them, a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes.
\par Narcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness; the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person.
\par \lquote Narcissa!\rquote  said the man, opening the door a little wider, so that the light fell upon her and her sister too. \lquote What a pleas\-ant surprise!\rquote 
\par \lquote Severus,\rquote  she said in a strained whisper. \lquote May I speak to you? It\rquote s urgent.\rquote 
\par \lquote But of course.\rquote 
\par He stood back to allow her to pass him into the house. Her still-hooded sister followed without invitation.
\par \lquote Snape,\rquote  she said curtly as she passed him.
\par \lquote Bellatrix,\rquote  he replied, his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them.
\par They had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room, which had the feeling of a dark padded cell. The walls were com\-
pletely covered in books, most of them bound in old black or brown leather; a threadbare sofa, an old armchair and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp hung from the ceiling. The place had an air of ne
glect, as though it were not usually inhabited.
\par Snape gestured Narcissa to the sofa. She threw off her cloak, cast it aside and sat down, staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap. Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly. Dark as her sister
 was fair, with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw, she did not take her gaze from Snape as she moved to stand behind Narcissa.
\par \lquote So, what can I do for you?\rquote  Snape asked, settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters.
\par \lquote We ... we are alone, aren\rquote t we?\rquote  Narcissa asked quietly.
\par \lquote Yes, of course. Well, Wormtail\rquote s here, but we\rquote re not count\-ing vermin, are we?\rquote 
\par He pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and, with a bang, a hidden door flew open, revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen.
\par \lquote As you have clearly realised, Wormtail, we have guests,\rquote  said Snape lazily.
\par The man crept hunchbacked down the last few steps and moved into the room. He had small, watery eyes, a pointed nose and wore an unpleasant simper. His left hand was caress\-ing his right, which looked as though it were encased in a bright silver glove.

\par \lquote Narcissa!\rquote  he said, in a squeaky voice, \lquote and Bellatrix! How charming \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Wormtail will get us drinks, if you\rquote d like them,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote And then he will return to his bedroom.\rquote 
\par Wormtail winced as though Snape had thrown something at him.
\par \lquote I am not your servant!\rquote  he squeaked, avoiding Snape\rquote s eye.
\par \lquote Really? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed you here to assist me.\rquote 
\par \lquote To assist, yes \endash  but not to make you drinks and \endash  and clean your house!\rquote 
\par \lquote I had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more dan\-gerous assignments,\rquote  said Snape silkily. \lquote This can be easily arranged: I shall speak to the Dark Lord \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I can speak to him myself if I want to!\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course you can,\rquote  said Snape, sneering. \lquote But in the mean\-time, bring us drinks. Some of the elf-made wine will do.\rquote 
\par Wormtail hesitated for a moment, looking as though he might argue, but then turned and headed through a second hidden door. They heard banging, and a
 clinking of glasses. Within seconds he was back, bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray. He dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence, slamming the book-covered door behind him.
\par Snape poured out three glasses of blo
od-red wine and handed two of them to the sisters. Narcissa murmured a word of thanks, whilst Bellatrix said nothing, but continued to glower at Snape. This did not seem to discompose him; on the contrary, he looked rather amused.
\par \lquote The Dark Lord,\rquote  he said, raising his glass and draining it.
\par The sisters copied him. Snape refilled their glasses.
\par As Narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush, \lquote Severus, I\rquote m sorry to come here like this, but I had to see you. I think you are the only one who can help me \endash \rquote 
\par Snape held up a hand to stop her, then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door. There was a loud bang and a squeal, followed by the sound of Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs.
\par \lquote My apologies,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote He has lately taken to listening at doors, I don\rquote t know what he means by it ... you were saying, Narcissa?\rquote 
\par She took a great, shuddering breath and started again.
\par \lquote Severus, I know I ought not to be here, I have been told to say nothing to anyone, but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Then you ought to hold your tongue!\rquote  snarled Bellatrix. \lquote Particularly in present company!\rquote 
\par \lquote \'93Present company\'94?\rquote  repeated Snape sardonically. \lquote And what am I to understand by that, Bellatrix?\rquote 
\par \lquote That I don\rquote t trust you, Snape, as you very well know!\rquote 
\par Narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands. Snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again, his hands upon the arms of his chair, smiling into Bellatrix\rquote s glowering face.
\par \lquote Narcissa, I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is burst\-ing to say; it will save tedious interruptions. Well, continue, Bellatrix,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote Why is it that you do not trust me?\rquote 
\par \lquote A hundred reasons!\rquote  she said loudly, striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table. \lquote 
Where to start! Where were you when the Dark Lord fell? Why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished? What have you been doing all these years that you\rquote ve lived in Dumbledore\rquote s pocket? Why did you stop the Dark Lord pro\-
curing the Philosopher\rquote 
s Stone? Why did you not return at once when the Dark Lord was reborn? Where were you a few weeks ago, when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the Dark Lord? And why, Snape, is Harry Potter still alive, when you have had him at your 
mercy for five years?\rquote 
\par She paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the colour high in her cheeks. Behind her Narcissa sat motionless, her face still hidden in her hands.
\par Snape smiled.
\par \lquote Before I answer you \endash  oh, yes, Bellatrix, I am going to answer! Y
ou can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back, and carry false tales of my treachery to the Dark Lord! Before I answer you, I say, let me ask a question in turn. Do you really think that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every 
one of those questions? And do you really think that, had I not been able to give satisfactory answers, I would be sitting here talking to you?\rquote 
\par She hesitated.
\par \lquote I know he believes you, but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You think he is mistaken? Or that I have somehow hood\-winked him? Fooled the Dark Lord, the greatest wizard, the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever seen?\rquote 
\par Bellatrix said nothing, but looked, for the first time, a little discomfited. Snape did not press the point. He picked up his drink again, sipped it, and continued, \lquote 
You ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell. I was where he had ordered me to be, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, because he wished me to spy upon Albus Dumbledore. You know, I presume, that it was on the Dark Lord\rquote s orders tha
t I took up the post?\rquote 
\par She nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth, but Snape forestalled her.
\par \lquote You ask why I did not attempt to find him when he van\-ished. For the same reason that Avery, Yaxley, the Carrows, Greyback, Lucius,\rquote  he inclined his head slightly to Narcissa, \lquote 
and many others did not attempt to find him. I believed him finished. I am not proud of it, I was wrong, but there it is ... if he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time, he would have very few followers left.\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote d have me!\rquote  said Bellatrix passionately. \lquote I, who spent many years in Azkaban for him!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, indeed, most admirable,\rquote  said Snape in a bored voice. \lquote Of course, you weren\rquote t a lot of use to him in prison, but the gesture was undoubtedly fine \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Gesture!\rquote  she shrieked; in her fury she looked slightly mad. \lquote While I endured the Dementors, you remained at Hogwarts, comfortably playing Dumbledore\rquote s pet!\rquote 
\par \lquote Not quite,\rquote  said Snape calmly. \lquote He wouldn\rquote t give me the Defence Against the Dark Arts job, you know. Seemed to think it might, ah, bring about a relapse ... tempt me into my old ways.\rquote 
\par \lquote This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord, not to teach your favourite subject?\rquote  she jeered. \lquote Why did you stay there all that time, Snape? Still spying on Dumbledore for a master you believed dead?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hardly,\rquote  said Snape, \lquote 
although the Dark Lord is pleased that I never deserted my post: I had sixteen years of information on Dumbledore to give him when he returned, a rather more useful welcome-back present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban is ...\rquote 

\par \lquote But you stayed \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Bellatrix, I stayed,\rquote  said Snape, betraying a hint of impatience for the first time. \lquote I had a comfortable job that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban. They were rounding up the Death Eaters, you know. Dumbledore\rquote 
s protection kept me out of jail, it was most convenient and I used it. I repeat: the Dark Lord does not complain that I stayed, so I do not see why you do.
\par \lquote I think you next wanted to know,\rquote  he pressed on, a little more loudly, for Bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting, \lquote why I stood between the Dark Lord and the Philosopher\rquote 
s Stone. That is easily answered. He did not know whether he could trust me. He thought, like you, that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to Dumbledore\rquote s stooge. He was in a piti\-
able condition, very weak, sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. He did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry. I deeply regret that he did not trust me. He would have retur
ned to power three years sooner. As it was, I saw only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the Stone and, I admit, I did all I could to thwart him.\rquote 
\par Bellatrix\rquote s mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine.
\par \lquote But you didn\rquote t return when he came back, you didn\rquote t fly back to him at once when you felt the Dark Mark burn \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Correct. I returned two hours later. I returned on Dumble\-dore\rquote s orders.\rquote 
\par \lquote On Dumbledore\rquote s \endash ?\rquote  she began, in tones of outrage.
\par \lquote Think!\rquote  said Snape, impatient again. \lquote Think! By waiting two hours, just two hours, I ensured that I could remain at Hogwarts as a spy! By allowing Dumbledore to think that I was only returning to the Dark Lord\rquote 
s side because I was ordered to, I have been able to pass information on
 Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix ever since! Consider, Bellatrix: the Dark Mark had been growing stronger for months, I knew he must be about to return, all the Death Eaters knew! I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted to do, to plan my
 next move, to escape like Karkaroff, didn\rquote t I?
\par \lquote The Dark Lord\rquote s initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely, I assure you, when I explained that I remained faith\-
ful, although Dumbledore thought I was his man. Yes, the Dark Lord thought that I had left him for ever, but he was wrong.\rquote 
\par \lquote But what use have you been?\rquote  sneered Bellatrix. \lquote What use\-ful information have we had from you?\rquote 
\par \lquote My information has been conveyed directly to the Dark Lord,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote If he chooses not to share it with you \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He shares everything with me!\rquote  said Bellatrix, firing up at once. \lquote He calls me his most loyal, his most faithful \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Does he?\rquote  said Snape, his voice delicately inflected to sug\-gest his disbelief. \lquote Does he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 still, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 after the fiasco at the Ministry?\rquote 
\par \lquote That was not my fault!\rquote  said Bellatrix, flushing. \lquote The Dark Lord has, in the past, entrusted me with his most precious \endash  if Lucius hadn\rquote t \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you dare \endash  don\rquote t you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 dare }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 blame my husband!
\rquote  said Narcissa, in a low and deadly voice, looking up at her sister.
\par \lquote There is no point apportioning blame,\rquote  said Snape smoothly. \lquote What is done is done.\rquote 
\par \lquote But not by you!\rquote  said Bellatrix furiously. \lquote No, you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers, were you not, Snape?\rquote 
\par \lquote My orders were to remain behind,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote Perhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord, perhaps you think that Dumbledore would not have noticed if I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the Order of the Phoenix? And 
\endash  forgive me \endash  you speak of dangers ... you were facing six teenagers, were you not?\rquote 
\par \lquote They were joined, as you very well know, by half of the Order before long!\rquote  snarled Bellatrix. \lquote And, while we are on the subject of the Order, you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their Headquarters, don\rquote t you?
\rquote 
\par \lquote I am not the Secret Keeper, I cannot speak the name of the place. You understand how the enchantment works, I think? The Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed 
him on the Order. It led, as perhaps you have guessed, to the recent capture and murder of Emmeline Vance, and it certainly helped dispose of Sirius Black, though I give you full credit for finishing him off.\rquote 
\par He inclined his head and toasted her. Her expression did not soften.
\par \lquote You are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry Potter. You could have killed him at any point in the past five years. You have not done it. Why?\rquote 
\par \lquote Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?\rquote  asked Snape.
\par \lquote He ... lately, we ... I am asking }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Snape!\rquote 
\par \lquote If I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could not have used his blood to regenerate, making him invincible \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!\rquote  she jeered.
\par \lquote I do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead. I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived, at least until a year ago ...\rquote 
\par \lquote But why did you keep him alive?\rquote 
\par \lquote Have you not understood me? It was only Dumbledore\rquote s protection that was keeping me out of Azkaban! Do you dis\-
agree that murdering his favourite student might have turned him against me? But there was more to it than that. I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many 
stories circulating about him, rumours that he himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he had sur\-vived the Dark Lord\rquote s attack. Indeed, many of the Dark Lord\rquote 
s old followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more. I was curious, I admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle.
\par \lquote Of course, it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all. He has fought his way out of a number of tight corners b
y a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as obnoxious and self-satisfied as was his father before him. I have done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts, where I believe he scarcely b
elongs, but kill him, or allow him to be killed in front of me? I would have been a fool to risk it, with Dumbledore close at hand.\rquote 
\par \lquote And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never suspected you?\rquote  asked Bellatrix. \lquote He has no idea of your true allegiance, he trusts you implicitly still?\rquote 
\par \lquote I have played my part well,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote And you overlook Dumbledore\rquote s greatest weakness: he has to believe the best of people. I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff, fresh from 
my Death Eater days, and he embraced me with open arms \endash  though, as I say, never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help. Dumbledore has been a great wizard \endash  oh yes, he has\rquote  (for Bellatrix had made a scath\-ing noise) 
\lquote the Dark Lord acknowledge
s it. I am pleased to say, however, that Dumbledore is growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him. He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were. But through all these years, he has never s
topped trust\-ing Severus Snape, and therein lies my great value to the Dark Lord.\rquote 
\par Bellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared unsure how best to attack Snape next. Taking advantage of her silence, Snape turned to her sister.
\par \lquote Now ... you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?\rquote 
\par Narcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with despair.
\par \lquote Yes, Severus. I \endash  I think you are the only one who can help me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in jail and ...\rquote 
\par She closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids.
\par \lquote The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,\rquote  Narcissa continued, her eyes still closed. \lquote He wishes none to know of the plan. It is ... very secret. But \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote If he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,\rquote  said Snape at once. \lquote The Dark Lord\rquote s word is law.\rquote

\par \lquote It so happens that I know of the plan,\rquote  he said in a low voice. \lquote I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. Neverthe\-less, had I not been in on the secret, Narcissa, you would have been guilty of great treachery to the Dark Lord.

\par \lquote Severus,\rquote  she whispered, tears sliding down her pale cheeks. \lquote My son ... my only son ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Draco should be proud,\rquote  said Bellatrix indifferently. \lquote The Dark Lord is granting him a great honour. And I will say this for Draco: he isn\rquote

\par Narcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly all the while at Snape.
\par \lquote That\rquote s because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance for Lucius\rquote s mistake, I know it!\rquote

\par \lquote That\rquote s why he\rquote s chosen Draco, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  she persisted. \lquote To punish Lucius?\rquote 
\par \lquote If Draco succeeds,\rquote  said Snape, still looking away from her, \lquote he will be honoured above all others.\rquote 
\par \lquote But he won\rquote t succeed!\rquote  sobbed Narcissa. \lquote How can he, when the Dark Lord himself \endash ?\rquote 
\par Bellatrix gasped; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve.
\par \lquote I only meant ... that nobody has yet succeeded ... Severus ... please ... you are, you have always been, Draco\rquote s favourite teacher ... you are Lucius\rquote s old friend ... I beg you ... you are the Dark Lord\rquote 
s favourite, his most trusted advisor ... will you speak to him, persuade him \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not stupid enough to attempt it,\rquote  said Snape flatly. \lquote I cannot pre\-
tend that the Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in charge. He got himself captured, along with how many others, and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. Yes, the Dark Lord is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Then I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!\rquote  choked Narcissa. \lquote He does not mean him to succeed, he wants him to be killed trying!\rquote 
\par When Snape said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose what little self-restraint she still possessed. Standing up, she stag\-gered to Snape and seized the front of his robes. Her face close to his, her tears falling on to his chest, she gasped, \lquote

could do it instead of Draco, Severus. You would succeed, of course you would, and he would reward you beyond all of us \endash \rquote 
\par Snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands. Looking down into her tear-stained face, he said slowly, \lquote He intends me to do it in the end, I think. But he is determined that Draco should t
ry first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco succeeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer, fulfilling my useful role as spy.\rquote 
\par \lquote In other words, it doesn\rquote t matter to him if Draco is killed!\rquote 
\par \lquote The Dark Lord is very angry,\rquote  repeated Snape quietly. \lquote He failed to hear the prophecy. You know as well as I do, Narcissa, that he does not forgive easily.\rquote 
\par She crumpled, falling at his feet, sobbing and moaning on the floor.
\par \lquote My only son ... my only son ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You should be proud!\rquote  said Bellatrix ruthlessly. \lquote If I had sons, I would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord!\rquote 
\par Narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair. Snape stooped, seized her by the arms, lifted her up and steered her back on to the sofa. He then poured her more wine and forced the glass into her hand.
\par \lquote Narcissa, that\rquote s enough. Drink this. Listen to me.\rquote 
\par She quietened a little; slopping wine down herself, she took a shaky sip.
\par \lquote It might be possible ... for me to help Draco.\rquote 
\par She sat up, her face paper-white, her eyes huge.
\par \lquote Severus \endash  oh, Severus \endash  you would help him? Would you look after him, see he comes to no harm?\rquote 
\par \lquote I can try.\rquote 
\par She flung away her glass; it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at Snape\rquote s feet, seized his hand in both of hers and pressed her lips to it.
\par \lquote If you are there to protect him ... Severus, will you swear it? Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Unbreakable Vow?\rquote  Snape\rquote s expression was blank, unreadable: Bellatrix, however, let out a cackle of triumphant laughter.
\par \lquote Aren\rquote t you listening, Narcissa? Oh, he\rquote ll try, I\rquote m sure ... the usual empty words, the usual slithering out of action ... oh, on the Dark Lord\rquote s orders, of course!\rquote 
\par Snape did not look at Bellatrix. His black eyes were fixed upon Narcissa\rquote s tear-filled blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand.
\par \lquote Certainly, Narcissa, I shall make the Unbreakable Vow,\rquote  he said quietly. \lquote Perhaps your sister will consent to be our Bonder.\rquote 
\par Bellatrix\rquote s mouth fell open. Snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite Narcissa. Beneath Bellatrix\rquote s aston\-ished gaze, they grasped right hands.
\par \lquote You will need your wand, Bellatrix,\rquote  said Snape coldly.
\par She drew it, still looking astonished.
\par \lquote And you will need to move a little closer,\rquote  he said.
\par She stepped forwards so that she stood over them, and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands.
\par Narcissa spoke.
\par \lquote Will you, Severus, watch over my son Draco as he attempts to fulfil the Dark Lord\rquote s wishes?\rquote 
\par \lquote I will,\rquote  said Snape.
\par A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a red-hot wire.
\par \lquote And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?\rquote 
\par \lquote I will,\rquote  said Snape.
\par A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and inter\-linked with the first, making a fine, glowing chain.
\par \lquote And, should it prove necessary ... if it seems Draco will fail ...\rquote  whispered Narcissa (Snape\rquote s hand twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), \lquote will you carry out the deed that the Dark
 Lord has ordered Draco to perform?\rquote 
\par There was a moment\rquote s silence. Bellatrix watched, her wand upon their clasped hands, her eyes wide.

Harry Potter was snoring loudly. He had been sitting in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of four hours, staring out at the darkening street, and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold window-pane, h
i
s glasses askew and his mouth wide open. The misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside, and the artificial light drained his face of all colour so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy 
black hair.

The room was strewn with various possessions and a good smattering of rubbish. Owl feathers, apple cores and sweet wrappers littered the floor, a number of spellbooks lay higgledy-piggledy among the tangled robes on his bed, and a mess of newspa

Though Ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place, a growing number of the wizarding community believe that the Death Eaters now serving sentences in Azkaban for trespass a
nd attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy. The nature of that prophecy is unknown, although speculation is rife that it concerns Harry Potter, the only person ever known to have sur\-
vived the Killing Curse, and who is also known to have been at the Ministry on the night in question. Some are going so far as to call Potter the \lquote Chosen One\rquote

Harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so, making his glasses still more l
opsided, but he did not wake up. An alarm clock, repaired by Harry several years ago, ticked loudly on the sill, showing one minute to eleven. Beside it, held in place by Harry\rquote 
s relaxed hand, was a piece of parchment covered in thin, slanting writing. Harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that, although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll, it now lay quite flat.

ugh he already knew it by heart, Harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven o\rquote 
clock that evening, when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive. He knew it was pointless to keep rereading Dumbledore\rquote s words; Harry had sent back his \lquote yes
\rquote  with the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could do now was wait: either Dumbledore was going to come, or he was not.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 But Harry had not packed. It just se
emed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the Dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company. He could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong \endash  his reply to Dumbledore\rquote 
s letter might have gone astray; Dumbledor
e could be prevented from collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or joke or trap. Harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again. The only gesture he had made to 
the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage.
\par The minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve, and at that precise moment, the streetlamp outside the window went out.
\par Harry awoke as though the sudden darkne
ss was an alarm. Hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass, he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement. A tall figure in a long, billowing cloak was walking up the garden path.
\par Harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock, knocked over his chair, and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk. Even as he lobbed a set of robes, two spell\-
books and a packet of crisps across the room, the doorbell rang.
\par Downstairs in the living room his Uncle Vernon shouted, \lquote Who the blazes is calling at this time of night?\rquote 
\par Harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other. He had completely forgotten to
 warn the Dursleys that Dumbledore might be coming. Feeling both panicky and close to laughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say, \lquote 
Good evening. You must be Mr Dursley. I daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for him?\rquote 
\par Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm\rquote s reach of his uncle whenever possible. There in the doorway stood a ta
ll, thin man with waist-length silver hair and beard. Half-moon spec\-tacles were perched on his crooked nose and he was wearing a long black travelling cloak and a pointed hat. Vernon Dursley, whose moustache was quite as bushy as Dumbledore\rquote 
s, though black, and who was wearing a puce dressing-gown, was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes.
\par \lquote Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
warn you that I was coming,\rquote  said Dumbledore pleasantly. \lquote However, let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house. It is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times.\rquote 
\par He stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him.
\par \lquote It is a long time since my last visit,\rquote  said Dumbledore, peer\-ing down his crooked nose at Uncle Vernon. \lquote I must say, your agapanthuses are flourishing.\rquote 
\par Vernon Dursley said nothing at all. Harry did not doubt that speech would return to him, and soon \endash  the vein pulsing in his uncle\rquote s temple was reaching danger point \endash  but some\-thing about Dumbledore seemed to have robbed him tempor\-
arily of breath. It might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance, but it might, too, have been that even Uncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully.
\par \lquote Ah, good evening, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore, looking up at him through his half-moon glasses with a most satisfied expression. \lquote Excellent, excellent.\rquote 
\par These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was clear that as far as he was concerned, any man who could look at Harry and say \lquote excellent\rquote  was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t mean to be rude \endash \rquote  he began, in a tone that threat\-ened rudeness in every syllable.
\par \lquote \endash  yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often,\rquote  Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely. \lquote Best to say noth\-ing at all, my dear man. Ah, and this must be Petunia.\rquote 
\par The kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harry\rquote s aunt, wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress, clearly ha
lfway through her usual pre-bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces. Her rather horsy face registered nothing but shock.
\par \lquote Albus Dumbledore,\rquote  said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction. \lquote We have corresponded, of course.\rquote  Harry
 thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term. \lquote And this must be your son Dudley?\rquote 
\par Dudley had that moment peered round the living-room door. His large, blond he
ad rising out of the stripy collar of his pyjamas looked oddly disembodied, his mouth gaping in astonishment and fear. Dumbledore waited a moment or two, apparently to see whether any of the Dursleys were going to say anything, but as the silence stretche
d on he smiled.
\par \lquote Shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room?\rquote 
\par Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him. Harry, still clutching the telescope and trainers, jumped the last few stairs and followed Dumbledore, who had settl
ed himself in the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings with an expression of benign interest. He looked quite extraordinarily out of place.
\par \lquote Aren\rquote t \endash  aren\rquote t we leaving, sir?\rquote  Harry asked anxiously.
\par \lquote Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to discuss first,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote And I would prefer not to do so in the open. We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncle\rquote s hospitality only a little longer.\rquote 

\par \lquote You will, will you?\rquote 
\par Vernon Dursley had entered the room, Petunia at his shoulder and Dudley skulking behind them both.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore simply, \lquote I shall.\rquote 
\par He drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it; with a casual flick, the sofa zoomed forwards and knocked the knees out from under all three of the Dursleys s
o that they collapsed upon it in a heap. Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position.
\par \lquote We may as well be comfortable,\rquote  said Dumbledore pleasantly.
\par As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shrivelled; it looked as though his flesh had been burned away.
\par \lquote Sir \endash  what happened to your \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Later, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Please sit down.\rquote 
\par Harry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to look at the Dursleys, who seemed stunned into silence.
\par \lquote I would assume that you were going to offer me refresh\-ment,\rquote  Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, \lquote but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.\rquote 
\par A third twitch of the wand and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honey-coloured liquid into each of the glasses, which then floated to each person in the room.
\par \lquote Madam Rosmerta\rquote s finest, oak-matured mead,\rquote  said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, 
who caught hold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely. The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at each other, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gent
ly on the sides of their heads. Harry could not sup\-press a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself.
\par \lquote Well, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore, turning towards him, \lquote a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us. By us, I mean the Order of the Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you that Sirius\rquote 
s will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned.\rquote 
\par Over on the sofa, Uncle Vernon\rquote s head turned, but Harry did not look at him, nor could he think of anything to say except, \lquote Oh. Right.\rquote 
\par \lquote This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,\rquote  Dumbledore went on. \lquote You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts and you inherit all of Sirius\rquote 
s personal possessions. The slightly problematic part of the legacy \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote His godfather\rquote s dead?\rquote  said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa. Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look at him. The glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernon\rquote s head; he attempted to beat it away. 
\lquote He\rquote s dead? His godfather?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not confided in the Dursleys. \lquote Our problem,\rquote  he continued to Harry, as if there had been no interruption, \lquote 
is that Sirius also left you number twelve, Grimmauld Place.\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s been left a house?\rquote  said Uncle Vernon greedily, his small eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him.
\par \lquote You can keep using it as Headquarters,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I don\rquote t care. You can have it, I don\rquote t really want it.\rquote 
 Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help it. He thought he would be haunted for ever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to l
eave.
\par \lquote That is generous,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote We have, however, vacated the building temporarily.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of Uncle Vernon, who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead, \lquote Black 
family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line, to the next male with the name of Black. Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were childless. While his will makes it perfec
tly plain that he wants you to have the house, it is nevertheless pos\-sible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pure-blood.\rquote 
\par A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Sirius\rquote s mother that hung in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Harry\rquote s mind. \lquote I bet there has,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote Quite,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote And if such an enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius\rquote s living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange.\rquote 
\par Without realising what he was doing, Harry sprang to his feet; the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor. Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius\rquote s killer, inherit his house?
\par \lquote No,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote Well, obviously we would prefer that she didn\rquote t get it, either,\rquote  said Dumbledore calmly. \lquote 
The situation is fraught with complications. We do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it, for example, making it unplottable, will hold now that ownership has passed from Sirius\rquote 
s hands. It might be that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment. Naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position.\rquote 
\par \lquote But how are you going to find out if I\rquote m allowed to own it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Fortunately,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote there is a simple test.\rquote 
\par He placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair, but before he could do anything else, Uncle Vernon shouted, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote 
Will you get these ruddy things off us?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par Harry looked round; all three of the Dursleys were cower\-ing with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls, the contents flying everywhere.
\par \lquote Oh, I\rquote m so sorry,\rquote  said Dumbledore politely, and he raised his wand again. All three glasses vanished. \lquote But it would have been better manners to drink it, you know.\rquote 
\par It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts, but he merely shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing, keeping his small piggy eyes on Dumbledore\rquote s wand.
\par \lquote You see,\rquote  Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, \lquote if you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited \endash \rquote 
\par He flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 crack }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
and a house-elf appeared, with a snout for a nose, giant bat\rquote s ears and enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching on the Dursleys\rquote  shagpile carpet and covered in grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hair-raising shriek: no
thing this filthy had entered her house in living memory; Dudley drew his large bare pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head, as though he thought the creature might run up his pyjama trousers, and Uncle Vernon bellowed, 
\lquote What the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 hell }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 is that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Kreacher,\rquote  finished Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Kreacher won\rquote t, Kreacher won\rquote t, Kreacher won\rquote t!\rquote  croaked the house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon, stamping his long gnarled feet and pulling his ears. \lquote Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh, ye
s, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher won\rquote t go to the Potter brat, Kreacher won\rquote t, won\rquote t, won\rquote t \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote As you can see, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacher\rquote s continued croaks of \lquote won\rquote t, won\rquote t, won\rquote t\rquote , \lquote Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.\rquote 

\par \lquote I don\rquote t care,\rquote  said Harry again, looking with disgust at the writhing, stamping house-elf. \lquote I don\rquote t want him.\rquote

\par Harry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange, but the idea of owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed Sirius, was repugnant.
\par \lquote Give him an order,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote If he has passed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress.\rquote

\par Kreacher\rquote s voice had risen to a scream. Harry could think of nothing to say, except, \lquote Kreacher, shut up!\rquote 
\par It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke. He grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furi\-
ously, his eyes bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face forwards on to the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.
\par \lquote Well, that simplifies matters,\rquote  said Dumbledore cheerfully. \lquote It seems that Sirius knew what he was doing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place, and of Kreacher.\rquote 
\par \lquote Do I \endash  do I have to keep him with me?\rquote  Harry asked, aghast, as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet.
\par \lquote Not if you don\rquote t want to,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote If I might make a suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye on him.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry in relief, \lquote yeah, I\rquote ll do that. Er \endash  Kreacher \endash  I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other house-elves.\rquote 
\par Kreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air, gave Harry one upside-down look of deep\-est loathing and, with another loud }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 crack, }{

\par \lquote Good,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote There is also the matter of the Hippogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry at once, \lquote he can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak would prefer that.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hagrid will be delighted,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling. \lquote He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeak\rquote s safety, to 
rechristen him Witherwings for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the Hippogriff they once sen\-tenced to death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?\rquote 
\par \lquote Erm ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Doubtful that I would turn up?\rquote  Dumbledore suggested shrewdly.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll just go and \endash  er \endash  finish off,\rquote  said Harry hastily, hurry\-ing to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers.
\par It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed; at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from unde
r the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of Colour-Change Ink and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron. Then, heaving his trunk in one hand and holding Hedwig\rquote s cage in the other, he made his way back downstairs.
\par He was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was not waiting in the hall, which meant that he had to return to the living room.
\par Nobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard and Harry did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said, \lquote Professor \endash  I\rquote m ready now.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Just one last thing, then.\rquote  And he turned to speak to the Dursleys once more. \lquote As you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in a year\rquote s time \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time since Dumbledore\rquote s arrival.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry?\rquote  said Dumbledore politely.
\par \lquote No, he doesn\rquote t. He\rquote s a month younger than Dudley, and Dudders doesn\rquote t turn eighteen until the year after next.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  said Dumbledore pleasantly, \lquote but in the wizarding world, we come of age at seventeen.\rquote 
\par Uncle Vernon muttered \lquote preposterous\rquote , but Dumbledore ignored him.
\par \lquote Now, as you already know, the wizard called Lord Voldemort has returned to this country. The wizarding community is currently in a state o
f open warfare. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even greater danger now than the day when I left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter explaining about his parents\rquote 
 murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore paused, and although his voice remained light and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer together.
\par \lquote You did not do as I asked. You have never treated Harry as a son. He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have in
flicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.\rquote 
\par Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinctively, as though expecting to see someone other than Dudley squeezed between them.
\par \lquote Us \endash  mistreat Dudders? What d\rquote you \endash ?\rquote  began Uncle Vernon furiously, but Dumbledore raised his finger for silence, a silence which fell as though he had struck Uncle Vernon dumb.
\par \lquote The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house home. However miserable 
he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. This magic will cease to operate the moment that Harry turns seventeen; in other words, the moment he becomes a man. I ask only this: that yo
u allow Harry to return, once more, to this house, before his seventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the protection continues until that time.\rquote 
\par None of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was frowning slightly, as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated. Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat; Aunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed.

\par \lquote Well, Harry ... time for us to be off,\rquote  said Dumbledore at last, standing up and straightening his long black cloak. \lquote Until we meet again,\rquote 
 he said to the Dursleys, who looked as though that moment could wait for ever as far as they were con\-cerned, and after doffing his hat, he swept from the room.
\par \lquote Bye,\rquote  said Harry hastily to the Dursleys, and followed Dumbledore, who paused beside Harry\rquote s trunk, upon which Hedwig\rquote s cage was perched.
\par \lquote We do not want to be encumbered by these just now,\rquote  he said, pulling out his wand again. \lquote I shall send them to The Burrow to await us there. However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak ... just in case.\rquote 
\par Harry extracted his Cloak from his trunk with some dif\-ficulty, trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within. When he had stuffed it into an insid
e pocket of his jacket, Dumbledore waved his wand and the trunk, cage and Hedwig vanished. Dumbledore then waved his wand again and the front door opened on to cool, misty darkness.
\par \lquote And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.\rquote

Despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that Dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him, Harry felt distinctly awkward as they set off down Pri
vet Drive together. He had never had a proper conversation with his headmaster outside Hogwarts before; there was usually a desk between them. The memory of their last face-to-face encounter kept intruding, too, and it rather heightened Harry\rquote 
s sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that occasion, not to mention doing his best to smash several of Dumbledore\rquote s most prized possessions.

\par \lquote Keep your wand at the ready, Harry,\rquote  he said brightly.
\par \lquote But I thought I\rquote m not allowed to use magic outside school, sir?\rquote 
\par \lquote If there is an attack,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote I give you permis\-sion to use any counter-jinx or -curse that might occur to you. However, I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why not, sir?\rquote 
\par \lquote You are with me,\rquote  said Dumbledore simply. \lquote This will do, Harry.\rquote 
\par He came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive.
\par \lquote You have not, of course, passed your Apparition test?\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I thought you had to be seventeen?\rquote 
\par \lquote You do,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote So you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly. My left, if you don\rquote t mind \endash  as you have noticed, my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment.\rquote 
\par Harry gripped Dumbledore\rquote s proffered forearm.
\par \lquote Very good,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Well, here we go.\rquote 
\par Harry felt Dumbledore\rquote s arm twist away from him and re\-doubled his grip: the next thing he knew, everything went black; he was being pressed very hard from all directions; he could not breathe, there were iron bands tightening around his c
hest; his eyeballs were being forced back into his head; his ear\-drums were being pushed deeper into his skull, and then \endash 
\par He gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes. He felt as though he had just been forced through a very ti
ght rubber tube. It was a few seconds before he realised that Privet Drive had vanished. He and Dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square, in the centre of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches. His comprehe
nsion catching up with his senses, Harry realised that he had just Apparated for the first time in his life.
\par \lquote Are you all right?\rquote  asked Dumbledore, looking down at him solicitously. \lquote The sensation does take some getting used to.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m fine,\rquote  said Harry, rubbing his ears, which felt as though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly. \lquote But I think I might prefer brooms.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore smiled, drew his travelling cloak a little more tightly around his neck and said, \lquote This way.\rquote 
\par He set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a few houses. According to a clock on a nearby church, it was almost midnight.
\par \lquote So tell me, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Your scar ... has it been hurting at all?\rquote 
\par Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the lightning-shaped mark.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  he said, \lquote and I\rquote ve been wondering about that. I thought it would be burning all the time now Voldemort\rquote s getting so powerful again.\rquote 
\par He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression.
\par \lquote I, on the other hand, thought otherwise,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Lord Voldemort has finally realised the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying. It appears that he is now employing Occlumency against you.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote m not complaining,\rquote  said Harry, who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into Voldemort\rquote s mind.
\par They turned a corner, passing a telephone box and a bus shelter. Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore again.
\par \lquote Professor?\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  where exactly are we?\rquote 
\par \lquote This, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.\rquote 
\par \lquote And what are we doing here?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, yes, of course, I haven\rquote t told you,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Well, I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent years, but we are, once again, one
 member of staff short. We are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts.\rquote 
\par \lquote How can I help with that, sir?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, I think we\rquote ll find a use for you,\rquote  said Dumbledore vaguely. \lquote Left here, Harry.\rquote 
\par They proceeded
 up a steep, narrow street lined with houses. All the windows were dark. The odd chill that had lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here, too. Thinking of Dementors, Harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his p
ocket.
\par \lquote Professor, why couldn\rquote t we just Apparate directly into your old colleague\rquote s house?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us en
try. In any case, most wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators. At Hogwarts, for instance \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  you can\rquote t Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds,\rquote  said Harry quickly. \lquote Hermione Granger told me.\rquote 
\par \lquote And she is quite right. We turn left again.\rquote 
\par The church clock chimed midnight behind them. Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late, but now that conversation had been established, he had more pressing questions to ask.
\par \lquote Sir, I saw in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 that Fudge has been sacked ...\rquote 

\par \lquote Correct,\rquote  said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep side-street. \lquote He has been replaced, as I am sure you also saw, by Rufus Scrimgeour, who used to be Head of the Auror Office.\rquote 
\par \lquote Is he ... do you think he\rquote s good?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote An interesting question,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote He is able, cer\-tainly. A more decisive and forceful personality than Cornelius.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, but I meant \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action and, having fought Dark wizards for most of his working life, does not underestimate Lord Voldemort.\rquote 
\par Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the Daily }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 had reported, and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject, so he changed it.
\par \lquote And ... sir ... I saw about Madam Bones.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly. \lquote A terrible loss. She was a great witch. Just up here, I think \endash  ouch.\rquote 
\par He had pointed with his injured hand.
\par \lquote Professor, what happened to your \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote I have no time to explain now,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote It is a thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice.\rquote 
\par He smiled at Harry, who understood that he was not being snubbed, and that he had permission to keep asking questions.
\par \lquote Sir \endash  I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about security measures we should all take against the Death Eaters ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I received one myself,\rquote  said Dumbledore, still smiling. \lquote Did you find it useful?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not really.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I thought not. You have not asked me, for instance, what is my favourite flavour of jam, to check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore, and not an impostor.\rquote 
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t ...\rquote  Harry began, not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not.
\par \lquote For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry ... although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to research my own jam-preferences before impersonating myself.\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ... right,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Well, on that leaflet, it said some\-thing about Inferi. What exactly are they? The leaflet wasn\rquote t very clear.\rquote 
\par \lquote They are corpses,\rquote  said Dumbledore calmly. \lquote Dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark wizard\rquote 
s bidding. Inferi have not been seen for a long time, however, not since Voldemort was last powerful ... he killed enough people to make an army of them, of course. This is the place, Harry, just here ...\rquote 
\par They were nearing a small, neat stone house set in its own garden. Harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything else, but as they reached the front gate Dum
bledore stopped dead and Harry walked into him.
\par \lquote Oh dear. Oh dear, dear, dear.\rquote 
\par Harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink. The front door was hanging off its hinges.
\par Dumbledore glanced up and down the street. It seemed quite deserted.
\par \lquote Wand out and follow me, Harry,\rquote  he said quietly.
\par He opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path, Harry at his heels, then pushed the front door very slowly, his wand raised and at the ready.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Lumos.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par Dumbledore\rquote s wand-tip ignited, casting its light up a narrow hallway. To the left, another door stood open. Hold\-ing his illuminated wand aloft, Dumbledore walked into the sitting room with Harry right behind him.
\par A scene of total devastation met their eyes. A grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet, its face cracked, its pendu\-
lum lying a little further away like a dropped sword. A piano was on its side, its keys strewn across the floor. The wreckage of a fallen chandelier glittered nearby. Cushions lay deflat
ed, feathers oozing from slashes in their sides; fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything. Dumbledore raised his wand even higher, so that its light was thrown upon the walls, where something darkly red and glutinous was spat\-
tered over the wallpaper. Harry\rquote s small intake of breath made Dumbledore look round.
\par \lquote Not pretty, is it,\rquote  he said heavily. \lquote Yes, something horrible has happened here.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room, scrutinising the wreckage at his feet. Harry followed, gazing around, half-scared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body.

\par \lquote Maybe there was a fight and \endash  and they dragged him off, Professor?\rquote  Harry suggested, trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spat\-tered halfway up the walls.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think so,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly, peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side.
\par \lquote You mean he\rquote s \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Still here somewhere? Yes.\rquote 
\par And without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair, which yelled, \lquote Ouch!\rquote 
\par \lquote Good evening, Horace,\rquote  said Dumbledore, straightening up again.
\par Harry\rquote s jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been an armchair, there now crouched an enormously fat, bald old man who was massaging his lower belly and squint\-ing up at Dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye.
\par \lquote There was no need to stick the wand in that hard,\rquote  he said gruffly, clambering to his feet. \lquote It hurt.\rquote 
\par The wand-light sparkled on his shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver walrus-like moustache, and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pyjamas. The top of his head b
arely reached Dumbledore\rquote s chin.
\par \lquote What gave it away?\rquote  he grunted as he staggered to his feet, still rubbing his lower belly. He seemed remarkably un\-abashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair.
\par \lquote My dear Horace,\rquote  said Dumbledore, looking amused, \lquote if the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have been set over the house.\rquote 
\par The wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead.
\par \lquote The Dark Mark,\rquote  he muttered. \lquote Knew there was some\-thing ... ah well. Wouldn\rquote t have had time, anyway. I\rquote d only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room.\rquote 
\par He heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his moustache flutter.
\par \lquote Would you like my assistance clearing up?\rquote  asked Dumbledore politely.
\par \lquote Please,\rquote  said the other.
\par They stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the short round one, and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion.
\par The furniture flew back to its original place; ornaments re-formed in midair; feathers zoomed into their cushions; to
rn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns soared on to side tables and reignited; a vast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glitter\-
ing across the room and alighted, whole and untarnished, upon a desk; rips, cracks and holes healed everywhere; and the walls wiped themselves clean.
\par \lquote What kind of blood was that, incidentally?\rquote  asked Dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather clock.
\par \lquote On the walls? Dragon,\rquote  shouted the wizard called Horace as, with a deafening grinding and tinkling, the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling.
\par There was a final }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 plunk }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 from the piano, and silence.
\par \lquote Yes, dragon,\rquote  repeated the wizard conversationally. \lquote My last bottle, and prices are sky-high at the moment. Still, it might be reusable.\rquote 
\par He stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light, examining the thick liquid within.
\par \lquote Hm. Bit dusty.\rquote 
\par He set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed. It was then that his gaze fell upon Harry.
\par \lquote Oho,\rquote  he said, his large round eyes flying to Harry\rquote s fore\-head and the lightning-shaped scar it bore. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Oho!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote This,\rquote  said Dumbledore, moving forwards to make the introduction, \lquote is Harry Potter. Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.\rquote 
\par Slughorn turned on Dumbledore, his expression shrewd.
\par \lquote So that\rquote s how you thought you\rquote d persuade me, is it? Well, the answer\rquote s no, Albus.\rquote 
\par He pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation.
\par \lquote I suppose we can have a drink, at least?\rquote  asked Dumbledore. \lquote For old times\rquote  sake?\rquote 
\par Slughorn hesitated.
\par \lquote All right then, one drink,\rquote  he said ungraciously.
\par Dumbledor
e smiled at Harry and directed him towards a chair not unlike the one that Slughorn had so recently impersonated, which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp. Harry took the seat with the distinct impression that Dumble
dore, for some reason, wanted to keep him as visible as possible. Certainly when Slughorn, who had been busy with decanters and glasses, turned to face the room again, his eyes fell immediately upon Harry.
\par \lquote Humph,\rquote  he said, looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes. \lquote Here \endash \rquote 
 He gave a drink to Dumbledore, who had sat down without invitation, thrust the tray at Harry and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence. His legs were so short that they did not touch the floor.
\par \lquote Well, how have you been keeping, Horace?\rquote  Dumbledore asked.
\par \lquote Not so well,\rquote  said Slughorn at once. \lquote Weak chest. Wheezy. Rheumatism too. Can\rquote t move like I used to. Well, that\rquote s to be expected. Old age. Fatigue.\rquote 
\par \lquote And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote You can\rquote t have had more than three minutes\rquote  warning?\rquote 
\par Slughorn said, half-irritably, half-proudly, \lquote Two. Didn\rquote t hear my Intruder Charm go off, I was taking a bath. Still,\rquote  he added sternly, seeming to pull himself back together again, \lquote the fact remains that I\rquote 
m an old man, Albus. A tired old man who\rquote s earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts.\rquote 
\par He certainly had those, thought Harry, looking around the r
oom. It was stuffy and cluttered, yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich, fussy ol
d lady.
\par \lquote You\rquote re not yet as old as I am, Horace,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Well, maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself,\rquote  said Slughorn bluntly. His pale gooseberry eyes had found Dumbledore\rquote s injured hand. \lquote Reactions not what they were, I see.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re quite right,\rquote  said Dumbledore serenely, shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers; the sight of them made the back of Harry\rquote s neck prickle unpleasantly. \lquote 
I am undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other hand ...\rquote 
\par He shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that age had its compensations, and Harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before: it was large, rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and was set 
with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle. Slughorn\rquote s eyes lingered for a moment on the ring, too, and Harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead.
\par \lquote So, all these precautions against intruders, Horace ... are they for the Death Eaters\rquote  benefit, or mine?\rquote  asked Dumbledore.
\par \lquote What would the Death Eaters want with a poor broken-down old buffer like me?\rquote  demanded Slughorn.
\par \lquote I imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion, torture and murder,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Are you really telling me that they haven\rquote t come recruiting yet?\rquote 
\par Slughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, then muttered, \lquote I haven\rquote t given them the chance. I\rquote ve been on the move for a year. Never stay in one place more than a week. Move from Muggle house to Muggle house \endash 
 the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands. It\rquote s been very pleasant, I\rquote ll be sorry to leave. It\rquote s quite easy once you know how, one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use inste
ad of Sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbours don\rquote t spot you bringing in the piano.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ingenious,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote But it sounds a rather tiring existence for a broken-down old buffer in search of a quiet life. Now, if you were to return to Hogwarts \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote If you\rquote re going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school, you can save your breath, Albus! I might have been in hiding, but some funny rumours have reached me since Dolores Umbridge left! If that\rquote 
s how you treat teachers these days \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I think you, Horace, would have known better than to stride into the Forest and call a horde of angry centaurs \'93filthy half-breeds\'94.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s what she did, did she?\rquote  said Slughorn. \lquote Idiotic woman. Never liked her.\rquote 
\par Harry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn looked round at him.
\par \lquote Sorry,\rquote  Harry said hastily. \lquote It\rquote s just \endash  I didn\rquote t like her, either.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore stood up rather suddenly.
\par \lquote Are you leaving?\rquote  asked Slughorn at once, looking hopeful.
\par \lquote No, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Slughorn, clearly disappointed. \lquote Second on the left down the hall.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore crossed the room. Once the door had closed behind him there wa
s silence. After a few moments Slughorn got to his feet, but seemed uncertain what to do with himself. He shot a furtive look at Harry, then strode to the fire and turned his back on it, warming his wide behind.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t think I don\rquote t know why he\rquote s brought you,\rquote  he said abruptly.
\par Harry merely looked at Slughorn. Slughorn\rquote s watery eyes slid over Harry\rquote s scar, this time taking in the rest of his face.
\par \lquote You look very like your father.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I\rquote ve been told,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Except for your eyes. You\rquote ve got \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote My mother\rquote s eyes, yeah.\rquote  Harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing.
\par \lquote Humph. Yes, well. You shouldn\rquote t have favourites as a teacher, of course, but she was one of mine. Your mother,\rquote  Slughorn added, in answer to Harry\rquote s questioning look. \lquote Lily Evans
. One of the brightest I ever taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I used to tell her she ought to have been in my house. Very cheeky answers I used to get back, too.\rquote 
\par \lquote Which was your house?\rquote 
\par \lquote I was Head of Slytherin,\rquote  said Slughorn. \lquote Oh, now,\rquote  he went on quickly, seeing the expression on Harry\rquote s face and wagging a stubby finger at him, \lquote don\rquote t go holding that against me! You\rquote 
ll be Gryffindor like her, I suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? You must have done \endash  been in the papers for the last couple of years \endash  died a few weeks ago \endash \rquote 
\par It was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harry\rquote s intestines and held them tight.
\par \lquote Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father\rquote s at school. The whole Black family had been in my house, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame \endash  he was a talented boy. I got his brother Regulus when he came along, but I\rquote 
d have liked the set.\rquote 
\par He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction. Apparently lost in memories, he gazed at the opposite wall, turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside.
\par \lquote Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn\rquote t believe it when I found out. Thought she must have been pure-blood, she was so good.\rquote 
\par \lquote One of my best friends is Muggle-born,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote and she\rquote s the best in our year.\rquote 
\par \lquote Funny how that sometimes happens, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Slughorn.
\par \lquote Not really,\rquote  said Harry coldly.
\par Slughorn looked down at him in surprise.
\par \lquote You mustn\rquote t think I\rquote m prejudiced!\rquote  he said. \lquote No, no, no! Haven\rquote t I just said your mother was one of my all-time favour\-ite students? And there was Dirk Cresswell in the year after her, too \endash 
 now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office, of course \endash  another Muggle-born, a very gifted student, and still gives me excellent inside information on the goings-on at Gringotts!\rquote 
\par He bounced up and down a little, smiling in a self-satisfied way, and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser, each peopled with tiny moving occupants.
\par \lquote All ex-students, all signed. You\rquote ll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Daily Prophet, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 he\rquote s always interested to hear my take on the day\rquote s news. And Ambrosius Flume, of Honey\-dukes \endash  a hamper every birthday, and all because I was able to give him an intro
duction to Ciceron Harkiss, who gave him his first job! And at the back \endash  you\rquote ll see her if you just crane your neck \endash  that\rquote s Gwenog Jones, who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies ... people are always astonished to hear I
\rquote m on first-name terms with the Harpies, and free tickets when\-ever I want them!\rquote 
\par This thought seemed to cheer him up enormously.
\par \lquote And all these people know where to find you, to send you stuff?\rquote  asked Harry, who could not help wondering why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked down Sl
ughorn if hampers of sweets, Quidditch tickets and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him.
\par The smile slid from Slughorn\rquote s face as quickly as the blood from his walls.
\par \lquote Of course not,\rquote  he said, looking down at Harry. \lquote I have been out of touch with everybody for a year.\rquote 
\par Harry had the impression that the words shocked Slughorn himself; he looked quite unsettled for a moment. Then he shrugged.
\par \lquote Still ... the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times. All very well for Dumbledore to talk, but taking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix! And while I\rquote 
m sure they\rquote re very admirable and brave and all the rest of it, I don\rquote t personally fancy the mortality rate \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts,\rquote  said Harry, who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice: it was hard to sympathise with Slughorn\rquote 
s cosseted existence when he remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living on rats. \lquote Most of the teachers aren\rquote t in it and none of them has ever been killed \endash 
 well, unless you count Quirrell, and he got what he deserved seeing as he was work\-ing with Voldemort.\rquote 
\par Harry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear Voldemort\rquote s name spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest, which Harry ignored.
\par \lquote I reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumbledore\rquote s headmaster; he\rquote s supposed to be the only one Voldemort ever feared, isn\rquote t he?\rquote  Harry went on.
\par Slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two: he seemed to be thinking over Harry\rquote s words.
\par \lquote Well, yes, it is true that He Who Must Not Be Named has never sought a fight with Dumbledore,\rquote  he muttered grudgingly. \lquote And I 
suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death Eaters, He Who Must Not Be Named can hardly count me a friend ... in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to Albus ... I cannot pretend that Amelia Bones\rquote 
s death did not shake me ... if she, with all her Ministry contacts and protection ...\rquote 
\par Dumbledore re-entered the room and Slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house.
\par \lquote Oh, there you are, Albus,\rquote  he said. \lquote You\rquote ve been a very long time. Upset stomach?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I do love knitting patterns. Well, Harry, we have trespassed upon Horace\rquote s hospitality quite long enough; I think it is time for us to leave.\rquote 
\par Not at all reluctant to obey, Harry jumped to his feet. Slughorn seemed taken aback.
\par \lquote You\rquote re leaving?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see one.\rquote 
\par \lquote Lost ...?\rquote 
\par Slughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore fastening his travelling cloak and Harry zipping up his jacket.
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote m sorry you don\rquote t want the job, Horace,\rquote  said Dumbledore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute. \lquote 
Hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again. Our greatly increased security notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit, should you wish to.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes .... well ... very gracious ... as I say ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Goodbye, then.\rquote 
\par \lquote Bye,\rquote  said Harry.
\par They were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them.
\par \lquote All right, all right, I\rquote ll do it!\rquote 
\par Dumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room.
\par \lquote You will come out of retirement?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, yes,\rquote  said Slughorn impatiently. \lquote I must be mad, but yes.\rquote 
\par \lquote Wonderful,\rquote  said Dumbledore, beaming. \lquote Then, Horace, we shall see you on the first of September.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I daresay you will,\rquote  grunted Slughorn.
\par As they set off down the garden path, Slughorn\rquote s voice floated after them.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll want a pay rise, Dumbledore!\rquote 
\par Dumbledore chuckled. The garden gate swung shut behind them and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist.
\par \lquote Well done, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t do anything,\rquote  said Harry in surprise.
\par \lquote Oh yes you did. You showed Horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts. Did you like him?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ...\rquote 
\par Harry wasn\rquote t sure whether he liked Slughorn or not. He supposed he had been pleasant in his way, but he had also seemed vain and, whatever he said to the contrary, much too surprised that a Muggle-born should make a good witch.
\par \lquote Horace,\rquote  said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the responsi\-bility to say any of this, \lquote 
likes his comfort. He also likes the company of the famous, the successful and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people. He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers the back seat \endash 
 more room to spread out, you see. He used to handpick favourites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambi\-tion or their brains, sometimes for their charm or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to bec
ome outstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a kind of club of his favourites with himself at the centre, making introductions, forging useful contacts between members, and always reaping some kind of benefit in return, whether a free box of his
 favourite crystallised pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin Liaison Office.\rquote 
\par Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider, spinning a web around him, twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer.
\par \lquote I tell you all this,\rquote  Dumbledore continued, \lquote not to turn you against Horace \endash  or, as we must now call him, Professor Slughorn \endash  but to put you on your guard. He will undoubt\-edly try to collect you, Harry. You would
 be the jewel of his collection: the Boy Who Lived ... or, as they call you these days, the Chosen One.\rquote 
\par At these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over Harry. He was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago, words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him:
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Neither can live while the other survives ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par Dumbledore had stopped walking, level with the church they had passed earlier.
\par \lquote This will do, Harry. If you will grasp my arm.\rquote 
\par Braced this time, Harry was re
ady for the Apparition, but still found it unpleasant. When the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again, he was standing in a country lane beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favourite buildi
ng in the world: The Burrow. In spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him, his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it. Ron was in there ... and so was Mrs Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he knew ...
\par \lquote If you don\rquote t mind, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore, as they passed through the gate, \lquote I\rquote d like a few words with you before we part. In private. Perhaps in here?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore pointed towards a run-down stone outhouse where the Weasleys kept their broomsticks. A little puzzled, Ha
rry followed Dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard. Dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled down at Harry.
\par \lquote I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry. Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you.\rquote 

\par Harry swallowed; his voice seemed to have deserted him. He did not think he could stand to discuss Sirius. It had been painful enough to hear Uncle Vernon say \lquote His godfather\rquote s dead?\rquote ; even worse to hear Sirius\rquote 
s name thrown out casually by Slughorn.
\par \lquote It was cruel,\rquote  said Dumbledore softly, \lquote that you and Sirius had such a short time together. A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship.\rquote 
\par Harry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing Dumbledore\rquote s hat. He could tell that Dumbledore understood, that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived Harry had spent nearly all his time at the Dursleys\rquote 
 lying on his bed, refusing meals and staring at the misted window, full of the chill emptiness that he had come to associate with Dementors.
\par \lquote It\rquote s just hard,\rquote  Harry said finally, in a low voice, \lquote to realise he won\rquote t write to me again.\rquote 
\par His eyes burned suddenly and he blinked. He felt stupid for admitting it, but the fact that he had had someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened to him, almost like a parent, had been one of 
the best things about discovering his godfather ... and now the post owls would never bring him that comfort again ...
\par \lquote Sirius represented much to you that you had never known before,\rquote  said Dumbledore gently. \lquote Naturally, the loss is devastating ...\rquote 
\par \lquote But while I was at the Dursleys\rquote ,\rquote  interrupted Harry, his voice growing stronger, \lquote I realised I can\rquote t shut myself away or \endash  or crack up. Sirius wouldn\rquote t have wanted that, would he? And anyway, life\rquote 
s too short ... look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vance ... it could be me next, couldn\rquote t it? But if it is,\rquote  he said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore\rquote s blue eyes, gleaming in the wand-light, \lquote I\rquote 
ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Spoken both like your mother and father\rquote s son and Sirius\rquote s true godson!\rquote  said Dumbledore, with an approving pat on Harry\rquote s back. \lquote I take my hat off to you \endash 
 or I would, if I were not afraid of showering you in spiders.
\par \lquote And now, Harry, on a closely related subject ... I gather that you have been taking the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 over the last two weeks?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry, and his heart beat a little faster.
\par \lquote Then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks, as floods, concerning your adventure in the Hall of Prophecy?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry again. \lquote And now everyone knows that I\rquote m the one \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, they do not,\rquote  interrupted Dumbledore. \lquote There are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord Voldemort, and 
they are both standing in this smelly, spidery broom shed. It is true, however, that many have guessed, correctly, that Voldemort sent his Death Eaters to steal a prophecy, and that the prophecy concerned you.
\par \lquote Now, I think I am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote A wise decision, on the whole,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Although I think you ought to relax it in favour of your friends, Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger. Yes,\rquote  he continued, when Harry looked startled, \lquote 
I think they ought to know. You do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them.\rquote 
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t want \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  to worry or frighten them?\rquote  said Dumbledore, surveying Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles. \lquote 
Or perhaps, to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened? You need your friends, Harry. As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away.\rquote 
\par Harry said nothing, but Dumbledore did not seem to require an answer. He continued, \lquote On a different, though related, subject, it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year.\rquote 
\par \lquote Private \endash  with you?\rquote  said Harry, surprised out of his preoccupied silence.
\par \lquote Yes. I think it is time that I took a greater hand in your education.\rquote 
\par \lquote What will you be teaching me, sir?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, a little of this, a little of that,\rquote  said Dumbledore airily.
\par Harry waited hopefully, but Dumbledore did not elaborate, so he asked something else that had been bothering him slightly.
\par \lquote If I\rquote m having lessons with you, I won\rquote t have to do Occlum\-ency lessons with Snape, will I?\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Professor }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Snape, Harry \endash  and no, you will not.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good,\rquote  said Harry in relief, \lquote because they were a \endash \rquote 
\par He stopped, careful not to say what he really thought.
\par \lquote I think the word \'93fiasco\'94 would be a good one here,\rquote  said Dumbledore, nodding.
\par Harry laughed.
\par \lquote Well, that means I won\rquote t see much of Professor Snape from now on,\rquote  he said, \lquote because he won\rquote t let me carry on Potions unless I get \'93Outstanding\'94 in my O.W.L., which I know I haven\rquote t.\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t count your owls before they are delivered,\rquote  said Dumbledore gravely. \lquote Which, now I think of it, ought to be some time later today. Now, two more things, Harry, before we part.
\par \lquote Firstly, I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with you at all times from this moment onwards. Even within Hogwarts itself. Just in case, you understand me?\rquote 
\par Harry nodded.
\par \lquote And lastly, while you stay here, The Burrow has been given the highest security the Ministry of Magic can provide. These measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly \endash 
 all their post, for instance, is being searched at the Ministry, before being sent on. They do not mind in the slightest, for their only concern is your safety. However, it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them.\rquote 

\par \lquote I understand,\rquote  said Harry quickly.
\par \lquote Very well, then,\rquote  said Dumbledore, pushing open the broom-shed door and stepping out into the yard. \lquote I see a light in the kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are.\rquote

Harry and Dumbledore approached the back door of The Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar litter of
 old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons; Harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed. Dumbledore knocked three times and Harry saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window.

\rquote s. \lquote Declare yourself!\rquote 
\par \lquote It is I, Dumbledore, bringing Harry.\rquote 
\par The door opened at once. There stood Mrs Weasley, short, plump and wearing an old green dressing-gown.
\par \lquote Harry, dear! Gracious, Albus, you gave me a fright, you said not to expect you before morning!\rquote 
\par \lquote We were lucky,\rquote  said Dumbledore, ushering Harry over the threshold. \lquote Slughorn proved much more persuadable than I had expected. Harry\rquote s doing, of course. Ah, hello, Nymphadora!\rquote 
\par Harry looked around and saw that Mrs Weasley was not alone, despite the lateness of the hour. A young witch with a pale, heart-shaped face and mousy-brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands.
\par \lquote Hello, Professor,\rquote  she said. \lquote Wotcher, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hi, Tonks.\rquote 
\par Harry thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there was something forced in her smile. Certainly her appearance was less colourful than usual without her customary shade of bubblegum-pink hair.
\par \lquote I\rquote d better be off,\rquote  she said quickly, standing up and pulling her cloak around her shoulders. \lquote Thanks for the tea and sym\-pathy, Molly.\rquote 
\par \lquote Please don\rquote t leave on my account,\rquote  said Dumbledore cour\-teously. \lquote I cannot stay, I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, no, I need to get going,\rquote  said Tonks, not meeting Dumbledore\rquote s eyes. \lquote \rquote Night \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Dear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, Remus and Mad-Eye are coming \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, really, Molly ... thanks anyway ... goodnight, everyone.\rquote 
\par Tonks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air. Harry noticed that Mrs Weasley looked troubled.
\par \lquote Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Take care of yourself. Molly, your servant.\rquote 
\par He made Mrs Weasley a bow and followed Tonks, vanish\-ing at precisely the same spot. Mrs Weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered Harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine his appearance.
\par \lquote You\rquote re like Ron,\rquote  she sighed, looking him up and down. \lquote Both of you look as though you\rquote ve had Stretching Jinxes put on you. I swear Ron\rquote 
s grown four inches since I last bought him school robes. Are you hungry, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I am,\rquote  said Harry, suddenly realising just how hungry he was.
\par \lquote Sit down, dear, I\rquote ll knock something up.\rquote 
\par As Harry sat down a furry ginger cat with a squashed face jumped on to his knees and settled there, purring.
\par \lquote So Hermione\rquote s here?\rquote  he asked happily as he tickled Crook\-shanks behind the ear.
\par \lquote Oh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, rapping a large iron pot with her wand: it bounced on to the stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once. \lquote Everyone\rquote s in bed, of course, we didn\rquote 
t expect you for hours. Here you are \endash \rquote 
\par She tapped the pot again; it rose into the air, flew towards Harry and tipped over; Mrs Weasley slid a bowl neatly beneath it just in time to catch the stream of thick, steaming onion soup.
\par \lquote Bread, dear?\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks, Mrs Weasley.\rquote 
\par She waved her wand over her shoulder; a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully on to the table. As the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back on to the stove, Mrs Weasley sat down opposite him.
\par \lquote So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?\rquote 
\par Harry nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak.
\par \lquote He taught Arthur and me,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. \lquote He was at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same time as Dumbledore, I think. Did you like him?\rquote 
\par His mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and gave a non-committal jerk of the head.
\par \lquote I know what you mean,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, nodding wisely. \lquote Of course he can be charming when he wants to be, but Arthur\rquote s never liked him much. The Ministry\rquote s littered with Slughorn\rquote 
s old favourites, he was always good at giving leg-ups, but he never had much time for Arthur \endash  didn\rquote t seem to think he was enough of a high-flier. Well, that just shows you, even Slughorn makes mistakes. I don\rquote t know whether Ron
\rquote s told you in any of his letters \endash  it\rquote s only just happened \endash  but Arthur\rquote s been promoted!\rquote 
\par It could not have been clearer that Mrs Weasley had been bursting to say this. Harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blistering.
\par \lquote That\rquote s great!\rquote  he gasped.
\par \lquote You are sweet,\rquote  beamed Mrs Weasley, possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news. \lquote Yes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situ\-ation, and Arthur\rquote 
s heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. It\rquote s a big job, he\rquote s got ten people reporting to him now!\rquote 
\par \lquote What exactly \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, you see, in all the panic about You-Know-Who, odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere, things that are supposed to guard against You-Know-Who and the Death Eaters. You can imagine the kind of thing \endash  so-called pro\-
tective potions that are really gravy with a bit of Bubotuber pus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off ... well, in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus Fletcher, who\rquote 
ve never done an honest day\rquote s work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is, but every now and then something really nasty turns up. The other day Arthur confis\-cated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes t
hat were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater. So you see, it\rquote s a very important job, and I tell him it\rquote s just silly to miss dealing with spark-plugs and toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish.\rquote 
 Mrs Weasley ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been Harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark-plugs.
\par \lquote Is Mr Weasley still at work?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote Yes, he is. As a matter of fact, he\rquote s a tiny bit late ... he said he\rquote d be back around midnight ...\rquote 
\par She turned to look at a large clock that was perched awk\-
wardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table. Harry recognised it at once: it had nine hands, each inscribed with the name of a family member, and usually hung on the Weasleys\rquote 
 sitting-room wall, though its current position suggested that Mrs Weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her. Every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 mortal peril.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote It\rquote s been like that for a while now,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, in an unconvincingly casual voice, \lquote ever since You-Know-Who came back into the open. I suppose everybody\rquote s in mortal peril now ... I don\rquote 
t think it can be just our family ... but I don\rquote t know anyone else who\rquote s got a clock like this, so I can\rquote t check. Oh!\rquote 
\par With a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock\rquote s face. Mr Weasley\rquote s hand had switched to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 travelling.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote He\rquote s coming!\rquote 
\par And sure enough, a moment later there was a knock on the back door. Mrs Weasley jumped up and hurried to it; with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly, \lquote Arthur, is that you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  came Mr Weasley\rquote s weary voice. \lquote But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the question!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, honestly ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Molly!\rquote 
\par \lquote All right, all right ... what is your dearest ambition?\rquote 
\par \lquote To find out how aeroplanes stay up.\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob, but appar\-ently Mr Weasley was holding tight to it on the other side, because the door remained firmly shut.
\par \lquote Molly! I\rquote ve got to ask you your question first!\rquote 
\par \lquote Arthur, really, this is just silly ...\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you like me to call you when we\rquote re alone together?\rquote 
\par Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell that Mrs Weasley had turned bright red; he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and hastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl.
\par \lquote Mollywobbles,\rquote  whispered a mortified Mrs Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door.
\par \lquote Correct,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote Now you can let me in.\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband, a thin, balding, red-haired wizard wearing horn-rimmed spectacles and a long and dusty travelling cloak.
\par \lquote I still don\rquote t see why we have to go through that every time you come home,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, still pink in the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak. \lquote 
I mean, a Death Eater might have forced the answer out of you before imper\-sonating you!\rquote 
\par \lquote I know, dear, but it\rquote s Ministry procedure and I have to set an example. Something smells good \endash  onion soup?\rquote 
\par Mr Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table.
\par \lquote Harry! We didn\rquote t expect you until morning!\rquote 
\par They shook hands and Mr Weasley dropped into the chair beside Harry as Mrs Weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him, too.
\par \lquote Thanks, Molly. It\rquote s been a tough night. Some idiot\rquote s started selling Metamorph-Medals. Just sling them around your neck and you\rquote ll be able to change your appearance at will. A hundred thousand disguises, all for ten Galleons!
\rquote 
\par \lquote And what really happens when you put them on?\rquote 
\par \lquote Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange colour, but a couple of people have also sprouted tentacle-like warts all over their bodies. As if St Mungo\rquote s didn\rquote t have enough to do already!\rquote 
\par \lquote It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find funny,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley hesitantly. \lquote Are you sure \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course I am!\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote The boys wouldn\rquote t do anything like that now, not when people are desperate for protection!\rquote 
\par \lquote So is that why you\rquote re late, Metamorph-Medals?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, we got wind of a nasty Backfiring Jinx down in Elephant and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law Enforce\-ment Squad had sorted it out by the time we got there ...\rquote 
\par Harry stifled a yawn behind his hand.
\par \lquote Bed,\rquote  said an undeceived Mrs Weasley at once. \lquote I\rquote ve got Fred and George\rquote s room all ready for you, you\rquote ll have it to yourself.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why, where are they?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, they\rquote re in Diagon Alley, sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as they\rquote re so busy,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. \lquote I must say, I didn\rquote t approve at first
, but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business! Come on, dear, your trunk\rquote s already up there.\rquote 
\par \lquote \rquote Night, Mr Weasley,\rquote  said Harry, pushing back his chair. Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room.
\par \lquote G\rquote night, Harry,\rquote  said Mr Weasley.
\par Harry saw Mrs Weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen. All the hands were, once again, at }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 mortal peril.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par Fred and George\rquote s bedroom was on the second floor. Mrs Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside tabl
e and it ignited at once, bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow. Though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window, their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what Harry thought was gunpowder. A consid
erable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked, sealed cardboard boxes, amongst which stood Harry\rquote s school trunk. The room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse.
\par Hedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on t
op of a large wardrobe, then took off through the window; Harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting. Harry bade Mrs Weasley goodnight, put on pyjamas and got into one of the beds. There was something hard in the pillow\-
case. He groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple and orange sweet, which he recognised as a Puking Pastille. Smiling to himself, he rolled over and was instantly asleep.
\par Seconds later, or so it seemed to Harry, he was woken by what sounded like cannon-fire as the
 door burst open. Sitting bolt upright, he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back: the dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes. Shielding them with one hand, he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the other.
\par \lquote Wuzzgoinon?\rquote 
\par \lquote We didn\rquote t know you were here already!\rquote  said a loud and excited voice, and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head.
\par \lquote Ron, don\rquote t hit him!\rquote  said a girl\rquote s voice reproachfully.
\par Harry\rquote s hand found his glasses and he shoved them on, though the light was so bright he could hardly see anyway. A long, looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment; he blinked and Ron Weasley came into focus, grinning down at him.
\par \lquote All right?\rquote 
\par \lquote Never been better,\rquote  said Harry, rubbing the top of his head and slumping back on to his pillows. \lquote You?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not bad,\rquote  said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it. \lquote When did you get here? Mum\rquote s only just told us!\rquote 
\par \lquote About one o\rquote clock this morning.\rquote 
\par \lquote Were the Muggles all right? Did they treat you OK?\rquote 
\par \lquote Same as usual,\rquote  said Harry, as Hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed. \lquote They didn\rquote t talk to me much, but I like it better that way. How\rquote re you, Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, I\rquote m fine,\rquote  said Hermione, who was scrutinising Harry as though he was sickening for something.
\par He thought he knew what was behind this and, as he had no wish to discuss Sirius\rquote s death or any other miserable sub\-ject at the moment, he said, \lquote What\rquote s the time? Have I missed breakfast?\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t worry about that, Mum\rquote s bringing you up a tray; she reckons you look underfed,\rquote  said Ron, rolling his eyes. \lquote So, what\rquote s been going on?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nothing much, I\rquote ve just been stuck at my aunt and uncle\rquote s, haven\rquote t I?\rquote 
\par \lquote Come off it!\rquote  said Ron. \lquote You\rquote ve been off with Dumbledore!\rquote 
\par \lquote It wasn\rquote t that exciting. He just wanted me to help him per\-suade this old teacher to come out of retirement. His name\rquote s Horace Slughorn.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Ron, looking disappointed. \lquote We thought \endash \rquote 
\par Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron and Ron changed tack at top speed.
\par \lquote \endash  we thought it\rquote d be something like that.\rquote 
\par \lquote You did?\rquote  said Harry, amused.
\par \lquote Yeah ... yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we need a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, don\rquote t we? So, er, what\rquote s he like?\rquote 
\par \lquote He looks a bit like a walrus and he used to be Head of Slytherin,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Something wrong, Hermione?\rquote 
\par She was watching him as though expecting strange symp\-toms to manifest themselves at any moment. She rearranged her features hastily in an unconvincing smile.
\par \lquote No, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like he\rquote ll be a good teacher?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dunno,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote He can\rquote t be worse than Umbridge, can he?\rquote 
\par \lquote I know someone who\rquote s worse than Umbridge,\rquote  said a voice from the doorway. Ron\rquote s younger sister slouched into the room, looking irritable. \lquote Hi, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s up with you?\rquote  Ron asked.
\par \lquote It\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 her,\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699  said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harry\rquote 
s bed. \lquote She\rquote s driving me mad.\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s she done now?\rquote  asked Hermione sympathetically.
\par \lquote It\rquote s the way she talks to me \endash  you\rquote d think I was about three!\rquote 
\par \lquote I know,\rquote  said Hermione, dropping her voice. \lquote She\rquote s so full of herself.\rquote 
\par Harry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about Mrs Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for saying angrily, \lquote Can\rquote t you two lay off her for five seconds?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, that\rquote s right, defend her,\rquote  snapped Ginny. \lquote We all know you can\rquote t get enough of her.\rquote 
\par This seemed an odd comment to make about Ron\rquote s mother; starting to feel that he was missing something, Harry said, \lquote Who are you \endash ?\rquote 
\par But his question was answered before he could finish it. The bedroom door flew open again and Harry instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that Hermione and Ginny slid off the bed on to the floor.
\par A young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall and willowy w
ith long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray.
\par \lquote \rquote Arry,\rquote  she said in a throaty voice. \lquote Eet \rquote as been too long!\rquote 
\par As she swept over the threshold towards him, Mrs Weasley was revealed, bobbing along in her wake, looking rather cross.
\par \lquote There was no need to bring up the tray, I was just about to do it myself!\rquote 
\par \lquote Eet was no trouble,\rquote  said Fleur Delacour, setting the tray across Harry\rquote s knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek: he felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn. \lquote I \rquote ave been longing to see \rquote 
im. You remember my seester, Gabrielle? She never stops talking about \rquote Arry Potter. She will be delighted to see you again.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh ... is she here too?\rquote  Harry croaked.
\par \lquote No, no, silly boy,\rquote  said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, \lquote I mean next summer, when we \endash  but do you not know?\rquote 
\par Her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at Mrs Weasley, who said, \lquote We hadn\rquote t got around to telling him yet.\rquote 
\par Fleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped Mrs Weasley across the face.
\par \lquote Bill and I are going to be married!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing how Mrs Weasley, Hermione and Ginny were all determinedly avoiding each other\rquote s gaze. \lquote Wow. Er \endash  congratulations!\rquote 
\par She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.
\par \lquote Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very \rquote ard, and I only work part-time at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me \rquote ere for a few days to get to know \rquote is family properly. I was so pleased to \rquote 
ear you would be coming \endash  zere isn\rquote t much to do \rquote ere, unless you like cooking and chickens! Well \endash  enjoy your breakfast, \rquote Arry!\rquote 
\par With these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room, closing the door quietly behind her.
\par Mrs Weasley made a noise that sounded like \lquote tchah!\rquote 
\par \lquote Mum hates her,\rquote  said Ginny quietly.
\par \lquote I do not hate her!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley in a cross whisper. \lquote I just think they\rquote ve hurried into this engagement, that\rquote s all!\rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote ve known each other a year,\rquote  said Ron, who looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed door.
\par \lquote Well, that\rquote s not very long! I know why it\rquote s happened, of course. It\rquote s all this uncertainty with You-Know-Who coming back, people think they might be dead tomorrow, so they\rquote re rushing all sorts of decisions they\rquote 
d normally take time over. It was the same last time he was powerful, people eloping left right and centre \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Including you and Dad,\rquote  said Ginny slyly.
\par \lquote Yes, well, your father and I were made for each other, what was the point in waiting?\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. \lquote Whereas Bill and Fleur ... well ... what have they really got in common? He\rquote s a hard-working
, down-to-earth sort of person, whereas she\rquote s \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote A cow,\rquote  said Ginny, nodding. \lquote But Bill\rquote s not that down-to-earth. He\rquote s a curse-breaker, isn\rquote t he, he likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour ... I expect that\rquote s why he\rquote s gone for Phlegm.\rquote 

\par \lquote Stop calling her that, Ginny,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley sharply, as Harry and Hermione laughed. \lquote Well, I\rquote d better get on ... eat your eggs while they\rquote re warm, Harry.\rquote 
\par Looking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed slightly punch-drunk; he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you get used to her if she\rquote s staying in the same house?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote Well, you do,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then ...\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s pathetic,\rquote  said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall.
\par \lquote You don\rquote t really want her around for ever?\rquote  Ginny asked Ron incredulously. When he merely shrugged, she said, \lquote Well, Mum\rquote s going to put a stop to it if she can, I bet you anything.\rquote 
\par \lquote How\rquote s she going to manage that?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I think she\rquote s hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead. I hope he does, I\rquote d much rather have her in the family.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, that\rquote ll work,\rquote  said Ron sarcastically. \lquote Listen, no bloke in his right mind\rquote s going to fancy Tonks when Fleur\rquote s around. I mean, Tonks is OK-looking when she isn\rquote 
t doing stupid things to her hair and her nose, but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s a damn sight nicer than }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Phlegm,\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699  said Ginny.
\par \lquote And she\rquote s more intelligent, she\rquote s an Auror!\rquote  said Hermione from the corner.
\par \lquote Fleur\rquote s not stupid, she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Not you as well!\rquote  said Hermione bitterly.
\par \lquote I suppose you like the way Phlegm says \'93\rquote Arry\'94, do you?\rquote  asked Ginny scornfully.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, wishing he hadn\rquote t spoken, \lquote I was just saying, Phlegm \endash  I mean, Fleur \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote d much rather have Tonks in the family,\rquote  said Ginny. \lquote At least she\rquote s a laugh.\rquote 
\par \lquote She hasn\rquote t been much of a laugh lately,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Every time I\rquote ve seen her she\rquote s looked more like Moaning Myrtle.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s not fair,\rquote  snapped Hermione. \lquote She still hasn\rquote t got over what happened ... you know ... I mean, he was her cousin!\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He picked up a fork and began shovelling scrambled eggs into his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation.
\par \lquote Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other!\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never met \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s not the point,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote She thinks it was her fault he died!\rquote 
\par \lquote How does she work that one out?\rquote  asked Harry, in spite of himself.
\par \lquote Well, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn\rquote t she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her off, Bellatrix couldn\rquote t have killed Sirius.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s stupid,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote It\rquote s survivor\rquote s guilt,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote I know Lupin\rquote s tried to talk her round, but she\rquote s still really down. She\rquote s actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing!\rquote 
\par \lquote With her \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote She can\rquote t change her appearance like she used to,\rquote  explained Hermione. \lquote I think her powers must have been affected by shock, or something.\rquote 
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t know that could happen,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Nor did I,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote but I suppose if you\rquote re really depressed ...\rquote 
\par The door opened again and Mrs Weasley popped her head in.
\par \lquote Ginny,\rquote  she whispered, \lquote come downstairs and help me with the lunch.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m talking to this lot!\rquote  said Ginny, outraged.
\par \lquote Now!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, and withdrew.
\par \lquote She only wants me there so she doesn\rquote t have to be alone with Phlegm!\rquote  said Ginny crossly. She swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a ballerina.

\par \lquote You lot had better come down quickly too,\rquote  she said as she left.
\par Harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more breakfast. Hermione was peering into Fred and George\rquote s boxes, though every now and then she cast sideways looks at Harry. Ron, who was now helping himself to Harry\rquote 
s toast, was still gazing dreamily at the door.
\par \lquote What\rquote s this?\rquote  Hermione asked eventually, holding up what looked like a small telescope.
\par \lquote Dunno,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote but if Fred and George\rquote ve left it here, it\rquote s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so be careful.\rquote 
\par \lquote Your mum said the shop\rquote s going well,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Said Fred and George have got a real flair for business.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s an understatement,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote They\rquote re raking in the Galleons! I can\rquote t wait to see the place. We haven\rquote t been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says Dad\rquote 
s got to be there for extra security and he\rquote s been really busy at work, but it sounds excellent.\rquote 
\par \lquote And what about Percy?\rquote  asked Harry; the third-eldest Weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of the family. \lquote Is he talking to your mum and dad again?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nope,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote But he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being back \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote I heard him telling your mum, Ron.\rquote 
\par \lquote Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore would say,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote He\rquote s going to be giving me private lessons this year,\rquote  said Harry conversationally.
\par Ron choked on his bit of toast and Hermione gasped.
\par \lquote You kept that quiet!\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote I only just remembered,\rquote  said Harry honestly. \lquote He told me last night in your broom shed.\rquote 
\par \lquote Blimey ... private lessons with Dumbledore!\rquote  said Ron, looking impressed. \lquote I wonder why he\rquote s ...?\rquote 
\par His voice tailed away. Harry saw him and Hermione exchange looks. Harry laid down his knife and fork, his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sit\-
ting in bed. Dumbledore had said to do it ... why not now? He fixed his eyes on his fork, which was gleaming in the sun\-light streaming on to his lap, and said, \lquote I don\rquote t know exactly why he\rquote 
s going to be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because of the prophecy.\rquote 
\par Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the impression that both had frozen. He continued, still speaking to his fork, \lquote You know, the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Nobody knows what it said, though,\rquote  said Hermione quickly. \lquote It got smashed.\rquote

\par The three of them gazed at each other in silence for a moment. Then there was a loud bang and Hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke.
\par \lquote Hermione!\rquote  shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash.
\par Hermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye.
\par \lquote I squeezed it and it \endash  it punched me!\rquote  she gasped.
\par And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t worry,\rquote  said Ron, who was plainly trying not to laugh, \lquote Mum\rquote ll fix that, she\rquote s good at healing minor injuries \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, well, never mind that now!\rquote  said Hermione hastily. \lquote Harry, oh, Harry ...\rquote 
\par She sat down on the edge of his bed again.
\par \lquote We wondered, after we got back from the Ministry ... obviously, we didn\rquote t want to say a
nything to you, but from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy, how it was about you and Voldemort, well, we thought it might be something like this ... oh, Harry ...\rquote  She stared at him, then whispered, \lquote Are you scared?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not as much as I was,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote When I first heard it, I was ... but now, it seems as though I always knew I\rquote d have to face him in the end ...\rquote 
\par \lquote When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in person, we thought he might be telling you something, or showing you something, to do with the prophecy,\rquote  said Ron eagerly. \lquote And we were kind of right, weren\rquote t we? He wouldn
\rquote t be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner, wouldn\rquote t waste his time \endash  he must think you\rquote ve got a chance!\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s true,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote I wonder what he\rquote ll teach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive magic, probably ... power\-ful counter-curses ... anti-jinxes ...\rquote 
\par Harry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight; a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to
 be dissolving. He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dang
erous, was worth more than he could ever tell them.
\par \lquote ... and evasive enchantments generally,\rquote  concluded Hermione. \lquote Well, at least you know one lesson you\rquote ll be having this year, that\rquote s one more than Ron and me. I wonder when our O.W.L. results will come?\rquote 
\par \lquote Can\rquote t be long now, it\rquote s been a month,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Hang on,\rquote  said Harry, as another part of the previous night\rquote s conversation came back to him. \lquote I think Dumbledore said our O.W.L. results would be arriving today!\rquote 
\par \lquote Today?\rquote  shrieked Hermione. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Today? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 But why didn\rquote t you

\par But when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later, fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray, it was to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation, while Mrs Weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda.
\par \lquote It just won\rquote t budge,\rquote  Mrs Weasley was saying anxiously, standing over Hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 The Healer\rquote s Hel

\par \lquote You won\rquote t, dear, we\rquote ll find an antidote, don\rquote t worry,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley soothingly.
\par \lquote Bill told me \rquote ow Fred and George are very amusing!\rquote  said Fleur, smiling serenely.
\par \lquote Yes, I can hardly breathe for laughing,\rquote  snapped Hermione.
\par She jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen, twisting her fingers together.
\par \lquote Mrs Weasley, you\rquote re quite, quite sure no owls have arrived this morning?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, dear, I\rquote d have noticed,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley patiently. \lquote But it\rquote s barely nine, there\rquote s still plenty of time ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I know I messed up Ancient Runes,\rquote  muttered Hermione feverishly, \lquote I definitely made at least one serious mistransla\-tion. And the Defence Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all. I thought Transfiguration
 went all right at the time, but looking back \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hermione, will you shut up, you\rquote re not the only one who\rquote s nervous!\rquote  barked Ron. \lquote And when you\rquote ve got your ten \'93Outstanding\'94 O.W.L.s ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t, don\rquote t, don\rquote t!\rquote  said Hermione, flapping her hands hysterically. \lquote I know I\rquote ve failed everything!\rquote 
\par \lquote What happens if we fail?\rquote  Harry asked the room at large, but it was again Hermione who answered.
\par \lquote We discuss our options with our Head of House, I asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s stomach squirmed. He wished he had eaten less breakfast.
\par \lquote At Beauxbatons,\rquote  said Fleur complacently, \lquote we \rquote ad a differ\-ent way of doing things. I think eet was better. We sat our examinations after six years of study, not five, and then \endash \rquote 
\par Fleur\rquote s words were drowned in a scream. Hermione was pointing through the kitchen window. Three black specks were clearly visible in the sky, growing larger all the time.
\par \lquote They\rquote re definitely owls,\rquote  said Ron hoarsely, jumping up to join Hermione at the window.
\par \lquote And there are three of them,\rquote  said Harry, hastening to her other side.
\par \lquote One for each of us,\rquote  said Hermione in a terrified whisper. \lquote Oh no ... oh no ... oh no ...\rquote 
\par She gripped both Harry and Ron tightly around the elbows.
\par The owls were flying directly at The Burrow, three hand\-some tawnies, each of which, it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house, was carrying a large square envelope.
\par \lquote Oh }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 no!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 squealed Hermione.
\par Mrs Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window. One, two, three, the owls soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line. All three of them lifted their right legs.
\par Harry moved forwards. The letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle. He untied it with fumbling fingers. To his left, Ron was trying to detach his own results; to his right, Hermione\rquote 
s hands were shaking so much she was making her whole owl tremble.
\par Nobody in the kitchen spoke. At last, Harry managed to detach the envelope. He slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment inside.

\par \lquote That\rquote s the one. Shop\rquote s empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.\rquote 
\par \lquote But wands \endash  what\rquote ll people do for wands?\rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote ll make do with other makers,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote But Ollivander was the best, and if the other side have got him it\rquote s not so good for us.\rquote 
\par The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their letters and book lists arrived from Hogwarts. Harry\rquote s included a sur\-prise: he had been made Quidditch Captain.
\par \lquote That gives you equal status with prefects!\rquote  cried Hermione happily. \lquote You can use our special bathroom now, and every\-thing!\rquote 
\par \lquote Wow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,\rquote  said Ron, examining the badge with glee. \lquote Harry, this is so cool, you\rquote re my captain \endash  if you let me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I don\rquote t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now you\rquote ve got these,\rquote  sighed Mrs Weasley, looking down Ron\rquote s book list. \lquote We\rquote ll go on Saturday as long as your father doesn\rquote 
t have to go into work again. I\rquote m not going there without him.\rquote 
\par \lquote Mum, d\rquote you honestly think You-Know-Who\rquote s going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?\rquote  sniggered Ron.
\par \lquote Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday, did they?\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, firing up at once. \lquote If you think security\rquote s a laughing matter you can stay behind and I\rquote ll get your things myself \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, I wanna come, I want to see Fred and George\rquote s shop!\rquote  said Ron hastily.
\par \lquote Then you just buck up your ideas, young man, before I decide you\rquote re too immature to come with us!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley angrily, snatching up her clock, all nine hands of which were still pointing at }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 mortal peril, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 and balancing it on top of a pile of just-laundered towels. \lquote 
And that goes for returning to Hogwarts, as well!\rquote 
\par Ron turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arms and stormed out of the room.
\par \lquote Blimey ... you can\rquote t even make a joke round here any more ...\rquote 
\par But Ron was careful not to be flippant about Voldemort over the next few days. Saturday dawned without any mo
re outbursts from Mrs Weasley, though she seemed very tense at breakfast. Bill, who would be staying at home with Fleur (much to Hermione and Ginny\rquote s pleasure), passed a full money-bag across the table to Harry.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s mine?\rquote  demanded Ron at once, his eyes wide.
\par \lquote That\rquote s already Harry\rquote s, idiot,\rquote  said Bill. \lquote I got it out of your vault for you, Harry, because it\rquote 
s taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment, the goblins have tightened security so much. Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity Probe stuck up his ... well, trust me, this way\rquote s easier.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks, Bill,\rquote  said Harry, pocketing his gold.
\par \lquote \rquote E is always so thoughtful,\rquote  purred Fleur adoringly, strok\-ing Bill\rquote s nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back.
\par It was an overcast, murky day. One of the special Ministry of Magic cars, in which Harry had ridden once before, was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house pulling on their cloaks.
\par \lquote It\rquote s good Dad can get us these again,\rquote  said Ron appreciat\-ively, stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from The Burrow, Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen win\-
dow. He, Harry, Hermione and Ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide back seat.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t get used to it, it\rquote s only because of Harry,\rquote  said Mr Weasley over his shoulder. He and Mrs Weasley were in front with the Ministry driver; the front passenger seat had oblig\-
ingly stretched into what resembled a two-seater sofa. \lquote He\rquote s been given top-grade security status. And we\rquote ll be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron, too.\rquote 
\par Harry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors. He had stowed his Invi
sibility Cloak in his backpack and felt that, if that was good enough for Dumbledore, it ought to be good enough for the Ministry, though now he came to think of it, he was not sure the Ministry knew about his Cloak.
\par \lquote Here you are, then,\rquote  said the driver a surprisingly short while later, speaking for the first time as he slowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped outside the Leaky Cauldron. \lquote I\rquote m to wait for you, any idea how long you\rquote 
ll be?\rquote 
\par \lquote A couple of hours, I expect,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote Ah, good, he\rquote s here!\rquote 
\par Harry imitated Mr Weasley and peered through the win\-dow; his heart leapt. There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black-bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at t
he sight of Harry\rquote s face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing Muggles.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone-crushing hug the moment Harry had stepped out of the car. \lquote Buckbeak \endash  Witherwings, I mean \endash  yeh should see him, Harry, he\rquote s so happy ter be back in the open air 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Glad he\rquote s pleased,\rquote  said Harry, grinning as he massaged his ribs. \lquote We didn\rquote t know \'93security\'94 meant you!\rquote 
\par \lquote I know, jus\rquote  like old times, innit? See, the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch o\rquote  Aurors, but Dumbledore said I\rquote d do,\rquote  said Hagrid proudly, throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets. \lquote Let
\rquote s get goin\rquote , then \endash  after yeh, Molly, Arthur \endash \rquote 
\par The Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harry\rquote s memory, completely empty. Only Tom the landlord, wizened and toothless, remained of the old crowd. He looked up hope\-fully as they entered, but before he could speak, Hagrid said importantly, 
\lquote Jus\rquote  passin\rquote  through today, Tom, sure yeh under\-stand. Hogwarts business, yeh know.\rquote 
\par Tom nodded gloomily and returned to 
wiping glasses; Harry, Hermione, Hagrid and the Weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood. Hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall, which opened at once to 
form an archway on to a winding cobbled street. They stepped through the entrance and paused, looking around.
\par Diagon Alley had changed. The colourful, glittering win\-dow displays of spellbooks, potion ingredients and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behi
nd the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them. Most of these sombre purple posters carried blown-up versions of the security advice on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others bore moving black-and-
white photo\-graphs of Death Eaters known to be on the loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apoth\-ecary. A few windows were boarded up, including those of Florean Fortescue\rquote 
s Ice-Cream Parlour. On the other hand, a number of shabby-looking stalls had sprung up along the street. The nearest one, which had been erected outside Flourish and Blotts under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard sign pinned to its front:

 he called at Mrs Weasley as they passed, leering at Ginny. \lquote Protect her pretty neck?\rquote 
\par \lquote If I were on duty ...\rquote  said Mr Weasley, glaring angrily at the amulet seller.
\par \lquote Yes, but don\rquote t go arresting anyone now, dear, we\rquote re in a hurry,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, nervously consulting a list. \lquote I think we\rquote d better do Madam Malkin\rquote s first, Hermione wants new dress robes and Ron\rquote

\par \lquote Molly, it doesn\rquote t make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkin\rquote s,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote Why don\rquote t those three go with Hagrid, and we can go to Flourish and Blotts and get every\-one\rquote s school books?\rquote 

\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley anxiously, clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack. \lquote Hagrid, do you think \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote  fret, they\rquote ll be fine with me, Molly,\rquote 
 said Hagrid soothingly, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid. Mrs Weasley did not look entirely convinced, but allowed the separation, scurrying off towards Flourish and Blotts with her husband and Ginny while H
arry, Ron, Hermione and Hagrid set off for Madam Malkin\rquote s.
\par Harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried, anxious look as Mrs Weasley, and that nobody was stopping to talk any more; the shoppers stayed together in their own tig
htly knit groups, moving intently about their business. Nobody seemed to be shopping alone.
\par \lquote Migh\rquote  be a bit of a squeeze in there with all o\rquote  us,\rquote  said Hagrid, stopping outside Madam Malkin\rquote s and bending down to peer through the window. \lquote I\rquote ll stand guard outside, all righ\rquote ?\rquote 
\par So Harry, Ron and Hermione entered the little shop together. It appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in span
gled green and blue.
\par \lquote ... not a child, in case you haven\rquote t noticed, Mother. I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 alone.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par There was a clucking noise and a voice Harry recognised as that of Madam Malkin said, \lquote Now, dear, your mother\rquote s quite right, none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own any more, it\rquote s nothing to do with being a child 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Watch where you\rquote re sticking that pin, will you!\rquote 
\par A teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white-blond hair appeared from behind the rack wearing a 
handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves. He strode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a few moments before he noticed Harry, Ron and Hermione reflected over his shoulder. His light grey
 eyes narrowed.
\par \lquote If you\rquote re wondering what the smell is, Mother, a Mudblood just walked in,\rquote  said Draco Malfoy.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think there\rquote s any need for language like that!\rquote  said Madam Malkin, scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand. \lquote And I don\rquote t want wands drawn in my shop, either!\rquote 
 she added hastily, for a glance towards the door had shown her Harry and Ron both standing there with their wands out and pointing at Malfoy.
\par Hermione, who was standing slightly behind them, whis\-pered, \lquote No, don\rquote t, honestly, it\rquote s not worth it ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, like you\rquote d dare do magic out of school,\rquote  sneered Malfoy. \lquote Who blacked your eye, Granger? I want to send them flowers.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s quite enough!\rquote  said Madam Malkin sharply, looking over her shoulder for support. \lquote Madam \endash  please \endash \rquote 
\par Narcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack.
\par \lquote Put those away,\rquote  she said coldly to Harry and Ron. \lquote If you attack my son again, I shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do.\rquote 
\par \lquote Really?\rquote  said Harry, taking a step forwards and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that, for all its pallor, still resembled her sister\rquote s. He was as tall as she was now. \lquote 
Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, are you?\rquote 
\par Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart.
\par \lquote Really, you shouldn\rquote t accuse \endash  dangerous thing to say \endash  wands away, please!\rquote 
\par But Harry did not lower his wand. Narcissa Malfoy smiled unpleasantly.
\par \lquote I see that being Dumbledore\rquote s favourite has given you a false sense of security, Harry Potter. But Dumbledore won\rquote t always be there to protect you.\rquote 
\par Harry looked mockingly all around the shop.
\par \lquote Wow ... look at that ... he\rquote s not here now! So why not have a go? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband!\rquote 
\par Malfoy made an angry movement towards Harry, but stumbled over his overlong robe. Ron laughed loudly.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter!\rquote  Malfoy snarled.
\par \lquote It\rquote s all right, Draco,\rquote  said Narcissa, restraining him with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder. \lquote I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius.\rquote 
\par Harry raised his wand higher.
\par \lquote Harry, no!\rquote  moaned Hermione, grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side. \lquote Think ... you mustn\rquote t ... you\rquote ll be in such trouble ...\rquote 
\par Madam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot, then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it wouldn\rquote t. She bent towards Malfoy, who was still glaring at Harry.
\par \lquote I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more, dear, let me just \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ouch!\rquote  bellowed Malfoy, slapping her hand away, \lquote watch where you\rquote re putting your pins, woman! Mother \endash  I don\rquote t think I want these any more \endash \rquote 
\par He pulled the robes over his head and threw them on to the floor at Madam Malkin\rquote s feet.
\par \lquote You\rquote re right, Draco,\rquote  said Narcissa, with a contemptuous glance at Hermione, \lquote now I know the kind of scum that shops here ... we\rquote ll do better at Twilfitt and Tatting\rquote s.\rquote 
\par And with that, the pair of them strode out of the shop, Malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could into Ron on the way out.
\par \lquote Well, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 really!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
said Madam Malkin, snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner, so that it removed the dust.
\par She was distracted all through the fitting of Ron and Harry\rquote s new robes, tried to sell Hermione wizard\rquote s dress robes instead of witch\rquote 
s, and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them.
\par \lquote Got ev\rquote rything?\rquote  asked Hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side.
\par \lquote Just about,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Did you see the Malfoys?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Hagrid, unconcerned. \lquote Bu\rquote  they wouldn\rquote  dare make trouble in the middle o\rquote  Diagon Alley, Harry, don\rquote  worry abou\rquote  them.\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione exchanged looks, but before they could disabuse Hagrid of this comfortable notion Mr and Mrs Weasley and Ginny appeared, all clutching heavy packages of books.
\par \lquote Everyone all right?\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. \lquote Got your robes? Right then, we can pop in at the apothecary and Eeylops on the way to Fred and George\rquote s \endash  stick close, now ...\rquote 
\par Neither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the apothecary, seeing that they were no longer studying Potions, but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eeylops Owl Emporium. Then, with 
Mrs Weasley checking her watch every minute or so, they headed further along the street in search of Weasleys\rquote  Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop run by Fred and George.
\par \lquote We really haven\rquote t got too long,\rquote  Mrs Weasley said. \lquote So we\rquote ll just have a quick look around and then back to the car. We must be close, that\rquote s number ninety-two ... ninety-four ...\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Whoa,\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699  said Ron, stopping in his tracks.
\par Set against the dull, poster-muffled shop fronts around them, Fred and George\rquote s windows hit the eye like a firework display
. Casual passers-by were looking back over their shoulders at the windows, and a few rather stunned-looking people had actually come to a halt, transfixed. The left-hand window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved, popped, flashed, 
bounced and shrieked; Harry\rquote s eyes began to water just looking at it. The right-hand window was covered with a gigantic poster, purple like those of the Ministry, but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters:

fected during their last, unfinished year at Hogwarts; Harry noticed that the Nosebleed Nougat was most popular, with 
only one battered box left on the shelf. There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of pants when waved; the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck; boxes of quills, which came i
n
 Self-Inking, Spell-Checking and Smart-Answer varieties. A space cleared in the crowd and Harry pushed his way towards the counter, where a gaggle of delighted ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of
 gallows, both perched on a box that read: Reusable Hangman \endash  Spell It Or He\rquote ll Swing!
\par \lquote \'93Patented Daydream Charms ...\'94\rquote

\par \lquote Muggle magic tricks!\rquote  said Fred happily, pointing them out. \lquote For freaks like Dad, you know, who love Muggle stuff. It\rquote s not a big earner, but we do fairly steady business, they\rquote re great novelties ... oh, here\rquote

\par \lquote So we\rquote ve expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, Shield Gloves ...\rquote 
\par \lquote ... I mean, they wouldn\rquote t help much against the Unfor\-givable Curses, but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes ...\rquote 
\par \lquote And then we thought we\rquote d get into the whole area of Defence Against the Dark Arts, because it\rquote s such a money-spinner,\rquote  continued George enthusiastically. \lquote This is cool. Look, Instant Darkness Powder, we\rquote 
re importing it from Peru. Handy if you want to make a quick escape.\rquote 
\par \lquote And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,\rquote  said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black hooter-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight. \lquote 
You just drop one surreptitiously and it\rquote ll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if you need one.\rquote 
\par \lquote Handy,\rquote  said Harry, impressed.
\par \lquote Here,\rquote  said George, catching a couple and throwing them to Harry.
\par A young witch with short blonde hair poked her head round the curtain; Harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes.
\par \lquote There\rquote s a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron, Mr Weasley and Mr Weasley,\rquote  she said.
\par Harry found it very odd to hear Fred and George called \lquote Mr Weasley\rquote , but they took it in their stride.
\par \lquote Right you are, Verity, I\rquote m coming,\rquote  said George promptly. \lquote Harry, you help yourself to anything you want, all right? No charge.\rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t do that!\rquote  said Harry, who had already pulled out his money-bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators.
\par \lquote You don\rquote t pay here,\rquote  said Fred firmly, waving away Harry\rquote s gold.
\par \lquote But \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You gave us our start-up loan, we haven\rquote t forgotten,\rquote  said George sternly. \lquote Take whatever you like, and just remember to tell people where you got it, if they ask.\rquote 
\par George swept off through the curtain to help with the customers and Fred led Harry back into the main part of the shop to find Hermione and Ginny still poring over the Patented Daydream Charms.
\par \lquote Haven\rquote t you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet?\rquote  asked Fred. \lquote Follow me, ladies ...\rquote 
\par Near the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusi\-astically. Hermione and Ginny both hung back, looking wary.
\par \lquote There you go,\rquote  said Fred proudly. \lquote Best range of love potions you\rquote ll find anywhere.\rquote 
\par Ginny raised an eyebrow sceptically. \lquote Do they work?\rquote 
\par \lquote Certainly they work, for up to twenty-four hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and the attractiveness of the girl,\rquote  said George, reappear\-ing suddenly at their side. \lquote But we\rquote re not selling them to our sister,\rquote  he added, becoming suddenly stern, \lquote not when she\rquote 
s already got about five boys on the go from what we\rquote ve \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Whatever you\rquote ve heard from Ron is a big fat lie,\rquote  said Ginny calmly, leaning forwards to take a small pink pot off the shelf. \lquote What\rquote s this?\rquote 
\par \lquote Guaranteed Ten-Second Pimple Vanisher,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote Excel\-lent on everything from boils to blackheads, but don\rquote t change the subject. Are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called Dean Thomas?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I am,\rquote  said Ginny. \lquote And last time I looked, he was defi\-nitely one boy, not five. What are those?\rquote 
\par She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple, all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting high-pitched squeaks.
\par \lquote Pygmy Puffs,\rquote  said George. \lquote Miniature puffskeins, we can\rquote t breed them fast enough. So what about Michael Corner?\rquote 
\par \lquote I dumped him, he was a bad loser,\rquote  said Ginny, putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it. \lquote They\rquote re really cute!\rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote re fairly cuddly, yes,\rquote  conceded Fred. \lquote But you\rquote re moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par Ginny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips. There was such a Mrs Weasley-ish glare on her face that Harry was surprised Fred didn\rquote t recoil.
\par \lquote It\rquote s none of your business. And I\rquote ll thank }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
she added angrily to Ron, who had just appeared at George\rquote s elbow, laden with merchandise, \lquote not to tell tales about me to these two!\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s three Galleons, nine Sickles and a Knut,\rquote  said Fred, examining the many boxes in Ron\rquote s arms. \lquote Cough up.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m your brother!\rquote 
\par \lquote And that\rquote s our stuff you\rquote re nicking. Three Galleons, nine Sickles. I\rquote ll knock off the Knut.\rquote 
\par \lquote But I haven\rquote t got three Galleons, nine Sickles!\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote d better put it all back then, and mind you put it on the right shelves.\rquote 
\par Ron dropped several boxes, swore and made a rude hand gesture at Fred that was unfortunately spotted by Mrs Weasley, who had chosen that moment to appear.
\par \lquote If I see you do that again I\rquote ll jinx your fingers together,\rquote  she said sharply.
\par \lquote Mum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?\rquote  said Ginny at once.
\par \lquote A what?\rquote  said Mrs Weasley warily.
\par \lquote Look, they\rquote re so sweet ...\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, and Harry, Ron and Hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window. Draco Malfoy was hurrying up the street alone. As he passed Weasleys\rquote  Wizard
 Wheezes, he glanced over his shoulder. Seconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him.
\par \lquote Wonder where his mummy is?\rquote  said Harry, frowning.
\par \lquote Given her the slip by the looks of it,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Why, though?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par H
arry said nothing; he was thinking too hard. Narcissa Malfoy would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly; Malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches. Harry, knowing and loathing Malfoy, was sure the reason cou
ld not be innocent.
\par He glanced around. Mrs Weasley and Ginny were bending over the Pygmy Puffs. Mr Weasley was delightedly examining a pack of Muggle marked playing cards. Fred and George were both helping customers. On the other side of the glass, Hagrid w
as standing with his back to them, looking up and down the street.
\par \lquote Get under here, quick,\rquote  said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag.
\par \lquote Oh \endash  I don\rquote t know, Harry,\rquote  said Hermione, looking uncertainly towards Mrs Weasley.
\par \lquote Come }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 on!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 said Ron.
\par She hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under the Cloak with Harry and Ron. Nobody noticed them vanish; they were all too interested in Fred and George\rquote 
s products. Harry, Ron and Hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could, but by the time they gained the street, Malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had.
\par \lquote He was going in that direction,\rquote  murmured Harry as quietly as possible, so that the humming Hagrid would not hear them. \lquote C\rquote mon.\rquote 
\par They scurried along, peering left and right, through shop windows and doors, until Hermione pointed ahead.
\par \lquote That\rquote s him, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  she whispered. \lquote Turning left?\rquote 
\par \lquote Big surprise,\rquote  whispered Ron.
\par For Malfoy had glanced round, then slid into Knockturn Alley and out of sight.
\par \lquote Quick, or we\rquote ll lose him,\rquote  said Harry, speeding up.
\par \lquote Our feet\rquote ll be seen!\rquote  said Hermione anxiously, as the Cloak flapped a little around their ankles; it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under it nowadays.
\par \lquote It doesn\rquote t matter,\rquote  said Harry impatiently, \lquote just hurry!\rquote 
\par But Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the Dark Arts, looked completely deserted. They peered into windows as they passed, but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all. Harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these d
angerous and suspicious times to buy Dark artefacts \endash  or at least, to be seen buying them.
\par Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch.
\par \lquote Ouch!\rquote 
\par \lquote Shh! Look! He\rquote s in there!\rquote  she breathed in Harry\rquote s ear.
\par They had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley that 
Harry had ever visited: Borgin and Burkes, which sold a wide variety of sinister objects. There in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood Draco Malfoy with his back to them, just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in whi
ch Harry had once hidden to avoid Malfoy and his father. Judging by the movements of Malfoy\rquote 
s hands he was talking animatedly. The proprietor of the shop, Mr Borgin, an oily-haired, stooping man, stood facing Malfoy. He was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear.
\par \lquote If only we could hear what they\rquote re saying!\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote We can!\rquote  said Ron excitedly. \lquote Hang on \endash  damn \endash \rquote 
\par He dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutch\-ing as he fumbled with the largest.
\par \lquote Extendable Ears, look!\rquote 
\par \lquote Fantastic!\rquote  said Hermione, as Ron unravelled the long, flesh-coloured strings and began to feed them towards the bottom of the door. \lquote Oh, I hope the door isn\rquote t Imperturb\-able \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Ron gleefully. \lquote Listen!\rquote 
\par They put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings, through which Malfoy\rquote s voice could be heard loud and clear, as though a radio had been turned on.
\par \lquote ... you know how to fix it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Possibly,\rquote  said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself. \lquote I\rquote ll need to see it, though. Why don\rquote t you bring it into the shop?\rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t,\rquote  said Malfoy. \lquote It\rquote s got to stay put. I just need you to tell me how to do it.\rquote 
\par Harry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously.
\par \lquote Well, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job, perhaps impossible. I couldn\rquote t guarantee anything.\rquote 
\par \lquote No?\rquote  said Malfoy and Harry knew, just by his tone, that Malfoy was sneering. \lquote Perhaps this will make you more confident.\rquote 
\par He moved towards Borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet. Harry, Ron and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very frightened.
\par \lquote Tell anyone,\rquote  said Malfoy, \lquote and there will be retribution. You know Fenrir Greyback? He\rquote s a family friend, he\rquote ll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you\rquote re giving the problem your full attention.
\rquote 
\par \lquote There will be no need for \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll decide that,\rquote  said Malfoy. \lquote Well, I\rquote d better be off. And don\rquote t forget to keep }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 one safe, I\rquote ll need it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Perhaps you\rquote d like to take it now?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, of course I wouldn\rquote t, you stupid little man, how would I look carrying that down the street? Just don\rquote t sell it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course not ... sir.\rquote 
\par Borgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had once seen him give Lucius Malfoy.
\par \lquote Not a word to anyone, Borgin, and that includes my mother, understand?\rquote 
\par \lquote Naturally, naturally,\rquote  murmured Borgin, bowing again.
\par Next moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself. He passed so cl
ose to Harry, Ron and Hermione that they felt the Cloak flutter around their knees again. Inside the shop, Borgin remained frozen; his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked worried.
\par \lquote What was that about?\rquote  whispered Ron, reeling in the Extendable Ears.
\par \lquote Dunno,\rquote  said Harry, thinking hard. \lquote He wants something mended ... and he wants to reserve something in there ... could you see what he pointed at when he said \'93that one\'94?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, he was behind that cabinet \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You two stay here,\rquote  whispered Hermione.
\par \lquote What are you \endash ?\rquote 
\par But Hermione had already ducked out from under the Cloak. She checked her hair in the reflection in the glass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of th
e strings to Harry.
\par \lquote Hello, horrible morning, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  Hermione said brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a suspicious look. Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display.
\par \lquote Is this necklace for sale?\rquote  she asked, pausing beside a glass-fronted case.
\par \lquote If you\rquote ve got one and a half thousand Galleons,\rquote  said Borgin coldly.
\par \lquote Oh \endash  er \endash  no, I haven\rquote t got quite that much,\rquote  said Hermione, walking on. \lquote And ... what about this lovely \endash  um \endash  skull?\rquote 
\par \lquote Sixteen Galleons.\rquote 
\par \lquote So it\rquote s for sale, then? It isn\rquote t being ... kept for anyone?\rquote 
\par Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what Hermione was up to. Apparently Hermione felt she had been rumbled, too, because she suddenly threw caution to the winds.
\par \lquote The thing is, that \endash  er \endash  boy who was in here just now, Draco Malfoy, well, he\rquote s a friend of mine, and I want to get him a birthday present, but if he\rquote s already reserved anything I obviously don\rquote 
t want to get him the same thing, so ... um ...\rquote 
\par It was a pretty lame story in Harry\rquote s opinion, and appar\-ently Borgin thought so too.
\par \lquote Out,\rquote  he said sharply. \lquote Get out!\rquote 
\par Hermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the door with Borgin at her heels. As the bell tinkled again, Borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the \lquote Closed\rquote  sign.
\par \lquote Ah well,\rquote  said Ron, throwing the Cloak back over Hermione. \lquote Worth a try, but you were a bit obvious \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Well, next time you can show me how it\rquote s done, Master of Mystery!\rquote  she snapped.
\par Ron and Hermione bickered all the way back to Weasleys\rquote 
 Wizard Wheezes, where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxious-looking Mrs Weasley and Hagrid, who had clearly noticed their absence. Once in the shop, Harry whipped off the Invisibility Cloak, h
id it in his bag, and joined in with the other two when they insisted, in answer to Mrs Weasley\rquote s accusations, that they had been in the back room all along, and that she could not have looked properly.

\par \lquote Yeah, I do,\rquote  said Harry. When neither Ron nor Hermione answered, he said, \lquote Malfoy\rquote s father\rquote s in Azkaban. Don\rquote t you think Malfoy\rquote d like revenge?\rquote

\par \lquote Malfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?\rquote

\par \lquote Your scar\rquote s not hurting again, is it?\rquote  asked Ron nervously.

\par \lquote In Madam Malkin\rquote s. She didn\rquote t touch him, but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. He\rquote s been branded with the Dark Mark.\rquote 
\par Ron and Hermione looked at each other.
\par \lquote Well ...\rquote  said Ron, sounding thoroughly unconvinced.
\par \lquote I think he just wanted to get out of there, Harry,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote He showed Borgin something we couldn\rquote t see,\rquote  Harry pressed on stubbornly. \lquote Something that seriously scared Borgin. It was the Mark, I know it \endash  he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with, yo

\par Ron and Hermione exchanged another look.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not sure, Harry ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I still don\rquote t reckon You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join ...\rquote 
\par Annoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, Harry snatched up a pile of filthy 
Quidditch robes and left the room; Mrs Weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment. On the landing he bumped into Ginny, who was returning to her room carry\-ing a pile of freshly laundered clothes.

\par \lquote I wouldn\rquote t go in the kitchen just now,\rquote  she warned him. \lquote There\rquote s a lot of Phlegm around.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll be careful not to slip in it,\rquote  smiled Harry.
\par Sure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to find Fleur sitting at the kitchen table, in full flow about plans for her wedding to Bill, while Mrs Weasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling sprouts, looking bad-tempered.
\par \lquote ... Bill and I \rquote ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids, Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer. I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold \endash  pink would of course be \rquote orrible with Ginny\rquote s \rquote air

\par \lquote Ah, Harry!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley loudly, cutting across Fleur\rquote s monologue. \lquote Good, I wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow. We\rquote ve got Ministry
 cars again, and there will be Aurors waiting at the station \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Is Tonks going to be there?\rquote  asked Harry, handing over his Quidditch things.
\par \lquote No, I don\rquote t think so, she\rquote s been stationed somewhere else from what Arthur said.\rquote 
\par \lquote She \rquote as let \rquote erself go, zat Tonks,\rquote  mused Fleur, examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon. \lquote A big mistake, if you ask \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 thank }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you,\rquote 
 said Mrs Weasley tartly, cutting across Fleur again. \lquote You\rquote d better get on, Harry, I want the trunks ready tonight, if possible, so we don\rquote t have the usual last-minute scramble.\rquote 
\par And in fact, their departure the following morning was smoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to the front of The Burrow to find them waiting: trunks packed, Hermione\rquote s cat, Crookshanks, safel
y enclosed in his travelling basket, and Hedwig, Ron\rquote s owl Pigwidgeon, and Ginny\rquote s new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages.
\par \lquote Au revoir, \rquote Arry,\rquote  said Fleur throatily, kissing him goodbye. Ron hurried forwards, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur\rquote 
s feet. Furious, red-faced and dirt-spattered, he hurried into the car without saying goodbye.
\par There was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at King\rquote s Cross Station. Instead, two grim-faced, bearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forwards the moment the cars stopped and, flanking the party, marched them into the station with\-
out speaking.
\par \lquote Quick, quick, through the barrier,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, who seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency. \lquote Harry had better go first, with \endash \rquote 
\par She looked enquiringly at one of the Aurors, who nodded briefly, seized Harry\rquote s upper arm and attempted to steer him towards the barrier between platforms nine and ten.
\par \lquote I can walk, thanks,\rquote  said Harry irritably, jerking his arm out of the Auror\rquote 
s grip. He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent companion, and found himself, a second later, standing on platform nine and three-quarters, where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over the crowd.
\par Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. Without waiting to consult his grim-faced Auror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow him up the plat\-form, looking for an empty compartment.
\par \lquote We can\rquote t, Harry,\rquote  said Hermione, looking apologetic. \lquote Ron and I\rquote ve got to go to the prefect carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yeah, I forgot,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote You\rquote d better get straight on the train, all of you, you\rquote ve only got a few minutes to go,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, consulting her watch. \lquote Well, have a lovely term, Ron ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Mr Weasley, can I have a quick word?\rquote  said Harry, making up his mind on the spur of the moment.
\par \lquote Of course,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, who looked slightly sur\-prised, but followed Harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless.
\par Harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that, if he were to tell anyone, Mr Weasley would be the right person; firstly, because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investi\-
gations, and secondly, because he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr Weasley exploding with anger.
\par He could see Mrs Weasley and the grim-faced Auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away.
\par \lquote When we were in Diagon Alley \endash \rquote  Harry began, but Mr Weasley forestalled him with a grimace.
\par \lquote Am I about to discover where you, Ron and Hermione dis\-appeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and George\rquote s shop?\rquote 
\par \lquote How did you \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, please. You\rquote re talking to the man who raised Fred and George.\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ... yeah, all right, we weren\rquote t in the back room.\rquote 
\par \lquote Very well, then, let\rquote s hear the worst.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my Invisibility Cloak.\rquote 
\par \lquote Did you have any particular reason for doing so, or was it a mere whim?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because I thought Malfoy was up to something,\rquote  said Harry, disregarding Mr Weasley\rquote s look of mingled exasper\-ation and amusement. \lquote He\rquote d given his mother the slip and I wanted to know why.\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course you did,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, sounding resigned. \lquote Well? Did you find out why?\rquote 
\par \lquote He went into Borgin and Burkes,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote and started bullying the bloke in there, Borgin, to help him fix something. And he said he wanted Borgin to keep some
thing else for him. He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing. Like they were a pair. And ...\rquote 
\par Harry took a deep breath.
\par \lquote There\rquote s something else. We saw Malfoy jump about a mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm. I think he\rquote s been branded with the Dark Mark. I think he\rquote s replaced his father as a Death Eater.\rquote 
\par Mr Weasley looked taken aback. After a moment he said, \lquote Harry, I doubt whether You-Know-Who would allow a sixteen-year-old \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Does anyone really know what You-Know-Who would or wouldn\rquote t do?\rquote  asked Harry angrily. \lquote Mr Weasley, I\rquote m sorry, but isn\rquote 
t it worth investigating? If Malfoy wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done, it\rquote s probably something Dark or dangerous, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote I doubt it, to be honest, Harry,\rquote  said Mr Weasley slowly. \lquote You see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, we raided his house. We took away everything that might have been dangerous.\rquote 
\par \lquote I think you missed something,\rquote  said Harry stubbornly.
\par \lquote Well, maybe,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, but Harry could tell that Mr Weasley was humouring him.
\par There was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing.
\par \lquote You\rquote d better hurry,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, as Mrs Weasley cried, \lquote Harry, quickly!\rquote 
\par He hurried forwards and Mr and Mrs Weasley helped him load his trunk on to the train.
\par \lquote Now, dear, you\rquote re coming to us for Christmas, it\rquote s all fixed with Dumbledore, so we\rquote ll see you quite soon,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley through the window, as Harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move. 
\lquote You make sure you look after yourself and \endash \rquote 
\par The train was gathering speed.
\par \lquote \endash  be good and \endash \rquote 
\par She was jogging to keep up now.
\par \lquote \endash  stay safe!\rquote 
\par Harry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr and Mrs Weasley were lost from view, then turned to see where the others had got to. He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the prefect carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the corridor
, chatting to some friends. He made his way towards her, dragging his trunk.
\par People stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him. He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the 
\lquote Chosen One\rquote  rumours in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Daily Prophet, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the shoulder.
\par \lquote Fancy trying to find a compartment?\rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t, Harry, I said I\rquote d meet Dean,\rquote  said Ginny brightly. \lquote See you later.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her. He had become so used to her presence over the summer that 
he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron and Hermione while at school. Then he blinked and looked around: he was surrounded by mesmerised girls.
\par \lquote Hi, Harry!\rquote  said a familiar voice from behind him.
\par \lquote Neville!\rquote  said Harry in relief, turning to see a round-faced boy struggling towards him.
\par \lquote Hello, Harry,\rquote  said a girl with long hair and large, misty eyes, who was just behind Neville.
\par \lquote Luna, hi, how are you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Very well, thank you,\rquote  said Luna. She was clutching a magazine to her chest; large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote The Quibbler }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 still going strong, then?\rquote 
 asked Harry, who felt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given it an exclusive interview the previous year.
\par \lquote Oh yes, circulation\rquote s well up,\rquote  said Luna happily.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s find seats,\rquote  said Harry, and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students. At last they found an empty compartment and Harry hurried inside gratefully.
\par \lquote They\rquote re even staring at }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 us,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
said Neville, indicating himself and Luna, \lquote because we\rquote re with you!\rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote re staring at you because you were at the Ministry, too,\rquote  said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack. \lquote Our little adventure there was all over the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the pub\-licity,\rquote  said Neville, \lquote but she was really pleased. Says I\rquote m start\-ing to live up to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look!\rquote 
\par He pulled it out and showed it to Harry.
\par \lquote Cherry and unicorn hair,\rquote  he said proudly. \lquote We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he vanished next day \endash  oi, come back here, Trevor!\rquote 
\par And he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom.
\par \lquote Are we still doing DA meetings this year, Harry?\rquote  asked Luna, who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 The Quibbler.}{

\par \lquote No point now we\rquote ve got rid of Umbridge, is there?\rquote  said Harry, sitting down. Neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it. He looked most dis\-appointed.
\par \lquote I liked the DA! I learned loads with you!\rquote 
\par \lquote I enjoyed the meetings, too,\rquote  said Luna serenely. \lquote It was like having friends.\rquote 
\par This was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often sa
id and which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could respond, however, there was a disturbance outside their compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of th
e glass.
\par \lquote You ask him!\rquote 
\par \lquote No, you!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll do it!\rquote 
\par And one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes, a prominent chin and long black hair, pushed her way through the door.
\par \lquote Hi, Harry, I\rquote m Romilda, Romilda Vane,\rquote  she said loudly and confidently. \lquote Why don\rquote t you join us in our compartment? You don\rquote t have to sit with }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 them,\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699  she added in a stage whisper, indicating Neville\rquote 
s bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicoloured owl.
\par \lquote They\rquote re friends of mine,\rquote  said Harry coldly.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said the girl, looking very surprised. \lquote Oh. OK.\rquote 
\par And she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her.
\par \lquote People expect you to have cooler friends than us,\rquote  said Luna, once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty.
\par \lquote You are cool,\rquote  said Harry shortly. \lquote None of them was at the Ministry. They didn\rquote t fight with me.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s a very nice thing to say,\rquote  beamed Luna, and she pushed her Spectrespecs further up her nose and settled down to read }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 The Quibbler.}{

\par Harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to O.W.L. results as soon as he could. While Neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a Transfiguration N.E.W.T. with only an \lquote Acceptable\rquote 
, Harry watched him without really listening.
\par Neville\rquote s childhood had been blighted by Voldemort just as much as Harry\rquote s had, but Neville had no idea how close he had come to having Harry\rquote 
s destiny. The prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet, for his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort had chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant.
\par Had Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of the prophecy ... or would it? Would Neville\rquote 
s mother have died to save him, as Lily had died for Harry? Surely she would ... but what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Voldemort? Would there, then, have been no \lquote Chosen One\rquote 
 at all? An empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed goodbye by his own mother, not Ron\rquote s?
\par \lquote You all right, Harry? You look funny,\rquote  said Neville.
\par Harry started.
\par \lquote Sorry \endash  I \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Wrackspurt got you?\rquote  asked Luna sympathetically, peering at Harry through her enormous coloured spectacles.
\par \lquote I \endash  what?\rquote 
\par \lquote A Wrackspurt ... they\rquote re invisible, they float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,\rquote  she said. \lquote I thought I felt one zooming around in here.\rquote 
\par She flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating off large invisible moths. Harry and Neville caught each other\rquote s eye and hastily began to talk of Quidditch.
\par The weather beyond the train windows 
was as patchy as it had been all summer; they passed through stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, clear sunlight. It was during one of the clear spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron and Hermione entered the co
m\-partment at last.
\par \lquote Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I\rquote m starving,\rquote  said Ron longingly, slumping into the seat beside Harry and rub\-bing his stomach. \lquote Hi, Neville, hi, Luna. Guess what?\rquote  he added, turning to Harry. \lquote Malfoy
\rquote s not doing prefect duty. He\rquote s just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we passed.\rquote 
\par Harry sat up straight, interested. It was not like Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect, which he had happily abused all the previous year.
\par \lquote What did he do when he saw you?\rquote 
\par \lquote The usual,\rquote  said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a rude hand gesture. \lquote Not like him, though, is it? Well \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par \lquote Dunno,\rquote  said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didn\rquote t this look as though Malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students?
\par \lquote Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that.\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think so,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote I think he\rquote s \endash \rquote 
\par But before he could expound on his theory, the compart\-ment door slid open again and a breathless third-year girl stepped inside.
\par \lquote I\rquote m supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry P-Potter,\rquote  she faltered, as her eyes met Harry\rquote 
s and she turned scarlet. She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon. Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment.
\par \lquote What is it?\rquote  Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his.
\par \lquote An invitation,\rquote  said Harry.

\par \lquote But what does he want me for?\rquote  asked Neville nervously, as though he were expecting detention.
\par \lquote No idea,\rquote  said Harry, which was not entirely true, though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct. \lquote Listen,\rquote  he added, seized by a sudden brainwave, \lquote let\rquote 
s go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what he\rquote s up to.\rquote 
\par This idea, however, came to nothin
g: the corridors, which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while wearing the Cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all t
he staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every now and then students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into her com\-
partment when she saw Harry coming. As Harry passed the window he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of make\-
up that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on.
\par When they reached compartment C, they saw at once that they were not Slughorn\rquote s only invitees, although judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn\rquote s welcome, Harry was the most warmly anticipated.
\par \lquote Harry, m\rquote boy!\rquote  said Sl
ughorn, jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great silver moustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden buttons on his waistc
oat. \lquote Good to see you, good to see you! And you must be Mr Longbottom!\rquote 
\par Neville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats, which were nearest the door. Harry glanced around at their fel
low guests. He recognised a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not en
tirely sure how she had got there, Ginny.
\par \lquote Now, do you know everyone?\rquote  Slughorn asked Harry and Neville. \lquote Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course \endash \rquote 
\par Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, and nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle.
\par \lquote This is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps you\rquote ve come across each other \endash ? No?\rquote 
\par McLaggen, a large, wire-haired youth, raised a hand and Harry and Neville nodded back at him.
\par \lquote \endash  and this is Marcus Belby, I don\rquote t know whether \endash ?\rquote 
\par Belby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a strained smile.

 Slughorn finished.
\par Ginny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughorn\rquote s back.
\par \lquote Well now, this is most pleasant,\rquote  said Slughorn cosily. \lquote A chance to get to know you all a little better. Here, take a napkin. I\rquote ve packed my own lunch, the trolley, as I remem\-

\par Belby started, and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant.
\par \lquote I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,\rquote  Slughorn told Harry and Neville, now passing around a basket of rolls. \lquote Outst

\par Unfortunately, Belby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he swallowed too fast, turned purple and began to choke.

\par \lquote Not ... not much of him, no,\rquote  gasped Belby, his eyes streaming.
\par \lquote Well, of course, I daresay he\rquote s busy,\rquote  said Slughorn, look\-ing questioningly at Belby. \lquote I doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work!\rquote 
\par \lquote I suppose ...\rquote  said Belby, who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that Slughorn had finished with him. \lquote Er ... he and my dad don\rquote t get on very well, you see, so I don\rquote

\par \lquote Ah, you know Bertie and Rufus, too?\rquote  beamed Slughorn, now offering around a small tray of pies; somehow, Belby was missed out. \lquote Now tell me ...\rquote 
\par It was as Harry had suspected. Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody well-known or influential \endash 
 everyone except Ginny. Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her moun

to begin? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer!\rquote 
\par He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he were a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant, then said, \lquote The \'93Chosen One\'94, they\rquote re calling you now!\rquote 
\par Harry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen and Zabini were all staring at him.
\par \lquote Of course,\rquote  said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, \lquote there have been rumours for years ... I remember when \endash  well \endash  after that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699

\par Zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to indicate amused scepticism. An angry voice burst out from behind Slughorn.
\par \lquote Yeah, Zabini, because }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you\rquote re }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 so talented ... at posing ...\rquote 

\par \lquote Oh dear!\rquote  chuckled Slughorn comfortably, looking round at Ginny who was glaring at Zabini around Slughorn\rquote s great belly. \lquote 
You want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the most marvellous Bat Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I wouldn\rquote t cross her!\rquote 
\par Zabini merely looked contemptuous.
\par \lquote Anyway,\rquote  said Slughorn, turning back to Harry. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Such }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699

\par Harry, who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying, nodded but still said nothing. Slughorn beamed at him.
\par \lquote So modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so fond \endash  you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 were }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699

\par \lquote We never heard a prophecy,\rquote  said Neville, turning geranium-pink as he said it.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Ginny staunchly. \lquote Neville and I were both there too, and all this \'93Chosen One\'94 rubbish is just the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Prophet }{

\par \lquote You were both there too, were you?\rquote  said Slughorn with great interest, looking from Ginny to Neville, but both of them sat clamlike before his encouraging smile. \lquote Yes ... well ... it is true that the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 often exaggerates, of course ...\rquote  Slughorn continued, sounding a little disappointed. 
\lquote I re\-member dear Gwenog telling me \endash  Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the Holyhead Harpies \endash \rquote 
\par He meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, but Harry had the distinct impression that Slughorn had not finished with him, and that he had not been convinced by Neville and Ginny.
\par The afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustri\-ous wizards Slughorn had taught, all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the \lquote Slug Club\rquote  at Hogwarts. Harry could not wait to leave, but couldn\rquote t see how t
o do so politely. Finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in the twilight.
\par \lquote Good gracious, it\rquote s getting dark already! I didn\rquote t notice that they\rquote d lit the lamps! You\rquote d better go and change into your robes, all of you. McLaggen, you must drop by and borrow that book on Nogtails. Harry, Blaise 
\endash  any time you\rquote re passing. Same goes for you, miss,\rquote  he twinkled at Ginny. \lquote Well, off you go, off you go!\rquote 
\par As he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor, Zabini shot him a filthy look that Harry returned with interest. He, Ginny and Neville followed Zabini back along the train.
\par \lquote I\rquote m glad that\rquote s over,\rquote  muttered Neville. \lquote Strange man, isn\rquote t he?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, he is a bit,\rquote  said Harry, his eyes on Zabini. \lquote How come you ended up in there, Ginny?\rquote 
\par \lquote He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,\rquote  said Ginny, \lquote you remem\-ber that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the DA? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him \endash 
 when Slughorn came in I thought I was going to get detention, but he just thought it was a really good hex and invited me to lunch! Mad, eh?\rquote 
\par \lquote Better reason for inviting someone than because their mother\rquote s famous,\rquote  said Harry, scowling at the back of Zabini\rquote s head, \lquote or because their uncle \endash \rquote 
\par But he broke off. An idea had just occurred to him, a reck\-less but potentially wonderful idea ... in a minute\rquote s time, Zabini was going to re-enter the Slytherin sixth-year com\-partment and Malfoy would be sit
ting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow Slytherins ... if Harry could only enter, unseen, behind him, what might he not see or hear? True, there was little of the journey left \endash 
 Hogsmeade station had to be less than half an hour away, judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows \endash  but nobody else seemed prepared to take Harry\rquote s suspicions seriously, so it was down to him to prove them.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll see you two later,\rquote  said Harry under his breath, pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over himself.
\par \lquote But what\rquote re you \endash ?\rquote  asked Neville.
\par \lquote Later!\rquote  whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as quietly as possible, though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless.
\par The corridors were almost completely empty 
now. Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions. Though he was as close as he could get to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when Zabin
i opened the door. Zabini was already sliding it shut when Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing.
\par \lquote What\rquote s wrong with this thing?\rquote  said Zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harry\rquote s foot.
\par Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyle\rquote s lap and, in the ensuing ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt on to Zabini\rquote 
s temporarily empty seat and hoisted himself up into the luggage ra
ck. It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes on to them, for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the Cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw Mal
foy\rquote 
s eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upwards out of sight; but then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him, Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic and Malfoy, sniggering, lay back down a
cross two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinson\rquote s lap. Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the Cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy\rquote 
s forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene: Harry could read every word of Crabbe\rquote s comic directly below him.

\par \lquote So, Zabini,\rquote  said Malfoy, \lquote what did Slughorn want?\rquote 
\par \lquote Just trying to make up to well-connected people,\rquote  said Zabini, who was still glowering at Goyle. \lquote Not that he man\-aged to find many.\rquote 
\par This information did not seem to please Malfoy.
\par \lquote Who else had he invited?\rquote  he demanded.
\par \lquote McLaggen from Gryffindor,\rquote  said Zabini.
\par \lquote Oh yeah, his uncle\rquote s big in the Ministry,\rquote  said Malfoy.
\par \lquote \endash  someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Not him, he\rquote s a prat!\rquote  said Pansy.
\par \lquote \endash  and Longbottom, Potter and that Weasley girl,\rquote  finished Zabini.
\par Malfoy sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansy\rquote s hand aside.
\par \lquote He invited }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Longbottom?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote Well, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,\rquote  said Zabini indifferently.
\par \lquote What\rquote s Longbottom got to interest Slughorn?\rquote 
\par Zabini shrugged.
\par \lquote Potter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Chosen One,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 sneered Malfoy, \lquote but that Weasley girl! What\rquote s so special about }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 her?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote A lot of boys like her,\rquote  said Pansy, watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. \lquote Even you think she\rquote s good-looking, don\rquote t you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please!\rquote 
\par \lquote I wouldn\rquote t touch a filthy little blood traitor like her what\-ever she looked like,\rquote  said Zabini coldly, and Pansy looked pleased. Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair.
\par \lquote Well, I pity Slughorn\rquote s taste. Maybe he\rquote s going a bit senile. Shame, my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a favourite of his. Slughorn probably hasn\rquote t heard I\rquote 
m on the train, or \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I wouldn\rquote t bank on an invitation,\rquote  said Zabini. \lquote He asked me about Nott\rquote s father when I first arrived. They used to be old friends, apparently, but when he heard he\rquote d been caught at the Ministry he didn\rquote 
t look happy, and Nott didn\rquote t get an invitation, did he? I don\rquote t think Slughorn\rquote s interested in Death Eaters.\rquote 
\par Malfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly humour\-less laugh.
\par \lquote Well, who cares what he\rquote s interested in? What is he, when you come down to it? Just some stupid teacher.\rquote  Malfoy yawned ostentatiously. \lquote I mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year, what\rquote 
s it matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or not?\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts next year?\rquote  said Pansy indignantly, ceasing grooming Malfoy at once.
\par \lquote Well, you never know,\rquote  said Malfoy with the ghost of a smirk. \lquote I might have \endash  er \endash  moved on to bigger and better things.\rquote 
\par Crouched in the luggage rack under his Cloak, Harry\rquote s heart began to race. What would Ron and Hermione say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; appar\-ently they had had no inkling o
f any plans to move on to bigger and better things. Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy\rquote s hair, looking dumbfounded.
\par \lquote Do you mean \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Him?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par Malfoy shrugged.
\par \lquote Mother wants me to complete my education, but person\-ally, I don\rquote t see it as that important these days. I mean, think about it ... when the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many O.W.L.s or N.E.W.T.s anyone\rquote 
s got? Of course he isn\rquote t ... it\rquote ll be all about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was shown.\rquote 
\par \lquote And you think }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you\rquote ll }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 be able to do something for him?\rquote 
 asked Zabini scathingly. \lquote Sixteen years old and not even fully qualified yet?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve just said, haven\rquote t I? Maybe he doesn\rquote t care if I\rquote m quali\-fied. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn\rquote t something that you need to be qualified for,\rquote  said Malfoy quietly.
\par Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so awe-inspiring.
\par \lquote I can see Hogwarts,\rquote  said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. \lquote We\rquote d better get our robes on.\rquote 
\par Harry was so busy staring at Malfoy he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning.
\par Harry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hidi
ng under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the Cloak, and waited, breath held. To his relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined 
the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, locked his trunk and, as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened a thick new travel\-ling cloak round his neck.
\par Harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out on to the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the com\-
partment had quite emptied. At last, with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out into a crowd of second-years, punching them aside; Crabbe and Zabini followed.
\par \lquote You go on,\rquote  Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it. \lquote I just want to check something.\rquote 
\par Pansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the com\-partme
nt. People were filing past, descending on to the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again.
\par Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy wanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend?
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Petrificus Totalus!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par Without warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was instantly paralysed. As though in slow motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonising, floor-shaking crash, at Malfoy\rquote 
s feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position. He couldn\rquote t move a muscle; he could only gaze up at Malfoy, who smiled broadly.
\par \lquote I thought so,\rquote  he said jubilantly. \lquote I heard Goyle\rquote s trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back ...\rquote  His eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry\rquote s trainers. 
\lquote That was you blocking the door when Zabini came back in, I suppose?\rquote 
\par He considered Harry for a moment.
\par \lquote You didn\rquote t hear anything I care about, Potter. But while I\rquote ve got you here ...\rquote 
\par And he stamped, hard, on Harry\rquote s face. Harry felt his nose break; blood spurted everywhere.
\par \lquote That\rquote s from my father. Now, let\rquote s see ...\rquote 
\par Malfoy dragged the Cloak out from under Harry\rquote s immobil\-ised body and threw it over him.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t reckon they\rquote ll find you till the train\rquote s back in London,\rquote  he said quietly. \lquote See you around, Potter ... or not.\rquote

Harry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond. His immediate thought was that some\-one, surely, wo
uld check the compartments before the train departed again? But at once came the dispiriting realisation that even if somebody looked into the compartment, he would be neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on 
him.

Harry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth. What a stupid situation to have landed himself in ... and now the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone wa
s shuffling along the dark platform outside; he could hear the scraping of trunks and the loud babble of talk.
\par Ron and Hermione would think that he had left the train without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places in the Great Hall, look
ed up and down the Gryffindor table a few times and finally realised that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be halfway back to London.
\par He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible. Then he remembered that some wizards, like Dumbledore, could perform spells without speaking, so he tried to Summon his wand, which had fallen out of his hand, by saying the words }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Accio wand! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 over and over again in his head, but noth\-ing happened.
\par He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that sur\-ro
unded the lake, and the far-off hoot of an owl, but no hint of a search being made, or even (he despised himself slightly for hoping it) panicked voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone. A feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the
 convoy of Thestral-drawn carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy was riding in, where he would be recounting his attack on Harry to his fellow Slytherins.
\par The train lurched, causing Harr
y to roll over on to his side. Now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life. The Express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it ...
\par Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said, \lquote Wotcher, Harry.\rquote 
\par There was a flash of red light and Harry\rquote s body unfroze; he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting pos\-ition, hastily wipe the blood off his bruise
d face with the back of his hand and raise his head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the Invisibility Cloak she had just pulled away.
\par \lquote We\rquote d better get out of here, quickly,\rquote  she said, as the train windows became obscured with steam and the train began to move out of the station. \lquote Come on, we\rquote ll jump.\rquote 
\par Harry hurried after her into the corridor. Tonks pulled open the train door and leapt on to the platform, which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum. Harry followed her, stag
gered a little on landing, then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, round the corner and disappear from view.
\par The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently, she handed him back the Invisibility Cloak.
\par \lquote Who did it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Draco Malfoy,\rquote  said Harry bitterly. \lquote Thanks for ... well ...\rquote 
\par \lquote No problem,\rquote  said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry could see in the darkness, she was as mousy-haired and miserable-looking as she had been when he had met her at The Burrow. \lquote I can fix your nose if you stand still.\rquote 

\par Harry did not think much of this idea; he had been intend\-ing to visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to Healing spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so he stayed stock-still and closed his eyes.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Episkey,\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699  said Tonks.
\par Harry\rquote s nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He raised a hand and felt it gingerly. It seemed to be mended.
\par \lquote Thanks a lot!\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote d better put that Cloak back on, and we can walk up to the school,\rquote  said Tonks, still unsmiling. As Harry swung the Cloak back over himself she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creatu
re erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness.
\par \lquote Was that a Patronus?\rquote  asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore send messages like this.
\par \lquote Yes, I\rquote m sending word to the castle that I\rquote ve got you, or they\rquote ll worry. Come on, we\rquote d better not dawdle.\rquote 
\par They set off towards the lane that led to the school.
\par \lquote How did you find me?\rquote 
\par \lquote I noticed you hadn\rquote t left the train and I knew you had that Cloak. I thought you might be hiding for some reason. When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought I\rquote d check.\rquote 
\par \lquote But what are you doing here, anyway?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote I\rquote m stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school extra protection,\rquote  said Tonks.
\par \lquote Is it just you who\rquote s stationed up here, or \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, Proudfoot, Savage and Dawlish are here too.\rquote 
\par \lquote Dawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s right.\rquote 
\par They trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the freshly made carriage tracks. Harry looked sideways at Tonks under his Cloak. Last year she had been inquisitive (to the point of being a little an
noying at times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. Now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful. Was this all the effect of what had happened at the Ministry? He reflected uncomfortably that Hermione would have suggested he say som
ething con\-soling about Sirius to her, that it hadn\rquote t been her fault at all, but he couldn\rquote t bring himself to do it. He was far from blaming her for Sirius\rquote s death; it was no more her fault than anyone else\rquote 
s (and much less than his), but he did not like talking about Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they tramped on through the cold night in silence, Tonks\rquote s long cloak whis\-pering on the ground behind them.
\par Having always travelled there by carriage, Harry had never before appreciated just how far Hogwarts
 was from Hogsmeade station. With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each topped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was hungry, and he was quite keen to leave this new, gloomy Tonks behind. But when he put out a han
d to push open the gates, he found them chained shut.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Alohomora!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
he said confidently, pointing his wand at the padlock, but nothing happened.
\par \lquote That won\rquote t work on these,\rquote  said Tonks. \lquote Dumbledore bewitched them himself.\rquote 
\par Harry looked around.
\par \lquote I could climb a wall,\rquote  he suggested.
\par \lquote No, you couldn\rquote t,\rquote  said Tonks flatly. \lquote Anti-intruder jinxes on all of them. Security\rquote s been tightened a hundredfold this summer.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well then,\rquote  said Harry, starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness, \lquote I suppose I\rquote ll just have to sleep out here and wait for morning.\rquote 
\par \lquote Someone\rquote s coming down for you,\rquote  said Tonks. \lquote Look.\rquote 
\par A lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle. Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure Filch\rquote s wheezy criticisms of 
his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews. It was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them, and Harry had pulled off his Invisibility Cloak so that he could be seen, t
hat he recognised, with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose and long, black, greasy hair of Severus Snape.
\par \lquote Well, well, well,\rquote  sneered Snape, taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once, so that the chains snaked back\-wards and the gates creaked open. \lquote 
Nice of you to turn up, Potter, although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance.\rquote 
\par \lquote I couldn\rquote t change, I didn\rquote t have my \endash \rquote  Harry began, but Snape cut across him.
\par \lquote There is no need to wait, Nymphadora. Potter is quite \endash  ah \endash  safe in my hands.\rquote 
\par \lquote I meant Hagrid to get the message,\rquote  said Tonks, frowning.
\par \lquote Hagrid was late for the start-of-term feast, just like Potter here, so I took it instead. And incidentally,\rquote  said Snape, stand\-ing back to allow Harry to pass him, \lquote I was interested to see your new Patronus.\rquote 
\par He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again, so that they slithered, clink\-ing, back into place.
\par \lquote I think you were better off with the old one,\rquote  said Snape, the malice in his voice unmistakeable. \lquote The new one looks weak.\rquote 
\par As Snape swung the lantern about Harry saw, fleetingly, a look of shock and anger on Tonks\rquote s face. Then she was covered in darkness once more.
\par \lquote Goodnight,\rquote  Harry called to her over his shoulder, as he began the walk up to the school with Snape. \lquote Thanks for ... everything.\rquote 
\par \lquote See you, Harry.\rquote 
\par Snape did not speak for a minute or so. Harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that Snape could not feel them burn\-
ing him. He had loathed Snape from their first encounter, but Snape had placed himself for ever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harry\rquote s forgiveness by his attitude towards Sirius. Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry 
had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that Snape\rquote 
s snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the 
Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkn
ess.
\par \lquote Fifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote And, let me see, another twenty for your Muggle attire. You know, I don\rquote t believe any house has ever been in negative figures this early in the term \endash 
 we haven\rquote t even started pudding. You might have set a record, Potter.\rquote 
\par The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze white-hot, but he would rather have been immo\-bilised all the way back to London than tell Snape why he was late.
\par \lquote I suppose you wanted to make an entrance, did you?\rquote  Snape continued. \lquote And with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect.\rquote 
\par Still Harry remained silent, though he thought his chest might explode. He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he could needle and tor\-ment Harry without anyone else listening.
\par They reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open on to the vast flagged Entrance Hall, a burst of 
talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the Great Hall. Harry wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, incon
veniently, was the furthest from the Entrance Hall) without being noticed.
\par As though he had read Harry\rquote s mind, however, Snape said, \lquote No Cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees you, which is what you wanted, I\rquote m sure.\rquote 
\par Harry turned on the spot and march
ed straight through the open doors: anything to get away from Snape. The Great Hall, with its four long house tables and its staff table set at the top of the room, was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow. 
It was all a shimmer\-
ing blur to Harry, however, who walked so fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to stare, and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him, he had spotted Ron and Hermione, sped along 
the benches towards them and forced his way in between them.
\par \lquote Where\rquote ve you \endash  blimey, what\rquote ve you done to your face?\rquote  said Ron, goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity.
\par \lquote Why, what\rquote s wrong with it?\rquote  said Harry, grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection.
\par \lquote You\rquote re covered in blood!\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Come here \endash \rquote 
\par She raised her wand, said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Tergeo!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 and siphoned off the dried blood.

\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  said Harry, feeling his now clean face. \lquote How\rquote s my nose looking?\rquote 
\par \lquote Normal,\rquote  said Hermione anxiously. \lquote Why shouldn\rquote t it? Harry, what happened, we\rquote ve been terrified!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll tell you later,\rquote  said Harry curtly. He was very conscious that Ginny, Neville, Dean and Seamus were listening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop.
\par \lquote But \endash \rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Not now, Hermione,\rquote  said Harry, in a darkly significant voice. He hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic, preferably involving a couple 
of Death Eaters and a Dementor. Of course, Malfoy would spread the story as far and wide as he could, but there was always a chance it wouldn\rquote t reach too many Gryffindor ears.
\par He reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful of chips, but before he could take them they van\-ished, to be replaced with puddings.
\par \lquote You missed the Sorting, anyway,\rquote  said Hermione, as Ron dived for a large chocolate gateau.
\par \lquote Hat say anything interesting?\rquote  asked Harry, taking a piece of treacle tart.
\par \lquote More of the same, really ... advising us all to unite in the face of our enemies, you know.\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the feast, doesn\rquote t he? It can\rquote t be long now.\rquote 
\par \lquote Snape said Hagrid was late for the feast \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote ve seen Snape? How come?\rquote  said Ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau.
\par \lquote Bumped into him,\rquote  said Harry evasively.
\par \lquote Hagrid was only a few minutes late,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Look, he\rquote s waving at you, Harry.\rquote 
\par Harry looked up at the staff table an
d grinned at Hagrid, who was indeed waving at him. Hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere between Hagrid\rquote 
s elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side, and who was looking disap\-proving at this enthusiastic greeting. Harry was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, sitting on Hagrid\rquote 
s other side; she rarely left her tower room and he had never seen her at 
the start-of-term feast before. She looked as odd as ever, glittering with beads and trailing shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles. Having always considered her a bit of a fraud, Harry had been shocked to discover at the end of th
e previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harry\rquote 
s parents and attack Harry himself. The knowledge had made him even less eager to find himself in her company, but thankfully, this year he would be dr
opping Divination. Her great beacon-like eyes swivelled in his direction; he hastily looked away towards the Slytherin table. Draco Malfoy was miming the shattering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause. Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, hi
s insides burning again. What he would not give to fight Malfoy one on one ...
\par \lquote So what did Professor Slughorn want?\rquote  Hermione asked.
\par \lquote To know what really happened at the Ministry,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Him and everyone else here,\rquote  sniffed Hermione. \lquote People were interrogating us about it on the train, weren\rquote t they, Ron?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote All wanting to know if you really are the Chosen One \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts,\rquote  interrupted Nearly Headless Nick, in\-clining his barely connected head towards Harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff. \lquote 
I am considered something of a Potter authority; it is widely known that we are friendly. I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information, however. \'93Harry Potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence,
\'94 I told them. \'93I would rather die than betray his trust.\'94\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s not saying much, seeing as you\rquote re already dead,\rquote  Ron observed.
\par \lquote Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,\rquote 
 said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air and glided back towards the far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table. The talk and laughter echoing around the Hall died away almost
 instantly.
\par \lquote The very best of evenings to you!\rquote  he said, smiling broadly, his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room.
\par \lquote What happened to his hand?\rquote  gasped Hermione.
\par She was not the only one who had noticed. Dumbledore\rquote s right hand was as blackened and dead-looking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch Harry from the Dursleys\rquote .
\par Whispers swept the room; Dumbledore, interpreting them correctly, merely smiled and shook his purple and gold sleeve over his injury.
\par \lquote Nothing to worry about,\rquote  he said airily. \lquote Now ... to our new students, welcome; to our old students, welcome back! Another year full of magical education awaits you ...\rquote 
\par \lquote His hand was like that when I saw him over the summer,\rquote  Harry whispered to Hermione. \lquote I thought he\rquote d have cured it by now, though ... or Madam Pomfrey would\rquote ve done.\rquote 
\par \lquote It looks as if it\rquote s died,\rquote  said Hermione, with a nauseated expression. \lquote But there are some injuries you can\rquote t cure ... old curses ... and there are poisons without antidotes ...\rquote 
\par \lquote ... and Mr Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called Weasleys\rquote  Wizard Wheezes.
\par \lquote Those wishing to play for their house Quidditch teams should give their names to their Heads of House as usual. We are also looking for new Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise.
\par \lquote We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year. Professor Slughorn,\rquote  Slughorn stood up, his bald head gleaming in the candlelight, his big waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow, \lquote 
is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.\rquote 
\par \lquote Potions?\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Potions?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had heard right.
\par \lquote Potions?\rquote  said Ron and Hermione together, turning to stare at Harry. \lquote But you said \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Professor Snape, meanwhile,\rquote  said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it carried over all the muttering, \lquote will be taking over the position of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.\rquote 
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He did not care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be given the Defence Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn\rquote 
t it been widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to do it?
\par \lquote But, Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts!\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote I thought he was!\rquote  said Harry, racking his brains to remember when Dumbledore had told him this, but now that he came to think of it, he was unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn would be teaching.
\par Snape, who was sitting on Dumbledore\rquote s right, did not stand up at the mention of his name, merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgement of the applause from th
e Slytherin table, yet Harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much.
\par \lquote Well, there\rquote s one good thing,\rquote  he said savagely. \lquote Snape\rquote ll be gone by the end of the year.\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you mean?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote That job\rquote s jinxed. No one\rquote s lasted more than a year ... Quirrell actually died doing it. Personally, I\rquote m going to keep my fingers crossed for another death ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  said Hermione, shocked and reproachful.
\par \lquote He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year,\rquote  said Ron reasonably. \lquote That Slughorn bloke might not want to stay long-term, Moody didn\rquote t.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore cleared his throat. Harry, Ron and Hermione were not the only ones who had been talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that Snape had finally achieved his heart\rquote 
s desire. Seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted, Dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointments, but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing.
\par \lquote Now, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord Voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength.\rquote 
\par The silence seemed to tauten and strain as Dumbledore spoke. Harry glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy was not looking at Dumbledore, but making his fork hover in midair with his wand, as though he found the Headmaster\rquote s words unworthy of his attention.

\par \lquote I cannot emphasise strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is, and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe. The castle\rquote 
s magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer, we are protected in new and more powerful ways, but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff. I 
urge you, therefore, to abide by any security restrictions that your teachers might impose upon you, however irksome you might find them \endash 
 in particular, the rule that you are not to be out of bed after hours. I implore you, should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle, to report it to a member of staff immediately. I trust you to conduct your\-
selves, always, with the utmost regard for your own and each other\rquote s safety.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore\rquote s blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once more.
\par \lquote But now, your beds await, as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish, and I know that your top priority is to be well-rested for your lessons tomorrow. Let us therefore say goodnight. Pip pip!\rquote 
\par With the usual deafening scraping
 noise, the benches were moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the Great Hall towards their dormitories. Harry, who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd, nor to get near enough to Malfoy to allow him to retell the 
story of the nose-stamping, lagged behind, pretending to retie the lace on his trainer, allowing most of the Gryffindors to draw ahead of him. Hermione had darted ahead to fulfil her prefect\rquote 
s duty of shepherding the first-years, but Ron remained with Harry.
\par \lquote What really happened to your nose?\rquote  he asked, once they were at the very back of the throng pressing out of the Hall, and out of earshot of anyone else.
\par Harry told him. It was a mark of the strength of their friendship that Ron did not laugh.
\par \lquote I saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose,\rquote  he said darkly.
\par \lquote Yeah, well, never mind that,\rquote  said Harry bitterly. \lquote Listen to what he was saying before he found out I was there ...\rquote 
\par Harry had expected Ron to be stunned by Malfoy\rquote s boasts. With what Harry considered pure pigheadedness, however, Ron was unimpressed.
\par \lquote Come on, Harry, he was just showing off for Parkinson ... what kind of mission would You-Know-Who have given him?\rquote 
\par \lquote How d\rquote you know Voldemort doesn\rquote t need someone at Hogwarts? It wouldn\rquote t be the first \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I wish yeh\rquote d stop sayin\rquote  tha\rquote  name, Harry,\rquote  said a reproach\-ful voice behind them. Harry looked over his shoulder to see Hagrid shaking his head.
\par \lquote Dumbledore uses that name,\rquote  said Harry stubbornly.
\par \lquote Yeah, well, tha\rquote s Dumbledore, innit?\rquote  said Hagrid mysteri\-ously. \lquote So how come yeh were late, Harry? I was worried.\rquote 
\par \lquote Got held up on the train,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Why were }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 late?
\rquote 
\par \lquote I was with Grawp,\rquote  said Hagrid happily. \lquote Los\rquote  track o\rquote  the time. He\rquote s got a new home up in the mountains now, Dumbledore fixed it \endash  nice big cave. He\rquote 
s much happier than he was in the Forest. We were havin\rquote  a good chat.\rquote 
\par \lquote Really?\rquote  said Harry, taking care not to catch Ron\rquote s eye; the last time he had met Hagrid\rquote s half-brother, a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees b
y the roots, his vocabulary had comprised five words, two of which he was unable to pronounce properly.
\par \lquote Oh yeah, he\rquote s really come on,\rquote  said Hagrid proudly. \lquote Yeh\rquote ll be amazed. I\rquote m thinkin\rquote  o\rquote  trainin\rquote  him up as me assistant.\rquote 
\par Ron snorted loudly, but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze. They were now standing beside the oak front doors.
\par \lquote Anyway, I\rquote ll see yeh tomorrow, firs\rquote  lesson\rquote s straight after lunch. Come early an\rquote  yeh can say hello ter Buck\emdash  I mean, Witherwings!\rquote 
\par Raising an arm in cheery farewell, he headed out of the front doors into the darkness.
\par Harry and Ron looked at each other. Harry could tell that Ron was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself.
\par \lquote You\rquote re not taking Care of Magical Creatures, are you?\rquote 
\par Ron shook his head.
\par \lquote And you\rquote re not either, are you?\rquote 
\par Harry shook his head, too.
\par \lquote And Hermione,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote she\rquote s not, is she?\rquote 
\par Harry shook his head again. Exactly what Hagrid would say when he realised his three favourite students had given up his subject, he did not like to think.

s remark highly amusing. She continued to laugh as she passed them, glancing back at Ron over her shoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself.
\par The ceiling of the Great Hall was serene
ly blue and streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows. While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, Harry and Ron told Hermione about their embarrassing conversation with Hagrid the p
revious evening.
\par \lquote But he can\rquote t really think we\rquote d continue Care of Magical Creatures!\rquote  she said, looking distressed. \lquote I mean, when has any of us expressed ... you know ... any enthusiasm?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s it, though, innit?\rquote  said Ron, swallowing an entire fried egg whole. \lquote We were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid. But he thinks we liked the stupid }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Neither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no need. They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue Care of Magical Creatures. They avoided Hagrid\rquote 
s eye and returned his cheery wave only half-heartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later.
\par After they had eaten, they remained in their places, await\-ing Professor McGonagall\rquote 
s descent from the staff table. The distribution of timetables was more complicated than usual this year, for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue with their chosen N.E.W.T.s.

\par Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes and Potions, and shot off to a first-period Ancient Runes class without further ado. Ne
ville took a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious as Professor McGonagall looked down his application and then consulted his O.W.L. results.
\par \lquote Herbology, fine,\rquote  she said. \lquote Professor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an \'93Outstanding\'94 O.W.L. And you qualify for Defence Against the Dark Arts with \'93Exceeds Expectations\'94
. But the problem is Transfiguration. I\rquote m sorry, Longbottom, but an \'93Acceptable\'94 really isn\rquote t good enough to continue to N.E.W.T. level, I just don\rquote t think you\rquote d be able to cope with the coursework.\rquote 
\par Neville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered at him through her square spectacles.
\par \lquote Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration, any\-way? I\rquote ve never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it.\rquote 
\par Neville looked miserable and muttered something about \lquote my grandmother wants\rquote .
\par \lquote Humph,\rquote  snorted Professor McGonagall. \lquote It\rquote s high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she\rquote s got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have \endash  particu\-
larly after what happened at the Ministry.\rquote 
\par Neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor McGonagall had never paid him a compliment before.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my N.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an \'93Exceeds Expectations\'94 in Charms, however \endash  why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?\rquote 
\par \lquote My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,\rquote  mumbled Neville.
\par \lquote Take Charms,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, \lquote and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 her }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.\rquote  Smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on Neville\rquote 
s face, Professor McGonagall tapped a blank timetable with the tip of her wand and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to Neville.
\par Professor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, whose first question was whether Firenze, the handsome centaur, was still teaching Divination.
\par \lquote He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, a hint of dis\-approval in her voice; it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of Divination. \lquote 
The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney.\rquote 
\par Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen.
\par \lquote So, Potter, Potter ...\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, consulting her notes as she turned to Harry. \lquote 
Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration ... all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why haven\rquote 
t you applied to continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?\rquote 
\par \lquote It was, but you told me I had to get an \'93Outstanding\'94 in my O.W.L., Professor.\rquote 
\par \lquote And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject. Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with \'93Exceeds Expectations\'94 at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but I didn\rquote t buy the books or any ingredi\-ents or anything \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote Very well, Potter, here is your time\-table. Oh, by the way \endash 
 twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure.\rquote 
\par A few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same sub\-jects as Harry, and the two of them left the table together.
\par \lquote Look,\rquote  said Ron delightedly, gazing at his timetable, \lquote we\rquote ve got a free period now ... and a free period after break ... and after lunch ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 excellent!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par They returned to the common room, which was empty apart from half a dozen seventh-years including Katie Bell, the only remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in his first year.
\par \lquote I thought you\rquote d get that, well done,\rquote  she called over, point\-ing at the Captain\rquote s badge on Harry\rquote s chest. \lquote Tell me when you call trials!\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be stupid,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote you don\rquote t need to try out, I\rquote ve watched you play for five years ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You mustn\rquote t start off like that,\rquote  she said warningly. \lquote For all you know, there\rquote 
s someone much better than me out there. Good teams have been ruined before now because captains just kept playing the old faces, or letting in their friends ...\rquote 
\par Ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the fourth-year. It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry. Crookshanks\rquote 
s yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close.
\par An hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below. Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of heavy books and looking put-upon.
\par \lquote We got so much homework for Runes,\rquote  she said anxiously, when Harry and Ron joined her. \lquote A fifteen-inch essay, two translations and I\rquote ve got to read these by Wednesday!\rquote 
\par \lquote Shame,\rquote  yawned Ron.
\par \lquote You wait,\rquote  she said resentfully. \lquote I bet Snape gives us loads.\rquote 
\par The classroom door opened as she spoke and Snape stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately.
\par \lquote Inside,\rquote  he said.
\par Harry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his personality upon 
the room already; it was gloomier than usual as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted b
ody parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.
\par \lquote I have not asked you to take out your books,\rquote  said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

I wish to speak to you and I want your fullest attention.\rquote 
\par His black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harry\rquote s than anyone else\rquote s.
\par \lquote You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 You believe ... like you haven\rquote t watched them all come and go, Snape, hoping you\rquote d be next, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 thought Harry scathingly.
\par \lquote Naturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities. Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O.W.L. in this subject. I shall be even more surprised if all of you m
anage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will be much more advanced.\rquote 
\par Snape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view.
\par \lquote The Dark Arts,\rquote  said Snape, \lquote are many, varied, ever-cha
nging and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.\rquote 
\par Harry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?
\par \lquote Your defences,\rquote  said Snape, a little louder, \lquote must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the Arts you seek to undo. These pictures,\rquote  he indicated a few of them as he swept past, \lquote 
give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse\rquote  (he waved a hand towards a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony) \lquote feel the Dementor\rquote s Kiss\rquote 
 (a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed slumped against a wall) \lquote or provoke the aggression of the Inferius\rquote  (a bloody mass upon the ground).
\par \lquote Has an Inferius been seen, then?\rquote  said Parvati Patil in a high-pitched voice. \lquote Is it definite, is he using them?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,\rquote  said Snape, \lquote which means you would be well-advised to assume he might use them again. Now ...\rquote 
\par He set off again around the other side of the classroom towards his desk, and again, the class watched him as he walked, his dark robes billowing behind him.
\par \lquote ... you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of non-verbal spells. What is the advantage of a non-verbal spell?\rquote 
\par Hermione\rquote s hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, \lquote Very well \endash  Miss Granger?\rquote 
\par \lquote Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you\rquote re about to perform,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote which gives you a split-second advantage.\rquote 
\par \lquote An answer copied almost word for word from }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 6,\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699  said Snape dismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy sniggered), \lquote 
but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress to using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell-casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concen\-tration and mind power which some,
\rquote  his gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more, \lquote lack.\rquote 
\par Harry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year. He refused to drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away.
\par \lquote You will now divide,\rquote  Snape went on, \lquote into pairs. One partner will attempt to jinx the other }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 without speaking. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Carry on.\rquote 
\par Although Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at least half the class (everyone who had been a member of the DA) how to perform a Shield Charm the previous year. None of them had ever cast the Charm without speaking, however. A reasonabl
e amount of cheating ensued; many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. Typically, ten minutes into the lesson Hermione managed to repel Neville\rquote 
s muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that woul
d surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher, thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored. He swept between them as they practised, looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and R
on struggling with the task.
\par Ron, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation. Harry had his wand raised, waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx t
hat seemed unlikely ever to come.
\par \lquote Pathetic, Weasley,\rquote  said Snape, after a while. \lquote Here \endash  let me show you \endash \rquote 
\par He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of non-verbal spells forgotten he yelled, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Protego!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked round and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling.
\par \lquote Do you remember me telling you we are practising }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 non-verbal }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 spells, Potter?

\par The words had escaped him before he knew what he was say\-ing. Several people gasped, including Hermione. Behind Snape, however, Ron, Dean and Seamus grinned appreciatively.
\par \lquote Detention, Saturday night, my office,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote I do not take cheek from anyone, Potter ... not even the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Chosen One.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par He, Ron and Hermione spent the whole of break speculat\-
ing on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know Hermione said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that Dumble\-
dore wanted to teach Harry advanced defensive magic. After break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room, where they grudgingly started Snape\rquote s homework. This turned out to be so complex th
at they still had not finished when Hermione joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process). They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoon\rquote 
s double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long, been Snape\rquote s.
\par When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but 
four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner.
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand as Harry approached, \lquote didn\rquote t 
get a chance to speak in Defence Against the Dark Arts this morning. Good lesson, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of course, for us old DA lags ... and how are you, Ron \endash  Hermione?\rquote 
\par Before they could say more than \lquote fine\rquote , the dungeon door opened and Slughorn\rquote 
s belly preceded him out of the door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus moustache curved above his beaming mouth and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm.
\par The dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapours a
nd odd smells. Harry, Ron and Hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling cauldrons. The four Slytherins took a table together, as did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron and Hermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the one 
nearest a gold-coloured cauldron that was emit\-
ting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled: somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle and something flowery he thought he might have smelle
d at The Burrow. He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion\rquote s fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. A great contentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, who grinned lazily back.
\par \lquote Now then, now then, now then,\rquote  said Slughorn, whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapours. \lquote Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don\rquote t forget your copies of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and after a moment\rquote s foraging emerged with two very battered-looking copies of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Advanced Potion-Making }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 by Libatius Borage, which he gave to Harry and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales.
\par \lquote Now then,\rquote  said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest, so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off, \lquote I\rquote 
ve prepared a few potions for you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of \rquote em, even if you haven\rquote t made \rquote 
em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?\rquote 
\par He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry raised himself slightly in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it.
\par Hermione\rquote s well-practised hand hit the air before anybody else\rquote s; Slughorn pointed at her.
\par \lquote It\rquote s Veritaserum, a colourless, odourless potion that forces the drinker to tell the truth,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Very good, very good!\rquote  said Slughorn happily. \lquote Now,\rquote  he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, \lquote 
this one here is pretty well-known ... featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately, too ... who can \endash ?\rquote 
\par Hermione\rquote s hand was fastest once more.
\par \lquote It\rquote s Polyjuice Potion, sir,\rquote  she said.
\par Harry, too, had recognised the slow-bubbling, mudlike sub\-stance in the second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year.

\par \lquote Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here ... yes, my dear?\rquote  said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused as Hermione\rquote s hand punched the air again.
\par \lquote It\rquote s Amortentia!\rquote 
\par \lquote It is indeed. It seems almost foolish to ask,\rquote  said Slughorn, who was looking mightily impressed, \lquote but I assume you know what it does?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s the most powerful love potion in the world!\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Quite right! You recognised it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen?\rquote 
\par \lquote And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,\rquote  said Hermione enthusiastically, \lquote and it\rquote s supposed to smell differently to each of us, according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and 
\endash \rquote 
\par But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence.
\par \lquote May I ask your name, my dear?\rquote  said Slughorn, ignoring Hermione\rquote s embarrassment.
\par \lquote Hermione Granger, sir.\rquote 
\par \lquote Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I don\rquote t think so, sir. I\rquote m Muggle-born, you see.\rquote 
\par Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper some\-thing; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.
\par \lquote Oho! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \'93One of my best friends is Muggle-born and she\rquote s the best in our year!\'94 }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Yes, sir,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,\rquote  said Slughorn genially.
\par Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and whispered, \lquote Did you really tell him I\rquote m the best in the year? Oh, Harry!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, what\rquote s so impressive about that?\rquote  whispered Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. \lquote You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 the best in the year \endash  I\rquote d\rquote ve told him so if he\rquote d asked me!\rquote 
\par Hermione smiled but made a \lquote shush\rquote ing gesture, so that they could hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.
\par \lquote Amortentia doesn\rquote t really create }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 love, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 of course. It is impos\-
sible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room \endash  oh yes,\rquote 
 he said, nodding gravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking sceptically. \lquote When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love ...
\par \lquote And now,\rquote  said Slughorn, \lquote it is time for us to start work.\rquote 
\par \lquote Sir, you haven\rquote t told us what\rquote s in this one,\rquote  said Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn\rquote 
s desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the colour of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had spilled.
\par \lquote Oho,\rquote  said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. \lquote Yes. That. Well, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,\rquote 
 he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out an audible gasp, \lquote that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s liquid luck,\rquote  said Hermione excitedly. \lquote It makes you lucky!\rquote 
\par The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention.
\par \lquote Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it\rquote s a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,\rquote  said Slughorn. \lquote Desperately tricky to make, and 
disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavours tend to succeed ... at least until the effects wear off.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why don\rquote t people drink it all the time, sir?\rquote  said Terry Boot eagerly.
\par \lquote Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness and dangerous overconfidence,\rquote  said Slughorn. \lquote Too much of a good thing, you know ... highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very occasionally ...
\rquote 
\par \lquote Have you ever taken it, sir?\rquote  asked Michael Corner with great interest.
\par \lquote Twice in my life,\rquote  said Slughorn. \lquote Once when I was twenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect days.\rquote 
\par He gazed dreamily into the distance. Whether he was play\-acting or not, thought Harry, the effect was good.
\par \lquote And that,\rquote  said Slughorn, apparently coming back to earth, \lquote is what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson.\rquote 
\par There was a silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold.
\par \lquote One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,\rquote  said Slughorn, taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all. \lquote Enough for twelve hours\rquote 
 luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in everything you attempt.
\par \lquote Now
, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organised competitions ... sporting events, for instance, examinations or elections. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only ... and watch how that ordinary day becomes extra
ordinary!
\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Slughorn, suddenly brisk, \lquote how are you to win my fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Advanced Potion-Making. }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than any\-
thing you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here. Off you go!\rquote 
\par There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons towards them, and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room 
was almost tangible. Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Advanced Potion-Making. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 It could not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day. Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had lent him.
\par To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed portions. Bending low to decipher the ingredi\-
ents (even here, the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out) Harry hurried off towards the store cupboard to find what he needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, he saw Malfoy cutting up valerian roots as fast as he could.
\par Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing; this was both an advantage and a disadvan\-
tage of Potions, that it was hard to keep your work private. Within ten minutes, the whole place was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed to have progressed furthest. Her potion already resembled the \lquote smooth, blackcurrant-coloured liqu
id\rquote  mentioned as the ideal halfway stage.
\par Having finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low over his book again. It was really very irritating, having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner, who for some re
ason had taken issue with the order to cut up the Sopophorous Bean and had written in the alternative instruction:
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Crush with flat side of silver dagger, releases juice better than cutting.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy?\rquote 
\par Harry looked up; Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, \lquote I was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it wasn\rquote t unexpected, dragon pox at his age ...\rquote 
\par And he walked away. Harry bent back over his cauldron, smirking. He could tell that Malfoy had expected to be treated like Harry or Zabini; perhaps even hoped for some preferen\-
tial treatment of the type he had learned to expect from Snape. It looked as though Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis.
\par The Sopophorous Bean was proving very difficult to cut up. Harry turned to Hermione.
\par \lquote Can I borrow your silver knife?\rquote 
\par She nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion, which was still deep purple, though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now.
\par Harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger. To his astonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shrivelled bean could have held it all. Hastily scoopi
ng it all into the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook.
\par His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions. 
According to the book, he had to stir counter-clockwise until the potion turned clear as water. According to the addition the previous owner had made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counter-clockwise stir. Could the old owne
r be right twice?
\par Harry stirred counter-clockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The potion turned palest pink.
\par \lquote How are you doing that?\rquote  demanded Hermione, who was red-faced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple.
\par \lquote Add a clockwise stir \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, no, the book says counter-clockwise!\rquote  she snapped.
\par Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs counter-clockwise, one clockwise, pause ... seven stirs counter-clockwise, one stir clockwise ...
\par Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid liquorice. Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, no one else\rquote s potion had turned as pale as his.
 He felt elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon.
\par \lquote And time\rquote s ... up!\rquote  called Slughorn. \lquote Stop stirring, please!\rquote 
\par Slughorn moved slowly between the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir, or a sniff. At last he reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ernie were sitting. He smiled rue\-
fully at the tarlike substance in Ron\rquote s cauldron. He passed over Ernie\rquote s navy concoction. Hermione\rquote s potion he gave an approving nod. Then he saw Harry\rquote s, and a look of incredu\-lous delight spread over his face.
\par \lquote The clear winner!\rquote  he cried to the dungeon. \lquote Excellent, excellent, Harry! Good Lord, it\rquote s clear you\rquote ve inherited your mother\rquote s talent, she was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are 
\endash  one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!\rquote 
\par Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the Slytherins\rquote  faces, and guilt at the dis\-appointed expression on Hermione\rquote 
s. Ron looked simply dumbfounded.
\par \lquote How did you do that?\rquote  he whispered to Harry as they left the dungeon.
\par \lquote Got lucky, I suppose,\rquote  said Harry, because Malfoy was within earshot.
\par Once they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor table for dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell them. Hermione\rquote s face became stonier with every word he uttered.
\par \lquote I s\rquote pose you think I cheated?\rquote  he finished, aggravated by her expression.
\par \lquote Well, it wasn\rquote t exactly your own work, was it?\rquote  she said stiffly.
\par \lquote He only followed different instructions to ours,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Could\rquote ve been a catastrophe, couldn\rquote t it? But he took a risk and it paid off.\rquote  He heaved a sigh. \lquote Slughorn could\rquote 
ve handed me that book, but no, I get the one no one\rquote s ever written in. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Puked on, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 by the look of page fifty-two, but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hang on,\rquote  said a voice close by Harry\rquote s left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn\rquote s dungeon. He looked round and saw that Ginny had joined them. \lquote Did I hear right? You
\rquote ve been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry?\rquote 
\par She looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was on her mind at once.
\par \lquote It\rquote s nothing,\rquote  he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. \lquote It\rquote s not like, you know, Riddle\rquote s diary. It\rquote s just an old textbook someone\rquote s scribbled in.\rquote 
\par \lquote But you\rquote re doing what it says?\rquote 
\par \lquote I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, there\rquote s nothing funny \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ginny\rquote s got a point,\rquote  said Hermione, perking up at once. \lquote We ought to check that there\rquote s nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who knows?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hey!\rquote  said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Advanced Potion-Making }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 out of his bag and raised her wand.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Specialis revelio!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover.

\par Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared.
\par \lquote Finished?\rquote  said Harry irritably. \lquote Or d\rquote you want to wait and see if it does a few back flips?\rquote 
\par \lquote It seems all right,\rquote  said Hermione, still staring at the book suspiciously. \lquote I mean, it really does seem to be ... just a textbook.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good. Then I\rquote ll have it back,\rquote  said Harry, snatching it off the table, but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor.
\par Nobody
 else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve the book and, as he did so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hid
den inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs.

Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
Advanced Potion-Making, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 he had skimmed through it suf\-ficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them con
\-cerned with potion-making. Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself.
\par \lquote Or herself,\rquote  said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. \lquote It might have been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl\rquote s than a boy\rquote 
s.\rquote 
\par \lquote The Half-Blood }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Prince, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 he was called,\rquote  Harry said. \lquote 
How many girls have been princes?\rquote 
\par Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and twitched her essay on \lquote The Principles of Re-Materialisation\rquote  away from Ron, who was trying to read it upside-down.
\par Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Advanced Potion-Making }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699

\par \lquote It\rquote s five to eight, I\rquote d better go, I\rquote ll be late for Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ooooh!\rquote  gasped Hermione, looking up at once. \lquote Good luck! We\rquote ll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches you!\rquote 
\par \lquote Hope it goes OK,\rquote  said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave through the portrait hole.
\par Harry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared round a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing cards, reading them as she walked.
\par \lquote Two of spades: conflict,\rquote  she murmured, as she passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden. \lquote 
Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly troubled, one who dislikes the questioner \endash \rquote 
\par She stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry\rquote s statue.
\par \lquote Well, that can\rquote t be right,\rquote  she said, an
noyed, and Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. Harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventh-floor corr
idor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall.
\par \lquote Acid Pops,\rquote  said Harry. The gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, on to which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up t
o the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledore\rquote s office.
\par Harry knocked.
\par \lquote Come in,\rquote  said Dumbledore\rquote s voice.
\par \lquote Good evening, sir,\rquote  said Harry, walking into the Head\-master\rquote s office.
\par \lquote Ah, good evening, Harry. Sit down,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smil\-ing. \lquote I hope you\rquote ve had an enjoyable first week back at school?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes thanks, sir,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ...\rquote  began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did not look too stern.
\par \lquote I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry, who had more pressing matters on his mind than Snape\rquote s detention, and now looked around surrep\-titiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was plan\-
ning to do with him that evening. The circular office looked just as it always did: the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their f
rames; and Dumbledore\rquote s magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for duelling practice.
\par \lquote So, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. \lquote You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these \endash  for want of a better word \endash  lessons?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, sir.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.\rquote 
\par There was a pause.
\par \lquote You said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me everything,\rquote  said Harry. It was hard to keep a note of accus\-ation from his voice. \lquote Sir,\rquote  he added.
\par \lquote And so I did,\rquote  said Dumbledore placidly. \lquote I told you every\-
thing I know. From this point forth, we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guess\-work. From hereon in, Harry, I may be as woe
fully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron.\rquote 
\par \lquote But you think you\rquote re right?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being \endash  forgive me \endash  rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be cor\-respondingly huger.\rquote 
\par \lquote Sir,\rquote  said Harry tentatively, \lquote does what you\rquote re going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy? Will it help me ... survive?\rquote 
\par \lquote It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,\rquote  said Dumbledore, as casually as if Harry had asked him about the next day\rquote s weather, \lquote and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk, past Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Dumb
ledore bending over the cabinet beside the door. When Dumbledore straightened up, he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of Harry.
\par \lquote You look worried.\rquote 
\par Harry had ind
eed been eyeing the Pensieve with some apprehension. His previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories, though highly instructive, had also been uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its contents, he had s
een much more than he would have wished. But Dumbledore was smiling.
\par \lquote This time, you enter the Pensieve with me ... and, even more unusually, with permission.\rquote 
\par \lquote Where are we going, sir?\rquote 
\par \lquote For a trip down Bob Ogden\rquote s memory lane,\rquote  said Dumbledore, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle contain\-ing a swirling silvery-white substance.
\par \lquote Who was Bob Ogden?\rquote 
\par \lquote He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote He died some time ago, but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded
 him to confide these recollections to me. We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry ...\rquote 
\par But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle: his injured hand seemed stiff and painful.
\par \lquote Shall \endash  shall I, sir?\rquote 
\par \lquote No matter, Harry \endash \rquote 
\par Dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out.
\par \lquote Sir \endash  how did you injure your hand?\rquote  Harry asked again, looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity.
\par \lquote Now is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. We have an appointment with Bob Ogden.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, neither liquid nor gas.
\par \lquote After you,\rquote  said Dumbledore, gesturing towards the bowl.
\par Harry bent forwards, took a deep breath, and plunged his face into the silvery substance. He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was falling, falling, through whirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before hi
s eyes had adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him.
\par They were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forget-me-not. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man wearing enormous
ly thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand side of the road. Harry knew this must be Ogden; he was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing th
e strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wiz\-
ards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock-coat and spats over a striped one-piece bathing costume. Before Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane.
\par Dumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The one pointing back the way they had come read: \lquote Great Hangleton, 5 miles\rquote . The arm pointing after Ogden said: \lquote Little Hangleton, 1 mile
\rquote .
\par They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing, frock-coated figure ahead, then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down a hillside, so th
at they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the opposite h
illside, was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn.
\par Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must b
e their final destination and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however. The lane curve
d to the right, and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogden\rquote s frock-coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge.
\par Dumbledore and Harry followed him on to a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had
 left behind. The path was crooked, rocky and potholed, sloping downhill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a h
alt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand.
\par Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows and it was a few seconds before Harry\rquote s eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him
 a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the
 roof that the rafters were vis\-
ible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open wi
th a clatter and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking.
\par Ogden moved forwards quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake.
\par Then there was a rustle and a crack and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backwards so fast that he stood on the tails of his frock-coat and stumbled.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote You\rquote re not welcome.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any colour. Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have looked comical
, but he did not; the effect was frightening, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke.

\par \lquote Er \endash  I\rquote m sorry \endash  I don\rquote t understand you,\rquote  said Ogden nervously.
\par Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Harry\rquote s opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other.
\par \lquote You understand him, I\rquote m sure, Harry?\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly.
\par \lquote Yes, of course,\rquote  said Harry, slightly nonplussed. \lquote Why can\rquote t Ogden \endash ?\rquote 
\par But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he suddenly understood.
\par \lquote He\rquote s speaking Parseltongue?\rquote 
\par \lquote Very good,\rquote  said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling.
\par The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other.
\par \lquote Now, look \endash \rquote  Ogden began, but too late: there was a bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers.
\par \lquote Morfin!\rquote  said a loud voice.
\par An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very broad an
d his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair and wrinkled face, gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the man with the knife, who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden on the gr
ound.
\par \lquote Ministry, is it?\rquote  said the older man, looking down at Ogden.
\par \lquote Correct!\rquote  said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. \lquote And you, I take it, are Mr Gaunt?\rquote 
\par \lquote \rquote S right,\rquote  said Gaunt. \lquote Got you in the face, did he?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, he did!\rquote  snapped Ogden.
\par \lquote Should\rquote ve made your presence known, shouldn\rquote t you?\rquote  said Gaunt aggressively. \lquote This is private property. Can\rquote t just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself.\rquote 
\par \lquote Defend himself against what, man?\rquote  said Ogden, clambering back to his feet.
\par \lquote Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.\rquote 
\par Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Get in the house. Don\rquote t argue.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par This time, ready for it, Harry recognised Parseltongue; even while he could understand what was being said, he dis\-tinguished the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear. Morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast
 him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him, so that the snake swung sadly again.
\par \lquote It\rquote s your son I\rquote m here to see, Mr Gaunt,\rquote  said Ogden, as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat. \lquote That was Morfin, wasn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ar, that was Morfin,\rquote  said the old man indifferently. \lquote Are you pure-blood?\rquote  he asked, suddenly aggressive.
\par \lquote That\rquote s neither here nor there,\rquote  said Ogden coldly, and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise.
\par Apparently Gaunt felt rather differently. He squinted into Ogden\rquote s face and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, \lquote Now I come to think about it, I\rquote ve seen noses like yours down in the village.\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t doubt it, if your son\rquote s been let loose on them,\rquote  said Ogden. \lquote Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside?\rquote 
\par \lquote Inside?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Mr Gaunt. I\rquote ve already told you. I\rquote m here about Morfin. We sent an owl \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve no use for owls,\rquote  said Gaunt. \lquote I don\rquote t open letters.\rquote 
\par \lquote Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors,\rquote  said Ogden tartly. \lquote I am here following a serious breach of wizarding law which occurred here in the early hours of this morning \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote All right, all right, all right!\rquote  bellowed Gaunt. \lquote Come in the bleeding house, then, and much good it\rquote ll do you!\rquote 
\par The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen and living room combined. Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting 
a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue:

\par \lquote Mr Gaunt, please!\rquote 
 said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it at the pot and muttered a hasty, inaudible s
pell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the opposite wall and crack in two.
\par Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed, \lquote Mend it, you pointless lump, mend it!\rquote 
\par Merope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Reparo.\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 The pot mended itself instantly.

\par Without looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, Merope picked up the pot and returned it, hands trembling, to its shelf. She then stoo
d quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove, as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish.

\par \lquote I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr Gaunt,\rquote  said Ogden, looking wary, but standing his ground.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right!\rquote  roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realised that he was showing Ogden the ugly, black-stoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger, waving it before Ogden
\rquote s eyes. \lquote See this? See this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries it\rquote s been in our family, that\rquote s how far back we go, and pure-blood all the way! Know how much I\rquote ve been offered for this

\par With a howl of rage, Gaunt ran towards his daughter. For a split second, Harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat; next moment, he was dragging her towards Ogden by a gold chain around her neck.
\par \lquote See this?\rquote  he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy gold locket at him, while Merope spluttered and gasped for breath.
\par \lquote I see it, I see it!\rquote  said Ogden hastily.

\par And he spat on the floor at Ogden\rquote s feet. Morfin cackled again. Merope, huddled beside the window, her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair, said nothing.
\par \lquote Mr Gaunt,\rquote  said Ogden doggedly, \lquote I am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand. I am here because of Morfin, Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night. Our information,\rquote 
 he glanced down at his scroll of parchment, \lquote is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly painful hives.\rquote

\par \lquote That\rquote s hardly the point, is it, Mr Gaunt?\rquote  said Ogden. \lquote This was an unprovoked attack on a defenceless \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ar, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the moment I saw you,\rquote  sneered Gaunt and he spat on the floor again.
\par \lquote This discussion is getting us nowhere,\rquote  said Ogden firmly. \lquote It is clear from your son\rquote s attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions.\rquote  He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again. \lquote 
Morfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg\emdash \rquote 
\par Ogden broke off. The jingling, clopping sou

ards the sounds, his expression hungry. Merope raised her head. Her face, Harry saw, was starkly white.
\par \lquote My God, what an eyesore!\rquote  rang out a girl\rquote s voice, as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them. \lquote Couldn\rquote t your father have that hovel cleared away, Tom?\rquote

\par Ogden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed, Merope\rquote s screams echoing in his ears.
\par Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted on to the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man. Both he and the pretty girl riding beside 
him on a grey horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the horse\rquote s flank and set off again, his frock-coat flying, covered from head to foot in dust, running pell-mell up the lane.
\par \lquote I think that will do, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore. He took Harry by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness, until they landed squarely on their feet, back in Dumbledore\rquote

\par \lquote What happened to the girl in the cottage?\rquote  said Harry at once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand. \lquote Merope, or whatever her name was?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, she survived,\rquote  said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that Harry should sit down too. \lquote Ogden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned w
ith reinforcements within fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight, but both were overpowered, removed from the cottage and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a record of Muggle attacks, was sen\-
tenced to three years in Azkaban. Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Ogden, received six months.\rquote 
\par \lquote Marvolo?\rquote  Harry repeated wonderingly.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. \lquote I am glad to see you\rquote re keeping up.\rquote 
\par \lquote That old man was \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Voldemort\rquote s grandfather, yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote 
Marvolo, his son Morfin and his daughter Merope were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generation
s due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very 
nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter.\rquote 
\par \lquote So Merope,\rquote  said Harry, leaning forwards in his chair and staring at Dumbledore, \lquote so Merope was ... sir, does that mean she was ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Voldemort

\par \lquote It does,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort\rquote s father. I wonder whether you noticed?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?\rquote 
\par \lquote Very good indeed,\rquote  said Dumbledore, beaming. \lquote Yes, that was Tom Riddle Senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion.\rquote 
\par \lquote And they ended up married?\rquote  Harry said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love.
\par \lquote I think you are forgetting,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote that Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terror\-ised by her father. Once Mar
volo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was able to give full rein to her abil\-ities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years.
\par \lquote Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Imperius Curse?\rquote  Harry suggested. \lquote Or a love potion?\rquote 
\par \lquote Very good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she used a lov
e potion. I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her and I do not think it would have been very difficult, some hot day, when Riddle was riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of water. In any case, within a few months of the scene we have
 just witnessed, the village of Little Hangle\-ton enjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire\rquote s son ran off with the tramp\rquote s daughter Merope.
\par \lquote But the villagers\rquote  shock was nothing to Marvolo\rquote s. He returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his daughter duti\-
fully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of dust and her note of fare\-well, explaining what she had done.
\par \lquote From all that I have been able to discover, he never men\-tioned her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death \endash 
 or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage.\rquote 
\par \lquote And Merope? She ... she died, didn\rquote t she? Wasn\rquote t Voldemort brought up in an orphanage?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, indeed,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote We must do a certain amount of guessing here, although I do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see, w
ithin a few months of their runaway marriage, Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife. The rumour flew around the neighbourhood that he was talking of being \'93hoodwinked\'94 and \'93taken in\'94
. What he meant, I am sure, is tha
t he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they heard what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, prete
nding that she was going to have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason.\rquote 
\par \lquote But she }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 did }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 have his baby.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, but not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant.\rquote 
\par \lquote What went wrong?\rquote  asked Harry. \lquote Why did the love potion stop working?\rquote 
\par \lquote Again, this is guesswork,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote but I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop g
iving him the potion. Per\-haps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby\rquote 
s sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of his son.\rquote 
\par The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledore\rquote s office seemed to glow more brightly than before.
\par \lquote I think that will do for tonight, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore after a moment or two.
\par \lquote Yes, sir,\rquote  said Harry.
\par He got to his feet, but did not leave.
\par \lquote Sir ... is it important to know all this about Voldemort\rquote s past?\rquote 
\par \lquote Very important, I think,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote And it ... it\rquote s got something to do with the prophecy?\rquote 
\par \lquote It has everything to do with the prophecy.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry, a little confused, but reassured all the same.
\par He turned to go, then another question occurred to him, and he turned back again.
\par \lquote Sir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything you\rquote ve told me?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, \lquote 
Yes, I think Mr Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trustworthy. But, Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got around how
 much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemort\rquote s secrets.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, sir, I\rquote ll make sure it\rquote s just Ron and Hermione. Good\-night.\rquote 
\par He turned away again, and was almost at the door when he saw it. Sitting on one of the little spindle-legged tables that supported so many frail-looking silver instruments was an ugly gold ring set with a large, cracked black stone.
\par \lquote Sir,\rquote  said Harry, staring at it. \lquote That ring \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yes?\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night.\rquote 
\par \lquote So I was,\rquote  Dumbledore agreed.
\par \lquote But isn\rquote t it ... sir, isn\rquote t it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore bowed his head.
\par \lquote The very same.\rquote 
\par \lquote But how come \endash ? Have you always had it?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I acquired it very recently,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote A few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle\rquote s, in fact.\rquote 
\par \lquote That would be around the time you injured your hand, then, sir?\rquote 
\par \lquote Around that time, yes, Harry.\rquote 
\par Harry hesitated. Dumbledore was smiling.
\par \lquote Sir, how exactly \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Too late, Harry! You shall hear the story another time. Goodnight.\rquote

Non-verbal spells were now expected, not only in Defence Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as 
though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud. It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbo
logy, but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind.
\par One result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practising non-verbal spells was that Harry, Ron and Hermione had so fa
r been unable to find time to go and visit Hagrid. He had stopped coming to meals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on the few occasions when they had passed him in the corridors or out in the grounds, he had mysteriously failed to notice them or h
ear their greetings.

\par The post owls arrived, swooping down through rain-flecked windows, scattering everyone with droplets of water. Most people were receivin
g more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was well at home. Harry had received no mail since the start of term; his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hop
ed that Lupin might write occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy-white Hedwig circ\-

\par \lquote He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,\rquote  said Ron reasonably. \lquote You never can tell.\rquote 
\par \lquote It doesn\rquote t look like it,\rquote  said Hermione, who was still reading. \lquote It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters\rquote  secret plans in a pub.\rquote

\par \lquote It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Isn\rquote t he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister for Magic when he was trying to chat up those Veela?\rquote

\par \lquote What!\rquote  said Ron, goggling at Hermione. \lquote But Hogwarts is safer than their homes, bound to be! We\rquote ve got Aurors, and all those extra protective spells, and we\rquote ve got Dumbledore!\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think we\rquote ve got him all the time,\rquote  said Hermione very quietly, glancing towards the staff table over the top of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Prophet. }{

\par Harry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The Head\-master\rquote s chair was indeed empty. Now Harry came to think of it, he had not seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago.
\par \lquote I think he\rquote s left the school to do something with the Order,\rquote  said Hermione in a low voice. \lquote I mean ... it\rquote s all look\-ing serious, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par Harry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. There had been a horrible incident the day before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not
 seen Hannah since.
\par When they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil. Remembering what Hermione had said about the Patil twins\rquote  parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts, 
Harry was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whisper\-
ing together, looking distressed. What did surprise him was that when Ron drew level with them, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who looked round and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at
 her, then returned the smile uncertainly. His walk instantly became something more like a strut. Harry resisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had broken Harry\rquote 
s nose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck.
\par As Harry had expected, the trials took most of the morn\-ing. Half of Gryffindor house seemed to have turn
ed up, from first-years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms, to seventh-years who towered over the rest looking coolly intimidating. The latter included a large, wiry-haired boy Harry recognised immediately from the 
Hogwarts Express.
\par \lquote We met on the train, in old Sluggy\rquote s compartment,\rquote  he said confidently, stepping out of the crowd to shake Harry\rquote s hand. \lquote Cormac McLaggen, Keeper.\rquote 
\par \lquote You didn\rquote t try out last year, did you?\rquote  asked Harry, taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking that he would probably block all three goalhoops without even moving.
\par \lquote I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,\rquote  said McLaggen, with something of a swagger. \lquote Ate a pound of Doxy eggs for a bet.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Well ... if you wait over there ...\rquote 
\par He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to where Hermione was sitting. He thought he saw a flicker of annoy\-ance pass over McLaggen\rquote s face and wondered whether McLaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both \lquote 
old Sluggy\rquote s\rquote  favourites.
\par Harry decided to start with a basic test, asking all appli\-cants for the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch. This was a good decision: the first ten was made up of first-years and it could not have
 been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before. Only one boy man\-aged to remain airborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goalposts.
\par The second group comprised ten of the silliest girls Harry ha
d ever encountered, who, when he blew his whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching each other. Romilda Vane was amongst them. When he told them to leave the pitch they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else.

\par The third group had a pile-up halfway around the pitch. Most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks. The fifth group were Hufflepuffs.
\par \lquote If there\rquote s anyone else here who\rquote s not from Gryffindor,\rquote  roared Harry, who was starting to get seriously annoyed, \lquote leave now, please!\rquote 
\par There was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter.
\par After two hours, many complaints and several tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth, Har
ry had found himself three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after an excellent trial, a new find called Demelza Robins, who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers, and Ginny Weasley, who had outflown all the com\-
petition and scored seventeen goals to boot. Pleased though he was with his choices, Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters.
\par \lquote That\rquote s my final decision and if you don\rquote t get out of the way for the Keepers I\rquote ll hex you,\rquote  he bellowed.
\par Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harry\rquote 
s head with a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy but aimed well. They now joined Katie, Demelza and Ginny in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member.
\par Harry had deliberately left the trial of th
e Keepers until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now, so that it wa
s
 larger than ever. As each Keeper flew up to the goalhoops, the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure. Harry glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, bu
t apparently not: Ron was a delicate shade of green.
\par None of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece. To Harry\rquote s great disappointment, Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five. On the last one, however, he shot off in completely t
he wrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth.
\par Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Clean\-sweep Eleven.
\par \lquote Good luck!\rquote  cried a voice from the stands. Harry looked around, expecting to see Her
mione, but it was Lavender Brown. He would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial.
\par Yet he need not have 
worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four, five penalties in a row. Delighted, and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that, most unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to find McLaggen
\rquote s red face inches from his own. He stepped back hastily.
\par \lquote His sister didn\rquote t really try,\rquote  said McLaggen menacingly. There was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one Harry had often admired in Uncle Vernon\rquote s. \lquote She gave him an easy save.\rquote 
\par \lquote Rubbish,\rquote  said Harry coldly. \lquote That was the one he nearly missed.\rquote 
\par McLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his ground this time.
\par \lquote Give me another go.\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote You\rquote ve had your go. You saved four. Ron saved five. Ron\rquote s Keeper, he won it fair and square. Get out of my way.\rquote 
\par He thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch him, but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away, growling what sounded like threats to thin air.
\par Harry turned round to find his new team beaming at him.
\par \lquote Well done,\rquote  he croaked. \lquote You flew really well \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You did brilliantly, Ron!\rquote 
\par This time it really was Hermione running towards them from the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face. Ron looked extremely plea
sed with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned around at the team and at Hermione.
\par After fixing the time of their first full practice for the fol\-lowing Thursday, Harry, Ron and Hermione bade goodbye to the rest of the team and headed off towards Hagrid\rquote 
s. A watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last. Harry felt extremely hungry; he hoped there would be something to eat at Hagrid\rquote s.
\par \lquote I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,\rquote  Ron was saying happily. \lquote Tricky shot from Demelza, did you see, had a bit of spin on it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, yes, you were magnificent,\rquote  said Hermione, looking amused.
\par \lquote I was better than that McLaggen anyway,\rquote  said Ron in a highly satisfied voice. \lquote Did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth? Looked like he\rquote d been Confunded ...\rquote 
\par To Harry\rquote s surprise, Hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these words. Ron noticed nothing; he was too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail.
\par The great grey Hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in front of Hagrid\rquote s cabin. He clicked his razor-sharp beak at their approach and turned his huge head towards them.
\par \lquote Oh dear,\rquote  said Hermione nervously. \lquote He\rquote s still a bit scary, isn\rquote t he?\rquote 
\par \lquote Come off it, you\rquote ve ridden him, haven\rquote t you?\rquote  said Ron.
\par Harry stepped forwards and bowed low to the Hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into a bow too.
\par \lquote How are you?\rquote  Harry asked him in a low voice, moving forwards to stroke the feathery head. \lquote Missing him? But you\rquote re OK here with Hagrid, aren\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oi!\rquote  said a loud voice.
\par Hagrid had come striding round the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes. His enormous boarhound, Fang, was at his heels; Fang gave a booming bark and bounded forwards.
\par \lquote Git away from him! He\rquote ll have yer fingers \endash  oh. It\rquote s yeh lot.\rquote 
\par Fang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron, attempting to lick their ears. Hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second, then turned and strode into his cabin, slamming the door behind him.
\par \lquote Oh dear!\rquote  said Hermione, looking stricken.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t worry about it,\rquote  said Harry grimly. He walked over to the door and knocked loudly.
\par \lquote Hagrid! Open up, we want to talk to you!\rquote 
\par There was no sound from within.
\par \lquote If you don\rquote t open the door, we\rquote ll blast it open!\rquote  Harry said, pulling out his wand.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  said Hermione, sounding shocked. \lquote You can\rquote t possibly \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I can!\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Stand back \endash \rquote 
\par But before he could say anything else, the door flew open again as Harry had known it would, and there stood Hagrid, glowering down at him and looking, despite the flowery pinny, positively alarming.
\par \lquote I\rquote m a teacher!\rquote  he roared at Harry. \lquote A teacher, Potter! How dare yeh threaten ter break down my door!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 sir,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
said Harry, emphasising the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes.
\par Hagrid looked stunned.
\par \lquote Since when have }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 yeh }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 called me \'93sir\'94?\rquote 
\par \lquote Since when have you called me \'93Potter\'94?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, very clever,\rquote  growled Hagrid. \lquote Very amusin\rquote . That\rquote s me outsmarted, innit? All righ\rquote , come in then, yeh ungrateful little ...\rquote 
\par Mumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. Hermione scurried in after Harry, looking rather frightened.
\par \lquote Well?\rquote  said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron and Hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table, Fang laying his head immediately upon Harry\rquote s knee and drooling all over his robes. \lquote What\rquote s this? Feelin\rquote 
 sorry for me? Reckon I\rquote m lonely or summat?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry at once. \lquote We wanted to see you.\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote ve missed you!\rquote  said Hermione tremulously.
\par \lquote Missed me, have yeh?\rquote  snorted Hagrid. \lquote Yeah. Righ\rquote .\rquote 
\par He stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle, muttering all the while. Finally he slammed down three bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes. Harry was hungry enough even for Hagrid\rquote 
s cooking, and took one at once.
\par \lquote Hagrid,\rquote  said Hermione timidly, when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong, \lquote 
we really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.\rquote 
\par Hagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought some bogies landed on the potatoes, and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner.
\par \lquote We did!\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote But none of us could fit it into our timetables!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah. Righ\rquote ,\rquote  said Hagrid again.
\par There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around: Hermione let out a tiny shriek and Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the tab
le away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed. It was full of what looked like foot-long maggots; slimy, white and writhing.
\par \lquote What are they, Hagrid?\rquote  asked Harry, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the same.
\par \lquote Jus\rquote  giant grubs,\rquote  said Hagrid.
\par \lquote And they grow into ... ?\rquote  said Ron, looking apprehensive.
\par \lquote They won\rquote  grow inter nuthin\rquote ,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote I got \rquote em ter feed ter Aragog.\rquote 
\par And without warning, he burst into tears.
\par \lquote Hagrid!\rquote  cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders. \lquote What is it?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s ... him ...\rquote  gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes stream\-ing as he mopped his face with his apron. \lquote It\rquote s ... Aragog ... I think he\rquote s dyin\rquote  ... he got ill over the summer an\rquote  he\rquote 
s not gettin\rquote  better ... I don\rquote  know what I\rquote ll do if he ... if he ... we\rquote ve bin tergether so long ...\rquote 
\par Hermione patted Hagrid\rquote s shoulder, looking at a complete l
oss for anything to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stings, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this was 
perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, that dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously.
\par \lquote Is there \endash  is there anything we can do?\rquote  Hermione asked, ignoring Ron\rquote s frantic grimaces and head-shakings.
\par \lquote I don\rquote  think there is, Hermione,\rquote  choked Hagrid, attempt\-ing to stem the flood of his tears. \lquote See, the rest o\rquote  the tribe ... Aragog\rquote s family ... they\rquote re gettin\rquote  a bit funny now he\rquote 
s ill ... bit restive ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,\rquote  said Ron in an undertone.
\par \lquote ... I don\rquote  reckon it\rquote d be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo\rquote ,\rquote  Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up. \lquote But thanks fer offerin\rquote 
, Hermione ... it means a lot ...\rquote 
\par After that the atmosphere lightened considerably, for
 although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more.
\par \lquote Ar, I always knew yeh\rquote d find it hard ter squeeze me inter yeh timetables,\rquote  he said gruffly, pouring them more tea. \lquote Even if yeh applied fer Time-Turners \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We couldn\rquote t have done,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote We smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners when we were there in the summer. It was in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Daily Prophet.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote Ar, well then,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote There\rquote s no way yeh could\rquote ve done it ... I\rquote m sorry I\rquote ve bin \endash  yeh know \endash  I\rquote ve jus\rquote  bin wor\-ried abou\rquote  Aragog ... an\rquote 
 I did wonder whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank had bin teachin\rquote  yeh \endash \rquote 
\par At which all three of them stated categorically and untruth\-
fully that Professor Grubbly-Plank, who had substituted for Hagrid a few times, was a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time Hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite cheerful.
\par \lquote I\rquote m starving,\rquote  said Harry, once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth. And I\rquote 
ve got that detention with Snape tonight, I haven\rquote t got much time for dinner ...\rquote 
\par As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen entering the Great Hall. It took him two attempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely
 guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but Harry caught Hermione\rquote s arm and held her back.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Hermione defensively.
\par \lquote If you ask me,\rquote  said Harry quietly, \lquote McLaggen looks like he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Confunded. And he was standing right in front of where you were sitting.\rquote 
\par Hermione blushed.
\par \lquote Oh, all right then, I did it,\rquote  she whispered. \lquote But you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny! Anyway, he\rquote s got a nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he didn\rquote t get in \endash  you wouldn
\rquote t have wanted someone like that on the team.\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote No, I suppose that\rquote s true. But wasn\rquote t that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, you\rquote re a prefect, aren\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, be quiet,\rquote  she snapped, as he smirked.
\par \lquote What are you two doing?\rquote  demanded Ron, reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious.
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  said Harry and Hermione together, and they hur\-ried after Ron. The smell of roast beef made Harry\rquote s stomach ache with hunger, but they had barely taken three steps towards the Gry
ffindor table when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them, blocking their path.
\par \lquote Harry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see!\rquote  he boomed genially, twiddling the ends of his walrus moustache and puffing out his enormous belly. \lquote I was hoping to catc
h you before dinner! What do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? We\rquote re having a little party, just a few rising stars. I\rquote ve got McLaggen coming, and Zabini, the charming Melinda Bobbin \endash  I don\rquote 
t know whether you know her? Her family owns a large chain of apothecaries \endash  and, of course, I hope very much that Miss Granger will favour me by coming, too.\rquote 
\par Slughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished speak\-ing. It was as though Ron was not present; Slughorn did not so much as look at him.
\par \lquote I can\rquote t come, Professor,\rquote  said Harry at once. \lquote I\rquote ve got a detention with Professor Snape.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh dear!\rquote  said Slughorn, his face falling comically. \lquote Dear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, I\rquote ll just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation, I\rquote m sure I\rquote 
ll be able to persuade him to postpone your detention. Yes, I\rquote ll see you both later!\rquote 
\par He bustled away out of the Hall.
\par \lquote He\rquote s got no chance of persuading Snape,\rquote  said Harry, the moment Slughorn was out of earshot. \lquote This detention\rquote s already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won\rquote t do it for anyone else.\rquote 

\par \lquote Oh, I wish you could come, I don\rquote t want to go on my own!\rquote  said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she was thinking about McLaggen.
\par \lquote I doubt you\rquote ll be alone, Ginny\rquote ll probably be invited,\rquote  snapped Ron, who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by Slughorn.
\par After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. The common room was very crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but the
y managed to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. Hermione reached out for a copy of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Not really ...\rquote  Hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages. \lquote Oh, look, your dad\rquote s in here, Ron \endash  he\rquote s all right!\rquote  she added quickly, for Ron had looked round in alarm. \lquote

\par \lquote Yeah, mine!\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I told him at King\rquote s Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix! Well, if it\rquote s not at their house, he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote But how can he have done, Harry?\rquote  said Hermione, putting down the newspaper with a surprised look. \lquote We were all searched when we arrived, weren\rquote t we?\rquote 
\par \lquote Were you?\rquote  said Harry, taken aback. \lquote I wasn\rquote t!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh no, of course you weren\rquote t, I forgot you were late ... well, Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the Entrance Hall. Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confis\-

\par Momentarily stymied, Harry watched Ginny Weasley play\-ing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection.

\par \lquote All the owls are being checked, too,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Filch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors every\-where he could reach.\rquote 
\par Really stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to say. There did not seem to be any way Malfoy could have brought a dangerous or Dark object into the school. He looked hope\-
fully at Ron, who was sitting with his arms folded, staring over at Lavender Brown.
\par \lquote Can you think of any way Malfoy \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, drop it, Harry,\rquote  said Ron.

\par \lquote Well, as I\rquote m not invited to any parties,\rquote  said Ron, getting to his feet again, \lquote I think I\rquote ll go to bed.\rquote

\par \lquote From Professor Slughorn?\rquote  asked Harry, sitting up hopefully.
\par \lquote No ... from Professor Snape,\rquote  said Demelza. Harry\rquote s heart sank. \lquote He says you\rquote re to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention \endash  er \endash  no matter how many party invitations you\rquote

Halfway through October came their first trip of the term to Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it
 was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours.
\par Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Advanced Potion-Making. }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 He did not usually lie in bed r
eading his textbooks; that sort of behaviour, as Ron rightly said, was indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was simply weird that way. Harry felt, however, that the Half-Blood Prince\rquote s copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Advanced Potion-Making }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 hardly qualified as a textbook. The 
more Harry pored over the book, the more he realised how much was in there, not only the handy hints and short cuts on potions that were earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the
 margins which Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself.
\par Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince\rquote s self-invented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the cor\-
ridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Muffliato, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 a sp
ell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapprov
\-ing expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry had used the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Muffliato }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 spell on anyone in the vicinity.
\par Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have 
caused the Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Levicorpus (n-vbl)}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the win\-dows and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 N-vbl ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
that had to mean non-verbal. Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with non-verbal spells, something Snape had been quick to comment on in every 
DADA class. On the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far.
\par Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Levicorpus! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 inside his head.
\par \lquote Aaaaaaaargh!\rquote 
\par There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a yell. Harry sent }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Advanced Potion-Making }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside-down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.
\par \lquote Sorry!\rquote  yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter and Neville picked himself up from the floor, having fallen out of bed. \lquote Hang on \endash  I\rquote ll let you down \endash \rquote 
\par He groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic, trying to find the right page; at last he located it and deciphered one cramped word underneath the spell: praying that this was the counter-jinx, Harry thought }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Liberacorpus! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 with all his might.
\par There was another flash of light and Ron fell in a heap on to his mattress.
\par \lquote Sorry,\rquote  repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and Seamus continued to roar with laughter.
\par \lquote Tomorrow,\rquote  said Ron in a muffled voice, \lquote I\rquote d rather you set the alarm clock.\rquote 
\par By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with several of Mrs Weasley\rquote s hand-knitted sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves and gloves, Ron\rquote s shock had subsided and he had decided that Harry\rquote s new spell was highly amus\-
ing; so amusing, in fact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with the story as they sat down for breakfast.
\par \lquote ... and then there was another flash of light and I landed on the bed again!\rquote  grinned Ron, helping himself to sausages.
\par Hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry.
\par \lquote Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion book of yours?\rquote  she asked.
\par Harry frowned at her.
\par \lquote Always jump to the worst conclusion, don\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Was it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well ... yeah, it was, but so what?\rquote 
\par \lquote So you just decided to try out an unknown, handwritten incantation and see what would happen?\rquote 
\par \lquote Why does it matter if it\rquote s handwritten?\rquote  said Harry, prefer\-ring not to answer the rest of the question.
\par \lquote Because it\rquote s probably not Ministry of Magic-approved,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote And also,\rquote  she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, \lquote because I\rquote m starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.
\rquote 
\par Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.
\par \lquote It was a laugh!\rquote  said Ron, up-ending a ketchup bottle over his sausages. \lquote Just a laugh, Hermione, that\rquote s all!\rquote 
\par \lquote Dangling people upside-down by the ankle?\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Fred and George,\rquote  said Ron, shrugging, \lquote it\rquote s their kind of thing. And, er \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote My dad,\rquote  said Harry. He had only just remembered.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Ron and Hermione together.
\par \lquote My dad used this spell,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I \endash  Lupin told me.\rquote 
\par This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderfu
l possibility occurred to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be \endash ?
\par \lquote Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote but he\rquote s not the only one. We\rquote ve seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case you\rquote ve forgotten. Dangling people in the air. Making
 them float along, asleep, helpless.\rquote 
\par Harry stared at her. With a sinking feeling he, too, remem\-bered the behaviour of the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup. Ron came to his aid.
\par \lquote That was different,\rquote  he said robustly. \lquote They were abusing it. Harry and his dad were just having a laugh. You don\rquote t like the Prince, Hermione,\rquote  he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly, \lquote because he\rquote 
s better than you at Potions \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s got nothing to do with that!\rquote  said Hermione, her cheeks reddening. \lquote I just think it\rquote s very irresponsible to start perform\-ing spells when you don\rquote t even know what they\rquote re for, and stop talking about 
\'93the Prince\'94 as if it\rquote s his title, I bet it\rquote s just a stupid nickname and it doesn\rquote t seem as though he was a very nice person to me!\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t see where you get that from,\rquote  said Harry heatedly, \lquote if he\rquote d been a budding Death Eater he wouldn\rquote t have been boasting about being \'93Half-Blood\'94, would he?\rquote 
\par Even as he said it, Harry remembered that his father had been pure-blood, but he pushed the thought out of his mind; he would worry about that later ...
\par \lquote The Death Eaters can\rquote t all be pure-blood, there aren\rquote t enough pure-blood wizards left,\rquote  said Hermione stubbornly. \lquote I expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It\rquote s only Muggle-borns they 
hate, they\rquote d be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.\rquote 
\par \lquote There is no way they\rquote d let me be a Death Eater!\rquote  said Ron indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Ernie Macmillan on the head. \lquote My whole family are blood traitors! That
\rquote s as bad as Muggle-borns to Death Eaters!\rquote 
\par \lquote And they\rquote d love to have me,\rquote  said Harry sarcastically. \lquote We\rquote d be best pals if they didn\rquote t keep trying to do me in.\rquote 
\par This made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging smile, and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny.
\par \lquote Hey, Harry, I\rquote m supposed to give you this.\rquote 
\par It was a scroll of parchment with Harry\rquote s name written upon it in familiar thin, slanting writing.
\par \lquote Thanks, Ginny ... it\rquote s Dumbledore\rquote s next lesson!\rquote  Harry told Ron and Hermione, pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents. \lquote Monday evening!\rquote  He felt suddenly light and happy. \lquote 
Want to join us in Hogsmeade, Ginny?\rquote  he asked.
\par \lquote I\rquote m going with Dean \endash  might see you there,\rquote  she replied, waving at them as she left.
\par Filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, check\-ing off the names of people who had permission to go into Hogsmeade. The process took even longer than normal as Filch was triple-checking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor.
\par \lquote What does it matter if we\rquote re smuggling Dark stuff OUT?\rquote  demanded Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy Sensor with apprehension. \lquote Surely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN?\rquote 
\par His cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the Sensor, and he was still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet.
\par The walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb. The road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind. More than once
 Harry wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room, and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko\rquote 
s Joke Shop had been boarded up, Harry took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun. Ron 
pointed with a thickly gloved hand towards Honeydukes, which was mercifully open, and Harry and Hermione staggered in his wake into the crowded shop.
\par \lquote Thank God,\rquote  shivered Ron as they were enveloped by warm, toffee-scented air. \lquote Let\rquote s stay here all afternoon.\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, m\rquote boy!\rquote  said a booming voice from behind them.
\par \lquote Oh, no,\rquote  muttered Harry. The three of them turned to see Professor Slughorn, who was wearing an enormous furry hat and overcoat with matching fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystallised pin
eapple and occupying at least a quarter of the shop.
\par \lquote Harry, that\rquote s three of my little suppers you\rquote ve missed now!\rquote  said Slughorn, poking him genially in the chest. \lquote It won\rquote t do, m\rquote boy, I\rquote m determined to have you! Miss Granger loves them, don\rquote 
t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Hermione helplessly, \lquote they\rquote re really \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote So why don\rquote t you come along, Harry?\rquote  demanded Slughorn.
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote ve had Quidditch practice, Professor,\rquote  said Harry, who had indeed been scheduling practices every time Slughorn had sent him a little violet-rib
bon-adorned invitation. This strategy meant that Ron was not left out and they usually had a laugh with Ginny imagining Hermione shut up with McLaggen and Zabini.
\par \lquote Well, I certainly expect you to win your first match after all this hard work!\rquote  said Slughorn. \lquote But a little recreation never hurt anybody. Now, how about Monday night, you can\rquote t possibly want to practise in this weather ...
\rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t, Professor, I\rquote ve got \endash  er \endash  an appointment with Professor Dumbledore that evening.\rquote 
\par \lquote Unlucky again!\rquote  cried Slughorn dramatically. \lquote Ah, well ... you can\rquote t evade me for ever, Harry!\rquote 
\par And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as little notice of Ron as though he had been a display of Cockroach Cluster.
\par \lquote I can\rquote t believe you\rquote ve wriggled out of another one,\rquote  said Hermione, shaking her head. \lquote They\rquote re not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 bad, you know ... they\rquote re even quite fun sometimes ...\rquote  But then she caught sight of Ron\rquote s expression. \lquote Oh, look \endash  they\rquote ve got Deluxe Sugar Quills 
\endash  those would last hours!\rquote 
\par Glad that Hermione had changed the subject, Harry showed much more interest in the new extra-large Sugar Quills than he would normally have done, but Ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged when Hermione asked him where he wanted to go next.

\par \lquote Let\rquote s go to the Three Broomsticks,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote It\rquote ll be warm.\rquote 
\par They bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweet shop. The bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes. The street was not very busy; nobody was lingering to chat, just hurry\-
ing towards their destinations. The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognised the barman who worked in the other
 Hogsmeade pub, the Hog\rquote 
s Head. As Harry, Ron and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet from him when Harry realised who the man was.

\par \lquote Mundungus!\rquote 
\par The squat, bandy-legged man with long straggly ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, which burst open, releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window.
\par \lquote Oh, \rquote ello, \rquote Arry,\rquote  said Mundungus Fletcher, with a most unconvincing stab at airiness. \lquote Well, don\rquote t let me keep ya.\rquote 
\par And he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone.
\par \lquote Are you selling this stuff?\rquote  asked Harry, watching Mundungus grabbing an assortment of grubby-looking objects from the ground.
\par \lquote Oh, well, gotta scrape a living,\rquote  said Mundungus. \lquote Gimme that!\rquote 
\par Ron had stooped down and picked up something silver.
\par \lquote Hang on,\rquote  Ron said slowly. \lquote This looks familiar \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you!\rquote  said Mundungus, snatching the goblet out of Ron\rquote s hand and stuffing it back into the case. \lquote Well, I\rquote ll see you all \endash  OUCH!\rquote 
\par Harry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat. Holding him fast with one hand, he pulled out his wand.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  squealed Hermione.
\par \lquote You took that from Sirius\rquote s house,\rquote  said Harry, who was almost nose-to-nose with Mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits. \lquote That had the Black family crest on it.\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  no \endash  what \endash ?\rquote  spluttered Mundungus, who was turning slowly purple.
\par \lquote What did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place?\rquote  snarled Harry.
\par \lquote I \endash  no \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Give it to me!\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, you mustn\rquote t!\rquote  shrieked Hermione, as Mundungus started to turn blue.
\par There was a bang and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungus\rquote s throat. Gasping and spluttering, Mundungus seized his fallen case, then \endash  CRACK \endash  he Disapparated.
\par Harry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see where Mundungus had gone.
\par \lquote COME BACK, YOU THIEVING \endash !\rquote 
\par \lquote There\rquote s no point, Harry.\rquote 
\par Tonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair wet with sleet.
\par \lquote Mundungus will probably be in London by now. There\rquote s no point yelling.\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s nicked Sirius\rquote s stuff! Nicked it!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, but still,\rquote  said Tonks, who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of information, \lquote you should get out of the cold.\rquote 
\par She watched them through the door of the Three Broomsticks. The moment he was inside, Harry burst out, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote He was nicking Sirius\rquote s stuff!\rquote }{

\par \lquote I know, Harry, but please don\rquote t shout, people are staring,\rquote  whispered Hermione. \lquote Go and sit down, I\rquote ll get you a drink.\rquote 
\par Harry was still fuming when Hermione returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of Butter\-beer.
\par \lquote Can\rquote t the Order control Mundungus?\rquote  Harry demanded of the other two in a furious whisper. \lquote Can\rquote t they at least stop him stealing everything that\rquote s not fixed down when he\rquote s at Headquarters?\rquote 
\par \lquote Shh!\rquote  said Hermione desperately, looking around to make sure nobody was listening; there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at Harry with great interest, and Zabini was lolling against a pillar not far away. 
\lquote Harry, I\rquote d be annoyed too, I know it\rquote s your things he\rquote s stealing \endash \rquote 
\par Harry gagged on his Butterbeer; he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
\par \lquote Yeah, it\rquote s my stuff!\rquote  he said. \lquote No wonder he wasn\rquote t pleased to see me! Well, I\rquote m going to tell Dumbledore what\rquote s going on, he\rquote s the only one who scares Mundungus.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good idea,\rquote  whispered Hermione, clearly pleased that Harry was calming down. \lquote Ron, what are you staring at?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  said Ron, hastily looking away from the bar, but Harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid, Madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot.
\par \lquote I expect \'93nothing\'94\rquote s in the back getting more Firewhisky,\rquote  said Hermione waspishly.
\par Ron ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he evi\-dently considered to be a dignified silence. Harry was think\-ing about Sirius, and how he had hated 
those silver goblets anyway. Hermione drummed her fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron and the bar.
\par The moment Harry drained the last drops in his bottle she said, \lquote Shall we call it a day and go back to school, then?\rquote 
\par The other two nodded;
 it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed. Once again they drew their cloaks tightly around them, rearranged their scarves, pulled on their gloves; then followed Katie Bell and a friend out of the pub and back up
 the High Street. Harry\rquote s thoughts strayed to Ginny as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen slush. They had not met up with her, undoubtedly, thought Harry, because she and Dean were cosily closeted in Madam Puddifoot\rquote 
s teashop, that haunt of happy couples. Scowling, he bowed his head against the swirl\-ing sleet and trudged on.
\par It was a little while before Harry became aware that the voices of Katie Bell and her friend, which were being carried back to him on the wind, had become shriller 
and louder. Harry squinted at their indistinct figures. The two girls were having an argument about something Katie was holding in her hand.
\par \lquote It\rquote s nothing to do with you, Leanne!\rquote  Harry heard Katie say.
\par They rounded a corner in the lane, sleet coming thick and fast, blurring Harry\rquote 
s glasses. Just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe them, Leanne made to grab hold of the package Katie was holding; Katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground.
\par At once, Katie rose into the air, not as Ron had done, su
spended comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her arms outstretched, as though she were about to fly. Yet there was something wrong, something eerie ... her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind, but her eyes were closed and her face was quite 
empty of expression. Harry, Ron, Hermione and Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching.
\par Then, six feet above the ground, Katie let out a terrible scream. Her eyes flew open but whatever she could see, or whatever she was feeling, was clearly causing 
her terrible anguish. She screamed and screamed; Leanne started to scream too, and seized Katie\rquote s ankles, trying to tug her back to the ground. Harry, Ron and Hermione rushed forwards to help, but even as they grabbed Katie\rquote 
s legs, she fell on top of them; Harry and Ron managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could hardly hold her. Instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed, apparently unable to recognise any of them.
\par Harry looked around; the landscape seemed deserted.
\par \lquote Stay there!\rquote  he shouted at the others over the howling wind. \lquote I\rquote m going for help!\rquote 
\par He began to sprint towards the school; he had never seen anyone behave as Katie had just done and could not think what had caused it; he hurtled round a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs.
\par \lquote Hagrid!\rquote  he panted, disentangling himself from the hedge\-row into which he had fallen.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  said Hagrid, who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard, and was wearing his great, shaggy beaverskin coat. \lquote Jus\rquote  bin visitin\rquote  Grawp, he\rquote s comin\rquote  on so well yeh wouldn\rquote  \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote Hagrid, someone\rquote s hurt back there, or cursed, or some\-thing \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Wha\rquote ?\rquote  said Hagrid, bending lower to hear what Harry was saying over the raging wind.
\par \lquote Someone\rquote s been cursed!\rquote  bellowed Harry.
\par \lquote Cursed? Who\rquote s bin cursed \endash  not Ron? Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, it\rquote s not them, it\rquote s Katie Bell \endash  this way ...\rquote 
\par Together they ran back along the lane. It took them no time to find the little group of people around Katie, who was still writhing and screaming on the ground; Ron, Hermione and Leanne were all trying to quieten her.
\par \lquote Get back!\rquote  shouted Hagrid. \lquote Lemme see her!\rquote 
\par \lquote Something\rquote s happened to her!\rquote  sobbed Leanne. \lquote I don\rquote t know what \endash \rquote 
\par Hagrid stared at Katie for a second, then, without a word, bent down, scooped her into his arms and ran off towards the castle with her. Within seconds, Katie\rquote s piercing screams had died away and the only sound was the roar of the wind.
\par Hermione hurried over to Katie\rquote s wailing friend and put an arm around her.
\par \lquote It\rquote s Leanne, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par The girl nodded.
\par \lquote Did it just happen all of a sudden, or \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote It was when that package tore,\rquote  sobbed Leanne, pointing at the now sodden brown-paper pac
kage on the ground, which had split open to reveal a greenish glitter. Ron bent down, his hand outstretched, but Harry seized his arm and pulled him back.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Don\rquote t touch it!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par He crouched down. An ornate opal necklace was visible, poking out of the paper.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve seen that before,\rquote  said Harry, staring at the thing. \lquote It was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago. The label said it was cursed. Katie must have touched it.\rquote 
 He looked up at Leanne, who had started to shake uncontrollably. \lquote How did Katie get hold of this?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, that\rquote 
s why we were arguing. She came back from the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding it, said it was a surprise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it. She looked all funny when she said it ... oh no, oh no, I bet she\rquote d b
een Imperiused, and I didn\rquote t realise!\rquote 
\par Leanne shook with renewed sobs. Hermione patted her shoulder gently.
\par \lquote She didn\rquote t say who\rquote d given it to her, Leanne?\rquote 
\par \lquote No ... she wouldn\rquote t tell me ... and I said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school, but she just wouldn\rquote t listen and ... and then I tried to grab it from her ... and \endash  and \endash \rquote 
 Leanne let out a wail of despair.
\par \lquote We\rquote d better get up to school,\rquote  said Hermione, her arm still around Leanne, \lquote we\rquote ll be able to find out how she is. Come on ...\rquote 
\par Harry hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf from around his face and, ignoring Ron\rquote s gasp, carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll need to show this to Madam Pomfrey,\rquote  he said.
\par As they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road, Harry was thinking furiously. They had just entered the grounds when he spoke, unable to keep his thoughts to himself any longer.
\par \lquote Malfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at Borgin and Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a good look at it while I was hiding from him and his dad. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote I \endash  I dunno, Harry,\rquote  said Ron hesitantly. \lquote Loads of people go to Borgin and Burkes ... and didn\rquote t that girl say Katie got it in the girls\rquote  bathroom?\rquote 
\par \lquote She said she came back from the bathroom with it, she didn\rquote t necessarily get it in the bathroom itself \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote McGonagall!\rquote  said Ron warningly.
\par Harry looked up. Sure enough, Professor McGonagall was hurrying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them.
\par \lquote Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell \endash  upstairs to my office at once, please! What\rquote s that you\rquote re hold\-ing, Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s the thing she touched,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Good Lord,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, looking alarmed as she took the necklace from Harry. \lquote No, no, Filch, they\rquote re with me!\rquote 
 she added hastily, as Filch came shuffling eagerly across the Entrance Hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft. \lquote Take this necklace to Professor Snape at once, but be sure not to touch it, keep it wrapped in the scarf!\rquote 
\par Harry and the others followed Professor McGonagall upstairs and into her office. The sleet-spattered windows were rattling in their frames and the room was 
chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate. Professor McGonagall closed the door and swept round her desk to face Harry, Ron, Hermione and the still-sobbing Leanne.
\par \lquote Well?\rquote  she said sharply. \lquote What happened?\rquote 
\par Haltingly, and with many pauses while she at
tempted to control her crying, Leanne told Professor McGonagall how Katie had gone to the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks and returned holding the unmarked package, how Katie had seemed a little odd and how they had argued about the advis\-
ability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects, the argument culminating in the tussle over the parcel, which tore open. At this point, Leanne was so overcome there was no getting another word out of her.
\par \lquote All right,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, not unkindly, \lquote go up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.\rquote 
\par When she had left the room, Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, Ron and Hermione.
\par \lquote What happened when Katie touched the necklace?\rquote 
\par \lquote She rose up in the air,\rquote  said Harry, before either Ron or Hermione could speak. \lquote And then began to scream, and collapsed. Professor, can I see Professor Dumbledore, please?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, looking surprised.
\par \lquote Away?\rquote  Harry repeated angrily.
\par \lquote Yes, Potter, away!\rquote  said Professor McGonagall tartly. \lquote But anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me, I\rquote m sure!\rquote 
\par For a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor McGonagall did not invite confidences; Dumbledore,
 though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however wild. This was a life and death matter, though, and no moment to worry about being laughed at.
\par \lquote I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor.\rquote 
\par On one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment; on the other, Hermione shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry.
\par \lquote That is a very serious accusation, Potter,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, after a shocked pause. \lquote Do you have any proof?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but ...\rquote  and he told her about following Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him and Borgin.
\par When he had finished speaking, Professor McGonagall looked slightly confused.
\par \lquote Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something, he didn\rquote t have it with him. But that\rquote s not the point, the thing is that he bought something at the same time and I think it was that necklace \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But, Harry,\rquote  Hermione interrupted, \lquote Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said \'93no\'94 \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Because he didn\rquote t want to touch it, obviously!\rquote  said Harry angrily.
\par \lquote What he actually said was, \'93How would I look carrying that down the street?\'94,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace,\rquote  interjected Ron.
\par \lquote Oh, Ron,\rquote  said Hermione despairingly, \lquote it would be all wrapped up, so he wouldn\rquote t have to touch it, and quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see it! I think what\-
ever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky; something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street \endash  and in any case,\rquote  she pressed on loudly, before Harry could interrupt, \lquote 
I asked Borgin about the neck\-lace, don\rquote t you remember? When I went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep, I saw it there. And Borgin just told me the price, he didn\rquote t say it was already sold or anything \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote Well, you were being really obvious, he realised what you were up to within about five seconds, of course he wasn\rquote t going to tell you \endash  anyway, Malfoy could\rquote ve sent off for it since \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s enough!\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, as Hermione opened her mouth to retort, looking furious. \lquote 
Potter, I appreciate you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased. The same is probably true of hundreds of people \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  that\rquote s what I said \endash \rquote  muttered Ron.
\par \lquote \endash  and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in place this year, I do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and what is more,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, with an air of awful finality, \lquote Mr Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today.\rquote 
\par Harry gaped at her, deflating.
\par \lquote How do you know, Professor?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because he was doing detention with me. He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your suspicions, Potter,\rquote  she said as she marched past them, \lquote 
but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell. Good day to you all.\rquote 
\par She held open her office door. They had no choice but to file past her without another word.
\par Harry was angry with the other two for siding with McGonagall; nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened.
\par \lquote So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to?\rquote  asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs to the common room.
\par \lquote Goodness only knows,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote But whoever it was has had a narrow escape. No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace.\rquote 
\par \lquote It could\rquote ve been meant for loads of people,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Dumbledore \endash  the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. Or Slughorn \endash  Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wante
d him and they can\rquote t be pleased that he\rquote s sided with Dumbledore. Or \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Or you,\rquote  said Hermione, looking troubled.
\par \lquote Couldn\rquote t have been,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote or Katie would\rquote ve just turned round in the lane and given it to me, wouldn\rquote t she? I was behind her all the 
way out of the Three Broomsticks. It would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel out\-side Hogwarts, what with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle?\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, Malfoy wasn\rquote t in Hogsmeade!\rquote  said Hermione, actually stamping her foot in frustration.
\par \lquote He must have used an accomplice, then,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Crabbe or Goyle \endash  or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, he\rquote ll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he\rquote s joined up \endash \rquote 

\par Ron and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said \lquote there\rquote s no point arguing with him\rquote .
\par \lquote Dilligrout,\rquote  said Hermione firmly, as they reached the Fat Lady.
\par The portrait swung open to admit them to the common room. It was quite full and smelled of damp cloth
ing; many people seemed to have returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad weather. There was no buzz of fear or speculation, however: clearly, the news of Katie\rquote s fate had not yet spread.
\par \lquote It wasn\rquote t a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think about it,\rquote  said Ron, casually turfing a first-year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire, so that he could sit down. \lquote The curse didn\rquote 
t even make it into the castle. Not what you\rquote d call foolproof.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re right,\rquote  said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first-year again. \lquote It wasn\rquote t very well-thought-out at all.\rquote 
\par \lquote But since when has Malfoy been one of the world\rquote s great thinkers?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par Neither Ron nor Hermione answered him.

 said Harry to Ron and Hermione, who continued their new policy of feigning deaf\-ness whenever Harry mentioned his Malfoy-is-a-Death-Eater theory.
\par Harry had wondered whether Dumbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for Monday night\rquote s lesson, but having had no word to the contrary, he presented himself outside Dumbledore\rquote s office at eight o\rquote 
clock, knocked, and was told to enter. There sat Dumbledore, looking unusually tired; his hand was as black and burned as ever, but he smiled when he gestured to Harry to sit down. The Pensieve was sitting on the desk again, casting silvery specks of 
light over the ceiling.
\par \lquote You have had a busy time while I have been away,\rquote  Dumbledore said. \lquote I believe you witnessed Katie\rquote s accident.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, sir. How is she?\rquote 
\par \lquote Still very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. She appears to have brushed the necklace 
with the smallest possible amount of skin: there was a tiny hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she even held it in her ungloved hand, she would have died, perhaps instantly. Luckily Professor Snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of
 the curse \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Why him?\rquote  asked Harry quickly. \lquote Why not Madam Pomfrey?\rquote 
\par \lquote Impertinent,\rquote  said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall, and Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius\rquote s great-great-grandfather, raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping. \lquote 
I would not have permitted a student to question the way Hogwarts operated in my day.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, thank you, Phineas,\rquote  said Dumbledore quellingly. \lquote Professor Snape knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, Harry. Anyway, the St Mungo\rquote 
s staff are sending me hourly reports and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery in time.\rquote 
\par \lquote Where were you this weekend, sir?\rquote  Harry asked, disregard\-ing a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck, a feeling apparently shared by Phineas Nigellus, who hissed softly.
\par \lquote I would rather not say just now,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote How\-ever, I shall tell you in due course.\rquote 
\par \lquote You will?\rquote  said Harry, startled.
\par \lquote Yes, I expect so,\rquote  said Dumbledore, withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand.
\par \lquote Sir,\rquote  said Harry tentatively, \lquote I met Mundungus in Hogsmeade.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with light-fingered contempt,\rquote  said Dumbledore, frowning a little. \lquote 
He has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the Three Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads facing me. However, rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of Sirius\rquote s old possessions.\rquote 
\par \lquote That mangy old half-blood has been stealing Black heir\-looms?\rquote  said Phineas Nigellus, incensed; and he stalked out of his frame, undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
\par \lquote Professor,\rquote  said Harry, after a short pause, \lquote did Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt? About Draco Malfoy?\rquote 
\par \lquote She told me of your suspicions, yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote And do you \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate any\-one who might have had a hand in Katie\rquote s accident,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote But what concerns me now, Harry, is our lesson.\rquote 
\par Harry felt slightly resentful at this: if their lessons were so very important, why had there been such a long gap between the first and second?
 However, he said no more about Draco Malfoy, but watched as Dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the Pensieve, and began swirling the stone basin once more between his long-fingered hands.
\par \lquote You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord Voldemort\rquote 
s beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle, Tom Riddle, had abandoned his witch wife, Merope, and returned to his family home in Little Hangleton. Merope was left alone in London, expecting the baby who would one day become Lord Voldemort.
\rquote 
\par \lquote How do you know she was in London, sir?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote who, by an odd coincidence, helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing.\rquote 
\par He swilled the contents of the
 Pensieve as Harry had seen him swill them before, much as a gold prospector sifts for gold. Up out of the swirling, silvery mass rose a little old man, revolving slowly in the Pensieve, silver as a ghost but much more solid, with a thatch of hair that co
mpletely covered his eyes.
\par \lquote Yes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was brought in by a young witch just before Christmas, oh, many years ago now. She said she needed the gold badly, well, that much was obvious. Covered in rags and pretty far along
 ... going to have a baby, see. She said the locket had been Slytherin\rquote s. Well, we hear that sort of story all the time, \'93Oh, this was Merlin\rquote s, this was, his favourite teapot,\'94
 but when I looked at it, it had his mark all right, and a few simple spells were enough to tell me the truth. Of course, that made it near enough priceless. She didn\rquote 
t seem to have any idea how much it was worth. Happy to get ten Galleons for it. Best bargain we ever made!\rquote 
\par Dumbledore gave the Pensieve an extra-vigorous shake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory whence he had come.
\par \lquote He only gave her ten Galleons?\rquote  said Harry indignantly.
\par \lquote Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote So we know that, near the end of her preg\-nancy, Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of gold, desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable pos
\-session, the locket that was one of Marvolo\rquote s treasured family heirlooms.\rquote 
\par \lquote But she could do magic!\rquote  said Harry impatiently. \lquote She could have got food and everything for herself by magic, couldn\rquote t she?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote perhaps she could. But it is my belief \endash  I am guessing again, but I am sure I am right \endash  that when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I do not think 
that she wanted to be a witch any longer. Of course, it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers; that can happen. In any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her 
own life.\rquote 
\par \lquote She wouldn\rquote t even stay alive for her son?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore raised his eyebrows.
\par \lquote Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry quickly, \lquote but she had a choice, didn\rquote t she, not like my mother \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Your mother had a choice, too,\rquote  said Dumbledore gently. \lquote 
Yes, Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her, but do not judge her too harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother\rquote s courage. And now, if you will stand ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Where are we going?\rquote  Harry asked, as Dumbledore joined him at the front of the desk.
\par \lquote This time,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote we are going to enter }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 my }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
memory. I think you will find it both rich in detail and satis\-fyingly accurate. After you, Harry ...\rquote 
\par Harry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool sur\-
face of the memory and then he was falling through darkness again ... Seconds later his feet hit firm ground, he opened his eyes and found that he and Dumbledore were standing in a bustling, old-fashioned London street.
\par \lquote There I am,\rquote  said Dumbledore brightly, pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a horse-drawn milk cart.
\par This younger Albus Dumbledore\rquote s long hair and beard were auburn. Having reached their side of the street, he strode off along the pavement, drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing.
\par \lquote Nice suit, sir,\rquote  said Harry, before he could st
op himself, but Dumbledore merely chuckled as they followed his younger self a short distance, finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building surrounded by high railings. He mounted the few st
eps lead\-ing to the front door and knocked once. After a moment or two the door was opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron.
\par \lquote Good afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs Cole, who, I believe, is the matron here?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said the bewildered-looking girl, taking in Dumbledore\rquote s eccentric appearance. \lquote Um ... just a mo\rquote  ... MRS COLE!\rquote  she bellowed over her shoulder.
\par Harry heard a distant voice shouting something in response. The girl turned back to Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Come in, she\rquote s on \rquote er way.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore steppe
d into a hallway tiled in black and white; the whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean. Harry and the older Dumbledore followed. Before the front door had closed behind them, a skinny, harassed-looking woman came scurrying towards them. She had a shar
p-featured face that appeared more anxious than unkind and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked towards Dumbledore.
\par \lquote ... and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley\rquote s oozing all over his sheets \endash  chicken pox on top of everything else,\rquote 
 she said to nobody in particular, and then her eyes fell upon Dumbledore and she stopped dead in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold.
\par \lquote Good afternoon,\rquote  said Dumbledore, holding out his hand.
\par Mrs Cole simply gaped.
\par \lquote My name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter request\-ing an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today.\rquote 
\par Mrs Cole blinked. Apparently deciding that Dumbledore was not a hallucination, she said feebly, \lquote Oh, yes. Well \endash  well, then \endash  you\rquote d better come into my room. Yes.\rquote 
\par She led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room, part office. It was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched. 
She invited Dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk, eyeing him nervously.
\par \lquote I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Are you family?\rquote  asked Mrs Cole.
\par \lquote No, I am a teacher,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I have come to offer Tom a place at my school.\rquote 
\par \lquote What school\rquote s this, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote It is called Hogwarts,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote And how come you\rquote re interested in Tom?\rquote 
\par \lquote We believe he has qualities we are looking for.\rquote 
\par \lquote You mean he\rquote s won a scholarship? How can he have done? He\rquote s never been entered for one.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, his name has been down for our school since birth \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Who registered him? His parents?\rquote 
\par There was no doubt that Mrs Cole was an inconveniently sharp woman. Apparently Dumbledore thought so too, for Harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs Cole
\rquote s desktop.
\par \lquote Here,\rquote  said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper, \lquote I think this will make every\-thing clear.\rquote 
\par Mrs Cole\rquote s eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment.
\par \lquote That seems perfectly in order,\rquote  she said placidly, handing it back. Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before.
\par \lquote Er \endash  may I offer you a glass of gin?\rquote  she said in an extra-refined voice.
\par \lquote Thank you very much,\rquote  said Dumbledore, beaming.
\par It soon became clear that Mrs Cole was no novice when it came to gin-drinking. Pouring both of them a generous measure, she drained her own glass in one. Smacking her lips frankly, she smiled at Dumbledore for the first time, and he didn\rquote 
t hesitate to press his advantage.
\par \lquote I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddle\rquote s history? I think he was born here in the orphanage?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Mrs Cole, helping herself to more gin. \lquote I remember it clear as anything, because I\rquote d just started here myself. New Year\rquote 
s Eve and bitter cold, snowing, you know. Nasty night. And this girl, not much older than I was myself at the time, came staggering up the front steps. Well, she wasn\rquote t the first. We took her in and she had the baby within the hour. 
And she was dead in another hour.\rquote 
\par Mrs Cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin.
\par \lquote Did she say anything before she died?\rquote  asked Dumbledore. \lquote Anything about the boy\rquote s father, for instance?\rquote 
\par \lquote Now, as it happens, she did,\rquote  said Mrs Cole, who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now, with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story.
\par \lquote I remember she said to me, \'93I hope he looks like his papa,\'94 and I won\rquote t lie, she was right to hope it, because she was no beauty \endash  and then she told me he was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 her }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 father \endash  yes, I know, funny name, isn\rquote 
t it? We wondered whether she came from a circus \endash  and she said the boy\rquote s surname was to be Riddle. And she died soon after that without another word.
\par \lquote Well, we named him just as she\rquote d said, it seemed so important to the poor girl, but no Tom nor Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him, nor any family at all, so he stayed in the orphanage and he\rquote 
s been here ever since.\rquote 
\par Mrs Cole helped herself, almost absent-mindedly, to another healthy measure of gin. Two pink spots had appeared high on her cheek-bones. Then she said, \lquote He\rquote s a funny boy.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I thought he might be.\rquote 
\par \lquote He was a funny baby, too. He hardly ever cried, you know. And then, when he got a little older, he was ... odd.\rquote 
\par \lquote Odd, in what way?\rquote  asked Dumbledore gently.
\par \lquote Well, he \endash \rquote 
\par But Mrs Cole pulled up short, and there was nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot Dumbledore over her gin glass.
\par \lquote He\rquote s definitely got a place at your school, you say?\rquote 
\par \lquote Definitely,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote And nothing I say can change that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll be taking him away, whatever?\rquote 
\par \lquote Whatever,\rquote  repeated Dumbledore gravely.
\par She squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him. Apparently she decided she could, because she said in a sudden rush, \lquote He scares the other children.\rquote 
\par \lquote You mean he is a bully?\rquote  asked Dumbledore.
\par \lquote I think he must be,\rquote  said Mrs Cole, frowning slightly, \lquote but it\rquote s very hard to catch him at it. There have been incidents ... nasty things ...\rquote 
\par Dumbledore did not press her, though Harry could tell that he was interested. She took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still.
\par \lquote Billy Stubbs\rquote s rabbit ... well, Tom }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 said }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 he didn\rquote 
t do it and I don\rquote t see how he could have done, but even so, it didn\rquote t hang itself from the rafters, did it?\rquote 
\par \lquote I shouldn\rquote t think so, no,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly.
\par \lquote But I\rquote m jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it. All I know is he and Billy had argued the day before. And then \endash \rquote  Mrs Cole took another swig of gin, slopping a little over her chin this time, \lquote 
on the summer outing \endash  we take them out, you know, once a year, to the countryside or to the seaside \endash  well, Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were never quite right afterwards, and all we ever got out of them was that they\rquote 
d gone into a cave with Tom Riddle. He swore they\rquote d just gone exploring, but }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 something }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 happened in there, I\rquote m sure of it. And, well, there have been a lot of things, funny things ...\rquote 
\par She looked at Dumbledore again, and though her cheeks were flushed, her gaze was steady.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think many people will be sorry to see the back of him.\rquote 
\par \lquote You understand, I\rquote m sure, that we will not be keeping him permanently?\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote He will have to return here, at the very least, every summer.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, well, that\rquote s better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker,\rquote  said Mrs Cole with a slight hiccough. She got to her feet and Harry was impressed to see that she was q
uite steady, even though two-thirds of the gin was now gone. \lquote I suppose you\rquote d like to see him?\rquote 
\par \lquote Very much,\rquote  said Dumbledore, rising too.
\par She led him out of her office and up the stone stairs, calling out instructions and admonitions to helpers and childre
n as she passed. The orphans, Harry saw, were all wearing the same kind of greyish tunic. They looked reasonably well-cared-for, but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up.
\par \lquote Here we are,\rquote  said Mrs Cole, as they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor. She knocked twice and entered.
\par \lquote Tom? You\rquote ve got a visitor. This is Mr Dumberton \endash  sorry, Dunderbore. He\rquote s come to tell you \endash  well, I\rquote ll let him do it.\rquote 
\par Harry and the two Dumbledores enter
ed the room and Mrs Cole closed the door on them. It was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe a wooden chair, and an iron bedstead. A boy was sitting on top of the grey blankets, his legs stretched out in front of him, holding a boo
k.
\par There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddle\rquote s face. Merope had got her dying wish: he was his handsome father in miniature, tall for eleven years old, dark-haired and pale. His eyes narrowed slightly as he took in Dumbledore\rquote s eccen\-
tric appearance. There was a moment\rquote s silence.
\par \lquote How do you do, Tom?\rquote  said Dumbledore, walking forwards and holding out his hand.
\par The boy hesitated, then took it, and they shook hands. Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside Riddle, so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor.
\par \lquote I am Professor Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote \'93Professor\'94?\rquote  repeated Riddle. He looked wary. \lquote Is that like \'93doctor\'94? What are you here for? Did }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 she }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 get you in to have a look at me?\rquote 
\par He was pointing at the door through which Mrs Cole had just left.
\par \lquote No, no,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t believe you,\rquote  said Riddle. \lquote She wants me looked at, doesn\rquote t she? Tell the truth!\rquote 
\par He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking. It was a command, and it sounded a
s though he had given it many times before. His eyes had widened and he was glaring at Dumbledore, who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring, though he looked, if any\-thing, warier still.

\par \lquote Who are you?\rquote 
\par \lquote I have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts. I have come to offer you a place at my school \endash  your new school, if you would like to come.\rquote 
\par Riddle\rquote s reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt from the bed and backed away from Dumbledore, looking furious.
\par \lquote You can\rquote t kid me! The asylum, that\rquote s where you\rquote re from, isn\rquote t it? \'93Professor\'94, yes, of course \endash  well, I\rquote m not going, see? That old cat\rquote 
s the one who should be in the asylum. I never did anything to little Amy Benson or Dennis Bishop, and you can ask them, they\rquote ll tell you!\rquote 
\par \lquote I am not from the asylum,\rquote  said Dumbledore patiently. \lquote I am a teacher and, if you will sit down calmly, I shall tell you about Hogwarts. Of course, if you would rather not come to the school, nobody will force you \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote I\rquote d like to see them try,\rquote  sneered Riddle.
\par \lquote Hogwarts,\rquote  Dumbledore went on, as though he had not heard Riddle\rquote s last words, \lquote is a school for people with special abilities \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not mad!\rquote 
\par \lquote I know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a school for mad people. It is a school of magic.\rquote 
\par There was silence. Riddle had frozen, his face expression\-less, but his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of Dumbledore\rquote s, as though trying to catch one of them lying.
\par \lquote Magic?\rquote  he repeated in a whisper.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote It\rquote s ... it\rquote s magic, what I can do?\rquote 
\par \lquote What is it that you can do?\rquote 
\par \lquote All sorts,\rquote  breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks; he looked fevered. \lquote I can ma
ke things move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want them to do, without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me. I can make them hurt if I want to.\rquote 
\par His legs were trembling. He stumbled forwards and sat down on the bed again, staring at his hands, his head bowed as though in prayer.
\par \lquote I knew I was different,\rquote  he whispered to his own quivering fingers. \lquote I knew I was special. Always, I knew there was something.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, you were quite right,\rquote  said Dumbledore, who was no longer smiling, but watching Riddle intently. \lquote You are a wizard.\rquote 
\par Riddle lifted his head. His face was transfigured: there was a wild happiness upon it, yet for some reason it did not make him better-looking; on the contrary, his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher, his expression almost bestial.
\par \lquote Are you a wizard too?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I am.\rquote 
\par \lquote Prove it,\rquote  said Riddle at once, in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said \lquote tell the truth\rquote .
\par Dumbledore raised his eyebrows.
\par \lquote If, as I take it, you are accepting your place at Hogwarts \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Of course I am!\rquote 
\par \lquote Then you will address me as \'93Professor\'94 or \'93sir\'94.\rquote 
\par Riddle\rquote s expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said, in an unrecognisably polite voice, \lquote I\rquote m sorry, sir. I meant \endash  please, Professor, could you show me \endash ?\rquote 
\par Harry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse, that he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time for prac\-tical demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they were currently in a building full of Muggles, and must therefo
re be cautious. To his great surprise, however, Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner and gave the wand a casual flick.
\par The wardrobe burst into flames.
\par Riddle jumped to his feet. Harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage; all his worldly possessions must have been in there; but even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore the flames vanished, leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged.
\par Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore, then, his expression greedy, he pointed at the wand.
\par \lquote Where can I get one of them?\rquote 
\par \lquote All in good time,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I think there is some\-thing trying to get out of your wardrobe.\rquote 
\par And sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from inside it. For the first time, Riddle looked frightened.
\par \lquote Open the door,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par Riddle hesitated, then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail of thread\-bare clothes, a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it.
\par \lquote Take it out,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par Riddle took down the quaking box. He looked unnerved.
\par \lquote Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have?\rquote  asked Dumbledore.
\par Riddle threw Dumbledore a long, clear, calculating look.
\par \lquote Yes, I suppose so, sir,\rquote  he said finally, in an expressionless voice.
\par \lquote Open it,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par Riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents on to his bed without looking at them. Harry, who ha
d expected something much more exciting, saw a mess of small, everyday objects; a yo-yo, a silver thimble and a tarnished mouth-organ among them. Once free of the box, they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets.
\par \lquote You will return them to their owners with your apologies,\rquote  said Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand back into his jacket. \lquote I shall know whether it has been done. And be warned: thieving is not tolerated at Hogwarts.\rquote 
\par Riddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore. At last he said in a colourless voice, \lquote Yes, sir.\rquote 
\par \lquote At Hogwarts,\rquote  Dumbledore went on, \lquote we teach you not only to use magic, but to control it. You have \endash  inadvertently, I am sure \endash  been using your powers in a way that 
is neither taught nor tolerated at our school. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to allow your magic to run away with you. But you should know that Hogwarts can expel students, and the Ministry of Magic \endash  yes, there is a Ministry 
\endash  will punish law\-breakers still more severely. All new wizards must accept that, in entering our world, they abide by our laws.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, sir,\rquote  said Riddle again.
\par It was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box. When he had finished he turned to Dumbledore and said baldly, \lquote I haven\rquote t got any money.
\rquote 
\par \lquote That is easily remedied,\rquote  said Dumbledore, drawing a leather money-pouch from his pocket. \lquote There is a fund at Hogwarts f
or those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on second-hand, but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Where do you buy spellbooks?\rquote  interrupted Riddle, who had taken the heavy money-bag without thanking Dumbledore, and was now examining a fat gold Galleon.
\par \lquote In Diagon Alley,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I have your list of books and school equipment with me. I can help you find everything \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re coming with me?\rquote  asked Riddle, looking up.
\par \lquote Certainly, if you \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t need you,\rquote  said Riddle. \lquote I\rquote m used to doing things for myself, I go round London on my own all the time. How do you get to this Diagon Alley \endash  sir?\rquote  he added, catching Dumbledore\rquote s eye.

\par Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle, but once again he
 was surprised. Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment, and, after telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage, he said, \lquote You will be able to see it, although Muggles around you 
\endash  non-magical people, that is \endash  will not. Ask for Tom the barman \endash  easy enough to remember, as he shares your name \endash \rquote 
\par Riddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to displace an irksome fly.
\par \lquote You dislike the name \'93Tom\'94?\rquote 
\par \lquote There are a lot of Toms,\rquote  muttered Riddle. Then, as though he could not suppress the question, as though it burst from him in spite of himself, he asked, \lquote Was my father a wizard? He was called Tom Riddle too, they\rquote ve told me.
\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m afraid I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Dumbledore, his voice gentle.
\par \lquote My mother can\rquote t have been magic, or she wouldn\rquote t have died,\rquote  said Riddle, more to himself than Dumbledore. \lquote It must\rquote ve been him. So \endash  when I\rquote ve got all my stuff \endash 
 when do I come to this Hogwarts?\rquote 
\par \lquote All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote You will leave from King\rquote s Cross Station on the first of September. There is a train ticket in there, too.\rquote 
\par Riddle nodded. Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand again. Taking it, Riddle said, \lquote I can speak to snakes. I found out when we\rquote ve been to the country on trips \endash 
 they find me, they whisper to me. Is that normal for a wizard?\rquote 
\par Harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment, determined to impress.
\par \lquote It is unusual,\rquote  said Dumbledore, after a moment\rquote s hesita\-tion, \lquote but not unheard of.\rquote 
\par His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddle\rquote s face. They stood for a moment, man and boy, staring at each other. Then the handshake was broken; Dumbledore was at the door.
\par \lquote Goodbye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts.\rquote 
\par \lquote I think that will do,\rquote  said the white-haired Dumbledore at Harry\rquote s side, and seconds later they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more, before landing squarely in the present-day office.
\par \lquote Sit down,\rquote  said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry.
\par Harry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just seen.
\par \lquote He believed it much quicker than I did \endash  I mean, when you told him he was a wizard,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I didn\rquote t believe Hagrid at first, when he told me.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was \endash  to use his word \endash  \'93special\'94,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Did you know \endash  then?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time?\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote No, I had no idea that he
 was to grow up to be what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by him. I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, something I should have done in any case, given that he was alone and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to 
do for others\rquote  sake as much as his.
\par \lquote His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well-developed for such a young wizard and \endash  most interestingly and omin\-ously of all \endash  he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them, and begun to us
e them consciously. And as you saw, they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards: he was already using magic against other people, to frighten, to punish, to control. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl h
e lured into a cave were most suggestive ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 I can make them hurt if I want to ...\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote And he was a Parselmouth,\rquote  interjected Harry.
\par \lquote Yes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly connected with the Dark Arts, although, as we know, there are Parsel\-mouths a
mong the great and the good too. In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy and domination.
\par \lquote Time is making fools of us again,\rquote  said Dumbledore, indi\-cating the dark sky beyond the windows. \lquote 
But before we part, I want to draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just witnessed, for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in future meetings.
\par \lquote Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle\rquote s reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first name, \'93Tom\'94?\rquote 
\par Harry nodded.
\par \lquote There he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people, anything that made him ordinary. Even then, he wished to be different, separate, notorious. He shed his name, as you know, within a few short years of that conversa\-
tion and created the mask of \'93Lord Voldemort\'94 behind which he has been hidden for so long.
\par \lquote I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly self-sufficient, secretive and, apparently
, friendless? He did not want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He preferred to operate alone. The adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to 
him, even understand him. They are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.
\par \lquote And lastly \endash  I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry \endash  the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. Yo
u saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room. These were taken from victims of his bullying behaviour, souvenirs, if you will, of particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in mind this magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will be 
important later.
\par \lquote And now, it really is time for bed.\rquote 
\par Harry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell upon the little table on which Marvolo Gaunt\rquote s ring had rested last time, but the ring was no longer there.
\par \lquote Yes, Harry?\rquote  said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to a halt.
\par \lquote The ring\rquote s gone,\rquote  said Harry, looking around. \lquote But I thought you might have the mouth-organ or something.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of his half-moon spectacles.
\par \lquote Very astute, Harry, but the mouth-organ was only ever a mouth-organ.\rquote 
\par And on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry, who under\-stood himself to be dismissed.

Harry had Herbology first thing the following morning. He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch towards the gre
enhouses. The weekend\rquote s brutal wind had died out at last; the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct green\-house.

 said Professor Sprout briskly, bustling over and looking stern. \lquote You\rquote re lagging behind, every\-body else has started and Neville\rquote s already got his first pod!\rquote 
\par They looked round; sure enough, there sat Neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit.
\par \lquote OK, Professor, we\rquote re starting now!\rquote  said Ron, adding quietly, when she had turned away again, \lquote Should\rquote ve used }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Muffliato, }{

\par \lquote No, we shouldn\rquote t!\rquote  said Hermione at once, looking, as she always did, intensely cross at the thought of the Half-Blood Prince and his spells. \lquote Well, come on ... we\rquote d better get going ...\rquote 
\par She gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them.
\par It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramble-like vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air. One tangled itself in Hermione\rquote 
s hair and Ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs; Harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentacle-like branches; Hermione plunged her arm bravely i
nto this hole, which closed like a trap around her elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open again and Hermione snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like Neville\rquote 
s. At once, the prickly vines shot back inside and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood.
\par \lquote You know, I don\rquote t think I\rquote ll be having any of these in my garden when I\rquote ve got my own place,\rquote  said Ron, pushing his goggles up on to his forehead and wiping sweat from his face.
\par \lquote Pass me a bowl,\rquote  said Hermione, holding the pulsating pod at arm\rquote s length; Harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be squeamish, squeeze it out, they\rquote re best when they\rquote re fresh!\rquote  called Professor Sprout.
\par \lquote Anyway,\rquote  said Hermione, continuing their interrupted con\-versation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them, \lquote Slughorn\rquote s going to have a Christmas party, Harry, and there\rquote s no way you\rquote 
ll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come.\rquote 
\par Harry groaned. Ron, meanwhile, who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it, stand\-ing up and squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, \lquote And this is another party just for Slughorn\rquote s favourites, is it?
\rquote 
\par \lquote Just for the Slug Club, yes,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par The pod flew out from under Ron\rquote s fingers and hit the greenhouse glass, rebounding on to the back of Professor Sprout\rquote s head and knocking off her old patched hat. Harry went to retrieve the pod; when he got back, Hermione was saying, 
\lquote Look, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 didn\rquote t make up the name \'93Slug Club\'94 \endash \rquote

\lquote It\rquote s pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why don\rquote t you try getting off with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re allowed to bring guests,\rquote  said Hermione, who for some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, \lquote and I was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 going }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par Harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little further, so that he need not have been sitting there with the pair of them. Unnoticed by either, he seized the bowl t
hat contained the pod and began to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every word of their conversation.
\par \lquote You were going to ask me?\rquote  asked Ron, in a completely different voice.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Hermione angrily. \lquote But obviously if you\rquote d rather I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 got off with McLaggen }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 ...\rquote 
\par There was a pause while Harry continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel.
\par \lquote No, I wouldn\rquote t,\rquote  said Ron, in a very quiet voice.
\par Harry missed the pod, hit the bowl and it shattered.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Reparo,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and the bowl sprang back together again. The crash, how\-ever, appeared to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harry\rquote s presence. Hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussin
g about for her copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Flesh-Eating Trees of the World }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself.
\par \lquote Hand that over, Harry,\rquote  said Hermione hurriedly, \lquote it says we\rquote re supposed to puncture them with something sharp ...\rquote 
\par Harry passed her the pod in the bowl, he and Ron both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and dived, once more, for the stump.
\par It was not as though he was really surprised, thought Harry, as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throt\-
tling him; he had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later. But he was not sure how he felt about it ... he and Cho were now too embarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if R
on and Hermione started going out together, then split up? Could their friend\-
ship survive it? Harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them. And then, what if they didn\rquote 
t split up? What if they became like Bill and Fleur, and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good?
\par \lquote Gotcha!\rquote  yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the stump just as Hermione managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms.
\par The rest of the lesson passed without further mention of Slughorn\rquote s party. Although Harry watched his two friends more closely over the next few days, R
on and Hermione did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual. Harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what happened under the influence of Butterbeer in Slughorn\rquote 
s dimly lit room on the night of the party. In the meantime, however, he had more pressing worries.
\par Katie Bell was still in St Mungo\rquote s Hospital with no prospect of leaving, which meant that the promising Gryffindor team Harry had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser short. 
He kept putting off replacing Katie in the hope that she would return, but their opening match against Slytherin was looming and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time to play.
\par Harry did not think he could stand another full-house tryo
ut. With a sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch, he cornered Dean Thomas after Transfiguration one day. Most of the class had already left, although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room, all of Hermione
\rquote s creation; nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air.
\par \lquote Are you still interested in playing Chaser?\rquote 
\par \lquote Wha\emdash ? Yeah, of course!\rquote  said Dean excitedly. Over Dean\rquote s shoulder Harry saw Seamus Finnigan slamming his books into his bag, look
ing sour. One of the reasons why Harry would have preferred not to have to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus would not like it. On the other hand, he had to do what was best for the team, and Dean had out-flown Seamus at the tryouts.
\par \lquote Well then, you\rquote re in,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote There\rquote s a practice tonight, seven o\rquote clock.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Dean. \lquote Cheers, Harry! Blimey, I can\rquote t wait to tell Ginny!\rquote 
\par He sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and Seamus alone together, an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on Seamus\rquote s head as one of Hermione\rquote s canaries whizzed over them.
\par Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Katie\rquote s substitute. There was much muttering in the com\-mon room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two 
of his classmates for the team. As Harry had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career, he was not particularly bothered, but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against Slytherin. If Gryffin
dor won, Harry knew that the whole house would forget that they had criticised him and swear that they had always known it was a great team. If they lost ... well, Harry thought wryly, he had still endured worse mutterings ...
\par Harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly that evening; he worked well with Ginny and Demelza. The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting better all the time. The only problem was Ron.
\par Harry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from 
nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities. After letting in half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, his technique became wilder 
and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the mouth.
\par \lquote It was an accident, I\rquote m sorry, Demelza, really sorry!\rquote  Ron shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground drip\-ping blood everywhere. \lquote I just \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Panicked,\rquote  Ginny said angrily, landing next to Demelza and examining her fat lip. \lquote You prat, Ron, look at the state of her!\rquote 
\par \lquote I can fix that,\rquote  said Harry, landing beside the two girls, pointing his wand at Demelza\rquote s mouth and saying \lquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Episkey\rquote . }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote And Ginny, don\rquote t call Ron a prat, you\rquote re not the captain of this team \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should \endash \rquote 
\par Harry forced himself not to laugh.
\par \lquote In the air, everyone, let\rquote s go ...\rquote 
\par Overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term, though Harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when they were this close to the match.
\par \lquote Good work, everyone, I think we\rquote ll flatten Slytherin,\rquote  he said bracingly, and the Chasers and Beaters left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves.
\par \lquote I played like a sack of dragon dung,\rquote  said Ron in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind Ginny.
\par \lquote No you didn\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry firmly. \lquote You\rquote re the best Keeper I tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves.\rquote 
\par He kept up a rele
ntless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle, and by the time they reached the second floor Ron was looking marginally more cheerful. When Harry pushed open the tapestry to take their usual short cut up to Gryffindor Tower, however, they fo
und themselves looking at Dean and Ginny, who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as if glued together.
\par It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in Harry\rquote s stomach, clawing at his insides: hot blood seemed to flood his br
ain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness, he heard Ron\rquote s voice as though from a great distance away.
\par \lquote Oi!\rquote 
\par Dean and Ginny broke apart and looked round.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Ginny.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t want to find my own sister snogging people in public!\rquote 
\par \lquote This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in!\rquote  said Ginny.
\par Dean was looking embarrassed. He gave Harry a shifty grin that Harry did not return, as the new-born monster inside him was roaring for Dean\rquote s instant dismissal from the team.
\par \lquote Er ... c\rquote mon, Ginny,\rquote  said Dean, \lquote let\rquote s go back to the com\-mon room ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You go!\rquote  said Ginny. \lquote I want a word with my dear brother!\rquote 
\par Dean left, looking as though he was not sorry to depart the scene.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at Ron, \lquote let\rquote s get this straight once and for all. It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Ron \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, it is!\rquote  said Ron, just as angrily. \lquote D\rquote you think I want people saying my sister\rquote s a \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote A what?\rquote  shouted Ginny, drawing her wand. \lquote A }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 what, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 exactly?
\rquote 
\par \lquote He doesn\rquote t mean anything, Ginny \endash \rquote  said Harry automatic\-ally, though the monster was roaring its approval of Ron\rquote s words.
\par \lquote Oh yes he does!\rquote  she said, flaring up at Harry. \lquote Just because }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 he\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Shut your mouth!\rquote  bellowed Ron, bypassing red and turn\-ing maroon.
\par \lquote No, I will not!\rquote  yelled Ginny, beside herself. \lquote I\rquote ve seen you with Phlegm, hoping she\rquote ll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her, it\rquote 
s pathetic! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself you wouldn\rquote t mind so much that everyone else does it!\rquote 
\par Ron had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped swiftly between them.
\par \lquote You don\rquote t know what you\rquote re talking about!\rquote  Ron roared, trying to get a clear shot at Ginny around Harry, who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched. \lquote Just because I don\rquote t do it in public 
\endash !\rquote 
\par Ginny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Harry out of the way.
\par \lquote Been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow?\rquote 
\par \lquote You \endash \rquote 
\par A streak of orange light flew under Harry\rquote s left arm and missed Ginny by inches; Harry pushed Ron up against the wall.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be stupid \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Harry\rquote s snogged Cho Chang!\rquote  shouted Ginny, who sounded close to tears now. \lquote And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, it\rquote s only you who acts like it\rquote s something disgusting, Ron, and that\rquote s because you\rquote 
ve got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!\rquote 
\par And with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go of Ron; the look on his face was murderous. They both stood there, breathing heavily, until Mrs Norris, Filch\rquote s cat, appeared round the corner, which broke the tension.
\par \lquote C\rquote mon,\rquote  said Harry, as the sound of Filch\rquote s shuffling feet reached their ears.
\par They hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor corridor. \lquote Oi, out of the way!\rquote  Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toad-spawn.
\par Harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt disorientated, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 It\rquote

\par But unbidden into his mind came an image of that same deserted corridor with himself kissing Ginny instead ... the monster in his chest purred ... but then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things like 
\lquote betrayal of trust\rquote  ... \lquote supposed to be my friend\rquote  ...
\par \lquote D\rquote you think Hermione did snog Krum?\rquote  Ron asked abruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady. Harry gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no Ron intruded, in which he and Ginny were quite alone 
\endash 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  he said confusedly. \lquote Oh ... er ...\rquote 
\par The honest answer was \lquote yes\rquote , but he did not want to give it. However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harry\rquote s face.
\par \lquote Dilligrout,\rquote  he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common room.
\par Neither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own thoughts.
\par Harry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince himself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely older-brotherly. They had lived, had they not, like brother and sister all summer, play\-
ing Quidditch, teasing Ron and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He had known Ginny for years now ... it was natural that he should feel protective ... natural that he should want to look out for her ... want to rip Dean limb from limb for kissing her
 ... no ... he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling ...
\par Ron gave a great grunting snore.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 She\rquote s Ron\rquote s sister, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Harry told himself firmly. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37

friendship with Ron for anything. He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near Ginny.
\par Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beater\rquote 
s bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered Hermione with an icy, sneering indif\-
ference. What was more, Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast-Ended Skrewt. Harry spent the day attempting to keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no success: finally, Hermione dep
arted for bed in high dudgeon and Ron stalked off to the boys\rquote  dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first-years for looking at him.
\par To Harry\rquote s dismay, Ron\rquote s new aggression did not wear off over the next few days. Worse still, it coincided
 with an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills, which made him still more aggressive, so that during the final Quidditch practice before Saturday\rquote 
s match, he failed to save every single goal the Chasers aimed at him, but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced Demelza Robins to tears.
\par \lquote You shut up and leave her alone!\rquote  shouted Peakes, who was about two-thirds Ron\rquote s height, though admittedly carrying a heavy bat.
\par \lquote ENOUGH!\rquote  bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny glower\-ing in Ron\rquote s direction and, remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the Bat Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got out of hand. \lquote 
Peakes, go and pack up the Bludgers. Demelza, pull yourself together, you played really well today. Ron ...\rquote  he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it, \lquote you\rquote 
re my best mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this and I\rquote m going to kick you off the team.\rquote 
\par He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him, but then something much worse happened: Ron seemed to sag on his broom; all the fight went out of him and he said, \lquote I resign. I\rquote m pathetic.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re not pathetic and you\rquote re not resigning!\rquote  said Harry fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes. \lquote You can save anything when you\rquote re on form, it\rquote s a mental problem you\rquote ve got!\rquote 

\par \lquote You calling me mental?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, maybe I am!\rquote 
\par They glared at each other for a moment, then Ron shook his head wearily.
\par \lquote I know you haven\rquote t got any time to find another Keeper, so I\rquote ll play tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, I\rquote m taking myself off the team.\rquote 
\par Nothing Harry said made any difference. He tried boosting Ron\rquote s confidence all through dinner, but Ron was too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice. Harry per\-si
sted in the common room that evening, but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about Ron and casting 
h
im nasty looks. Finally, Harry tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking Ron into a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as 
ever.
\par Harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. He did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it his first as Captain, but he was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him. Ye
t if Ron played as he had done in the last few practices, their chances of winning were very slim ...
\par If only there was something he could do to make Ron pull himself together ... make him play at the top of his form ... something that would ensure that Ron had a really good day ...
\par And the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, glorious stroke of inspiration.
\par Breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; the Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall. Harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear, pale blue sky: a good omen.
\par The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as Harry and Ron approached. Harry grinned and waved; Ron grimaced weakly and shook his head.
\par \lquote Cheer up, Ron!\rquote  called Lavender. \lquote I know you\rquote ll be brilliant!\rquote 
\par Ron ignored her.
\par \lquote Tea?\rquote  Harry asked him. \lquote Coffee? Pumpkin juice?\rquote 
\par \lquote Anything,\rquote  said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of toast.
\par A few minutes later Hermione, who had become so tired of Ron\rquote s recent unpleasant behaviour that she had not come down to breakfast with them, paused on her way up the table.
\par \lquote How are you both feeling?\rquote  she asked tentatively, her eyes on the back of Ron\rquote s head.
\par \lquote Fine,\rquote  said Harry, who was concentrating on handing Ron a glass of pumpkin juice. \lquote There you go, Ron. Drink up.\rquote 
\par Ron had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione spoke sharply.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t drink that, Ron!\rquote 
\par Both Harry and Ron looked up at her.
\par \lquote Why not?\rquote  said Ron.
\par Hermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not believe her eyes.
\par \lquote You just put something in that drink.\rquote 
\par \lquote Excuse me?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote You heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something into Ron\rquote s drink. You\rquote ve got the bottle in your hand right now!\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know what you\rquote re talking about,\rquote  said Harry, stow\-ing the little bottle hastily in his pocket.
\par \lquote Ron, I warn you, don\rquote t drink it!\rquote  Hermione said again, alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained it in one and said, \lquote Stop bossing me around, Hermione.\rquote 
\par She looked scandalised. Bending low so that only Harry could hear her she hissed, \lquote You should be expelled for that. I\rquote d never have believed it of you, Harry!\rquote 
\par \lquote Hark who\rquote s talking,\rquote  he whispered back. \lquote Confunded any\-one lately?\rquote 
\par She stormed up the table away from them. Harry watched her go without regret. Hermione had never really understood what a serious business Quidditch was. He then looked round at Ron, who was smacking his lips.
\par \lquote Nearly time,\rquote  said Harry blithely.
\par The frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the stadium.
\par \lquote Pretty lucky the weather\rquote s this good, eh?\rquote  Harry asked Ron.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking.
\par Ginny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room.
\par \lquote Conditions look ideal,\rquote  said Ginny, ignoring Ron. \lquote And guess what? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey \endash  he took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice, and he\rquote s too sore to play! And even better than that 
\endash  Malfoy\rquote s gone off sick too!\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote What?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 said Harry, wheeling round to stare at her. \lquote He\rquote 
s ill? What\rquote s wrong with him?\rquote 
\par \lquote No idea, but it\rquote s great for us,\rquote  said Ginny brightly. \lquote They\rquote re playing Harper instead; he\rquote s in my year and he\rquote s an idiot.\rquote 
\par Harry smiled vaguely back, but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch. Malfoy had once before claimed he 
could not play due to injury, but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the Slytherins better. Why was he now happy to let a substitute go on? Was he really ill, or was he faking?
\par \lquote Fishy, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  he said in an undertone to Ron. \lquote Malfoy not playing?\rquote 
\par \lquote Lucky, I call it,\rquote  said Ron, looking slightly more animated. \lquote And Vaisey off too, he\rquote s their best goal-scorer, I didn\rquote t fancy \endash  hey!\rquote  he said suddenly, freezing halfway through pulling on his Keeper
\rquote s gloves and staring at Harry.
\par \lquote What?\rquote 
\par \lquote I ... you ...\rquote  Ron had dropped his voice; he looked both scared and excited. \lquote My drink ... my pumpkin juice ... you didn\rquote t ...?\rquote 
\par Harry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, \lquote We\rquote ll be starting in about five minutes, you\rquote d better get your boots on.\rquote 
\par They walked out on to the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos. One end of the stadium was solid red and gold; the other, a sea of green and silver. Many Hufflepuffs and Raven\-claws had taken sides, too: amidst all the yelling
 and clapping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegood\rquote s fam\-ous lion-topped hat.
\par Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who was standing ready to release the balls from the crate.
\par \lquote Captains, shake hands,\rquote  she said, and Harry had his hand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, Urquhart. \lquote Mount your brooms. On the whistle ... three ... two ... one ...\rquote 
\par The whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground, and they were away.
\par Harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds looking for the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper, who was zigzagging far below him. Then a voice that was jarringly different from the usual commentator\rquote s started up.
\par \lquote Well, there they go, and I think we\rquote re all surprised to see the team that Potter\rquote s put together this year. Many thought, given Ronald Weasley\rquote 
s patchy performance as Keeper last year, that he might be off the team, but of course, a close personal friendship with the Captain does help ...\rquote 
\par These words were greeted with jeers and applause from the Slytherin end of the pitch. Harry craned round on his broom to look towards the commentator\rquote 
s podium. A tall, skinny blond boy with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordan\rquote s; Harry recognised Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked.
\par \lquote Oh, and here comes Slytherin\rquote s first attempt on goal, it\rquote s Urquhart streaking down the pitch and \endash \rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s stomach turned over.
\par \lquote \endash  Weasley saves it, well, he\rquote s bound to get lucky some\-times, I suppose ...\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s right, Smith, he is,\rquote  muttered Harry, grinning to himself, as he dived amongst the Chasers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive Snitch.
\par With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero, Ron having made some truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his gloves, and Ginny having scored four of Gryffindor\rquote s six goals. This effect\-
ively stopped Zacharias wondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because Harry liked them, and he started on Peakes and Coote instead.
\par \lquote Of course, Coote isn\rquote t really the usual build for a Beater,\rquote  said Zacharias loftily, \lquote they\rquote ve generally got a bit more muscle \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hit a Bludger at him!\rquote  Harry called to Coote as he zoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim the next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just passing Harry in the opposite direction. Harry was pleased to hear the dull }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 thunk }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 that meant the Bludger had found its mark.
\par It seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong. Again and again they scored, and again and again, at the other end of the pitch, Ron saved goals with apparent ease. He was actually smiling now, and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a 
rousing chorus of the old favourite }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Weasley is our King, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
he pretended to conduct them from on high.
\par \lquote Thinks he\rquote s something special today, doesn\rquote t he?\rquote  said a snide voice, and Harry was nearly knocked off his broom as Harper collided with him hard and deliberately. \lquote Your blood-traitor pal ...\rquote 
\par Madam Hooch\rquote s back was turned, and though Gryffindors below shouted in anger, by the time she looked round Harper had already sped off. His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, determined to ram him back ...
\par \lquote And I think Harper of Slytherin\rquote s seen the Snitch!\rquote  said Zacharias Smith through his megaphone. \lquote Yes, he\rquote s certainly seen something Potter hasn\rquote t!\rquote 
\par Smith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadn\rquote t he noticed them collide? But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the sky \endash 
 Smith was right and Harry was wrong: Harper had not sped upwards at random; he had spotted what Harry had not: the Snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the clear blue sky.
\par Harry accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of Smith\rquote 
s commentary or the crowd, but Harper was still ahead of him, and Gryffindor was only a hundred points up; if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost ... and now Harper was feet from it, his hand outstretched ...
\par \lquote Oi, Harper!\rquote  yelled Harry in desperation. \lquote How much did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?\rquote 
\par He did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a double take; he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip through his fingers and shot right past it: Harry made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering ball and caught it.
\par \lquote YES!\rquote  Harry yelled: wheeling round, he hurtled back towards the ground, the Snitch held high in his hand. As the crowd realised what had happened, a great shout went up that 
almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signalled the end of the game.
\par \lquote Ginny, where\rquote re you going?\rquote  yelled Harry, who had found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the team, but Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, she collided with the commentator
\rquote s podium. As the crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring; Harry heard Ginny saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, \lquote 
Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.\rquote 
\par Laughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged Ginny, but let go very quickly. Avoiding her gaze, he clapped a cheering Ron on the back instead as, all enmity forgotten, the Gryffindor team left t
he pitch arm in arm, punching the air and waving to their supporters.
\par The atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant.
\par \lquote Party up in the common room, Seamus said!\rquote  yelled Dean exuberantly. \lquote C\rquote mon, Ginny, Demelza!\rquote 
\par Ron and Harry were the last two in the changing room. They were just about to leave when Hermione entered. She was twisting her Gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined.
\par \lquote I want a word with you, Harry.\rquote  She took a deep breath. \lquote You shouldn\rquote t have done it. You heard Slughorn, it\rquote s illegal.\rquote 
\par \lquote What are you going to do, turn us in?\rquote  demanded Ron.
\par \lquote What are you two talking about?\rquote  asked Harry, turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning.
\par \lquote You know perfectly well what we\rquote re talking about!\rquote  said Hermione shrilly. \lquote You spiked Ron\rquote s juice with lucky potion at breakfast! Felix Felicis!\rquote 
\par \lquote No I didn\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry, turning back to face them both.
\par \lquote Yes you did, Harry, and that\rquote s why everything went right, there were Slytherin players missing and Ron saved every\-thing!\rquote 
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t put it in!\rquote 
 said Harry, now grinning broadly. He slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his hand that morning. It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. \lquote 
I wanted Ron to think I\rquote d done it, so I faked it when I knew you were looking.\rquote  He looked at Ron. \lquote You saved everything because you felt lucky. You did it all yourself.\rquote 
\par He pocketed the potion again.
\par \lquote There really wasn\rquote t anything in my pumpkin juice?\rquote  Ron said, astounded. \lquote But the weather\rquote s good ... and Vaisey couldn\rquote t play ... I honestly haven\rquote t been given lucky potion?\rquote 
\par Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on Hermione, imitating her voice.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote You added Felix Felicis to Ron\rquote s juice this morning, that\rquote s why he saved everything! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder.
\par \lquote Er,\rquote  said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not expected his plan to backfire like this, \lquote shall ... shall we go up to the party, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote You go!\rquote  said Hermione, blinking back tears. \lquote I\rquote m }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 sick }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
of Ron at the moment, I don\rquote t know what I\rquote m supposed to have done ...\rquote 
\par And she stormed out of the changing room, too.
\par Harry walked slowly back up the grounds towards the castle through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratula\-tions at him, but he felt a great sense of let-down; he 
had been sure that if Ron won the match, he and Hermione would be friends again immediately. He did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermione that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum, not when the offence had occurred so long ago.

\par Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration party, which was in full swing when he arrived. Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him. What with trying to shake off t
h
e Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow match analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time before he could try and find Ron. At last, he extricated hims
elf from Romilda Vane, who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to Slug\-horn\rquote 
s Christmas party with him. As he was ducking towards the drinks table he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels.
\par \lquote Looking for Ron?\rquote  she asked, smirking. \lquote He\rquote s over there, the filthy hypocrite.\rquote 
\par Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.
\par \lquote It looks like he\rquote s eating her face, doesn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Ginny dispassionately. \lquote But I suppose he\rquote s got to refine his technique somehow. Good game, Harry.\rquote 
\par She patted him on the arm; Harry felt a swooping sensation in his stomach, but then she walked off to help herself to more Butterbeer. Crookshanks trotted after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold.
\par Harry turned away from Ron, who did not look like sur\-facing soon, just in time to see the portrait hole closing. With a sinking feeling he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight.
\par He darted forwards, sidestepped Romilda Vane again, and pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady. The corridor out\-side seemed to be deserted.
\par \lquote Hermione?\rquote 
\par He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was sitting on the teacher\rquote 
s desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this.
\par \lquote Oh, hello, Harry,\rquote  she said in a brittle voice. \lquote I was just practising.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... they\rquote re \endash  er \endash  really good ...\rquote  said Harry.
\par He had no idea what to say to her. He was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron, that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, \lquote 
Ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations.\rquote 
\par \lquote Er ... does he?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t pretend you didn\rquote t see him,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote He wasn\rquote t exactly hiding it, was \endash \rquote 
\par The door behind them burst open. To Harry\rquote s horror, Ron came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry and Hermione.
\par \lquote Oops!\rquote  said Lavender, and she backed out of the room, giggling. The door swung shut behind her.
\par There was a horrible swelling, billowing silence. Hermione was staring at Ron, who refused to look at her, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness, \lquote Hi, Harry! Wondered where you\rquote d got to!\rquote 
\par Hermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system.
\par \lquote You shouldn\rquote t leave Lavender waiting outside,\rquote  she said quietly. \lquote She\rquote ll wonder where you\rquote ve gone.\rquote 
\par She walked very slowly and erectly towards the door. Harry glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Oppugno!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 came a shriek from the doorway.
\par Harry spun round to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, 
her expression wild: the little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets towards Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach.
\par \lquote Gerremoffme!\rquote  he yelled, but with one last look of vindic\-tive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it. Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed.

Snow was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had already single-handedly delivered the usual twelve Christmas trees for the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of th
e
 stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armour and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went p
ast, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunately, however, Harry\rquote s fre\-quent night-time wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle\rquote 
s secret passageways, so that he was able, without too much difficulty, to navigate mistletoe-free routes between classes.

Ron, who might once have found the necessity of these detours a cause for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing, joking Ron to the moody, aggre
ssive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted; an
d secondly, Harry found himself, once more, the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again.
\par Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Hermione\rquote s bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful tone.
\par \lquote She can\rquote t complain,\rquote  he told Harry. \lquote She snogged Krum. So she\rquote s found out someone wants to snog me, too. Well, it\rquote s a free country. I haven\rquote t done anything wrong.\rquote

s voice tailed away in mutters, barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the words \lquote Krum\rquote  and \lquote can\rquote t complain\rquote  again.
\par Hermione\rquote s timetable was so full that Harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was in any case so tightly wrapped around Lav
ender that he did not notice what Harry was doing. Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, so Harry generally joined her in the library, which meant that their conversations were held in whispers.
\par \lquote He\rquote s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,\rquote  said Hermione, while the librarian, Madam Pince, prowled the shelves behind them. \lquote I really couldn\rquote t care less.\rquote 
\par She raised her quill and dotted an \lquote i\rquote  so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry said nothing. He thought his voice might soon vanish from lack of use. He bent a little lower over }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\rquote s useful additions to Libatius Borage\rquote s text.
\par \lquote And incidentally,\rquote  said Hermione, after a few moments, \lquote you need to be careful.\rquote 
\par \lquote For the last time,\rquote  said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse whisper after three-quarters of an hour of silence, \lquote I am not giving back this book, I\rquote ve learned more from the Half-Blood P

\par \lquote I\rquote m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,\rquote  said Hermione, giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her, \lquote I\rquote m talking about earlier. I went into the girls\rquote  bathroom just before I

\par \lquote There isn\rquote t anyone I want to invite,\rquote  mumbled Harry, who was still trying not to think about Ginny
 any more than he could help, despite the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency.
\par \lquote Well, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Vane looked like she meant business,\rquote  said Hermione grimly.
\par She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her Arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill. Harry watched her with his mind a long way away.
\par \lquote Hang on a moment,\rquote  he said slowly. \lquote I thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasleys\rquote  Wizard Wheezes?\rquote 
\par \lquote And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned?\rquote  asked Hermione, still concentrating on her essay.
\par \lquote But I thought all the owls were being searched? So how come these girls are able to bring love potions into school?\rquote 
\par \lquote Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote It\rquote s part of their Owl Order Service.\rquote

\par \lquote It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer,\rquote  she said coldly. \lquote I don\rquote t go around putting potions in people\rquote s drinks ... or pretending to, either, which is just as bad \'85\rquote 

\par \lquote Yeah, well, never mind that,\rquote  said Harry quickly. \lquote The point is, Filch is being fooled, isn\rquote t he? These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else! So why couldn\rquote

\par \lquote Oh, Harry ... not that again ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Come on, why not?\rquote  demanded Harry.
\par \lquote Look,\rquote  sighed Hermione, \lquote Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses and concealment charms, don\rquote t they? They\rquote re used to find Dark magic and Dark objects. They\rquote 
d have picked up a powerful curse, like the one on that necklace, within seconds. But something that\rquote s just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn\rquote t register \endash  and anyway, love potions aren\rquote t Dark or dangerous \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote Easy for you to say,\rquote  muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda Vane.

\par Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had moved cl
ose behind them among the dark bookshelves. They waited and a moment later the vulture-like countenance of Madam Pince appeared round the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like parchment and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp sh
e was carrying.
\par \lquote The library is now closed,\rquote  she said. \lquote Mind you return any\-thing you have borrowed to the correct \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699

\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand.
\par \lquote Despoiled!\rquote  she hissed. \lquote Desecrated! Befouled!\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s just a book that\rquote s been written in!\rquote  said Harry, tugging it out of her grip.
\par She looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who had hastily packed her things, grabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him away.
\par \lquote She\rquote ll ban you from the library if you\rquote re not careful. Why did you have to bring that stupid book?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s not my fault she\rquote s barking mad, Hermione. Or d\rquote you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? I\rquote ve always thought there might be something going on between them ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, ha, ha ...\rquote 
\par Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted, lamp-lit corridors back to the common room, arguing about whether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other.
\par \lquote Baubles,\rquote  said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the new, festive password.
\par \lquote Same to you,\rquote  said the Fat Lady with a roguish grin, and she swung forwards to admit them.
\par \lquote Hi, Harry!\rquote  said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole. \lquote Fancy a Gillywater?\rquote 
\par Hermione gave him a \lquote What-did-I-tell-you?\rquote  look over her shoulder.
\par \lquote No thanks,\rquote  said Harry quickly. \lquote I don\rquote t like it much.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, take these anyway,\rquote  said Romilda, thrusting a box into his hands. \lquote Chocolate Cauldrons, they\rquote ve got Firewhisky in them. My gran sent them to me, but I don\rquote t like them.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh \endash  right \endash  thanks a lot,\rquote  said Harry, who could not think what else to say. \lquote Er \endash  I\rquote m just going over here with ...\rquote 
\par He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly.
\par \lquote Told you,\rquote  said Hermione succinctly. \lquote Sooner you ask someone, sooner they\rquote ll all leave you alone and you can \endash \rquote 
\par But her face suddenly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron and Lavender who were entwined in the same armchair.
\par \lquote Well, goodnight, Harry,\rquote  said Hermione, though it was only seven o\rquote clock in the evening, and she left for the girls\rquote  dormi\-tory without another word.
\par Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn\rquote 
s party, after which he and Ron would depart together for The Burrow. It now seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began
, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of their behaviour ...
\par But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had just embarked upon the
 immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration; working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be changing the colour of their own eye\-brows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron\rquote 
s disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give him\-
self a spectacular handlebar moustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced
 Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron\rquote s just then, scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her.
\par He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girls\rquote  bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back.
\par \lquote Oh, hello, Harry,\rquote  said Luna. \lquote Did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hi, Luna. Hermione, you left your stuff ...\rquote 
\par He held out her books.
\par \lquote Oh, yes,\rquote  said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact that she was wiping her eyes on her pencil case. \lquote Thank you, Harry. Well, I\rquote d better get going ...\rquote 
\par And she hurried off, without giving Harry any time to offer words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any.
\par \lquote She\rquote s a bit upset,\rquote  said Luna. \lquote I thought at first it was Moan\-ing Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something about that Ron Weasley ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, they\rquote ve had a row,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote He says very funny things sometimes, doesn\rquote t he?\rquote  said Luna, as they set off down the corridor together. \lquote But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.\rquote 
\par \lquote I s\rquote pose,\rquote  said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her. \lquote So have you had a good term?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, it\rquote s been all right,\rquote  said Luna. \lquote A bit lonely without the DA. Ginny\rquote s been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me \'93Loony\'94 the other day \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote How would you like to come to Slughorn\rquote s party with me tonight?\rquote 
\par The words were out of Harry\rquote s mouth before he could stop them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking.
\par Luna turned her protuberant eyes upon him in surprise.
\par \lquote Slughorn\rquote s party? With you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote We\rquote re supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like ... I mean ...\rquote  He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear. \lquote I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you don\rquote 
t want to ...\rquote 
\par He was already half-hoping that she didn\rquote t want to.
\par \lquote Oh, no, I\rquote d love to go with you as friends!\rquote  said Luna, beaming as he had never seen her beam before. \lquote Nobody\rquote s ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is t
hat why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I do mine, too?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry firmly, \lquote that was a mistake, I\rquote ll get Hermione to put it right for me. So, I\rquote ll meet you in the Entrance Hall at eight o\rquote clock, then.\rquote 
\par \lquote AHA!\rquote  screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed right underneath Peeves, who was hanging upside-down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Potty asked Loony to go to the party! Potty lurves Loony! Potty luuuuurves Looooooony!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par And he zoomed away, cackling and shrieking, \lquote Potty loves Loony!\rquote 
\par \lquote Nice to keep these things private,\rquote  said Harry. And sure enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn\rquote s party.
\par \lquote You could\rquote ve taken }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 anyone!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699

\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t call her that, Ron,\rquote  snapped Ginny, pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends. \lquote I\rquote m really glad you\rquote re taking her, Harry, she\rquote s so excited.\rquote 
\par And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party, but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table, Hermione was sitting alone, pl
aying with her stew. Harry noticed Ron looking at her furtively.
\par \lquote You could say sorry,\rquote  suggested Harry bluntly.
\par \lquote What, and get attacked by another flock of canaries?\rquote  muttered Ron.
\par \lquote What did you have to imitate her for?\rquote 
\par \lquote She laughed at my moustache!\rquote 
\par \lquote So did I, it was the stupidest thing I\rquote ve ever seen.\rquote 
\par But Ron did not seem to have heard; Lavender had just arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ron\rquote s neck.
\par \lquote Hi, Harry,\rquote  said Parvati who, like him, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behaviour of their two friends.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote How\rquote re you? You\rquote re staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave.\rquote 
\par \lquote I managed to talk them out of it for the time being,\rquote  said Parvati. \lquote That Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn\rquote t been anything since ... oh, hi, Hermione!\rquote 
\par Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Trans\-figuration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes.
\par \lquote Hi, Parvati!\rquote  said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. \lquote Are you going to Slughorn\rquote s party tonight?\rquote 
\par \lquote No invite,\rquote  said Parvati gloomily. \lquote I\rquote d love to go, though, it sounds like it\rquote s going to be really good ... you\rquote re going, aren\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I\rquote m meeting Cormac at eight and we\rquote re \endash \rquote 
\par There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything.
\par \lquote \endash  we\rquote re going up to the party together.\rquote 
\par \lquote Cormac?\rquote  said Parvati. \lquote Cormac McLaggen, you mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Hermione sweetly. \lquote The one who }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 almost,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 she put a great deal of emphasis on the word, \lquote became Gryffindor Keeper.\rquote 
\par \lquote Are you going out with him, then?\rquote  asked Parvati, wide-eyed.
\par \lquote Oh \endash  yes \endash  didn\rquote t you know?\rquote  said Hermione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Parvati, looking positively agog at this piece of gossip. \lquote Wow, you like your Quidditch players, don\rquote t you? First Krum, then McLaggen ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I like }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 really good }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Quidditch players,\rquote 
 Hermione corrected her, still smiling. \lquote Well, see you ... got to go and get ready for the party ...\rquote 
\par She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left 
to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.
\par When he arrived in the Entrance Hall at eight o\rquote clock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he 
approached Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that was attracting a certain amount of giggling from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish earrings, her Butterbee
r-cork necklace and her Spectrespecs.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  he said. \lquote Shall we get going, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yes,\rquote  she said happily. \lquote Where is the party?\rquote 
\par \lquote Slughorn\rquote s office,\rquote  said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. \lquote Did you hear, there\rquote s supposed to be a vampire coming?\rquote 
\par \lquote Rufus Scrimgeour?\rquote  asked Luna.
\par \lquote I \endash  what?\rquote  said Harry, disconcerted. \lquote You mean the Minister for Magic?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, he\rquote s a vampire,\rquote  said Luna matter-of-factly. \lquote Father wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour
 first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry. Obviously, they didn\rquote t want the truth to get out!\rquote 
\par Harry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna repeating her father\rquote s bizarre views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already approaching Slughorn\rquote 
s office and the sounds of laughter, music and loud conversation were grow\-ing louder with every step they took.
\par Whether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughorn\rquote s office was much larger than the usual teacher\rquote 
s study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a
 vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the centre of the ceil\-
ing in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded 
like mandolins issued from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a number of house-elves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy silver platters 
of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables.
\par \lquote Harry, m\rquote boy!\rquote  boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door. \lquote Come in, come in, so many people I\rquote d like you to meet!\rquote 
\par Slughorn was wearing a tasselled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket. Gripping Harry\rquote s arm so tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry seized Luna\rquote 
s hand and dragged her along with him.
\par \lquote Harry, I\rquote d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old stu\-dent of mine, author of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 and, of course, his friend Sanguini.\rquote 
\par Worple, who was a small, bespectacled man, grabbed Harry\rquote s hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini
, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking curious and excited.
\par \lquote Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!\rquote  said Worple, peering short-sightedly up into Harry\rquote s face. \lquote I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Just as modest as Horace described!\rquote  said Worple. \lquote But seriously \endash \rquote  his manner changed; it became suddenly business\-like, \lquote I would be delighted to write it myself \endash

Here, have a pasty,\rquote  said Worple, seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguini\rquote s hand before turning his attention back to Harry.
\par \lquote My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m definitely not interested,\rquote  said Harry firmly, \lquote and I\rquote ve just seen a friend of mine, sorry.\rquote 
\par He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters.
\par \lquote Hermione! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Hermione!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote Harry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna!\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s happened to you?\rquote  asked Harry, for Hermione looked distinctly dishevelled, rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devil\rquote s Snare.
\par \lquote Oh, I\rquote ve just escaped \endash  I mean, I\rquote ve just left Cormac,\rquote  she said. \lquote Under the mistletoe,\rquote  she added in explanation, as Harry continued to look questioningly at her.
\par \lquote Serves you right for coming with him,\rquote  he told her severely.

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote You considered Smith?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 said Harry, revolted.
\par \lquote Yes, I did, and I\rquote m starting to wish I\rquote d chosen him, McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman. Let\rquote s go this way, we\rquote ll be able to see him coming, he\rquote s so tall ...\rquote 
\par The three of them made their way over to the other side of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realising too late that Professor Trelawney was standing there alone.
\par \lquote Hello,\rquote  said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney.
\par \lquote Good evening, my dear,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, focusing upon Luna with some difficulty. Harry could smell cooking sherry again. \lquote I haven\rquote t seen you in my classes lately ...\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I\rquote ve got Firenze this year,\rquote  said Luna.
\par \lquote Oh, of course,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney with an angry, drunken titter. \lquote 
Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no ... we share classes ... it\rquote 
s an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you know ...\rquote 
\par Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognised Harry. Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to Hermione and said, \lquote Let\rquote s get something straight. Are you p
lanning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?\rquote 
\par Hermione raised her eyebrows.
\par \lquote Do you really think I\rquote d stoop that low?\rquote 
\par Harry looked at her shrewdly.
\par \lquote Hermione, if you can ask out McLaggen \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote There\rquote s a difference,\rquote  said Hermione with dignity. \lquote I\rquote ve got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good,\rquote  said Harry fervently. \lquote Because he\rquote ll just fall apart again and we\rquote ll lose the next match \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Quidditch!\rquote  said Hermione angrily. \lquote Is that all boys care about? Cormac hasn\rquote t asked me one single question about myself, no, I\rquote ve just been treated to A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen non-stop, ever since 
\endash  oh no, here he comes!\rquote 
\par She moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated; one moment she was there, the next she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished.
\par \lquote Seen Hermione?\rquote  asked McLaggen, forcing his way through the throng a minute later.
\par \lquote No, sorry,\rquote  said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Luna\rquote s conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking.
\par \lquote Harry Potter!\rquote  said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time.
\par \lquote Oh, hello,\rquote  said Harry unenthusiastically.
\par \lquote My dear boy!\rquote  she said in a very carrying whisper. \lquote The rumours! The stories! The Chosen One! Of course, I have known for a very long time ... the omens were never good, Harry ... but why have you not returned to Divina\-
tion? For you, of all people, the subject is of the utmost importance!\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, Sybill, we all think our subject\rquote s most important!\rquote  said a loud voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawney\rquote 
s other side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. \lquote But I don\rquote t think I\rquote ve ever known such a natural at Potions!\rquote 
 said Slughorn, regarding Harry with a fond, if blood\-shot, eye. \lquote Instinctive, you know \endash  like his mother! I\rquote ve only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybill \endash  why, even Severus \endash \rquote 

\par And to Harry\rquote s horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air towards them.
\par \lquote Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!\rquote  hiccoughed Slughorn happily. \lquote I was just talking about Harry\rquote s exceptional potion-making! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!\rquote 
\par Trapped, with Slughorn\rquote s arm around his shoulders, Snape looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his black eyes narrowed.
\par \lquote Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, then, it\rquote s natural ability!\rquote  shouted Slughorn. \lquote You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, the Draught of Living Death \endash  never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don\rquote 
t think even you, Severus \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Really?\rquote  said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he wanted was for Snape to start investigating the source of his new-found brilliance at Potions.
\par \lquote Remind me what other subjects you\rquote re taking, Harry?\rquote  asked Slughorn.
\par \lquote Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration, Herbology ...\rquote 
\par \lquote All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror,\rquote  said Snape, with the faintest sneer.
\par \lquote Yeah, well, that\rquote s what I\rquote d like to be,\rquote  said Harry defiantly.
\par \lquote And a great one you\rquote ll make, too!\rquote  boomed Slughorn.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think you should be an Auror, Harry,\rquote  said Luna unexpectedly. Everybody looked at her. \lquote The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They\rquote 
re working from within to bring down the Ministry of Magic using a combination of Dark magic and gum disease.\rquote 
\par Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh. Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this. Emerging from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw someth
ing calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malfoy being dragged by the ear towards them by Argus Filch.
\par \lquote Professor Slughorn,\rquote  wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischief-detection in his bulging eyes, \lquote I discovered this 
boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. Did you issue him with an invitation?\rquote 
\par Malfoy pulled himself free of Filch\rquote s grip, looking furious.
\par \lquote All right, I wasn\rquote t invited!\rquote  he said angrily. \lquote I was trying to gatecrash, happy?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I\rquote m not!\rquote  said Filch, a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face. \lquote You\rquote re in trouble, you are! Didn\rquote t the Headmaster say that night-time prowling\rquote s out, unless you\rquote 
ve got permission, didn\rquote t he, eh?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s all right, Argus, that\rquote s all right,\rquote  said Slughorn, waving a hand. \lquote It\rquote s Christmas, and it\rquote s not a crime to want to come to a party. Just this once, we\rquote 
ll forget any punishment; you may stay, Draco.\rquote 
\par Filch\rquote s expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly predictable; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Malfoy as though both angry and ... was it pos\-
sible? ... a little afraid?
\par But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Malfoy had composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, and Snape\rquote 
s face was smoothly inscrutable again.
\par \lquote It\rquote s nothing, nothing,\rquote  said Slughorn, waving away Malfoy\rquote s thanks. \lquote I did know your grandfather, after all ...\rquote 
\par \lquote He always spoke very highly of you, sir,\rquote  said Malfoy quickly. \lquote Said you were the best potion-maker he\rquote d ever known ...\rquote 
\par Harry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking up that 
intrigued him; he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time. It was the fact that Malfoy did, after all, look a little ill. This was the first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and 
a distinctly greyish tinge to his skin.
\par \lquote I\rquote d like a word with you, Draco,\rquote  said Snape suddenly.
\par \lquote Oh, now, Severus,\rquote  said Slughorn, hiccoughing again, \lquote it\rquote s Christmas, don\rquote t be too hard \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or otherwise, to be,\rquote  said Snape curtly. \lquote Follow me, Draco.\rquote 
\par They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful. Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, \lquote I\rquote ll be back in a bit, Luna \endash  er \endash  bathroom.\rquote 
\par \lquote All right,\rquote  she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely interested.
\par It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was more difficult was find\-
ing Snape and Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn\rquote s office behind him. Perhaps Snape had take
n Malfoy to his office in the dungeons ... or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slytherin common room ... but Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement, he crouched down to t
he keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices.
\par \lquote ... cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t have anything to do with it, all right?\rquote 
\par \lquote I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy and foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Who suspects me?\rquote  said Malfoy angrily. \lquote For the last time, I didn\rquote t do it, OK? That Bell girl must\rquote ve had an enemy no one knows about \endash  don\rquote t look at me like that! I know what you\rquote re doing, I
\rquote m not stupid, but it won\rquote t work \endash  I can stop you!\rquote 
\par There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, \lquote Ah ... Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not trying to conceal anything from }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 him, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 I just don\rquote

\par Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the key\-hole ... what had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this, Snape, towards whom he had always shown respect, even liking?
\par \lquote So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have feared my interference? You realise that, had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeat\-edly to be there, Draco \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!\rquote  jeered Malfoy.
\par There was another pause. Then Snape said, \lquote You know per\-fectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote d better stop telling me to come to your office, then!\rquote 
\par \lquote Listen to me,\rquote  said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. \lquote I am trying to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow, Draco \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote Looks like you\rquote ll have to break it, then, because I don\rquote t need your protection! It\rquote s my job, he gave it to me and I\rquote m doing it. I\rquote ve got a plan and it\rquote s going to work, it\rquote 
s just taking a bit longer than I thought it would!\rquote 
\par \lquote What is your plan?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s none of your business!\rquote 
\par \lquote If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve got all the assistance I need, thanks, I\rquote m not alone!\rquote 
\par \lquote You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the extreme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or back\-up. These are elementary mistakes \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I would\rquote ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn\rquote t put them in detention!\rquote 
\par \lquote Keep your voice down!\rquote  spat Snape, for Malfoy\rquote s voice had risen excitedly. \lquote 
If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. this time around, they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres\emdash \rquote 
\par \lquote What does it matter?\rquote  said Malfoy. \lquote Defence Against the Dark Arts \endash  it\rquote s all just a joke, isn\rquote t it, an act? Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!\rquote  said Snape. \lquote W
here do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance on assistants like Crabbe and Goyle 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote re not the only ones, I\rquote ve got other people on my side, better people!\rquote 
\par \lquote Then why not confide in me, and I can \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I know what you\rquote re up to! You want to steal my glory!\rquote 
\par There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, \lquote You are speaking like a child. I quite understand that your father\rquote s capture and imprisonment has upset you, but \endash \rquote 
\par Harry had barely a second\rquote s warning; he heard Malfoy\rquote s footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open; Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the open door of Slughorn\rquote 
s office, round the distant corner and out of sight.
\par Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfathomable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hidden beneath the Cloak, his mind racing.

\par \lquote I\rquote d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote You die,\rquote  said Ron simply. \lquote Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly did, too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went mental,\rquote 
 said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. \lquote Only time I\rquote ve ever seen Dad as angry as Mum. Fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, well, passing over Fred\rquote s left buttock \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I beg your pardon?\rquote  said Fred\rquote s voice as the twins entered the kitchen.
\par \lquote Aaah, George, look at this. They\rquote re using knives and every\-thing. Bless them.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll be seventeen in two and a bit months\rquote  time,\rquote  said Ron grumpily, \lquote and then I\rquote ll be able to do it by magic!\rquote

\par \lquote I\rquote m sure you\rquote ll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,\rquote  yawned Fred.
\par \lquote And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald,\rquote  said George, \lquote what is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called \endash  unless our information is faulty \endash  Lavender Brown?\rquote 
\par Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts.
\par \lquote Mind your own business.\rquote

\par \lquote Did she have an accident or something?\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Careful, now!\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprouts knife at Fred, who turned it into a paper aeroplane with one lazy flick of his wand.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Ron!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 she said furiously. \lquote Don\rquote

\par \lquote I won\rquote t,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote let you see,\rquote  he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain.
\par \lquote Fred, George, I\rquote m sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two!\rquote 
\par \lquote No problem,\rquote  said George.
\par \lquote Then, as Charlie isn\rquote t coming home, that just leaves Harry and Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with Ginny \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  that\rquote ll make Ginny\rquote s Christmas \endash \rquote  muttered Fred.

\par \lquote No, he\rquote s busy, I expect, at the Ministry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Or he\rquote s the world\rquote s biggest prat,\rquote  said Fred, as Mrs Weasley left the kitchen. \lquote One of the two. Well, let\rquote s get going, then, George.\rquote

\par \lquote \endash  and if you want people to help you, Ron,\rquote  added George, throwing the paper aeroplane at him, \lquote I wouldn\rquote t chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. We\rquote re off to the village, there\rquote

\par \lquote Gits,\rquote  said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard. \lquote Would\rquote ve only taken them ten seconds and then we could\rquote ve gone, too.\rquote 
\par \lquote I couldn\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I promised Dumbledore I wouldn\rquote t wander off while I\rquote m staying here.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yeah,\rquote  said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, \lquote Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yep,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I\rquote m going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it and Dumbledore\rquote s top of the list. I might have another word with your dad, too.\rquote 
\par \lquote Pity you didn\rquote t hear what Malfoy\rquote s actually doing, though.\rquote 
\par \lquote I couldn\rquote t have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape.\rquote 
\par There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, \lquote Course, you know what they\rquote ll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? They\rquote ll say Snape isn\rquote t really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to find out what Malfoy
\rquote s up to.\rquote 
\par \lquote They didn\rquote t hear him,\rquote  said Harry flatly. \lquote No one\rquote s that good an actor, not even Snape.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... I\rquote m just saying, though,\rquote  said Ron.
\par Harry turned to face him, frowning.
\par \lquote You think I\rquote m right, though?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I do!\rquote  said Ron hastily. \lquote Seriously, I do! But they\rquote re all convinced Snape\rquote s in the Order, aren\rquote t they?\rquote 
\par Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now:
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he\rquote s doing ...\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn\rquote 
s party before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for The B
urrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a Happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been sa
ying a thoroughly non-verbal goodbye just behind him at the time.
\par Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Malfoy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying \lquote I told you so\rquote , which he had done several times to Ron already.
\par Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny had decorated so lavis
hly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for Christmas d
inner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to its back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet.
\par They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broad\-cast by Mrs Weasley\rquote 
s favourite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless. Fleur, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs Weasley kept point\-
ing her wand at the volume control, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a particularly jazzy number called \lquote A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love\rquote , Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny. Ron kept s
hooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestina\rquote s voice.

\par \lquote I won\rquote t say anything,\rquote  said Harry. He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he marshalled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called \lquote You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me
\rquote .
\par \lquote Mr Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?\rquote

\par \lquote The news would have leaked out anyway. We both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the Potion. He kept me healthy. I must be grateful.\rquote

\par \lquote You are determined to hate him, Harry,\rquote  said Lupin with a faint smile. \lquote 
And I understand; with James as your father, with Sirius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do not expect him to share your view of the matter;

\par \lquote What have you been up to lately?\rquote  Harry asked Lupin, as Mr Weasley bustled off to fetch the egg-nog and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation.
\par \lquote Oh, I\rquote ve been underground,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote Almost literally. That\rquote s why I haven\rquote t been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a give-away.\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve been living among my fellows, my equals,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote Werewolves,\rquote  he added, at Harry\rquote s look of incomprehension. \lquote Nearly all of them are on Voldemort\rquote 
s side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was ... ready-made.\rquote 
\par He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realised it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, \lquote I am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? How\-
ever, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakeable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing \endash  and sometimes killing \endash  to eat.
\rquote 
\par \lquote How come they like Voldemort?\rquote 
\par \lquote They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Who\rquote s Greyback?\rquote 
\par \lquote You haven\rquote t heard of him?\rquote  Lupin\rquote s hands closed con\-vulsively in his lap. \lquote 
Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards
. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specialises in children ... bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people
\rquote s sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results.\rquote 
\par Lupin paused and then said, \lquote It was Greyback who bit me.\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry, astonished. \lquote When \endash  when you were a kid, you mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a 
very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, knowing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full moon he positions himself close to vic\-
tims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the were\-wolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback\rquote s insist\-
ence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.\rquote 
\par \lquote But you are normal!\rquote  said Harry fiercely. \lquote You\rquote ve just got a \endash  a problem \endash \rquote 
\par Lupin burst out laughing.
\par \lquote Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my \'93furry little problem\'94 in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.\rquote 
\par He accepted a glass of egg-nog from Mr Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, mean\-while, felt a rush of excitement: this last ment
ion of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
\par \lquote Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Half-Blood what?\rquote 
\par \lquote Prince,\rquote  said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
\par \lquote There are no wizarding princes,\rquote  said Lupin, now smiling. \lquote Is this a title you\rquote re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being the \'93Chosen One\'94 would be enough.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s nothing to do with me!\rquote  said Harry indignantly. \lquote The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I\rquote ve got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Levicorpus \endash \rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,\rquote  said Lupin reminiscently. \lquote There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn\rquote t move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.\rquote 
\par \lquote My dad used it,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.\rquote 
\par He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupin\rquote s smile was a little too understanding.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  he said, \lquote but he wasn\rquote t the only one. As I say, it was very popular ... you know how these spells come and go ...\rquote 
\par \lquote But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,\rquote  Harry persisted.
\par \lquote Not necessarily,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.\rquote  He looked into Harry\rquote s face and then said quietly, \lquote James was a pure-blood, Harry, and I promise 
you, he never asked us to call him \'93Prince\'94.\rquote 
\par Abandoning pretence, Harry said, \lquote And it wasn\rquote t Sirius? Or you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Definitely not.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh.\rquote  Harry stared into the fire. \lquote I just thought \endash  well, he\rquote s helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.\rquote 
\par \lquote How old is this book, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno, I\rquote ve never checked.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing \lquote A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love\rquote , which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs Weasley\rquote 
s expression, to be the cue to go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron\rquote s attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry.
\par Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Advanced Potion-Making }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 before getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been published. It was nearly fifty years old. Neithe
r his father, nor his father\rquote 
s friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and the Half-Blood Prince, an
d finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children ...
\par \lquote She\rquote s got to be joking ...\rquote 
\par Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the
 tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and in front of it Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain.
\par \lquote What\rquote s that?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote It\rquote s from Lavender,\rquote  said Ron, sounding revolted. \lquote She can\rquote t honestly think I\rquote d wear ...\rquote 
\par Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter. Dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words \lquote My Sweetheart\rquote .
\par \lquote Nice,\rquote  he said. \lquote Classy. You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George.\rquote 
\par \lquote If you tell them,\rquote  said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, \lquote I \endash  I \endash  I\rquote ll \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Stutter at me?\rquote  said Harry, grinning. \lquote Come on, would I?\rquote 
\par \lquote How could she think I\rquote d like something like that, though?\rquote  Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked.
\par \lquote Well, think back,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Have you ever let it slip that you\rquote d like to go out in public with the words \'93My Sweetheart\'94 round your neck?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well ... we don\rquote t really talk much,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote It\rquote s mainly ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Snogging,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well, yeah,\rquote  said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, \lquote Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote They were at Slughorn\rquote s party together, but I don\rquote t think it went that well.\rquote 
\par Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking.
\par Harry\rquote s presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked on to the front, hand-knitted by Mrs Weasley, a large box of Weasleys\rquote 
 Wizard Wheezes products from the twins and a slightly damp, mouldy-smelling package which came with a label reading: \lquote To Master, from Kreacher\rquote .
\par Harry stared at it. \lquote D\rquote you reckon this is safe to open?\rquote  he asked.
\par \lquote Can\rquote t be anything dangerous, all our mail\rquote s still being searched at the Ministry,\rquote  replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously.
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t think of giving Kreacher anything! Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?\rquote  asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously.
\par \lquote Hermione would,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote But let\rquote s wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.\rquote 
\par A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots.
\par \lquote Nice,\rquote  said Ron, roaring with laughter. \lquote Very thoughtful.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote d rather have them than that necklace,\rquote  said Harry, which sobered Ron up at once.
\par Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs Weasley herself, who was sporting a brand new midnight-blue witch\rquote 
s hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spectacular golden necklace.
\par \lquote Fred and George gave them to me! Aren\rquote t they beautiful?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now we\rquote re washing our own socks,\rquote  said George, waving an airy hand. \lquote Parsnips, Remus?\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, you\rquote ve got a maggot in your hair,\rquote  said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goosebumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.
\par \lquote \rquote Ow \rquote orrible,\rquote  said Fleur, with an affected little shudder.
\par \lquote Yes, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Gravy, Fleur?\rquote 
\par In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat.
\par \lquote You are as bad as zat Tonks,\rquote  said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. \lquote She is always knocking \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I invited }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 dear }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Tonks to come along today,\rquote 
 said Mrs Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur. \lquote But she wouldn\rquote t come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I haven\rquote t been in contact with anybody very much,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote But Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn\rquote t she?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hmmm,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. \lquote Maybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.\rquote 
\par She ga
ve Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs Weasley was fighting a l
ong-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses?
\par \lquote Tonks\rquote s Patronus has changed its form,\rquote  he told him. \lquote Snape said so, anyway. I didn\rquote t know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?\rquote 
\par Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, \lquote Sometimes ... a great shock ... an emotional upheaval ...\rquote 
\par \lquote It looked big, and it had four legs,\rquote  said Harry, struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice. \lquote Hey ... it couldn\rquote t be \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Arthur!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. \lquote Arthur \endash  it\rquote s Percy!\rquote

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
Mr Weasley looked round. Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ginny stood up for a better view. There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone.
\par \lquote Arthur, he\rquote s \endash  he\rquote s with the Minister!\rquote 
\par And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
was following along in Percy\rquote s wake, limping slightly, his mane of greying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow Before any of them could say anything, befor
e Mr and Mrs Weasley could do more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and there stood Percy.
\par There was a moment\rquote s painful silence. Then Percy said rather stiffly, \lquote Merry Christmas, Mother.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Percy!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 said Mrs Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms.

\par Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene.
\par \lquote You must forgive this intrusion,\rquote  he said, when Mrs Weasley looked round at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. \lquote Percy and I were in the vicinity \endash  working, you know \endash  and he couldn\rquote 
t resist dropping in and seeing you all.\rquote 
\par But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else\rquote s heads. Mr Weasley, Fred and George were all observing him, stony-faced.
\par \lquote Please, come in, sit down, Minister!\rquote  fluttered Mrs Weasley, straightening her hat. \lquote Have a little purkey, or some tooding ... I mean \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, no, my dear Molly,\rquote  said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that he had checked on her name with Percy before they entered the house. \lquote I don\rquote t want to intrude, wouldn\rquote t be here at all if Percy hadn\rquote 
t wanted to see you all so badly ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, Perce!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him.
\par \lquote ... we\rquote ve only looked in for five minutes, so I\rquote ll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy. No, no, I assure you I don\rquote 
t want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming garden ... ah, that young man\rquote s finished, why doesn\rquote t he take a stroll with me?\rquote 
\par The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to Harry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour\rquote s pretence that he did not know Harry\rquote s name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chos
en to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur and George also had clean plates.
\par \lquote Yeah, all right,\rquote  said Harry into the silence.
\par He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour\rquote s talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone.
\par \lquote It\rquote s fine,\rquote  he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half-risen from his chair. \lquote Fine,\rquote  he added, as Mr Weasley opened his mouth to speak.
\par \lquote Wonderful!\rquote  said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass through the door ahead of him. \lquote We\rquote ll just take a turn around the garden and then Percy and I\rquote ll be off. Carry on, everyone!\rquote 
\par Harry walked across the yard towards the Weasleys\rquote  over\-grown, snow-co
vered garden, Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror Office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat.
\par \lquote Charming,\rquote  said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguish\-able plants. \lquote Charming.\rquote 
\par Harry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve wanted to meet you for a very long time,\rquote  said Scrimgeour, after a few moments. \lquote Did you know that?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry truthfully.
\par \lquote Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very protective of you,\rquote  said Scrimgeour. \lquote Natural, of course, natural, after what you\rquote ve been through ... especially what happened at the Ministry ...\rquote 
\par He waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige, so he went on, \lquote I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has \endash  most understandably, as I say \endash  prevented this.\rquote 

\par Still Harry said nothing, waiting.
\par \lquote The rumours that have flown around!\rquote  said Scrimgeour. \lquote Well, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted ... all these whispers of a prophecy ... of you being the \'93Chosen One\'94 ...\rquote 
\par They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrimgeour was here.
\par \lquote ... I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you?\rquote 
\par Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flower\-
beds, and the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. Finally, he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it.
\par \lquote Yeah, we\rquote ve discussed it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Have you, have you ...\rquote  said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out of the corner of his eyes, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. 
\lquote And what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Sorry, but that\rquote s between us,\rquote  said Harry.
\par He kept his voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour\rquote s tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, \lquote Oh, of course, if it\rquote s a question of confidences, I wouldn\rquote t want you to divulge ... no, no ... and in any case, does
 it really matter whether you are the Chosen One or not?\rquote 
\par Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t really know what you mean, Minister.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, of course, to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 it will matter enormously,\rquote 
 said Scrimgeour with a laugh. \lquote But to the wizarding community at large ... it\rquote s all perception, isn\rquote t it? It\rquote s what people believe that\rquote s important.\rquote 
\par Harry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it.
\par \lquote People believe you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 the Chosen One, you see,\rquote  said Scrimgeour. 
\lquote They think you quite the hero \endash  which, of course, you are, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced He Who Must Not Be Named now? Well, anyway,\rquote  he pressed on, without waiting for a reply, \lquote 
the point is, you are a symbol of hope for many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, who might even be }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 destined, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 to destroy He Who Must Not Be Named \endash  well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I can\rquote 
t help but feel that, once you realise this, you might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost.\rquote 
\par The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, look\-ing from Harry to the gnome, \lquote Funny little chaps, aren\rquote 
t they? But what say you, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t exactly understand what you want,\rquote  said Harry slowly. \lquote \'93Stand alongside the Ministry\'94 ... what does that mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,\rquote  said Scrimgeour. \lquote If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to
 time, for instance, that would give the right impression. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of the Auror Office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambitio
n to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very easily ...\rquote 
\par Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: so Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she?
\par \lquote So basically,\rquote  he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, \lquote you\rquote d like to give the impression that I\rquote m working for the Ministry?\rquote 
\par \lquote It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry,\rquote  said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cottoned on so quickly. \lquote The \'93Chosen One\'94, you know ... it\rquote s all abo
ut giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are happening ...\rquote 
\par \lquote But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,\rquote  said Harry, still endeavouring to keep his voice friendly, \lquote won\rquote t that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry\rquote s up to?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, \lquote well, yes, that\rquote s partly why we\rquote d like \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, I don\rquote t think that\rquote ll work,\rquote  said Harry pleasantly. \lquote You see, I don\rquote t like some of the things the Ministry\rquote s doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.\rquote 
\par Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment, but his expression hardened instantly.
\par \lquote I would not expect you to understand,\rquote  he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been. \lquote These are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn\rquote t think Stan should be in Azkaban either,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote You\rquote re making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.\rquote 
\par They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour said, with no pretence at warmth, \lquote I see. You prefer \endash  like your hero Dumbledore \endash  to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t want to be used,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Some would say it\rquote s your duty to be used by the Ministry!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, and others might say it\rquote s your duty to check people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison,\rquote  said Harry, his temper rising now. \lquote You\rquote 
re doing what Barty Crouch did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we\rquote ve got Fudge, pretending everything\rquote s lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we\rquote 
ve got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you\rquote ve got the Chosen One working for you!\rquote 
\par \lquote So you\rquote re not the Chosen One?\rquote  said Scrimgeour.
\par \lquote I thought you said it didn\rquote t matter either way?\rquote  said Harry, with a bitter laugh. \lquote Not to you, anyway.\rquote 
\par \lquote I shouldn\rquote t have said that,\rquote  said Scrimgeour quickly. \lquote It was tactless \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, it was honest,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote One of the only honest things you\rquote ve said to me. You don\rquote t care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you\rquote 
re winning the war against Voldemort. I haven\rquote t forgotten, Minister ...\rquote 
\par He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
I must not tell lies.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t remember you rushing to my defence when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasn\rquote t so keen to be pals last year.\rquote 
\par They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate its worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottom\-most branches of the rhododendron bush.
\par \lquote What is Dumbledore up to?\rquote  said Scrimgeour brusquely. \lquote Where does he go, when he is absent from Hogwarts?\rquote 
\par \lquote No idea,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote And you wouldn\rquote t tell me if you knew,\rquote  said Scrimgeour, \lquote would you?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I wouldn\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can\rquote t find out by other means.\rquote 
\par \lquote You can try,\rquote  said Harry indifferently. \lquote But you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I\rquote d have thought you\rquote d have learned from his mistakes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed he\rquote 
s not Minister any more, but Dumbledore\rquote s still Headmaster. I\rquote d leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you.\rquote 
\par There was a long pause.
\par \lquote Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,\rquote  said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses. \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s man through and through, aren\rquote t you, Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I am,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Glad we straightened that out.\rquote 
\par And turning his back on the Minister for Magic, he strode back towards the house.

arry, Ron and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts. The Ministry had arranged this one-off connection to the Floo Network to return students quickly and safely to the school. Only Mrs Weasley was there to say goodbye, as Mr Weasley
,
 Fred, George, Bill and Fleur were all at work. Mrs Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting. Admittedly, it took very little to set her off lately; she had been crying on and off ever since Percy had stormed from the house on Christmas Day w
ith his glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which Fred, George and Ginny all claimed credit).

\par \lquote Yeah, don\rquote t worry about us,\rquote  said Ron, permitting his mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, \lquote or about Percy. He\rquote s such a prat, it\rquote s not really a loss, is it?\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in her arms.
\par \lquote Promise me you\rquote ll look after yourself ... stay out of trouble ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I always do, Mrs Weasley,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I like a quiet life, you know me.\rquote 
\par She gave a watery chuckle and stood back.
\par \lquote Be good, then, all of you ...\rquote 
\par Harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted, \lquote Hogwarts!\rquote  He had one last fleeting view of the Weasleys\rquote  kitchen and Mrs Weasley\rquote 
s tearful face before the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he caught blurred glimpses of other wizarding rooms, which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look; then he was slowing d
own, finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor McGonagall\rquote s office. She barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate.
\par \lquote Evening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the carpet.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, Professor.\rquote 
\par Harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came spinning into view. When Ginny had arrived, all three of them trooped out of McGonagall\rquote 
s office and off towards Gryffindor Tower. Harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed; the sun was already sink
ing over grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over The Burrow garden. In the distance, he could see Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin.
\par \lquote Baubles,\rquote  said Ron confidently, when they reached the Fat Lady, who was looking rather paler than usual, and winced at his loud voice.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  she said.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean, \'93no\'94?\rquote 
\par \lquote There is a new password,\rquote  she said. \lquote And please don\rquote t shout.\rquote

\par \lquote Harry! Ginny!\rquote 
\par Hermione was hurrying towards them, very pink-faced and wearing a cloak, hat and gloves.
\par \lquote I got back a couple of hours ago, I\rquote ve just been down to visit Hagrid and Buck\emdash  I mean Witherwings,\rquote  she said breathlessly. \lquote Did you have a good Christmas?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Ron at once, \lquote pretty eventful, Rufus Scrim\emdash \rquote

\par \lquote Precisely,\rquote  said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice, and swung forwards to reveal the portrait hole.
\par \lquote What\rquote s up with her?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Overindulged over Christmas, apparently,\rquote  said Hermione, rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room. \lquote She and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by
 the Charms corridor. Anyway ...\rquote 
\par She rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then pulled out a scroll of parchment with Dumbledore\rquote s writing on it.
\par \lquote Great,\rquote  said Harry, unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled for the following night. \lquote I\rquote ve got loads to tell him \endash  and you. Let\rquote s sit down \endash \rquote 
\par But at that moment there was a loud squeal of \lquote Won-Won!\rquote  and Lavender Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into Ron\rquote s arms. Several onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a tinkling laugh and said, \lquote There\rquote 
s a table over here ... coming, Ginny?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, thanks, I said I\rquote d meet Dean,\rquote  said Ginny, though Harry could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusi\-astic. Leaving 
Ron and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling match, Harry led Hermione over to the spare table.
\par \lquote So how was your Christmas?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, fine,\rquote  she shrugged. \lquote Nothing special. How was it at Won-Won\rquote s?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll tell you in a minute,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Look, Hermione, can\rquote t you \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I can\rquote t,\rquote  she said flatly. \lquote So don\rquote t even ask.\rquote 
\par \lquote I thought maybe, you know, over Christmas \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of five-hundred-year-old wine, Harry, not me. So what was this important news you wanted to tell me?\rquote 
\par She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so Harry dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all that he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape.
\par When he had finished, Hermione sat in thought for a moment and then said, \lquote Don\rquote t you think \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he\rquote s doing?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, yes,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Ron\rquote s dad and Lupin think so,\rquote  Harry said grudgingly. \lquote But this definitely proves Malfoy\rquote s planning something, you can\rquote t deny that.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I can\rquote t,\rquote  she answered slowly.
\par \lquote And he\rquote s acting on Voldemort\rquote s orders, just like I said!\rquote 
\par \lquote Hmm ... did either of them actually mention Voldemort\rquote s name?\rquote 
\par Harry frowned, trying to remember.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not sure ... Snape definitely said \'93your master\'94, and who else would that be?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Hermione, biting her lip. \lquote Maybe his father?\rquote 
\par She stared across the room, apparently lost in thought, not even noticing Lavender tickling Ron. \lquote How\rquote s Lupin?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not great,\rquote  said Harry, and he told her all about Lupin\rquote s mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing. \lquote Have you heard of this Fenrir Greyback?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I have!\rquote  said Hermione, sounding startled. \lquote And so have you, Harry!\rquote 
\par \lquote When, History of Magic? You know full well I never listened ...\rquote 
\par \lquote No, no, not History of Magic \endash  Malfoy threatened Borgin with him!\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Back in Knockturn Alley, don\rquote t you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that he\rquote 
d be checking up on Borgin\rquote s progress!\rquote 
\par Harry gaped at her. \lquote I forgot! But this }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 proves }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Malfoy\rquote 
s a Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do?\rquote 
\par \lquote It is pretty suspicious,\rquote  breathed Hermione. \lquote Unless ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, come on,\rquote  said Harry in exasperation, \lquote you can\rquote t get round this one!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well ... there is the possibility it was an empty threat.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re unbelievable, you are,\rquote  said Harry, shaking his head. \lquote We\rquote ll see who\rquote s right ... you\rquote ll be eating your words, Hermione, just like the Ministry. Oh yeah, I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as well ...
\rquote 
\par And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the Minister for Magic, for Hermione, like Ron, thought that after all the Ministry had put Harry through the previous year, they had a great nerve asking him for help now.
\par The new term started next morning with a pleasant sur\-prise for the sixth-years: a large sign had been pinned to the common-room noticeboards overnight.

\par \lquote Whoa!\rquote  whi
spered Seamus, and he, Dean and Neville put their heads a little closer to hear what Apparition felt like. For the rest of the day, Harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth-years to describe the sensation of Apparition. All of them seemed awe
d
, rather than put off, when he told them how uncomfortable it was, and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for hi
s lesson with Dumbledore.
\par The lamps in Dumbledore\rquote s office were lit, the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in their frames and the Pensieve was ready upon the desk once more. Dumbledore\rquote s hands lay either side of it, the right one as bla
ckened and burned-looking as ever. It did not seem to have healed at all and Harry wondered, for perhaps the hundredth time, what had caused such a distinctive injury, but did not ask; Dumbledore had said that he would know eventually and there was, in an
y case, another subject he wanted to discuss. But before Harry could say anything about Snape and Malfoy, Dumbledore spoke.
\par \lquote I hear that you met the Minister for Magic over Christmas?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote He\rquote s not very happy with me.\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  sighed Dumbledore. \lquote He is not very happy with me, either. We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on.\rquote 
\par Harry grinned.
\par \lquote He wanted me to tell the wizarding community that the Ministry\rquote s doing a wonderful job.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore smiled.
\par \lquote It was Fudge\rquote s idea originally, you know. During his last days in office, when he was trying desperately to cling to his post, he sought a meeting with you, hoping that you would give him your support \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote After everything Fudge did last year?\rquote  said Harry angrily. \lquote After }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Umbridge?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote So that\rquote s why you argued!\rquote  Harry blurted out. \lquote It was in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Daily Prophet.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

 said Dumbledore, \lquote if only accidentally. Yes, that was why we argued. Well, it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last.\rquote 
\par \lquote He accused me of being \'93Dumbledore\rquote s man through and through\'94.\rquote 
\par \lquote How very rude of him.\rquote 
\par \lquote I told him I was.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry\rquote s intense embarrassment, he suddenly realised that Dumbledore\rquote 
s bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at his own knees. When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady.
\par \lquote I am very touched, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you\rquote re not at Hogwarts,\rquote  said Harry, still looking fixedly at his knees.
\par \lquote Yes, he is very nosy about that,\rquote  said Dumbledore, now sounding cheerful, and Harry thought it safe to look up again. \lquote He has even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set Dawlish to tail me. It wasn\rquote t kin
d. I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.\rquote 
\par \lquote So they still don\rquote t know where you go?\rquote  asked Harry, hoping for more information on this intriguing subject, but Dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his half-moon spectacles.
\par \lquote No, they don\rquote t, and the time is not quite right for you to know, either. Now, I suggest we press on, unless there\rquote s anything else \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote There is, actually, sir,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote It\rquote s about Malfoy and Snape.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Professor }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Snape, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, sir. I overheard them during Professor Slughorn\rquote s party ... well, I followed them, actually ...\rquote 
\par Dumbledore listened to Harry\rquote s story with an impassive face. When Harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments, then said, \lquote Thank you for telling me t
his, Harry, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great importance.\rquote 
\par \lquote Not of great importance?\rquote  repeated Harry incredulously. \lquote Professor, did you understand \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood everything you told me,\rquote  said Dumbledore, a little sharply. \lquote 
I think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did. Again, I am glad that you have confided in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet.\rquote 
\par Harry sat in seething silence, glaring at Dumbledore. What was going on? Did this mean that Dumbledore had indeed ordered Snape to find out what Malfoy was doing,
 in which case he had already heard everything Harry had just told him from Snape? Or was he really worried by what he had heard, but pretending not to be?
\par \lquote So, sir,\rquote  said Harry, in what he hoped was a polite, calm voice, \lquote you definitely still trust \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,\rquote  said Dumbledore, but he did not sound very tolerant any more. \lquote My answer has not changed.\rquote 
\par \lquote I should think not,\rquote  said a snide voice; Phineas Nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep. Dumbledore ignored him.
\par \lquote And now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more important things to discuss with you this evening.\rquote 
\par Harry sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject, if he insisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy? As though he had read Harry\rquote s mind, Dumbledore shook his head.
\par \lquote Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute!\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think what you\rquote ve got to say is unimportant, sir,\rquote  said Harry stiffly.
\par \lquote Well, you are quite right, because it is not,\rquote  said Dumbledore briskly. \lquote I have two more memories to show you this evening, both obtained with enormou
s difficulty, and the second of them is, I think, the most important I have collected.\rquote 
\par Harry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had received, but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further.
\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, \lquote 
we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my
 company on a trip to Diagon Alley and that I, in turn, warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school.
\par \lquote Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Riddle, a quiet boy in his second-hand robes, who lined up with the ot
her first-years to be Sorted. He was placed in Slytherin house almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,\rquote  continued Dumbledore, waving his black\-
ened hand towards the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and unmoving. \lquote How soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the house could talk to snakes, I do not know \endash 
 perhaps that very evening. The knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of self-importance.
\par \lquote However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it reached the staff. He showed no sign of out\-
ward arrogance or aggression at all. As an unusually talented and very good-looking orphan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy
 from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival. He seemed polite, quiet and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all were most favourably impressed by him.\rquote 
\par \lquote Didn\rquote t you tell them, sir, what he\rquote d been like when you met him at the orphanage?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote No, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore paused and looked enquiringly at Harry, who had opened his mouth to speak. Here, again, was Dumbledore\rquote s tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it! But then Harry remembered something ...

\par \lquote But you didn\rquote t }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 really }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 trust him, sir, did you? He told me ... the Rid
dle who came out of that diary said \'93Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did\'94.\rquote 
\par \lquote Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I had, as I have already indi\-cated, resolved to keep a 
close eye upon him, and so I did. I cannot pretend that I gleaned a great deal from my observa\-
tions at first. He was very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much. He was car
eful never to reveal as much again, but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement, nor what Mrs Cole had confided in me. However, he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues.
\par \lquote As he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want of a better term, although as I have already indicated, Riddle undoubt\-
edly felt no affection for any of them. This group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle. They were a motley collec\-
tion; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish, gravitating towards a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of th
e Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.
\par \lquote Rigidly controlled by Riddle, they were never detected in open wrong-doing, although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to 
which they were never satisfactorily linked, the most serious of which was, of course, the opening of the Chamber of Secrets, which resulted in the death of a girl. As you know, Hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime.
\par \lquote I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts,\rquote  said Dumbledore, placing his withered hand on the Pensieve. \lquote 
Few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him; they are too terrified. What I know, I found out after he had left Hogwarts, after much painstaking effort, a
fter tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking, after searching old records and questioning Muggle and wizard witnesses alike.
\par \lquote Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was obsessed with his parentage. This is understandable, of c
ourse; he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there. It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle Senior on the shields in the trophy room, on the lists of prefects in the old school records, even 
i
n the books of wizarding history. Finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was then that he dropped the name for ever, assumed the identity of Lord Voldemort, and began his investigations into his p
reviously despised mother\rquote s family \endash  the woman whom, you will remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death.
\par \lquote All he had to go upon was the single name \'93Marvolo\'94, which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother\rquote s father\rquote 
s name. Finally, after painstaking research through old books of wizarding families, he discovered the existence of Slytherin\rquote s surviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which h
e returned annually and set off to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand ...\rquote 
\par Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.
\par \lquote I was very lucky to collect this,\rquote  he said, as he poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve. \lquote As you will understand when we have experienced it. Shall we?\rquote 
\par Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor into almost total darkness.
\par It took him several seconds to recognise the place, by which time Dumbledore had landed beside him. The Gaunts\rquote  house was now more indescribably filt
hy than anywhere Harry had ever seen. The ceiling was thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; mouldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots. The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man w
i
th hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth. He was slumped in an armchair by the fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead. But then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake, raising a wand in
 his right hand, and a short knife in his left.
\par The door creaked open. There on the threshold, holding an old-fashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry recognised at once: tall, pale, dark-haired and handsome \endash  the teenage Voldemort.
\par Voldemort\rquote s eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair. For a few seconds they looked at each other, then the man staggered upright, the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor.
\par \lquote YOU!\rquote  he bellowed. \lquote YOU!\rquote 
\par And he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle, wand and knife held aloft.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Stop.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699

\par Voldemort was gazing at Morfin, as though appraising his possibilities. Now he moved a little closer and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Riddle came back?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par He looked away, staggering slightly, and Voldemort moved forwards. As he did so, an unnatural darkness fell, extinguish\-ing Voldemort\rquote s lamp and Morfin\rquote s candle, extinguishing everything ...
\par Dumbledore\rquote s fingers closed tightly around Harry\rquote s arm and they were soaring back into the present again. The soft golden light in Dumbledore\rquote s office seemed to dazzle Harry\rquote s eyes after that impenetrable darkness.
\par \lquote Is that all?\rquote  said Harry at once. \lquote Why did it go dark, what happened?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point onwards,\rquote  said Dumbledore, gesturing Harry back into his seat. \lquote When he awoke next morning, he was lying on the floor, quite alone. Marvolo\rquote s ring had gone.
\par \lquote Meanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid was running along the high street, screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house: Tom Riddle Senior, and his mother and father.
\par \lquote The Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I am aware, they do not know to this day how the Riddles died, for the Avada Kedavra Curse does not usually leave any sign of damage ... the exception sits before me,\rquote 
 Dumbledore added, with a nod to Harry\rquote s scar. The Ministry, on the other hand, knew at once that this was a wizard\rquote 
s murder. They also knew that a convicted Muggle-hater lived across the valley from the Riddle house, a Muggle-hater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people.
\par \lquote So the Ministry call
ed upon Morfin. They did not need to question him, to use Veritaserum or Legilimency. He admitted to the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could know. He was proud, he said, to have killed the Muggles, had been awaiting his chance all t
hese years. He handed over his wand, which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles. And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight. All that disturbed him was the fact that his father\rquote s ring had disappeared. \'93
He\rquote ll kill me for losing it,\'94 he told his captors, over and over again. \'93He\rquote ll kill me for losing his ring.\'94
 And that, apparently, was all he ever said again. He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban, lamenting the loss of Marvolo\rquote s last heirloom, and is buried beside the prison alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls.
\rquote 
\par \lquote So Voldemort stole Morfin\rquote s wand and used it?\rquote  said Harry, sitting up straight.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote We have no memories to show us this, but I think we can be fairly sure what happened. Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded across the valley to \'93
the big house over the way\'94. There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother, and, for good measure, his Muggle grand-par
ents, thus obliterating the last of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle\rquote 
s mind, laid Morfin\rquote s wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he wore and departed.\rquote 
\par \lquote And Morfin never realised he hadn\rquote t done it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Never,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote He gave, as I say, a full and boastful confession.\rquote 
\par \lquote But he had this real memory in him all the time!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote and why should anybody delve further into Morfin\rquote s mind when he had already con\-
fessed to the crime? However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I could about Voldemort\rquote 
s past. I extracted this memory with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure Morfin\rquote s release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their decision, however, Morfin had died.\rquote 
\par \lquote But how come the Ministry didn\rquote t realise that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin?\rquote  Harry asked angrily. \lquote He was under age at the time, wasn\rquote t he? I thought they could detect under-age magic!\rquote 
\par \lquote You are quite right \endash  they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: you will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Dobby,\rquote  growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. \lquote So if you\rquote re under age and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard\rquote s house, the Ministry won\rquote t know?\rquote 
\par \lquote They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harry\rquote s face. \lquote They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring\rquote 
s obedience while within their walls.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, that\rquote s rubbish,\rquote  snapped Harry. \lquote Look what happened here, look what happened to Morfin!\rquote 
\par \lquote I agree,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Whatever Morfin was, he did not deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders he had not committed. But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory before we part ...\rquote 
\par Dumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and Harry fell silent at once, remembering that Dumbledore
 had said it was the most important one he had collected. Harry noticed that the contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go off?
\par \lquote This will not take long,\rquote  said Dumbledore, when he had finally emptied the phial. \lquote We shall be back before you know it. Once more into the Pensieve, then ...\rquote 
\par And Harry fell again through the silver surface, landing this time right in front of a man he recognised at once.
\par It was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harr
y was so used to him bald that he found the sight of Slughorn with thick, shiny, straw-coloured hair quite disconcerting; it looked as though he had had his head thatched, though there was already a shiny Galleon-sized bald patch on his crown. His moustac
h
e, less massive than it was these days, was gingery-blond. He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain. His little feet resting upon a velvet pouf
fe, he was sitting well back in a comfortable winged armchair, one hand grasping a small glass of wine, the other searching through a box of crystallised pineapple.
\par Harry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in Slughorn\rquote s office. Half a dozen boys were sitting around Slughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his, and all in their mid-teens. Harry recog\-
nised Riddle at once. His was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys. His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that he was wearing Marvolo\rquote 
s gold and black ring; he had already killed his father.
\par \lquote Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?\rquote  Riddle asked.
\par \lquote Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn\rquote t tell you,\rquote  said Slughorn, wagging a reproving, sugar-covered finger at Riddle, though ruining the effect slightly by winking. \lquote I must say, I\rquote 
d like to know where you get your information, boy; more knowledge\-able than half the staff, you are.\rquote 
\par Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admir\-ing looks.
\par \lquote What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn\rquote t, and your careful flattery of the people who matter \endash  thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you\rquote re quite right, it is my favourite \endash \rquote 
\par As several of the boys tittered, something very odd hap\-pened. The whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog, so that Harry could see nothing but the face of Dumbledore, who was standing beside him. Then Slughorn\rquote 
s voice rang out through the mist, unnaturally loudly: \lquote \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you\rquote ll go wrong, boy, mark my words.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par The fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it, nor did anybody look as though anything unusual had just happened. Bewildered, Harry looked around as a small golden clock standing upon Slughorn\rquote 
s desk chimed eleven o\rquote clock.
\par \lquote Good gracious, is it that time already?\rquote  said Slughorn. \lquote You\rquote d better get going, boys, or we\rquote ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it\rquote s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.\rquote 

\par Slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out. Riddle, however, stayed behind. Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn.
\par \lquote Look sharp, Tom,\rquote  said Slughorn, turning round and find\-ing him still present. \lquote You don\rquote t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Sir, I wanted to ask you something.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ask away, then, m\rquote boy, ask away ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Sir, I wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes?\rquote 
\par And it happened all over again: the dense fog filled the room so that Harry could not see Slughorn or Riddle at all; only Dumbledore, smiling serenely beside him. Then Slughorn\rquote s voice boomed out again, just as it had done before.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote I don\rquote t know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn\rquote t tell you if I did! Now get out of here at once and don\rquote 
t let me catch you mentioning them again!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote Well, that\rquote s that,\rquote  said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry. \lquote Time to go.\rquote 
\par And Harry\rquote s feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, back on to the rug in front of Dumbledore\rquote s desk.
\par \lquote That\rquote s all there is?\rquote  said Harry blankly.
\par Dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory of all, but he could not see what was so significant about it. Adm
ittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it, was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that Riddle had asked a question and failed to get an answer.
\par \lquote As you might have noticed,\rquote  said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk, \lquote that memory has been tampered with.\rquote 
\par \lquote Tampered with?\rquote  repeated Harry, sitting back down too.
\par \lquote Certainly,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote Professor Slughorn has meddled with his own recollections.\rquote 
\par \lquote But why would he do that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote 
He has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is all to th
e good, for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations.
\par \lquote And so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, Harry. It will be your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all.\rquote 
\par Harry stared at him.
\par \lquote But surely, sir,\rquote  he said, keeping his voice as respectful as possible, \lquote you don\rquote t need me \endash  you could use Legilimency ... or Veritaserum ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote He is much more accom\-
plished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection.
\par \lquote No, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Slughorn by force, and might do much more harm than good; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has his weaknesses like the rest of us and I believe that 
you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defences. It is most important that we secure the true memory, Harry ... how important, we will only know when we have seen the real thing. So, good luck ... and goodnight.\rquote 
\par A little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry got to his feet quickly.
\par \lquote Goodnight, sir.\rquote 
\par As he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly heard Phineas Nigellus say, \lquote I can\rquote t see why the boy should be able to do it better than you, Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote I wouldn\rquote t expect you to, Phineas,\rquote  replied Dumbledore, and Fawkes gave another low, musical cry.

\par Hermione, however, took a gloomier view.
\par \lquote He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldn\rquote t get it out of him,\rquote  she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break. \lquote Horcruxes ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone and ankle-deep in snow.
\par Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Harry, Ron and Hermione had to share a desk. Today, Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie, and ignored both Harry and Ron.
\par \lquote What\rquote ve }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 done?\rquote  Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermione
\rquote s haughty profile.
\par But before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room.
\par \lquote Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalott\rquote s Third Law ... who can tell me \endash ? But Miss Granger can, of course!\rquote 
\par Hermione recited at top speed: \lquote Golpalott\rquote s-Third-Law-states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to-more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separate-components.\rquote 
\par \lquote Precisely!\rquote  beamed Slughorn. \lquote Ten points for Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalott\rquote s Third Law as true ...\rquote 
\par Harry was going to have to take Slughorn\rquote s word for it that Golpalott\rquote s Third Law was true, because he had not under\-stood any of it. Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next, either.
\par \lquote ... which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion\rquote s ingredients by Scarpin\rquote s Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to tho
se ingredients in and of themselves, but to find that added component which will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements \endash \rquote 
\par Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half-open, doodling absently on his new copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Advanced Potion-Making. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on.
\par \lquote ... and so,\rquote  finished Slughorn, \lquote I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good luck, and don\rquote 
t forget your protective gloves!\rquote 
\par Hermione had left her stool and was halfway towards Slughorn\rquote s desk before the rest of the class had realised it was time to m
ove, and by the time Harry, Ron and Ernie returned to the table, she had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it.
\par \lquote It\rquote s a shame that the Prince won\rquote t be able to help you much with this, Harry,\rquote  she said brightly as she straightened up. \lquote You have to understand the principles involved this time. No short cuts or cheats!\rquote 
\par Annoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Slughorn\rquote s desk, which was a garish shade of pink, tipped it into his cauldron an
d lit a fire underneath it. He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything Harry had done.
\par \lquote You sure the Prince hasn\rquote t got any tips?\rquote  Ron muttered to Harry.
\par Harry pulled out his trusty copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Advanced Potion-Making }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
and turned to the chapter on Antidotes. There was Golpalott\rquote s Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the Prince\rquote s hand to
 explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it.
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  said Harry gloomily.
\par Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at non-verbal incan\-
tations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Specialis revelio!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him.
\par It took Harry only five minutes to realise that his reputa\-
tion as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had with\-
drawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermione\rquote s expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being out-performed in every Potions class. She was now decanting the myste
riously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. More to avoid watching this irritating sight than any\-thing else, Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince\rquote s book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force.
\par And there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Just shove a bezoar down their throats.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699

\par It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened towards the st
ore cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a small card box on which had been scribbled the word \lquote Bezoars\rquote .
\par He opened the box just as Slughorn called, \lquote Two minutes left, everyone!\rquote 
 Inside were half a dozen shrivelled brown objects, looking more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the box back in the cupboard and hurried back to his cauldron.
\par \lquote Time\rquote s ... UP!\rquote  called Slughorn genially. \lquote Well, let\rquote s see how you\rquote ve done! Blaise ... what have you got for me?\rquote 
\par Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up com\-
pletely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand.
\par Slughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie\rquote s potion and passed on to Ron\rquote s with a grimace. He did not linger over Ron\rquote s cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly.
\par \lquote And you, Harry,\rquote  he said. \lquote What have you got to show me?\rquote 
\par Harry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm.
\par Slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him. Then he threw back his head and roared with laughter.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve got a nerve, boy!\rquote  he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it. \lquote Oh, you\rquote re like your mother ... well, I can\rquote 
t fault you ... a bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions!\rquote 
\par Hermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose, looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients including a chunk of her own hair, bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry.
\par \lquote And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?\rquote  she asked through gritted teeth.
\par \lquote That\rquote s the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!\rquote  said Slughorn happily, before Harry could reply. \lquote Just like his mother, she had the same intuitive grasp of potion-making, it\rquote 
s undoubtedly from Lily he gets it ... yes, Harry, yes, if you\rquote ve got a bezoar to hand, of course that would do the trick ... although as they don\rquote t work on everything, and are pretty rare, it\rquote 
s still worth knowing how to mix antidotes ...\rquote 
\par The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled some\-
thing that looked like cat sick over himself. Before either of them could express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any work, however, the bell rang.
\par \lquote Time to pack up!\rquote  said Slughorn. \lquote And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!\rquote 
\par Still chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon.
\par Harry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were the only two left in the room.
\par \lquote Come on, now, Harry, you\rquote ll be late for your next lesson,\rquote  said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragonskin briefcase.
\par \lquote Sir,\rquote  said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, \lquote I wanted to ask you something.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Sir, I wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes?\rquote 
\par Slughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He licked his lips and said hoarsely, \lquote What did you say?\rquote 
\par \lquote I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore put you up to this,\rquote  whispered Slughorn.
\par His voice had changed completely. It was not genial any more, but shocked, terrified. He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow.
\par \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s shown you that \endash  that memory,\rquote  said Slughorn. \lquote Well? Hasn\rquote t he?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie.
\par \lquote Yes, of course,\rquote  said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white face. \lquote Of course ... well, if you\rquote ve seen that memory, Harry, you\rquote ll know that I don\rquote t know anything \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par He seized his dragonskin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and marched to the dungeon door.
\par \lquote Sir,\rquote  said Harry desperately, \lquote I just thought there might be a bit more to the memory \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Did you?\rquote  said Slughorn. \lquote Then you were wrong, weren\rquote t you? WRONG!\rquote 
\par He bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another word, slammed the dungeon door behind him.
\par Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous interview. Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly. Ron was resentful that Harry hadn\rquote 
t slipped him a bezoar, too.
\par \lquote It would\rquote ve just looked stupid if we\rquote d both done it!\rquote  said Harry irritably. \lquote Look, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort, didn\rquote t I? Oh, will you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Infuriated by his failure and by Ron and Hermione\rquote s atti\-tudes, Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn. He decided that, for the time being, he would let Slughorn think that he had forgotten
 all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack.
\par When Harry did not question Slughorn again, the Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and appeared to have put
 the matter from his mind. Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch prac\-
tice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Harry checked with Hermione a
nd Ginny: neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional o
pportunities to question him.
\par Meanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first time in living memory. She was so shocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar.
\par \lquote I haven\rquote t found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!\rquote  she told him. \lquote Not a single one! I\rquote ve been right through the restricted section and even in the most }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

ped, stuffing it back into her bag.
\par The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness. Purplish-grey clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth-years
\rquote  first Apparition lesson, which was sched\-uled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds.
\par When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had
 come down with Lavender) they found that the tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick and Sprout \endash 
 the Heads of House \endash 
 and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition Instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colourless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whethe
r constant dis\-appearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish.
\par \lquote Good morning,\rquote  said the Ministry wizard, when all the stu\-dents had arrived and the Heads of House had called for quiet. \lquote 
My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry Apparition Instructor for the next twelve weeks. I hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition test in this time \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!\rquote  barked Professor McGonagall.
\par Everybody looked round. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he looked furious as he stepped away from Crabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argu\-ment. Harry glanced quickly at Snape, who also looked annoyed
, though Harry strongly suspected that this was less because of Malfoy\rquote s rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his house.
\par \lquote \endash  by which time, many of you may be ready to take your test,\rquote  Twycross continued, as though there had been no interruption.
\par \lquote As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The Headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practise. May I emphasise that you will not
 be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be unwise to try.
\par \lquote I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you.\rquote 
\par There was a great scrambling and jostling as people separ\-ated, banged into each other, and ordered others out of their space. The Heads of House moved among the students, marshalling them into position and breaking up arguments.
\par \lquote Harry, where are you going?\rquote  demanded Hermione.
\par But Harry did not answer; he wa
s moving quickly through the crowd, past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivvying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by do
dging around Ernie Macmillan, he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd, directly behind Malfoy, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet away and looking mutinous.

\par \lquote I don\rquote t know how much longer, all right?\rquote  Malfoy shot at him, oblivious to Harry standing right behind him. \lquote It\rquote s taking longer than I thought it would.\rquote 
\par Crabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to second-guess what he was going to say.
\par \lquote Look, it\rquote s none of your business what I\rquote m doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as you\rquote re told and keep a lookout!\rquote 
\par \lquote I tell my friends what I\rquote m up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for me,\rquote  Harry said, just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him.
\par Malfoy spun round on the spot, his hand flying to his wand, but at that precise moment the four Heads of House shouted, \lquote Quiet!\rquote  and silence fell again. Malfoy turned slowly to face the front.
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote  said Twycross. \lquote Now then ...\rquote 
\par He waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in front of every student.
\par \lquote The important things to remember when Apparating are the three Ds!\rquote  said Twycross. \lquote Destination, Determination, Deliberation!
\par \lquote Step one: fix your mind firmly upon the desired }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 destin\-ation,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
said Twycross. \lquote In this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.\rquote 
\par Everybody looked around furtively, to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told. Harry gazed at the circular patch o
f dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldn\rquote t stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts.
\par \lquote Step two,\rquote  said Twycross, \lquote focus your }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 determination }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
to occupy the visualised space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body!\rquote 
\par Harry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as though
 he was straining to lay a Quaffle-sized egg. Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop.
\par \lquote Step three,\rquote  called Twycross, \lquote and only when I give the com\-mand ... turn on the spot, feeling your way into nothingness, moving with }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 delib

\par Harry glanced around again; lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate so quickly.
\par \lquote \endash  two \endash \rquote 
\par Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already forgotten what the three Ds stood for.
\par \lquote \endash  THREE!\rquote 
\par Harry spun on the spot, lost his balance and nearly fell over. He was not the only one. The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had done a kind of pirouet\-
ting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him.
\par \lquote Never mind, never mind,\rquote  said Twycross dryly, who did not seem to have expected anything better. \lquote Adjust your hoops, please, and back to your original positions ...\rquote 
\par The second attempt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad. Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen. There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around, terrified, to see Susan B
ones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started.
\par The Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her leg but looking horrified.
\par \lquote Splinching, or the separation of random body parts,\rquote  said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, \lquote occurs when the mind is insufficiently }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 determined. }{

\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 and move, without haste, but with }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 deliberation ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 thus.\rquote 
\par Twycross stepped forwards, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall.
\par \lquote Remember the three Ds,\rquote  he said, \lquote and try again ... one \endash  two \endash  three \endash \rquote 
\par But an hour later, Susan\rquote s Splinching was still the most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, \lquote Until next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget: }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Destin\-ation. Determination. Deliberation.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par With that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began moving towards the Entrance Hall.
\par \lquote How did you do?\rquote  asked Ron, hurrying towards Harry. \lquote I think I felt something the last time I tried \endash  a kind of tingling in my feet.\rquote 
\par \lquote I expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,\rquote  said a voice behind them, and Hermione stalked past, smirking.
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t feel anything,\rquote  said Harry, ignoring this inter\-ruption. \lquote But I don\rquote t care about that now \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean, you don\rquote t care ... don\rquote t you want to learn to Apparate?\rquote  said Ron incredulously.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not fussed, really. I prefer flying,\rquote  said Harry, glancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was, and speeding up as they came into the Entrance Hall. \lquote Look, hurry up, will you, there\rquote 
s something I want to do ...\rquote 
\par Perplexed, Ron followed Harry back to Gryffindor Tower at a run. They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply 
turned back and took one of their trusted short cuts. Within five minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole.
\par \lquote Are you going to tell me what we\rquote re doing, then?\rquote  asked Ron, panting slightly.
\par \lquote Up here,\rquote  said Harry, and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys\rquote  staircase.
\par Their dormitory was, as Harry had hoped, empty. He flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched impatiently.
\par \lquote Harry ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Malfoy\rquote s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was argu\-ing with Crabbe just now. I want to know ... aha.\rquote 
\par He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped with the tip of his wand.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote I solemnly swear that I am up to no good }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 ... or Malfoy is, anyway.\rquote 

\par At once, the Marauder\rquote s Map appeared on the parchment\rquote s surface. Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castle\rquote s floors and, moving around it, the tiny, labelled black dots that signified each of the castle\rquote s occupants.

\par \lquote Help me find Malfoy,\rquote  said Harry urgently.
\par He laid the map upon his bed and he and Ron leaned over it, searching.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote There!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 said Ron, after a minute or so. \lquote He\rquote 
s in the Slytherin common room, look ... with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle ...\rquote 
\par Harry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once.
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote m keeping an eye on him from now on,\rquote  he said firmly. \lquote And the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it\rquote 
ll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he\rquote s \endash \rquote 
\par He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong smell of singed material, and began rum\-maging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants.
\par Despite his determination to catch Malfoy out, Harry had no luck at all over the next coupl
e of weeks. Although he consulted the map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious. Admit\-
tedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the cas
tle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry toyed with the possibility 
t
hat Malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very high level of security now operating within the castle. He could only suppose that he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots
 upon the map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle appeared to be going their dif\-ferent ways when they were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older \endash  Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected sadly, were living proof.

\par February moved towards March with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet. To general indignation, a sign went up on all common-room noticeboards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been cancelled. Ron was furious.
\par \lquote It was on my birthday!\rquote  he said. \lquote I was looking forward to that!\rquote 
\par \lquote Not a big surprise, though, is it?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Not after what happened to Katie.\rquote 
\par She had still not returned from St Mungo\rquote s. What was more, further disappearances had been reported in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Daily Prophet, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 including several relatives of students at Hogwarts.
\par \lquote But now all I\rquote ve got to look forward to is stupid Appar\-ition!\rquote  said Ron grumpily. \lquote Big birthday treat ...\rquote 
\par Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as ever, though a few more people had managed 
to Splinch themselves. Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of ill-feeling towards Wilkie Twycross and his three Ds, which had inspired a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which were Dog-breath and Dung-head.
\par \lquote Happy birthday, Ron,\rquote  said Harry, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast. \lquote Have a present.\rquote 
\par He threw the package across on to Ron\rquote s bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night.
\par \lquote Cheers,\rquote  said Ron drowsily, and as he ripped off the paper Harry got out of bed, opened his own trunk and began rum\-maging in it for the Marauder\rquote s Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the contents of his
 trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tap\-ping it quietly and murmuring, \lquote I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,\rquote  so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear.
\par \lquote Nice one, Harry!\rquote  said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper\rquote s gloves Harry had given him.
\par \lquote No problem,\rquote  said Harry absent-mindedly, as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. \lquote Hey ... I don\rquote t think he\rquote s in his bed \'85\rquote 
\par Ron did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure.
\par \lquote Seriously good haul this year!\rquote  he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. \lquote See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think I\rquote 
ll come of age next year too ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Cool,\rquote  muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering mo
re closely at the map. Where was Malfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast ... he was nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study ... he wasn\rquote t in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing ...

\par \lquote Want one?\rquote  said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons.
\par \lquote No thanks,\rquote  said Harry, looking up. \lquote Malfoy\rquote s gone again!\rquote 
\par \lquote Can\rquote t have done,\rquote  said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. \lquote Come on, if you don\rquote t hurry up you\rquote 
ll have to Apparate on an empty stomach ... might make it easier, I suppose ...\rquote 
\par Ron looked thoughtfully at the box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a third.
\par Harry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, \lquote Mischief managed,\rquote  though it hadn\rquote t been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an explanation for Malfoy\rquote 
s periodic disappearances, but he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, but even with the Invisibi
lity Cloak this was an impractical idea; he had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy around school all day without his absence being remarked upon.
\par \lquote Ready?\rquote  he said to Ron.
\par He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realised that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window with a strangely un\-focused look on his face.
\par \lquote Ron? Breakfast.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not hungry.\rquote 
\par Harry stared at him.
\par \lquote I thought you just said \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, all right, I\rquote ll come down with you,\rquote  sighed Ron, \lquote but I don\rquote t want to eat.\rquote 
\par Harry scrutinised him suspiciously.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s not that,\rquote  Ron sighed again. \lquote You ... you wouldn\rquote t understand.\rquote 
\par \lquote Fair enough,\rquote  said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  said Ron suddenly.
\par \lquote What?\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, I can\rquote t stand it!\rquote 
\par \lquote You can\rquote t stand what?\rquote  asked Harry, now starting to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick.
\par \lquote I can\rquote t stop thinking about her!\rquote  said Ron hoarsely.
\par Harry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender \lquote Lav-Lav\rquote , he would have to put his foot down.
\par \lquote Why does that stop you having breakfast?\rquote  Harry asked, trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think she knows I exist,\rquote  said Ron with a desperate gesture.
\par \lquote She definitely knows you exist,\rquote  said Harry, bewildered. \lquote She keeps snogging you, doesn\rquote t she?\rquote 
\par Ron blinked.
\par \lquote Who are you talking about?\rquote 
\par \lquote Who are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 talking about?\rquote 
 said Harry, with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation.
\par \lquote Romilda Vane,\rquote  said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight.
\par They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry said, \lquote This is a joke, right? You\rquote re joking.\rquote 
\par \lquote I think ... Harry, I think I love her,\rquote  said Ron in a strangled voice.
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Harry, walking up to Ron to get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, \lquote OK ... say that again with a straight face.\rquote 
\par \lquote I love her,\rquote  repeated Ron breathlessly. \lquote Have you seen her hair, it\rquote s all black and shiny and silky ... and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote This is really funny and everything,\rquote  said Harry impatiently, \lquote but joke\rquote s over, all right? Drop it.\rquote 
\par He turned to leave; he had got two steps towards the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked round. Ron\rquote s fist was drawn right back, his face was contorted with rage; he was about to strike again.
\par Harry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Levicorpus!}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upwards once more; he dangled helplessly, upside-down, his robes hanging off him.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote What was that for?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Harry bellowed.
\par \lquote You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!\rquote  shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head.
\par \lquote This is insane!\rquote  said Harry. \lquote What\rquote s got into \endash ?\rquote 
\par And then he saw the box lying open on Ron\rquote s bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll.
\par \lquote Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?\rquote 
\par \lquote They were a birthday present!\rquote  shouted Ron, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free. \lquote I offered you one, didn\rquote t I?\rquote 
\par \lquote You just picked them up off the floor, didn\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote d fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!\rquote 
\par \lquote They didn\rquote t fall off your bed, you prat, don\rquote t you under\-stand? They were mine, I chucked them out of my trunk when I was looking for the map. They\rquote re the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas and they\rquote 
re all spiked with love potion!\rquote 
\par But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron.
\par \lquote Romilda?\rquote  he repeated. \lquote Did you say Romilda? Harry \endash  do you know her? Can you introduce me?\rquote 
\par Harry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part of him \endash  the part closest to his throbbing right ear \endash 
 was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off ... but on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when h
e had attacked, and Harry thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane.
\par \lquote Yeah, I\rquote ll introduce you,\rquote  said Harry, thinking fast. \lquote I\rquote m going to let you down now, OK?\rquote 
\par He sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet again, grinning.
\par \lquote She\rquote ll be in Slughorn\rquote s office,\rquote  said Harry confidently, leading the way to the door.
\par \lquote Why will she be in there?\rquote  asked Ron anxiously, hurrying to keep up.
\par \lquote Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,\rquote  said Harry, inventing wildly.
\par \lquote Maybe I could ask if I can have them with her?\rquote  said Ron eagerly.
\par \lquote Great idea,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication Harry had not foreseen.
\par \lquote You\rquote re late, Won-Won!\rquote  she pouted. \lquote I\rquote ve got you a birth\-day \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Leave me alone,\rquote  said Ron impatiently, \lquote Harry\rquote s going to introduce me to Romilda Vane.\rquote 
\par And without another word to her, he pushed his way out of the portrait hole. Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender, but it might have turned out simply amused, because she looked more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them.

\par Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast, but he answered his office door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet dressing-gown and matching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed.
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  he mumbled. \lquote This is very early for a call ... I generally sleep late on a Saturday ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Professor, I\rquote m really sorry to disturb you,\rquote  said Harry as quietly as possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, attempting to see past Slughorn into his room, \lquote but my friend Ron\rquote 
s swallowed a love potion by mistake. You couldn\rquote t make him an antidote, could you? I\rquote d take him to Madam Pomfrey, but we\rquote re not supposed to have anything from Weasleys\rquote  Wizard Wheezes and, you know ... awkward questions ...
\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote d have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy, Harry, an expert potioneer like you?\rquote  asked Slughorn.
\par \lquote Er,\rquote  said Harry, somewhat distracted by the fact that Ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room, \lquote well, I\rquote 
ve never mixed an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get it right Ron might\rquote ve done something serious \endash \rquote 
\par Helpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, \lquote I can\rquote t see her, Harry \endash  is he hiding her?\rquote 
\par \lquote Was this potion within date?\rquote  asked Slughorn, now eyeing Ron with professional interest. \lquote They can strengthen, you know, the longer they\rquote re kept.\rquote 
\par \lquote That would explain a lot,\rquote  panted Harry, now positively wrestling with Ron to keep him from knocking Slughorn over. \lquote It\rquote s his birthday, Professor,\rquote  he added imploringly.
\par \lquote Oh, all right, come in, then, come in,\rquote  said Slughorn, relenting. \lquote I\rquote ve got the necessary here in my bag, it\rquote s not a difficult antidote ...\rquote 
\par Ron burst through the door into Slughorn\rquote s overheated, crowded study, tripped over a tasselled footstool, regained his balance by seizing Harry around the neck and muttered, \lquote She didn\rquote t see that, did she?\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s not here yet,\rquote  said Harry, watching Slughorn opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle.
\par \lquote That\rquote s good,\rquote  said Ron fervently. \lquote How do I look?\rquote 
\par \lquote Very handsome,\rquote  said Slughorn smoothly, handing Ron a glass of clear liquid. \lquote Now drink that up, it\rquote s a tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, you know.\rquote 
\par \lquote Brilliant,\rquote  said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the antidote down noisily.
\par Harry and Slughorn watched him. For a moment, Ron beamed at them. Then, very slowly, his grin sagged and van\-ished, to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror.
\par \lquote Back to normal, then?\rquote  said Harry, grinning. Slughorn chuckled. \lquote Thanks a lot, Professor.\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t mention it, m\rquote boy, don\rquote t mention it,\rquote  said Slughorn, as Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, looking devastated. \lquote Pick-me-up, that\rquote s what he needs,\rquote 
 Slughorn continued, now bustling over to a table loaded with drinks. \lquote I\rquote ve got Butter\-beer, I\rquote ve got wine, I\rquote ve got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead ... hmm ... meant to give that to D
umbledore for Christmas ... ah well ...\rquote  he shrugged \lquote ... he can\rquote t miss what he\rquote s never had! Why don\rquote t we open it now and celebrate Mr Weasley\rquote 
s birthday? Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love ...\rquote 
\par He chortled again and Ha
rry joined in. This was the first time he had found himself almost alone with Slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him. Perhaps, if he could just keep Slughorn in a good mood ... perhaps if they got through enough of
 the oak-matured mead ...
\par \lquote There you are, then,\rquote  said Slughorn, handing Harry and Ron a glass of mead each, before raising his own. \lquote Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  Ron \endash \rquote  whispered Harry.
\par But Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the toast, had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it.
\par There was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, in which Harry knew there was something terribly wrong and Slughorn, it seemed, did not.
\par \lquote \endash  and may you have many more \endash \rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Ron!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par Ron had dropped his glass; he half-rose from his chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from his mouth and his eyes were bulging from their sockets.
\par \lquote Professor!\rquote  Harry bellowed. \lquote Do something!\rquote 
\par But Slughorn seemed paralysed by shock. Ron twitched and choked: his skin was turning blue.
\par \lquote What \endash  but \endash \rquote  spluttered Slughorn.
\par Harry leapt over a low table and sprinted towards Slughorn\rquote s open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible sound of Ron\rquote s gargling breath filled the room. Then he found it \endash 
 the shrivelled kidney-like stone Slughorn had taken from him in Potions.
\par He hurtled back to Ron\rquote s side, wrenched open his jaw and thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a great shudder, a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still.

\rquote s was the only occupied bed. Harry, Hermione and Ginny were sitting around him; they had spent all day waiting outside the double doors, trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out. Madam Pomfrey had only let them enter at eight o
\rquote clock. Fred and George had arrived at ten past.
\par \lquote This isn\rquote t how we imagined handing over our present,\rquote  said George grimly, putting down a large wrapped gift on Ron\rquote s bedside cabinet and sitting beside Ginny.
\par \lquote Yeah, when we pictured the scene, he was conscious,\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote There we were in Hogsmeade, waiting to surprise him \endash \rquote  said George.
\par \lquote You were in Hogsmeade?\rquote  asked Ginny, looking up.
\par \lquote We were thinking of buying Zonko\rquote s,\rquote  said Fred gloomily. \lquote A Hogsmeade branch, you know, but a fat lot of good it\rquote ll do us if you lot aren\rquote 
t allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff any more ... but never mind that now.\rquote 
\par He drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Ron\rquote s pale face.
\par \lquote How exactly did it happen, Harry?\rquote 
\par Harry retold the story he had already recounted what felt like a hundred times to Dumbledore, to McGonagall, to Madam Pomfrey, to Hermione and to Ginny.
\par \lquote ... and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for help, McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up, and they brought Ron up here. They reckon he\rquote ll be all right. Madam Pomfrey says he\rquote 
ll have to stay here a week or so ... keep taking Essence of Rue ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Blimey, it was lucky you thought of a bezoar,\rquote  said George in a low voice.
\par \lquote Lucky there was one in the room,\rquote  said Harry, who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone.
\par Hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff. She had been exceptionally quiet all day. Having hurtled, white-faced, up to Harry outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened, she had taken almost no part in Harry and Ginny\rquote 
s obsessive discussion about how Ron had been poisoned, but merely stood beside them, clench-jawed and frightened-looking, until at last they had been allowed in to see him.
\par \lquote Do Mum and Dad know?\rquote  Fred asked Ginny.
\par \lquote They\rquote ve already seen him, they arrived an hour ago \endash  they\rquote re in Dumbledore\rquote s office now, but they\rquote ll be back soon ...\rquote 
\par There was a pause while they all watched Ron mumble a little in his sleep.
\par \lquote So the poison was in the drink?\rquote  said Fred quietly.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry at once; he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again. \lquote Slughorn poured it out \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Would he have been able to slip something into Ron\rquote s glass without you seeing?\rquote 
\par \lquote Probably,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but why would Slughorn want to poison Ron?\rquote 
\par \lquote No idea,\rquote  said Fred, frowning. \lquote You don\rquote t think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake? Meaning to get you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Why would Slughorn want to poison Harry?\rquote  asked Ginny.
\par \lquote I dunno,\rquote  said Fred, \lquote but there must be loads of people who\rquote d like to poison Harry, mustn\rquote t there? The \'93Chosen One\'94 and all that?\rquote 
\par \lquote So you think Slughorn\rquote s a Death Eater?\rquote  said Ginny.
\par \lquote Anything\rquote s possible,\rquote  said Fred darkly.
\par \lquote He could be under the Imperius Curse,\rquote  said George.
\par \lquote Or he could be innocent,\rquote  said Ginny. \lquote The poison could have been in the bottle, in which case it was probably meant for Slughorn himself.\rquote 
\par \lquote Who\rquote d want to kill Slughorn?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted Slughorn on his side,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Slughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to Hogwarts. And ...\rquote 
 he thought of the memory Dumbledore had not yet been able to extract from Slughorn, \lquote and maybe Voldemort wants him out of the way, maybe he thinks he could be valuable to Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote But you said Slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to Dumbledore for Christmas,\rquote  Ginny reminded him. \lquote So the poisoner could just as easily have been after Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote Then the poisoner didn\rquote t know Slughorn very well,\rquote  said Hermione, speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad head-cold. \lquote Anyone who knew Slughorn would have known there was a good chance he
\rquote d keep something that tasty for himself.\rquote 
\par \lquote Er-my-nee,\rquote  croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them.
\par They all fell silent, watching him anxiously, but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring.
\par The dormitory doors flew open, making them all jump: Hagrid came striding towards them, his hair rain-flecked, his bearskin coat flapping behind him, a crossbow in his hand, leaving a trail of muddy dolphin-sized footprints all over the floor.
\par \lquote Bin in the Forest all day!\rquote  he panted. \lquote Aragog\rquote s worse, I bin readin\rquote  to him \endash  didn\rquote  get up ter dinner till jus\rquote  now an\rquote  then Professor Sprout told me abou\rquote  Ron! How is he?\rquote 

\par \lquote Not bad,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote They say he\rquote ll be OK.\rquote 
\par \lquote No more than six visitors at a time!\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey, hurrying out of her office.
\par \lquote Hagrid makes six,\rquote  George pointed out.
\par \lquote Oh ... yes ...\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have been counting Hagrid as several people due to his vastness. To cover her confusion she hurried off to clear up his muddy footprints with her wand.
\par \lquote I don\rquote  believe this,\rquote  said Hagrid hoarsely, shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at Ron. \lquote Jus\rquote  don\rquote  believe it ... look at him lyin\rquote  there ... who\rquote d want ter hurt him, eh?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s just what we were discussing,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote We don\rquote t know.\rquote 
\par \lquote Someone couldn\rquote  have a grudge against the Gryffindor Quidditch team, could they?\rquote  said Hagrid anxiously. \lquote Firs\rquote  Katie, now Ron ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team,\rquote  said George.
\par \lquote Wood might\rquote ve done the Slytherins if he could\rquote ve got away with it,\rquote  said Fred fairly.
\par \lquote Well, I don\rquote t think it\rquote s Quidditch, but I think there\rquote s a con\-nection between the attacks,\rquote  said Hermione quietly.
\par \lquote How d\rquote you work that out?\rquote  asked Fred.
\par \lquote Well, for one thing, they both ought to have been fatal and weren\rquote t, although that was pure luck. And for another, neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed. Of course,\rquote 
 she added broodingly, \lquote that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way, because they don\rquote t seem to care how many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim.\rquote 
\par Before anybody could respond to this ominous pronounce\-ment, the dormitory doors opened again and Mr and Mrs Weasley hurried up the ward. They had done no more than satisfy themselves that Ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward: 
now Mrs Weasley seized hold of Harry and hugged him very tightly.
\par \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s told us how you saved him with the bezoar,\rquote  she sobbed. \lquote Oh, Harry, what can we say? You saved Ginny ... you saved Arthur ... now you\rquote ve saved Ron ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be ... I didn\rquote t ...\rquote  muttered Harry awkwardly.
\par \lquote Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think about it,\rquote  Mr Weasley said in a constricted voice. \lquote Well, all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your com
partment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.\rquote 
\par Harry could not think of any reply to this and was almost glad when Madam Pomfrey reminded them again that there were only supposed to be six visitors around Ron\rquote s bed; he and Hermione rose at once to leave and Hag
rid decided to go with them, leaving Ron with his family.
\par \lquote It\rquote s terrible,\rquote  growled Hagrid into his beard, as the three of them walked back along the corridor to the marble stair\-case. \lquote All this new security, an\rquote  kids are still gettin\rquote  hurt ... Dumbledore\rquote s
 worried sick ... he don\rquote  say much, but I can tell ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Hasn\rquote t he got any ideas, Hagrid?\rquote  asked Hermione desperately.
\par \lquote I \rquote spect he\rquote s got hundreds of ideas, brain like his,\rquote  said Hagrid staunchly. \lquote But he doesn\rquote  know who sent that necklace nor who put poison in that wine, or they\rquote d\rquote ve bin caught, wouldn\rquote 
 they? Wha\rquote  worries me,\rquote  said Hagrid, lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder (Harry, for good measure, checked the ceiling for Peeves), \lquote is how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein\rquote  attacked. Chamber o
\rquote  Secrets all over again, isn\rquote  it? There\rquote ll be panic, more parents takin\rquote  their kids outta school, an\rquote  nex\rquote  thing yeh know the board o\rquote  governors ...\rquote 
\par Hagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a long-haired woman drifted serenely past, then resumed in a hoarse whis\-per, \lquote ... the board o\rquote  governors\rquote ll be talkin\rquote  about shuttin\rquote  us up fer good.\rquote 
\par \lquote Surely not?\rquote  said Hermione, looking worried.
\par \lquote Gotta see it from their point o\rquote  view,\rquote  said Hagrid heavily. \lquote I mean, it\rquote s always bin a bit of a risk sendin\rquote  a kid ter Hogwarts, hasn\rquote  it? Yer expect accidents, don\rquote 
 yeh, with hundreds of under-age wizards all locked up tergether, but attempted murder, tha\rquote s diff\rquote rent. \rquote S no wonder Dumbledore\rquote s angry with Sn\emdash \rquote 
\par Hagrid stopped in his tracks, a familiar, guilty expression on what was visible of his face above his tangled black beard.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry quickly. \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s angry with Snape?\rquote 
\par \lquote I never said tha\rquote ,\rquote  said Hagrid, though his look of panic could not have been a bigger give-away. \lquote Look at the time, it\rquote s gettin\rquote  on fer midnight, I need ter \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hagrid, why is Dumbledore angry with Snape?\rquote  Harry asked loudly.
\par \lquote Shhhh!\rquote  said Hagrid, looking both nervous and angry. \lquote Don\rquote  shout stuff like that, Harry, d\rquote you wan\rquote  me ter lose me job? Mind, I don\rquote  suppose you\rquote d care, would yeh, not now you\rquote

\par \lquote Don\rquote t try and make me feel guilty, it won\rquote t work!\rquote  said Harry forcefully. \lquote What\rquote s Snape done?\rquote

\par \lquote Well?\rquote  Harry urged him, as Hagrid shuffled his enormous feet uneasily.
\par \lquote Well \endash  I jus\rquote  heard Snape sayin\rquote  Dumbledore took too much fer granted an\rquote  maybe he \endash  Snape \endash  didn\rquote  wan\rquote  ter do it any more \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Do what?\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno, Harry, it sounded like Snape was feelin\rquote  a bit overworked, tha\rquote s all \endash  anyway, Dumbledore told him flat out he\rquote d agreed ter do it an\rquote  that was all there was to it. Pretty firm with him. An\rquote 
 then he said summat abou\rquote  Snape makin\rquote  investigations in his house, in Slytherin. Well, there\rquote s nothin\rquote  strange abou\rquote  that!\rquote  Hagrid added hastily, as Harry and Hermione exchanged looks full of meaning. \lquote 
All the Heads o\rquote  House were asked ter look inter that necklace business \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, but Dumbledore\rquote s not having rows with the rest of them, is he?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Look,\rquote  Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands; there was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two, \lquote I know what yeh\rquote re like abou\rquote  Snape, Harry, an\rquote  I don\rquote  want yeh ter go readin
\rquote  more inter this than there is.\rquote 
\par \lquote Look out,\rquote  said Hermione tersely.
\par They turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus Filch looming over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner, hunchbacked, his jowls aquiver.
\par \lquote Oho!\rquote  he wheezed. \lquote Out of bed so late, this\rquote ll mean detention!\rquote 
\par \lquote No it won\rquote , Filch,\rquote  said Hagrid shortly. \lquote They\rquote re with me, aren\rquote  they?\rquote 
\par \lquote And what difference does that make?\rquote  asked Filch obnoxiously.
\par \lquote I\rquote m a ruddy teacher, aren\rquote  I, yeh sneakin\rquote  Squib!\rquote  said Hagrid, firing up at once.
\par There was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with fury; Mrs Norris had arrived, unseen, and was twisting herself sinuously around Filch\rquote s skinny ankles.
\par \lquote Get goin\rquote ,\rquote  said Hagrid out of the corner of his mouth.
\par Harry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione both hurried off, Hagrid and Filch\rquote

The Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be awoken, but swung forwards grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room. It did not seem that people k
new about Ron yet; Harry was very relieved, he had been interrogated enough that day. Hermione bade him goodnight and set off for the girls\rquote 
 dormitory. Harry, however, remained behind, taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers.

o Dumbledore had argued with Snape. In spite of all he had told Harry, in spite of his insistence that he trusted Snape completely, he had lost his temper with him ... he did not think that Snape had tried hard enough to investigate the Slytherins ... or,
 perhaps, to investigate a single Slytherin: Malfoy?
\par Was it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do any\-thing foolish, to take matters into his own hands, that he had pretended there was nothing in Harry\rquote s suspicions? That seemed likely. It might even b
e that Dumbledore did not want anything to distract Harry from their lessons, or from procur\-ing that memory from Slughorn. Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it right to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteen-year-olds ...
\par \lquote There you are, Potter!\rquote 
\par Ha
rry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the ready. He had been quite convinced that the common room was empty; he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise, suddenly, out of a distant chair. A closer look showed him that it was Cormac
 McLaggen.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve been waiting for you to come back,\rquote  said McLaggen, disregarding Harry\rquote s drawn wand. \lquote Must\rquote ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didn\rquote t look like he\rquote 
ll be fit for next week\rquote s match.\rquote 
\par It took Harry a few moments to realise what McLaggen was talking about.
\par \lquote Oh ... right ... Quidditch,\rquote  he said, putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair. \lquote Yeah ... he might not make it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, then, I\rquote ll be playing Keeper, won\rquote t I?\rquote  said McLaggen.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Yeah, I suppose so ...\rquote 
\par He could not think of an argument against it; after all, McLaggen had certainly performed second best in the trials.
\par \lquote Excellent,\rquote  said McLaggen in a satisfied voice. \lquote So when\rquote s practice?\rquote 
\par \lquote What? Oh ... there\rquote s one tomorrow evening.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good. Listen, Potter, we should have a talk beforehand. I\rquote ve got some ideas on strategy you might find useful.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry unenthusiastically. \lquote Well, I\rquote ll hear them tomorrow, then. I\rquote m pretty tired now ... see you ...\rquote 
\par The news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day, but it did not cause the sensation that Katie\rquote s attack had done. People seemed to think that it might have been an accident, given that he had been in the Potion master\rquote 
s room at the time, and that as he had been given an antidote immediately there was no real harm done. In fact, the Gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, for many of them wanted to see Zacharia
s Smith, who played Chaser on the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against Slytherin.
\par Harry, however, had never been less interested in Quid\-ditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. Still checking the Marauder\rquote 
s Map whenever he got a chance, he sometimes made detours to wherever Malfoy happened to be, but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary. And still there were those inexplicable times when Malfoy simply vanished from the map ...
\par But Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem, what with Quidditch practice, homework, and the fact that he was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown.
\par He could not decide which of them was more annoying. McLaggen kept up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper for the team than Ron, and that now Harry was seeing him play regularly he would surely com
e around to this way of thinking, too; he was also keen to criticise the other players and provide Harry with detailed training schemes, so that more than once Harry was forced to remind him who was Captain.
\par Meanwhile, Lavender kept sidling up to Harry to discuss Ron, which Harry found almost more wearing than McLag\-gen\rquote s Quidditch lectures. At first, Lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had thought to tell her that Ron was in the hospital wing 
\endash  \lquote I mean, I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 am }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 his girlfriend!\rquote  \endash 
 but unfortunately she had now decided to forgive Harry this lapse of memory and was keen to have lots of in-depth chats with him about Ron\rquote s feelings, a most uncomfortable experience that Harry would have happily forgone.
\par \lquote Look, why don\rquote t you talk to Ron about all this?\rquote  Harry 
asked, after a particularly long interrogation from Lavender that took in everything from precisely what Ron had said about her new dress robes to whether or not Harry thought that Ron considered his relationship with Lavender to be \lquote serious
\rquote .
\par \lquote Well, I would, but he\rquote s always asleep when I go and see him!\rquote  said Lavender fretfully.
\par \lquote Is he?\rquote  said Harry, surprised, for he had found Ron per\-fectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing, both highly interested in the news of Dumbledore and Snape\rquote s row and keen to abuse McLaggen as much as possible.

\par \lquote Is Hermione Granger still visiting him?\rquote  Lavender demanded suddenly.
\par \lquote Yeah, I think so. Well, they\rquote re friends, aren\rquote t they?\rquote  said Harry uncomfortably.
\par \lquote Friends, don\rquote t make me laugh,\rquote  said Lavender scornfully. \lquote She didn\rquote t talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he\rquote s all }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 interesting }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Would you call getting poisoned being interesting?\rquote  asked Harry. \lquote Anyway \endash  sorry, got to go \endash  there\rquote s McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch,\rquote 
 said Harry hurriedly, and he dashed sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the short cut that would take him off to Potions where, thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could follow him.
\par On the morning of the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff Harry dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the pitch. Ron was very agitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let him go down to watch the match, feeling it would overexcite him.
\par \lquote So how\rquote s McLaggen shaping up?\rquote  he asked Harry ner\-vously, apparently forgetting that he had already asked the same question twice.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve told you,\rquote  said Harry patiently, \lquote he could be world class and I wouldn\rquote t want to keep him. He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do, he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us. I can
\rquote t wait to be shot of him. And speaking of getting shot of people,\rquote  Harry added, getting to his feet and picking up his Firebolt, \lquote will you stop pretending to be asleep when Lavender comes to see you? She\rquote 
s driving me mad as well.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Ron, looking sheepish. \lquote Yeah. All right.\rquote 
\par \lquote If you don\rquote t want to go out with her any more, just tell her,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Yeah ... well ... it\rquote s not that easy, is it?\rquote  said Ron. He paused. \lquote Hermione going to look in before the match?\rquote  he added casually.
\par \lquote No, she\rquote s already gone down to the pitch with Ginny.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Ron, looking rather glum. \lquote Right. Well, good luck. Hope you hammer McLag\emdash  I mean, Smith.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll try,\rquote  said Harry, shouldering his broom. \lquote See you after the match.\rquote 
\par He hurried down through the deserted corridors; the whole school was outside, either already seated in the stadium or heading down towards it. He was looking out of the windows he passed, trying to gauge how much w
ind they were facing, when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw Malfoy walking towards him, accompanied by two girls, both of whom looked sulky and resentful.
\par Malfoy stopped short at the sight of Harry, then gave a short, humourless laugh and continued walking.
\par \lquote Where\rquote re you going?\rquote  Harry demanded.
\par \lquote Yeah, I\rquote m really going to tell you, because it\rquote s your busi\-ness, Potter,\rquote  sneered Malfoy. \lquote You\rquote d better hurry up, they\rquote ll be waiting for the Chosen Captain \endash  the Boy Who Scored \endash 
 whatever they call you these days.\rquote 
\par One of the girls gave an unwilling giggle. Harry stared at her. She blushed. Malfoy pushed past Harry and she and her friend followed at a trot, turning the corner and vanishing from view.
\par Harry stood rooted on the spot and watched them dis\-appear. This was infuriating; he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was Malfoy, skulking off while the rest of the school was absent: Harry\rquote 
s best chance yet of discovering what Malfoy was up to. The silent seconds trickled past, and Harry remained where he was, frozen, gazing at the place where Malfoy had vanished ...
\par \lquote Where have you been?\rquote  demanded Ginny, as Harry sprinted into the changing room. The whole team was changed and ready; Coote and Peakes, the Beaters, were both hitting their clubs nervously against their legs.
\par \lquote I met Malfoy,\rquote  Harry told her quietly, as he pulled his scarlet robes over his head.
\par \lquote So?\rquote 
\par \lquote So I wanted to know how come he\rquote s up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Does it matter right now?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote m not likely to find out, am I?\rquote  said Harry, seizing his Firebolt and pushing his glasses straight. \lquote Come on, then!\rquote 
\par And without another word, he marched out on to the pitch to deafening cheers and boos. There was little wind; the clouds were patchy; every now and then there were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight.
\par \lquote Tricky conditions!\rquote  McLaggen said bracingly to the team. \lquote Coote, Peakes, you\rquote ll want to fly out of the sun, so they don\rquote t see you coming \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m the Captain, McLaggen, shut up giving them instruc\-tions,\rquote  said Harry angrily. \lquote Just get up by the goalposts!\rquote 
\par Once McLaggen had marched off, Harry turned to Coote and Peakes.
\par \lquote Make sure you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 do }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 fly out of the sun,\rquote  he told them grudgingly.
\par He shook hands with the Hufflepuff Captain, and then, on Madam Hooch\rquote s whistle, kicked off and rose into the air, higher than the rest of his team, streaking around the pitch in search of the Snitc
h. If he could catch it good and early, there might be a chance he could get back up to the castle, seize the Marauder\rquote s Map and find out what Malfoy was doing ...
\par \lquote And that\rquote s Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle,\rquote  said a dreamy voice, echoing over the grounds. \lquote He did the commen\-tary last time, of course, and Ginny Weasley flew into him, I think probably on purpose \endash 
 it looked like it. Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor, I expect he regrets that now he\rquote s playing them \endash  oh, look, he\rquote s lost the Quaffle, Ginny took it from him, I do like her, she\rquote s very nice ...\rquote 
\par Harry stared down at the commentator\rquote s podium. Surely, nobody in their right mind would have let Luna Lovegood commentate? But even from above there was no mistaking that long, dirty-blonde h
air, or the necklace of Butterbeer corks ... Beside Luna, Professor McGonagall was looking slightly uncomfortable, as though she was indeed having sec\-ond thoughts about this appointment.
\par \lquote ... but now that big Hufflepuff player\rquote s got the Quaffle from her, I can\rquote t remember his name, it\rquote s something like Bibble \endash  no, Buggins \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s Cadwallader!\rquote  said Professor McGonagall loudly from beside Luna. The crowd laughed.
\par Harry stared around for the Snitch; there was no sign of it. Moments later, Cadwallader scored.
 McLaggen had been shouting criticism at Ginny for allowing the Quaffle out of her possession, with the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear.
\par \lquote McLaggen, will you pay attention to what you\rquote re supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone!\rquote  bellowed Harry, wheeling round to face his Keeper.
\par \lquote You\rquote re not setting a great example!\rquote  McLaggen shouted back, red-faced and furious.
\par \lquote And Harry Potter\rquote s now having an argument with his Keeper,\rquote  said Luna serenely, while both Hufflepuffs and Slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered. \lquote I don\rquote t think that\rquote 
ll help him find the Snitch, but maybe it\rquote s a clever ruse ...\rquote 
\par Swearing angrily, Harry spun round and set off around the pitch again, scanning the skies for some sign of the tiny winged golden ball.
\par Ginny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the red-and-gold-clad supporters below something to cheer about. Then Cadwallader scored again, making things level, but Luna did not seem to have noticed; she appeared singularly u
ninterested in such mundane things as the score, and kept attempting to draw the crowd\rquote 
s attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that Zacharias Smith, who had so far failed to maintain possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was suffering from some\-thing called \lquote Loser\rquote s Lurgy
\rquote .
\par \lquote Seventy\endash forty to Hufflepuff!\rquote  barked Professor McGonagall into Luna\rquote s megaphone.
\par \lquote Is it, already?\rquote  said Luna vaguely. \lquote Oh, look! The Gryffindor Keeper\rquote s got hold of one of the Beater\rquote s bats.\rquote 
\par Harry spun round in midair. Sure enough, McLaggen, for reasons best known to himself, had pulled Peakes\rquote s bat from him and appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a Bludger towards an oncoming Cadwallader.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Will you give him back his hat and get back to the goalposts!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
roared Harry, pelting towards McLaggen just as McLaggen took a ferocious swipe at the Bludger and mis-hit it.
\par A blinding, sickening pain ... a flash of light ... distant screams ... and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel ...
\par And the next thing Harry knew, he was lying in a remark\-
ably warm and comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light on to a shadowy ceiling. He raised his head awkwardly. There on his left was a familiar-looking, freckly, red-haired person.
\par \lquote Nice of you to drop in,\rquote  said Ron, grinning.
\par Harry blinked and looked around. Of course: he was in the hospital wing. The sky outside was indigo streaked with crimson. The match must have finished hours ago ... as had any hope of cornering Malfoy. Harry\rquote 
s head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages.
\par \lquote What happened?\rquote 
\par \lquote Cracked skull,\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey, bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows. \lquote Nothing to worry about, I mended it at once, but I\rquote m keeping you in overnight. You shouldn\rquote t overexert yourself for a few hours.
\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t want to stay here overnight,\rquote  said Harry angrily, sitting up and throwing back his covers, \lquote I want to find McLaggen and kill him.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m afraid that would come under the heading of \'93over\-exertion\'94,\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey, pushing him firmly back on to the bed and raising her wand in a threatening manner. \lquote 
You will stay here until I discharge you, Potter, or I shall call the Headmaster.\rquote 
\par She bustled back into her office and Harry sank back into his pillows, fuming.
\par \lquote D\rquote you know how much we lost by?\rquote  he asked Ron through clenched teeth.
\par \lquote Well, yeah I do,\rquote  said Ron apologetically. \lquote Final score was three hundred and twenty to sixty.\rquote 
\par \lquote Brilliant,\rquote  said Harry savagely. \lquote Really brilliant! When I get hold of McLaggen \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t want to get hold of him, he\rquote s the size of a troll,\rquote  said Ron reasonably. \lquote Personally I think there\rquote s a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Prince\rquote 
s. Anyway, the rest of the team might\rquote ve dealt with him before you get out of here, they\rquote re not happy ...\rquote 
\par There was a note of badly suppressed glee in Ron\rquote s voice; Harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled that McLaggen had messed up so
 badly. Harry lay there, staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling, his recently mended skull not hurting, precisely, but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging.
\par \lquote I could hear the match commentary from here,\rquote  said Ron, his voice now shaking with laughter. \lquote I hope Luna always commentates from now on ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699

\par But Harry was still too angry to see much humour in the situation, and after a while Ron\rquote s snorts subsided.
\par \lquote Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious,\rquote  he said, after a long pause, and Harry\rquote s imagination zoomed into overdrive, rapidly constructing a scene in which Ginny, weep\-
ing over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing ... \lquote She reckons you only just arrived in time for the match. How come? You left here early enough.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh ...\rquote  said Harry, as the scene in his mind\rquote s eye imploded. \lquote Yeah ... well, I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who didn\rquote t look like they wanted to be with him, and that\rquote s the second time he\rquote 
s made sure he isn\rquote t down on the Quid\-ditch pitch with the rest of the school. He skipped the last match too, remember?\rquote  Harry sighed. \lquote Wish I\rquote d followed him now, the match was such a fiasco ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be stupid,\rquote  said Ron sharply. \lquote You couldn\rquote t have missed a Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy, you\rquote re the Captain!\rquote 
\par \lquote I want to know what he\rquote s up to,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote And don\rquote t tell me it\rquote s all in my head, not after what I overheard between him and Snape \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I never said it was all in your head,\rquote  said Ron, hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning at Harry, \lquote but there\rquote s no rule saying only one person at a time can be plot\-ting anything in this place! You\rquote 
re getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry. I mean, thinking about missing a match just to follow him ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I want to catch him at it!\rquote  said Harry in frustration. \lquote I mean, where\rquote s he going when he disappears off the map?\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno ... Hogsmeade?\rquote  suggested Ron, yawning.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve never seen him going along any of the secret passage\-ways on the map. I thought they were being watched now, anyway?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, then, I dunno,\rquote  said Ron.
\par Silence fell between them. Harry stared up at the circle of lamplight above him, thinking ...
\par If only he had Rufus Scrimgeour\rquote s power, he would have been ab
le to set a tail upon Malfoy, but unfortunately Harry did not have an office full of Aurors at his command ... he thought fleetingly of trying to set something up with the DA, but there again was the problem that people would be missed from lessons; most 
of them, after all, still had full timetables ...
\par There was a low, rumbling snore from Ron\rquote s bed. After a while Madam Pomfrey came out of her office, this time wear\-ing a thick dressing-gown. It was easiest to feign sleep; Harry rolled over on to his side and listened to all the curtains clos\-
ing themselves as she waved her wand. The lamps dimmed, and she returned to her office; he heard the door click behind her, and knew that she was off to bed.
\par This was, Harry reflected in the darkness, the third time tha
t he had been brought to the hospital wing because of a Quidditch injury. Last time he had fallen off his broom due to the presence of Dementors around the pitch, and the time before that, all the bones had been removed from his arm by the incurably inept
 Professor Lockhart ... that had been his most painful injury by far ... he remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night, a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the \endash 
\par Harry sat bolt upright, his heart pounding, his bandage turban askew. He had the solution at last: there }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 was}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699  a way to have Malfoy followed \endash  how could he have forgotten, why hadn\rquote t he thought of it before?
\par But the question was, how to call him? What did you do?
\par Quietly, tentatively, Harry spoke into the darkness.
\par \lquote Kreacher?\rquote 
\par There was a very loud }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 crack }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room. Ron awoke with a yelp.
\par \lquote What\rquote s going \endash ?\rquote 
\par Harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfrey\rquote s office and muttered }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Muffliato!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 so that she would not come running. Then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at what was going on.
\par Two house-elves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory, one wearing a shrunken m
aroon jumper and several woolly hats, the other, a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth. Then there was another loud bang, and Peeves the poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves.
\par \lquote I was watching that, Potty!\rquote  he told Harry indignantly, pointing at the fight below, before letting out a loud cackle. \lquote Look at the ickle creatures squabbling, bitey bitey, punchy punchy \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby, no he won\rquote t, or Dobby will shut Kreacher\rquote s mouth for him!\rquote  cried Dobby in a high-pitched voice.
\par \lquote \endash  kicky, scratchy!\rquote  cried Peeves happily, now pelting bits of chalk at the elves to enrage them further. \lquote Tweaky, pokey!\rquote 
\par \lquote Kreacher will say what he likes about his master, oh yes, and what a master he is, filthy friend of Mudbloods, oh, what would poor Kreacher\rquote s mistress say \endash ?\rquote 
\par Exactly what Kreacher\rquote s mistress would have said they did not find out, for at that moment Dobby sank his knobbly little fist into Kreacher\rquote s mouth and knocked out half of his teeth. H
arry and Ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart, though they continued to try to kick and punch each other, egged on by Peeves, who swooped around the lamp squealing, \lquote 
Stick your fingers up his nosey, draw his cork and pull his earsies \endash \rquote 
\par Harry aimed his wand at Peeves and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Langlock!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
Peeves clutched at his throat, gulped, then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak, owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth.
\par \lquote Nice one,\rquote  said Ron appreciatively, lifting Dobby into the air so that his flailing limbs no longer made contact with Kreacher. \lquote That was another Prince hex, wasn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, twisting Kreacher\rquote s wizened arm into a half-nelson. \lquote Right \endash  I\rquote m forbidding you to fight each other! Well, Kreacher, you\rquote re forbidden to fight Dobby. Dobby, I know I\rquote 
m not allowed to give you orders \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Dobby is a free house-elf and he can obey anyone he likes and Dobby will do whatever Harry Potter wants him to do!\rquote  said Dobby, tears now streaming down his shrivelled little face on to his jumper.
\par \lquote OK, then,\rquote  said Harry and he and Ron both released the elves, who fell to the floor, but did not continue fighting.
\par \lquote Master called me?\rquote  croaked Kreacher, sinking into a bow even as he gave Harry a look that plainly wished him a pain\-ful death.
\par \lquote Yeah, I did,\rquote  said Harry, glancing towards Madam Pomfrey\rquote s office door to check that the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Muffliato }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 spell was still working; there was no sign that she had heard any of the commotion. \lquote I\rquote ve got a job for you.\rquote 
\par \lquote Kreacher will do whatever Master wants,\rquote  said Kreacher, sinking so low that his lips almost touched his gnarled toes, \lquote because Kreacher has no choice, but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a Master, yes \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Dobby will do it, Harry Potter!\rquote  squeaked Dobby, his tennis-ball-sized eyes still swimming with tears. \lquote Dobby would be honoured to help Harry Potter!\rquote 
\par \lquote Come to think of it, it would be good to have both of you,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote OK, then ... I want you to tail Draco Malfoy.\rquote 
\par Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on Ron\rquote s face, Harry went on, \lquote I want to know where he\rquote s going, who he\rquote s meeting and what he\rquote s doing. I want you to follow him around the clock.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Harry Potter!\rquote  said Dobby at once, his great eyes shin\-ing with excitement. \lquote And if Dobby does it wrong, Dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower, Harry Potter!\rquote 
\par \lquote There won\rquote t be any need for that,\rquote  said Harry hastily.
\par \lquote Master wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys?\rquote  croaked Kreacher. \lquote Master wants me to spy upon the pure-blood great-nephew of my old mistress?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s the one,\rquote  said Harry, foreseeing a great danger and determining to prevent it immediately. \lquote And you\rquote re forbidden to tip him off, Kreacher, or to show him what you\rquote re up to, or to talk to
 him at all, or to write him messages, or ... or to contact him in any way. Got it?\rquote 
\par He thought he could see Kreacher struggling to see a loop\-hole in the instructions he had just been given, and waited. After a moment or two, and to Harry\rquote s great satisfaction, Kreacher bowed deeply again and said, with bitter resentment, \lquote 
Master thinks of everything and Kreacher must obey him even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the Malfoy boy, oh yes ...\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s settled, then,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I\rquote ll want regular reports, but make sure I\rquote m not surrounded by people when you turn up. Ron and Hermione are OK. And don\rquote t tell anyone what you\rquote 
re doing. Just stick to Malfoy like a couple of wart plasters.\rquote

Harry and Ron left the hospital wing first thing on Monday morning, restored to full health by the ministrations of Madam Pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poisoned, the best of which was that Hermione was friends w
ith Ron again. Hermione even escorted them down to breakfast, bringing with her the news that Ginny had argued with Dean. The drowsing creature in Harry\rquote s chest suddenly raised its head, sniffing the air hopefully.

g to sound casual as they turned into a seventh-floor corridor which was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus. She looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth-years and dropped the heavy brass 
scales she was carrying.
\par \lquote It\rquote s all right!\rquote  said Hermione kindly, hurrying forwards to help her. \lquote Here ...\rquote  She tapped the broken scales with her wand and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par The girl did not say thank you, but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight; Ron glanced back at her.
\par \lquote I swear they\rquote re getting smaller,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote Never mind her,\rquote  said Harry, a little impatiently. \lquote What did Ginny and Dean row about, Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludger at you,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote It must\rquote ve looked funny,\rquote  said Ron reasonably.
\par \lquote It didn\rquote t look funny at all!\rquote  said Hermione hotly. \lquote It looked terrible, and if Coote and Peakes hadn\rquote t caught Harry he could have been very badly hurt!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, well, there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it,\rquote  said Harry, still trying to sound casual. \lquote Or are they still together?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, they are \endash  but why are you so interested?\rquote  asked Hermione, giving Harry a sharp look.
\par \lquote I just don\rquote t want my Quidditch team messed up again!\rquote  he said hastily, but Hermione continued to look sus\-picious, and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called, \lquote Harry!\rquote 
, giving him an excuse to turn his back on her.
\par \lquote Oh, hi, Luna.\rquote 
\par \lquote I went to the hospital wing to find you,\rquote  said Luna, rum\-maging in her bag. \lquote But they said you\rquote d left ...\rquote 
\par She thrust what appeared to be a green onion, a large spotted toadstool and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into Ron\rquote s hands, finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to Harry.
\par \lquote ... I\rquote ve been told to give you this.\rquote 
\par It was a small roll of parchment, which Harry recognised at once as another invitation to a lesson with Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Tonight,\rquote  he told Ron and Hermione, once he had unrolled it.
\par \lquote Nice commentary last match!\rquote  said Ron to Luna, as she took back the green onion, the toadstool and the cat litter. Luna smiled vaguely.
\par \lquote You\rquote re making fun of me, aren\rquote t you?\rquote  she said. \lquote Everyone says I was dreadful.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I\rquote m serious!\rquote  said Ron earnestly. \lquote I can\rquote t remember enjoying commentary more! What is this, by the way?\rquote  he added, holding the onionlike object up to eye-level.
\par \lquote Oh, it\rquote s a Gurdyroot,\rquote  she said, stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag. \lquote You can keep it if you like, I\rquote ve got a few of them. They\rquote re really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies.
\rquote 
\par And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the Gurdyroot.
\par \lquote You know, she\rquote s grown on me, Luna,\rquote  he said, as they set off again for the Great Hall. \lquote I know she\rquote s insane, but it\rquote s in a good \endash \rquote 
\par He stopped talking very suddenly. Lavender Brown was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  said Ron nervously.
\par \lquote C\rquote mon,\rquote  Harry muttered to Hermione, and they sped past, though not before they had heard Lavender say, \lquote Why didn\rquote t you tell me you were getting out today? And why was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 she }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 with you?\rquote 
\par Ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later, and though he sat with Lavender, Harry did not see them exchange a wor
d all the time they were together. Hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice Harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that evening in the c
ommon room she even consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) Harry\rquote s Herbology essay, something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to that point, because she had known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work.
\par \lquote Thanks a lot, Hermione,\rquote  said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o\rquote clock. \lquote Listen, I\rquote ve got to hurry or I\rquote ll be late for Dumbledore ...\rquote 

\par She did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way. Grinning, Harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the Head\-master\rquote s office. The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee \'e9
clairs and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight.
\par \lquote Enter,\rquote  called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from inside. There stood Professor Trelawney.
\par \lquote Aha!\rquote  she cried, pointing dramatically at Harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles. \lquote So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office, Dumbledore!\rquote 
\par \lquote My dear Sybill,\rquote  said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice, \lquote there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but Harry does have an appointment and I really don\rquote t think there is any more to be said 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Very well,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded voice. \lquote If you will not banish the usurping nag, so be it ... perhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated ...\rquote 
\par She pushed past Harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase; they heard her stumble halfway down and Harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls.
\par \lquote Please close the door and sit down, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore, sounding rather tired.
\par Harry obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in front of Dumbledore\rquote s desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more, as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory.
\par \lquote Professor Trelawney still isn\rquote t happy Firenze is teaching, then?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself. I cannot ask Firenze to return to the Forest, where he is now an outcast, nor c
an I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. Between ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle. She does not know \endash  and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her \endash 
 that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort, you see.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, \lquote But never mind my staff problems. We have much more important matters to discuss. Firstly \endash  have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  said Harry, brought up short. What with Appari
tion lessons and Quidditch and Ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what Draco Malfoy was up to, Harry had almost forgotten about the memory Dumbledore had asked him to extract from Professor Slughorn ... 
\lquote Well, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn\rquote t give it to me.\rquote 
\par There was a little silence.
\par \lquote I see,\rquote  said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed. \lquote 
And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenu\-ity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. His single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. \lquote 
Well ... the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote And did that work?\rquote  asked Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Well, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash 
 which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in danger. Once it became clear that Mr Weasley was going to make a full recovery, however, I would have hoped that 
you returned to the task I set you. I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is. Indeed, I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it.\rquote 
\par A hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harry\rquote 
s head all the way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything.
\par \lquote Sir,\rquote  he said, a little desperately, \lquote it isn\rquote t that I wasn\rquote t bothered or anything, I\rquote ve just had other \endash  other things ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Other things on your mind,\rquote  Dumbledore finished the sentence for him. \lquote I see.\rquote 
\par Silence fell between them again, the most uncomfortable silence Harry had ever experienced with Dumbledore; it seemed to go on and on, punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of Armando Dippet over Dumbledore\rquote 
s head. Harry felt strangely diminished, as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room.
\par When he could stand it no longer he said, \lquote Professor Dumbledore, I\rquote m really sorry. I should have done more ... I should have realised you wouldn\rquote t have asked me to do it if it wasn\rquote t really important.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you for saying that, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly. \lquote May I hope, then, that you will give this matter higher priority from now on? There will be little point our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory.\rquote 

\par \lquote I\rquote ll do it, sir, I\rquote ll get it from him,\rquote  Harry said earnestly.
\par \lquote Then we shall say no more about it just now,\rquote  said Dumbledore more kindly, \lquote but continue with our story where we left off. You remember where that was?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, sir,\rquote  said Harry quickly. \lquote Voldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his uncle Morfin did it. Then he went back to Hogwarts and he asked ... he asked Professor Slughorn about Horcruxes,\rquote 
 he mumbled shamefacedly.
\par \lquote Very good,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Now, you will remember, I hope, that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, sir.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen?\rquote 
\par Harry nodded.
\par \lquote But now, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote 
now things become murkier and stranger. If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle, it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Voldemort. In fact, I doubt whether there is a s
oul alive, apart from himself, who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts. However, I have two last memories that I would like to share with you.\rquote 
 Dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the Pensieve. \lquote I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely.\rquote 
\par The idea that Dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made Harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the Horcrux
 memory, and he shifted guiltily in his seat as Dumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it.
\par \lquote I hope you are not tired of diving into other people\rquote s memories, for they are curious recollections, these two,\rquote  he said. \lquote This fi
rst one came from a very old house-elf by the name of Hokey. Before we see what Hokey witnessed, I must quickly recount how Lord Voldemort left Hogwarts.
\par \lquote He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have expected, top grades in every ex
amination he had taken. All around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, pre\-
fect, Head Boy, winner of the Special Award for Services to t
he School. I know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort 
was working at Borgin and Burkes.\rquote 
\par \lquote At Borgin and Burkes?\rquote  Harry repeated, stunned.
\par \lquote At Borgin and Burkes,\rquote  repeated Dumbledore calmly. \lquote I think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered Hokey\rquote s memory. But this was not Voldemort\rquote 
s first choice of job. Hardly anyone knew of it at the time \endash  I was one of the few in whom the then Headmaster confided \endash  but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher.\rquote 

\par \lquote He wanted to stay here? Why?\rquote  asked Harry, more amazed still.
\par \lquote I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Firstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever bee
n to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and only place he had felt at home.\rquote 
\par Harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for this was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts, too.
\par \lquote Secondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient 
magic. Undoubtedly Voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place, but he may have felt that there were still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap.
\par \lquote And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have ha
d great power and influence over young witches and wizards. Perhaps he had gained the idea from Professor Slughorn, the teacher with whom he was on best terms, who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play. I do not imagine for an instant
 that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground, and a place where he might begin to build himself an army.\rquote 
\par \lquote But he didn\rquote t get the job, sir?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he still wished to teach.\rquote 
\par \lquote How did you feel about that, sir?\rquote  asked Harry hesitantly.
\par \lquote Deeply uneasy,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I had advised Armando against the appointment \endash  I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty \endash 
 but I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this school, and especially not in a position of power.\rquote 
\par \lquote Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach?\rquote 
\par Somehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it.
\par \lquote Defence Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old Professor by the name of Galatea Merry\-thought, who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years.
\par \lquote So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that, working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. Pol
ite and handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specialises, as you know, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful properties. Voldemort was sent to persuade people to 
part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll bet he was,\rquote  said Harry, unable to contain himself.
\par \lquote Well, quite,\rquote  said Dumbledore, with a faint smile. \lquote And now it is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as he did so, \lquote After you, Harry.\rquote 
\par Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them. He tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elabor\-
ate ginger wig and
 a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her, giving her the look of a melting iced cake. She was looking into a small jewelled mirror and dabbing rouge on to her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff, while the tiniest and oldest h
ouse-elf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers.
\par \lquote Hurry up, Hokey!\rquote  said Hepzibah imperiously. \lquote He said he\rquote d come at four, it\rquote s only a couple of minutes to and he\rquote s never been late yet!\rquote 
\par She tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf straight\-ened up. The top of the elf\rquote s head barely reached the seat of Hepzibah\rquote s chair and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga.

\par \lquote How do I look?\rquote  said Hepzibah, turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror.
\par \lquote Lovely, madam,\rquote  squeaked Hokey.
\par Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokey\rquote s contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion.
\par A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped.
\par \lquote Quick, quick, he\rquote s here, Hokey!\rquote  cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room, which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their 
way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things: there were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes, cases full of gold-embossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial globes and many flourishing pot plants in brass containers: in fact, the room
 looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory.
\par The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognising as Voldemort. He was plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was 
a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him: he looked more handsome than ever. He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over 
Hepzibah\rquote s fat little hand, brush\-ing it with his lips.
\par \lquote I brought you flowers,\rquote  he said quietly, producing a bunch of roses from nowhere.
\par \lquote You naughty boy, you shouldn\rquote t have!\rquote  squealed old Hepzibah, though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table. \lquote You do spoil this old lady, Tom ... sit down, sit down ... where\rquote 
s Hokey ... ah ...\rquote 
\par The house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes, which she set at her mistress\rquote s elbow.
\par \lquote Help yourself, Tom,\rquote  said Hepzibah, \lquote I know how you love my cakes. Now, how are you? You look pale. They overwork you at that shop, I\rquote ve said it a hundred times ...\rquote 
\par Voldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered.
\par \lquote Well, what\rquote s your excuse for visiting this time?\rquote  she asked, batting her lashes.
\par \lquote Mr Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made armour,\rquote  said Voldemort. \lquote Five hundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than fair \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Now, now, not so fast, or I\rquote ll think you\rquote re only here for my trinkets!\rquote  pouted Hepzibah.
\par \lquote I am ordered here because of them,\rquote  said Voldemort quietly. \lquote I am only a poor assistant, madam, who must do as he is told. Mr Burke wishes me to enquire \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, Mr Burke, phooey!\rquote  said Hepzibah, waving a little hand. \lquote I\rquote ve something to show you that I\rquote ve never shown Mr Burke! Can you keep a secret, Tom? Will you promise you won\rquote t tell Mr Burke I\rquote ve got it? He
\rquote d never let me rest if he knew I\rquote d shown it to you, and I\rquote m not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone! But you, Tom, you\rquote ll appreciate it for its history, not how many Galleons you can get for it ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote d be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,\rquote  said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle.
\par \lquote I had Hokey bring it out for me ... Hokey, where are you? I want to show Mr Riddle our }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 finest }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 treasure ... in fact, bring both, while you\rquote re at it ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Here, madam,\rquote  squeaked the house-elf, and Harry saw two leather boxes, one on top of the other, moving across the room as if of their own volition, thou
gh he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables, pouffes and footstools.
\par \lquote Now,\rquote  said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from the elf, laying them in her lap and preparing to open the topmost one, \lquote I think you\rquote ll like this, Tom ... oh, if my family knew I was showing you ... they can\rquote 
t wait to get their hands on this!\rquote 
\par She opened the lid. Harry edged forwards a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles.
\par \lquote I wonder whether you know what it is, Tom? Pick it up, have a good look!\rquote 
 whispered Hepzibah, and Voldemort stretched out a long-fingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings. Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes. His greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibah\rquote 
s face, except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon Voldemort\rquote s handsome features.
\par \lquote A badger,\rquote  murmured Voldemort, examining the engraving upon the cup. \lquote Then this was ...?\rquote 
\par \lquote Helga Hufflepuff\rquote s, as you very well know, you clever boy!\rquote  said Hepzibah, leaning forwards with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek. \lquote Didn\rquote 
t I tell you I was distantly descended? This has been handed down in the family for years and years. Lovely, isn\rquote t it? And all sorts of powers it\rquote s supposed to possess, too, but I haven\rquote 
t tested them thoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here ...\rquote 
\par She hooked the cup back off Voldemort\rquote s long forefinger and restored it gently to its box, too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemort\rquote s face as the cup was taken away.
\par \lquote Now then,\rquote  said Hepzibah happily, \lquote where\rquote s Hokey? Oh yes, there you are \endash  take that away now, Hokey \endash \rquote 
\par The elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap.
\par \lquote I think you\rquote ll like this even more, Tom,\rquote  she whispered. \lquote Lean in a little, dear boy, so you can see ... of course, Burke knows I\rquote ve got this one, I bought it from him, and I daresay he\rquote 
d love to get it back when I\rquote m gone ...\rquote 
\par She slid back the fine, filigree clasp and flipped open the box. There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket.
\par Voldemort reached out his hand without invitation this time and held it up to the light, staring at it.
\par \lquote Slytherin\rquote s mark,\rquote  he said quietly, as the light played upon an ornate, serpentine S.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right!\rquote  said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket, transfixed. \lquote I had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldn\rquote 
t let it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a ragged-looking woman who seemed to have stolen it, but had no idea of its true value \endash \rquote 
\par There was no mistaking it this time: Voldemort\rquote s eyes flashed scarlet at her words and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the locket\rquote s chain.
\par \lquote \endash  I daresay Burke paid her a pittance, but there you are ... pretty, isn\rquote t it? And again, all kinds of powers attributed to it, though I just keep it nice and safe ...\rquote 
\par She reached out to take the locket back. For a moment Harry thought Voldemort was not going to let go of it, but then it had slid through his fingers and was back on its red velvet cushion.
\par \lquote So there you are, Tom, dear, and I hope you enjoyed that!\rquote 
\par She looked him full in the face and, for the first time, Harry saw her foolish smile falter.
\par \lquote Are you all right, dear?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yes,\rquote  said Voldemort quietly. \lquote Yes, I\rquote m very well ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I thought \endash  but a trick of the light, I suppose \endash \rquote  said Hepzibah, looking unnerved, and Harry guessed that she, too, had seen the momentary red gleam in Voldemort\rquote s eyes. \lquote 
Here, Hokey, take these away and lock them up again ... the usual enchantments ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Time to leave, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly, and as the little elf bobbed away bearing the boxes, Dumbledore grasped Harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to Dumbledore\rquote s office.

\par \lquote Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,\rquote  said Dumbledore, resuming his seat and indicating that Harry should do the same. \lquote Hokey the house-elf was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her mistress\rquote 
s evening cocoa by accident.\rquote 
\par \lquote No way!\rquote  said Harry angrily.
\par \lquote I see we are of one mind,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Certainly, there are many similarities between this death and that of the Riddles. In both cases, somebody else took the blame, some\-one who had a clear memory of having caused the death 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hokey confessed?\rquote 
\par \lquote She remembered putting something in her mistress\rquote s cocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal and little-known poison,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote It was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and confused 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Voldemort modified her memory, just like he did with Morfin!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, that is my conclusion, too,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote And, just as with Morfin, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  because she was a house-elf,\rquote  said Harry. He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W.
\par \lquote Precisely,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote 
She was old, she admitted to having tampered with the drink and nobody at the Ministry bothered to enquire further. As in the case of Morfin, by the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory, her life was almost over \endash  but her
 memory, of course, proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket.
\par \lquote By the time Hokey was convicted, Hepzibah\rquote s family had realised that two of her greatest treasures were missing. It took them a while to be sure of t
his, for she had many hiding places, having always guarded her collection most jealously. But before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes, the young man who had visited H
e
pzibah so regularly and charmed her so well, had resigned his post and vanished. His superiors had no idea where he had gone; they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance. And that was the last that was seen or heard of Tom Riddle for a very long
 time.
\par \lquote Now,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote if you don\rquote 
t mind, Harry, I want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story. Voldemort had committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the Riddles, I do not know, but I thi
nk it was. This time, as you will have seen, he killed not for revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor, besotted old woman showed him. Just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage, just as he had stolen his u
ncle Morfin\rquote s ring, so he ran off now with Hepzibah\rquote s cup and locket.\rquote 
\par \lquote But,\rquote  said Harry, frowning, \lquote it seems mad ... risking every\-thing, throwing away his job, just for those ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Mad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I hope you w
ill understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him, Harry, but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket, at least, as rightfully his.\rquote 
\par \lquote The locket maybe,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but why take the cup as well?\rquote 
\par \lquote It had belonged to another of Hogwarts\rquote  founders,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I think he still felt a great pull towards the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts\rquote 
 history. There were other reasons, I think ... I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you, in due course.
\par \lquote And now for the very last recollection I have to show you, at least until you manage to retrieve Professor Slughorn\rquote s memory for us. Ten years separate Hokey\rquote s memory and this one, ten years during which we can only guess 
at what Lord Voldemort was doing ...\rquote 
\par Harry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore emptied the last memory into the Pensieve.
\par \lquote Whose memory is it?\rquote  he asked.
\par \lquote Mine,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par And Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting sil\-ver mass, land
ing in the very office he had just left. There was Fawkes, slumbering happily on his perch, and there, behind the desk, was Dumbledore, who looked very similar to the Dumbledore standing beside Harry, though both hands were whole and undamaged and his fac
e was, perhaps, a little less lined. The one difference between the present-day office and this one was that it was snowing in the past; bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge.
\par The younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for some\-thing, and sure enough, moments after their arrival, there was a knock on the door and he said, \lquote Enter.\rquote 
\par Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from
 the great stone cauldron almost two years before; they were not as snakelike, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were wax
y
 and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his should
ers.
\par The Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of sur\-prise. Evidently this visit had been made by appointment.
\par \lquote Good evening, Tom,\rquote  said Dumbledore easily. \lquote Won\rquote t you sit down?\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote  said Voldemort, and he took the seat to which Dumbledore had gestured \endash  the very seat, by the looks of it, that Harry had just vacated in the present. \lquote I heard that you had become Headmaster,\rquote 
 he said, and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been. \lquote A worthy choice.\rquote 
\par \lquote I am glad you approve,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling. \lquote May I offer you a drink?\rquote 
\par \lquote That would be welcome,\rquote  said Voldemort. \lquote I have come a long way.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the Pensieve, but which then was full of bottles. Having handed Voldemort a goblet of wine and poured one for himself, he returned to the seat behind his desk.
\par \lquote So, Tom ... to what do I owe the pleasure?\rquote 
\par Voldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped his wine.
\par \lquote They do not call me \'93Tom\'94 any more,\rquote  he said. \lquote These days, I am known as \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I know what you are known as,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling pleasantly. \lquote But to me, I\rquote m afraid, you will always be Tom Riddle. It is one of the irritating things about old teachers, I am afraid, that they never quite forget their 
charges\rquote  youthful beginnings.\rquote 
\par He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: Dumbledore\rquote s refusal to use Voldemort\rquote s chosen name was a refusal to all
ow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that Voldemort took it as such.
\par \lquote I am surprised you have remained here so long,\rquote  said Voldemort after a short pause. \lquote I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Dumbledore, still smiling, \lquote to a wizard such as myself, there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone young minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the attraction of teaching, too.
\rquote 
\par \lquote I see it still,\rquote  said Voldemort. \lquote I merely wondered why you \endash  who is so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who has twice, I think, been offered the post of Minister \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Three times at the last count, actually,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote But the Ministry never attracted me as a career. Again, some\-thing we have in common, I think.\rquote 
\par Voldemort inclined his head, unsmiling, and took another sip of wine. Dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now, but waited, with a look of pleasant expectancy, for Voldemort to talk first.
\par \lquote I have returned,\rquote  he said, after a little while, \lquote later, perhaps, than Professor Dippet expected ... but I have returned, never\-theless, to request again what he once told me I was too young to have. I have come to you to as
k that you permit me to return to this castle, to teach. I think you must know that I have seen and done much since I left this place. I could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking.
\par \lquote Yes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us,\rquote  he said quietly. \lquote Rumours of your doings have reached your old school, Tom. I should be sorry to believe half of them.\rquote 
\par Voldemort\rquote s expression remained impassive as he said, \lquote Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies. You must know this, Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote You call it \'93greatness\'94, what you have been doing, do you?\rquote  asked Dumbledore delicately.
\par \lquote Certainly,\rquote  said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red. \lquote I have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Of some kinds of magic,\rquote  Dumbledore corrected him quietly. \lquote Of some. Of others, you remain ... forgive me ... woefully ignorant.\rquote 
\par For the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil thing, more threatening than a look of rage.
\par \lquote The old argument,\rquote  he said softly. \lquote But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronounce\-ments that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,\rquote  sug\-gested Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Well, then, what better place to start my fresh researches than here, at Hogwarts?\rquote  said Voldemort. \lquote Will you let 
me return? Will you let me share my knowledge with your students? I place myself and my talents at your disposal. I am yours to command.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore raised his eyebrows.
\par \lquote And what will become of those whom }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
command? What will happen to those who call themselves \endash  or so rumour has it \endash  the Death Eaters?\rquote 
\par Harry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore to know this name; he saw Voldemort\rquote s eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare.
\par \lquote My friends,\rquote  he said, after a moment\rquote s pause, \lquote will carry on without me, I am sure.\rquote 
\par \lquote I am glad to hear that you consider them friends,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants.\rquote 
\par \lquote You are mistaken,\rquote  said Voldemort.
\par \lquote Then if I were to go to the Hog\rquote s Head tonight, I would not find a group of them \endash  Nott, Rosier, Mulciber, Dolohov \endash 
 awaiting your return? Devoted friends indeed, to travel this far with you on a snowy night, merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post.\rquote 
\par There could be no doubt that Dumbledore\rquote s detailed know\-ledge of those with whom he was travelling was even less welcome to Voldemort; however, he rallied almost at once.
\par \lquote You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, no, merely friendly with the local barmen,\rquote  said Dumbledore lightly. \lquote Now, Tom ...\rquote 
\par Dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat, the tips of his fingers together in a very character\-istic gesture.
\par \lquote ... let us speak openly. Why have you come here tonight, surrounded by henchmen, to request a job we both know you do not want?\rquote 
\par Voldemort looked coldly surprised.
\par \lquote A job I do not want? On the contrary, Dumbledore, I want it very much.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, you want to come back to Hogwarts, but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen. What is it you\rquote re after, Tom? Why not try an open request for once?\rquote 
\par Voldemort sneered.
\par \lquote If you do not want to give me a job \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Of course I don\rquote t,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote And I don\rquote t think for a moment you expected me to. Nevertheless, you came here, you asked, you must have had a purpose.\rquote 
\par Voldemort stood up. He looked less like Tom Riddle than ever, his features thick with rage.
\par \lquote This is your final word?\rquote 
\par \lquote It is,\rquote  said Dumbledore, also standing.
\par \lquote Then we have nothing more to say to each other.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, nothing,\rquote  said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face. \lquote 
The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Tom ... I wish I could ...\rquote 
\par For a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a point\-less warning: he was sure that Voldemort\rquote s hand had twitched towards his pocket and his wand; but then the moment had passed, Voldemort had turned away, the door was closing and he was gone.

\par Harry felt Dumbledore\rquote s hand close over his arm again, and moments later, they were standing together on almost the same spot, but there was no snow building on the window-ledge, and Dumbledore\rquote 
s hand was blackened and dead-looking once more.
\par \lquote Why?\rquote  said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledore\rquote s face. \lquote Why did he come back? Did you ever find out?\rquote 
\par \lquote I have ideas,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote but no more than that.\rquote 
\par \lquote What ideas, sir?\rquote 
\par \lquote I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote When you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear ... to both of us.\rquote 
\par Harry was still burning with curiosity, and even though Dumbledore had walked to the door and was holding it open for him, he did not move at once.
\par \lquote Was he after the Defence Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn\rquote t say ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, he definitely wanted the Defence Against the Dark Arts job,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote The aftermath of our little meet\-ing proved that. You see, we have never been able to kee
p a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.\rquote

scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words \lquote For Enemies\rquote , and was itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of Hermione. Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page.
\par They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other people still up were fellow sixth-years. There had been a certain amount of exci
tement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the noticeboard that announced the date for their Apparition test. Those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date, the twenty-first of April, had the option of signing
 up for add\-itional practice sessions, which would take place (heavily supervised) in Hogsmeade.
\par Ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not managed to Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test. Hermione, who had now achieved Appa
rition twice, was a little more confident, but Harry, who would not be seventeen for another four months, could not take the test whether ready or not.
\par \lquote At least you can Apparate, though!\rquote  said Ron tensely. \lquote You\rquote ll have no trouble come July!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve only done it once,\rquote  Harry reminded him; he had finally managed to disappear and rematerialise inside his hoop during their previous lesson.
\par Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Appar\-ition, Ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and Hermione had already com\-
pleted. Harry fully expected to receive low marks on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle Dementors, but he did not care: Slughorn\rquote s memory was the most important thing to him now.
\par \lquote I\rquote m telling you, the stupid Prince isn\rquote t going to be able to help you with this, Harry!\rquote  said Hermione, more loudly. \lquote There\rquote s only one way to force someone to do what you want, and that\rquote 
s the Imperius Curse, which is illegal \endash \rquote

\par \lquote It\rquote s OK, we can fix it,\rquote  said Hermione, pulling the essay towards her and taking out her wand.
\par \lquote I love you, Hermione,\rquote  said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rubbing his eyes wearily.
\par Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, \lquote Don\rquote t let Lavender hear you saying that.\rquote

But the more I hint I want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. It\rquote s like going out with the Giant Squid.\rquote

\par \lquote No, Harry Potter, that is impossible,\rquote  said Dobby.

\par \lquote Yeah, it\rquote s great,\rquote  said Ron glumly, who was attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink that had recently been an almost completed essay. Hermione pulled it towards her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand.

s just Crabbe and Goyle as usual ... yeah, it all fits!\rquote  said Harry, jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire. \lquote They\rquote re stupid enough to do what they\rquote re told even if he won\rquote t tell them what he\rquote 
s up to ... but he doesn\rquote t want them to be seen lurking around outside the Room of Requirement, so he\rquote s got them taking Polyjuice to make them look like other people ... those two girls I saw him with when he missed Quidditch \endash

\par \lquote Do you mean to say,\rquote  said Hermione in a hushed voice, \lquote that that little girl whose scales I repaired \endash ?\rquote

\par \lquote Well, they wouldn\rquote t, would they, if he\rquote s shown them his Dark Mark,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Hmmm ... the Dark Mark we don\rquote t know exists,\rquote  said Hermione sceptically, rolling up Ron\rquote s dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll see,\rquote  said Harry confidently.
\par \lquote Yes, we will,\rquote  Hermione said, getting to her feet and stretch\-ing. \lquote But, Harry, before you get all excited, I still don\rquote t think you\rquote ll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing what\rquote

\par Harry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled. Once the door to the girls\rquote  dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on Ron.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you think?\rquote 
\par \lquote Wish I could Disapparate like a house-elf,\rquote  said Ron, staring at the spot where Dobby had vanished. \lquote I\rquote d have that Apparition test in the bag.\rquote 
\par Harry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for what felt like hours, wondering how Malf
oy was using the Room of Requirement and what he, Harry, would see when he went in there the following day, for whatever Hermione said, Harry was sure that if Malfoy had been able to see the Headquarters of the DA, he would be able to see Malfoy\rquote 
s ... what could it be? A meeting place? A hideout? A storeroom? A work\-shop? Harry\rquote 
s mind worked feverishly and his dreams, when he finally fell asleep, were broken and disturbed by images of Malfoy, who turned into Slughorn, who turned into Snape ...
\par Harry was in 
a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning; he had a free period before Defence Against the Dark Arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the Room of Requirement. Hermione was rather ostentatiously showing no interest
 in his whispered plans for forcing entry into the Room, which irritated Harry, because he thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to.
\par \lquote Look,\rquote  he said quietly, leaning forwards and putting a hand on the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Daily Prophet, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 which she had just removed from a post owl, to stop her opening it and vanishing behind it. \lquote I haven\rquote t forgotten about Slughorn, but I haven\rquote

\par \lquote I\rquote ve already told you, you need to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 persuade }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Slughorn,\rquote 
 said Hermione. \lquote It\rquote s not a question of tricking him or bewitching him, or Dumbledore could have done it in a second. Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirement,\rquote  she jerked the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

you should go and find Slughorn and start appealing to his better nature.\rquote 
\par \lquote Anyone we know \endash ?\rquote  asked Ron, as Hermione scanned the headlines.
\par \lquote Yes!\rquote  said Hermione, causing both Harry and Ron to gag on their breakfast, \lquote but it\rquote s all right, he\rquote s not dead \endash  it\rquote s Mundungus, he\rquote s been arrested and sent to Azkaban! Some\-
thing to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary ... and someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished ... oh, and how horrib

\par They finished their breakfast in silence. Hermione set off immediately for Ancient Runes, Ron for the common room, where he still had to finish his conclusion on Snape\rquote 
s Dementor essay, and Harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet.
\par Harry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty passage, but he need not have bothered. When he reached his destination he found it deserted. Harry was not sure whether his chances of getting inside the Room were bet\-
ter with Malfoy inside it or out, but at least his first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl.
\par He closed his eyes as he approached the place where the Room of Requirement\rquote s door was concealed. He knew what he had to do; he had become most accomplished at it last year. Concentrating with all his might he thought, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37

\par There was still no door.
\par Harry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to see a gaggle of first-years running back round the corner, appar\-ently under the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foul-mouthed ghost.
\par Harry tried every variation of \lquote I need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside you\rquote 
 that he could think of for a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced to concede that Hermione might have had a point: the Room simply did not want to open for him. F

\par \lquote Late again, Potter,\rquote  said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the candlelit classroom. \lquote Ten points from Gryffindor.\rquote 
\par Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron; half the class was still on its feet, taking out books and organising its things; he could not be much later than any of them.
\par \lquote Before we start, I want your Dementor essays,\rquote  said Snape, waving his wand carelessly, so that twenty-five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk. \lquote 
And I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all open your books at page \endash  what is it, Mr Finnigan?\rquote 
\par \lquote Sir,\rquote  said Seamus, \lquote I\rquote ve been wondering, how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was something in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote If you had actually read the article in question, Mr Finnigan, you would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak-thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.\rquote

\par \lquote But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,\rquote  said Snape, pointing suddenly at the back of the room, his black eyes fixed on Harry. \lquote Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost.\rquote 

\par The whole class looked round at Harry, who hastily tried to recall what Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn.
\par \lquote Er \endash  well \endash  ghosts are transparent \endash \rquote  he said.
\par \lquote Oh, very good,\rquote  interrupted Snape, his lip curling. \lquote Yes, it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

t they? So they\rquote d be solid \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote A five-year-old could have told us as much,\rquote  sneered Snape. \lquote The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wizard\rquote s spells. It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard\rquote 
s bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth ... and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699

\par The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair, staring at them through thick, white, round glasses.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  she said glumly. \lquote It\rquote s you two.\rquote 
\par \lquote Who were you expecting?\rquote  said Ron, looking at her in the mirror.
\par \lquote Nobody,\rquote  said Myrtle, picking moodily at a spot on her chin. \lquote He said he\rquote d come back and see me, but then }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 said you\rquote d pop in and visit me, too ...\rquote  she gave Harry a reproach\-ful look \lquote ... and I haven\rquote t seen you for months and months. I\rquote 
ve learned not to expect too much from boys.\rquote 
\par \lquote I thought you lived in that girls\rquote  bathroom?\rquote  said Harry, who had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now.
\par \lquote I do,\rquote  she said, with a sulky little shrug, \lquote but that doesn\rquote t mean I can\rquote t }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 visit }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 other places. I came and saw you in your bath once, remember?\rquote 
\par \lquote Vividly,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote But I thought he liked me,\rquote  she said plaintively. \lquote Maybe if you two left, he\rquote d come back again ... we had lots in common ... I\rquote m sure he felt it ...\rquote 
\par And she looked hopefully towards the door.
\par \lquote When you say you had lots in common,\rquote  said Ron, sound\-ing rather amused now, \lquote d\rquote you mean he lives in an S-bend, too?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom. \lquote I mean he\rquote s sensitive, people bully him, too, and he feels lonely and hasn\rquote t got anybody to talk to, and he\rquote 
s not afraid to show his feelings and cry!\rquote 
\par \lquote There\rquote s been a boy in here crying?\rquote  said Harry curiously. \lquote A young boy?\rquote 
\par \lquote Never you mind!\rquote  said Myrtle, her small, leaky eyes fixed on Ron, who was now definitely grinning. \lquote I promised I wouldn\rquote t tell anyone and I\rquote ll take his secret to the \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  not the grave, surely?\rquote  said Ron with a snort. \lquote The sewers, maybe ...\rquote 
\par Myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet, causing water to slop over the sides and on to the floor. Goad\-ing Myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into Ron.
\par \lquote You\rquote re right,\rquote  he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder, \lquote I\rquote ll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the test.\rquote 
\par And so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the sixth-years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight. Harry felt rather jealous watch\-
ing them all get ready to go into the village; he missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time. However, he had decided to use the time to attempt anoth
er assault on the Room of Requirement.
\par \lquote You\rquote d do better,\rquote  said Hermione, when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the Entrance Hall, \lquote to go straight to Slughorn\rquote s office and try and get that memory from him.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve been trying!\rquote  said Harry crossly, whi
ch was perfectly true. He had lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an attempt to corner Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that Harry had not been able to catch him. Twice, Harry had gone to his office and kn
ocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone.
\par \lquote He doesn\rquote t want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell I\rquote ve been trying to get him on his own again and he\rquote s not going to let it happen!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, you\rquote ve just got to keep at it, haven\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par The short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was doing his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forwards a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overhea
rd by the caretaker. He wished Ron and Hermione luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase again, determined, whatever Hermione said, to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement.
\par Once out of sight of the Entrance Hall, Harry pulled out the Marauder\rquote s Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself, he tapped the map, murmured, \lquote I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,\rquote 
 and scanned it carefully.
\par As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various
 common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the Slytherins in the dungeons and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor ... there were a few 
p
eople out in the grounds ... and there, alone in the seventh-floor corridor, was Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the Room was open, whether the map 
w
as aware of it or not. He therefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor, when he began to creep, very slowly, towards the very same little girl, clutching her heavy brass scales, that Hermione had so kind
ly helped a fortnight before. He waited until he was right behind her before bend\-ing very low and whispering, \lquote Hello ... you\rquote re very pretty, aren\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par Goyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into the air and sprinted away, vanish
ing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor. Laughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out
 there, but not daring to make an appearance. It gave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried.
\par Yet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, having tried many more variations of 
his request to see what Malfoy was up to, the wall was just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated beyond belief; Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there. Losing h
is patience completely, Harry ran at the wall and kicked it.
\par \lquote OUCH!\rquote 
\par He thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him.
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote 
\par He spun round, one-legged, and toppled over. There, to his utter astonishment, was Tonks, walking towards him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor.
\par \lquote What\rquote re you doing here?\rquote  he said, scrambling to his feet again; why did she always have to find him lying on the floor?
\par \lquote I came to see Dumbledore,\rquote  said Tonks.
\par Harry thought she looked terrible; thinner than usual, her mouse-coloured hair lank.
\par \lquote His office isn\rquote t here,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote it\rquote s round the other side of the castle, behind the gargoyle \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I know,\rquote  said Tonks. \lquote He\rquote s not there. Apparently he\rquote s gone away again.\rquote 
\par \lquote Has he?\rquote  said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor. \lquote Hey \endash  you don\rquote t know where he goes, I suppose?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Tonks.
\par \lquote What did you want to see him about?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nothing in particular,\rquote  said Tonks, picking, apparently unconsciously, at the sleeve of her robe. \lquote I just thought he might know what\rquote s going on ... I\rquote ve heard rumours ... people getting hurt ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I know, it\rquote s all been in the papers,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote That little kid trying to kill his \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote The }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Prophet\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 s often behind the times,\rquote  said Tonks, who didn
\rquote t seem to be listening to him. \lquote You haven\rquote t had any letters from anyone in the Order recently?\rquote 
\par \lquote No one from the Order writes to me any more,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote not since Sirius \endash \rquote 
\par He saw that her eyes had filled with tears.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry,\rquote  he muttered awkwardly. \lquote I mean ... I miss him, as well ...\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Tonks blankly, as though she had not heard him. \lquote Well ... I\rquote ll see you around, Harry ...\rquote 
\par And she turned abruptly and walked back down the cor\-ridor, leaving Harry to 
stare after her. After a minute or so, he pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the Room of Requirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that Ron and Hermione wou
ld soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to Malfoy who, hopefully, would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come.
\par He found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, already halfway through an early lunch.
\par \lquote I did it \endash  well, kind of!\rquote  Ron told Harry enthusiastic\-ally when he caught sight of him. \lquote I was supposed to be Apparating to outside Madam Puddifoot\rquote s teashop and I overshot it a bit, ended up near Scrivenshaft\rquote 
s, but at least I moved!\rquote 
\par \lquote Good one,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote How\rquote d you do, Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, she was perfect, obviously,\rquote  said Ron, before Hermione could answer. \lquote Perfect deliberation, divination and desper\-ation, or whatever the hell it is \endash 
 we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you should\rquote ve heard Twycross going on about her \endash  I\rquote ll be surprised if he doesn\rquote t pop the question soon \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote And what about you?\rquote  asked Hermione, ignoring Ron. \lquote Have you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yep,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote And guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!\rquote 
\par \lquote Tonks?\rquote  repeated Ron and Hermione together, looking surprised.
\par \lquote Yeah, she said she\rquote d come to visit Dumbledore ...\rquote 
\par \lquote If you ask me,\rquote  said Ron once Harry had finished des\-cribing his conversation with Tonks, \lquote she\rquote s cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s a bit odd,\rquote  said Hermione, who for some reason looked very concerned. \lquote She\rquote s supposed to be guarding the school, why\rquote s she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when he\rquote 
s not even here?\rquote 
\par \lquote I had a thought,\rquote  said Harry tentatively. He felt strange about voicing it; this was much more Hermione\rquote s territory than his. \lquote You don\rquote t think she can have been ... you know ... in love with Sirius?\rquote 
\par Hermione stared at him.
\par \lquote What on earth makes you say that?\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno,\rquote  said Harry, shrugging, \lquote but she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name ... and her Patronus is a big four-legged thing now ... I wondered whether it hadn\rquote t become ... you know ... him.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s a thought,\rquote  said Hermione slowly. \lquote But I still don\rquote t know why she\rquote d be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore, if that\rquote s really why she was here ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Goes back to what I said, doesn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Ron, who was now shovelling mashed potato into his mouth. \lquote She\rquote s gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve. Women,\rquote  he said wisely to Harry. \lquote They\rquote re easily upset.
\rquote 
\par \lquote And yet,\rquote  said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, \lquote I doubt you\rquote d find a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 woman }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

Patches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear over the castle turrets, but these signs of approaching summer did not lift Harry\rquote s mood. He had been thwarted, both in his attempts to
 find out what Malfoy was doing, and in his efforts to start a conversation with Slughorn that might lead, somehow, to Slughorn handing over the memory he had apparently suppressed for decades.

\par They were sitting with Ron in a sunny corner of the court\-yard after lunch. Hermione and Ron were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699

\par \lquote It isn\rquote t Lavender,\rquote  said Hermione wearily.
\par \lquote Oh, good,\rquote  said Ron, relaxing.
\par \lquote Harry Potter?\rquote  said the girl. \lquote I was asked to give you this.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks ...\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment. Once the girl was out of earshot he said, \lquote Dumbledore said we wouldn\rquote t be having any more lessons until I got the memory!\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe he wants to check on how you\rquote re doing?\rquote  suggested Hermione, as Harry unrolled the parchment; but rather than finding Dumbledore\rquote 
s long, narrow, slanting writing he saw an untidy sprawl, very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotches on the parchment where the ink had run.

\par \lquote What for?\rquote  demanded Ron incredulously.
\par \lquote What on earth is more important than this memory, Harry?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par Harry did not answer. The thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edges of his imagination for some time; vague and unformulated plans that involved Ginny splitting u
p with Dean, and Ron somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of his brain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and waking ...
\par \lquote Harry? Are you still with us?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote Wha\emdash ? Yeah, of course,\rquote  he said, pulling himself together. \lquote Well ... OK. If I can\rquote t get Slughorn to talk this afternoon, I\rquote ll take some Felix and have another go this evening.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s decided, then,\rquote  said Hermione briskly, getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette. \lquote Destination ... determination ... deliberation ...\rquote  she murmured.
\par \lquote Oh, stop that,\rquote  Ron begged her, \lquote I feel sick enough as it is \endash  quick, hide me!\rquote 
\par \lquote It isn\rquote t Lavender!\rquote  said Hermione impatiently, as another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and Ron dived behind her.
\par \lquote Cool,\rquote  said Ron, peering over Hermione\rquote s shoulder to check. \lquote Blimey, they don\rquote t look happy, do they?\rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote re the Montgomery sisters and of course they don\rquote t look happy, didn\rquote t you hear what happened to their little brother?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote I\rquote m losing track of what\rquote s happening to everyone\rquote s relatives, to be honest,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Well, their brother was attacked by a werewolf. The rumour is that their mother refused to help the Death Eaters. Anyway, the boy was only five and he died in St Mungo\rquote s, they couldn\rquote t save him.\rquote 
\par \lquote He died?\rquote  repeated Harry, shocked. \lquote But surely werewolves don\rquote t kill, they just turn you into one of them?\rquote 
\par \lquote They sometimes kill,\rquote  said Ron, who looked unusually grave now. \lquote I\rquote ve heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away.\rquote 
\par \lquote What was the werewolf\rquote s name?\rquote  said Harry quickly.
\par \lquote Well, the rumour is that it was that Fenrir Greyback,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote I knew it \endash  the maniac who likes attacking kids, the one Lupin told me about!\rquote  said Harry angrily.
\par Hermione looked at him bleakly.
\par \lquote Harry, you\rquote ve got to get that memory,\rquote  she said. \lquote It\rquote s all about stopping Voldemort, isn\rquote t it? These dreadful things that are happening are all down to him ...\rquote 
\par The bell rang overhead in the castle and both Hermione and Ron jumped to their feet, looking terrified.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll do fine,\rquote  Harry told them both, as they headed towards the Entrance Hall to meet the rest of the people taking their Apparition test. \lquote Good luck.\rquote 
\par \lquote And you too!\rquote  said Hermione with a significant look, as Harry headed off to the dungeons.
\par There were only three of them in Potions that afternoon: Harry, Ernie and Draco Malfoy.
\par \lquote All too young to Apparate just yet?\rquote  said Slughorn genially. \lquote Not turned seventeen yet?\rquote 
\par They shook their heads.
\par \lquote Ah well,\rquote  said Slughorn cheerily, \lquote as we\rquote re so few, we\rquote ll do something }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 fun. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 I want you all to brew me up something amusing!\rquote 
\par \lquote That sounds good, sir,\rquote  said Ernie sycophantically, rubbing his hands together. Malfoy, on the other hand, did not crack a smile.
\par \lquote What do you mean, something \'93amusing\'94?\rquote  he said irritably.
\par \lquote Oh, surprise me,\rquote  said Slughorn airily.
\par Malfoy opened his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Advanced Potion-Making }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
with a sulky expression. It could not have been plainer that he thought this lesson was a waste of time. Un
doubtedly, Harry thought, watching him over the top of his own book, Malfoy was begrudging the time he could otherwise be spending in the Room of Requirement.
\par Was it his imagination, or did Malfoy, like Tonks, look thinner? Certainly he looked paler; his s
kin still had that greyish tinge, probably because he so rarely saw daylight these days. But there was no air of smugness, or excitement, or superiority; none of the swagger that he had had on the Hogwarts Express, when he had boasted openly of the mis\-
sion he had been given by Voldemort ... there could be only one conclusion, in Harry\rquote s opinion: the mission, whatever it was, was going badly.
\par Cheered by this thought, Harry skimmed through his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Advanced Potion-Making }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
and found a heavily corrected Half-Blood Prince\rquote s version of An Elixir to Induce Euphoria, which seemed not only to meet Slughorn\rquote s instructions, but which might (Harry\rquote 
s heart leapt as the thought struck him) put Slughorn into such a good mood that he would be pre\-pared to hand over that memory if Harry could persuade him to taste some ...
\par \lquote Well, now, this looks absolutely wonderful,\rquote  said Slughorn clapping his hands together an hour and a half later, as he stared down into the sunshine-yellow contents of Harry\rquote s caul\-dron. \lquote Euphoria, I take it? And what\rquote 
s that I smell? Mmmm ... you\rquote ve added just a sprig of peppermint, haven\rquote t you? Unorthodox, but what a stroke of inspiration, Harry. Of course, that would tend to counterbalance the occasional side-effects of excessive singing and nose-tweak
ing ... I really don\rquote t know where you get these brainwaves, my boy ... unless \endash \rquote 
\par Harry pushed the Half-Blood Prince\rquote s book deeper into his bag with his foot.
\par \lquote \endash  it\rquote s just your mother\rquote s genes coming out in you!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh ... yeah, maybe,\rquote  said Harry, relieved.
\par E
rnie was looking rather grumpy; determined to outshine Harry for once, he had most rashly invented his own potion, which had curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron. Malfoy was already packing up, sour-faced; Slughorn ha
d pronounced his Hiccoughing Solution merely \lquote passable\rquote .
\par The bell rang and both Ernie and Malfoy left at once.
\par \lquote Sir,\rquote  Harry began, but Slughorn immediately glanced over his shoulder; when he saw that the room was empty but for himself and Harry he hurried away as fast as he could.
\par \lquote Professor \endash  Professor, don\rquote t you want to taste my po\emdash ?\rquote  called Harry desperately.
\par But Slughorn had gone. Disappointed, Harry emptied the cauldron, packed up his things, left the dungeon and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room.
\par Ron and Hermione returned in the late afternoon.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  cried Hermione as she climbed through the portrait hole. \lquote Harry, I passed!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well done!\rquote  he said. \lquote And Ron?\rquote 
\par \lquote He \endash  he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 just }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 failed,\rquote 
 whispered Hermione, as Ron came slouching into the room looking most morose. \lquote It was really unlucky, a tiny thing, the examiner just spotted that he\rquote d left half an eyebrow behind ... how did it go with Slughorn?\rquote 
\par \lquote No joy,\rquote  said Harry, as Ron joined them. \lquote Bad luck, mate, but you\rquote ll pass next time \endash  we can take it together.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I s\rquote pose,\rquote  said Ron grumpily. \lquote But }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 half an eyebrow! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Like that matters!\rquote 
\par \lquote I know,\rquote  said Hermione soothingly, \lquote it does seem really harsh ...\rquote 
\par They spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the Apparition examiner and Ron looked fractionally more cheer\-ful by the time they set off back to the common room, now discussing the continuing problem of Slughorn and the memory.
\par \lquote So, Harry \endash  you going to use the Felix Felicis or what?\rquote  Ron demanded.
\par \lquote Yeah, I s\rquote pose I\rquote d better,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I don\rquote t reckon I\rquote ll need all of it, not twelve hours\rquote  worth, it can\rquote t take all night ... I\rquote 
ll just take a mouthful. Two or three hours should do it.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s a great feeling when you take it,\rquote  said Ron reminis\-cently. \lquote Like you can\rquote t do anything wrong.\rquote 
\par \lquote What are you talking about?\rquote  said Hermione, laughing. \lquote You\rquote ve never taken any!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, but I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 thought }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 I had, didn\rquote t I?\rquote 
 said Ron, as though explaining the obvious. \lquote Same difference really ...\rquote 
\par As they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great Hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals, they lingered for a while in the common room, the plan being that Harry should go to Slughorn\rquote 
s office once the teacher had had time to get back there. When the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the Forbidden Forest
 they decided the moment had come, and, after checking carefully that Neville, Dean and Seamus were all in the common room, sneaked up to the boys\rquote  dormitory.
\par Harry took out the rolled-up socks at the bottom of his trunk and extracted the tiny, gleaming bottle.
\par \lquote Well, here goes,\rquote  said Harry, and he raised the little bottle and took a carefully measured gulp.
\par \lquote What does it feel like?\rquote  whispered Hermione.
\par Harry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, any\-
thing at all ... and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible, but positively easy ...
\par He got to his feet smiling, brimful of confidence.
\par \lquote Excellent,\rquote  he said. \lquote Really excellent. Right ... I\rquote m going down to Hagrid\rquote s.\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Ron and Hermione together, looking aghast.
\par \lquote No, Harry \endash  you\rquote ve got to go and see Slughorn, remember?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry confidently. \lquote I\rquote m going to Hagrid\rquote s, I\rquote ve got a good feeling about going to Hagrid\rquote s.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote ve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?\rquote  asked Ron, looking stunned.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. \lquote I feel like it\rquote s the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Ron and Hermione together, both looking posi\-tively alarmed now.
\par \lquote This }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Felix Felicis, I suppose?\rquote 
 said Hermione anxiously, holding up the bottle to the light. \lquote You haven\rquote t got another little bottle full of \endash  I don\rquote t know \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Essence of Insanity?\rquote  suggested Ron, as Harry swung his Cloak over his shoulders.
\par Harry laughed and Ron and Hermione looked even more alarmed.
\par \lquote Trust me,\rquote  he said. \lquote I know what I\rquote m doing ... or at least ...\rquote  he strolled confidently to the door, \lquote Felix does.\rquote 
\par He pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set off down the stairs, Ron and Hermione hurrying along behind him. At the foot of the stairs Harry slid through the open door.
\par \lquote What were you doing up there with }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 her?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699  shr
ieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys\rquote  dormitories. Harry heard Ron spluttering behind him as he darted across the room away from them.
\par Getting through the portrait hole was simple; as he approached it, Ginny and Dean came through it and Harry was able to slip between them. As he did so, he brushed acci\-dentally against Ginny.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Don\rquote t }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 push me, please, Dean,\rquote  she said, sounding annoyed. 
\lquote You\rquote re always doing that, I can get through perfectly well on my own ...\rquote 
\par The portrait swung closed behind Harry, but not before he had heard Dean make an angry retort ... his feeling of elation increasing, Harry strode off through the castle. He did not have 
to creep along, for he met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise him in the slightest: this evening, he was the luckiest person at Hogwarts.
\par Why he knew that going to Hagrid\rquote s was the right thing to do, he had no idea. It was as though the potion was illuminat\-
ing a few steps of the path at a time: he could not see the final destination, he could not see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory. When he reached the Entrance Hall he saw that Filch had forg
otten to lock the front door. Beaming, Harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the dusk.
\par It was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to Hagrid\rquote 
s. It was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to Harry that this was a whim on which he should act, so he directed his feet immediately towards the vegetable patch where he was pleased, but not 
altogether surprised, to find Professor Slughorn in conversation with Professor Sprout. Harry lurked behind a low stone wall, feeling at peace with the world and listening to their con\-versation.
\par \lquote ... I do thank you for taking the time, Pomona,\rquote  Slughorn was saying courteously. \lquote Most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, I quite agree,\rquote  said Professor Sprout warmly. \lquote That enough for you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Plenty, plenty,\rquote  said Slughorn, who, Harry saw, was carry\-ing an armful of leafy plants. \lquote This should allow for a few leaves for each of my third-years, and some to spare if any\-
body overstews them ... well, good evening to you, and many thanks again!\rquote 
\par Professor Sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses and Slughorn directed his steps to the spot where Harry stood, invisible.
\par Seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, Harry pulled off the Cloak with a flourish.
\par \lquote Good evening, Professor.\rquote 
\par \lquote Merlin\rquote s beard, Harry, you made me jump,\rquote  said Slughorn, stopping dead in his tracks and looking wary. \lquote How did you get out of the castle?\rquote 
\par \lquote I think Filch must\rquote ve forgotten to lock the doors,\rquote  said Harry cheerfully, and was delighted to see Slughorn scowl.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll be reporting that man, he\rquote s more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me ... but why are you out here, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, sir, it\rquote s Hagrid,\rquote  said Harry, who knew that the right thing to do just now was to tell the truth. \lquote He\rquote s pretty upset ... but you won\rquote t tell anyone, Professor? I don\rquote t want trouble for him ...
\rquote 
\par Slughorn\rquote s curiosity was evidently aroused.
\par \lquote Well, I can\rquote t promise that,\rquote  he said gruffly. \lquote But I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt, so I\rquote m sure he can\rquote t be up to anything very dreadful ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, it\rquote s this giant spider, he\rquote s had it for years ... it lived in the Forest ... it could talk and everything \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I heard rumours there were Acromantula in the Forest,\rquote  said Slughorn softly, looking over at the mass of black trees. \lquote It\rquote s true, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote But this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid ever got, it died last night. He\rquote s devastated. He wants com\-pany while he buries it and I said I\rquote d go.\rquote 
\par \lquote Touching, touching,\rquote  said Slughorn absent-mindedly, his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of Hagrid\rquote s cabin. \lquote 
But Acromantula venom is very valuable ... if the beast has only just died it might not yet have dried out ... of course, I wouldn\rquote t want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset ... but if there were any way to procure some ... I mean, it
\rquote s almost impossible to get venom from an Acromantula while it\rquote s alive ...\rquote 
\par Slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now.
\par \lquote ... seems an awful waste not to collect it ... might get a hundred Galleons a pint ... to be frank, my salary is not large ...\rquote 
\par And now Harry saw clearly what was to be done.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, \lquote well, if you wanted to come, Professor, Hagrid would probably be really pleased ... give Aragog a better send-off, you know ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, of course,\rquote  said Slughorn, his eyes now gleaming with enthusiasm. \lquote I tell you what, Harry, I\rquote ll meet you down there with a bottle or two ... we\rquote ll drink the poor beast\rquote s \endash  well \endash  not health 
\endash  but we\rquote ll send it off in style, anyway, once it\rquote s buried. And I\rquote ll change my tie, this one is a little exuberant for the occasion ...\rquote 
\par He bustled back into the castle, and Harry sped off to Hagrid\rquote s, delighted with himself.
\par \lquote Yeh came,\rquote  croaked Hagrid, when he opened the door and saw Harry emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of him.
\par \lquote Yeah \endash  Ron and Hermione couldn\rquote t, though,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote They\rquote re really sorry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote  \endash  don\rquote  matter ... he\rquote d\rquote ve bin touched yeh\rquote re here, though, Harry ...\rquote 
\par Hagrid gave a great sob. He had made himself a black armband out of what loo
ked like a rag dipped in boot polish and his eyes were puffy, red and swollen. Harry patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was the highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach.
\par \lquote Where are we burying him?\rquote  he asked. \lquote The Forest?\rquote 
\par \lquote Blimey, no,\rquote  said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes on the bottom of his shirt. \lquote The other spiders won\rquote  let me anywhere near their webs now Aragog\rquote s gone. Turns out it was on\rquote y on his orders they didn\rquote 
 eat me! Can yeh believe that, Harry?\rquote 
\par The honest answer was \lquote yes\rquote ; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come face to face with the Acromantula: they had been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them eating Hagrid.
\par \lquote Never bin an area o\rquote  the Forest I couldn\rquote  go before!\rquote  said Hagrid, shaking his head. \lquote It wasn\rquote  easy, gettin\rquote  Aragog\rquote s body out o\rquote  there, I can tell yeh \endash 
 they usually eat their dead, see ... but I wanted ter give \rquote im a nice burial ... a proper send-off ...\rquote 
\par He broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow, saying as he did so (for the potion seemed to indi\-cate that it was the right thing to do), \lquote Professor Slughorn met me coming down here, Hagrid.\rquote 
\par \lquote Not in trouble, are yeh?\rquote  said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. \lquote Yeh shouldn\rquote  be outta the castle in the evenin\rquote , I know it, it\rquote s my fault \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he\rquote d like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote He\rquote s gone to change into something more suitable, I think ... and he said he\rquote 
d bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragog\rquote s memory ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Did he?\rquote  said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. \lquote Tha\rquote s \endash  tha\rquote s righ\rquote  nice of him, tha\rquote  is, an\rquote  not turnin\rquote  you in, either. I\rquote 
ve never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before ... comin\rquote  ter see old Aragog off, though, eh? Well ... he\rquote d\rquote ve liked that, Aragog would ...\rquote 
\par Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely moved to the rear window of Hagrid\rquote 
s hut where he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs curled and tangled.
\par \lquote Are we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your garden?\rquote 
\par \lquote Jus\rquote  beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,\rquote  said Hagrid in a choked voice. \lquote I\rquote ve already dug the \endash  you know \endash  grave. Jus\rquote  thought we\rquote d say a few nice things over him \endash 
 happy memories, yeh know \endash \rquote 
\par His voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on the door and he turned to answer it, blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so. Slughorn hurried over the threshold, several bottles in his arms, and wearing a sombre black cravat.

\par \lquote Hagrid,\rquote  he said, in a deep, grave voice. \lquote So very sorry to hear of your loss.\rquote 
\par \lquote Tha\rquote s very nice of yeh,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Thanks a lot. An\rquote  thanks fer not givin\rquote  Harry detention, neither ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Wouldn\rquote t have dreamed of it,\rquote  said Slughorn. \lquote Sad night, sad night ... where is the poor creature?\rquote 
\par \lquote Out here,\rquote  said Hagrid in a shaky voice. \lquote Shall we \endash  shall we do it, then?\rquote 
\par The three of them stepped out into the back garden. The moon was glistening palely through the trees and its rays mingled with the light spilling from Hagrid\rquote s window to illuminate Aragog\rquote 
s body lying on the edge of a massive pit, beside a ten-foot-high mound of freshly dug earth.
\par \lquote Magnificent,\rquote  said Slughorn, approaching the spider\rquote 
s head, where eight milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone, motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thought he heard the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy head.
\par \lquote It\rquote s not ev\rquote ryone appreciates how beau\rquote iful they are,\rquote  said Hagrid to Slughorn\rquote s back, tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes. \lquote I didn\rquote  know yeh were int\rquote 
rested in creatures like Aragog, Horace.\rquote 
\par \lquote Interested? My dear Hagrid, I revere them,\rquote  said Slughorn, stepping back from the body. Harry saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak, though Hagrid, mopping his eyes once more, noticed nothing. \lquote 
Now ... shall we proceed to the burial?\rquote 
\par Hagrid nodded and moved forwards. He heaved the gigantic spider into his arms and, with an enormous grunt, rolled it into the dark pit. It hit the bottom with a rather horrible, crunchy thud. Hagrid started to cry again.
\par \lquote Of course, it\rquote s difficult for you, who knew him best,\rquote  said Slughorn, who, like Harry, could reach no higher than Hagrid\rquote s elbow, but patted it all the same. \lquote Why don\rquote t I say a few words?\rquote 
\par He must have got a lot of good-quality venom from Aragog, Harry thought, for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said, in a slow, impressive voice, \lquote 
Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you won\rquote t forget! Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in t
he quiet, web-spun places of your Forest home. May your many-eyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.\rquote 
\par \lquote Tha\rquote  was ... tha\rquote  was ... beau\rquote iful!\rquote  howled Hagrid and he collapsed on to the compost heap, crying harder than ever.
\par \lquote There, there,\rquote  said Slughorn, waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell, with a muffled sort of crash, on to the dead spider, forming a smooth mound. \lquote Let\rquote 
s get inside and have a drink. Get on his other side, Harry ... that\rquote s it ... up you come, Hagrid ... well done ...\rquote 
\par They deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table. Fang, who had been skulking in his basket during the burial, now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into Harry\rquote s lap 
as usual. Slughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had brought.
\par \lquote I have had it }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 all }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 tested for poison,\rquote 
 he assured Harry, pouring most of the first bottle into one of Hagrid\rquote s bucket-sized mugs and handing it to Hagrid. \lquote Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.\rquote 
\par Harry saw, in his mind\rquote s eye, the expression on Hermione\rquote s face if she ever heard about this abuse of house-elves, and decided never to mention it to her.
\par \lquote One for Harry ...\rquote  said Slughorn, dividing a second bottle between two mugs, \lquote ... and one for me. Well,\rquote  he raised his mug high, \lquote to Aragog.\rquote 
\par \lquote Aragog,\rquote  said Harry and Hagrid together.
\par Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry, however, with the way ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis, knew that he must not drink, so he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before him.
\par \lquote I had him from an egg, yeh know,\rquote  said Hagrid morosely. \lquote Tiny little thing he was when he hatched. \rquote Bout the size of a Pekinese.\rquote 
\par \lquote Sweet,\rquote  said Slughorn.
\par \lquote Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until ... well ...\rquote 
\par Hagrid\rquote s face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom Riddle had contrived to have Hagrid thrown out of school, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets. Slughorn, however, did not
 seem to be listening; he was looking up at the ceiling, from which a number of brass pots hung, and also a long, silky skein of bright white hair.
\par \lquote That\rquote s never unicorn hair, Hagrid?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yeah,\rquote  said Hagrid indifferently. \lquote Gets pulled out of their tails, they catch it on branches an\rquote  stuff in the Forest, yeh know ...\rquote 
\par \lquote But my dear chap, do you know how much that\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 worth?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote I use it fer bindin\rquote  on bandages an\rquote  stuff if a creature gets injured,\rquote  said Hagrid, shrugging. \lquote It\rquote s dead useful ... very strong, see.\rquote 
\par Slughorn took another deep draught from his mug, his eyes moving carefully around the cabin now, looking, Harry knew, for more treasures that he might be able to convert into a plentiful supply of oak-matured mead, crystal
lised pineapple and velvet smoking jackets. He refilled Hagrid\rquote 
s mug and his own, and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the Forest these days and how Hagrid was able to look after them all. Hagrid, becoming expansive under the influence of the drink and Slughorn\rquote 
s flattering interest, stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long explanation of Bowtruckle husbandry.
\par The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point and he noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had b
rought was running out fast. Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laugh\-
able: indeed, Harry grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slughorn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs), he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill.
\par After an hour or so, Hagrid and Slughorn began making extravagant toasts: to Hogwarts, to Dumbledore, to elf-made wine and to \endash

\par \lquote Yes, indeed,\rquote  cried Slughorn a little thickly, \lquote Parry Otter, the Chosen Boy Who \endash  well \endash  something of that sort,\rquote  he mum\-bled, and drained his mug, too.
\par Not long after this, Hagrid became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon Slughorn, who pocketed it with cries of, \lquote To friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair!\rquote 
\par And for a while after that, Hagrid and Slughorn were sitting side by side, arms around each other, singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo.
\par \lquote Aaargh, the good die young,\rquote  muttered Hagrid, slump\-ing low on to the table, a little cross-eyed, while Slughorn continued to warble the refrain. \lquote Me dad was no age ter go ... nor were your mum an\rquote  dad, Harry ...\rquote 

\par Great fat tears oozed out of the corners of Hagrid\rquote s crinkled eyes again; he grasped Harry\rquote s arm and shook it.

\par \lquote I don\rquote t \endash  don\rquote t suppose you remember it, Harry?\rquote  he asked awkwardly.
\par \lquote No \endash  well, I was only one when they died,\rquote  said Harry, his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in Hagrid\rquote s heavy snores. \lquote But I\rquote ve found out pretty much what happened since. My

\par \lquote I \endash  I didn\rquote t,\rquote  said Slughorn in a hushed voice.
\par \lquote Yeah ... Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body towards my mum,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Slughorn gave a great shudder, but he did not seem able to tear his horrified gaze away from Harry\rquote s face.
\par \lquote He told her to get out of the way,\rquote  said Harry remorse\-lessly. \lquote He told me she needn\rquote t have died. He only wanted me. She could have run.\rquote

\par \lquote It is, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Harry, in a voice barely more than a whisper. \lquote But she didn\rquote t move. Dad was already dead, but she didn\rquote t want me to go too. She tried to plead with Voldemort ... but he just laughed \'85

\par \lquote That\rquote s enough!\rquote  said Slughorn suddenly, raising a shaking hand. \lquote Really, my dear boy, enough ... I\rquote m an old man ... I don\rquote t need to hear ... I don\rquote t want to hear ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I forgot,\rquote  lied Harry, Felix Felicis leading him on. \lquote You liked her, didn\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Liked her?\rquote  said Slughorn, his eyes brimming with tears once more. \lquote I don\rquote t imagine anyone who met her wouldn\rquote t have liked her ... very brave ... very funny ... it was the most horrible thing ...\rquote 
\par \lquote But you won\rquote t help her son,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote She gave me her life, but you won\rquote t give me a memory.\rquote 
\par Hagrid\rquote s rumbling snores filled the cabin. Harry looked steadily into Slughorn\rquote s tear-filled eyes. The Potions master seemed unable to look away.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t say that,\rquote  he whispered. \lquote It isn\rquote t a question ... if it were to help you, of course ... but no purpose can be served ...\rquote 
\par \lquote It can,\rquote  said Harry clearly. \lquote Dumbledore needs information. I need information.\rquote 
\par He knew he was safe: Felix was telling him that Slughorn would remember nothing of this in the morning. Looking Slughorn straight in the eye, Harry leant forwards a little.
\par \lquote I am the Chosen One. I have to kill him. I need that memory.\rquote 
\par Slughorn turned paler than ever; his shiny forehead gleamed with sweat.
\par \lquote You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 the Chosen One?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course I am,\rquote  said Harry calmly.
\par \lquote But then ... my dear boy ... you\rquote re asking a great deal ... you\rquote re asking me, in fact, to aid you in your attempt to destroy \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily Evans?\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, Harry, of course I do, but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re scared he\rquote ll find out you helped me?\rquote 
\par Slughorn said nothing; he looked terrified.
\par \lquote Be brave like my mother, Professor ...\rquote 
\par Slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his mouth; he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby.
\par \lquote I am not proud ...\rquote  he whispered through his fingers. \lquote I am ashamed of what \endash  of what that memory shows ... I think I may have done great damage that day ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote d cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote It would be a very brave and noble thing to do.\rquote 
\par Hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on. Slughorn and Harry stared at each other over the guttering candle. There was a long, long silence, but Felix Felicis told Harry not to break it, to wait.
\par Then, very slowly, Slughorn put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wand. He put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small, empty bottle. Still looking into Harry\rquote 
s eyes, Slughorn touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew it, so that a long, silver thread of memory came away too, clinging to the wand-tip. Longer
 and longer the memory stretched until it broke and swung, silvery bright, from the wand. Slughorn lowered it into the bottle where it coiled, then spread, swirling like gas. He corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table t
o Harry.
\par \lquote Thank you very much, Professor.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re a good boy,\rquote  said Professor Slughorn, tears trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus moustache. \lquote And you\rquote ve got her eyes ... just don\rquote t think too badly of me once you\rquote ve seen it ...\rquote

Harry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he crept back into the castle. The front door had remained unlocked for him, but on the third floor he met Pee
ves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his short cuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood.

\par \lquote He is here,\rquote  said a voice behind Harry. \lquote Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.\rquote 
\par Nearly Headless Nick was gliding towards Harry, his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff.
\par \lquote I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,\rquote  said Nick. \lquote He appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.\rquote 
\par \lquote Where is he?\rquote  said Harry, his heart leaping.
\par \lquote Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it\rquote s a favourite pastime of his \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Not the Bloody Baron, Dumbledore!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh \endash  in his office,\rquote  said Nick. \lquote I believe, from what the Baron said, that he had business to attend to before turning in \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, he has,\rquote  said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him.
\par \lquote Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! The password\rquote s still \'93tapeworm\'94!\rquote 
\par But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor, and, within minutes, he was saying \lquote toffee \'e9clairs\rquote  to Dumbledore\rquote s gargoyle, which leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance on to the spiral staircase.
\par \lquote Enter,\rquote  said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded exhausted.
\par Harry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledore\rquote s office, looking the same as ever, but with black, star-strewn skies beyond the windows.
\par \lquote Good gracious, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore in surprise. \lquote To what do I owe this very late pleasure?\rquote 
\par \lquote Sir \endash  I\rquote ve got it. I\rquote ve got the memory from Slughorn.\rquote 
\par Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore. For a moment or two, the Headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile.
\par \lquote Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!\rquote 
\par All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle with Slughorn\rquote s memory in his uninjured hand and strode over to the cabinet where he kept the Pensieve.
\par \lquote And now,\rquote  said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon his desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it, \lquote now, at last, we shall see. Harry, quickly ...\rquote 
\par Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor ... once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorn\rquote s office many years before.
\par There was the much younger Horace Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, straw-coloured hair and his gingery-blond mous\-
tache, sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of crystal\-lised pineapple. And there were the half a d
ozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, Marvolo\rquote s gold and black ring gleaming on his finger.
\par Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, \lquote Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?\rquote 
\par \lquote Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn\rquote t tell you,\rquote  said Slughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same time. \lquote I must say, I\rquote 
d like to know where you get your information, boy; more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.\rquote 
\par Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admir\-ing looks.
\par \lquote What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn\rquote t, and your careful flattery of the people who matter \endash  thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you\rquote re quite right, it is my favourite \endash \rquote 
\par Several of the boys tittered again.
\par \lquote \endash  I confidently expect you to rise to Minister for Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pine\-apple. I have }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 excellent }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 contacts at the Ministry.\rquote 
\par Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know that politics would suit me, sir,\rquote  he said when the laughter had died away. \lquote I don\rquote t have the right kind of background, for one thing.\rquote 
\par A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke: undoubt\-edly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leader\rquote s famous ancestor.
\par \lquote Nonsense,\rquote  said Slughorn briskly, \lquote couldn\rquote t be plainer you come from decent wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you\rquote ll go far, Tom, I\rquote ve never been wrong about a student yet.\rquote 
\par The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn\rquote s desk chimed eleven o\rquote clock behind him and he looked round.
\par \lquote Good gracious, is it that time already? You\rquote d better get going, boys, or we\rquote ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it\rquote s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.\rquote 
\par One by one the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him made him look round; Riddle was still standing there.
\par \lquote Look sharp, Tom, you don\rquote t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Sir, I wanted to ask you something.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ask away, then, m\rquote boy, ask away ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Sir, I wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes?\rquote 
\par Slughorn stared at him, his thick fingers absent-mindedly caressing the stem of his wine glass.
\par \lquote Project for Defence Against the Dark Arts, is it?\rquote 
\par But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork.
\par \lquote Not exactly, sir,\rquote  said Riddle. \lquote I came across the term while reading and I didn\rquote t fully understand it.\rquote 
\par \lquote No ... well ... you\rquote d be hard-pushed to find a book at Hogwarts that\rquote ll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom. That\rquote s very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed,\rquote  said Slughorn.
\par \lquote But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you \endash  sorry, I mean, if you can\rquote t tell me, obviously \endash  I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could \endash  so I just thought I\rquote d ask \endash \rquote 

\par It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant peopl
e not to recognise a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working towards this moment for weeks.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystallised pineapple, \lquote well, it can\rquote 
t hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand the term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t quite understand how that works, though, sir,\rquote  said Riddle.
\par His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement.
\par \lquote Well, you split your soul, you see,\rquote  said Slughorn, \lquote and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one\rquote s body is attacked or destroyed, o
ne cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But, of course, existence in such a form ...\rquote 
\par Slughorn\rquote s face crumpled and Harry found himself remem\-bering words he had heard nearly two years before.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost ... but still, I was alive.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote ... few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.\rquote 
\par But Riddle\rquote s hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing.
\par \lquote How do you split your soul?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Slughorn uncomfortably, \lquote you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature.\rquote 
\par \lquote But how do you do it?\rquote 
\par \lquote By an act of evil \endash  the supreme act of evil. By committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: he would encase the torn portion \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Encase? But how \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote There is a spell, do not ask me, I don\rquote t know!\rquote  said Slughorn, shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. \lquote Do I look as though I have tried it \endash  do I look like a killer?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, sir, of course not,\rquote  said Riddle quickly. \lquote I\rquote m sorry ... I didn\rquote t mean to offend ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Not at all, not at all, not offended,\rquote  said Slughorn gruffly. \lquote It\rquote s natural to feel some curiosity about these things ... wizards of a certain calibre have always been drawn to that aspect of magic ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, sir,\rquote  said Riddle. \lquote What I don\rquote t understand, though \endash  just out of curiosity \endash  I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn\rquote 
t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces? I mean, for instance, isn\rquote t seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn\rquote t seven \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Merlin\rquote s beard, Tom!\rquote  yelped Slughorn. \lquote Seven! Isn\rquote t it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case ... bad enough to divide the soul ... but to rip it into seven pieces ...\rquote 
\par Slughorn looked deeply troubled now: he was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the con\-versation at all.
\par \lquote Of course,\rquote  he muttered, \lquote this is all hypothetical, what we\rquote re discussing, isn\rquote t it? All academic ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, sir, of course,\rquote  said Riddle quickly.
\par \lquote But all the same, Tom ... keep it quiet, what I\rquote ve told \endash  that\rquote s to say, what we\rquote ve discussed. People wouldn\rquote t like to think we\rquote ve been chatting about Horcruxes. It\rquote 
s a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know ... Dumbledore\rquote s particularly fierce about it ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I won\rquote t say a word, sir,\rquote 
 said Riddle and he left, but not before Harry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wizard, the sort of happiness that did not enhanc
e his handsome features, but made them, somehow, less human ...
\par \lquote Thank you, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly. \lquote Let us go ...\rquote 
\par When Harry landed back on the office floor, Dumbledore was already sitting down behind his desk. Harry sat too, and waited for Dumbledore to speak.
\par \lquote I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,\rquote  said Dumbledore at last. \lquote It confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go ...\rquote 

\par Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red-nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear-trumpet.
\par \lquote Well, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal.
\rquote 
\par \lquote You think he succeeded then, sir?\rquote  asked Harry. \lquote He made a Horcrux? And that\rquote s why he didn\rquote t die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?\rquote 
\par \lquote A bit ... or more,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote You heard Voldemort: what he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what w
ould happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxes. N
o book would have given him that information. As far as I know \endash  as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew \endash  no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshalling his thoughts, and then said, \lquote Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul.\rquote 
\par \lquote Where?\rquote  asked Harry. \lquote How?\rquote 
\par \lquote You handed it to me, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote The diary, Riddle\rquote s diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t understand, sir,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never witnessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the life out of th
e girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book ... a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. What intrigued and alarmed 
me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.\rquote 
\par \lquote I still don\rquote t understand,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work \endash  in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had und
oubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else, so that Slytherin\rquote 
s monster would be unleashed again.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, he didn\rquote t want his hard work to be wasted,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote He wanted people to know he was Slytherin\rquote s heir, because he couldn\rquote t take credit at the time.\rquote 
\par \lquote Quite correct,\rquote  said Dumbledore, nodding. \lquote But don\rquote t you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blas\'e9
 about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else\rquote 
s path and run the risk that they might destroy it \endash  as indeed happened: that particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that.
\par \lquote The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made \endash  or been planning to make \endash 
 more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense.
\par \lquote Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \'93I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.\'94 }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 That was wha
t you told me he said. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \'93Further than anybody.\'94 }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I do not believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lo
rd Voldemort had seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call usual evil ...\rquote 
\par \lquote So he\rquote s made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Why couldn\rquote t he make a Philosopher\rquote s Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote But there are several reasons why, I think, a Philosopher\rquote s Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort.
\par \lquote While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must be drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain his immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependent on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contamin\-
ated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being depen
dent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue t
o rely on his Horcruxes: he would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you see ... or as close to immortal as any man can be.
\par \lquote But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Harry: \'93Wouldn\rquote 
t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces ... isn\rquote t seven the most powerfully magical number ...\'94 }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Isn\rquote 
t seven the most powerfully magical number. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.\rquote 
\par \lquote He made }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 seven }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Horcruxes?\rquote 
 said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage. \lquote But they could be anywhere in the world \endash  hidden \endash  buried or invisible \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the prob\-lem,\rquote  said Dumbledore calmly. \lquote But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part o
f his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wis
hing to kill Voldemort must attack \endash  the piece that lives in his body.\rquote 
\par \lquote But the six Horcruxes, then,\rquote  said Harry, a little desperately, \lquote how are we supposed to find them?\rquote 
\par \lquote You are forgetting ... you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.\rquote 
\par \lquote You have?\rquote  said Harry eagerly.
\par \lquote Yes indeed,\rquote  said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. \lquote The ring, Harry. Marvolo\rquote s ring. And a terrible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been \endash  forgive me the lack of seemly modesty 
\endash  for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape\rquote 
s timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of Voldemort\rquote s soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.\rquote 

\par \lquote But how did you find it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, as you now know, I have made it my business for many years to discover as much as I can about Voldemort\rquote s past life. I have travelled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I s
tumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunts\rquote  house. It seems that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it, he did not want to wear it any more. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchant\-
ments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment.

\par \lquote However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heart\-ily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.\rquote 
\par \lquote And they could be anything?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote They could be old tin cans, or, I dunno, empty potion bottles ...?\rquote 
\par \lquote You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordin\-ary objects, easy to overlook. But Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have shown you. Lord Voldemort liked to c
ollect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history. His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chos
en his Horcruxes with some care, favouring objects worthy of the honour.\rquote 
\par \lquote The diary wasn\rquote t that special.\rquote 
\par \lquote The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the heir of Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.\rquote 
\par \lquote So, the other Horcruxes?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Do you think you know what they are, sir?\rquote 
\par \lquote I can only guess,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote For the reasons I have already given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort\rquote 
s past to see if I can find evidence that such artefacts have disappeared around him.\rquote 
\par \lquote The locket!\rquote  said Harry loudly. \lquote Hufflepuff\rquote s cup!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling, \lquote I would be prepared to bet \endash  perhaps not my other hand \endash 
 but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and S
lytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort\rquote 
s imagination. I cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw\rquote s. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case.
\par \lquote Do you think that\rquote s why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote To try and find something from one of the other founders?\rquote 
\par \lquote My thoughts precisely,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote But unfortun\-ately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without t
he chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders\rquote  objects. He definitely had two \endash  he may have found three \endash  that is the best we can do for now.\rquote 
\par \lquote Even if he got something of Ravenclaw\rquote s or of Gryffindor\rquote s, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,\rquote  said Harry, counting on his fingers. \lquote Unless he got both?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think so,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behaviour of the snake, Nagini?\rquote 
\par \lquote The snake?\rquote  said Harry, startled. \lquote You can use animals as Horcruxes?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, it is inadvisable to do so,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote because to confide a part of your soul to somet
hing that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents\rquote 
 house with the intention of killing you.
\par \lquote He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would cer\-
tainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death.
\par \lquote As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his las
t Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemort\rquote 
s mystique. I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.\rquote 
\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote the diary\rquote s gone, the ring\rquote s gone. The cup, the locket and the snake are still intact and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw\rquote s or Gryffindor\rquote s?\rquote 
\par \lquote An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore, bowing his head.
\par \lquote So ... are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you\rquote ve been going when you\rquote ve been leaving the school?\rquote 
\par \lquote Correct,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I have been looking for a very long time. I think ... perhaps ... I may be close to finding another one. There are hopeful signs.\rquote 
\par \lquote And if you do,\rquote  said Harry quickly, \lquote can I come with you and help get rid of it?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, \lquote Yes, I think so.\rquote 
\par \lquote I can?\rquote  said Harry, thoroughly taken aback.
\par \lquote Oh yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. \lquote I think you have earned that right.\rquote 
\par Harry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore\rquote 
s decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted.
\par \lquote Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?\rquote  Harry asked, ignoring the portraits.
\par \lquote A very interesting 
question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss ... but he was
 not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.\rquote 

\par \lquote But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemort\rquote s say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort vanished sh
ortly after giving him the diary. No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius\rquote 
s fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed de
ad. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen, because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master\rquote 
s soul in his hands he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence \endash  but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends: by planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley\rquote 
s daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur, have me thrown out of Hogwarts and get rid of a highly incriminating object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius ... what with Voldemort\rquote 
s fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.\rquote 
\par Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, \lquote So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 could }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 be killed?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I think so,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a
 maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical power remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort, even without his Horcruxes.\rquote 

\par \lquote But I haven\rquote t got uncommon skill and power,\rquote  said Harry, before he could stop himself.
\par \lquote Yes, you have,\rquote  said Dumbledore firmly. \lquote You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I know!\rquote  said Harry impatiently. \lquote I can love!\rquote  It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, \lquote Big deal!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Harry, you can love,\rquote  said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \lquote Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thi
ng. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote So, when the prophecy says that I\rquote ll have \'93power the Dark Lord knows not\'94, it just means \endash  love?\rquote  asked Harry, feeling a little let down.
\par \lquote Yes \endash  just love,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote But Harry
, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him \endash  and in doing so, he }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 made }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you the person who would be most dangerous to him!\rquote 
\par \lquote But it comes to the same \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, it doesn\rquote t!\rquote  said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, \lquote You are setting too much store by the prophecy!\rquote 
\par \lquote But,\rquote  spluttered Harry, \lquote but you said the prophecy means \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?\rquote 
\par \lquote But,\rquote  said Harry, bewildered, \lquote but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney\rquote s words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have impar
ted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don\rquote 
t you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, ju
st as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realise that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always
 he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!\rquote 
\par \lquote But \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It is essential that you understand this!\rquote  said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. \lquote 
By attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort\rquote s fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even under
\-stand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort\rquote 
s world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemort\rquote s followers!\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course I haven\rquote t!\rquote  said Harry indignantly. \lquote He killed my mum and dad!\rquote 
\par \lquote You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!\rquote  said Dumbledore loudly. \lquote The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort\rquote s! In spite of all the temptation you
 have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart\rquote 
s desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or ric
hes. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not!
\par \lquote But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort\rquote s mind without damage to yourse
lf, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul th
at is untarnished and whole.\rquote 
\par \lquote But, sir,\rquote  said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, \lquote it all comes to the same thing, doesn\rquote t it? I\rquote ve got to try and kill him, or \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Got to?\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Of course you\rquote ve got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you\rquote 
ve tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!\rquote 
\par Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and 
down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.
\par \lquote I\rquote d want him finished,\rquote  said Harry quietly. \lquote And I\rquote d want to do it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course you would!\rquote  cried Dumbledore. \lquote You see, the prophecy does not mean you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 have }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 mark you as his equal ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699  in other words, you are fr
ee to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you ... which makes it certain, really, that \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That one of us is going to end up killing the other,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Yes.\rquote 
\par But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been try\-ing to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, pe
rhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew \endash  and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents \endash  that there was all the difference in the world.

\par \lquote Ron, you\rquote re making it snow,\rquote  said Hermione patiently, grab\-bing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which, sure enough, large white flakes had started to fall. Lavender Brown, Harry noticed, glare

\par \lquote Oh yeah,\rquote  said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise. \lquote Sorry ... looks like we\rquote ve all got horrible dandruff now ...\rquote 
\par He brushed some of the fake snow off Hermione\rquote s shoulder. Lavender burst into tears. Ron looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her.
\par \lquote We split up,\rquote  he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth. \lquote Last night. When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione. Obviously she couldn\rquote t see you, so she thought it had just been the two of us.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Well \endash  you don\rquote t mind it\rquote s over, do you?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  Ron admitted. \lquote It was pretty bad while she was yelling, but at least I didn\rquote t have to finish it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Coward,\rquote  said Hermione, though she looked amused. \lquote Well, it was a bad night for romance all round. Ginny and Dean split up too, Harry.\rquote 
\par Harry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she told him that, but she could not possibly know that his insides were suddenly dancing the conga: keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could, he asked, \lquote 
How come?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, something really silly ... she said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole, like she couldn\rquote t climb in herself ... but they\rquote ve been a bit rocky for ages.\rquote 
\par Harry glanced over at Dean on the other side of the class\-room. He certainly looked unhappy.
\par \lquote Of course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, doesn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean?\rquote  said Harry quickly.
\par \lquote The Quidditch team,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote If Ginny and Dean aren\rquote t speaking ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh \endash  oh yeah,\rquote  said Harry.

\rquote 
\par Harry stared: it was indeed Katie Bell, looking completely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friends.
\par \lquote I\rquote m really well!\rquote  she said happily. \lquote They let me out of St Mungo\rquote s on Monday, I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came back here this morning

\par He had to put the question to her at once; his curiosity even drove Ginny temporarily from his brain. He dropped his voice as Katie\rquote s friends started gathering up their things; apparently they were late for Transfiguration.
\par \lquote ... that necklace ... can you remember who gave it to you now?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Katie, shaking her head ruefully. \lquote Everyone\rquote s been asking me, but I haven\rquote t got a clue. The last thing I remember was walking into the ladies\rquote  in the Three Broomsticks.\rquote 
\par \lquote You definitely went into the bathroom, then?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Well, I know I pushed open the door,\rquote  said Katie, \lquote so I sup\-pose whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it. After that, my memory\rquote s a blank until about two weeks ago in St Mungo\rquote s. Listen, I\rquote

\par She caught up her bag and books and hurried after her friends, leaving Harry, Ron and Hermione to sit down at a window table and ponder what she had told them.
\par \lquote So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote to be in the ladies\rquote  bathroom.\rquote 
\par \lquote Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Don\rquote t forget, there was a cauldronful of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts. We know some of it got stolen ...\rquote

out of his bag and looked up Felix Felicis.
\par \lquote Blimey, it\rquote s seriously complicated,\rquote  he said, running an eye down the list of ingredients. \lquote And it takes six months ... you\rquote ve got to let it stew ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Typical,\rquote  said Ron.
\par Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Sectumsempra }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 spell, captioned \lquote For Enemies\rquote 
, that he had marked a few weeks previously. He had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it around Hermione, but he was considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up behind him unawares.
\par The only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thomas, because he would no longer be required to fill her place as Chaser. He took the blow stoically enough when Harry told him, merel
y grunting and shrugging, but Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back.
\par The following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry had known as Captain. His team was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have Katie back at last, that they were flying extremely well.
\par Ginny did not seem at all upset about the break-up with Dean; on the contrary, she was the life and soul of the team. Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing up an
d down in front of the goalposts as the Quaffle sped towards him, or of Harry bellowing orders at McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them all highly amused. Harry, laughing with the others, was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny; h
e had received several more Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the Snitch.
\par The battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron? Some\-times he thought that the post-Lavender Ron might not mind too much if he asked Ginny out, but then he remembered Ron\rquote 
s expression when he had seen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held her hand ...
\par Yet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing with her, walking 
back from practice with her; however much his conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own: it would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another of his little parties, for Ron would not be around \endash 
 but unfortunately, Slughorn seemed to have given them up. Once or twice Harry considered asking for Hermione\rquote 
s help, but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny, or laughing at her jokes. And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didn
\rquote t do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon: he and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good.
\par All in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was becoming stronger by the day, for surely this was a case for, as Hermione put it, \lquote tweaking the circumstances\rquote 
? The balmy days slid gently through May, and Ron seemed to be there at Harry\rquote s shoulder every time he saw Ginny. Harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would some\-
how cause Ron to realise that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together f
or longer than a few seconds. There seemed no chance of either while the final Quidditch game of the season was looming; Ron wanted to talk tactics with Harry all the time and had little thought for anything else.
\par Ron was not unique in this respect; interest in the Gryffindor\endash 
Ravenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the school, for the match would decide the championship, which was still wide open. If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had 
never known his team fly better) then they would win the championship. If they won by less than three hundred points, they would come second to Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than
 a hundred, they would be in fourth place and nobody, Harry thought, would ever, ever let him forget that it had been he who had cap\-tained Gryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries.
\par The run-up to this crucial match had all the u
sual features: members of rival houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors; unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attent
ion or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up. Somehow, the game had become inextricably linked in Harry\rquote 
s mind with success or failure in his plans for Ginny. He could not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points, the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud after-match party might be just as good as a hearty swig of Felix Felicis.
\par In the midst of all his preoccupations Harry had not for\-gotten his other ambition: finding out what Malfoy was up to in the Room of Requirement. He was still checking the Marauder\rquote 
s Map and, as he was often unable to locate Malfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy was still spending plenty of time within the Room. Although Harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the Room, he a
ttempted it whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how he reworded his request, the wall remained firmly doorless.
\par A few days before the match against Ravenclaw, Harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the com\-mon room, Ron having rus
hed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last Arithmancy essay. More out of habit than anything, Harry made his usual detour along t
he seventh-floor corridor, checking the Marauder\rquote s Map as he went. For a moment he could not find Malfoy anywhere, and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoy\rquote 
s tiny, labelled dot standing in a boys\rquote  bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle.
\par Harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armour. The loud crash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Filc
h should turn up, he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door. He couldn\rquote t hear anything. He very quietly pushed the door open.
\par Draco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching either side of the sink, his white-blond head bowed.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t,\rquote  crooned Moaning Myrtle\rquote s voice from one of the cubicles. \lquote Don\rquote t ... tell me what\rquote s wrong ... I can help you ...\rquote 
\par \lquote No one can help me,\rquote  said Malfoy. His whole body was shaking. \lquote I can\rquote t do it ... I can\rquote t ... it won\rquote t work ... and unless I do it soon ... he says he\rquote ll kill me ...\rquote 
\par And Harry realised, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot, that Malfoy was crying \endash  actually crying \endash  tears streaming down his 
pale face into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into the cracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his shoulder.
\par Malfoy wheeled round, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulled out his own. Malfoy\rquote s hex missed Harry by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside him; Harry threw himself sideways, thought }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Levicorpus! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 and flicked his wand, but Malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another \endash 
\par \lquote No! No! Stop it!\rquote  squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echo\-ing loudly around the tiled room. \lquote Stop! STOP!\rquote 
\par There was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry exploded; Harry attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that backfired off the wall behind Malfoy\rquote s ear and smashed the cistern ben
eath Moaning Myrtle, who screamed loudly; water poured everywhere and Harry slipped over as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, \lquote Cruci\emdash \rquote 
\par \lquote SECTUMSEMPRA!\rquote  bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his wand wildly.
\par Blood spurted from Malfoy\rquote s face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword. He staggered back\-wards and collapsed on to the waterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand falling from his limp right hand.
\par \lquote No \endash \rquote  gasped Harry.
\par Slipping and staggering, Harry got to his feet and plunged towards Malfoy, whose face was now shining scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood-soaked chest.
\par \lquote No \endash  I didn\rquote t \endash \rquote 
\par Harry did not know what he was saying; he fell to his knees beside Malfoy, who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood. Moaning Myrtle let out a deafening scream.
\par \lquote MURDER! MURDER IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!\rquote 
\par The door banged open behind Harry and he looked up, terrified: Snape had burst into the room, his face livid. Push\-ing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand and traced it over the deep wounds Harry\rquote 
s curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song. The flow of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoy\rquote s face and repeated his spell. Now the wounds seemed to be knitting.
\par Harry was still watching, horrified by what he had done, barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and water. Moaning Myrtle was still sobbing and wailing overhead. When Snape had performed his counter-curse for the third time, he half-lifted Ma
lfoy into a standing position.
\par \lquote You need the hospital wing. There may be a certain amount of scarring, but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that ... come ...\rquote 
\par He supported Malfoy across the bathroom, turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury, \lquote And you, Potter ... you wait here for me.\rquote 
\par It did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey. He stood up slowly, shaking, and looked down at the wet floor. There were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface. He could n
ot even find it in himself to tell Moaning Myrtle to be quiet, as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident enjoyment.
\par Snape returned ten minutes later. He stepped into the bath\-room and closed the door behind him.
\par \lquote Go,\rquote  he said to Myrtle and she swooped back into her toilet at once, leaving a ringing silence behind her.
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t mean it to happen,\rquote  said Harry at once. His voice echoed in the cold, watery space. \lquote I didn\rquote t know what that spell did.\rquote 
\par But Snape ignored this.
\par \lquote Apparently I underestimated you, Potter,\rquote  he said quietly. \lquote Who would have thought you knew such Dark magic? Who taught you that spell?\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  read about it somewhere.\rquote 
\par \lquote Where?\rquote 
\par \lquote It was \endash  a library book,\rquote  Harry invented wildly. \lquote I can\rquote t remember what it was call\emdash \rquote 
\par \lquote Liar,\rquote  said Snape. Harry\rquote s throat went dry. He knew what Snape was going to do and he had never been able to prevent it ...
\par The bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes; he struggled to block out all thought, but try as he might, the Half-Blood Prince\rquote s copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699

\par And then he was staring at Snape again, in the midst of this wrecked, soaked bathroom. He stared into Snape\rquote s black eyes, hoping against hope that Snape had not seen what he feared, but \endash 
\par \lquote Bring me your schoolbag,\rquote  said Snape softly, \lquote and all of your school books. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 All }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 of them. Bring them to me here. Now!\rquote 
\par There was no point arguing. Harry turned at once and splashed out of the bathroom. Once in the corridor, he broke into a run towards Gryffindor Tower. Most people were walk\-
ing the other way; they gaped at him drenched in water and blood, but he answered none of the questions fired at him as he ran past.
\par He felt stunned; it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly savage. What had the Prince been thinking to copy such a spell into his book? And what would happen when Snape saw it? Would he tell Slughorn \endash  Harry\rquote s stomach churned 
\endash  how Harry had been achieving such good results in Potions all year? Would he confiscate or destroy the book that had taught Harry so much ... the book that had become a kind of guide and friend? Harry could not let it happen ... he could not ...

\par \lquote But what about the Half-Blood \endash ?\rquote

\par Ron pulled his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Advanced Potion-Making }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 out of his bag and handed 
it over; Harry sprinted off past him and back to the common room. Here, he seized his schoolbag, ignoring the amazed looks of several people who had already finished their dinner, threw himself back out of the portrait hole and hurtled off along the seven
th-floor corridor.
\par He skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls, closed his eyes and began to walk.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 I need a place to hide my book ... I need a place to hide my book ... I need a place to hide my book ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par Three times he walked up and down in front of the stretch of blank wall. When he opened his eyes, there it was at last: the door to the Room of Requirement. Harry wrenched it open, flung himself inside and slammed it shut.
\par He gasped. Despite his haste, his panic, his fear of what awaited him b
ack in the bathroom, he could not help but be overawed by what he was looking at. He was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral, whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls, built of what
 
Harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants. There were alleyways and roads bordered by teetering piles of broken and damaged furniture, stowed away, perhaps, to hide the evidence of mishandled magic, or else hidden by castle-
p
roud house-elves. There were thousands and thousands of books, no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen. There were winged catapults and Fanged Frisbees, some still with enough life in them to hover half-heartedly over the mountains of other forbidden item
s; there were chipped bottles of con\-gealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; there were what looked like dragon-egg shells, corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting swords and a heavy, blood\-stained axe.
\par Harry hurried forwards int
o one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure. He turned right past an enormous stuffed troll, ran on a short way, took a left at the broken Vanishing Cabinet in which Montague had got lost the previous year, finally pausing beside a large 
cupboard which seemed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface. He opened one of the cupboard\rquote 
s creaking doors: it had already been used as a hiding place for something in a cage that had long-since died; its skeleton had five legs. He stuffed the Half-Blood Prince\rquote 
s book behind the cage and slammed the door. He paused for a moment, his heart thump\-ing horribly, gazing around at the clutter ... would he be able to find this spot again, amidst all this junk? Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old war
lock from on top of a nearby crate, he stood it on the cupboard where the book was now hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statue\rquote 
s head to make it more distinctive, then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go, back to the door, back out on to the corridor, where he slammed the door behind him and it turned at once back into stone.
\par Harry ran flat out towards the bathroom on the floor below, cramming Ron\rquote s copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Advanced Potion-Making }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 into his bag as he did so. A minute later, he was back in front of Snape, who held out his hand wordlessly for Harry\rquote 
s schoolbag. Harry handed it over, panting, a searing pain in his chest, and waited.
\par One by one Snape extracted Harry\rquote s books and examined them. Finally the only book left was the Potions book, which he looked at very carefully before speaking.

\par \lquote I \endash  I don\rquote t agree, sir,\rquote  said Harry, still refusing to look into Snape\rquote s eyes.
\par \lquote Well, we shall see how you feel after your detentions,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote Ten o\rquote clock Saturday morning, Potter. My office.\rquote 
\par \lquote But, sir ...\rquote  said Harry, looking up desperately. \lquote Quidditch ... the last match of the \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ten o\rquote clock,\rquote  whispered Snape, with a smile that showed his yellow teeth. \lquote Poor Gryffindor ... fourth place this year, I fear ...\rquote 
\par And he left the bathroom without another word, leaving Harry to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling sicker, he was sure, than Ron had ever felt in his life.
\par \lquote I won\rquote t say \'93I told you so\'94,\rquote  said Hermione, an hour later in the common room.
\par \lquote Leave it, Hermione,\rquote  said Ron angrily.
\par Harry had never made it to dinner; he had no appetite at all. He had just finished telling Ron, Hermione and Ginny what had happened, not that there seemed to have been much need. The news had travelled very fast: apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it up
o
n herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story; Malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no time in vilifying Harry far and wide, and Snape had told the staff precisely what had happened:
 Harry had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor McGonagall, who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported whole-heartedly Snape\rquote 
s punishment of detention every Saturday until the end of term.
\par \lquote I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person,\rquote  Hermione said, evidently unable to stop herself. \lquote And I was right, wasn\rquote t I?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I don\rquote t think you were,\rquote  said Harry stubbornly.
\par He was having a bad enough time without Hermione lecturing him; the looks on the Gryffindor team\rquote s faces when he had told them he would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of all. He could feel Ginny\rquote 
s eyes on him now, but did not meet them; he 
did not want to see disappointment or anger there. He had just told her that she would be playing Seeker on Saturday and that Dean would be rejoining the team as Chaser in her place. Perhaps, if they won, Ginny and Dean would make up during the post-match
 euphoria ... the thought went through Harry like an icy knife ...
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote how can you still stick up for that book when that spell \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Will you stop harping on about the book!\rquote  snapped Harry. \lquote The Prince only copied it out! It\rquote s not like he was advising anyone to use it! For all we know, he was making a note of something that had been used against him!
\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t believe this,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote You\rquote re actually defending \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not defending what I did!\rquote  said Harry quickly. \lquote I wish I hadn\rquote t done it, and not just because I\rquote ve got about a dozen detentions. You know I wouldn\rquote t\rquote 
ve used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you can\rquote t blame the Prince, he hadn\rquote t written \'93Try this out, it\rquote s really good\'94 \endash  he was just making notes for himself, wasn\rquote t he, not for anyone else ...\rquote 

\par \lquote Are you telling me,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote that you\rquote re going to go back \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote And get the book? Yeah, I am,\rquote  said Harry forcefully. \lquote Listen, without the Prince I\rquote d never have won the Felix Felicis. I\rquote d never have known how to save Ron from poisoning, I\rquote d never have \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don\rquote t deserve,\rquote  said Hermione nastily.
\par \lquote Give it a rest, Hermione!\rquote  said Ginny, and Harry was so amazed, so grateful, he looked up. \lquote By the sound of it Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Harry had something good up his sleeve!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, of course I\rquote m glad Harry wasn\rquote t cursed!\rquote  said Hermione, clearly stung, \lquote but you can\rquote t call that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Sectumsempra }{

\par \lquote Oh, don\rquote t start acting as though you understand Quid\-ditch,\rquote  snapped Ginny, \lquote you\rquote ll only embarrass yourself.\rquote 
\par Harry and Ron stared: Hermione and Ginny, who had always got on together very well, were now sitting with their arms folded, glaring in opposite directions. Ron looked ner\-
vously at Harry, then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it. Harry, however, though he knew he little deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening.
\par His light-heartedness was short-lived. There were Slytherin taunts to be endured next day, not to mention much anger from fellow Gryffindors, who were most 
unhappy that their Captain had got himself banned from the final match of the season. By Saturday morning, whatever he might have told Hermione, Harry would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch
 with Ron, Ginny and the others. It was almost unbear\-
able to turn away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine, all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves, to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and wa
lk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated, knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary, or a cheer or groan.
\par \lquote Ah, Potter,\rquote  said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were sus\-
pended in coloured potions all around the walls. Ominously, there were many cobwebbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was clearly supposed to sit; they had an aura of tedious, hard and pointless work about them.
\par \lquote Mr Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files,\rquote  said Snape softly. \lquote They are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments. W
here the ink has grown faint, or the cards have suffered damage from mice, we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and, making sure that they are in alphabetical order, replace them in the boxes. You will not use magic.\rquote 

\par \lquote Right, Professor,\rquote  said Harry, with as much contempt as he could put into the last three syllables.
\par \lquote I thought you could start,\rquote  said Snape, a malicious smile on his lips, \lquote with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fifty-six. You will find some familiar
 names in there, which should add interest to the task. Here, you see ...\rquote 
\par He pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote \'93
James Potter and Sirius Black. Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey. Aubrey\rquote s head twice normal size. Double detention.\'94\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Snape sneered. 
\lquote It must be such a comfort to think that, though they are gone, a record of their great achievements remains ...\rquote 
\par Harry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach. Biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one towards him.
\par It was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or Sirius\rquote s names, usually coupled together in various petty mis\-
deeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. And while he copied out all their various offences and punishments, he wondered what was going on outside,
 where the match would have just started ... Ginny playing Seeker against Cho ...
\par Harry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall. It seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock; perhaps Snape had bewitched it to go extra slowl
y? He could not have been here for only half an hour ... an hour ... an hour and a half ...
\par Harry\rquote s stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve. Snape, who had not spoken at all since set\-ting Harry his task, finally looked up at ten past one.
\par \lquote I think that will do,\rquote  he said coldly. \lquote Mark the place you have reached. You will continue at ten o\rquote clock next Saturday.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, sir.\rquote 
\par Harry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before Snape could change his mind, racing back up the stone steps, straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch, but all was quiet ... it was over, then ...
\par He hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall, then ran up the marble staircase; whether Gryffindor had won or lost, the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own com\-mon room.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Quid agis?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
he said tentatively to the Fat Lady, wondering what he would find inside.
\par Her expression was unreadable as she replied, \lquote You\rquote ll see.\rquote 
\par And she swung forwards.
\par A roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her. Harry gaped as people began to scream at the sight of him; several hands pulled him into the room.
\par \lquote We won!\rquote  yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at Harry. \lquote We won! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We won!\rquote 
\par Harry looked around; there was Ginny running towards him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watch\-
ing, Harry kissed her.
\par After several long moments \endash  or it might have been half an hour \endash  or possibly several sunlit days \endash  they broke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Harr
y looked over the top of Ginny\rquote s head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something. Hermione was beaming, but Harry\rquote 
s eyes sought Ron. At last he found him, still clutching the Cup an
d wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean, \lquote Well \endash  if you must.\rquote 
\par The creature in his chest roaring in triumph, Harry grinned down at Ginny and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole. A long walk in the grounds seemed indicated, during which \endash  if they had time \endash  they might discuss the match.

The fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people, most of them girls, yet Harry found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks. After all, it made a very nice change to b
e talked about because of something that was making him happier than he could remember being for a very long time, rather than because he had been involved in hor\-rific scenes of Dark magic.

\par \lquote You filthy hypocrite! What about you and Lavender, thrash\-ing around like a pair of eels all over the place?\rquote  demanded Ginny.
\par But Ron\rquote s tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into June, for Harry and Ginny\rquote s time together was becoming increasingly restricted. Ginny\rquote 
s O.W.L.s were approaching and she was therefore forced to revise for hours into the night. On one such evening, when Ginny had retired to the library and Harry was sitting beside the window in the common room, supposedly finishing his Herbology home\-
work but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ginny at lunch-time, Hermione dropped into the seat between him and Ron with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face.
\par \lquote I want to talk to you, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote What about?\rquote  said Harry suspiciously. Only the previous day, Hermione had told him off for distracting Ginny when she ought to be working hard for her examinations.
\par \lquote The so-called Half-Blood Prince.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, not again,\rquote  he groaned. \lquote Will you please drop it?\rquote 
\par He had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve his book, and his performance in Potions was suffer\-
ing accordingly (though Slughorn, who approved of Ginny, had jocularly attributed this to Harry being lovesick). But Harry was sure that Snape had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the Prince\rquote 
s book, and was determined to leave it where it was while Snape remained on the lookout.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not dropping it,\rquote  said Hermione firmly, \lquote until you\rquote ve heard me out. Now, I\rquote ve been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing Dark spells \endash \rquote

\par Harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph, yellowed with age;
 Ron leaned over for a look, too. The picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen. She was not pretty; she looked simultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy brows and a long, pallid face. Under\-neath the photograph was the caption: }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par \lquote Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione ...\rquote 
\par \lquote But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!\rquote 
\par \lquote Listen, Hermione, I can tell it\rquote s not a girl. I can just tell.\rquote 
\par \lquote The truth is that you don\rquote t think a girl would have been clever enough,\rquote  said Hermione angrily.
\par \lquote How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever?\rquote  said Harry, stung by this. \lquote It\rquote s the way he writes. I just know the Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn\rquote

\par \lquote The library,\rquote  said Hermione, predictably. \lquote There\rquote s a whole collection of old }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Prophets }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote I will,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote And the first place I\rquote ll look,\rquote  she shot at him, as she reached the portrait hole, \lquote is records of old Potions awards!\rquote 
\par Harry scowled after her for a moment, then continued his contemplation of the darkening sky.
\par \lquote She\rquote s just never got over you outperforming her in Potions,\rquote  said Ron, returning to his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.}{

\par \lquote But he healed all right, didn\rquote t he? Back on his feet in no time.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry; this was perfectly true, although his con\-science squirmed slightly all the same. \lquote Thanks to Snape ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You still got detention with Snape this Saturday?\rquote  Ron continued.
\par \lquote Yeah, and the Saturday after that, and the Saturday after that,\rquote  sighed Harry. \lquote And he\rquote s hinting now that if I don\rquote t get all the boxes done by the end of term, we\rquote ll carry on next year.\rquote 
\par He was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with Ginny. Indeed, he had frequently won\-
dered lately whether Snape did not know this, for he was keeping Harry later and later every time, while making pointed asides about Harry having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered.
\par Harry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance at his side of Jimmy Peakes, who was holding out a scroll of parchment.
\par \lquote Thanks, Jimmy ... hey, it\rquote s from Dumbledore!\rquote  said Harry excitedly, unrolling the parchment and scanning it. \lquote He wants me to go to his office as quick as I can!\rquote 
\par They stared at each other.
\par \lquote Blimey,\rquote  whispered Ron. \lquote You don\rquote t reckon ... he hasn\rquote t found ...?\rquote 
\par \lquote Better go and see, hadn\rquote t I?\rquote  said Harry, jumping to his feet.
\par He hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as he could, passing nobody but Peeves, who swooped past in the opposite direction, throwing bits of chalk at Harry in a routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged Harry
\rquote s defensive jinx. Once Peeves had vanished, there was silence in the corridors; with only fifteen minutes left until curfew, most people had already returned to their common rooms.
\par And then Harry heard a scream and a crash. He stopped in his tracks, listening.
\par \lquote How \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 dare \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you \endash  aaaaargh!\rquote 
\par The noise was coming from a corridor
 nearby; Harry sprinted towards it, his wand at the ready, hurtled round another corner and saw Professor Trelawney sprawled upon the floor, her head covered in one of her many shawls, several sherry bottles lying beside her, one broken.
\par \lquote Professor \endash \rquote 
\par Harry hurried forwards and helped Professor Trelawney to her feet. Some of her glittering beads had become entangled with her glasses. She hiccoughed loudly, patted her hair and pulled herself up on Harry\rquote s helping arm.
\par \lquote What happened, Professor?\rquote 
\par \lquote You may well ask!\rquote  she said shrilly. \lquote I was strolling along, brooding upon certain Dark portents I happen to have glimpsed ...\rquote

\par \lquote I \endash  well \endash  I didn\rquote t know students knew about \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Not all of them do,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote But what happened? You screamed ... it sounded as though you were hurt ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  well,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, drawing her shawls around her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eyes. \lquote I wished to \endash  ah \endash  deposit certain \endash  um \endash 
 personal items in the Room ...\rquote  And she muttered something about \lquote nasty accusations\rquote .
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry, glancing down at the sherry bottles. \lquote But you couldn\rquote t get in and hide them?\rquote 
\par He found this very odd; the Room had opened for him, after all, when he had wanted to hide the Half-Blood Prince\rquote s book.
\par \lquote Oh, I got in all right,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, glaring at the wall. \lquote But there was somebody already in there.\rquote 
\par \lquote Somebody in \endash ? Who?\rquote  demanded Harry. \lquote Who was in there?\rquote 
\par \lquote I have no idea,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in Harry\rquote s voice. \lquote I walked into the Room and I heard a voice, which has never happened before in all my years of hiding \endash 
 of using the Room, I mean.\rquote 
\par \lquote A voice? Saying what?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know that it was saying anything,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney. \lquote It was ... whooping.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Whooping?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote Gleefully,\rquote  she said, nodding.
\par Harry stared at her.
\par \lquote Was it male or female?\rquote 
\par \lquote I would hazard a guess at male,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney.
\par \lquote And it sounded happy?\rquote 
\par \lquote Very happy,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney sniffily.
\par \lquote As though it was celebrating?\rquote 
\par \lquote Most definitely.\rquote 
\par \lquote And then \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote And then I called out, \'93Who\rquote s there?\'94\rquote 
\par \lquote You couldn\rquote t have found out who it was without asking?\rquote  Harry asked her, slightly frustrated.
\par \lquote The Inner Eye,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney with dignity, straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads, \lquote was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry hastily; he had heard about Professor Trelawney\rquote s Inner Eye all too often before. \lquote And did the voice say who was there?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, it did not,\rquote  she said. \lquote Everything went pitch black and the next thing I knew, I was being hurled headfirst out of the Room!\rquote 
\par \lquote And you didn\rquote t see that coming?\rquote  said Harry, unable to help himself.
\par \lquote No, I did not, as I say, it was pitch \endash \rquote  She stopped and glared at him suspiciously.
\par \lquote I think you\rquote d better tell Professor Dumbledore,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote He ought to know Malfoy\rquote s celebrating \endash  I mean, that some\-one threw you out of the Room.\rquote 
\par To his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion, looking haughty.
\par \lquote The Headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me,\rquote  she said coldly. \lquote I am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it. If Dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show \endash \rquote 

\par Her bony hand closed suddenly around Harry\rquote s wrist.
\par \lquote Again and again, no matter how I lay them out \endash \rquote 
\par And she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her shawls.
\par \lquote \endash  the lightning-struck tower,\rquote  she whispered. \lquote Calamity. Disaster. Coming nearer all the time ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry again. \lquote Well ... I still think you should tell Dumbledore about this voice and everything going dark and being thrown out of the Room ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You think so?\rquote  Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment, but Harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure.
\par \lquote I\rquote m going to see him right now,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I\rquote ve got a meeting with him. We could go together.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, well, in that case,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney with a smile. She bent down, scooped up her sherry bottles and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blue and white vase standing in a nearby niche.
\par \lquote I miss having you in my classes, Harry,\rquote  she said soulfully, as they set off together. \lquote You were never much of a Seer ... but you were a wonderful Object ...\rquote 
\par Harry did not reply; he had loathed being the Object of Professor Trelawney\rquote s continual predictions of doom.
\par \lquote I am afraid,\rquote  she went on, \lquote that the nag \endash  I\rquote m sorry, the centaur \endash  knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked him \endash  one Seer to another \endash  had he not, too, sensed the distant vibra\-
tions of coming catastrophe? But he seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!\rquote 
\par Her voice rose rather hysterically and Harry caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind.
\par \lquote Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my great-great-grandmother\rquote 
s gift. Those rumours have been bandied about by the jealous for years. You know what I say to such people, Harry? Would Dumbledore have let me teach at this great school, put so much trust in me all these years, had I not proved myself to him?\rquote 

\par Harry mumbled something indistinct.
\par \lquote I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore,\rquote  went on Professor Trelawney, in throaty tones. \lquote He was deeply impressed, of course, deeply impressed ... I was staying at the Hog\rquote 
s Head, which I do not advise, incidentally \endash  bed bugs, dear boy \endash 
 but funds were low. Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room at the inn. He questioned me ... I must confess that, at first, I thought he seemed ill-dispose
d towards Divination ... and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd, I had not eaten much that day ... but then ...\rquote 
\par And now Harry was paying attention properly for the first time, for he knew what had happened then: Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life, the prophecy about him and Voldemort.
\par \lquote ... but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape!\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with Snape, who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs, although I\rquote 
m afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with Dumbledore \endash  you see, he himself was seeking a job 
at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! Well, after that, you know, Dumbledore seemed much more dis\-
posed to give me a job, and I could not help thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes 
\endash  Harry, dear?\rquote 
\par She looked back over her shoulder, having only just real\-ised that Harry was no longer with her; he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other.
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote  she repeated uncertainly.
\par Perhaps his face was white, to make her look so concerned and frightened. Harry was standing stock-still as waves of shock crashed over him, wave after wave, obliterating every\-thing except the information that had been kept from him for so long ...

\par It was Snape who had overheard the prophecy. It was Snape who had carried the news of the prophecy to Voldemort. Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had sent Voldemort hunt\-ing after Lily and James and their son ...
\par Nothing else mattered to Harry just now.
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote  said Professor Trelawney again. \lquote Harry \endash  I thought we were going to see the Headmaster together?\rquote 
\par \lquote You stay here,\rquote  said Harry through numb lips.
\par \lquote But, dear ... I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You stay here!\rquote  Harry repeated angrily.
\par She looked alarmed as he ran past her, round the corner into Dumbledore\rquote s corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry. Harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the mo
ving spiral staircase three steps at a time. He did not knock upon Dumbledore\rquote s door, he hammered; and the calm voice answered \lquote Enter\rquote  after Harry had already flung himself into the room.
\par Fawkes the phoenix looked round, his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset beyond the window. Dumbledore was standing at the window look\-ing out at the grounds, a long, black travelling cloak in his arms.
\par \lquote Well, Harry, I promised that you could come with me.\rquote 
\par For a moment or two, Harry did not understand; the con\-versation with Trelawney had driven everything else out of his head and his brain seemed to be moving very slowly.
\par \lquote Come ... with you ...?\rquote 
\par \lquote Only if you wish it, of course.\rquote 
\par \lquote If I ...\rquote 
\par And then Harry remembered why he had been eager to come to Dumbledore\rquote s office in the first place.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve found one? You\rquote ve found a Horcrux?\rquote 
\par \lquote I believe so.\rquote 
\par Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement: for several moments, Harry could not speak.
\par \lquote It is natural to be afraid,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not scared!\rquote  said Harry at once, and it was perfectly true; fear was one emotion he was not feeling at all. \lquote Which Horcrux is it? Where is it?\rquote 
\par \lquote I am not sure which it is \endash  though I think we can rule out the snake \endash  but I be
lieve it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here, a cave I have been trying to locate for a very long time: the cave in which Tom Riddle once terror\-ised two children from his orphanage on their annual trip; you remember?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote How is it protected?\rquote 
\par \lquote I do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong.\rquote  Dumbledore hesitated, then said, \lquote Harry, I promised you that you could come with me, and I stand by that prom\-ise, but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you tha
t this will be exceedingly dangerous.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m coming,\rquote  said Harry, almost before Dumbledore had finished speaking. Boiling with anger at Snape, his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes. This seemed to show on Harry\rquote 
s face, for Dumbledore moved away from the window, and looked more closely at Harry, a slight crease between his silver eyebrows.
\par \lquote What has happened to you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  lied Harry promptly.
\par \lquote What has upset you?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not upset.\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, you were never a good Occlumens \endash \rquote 
\par The word was the spark that ignited Harry\rquote s fury.
\par \lquote Snape!\rquote  he said, very loudly, and Fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them. \lquote Snape\rquote s what\rquote s happened! He told Voldemort about the prophecy, it was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 him, he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 listened outside the door, Trelawney told me!\rquote 
\par Dumbledore\rquote s expression did not change, but Harry thought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast by the setting sun. For a long moment, Dumbledore said nothing.
\par \lquote When did you find out about this?\rquote  he asked at last.
\par \lquote Just now!\rquote  said Harry, who was refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty. And then, suddenly, he could not stop himself. \lquote AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD!\rquote 
\par Breathing hard as though he were fighting, Harry turned away fr
om Dumbledore, who still had not moved a muscle, and paced up and down the study, rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over. He wanted to rage and storm at Dumbledore, but he also w
anted to go with him to try and destroy the Horcrux; he wanted to tell him that he was a fool\-ish old man for trusting Snape, but he was terrified that Dumbledore would not take him along unless he mastered his anger ...
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly. \lquote Please listen to me.\rquote 
\par It was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting. Harry paused, biting his lip, and looked into Dumbledore\rquote s lined face.
\par \lquote Professor Snape made a terrible \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door!\rquote 
\par \lquote Please let me finish.\rquote  Dumbledore waited until Harry had nodded curtly, then went on. \lquote Professor Snape made a terrible mistake. He was still in Lord Voldemort\rquote s employ on the night he heard t
he first half of Professor Trelawney\rquote s prophecy. Naturally, he hastened to tell his master what he had heard, for it concerned his master most deeply. But he did not know \endash  he had no possible way of knowing \endash 
 which boy Voldemort would hunt from then onwards, or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that Professor Snape knew, that they were your mother and father \endash \rquote 
\par Harry let out a yell of mirthless laughter.
\par \lquote He hated my dad like he hated Sirius! Haven\rquote t you noticed, Professor, how the people Snape hates tend to end up dead?\rquote 
\par \lquote You have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt when he realised how Lord Voldemort had interpreted the prophecy, Harry. I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 he\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 a very good Occlumens, isn\rquote t he, sir?\rquote 
 said Harry, whose voice was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady. \lquote And isn\rquote t Voldemort convinced that Snape\rquote s on his side, even now? Professor ... how can you be }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 sure }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Snape\rquote s on our side?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore did not speak for a moment; he looked as though he was trying to make up his mind about something. At last he said, \lquote I am sure. I trust Severus Snape completely.\rquote 
\par Harry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady himself. It did not work.
\par \lquote Well, I don\rquote t!\rquote  he said, as loudly as before. \lquote He\rquote s up to something with Draco Malfoy right now, right under your nose, and you still \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We have discussed this, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore, and now he sounded stern again. \lquote I have told you my views.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re leaving the school tonight and I\rquote ll bet you haven\rquote t even considered that Snape and Malfoy might decide to \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote To what?\rquote  asked Dumbledore, his eyebrows raised. \lquote What is it that you suspect them of doing, precisely?\rquote 
\par \lquote I ... they\rquote re up to something!\rquote  said Harry and his hands curled into fists as he said it. \lquote 
Professor Trelawney was just in the Room of Requirement, trying to hide her sherry bottles, and she heard Malfoy whooping, celebrating! He\rquote s trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me he\rquote s fixed it at last and you\rquote 
re about to just walk out of school without \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Enough,\rquote  said Dumbledore. He said it quite calmly, and yet Harry fell silent at once; he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line. \lquote Do you think that I have once l
eft the school unprotected during my absences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, there will again be additional protec\-tion in place. Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t \endash \rquote  mumbled Harry, a little abashed, but Dumbledore cut across him.
\par \lquote I do not wish to discuss the matter any further.\rquote 
\par Harry bit back his retort, scared that he had gone too far, that he had ruined his chance of accompanying Dumbledore, but Dumbledore went on, \lquote Do you wish to come with me tonight?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry at once.
\par \lquote Very well, then: listen.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore drew himself up to his full height.
\par \lquote I take you with me on one condition: that you obey any command I might give you at once, and without question.\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course.\rquote 
\par \lquote Be sure to understand me, Harry. I mean that you must follow even such orders as \'93run\'94, \'93hide\'94 or \'93go back\'94. Do I have your word?\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  yes, of course.\rquote 
\par \lquote If I tell you to hide, you will do so?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes.\rquote 
\par \lquote If I tell you to flee, you will obey?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes.\rquote 
\par \lquote If I tell you to leave me, and save yourself, you will do as I tell you?\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote 
\par They looked at each other for a moment.
\par \lquote Yes, sir.\rquote 
\par \lquote Very good. Then I wish you to go and fetch your Cloak and meet me in the Entrance Hall in five minutes\rquote  time.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window; the sun was now a ruby-red glare along the horizon. Harry walked quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase. His mind was oddly clear all of a sudden. He knew what to do.
\par Ron and Hermione were sitting together in the common room when he came back. \lquote What does Dumbledore want?\rquote  Hermione said at once. \lquote Harry, are you OK?\rquote  she added anxiously.
\par \lquote I\rquote m fine,\rquote  said Harry shortly, racing past them. He dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory, where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauder\rquote 
s Map and a pair of balled-up socks. Then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where Ron and Hermione sat, looking stunned.
\par \lquote I haven\rquote t got much time,\rquote  Harry panted, \lquote Dumbledore thinks I\rquote m getting my Invisibility Cloak. Listen ...\rquote 
\par Quickly he told them where he was going, and why. He did not pause either for Hermione\rquote s gasps of horror or for Ron\rquote s hasty questions; they could work out the finer details for themselves later.
\par \lquote ... so you see what this means?\rquote  Harry finished at a gallop. \lquote Dumbledore won\rquote t be here tonight, so Malfoy\rquote s going to have another clear shot at whatever he\rquote s up to. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 No, listen to me!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699  he hissed angrily, as both Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting. \lquote 
I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement. Here \endash \rquote  He shoved the Marauder\rquote s Map into Hermione\rquote s hand. \lquote You\rquote ve got to watch him and you\rquote 
ve got to watch Snape, too. Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the DA. Hermione, those contact Galleons will still work, right? Dumbledore says he\rquote s put extra protection in the school, but if Snape\rquote s involved, he\rquote 
ll know what Dumbledore\rquote s protection is, and how to avoid it \endash  but he won\rquote t be expecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry \endash \rquote  began Hermione, her eyes huge with fear.
\par \lquote I haven\rquote t got time to argue,\rquote  said Harry curtly. \lquote Take this as well \endash \rquote  He thrust the socks into Ron\rquote s hands.
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Er \endash  why do I need socks?\rquote 
\par \lquote You need what\rquote s wrapped in them, it\rquote s the Felix Felicis. Share it between yourselves and Ginny too. Say goodbye to her from me. I\rquote d better go, Dumbledore\rquote s waiting \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion, looking awestruck. \lquote We don\rquote t want it, you take it, who knows what you\rquote re going to be facing?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll be fine, I\rquote ll be with Dumbledore,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I want to know you lot are OK ... don\rquote t look like that, Hermione, I\rquote ll see you later ...\rquote 
\par And he was off, hurrying back through the portrait hole towards the Entrance Hall.
\par Dumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors. He turned as Harry came skidding out on to the topmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in his side.
\par \lquote I would like you to wear your Cloak, please,\rquote  said Dumbledore, and he waited until Harry had thrown it on before saying, \lquote Very good. Shall we go?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his own travelling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air. Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak, still pant\-ing and sweating rather a lot.
\par \lquote But what will people think when they see you leaving, Professor?\rquote  Harry asked, his mind on Malfoy and Snape.
\par \lquote That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,\rquote  said Dumbledore lightly. \lquote I sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom, or else visit the Hog\rquote s Head ... or I appear to. It is as good a way as any of disguising one\rquote 
s true destination.\rquote 
\par They made their way down the drive in the gathering twi\-light. The air was full of the smells of warm grass, lake water and wood smoke from Hagrid\rquote s cabin. It was difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening.

\par \lquote Professor,\rquote  said Harry quietly, as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view, \lquote will we be Apparating?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote You can Apparate now, I believe?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but I haven\rquote t got a licence.\rquote 
\par He felt it best to be honest; what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go?
\par \lquote No matter,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote I can assist you again.\rquote 
\par They turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted lane to Hogsmeade. Darkness descended fast as they walked and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest. Lights twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the Thre
e Broomsticks they heard raucous shouting.
\par \lquote \endash  and stay out!\rquote  shouted Madam Rosmerta, forcibly ejecting a grubby-looking wizard. \lquote Oh, hello, Albus ... you\rquote re out late ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Good evening, Rosmerta, good evening ... forgive me, I\rquote m off to the Hog\rquote s Head ... no offence, but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight ...\rquote 
\par A minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the Hog\rquote s Head\rquote s sign creaked a little, though there was no breeze. In contrast to the Three Broomsticks, the pub appeared to be completely empty.
\par \lquote It will not be necessary for us to enter,\rquote  muttered Dumbledore, glancing around. \lquote 
As long as nobody sees us go ... now place your hand upon my arm, Harry. There is no need to grip too hard, I am merely guiding you. On the count of three \endash  one ... two ... three ...\rquote 
\par Harry turned. At once, there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube; he could not draw breath, every part of him was being com\-pressed almost past endurance and then, just when he thoug
ht he must suffocate, the invisible bands seemed to burst open, and he was standing in cool darkness, breathing in lungfuls of fresh, salty air.

Harry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moonlit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and churning below him. He glanced over his shoulde
r
. A towering cliff stood behind, a sheer drop, black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a ble
ak, harsh view; the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand.

s opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic.
\par \lquote They brought the kids from the orphanage here?\rquote  asked Harry, who could not imagine a less cosy spot for a daytrip.
\par \lquote Not here, precisely,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of 
the waves. No, I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youth\-
ful victims who visited this spot. No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats cannot approach the cliffs; the waters around them are too dangerou
s. I imagine that Riddle climbed down; magic would have served better than ropes. And he brought two small children with him, probably for the pleasure of terroris\-ing them. I think the journey alone would have done it, don\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par Harry looked up at the cliff again and felt goosebumps.
\par \lquote But his final destination \endash  and ours \endash  lies a little further on. Come.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock, where a series of jagged niches that made footholds led down to boulders that lay half-submerge
d in water and closer to the cliff. It was a treacherous descent and Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his withered hand, moved slowly. The lower rocks were slippery with sea water. Harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Lumos,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too.
\par \lquote You see?\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little higher. Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling.
\par \lquote You will not object to getting a little wet?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Then take off your Invisibility Cloak \endash  there is no need for it now \endash  and let us take the plunge.\rquote 
\par And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumbledore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, towards the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his teeth. Ha
rry pulled off his Cloak, stuffed it into his pocket and followed.
\par The water was icy; Harry\rquote s waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down. Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for th
e shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff.
\par The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide. The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of Dumbledore\rquote 
s wand. A little way in, the passageway curved to the left and Harry saw that it extended far into the cliff. He continued to swim in Dumbledore\rquote s wake, the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough, wet rock.
\par Then he saw Dumbled
ore rising out of the water ahead, his silver hair and dark robes gleaming. When Harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave. He clambered up them, water streaming from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into 
the still and freezing air.
\par Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling.
\par \lquote Yes, this is the place,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote How can you tell?\rquote  Harry spoke in a whisper.
\par \lquote It has known magic,\rquote  said Dumbledore simply.
\par Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experi\-encing were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of enchantments. He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see.

\par \lquote This is merely the ante-chamber, the entrance hall,\rquote  said Dumbledore after a moment or two. \lquote We need to penetrate the inner place ... now it is Lord Voldemort\rquote s obstacles that stand in our way, rather than those nat
ure made ...\rquote 
\par Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as 
he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backwards and forwards over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall.
\par \lquote Here,\rquote  he said. \lquote We go on through here. The entrance is concealed.\rquote 
\par Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.
\par Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock. For a moment, an arched outline appeared there, blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve d-done it!\rquote  said Harry through chattering teeth, but before the words had left his lips the outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever. Dumbledore looked round.
\par \lquote Harry, I\rquote m so sorry, I forgot,\rquote  he said; he pointed his wand at Harry and at once Harry\rquote s clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire.
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote 
 said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore had already turned his attention back to the solid cave wall. He did not try any more magic, but simply stood there staring at it intently, as though something extremely interesting was written on it. Ha
rry stayed quite still; he did not want to break Dumbledore\rquote s concentration.
\par Then, after two solid minutes, Dumbledore said quietly, \lquote Oh, surely not. So crude.\rquote 
\par \lquote What is it, Professor?\rquote 
\par \lquote I rather think,\rquote  said Dumbledore, putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop potion ingredients, \lquote that we are required to make payment to pass.\rquote 
\par \lquote Payment?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote You\rquote ve got to give the door some\-thing?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Blood, if I am not much mistaken.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Blood?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote I said it was crude,\rquote  said Dumbledore, who sounded dis\-dainful, even disappointed, as though Voldemort had fallen short of the standards Dumbledore expected. \lquote The idea, as I am sure you will have ga
thered, is that your enemy must weaken him or herself to enter. Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it ...\rquote  said Harry, who had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more.
\par \lquote Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable,\rquote  said Dumbledore, shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand.
\par \lquote Professor!\rquote  protested Harry, hurrying forwards as Dumbledore raised his knife. \lquote I\rquote ll do it, I\rquote m \endash \rquote 
\par He did not know what he was going to say \endash  younger, fitter? But Dumbledore merely smiled. There was a flash of silver, and a spurt of scarlet; the rock face was peppered with dark, glistening drops.
\par \lquote You are very kind, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore, now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just as Snape had healed Malfoy\rquote s wounds. \lquote 
But your blood is worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to have done the trick, doesn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par The blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more, and this time it did not fade away: the blood-spattered rock within it simply vanished, leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness.
\par \lquote After me, I think,\rquote  said Dumbledore, and he walked through the archway with Harry on his heels, lighting his own wand hastily as he went.
\par An eerie sight met their eyes: they were standing on the edge of a great black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a cavern so high that the cei
ling, too, was out of sight. A misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the oth
erwise velvety blackness, though their rays did not pene\-trate as far as Harry would have expected. The darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness.
\par \lquote Let us walk,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly. \lquote Be very careful not to step into the water. Stay close to me.\rquote 
\par He set off around the edge of the lake and Harry followed close behind him. Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water. On and on they walked, but the view did not vary: on one side of them, the rough
 cavern wall; on the other, the bound\-less expanse of smooth, glassy blackness, in the very middle of which was that mysterious greenish glow. Harry found the place and the silence oppressive, unnerving.
\par \lquote Professor?\rquote  he said finally. \lquote Do you think the Horcrux is here?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Yes, I\rquote m sure it is. The question is, how do we get to it?\rquote 
\par \lquote We couldn\rquote t ... we couldn\rquote t just try a Summoning Charm?\rquote  Harry said, sure that it was a stupid suggestion, but much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible.
\par \lquote Certainly we could,\rquote  said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly that Harry almost walked into him. \lquote Why don\rquote t you do it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Me? Oh ... OK ...\rquote 
\par Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand aloft, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Accio Horcrux!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par With a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples 
on the mirrored surface. Harry leapt backwards in shock and hit the wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore.
\par \lquote What was that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux.\rquote 
\par Harry looked back at the water. The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass: the ripples had vanished unnaturally fast; Harry\rquote s heart, however, was still pounding.
\par \lquote Did you think that would happen, sir?\rquote 
\par \lquote I thought }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 something }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 would happen if we made an obvious a
ttempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. That was a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing.\rquote 
\par \lquote But we don\rquote t know what the thing was,\rquote  said Harry, look\-ing at the sinisterly smooth water.
\par \lquote What the things }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 are, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you mean,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote 
I doubt very much that there is only one of them. Shall we walk on?\rquote 
\par \lquote Professor?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Do you think we\rquote re going to have to go into the lake?\rquote 
\par \lquote Into it? Only if we are very unfortunate.\rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t think the Horcrux is at the bottom?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh no ... I think the Horcrux is in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 middle.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par And Dumbledore pointed towards the misty green light in the centre of the lake.
\par \lquote So we\rquote re going to have to cross the lake to get to it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I think so.\rquote 
\par Harry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of water-monsters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies and sprites ...
\par \lquote Aha,\rquote  said Dumbledore and he stopped again; this time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water and Dumbledore\rquote s uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm, pulling him back. 
\lquote So sorry, Harry, I should have given warning. Stand back against the wall, please; I think I have found the place.\rquote 
\par Harry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of
 dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it. This time he was running his hand not over the rocky wall, but through the thin air, as though expecting to find and gr
ip something invisible.
\par \lquote Oho,\rquote  said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could not see. Dumbledore moved closer to the water; Harry watched ner\-vously as the tips of Dumbledore\rquote s buckled shoes found the utmos
t edge of the rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point.
\par Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water into Dumble\-dore\rquote 
s clenched hand. Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water. Harry g
asped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, towards the place on the bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood.
\par \lquote How did you know that was there?\rquote  Harry asked in astonishment.
\par \lquote Magic always leaves traces,\rquote  said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, \lquote sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.\rquote 
\par \lquote Is ... is this boat safe?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it, in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux.\rquote 
\par \lquote So the things in the water won\rquote t do anything to us if we cross in Voldemort\rquote s boat?\rquote 
\par \lquote I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at some point, realise we are not Lord Voldemort. Thus far, how\-ever, we have done well. They have allowed us to raise the boat.\rquote 
\par \lquote But why have they let us?\rquote  asked Harry, who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank.
\par \lquote Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I think he would have been prepared to risk 
what was, to his mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he is right.\rquote 
\par Harry looked down into the boat. It really was very small.
\par \lquote It doesn\rquote t look like it was built for two people. Will it hold both of us? Will we be too heavy together?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore chuckled.
\par \lquote Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.\rquote 

\par \lquote But then \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote I do not think you will count, Harry: you are under age and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.\rquote 
\par These words did nothing to raise Harry\rquote s morale; perhaps Dumbledore knew it, for he added, \lquote Voldemort\rquote s mistake, Harry, Voldemort\rquote s mistake ... age is fo
olish and forgetful when it underestimates youth ... now, you first this time, and be careful not to touch the water.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully into the boat. Dumbledore stepped in, too, coiling the chain on to the floor. They wer
e crammed in together; Harry could not comfortably sit, but crouched, his knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which began to move at once. There was no sound other than the silken rustle of the boat\rquote 
s prow cleaving the water; it moved without their he
lp, as though an invisible rope were pulling it onwards towards the light in the centre. Soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern; they might have been at sea except that there were no waves.
\par Harry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wand-light sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed. The boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface, grooves in the dark mirror ...
\par And then Harry saw it, marble-white, floating inches below the surface.
\par \lquote Professor!\rquote  he said, and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water.
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote I think I saw a hand in the water \endash  a human hand!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I am sure you did,\rquote  said Dumbledore calmly.
\par Harry stared down into the water, looking for the vanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in his throat.
\par \lquote So that thing that jumped out of the water \endash ?\rquote 
\par But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could reply; the wand-light had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him, this time, a dead man lying face up inches beneath the surface: his open eyes misted as though with cob\-
webs, his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke.
\par \lquote There are bodies in here!\rquote  said Harry, and his voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike his own.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore placidly, \lquote but we do not need to worry about them at the moment.\rquote 
\par \lquote At the moment?\rquote  Harry repeated, tearing his gaze from the water to look at Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote There is nothing to be feared from a bo
dy, Harry, any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, noth
ing more.\rquote 
\par Harry said nothing; he did not want to argue, but he found the idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible, and what was more, he did not believe that they were not dangerous.
\par \lquote But one of them jumped,\rquote  he said, trying to make his voice as level and calm as Dumbledore\rquote s. \lquote When I tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I am sure that once we take the Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable. However, like many creatures th
at dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise. Fire, Harry,\rquote  Dumbledore added with a smile, in response to Harry\rquote s bewildered expression.
\par \lquote Oh ... right ...\rquote  said Harry quickly. He 
turned his head to look at the greenish glow towards which the boat was still inexorably sailing. He could not pretend, now, that he was not scared. The great black lake, teeming with the dead ... it seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor Tr
elawney, that he had given Ron and Hermione the Felix Felicis ... he suddenly wished he had said a better goodbye to them ... and he hadn\rquote t seen Ginny at all ...
\par \lquote Nearly there,\rquote  said Dumbledore cheerfully.
\par Sure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growin
g larger at last, and within minutes, the boat had come to a halt, bumping gently into something that Harry could not see at first, but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the centre of the lak
e.
\par \lquote Careful not to touch the water,\rquote  said Dumbledore again as Harry climbed out of the boat.
\par The island was no larger than Dumbledore\rquote s office: an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light, which looked much bri
ghter when viewed close to. Harry squinted at it; at first he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal.
\par Dumbledore approached the basin and Harry followed. Side by side they looked down into it. The basin was full of an emerald liquid emitting that phosphorescent glow.
\par \lquote What is it?\rquote  asked Harry quietly.
\par \lquote I am not sure,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Something more worri\-some than blood and bodies, however.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand, and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers towards the surface of the potion.
\par \lquote Sir, no, don\rquote t touch \endash !\rquote 
\par \lquote I cannot touch,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. \lquote See? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You try.\rquote 
\par Staring, Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion. He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it. No matter how hard he pushed, his fingers encountered nothing but
 what seemed to be solid and inflexible air.
\par \lquote Out of the way, please, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par He raised his wand a
nd made complicated movements over the surface of the potion, murmuring soundlessly. Nothing happened, except perhaps that the potion glowed a little brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while Dumbledore withdrew his wand a
nd Harry felt it was safe to talk again.
\par \lquote You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yes.\rquote  Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his face reflected, upside-down, in the smooth sur\-face of the green potion. \lquote But how to reach it? This po
tion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted, scooped up or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed or otherwise made to change its nature.\rquote 
\par Almost absent-mindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once in midair and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere.
\par \lquote I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote No!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I think so: only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths.\rquote 
\par \lquote But what if \endash  what if it kills you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, I doubt that it would work like that,\rquote  said Dumbledore easily. \lquote Lord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island.\rquote 
\par Harry couldn\rquote t believe it. Was this more of Dumbledore\rquote s insane determination to see good in everyone?
\par \lquote Sir,\rquote  said Harry, trying to keep his voice reasonable, \lquote sir, this is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Voldemort }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

to kill the person who reached this island,\rquote  Dumbledore corrected himself. \lquote He wou
ld want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defences and, most importantly of all, why they were so intent upon emptying the basin. Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows abou
t his Horcruxes.\rquote 
\par Harry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore raised his hand for silence, frowning slightly at the emerald liquid, evidently thinking hard.
\par \lquote Undoubtedly,\rquote  he said finally, \lquote this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking t
he Horcrux. It might paralyse me, cause me to forget what I am here for, create so much pain I am distracted, or render me incapable in some other way. This being the case, Harry, it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking, even if you have to tip t
he potion into my protesting mouth. You understand?\rquote 
\par Their eyes met over the basin; each pale face lit with that strange, green light. Harry did not speak. Was this why he had been invited along \endash  so that he could force-feed Dumbledore a potion that might cause him unendurable pain?
\par \lquote You remember,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote the condition on which I brought you with me?\rquote 
\par Harry hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin.
\par \lquote But what if \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote You swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Well, then,\rquote  said Dumbledore, shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, \lquote you have my orders.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why can\rquote t I drink the potion instead?\rquote  asked Harry desperately.
\par \lquote Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Once and for all, Harry, do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking?\rquote 
\par \lquote Couldn\rquote t \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Do I have it?\rquote 
\par \lquote But \endash \rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Your word, Harry.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par \lquote I \endash  all right, but \endash \rquote 
\par Before Harry could make any further protest, Dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the potion. For a split second Harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the goblet, but the crystal sank into the surface as noth\-
ing else had; when the glass was full to the brim, Dumbledore lifted it to his mouth.
\par \lquote Your good health, Harry.\rquote 
\par And he drained the goblet. Harry watched, terrified, his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb.
\par \lquote Professor?\rquote  he said anxiously, as Dumbledore lowered the empty glass. \lquote How do you feel?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed. Harry wondered whether he was in pain. Dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin, refilled it, and drank once more.
\par In silence, Dumbledore drank three gobletfuls of the potion. Then, halfway through the fourth goblet, he staggered and fell forwards against the basin. His eyes were still closed, his breathing heavy.
\par \lquote Professor Dumbledore?\rquote  said Harry, his voice strained. \lquote Can you hear me?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore did not answer. His face was twitching as though he were deeply asleep, but dreaming a horrible dream. His grip on the goblet was slackening; the potion was about to spill from it. Harry reached forwards and grasped the crystal cup, holding it
 steady.
\par \lquote Professor, can you hear me?\rquote  he repeated loudly, his voice echoing around the cavern.
\par Dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry did not recognise, for he had never heard Dumbledore frightened like this.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t want ... don\rquote t make me ...\rquote 
\par Harry stared into the whitened face he knew so well, at the crooked nose and half-moon spectacles, and did not know what to do.
\par \lquote ... don\rquote t like ... want to stop ...\rquote  moaned Dumbledore.
\par \lquote You ... you can\rquote t stop, Professor,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote You\rquote ve got to keep drinking, remember? You told me you had to keep drinking. Here ...\rquote 
\par Hating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, Harry forced the goblet back towards Dumbledore\rquote s mouth and tipped it, so that Dumbledore drank the remainder of the potion inside.
\par \lquote No ...\rquote  he groaned, as Harry lowered the goblet back into the basin and refilled it for him. \lquote I don\rquote t want to ... I don\rquote t want to ... let me go ...\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s all right, Professor,\rquote  said Harry, his hand shaking. \lquote It\rquote s all right, I\rquote m here \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Make it stop, make it stop,\rquote  moaned Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Yes ... yes, this\rquote ll make it stop,\rquote  lied Harry. He tipped the contents of the goblet into Dumbledore\rquote s open mouth.
\par Dumbledore screamed; the noise echoed all around the vast chamber, across the dead black water.
\par \lquote No, no, no ... no ... I can\rquote t ... I can\rquote t, don\rquote t make me, I don\rquote t want to ...\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s all right, Professor, it\rquote s all right!\rquote  said Harry loudly, his hands shaking so badly he could hardly scoop up the sixth gobletful of potion; the basin was now half-empty. \lquote Nothing\rquote s happening to you, you
\rquote re safe, it isn\rquote t real, I swear it isn\rquote t real \endash  take this, now, take this ...\rquote 
\par And obediently, Dumbledore drank, as though it was an antidote Harry offered him, but upon draining the goblet, he sank to his knees, shaking uncontrollably.
\par \lquote It\rquote s all my fault, all my fault,\rquote  he sobbed, \lquote please make it stop, I know I did wrong, oh, please make it stop and I\rquote ll never, never again ...\rquote 
\par \lquote This will make it stop, Professor,\rquote  Harry said, his voice crack\-ing as he tipped the seventh glass of potion into Dumbledore\rquote s mouth.
\par Dumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers surrounded him; his flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from Harry\rquote s trembling hands as he moaned, \lquote Don\rquote t hurt them, don\rquote t hurt them, please, please, it
\rquote s my fault, hurt me instead ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Here, drink this, drink this, you\rquote ll be all right,\rquote  said Harry desperately, and once again Dumbledore obeyed him, opening his mouth even as he kept his eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot.
\par And now he fell forwards, screaming again, hammering his fists upon the ground, while Harry filled the ninth goblet.
\par \lquote Please, please, please, no ... not that, not that, I\rquote ll do anything ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Just drink, Professor, just drink ...\rquote 
\par Dumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst, but when he had finished, he yelled again as though his insides were on fire.
\par \lquote No more, please, no more ...\rquote 
\par Harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin.
\par \lquote We\rquote re nearly there, Professor, drink this, drink it ...\rquote 
\par He supported Dumbledore\rquote s shoulders and again, Dumbledore drained the glass; Harry was on his feet once more, refilling the goblet as Dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than ever, \lquote I want to die! I want to die! Make i
t stop, make it stop, I want to die!\rquote 
\par \lquote Drink this, Professor, drink this ...\rquote 
\par Dumbledore drank, and no sooner had he finished than he yelled, \lquote KILL ME!\rquote 
\par \lquote This \endash  this one will!\rquote  gasped Harry. \lquote Just drink this ... it\rquote ll be over ... all over!\rquote 
\par Dumbledore gulped at the goblet, drained every last drop and then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over on to his face.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  shouted Harry, who had stood to refill the goblet again; instead he dropped the cup into the basin, flung him\-self down beside Dumbledore and heaved him over on to his back; Dumbledore\rquote 
s glasses were askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed. \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, shaking Dumbledore, \lquote no, you\rquote re not dead, you said it wasn\rquote t poison, wake up, wake up \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumbledore\rquote s breathing was fading. His brain whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively, the only way left to get water, because Voldemort had planned it so ...
\par He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish.
\par \lquote Sir \endash  here!\rquote  Harry yelled, and lunging forwards he tipped the water clumsily over Dumbledore\rquote s face.
\par It was t
he best he could do, for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water. A slimy white hand had gripped his wrist, and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling him, slowly, backwards across the rock. The surfac
e
 of the lake was no longer mirror-smooth; it was churning, and everywhere Harry looked, white heads and hands were emerging from the dark water, men and women and children with sunken, sightless eyes were moving towards the rock: an army of the dead risin
g from the black water.

yelled Harry, struggling to cling on to the smooth, soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm: it released him, falling backwards into the water with a splash. He scram
bled to his feet; but many more Inferi were already climbing on to the rock, their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Petrificus Totalus!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699

\par A few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes, but those climbing on to the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies. Still slashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Sectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, they had no blood to spill: they walked on, unfeel\-
ing, their shrunken hands outstretched towards him, and as he backed away still further he felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshless arms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and su
rely, back to the water, and he knew there would be no release, that he would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemort\rquote s shattered soul ...
\par But then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of fire that 
surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water. They dropped Harry; he hit the ground, slipped on the rock and fell, grazing his arms, but scrambled back
 up, raising his wand and staring around.
\par Dumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the sur\-rounding Inferi, but taller than any, too, the fire dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth.

\par The Inferi bumped into each other, attempting, blindly, to escape the fire in which they were enclosed ...
\par Dumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes. Wordlessly, he ges\-
tured to Harry to come to his side. Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led Harry back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to 
the water\rquote s edge, where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters.
\par Harry, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that Dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it; all his efforts seemed to
 be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them. Harry seized him and helped him back to his seat. Once they were both safely jammed inside again, the boat began to move back across the black water, away from the rock, still encircled 
by that ring of fire, and it seemed that the Inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface.
\par \lquote Sir,\rquote  panted Harry, \lquote sir, I forgot \endash  about fire \endash  they were coming at me and I panicked \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Quite understandable,\rquote  murmured Dumbledore. Harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was.
\par They reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out, then turned quickly to help Dumbledore. The moment that Dumbledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but the Inferi did not emerge
 again from the water. The little boat sank into the water once more; clanking and tinkling, its chain slithered back into the lake, too. Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall.
\par \lquote I am weak ...\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t worry, sir,\rquote  said Harry at once, anxious about Dumbledore\rquote s extreme pallor and his air of exhaustion. \lquote Don\rquote t worry, I\rquote ll get us back ... lean on me, sir ...\rquote 
\par And pulling Dumbledore\rquote s uninjured arm around his shoulders, Harry guided his headmaster back around the lake, bearing most of his weight.
\par \lquote The protection was ... after all ... well designed,\rquote  said Dumbledore faintly. \lquote One alone could not have done it ... you did well, very well, Harry ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t talk now,\rquote  said Harry, fearing how slurred Dumbledore\rquote s voice had become, how much his feet dragged, \lquote save your energy, sir ... we\rquote ll soon be out of here ...\rquote 
\par \lquote The archway will have sealed again ... my knife ...\rquote 
\par \lquote There\rquote s no need, I got cut on the rock,\rquote  said Harry firmly, \lquote just tell me where ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Here ...\rquote 
\par Harry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone: having received its tribute of blood the archway reopened instantly. They crossed the outer cave and Harry helped Dumbledore back into the icy sea water that filled the crevice in the cliff.
\par \lquote It\rquote s going to be all right, sir,\rquote  Harry said over and over again, more worried by Dumbledore\rquote s silence than he had been by his weakened voice. \lquote We\rquote re nearly there ... I can Apparate us both back ... don\rquote

\par \lquote I am not worried, Harry,\rquote  said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. \lquote I am with you.\rquote

Once back under the starry sky, Harry heaved Dumbledore on to the top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet. Sodden and shivering, Dumbledore\rquote s weight still upon him, Harry con\-
centrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination: Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping Dumbledore\rquote s arm as tightly as he could, he stepped forwards into that feeling of horrible compression.

s imagination showed him more Inferi creeping towards him around the sides of shops, but he blinked and saw that noth\-ing was stirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows.
\par \lquote We did it, Professor!\rquote  Harry whispered with difficulty; he suddenly realised that he had a searing stitch in his chest. \lquote We did it! We got the Horcrux!\rquote 
\par Dumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, Harry thought that his inexpert Apparition had thrown Dumbledore off-balance; then he saw his face, paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp.
\par \lquote Sir, are you all right?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve been better,\rquote  said Dumbledore weakly, though the corners of his mouth twitched. \lquote That potion ... was no health drink ...\rquote

\par He looked around desperately for help, but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing.
\par \lquote We need to get you up to the school, sir ... Madam Pomfrey ...\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote It is ... Professor Snape whom I need ... but I do not think ... I can walk very far just yet ...\rquote

\par Before Harry could make a move, however, he heard run\-ning footsteps. His heart leapt: somebody had seen, somebody knew they needed help \endash 
 and looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying down the dark street towards them on high-heeled, fluffy slippers, wearing a silk dressing-gown embroidered with dragons.
\par \lquote I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains! Thank goodness, thank goodness, I couldn\rquote t think what to \endash  but what\rquote s wrong with Albus?\rquote 
\par She came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wide-eyed, at Dumbledore.
\par \lquote He\rquote s hurt,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Madam Rosmerta, can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him?\rquote 
\par \lquote You can\rquote t go up there alone! Don\rquote t you realise \endash  haven\rquote t you seen \endash ?\rquote

\par \lquote The \endash  the Dark Mark, Albus.\rquote 
\par And she pointed into the sky, in the direction of Hogwarts. Dread flooded Harry at the sound of the words ... he turned and looked.
\par There it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the blaz\-ing green skull with a serpent tongue, the mark Death Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building ... wherever they had murdered ...
\par \lquote When did it appear?\rquote  asked Dumbledore, and his hand clenched painfully upon Harry\rquote s shoulder as he struggled to his feet.

\par \lquote We need to return to the castle at once,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Rosmerta,\rquote  and though he staggered a little, he seemed wholly in command of the situation, \lquote we need transport \endash  brooms \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve got a couple behind the bar,\rquote  she said, looking very frightened. \lquote Shall I run and fetch \endash ?\rquote

\par A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open; two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to Harry\rquote s side, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly, at waist height.
\par \lquote Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,\rquote  said Dumbledore, as he mounted the broom nearest him. \lquote It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realised anything is wrong ... Harry, put on your Invisibility Cloak.\rquote 

\par Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom; Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back towards her pub as Harry and Dumble\-
dore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air. As they sped towards the castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark see
med to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant: he was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard flying behind him in the night air. And Harry, too, looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him lik
e a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from his mind ...
\par How long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione and Ginny\rquote s luck run out by now? Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over the school, or was it Nevill
e, or Luna, or some other member of the DA? And if it was ... he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors, he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds ... would he be responsible, again, for the death of a friend?
\par As they flew over the
 dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they fl
ew over the bound\-
ary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle, so that they could enter at speed. The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower, the highest of the castle. Did tha
t mean the death had occurred there?
\par Dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting; Harry landed next to him seconds later and looked around.
\par The ramparts were deserted. The door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was closed. There was no sign of a struggle, of a fight to the death, of a body.
\par \lquote What does it mean?\rquote  Harry asked Dumbledore, looking up at the green skull with its serpent\rquote s tongue glinting evilly above them. \lquote Is it the real Mark? Has someone definitely been \endash  Professor?\rquote 
\par In the dim green glow from the Mark Harry saw Dumble\-dore clutching at his chest with his blackened hand.
\par \lquote Go and wake Severus,\rquote  said Dumbledore faintly but clearly. \lquote Tell him what has happened and bring him to me. Do noth\-ing else, speak to nobody else and do not remove your Cloak. I shall wait here.\rquote 
\par \lquote But \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You swore to obey me, Harry \endash  go!\rquote 
\par Harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral stair\-case, but his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he h
eard running footsteps on the other side. He looked round at Dumbledore, who gestured to him to retreat. Harry backed away, drawing his wand as he did so.
\par The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Expelliarmus!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Then, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore\rquote s wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and under\-
stood ... Dumbledore had wordlessly immobilised Harry, and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself.
\par Standing against the ramparts, very white in the face, Dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress. He merely looked across at his disarmer and said, \lquote Good evening, Draco.\rquote 
\par Malfoy stepped forwards, glancing around quickly to check that he and Dumbledore were alone. His eyes fell upon the second broom.
\par \lquote Who else is here?\rquote 
\par \lquote A question I might ask you. Or are you acting alone?\rquote 
\par Harry saw Malfoy\rquote s pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the greenish glare of the Mark.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  he said. \lquote I\rquote ve got back-up. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, well,\rquote  said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was show\-ing him an ambitious homework project. \lquote Very good indeed. You found a way to let them in, did you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Malfoy, who was panting. \lquote Right under your nose and you never realised!\rquote 
\par \lquote Ingenious,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Yet ... forgive me ... where are they now? You seem unsupported.\rquote 
\par \lquote They met some of your guard. They\rquote re having a fight down below. They won\rquote t be long ... I came on ahead. I \endash  I\rquote ve got a job to do.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,\rquote  said Dumbledore softly.
\par There was silence. Harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible, paralysed body, staring at the two of them, his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Eaters\rquote 
 distant fight, and in front of him, Draco Malfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore who, incredibly, smiled.
\par \lquote Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.\rquote 
\par \lquote How do you know?\rquote  said Malfoy at once.
\par He seemed to realise how childish the words had sounded; Harry saw him flush in the Mark\rquote s greenish light.
\par \lquote You don\rquote t know what I\rquote m capable of,\rquote  said Malfoy more forcefully, \lquote you don\rquote t know what I\rquote ve done!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yes, I do,\rquote  said Dumbledore mildly. \lquote 
You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been trying, with increasing desperation, to kill me all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they have been feeble attempts ... so feeble, to be honest, that I wonder whether your heart has been reall
y in it ...\rquote 
\par \lquote It has been in it!\rquote  said Malfoy vehemently. \lquote I\rquote ve been work\-ing on it all year, and tonight \endash \rquote 
\par Somewhere in the depths of the castle below Harry heard a muffled yell. Malfoy stiffened and glanced over his shoulder.
\par \lquote Somebody is putting up a good fight,\rquote  said Dumbledore conversationally. \lquote But you were saying ... yes, you have man\-aged to introduce Death Eaters into my school which, I admit, I thought impossible ... how did you do it?\rquote 

\par But Malfoy said nothing: he was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as paralysed as Harry was.
\par \lquote Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,\rquote  suggested Dumbledore. \lquote What if your back-up has been thwarted by my guard? As you have perhaps realised, there are members of the Order of th
e Phoenix here tonight, too. And after all, you don\rquote t really need help ... I have no wand at the moment ... I cannot defend myself.\rquote 
\par Malfoy merely stared at him.
\par \lquote I see,\rquote  said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither moved nor spoke. \lquote You are afraid to act until they join you.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not afraid!\rquote  snarled Malfoy, though he still made no move to hurt Dumbledore. \lquote It\rquote s you who should be scared!\rquote 
\par \lquote But why? I don\rquote t think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe ... so tell me, 
while we wait for your friends ... how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.\rquote 
\par Malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout, or to vomit. He gulped and took several deep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore, his wand pointing directly at the latter\rquote s heart. Then, as though he could not help himself, he said, 
\lquote I had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one\rquote s used for years. The one Montague got lost in last year.\rquote 
\par \lquote Aaaah.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore\rquote s sigh was half a groan. He closed his eyes for a moment.
\par \lquote That was clever ... there is a pair, I take it?\rquote 
\par \lquote The other\rquote s in Borgin and Burkes,\rquote  said Malfoy, \lquote 
and they make a kind of passage between them. Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school, and sometimes what was going on in the shop, as if the Cabinet was 
travelling between them, but he couldn\rquote t make anyone hear him ... in the end he managed to Apparate out, even though he\rquote 
d never passed his test. He nearly died doing it. Everyone thought it was a really good story, but I was the only one who realised what it meant \endash  even Borgin didn\rquote t know \endash 
 I was the one who realised there could be a way into Hogwarts through the Cabinets if I fixed the broken one.\rquote 
\par \lquote Very good,\rquote  murmured Dumbledore. \lquote So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you ... a clever plan, a very clever plan ... and, as you say, right under my nose ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Malfoy who, bizarrely, seemed to draw courage and comfort from Dumbledore\rquote s praise. \lquote Yeah, it was!\rquote 
\par \lquote But there were times,\rquote  Dumbledore went on, \lquote weren\rquote t there, when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the Cabinet? And you resorted to crude and badly judged meas\-
ures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands ... poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, well, you still didn\rquote t realise who was behind that stuff, did you?\rquote  sneered Malfoy, as Dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts, the strength in his legs apparently fading, and Harry struggled fruitlessly, mutely, agai
nst the enchantment binding him.
\par \lquote As a matter of fact, I did,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I was sure it was you.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why didn\rquote t you stop me, then?\rquote  Malfoy demanded.
\par \lquote I tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He hasn\rquote t been doing }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 your }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 orders, he promised my mother \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course that is what he would tell you, Draco, but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s a double-agent, you stupid old man, he isn\rquote t working for you, you just think he is!\rquote 
\par \lquote We must agree to differ on that, Draco. It so happens that I trust Professor Snape \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Well, you\rquote re losing your grip, then!\rquote  sneered Malfoy. \lquote He\rquote s been offering me plenty of help \endash  wanting all the glory for himself \endash  wanting a bit of the action \endash  \'93
What are you doing? Did you do the necklace, that was stupid, it could have blown everything \endash \'94 But I haven\rquote t told him what I\rquote ve been doing in the Room of Requirement, he\rquote s going to wake up tomorrow and it\rquote 
ll all be over and he won\rquote t be the Dark Lord\rquote s favourite any more, he\rquote ll be nothing compared to me, nothing!\rquote 
\par \lquote Very gratifying,\rquote  said Dumbledore mildly. \lquote We all like appreciation for our own hard work, of course ... but you must have had an accomplice, all the same ... someone in Hogsmeade, someone who was able to slip Katie the \endash  the 
\endash  aaaah ...\rquote 
\par Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about to fall asleep.
\par \lquote ... of course ... Rosmerta. How long has she been under the Imperius Curse?\rquote 
\par \lquote Got there at last, have you?\rquote  Malfoy taunted.
\par There was another yell from below, rather louder than the last. Malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again, then back at Dumbledore, who went on, \lquote 
So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied? And the poisoned mead ... well, naturally, R
osmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn, believing that it was to be my Christmas present ... yes, very neat ... very neat ... poor Mr Filch would not, of course, think to check a bottle of Rosmerta\rquote 
s ... tell me, how have you been communicating with Rosmerta? I thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored.\rquote 
\par \lquote Enchanted coins,\rquote  said Malfoy, as though he was compelled to keep talking, though his wand hand was shaking badly. \lquote I had one and she had the other and I could send her messages \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Isn\rquote t that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledore\rquote s Army used last year?\rquote  asked Dumbledore. His voice was light and conversational, but Harry saw him slip an inch l
ower down the wall as he said it.
\par \lquote Yeah, I got the idea from them,\rquote  said Malfoy, with a twisted smile. \lquote I got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger, as well, I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognising potions ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Please do not use that offensive word in front of me,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par Malfoy gave a harsh laugh.
\par \lquote You care about me saying \'93Mudblood\'94 when I\rquote m about to kill you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I do,\rquote  said Dumbledore, and Harry saw his feet slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain upright. \lquote 
But as for being about to kill me, Draco, you have had several long minutes now. We are quite alone. I am more defenceless than you can have dreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted ...\rquote 
\par Malfoy\rquote s mouth contorted involuntarily, as though he had tasted something very bitter.
\par \lquote Now, about tonight,\rquote  Dumbledore went on, \lquote I am a little puzzled about how it happened ... you knew that I had left the school? But of course,\rquote  he answered his own question, \lquote Rosmerta saw me leaving, she
 tipped you off using your ingenious coins, I\rquote m sure ...\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Malfoy. \lquote But she said you were just going for a drink, you\rquote d be back ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I certainly did have a drink ... and I came back ... after a fashion,\rquote  mumbled Dumbledore. \lquote So you decided to spring a trap for me?\rquote 
\par \lquote We decided to put the Dark Mark over the Tower and get you to hurry up here, to see who\rquote d been killed,\rquote  said Malfoy. \lquote And it worked!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well ... yes and no ...\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote But am I to take it, then, that nobody has been murdered?\rquote 
\par \lquote Someone\rquote s dead,\rquote  said Malfoy and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it. \lquote One of your people ... I don\rquote 
t know who, it was dark ... I stepped over the body ... I was supposed to be waiting up here when you got back, only your Phoenix lot got in the way ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, they do that,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par There was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where Dumbledore, Malfoy and Harry stood, and Harry\rquote 
s heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest ... someone was dead ... Malfoy had stepped over the body ... but who was it?
\par \lquote There is little time, one way or another,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote So let us discuss your options, Draco.\rquote 
\par \lquote My options!\rquote  said Malfoy loudly. \lquote I\rquote m standing here with a wand \endash  I\rquote m about to kill you \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote My dear boy, let us have no more pretence about that. If you were going to kill me, you would have done it when you first Disarmed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.\rquote 
\par \lquote I haven\rquote t got any options!\rquote  said Malfoy, and he was sud\-denly as white as Dumbledore. \lquote I\rquote ve got to do it! He\rquote ll kill me! He\rquote ll kill my whole family!\rquote 
\par \lquote I appreciate the difficulty of your position,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realised that I suspected you.\rquote 

\par Malfoy winced at the sound of the name.
\par \lquote I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,\rquote  continued Dumbledore. \lquote 
But now at last we can speak plainly to each other ... no harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived ... I can help you, Draco.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, you can\rquote t,\rquote  said Malfoy, his wand hand shaking very badly indeed. \lquote Nobody can. He told me to do it or he\rquote ll kill me. I\rquote ve got no choice.\rquote 
\par \lquote Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more completely than you can po
ssibly imagine. What is more, I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise. Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban ... when the time comes we can protect him too ... come over to the right side, Draco ... you are not a
 killer ...\rquote 
\par Malfoy stared at Dumbledore.
\par \lquote But I got this far, didn\rquote t I?\rquote  he said slowly. \lquote They thought I\rquote d die in the attempt, but I\rquote m here ... and you\rquote re in my power ... I\rquote m the one with the wand ... you\rquote re at my mercy ...\rquote 

\par \lquote No, Draco,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly. \lquote It is my mercy, and not yours, that matters now.\rquote 
\par Malfoy did not speak. His mouth was open, his wand hand still trembling. Harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction \endash 
\par But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs and a second later Malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door on to the ram\-
parts. Still paralysed, his eyes staring unblinkingly, Harry gazed in terror upon four strangers: it seemed the Death Eaters had won the fight below.
\par A lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle.
\par \lquote Dumbledore cornered!\rquote  he said, and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly. \lquote Dumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone! Well done, Draco, well done!\rquote 
\par \lquote Good evening, Amycus,\rquote  said Dumbledore calmly, as though welcoming the man to a tea party. \lquote And you\rquote ve brought Alecto too ... charming ...\rquote 
\par The woman gave an angry little titter.
\par \lquote Think your little jokes\rquote ll help you on your death bed, then?\rquote  she jeered.
\par \lquote Jokes? No, no, these are manners,\rquote  replied Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Do it,\rquote  said the stranger standing nearest to Harry, a big, rangy man with matted grey hair and whiskers, whose black Death Eater\rquote s robes looked uncomfortably tight. He had a voice lik
e none that Harry had ever heard: a rasping bark of a voice. Harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat and, unmistakeably, of blood coming from him. His filthy hands had long yellowish nails.
\par \lquote Is that you, Fenrir?\rquote  asked Dumbledore.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  rasped the other. \lquote Pleased to see me, Dumbledore?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I cannot say that I am ...\rquote 
\par Fenrir Greyback grinned, showing pointed teeth. Blood trickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly, obscenely.
\par \lquote But you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now? This is most unusual ... you have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Greyback. \lquote Shocks you, that, does it, Dumbledore? Frightens you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote And, yes, I am a little shocked that Draco here invited you, of all people, into the school where his friends live ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t,\rquote  breathed Malfoy. He was not looking at Greyback; he did not seem to want to even glance at him. \lquote I didn\rquote t know he was going to come \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I wouldn\rquote t want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore,\rquote  rasped Greyback. \lquote Not when there are throats to be ripped out ... delicious, delicious ...\rquote 
\par And he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth, leering at Dumbledore.
\par \lquote I could do you for afters, Dumbledore ...\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a heavy, brutal-looking face. \lquote We\rquote ve got orders. Draco\rquote s got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly.\rquote 
\par Malfoy was showing less resolution than ever. He looked terrified as he stared into Dumbledore\rquote s face, which was even paler, and rather lower than usual, as he had slid so far down the rampart wall.
\par \lquote He\rquote s not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!\rquote  said the lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his sister\rquote s wheezing giggles. \lquote Look at him \endash  what\rquote s happened to you, then, Dumby?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Old age, in short ... one day, perhaps, it will happen to you ... if you are lucky ...\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s that mean, then, what\rquote s that mean?\rquote  yelled the Death Eater, suddenly violent. \lquote Always the same, weren\rquote t yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, nothing, I don\rquote t even know why the Dark Lord\rquote 
s bothering to kill yeh! Come on, Draco, do it!\rquote 
\par But at that moment, there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote They\rquote ve blocked the stairs \endash  Reducto! REDUCTO!\rquote 
}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par Harry\rquote s heart leapt: so these four had not eliminated all opposition, but merely broken through the fight to the top of the Tower, and, by the sound of it, created a barrier behind them \endash 
\par \lquote Now, Draco, quickly!\rquote  said the brutal-faced man angrily.
\par But Malfoy\rquote s hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll do it,\rquote  snarled Greyback, moving towards Dumbledore with his hands outstretched, his teeth bared.
\par \lquote I said no!\rquote  shouted the brutal-faced man; there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way; he hit the ramparts and staggered, looking furious. Harry\rquote s 
heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by Dumbledore\rquote s spell \endash  if he could only move, he could aim a curse from under the Cloak \endash 
\par \lquote Draco, do it, or stand aside so one of us \endash \rquote  screeched the wo
man, but at that precise moment the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged
 werewolf, and Malfoy.
\par \lquote We\rquote ve got a problem, Snape,\rquote  said the lumpy Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon Dumbledore, \lquote the boy doesn\rquote t seem able \endash \rquote 
\par But somebody else had spoken Snape\rquote s name, quite softly.
\par \lquote Severus ...\rquote 
\par The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading.
\par Snape said nothing, but walked forwards and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed.
\par Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face.
\par \lquote Severus ... please ...\rquote 
\par Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote Avada Kedavra!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
\par A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape\rquote s wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry\rquote 
s scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air: for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull
, and then he fell slowly backwards, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight.

\par He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both pan
ting excitedly. As they vanished through the door Harry realised he could move again; what was now holding him paralysed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to l
eave the Tower top, was disappearing through the door.

\par The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid, and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but he had barely hit the floor when Harry was clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase.
\par Terror tore at Harry\rquote s heart ... he had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape ... somehow the two things were linked ... he could reverse what had happened if he had them both together ... Dumbledore could not have died ...
\par He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised: the dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in and a battle was raging before him, but even as he att
empted to make out who was fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 \lquote It\rquote s over, time to go!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

rry plunged after them, one of the fighters detached themself from the fray and flew at him: it was the werewolf, Greyback. He was on top of Harry before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell backwards, with filthy matted hair in his face, the stench of 
sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat \endash

\par Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground, whose fate he did not yet know ...

 perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked \endash 
\par He skidded round another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived behind a suit of armour which exploded; he saw the brother and sister Death Eaters running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but merely hit sev\-
eral bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into neighbouring paintings; as he leapt over the wreckage of armour Harry heard more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken ...
\par He pelted towards a short cut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have reached the grounds by now; remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed stair\-

\par \lquote Out of the way!\rquote  yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside 
as he sprinted towards the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase. The oak front doors had been blasted open; there were smears of blood on the flagstones and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls, one or two still cow
ering with their arms over their faces; the giant Gryffindor hour-glass had been hit by a curse and the rubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, on to the flagstones below ...

\par Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of l

\par And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed back\-
wards into the ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and some\-
thing enormous obscured the stars: Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backwards as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Sn
ape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech \endash 
\par Harry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in 
the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had located his wand he turned only to see the Hippogriff circling the gates: Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the school\rquote s boundaries.
\par \lquote Hagrid,\rquote  muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. \lquote HAGRID?\rquote 
\par He stumbled towards the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back. With a cry of thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was shaking in every limb, his bod

\par \lquote Yeh all righ\rquote , Harry? Yeh all righ\rquote ? Speak ter me, Harry ...\rquote 
\par Hagrid\rquote s huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, blocking out the stars. Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Fang\rquote s reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him.

\par \lquote Course I am ... take more\rquote n that ter finish me.\rquote

\par \lquote Dumbledore,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Snape killed ... Dumbledore.\rquote

\rquote 
\par Harry did not attempt to argue or 
explain. He was still shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon ... As they directed their steps back towards the castle, Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now: he could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people mov
ed from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed ...
\par The oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out on to the drive and the lawn. Slowly, un
certainly, dressing-gowned people were creeping down the steps, looking around nervously for some sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Harry\rquote 
s eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he 
could see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass there, though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought Dumbledore\rquote 
s body must lie, however, he saw people beginning to move towards it.
\par \lquote What\rquote re they all lookin\rquote  at?\rquote  said Hagrid, as he and Harry approached the castle front, Fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles. \lquote Wha\rquote s tha\rquote , lyin\rquote  on the grass?\rquote 
 Hagrid added sharply, heading now towards the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was congregat\-ing. \lquote See it, Harry? Righ\rquote  at the foot o\rquote  the Tower? Under where the Mark ... blimey ... yeh don\rquote 
 think someone got thrown \endash ?\rquote 
\par Hagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud. Harry walked alongside 
him, feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half an hour had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them. What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing f
eeling in his chest ...
\par He and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the very front, where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap.
\par Harry heard Hagrid\rquote s moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forwards until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay, and crouched down beside him.
\par Harry had known there was no hope from the moment that the Body-Bind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead
; but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet.
\par Dumbledore\rquote s eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and legs, he might have been sleeping. Harry reac
hed out, straightened the half-moon spectacles upon the crooked nose and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. Then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again wou
ld Dumbledore speak to him, never again could he help ...
\par The crowd murmured behind Harry. After what seemed like a long time he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down.
\par The locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of Dumbledore\rquote s pocket. It had opened, per\-
haps due to the force with which it had hit the ground. And although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, Harry knew, as he picked it up, that there was something wrong ...
\par He turned the locket over in his hands. This was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there any markings upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be Slytherin\rquote s mark. Moreover, there was noth
ing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been.
\par Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, Harry pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him:

Harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant. Only one thing mattered: this was not a Horcrux. Dumbledore had
 weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing. Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand and his eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl.

\par \lquote No.\rquote 
\par He did not want to leave Dumbledore\rquote s side, he did not want to move anywhere. Hagrid\rquote s hand on his shoulder was trembling. Then another voice said, \lquote Harry, come on.\rquote 
\par A much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upwards. He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it. Only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realise, from a trace of flowery scent on the air, that it was Gi
nny who was leading him back into the castle. Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night, but Harry and Ginny walked on, back up the steps into the Entrance Hall: faces swam on the edges of Harry\rquote 
s vision, people were peering at him, whispering, wondering, and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way towards the marble staircase.
\par \lquote We\rquote re going to the hospital wing,\rquote  said Ginny.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not hurt,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote It\rquote s McGonagall\rquote s orders,\rquote  said Ginny. \lquote Everyone\rquote s up there, Ron and Hermione and Lupin and everyone \endash \rquote 
\par Fear stirred in Harry\rquote s chest again: he had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind.
\par \lquote Ginny, who else is dead?\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t worry, none of us.\rquote 
\par \lquote But the Dark Mark \endash  Malfoy said he stepped over a body \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He stepped over Bill, but it\rquote s all right, he\rquote s alive.\rquote 
\par There was something in her voice, however, that Harry knew boded ill.
\par \lquote Are you sure?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course I\rquote m sure ... he\rquote s a \endash  a bit of a mess, that\rquote s all. Greyback attacked him. Madam Pomfrey says he won\rquote t \endash  won\rquote t look the same any more ...\rquote  Ginny\rquote s voice trembled a little. 
\lquote We don\rquote t really know what the after-effects will be \endash  I mean, Greyback being a werewolf, but not transformed at the time.\rquote 
\par \lquote But the others ... there were other bodies on the ground ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Neville\rquote s in the hospital wing, but Madam Pomfrey thinks he\rquote ll make a full recovery, and Professor Flitwick was knocked out, but he\rquote s all right, just a bit shaky. He insisted on going off to look after the Ravenclaws. And a D
eath Eater\rquote s dead, he got hit by a Killing Curse the huge blond one was firing off everywhere \endash  Harry, if we hadn\rquote t had your Felix potion, I think we\rquote d all have been killed, but everything seemed to just miss us \endash 
\rquote 
\par They had reached the hospital wing: pushi
ng open the doors, Harry saw Neville lying, apparently asleep, in a bed near the door. Ron, Hermione, Luna, Tonks and Lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward. At the sound of the doors opening, they all looked up. Hermione ran 
to Harry and hugged him; Lupin moved forwards too, looking anxious.
\par \lquote Are you all right, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m fine ... how\rquote s Bill?\rquote 
\par Nobody answered. Harry looked over Hermione\rquote s shoulder and saw an unrecognisable face lying on Bill\rquote s pillow, so badly slashed and rip
ped that he looked grotesque. Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some harsh-smelling green ointment. Harry remembered how Snape had mended Malfoy\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
Sectumsempra }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 wounds so easily with his wand.
\par \lquote Can\rquote t you fix them with a charm or something?\rquote  he asked the matron.
\par \lquote No charm will work on these,\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey. \lquote I\rquote ve tried everything I know, but there is no cure for werewolf bites.\rquote 
\par \lquote But he wasn\rquote t bitten at the full moon,\rquote  said Ron, who was gazing down into his brother\rquote s face as though he could some\-how force him to mend just by staring. \lquote Greyback hadn\rquote t transformed, so surely Bill won
\rquote t be a \endash  a real \endash ?\rquote 
\par He looked uncertainly at Lupin.
\par \lquote No, I don\rquote t think that Bill will be a true werewolf,\rquote  said Lupin, \lquote but that does not mean that there won\rquote t be some contamination. Those are cursed wounds. They are unlikely ever to heal fully, and \endash 
 and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on.\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore might know something that\rquote d work, though,\rquote  Ron said. \lquote Where is he? Bill fought those maniacs on Dumbledore\rquote s orders, Dumbledore owes him, he can\rquote t leave him in this state \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ron \endash  Dumbledore\rquote s dead,\rquote  said Ginny.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry, as though hoping the latter might contradict her, but when Harry did not, Lupin collapsed into a chair beside Bill\rquote 
s bed, his hands over his face. Harry had never seen Lupin lose control before; he felt as though he was intruding upon something private, indecent; he turned away and caught Ron\rquote s eye instead, exchanging in silence a look that con
firmed what Ginny had said.
\par \lquote How did he die?\rquote  whispered Tonks. \lquote How did it happen?\rquote 
\par \lquote Snape killed him,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I was there, I saw it. We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because that\rquote s where the Mark was ... Dumbledore was ill, he was weak, but I 
think he realised it was a trap when we heard footsteps run\-ning up the stairs. He immobilised me, I couldn\rquote t do anything, I was under the Invisibility Cloak \endash  and then Malfoy came through the door and Disarmed him \endash \rquote 
\par Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth, and Ron groaned. Luna\rquote s mouth trembled.
\par \lquote \endash  more Death Eaters arrived \endash  and then Snape \endash  and Snape did it. The Avada Kedavra.\rquote  Harry couldn\rquote t go on.
\par Madam Pomfrey burst into tears. Nobody paid her any attention except Ginny, who whispered, \lquote Shh! Listen!\rquote 
\par Gulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth, her eyes wide. Somewhere out in the darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible beauty. And Harry felt,
 as he had felt about phoenix song before, that the music was inside him, not without: it was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows.
\par How long they all stood there, listening, he did not know, n
or why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning, but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and Professor McGonagall entered the ward. Like all the rest, she bore marks of the recent battle
: there were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped.
\par \lquote Molly and Arthur are on their way,\rquote  she said, and the spell of the music was broken: everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances, turning again to look at Bill, or else to rub their own eyes, shake their heads. \lquote 
Harry, what happened? According to Hagrid you were with Professor Dumbledore when he \endash  when it happened. He says Professor Snape was involved in some \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Snape killed Dumbledore,\rquote  said Harry.
\par She stared at him for a moment, then swayed alarmingly; Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have pulled herself together, ran forwards, conjuring a chair from thin air, which she pushed under McGonagall.
\par \lquote Snape,\rquote  repeated McGonagall faintly, falling into the chair. \lquote We all wondered ... but he trusted ... always ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Snape ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 I can\rquote t believe it ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens,\rquote  said Lupin, his voice uncharacteristically harsh. \lquote We always knew that.\rquote 
\par \lquote But Dumbledore swore he was on our side!\rquote  whispered Tonks. \lquote I always thought Dumbledore must know something about Snape that we didn\rquote t ...\rquote 
\par \lquote He always hinted that he had an iron-clad reason for trust\-ing Snape,\rquote  muttered Professor McGonagall, now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a tartan-edged hand\-kerchief. \lquote I mean ... with Snape\rquote 
s history ... of course people were bound to wonder ... but Dumbledore told me explicitly that Snape\rquote s repentance was absolutely genuine ... wouldn\rquote t hear a word against him!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote d love to know what Snape told him to convince him,\rquote  said Tonks.
\par \lquote I know,\rquote  said Harry, and they all turned to stare at him. \lquote Snape passed Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad. Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadn\rquote 
t realised what he was doing, he was really sorry he\rquote d done it, sorry that they were dead.\rquote 
\par \lquote And Dumbledore believed that?\rquote  said Lupin incredulously. \lquote Dumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead? Snape }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 hated }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 James ...\rquote 
\par \lquote And he didn\rquote t think my mother was worth a damn, either,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote because she was Muggle-born ... \'93Mudblood\'94, he called her ...\rquote 
\par Nobody asked how Harry knew this. All of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock, trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened.
\par \lquote This is all my fault,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall suddenly. She looked disorientated, twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands. \lquote My fault. I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for him to come and help us! If I hadn
\rquote t alerted Snape to what was going on, he might never have joined forces with the Death Eaters. I don\rquote t think he knew they were there before Filius told him, I don\rquote t think he knew they were coming.\rquote 
\par \lquote It isn\rquote t your fault, Minerva,\rquote  said Lupin firmly. \lquote We all wanted more help, we were glad to think Snape was on his way ...\rquote 
\par \lquote So when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death Eaters\rquote  side?\rquote  asked Harry, who wanted every detail of Snape\rquote s duplicity and infamy, feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him, to swear vengeance.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know exactly how it happened,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall distractedly. \lquote It\rquote s 
all so confusing ... Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case ... Remus, Bill and Nymphadora were to join us ... and so we patrolled. All seemed quiet. Every secret pa
ssageway out of the school was covered. We knew nobody could fly in. There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle. I still don\rquote t know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I do,\rquote  said Harry, and he explained, briefly, about the pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway they formed. \lquote So they got in through the Room of Requirement.\rquote 
\par Almost against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione, both of whom looked devastated.
\par \lquote I messed up, Harry,\rquote  said Ron bleakly. \lquote We did like you told us: we checked the Marauder\rquote s Map and we couldn\rquote 
t see Malfoy on it, so we thought he must be in the Room of Requirement, so me, Ginny and Neville went to keep watch on it ... but Malfoy got past us.\rquote 
\par \lquote He came out of the Room about an hour after we started keeping watch,\rquote  said Ginny. \lquote He was on his own, clutching that awful shrivelled arm \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote His Hand of Glory,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Gives light only to the holder, remember?\rquote 
\par \lquote Anyway,\rquote  Ginny went on, \lquote he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch black \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,\rquote  said Ron bitterly. \lquote Fred and George\rquote s. I\rquote m going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products.\rquote 
\par \lquote We tried everything \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Lumos, Incendio,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 said Ginny. \lquote 
Noth\-ing would penetrate the darkness; all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again, and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us. Obviously Malfoy could see because of that Hand thing and was guiding them, but we didn\rquote 
t dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other, and by the time we\rquote d reached a corridor that was light, they\rquote d gone.\rquote 
\par \lquote Luckily,\rquote  said Lupin hoarsely, \lquote Ron, Ginny and Neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had hap\-pened. We found the Death Eaters minutes later, heading in the direction of the Astronomy Tower. Malfoy obviously hadn
\rquote t expected more people to be on the watch; he seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder, at any rate. A fight broke out, they scattered and we gave chase. One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed up the Tower stairs \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote To set off the Mark?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote He must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote But I don\rquote t think Gibbon liked the idea of wait
ing up there alone for Dumbledore, because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me.\rquote 
\par \lquote So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny and Neville,\rquote  said Harry, turning to Hermione, \lquote were you \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Outside Snape\rquote s office, yes,\rquote  whispered Hermione, her eyes sparkling with tears, \lquote with Luna. We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened ... we didn\rquote 
t know what was going on upstairs, Ron had taken the Marauder\rquote s Map ... it was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons. He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I don\rquote 
t think he really registered that Luna and I were there at all, he just burst his way into Snape\rquote s office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came hurt\-
ling out of his room and he saw us and \endash  and \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  Harry urged her.
\par \lquote I was so stupid, Harry!\rquote  said Hermione in a high-pitched whisper. \lquote He said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he \endash  while he went to help fight the Death Eaters \endash \rquote 

\par She covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers, so that her voice was muffled.
\par \lquote We went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor ... and, oh, it\rquote s so obvious now, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we didn\rquote t realise, Harry, we didn\rquote 
t realise, we just let Snape go!\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s not your fault,\rquote  said Lupin firmly. \lquote Hermione, had you not obeyed Snape and got out of the way, he would probably have killed you and Luna.\rquote 
\par \lquote So then he came upstairs,\rquote  said Harry, who in his mind\rquote s eye was watching Snape running up the marble staircase, his black robes billowing behind him as ever, pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended, \lquote 
and he found the place where you were all fighting ...\rquote 
\par \lquote We were in trouble, we were losing,\rquote  said Tonks in a low voice. \lquote Gibbon was down, but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed read
y to fight to the death. Neville had been hurt, Bill had been savaged by Greyback ... it was all dark ... curses flying everywhere ... the Malfoy boy had vanished, he must have slipped past, up the stairs to the Tower ... then more of them ran after him, 
but one of them blocked the stairs behind them with some kind of curse ... Neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote None of us could break through,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote and that massive Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place, they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us ...\rquote 
\par \lquote And then Snape was there,\rquote  said Tonks, \lquote and then he wasn\rquote t \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I saw him running towards us, but that huge Death Eater\rquote s jinx just missed me right afterwards and I ducked and lost track of things,\rquote  said Ginny.
\par \lquote I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasn\rquote t there,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote I tried to follow him but was thrown back just like Neville ...\rquote 
\par \lquote He must have known a spell we didn\rquote t,\rquote  whispered McGonagall. \lquote After all \endash  he was the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ... I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters who\rquote 
d escaped up to the Tower ...\rquote 
\par \lquote He was,\rquote  said Harry savagely, \lquote but to help them, not to stop them ... and I\rquote ll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier \endash  so what happened when he came back down?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in, and also broke the curse blocking the stairs,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote We all ran forwards \endash  those of us who were still standing, anyway \endash 
 and then Snape and the boy emerged out of the dust \endash  obviously, none of us attacked them \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We just let them pass,\rquote  said Tonks in a hollow voice, \lquote we thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters \endash  and next thing, the other Death Eaters and Greyback were back and we were fighting again \endash 
 I thought I heard Snape shout something, but I don\rquote t know what \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He shouted, \'93It\rquote s over,\'94\rquote  said Harry. \lquote He\rquote d done what he\rquote d meant to do.\rquote 
\par They all fell silent. Fawkes\rquote s lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside. As the music reverberated upon the air, unbidden, unwelcome thoughts slunk into Harry\rquote s mind ... had they taken Dumbledore\rquote 
s body from the foot of the Tower yet? What would happen to it next? Where would it rest? He clenched his fists tightly in his pockets. He could feel the small cold lump of the fake Horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand.
\par The doors of the hospital wing burst open, making them all jump: Mr and Mrs Weasley were striding up the ward, Fleur just behind them, her beautiful face terrified.
\par \lquote Molly \endash  Arthur \endash \rquote  said Professor McGonagall, jumping up and hurrying to greet them. \lquote I am so sorry \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Bill,\rquote  whispered Mrs Weasley, darting past Professor McGonagall as she caught sight of Bill\rquote s mangled face. \lquote Oh, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Bill!\rquote }{

\par Lupin and Tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that Mr and Mrs Weasley could get nearer to the bed. Mrs Weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead.
\par \lquote You said Greyback attacked him?\rquote  Mr Weasley asked Professor McGonagall distractedly. \lquote But he hadn\rquote t trans\-formed? So what does that mean? What will happen to Bill?\rquote 
\par \lquote We don\rquote t yet know,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, looking helplessly at Lupin.
\par \lquote There will probably be some contamination, Arthur,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote It is an odd case, possibly unique ... we don\rquote t know what his behaviour might be like when he wakes up ...\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley took the nasty-smelling ointment from Madam Pomfrey and began dabbing at Bill\rquote s wounds.
\par \lquote And Dumbledore ...\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote Minerva, is it true ... is he really ...?\rquote 
\par As Professor McGonagall nodded, Harry felt Ginny move beside him and looked at her. Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur, who was gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face.
\par \lquote Dumbledore gone,\rquote  whispered Mr Weasley, but Mrs Weasley had eyes only for her eldest son; she began to sob, tears falling on to Bill\rquote s mutilated face.
\par \lquote Of course, it doesn\rquote t matter how he looks ... it\rquote s not r \endash  really important ... but he was a very handsome little b \endash  boy ... always very handsome ... and he was g \endash  going to be married!\rquote 
\par \lquote And what do you mean by zat?\rquote  said Fleur suddenly and loudly. \lquote What do you mean, \rquote e was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 going }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 to be married?\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled.
\par \lquote Well \endash  only that \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me any more?\rquote  demanded Fleur. \lquote You theenk, because of these bites, he will not love me?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, that\rquote s not what I \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Because \rquote e will!\rquote  said Fleur, drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair. \lquote It would take more zan a werewolf to stop Bill loving me!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, yes, I\rquote m sure,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, \lquote but I thought per\-haps \endash  given how \endash  how he \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or per\rquote aps, you \rquote oped?\rquote  said Fleur, her nostrils flaring. \lquote What do I care how \rquote 
e looks? I am good-looking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my husband is brave! And I shall do zat!\rquote  she added fiercely, pushing Mrs Weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her.
\par Mrs Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur mopping up Bill\rquote s wounds with a most curious expres\-sion upon her face. Nobody said anything; Harry did not dare move. Like everybody else, he was waiting for the explosion.
\par \lquote Our Great Auntie Muriel,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley after a long pause, \lquote has a very beautiful tiara \endash  goblin-made \endash 
 which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you for the wedding. She is very fond of Bill, you know, and it would look lovely with your hair.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote  said Fleur stiffly. \lquote I am sure zat will be lovely.\rquote 
\par And then \endash  Harry did not quite see how it happened \endash  both women were crying and hugging each other. Completely bewildered, wondering whether the world had gone mad, he turned round: Ron looked as stunned as Harry felt and Ginny 
and Hermione were exchanging startled looks.
\par \lquote You see!\rquote  said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at Lupin. \lquote She still wants to marry him, even though he\rquote s been bitten! She doesn\rquote t care!\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s different,\rquote  said Lupin, barely moving his lips and look\-ing suddenly tense. \lquote Bill will not be a full werewolf. The cases are completely \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But I don\rquote t care either, I don\rquote t care!\rquote  said Tonks, seizing the front of Lupin\rquote s robes and shaking them. \lquote I\rquote ve told you a million times ...\rquote 
\par And the meaning of Tonks\rquote s Patronus an
d her mouse-coloured hair, and the reason she had come running to find Dumbledore when she had heard a rumour someone had been attacked by Greyback, all suddenly became clear to Harry; it had not been Sirius that Tonks had fallen in love with after all ..
.
\par \lquote And I\rquote ve told }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 a million times,\rquote 
 said Lupin, refusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor, \lquote that I am too old for you, too poor ... too dangerous ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve said all along you\rquote re taking a ridiculous line on this, Remus,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley over Fleur\rquote s shoulder as she patted her on the back.
\par \lquote I am not being ridiculous,\rquote  said Lupin steadily. \lquote Tonks deserves somebody young and whole.\rquote 
\par \lquote But she wants you,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, with a small smile. \lquote And after all, Remus, young and whole men do not necessarily remain so.\rquote  He gestured sadly at his son, lying between them.
\par \lquote This is ... not the moment to discuss it,\rquote  said Lupin, avoiding everybody\rquote s eyes as he looked around distractedly. \lquote Dumbledore is dead ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall curtly, just as the hospital doors opened again and Hagrid walked in.
\par The little of his face that was not obscured by hair or beard was soaking and swollen; he was shaking with tears, a vast spotted handkerchief in his hand.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve ... I\rquote ve done it, Professor,\rquote  he choked. \lquote M \endash  moved him. Professor Sprout\rquote s got the kids back in bed. Professor Flitwick\rquote s lyin\rquote  down but he says he\rquote ll be all right in a jiffy, an
\rquote  Professor Slughorn says the Ministry\rquote s bin informed.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you, Hagrid,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, standing up at once and turning to look at the group around Bill\rquote s bed. \lquote I shall have to see the Ministry when they get here. Hagrid, please tell the Heads of House \endash 
 Slughorn can represent Slytherin \endash  that I want to see them in my office forthwith. I would like you to join us, too.\rquote 
\par As Hagrid nodded, turned and shuffled out of the room again, she looked down at Harry.
\par \lquote Before I meet them I would like a quick word with you, Harry. If you\rquote ll come with me ...\rquote 
\par Harry stood up, murmured, \lquote See you in a bit,\rquote  to Ron, Hermione and Ginny, and followed Professor McGonagall back down the ward. The corridors outside were deserted and the only sound was the distant
 phoenix song. It was several minutes before Harry became aware that they were not head\-ing for Professor McGonagall\rquote s office, but for Dumbledore\rquote 
s, and another few seconds before he realised that, of course, she had been Deputy Headmistress ... apparently she was now Headmistress ... so the room behind the gargoyle was now hers ...
\par In silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office. He did not know what he had expected: that the room would be draped in black, perhaps, or even that Dumbledore\rquote 
s body might be lying there. In fact, it looked almost exactly as it had done when he and Dumbledore had left it mere hours previously: the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindle-legged tables, Gryffindor\rquote s sword in it
s glass case gleaming in the moonlight, the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk. But Fawkes\rquote 
s perch stood empty; he was still crying his lament to the grounds. And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwart
s ... Dumbledore was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk, his half-moon spectacles perched upon his crooked nose, looking peaceful and untroubled.
\par After glancing once at this portrait, Professor McGonagall made an odd movement as though steeling herself, then rounded the desk to look at Harry, her face taut and lined.
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  she said, \lquote I would like to know what you and Professor Dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school.\rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t tell you that, Professor,\rquote  said Harry. He had expe
cted the question and had his answer ready. It had been here, in this very room, that Dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione.
\par \lquote Harry, it might be important,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall.
\par \lquote It is,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote very, but he didn\rquote t want me to tell anyone.\rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall glared at him.
\par \lquote Potter\rquote  (Harry registered the renewed use of his surname) \lquote in the light of Professor Dumbledore\rquote s death, I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think so,\rquote  said Harry, shrugging. \lquote Professor Dumbledore never told me to stop following his orders if he died.\rquote 
\par \lquote But \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote There\rquote s one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here, though. Madam Rosmerta\rquote s under the Imperius Curse, she was helping Malfoy and the Death Eaters, that\rquote s how the necklace and the poisoned mead \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote Rosmerta?\rquote  said Professor McGonagall incredulously, but before she could go on, there was a knock on the door behind them and Professors Sprout, Flitwick an
d Slughorn traipsed into the room, followed by Hagrid, who was still weeping copiously, his huge frame trembling with grief.
\par \lquote Snape!\rquote  ejaculated Slughorn, who looked the most shaken, pale and sweating. \lquote Snape! I taught him! I thought I knew him!\rquote 
\par But before any of them could respond to this, a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall: a sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas.
\par \lquote Minerva, the Minister will be here within seconds, he has just Disapparated from the Ministry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you, Everard,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, and she turned quickly to her teachers.
\par \lquote I want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets here,\rquote  she said quickly. \lquote Personally, I am not convinced that the school should reopen next 
year. The death of the Headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwarts\rquote  history. It is horrible.\rquote 
\par \lquote I am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open,\rquote  said Professor Sprout. \lquote I feel that if a single pupil wants to come, then the school ought to remain open for that pupil.\rquote 
\par \lquote But will we have a single pupil after this?\rquote  said Slughorn, now dabbing his sweating brow with a silken handkerchief. \lquote Parents will want to keep their children at home and I can\rquote t say I blame them. Personally, I don\rquote 
t think we\rquote re in more danger at Hogwarts than we are anywhere else, but you can\rquote t expect mothers to think like that. They\rquote ll want to keep their families together, it\rquote s only natural.\rquote 
\par \lquote I agree,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote And in any case, it is not true to say that Dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close. When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered the closure of the school 
\endash  and I must say that Professor Dumbledore\rquote s murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of Slytherin\rquote s monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle ...\rquote 
\par \lquote We must consult the governors,\rquote  said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice; he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in Snape\rquote s office. \lquote 
We must follow the established procedures. A decision should not be made hastily.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hagrid, you haven\rquote t said anything,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote What are your views, ought Hogwarts to remain open?\rquote 
\par Hagrid, who had been weeping silently into his large spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation, now raised puffy red eyes and croaked, \lquote I dunno, Professor ... that\rquote s fer the Heads of House an\rquote  the Headmistress ter decide ...
\rquote 
\par \lquote Professor Dumbledore always valued your views,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall kindly, \lquote and so do I.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote m stayin\rquote ,\rquote  said Hagrid, fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard. \lquote It\rquote s me home, it\rquote s bin me home since I was thirteen. An\rquote  if there
\rquote s kids who wan\rquote  me ter teach \rquote em, I\rquote ll do it. But ... I dunno ... Hogwarts without Dumbledore ...\rquote 
\par He gulped and disappeared behind his handkerchief once more, and there was silence.
\par \lquote Very well,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the window at the grounds, checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching, \lquote 
then I must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors, who will take the final decision.
\par \lquote Now, as to getting students home ... there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later. We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come tomorrow if necessary \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What about Dumbledore\rquote s funeral?\rquote  said Harry, speaking at last.
\par \lquote Well ...\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her voice shook, \lquote I \endash  I know that it was Dumbledore\rquote s wish to be laid to rest here, at Hogwarts \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Then that\rquote s what\rquote ll happen, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Harry fiercely.
\par \lquote If the Ministry thinks it appropriate,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote No other headmaster or headmistress has ever been \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school,\rquote  growled Hagrid.
\par \lquote Hogwarts should be Dumbledore\rquote s final resting place,\rquote  said Professor Flitwick.
\par \lquote Absolutely,\rquote  said Professor Sprout.
\par \lquote And in that case,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote you shouldn\rquote t send the students home until the funeral\rquote s over. They\rquote ll want to say \endash \rquote 
\par The last word caught in his throat, but Professor Sprout completed the sentence for him.
\par \lquote Goodbye.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well said,\rquote  squeaked Professor Flitwick. \lquote Well said indeed! Our students should pay tribute, it is fitting. We can arrange transport home afterwards.\rquote 
\par \lquote Seconded,\rquote  barked Professor Sprout.
\par \lquote I suppose ... yes ...\rquote  said Slughorn in a rather agitated voice, while Hagrid let out a strangled sob of assent.
\par \lquote He\rquote s coming,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall suddenly, gazing down into the grounds. \lquote The Minister ... and by the looks of it, he\rquote s brought a delegation ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Can I leave, Professor?\rquote  said Harry at once.
\par He had no desire at all to see, or be interrogated by, Rufus Scrimgeour tonight.
\par \lquote You may,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, \lquote and quickly.\rquote 
\par She strode towards the door and held it open for him. He sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor; he had left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy 
Tower, but it did not matter; there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass, not even Filch, Mrs Norris or Peeves. He did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the Gryffindor common room.
\par \lquote Is it true?\rquote  whispered the Fat Lady as he approached her. \lquote Is it really true? Dumbledore \endash  dead?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry.
\par She let out a wail and, without waiting for the password, swung forwards to admit him.
\par As Harry had suspected it would be, the common room was jam-packed. The room fell silent as he climbed through the portrait hole. He saw Dean and Seamus sitting in a group nearby: this meant that the dormitory must be empty, or nearly so. Without speaking
 to anybody, without making eye-contact at all, Harry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boys\rquote  dormitories.
\par As he had hoped, Ron was waiting for him, still fully dressed, sitting on his bed. Harry sat down on his own four-poster and, for a moment, they simply stared at each other.
\par \lquote They\rquote re talking about closing the school,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Lupin said they would,\rquote  said Ron.
\par There was a pause.
\par \lquote So?\rquote  said Ron in a very low voice, as though he thought the furniture might be listening in. \lquote Did you find one? Did you get it? A \endash  a Horcrux?\rquote 
\par Harry shook his head. All that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old nightmare now; had it really happened, and only hours ago?
\par \lquote You didn\rquote t get it?\rquote  said Ron, looking crestfallen. \lquote It wasn\rquote t there?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Someone had already taken it and left a fake in its place.\rquote 
\par \lquote Already }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 taken \endash }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 ?\rquote 
\par Wordlessly, Harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket, opened it and passed it to Ron. The full story could wait ... it did not matter tonight ... nothing mattered except the end, the end of their pointless adventure, the end of Dumbledore\rquote 
s life ...
\par \lquote R.A.B.,\rquote  whispered Ron, \lquote but who was that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dunno,\rquote  said Harry, lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards. He felt no curios
ity at all about R.A.B.: he doubted that he would ever feel curious again. As he lay there, he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent. Fawkes had stopped singing.
\par And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world ... had left Harry.

All lessons were suspended, all examinations postponed. Some students were hurried away from Hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of days \endash  the Patil twins were gone before breakfast on the morning following Dumbledore\rquote 
s death and Zacharias Smith was escorted from the castle by his haughty-looking father. Seamus Finnigan, on the other hand, refused point-blank to
 accompany his mother home; they had a shouting match in the Entrance Hall which was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral. She had difficulty in finding a bed in Hogsmeade, Seamus told Harry and Ron, for wizards and witches
 were pouring into the village, preparing to pay their last respects to Dumbledore.

Some excitement was caused among the younger students, who had never seen it before, when a powder-blue carriage the size of a house, pulled by a dozen giant winged palo\-
minos, came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the Forest. Harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned, black-haired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into 
the waiting Hagrid\rquote 
s arms. Meanwhile a delegation of Ministry officials, including the Minister for Magic himself, was being accommodated within the castle. Harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them; he was sure that, sooner or later, he would 
be asked again to account for Dumbledore\rquote s last excursion from Hogwarts.
\par Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny were spending all of their time together. The beautiful weather seemed to mock them; Harry could imagine how it would have been if Dumbledore had not di
ed, and they had had this time together at the very end of the year, Ginny\rquote 
s examinations finished, the pressure of homework lifted ... and hour by hour, he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say, doing what he knew it was right to do, because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort.
\par They visited the hospital wing twice a day: Neville had been discharged, but Bill remained under Madam Pomfrey\rquote s care. His scars were as bad as ever; in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Ey
e Moody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs, but in personality he seemed just the same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare steaks.
\par \lquote ... so eet ees lucky \rquote e is marrying me,\rquote  said Fleur happily, plumping up Bill\rquote s pillows, \lquote because ze British overcook their meat, I \rquote ave always said this.\rquote 
\par \lquote I suppose I\rquote m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her,\rquote  sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron and Hermione sat beside t
he open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over the twilit grounds.
\par \lquote She\rquote s not that bad,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Ugly, though,\rquote  he added hastily, as Ginny raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.
\par \lquote Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.\rquote 
\par \lquote Anyone else we know died?\rquote  Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Evening Prophet.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  she said reprovingly, folding up the newspaper. \lquote They\rquote re still looking for Snape, but no sign ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course there isn\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry, who became angry every time this subject cropped up. \lquote They won\rquote t find Snape till they find Voldemort, and seeing as they\rquote ve never managed to do that in all this time ...
\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m going to go to bed,\rquote  yawned Ginny. \lquote I haven\rquote t been sleeping that well since ... well ... I could do with some sleep.\rquote 
\par She kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved at the other two and departed for the girls\rquote  dormitories. The moment the door had closed behind her, Hermione leaned forwards towards Harry with a most Hermione-ish look on her face.
\par \lquote Harry, I found something out this morning, in the library ...\rquote 
\par \lquote R.A.B.?\rquote  said Harry, sitting up straight.
\par He did not feel the way he had so often felt before, excited, curious, burning to get to the bottom
 of a mystery; he simply knew that the task of discovering the truth about the real Horcrux had to be completed before he could move a little further along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of him, the path that he and Dumbledore had set out upon
 together, and which he now knew he would have to journey alone. There might still be as many as four Horcruxes out there somewhere and each would need to be found and elim\-
inated before there was even a possibility that Voldemort could be killed. He kept reciting their names to himself, as though by listing them he could bring them within reach: \lquote the locket ... the cup ... the snake ... something of Gryffindor
\rquote s or Ravenclaw\rquote s ... the locket ... the cup ... the snake ... something of Gryffindor\rquote s or Ravenclaw\rquote s ...\rquote 
\par This mantra seemed to pulse through Harry\rquote s mind as he fell asleep at night, and his dreams were thick with cups, lockets and mysterious objects that he could not quite reach, though Dumbledore helpfully offered Harry a rope ladder that turned to
 snakes the moment he began to climb ...
\par He had shown Hermione the note inside the locket the morning after Dumbledore\rquote s death, and although she had not immediately recognised the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading
, she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  she said sadly, \lquote I\rquote ve been trying, Harry, but I haven\rquote t found anything ... there are a couple of reasonably well-known wizards with those initials \endash  Rosalind Antigone Bungs ... Rupert \'93Axebanger\'94
 Brookstanton ... but they don\rquote t seem to fit at all. Judging by that note, the person who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort, and I can\rquote t find a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do with him ... no, actually, it
\rquote s about ... well, Snape.\rquote 
\par She looked nervous even saying the name again.
\par \lquote What about him?\rquote  asked Harry heavily, slumping back in his chair.
\par \lquote Well, it\rquote s just that I was sort of right about the Half-Blood Prince business,\rquote  she said tentatively.
\par \lquote D\rquote you have to rub it in, Hermione? How d\rquote you think I feel about that now?\rquote 
\par \lquote No \endash  no \endash  Harry, I didn\rquote t mean that!\rquote  she said hastily, look\-ing around to check that they were not being overheard. \lquote It\rquote s just 
that I was right about Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see ... she was Snape\rquote s mother!\rquote 
\par \lquote I thought she wasn\rquote t much of a looker,\rquote  said Ron. Hermione ignored him.
\par \lquote I was going through the rest of the old }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 Prophets }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid7101699 
and there was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape, and then later an announcement saying that she\rquote d given birth to a \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  murderer,\rquote  spat Harry.
\par \lquote Well ... yes,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote So ... I was sort of right. Snape must have been proud of being \'93half a Prince\'94, you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle from what it said in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par He broke off, looking out of the window. He could not stop himself dwelling upon Dumbledore\rquote 
s inexcusable trust in Snape ... but as Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same ... in spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had re

\par \lquote I don\rquote t think he wanted to associate himself with that book,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote I don\rquote t think Dumbledore would have liked it very much if he\rquote d known. And even if Snape pre\-tended it hadn\rquote 
t been his, Slughorn would have recognised his writing at once. Anyway, the book was left in Snape\rquote s old classroom, and I\rquote ll bet Dumbledore knew his mother was called \'93Prince\'94.\rquote 
\par \lquote I should\rquote ve shown the book to Dumbledore,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote All that time he was showing me how Voldemort was evil even when he was at school, and I had proof Snape was, too \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \'93Evil\'94 is a strong word,\rquote  said Hermione quietly.
\par \lquote You were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m trying to say, Harry, that you\rquote re putting too much blame on yourself. I thought the Prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humour, but I would never have guessed he was a potential killer ...\rquote 
\par \lquote None of us could\rquote ve guessed Snape would ... you know,\rquote  said Ron.
\par Silence fell between them, each of them lost in their own thoughts, but Harry was sure that they, like him, were think\-ing about the following morning, when Dumbledore\rquote 
s body would be laid to rest. Harry had never attended a funeral before; there had been no body to bury when Sirius had died. He did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see, about how he would feel. He won\-
dered whether Dumbledore\rquote s death would be more real to him once the funeral was over. Though he had moments when the horrible fact
 of it threatened to overwhelm him, there were blank stretches of numbness where, despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle, he still found it difficult to believe that Dumbledore had really gone. Admittedly he had n
o
t, as he had with Sirius, looked desperately for some kind of loophole, some way that Dumbledore would come back ... he felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake Horcrux, which he now carried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but as a remind
er of what it had cost and what remained still to do.
\par Harry rose early to pack the next day; the Hogwarts Express would be leaving an hour after the funeral. Down\-stairs he found the mood in the Great Hall subdued. Every\-body was wearing their dress robes a
nd no one seemed very hungry. Professor McGonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty. Hagrid\rquote s chair was des\-erted too: Harry thought that perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast; but Snape\rquote 
s place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour. Harry avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour was looking for him. Among Scrimgeour\rquote 
s entourage Harry spotted the red hair and horn-rimmed glasses of Percy Weasley. Ron gave no sign that he was aware of Percy, apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom.
\par Over at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were mutter\-ing together. Hulking boys though they were, they looked oddly lonely without the tal
l, pale figure of Malfoy between them, bossing them around. Harry had not spared Malfoy much thought. His animosity was all for Snape, but he had not forgotten the fear in Malfoy\rquote 
s voice on that Tower top, nor the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other Death Eaters arrived. Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have killed Dumbledore. He despised Malfoy still for his infatu\-
ation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike. Where, Harry wondered, was Malfoy now, and what was Voldemort making him do under threat of killing him and his parents?
\par Harry\rquote s thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from Ginny. Professor McGonagall had risen to her feet and the mournful hum in the Hall died away at once.
\par \lquote It is nearly time,\rquote  she said. \lquote Please follow your Heads of House out into the grounds. Gryffindors, after me.\rquote 
\par They filed out from behind their benches in near silence. Harry glimpsed Slughorn at the head of the Slytherin column, wearing magnificent long emerald
-green robes embroidered with silver. He had never seen Professor Sprout, Head of the Hufflepuffs, looking so clean; there was not a single patch on her hat, and when they reached the Entrance Hall, they found Madam Pince standing beside Filch, she in a t
hick black veil that fell to her knees, he in an ancient black suit and tie reek\-ing of mothballs.
\par They were heading, as Harry saw when he stepped out on to the stone steps from the front doors, towards the lake. The warmth of the sun caressed his face as t
hey followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows. An aisle ran down the centre of them: there was a marble table standing at the front, all chairs facing it. It was the most beautiful summer
\rquote s day.
\par An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs: shabby and smart, old and young. Most Harry did not recognise, but there were a few that he did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt, Mad-Ey
e Moody, Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink, Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands, Mr and Mrs Weasley, Bill sup\-
ported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black dragonskin. Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up two-and-a-half chairs on her own, Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron, Arabella Figg, Harry\rquote 
s Squib neighbour, the hairy bass player from the wizarding group the Weird Sisters, Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight Bus, Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley, and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hog
\rquote s Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express. The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially in the gleaming air.
\par Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake. People were whispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in the grass, but t
he birdsong was louder by far. The crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of them, Harry saw Neville being helped into a seat by Luna. They alone of all the DA had responded to Hermione\rquote 
s summons the night that Dumbledore had died, and Harry knew why: they were the ones who had missed the DA most ... probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting ...
\par Cornelius Fudge walked past them towards the front rows, his expression miserable, twirling his green bowler hat as usual; Harry next recognised Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuri\-
ated to see, had a notebook clutched in her red-taloned hand; and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an unconvincing expression of grief 
upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her iron-coloured curls. At the sight of the centaur Firenze, who was standing like a sentinel near the water\rquote s edge, she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away.
\par The staff were
 seated at last. Harry could see Scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front row with Professor McGonagall. He wondered whether Scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that Dumbledore was dead. But then he heard music, strang
e, otherworldly music, and he forgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking around for the source of it. He was not the only one: many heads were turning, searching, a little alarmed.
\par \lquote In there,\rquote  whispered Ginny in Harry\rquote s ear.
\par And he saw them in the clear 
green sunlit water, inches below the surface, reminding him horribly of the Inferi; a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand, their pallid faces rippling, their purplish hair flowing all around them. The music made the hai
r on Harry\rquote s neck stand up and yet it was not unpleasant. It spoke very clearly of loss and of despair. As he looked down into the wild faces of the singers he had the feeling that they, at least, were sorry for Dumbledore\rquote 
s passing. Then Ginny nudged him again and he looked round.
\par Hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs. He was crying quite silently, his face gleaming with tears, and in his arms, wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was what Harry knew to be Dumbledore\rquote s bo
dy. A sharp pain rose in Harry\rquote s throat at this sight: for a moment, the strange music and the knowledge that Dumbledore\rquote 
s body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day. Ron looked white and shocked. Tears were falling thick and fast into both Ginny and Hermione\rquote s laps.
\par They could not see clearly what was happening at the front. Hagrid seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table. Now he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalised looks from some, including, Har
ry saw, Dolores Umbridge ... but Harry knew that Dumbledore would not have cared. He tried to make a friendly gesture to Hagrid as he passed, but Hagrid\rquote 
s eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going. Harry glanced at the back row to which Hagrid was heading and realised what was guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small mar\-
quee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulder-like head bowed, docile, almost human. Hagrid sat down next to his half-brother and Grawp patted Hagrid hard on the head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground. Harry had a wonder\-
ful momentary urge to laugh. But then the music stopped and he turned to face the front again.
\par A little tufty-haired man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of Dumbledore\rquote s body. Harry could not hear what he was saying. Odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of heads. \lquote Nobility of spirit\rquote 
 ... \lquote intel\-lectual contribution\rquote  ... \lquote greatness of heart\rquote  ... it did not mean very much. It had little to do with Dumbledore as Harry had known him. He suddenly remembered Dumbledore\rquote s idea of a few words: \lquote 
nitwit\rquote , \lquote oddment\rquote , \lquote blubber\rquote  and \lquote tweak\rquote , and again, had to suppress a grin ... what was the matter with him?
\par There was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to listen, too. He remembered Dumbledore crouching at the water\rquote 
s edge two years ago, very close to where Harry now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess. Harry wondered where Dumbledore had learned Mermish. There was so much he had never asked him, so much he should have said ...
\par And then, without warning, it swept over him, the dreadful truth, more completely and undeniably than it had until now. Du
mbledore was dead, gone ... he clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes: he looked away from Ginny and the others and stared out over the lake, towards the Forest, as the littl
e man in black droned on ... there was movement among the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their respects, too. They did not move into the open but Harry saw them standing quite still, half-hidden in shadow, watching the wiz\-
ards, their bows hanging at their sides. And Harry remem\-
bered his first nightmarish trip into the Forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then Voldemort, and how he had faced him, and how he and Dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long ther
eafter. It was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated ...
\par And Harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about him 
had stood in front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all determined to protect him; but now that was over. He could not let anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he must abandon for ever the illusion
 he ought to have lost at the age of one: that the shelter of a parent\rquote 
s arms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last 
and greatest of his protectors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before.
\par The little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat. Harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet; he expected speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody moved.
\par Then several people screamed. Bright, white flames had erupted around Dumbledore\rquote s body and the table upon which it lay: higher and higher they rose, obscuring the body. White smoke spiralled into the air and made strange sh
apes: Harry thought, for one heart-stopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished. In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing Dumbledore\rquote s body and the table on which he had rested.

\par There were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air, but they fell far short of the crowd. It was, Harry knew, the centaurs\rquote  tribute: he saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees. Likewise the mer\-
people sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view.
\par Harry looked at Ginny, Ron and Hermione: Ron\rquote s face was screwed up as though the sunlight was blinding him. Hermione\rquote s face was glazed with tears, but Ginny was no longer crying. She met Harry\rquote s gaze with the sa
me hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was going to do now, she would not say 
\lquote Be careful\rquote , or \lquote Don\rquote t do it\rquote , but accept his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of him. And so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since Dumbledore had died.
\par \lquote Ginny, listen ...\rquote  he said very quietly, as the buzz of con\-versation grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet. \lquote I can\rquote t be involved with you any more. We\rquote ve got to stop seeing each other. We can
\rquote t be together.\rquote 
\par She said, with an oddly twisted smile, \lquote It\rquote s for some stupid, noble reason, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s been like ... like something out of someone else\rquote s life, these last few weeks with you,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote But I can\rquote t ... we can\rquote t ... I\rquote ve got things to do alone now.\rquote 
\par She did not cry, she simply looked at him.
\par \lquote Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to. He\rquote s already used you as bait once, and that was just because you\rquote re my best friend\rquote s sister. Think how much danger you\rquote ll be in if we keep this up. He\rquote ll know, he
\rquote ll find out. He\rquote ll try and get to me through you.\rquote 
\par \lquote What if I don\rquote t care?\rquote  said Ginny fiercely.
\par \lquote I care,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote How do you think I\rquote d feel if this was your funeral ... and it was my fault ...\rquote 
\par She looked away from him, over the lake.
\par \lquote I never really gave up on you,\rquote  she said. \lquote Not really. I always hoped ... Hermione 
told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more \endash  myself.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Smart girl, that Hermione,\rquote  said Harry, trying to smile. \lquote I just wish I\rquote d asked you sooner. We could\rquote ve had ages ... months ... years maybe ...\rquote 
\par \lquote But you\rquote ve been too busy saving the wizarding world,\rquote  said Ginny, half-laughing. \lquote Well ... I can\rquote t say I\rquote m surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn\rquote 
t be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that\rquote s why I like you so much.\rquote 
\par Harry could not bear to hear these things, nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her
. Ron, he saw, was now holding Hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own long nose. With a miserable gesture, Harry got up, turned his back on Ginny and on Dumbledore\rquote 
s tomb and walked away around the lake. Moving felt much more bearable than sitting still: just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it ...
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote 
\par He turned. Rufus Scrimgeour was limping rapidly towards him around the bank, leaning on his walking stick.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve been hoping to have a word ... do you mind if I walk a little way with you?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry indifferently, and set off again.
\par \lquote Harry, this was a dreadful tragedy,\rquote  said Scrimgeour quietly, \lquote I cannot tell you how appalled I was to hear of it. Dumbledore was a very great wizard. We had our disagree\-ments, as you know, but no one knows better than I \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you want?\rquote  asked Harry flatly.
\par Scrimgeour looked annoyed but, as before, hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful understanding.
\par \lquote You are, of course, devastated,\rquote  he said. \lquote I know that you were very close to Dumbledore. I think you may have been his favourite ever pupil. The bond between the two of you \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What do you want?\rquote  Harry repeated, coming to a halt.
\par Scrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick and stared at Harry, his expression shrewd now.
\par \lquote The word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died.\rquote 
\par \lquote Whose word?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the Tower after Dumbledore died. There were also two broomsticks up there. The Ministry can add two and two, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Glad to hear it,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Well, where I went with Dumbledore and what we did is my business. He didn\rquote t want people to know.\rquote 
\par \lquote Such loyalty is admirable, of course,\rquote  said Scrimgeour, who seemed to be restraining his irritation with difficulty, \lquote but Dumbledore is gone, Harry. He\rquote s gone.\rquote 
\par \lquote He will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him,\rquote  said Harry, smiling in spite of himself.
\par \lquote My dear boy ... even Dumbledore cannot return from the \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I am not saying he can. You wouldn\rquote t understand. But I\rquote ve got nothing to tell you.\rquote 
\par Scrimgeour hesitated, then said, in what was evidently supposed to be a tone of delicacy, \lquote The Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection, you know, Harry. I would be delighted to place a couple of my Aurors at your service \endash \rquote 

\par Harry laughed.
\par \lquote Voldemort wants to kill me himself and Aurors won\rquote t stop him. So thanks for the offer, but no thanks.\rquote 
\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Scrimgeour, his voice cold now, \lquote the request I made of you at Christmas \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What request? Oh yeah ... the one where I tell the world what a great job you\rquote re doing in exchange for \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  for raising everyone\rquote s morale!\rquote  snapped Scrimgeour.
\par Harry considered him for a moment.
\par \lquote Released Stan Shunpike yet?\rquote 
\par Scrimgeour turned a nasty purple colour highly remin\-iscent of Uncle Vernon.
\par \lquote I see you are \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s man through and through,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote That\rquote s right.\rquote 
\par Scrimgeour glared
 at him for another moment, then turned and limped away without another word. Harry could see Percy and the rest of the Ministry delegation waiting for him, casting nervous glances at the sobbing Hagrid and Grawp, who were still in their seats. Ron and He
rmione were hurry\-ing towards Harry, passing Scrimgeour going in the opposite direction; Harry turned and walked slowly on, waiting for them to catch up, which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in happier times.

\par \lquote What did Scrimgeour want?\rquote  Hermione whispered.
\par \lquote Same as he wanted at Christmas,\rquote  shrugged Harry. \lquote Wanted me to give him inside information on Dumbledore and be the Ministry\rquote s new poster boy.\rquote 
\par Ron seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, then he said loudly to Hermione, \lquote Look, let me go back and hit Percy!\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  she said firmly, grabbing his arm.
\par \lquote It\rquote ll make me feel better!\rquote 
\par Harry laughed. Even Hermione grinned a little, though her smile faded as she looked up at the castle.
\par \lquote I can\rquote t bear the idea that we might never come back,\rquote  she said softly. \lquote How can Hogwarts close?\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe it won\rquote t,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote We\rquote re not in any more danger here than we are at home, are we? Everywhere\rquote s the same now. I\rquote d even say Hogwarts is safer, there are more
 wizards inside to defend the place. What d\rquote you reckon, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not coming back even if it does reopen,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Ron gaped at him, but Hermione said sadly, \lquote I knew you were going to say that. But then what will you do?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m going back to the Dursleys\rquote  once more, because Dumbledore wanted me to,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote But it\rquote ll be a short visit, and then I\rquote ll be gone for good.\rquote 
\par \lquote But where will you go if you don\rquote t come back to school?\rquote 
\par \lquote I thought I might go back to Godric\rquote s Hollow,\rquote  Harry mut\-tered. He had had the idea in his head ever since the night of Dumbledore\rquote s death. \lquote For me, it started there, all of it. I\rquote 
ve just got a feeling I need to go there. And I can visit my parents\rquote  graves, I\rquote d like that.\rquote 
\par \lquote And then what?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Then I\rquote ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, haven\rquote t I?\rquote  said Harry, his eyes upon Dumbledore\rquote s white tomb, reflected in the water on the other side of the lake. \lquote That\rquote 
s what he wanted me to do, that\rquote s why he told me all about them. If Dumbledore was right \endash  and I\rquote m sure he was \endash  there are still four of them out there. I\rquote ve got to find them and destroy them and then I\rquote 
ve got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemort\rquote s soul, the bit that\rquote s still in his body, and I\rquote m the one who\rquote s going to kill him. And if I meet Severus Snape along the way,\rquote  he added, \lquote 
so much the better for me, so much the worse for him.\rquote 
\par There was a long silence. The crowd had almost dispersed now, the stragglers giving the monumental figure of Grawp a wide berth as he cuddled Hagrid, whose howls of grief were still echoing across the water.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll be there, Harry,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote What?\rquote 
\par \lquote At your aunt and uncle\rquote s house,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote And then we\rquote ll go with you, wherever you\rquote re going.\rquote 
\par \lquote No \endash \rquote  said Harry quickly; he had not counted on this, he had meant them to understand that he was undertaking this most dangerous journey alone.
\par \lquote You said to us once before,\rquote  said Hermione quietly, \lquote that there was time to turn back if we wanted to. We\rquote ve had time, haven\rquote t we?\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re with you whatever happens,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote But, mate, you\rquote re going to have to come round my mum and dad\rquote s house before we do anything else, even Godric\rquote s Hollow.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why?\rquote 
\par \lquote Bill and Fleur\rquote s wedding, remember?\rquote 
\par Harry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful.
\par \lquote Yeah, we shouldn\rquote t miss that,\rquote  he said finally.
\par His hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meet\-
ing with Voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione.
