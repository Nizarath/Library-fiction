Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework, but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he also hap\-
pened to be a wizard.

Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognising it. On the 
rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame-Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin t
he Weird enjoyed being burnt so much that she allowed herself to be caught no fewer than forty-seven times in various disguises.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196

Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and 
very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it and began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he\rquote 
d probably find himself locked in the cup\-board under the stairs for the rest of the summer.

son that Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and their son, Dudley, were Harry\rquote s only living rela\-tives. They were Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude towards magic. Harry\rquote 
s dead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the Dursleys\rquote  roof. For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they 
kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to squash the magic out of him. To their fury, they had been unsuccessful, and now lived in terror of anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School of Witchc
raft and Wizardry. The most the Dursleys could do these days was to lock away Harry\rquote s spellbooks, wand, cauldron and broomstick at the start of the summer holidays, and forbid him to talk to the neighbours.
\par This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry, because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work. One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about Shrinking Potions, was for Harry\rquote 
s least favourite teacher, Professor Snape, who would be delighted to have an excu
se to give Harry detention for a month. Harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays. While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire Uncle Vernon\rquote 
s new company car (in very loud voices, so that the rest of the street would notice it too), Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his books and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn\rquote 
t leave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by night.
\par Harry was keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at the moment, as they were already in a bad mood with him, all because he\rquote d received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school holidays.
\par Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry\rquote s best friends at Hogwarts, came from a whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn\rquote 
t, but had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily, it had been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call.

\par Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he heard Ron\rquote s voice answer.
\par \lquote HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I \endash  WANT \endash  TO \endash  TALK \endash  TO \endash  HARRY \endash  POTTER!\rquote 
\par Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expres\-sion of mingled fury and alarm.
\par \lquote WHO IS THIS?\rquote  he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece. \lquote WHO ARE YOU?\rquote 
\par \lquote RON \endash  WEASLEY!\rquote  Ron bellowed back, as though he and Uncle Vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football pitch. \lquote I\rquote M \endash  A \endash  FRIEND \endash  OF \endash  HARRY\rquote S \endash  FROM \endash  SCHOOL

T YOU COME NEAR MY FAMILY!\rquote

t been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had warned Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry\rquote s year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well
 how to use a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts.
\par So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one. There was just one, very small improvement: after swearing that he wouldn\rquote 
t use her to send letters to any of his friends, Harry had been allowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in because of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the time.
\par Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to listen again. The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant, grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late. Harry\rquote s eyes were i
tching with tiredness. Perhaps he\rquote d finish this essay tomorrow night ...
\par He replaced the top of the ink bottle, pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed, put the torch, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 A History of Magic,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196  his essay, quill and ink inside it, got out of bed and hid the l
ot under a loose floorboard under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table.
\par It was one o\rquote clock in the morning. Harry\rquote s stomach gave a funny jolt. He had been thirteen years old, without realising it, for a whole hour.
\par Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays. He had never received a birthday card in his life. The Dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had no reason to sup
pose they would remember this one.
\par Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig\rquote s large, empty cage, to the open window. He leant on the sill, the cool night air pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been absent for two nights now. Harry wasn
\rquote t worried about her \endash  she\rquote d been gone this long before \endash  but he hoped she\rquote d be back soon. She was the only living creature in this house who didn\rquote t flinch at the sight of him.
\par Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, ha
d grown a few inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had been: stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The eyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a thi
n scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.
\par Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most extraordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry\rquote s par\-ents, because Lily 
and James Potter had not died in a car crash. They had been murdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, when Voldemort\rquote 
s curse, instead of killing him, had rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive, Voldemort had fled ...
\par But Harry had come face to face with him since at Hogwarts. Remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thir\-teenth birthday.
\par He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting praise. Gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before Harry realised what he was seeing.
\par Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every moment, was a large, strangely lop-sided creature, and it was flap\-ping in Harry\rquote 
s direction. He stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For a split second, he hesitated, his hand on the window-latch, wondering whether to slam it shut, but then the bizarre creature soared over one of the streetlamps of Privet Drive, and H
arry, realising what it was, leapt aside.
\par Through the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third, which appeared to be unconscious. They landed with a soft }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 flump }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 on Harry\rquote s bed, and the middle owl, which was large and grey, keeled right over and lay motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs.
\par Harry recognised the unconscious owl at once \endash  his name was Errol, and he belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed at once, untied the cords around Errol\rquote s legs, took off the par\-cel and then carried Errol to Hedwig\rquote 
s cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to gulp some water.
\par Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy female, was his own Hedwig. She, too, was carryin
g a parcel, and looked extremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to join Errol.
\par Harry didn\rquote t recognise the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knew at once where
 it had come from, because in addition to a third parcel, it was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relieved this owl of its post it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched its wings and took off through the window into the night
.
\par Harry sat down on his bed, grabbed Errol\rquote s package, ripped off the brown paper and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and his first ever birthday card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened the envelope. Two pieces of paper fell out \endash 
 a letter and a newspaper cutting.
\par The cutting had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper, the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Daily Prophet, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 because the people in the black and white pic\-ture were moving. Harry picked up the cutting, smoothed it out and read:

\par Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world \endash  highly dangerous, very exciting and played on broom\-
sticks. Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts house teams. One of Harry\rquote s most prized posses\-sions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
\par Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He recognised the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: this was from Hagrid, the Hogwarts 
gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it snapped loudly \endash  as though it had jaws.
\par Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him any\-thing dangerous on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn\rquote t have a nor\-mal person\rquote 
s view of what was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin.
\par Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand and raised it over his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in
 his other hand and pulled.
\par And out fell \endash  a book. Harry just had time to register its hand\-some green cover, emblazoned with the golden title, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 The Monster Book of Monsters, }{

\par \lquote Uh oh,\rquote  Harry muttered.
\par The book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly across the room. Harry followed it stealthily. The book was hiding in the dark space under his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still fast asleep, Har
ry got down on his hands and knees and reached towards it.
\par \lquote Ouch!\rquote 
\par The book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him, still scuttling on its covers. Harry scrambled around, threw himself forward and managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, sleepy grunt in the room next door.
\par Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms, hurried to his chest of drawers and pulled out a belt, which he buckled tightly around it. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

Harry went down to breakfast next morning to find the three Dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table. They were watching 
a brand-new television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen, his piggy little ey
es fixed on the screen and his five chins wob\-bling as he ate continually.

Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of moustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy birthday, none of the Dursleys gave an
y sign that they had noticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far too used to this to care. He helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the newsreader on the television, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict.
\par \lquote ... the public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dan\-gerous. A special hotline has been set up, and any sighting of Black should be reported immediately.\rquote

 snorted Uncle Vernon, staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner. \lquote Look at the state of him, the filthy layabout! Look at his hair!\rquote 
\par He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt
 face was surrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed.
\par The newsreader had reappeared.
\par \lquote The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hang on!\rquote  barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the news\-reader. \lquote You didn\rquote t tell us where that maniac\rquote s escaped from! What use is that? Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!\rquote 
\par Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hotline num\-

\par Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon\rquote s sister. Even though she was not a blood relative of Harry\rquote s (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia\rquote s sister), he had been forced to call her \lquote Aunt\rquote 
 all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the country, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs. She didn\rquote t often stay in Privet Drive, because she couldn\rquote 
t bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in Harry\rquote s mind.
\par At Dudley\rquote s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had whacked Harry around the shins with her walking stic
k to stop him beating Dudley at musical statues. A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with a computerised robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the year before Harry had started at Hogwarts, Harry had accide
ntally trodden on the paw of her favourite dog. Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off until past midnight. The memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to Dudley\rquote s eyes.

\par \lquote Marge\rquote ll be here for a week,\rquote  Uncle Vernon snarled, \lquote and while we\rquote re on the subject,\rquote  he pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry, \lquote we need to get a few things straight before I go and collect her.

\par Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television.
\par Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle Vernon was Dudley\rquote s favourite form of entertainment.

\par \lquote I need you to sign the permission form,\rquote  said Harry in a rush.
\par \lquote And why should I do that?\rquote  sneered Uncle Vernon.

\par Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  he snapped finally. \lquote I shall monitor your behaviour care\-fully during Marge\rquote s visit. If, at the end of it, you\rquote ve toed the line and kept to the story, I\rquote ll sign your ruddy form.\rquote 
\par He wheeled around, pulled open the front door and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.
\par Harry didn\rquote t return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to his bedroom. If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he\rquote 
d better start now. Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework. Then he went to Hedwig\rquote 
s cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then poked them both awake.
\par \lquote Hedwig,\rquote  he said gloomily, \lquote you\rquote re going to have to clear off for a week. Go with Errol, Ron\rquote ll look after you. I\rquote ll write him a note, explaining. And don\rquote t look at me like that\rquote  \endash  Hedwig
\rquote s large amber eyes were reproachful, \lquote it\rquote s not my fault. It\rquote s the only way I\rquote ll be allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione.\rquote 
\par Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron bound to her leg) soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry, now feeling thoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe.
\par But Harry didn\rquote t have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt Petunia was shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guest.
\par \lquote Do something about your hair!\rquote  Aunt Petunia snapped as he reached the hall.
\par Harry couldn\rquote t see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat. Aunt Marge loved criticising him, so the untidier he looked, the happier she would be.
\par All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon\rquote s car pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors, and footsteps on the garden path.
\par \lquote Get the door!\rquote  Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.
\par A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door open.
\par On the threshold st
ood Aunt Marge. She was very like Uncle Vernon; large, beefy and purple-faced, she even had a moustache, though not as bushy as his. In one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked under the other was an old and evil-tempered bulldog.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s my Dudders?\rquote  roared Aunt Marge. \lquote Where\rquote s my neffy poo?\rquote 
\par Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head, a bow-tie just visible under his many chins. Aunt Marge thrust the suitcase into Harry\rquote s stomach, knocking the wind out of 
him, seized Dudley in a tight one-armed hug and planted a large kiss on his cheek.
\par Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt Marge\rquote s hugs because he was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart, Dudley had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist.
\par \lquote Petunia!\rquote  shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though he was a hat-stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia kissed, or rather, Aunt Marge bumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunia\rquote s bony cheekbone.
\par Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door.
\par \lquote Tea, Marge?\rquote  he said. \lquote And what will Ripper take?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,\rquote  said Aunt Marge, as they all trooped into the kitchen, leaving Harry alone in the hall with the suitcase. But Harry wasn\rquote 
t complaining; any excuse not to be with Aunt Marge was fine by him, so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom, taking as long as he could.
\par By the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner. Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked her clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.

\par \lquote Who\rquote s looking after the other dogs, Marge?\rquote  Uncle Vernon asked.
\par \lquote Oh, I\rquote ve got Colonel Fubster managing them,\rquote  boomed Aunt Marge. \lquote He\rquote s retired now, good for him to have something to do. But I couldn\rquote t leave poor old Ripper. He pines if he\rquote s away from me.\rquote 
\par Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This directed Aunt Marge\rquote s attention to Harry for the first time.
\par \lquote So!\rquote  she barked. \lquote Still here, are you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you say \'93yes\'94 in that ungrateful tone,\rquote  Aunt Marge growled. \lquote It\rquote s damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you. Wouldn\rquote t have done it myself. You\rquote d have gone straight to an orphanage if you

\par Harry was bursting to say that he\rquote d rather live in an orphanage than with the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form stopped him. He forced his face into a painful smile.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you smirk at me!\rquote  boomed Aunt Marge. \lquote I can see you haven\rquote t improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock some manners into you.\rquote  She took a large gulp of tea, wiped her moustache and said,

As Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encourage
d Harry to stay out of their way, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt Marge, on the other hand, wanted Harry under her eye at all times, so that she could boom out suggestions for his improve\-
ment. She delighted in comparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry, as though daring him to ask why he hadn\rquote

 sure that, criminal or not, Ron and Hermione would want to help him now, but they were both abroad, and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting them.
\par He didn\rquote t have any Muggle money, either. There was a little wizard gold in the moneybag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London. He\rquote 
d never be able to drag his trunk all the way to London. Unless ...
\par He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. If he was already expelled (his heart was now thumping painfully fast), a bit more magic couldn\rquote t hurt. He had the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father \endash 
 what if he bewitched the trunk to make it feather-light, tied it to h
is broomstick, covered himself in the Cloak and flew to London? Then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and ... begin his life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect, but he couldn\rquote t sit on this wall for ever or he\rquote 
d find himself trying to explain to Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick.
\par Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak \endash  but before he had found it, he straightened up suddenly, looking around him once more.
\par A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses.
\par He bent over his trunk again, but 
almost immediately stood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it: someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only it wou
ld move, then he\rquote d know whether it was just a stray cat or \endash  something else.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Lumos,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkle
d; the garage door gleamed, and between them, Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.
\par Harry stepped backwards. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in the gutter.
\par There was a deafening BANG and Harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light ...
\par With a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A second later, a gigant
ic pair of wheels and headlights had screeched to a halt exactly where Harry had just been lying. They belonged, as Harry saw when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over the wi
ndscreen spelled }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 The Knight Bus.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
\par For a split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night.
\par \lquote Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your wand hand, step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this eve}{

\par The conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of Harry, 
who was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet. Close to, he saw that Stan Shunpike was only a few years older than he was; eighteen or nine\-
teen at most, with large, protruding ears and a fair few pimples.
\par \lquote What were you doin\rquote  down there?\rquote  said Stan, dropping his pro\-fessional manner.
\par \lquote Fell over,\rquote  said Harry.

\par \lquote I didn\rquote t do it on purpose,\rquote  said Harry, annoyed. One of the knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he had t
hrown out to break his fall was bleeding. He suddenly remembered why he had fallen over, and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence. The Knight Bus\rquote s headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was empty.

\par \lquote There was a big black thing,\rquote  said Harry, pointing uncertainly into the gap. \lquote Like a dog ... but massive ...\rquote 
\par He looked around at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. With a feeling of unease, Harry saw Stan\rquote s eyes move to the scar on Harry\rquote s forehead.
\par \lquote Woss that on your \rquote ead?\rquote  said Stan abruptly.
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar. If the Ministry of Magic was looking for him, he didn\rquote t want to make it too easy for them.
\par \lquote Woss your name?\rquote  Stan persisted.

\par \lquote Eleven Sickles,\rquote  said Stan, \lquote but for firteen you get \rquote ot chocolate, and for fifteen you get an \rquote ot-water bottle an\rquote  a toofbrush in the colour of your choice.\rquote 
\par Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money bag and shoved some silver into Stan\rquote s hand. He and Stan then lifted his trunk, with Hedwig\rquote s cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus.
\par There were no seats; instead, half-a-dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed, illuminating the wood-panelled walls. A tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, \lquote 
Not now, thanks, I\rquote m pickling some slugs,\rquote  and rolled over in his sleep.
\par \lquote You \rquote ave this one,\rquote  Stan whispered, shoving Harry\rquote s trunk under the bed right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel. \lquote 
This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This is Neville Longbottom, Ern.\rquote 
\par Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to Harry, who nervously flattened his fringe again and sat down on his bed.
\par \lquote Take \rquote er away, Ern,\rquote  said Stan, sitting down in the armchair next to Ernie\rquote s.
\par There was another tremendous BANG, and next moment Harry found himself flat on his bed, thrown backwards by the speed of the Knight Bus. Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and saw that t
hey were now bowling along a completely different street. Stan was watching Harry\rquote s stunned face with great enjoyment.
\par \lquote This is where we was before you flagged us down,\rquote  he said. \lquote Where are we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ar,\rquote  said Ernie.
\par \lquote How come the Muggles don\rquote t hear the bus?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Them!\rquote  said Stan contemptuously. \lquote Don\rquote  listen properly, do they? Don\rquote  look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don\rquote .\rquote 
\par \lquote Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,\rquote  said Ern. \lquote We\rquote ll be in Abergavenny in a minute.\rquote 
\par Stan passed Harry\rquote s bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase. Harry was still looking out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous. Ernie didn\rquote 
t seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. The Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but it didn\rquote t hit anything; lines of lamp posts, letter-boxes and bins jumped out of its way as it approached and back into posi\-
tion once it had passed.
\par Stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a travelling cloak.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote  \rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Ere you go, Madam Marsh,\rquote 
 said Stan happily, as Ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so towards the front of the bus. Madam Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tot\-tered down the steps. Stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut; the
re was another loud BANG, and they were thun\-dering down a narrow country lane, trees leaping out of the way.
\par Harry wouldn\rquote t have been able to sleep even if he had been travelling on a bus that didn\rquote t keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a ti
me. His stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the ceiling yet.
\par Stan had unfurled a copy of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth. A large photograph of a sunken-faced man with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front page. He looked strangely familiar.
\par \lquote That man!\rquote  Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment. \lquote He was on the Muggle news!\rquote 
\par Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled.
\par \lquote Sirius Black,\rquote  he said, nodding. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote  \rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Course \rquote

\par He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry\rquote s face, removed the front page and handed it to Harry.

s face when he had been told where he was going, and Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew.
\par The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and bollards, telephone boxes and trees, and Harry lay, restless and miserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan remembered that Harry had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it a
ll over Harry\rquote s pillow when the bus moved abruptly from Anglesey to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards and witches in dressing-gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go.

\par They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus\rquote

\par Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. At the same time, Stan shouted, \lquote Blimey! Ern, come \rquote ere! Come }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \rquote ere!\rquote }{

\par Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them.
\par \lquote What didja call Neville, Minister?\rquote  he said excitedly.
\par Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and exhausted.
\par \lquote Neville?\rquote  he repeated, frowning. \lquote This is Harry Potter.\rquote 
\par \lquote I knew it!\rquote  Stan shouted gleefully. \lquote Ern! Ern! Guess \rquote oo Neville is, Ern! \rquote E\rquote s \rquote Arry Potter! I can see \rquote is scar!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Fudge testily. \lquote Well, I\rquote m very glad the Knight Bus picked Harry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now ...\rquote 
\par Fudge increased the pressure on Harry\rquote s shoulder, and Harry found himself being steered inside the pub. A stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar. It was Tom, the wizened, toothless landlord.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve got him, Minister!\rquote  said Tom. \lquote Will you be wanting any\-thing? Beer? Brandy?\rquote 
\par \lquote Perhaps a pot of tea,\rquote  said Fudge, who still hadn\rquote t let go of Harry.
\par There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stan and Ern appeared, carrying Harry\rquote s trunk and Hedwig\rquote s cage and looking around excitedly.

\par Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom\rquote s lantern, and then into a small parlour. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room.
\par \lquote Sit down, Harry\rquote  said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.
\par Harry sat down, feeling goosebumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire. Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down opposite Harry.
\par \lquote I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister for Magic.\rquote 
\par Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once before, but as he had been wearing his father\rquote s Invisibility Cloak at the time, Fudge wasn\rquote t to know that.
\par Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He placed the tray on a table between Fudge and Harry, and left the parlour, closing the door behind him.
\par \lquote Well, Harry,\rquote  said Fudge, pouring out tea, \lquote you\rquote ve had us all in a right flap, I don\rquote t mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and uncle\rquote s house like that! I\rquote d started to think ... but you\rquote 
re safe, and that\rquote s what matters.\rquote 
\par Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate towards Harry.
\par \lquote Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then ... You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blow\-ing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members
 of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no recollection of the incident at all. So that\rquote s that, and no harm done.\rquote 

\par Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle surveying a favourite nephew. Harry, who couldn\rquote t believe his ears, opened his mouth to speak, couldn\rquote t think of anything to say, and closed it again.
\par \lquote Ah, you\rquote re worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?\rquote  said Fudge. \lquote Well, I won\rquote 
t deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.\rquote

\par It didn\rquote t occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now.
\par \lquote So all that remains,\rquote  said Fudge, now buttering himself a second crumpet, \lquote is to decide where you\rquote re going to spend the last three weeks of your holidays. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote Hang on,\rquote  blurted Harry, \lquote what about my punishment?\rquote 
\par Fudge blinked.
\par \lquote Punishment?\rquote 
\par \lquote I broke the law!\rquote  Harry said. \lquote The Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, my dear boy, we\rquote re not going to punish you for a little thing like that!\rquote  cried Fudge, waving his crumpet impatiently. \lquote It was an accident! We don\rquote t send people to Azkaban just for blow\-ing up their aunts!\rquote 

\par But this didn\rquote t tally at all with Harry\rquote s past dealings with the Ministry of Magic.
\par \lquote Last year, I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a pudding in my uncle\rquote s house!\rquote  said Harry, frowning. \lquote The Ministry of Magic said I\rquote d be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic there!
\rquote 
\par Unless Harry\rquote s eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was suddenly looking awkward.
\par \lquote Circumstances change, Harry ... we have to take into account ... in the present climate ... surely you don\rquote t }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 want }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 to be expelled?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course I don\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well then, what\rquote s all the fuss about?\rquote  laughed Fudge airily. \lquote Now, have a crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom\rquote s got a room for you.\rquote 
\par Fudge strode out of the parlour and Harry stared after him. There was something extremely odd going on. Why had Fudge been waiting for him at the Leaky Cauldron, if not to punish him for what he\rquote 
d done? And now Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn\rquote t usual for the Minister for Magic }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 himself }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 to get involved in matters of underage magic?
\par Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the innkeeper.
\par \lquote Room eleven\rquote s free, Harry,\rquote  said Fudge. \lquote I think you\rquote ll be very comfortable. Just one thing, and I\rquote m sure you\rquote ll understand: I don\rquote 
t want you wandering off into Muggle London, all right? Keep to Diagon Alley. And you\rquote re to be back here before dark each night. Sure you\rquote ll understand. Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me.\rquote 
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Harry slowly, \lquote but why \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t want to lose you again, do we?\rquote  said Fudge with a hearty laugh. \lquote No, no ... best we know where you are ... I mean ...\rquote 
\par Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak.
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote ll be off, plenty to do, you know.\rquote 
\par \lquote Have you had any luck with Black yet?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par Fudge\rquote s fingers slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak.
\par \lquote What\rquote s that? Oh, you\rquote ve heard \endash  well, no, not yet, but it\rquote s only a matter of time. The Azkaban guards have never yet failed ... and they are angrier than I\rquote ve ever seen them.\rquote 
\par Fudge shuddered slightly.
\par \lquote So, I\rquote ll say goodbye.\rquote 
\par He held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea.
\par \lquote Er \endash  Minister? Can I ask you something?\rquote 
\par \lquote Certainly,\rquote  smiled Fudge.
\par \lquote Well, third-years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, but my aunt and uncle didn\rquote t sign the permission form. D\rquote you think you could?\rquote 
\par Fudge was looking uncomfortable.
\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  he said. \lquote No. No, I\rquote m very sorry, Harry, but as I\rquote m not your parent or guardian \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But you\rquote re the Minister for Magic,\rquote  said Harry eagerly. \lquote If you gave me permission \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, I\rquote m sorry, Harry, but rules are rules,\rquote  said Fudge flatly. \lquote Perhaps you\rquote ll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I think it best if you don\rquote t ... yes ... well, I\rquote 
ll be off. Enjoy your stay, Harry.\rquote 
\par And with a last smile and shake of Harry\rquote s hand, Fudge left the room. Tom now moved forward, beaming at Harry.
\par \lquote If you\rquote ll follow me, Mr Potter,\rquote  he said. \lquote I\rquote ve already taken your things up ...\rquote 
\par Harry followed Tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass number eleven on it, which Tom unlocked and opened for him.
\par Inside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some highly pol\-ished oak furniture, a cheerfully crackling fire and, perched on top of the wardrobe \endash 
\par \lquote Hedwig!\rquote  Harry gasped.
\par The snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto Harry\rquote s arm.
\par \lquote Very smart owl you\rquote ve got there,\rquote  chuckled Tom. \lquote Arrived about five minutes after you did. If there\rquote s anything you need, Mr Potter, don\rquote t hesitate to ask.\rquote 
\par He gave another bow and left.
\par Harry sat on his bed for a long time, absent-mindedly stroking Hedwig. The sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep, velvety blue to cold, steely grey and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold. Harry could hardly believe that he\rquote 
d only left Privet Drive a few hours ago, that he wasn\rquote t expelled, and that he was now facing three completely Dursley-free weeks.
\par \lquote It\rquote s been a very weird night, Hedwig,\rquote  he yawned.
\par And without even removing his glasses, he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep.

 Never before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied. He could even go wherever he liked, as long as it was in Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the worl

Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for a day\rquote s shopping; venerable-looking wizards argu\-ing over the latest article in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37

wild-looking warlocks, raucous dwarfs and, once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava.
\par After breakfast Harry would go out into the back yard, take out his wand, tap the third brick from the left above the dustbin, and stand back as the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.
\par Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eat\-ing under the brightly coloured umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners were showing each other their purchases (\lquote it\rquote s a lunascope, old boy \endash 
 no more messing around with moon charts, see?\rquote ) or else discussing the case of Sirius Black (\lquote personally, I won\rquote t let any of the children out alone until he\rquote s back in Azkaban\rquote ). Harry didn\rquote 
t have to do his homework under the blan\-kets by torchlight any more; now he could sit in the bright sun\-shine outside Florean Fortescue\rquote s Ice-Cream Parlour, finishing all hi
s essays with occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch-burnings, gave Harry free sundaes every half hour.
\par Once Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, silver Sickles and bronze K
nuts from his vault at Gringotts, he needed to exercise a lot of self-control not to spend the whole lot at once. He had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hogwarts, and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks
, to stop himself buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a wizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirted a nasty-smelling liquid into the other player\rquote 
s face when they lost a point). He was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant he never had to take another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested Harry\rquote 
s resolution most appeared in his favourite shop, Quality Quidditch Supplies, a week after he\rquote d arrived at the Leaky Cauldron.
\par Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, Harry edged his way inside and squeezed in amongst the excited witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium on which was mounted the most magnificent broom he ha
d ever seen in his life.
\par \lquote Just come out ... prototype ...\rquote  a square-jawed wizard was telling his companion.
\par \lquote It\rquote s the fastest broom in the world, isn\rquote t it, Dad?\rquote  squeaked a boy younger than Harry, who was swinging off his father\rquote s arm.

There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went to the apothecary to replenish his store of Potions\rquote  ingredients, and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he visited Madam Malkin\rquote 
s Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones. Most important of all, he had to buy his new school books, which would include those for his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures and Divination.
\par Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window. Instead of the usual display of gold-embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs, there was a large iron cage behind the glass which held about a hundred copies of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 The Monster Book of Monsters. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
Torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively.
\par Harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 The Monster Book of Monsters }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
was listed as the set book for Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid had said it would come in useful. He felt relieved; he had been wondering whether Hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet.
\par As Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurry\-ing towards him.

As the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever he went for a sign of Ron or Hermione. Plenty of Hog
warts students were arriving in Diagon Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where they, too, were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the real Nevill
e Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy, outside Flourish and Blotts. Harry didn\rquote

Harry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that he would at least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He got up, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was just wondering where he\rquote

\par \lquote Harry! HARRY!\rquote 
\par They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue\rquote s Ice-Cream Parlour, Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him.
\par \lquote Finally!\rquote  said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. \lquote We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you\rquote d left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin\rquote s, and \endash \rquote

\par \lquote Excellent!\rquote  said Harry happily. \lquote So, have you got all your new books and stuff?\rquote 
\par \lquote Look at this,\rquote  said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it. \lquote Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing one unicorn tail-hair. And we\rquote ve got all our books\rquote  \endash

\par \lquote What\rquote s all that, Hermione?\rquote  Harry asked, pointing at not one, but three, bulging bags in the chair next to her.
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote m taking more new subjects than you, aren\rquote t I?\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What are you doing Muggle Studies for?\rquote  said Ron, rolling his eyes at Harry. \lquote You\rquote re Muggle-born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You already know all about Muggles!\rquote 
\par \lquote But it\rquote ll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view,\rquote  said Hermione earnestly.
\par \lquote Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?\rquote  asked Harry, while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve still got ten Galleons,\rquote  she said, checking her purse. \lquote It\rquote s my birthday in September, and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present.\rquote 
\par \lquote How about a nice }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 book?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 said Ron innocently.
\par \lquote No, I don\rquote t think so,\rquote  said Hermione composedly. \lquote I really want an owl. I mean, Harry\rquote s got Hedwig and you\rquote ve got Errol \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I haven\rquote t,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Errol\rquote s a family owl. All I\rquote ve got is Scabbers.\rquote  He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket. \lquote And I want to get him checked over,\rquote 
 he added, placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. \lquote I don\rquote t think Egypt agreed with him.\rquote 
\par Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a defi\-nite droop to his whiskers.
\par \lquote There\rquote s a magical-creature shop just over there,\rquote  said Harry, who knew Diagon Alley very well by now. \lquote You can see if they\rquote ve got anything for Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl.\rquote 
\par So they paid for their ice-creams and crossed the street to the Magical Menagerie.
\par There wasn\rquote t much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages. It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages we
re all squeaking, squawking, jabbering or hissing. The witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so Harry, Ron and Hermione waited, examining the cages.
\par A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead blowflies. A gigantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell was glittering near the window. Poisonous orange snails were ooz\-
ing slowly up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and back again
 with a loud popping noise. Then there were cats of every colour, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funny custard-coloured furballs that were humming loudly, and, on the counter, a vast cage of sleek black rats which were playing some sort of skipping g
ame using their long bald tails.
\par The double-ended-newt wizard left and Ron approached the counter.
\par \lquote It\rquote s my rat,\rquote  he told the witch. \lquote He\rquote s been a bit off-colour ever since I brought him back from Egypt.\rquote 
\par \lquote Bang him on the counter,\rquote  said the witch, pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocket.
\par Ron lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better look.
\par Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was second-hand (he had once belonged to Ron\rquote s brother Percy) and a bit battered. Next to the glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone.
\par \lquote Hm,\rquote  said the witch, picking Scabbers up. \lquote How old is this rat?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dunno,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Quite old. He used to belong to my brother.\rquote 
\par \lquote What powers does he have?\rquote  said the witch, examining Scabbers closely.
\par \lquote Er \endash \rquote  said Ron. The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers. The witch\rquote s eyes moved from Scabbers\rquote 
s tattered left ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly.
\par \lquote He\rquote s been through the mill, this one,\rquote  she said.
\par \lquote He was like that when Percy gave him to me,\rquote  said Ron defensively.
\par \lquote An ordinary, common or garden rat like this can\rquote t be expected to live longer than three years or so,\rquote  said the witch. \lquote Now, if you were looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of these ...\rquote 

\par She indicated the black rats, who promptly started skipping again. Ron muttered, \lquote Show-offs.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, if you don\rquote t want a replacement, you can try this Rat Tonic,\rquote  said the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle.
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote How much \endash  OUCH!\rquote 
\par Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage, landed on his head and then propelled itself, spitting madly, at Scabbers.
\par \lquote NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!\rquote  cried the witch, but Scabbers shot from between her hands like a bar of soap, landed splay-legged on the floor and then scarpered for the door.
\par \lquote Scabbers!\rquote  Ron shouted, haring out of the shop after him; Harry followed.
\par It took them nearly ten minutes to find Scabbers, who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside Quality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up, massaging his head.
\par \lquote What }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 that?\rquote 
\par \lquote It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote Probably getting her owl.\rquote 
\par They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie. As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn\rquote t carrying an owl. Her arms were clamped tightly around the enor\-mous ginger cat.

 said Hermione, glowing.
\par That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat\rquote 
s ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bow-legged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the c
at was purring contentedly in Hermione\rquote s arms.
\par \lquote Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote He didn\rquote t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?\rquote  said Hermione.

\par \lquote Good job, too,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley briskly. \lquote Do you realise how much luggage you\rquote ve all got between you? A nice sight you\rquote d be on the Muggle Underground ... You are all packed, aren\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron hasn\rquote t put all his new things in his trunk yet,\rquote  said Percy, in a long-suffering voice. \lquote He\rquote s dumped them on my bed.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote d better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won\rquote t have much time in the morning,\rquote  Mrs Weasley called down the table. Ron scowled at Percy.
\par After dinner everyone felt v
ery full and sleepy. One by one they made their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day. Ron and Percy were next door to Harry. He had just closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, and went to
 see what was going on.
\par The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting.
\par \lquote It was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 here, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing

\par \lquote I haven\rquote t touched it, all right?\rquote  Ron roared back.
\par \lquote What\rquote s up?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote My Head Boy badge has gone,\rquote  said Percy, rounding on Harry.
\par \lquote So\rquote s Scabbers\rquote s Rat Tonic,\rquote  said Ron, throwing things out of his trunk to look. \lquote I think I might\rquote ve left it in the bar \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re not going anywhere till you\rquote ve found my badge!\rquote  yelled Percy.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll get Scabbers\rquote s stuff, I\rquote m packed,\rquote  Harry said to Ron, and he went downstairs.
\par Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark, when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlour. A second later, he recognised them as Mr and Mrs Weasley\rquote s. He hesitated, not wanting them to know he
\rquote d heard them rowing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move closer to the parlour door.
\par \lquote ... makes no sense not to tell him,\rquote  Mr Weasley was saying heat\-edly. \lquote Harry\rquote s got a right to know. I\rquote ve tried to tell Fudge, but he insists on treating Harry like a child. He\rquote s thirteen years old and \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote Arthur, the truth would terrify him!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley shrilly. \lquote Do you really want to send Harry back to school with that hang\-ing over him? For heaven\rquote s sake, he\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote I don\rquote t want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his guard!\rquote  retorted Mr Weasley. \lquote You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering off by themselves \endash  they\rquote

\par \lquote But no one\rquote s really sure that Black\rquote s after Harry \endash \rquote 
\par There was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr Weasley had banged his fist on the table.
\par \lquote Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn\rquote t report it in the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went out to Azkaban the night Black escaped. The guards told Fudge that Black\rquote 
s been talking in his sleep for a while now. Always the same words: \'93He\rquote s at Hogwarts ... he\rquote s at Hogwarts.\'94 Black is d
eranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead. If you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring You-Know-Who back to power. Black lost everything the night Harry stopped You-Know-Who, and he\rquote s had twelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that ...
\rquote 
\par There was a silence. Harry leant still closer to the door, desper\-ate to hear more.
\par \lquote Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you\rquote re forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don\rquote t think anything could hurt Harry at Hogwarts while Dumbledore\rquote s Headmaster. I suppose he knows about all this?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds. He wasn\rquote t happy about it, but he agreed.\rquote 
\par \lquote Not happy? Why shouldn\rquote t he be happy, if they\rquote re there to catch Black?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore isn\rquote t fond of the Azkaban guards,\rquote  said Mr Weasley heavily. \lquote Nor am I, if it comes to that ... but when you\rquote re dealing with a wizard like Black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you\rquote 
d rather avoid.\rquote 
\par \lquote If they save Harry \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  then I will never say another word against them,\rquote  said Mr Weasley wearily. \lquote It\rquote s late, Molly, we\rquote d better go up ...\rquote 
\par Harry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight. The parlour door opened, and a few seconds later footsteps told him that Mr and Mrs Weasley were climbing the stairs.
\par The bottle of Rat Tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr and Mrs Weasley\rquote s bed\-room door close, then headed back upstairs with the bottle.
\par Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the land\-ing, heaving with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron\rquote s room in the search for his badge.
\par \lquote We\rquote ve got it,\rquote  Fred whispered to Harry. \lquote We\rquote ve been improving it.\rquote 
\par The badge now read }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Bighead Boy.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
\par Harry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic, then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bed.
\par So Sirius Black was after him. That explained everything. Fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive. He\rquote 
d made Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley, where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him. And he was sending two Ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harry until he was on the train.

\par Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and won\-dered why he didn\rquote t feel more scared. Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mr and Mrs Weasley obviously thought Harry would be panic-s
tricken if he knew the truth. But Harry happened to agree whole-heartedly with Mrs Weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus Dumbledore hap\-pened to be. Didn\rquote 
t people always say that Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of? Surely Black, as Voldemort\rquote s right-hand man, would be just as frightened of him?
\par And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talk\-ing about. They seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were stationed all around the school, Black\rquote s chances of getting inside seemed very remote.
\par No, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero. Nobody would want Harry to leave the safety of the castle until Black was
 caught; in fact, Harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed.
\par He scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he couldn\rquote t look after himself? He\rquote d escaped Lord Voldemort three times, he wasn\rquote t completely useless ...
\par Unbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent crossed his mind. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 What to do when you know the worst is coming ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

 over his head and looking irritable.

\par \lquote I\rquote ve got something to tell you,\rquote  Harry began, but they were interrupted by Fred and George, who had looked in to congratu\-late Ron on infuriating Percy again.
\par They headed down to breakfast, where Mr Weasley was reading the front page of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 with a furrowed brow and Mrs Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a Love Potion she\rquote d made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly.
\par \lquote What were you saying?\rquote  Ron asked Harry, as they sat down.
\par \lquote Later,\rquote  Harry muttered, as Percy stormed in.
\par Harry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in the chaos of leaving; they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron\rquote s narrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with Hedwig and Hermes, Percy\rquote 
s screech owl, perched on top in their cages. A small wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly.
\par \lquote It\rquote s all right, Crookshanks,\rquote  Hermione cooed through the wick\-erwork, \lquote I\rquote ll let you out on the train.\rquote 
\par \lquote You won\rquote t,\rquote  snapped Ron. \lquote What about poor Scabbers, eh?\rquote 
\par He pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated that Scabbers was curled up in his pocket.
\par Mr Weasley, who had been outside waiting for the Ministry cars, stuck his head inside.
\par \lquote They\rquote re here,\rquote  he said. \lquote Harry, come on.\rquote 
\par Mr Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch of pave\-ment towards the first of two old-fashioned dark green cars, each of which was driven by a furtive-looking wizard, wearing a suit of emerald velvet.
\par \lquote In you get, Harry,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, glancing up and down the crowded street.
\par Harry got into the back of the car, and was shortly joined by Hermione, Ron and, to Ron\rquote s disgust, Percy.
\par The journey to King\rquote s Cross was very uneventful compared to Harry\rquote s trip on the Knight Bus. The Ministry of Magic cars seemed almost ordinary, though Harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that Uncle Vernon\rquote 
s new company car certainly couldn\rquote t have managed. They reached King\rquote s Cross with twenty minutes to spare
; the Ministry drivers found them trolleys, unloaded their trunks, touched their hats to Mr Weasley and drove away, somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving queue for the traffic lights.
\par Mr Weasley kept close to Harry\rquote s elbow all the way into the station.
\par \lquote Right then,\rquote  he said, glancing around them. \lquote Let\rquote s do this in pairs, as there are so many of us. I\rquote ll go through first with Harry.\rquote 
\par Mr Weasley strolled towards the barrier between platforms nine and ten, pushing Harry\rquote s trolley and apparently v
ery interested in the InterCity 125 that had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful look at Harry, he leant casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him.
\par Next moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and thr
ee-quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train.
\par Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were panting, and had apparently taken the barrier at a run.
\par \lquote Ah, there\rquote s Penelope!\rquote  said Percy, smoothing his hair and going pink again. Ginny caught Harry\rquote s eye and they both turned away to hide their laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking with h
is chest thrown out so that she couldn\rquote t miss his shiny badge.
\par Once the remaining Weasleys and Hermione had joined them, Harry and Ron led the way to the end of the train, past packed compartments, to a carriage that looked quite empty. They loaded the tru
nks onto it, stowed Hedwig and Crookshanks in the luggage rack, then went back outside to say goodbye to Mr and Mrs Weasley.
\par Mrs Weasley kissed all her children, then Hermione, and finally, Harry. He was embarrassed, but really quite pleased, when she gave him an extra hug.
\par \lquote Do take care, won\rquote t you, Harry?\rquote  she said as she straightened up, her eyes oddly bright. Then she opened her enormous hand\-bag and said, \lquote I\rquote ve made you all sandwiches. Here you are, Ron ... no, they\rquote 
re not corned beef ... Fred? Where\rquote s Fred? Here you are, dear ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  said Mr Weasley quietly, \lquote come over here a moment.\rquote 
\par He jerked his head towards a pillar, and Harry followed him behind it, leaving the others crowded around Mrs Weasley.
\par \lquote There\rquote s something I\rquote ve got to tell you before you leave \endash \rquote  said Mr Weasley, in a tense voice.
\par \lquote It\rquote s all right, Mr Weasley,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote I already know.\rquote 
\par \lquote You know? How could you know?\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  er \endash  I heard you and Mrs Weasley talking last night. I couldn\rquote t help hearing,\rquote  Harry added quickly. \lquote Sorry \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s not the way I\rquote d have chosen for you to find out,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, looking anxious.
\par \lquote No \endash  honestly, it\rquote s OK. This way, you haven\rquote t broken your word to Fudge and I know what\rquote s going on.\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, you must be very scared \endash \rquote

\par Mr Weasley flinched at the sound of the name, but overlooked it.

\par \lquote He\rquote s coming, Molly!\rquote  said Mr Weasley, but he turned back to Harry and kept talking in a lower and more hurried voice. \lquote Listen, I want you to give me your word \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  that I\rquote ll be a good boy and stay in the castle?\rquote  said Harry gloomily.
\par \lquote Not entirely,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, who looked more serious than Harry had ever seen him. \lquote Harry, swear to me you won\rquote t go }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 looking }{

\par Harry stared. \lquote What?\rquote 
\par There was a loud whistle. Guards were walking along the train, slamming all the doors shut.
\par \lquote Promise me, Harry,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, talking more quickly still, \lquote that whatever happens \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to kill me?\rquote  said Harry blankly.
\par \lquote Swear to me that whatever you might hear \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Arthur, quickly!\rquote  cried Mrs Weasley.
\par Steam was billowing from the train; it had started to move. Harry ran to the compartment door and Ron threw it open and stood back to let him on. They leant out of the window and waved at Mr and Mrs Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them
 from view.
\par \lquote I need to talk to you in private,\rquote  Harry muttered to Ron and Hermione as the train picked up speed.
\par \lquote Go away, Ginny,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Oh, that\rquote s nice,\rquote  said Ginny huffily, and she stalked off.
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione set off down the corridor, looking for an empty compartment, but all were full except for the one at the very end of the train.
\par This only had one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the window. Harry, Ron and Hermione checked on the threshold. The Hogwarts Express was usually res
erved for students and they had never seen an adult there before, except for the witch who pushed the food trolley.
\par The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard\rquote s robes which had been darned in several places. He looked ill and exhausted. Though he seemed quite young, his light-brown hair was flecked with grey.
\par \lquote Who d\rquote you reckon he is?\rquote  Ron hissed, as they sat down and slid the door shut, taking the seats furthest away from the window.
\par \lquote Professor R. J. Lupin,\rquote  whispered Hermione at once.
\par \lquote How d\rquote you know that?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s on his case,\rquote  replied Hermione, pointing at the luggage rack over the man\rquote s head, where there was a small, battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string. The name \lquote Professor R. J. Lupin
\rquote  was stamped across one corner in peeling letters.
\par \lquote Wonder what he teaches?\rquote  said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin\rquote s pallid profile.
\par \lquote That\rquote s obvious,\rquote  whispered Hermione. \lquote There\rquote s only one vacancy, isn\rquote t there? Defence Against the Dark Arts.\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione had already had two Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers, both of whom had only lasted one year. There were rumours that the job was jinxed.
\par \lquote Well, I hope he\rquote s up to it,\rquote  said Ron doubtfully. \lquote He looks like one good hex would finish him off, doesn\rquote t he? Anyway ...\rquote  he turned to Harry, \lquote what were you going to tell us?\rquote 
\par Harry explained all about Mr and Mrs Weasley\rquote s argument and the warning Mr Weasley had just given him. When he\rquote d finished, Ron looked thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her mouth. She finally lowered them to say, \lquote

\par \lquote How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him?\rquote  said Ron shakily.
\par They were taking the news worse than Harry had expected. Both Ron and Hermione seemed to be much more frightened of Black than he was.
\par \lquote No one knows how he got out of Azkaban,\rquote  said Ron uncom\-fortably. \lquote No one\rquote s ever done it before. And he was a top-security prisoner, too.\rquote 
\par \lquote But they\rquote ll catch him, won\rquote t they?\rquote  said Hermione earnestly. \lquote I mean, they\rquote ve got all the Muggles looking out for him, too ...\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s that noise?\rquote  said Ron suddenly.
\par A faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere. They looked all around the compartment.
\par \lquote It\rquote s coming from your trunk, Harry,\rquote  said Ron, standing up and reaching into the luggage rack. A moment later he had pulled the Pocket Sneakoscope out from between Harry\rquote s robes. It was spin\-ning very fast in the palm of Ron
\rquote s hand, and glowing brilliantly.
\par \lquote Is that a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Sneakoscope?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
said Hermione interestedly, standing up for a better look.
\par \lquote Yeah ... mind you, it\rquote s a very cheap one,\rquote  Ron said. \lquote It went hay-wire just as I was tying it to Errol\rquote s leg to send it to Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?\rquote  said Hermione shrewdly.
\par \lquote No! Well ... I wasn\rquote t supposed to be using Errol. You know he\rquote s not really up to long journeys ... but how else was I supposed to get Harry\rquote s present to him?\rquote 
\par \lquote Stick it back in the trunk,\rquote  Harry advised, as the Sneakoscope whistled piercingly, \lquote or it\rquote ll wake him up.\rquote 
\par He nodded towards Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the Sneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of Uncle Vernon\rquote s old socks, which deadened the sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it.
\par \lquote We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,\rquote  said Ron, sitting back down. \lquote They sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges, magical instruments and stuff, Fred and George told me.\rquote 
\par \lquote Do you know much about Hogsmeade?\rquote  asked Hermione keenly. \lquote I\rquote ve read it\rquote s the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in Britain \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I think it is,\rquote  said Ron in an offhand sort of way, \lquote but that\rquote s not why I want to go. I just want to get inside Honeydukes!\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s that?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote It\rquote s this sweetshop,\rquote  said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face, \lquote where they\rquote ve got }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 everything ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par She was fumbling with the straps of Crookshanks\rquote s basket as she spoke.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t let that thing out!\rquote  Ron said, but too late; Crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket, stretched, yawned, and sprang onto Ron\rquote s knees; the lump in Ron\rquote s pocket trembled and he shoved Crookshanks angrily away.

\par \lquote Get out of it!\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron, don\rquote t!\rquote  said Hermione angrily.
\par Ron was about to answer back when Professor Lupin stirred. They watched him apprehensively, but he simply turned his head the other way, mouth slightly open, and slept on.
\par The Hogwarts Express moved steadily north and the scenery outside the window became wilder and darker while the clouds overhead thickened. People were chasing backwards and forwards past the door of their compartment. Crookshank
s had now settled in an empty seat, his squashed face turned towards Ron, his yellow eyes on Ron\rquote s top pocket.
\par At one o\rquote clock the plump witch with the food trolley arrived at the compartment door.
\par \lquote D\rquote you think we should wake him up?\rquote  Ron asked awkwardly, nodding towards Professor Lupin. \lquote He looks like he could do with some food.\rquote 
\par Hermione approached Professor Lupin cautiously.
\par \lquote Er \endash  Professor?\rquote  she said. \lquote Excuse me \endash  Professor?\rquote 
\par He didn\rquote t move.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t worry, dear,\rquote  said the witch, as she handed Harry a large stack of Cauldron Cakes. \lquote If he\rquote s hungry when he wakes, I\rquote ll be up front with the driver.\rquote 
\par \lquote I suppose he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 asleep?\rquote 
 said Ron quietly, as the witch slid the compartment door closed. \lquote I mean \endash  he hasn\rquote t died, has he?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, no, he\rquote s breathing,\rquote  whispered Hermione, taking the Cauldron Cake Harry passed her.
\par He might not be very good company, but Professor Lupin\rquote s presence in their compartment had its uses. Mid-afternoon, just as it had started to rain, blurring the rolling hills outside the win\-dow, they hea
rd footsteps in the corridor again, and their three least favourite people appeared at the door: Draco Malfoy, flanked by his cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle.
\par Draco Malfoy and Harry had been enemies ever since they had met on their very first tra
in journey to Hogwarts. Malfoy, who had a pale, pointed, sneering face, was in Slytherin house; he played Seeker on the Slytherin Quidditch team, the same position that Harry played on the Gryffindor team. Crabbe and Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy
\rquote s bidding. They were both wide and muscly; Crabbe was the taller, with a pudding-basin haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly hair and long, gorilla arms.
\par \lquote Well, look who it is,\rquote  said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling open the compartment door. \lquote Potty and the Weasel.\rquote 
\par Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.
\par \lquote I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer, Weasley,\rquote  said Malfoy. \lquote Did your mother die of shock?\rquote 
\par Ron stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks\rquote s basket to the floor. Professor Lupin gave a snort.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s that?\rquote  said Malfoy, taking an automatic step backwards as he spotted Lupin.
\par \lquote New teacher,\rquote  said Harry, who had got to his feet, too, in case he needed to hold Ron back. \lquote What were you saying, Malfoy?\rquote 
\par Malfoy\rquote s pale eyes narrowed; he wasn\rquote t fool enough to pick a fight right under a teacher\rquote s nose.
\par \lquote C\rquote mon,\rquote  he muttered resentfully to Crabbe and Goyle, and they disappeared.
\par Harry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his knuckles.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not going to take any rubbish from Malfoy this year,\rquote  he said angrily. \lquote I mean it. If he makes one more crack about my fam\-ily, I\rquote m going to get hold of his head and \endash \rquote 
\par Ron made a violent gesture in mid-air.
\par \lquote Ron,\rquote  hissed Hermione, pointing at Professor Lupin, \lquote be }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 careful}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196  ...\rquote 
\par But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.
\par The rain thickened as the train sped yet further north; the win\-dows were now a solid, shimmering grey, which gradually dark\-ened unti
l lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks. The train rattled, the rain hammered, the wind roared, but still, Professor Lupin slept.
\par \lquote We must be nearly there,\rquote  said Ron, leaning forward to look past Professor Lupin at the now completely black window.
\par The words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down.
\par \lquote Brilliant,\rquote  said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin to try and see outside. \lquote I\rquote m starving, I want to get to the feast ...\rquote 
\par \lquote We can\rquote t be there yet,\rquote  said Hermione, checking her watch.
\par \lquote So why\rquote re we stopping?\rquote 
\par The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise of the pistons fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows.
\par Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corri\-dor. All along the carriage, heads were sticking curiously out of their compartments.
\par The train came to a stop with a jolt and distant thuds and bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of the racks. Then, without warning, all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness.
\par \lquote What\rquote s going on?\rquote  said Ron\rquote s voice from behind Harry.
\par \lquote Ouch!\rquote  gasped Hermione. \lquote Ron, that was my foot!\rquote 
\par Harry felt his way back to his seat.
\par \lquote D\rquote you think we\rquote ve broken down?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dunno ...\rquote 
\par There was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim black outline of Ron, wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out.
\par \lquote There\rquote s something moving out there,\rquote  Ron said. \lquote I think people are coming aboard ...\rquote 
\par The compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over Harry\rquote s legs.
\par \lquote Sorry! D\rquote you know what\rquote s going on? Ouch! Sorry \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hello, Neville,\rquote  said Harry, feeling around in the dark and pulling Neville up by his cloak.
\par \lquote Harry? Is that you? What\rquote s happening?\rquote 
\par \lquote No idea! Sit down \endash \rquote 
\par There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville had tried to sit on Crookshanks.
\par \lquote I\rquote m going to go and ask the driver what\rquote s going on,\rquote  came Hermione\rquote s voice. Harry felt her pass him, heard the door slide open again and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Who\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 that?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
\par \lquote Ginny?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote What are you doing?\rquote 
\par \lquote I was looking for Ron \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Come in and sit down \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Not here!\rquote  said Harry hurriedly. \lquote I\rquote m here!\rquote 
\par \lquote Ouch!\rquote  said Neville.
\par \lquote Quiet!\rquote  said a hoarse voice suddenly.
\par Professor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last. Harry could hear movements in his corner. None of them spoke.
\par There was a soft, crackling noise and a shivering light filled the compartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames. They illuminated his tired grey face, but his eyes looked alert and wary.
\par \lquote Stay where you are,\rquote  he said, in the same hoarse voice, and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him.
\par But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it.
\par Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin\rquote s hand, was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling. Its face was completely hidden beneath its hood. Harry\rquote 
s eyes darted downwards, and what he saw made his stomach contract. There was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening, grey\-ish, slimy-looking and scabbed, like something dead that had decayed in water ...
\par It was visible only for a split second. As though the creature beneath the cloak sensed Harry\rquote s gaze, the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of the black material.
\par And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as though it was trying to suck some\-thing more than air from its surroundings.
\par An intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his own breath catch in his chest. The cold went deeper than his skin. It was inside his chest, it was inside his very heart ...
\par Harry\rquote s eyes rolled up into his head. He couldn\rquote t see. He was drowning in cold. There was a rushing in his ears as though of water. He was being dragged downwards, the roaring growing louder ...
\par And then, from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrified, pleading screams. He wanted to help whoever it was, he tried to move his arms, but couldn\rquote t ... a thick white fog was swirling around him, inside him \endash 
\par \lquote Harry! Harry! Are you all right?\rquote 
\par Someone was slapping his face.
\par \lquote W-what?\rquote 
\par Harry opened his eyes. There were lanterns above him, and the floor was shaking \endash  the Hogwarts Express was movin
g again and the lights had come back on. He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor. Ron and Hermione were kneeling next to him, and above them he could see Neville and Professor Lupin watch\-
ing. Harry felt very sick; when he put up his hand to push his glasses back on, he felt cold sweat on his face.
\par Ron and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat.
\par \lquote Are you OK?\rquote  Ron asked nervously.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, looking quickly towards the door. The hood\-ed creature had vanished. \lquote What happened? Where\rquote s that \endash  that thing? Who screamed?\rquote 
\par \lquote No one screamed,\rquote  said Ron, more nervously still.
\par Harry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny and Neville looked back at him, both very pale.
\par \lquote But I heard screaming \endash \rquote 
\par A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces.
\par \lquote Here,\rquote  he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece. \lquote Eat it. It\rquote ll help.\rquote 
\par Harry took the chocolate but didn\rquote t eat it.
\par \lquote What was that thing?\rquote  he asked Lupin.
\par \lquote A Dementor,\rquote  said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else. \lquote One of the Dementors of Azkaban.\rquote 
\par Everyone stared at him. Professor Lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket.
\par \lquote Eat,\rquote  he repeated. \lquote It\rquote ll help. I need to speak to the driver, excuse me ...\rquote 
\par He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor.
\par \lquote Are you sure you\rquote re OK, Harry?\rquote  said Hermione, watching Harry anxiously.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t get it ... what happened?\rquote  said Harry, wiping more sweat off his face.
\par \lquote Well \endash  that thing \endash  the Dementor \endash  stood there and looked around (I mean, I think it did, I couldn\rquote t see its face) \endash  and you \endash  you \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I thought you were having a fit or something,\rquote  said Ron, who still looked scared. \lquote You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked towards the Dementor, and pulled out his wand,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote And he said, \'93None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.\'94 But the Dementor didn\rquote 
t move, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it, and it turned round and sort of glided away ...\rquote 
\par \lquote It was horrible,\rquote  said Neville, in a higher voice than usual. \lquote Did you feel how cold it went when it came in?\rquote 
\par \lquote I felt weird,\rquote  said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably. \lquote Like I\rquote d never be cheerful again ...\rquote 
\par Ginny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as Harry felt, gave a small sob; Hermione went over and put a com\-forting arm around her.
\par \lquote But didn\rquote t any of you \endash  fall off your seats?\rquote  said Harry awkwardly.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again. \lquote Ginny was shaking like mad, though ...\rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t understand. He felt weak and shivery, as though he was recovering from a bad bout of flu; he also felt the beginnings of shame. Why had he gone to pieces like that, when no one else had?
\par Professor Lupin had come back. He paused as he entered, looked around and said, with a small smile, \lquote I haven\rquote t poisoned that chocolate, you know ...\rquote 
\par Harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and toes.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes,\rquote  said Professor Lupin. \lquote Are you all right, Harry?\rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t ask how Professor Lupin knew his name.
\par \lquote Fine,\rquote  he muttered, embarrassed.
\par They didn\rquote t talk much during the remainder of the journey. At long last, the train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble to get out; owls hooted, cats miaowed, and Neville\rquote 
s pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat. It was freez\-ing on the tiny platform; rain was driving down in icy sheets.
\par \lquote Firs\rquote -years this way!\rquote  called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron and Hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward for their
 traditional journey across the lake.
\par \lquote All righ\rquote , you three?\rquote  Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They waved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform. Harry, Ron and H
ermione followed the rest of the school out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside one and shut the door, 
the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.
\par The coach smelled faintly of mould and straw. Harry felt better since the chocolate, but still weak. Ron and Hermione kept look\-ing at him sideways, as though frightened he might collapse again.
\par As the carriage trundled towards a pair of magnificent wrought-iron gates, flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars, Harry saw two more towering, hooded Dementors, standing guard on either side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf
 him again; he leant back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed through the gates. The carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping drive up to the castle; Hermione was leaning out of the tiny window, watching the many turrets and
 towers draw nearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a halt, and Hermione and Ron got out.
\par As Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in his ear.
\par \lquote You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 fainted, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Potter? Is Longbottom telling the truth? You actu\-

\par Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry\rquote s way up the stone steps to the castle, his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously.
\par \lquote Shove off, Malfoy,\rquote  said Ron, whose jaw was clenched.
\par \lquote Did you faint as well, Weasley?\rquote  said Malfoy loudly. \lquote Did the scary old Dementor frighten you, too, Weasley?\rquote 
\par \lquote Is there a problem?\rquote  said a mild voice. Professor Lupin had just got out of the next carriage.
\par Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which took in the patches on his robes and the dilapidated suitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice, he said, \lquote Oh, no \endash  er \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Professor,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \rquote  then he smirked at Crabbe and Goyle, and led them up the steps into the castle.
\par Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front doors, and into the cavernous Entrance Hall, which was lit with flaming torches and housed a magnificent mar\-
ble staircase which led to the upper floors.
\par The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry fol\-lowed the crowd towards it, but had barely glimpsed the enchant\-ed ceiling, which was black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, \lquote Potter! Granger! I want to see you both!\rquote 

\par Harry and Hermione turned around, surprised. Professor McGonagall, 
Transfiguration teacher and Head of Gryffindor house, was calling over the heads of the crowd. She was a stern-looking witch who wore her hair in a tight bun; her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles. Harry fought his way over to her with a feeli
ng of foreboding; Professor McGonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done something wrong.
\par \lquote There\rquote s no need to look so worried \endash  I just want a word in my office,\rquote  she told them. \lquote Move along there, Weasley.\rquote 
\par Ron stared as Professor McGonagall ushered Harry and Hermione away from the chattering crowd; they accompanied her across the Entrance Hall, up the marble staircase and along a corridor.
\par Once they were in her office, a small room with a large, wel\-coming fire, Professor McGonagall motioned Harry and Hermione to sit down. She settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly, \lquote 
Professor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train, Potter.\rquote 
\par Before Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on the door and Madam Pomfrey, the matron, came bustling in.
\par Harry felt himself going red in the face. It was bad enough that he\rquote d passed out, or whatever he had done, without everyone mak\-ing all this fuss.
\par \lquote I\rquote m fine,\rquote  he said. \lquote I don\rquote t need anything \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, it\rquote s you, is it?\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring this and bending down to stare closely at him. \lquote I suppose you\rquote ve been doing something dangerous again?\rquote 
\par \lquote It was a Dementor, Poppy,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall.
\par They exchanged a dark look and Madam Pomfrey clucked dis\-approvingly.
\par \lquote Setting Dementors around a school,\rquote  she muttered, pushing Harry\rquote s hair back and feeling his forehead. \lquote He won\rquote t be the last one who collapses. Yes, he\rquote 
s all clammy. Terrible things, they are, and the effect they have on people who are already delicate \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not delicate!\rquote  said Harry crossly.
\par \lquote Of course you\rquote re not,\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey absent-mindedly, now taking his pulse.
\par \lquote What does he need?\rquote  said Professor McGonagall crisply. \lquote Bed rest? Should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 fine!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 said Harry
, jumping up. The idea of what Draco Malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture.
\par \lquote Well, he should have some chocolate, at the very least,\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey, who was now trying to peer into Harry\rquote s eyes.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve already had some,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Professor Lupin gave me some. He gave it to all of us.\rquote 
\par \lquote Did he, now?\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. \lquote So we\rquote ve finally got a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies.\rquote 
\par \lquote Are you sure you feel all right, Potter?\rquote  said Professor McGonagall sharply.

\par \lquote Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Miss Granger about her timetable, then we can go down to the feast together.\rquote 
\par Harry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey, who left for the hospital wing, muttering to herself. He only had to wait a few minutes; then Hermione emerged looking very happy about something, followed by Professor McGonagall, and the three of the
m made their way back down the marble staircase to the Great Hall.
\par It was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long house tables was lined with students, their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of candles, which were floating over the tables in mid\-
air. Professor Flitwick, who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair, was carrying an ancient hat and a three-legged stool out of the Hall.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Hermione softly, \lquote we\rquote ve missed the Sorting!\rquote 
\par New students at Hogwarts were sorted into houses by trying on the Sorting Hat, which shouted out the house they were best suit\-
ed to (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff or Slytherin). Professor McGonagall strode off towards her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and Hermione set off in the oth
er direction, as quietly as possible, towards the Gryffindor table. People looked around at them as they passed along the back of the Hall, and a few of them pointed at Harry. Had the story of him collapsing in front of the Dementor travelled that fast?

\par He and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who had saved them seats.
\par \lquote What was all that about?\rquote  he muttered to Harry.
\par Harry started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the Headmaster stood up to speak, and he broke off.
\par Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impres\-
sion of great energy. He had several feet of long silver hair and beard, half-moon spectacles and an extremely crooked nose. He was often described as the greatest wizard of the age, but that was\-n\rquote t why Harry respected him. You couldn\rquote 
t help trusting Albus Dumbledore, and as Harry watched him beaming around at the students, he felt really calm for the first time since the Dementor had entered the train compartment.
\par \lquote Welcome!\rquote  said Dumbledore, the candlelight shimmering on his beard. \lquote 
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to you all, and as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast ...\rquote 
\par Dumbledore cleared his throat and continued. \lquote As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing host to some of the Dementors of Azkaban, who are here on Ministry of Magic business.\rquote 
\par He paused, and Harry remembered what Mr Weasley had said about Dumbledore not being happy with the Dementors guarding the school.
\par \lquote They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,\rquote  Dumbledore continued, \lquote and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises 
\endash  or even Invisibility Cloaks,\rquote  he added blandly, and Harry and Ron glanced at each other. \lquote It is not in the nature of a Dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of y
ou to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the Prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs foul of the Dementors.\rquote 
\par Percy, who was sitting a few seats along from Harry, puffed out his chest again and stared around impressively. Dumbledore paused again; he looked very seriously around the Hall, and nobody moved or made a sound.
\par \lquote On a happier note,\rquote  he continued, \lquote I am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year.
\par \lquote Firstly, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.\rquote 
\par There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic, applause. Only those who had been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clapped hard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin looked
 particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robes.
\par \lquote Look at Snape!\rquote  Ron hissed in Harry\rquote s ear.
\par Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table at Professor Lupin. It was common knowledge that Snape wanted the De
fence Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated Snape, was startled at the expression twisting his thin, sallow face. It was beyond anger: it was loathing. Harry knew that expression only too well; it was the look Snape wore every time he set e
yes on Harry.
\par \lquote As to our second new appointment,\rquote  Dumbledore continued, as the lukewarm applause for Professor Lupin died away, \lquote 
well, I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher, retired at the end of last year i
n order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs. However, I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties.\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione 
stared at each other, stunned. Then they joined in with the applause, which was tumultuous at the Gryffindor table in particular. Harry leant forward to see Hagrid, who was ruby red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands, his wide grin hidden 
in the tangle of his black beard.
\par \lquote We should\rquote ve known!\rquote  Ron roared, pounding the table. \lquote Who else would have set us a biting book?\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth.
\par \lquote Well, I think that\rquote s everything of importance,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Let the feast begin!\rquote 
\par The golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and drink. Harry, suddenly ravenous, helped himself to everything he could reach and began to eat.
\par It was a delicious feast; the Hall echoed with talk, laughter and the clatter of knives and forks. Harry, Ron and Hermione, howev\-er, were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to Hagrid. They knew how mu
ch being made a teacher would mean to him. Hagrid wasn\rquote t a fully qualified wizard; he had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, for a crime he had not committed. It had been Harry, Ron and Hermione who had cleared Hagrid\rquote 
s name last year.
\par At long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the golden platters, Dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all to go to bed, and they got their chance.
\par \lquote Congratulations, Hagrid!\rquote  Hermione squealed, as they reached the teachers\rquote  table.
\par \lquote All down ter you three,\rquote  said Hagrid, wiping his shining face on his napkin as he looked up at them. \lquote Can\rquote  believe it ... great man, Dumbledore ... came straight down to me hut after Professor Kettleburn said he\rquote 
d had enough ... it\rquote s what I always wanted ...\rquote 
\par Overcome with emotion, he buried his face in his napkin, and Professor McGonagall shooed them away.
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione joined the Gryffindors streaming up the marble staircase and, very tired now, along more corridors, up more and more stairs, to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower. A large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them, 
\lquote Password?\rquote 
\par \lquote Coming through, coming through!\rquote  Percy called from behind the crowd. \lquote The new password\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Fortuna Major!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par \lquote Oh no,\rquote  said Neville Longbottom sadly. He always had trouble remembering the passwords.
\par Through the portrait hole and across the common room, the girls and boys divided towards their separate staircases. Harry climbed the spiral stairs with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back. They reached their familiar, circular dor\-
mitory with its five four-poster beds and Harry, looking around, felt he was home at last.

\par \lquote New third-year timetables,\rquote  said George, passing them over. \lquote What\rquote s up with you, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Malfoy,\rquote  said Ron, sitting down on George\rquote s other side and glar\-ing over at the Slytherin table.
\par George looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending to faint with terror again.
\par \lquote That little git,\rquote  he said calmly. \lquote He wasn\rquote t so cocky last night when the Dementors were down our end of the train. Came run\-ning into our compartment, didn\rquote t he, Fred?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nearly wet himself,\rquote  said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy.
\par \lquote I wasn\rquote t too happy myself,\rquote  said George. \lquote They\rquote re horrible things, those Dementors ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Sort of freeze your insides, don\rquote t they?\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote You didn\rquote t pass out, though, did you?\rquote  said Harry in a low voice.
\par \lquote Forget it, Harry,\rquote  said George bracingly, \lquote Dad had to go out to Azkaban one time, remember, Fred? And he said it was the worst place he\rquote 
d ever been. He came back all weak and shaking ... They suck the happiness out of a place, Dementors. Most of the prison\-ers go mad in there.\rquote 
\par \lquote Anyway, we\rquote ll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch match,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of the season, remember?\rquote 
\par The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a Quidditch match, Malfoy had definitely come off worse. Feeling slightly more cheerful, Harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes.
\par Hermione was examining her new timetable.
\par \lquote Ooh, good, we\rquote re starting some new subjects today,\rquote  she said happily.
\par \lquote Hermione,\rquote  said Ron, frowning as he looked over her shoulder, \lquote they\rquote ve messed up your timetable. Look \endash  they\rquote ve got you down for about ten subjects a day. There isn\rquote t enough }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37

\par \lquote But \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, Ron, what\rquote s it to you if my timetable\rquote s a bit full?\rquote  Hermione snapped. \lquote I told you, I\rquote ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall.\rquote 
\par Just then, Hagrid entered the Great Hall. He was wearing his long moleskin overcoat and was absent-mindedly swinging a dead polecat from one enormous hand.
\par \lquote All righ\rquote ?\rquote  he said eagerly, pausing on the way to the staff table. \lquote Yer in my firs\rquote  ever lesson! Right after lunch! Bin up since five get\-tin\rquote  everythin\rquote  ready ... hope it\rquote 
s OK ... me, a teacher ... hones\rquote ly ...\rquote 
\par He grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table, still swinging the polecat.
\par \lquote Wonder what he\rquote s been getting ready?\rquote  said Ron, a note of anxi\-ety in his voice.
\par The Hall was starting to empty as people headed off towards their first lesson. Ron checked his timetable.
\par \lquote We\rquote d better go, look, Divination\rquote s at the top of North Tower. It\rquote ll take us ten minutes to get there ...\rquote 
\par They finished their breakfast hastily, said goodbye to Fred and George and walked back through the Hall. As they passed the Slytherin table, Malfoy did yet another impression of a fainting fit. The shouts of laughter followed Harry into the Entrance Hall.

\par The journey through the castle to North Tower was a long one. Two years at Hogwarts hadn\rquote t taught them everything about the castle, and they had never been inside North Tower before.
\par \lquote There\rquote s \endash  got \endash  to \endash  be \endash  a \endash  short \endash  cut,\rquote 
 Ron panted, as they climbed their seventh long staircase and emerged on an unfamiliar landing, where there was nothing but a large painting of a bare stretch of grass hanging on the stone wall.
\par \lquote I think it\rquote s this way,\rquote  said Hermione, peering down the empty passage to the right.
\par \lquote Can\rquote t be,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote That\rquote s south. Look, you can see a bit of the lake out of the window ...\rquote 
\par Harry was watching the painting. A fat, dapple-grey pony had just ambled onto the grass and was g
razing nonchalantly. Harry was used to the subjects of Hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their frames to visit each other, but he always enjoyed watching them. A moment later, a short, squat knight in a suit of armour had clanked into the pictu
re after his pony. By the look of the grass stains on his metal knees, he had just fallen off.
\par \lquote Aha!\rquote  he yelled, seeing Harry, Ron and Hermione. \lquote What vil\-lains are these that trespass upon my private lands? Come to scorn at my fall, perchance? Draw, you knaves, you dogs!\rquote 
\par They watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently, hop\-ping up and down in rage. But the sword was too long for him; a particularly wild swing made him overbalance, an
d he landed face down in the grass.
\par \lquote Are you all right?\rquote  said Harry, moving closer to the picture.
\par \lquote Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!\rquote 
\par The knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up, but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he pulled with all his might, he couldn\rquote 
t get it out again. Finally he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face.
\par \lquote Listen,\rquote  said Harry, taking advantage of the knight\rquote s exhaustion, \lquote we\rquote re looking for the North Tower. You don\rquote t know the way, do you?\rquote 
\par \lquote A quest!\rquote  The knight\rquote s rage seemed to vanish instantly. He clanked to his feet and shouted, \lquote Come follow me, dear friends, and we shall find our goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!\rquote 
\par He gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the fat pony, and cried, \lquote On foot then, good sirs and gentle lady! On! On!\rquote 
\par And he ran, clanking loudly, into the left-hand side of the frame and out of sight.
\par They hurried after him along the corridor, following the sound of his armour. Every now and then they spotted him running through a picture ahead.
\par \lquote Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!\rquote  yelled the knight, and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase.
\par Puffing loudly, Harry, Ron and Hermione climbed the tightly spiralling steps, getting dizzier and dizzier, until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them, and knew they had reached the classroom.
\par \lquote Farewell!\rquote  cried the knight, popping his head into a painting of some sinister-looking monks. \lquote Farewell, my comrades-in-arms! If ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, we\rquote ll call you,\rquote  muttered Ron, as the knight disappeared, \lquote if we ever need someone mental.\rquote 
\par They climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny land\-ing, where most of the clas
s was already assembled. There were no doors off this landing; Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the ceiling, where there was a circular trap door with a brass plaque on it.
\par \lquote Sybill Trelawney, Divination teacher,\rquote  Harry read. \lquote How\rquote re we supposed to get up there?\rquote 
\par As though in answer to his question, the trap door suddenly opened, and a silvery ladder descended right at Harry\rquote s feet. Everyone went quiet.
\par \lquote After you,\rquote  said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first.
\par He emerged into the strangest-looking classroom he had ever seen. In fact, it didn\rquote t look like a classroom at all; more like a cross between someone\rquote 
s attic and an old-fashioned teashop. At least twenty small, circular tables were crammed inside it, all surround\-ed by chintz armchairs and fat l
ittle pouffes. Everything was lit with a dim, crimson light; the curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves. It was stiflingly warm, and the fire which was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving
 off a heavy, sickly sort of per\-fume as it heated a large copper kettle. The shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking feath\-ers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards, count\-
less silvery crystal balls and a huge array of teacups.
\par Ron appeared at Harry\rquote s shoulder as the class assembled around them, all talking in whispers.
\par \lquote Where is she?\rquote  Ron said.
\par A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice.
\par \lquote Welcome,\rquote  it said. \lquote How nice to see you in the physical world at last.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect. Professor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she was very thin; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size, and
 she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. Innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck, and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings.
\par \lquote Sit, my children, sit,\rquote  she said, and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto pouffes. Harry, Ron and Hermione sat themselves around the same round table.
\par \lquote Welcome to Divination,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire. \lquote My name is Professor Trelawney. You may not have seen me be
fore. I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye.\rquote 
\par Nobody said anything in answer to this extraordinary pro\-nouncement. Professor Trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued, \lquote So you have 
chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all magical arts. I must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight, there is very little I will be able to teach you. Books can take you only so far in this field ...\rquote 
\par At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who looked startled at the news that books wouldn\rquote t be much help in this subject.
\par \lquote Many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future,\rquote 
 Professor Trelawney went on, her enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face. \lquote It is a Gift granted to few. You, boy,\rquote  she said suddenly to Neville, who almost toppled off his pouffe, \lquote is your grandmother well?\rquote 

\par \lquote I think so,\rquote  said Neville tremulously.
\par \lquote I wouldn\rquote t be so sure if I were you, dear,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings. Neville gulped. Professor Trelawney continued placidly, \lquote We will be cover
ing the basic methods of Divination this year. The first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves. Next term we shall progress to palmistry. By the way, my dear,\rquote  she shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, \lquote beware a red-haired man.\rquote 

\par Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her, and edged her chair away from him.
\par \lquote In the summer term,\rquote  Professor Trelawney went on, \lquote we shall progress to the crystal ball \endash  if we have finished with fire-omens, that is. Unfortunately, class
es will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number will leave us for ever.\rquote 
\par A very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor Trelawney seemed unaware of it.
\par \lquote I wonder, dear,\rquote  she said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest and shrank back in her chair, \lquote if you could pass me the largest silver teapot?\rquote 
\par Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the shelf and put it down on the table in front of Professor Trelawney.
\par \lquote Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are dreading \endash  it will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October.\rquote 
\par Lavender trembled.
\par \lquote Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from the shelf, come to me and I will fill it. 
Then sit down and drink; drink until only the dregs remain. Swill these around the cup three times with the left hand, then turn the cup upside-down on its saucer; wait for the last of the tea to drain away, then give your cup to your partner to read. You
 will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Unfogging the Future. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

ve broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones? I\rquote m rather attached to the pink.\rquote 
\par Sure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups than there was a tinkle of breaking china. Professor Trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said, \lquote One of the blue ones, then, dear, if you wouldn\rquote 
t mind ... thank you ...\rquote 
\par When Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled, they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly. They swilled the dregs around as Professor Trelawney had instructed, then drained the cups and swapped them.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Ron, as they both opened their books at pages five and six. \lquote What can you see in mine?\rquote 
\par \lquote A load of soggy brown stuff,\rquote  said Harry. The heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid.
\par \lquote Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past the mundane!\rquote  Professor Trelawney cried through the gloom.

\par \lquote You\rquote ll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little aura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the future.\rquote 
\par Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to side.
\par \lquote It looks like a Grim if you do this,\rquote  he said, with his eyes almost shut, \lquote but it looks more like a donkey from here,\rquote  he said, leaning to the left.
\par \lquote When you\rquote ve all finished deciding whether I\rquote m going to die or not!\rquote  said Harry, taking even himself by surprise. Now nobody seemed to want to look at him.
\par \lquote I think we will leave the lesson here for today,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, in her mistiest voice. \lquote Yes ... please pack away your things ...\rquote 
\par Silently the class took their teacups back to Professor Trelawney, packed away their books and closed their bags. Even Ron was avoiding Harry\rquote s eyes.
\par \lquote Until we meet again,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney faintly, \lquote fair for\-tune be yours. Oh, and dear \endash \rquote  she pointed at Neville, \lquote you\rquote ll be late next time, so mind you work extra hard to catch up.\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney\rquote s lad\-der and the winding staircase in silence, then set off for Professor McGonagall\rquote 
s Transfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find her classroom that, early as they had left Divination, they were only just in time.
\par Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though he was sitting in a very br
ight spotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him, as though he was about to drop dead at any moment. He hardly heard what Professor McGonagall was telling them about Animagi (wizards who could transform at will into animals), and
 wasn\rquote t even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes.
\par \lquote Really, what has got into you all today?\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, turning back into herself with a faint }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 pop, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Everybody\rquote s heads turned towards Harry again, but nobody spoke. Then Hermione raised her hand.
\par \lquote Please, Professor, we\rquote ve just had our first Divination class, and we were reading the tea leaves, and \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, of course,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning. \lquote There is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you will be dying this year?\rquote 
\par Everyone stared at her.
\par \lquote Me,\rquote  said Harry, finally.
\par \lquote I see,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with her beady eyes. \lquote Then you should know, Potter, that Sybill Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school. None of them has died yet. Seei
ng death omens is her favourite way of greeting a new class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues \endash \rquote  Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gone white. She went on, more calmly, 
\lquote Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have very little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and Professor Trelawney ...\rquote 
\par She stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of-fact tone, \lquote You look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don\rquote t let you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need not hand it in.\rquote 
\par Hermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of Professor Trelawney\rquote 
s classroom. Not everyone was convinced, however. Ron still looked worried, and Lavender whispered, \lquote But what about Neville\rquote s cup?\rquote 
\par When the Transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowd thundering towards the Great Hall for lunch.
\par \lquote Ron, cheer up,\rquote  said Hermione, pushing a dish of stew towards him. \lquote You heard what Professor McGonagall said.\rquote 
\par Ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn\rquote t start.
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  he said, in a low, serious voice, \lquote you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 haven\rquote t }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Yeah, I have,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I saw one the night I left the Dursleys.\rquote 
\par Ron let his fork fall with a clatter.
\par \lquote Probably a stray,\rquote  said Hermione calmly.
\par Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone mad.
\par \lquote Hermione, if Harry\rquote s seen a Grim, that\rquote s \endash  that\rquote s bad,\rquote  he said. \lquote My \endash  my Uncle Bilius saw one and \endash  and he died twenty-four hours later!\rquote 
\par \lquote Coincidence,\rquote  said Hermione airily, pouring herself some pumpkin juice.
\par \lquote You don\rquote t know what you\rquote re talking about!\rquote  said Ron, starting to get angry. \lquote Grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards!\rquote 
\par \lquote There you are, then,\rquote  said Hermione in a superior tone. \lquote They see the Grim and die of fright. The Grim\rquote s not an omen, it\rquote s the cause of death! And Harry\rquote s still with us because he\rquote 
s not stupid enough to see one and think, right, well, I\rquote d better pop my clogs then!\rquote 
\par Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, took out her new Arithmancy book and propped it open against the juice jug.
\par \lquote I think Divination seems very woolly,\rquote  she said, searching for her page. \lquote A lot of guesswork, if you ask me.\rquote 
\par \lquote There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup!\rquote  said Ron hotly.
\par \lquote You didn\rquote t seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry it was a sheep,\rquote  said Hermione coolly.
\par \lquote Professor Trelawney said you didn\rquote t have the right aura! You just don\rquote t like being rubbish at something for a change!\rquote 
\par He had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her Arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere.
\par \lquote If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves, I\rquote m not sure I\rquote ll be studying it much longer! That lesson was absolute rubbish compared to my Arithmancy class!\rquote 
\par She snatched up her bag and stalked away.
\par Ron frowned after her.
\par \lquote What\rquote s she talking about?\rquote  he said to Harry. \lquote She hasn\rquote t been to an Arithmancy class yet.\rquote

s hut on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. It was only when he spotted three only-too-familiar backs ahead of them that he realised they must be hav
ing these lessons with the Slytherins. Malfoy was talking animatedly to Crabbe and Goyle, who were chortling. Harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking about.
\par Hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut. He stood in his moleskin overcoat, with Fang the boarhound at his heels, looking impatient to start.
\par \lquote C\rquote mon, now, get a move on!\rquote  he called, as the class approached. \lquote Got a real treat for yeh today! Great lesson comin\rquote  up! Everyone here? Right, follow me!\rquote 
\par For one nasty moment, Harry t
hought that Hagrid was going to lead them into the Forest; Harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime. However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees, and five minutes later, they found themselves outside a kind
 of paddock. There was nothing in there.
\par \lquote Everyone gather round the fence here!\rquote  he called. \lquote That\rquote s it \endash  make sure yeh can see. Now, firs\rquote  thing yeh\rquote ll want ter do is open yer books \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote How?\rquote  said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy.
\par \lquote Eh?\rquote  said Hagrid.
\par \lquote How do we open our books?\rquote  Malfoy repeated. He took out his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 The Monster Book of Monsters, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 which he had bound shut with a length of rope. Other people took theirs out, too; some, like Harry, had belted their book shut; others had crammed them insi
de tight bags or clamped them together with bullclips.
\par \lquote Hasn\rquote  \endash  hasn\rquote  anyone bin able ter open their books?\rquote  said Hagrid, looking crestfallen.
\par The class all shook their heads.
\par \lquote Yeh\rquote ve got ter }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 stroke \rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 em,\rquote 
 said Hagrid, as though this was the most obvious thing in the world. \lquote Look ...\rquote 
\par He took Hermione\rquote s copy and ripped off the Spellotape that bound it. The book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine, and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand.
\par \lquote Oh, how silly we\rquote ve all been!\rquote  Malfoy sneered. \lquote We should have }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\cf1\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 stroked }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote I ... I thought they were funny,\rquote  Hagrid said uncertainly to Hermione.
\par \lquote Oh, tremendously funny!\rquote  said Malfoy. \lquote Really witty, giving us books that try and rip our hands off!\rquote 
\par \lquote Shut up, Malfoy,\rquote  said Harry quietly. Hagrid was looking down\-cast and Harry wanted Hagrid\rquote s first lesson to be a success.
\par \lquote Righ\rquote  then,\rquote  said Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his thread, \lquote so ... so yeh\rquote ve got yer books an\rquote  ... an\rquote  ... now yeh need the Magical Creatures. Yeah. So I\rquote ll go an\rquote  get \rquote 
em. Hang on ...\rquote 
\par He strode away from them into the Forest and out of sight.
\par \lquote God, this place is going to the dogs,\rquote  said Malfoy loudly. \lquote That oaf teaching classes, my father\rquote ll have a fit when I tell him \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Shut up, Malfoy,\rquote  Harry repeated.
\par \lquote Careful, Potter, there\rquote s a Dementor behind you \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oooooooh!\rquote  squealed Lavender Brown, pointing towards the opposite side of the paddock.
\par Trotting towards them were a dozen of the most bizarre crea\-tures Harry had ever seen.
 They had the bodies, hind legs and tails of horses, but the front legs, wings and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, with cruel, steel-coloured beaks and large, bril\-
liantly orange eyes. The talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadl
y-looking. Each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck, which was attached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these were held in the vast hands of Hagrid, who came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures.
\par \lquote Gee up, there!\rquote  he roared, shaking the chains and urging the creatures towards the fence where the class stood. Everyone drew back slightly as Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence.
\par \lquote Hippogriffs!\rquote  Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them.
\par \lquote Beau\rquote iful, aren\rquote  they?\rquote 
\par Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you had got over the first shock of seeing something that was half-horse, half-bird, you started to appreciate the Hippogriffs\rquote 
 gleaming coats, changing smoothly from feather to hair, each of them a different colour: stormy grey, bronze, a pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut and inky black.
\par \lquote So,\rquote  said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, \lquote if yeh wan\rquote  ter come a bit nearer ...\rquote 
\par No one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron and Hermione, however, approached the fence cautiously.
\par \lquote Now, firs\rquote  thing yeh gotta know abou\rquote  Hippogriffs is they\rquote re proud,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Easily offended, Hippogriffs are. Don\rquote t never insult one, \rquote cause it might be the last thing yeh do.\rquote 
\par Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle weren\rquote t listening; they were talking in an undertone and Harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson.
\par \lquote Yeh always wait fer the Hippogriff ter make the firs\rquote  move,\rquote  Hagrid continued. \lquote It\rquote s polite, see? Yeh walk towards him, and yeh bow, an\rquote  yeh wait. If he bows back, yeh\rquote re allowed ter touch him. If he doesn
\rquote  bow, then get away from him sharpish, \rquote cause those talons hurt.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right \endash  who wants ter go first?\rquote 
\par Most of the class backed further away in answer. Even Harry, Ron and Hermione had misgivings. The Hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings; they didn\rquote t seem to like being tethered like this.
\par \lquote No one?\rquote  said Hagrid, with a pleading look.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll do it,\rquote  said Harry.
\par There was an intake of breath from behind him and both Lavender and Parvati whispered, \lquote Oooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves!\rquote 
\par Harry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock fence.
\par \lquote Good man, Harry!\rquote  roared Hagrid. \lquote Right then \endash  let\rquote s see how yeh get on with Buckbeak.\rquote 
\par He untied one of the chains, pulled the grey Hippogriff away from his fellows and slipped off his leather collar. The class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy\rquote s eyes were narrowed maliciously.
\par \lquote Easy, now, Harry,\rquote  said Hagrid quietly. \lquote Yeh\rquote ve got eye contact, now try not ter blink \endash  Hippogriffs don\rquote  trust yeh if yeh blink too much ...\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s eyes immediately began to water, but he didn\rquote t shut them. Buckbeak had turned his great, sharp head, and was staring at Harry with one fierce orange eye.
\par \lquote Tha\rquote s it,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Tha\rquote s it, Harry ... now, bow ...\rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak, but he did as he was told. He gave a short bow and then looked up.
\par The Hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It didn\rquote t move.
\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  said Hagrid, sounding worried. \lquote Right \endash  back away, now, Harry, easy does it \endash \rquote 
\par But then, to Harry\rquote s enormous surprise, the Hippogriff suddenly bent his scaly front knees, and sank into what was an unmistake\-able bow.
\par \lquote Well done, Harry!\rquote  said Hagrid, ecstatic. \lquote Right \endash  yeh can touch him! Pat his beak, go on!\rquote 
\par Feeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved slowly towards the Hippogriff and reached out towards him. He patted the beak several times and the Hippogriff closed his eyes lazily, as though enjoying it.
\par The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle, who were looking deeply disappointed.
\par \lquote Righ\rquote  then, Harry,\rquote  said Hagrid, \lquote I reckon he migh\rquote  let yeh ride him!\rquote 
\par This was more than Harry had bargained for. He was used to a broomstick; but he wasn\rquote t sure a Hippogriff would be quite the same.
\par \lquote Yeh climb up there, jus\rquote  behind the wing joint,\rquote  said Hagrid, \lquote an\rquote  mind yeh don\rquote  pull any of his feathers out, he won\rquote  like that ...\rquote 
\par Harry put his foot on the top of Buckbeak\rquote s wing and hoisted himself onto his back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn\rquote t sure where to hold on; everything in front of him was covered in feathers.
\par \lquote Go on, then!\rquote  roared Hagrid, slapping the Hippogriff\rquote s hindquarters.
\par Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry; he just had time to seize the Hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upwards. It was nothing like a broom\-stick, and Harry knew which one he preferred; the Hippogriff
\rquote s wings were beating uncomfortably on either side of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didn\rquote t dare get 
a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, he now felt himself rocking backwards and forwards as the hindquarters of the Hippogriff rose and fell with his wings.
\par Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back 
to the ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leant back as the smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak; then he felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground, and just managed to hold on and push
 himself straight again.
\par \lquote Good work, Harry!\rquote  roared Hagrid, as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle cheered. \lquote OK, who else wants a go?\rquote 
\par Emboldened by Harry\rquote s success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock. Hagrid untied the Hippogriffs one by one, and soon people were bowing nervously, all over the pad\-dock. Neville ran repeatedly backwards from his, which didn
\rquote t seem to want to bend its knees. Ron and Hermione practised on the chestnut, while Harry watched.
\par Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. He had bowed to Malfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking disdainful.
\par \lquote This is very easy,\rquote  Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to hear him. \lquote I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it ... I bet you\rquote re not dangerous at all, are you?\rquote  he said to the Hippogriff. \lquote 
Are you, you ugly great brute?\rquote 
\par It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a high-pitched scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass, blood blossoming over his robes.
\par \lquote I\rquote m dying!\rquote  Malfoy yelled, as the class panicked. \lquote I\rquote m dying, look at me! It\rquote s killed me!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yer not dyin\rquote !\rquote  said Hagrid, who had gone very white. \lquote Someone help me \endash  gotta get him outta here \endash \rquote 
\par Hermione ran to open the gate while Hagrid lifted Malfoy easi\-ly. As they passed, Harry saw that there was a long, deep gash in Malfoy\rquote s arm; blood splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him, up the slope towards the castle.
\par Very shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class followed at a walk. The Slytherins were all shouting about Hagrid.
\par \lquote They should sack him straight away!\rquote  said Pansy Parkinson, who was in tears.
\par \lquote It was Malfoy\rquote s fault!\rquote  snapped Dean Thomas. Crabbe and Goyle flexed their muscles threateningly.

\par \lquote I\rquote m going to see if he\rquote s OK!\rquote  said Pansy, and they all watched her run up the marble staircase. The Slytherins, still muttering about Hagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon com\-

\par \lquote They\rquote d better not,\rquote  said Ron, who wasn\rquote t eating either.

\par \lquote Well, you can\rquote t say it wasn\rquote t an interesting first day back,\rquote  said Ron gloomily.

\par So they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole, glad not to meet anybody on their way to the front doors, as they weren\rquote t entirely sure they were supposed to be out.

\par Hagrid was sitting in his shirt-sleeves at his scrubbed wooden table; his boarhound, Fang, had his head in Hagrid\rquote s lap. One look told them that H

\par \lquote Yeah, don\rquote t worry, Hagrid, we\rquote ll back you up,\rquote  said Ron.
\par Tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid\rquote s beetle-black eyes. He grabbed both Harry and Ron and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.
\par \lquote I think you\rquote ve had enough to drink, Hagrid,\rquote  said Hermione firmly. She took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it.
\par \lquote Ar, maybe she\rquote s right,\rquote  said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who both staggered away, rubbing their ribs. Hagrid heaved him\-self out of his chair and followed Hermione unsteadily outside. They heard a loud splash.
\par \lquote What\rquote s he done?\rquote  said Harry nervously, as Hermione came back in with the empty tankard.
\par \lquote Stuck his head in the water barrel,\rquote  said Hermione, putting the tankard away.
\par Hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping the water out of his eyes.
\par \lquote Tha\rquote s better,\rquote  he said, shaking his head like a dog and drench\-ing them all. \lquote Listen, it was good of yeh ter come an\rquote  see me, I really \endash \rquote

ally favoured his own students before all others.
\par They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution. Malfoy set up his cauldron right next to Harry and Ron, so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table.
\par \lquote Sir,\rquote  Malfoy called, \lquote sir, I\rquote ll need help cutting up these daisy roots, because of my arm \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Weasley, cut up Malfoy\rquote s roots for him,\rquote  said Snape, without looking up.

\par \lquote There\rquote s nothing wrong with your arm,\rquote  he hissed at Malfoy.
\par Malfoy smirked across the table.
\par \lquote Weasley, you heard Professor Snape, cut up these roots.\rquote 
\par Ron seized his knife, pulled Malfoy\rquote s roots towards him and began to chop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes.
\par \lquote Professor,\rquote  drawled Malfoy, \lquote Weasley\rquote s mutilating my roots, sir.\rquote 
\par Snape approached their table, stared down his hooked nose at the roots, then gave Ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black hair.
\par \lquote Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley.\rquote 
\par \lquote But sir \endash !\rquote 
\par Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces.

\par \lquote And, sir, I\rquote ll need this Shrivelfig skinned,\rquote  said Malfoy, his voice full of malicious laughter.
\par \lquote Potter, you can skin Malfoy\rquote s Shrivelfig,\rquote  said Snape, giving Harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him.
\par Harry took Malfoy\rquote s Shrivelfig as Ron set about trying to repair the damage to the roots he now had to use. Harry skinned the Shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy without spea
king. Malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever.
\par \lquote Seen your pal Hagrid lately?\rquote  he asked them quietly.
\par \lquote None of your business,\rquote  said Ron jerkily, without looking up.
\par \lquote I\rquote m afraid he won\rquote t be a teacher much longer,\rquote  said Malfoy, in a tone of mock sorrow. \lquote Father\rquote s not very happy about my injury \endash \rquote

\par A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville regularly went to pieces in Potions lessons; it was his worst sub

\par Neville was pink and trembling. He looked as though he was on the verge of tears.
\par \lquote Please, sir,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote please, I could help Neville put it right \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger,\rquote  said Snape coldly, and Hermione went as pink as Neville. \lquote 
Longbottom, at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens. Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly.\rquote 
\par Snape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with fear.
\par \lquote Help me!\rquote  he moaned to Hermione.
\par \lquote Hey, Harry,\rquote  said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow Harry\rquote s brass scales, \lquote have you heard? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par \lquote Where?\rquote  said Harry and Ron quickly. On the other side of the table, Malfoy looked up, listening closely.
\par \lquote Not too far from here,\rquote  said Seamus, who looked excited. \lquote It was a Muggle who saw him. \rquote Course, she didn\rquote t really understand. The Muggles think he\rquote s just an ordinary criminal, don\rquote t they? So she \rquote

\par \lquote Not too far from here ...\rquote  Ron repeated, looking significantly at Harry. He turned around and saw Malfoy watching closely. \lquote What, Malfoy? Need something else skinning?\rquote 
\par But Malfoy\rquote s eyes were shining malevolently, and they were fixed on Harry. He leant across the table.
\par \lquote Thinking of trying to catch Black single-handed, Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, that\rquote s right,\rquote  said Harry offhandedly.
\par Malfoy\rquote s thin mouth was curving in a mean smile.
\par \lquote Of course, if it was me,\rquote  he said quietly, \lquote I\rquote d have done some\-thing before now. I wouldn\rquote t be staying in school like a good boy, I\rquote d be out there looking for him.\rquote

\par \lquote Know what?\rquote 
\par Malfoy let out a low, sneering laugh.
\par \lquote Maybe you\rquote d rather not risk your neck,\rquote  he said. \lquote Want to leave it to the Dementors, do you? But if it was me, I\rquote d want revenge. I\rquote d hunt him down myself.\rquote

said Harry angrily, but at that moment Snape called, \lquote You should have finished adding your ingredients by now. This potion needs to stew before it can be drunk; clear away while it simmers and then we\rquote ll test Longbottom\rquote s ...\rquote 

\par Crabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville sweat as he stirred his potion feverishly. Hermione was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of her mouth, so that Snape wouldn\rquote 
t see. Harry and Ron packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in the corner.
\par \lquote What did Malfoy mean?\rquote  Harry muttered to Ron, as he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from a gargoyle\rquote s mouth. \lquote Why would I want revenge on Black? He hasn\rquote t done anything to me \endash  yet.\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s making it up,\rquote  said Ron, savagely, \lquote he\rquote s trying to make you do something stupid ...\rquote 
\par The end of the lesson in sight, Snape strode over to Neville, who was cowering by his cauldron.
\par \lquote Everyone gather round,\rquote  said Snape, his black eyes glittering, \lquote and watch what happens to Longbottom\rquote s toad. If he has managed to produce a Shrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don\rquote 
t doubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned.\rquote 
\par The Gryffindors watched fearfully. The Slytherins looked excit\-ed. Snape picked up Trevor the toad in his left hand, and dipped a small spoon into Neville\rquote s potion, which was now green. He trick\-led a few drops down Trevor\rquote s throat.
\par There was a moment of hushed silence, in which Trevor gulped; then there was a small }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 pop, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 and Trevor the tadpole was wriggling in Snape\rquote s palm.
\par The Gryffindors burst into applause. Snape, looking sour, pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his robe, poured a few drops on top of Trevor and he reappeared suddenly, fully grown.
\par \lquote Five points from Gryffindor,\rquote  said Snape, which wiped the smiles from every face. \lquote I told you not to help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed.\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione climbed the steps to the Entrance Hall. Harry was still thinking about what Malfoy had said, while Ron was seething about Snape.
\par \lquote Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right! Why didn\rquote t you lie, Hermione? You should\rquote ve said Neville did it all by himself!\rquote 
\par Hermione didn\rquote t answer. Ron looked around.
\par \lquote Where is she?\rquote 
\par Harry turned, too. They were at the top of the steps now, watching the rest of the class pass them, heading for the Great Hall and lunch.
\par \lquote She was right behind us,\rquote  said Ron, frowning.
\par Malfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and Goyle. He smirked at Harry and disappeared.
\par \lquote There she is,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Hermione was panting slightly, hurrying up the stairs; one hand was clutching her bag, the other seemed to be tucking some\-thing down the front of her robes.
\par \lquote How did you do that?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Hermione, joining them.
\par \lquote One minute you were right behind us, and next moment, you were back at the bottom of the stairs again.\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  Hermione looked slightly confused. \lquote Oh \endash  I had to go back for something. Oh, no ...\rquote 
\par A seam had split on Hermione\rquote s bag. Harry wasn\rquote t surprised; he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books.
\par \lquote Why are you carrying all these around with you?\rquote  Ron asked her.
\par \lquote You know how many subjects I\rquote m taking,\rquote  said Hermione breathlessly. \lquote Couldn\rquote t hold these for me, could you?\rquote 
\par \lquote But \endash \rquote  Ron was turning over the books she had handed him, looking at the covers \endash  \lquote you haven\rquote t got any of these subjects today. It\rquote s only Defence Against the Dark Arts this afternoon.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yes,\rquote  said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same. \lquote I hope there\rquote s something good for lunch, I\rquote m starving,\rquote  she added, and she marched off towards the Great Hall.

\par \lquote D\rquote you get the feeling Hermione\rquote s not telling us something?\rquote  Ron asked Harry.

Would you please put all your books back in your bags. Today\rquote s will be a practical lesson. You will only need your wands.\rquote

\par \lquote Right then,\rquote  said Professor Lupin, when everyone was ready, \lquote if you\rquote d follow me.\rquote 
\par Puzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Professor Lupin out of the classroom. He led them along the d

\par Professor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand.
\par \lquote This is a useful little spell,\rquote  he told the class over his shoulder. \lquote Please watch closely.\rquote 
\par He raised the wand to shoulder height, said }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Waddiwasi!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
and pointed it at Peeves.
\par With the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down Peeves\rquote s left nostril; he whirled right way up and zoomed away, cursing.
\par \lquote Cool, sir!\rquote  said Dean Thomas in amazement.
\par \lquote Thank you, Dean,\rquote  said Professor Lupin, putting his wand away again. \lquote Shall we proceed?\rquote 
\par They set off again, the class looking at shabby Professor Lupin with increased respect. He led them down a second corridor and stopped, right outside the staff-room door.
\par \lquote Inside, please,\rquote  said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing back.
\par The staff room, a long, panelled room full of old, mismatched chairs, was empty except for one teacher. Professor Snape was sit\-
ting in a low armchair, and he looked around as the class filed in. His eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth. As Professor Lupin came in and made to close the door behind him, Snape said, \lquote 
Leave it open, Lupin. I\rquote d rather not witness this.\rquote  He got to his feet and strode past the class, his black robes billowing behind him. At the doorway he turned on his heel and said, \lquote Possibly no one\rquote 
s warned you, Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear.\rquote 
\par Neville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad enough that he bullied Neville in his own classes, let alone doing it in front of other teachers.
\par Professor Lupin had raised his eyebrows.
\par \lquote I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation,\rquote  he said, \lquote and I am sure he will perform it admirably.\rquote 
\par Neville\rquote s face went, if possible, even redder. Snape\rquote s lip curled, but he left, shutting the door with a snap.
\par \lquote Now, then,\rquote  said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class towards the end of the room, where the
re was nothing except an old wardrobe in which the teachers kept their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall.
\par \lquote Nothing to worry about,\rquote  said Professor Lupin calmly, as a few people jumped backwards in alarm. There\rquote s a Boggart in there.\rquote 
\par Most people seemed to feel that this }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 was}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
 something to worry about. Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively.
\par \lquote Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,\rquote  said Professor Lupin. \lquote Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks \endash  I once met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 This }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 one moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the Headmaster if the
 staff would leave it to give my third-years some practice.
\par \lquote So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 is}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196  a Boggart?\rquote 

\par Hermione put up her hand.
\par \lquote It\rquote s a shape-shifter,\rquote  she said. \lquote It can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most.\rquote 
\par \lquote Couldn\rquote t have put it better myself,\rquote  said Professor Lupin, and Hermione glowed. \lquote 
So the Boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door. Nobody knows wh
at a Boggart looks like when he is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears.
\par \lquote This means,\rquote  said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville\rquote s small splutter of terror, \lquote that we have a huge advantage over the Boggart before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?\rquote 
\par Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bob\-bing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air, was very off-putting, but Harry had a go.
\par \lquote Er \endash  because there are so many of us, it won\rquote t know what shape it should be?\rquote 
\par \lquote Precisely,\rquote  said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down looking a little disappointed. \lquote It\rquote s always best to have com\-pany when you\rquote re dealing with a Boggart. He becomes confused. Which should he becom
e, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a Boggart make that very mistake \endash  tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug. Not remotely frightening.
\par \lquote The charm that repels a Boggart is simple, yet it requires force of mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a Boggart is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 laugh\-ter. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing.

\par \lquote Riddikulus!\rquote  said the class together.
\par \lquote Good,\rquote  said Professor Lupin. \lquote Very good. But that was the easy part, I\rquote m afraid. You see, the word alone is not enough. And this is where you come in, Neville.\rquote 
\par The wardrobe shook again, though not as much as Neville, who walked forward as though he was heading for the gallows.
\par \lquote Right, Neville,\rquote  said Professor Lupin. \lquote First things first: what would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world?\rquote 
\par Neville\rquote s lips moved, but no noise came out.
\par \lquote Didn\rquote t catch that, Neville, sorry,\rquote  said Professor Lupin cheerfully.
\par Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging some\-one to help him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, \lquote Professor Snape.\rquote 
\par Nearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically. Professor Lupin, however, looked thoughtful.
\par \lquote Professor Snape ... hmmm ... Neville, I believe you live with your grandmother?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  yes,\rquote  said Neville nervously. \lquote But \endash  I don\rquote t want the Boggart to turn into her, either.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, no, you misunderstand me,\rquote  said Professor Lupin, now smiling. \lquote I wonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears?\rquote 
\par Neville looked startled, but said, \lquote Well ... always the same hat. A tall one with a stuffed vulture on top. And a long dress ... green, normally ... and sometimes a fox-fur scarf.\rquote 
\par \lquote And a handbag?\rquote  prompted Professor Lupin.
\par \lquote A big red one,\rquote  said Neville.
\par \lquote Right then,\rquote  said Professor Lupin. \lquote Can you picture those clothes very clearly, Neville? Can you see them in your mind\rquote s eye?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Neville uncertainly, plainly wondering what was com\-ing next.
\par \lquote When the Boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees you, it will assume the form of Professor Snape,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote And you will raise your wand \endash  thus \endash  and cry \'93Riddikulus\'94 \endash  and
 concentrate hard on your grandmother\rquote s clothes. If all goes well, Professor Boggart Snape will be forced into that vulture-topped hat, that green dress, that big red handbag.\rquote 
\par There was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe wobbled more violently.
\par \lquote If Neville is successful, the Boggart is likely to turn his atten\-tion to each of us in turn,\rquote  said Professor Lupin. \lquote 
I would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most, and imagine how you might force it to look comical ...\rquote 
\par The room went quiet. Harry thought ... What scared him most in the world?
\par His first thought was Lord Voldemort \endash  a Voldemort returned to full strength. But before he had even started to plan a possible counter-attack on a Boggart-Voldemort, a horrible image came floating to the surface of his mind ...
\par A rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a black cloak ... a long, rattling breath from an unseen mouth ... then a cold so penetrating it felt like drowning ...
\par Harry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one had noticed. Many people had their eyes shut tight. Ron was mutter\-ing to himself, \lquote Take its legs off.\rquote  Harry was sure he knew what that was about. Ron\rquote s greatest fear was spiders.

\par \lquote Everyone ready?\rquote  said Professor Lupin.
\par Harry felt a lurch of fear. He wasn\rquote t ready. How could you make a Dementor less frightening? But he didn\rquote t want to ask for more time; everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves.
\par \lquote Neville, we\rquote re going to back away,\rquote  said Professor Lupin. \lquote Let you have a clear field, all right? I\rquote ll call the next person forward ... everyone back, now, so Neville can get a clear shot \endash \rquote 
\par They all retreated, backing against the walls, leaving Neville alone beside the wardrobe. He looked pale and frightened, but he had pushed up the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready.
\par \lquote On the count of three, Neville,\rquote  said Professor Lupin, who was pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe. \lquote One \endash  two \endash  three \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin\rquote s wand and hit the doorknob. The wardrobe burst open. Hook-nosed and men\-acing, Professor Snape stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville.
\par Neville backed away, his wand up, mouthing wordlessly. Snape was bearing down upon him, reaching inside his robes.
\par \lquote R-r-riddikulus!\rquote  squeaked Neville.
\par There was a noise like a whip-crack. Snape stumbled; he was wearing a long, lace-trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth-eaten vulture, and swinging a huge crimson handbag from his hand.
\par There was a roar of laughter; the Boggart paused, confused, and Professor Lupin shouted, \lquote Parvati! Forward!\rquote 
\par Parvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded on her. There was another crack, and where he had stood was a blood\-stained, bandaged mummy; its sightless face was turned to P
arvati and it began to walk towards her, very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising \endash 
\par \lquote Riddikulus!\rquote  cried Parvati.
\par A bandage unravelled at the mummy\rquote s feet; it became entan\-gled, fell face forwards and its head rolled off.
\par \lquote Seamus!\rquote  roared Professor Lupin.
\par Seamus darted past Parvati.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Crack! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
Where the mummy had been was a woman with floor-length black hair and a skeletal, green-tinged face \endash  a banshee. She opened her mouth wide, and an unearthly sound filled the room, a long, wailing shriek which made the hair on Harry\rquote 
s head stand on end \endash 
\par \lquote Riddikulus!\rquote  shouted Seamus.
\par The banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat; her voice was gone.

\par \lquote It\rquote s confused!\rquote  shouted Lupin. \lquote We\rquote re getting there! Dean!\rquote 
\par Dean hurried forward.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Crack! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
The eyeball became a severed hand, which flipped over, and began to creep along the floor like a crab.
\par \lquote Riddikulus!\rquote  yelled Dean.
\par There was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap.
\par \lquote Excellent! Ron, you next!\rquote 
\par Ron leapt forward.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Crack!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
\par Quite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet tall and covered in hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers men\-acingly. For a moment, Harry thought Ron had frozen. Then \endash 
\par \lquote Riddikulus!\rquote  bellowed Ron, and the spider\rquote s legs vanished. It rolled over and over; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at Harry\rquote s feet. He raised his wand, ready, but \endash 
\par \lquote Here!\rquote  shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying forward.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Crack!}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
\par The legless spider had vanished. For a second, everyone looked wildly around to see where it was. Then they saw a silvery white orb hanging in the air in front of Lupin, who said \lquote Riddikulus!\rquote  almost lazily.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Crack!}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196

\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Snape was back. This time Neville charged forward looking determined.
\par \lquote Riddikulus!\rquote  he shouted, and they had a split second\rquote s view of Snape in his lacy dress before Neville let out a great \lquote Ha!\rquote  of laugh\-ter, and the Bogg
art exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and was gone.
\par \lquote Excellent!\rquote  cried Professor Lupin, as the class broke into applause. \lquote Excellent, Neville. Well done, everyone. Let me see ... five points to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the Boggart \endash 
 ten for Neville because he did it twice \endash  and five each to Hermione and Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote But I didn\rquote t do anything,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class, Harry,\rquote  Lupin said lightly. \lquote Very well, everyone, 
an excellent lesson. Homework, kindly read the chapter on Boggarts and summarise it for me ... to be handed in on Monday. That will be all.\rquote 
\par Talking excitedly, the class left the staff room. Harry, however, wasn\rquote t feeling cheerful. Professor Lupin had deliberately stopped him tackling the Boggart. Why? Was it because he\rquote d seen Harry collapse on the train, and thought he wasn
\rquote t up to much? Had he thought Harry would pass out again?
\par But no one else seemed to have noticed anything.
\par \lquote Did you see me take that banshee?\rquote  shouted Seamus.
\par \lquote And the hand!\rquote  said Dean, waving his own around.
\par \lquote And Snape in that hat!\rquote 
\par \lquote And my mummy!\rquote 
\par \lquote I wonder why Professor Lupin\rquote s frightened of crystal balls?\rquote  said Lavender thoughtfully.

per as Professor Lupin passed. \lquote He dresses like our old house-elf.\rquote 
\par But no one else cared that Professor Lupin\rquote 
s robes were patched and frayed. His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first. After Boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblin-like creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed, in the dungeons of castles and the
 potholes of deserted battlefields, wait\-ing to bludgeon those who had got lost. From Red Caps they moved on to Kappas, creepy water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds.
\par Harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes. Worst of all was Potions. Snape was in a particularly vin\-dictive mood these days, and no one was in any doubt why. The story of the Boggart assuming Snape\rquote 
s shape, and the way that Neville had dressed it in his grandmother\rquote s clothes, had travelled through the school like wildfire. Snape didn\rquote t seem to find it funny. His eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of Professor Lupin\rquote 
s name, and he was bullying Neville worse than ever.
\par Harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in Professor Trelawney\rquote s stifling tower room, deciphering lop-sided shapes and symbols, trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney\rquote 
s enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at him. He couldn\rquote t like Professor
 Trelawney, even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class. Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown had taken to haunting Professor Trelawney\rquote 
s tower room at lunchtimes, and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces, as though they knew things the others didn\rquote t. They had also started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to Harry, as though he was on his deathbed.

\par Nobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which, after the action-packed first class, had become extremely dull. Hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence. They were now spending les\-
son after lesson learning how to look after Flobberworms, which had to be some of the most boring creatures in existence.
\par \lquote Why would anyone }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 bother }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 looking after them?\rquote 
 said Ron, after yet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the Flobberworms\rquote  slimy throats.
\par At the start of October, however, Harry had something else to occupy him, something so enjoyable it made up for his unsatisfac\-tory classes. The Quidd
itch season was approaching, and Oliver Wood, captain of the Gryffindor team, called a meeting one Thursday evening to discuss tactics for the new season.
\par There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job it was to score goals by puttin
g the Quaffle (a red, football-sized ball) through one of the fifty-foot-high hoops at each end of the pitch; two Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls which zoomed around trying to attack the players); a 
Keeper, who defended the goalposts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catching the Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose capture ended the game and earned the Seeker\rquote 
s team an extra one hundred and fifty points.
\par Oliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in his sev\-enth and final year at Hogwarts. There was a quiet sort of despera\-
tion in his voice as he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly changing rooms on the edge of the darkening Quidditch pitch.
\par \lquote This is our last chance \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 my }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 last chance \endash 
 to win the Quidditch Cup,\rquote  he told them, striding up and down in front of them. \lquote I\rquote ll be leaving at the end of this year. I\rquote ll never get another shot at it.
\par \lquote Gryffindor haven\rquote t won for seven years now. OK, so we\rquote ve had the worst luck in the world \endash  injuries \endash  then the tournament get\-ting called off last year ...\rquote  Wood swallowed, as though the memo\-

\par Hermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that moment Crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap. A large, dead spider was dangling from his mouth.
\par \lquote Does he have to eat that in front of us?\rquote  said Ron, scowling.
\par \lquote Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?\rquote  said Hermione.

\par \lquote You can copy mine, if you like,\rquote  said Ron, labelling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart towards Harry.
\par Hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her lips, but didn\rquote t say anything. Crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at Ron, flicking the end of his bushy tail. Then, without warning, he pounced.

\par \lquote Ron, don\rquote t hurt him!\rquote  squealed Hermione. The whole common room was watching; Ron whirled the bag around, Crookshanks still clinging to it, and Scabbers came flying out of the top \endash 
\par \lquote CATCH THAT CAT!\rquote  Ron yelled, as Crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag, sprang over the table and chased after the terrified Scabbers.
\par George Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but missed; Scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers. Crookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low on his 
bandy legs and started making furious swipes beneath the chest of drawers with his front paw.
\par Ron and Hermione hurried over; Hermione grabbed Crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away; Ron threw himself onto his stomach and, with great difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail.

\par \lquote Password?\rquote  said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze.
\par \lquote Fortuna Major,\rquote  said Harry listlessly.
\par The portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room. It was full of chattering first- and second-years, and a few older students who had obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty had worn off.
\par \lquote Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!\rquote

\par After that, he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole again.
\par \lquote What was the point of waking me up?\rquote  the Fat Lady called grumpily after him as he walked away.
\par Harry wandered dispiritedly towards the library, but halfway there he changed his mind; he didn\rquote t feel like working. He turned around and came face to face with Filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of the Hogsmeade visitors.
\par \lquote What are you doing?\rquote  Filch snarled suspiciously.
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  said Harry truthfully.
\par \lquote Nothing!\rquote  spat Filch, his jowls quivering unpleasantly. \lquote A likely story! Sneaking around on your own, why aren\rquote t yo

\par \lquote Well, get back to your common room where you belong!\rquote  snapped Filch, and he stood glaring until Harry had passed out of sight.
\par But Harry didn\rquote t go back to the common room; he climbed a staircase, thinking vaguely of visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said, \lquote Harry?\rquote 
\par Harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor Lupin, looking around his office door.
\par \lquote What are you doing?\rquote  said Lupin, in a very different voice from Filch. \lquote Where are Ron and Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hogsmeade,\rquote  said Harry, in a would-be casual voice.
\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  said Lupin. He considered Harry for a moment. \lquote Why don\rquote t you come in? I\rquote ve just taken delivery of a Grindylow for our next lesson.\rquote 
\par \lquote A what?\rquote  said Harry.
\par He followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a very large tank of water. A sickly-green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly fingers.
\par \lquote Water demon,\rquote  said Lupin, surveying the Grindylow thought\-fully. \lquote We shouldn\rquote t have much difficulty with him, not after the Kappas. The trick is to break his gri
p. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong, but very brittle.\rquote 
\par The Grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weed in a corner.
\par \lquote Cup of tea?\rquote  Lupin said, looking around for his kettle. \lquote I was just thinking of making one.\rquote 
\par \lquote All right,\rquote  said Harry awkwardly.
\par Lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spout.
\par \lquote Sit down,\rquote  said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin. \lquote I\rquote ve only got teabags, I\rquote m afraid \endash  but I daresay you\rquote ve had enough of tea leaves?\rquote 
\par Harry looked at him. Lupin\rquote s eyes were twinkling.
\par \lquote How did you know about that?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote Professor McGonagall told me,\rquote  said Lupin, passing Harry a chipped mug of tea. \lquote You\rquote re not worried, are you?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry.
\par He thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the dog he\rquote d seen in Magnolia Crescent, but decided not to. He didn\rquote t want Lupin to think he was a coward, especially since Lupin already seemed to think he couldn\rquote t cope with a Boggart.

\par Something of Harry\rquote s thoughts seemed to have shown on his face, because Lupin said, \lquote Anything worrying you, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  Harry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched the Grindylow brandishing a fist at him. \lquote Yes,\rquote  he said suddenly, putting his tea down on Lupin\rquote s desk. \lquote You know that day we fought the Boggart?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Lupin slowly.
\par \lquote Why didn\rquote t you let me fight it?\rquote  said Harry abruptly.
\par Lupin raised his eyebrows.
\par \lquote I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,\rquote  he said, sound\-ing surprised.
\par Harry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he\rquote d done any such thing, was taken aback.
\par \lquote Why?\rquote  he said again.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Lupin, frowning slightly. \lquote I assumed that if the Boggart faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort.\rquote 
\par Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he\rquote d expected, but Lupin had said Voldemort\rquote s name. The only person Harry had ever heard say the name aloud (apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Clearly, I was wrong,\rquote  said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. \lquote But I didn\rquote t think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialise in the staff room. I imagined that people would panic.\rquote 
\par \lquote I did think of Voldemort first,\rquote  said Harry honestly. \lquote But then I \endash  I remembered those Dementors.\rquote 
\par \lquote I see,\rquote  said Lupin thoughtfully. \lquote Well, well ... I\rquote m impressed.\rquote  He smiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry\rquote s face. \lquote That sug\-gests that what you fear most of all is \endash 
 fear. Very wise, Harry.\rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t know what to say to that, so he drank some more tea.
\par \lquote So you\rquote ve been thinking that I didn\rquote t believe you capable of fighting the Boggart?\rquote  said Lupin shrewdly.
\par \lquote Well ... yeah,\rquote  said Harry. He was suddenly feeling a lot happier. \lquote Professor Lupin, you know the Dementors \endash \rquote 
\par He was interrupted by a knock on the door.
\par \lquote Come in,\rquote  called Lupin.
\par The door opened, and in came Snape. He was carrying a goblet, which was smoking faintly, and stopped at the sight of Harry, his black eyes narrowing.
\par \lquote Ah, Severus,\rquote  said Lupin, smiling. \lquote Thanks very much. Could you leave it here on the desk for me?\rquote 
\par Snape set the smoking goblet down, his eyes wandering between Harry and Lupin.
\par \lquote I was just showing Harry my Grindylow,\rquote  said Lupin pleasantly, pointing at the tank.
\par \lquote Fascinating,\rquote  said Snape, without looking at it. \lquote You should drink that directly, Lupin.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, yes, I will,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par \lquote I made an entire cauldronful,\rquote  Snape continued. \lquote If you need more.\rquote 
\par \lquote I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks very much, Severus.\rquote 
\par \lquote Not at all,\rquote  said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn\rquote t like. He backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful.
\par Harry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled.
\par \lquote Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me,\rquote  he said. \lquote I have never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is particularly complex.\rquote  He picked up the goblet and sniffed it. \lquote 
Pity sugar makes it useless,\rquote  he added, taking a sip and shuddering.
\par \lquote Why \endash ?\rquote  Harry began. Lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve been feeling a bit off-colour,\rquote  he said. \lquote This potion is the only thing that helps. I am very lucky to be working alongside Professor Snape; there aren\rquote t many wizards who are up to making it.\rquote 
\par Professor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a mad urge to knock the goblet out of his hands.
\par \lquote Professor Snape\rquote s very interested in the Dark Arts,\rquote  he blurted out.
\par \lquote Really?\rquote  said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potion.
\par \lquote Some people reckon \endash \rquote  Harry hesitated, then plunged reckless\-ly on, \lquote some people reckon he\rquote d do anything to get the Defence Against the Dark Arts job.\rquote 
\par Lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face.
\par \lquote Disgusting,\rquote  he said. \lquote Well, Harry, I\rquote d better get back to work. I\rquote ll see you at the feast later.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry, putting his empty teacup down.
\par The empty goblet was still smoking.

\par \lquote We\rquote d better go down, you know, the feast\rquote ll be starting in five minutes ...\rquote  They hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd, still discussing Snape.

\par \lquote Yeah, maybe,\rquote  said Harry, as they reached the Entrance Hall and crossed into the Great Hall. It had been decorate
d with hundreds and hundreds of candle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live bats and many flaming orange streamers, which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakes.
\par The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who w
ere full to bursting with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything. Harry kept glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin looked cheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking animat\-
edly to tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes along the table, to the place where Snape sat. Was he imagining it, or were Snape\rquote s eyes flickering towards Lupin more often than was natural?
\par The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts ghosts. They pop
ped out of the walls and tables to do a spot of formation gliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success with a re-enactment of his own botched beheading.
\par It had been such a good evening that Harry\rquote s good mood could\-n\rquote t even be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the Hall, \lquote The Dementors send their love, Potter!\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor which ended with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with students.
\par \lquote Why isn\rquote t anyone going in?\rquote  said Ron curiously.
\par Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait seemed to be closed.
\par \lquote Let me through, please,\rquote  came Percy\rquote s voice, and he came bustling importantly through the crowd. \lquote What\rquote s the hold-up here? You can\rquote t all have forgotten the password \endash  excuse me, I\rquote m Head Boy 
\endash \rquote 
\par And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor. They heard Percy say, in a suddenly sharp voice, \lquote Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick.\rquote 
\par People\rquote s heads turned; those at the back were standing on tip\-toe.
\par \lquote What\rquote s going on?\rquote  said Ginny, who had just arrived.
\par Next moment, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping towards the portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him through, and Harry, Ron and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was.
\par \lquote Oh, my \endash \rquote  Hermione exclaimed and grabbed Harry\rquote s arm.
\par The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great chunks of it had been torn away completely.
\par Dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned, his eyes sombre, to see Professors McGonagall, Lupin and Snape hurrying towards him.
\par \lquote We need to find her,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Professor McGonagall, please go to Mr Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the Fat Lady.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote ll be lucky!\rquote  said a cackling voice.
\par It was Peeves the poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd and look\-ing delighted, as he always did, at the sight of wreckage or worry.
\par \lquote What do you mean, Peeves?\rquote  said Dumbledore calmly, and Peeves\rquote s grin faded a little. He didn\rquote t dare taunt Dumbledore. Instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle.
\par \lquote Ashamed, Your Headship, sir. Doesn\rquote t want to be seen. She\rquote s a horrible mess. Saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging between the trees. Crying something dreadful,\rquote  he said happily. \lquote 
Poor thing,\rquote  he added, unconvincingly.
\par \lquote Did she say who did it?\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly.
\par \lquote Oh, yes, Professorhead,\rquote  said Peeves, with the air of one cradling a large bombshell in his arms. \lquote He got very angry when she wouldn\rquote t let him in, you see.\rquote  Peev
es flipped over, and grinned at Dumbledore from between his own legs. \lquote Nasty temper he\rquote s got, that Sirius Black.\rquote

\par One casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the Hall and stood themselves against the walls; another wave, and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.
\par \lquote Sleep well,\rquote  said Professor Dumbledore, closing the door behind him.
\par The Hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the Gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had just happened.
\par \lquote Everyone into their sleeping bags!\rquote  shouted Percy. \lquote Come on now, no more talking! Lights out in ten minutes!\rquote 
\par \lquote C\rquote mon,\rquote  Ron said to Harry and Hermione; they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner.
\par \lquote Do you think Black\rquote s still in the castle?\rquote  Hermione whispered anxiously.
\par \lquote Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote It\rquote s very lucky he picked tonight, you know,\rquote  said Hermione, as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk. \lquote The one night we weren\rquote t in the Tower ...\rquote 

\par \lquote I reckon he\rquote s lost track of time, being on the run,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Didn\rquote t realise it was Hallowe\rquote en. Otherwise he\rquote d have come burst\-ing in here.\rquote 
\par Hermione shuddered.
\par All around them, people were asking each other the same ques\-tion: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote How did he get in?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Probably,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Why?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because the castle\rquote s protected by more than }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 walls, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 you know,\rquote 
 said Hermione. \lquote There are all sorts of enchantments on it, to stop people entering by stealth. You can\rquote t just Apparate in here. And I\rquote d like to see the disguise that could fool those Dementors. They\rquote 
re guarding every single entrance to the grounds. They\rquote d have seen him fly in, too. And Filch knows all the secret passages, they\rquote ll have them covered ...\rquote 
\par \lquote The lights are going out now!\rquote  Percy shouted. \lquote I want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking!\rquote 
\par The candles all went out at once. The only light now came from the silvery ghosts, who were drifting about talking seriously to the Prefects, and the enchanted ceiling, which, like the sky out\-
side, was scattered with stars. What with that, and the whispering that still filled the Hall, Harry felt as though he was sleeping out of doors in a light wind.
\par Once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the 
Hall to check that everything was quiet. Around three in the morning, when many students had finally fallen asleep, Professor Dumbledore came in. Harry watched him looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the sleeping bags, telling people o
ff for talking. Percy was only a short way away from Harry, Ron and Hermione, who quickly pretended to be asleep as Dumbledore\rquote s footsteps drew nearer.
\par \lquote Any sign of him, Professor?\rquote  asked Percy in a whisper.
\par \lquote No. All well here?\rquote 
\par \lquote Everything under control, sir.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good. There\rquote s no point moving them all now. I\rquote ve found a tem\-porary guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole. You\rquote ll be able to move them back in tomorrow.\rquote 
\par \lquote And the Fat Lady, sir?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently she refused to let Black in without the password, so he attacked. She\rquote s still very distressed, but once she\rquote s calmed down, I\rquote ll have Mr Filch restore her.\rquote 

\par Harry heard the door of the Hall creak open again, and more footsteps.
\par \lquote Headmaster?\rquote  It was Snape. Harry kept quite still, listening hard. \lquote The whole of the third floor has been searched. He\rquote s not there. And Filch has done the dungeons; nothing there, either.\rquote 
\par \lquote What about the Astronomy Tower? Professor Trelawney\rquote s room? The Owlery?\rquote 
\par \lquote All searched ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Very well, Severus. I didn\rquote t really expect Black to linger.\rquote 
\par \lquote Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?\rquote  asked Snape.
\par Harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear.
\par \lquote Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.\rquote 
\par Harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood; Dumbledore\rquote s back was to him, but he could see Percy\rquote s face, rapt with attention, and Snape\rquote s profile, which looked angry.
\par \lquote You remember the conversation we had, Headmaster, just before \endash  ah \endash  the start of term?\rquote  said Snape, who was barely opening his lips, as though trying to block Percy out of the conversation.
\par \lquote I do, Severus,\rquote  said Dumbledore, and there was something like warning in his voice.
\par \lquote It seems \endash  almost impossible \endash  that Black could have entered the school without inside help. I did express my concerns when you appointed \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped Black enter it,\rquote  said Dumbledore, and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that Snape didn\rquote t reply. \lquote I must go down to the Dementors,
\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I said I would inform them when our search was complete.\rquote 
\par \lquote Didn\rquote t they want to help, sir?\rquote  said Percy.
\par \lquote Oh yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore coldly. \lquote But I\rquote m afraid no Dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while I am Headmaster.\rquote 
\par Percy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the Hall, walk\-ing quickly and quietly. Snape stood for a moment, watching the Headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face, then he, too, left.
\par Harry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of them had their eyes open, too, reflecting the starry ceiling.

\par \lquote What\rquote s wrong with him?\rquote 
\par Snape\rquote s black eyes glittered.
\par \lquote Nothing life-threatening,\rquote  he said, looking as though he wished it was. \lquote Five more points from Gryffindor, and if I have to ask you to sit down again, it will be fifty.\rquote 
\par Harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape looked around at the class.
\par \lquote As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far \endash \rquote

\par Hermione went very red, put down her hand and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how much the class loathed Snape that they were all glaring at him, because every one of them had called Hermi
one a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, \lquote You asked us a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don\rquote t want to be told?\rquote 
\par The class knew instantly he\rquote d gone too far. Snape advanced on Ron slowly, and the room held its breath.
\par \lquote Detention, Weasley,\rquote  Snape said silkily, his face very close to Ron\rquote s. \lquote And if I ever hear you criticise the way I teach a class again, you will be very sorry indeed.\rquote 
\par No one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson. They sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook, while Snape prowled up and down the rows of desks, examining the work they had been doing with Professor Lupin.
\par \lquote Very poorly explained ... that is incorrect, the Kappa is more commonly found in Mongolia ... Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten? I wouldn\rquote t have given it three ...\rquote 
\par When the bell rang at last, Snape held them back.
\par \lquote You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you recognise and kill werewolves. I want two rolls of parch\-

\par Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waited until they were well out of earshot, then burst into a furious tirade about Snape.

Harry woke extremely early next morning; so early that it was still dark. For a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him, then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright \endash  Peeves the polter
geist had been floating next to him, blowing hard in his ear.

\par Peeves puffed out his cheeks, blew hard and zoomed back\-wards out of the room, cackling.
\par Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It was half past four. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but it was very difficult, now he was awake, to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of t
h
e wind against the castle walls and the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden Forest. In a few hours he would be out on the Quidditch pitch, battling through that gale. Finally he gave up any thought of more sleep, got up, dressed, picked up his 
Nimbus Two Thousand and walked quietly out of the dormitory.
\par As Harry opened the door, something brushed against his leg. He bent down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail, and drag him outside.
\par \lquote You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,\rquote  Harry told Crookshanks suspiciously. \lquote There are plenty of mice around this place, go and chase them. Go on,\rquote  he added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot, 
\lquote leave Scabbers alone.\rquote 
\par The noise of the storm was even louder in the common room. Harry knew better than to think the match would be cancelled; Quidditch matches weren\rquote t called off for trifles such as thunder\-
storms. Nevertheless, he was starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory to him in the corridor; Diggory was a fifth-year and a lot bigger than Harry, Seekers were usually light and speedy, but Diggory\rquote 
s weight would be an advan\-tage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course.
\par Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, getting up every now and then to stop Crookshanks sneaking up the boys\rquote 
 staircase again. At long last Harry thought it must be time for breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole alone.
\par \lquote Stand and fight, you mangy cur!\rquote  yelled Sir Cadogan.
\par \lquote Oh, shut up,\rquote  Harry yawned.
\par He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time he\rquote d started on toast, the rest of the team had turned up.
\par \lquote It\rquote s going to be a tough one,\rquote  said Wood, who wasn\rquote t eating any\-thing.
\par \lquote Stop worrying, Oliver,\rquote  said Alicia soothingly, \lquote we don\rquote t mind a bit of rain.\rquote 
\par But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual, but they ran down the lawns towards the Quidditc
h pitch, heads bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went. Just before he entered the changing room, Harry saw Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their wa
y to the stadium.
\par The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood\rquote s usual pre-match pep talk, but it didn\rquote t come. He tried to speak several times, made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him.
\par The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the pitch. If the crowd was cheering they could\-n\rquote t hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder. Rain was splattering over Harry\rquote 
s glasses. How on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this?
\par The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the pitch, wearing canary-yellow robes. The captains walked up to each other and shook hands; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood now looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw Ma
dam Hooch\rquote s mouth form the words, \lquote Mount your brooms.\rquote 
 He pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant \endash  they were off.
\par Harry rose fast, but his Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind. He held it as steady as he could and turned, squinting into the rain.
\par Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and frozen, hardly able to see his team-mates, let alone the t
iny Snitch. He flew backwards and forwards across the pitch, past blurred red and yellow shapes, with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game. He couldn\rquote 
t hear the commentary over the wind. The crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to being unseated by a Bludger; his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he hadn\rquote t seen them coming.

\par He lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight. The sky was getting darker, as though night had decided to come early. Twice Harry nearly hit another player, without knowing whether it was a team-mate or opponent; every
\-one was now so wet, and the rain so thick, he could hardly tell them apart ...
\par With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch\rquote s whistle; Harry could just see the outline of Wood through the thick rain, gesturing him to the ground. The whole team splashed down into the mud.
\par \lquote I called for time out!\rquote  Wood roared at his team. \lquote Come on, under here \endash \rquote 
\par They huddled at the edge of the pitch under a large umbrella; Harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes.
\par \lquote What\rquote s the score?\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re fifty points up,\rquote  said Wood, \lquote but unless we get the Snitch soon, we\rquote ll be playing into the night.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve got no chance with these on,\rquote  Harry said exasperatedly, waving his glasses.
\par At that very moment, Hermione appeared at his shoulder; she was holding her cloak over her head and was, inexplicably, beaming.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!\rquote 
\par He handed them to her and, as the team watched in amaze\-ment, Hermione tapped them with her wand and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Impervius!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote There!\rquote  she said, handing them back to Harry. \lquote They\rquote ll repel water!\rquote 
\par Wood looked as though he could have kissed her.
\par \lquote Brilliant!\rquote  he called hoarsely after her, as she disappeared into the crowd. \lquote OK, team, let\rquote s go for it!\rquote 
\par Hermione\rquote s spell had done the trick. Harry was still numb with cold, still wetter than he\rquote d ever been in his life, but he could see. Full of fresh determination, he urged his broom through the tur\-
bulent air, staring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction ...
\par There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked lightning. This was getting more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get the Snitch quickly \endash 
\par He turned, intending to head back towards the middle of the pitch, but at that moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the stands, and Harry saw something that distracted him com\-
pletely: the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against the sky, motionless in the topmost, empty row of seats.
\par Harry\rquote s numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his Nimbus dropped a few feet. Shaking his sodden fringe out of his eyes, he squinted back into the stands. The dog had vanished.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  came Wood\rquote s anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal\-posts. \lquote Harry, behind you!\rquote 
\par Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the pitch, and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them ...
\par With a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the broom han\-dle and zoomed towards the Snitch.
\par \lquote Come on!\rquote  he growled at his Nimbus, as the rain whipped his face. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Faster!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
\par But something odd was happening. An eerie silence was falling across the stadium. The wind, though as strong as ever, was for\-getting to roar. It was as though someone had turned off the sound, as though Harry had gone suddenly deaf \endash 
 what was going on?
\par And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him, inside him, just as he became aware of something moving on the pitch below ...
\par Before he\rquote d had time to think, Harry had taken his eyes off the Snitch and looked down.
\par At least a hundred Dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him, were standing below. It was as though freezing water was rising in his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again ... someone was screaming, screaming
 inside his head ... a woman ...

\par \lquote Where is Wood?\rquote  said Harry, suddenly realising he wasn\rquote t there.
\par \lquote Still in the showers,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote We think he\rquote s trying to drown himself.\rquote 
\par Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair. Fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly.
\par \lquote C\rquote mon, Harry, you\rquote ve never missed the Snitch before.\rquote 
\par \lquote There had to be one time you didn\rquote t get it,\rquote  said George.
\par \lquote It\rquote s not over yet,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote We lost by a hundred points, right? So if Hufflepuff lose to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Hufflepuff\rquote ll have to lose by at least two hundred points,\rquote  said George.
\par \lquote But if they beat Ravenclaw ...\rquote 
\par \lquote No way, Ravenclaw are too good. But if Slytherin lose against Hufflepuff ...\rquote 
\par \lquote It all depends on the points \endash  a margin of a hundred either way \endash \rquote 
\par Harry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost ... for the first time ever, he had lost a Quidditch match.
\par After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll come and see you later,\rquote  Fred told him. \lquote Don\rquote t beat yourself up, Harry, you\rquote re still the best Seeker we\rquote ve ever had.\rquote 
\par The team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. Madam Pomfrey shut the door behind them, looking disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer to Harry\rquote s bed.
\par \lquote Dumbledore was really angry,\rquote  Hermione said in a quaking voice. \lquote I\rquote ve never seen him like that before.
 He ran onto the pitch as you fell, waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wand at the Dementors. Shot silver stuff at them. They left the stadium straight away ... he was furious they\rquote 
d come into the grounds, we heard him \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Then he magicked you onto a stretcher,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote And walked up to school with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were ...\rquote 
\par His voice faded away, but Harry hardly noticed. He was think\-ing about what the Dementors had done to him ... about the screaming voice. He looked up and saw Ron and Hermione look\-
ing at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to say.
\par \lquote Did someone get my Nimbus?\rquote 
\par Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other.
\par \lquote Er \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry, looking from one to the other.
\par \lquote Well ... when you fell off, it got blown away,\rquote  said Hermione hesitantly.
\par \lquote And?\rquote 
\par \lquote And it hit \endash  it hit \endash  oh, Harry \endash  it hit the Whomping Willow.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree which stood alone in the middle of the grounds.
\par \lquote And?\rquote  he said, dreading the answer.
\par \lquote Well, you know the Whomping Willow,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote It \endash  it doesn\rquote t like being hit.\rquote 
\par \lquote Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came round,\rquote  said Hermione in a very small voice.
\par Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside-down and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of Harry\rquote s faithful, finally beaten broomstick.

He had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him up. Hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yel\-low cabbages and Ginny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a \lquote get well\rquote 
 card she had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry kept it shut under his bowl of fruit. The Gryffindor team visited again on Sunday morning, this time accompanied by Wood, who told Harry, in a hollow, dead sort of voice, that he didn\rquote 
t blame him in the slightest. Ron and Hermione only left Harry\rquote s bedside at night. But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel any better, because they only knew half of what was troubling him.
\par He hadn\rquote t told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron and Hermione, because he knew Ron would panic and Hermione would scoff. The fact remained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearances had been followed by near-fatal acci\-
dents; the first time, he had nearly been run over by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from his broomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him until he actually died? Was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder 
for the beast?
\par And then there were the Dementors. Harry felt sick and humili\-
ated every time he thought of them. Everyone said the Dementors were horrible, but no one else collapsed every time they went near one ... no one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents.
\par For Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to no
w. He had heard her words, heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling. When the Dementors approached him, he heard the last moments of his mother\rquote 
s life, her attempts to protect him, Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort\rquote s laughter before he murdered her ... Harry dozed fit\-fully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted hands and petri\-
fied pleading, jerking awake only to dwell again on the sound of his mother\rquote s voice.

It was a relief to return on Monday to the noise and bustle of the main school, where he was forced to think about other things, even if he had to endure Draco Malfoy\rquote s taunting. Malfoy was almost beside himself with glee at Gryffindor\rquote 
s defeat. He had finally taken off his bandages, and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of Harry falling off his broom. Malfoy spent much of their next Potions class doing Dementor imitations across the dungeon
; Ron finally cracked, flinging a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy, which hit him in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from Gryffindor.

\par They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought along a glass box containing a Hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who seemed as though he was made of wisps of smoke, rather frail and harmless-looking.
\par \lquote Lures travellers into bogs,\rquote  said Professor Lupin, as they took notes. \lquote You notice the lantern dangling from his hand? Hops ahead \endash  people follow the light \endash  then \endash \rquote

\par \lquote Wait a moment, Harry,\rquote  Lupin called, \lquote I\rquote d like a word.\rquote 
\par Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the Hinkypunk\rquote s box with a cloth.
\par \lquote I heard about the match,\rquote  said Lupin, turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase, \lquote and I\rquote m sorry about your broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote The tree smashed it to bits.\rquote 
\par Lupin sighed.
\par \lquote 
They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomst
ick would have a chance.\rquote 
\par \lquote Did you hear about the Dementors, too?\rquote  said Harry with difficulty.
\par Lupin looked at him quickly.
\par \lquote Yes, I did. I don\rquote t think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry. They have been growing restless for some time ... furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds ... I suppose they were the reason you fell?\rquote 

\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Why? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par \lquote It has nothing to do with weakness,\rquote  said Professor Lupin sharply, as though he had read Harry\rquote s mind. \lquote The Dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don\rquote t have.
\rquote 
\par A ray of wintry sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminating Lupin\rquote s grey hairs and the lines on his young face.
\par \lquote Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope and
 happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can\rquote 
t see them. Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory, will be sucked out of you. If it can, the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself \endash  soulless and evil. You\rquote

\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom. You have nothing to feel ashamed of.\rquote 
\par \lquote When they get near me \endash \rquote  Harry stared at Lupin\rquote s desk, his throat tight, \lquote I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum.\rquote 
\par Lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though he had made to grip Harry\rquote s shoulder, but thought better of it. There was a moment\rquote s silence; then \endash 
\par \lquote Why did they have to come to the match?\rquote  said Harry bitterly.
\par \lquote They\rquote re getting hungry,\rquote  said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase with a snap. \lquote Dumbledore won\rquote t let them into the school, so their supply of human prey has dried up ... I don\rquote t think 
they could resist the large crowd around the Quidditch pitch. All that excite\-ment ... emotions running high ... it was their idea of a feast.\rquote 
\par \lquote Azkaban must be terrible,\rquote  Harry muttered. Lupin nodded grimly.
\par \lquote The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don\rquote t need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they\rquote

\par \lquote But Sirius Black escaped from them,\rquote  Harry said slowly. \lquote He got away ...\rquote 
\par Lupin\rquote s briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly to catch it.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  he said, straightening up. \lquote Black must have found a way to fight them. I wouldn\rquote t have believed it possible ... Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long ...\rquote

What with the promise of Anti-Dementor lessons from Lupin, the thought that he might never have to hear his mother\rquote s death again, and the fact that Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the end of November, Harry\rquote 
s mood took a definite
 upturn. Gryffindor were not out of the running after all, although they could not afford to lose another match. Wood became repossessed of his manic energy, and worked his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into December. Harr
y saw no hint of a Dementor within the grounds. Dumbledore\rquote s anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances.

Two weeks before the end of term, the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed on
e morning covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was a buzz of Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, had already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real, fluttering fairies. The stud
ents were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays. Both Ron and Hermione had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he couldn\rquote 
t stand two weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the library, Harry wasn\rquote t fooled; they were doing it to keep him company, and he was very grateful.
\par To everyone\rquote s delight except Harry\rquote s, there was to be another Hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of term.
\par \lquote We can do all our Christmas shopping there!\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!\rquote 
\par Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third-year staying behind again, Harry borrowed a copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Which Broomstick }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 from Wood, and decided to spend the day reading up on the d
ifferent makes. He had been riding one of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient Shooting Star, which was very slow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of his own.
\par On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, Harry bid goodbye to Ron and 
Hermione, who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the marble staircase alone, and headed back towards Gryffindor Tower. Snow had started to fall outside the windows, and the castle was very still and quiet.
\par \lquote Psst \endash  Harry!\rquote 
\par He turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to see Fred and George peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked, one-eyed witch.
\par \lquote What are you doing?\rquote  said Harry curiously. \lquote How come you\rquote re not going to Hogsmeade?\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go,\rquote  said Fred, with a mysterious wink. \lquote Come in here ...\rquote 
\par He nodded towards an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue. Harry followed Fred and George inside. George closed the door quietly and then turned, beaming, to look at Harry.
\par \lquote Early Christmas present for you, Harry,\rquote  he said.
\par Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks. It was a large, square, very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred and George\rquote s jokes, stared at it.
\par \lquote What\rquote s that supposed to be?\rquote 
\par \lquote This, Harry, is the secret of our success,\rquote  said George, patting the parchment fondly.
\par \lquote It\rquote s a wrench, giving it to you,\rquote  said Fred, \lquote but we decided last night, your need\rquote s greater than ours.\rquote 
\par \lquote Anyway, we know it off by heart,\rquote  said George. \lquote We bequeath it to you. We don\rquote t really need it any more.\rquote 
\par \lquote And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote A bit of old parchment!\rquote  said Fred, closing his eyes with a gri\-mace as though Harry had mortally offended him. \lquote Explain, George.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well ... when we were in our first year, Harry \endash  young, carefree and innocent \endash \rquote 
\par Harry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George had ever been innocent.
\par \lquote \endash  well, more innocent than we are now \endash  we got into a spot of bother with Filch.\rquote 
\par \lquote We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason \endash \rquote

\par \lquote \endash  detention \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  disembowelment \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and we couldn\rquote t help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Confiscated and Highly Dangerous.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par \lquote Don\rquote t tell me \endash \rquote  said Harry, starting to grin.
\par \lquote Well, what would you\rquote ve done?\rquote  said Fred. \lquote George caused a diversion by dropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer open and grabbed \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote It\rquote s not as bad as it sounds, you know,\rquote  said George. \lquote We don\rquote t reckon Filch ever found out how to work it. He probably suspected what it was, though, or he wouldn\rquote t have confiscated it.\rquote 
\par \lquote And you know how to work it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yes,\rquote  said Fred, smirking. \lquote This little beauty\rquote s taught us more than all the teachers in this school.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re winding me up,\rquote  said Harry, looking at the ragged old bit of parchment.
\par \lquote Oh, are we?\rquote  said George.
\par He took out his wand, touched the parchment lightly and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

parchment; then words began to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that proclaimed:

s cat, Mrs Norris, was prowling the second floor, and Peeves the poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry\rquote s eyes travelled up and down the familiar cor\-ridors, he noticed something else.

\par \lquote Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs,\rquote  sighed George, patting the heading of the map. \lquote We owe them so much.\rquote 
\par \lquote Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of law\-breakers,\rquote  said Fred solemnly.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said George briskly, \lquote don\rquote t forget to wipe it after you\rquote ve used it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  or anyone can read it,\rquote  Fred said warningly.
\par \lquote Just tap it again and say, \'93Mischief managed!\'94 And it\rquote ll go blank.\rquote 
\par \lquote So, young Harry,\rquote  said Fred, in an uncanny impersonation of Percy, \lquote mind you behave yourself.\rquote 
\par \lquote See you in Honeydukes,\rquote  said George, winking.
\par They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way.
\par Harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He watched the tiny ink Mrs Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor. If Filch really didn\rquote t know ... he wouldn\rquote t have to pass the Dementors at all ...
\par But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something Harry had once heard Mr Weasley say came floating out of his memory.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can\rquote t see where it keeps its brain.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
\par This map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr Weasley had been warning against ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 ... but then, Harry reasoned, he only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it wasn\rquote t as though he wanted to steal any\-
thing or attack anyone ... and Fred and George had been using it for years without anything horrible happening ...
\par Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his finger.
\par Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders
, he rolled up the map, stuffed it inside his robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom. He opened it a couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very carefully, he edged out of the room and slipped behind the statue of the one-eyed witch.
\par What did he have to do? He pulled out the map again and saw, to his astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labelled \lquote Harry Potter\rquote 
. This figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was standing, about halfway down the third-floor corri\-dor. Harry watched carefully. His little ink self appeared to be tap\-
ping the witch with his minute wand. Harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue. Nothing happened. He looked back at the map. The tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure. The word inside said }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Dissendium\rquote .}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196

\par At once, the statue\rquote s hump opened wide enough to admit a fair\-ly thin person. Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the map away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed himself forwards.
\par He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was pitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, \lquote Lumos!\rquote 
 and saw that he was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the map, tapped it with the tip of his wand and muttered, \lquote Mischief managed!\rquote 
 The map went blank at once. He folded it carefully, tucked it inside his robes, then, heart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, he set off.
\par The passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else. Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of him.
\par It took ages, but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sus\-tain him. After what felt like an hour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harry sped up, his face hot, his feet very cold.
\par Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps which rose out o
f sight above him. Careful not to make any noise, Harry began to climb. A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as he climbed, watching his feet ... then, without warning, his head hit something hard.
\par It seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there, massaging the top of his head, listening. He couldn\rquote t hear any sounds above him. Very slowly, he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge.
\par He was in a cellar which was full of wooden crates and boxes. Harry climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it \endash 
 it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there. Harry crept slowly towards the wooden staircase that led upstairs. Now he could definitely hear voices, not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening an
d shutting of a door.
\par Wondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand; somebody was about to come down\-stairs.
\par \lquote And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they\rquote ve nearly cleaned us out \endash \rquote  said a woman\rquote s voice.
\par A pair of feet was coming down the staircase. Harry leapt behind an enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass. He heard the man shifting boxes against the wall opposite. He might not get another chance \endash 
\par Quickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed the stairs; looking back, he saw an enormous back\-
side and a shiny bald head buried in a box. Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs, slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes \endash  he ducked, crept sideways and then straightened up.
\par Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no one looked twice at Harry. He edged amongst them, looking around, and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over Dudley\rquote s piggy face if he could se
e where Harry was now.
\par There were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking sweets imaginable. Creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconut ice, fat, honey-coloured toffees; hundreds of different kinds of chocolate in neat rows; the
re was a large barrel of Every Flavour Beans, and another of Fizzing Whizzbees, the levitating sherbet balls that Ron had mentioned; along yet another wall were \lquote Special Effects\rquote  sweets: Drooble\rquote 
s Best Blowing Gum (which filled a room with bluebell-coloured bubbles that refused to pop for days), the strange, splintery Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny black Pepper Imps (\lquote breathe fire for your friends!\rquote ), Ice Mice (\lquote 
hear your teeth chatter and squeak!\rquote ), peppermint creams shaped like toads (\lquote hop realistically in the stomach!\rquote ), fragile sugar-spun quills and exploding bonbons.
\par Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth-years and saw a sign hanging in the furthest corner of the shop (\lquote Unusual Tastes\rquote ). Ron and Hermione were standing underneath it, examining 
a tray of blood-flavoured lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind them.
\par \lquote Urgh, no, Harry won\rquote t want one of those, they\rquote re for vampires, I expect,\rquote  Hermione was saying.
\par \lquote How about these?\rquote  said Ron, shoving a jar of Cockroach Cluster under Hermione\rquote s nose.
\par \lquote Definitely not,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Ron nearly dropped the jar.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Harry!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 squealed Hermione. What are you doing here? How \endash

\par \lquote Wow!\rquote  said Ron, looking very impressed. \lquote You\rquote ve learnt to Apparate!\rquote 
\par \lquote  \rquote Course I haven\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry. He dropped his voice so that none of the sixth-years could hear him and told them all about the Marauder\rquote s Map.

\lquote I\rquote m their brother!\rquote 
\par \lquote But Harry isn\rquote t going to keep it!\rquote  said Hermione, as though the idea was ludicrous. \lquote He\rquote s going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall, aren\rquote t you, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I\rquote m not!\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Are you mad?\rquote  said Ron, goggling at Hermione. \lquote Hand in some\-thing that good?\rquote 
\par \lquote If I hand it in, I\rquote ll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred and George nicked it!\rquote 
\par \lquote But what about Sirius Black?\rquote  Hermione hissed. \lquote He could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers have got to know!\rquote 
\par \lquote He can\rquote t be getting in through a passage,\rquote  said Harry quickly. \lquote There are seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filch already knows about four of them. And the other three \endash  one of them\rquote 
s caved in, so no one can get through it. One of them\rquote s got the Whomping Willow planted over the entrance, so you can\rquote t get out of it. And the one I just came through \endash  well \endash  it\rquote 
s really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar \endash  so unless he knew it was there \endash \rquote 
\par Harry hesitated. What if Black did know the passage was there? Ron, however, cleared his throat significantly, and pointed to a notice pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door.

\par When Ron and Hermione had paid for all their sweets, the three of them left Honeydukes for the blizzard outside.
\par Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow; there were holly wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the trees.
\par Harry shivered; unlike the other two, he didn\rquote t have his cloak. They headed up the street, heads bowed against the wind, Ron and Hermione shouting through their scarves.
\par \lquote That\rquote s the Post Office \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Zonko\rquote s is up there \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We could go up to the Shrieking Shack \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Tell you what,\rquote  said Ron, his teeth chattering, \lquote shall we go for a Butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?\rquote 
\par Harry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and his hands were freezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn.
\par It was extremely crowded, noisy, warm and smoky. A curvy sort of woman with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy war\-locks up at the bar.
\par \lquote That\rquote s Madam Rosmerta,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I\rquote ll get the drinks, shall I?\rquote  he added, going slightly red.
\par Harry and Hermione made their way to the back of the room, where there was a small, vacant table between the window and a handsome Christmas tree which stood next to the fireplace. Ron came back five minutes later, carrying thre
e foaming tankards of hot Butterbeer.
\par \lquote Happy Christmas!\rquote  he said happily, raising his tankard.
\par Harry drank deeply. It was the most delicious thing he\rquote d ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of him from the inside.
\par A sudden breeze ruffled his hair. The door of the Three Broomsticks had opened again. Harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked.
\par Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered the pub in a flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed by Hagrid, who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak: Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic.

\par In an instant, Ron and Hermione had both placed hands on the top of Harry\rquote s head and forced him off his stool and under the table. Dripping with Butterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry clutched his empty tankard and watched the teachers
\rquote  and Fudge\rquote s feet move towards the bar, pause, then turn and walk right towards him.
\par Somewhere above him, Hermione whispered, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Mobiliarbus!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
\par The Christmas tree beside their tab
le rose a few inches off the ground, drifted sideways and landed with a soft thump right in front of their table, hiding them from view. Staring through the dense lower branches, Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside thei
rs, then heard the grunts and sighs of the teachers and Minister as they sat down.
\par Next he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels, and heard a woman\rquote s voice.
\par \lquote A small Gillywater \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Mine,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall\rquote s voice.
\par \lquote Four pints of mulled mead \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ta, Rosmerta,\rquote  said Hagrid.
\par \lquote A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Mmm!\rquote  said Professor Flitwick, smacking his lips.
\par \lquote So you\rquote ll be the redcurrant rum, Minister.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you, Rosmerta, m\rquote dear,\rquote  said Fudge\rquote s voice. \lquote Lovely to see you again, I must say. Have one yourself, won\rquote t you? Come and join us ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, thank you very much, Minister.\rquote 
\par Harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again. His heart was pounding uncomfortably in his throat. Why hadn\rquote t it 
occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers, too? And how long were they going to sit there? He needed time to sneak back into Honeydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight ... Hermione\rquote 
s leg gave a nervous twitch next to him.
\par \lquote So, what brings you to this neck of the woods, Minister?\rquote  came Madam Rosmerta\rquote s voice.
\par Harry saw the lower part of Fudge\rquote s thick body twist in his chair as though he was checking for eavesdroppers. Then he said in a quiet voice, \lquote What else, m\rquote dear, b
ut Sirius Black? I daresay you heard what happened up at the school at Hallowe\rquote en?\rquote 
\par \lquote I did hear a rumour,\rquote  admitted Madam Rosmerta.
\par \lquote Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?\rquote  said Professor McGonagall exasperatedly.
\par \lquote Do you think Black\rquote s still in the area, Minister?\rquote  whispered Madam Rosmerta.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sure of it,\rquote  said Fudge shortly.
\par \lquote You know that the Dementors have searched my pub twice?\rquote  said Madam Rosmerta, a slight edge to her voice. \lquote Scared all my customers away ... it\rquote s very bad for business, Minister.\rquote 
\par \lquote Rosmerta, m\rquote dear, I don\rquote t like them any more than you do,\rquote  said Fudge uncomfortably. \lquote Necessary precaution ... unfortunate, but there you are ... I\rquote ve just met some of them. They\rquote 
re in a fury against Dumbledore \endash  he won\rquote t let them inside the castle grounds.\rquote 
\par \lquote I should think not,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall sharply. \lquote How are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating around?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hear, hear!\rquote  squeaked tiny Professor Flitwick, whose feet were dangling a foot from the ground.
\par \lquote All the same,\rquote  demurred Fudge, \lquote they are here to protect you all from something much worse ... we all know what Black\rquote s capable of ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Do you know, I still have trouble believing it,\rquote  said Madam Rosmerta thoughtfully. \lquote Of all the people to go over to the Dark side, Sirius Black was the last I\rquote 
d have thought ... I mean, I remember him when he was a boy at Hogwarts. If you\rquote d told me then what he was going to become, I\rquote d have said you\rquote d had too much mead.\rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t know the half of it, Rosmerta,\rquote  said Fudge gruffly. \lquote The worst he did isn\rquote t widely known.\rquote 
\par \lquote The worst?\rquote  said Madam Rosmerta, her voice alive with curios\-ity. \lquote Worse than murdering all those poor people, you mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote I certainly do,\rquote  said Fudge.
\par \lquote I can\rquote t believe that. What could possibly be worse?\rquote 
\par \lquote You say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,\rquote  murmured Professor McGonagall. \lquote Do you remember who his best friend was?\rquote 
\par \lquote Naturally,\rquote  said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. \lquote Never saw one without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here \endash  ooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the dou\-ble act, Sirius Black and James Potter!
\rquote 
\par Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him.
\par \lquote Precisely,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course \endash  exceptionally bright, in fact \endash  but I don\rquote t think we\rquote 
ve ever had such a pair of troublemakers \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno,\rquote  chuckled Hagrid. \lquote Fred and George Weasley could give \rquote em a run fer their money.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote d have thought Black and Potter were brothers!\rquote  chimed in Professor Flitwick. \lquote Inseparable!\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course they were,\rquote  said Fudge. \lquote Potter trusted Black beyond all his other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man when James married Lily. Then they nam
ed him godfather to Harry. Harry has no idea, of course. You can imagine how the idea would torment him.\rquote 
\par \lquote Because Black turned out to be in league with You-Know-Who?\rquote  whispered Madam Rosmerta.
\par \lquote Worse even than that, m\rquote dear ...\rquote  Fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble. \lquote 
Not many people are aware that the Potters knew You-Know-Who was after them. Dumbledore, who was of course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful spies. One of them tipped him off, and he alerte
d James and Lily at once. He advised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn\rquote t an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them that their best chance was the Fidelius Charm.\rquote 
\par \lquote How does that work?\rquote  said Madam Rosmerta, breathless with interest. Professor Flitwick cleared his throat.
\par \lquote An immensely complex spell,\rquote  he said squeakily, \lquote involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find 
\endash  unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had 
his nose pressed against their sitting-room window!\rquote 
\par \lquote So Black was the Potters\rquote  Secret-Keeper?\rquote  whispered Madam Rosmerta.
\par \lquote Naturally,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote James Potter told Dumbledore that Black would die rather than tell where they were, that Blac
k was planning to go into hiding himself ... and yet, Dumbledore remained worried. I remember him offering to be the Potters\rquote  Secret-Keeper himself.\rquote 
\par \lquote He suspected Black?\rquote  gasped Madam Rosmerta.
\par \lquote He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keep\-ing You-Know-Who informed of their movements,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall darkly. \lquote 
Indeed, he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to You-Know-Who.\rquote 
\par \lquote But James Potter insisted on using Black?\rquote 
\par \lquote He did,\rquote  said Fudge heavily. \lquote And then, barely a week after the Fidelius Charm had been performed \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Black betrayed them?\rquote  breathed Madam Rosmerta.
\par \lquote He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent role, he was ready to declare his support openly for You-Know-Who, and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the Potters\rquote 
 death. But, as we all know, You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter. Powers gone, horribly weakened, he fled. And this left Black in a very nasty position i
ndeed. His Master had fallen at the very moment when he, Black, had shown his true colours as a traitor. He had no choice but to run for it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Filthy, stinkin\rquote  turncoat!\rquote  Hagrid said, so loudly that half the bar went quiet.

 Ha! But I\rquote d had me orders from Dumbledore, an\rquote  I told Black no, Dumbledore said Harry was ter go ter his aunt an\rquote  uncle\rquote s. Black argued, but in the end he gave in. Told me ter take his motorbike ter get Harry there. \'93I won

\par \lquote Alas, if only we had,\rquote  said Fudge bitterly. \lquote It was not we who found him. It was little Peter Pettigrew \endash  another of the Potters\rquote  friends. Maddened by grief, no doubt, and knowing that Black had been the Potters\rquote 
 Secret-Keeper, he went after Black himself.\rquote 
\par \lquote Pettigrew ... that fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at Hogwarts?\rquote  said Madam Rosmerta.

 She sounded as though she had a sudden head cold.
\par \lquote There, now, Minerva,\rquote  said Fudge kindly, \lquote Pettigrew died a hero\rquote s death. Eye-witnesses \endash  Muggles, of course, we wiped their memories later \endash  told us how Pettigrew cornered Black. They say he was sobbing. \'93
Lily and James, Sirius! How could you!\'94 And then he went for his wand. Well, of course, Black was quicker. Blew Pettigrew to smithereens ...\rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall blew her nose and said thickly, \lquote Stupid boy ... foolish boy ... he was always hopeless at duelling ... should have left it to the Ministry ...\rquote

\par \lquote You don\rquote t know what you\rquote re talking about, Hagrid,\rquote  said Fudge sharply. \lquote Nobody but trained Hit Wiz
ards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have stood a chance against Black once he was cornered. I was Junior Minister in the Department of Magical Catastrophes at the time, and I was one of the first on the scene after Black murdered all those p

 I will never forget it. I still dream about it sometimes. A crater in the middle of the street, so deep it had cracked the sewer below. Bodies everywhere. Muggles screaming. And Black standing there laughing, with what was left of Pettigrew in fr

\par Fudge\rquote s voice stopped abruptly. There was the sound of five noses being blown.
\par \lquote Well, there you have it, Rosmerta,\rquote  said Fudge thickly. \lquote Black was taken a
way by twenty members of the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol and Pettigrew received the Order of Merlin, First Class, which I think was some comfort to his poor mother. Black\rquote s been in Azkaban ever since.\rquote 
\par Madam Rosmerta let out a long sigh.
\par \lquote Is it true he\rquote s mad, Minister?\rquote 
\par \lquote I wish I could say that he was,\rquote  said Fudge slowly. \lquote I certainly believe his master\rquote s defeat unhinged him for a while. The murder of Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man \endash 
 cruel ... pointless. Yet I met Black on my last inspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark, there\rquote s no sense in them ... but I was shocked at how }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\endash  asked if I\rquote d finished with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he missed doing the crossword. Yes, I was astounded at how little effect the Dementors seemed to be having on him \endash  and he was one of the most heavil

\par \lquote But what do you think he\rquote s broken out to do?\rquote  said Madam Rosmerta. \lquote Good gracious, Minister, he isn\rquote t trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is he?\rquote 
\par \lquote I daresay that is his \endash  er \endash  eventual plan,\rquote  said Fudge evasively. \lquote 
But we hope to catch Black long before that. I must say, You-Know-Who alone and friendless is one thing ... but give him back his most devoted servant, and I shudder to think how quickly he\rquote ll rise again ...\rquote 
\par There was a small chink of glass on wood. Someone had set down their glass.
\par \lquote You know, Cornelius, if you\rquote re dining with the Headmaster, we\rquote d better head back up to the castle,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall.
\par One by one, the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the weight of their owners once more; hems of cloaks swung into sight and Madam Rosmerta\rquote

\rquote t anyone ever mentioned the fact that Harry\rquote s parents had died because their best friend had betrayed them?
\par Ron and Hermione watched Harry nervously all through din\-ner, not daring to talk about what they\rquote d overheard, because Percy was sitting close by them. When they went upstairs to the crowd\-
ed common room, it was to find Fred and George had set off half-a-dozen Dungbombs in a fit of end-of-term high spirits. Harry, who didn\rquote t want Fred and George asking him whether he\rquote 
d reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked quietly up to the empty dor\-mitory, and headed straight for his bedside cabinet. He pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for \endash 
 the leather-bound photo album Hagrid had given him two years ago, which was full of wizard pictures of his mother and father. He sat down on his bed, drew the hangings around him, and started turning the pages, searching, until ...
\par He stopped on a picture of his parents\rquote  wedding day. There was his father waving up at 
him, beaming, the untidy black hair Harry had inherited standing up in all directions. There was his mother, alight with happiness, arm in arm with his Dad. And there ... that must be him. Their best man ... Harry had never given him a thought before.

\par If he hadn\rquote t known it was the same person, he would never have guessed it was Black in this old photograph. His face wasn\rquote 
t sunken and waxy, but handsome, full of laughter. Had he already been working for Voldemort when this picture had been taken? Was he alre
ady planning the deaths of the two people next to him? Did he realise he was facing twelve years in Azkaban, twelve years which would make him unrecognisable?

\par The dormitory door opened.
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote  said Ron\rquote s voice uncertainly.
\par But Harry lay still, pretending to be asleep. He heard Ron leave again, and rolled over on his back, his eyes wide open.
\par A hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through Harry like poi
son. He could see Black laughing at him through the darkness, as though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes. He watched, as though somebody was playing him a piece of film, Sirius Black blasting Peter Pettigrew (who resembled Nevi
lle Longbottom) into a thousand pieces. He could hear (though he had no idea what Black\rquote s voice might sound like) a low, excited mutter. \lquote It has happened, my Lord ... the Potters have made me their Secret Keeper ...\rquote 
 And then came another voice, laughing shrilly, the same laugh that Harry heard inside his head whenever the Dementors drew near ...

\par \lquote Where is everyone?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Gone! It\rquote s the first day of the holidays, remember?\rquote  said Ron, watching Harry closely. \lquote It\rquote s nearly lunchtime, I was going to come and wake you up in a minute.\rquote

\par \lquote I\rquote m fine,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Harry, listen,\rquote  said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, \lquote you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday. But the thing is, you mustn\rquote t go doing anything stupid.\rquote

\par Harry looked at them. They didn\rquote t seem to understand at all.

\par Again, Harry didn\rquote t answer. He didn\rquote t know what he wanted to do. All he knew was that the idea of doing nothing, while Black was at liberty, was almost more than he could stand.

\par \lquote Malfoy\rquote s dad must have told him,\rquote  said Harry, ignoring Ron. \lquote He was right in Voldemort\rquote s inner circle \endash \rquote

\par \lquote I\rquote ll never know what they\rquote d have wanted because, thanks to Black, I\rquote ve never spoken to them,\rquote  said Harry shortly.
\par There was a silence, in which Crookshanks stretched luxuri\-ously, flexing his claws. Ron\rquote s pocket quivered.
\par \lquote Look,\rquote  said Ron, obviously casting around for a change of sub\-ject, \lquote it\rquote s the holidays! It\rquote s nearly Christmas! Let\rquote s \endash  let\rquote s go down and see Hagrid. We haven\rquote t visited him for ages!\rquote

\par \lquote Yeah, let\rquote s go,\rquote  said Harry, sitting up, \lquote and I can ask him how come he never mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents!\rquote 
\par Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn\rquote t what Ron had had in mind.
\par \lquote Or we could have a game of chess,\rquote  he said hastily, \lquote or Gobstones. Percy left a set \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, let\rquote s visit Hagrid,\rquote  said Harry firmly.
\par So they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the portrait hole (\lquote Stand and fight, you yellow-bellied mongrels!\rquote ), down through the empty castle and out through the oak front doors.
\par They made their way slowly down the la
wn, making a shallow trench in the glittering, powdery snow, their socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and freezing. The Forbidden Forest looked as though it had been enchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and Hagrid\rquote 
s cabin looked like an iced cake.
\par Ron knocked, but there was no answer.
\par \lquote He\rquote s not out, is he?\rquote  said Hermione, who was shivering under her cloak.
\par Ron had his ear to the door.
\par \lquote There\rquote s a weird noise,\rquote  he said. \lquote Listen \endash  is that Fang?\rquote 
\par Harry and Hermione put their ears to the door, too. From inside the cabin came a series of low, throbbing moans.
\par \lquote Think we\rquote d better go and get someone?\rquote  said Ron nervously.
\par \lquote Hagrid!\rquote  called Harry, thumping the door. \lquote Hagrid, are you in there?\rquote 
\par There was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door creaked open. Hagrid stood there with his eyes red and swollen; tears splashing down the front of his leather waistcoat.
\par \lquote Yeh\rquote ve heard!\rquote  he bellowed, and he flung himself onto Harry\rquote s neck.
\par Hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man, this was no laughing matter. Harry, about to collapse under Hagrid\rquote 
s weight, was rescued by Ron and Hermione, who each seized Hagrid under an arm and heaved him, Harry helping, back into the cabin. Hagr
id allowed himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over the table, sobbing uncontrollably, his face glazed with tears which dripped down into his tangled beard.
\par \lquote Hagrid, what }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 it?\rquote  said Hermione, aghast.

\par A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid\rquote s cabin made Harry, Ron and Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the Hippogriff was lying in the corner, chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.
\par \lquote I couldn\rquote  leave him tied up out there in the snow!\rquote  choked Hagrid. \lquote All on his own! At Christmas!\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione looked at each other. They had never seen eye to eye with Hagrid about what he called \lquote interesting crea\-tures\rquote  and other people called \lquote terrifying monsters\rquote . On the other hand, there didn\rquote 
t seem to be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid\rquote s usual standards, he was positively cute.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll have to put up a good strong defence, Hagrid,\rquote  said Hermione, sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid\rquote s massive forearm. \lquote I\rquote m sure you can prove Buckbeak is safe.\rquote

\par Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wail and lurched forwards, his face in his arms.
\par \lquote What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote He\rquote s done more\rquote n enough fer me already,\rquote  groaned Hagrid. \lquote Got enough on his plate what with keepin\rquote  them Dementors outta the castle, an\rquote  Sirius Black lurkin\rquote  around \endash \rquote 
\par Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though expect\-ing him to start berating Hagrid for not telling him the truth about Black. But Harry couldn\rquote t bring himself to do it, not now he saw Hagrid so miserable and scared.
\par \lquote Listen, Hagrid,\rquote  he said, \lquote you can\rquote t give up. Hermione\rquote s right, you just need a good defence. You can call us as witnesses \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m sure I\rquote ve read about a case of Hippogriff-baiting,\rquote  said Hermione thoughtfully, \lquote where the Hippogriff got off. I\rquote ll look it up for you, Hagrid, and see exactly what happened.\rquote 
\par Hagrid howled still more loudly. Harry and Hermione looked at Ron to help them.
\par \lquote Er \endash  shall I make a cup of tea?\rquote  said Ron.
\par Harry stared at him.
\par \lquote It\rquote s what my mum does whenever someone\rquote s upset,\rquote  Ron mut\-tered, shrugging.
\par At last, after many more assurances of help, with a steaming mug of tea in front of him, Hagrid blew his nose on a handker\-chief the size of a tablecloth and said, \lquote Yer right. I can\rquote  afford to go ter pieces. Gotta pull meself together ...
\rquote 
\par Fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his head on Hagrid\rquote s knee.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve not bin meself lately,\rquote  said Hagrid, stroking Fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other. \lquote Worried abou\rquote  Buckbeak, an\rquote  no one likin\rquote  me classes \endash \rquote

\par \lquote Yeah, they\rquote re great!\rquote  said Ron, crossing his fingers under the table. \lquote Er \endash  how are the Flobberworms?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dead,\rquote  said Hagrid gloomily. \lquote Too much lettuce.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, no!\rquote  said Ron, his lip twitching.
\par \lquote An\rquote  them Dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an\rquote  all,\rquote  said Hagrid, with a sudden shudder. \lquote Gotta walk past \rquote em ev\rquote ry time I want a drink in the Three Broomsticks. \rquote S like bein\rquote 
 back in Azkaban \endash \rquote 
\par He fell silent, gulping his tea. Harry, Ron and Hermione watched him breathlessly. They had never heard Hagrid talk about his brief spell in Azkaban before. After a brief pause, Hermione said timidly, \lquote Is it awful in there, Hagrid?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeh\rquote ve no idea,\rquote  said Hagrid quietly. \lquote Never bin anywhere like it. Thought I was goin\rquote  mad. Kep\rquote  goin\rquote 
 over horrible stuff in me mind ... the day I got expelled from Hogwarts ... day me Dad died ... day I had ter let Norbert go ...\rquote

s, though far from fun, had nevertheless had the effect Ron and Hermione had hoped. Though Harry had by no means forgotten about Black, he couldn\rquote 
t brood constantly on revenge if he wanted to help Hagrid win his case against the Committee for the Disposal 
of Dangerous Creatures. He, Ron and Hermione went to the library next day, and returned to the empty common room laden with books which might help prepare a defence for Buckbeak. The three of them sat in front of the roar\-
ing fire, slowly turning the pages of dusty volumes about famous cases of marauding beasts, speaking occasionally when they ran across something relevant.

\par Meanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual magnificent Christmas decorations had been put up, despite the fact that hard\-
ly any of the students remained to enjoy them. Thick streamers of holly and mistletoe were strung along the corridors, mysterious lights shone from inside every suit of armour and the Great Hall was filled with it
s usual twelve Christmas trees, glittering with golden stars. A powerful and delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors, and by Christmas Eve, it had grown so strong that even Scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of Ron\rquote 
s pocket to sniff hopefully at the air.
\par On Christmas morning, Harry was woken by Ron throwing his pillow at him.
\par \lquote Oy! Presents!\rquote 
\par Harry reached for his glasses and put them on, squinting through the semi-darkness to the foot of his bed, where a small heap of parcels had appeared. Ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents.

\rquote 
\par Harry had. Mrs Weasley had sent him a scarlet jumper with the Gryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen home-baked mince pies, some Christmas cake and a box of nut brittle. As he moved all these things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying und
erneath.
\par \lquote What\rquote s that?\rquote  said Ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand.
\par \lquote Dunno ...\rquote 
\par Harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread. Ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer look.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t believe it,\rquote  he said hoarsely.
\par It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry had gone to see every day in Diagon Alley. Its handle glittered as he picked it up. He could feel it vibrating, and let go; it hung 
in mid-air, unsupported, at exactly the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle right down to the perfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail.
\par \lquote Who sent it to you?\rquote  said Ron in a hushed voice.
\par \lquote Look and see if there\rquote s a card,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Ron ripped apart the Firebolt\rquote s wrappings.
\par \lquote Nothing! Blimey, who\rquote d spend that much on you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Harry, feeling stunned, \lquote I\rquote m betting it wasn\rquote t the Dursleys.\rquote 
\par \lquote I bet it was Dumbledore,\rquote  said Ron, now walking round and round the Firebolt, taking in every glorious inch. \lquote He sent you the Invisibility Cloak anonymously ...\rquote 
\par \lquote That was my dad\rquote s, though,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Dumbledore was just passing it on to me. He wouldn\rquote t spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can\rquote t go giving students stuff like this \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s why he wouldn\rquote t say it was from him!\rquote  said Ron. \lquote In case some git like Malfoy said it was favouritism. Hey, Harry \endash \rquote  Ron gave a great whoop of laughter, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote What\rquote re you two laughing about?\rquote 
\par Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing-gown and carrying Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied around his neck.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t bring him in here!\rquote  said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pyjama pocket. But Hermione wasn\rquote t listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus\rquote

\par \lquote Oh, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Harry! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Who sent you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote No idea,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote There wasn\rquote t a card or anything with it.\rquote 
\par To his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued by this news. On the contrary, her face fell, and she bit her lip.
\par \lquote What\rquote s the matter with you?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Hermione slowly, \lquote but it\rquote s a bit odd, isn\rquote t it? I mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par Ron sighed exasperatedly.
\par \lquote It\rquote s the best broom there is, Hermione,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote So it must\rquote ve been really expensive ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Probably cost more than all the Slytherins\rquote  brooms put togeth\-er,\rquote  said Ron happily.
\par \lquote Well ... who\rquote d send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even tell him they\rquote d sent it?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Who cares?\rquote  said Ron, impatiently. \lquote Listen, Harry, can I have a go on it? Can I?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think anyone should ride that broom just yet!\rquote  said Hermione shrilly.
\par Harry and Ron looked at her.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you think Harry\rquote s going to do with it \endash  sweep the floor?\rquote  said Ron.
\par But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus\rquote s bed, right at Ron\rquote s chest.
\par \lquote GET \endash  HIM \endash  OUT \endash  OF \endash  HERE!\rquote  Ron bellowed, as Crookshanks\rquote s claws ripped his pyjamas a
nd Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder. Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at Crookshanks which hit the trunk at the end of Harry\rquote s bed, knocking it over and causing Ron to hop on the spot, howling with pain.

\par Crookshanks\rquote s fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tinny whistling was filling the room. The Pocket Sneakoscope had become dislodged from Uncle Vernon\rquote s old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor.
\par \lquote I forgot about that!\rquote  Harry said, bending down and picking up the Sneakoscope. \lquote I never wear those socks if I can help it ...\rquote 
\par The Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm. Crookshanks was hissing and spitting at it.
\par \lquote You\rquote d better take that cat out of here, Hermione,\rquote  said Ron furi\-ously; he was sitting on Harry\rquote s bed nursing his toe. \lquote Can\rquote t you shut that thing up?\rquote 
 he added to Harry, as Hermione strode out of the room, Crookshanks\rquote s yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron.
\par Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk. All that could be heard now was Ron\rquote s sti\-fled moans of pain and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron\rquote 
s hands. It had been a while since Harry had seen him out of Ron\rquote s pocket, and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny; patches of fur seemed to have fallen out, too.
\par \lquote He\rquote s not looking too good, is he?\rquote  Harry said.
\par \lquote It\rquote s stress!\rquote  said Ron. \lquote He\rquote d be fine if that stupid great furball left him alone!\rquote 
\par But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had said about rats only living three years, couldn\rquote t help feeling that unless Scabbers had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching the end of his life. And despite Ron\rquote 
s frequent complaints that Scabbers was both boring and useless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if Scabbers died.
\par Christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the Gryffindor common room that morning. Hermione had shut Crookshanks in her dormitory, but was furious with Ron for try\-ing to kick him; Ron was still fuming about Crookshanks\rquote 
s fresh attempt to eat Scabbers. Harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other, and devoted himself to examining the Firebolt, which he had brought down to the common room with him. For some reason this seemed to annoy Hermione as well; she didn
\rquote t say anything, but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it, too, had been criticising her cat.
\par At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find
 that the house tables had been moved against the walls again, and that a single table, set for twelve, stood in the middle of the room. Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Sprout and Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the caretaker, who had tak
en off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather mouldy-looking tail coat. There were only three other students: two extremely nervous-looking first-years and a sullen-faced Slytherin fifth-year.
\par \lquote Merry Christmas!\rquote  said Dumbledore, as Harry, Ron and Hermione approached the table. As there are so few of us, it seemed foolish to use the house tables ... sit down, sit down!\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table.
\par \lquote Crackers!\rquote  said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering the end of a large silver one to Snape, who took it reluctantly and tugged. With a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large, pointed witch\rquote 
s hat topped with a stuffed vulture.
\par Harry, remembering the Boggart, caught Ron\rquote s eye and they both grinned; Snape\rquote s mouth thinned and he pushed the hat towards Dumbledore, who swapped it for his wizard\rquote s hat at once.
\par \lquote Tuck in!\rquote  he advised the table, beaming around.
\par As Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the doors of the Great Hall open
ed again. It was Professor Trelawney, gliding towards them as though on wheels. She had put on a green sequined dress in honour of the occasion, making her look more than ever like a glittering, oversize dragonfly.
\par \lquote Sybill, this is a pleasant surprise!\rquote  said Dumbledore, standing up.
\par \lquote I have been crystal-gazing, Headmaster,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, in her mistiest, most faraway voice, \lquote and to my aston\-ishment, I saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you. Who am I to refuse the promp
tings of fate? I at once hastened from my tower, and I do beg you to forgive my lateness ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Certainly, certainly,\rquote  said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. \lquote Let me draw you up a chair \endash \rquote 
\par And he did indeed draw a chair in mid-air with his wand, which revolve
d for a few seconds before falling with a thud between Professors Snape and McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did not sit down; her enormous eyes had been roving around the table, and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream.
\par \lquote I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen! Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die!\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote ll risk it, Sybill,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall impatiently. \lquote Do sit down, the turkey\rquote s getting stone cold.\rquote 
\par Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the empty chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table. Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen.
\par \lquote Tripe, Sybill?\rquote 
\par Professor Trelawney ignored her. Eyes open again, she looked around once more and said, \lquote But where is dear Professor Lupin?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m afraid the poor fellow is ill again,\rquote  said Dumbledore, indi\-cating that everybody should start serving themselves. \lquote Most unfortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day.\rquote 
\par \lquote But surely you already knew that, Sybill?\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, her eyebrows raised.
\par Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look.
\par \lquote Certainly I knew, Minerva,\rquote  she said quietly. \lquote But one does not parade the fact that one is All-Knowing. I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.\rquote 
\par \lquote That explains a great deal,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall tartly.
\par Professor Trelawney\rquote s voice suddenly became a good deal less misty.
\par \lquote If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal-gaze for him \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Imagine that,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall drily.
\par \lquote I doubt,\rquote  said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice, which put an end to Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney\rquote s conversation, \lquote that Professor Lupin is in any immedi\-ate danger. Severus, you\rquote 
ve made the Potion for him again?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Headmaster,\rquote  said Snape.
\par \lquote Good,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Then he should be up and about in no time ... Derek, have you had any of these chipolatas? They\rquote re excellent.\rquote 
\par The first-year boy went furiously red on being addressed directly by Dumbledore, and took the platter of sausages with trembling hands.
\par Professor Trelawney behaved almost normally until the very end of Christmas dinner, two hours later. Full to bursting with Christmas dinner and still wearing their cracker hats, Harry and Ron got up first from the table and she shrieked loudly.
\par \lquote My dears! Which of you left his seat first? Which?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dunno,\rquote  said Ron, looking uneasily at Harry.
\par \lquote I doubt it will make much difference,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall coldly, \lquote unless a mad axe-man is waiting outside the doors to slaughter the first into the Entrance Hall.\rquote 
\par Even Ron laughed. Professor Trelawney looked highly affronted.
\par \lquote Coming?\rquote  Harry said to Hermione.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  Hermione muttered. \lquote I want a quick word with Professor McGonagall.\rquote 
\par \lquote Probably trying to see if she can take any more classes,\rquote  yawned Ron as they made their way into the Entrance Hall, which was completely devoid of mad axe-men.
\par When they reached the portrait hole they found Sir Cadogan enjoying a Christmas party with a couple of monks, several previ\-ous Headmasters of Hogwarts and his fat pony. He pushed up his visor and toasted them with a flagon of mead.
\par \lquote Merry \endash  hic \endash  Christmas! Password?\rquote 
\par \lquote Scurvy cur,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote And the same to you, sir!\rquote  roared Sir Cadogan, as the painting swung forward to admit them.
\par Harry went straight up to the dormitory, collected his Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione had given him for his birthday, brought them downstairs and tried to find something to do to the Firebol
t; however, there were no bent twigs to clip, and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it. He and Ron simply sat admiring it from every angle, until the portrait hole opened, and Hermione came in, accompanied by Professor McGonaga
ll.
\par Though Professor McGonagall was Head of Gryffindor house, Harry had only seen her in the common room once before, and that had been to make a very grave announcement. He and Ron stared at her, both holding the Firebolt. Hermione walked around them, sat

\par Harry and Ron looked around at Hermione. They could see her forehead reddening over the top of her book, which was upside-down.
\par \lquote May I?\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, but she didn\rquote t wait for an answer before pulling the Firebolt out of their hands. She exam\-ined it carefully from handle to twig-ends. \lquote 
Hmm. And there was no note at all, Potter? No card? No message of any kind?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry blankly.
\par \lquote I see ...\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote Well, I\rquote m afraid I will have to take this, Potter.\rquote 
\par \lquote W-what?\rquote  said Harry, scrambling to his feet. \lquote Why?\rquote 
\par \lquote It will need to be checked for jinxes,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote Of course, I\rquote m no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Strip it down?\rquote  repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad.
\par \lquote It shouldn\rquote t take more than a few weeks,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free.\rquote 
\par \lquote There\rquote s nothing wrong with it!\rquote  said Harry, his voice shaking slightly. \lquote Honestly, Professor \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You can\rquote t know that, Potter,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly, \lquote not until you\rquote ve flown it, at any rate, and I\rquote m afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tam\-
pered with. I shall keep you informed.\rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Firebolt out of the portrait hole, which closed behind her. Harry stood staring after her, the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron, however, rounded on Hermione.

down of a brand-new Firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage. Hermione, who remained convinced that she had acted for the best, started avoiding the common room. Harry and Ron supposed she had taken refuge in the library, and didn\rquote

\par \lquote Another Boggart,\rquote  said Lupin, stripping off his cloak. \lquote I\rquote ve been combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this one lurking inside Mr Filch\rquote s filing cabinet. It\rquote s the nearest we\rquote

\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn\rquote t apprehen\-sive at all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good sub\-stitute for a real Dementor.
\par \lquote So ...\rquote  Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indi\-cated that Harry should do the same. \lquote The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic, Harry \endash  well beyond Ordinary Wizarding L
evel. It is called the Patronus Charm.\rquote 
\par \lquote How does it work?\rquote  said Harry nervously.
\par \lquote Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus,\rquote  said Lupin, \lquote which is a kind of Anti-Dementor \endash  a guardian which acts as a shield between you and the Dementor.\rquote 
\par Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-sized figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, \lquote The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the Dementor feeds upon \endash 
 hope, happi\-ness, the desire to survive \endash  but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the Dementors can\rquote t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the Charm might be too advanced for you. Many quali\-
fied wizards have difficulty with it.\rquote 
\par \lquote What does a Patronus look like?\rquote  said Harry curiously.
\par \lquote Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.\rquote 
\par \lquote And how do you conjure it?\rquote 
\par \lquote With an incantation, which will work only if you are concen\-trating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory.\rquote 
\par Harry cast about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had happened to him at the Dursleys\rquote  was going to do. Finally, he settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the won\-derful, soaring sensation in his stomach.

\par \lquote Ready?\rquote  said Lupin, who looked as though he was doing this against his better judgement. \lquote Concentrating hard? All right \endash  go!\rquote 
\par He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the Dementor rose out of it; the room fell cold and dark \endash 
\par \lquote EXPECTO PATRONUM!\rquote  Harry bellowed. \lquote EXPECTO PATRONUM! EXPECTO PATRONUM!\rquote 
\par The screaming inside Harry\rquote s head had started again \endash 
 except this time, it sounded as though it was coming from a badly tuned radio. Softer and louder and softer again ... and he could still see the Dementor ... it had halted ... and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry\rquote 
s wand, to hover between him and the Dementor, and though Harry\rquote s legs felt like water, he was still on his feet ... though for how much longer, he wasn\rquote t sure ...
\par \lquote Riddikulus!\rquote  roared Lupin, springing forwards.
\par There was a loud crack, and Harry\rquote s cloudy Patronus vanished along with the Dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he\rquote 
d just run a mile, his legs shaking. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Professor Lupin forcing the Boggart back into the packing case with his wand; it had turned into a silvery orb again.
\par \lquote Excellent!\rquote  Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat. \lquote Excellent, Harry! That was definitely a start!\rquote 
\par \lquote Can we have another go? Just one more go?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not now,\rquote  said Lupin firmly. \lquote You\rquote ve had enough for one night. Here \endash \rquote 
\par He handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes\rquote  best chocolate.
\par \lquote Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same time next week?\rquote 
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate and watched Lupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disap\-pearance of the Dementor. A thought had just occurred to him.
\par \lquote Professor Lupin?\rquote  he said. \lquote If you knew my dad, you must\rquote ve known Sirius Black as well.\rquote 
\par Lupin turned very quickly.
\par \lquote What gives you that idea?\rquote  he said sharply.
\par \lquote Nothing \endash  I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts, too ...\rquote 
\par Lupin\rquote s face relaxed.
\par \lquote Yes, I knew him,\rquote  he said shortly. \lquote Or I thought I did. You\rquote d bet\-ter get off, Harry, it\rquote s getting late.\rquote 
\par Harry left the classroom, walked along the corridor and around a corner, then took a detour behind a suit of armour and sank down on its plinth to finish his chocolate, wishing he hadn\rquote t men\-
tioned Black, as Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then Harry\rquote s thoughts wandered back to his mother and father ...
\par He felt drained and strangely empty, even though he was so full of chocolate. Terrible though it was to hear his parents\rquote  last moments replayed inside his head, these were the only times Harry had heard their voices since he was a ver
y small child. But he\rquote d never be able to produce a proper Patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents again ...
\par \lquote They\rquote re dead,\rquote  he told himself sternly. \lquote They\rquote re dead, and listen\-ing to echoes of them won\rquote t bring them back. You\rquote d better get a grip on yourself if you want that Quidditch Cup.\rquote 
\par He stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth and headed back to Gryffindor Tower.

Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term. Slytherin won, though narrowly. According to Wood, this 
was good news for Gryffindor, who would take second place if they beat Ravenclaw too. He therefore increased the number of team practices to five a week. This meant that with Lupin\rquote 
s Anti-Dementor classes, which in themselves were more draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just one night a week to do all his homework. Even so, he wasn\rquote 
t showing the strain nearly as much as Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her. Every night, without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a
 corner of the common room, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts, Rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file upon file of extensive notes; she barely spoke to anybody, and snapped when she was interrupted.

 Ron muttered to Harry one evening, as Harry sat finishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry looked up. Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books.
\par \lquote Doing what?\rquote 
\par \lquote Getting to all her classes!\rquote  Ron said. \lquote I heard her talking to Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. They were going on about yesterday\rquote s lesson, but Hermione can\rquote t\rquote 
ve been there, because she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie McMillan told me she\rquote s never missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of them are at the same time as Divination, and she\rquote s never missed one of them, either!
\rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione\rquote s impossible timetable at the moment; he really needed to get on with Snape\rquote s essay. Two seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this time by Wood.
\par \lquote Bad news, Harry. I\rquote ve just been to see Professor McGonagall about the Firebolt. She \endash  er \endash  got a bit shirty with me. Told me I\rquote d got my priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about win\-
ning the Cup than I do about you staying alive. Just because I told her I didn\rquote t care if it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch on it first.\rquote  Wood shook his head in disbelief. \lquote 
Honestly, the way she was yelling at me ... you\rquote d think I\rquote d said something terri\-ble. Then I asked her how much longer she was going to keep it ...\rquote  He screwed up his face and imitated Professor McGonagall\rquote s severe voice, 
\lquote  \'93As long as necessary, Wood\'94 ... I reckon it\rquote s time you ordered a new broom, Harry. There\rquote s an order form at the back of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Which Broomstick

January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the bitterly cold weather. The match against Ravenclaw was draw\-ing nearer and nearer, but Harry still hadn\rquote 
t ordered a new broom. He was now asking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt after every Transfiguration lesson, Ron standing hope\-fully at his shoulder, Hermione rushing past with her face averted.

\rquote 
\par To make matters even worse, Harry\rquote s Anti-Dementor
 lessons were not going nearly as well as he had hoped. Several sessions on, he was able to produce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the Boggart-Dementor approached him, but his Patronus was too feeble to drive the Dementor away. All it did was ho
ver, like a semi-transparent cloud, draining Harry of energy as he fought to keep it there. Harry felt angry with himself, guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents\rquote  voices again.
\par \lquote You\rquote re expecting too much of yourself,\rquote  said Professor Lupin sternly, in their fourth week of practice. \lquote For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren\rquote 
t passing out any more, are you?\rquote 
\par \lquote I thought a Patronus would \endash  charge the Dementors down or something,\rquote  said Harry dispiritedly. \lquote Make them disappear \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote The true Patronus does do that,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote But you\rquote 
ve achieved a great deal in a very short space of time. If the Dementors put in an appearance at your next Quidditch match, you will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground.\rquote 
\par \lquote You said it\rquote s harder if there are loads of them,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote I have complete confidence in you,\rquote  said Lupin, smiling. \lquote Here \endash  you\rquote ve earned a drink. Something from the Three Broomsticks, you won\rquote t have tried it before \endash \rquote 
\par He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.
\par \lquote Butterbeer!\rquote  said Harry, without thinking. \lquote Yeah, I like that stuff!\rquote 
\par Lupin raised an eyebrow.
\par \lquote Oh \endash  Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade,\rquote  Harry lied quickly.
\par \lquote I see,\rquote  said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious. \lquote Well \endash  let\rquote s drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not that I\rquote m supposed to take sides, as a teacher ...\rquote  he added hastily.

\par They drank the Butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced some\-thing he\rquote d been wondering for a while.
\par \lquote What\rquote s under a Dementor\rquote s hood?\rquote 
\par Professor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully.
\par \lquote Hmmm ... well, the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us. You see, the Dementor only lowers its hood to use its last and worst weapon.\rquote 
\par \lquote What\rquote s that?\rquote 
\par \lquote They call it the Dementors\rquote  Kiss,\rquote  said Lupin, with a slightly twisted smile. \lquote It\rquote 
s what Dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and \endash  and suck out his soul.\rquote 
\par Harry accidentally spat out a bit of Butterbeer.
\par \lquote What \endash  they kill \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, no,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote Much worse than that. You can exist with\-out your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you\rquote ll have no sense of self any more, no memory, no ... anything. There\rquote 
s no chance at all of recovery. You\rquote ll just \endash  exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone for ever ... lost.\rquote 
\par Lupin drank a little more Butterbeer, then said, \lquote It\rquote s the fate that awaits Sirius Black. It was in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 this morning. The Ministry have given the Dementors permission to perform it if they find him.\rquote 
\par Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth. But then he thought of Black.
\par \lquote He deserves it,\rquote  he said suddenly.
\par \lquote You think so?\rquote  said Lupin lightly. \lquote Do you really think anyone deserves that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry defiantly. \lquote For ... for some things ...\rquote 
\par He would have liked to have told Lupin about the conversation he\rquote d overheard about Black in the Three Broomsticks, about Black betraying his mother and father, but it would have involved revealing that he\rquote 
d gone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew Lupin wouldn\rquote t be very impressed by that. So he finished his Butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and left the History of Magic class\-room.
\par Harry half wished that he hadn\rquote t asked what was under a Dementor\rquote s hood,
 the answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.
\par \lquote Do watch where you\rquote re going, Potter!\rquote 
\par \lquote Sorry, Professor \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room. Well, here it is, we\rquote ve done everything we could think of, and there doesn\rquote t seem to be anything wrong with it at all \endash  you\rquote 
ve got a very good friend somewhere, Potter ...\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as magnificent as ever.
\par \lquote I can have it back?\rquote  Harry said weakly. \lquote Seriously?\rquote 
\par \lquote Seriously,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. \lquote I daresay you\rquote ll need to get the feel of it before Saturday\rquote s match, won\rquote t you? And Potter \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 do }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 try and win, won\rquote t you? Or we\rquote 
ll be out of the running for the eighth year in a row, as Professor Snape was kind enough to remind me only last night ...\rquote 
\par Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs towards Gryffindor Tower. As he turned a corner, he saw Ron dashing towards him, grinning from ear to ear.
\par \lquote She gave it to you? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it? Tomorrow?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... anything ...\rquote  said Harry, his heart lighter than it had been in a month. \lquote You know what \endash  we should make it up with Hermione. She was only trying to help ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, all right,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote She\rquote s in the common room now \endash  working, for a change.\rquote 
\par They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw Neville Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan, who seemed to be refusing him entrance.
\par \lquote I wrote them down,\rquote  Neville was saying tearfully, \lquote but I must\rquote ve dropped them somewhere!\rquote 
\par \lquote A likely tale!\rquote  roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting Harry and Ron, \lquote Good even, my fine young yeomen! Come clap this loon in irons, he is trying to force entry to the chambers within!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, shut up,\rquote  said Ron, as he and Harry drew level with Neville.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve lost the passwords!\rquote  Neville told them miserably. \lquote I made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week, because he keeps changing them, and now I don\rquote t know what I\rquote ve done with them!\rquote 

\par \lquote Oddsbodikins,\rquote  said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forwards to let them into the common room. There was a sudden, excited mur\-mur as every head turned and the next moment, Harry was sur\-
rounded by people exclaiming over his Firebolt.
\par \lquote Where\rquote d you get it, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Will you let me have a go?\rquote 
\par \lquote Have you ridden it yet, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ravenclaw\rquote ll have no chance, they\rquote re all on Cleansweep Sevens!\rquote 
\par \lquote Can I just }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 hold }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 it, Harry?\rquote 
\par After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was passed around and admired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and Harry and Ron had a clear view of Hermione, the only person who hadn\rquote t rushed over to them, bent over her work, and careful\-
ly avoiding their eyes. Harry and Ron approached her table and at last, she looked up.
\par \lquote I got it back,\rquote  said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the Firebolt.
\par \lquote See, Hermione? There wasn\rquote t anything wrong with it!\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Well \endash  there }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 might }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 have been!\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote 
I mean, at least you know now that it\rquote s safe!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I suppose so,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I\rquote d better put it upstairs \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll take it!\rquote  said Ron eagerly. \lquote I\rquote ve got to give Scabbers his Rat Tonic.\rquote 
\par He took the Firebolt, and, holding it as if it were made of glass, carried it away up the boys\rquote  staircase.
\par \lquote Can I sit down, then?\rquote  Harry asked Hermione.
\par \lquote I suppose so,\rquote  said Hermione, moving a great stack of parch\-ment off a chair.
\par Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay (\lquote Explain why Muggles Need Electricity\rquote ) and at the Rune translation Hermione was now por
\-ing over.
\par \lquote How are you getting through all this stuff?\rquote  Harry asked her.
\par \lquote Oh, well \endash  you know \endash  working hard,\rquote  said Hermione. Close to, Harry saw that she looked almost as tired as Lupin.
\par \lquote Why don\rquote t you just drop a couple of subjects?\rquote  Harry asked, watching her lifting books as she searched for her Rune dictio\-nary.
\par \lquote I couldn\rquote t do that!\rquote  said Hermione, looking scandalised.
\par \lquote Arithmancy looks terrible,\rquote  said Harry, picking up a very com\-plicated-looking number chart.
\par \lquote Oh, no, it\rquote s wonderful!\rquote  said Hermione earnestly. \lquote It\rquote s my favourite subject! It\rquote s \endash \rquote 
\par But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never found out. At that precise moment, a strangled yell echoed down the boys\rquote  staircase. The whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at the entrance. There came hu
rried footsteps, growing louder and louder \endash  and then, Ron came leaping into view, drag\-ging with him a bedsheet.
\par \lquote LOOK!\rquote  he bellowed, striding over to Hermione\rquote s table. \lquote LOOK!\rquote  he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face.
\par \lquote Ron, what \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!\rquote 
\par Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewil\-dered. Harry looked down at the sheet Ron was holding. There was something red on it. Something that looked horribly like \endash 
\par \lquote BLOOD!\rquote  Ron yelled into the stunned silence. \lquote HE\rquote S GONE! AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?\rquote 
\par \lquote N-no,\rquote  said Hermione, in a trembling voice.
\par Ron threw something down onto Hermione\rquote s Rune translation. Hermione and Harry leant forward. Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were several long, ginger cat hairs.

that Ron had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron\rquote s head in the Magical Menagerie.

\par Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she lost her temper with Harry, too.

\par In a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry persuaded him to come along to the Gryffindor team\rquote s final practice before the Ravenclaw match, so that he could have a go on the Firebolt after they\rquote d finished. This did seem to take Ron
\rquote s mind off Scabbers for a moment (\lquote Brilliant! Can I try and shoot a few goals on it?\rquote ) so they set off for the Quidditch pitch together.
\par Madam Hooch, who was still overseeing Gryffindor practices to keep an eye on Harry, was just as impressed with the Firebolt as everyone else had been. She took it in her hands before take-off and gave them the benefit of her professional opinion.

\par She and Ron left the pitch to sit in the stadium, and the Gryffindor team gathered around Wood for his final instructions for tomorrow\rquote s match.
\par \lquote Harry, I\rquote ve just found out who Ravenclaw are playing as Seeker. It\rquote s Cho Chang. She\rquote s a fourth-year, and she\rquote s pretty good ... I really hoped she wouldn\rquote t be fit, she\rquote s had some problems with injuries ...
\rquote  Wood scowled his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a full recovery, then said, \lquote On the other hand, she rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke next to the Firebolt.\rquote  He gave Harry\rquote 
s broom a look of fervent admiration, then said, \lquote OK, everyone, let\rquote s go \endash \rquote 
\par And at long last, Harry mounted his Firebolt, and kicked off from the ground.
\par It was better than he\rquote d ever dreamed. The Firebolt
 turned with the lightest touch; it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip. It sped across the pitch at such speed that the stadium turned into a green and grey blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia Spinnet screamed, then he went into a p
erfectly controlled dive, brushing the grassy pitch with his toes before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into the air again \endash 
\par \lquote Harry, I\rquote m letting the Snitch out!\rquote  Wood called.
\par Harry turned and raced a Bludger towards the goalposts; he outstripped it easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand.
\par The team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a minute\rquote s head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the others; he spotted it lurking near Katie Bell\rquote s knee, looped her eas\-ily, and caught it again.
\par It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence of the Firebolt in their midst, performed their best moves fault\-lessly, and by the time they hit the ground again, Wood didn\rquote 
t have a single criticism to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a first.
\par \lquote I can\rquote t see what\rquote s going to stop us tomorrow!\rquote  said Wood. \lquote Not unless \endash  Harry, you\rquote ve sorted your Dementor problem, haven\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus and wishing it was stronger.
\par \lquote The Dementors won\rquote t turn up again, Oliver, Dumbledore\rquote d do his nut,\rquote  said Fred confidently.
\par \lquote Well, let\rquote s hope not,\rquote  said Wood. \lquote Anyway \endash  good work, every\-one. Let\rquote s get back to the Tower \endash  turn in early ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m staying out for a bit, Ron wants a go on the Firebolt,\rquote  Harry told Wood, and while the rest of the team headed off to the chang\-ing rooms, Harry strode over to Ron, who
 vaulted the barrier to the stands and came to meet him. Madam Hooch had fallen asleep in her seat.
\par \lquote Here you go,\rquote  said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt.
\par Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness
 while Harry walked around the edge of the pitch, watching him. Night had fallen before Madam Hooch awoke with a start, told Harry and Ron off for not waking her, and insisted that they go back to the castle.
\par Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the shadowy stadium, discussing the Firebolt\rquote 
s superbly smooth action, its phenomenal acceleration and its pinpoint turning. They were halfway towards the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw something that made his heart turn over \endash  a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the darkness.

\par Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs.
\par \lquote What\rquote s the matter?\rquote  said Ron.
\par Harry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and muttered, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Lumos!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
\par A beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree and illuminated its branches; there, crouching amongst the bud\-ding leaves, was Crookshanks.
\par \lquote Get out of it!\rquote  Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass, but before he could do anything else, Crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail.
\par \lquote See?\rquote  Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again. \lquote She\rquote s still letting him wander about wherever he wants \endash  probably washing down Scabbers with a couple of birds now ...\rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t say anything. He took a deep breath as relief seeped through him; he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged to the Grim. They set off for the castle once more. Slightly ashamed of his moment of panic, Harry didn
\rquote t say anything to Ron \endash  nor did he look left or right until they had reached the well lit Entrance Hall.

Harry went down to breakfast next morning with the rest of the boys in his dormitory, all of whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honour. As Harry entered the Great Hall, heads turned in
 the direction of the Firebolt, and there was a good deal of excited muttering. Harry saw, with enormous satis\-faction, that the Slytherin team were all looking thunderstruck.

He can\rquote t believe it! This is brilliant!\rquote 
\par Wood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the Firebolt.
\par \lquote Put it here, Harry,\rquote  he said, laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upwards. People from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were soon com\-
ing over to look. Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his Nimbus, and Percy\rquote s Ravenclaw girlfriend, Penelope Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the Firebolt.
\par \lquote Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!\rquote  said Percy heartily, as she examined the Firebolt closely. \lquote Penelope and I have got a bet on,\rquote  he told the team. \lquote Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!\rquote 
\par Penelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry and went back to her table.
\par \lquote Harry \endash  make sure you win,\rquote  said Percy, in an urgent whisper. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote I haven\rquote t got ten Galleons. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Yes, I\rquote m coming, Penny!\rquote  And he bustled off to join her in a piece of toast.
\par \lquote Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?\rquote  said a cold, drawling voice.
\par Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Goyle right behind him.
\par \lquote Yeah, reckon so,\rquote  said Harry casually.
\par \lquote Got plenty of special features, hasn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Malfoy, eyes glit\-tering maliciously. \lquote Shame it doesn\rquote t come with a parachute \endash  in case you get too near a Dementor.\rquote 
\par Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.
\par \lquote Pity you can\rquote t attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,\rquote  said Harry. Then it could catch the Snitch for you.\rquote 
\par The Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy\rquote s pale eyes nar\-rowed, and he stalked away. They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team, who put their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether Harry\rquote s broom really was a Firebolt.

\par At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the changing rooms. The weather couldn\rquote 
t have been more different from their match against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day, with a very light breeze; there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch 
match could bring. They could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond. Harry took off his black school robes, removed his wand from his pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes. He only hope
d he wouldn\rquote t need it. He wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd, watching.
\par \lquote You know what we\rquote ve got to do,\rquote  said Wood, as they prepared to leave the changing rooms. \lquote If we lose this match, we\rquote re out of the running. Just \endash  just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we\rquote 
ll be OK!\rquote 
\par They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous applause. The Ravenclaw team, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the pitch. Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl in their team. She was
 shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn\rquote 
t help noticing, nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight jolt in the region of his stomach that he didn\rquote t think had anything to do with nerves.

\par \lquote Wood, Davies, shake hands,\rquote  Madam Hooch said briskly, and Wood shook hands with the Ravenclaw captain.
\par \lquote Mount your brooms ... on my whistle ... three \endash  two \endash  one \endash \rquote 
\par Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom; he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which was being provided by the Weasley twins
\rquote  friend, Lee Jordan.
\par \lquote They\rquote re off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt which Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Which Broomstick, }{

\par \lquote Jordan, would you mind telling us what\rquote s going on in the match?\rquote  interrupted Professor McGonagall\rquote s voice.
\par \lquote Right you are, Professor \endash  just giving a bit of background infor\-mation. The Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Jordan!\rquote 
\par \lquote OK, OK, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor heading for goal ...\rquote 
\par Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely. She was undoubtedly a very good flier \endash  she kept cut\-ting across him, forcing him to change direction.

\par \lquote Show her your acceleration, Harry!\rquote  Fred yelled, as he whooshed past in pursuit of a Bludger that was aiming for Alicia.
\par Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goalposts and Cho fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the pitch went wild, he saw it \endash 
 the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of the barriers.
\par Harry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore after him. Harry was speeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were his speciality. He was ten feet away \endash 
\par Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelt\-ing out of nowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those few, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished.
\par There was a great \lquote Ooooooh\rquote  of disappointment from the Gryffindor supporters, but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end. George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger directly at the offending Beat
er, who was forced to roll right over in mid-air to avoid it.
\par \lquote Gryffindor lead by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt go! Potter\rquote s really putting it through its paces now. See it turn \endash  Chang\rquote s Comet is just no match for it. The Firebolt\rquote s pre
cision-balance is really noticeable in these long \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIRE\-BOLTS? GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY!\rquote 
\par Ravenclaw were pulling back; they had now scored three goals, which put Gryffindor only fifty points ahead \endash  if Cho got the Snitch before him, Ravenclaw would win. Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw Chaser, scanning the pitch franti
\-cally. A glint of gold, a flutter of tiny wings \endash  the Snitch was cir\-cling the Gryffindor goalpost ...
\par Harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead \endash  but next second, Cho had appeared out of thin air, blocking him \endash 
\par \lquote HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!\rquote  Wood roared, as Harry swerved to avoid a collision. \lquote KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!\rquote 
\par Harry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was grinning. The Snitch had vanished again. Harry turned his Firebolt upwards and was soon twenty feet above the game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cho following him ... she\rquote 
d decided to mark him rather than search for the Snitch herself. Right then ... if she wanted to tail him, she\rquote d have to take the consequences ...
\par He dived again, and Cho, thinking he\rquote d seen the Snitch, tried to follow. Harry pulled out of the dive very sharply, she hurtled downwards; he ros
e fast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time: the Snitch was glittering way above the pitch at the Ravenclaw end.
\par He accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was winning, gaining on the Snitch with every second \endash  then \endash 
\par \lquote Oh!\rquote  screamed Cho, pointing.
\par Distracted, Harry looked down.
\par Three Dementors, three tall, black, hooded Dementors, were looking up at him.
\par He didn\rquote t stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he whipped out his wand and roared, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Expecto patronum!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
\par Something silver white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wand. He knew it had shot directly at the Dementors but didn\rquote t pause to watch; his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead \endash 
 he was nearly there. He stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small, struggling Snitch.
\par Madam Hooch\rquote s whistle sounded, Harry turned around in mid\-air and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on him. Next moment, the whole team were hugging him so hard he w
as nearly pulled off his broom. Down below he could hear the roars of the Gryffindors in the crowd.
\par \lquote That\rquote s my boy!\rquote  Wood kept yelling. Alicia, Angelina and Katie had all kissed Harry, and Fred had him in a grip so tight Harry felt as though his head would
 come off. In complete disarray, the team managed to make its way back to the ground. Harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the pitch, Ron in the lead. Before he knew it, he had been engulfed by the 
cheering crowd.
\par \lquote Yes!\rquote  Ron yelled, yanking Harry\rquote s arm into the air. \lquote Yes! Yes!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 done, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Harry!\rquote  said Percy, looking delighted. \lquote 
Ten Galleons to me! Must find Penelope, excuse me \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Good on you, Harry!\rquote  roared Seamus Finnigan.
\par \lquote Ruddy brilliant!\rquote  boomed Hagrid over the heads of the milling Gryffindors.
\par \lquote That was quite some Patronus,\rquote  said a voice in Harry\rquote s ear.
\par Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who looked both shaken and pleased.
\par \lquote The Dementors didn\rquote t affect me at all!\rquote  Harry said excitedly. \lquote I didn\rquote t feel a thing!\rquote 
\par \lquote That would be because they \endash  er \endash  weren\rquote t Dementors,\rquote  said Professor Lupin. \lquote Come and see \endash \rquote 
\par He led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the pitch.
\par \lquote You gave Mr Malfoy quite a fright,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team cap\-tain, all struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It looked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle
\rquote s shoulders. Standing over them, with an expression of the utmost fury on her face, was Professor McGonagall.
\par \lquote An unworthy trick!\rquote  she was shouting. \lquote A low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty points from Slytherin! 
I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about this, make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now!\rquote 
\par If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor\rquote s victory, it was this. Ron, who had fought his way through to Harry\rquote s side, doubled up with laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe, Goyle\rquote 
s head still stuck inside it.
\par \lquote Come on, Harry!\rquote  said George, fighting his way over. \lquote Party! Gryffindor common room, now!\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry, and feeling happier than he had done in ages, he and the rest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of the stadium and back up to the castle.

It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup; the party went on all day and well into the night. Fred and George Weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with arm\-

\par \lquote With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs,\rquote  Fred muttered in Harry\rquote s ear.

\par \lquote Did you even come to the match?\rquote  he asked her.
\par \lquote Of course I did,\rquote  said Hermione, in a strangely high-pitched voice, not looking up. \lquote And I\rquote m very glad we won, and I think you did really well, but I need to read this by Monday.\rquote

\par \lquote Can\rquote t you give her a break?\rquote  Harry asked Ron quietly.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Ron flatly. \lquote If she just acted like she was sorry \endash  but she\rquote ll never admit she\rquote s wrong, Hermione. She\rquote s still acting like Scabbers has gone on holiday or something.\rquote 
\par The Gryffindor party only ended when Professor McGonagall
 turned up in her tartan dressing-gown and hair-net at one in the morning, to insist that they all went to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory, still discussing the match. At last, exhausted, Harry climbed into bed, twitched the hangi
ngs of his four-poster shut to block out a ray of moonlight, lay back and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep ...
\par He had a very strange dream. He was walking through a forest, his Firebolt over his shoulder, following something silvery white
. It was winding its way through the trees ahead, and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up with it, he sped up, but as he moved faster, so did his quarry. Harry broke into a run and ahead, he heard hooves gathering sp
eed. Now he was running flat out, and ahead he could hear galloping. Then he turned a corner into a clearing and \endash

\par \lquote What\rquote s going on?\rquote 
\par Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam. At last find\-ing the divide in his curtains, he ripped them back, and at the same moment, Dean Thomas lit his lamp.

ty; Professor Flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognise a large picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors, boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the wal
ls to mouse holes. Sir Cadogan had been sacked. His portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat Lady was back. She had been expertly restored, but was still extremely nervous, and had only agreed to return to her j
ob on condition that she was given extra protection. A bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her. They paced the corridor in a menacing group, talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs.
\par Harry couldn\rquote t help noticing that the statue of the one-eyed witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked. It seemed that Fred and George had been right in thinking that they \endash  and now Harry, Ron and Hermione \endash 
 were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it.
\par \lquote D\rquote you reckon we should tell someone?\rquote  Harry asked Ron.
\par \lquote We know he\rquote s not coming in through Honeydukes,\rquote  said Ron dismissively. \lquote We\rquote d\rquote ve heard if the shop had been broken into.\rquote 
\par Harry was glad Ron took this view. If the one-eyed witch was boarded up too, he would never be able to go into Hogsmeade again.
\par Ron had become an instant celebrity. For the first time in his life, people were paying more attention to him than to Harry, and it was clear that Ron was rather enjoying the experience. Though still severely shaken by the night\rquote 
s events, he was happy to tell anyone who asked, what had happened, with a wealth of detail.
\par \lquote ... I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was in my dream, you know? But then there was this draught ... I woke up and 
one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down ... I rolled over ... and I saw him standing over me ... like a skeleton, with loads of filthy hair ... holding this great long knife, must\rquote 
ve been twelve inches ... and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and then I yelled, and he scarpered.
\par \lquote Why, though?\rquote  Ron added to Harry, as the group of second-year girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed. \lquote Why did he scarper?\rquote 
\par Harry had been wondering the same thing. Why had Black, having got the wrong bed, not silenced Ron and proceeded to Harry? Black had proved twelve years ago that he didn\rquote 
t mind murdering innocent people, and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep.
\par \lquote He must\rquote ve known he\rquote d have a job getting back out of the cas\-tle once you\rquote d yelled and woken people up,\rquote  said Harry thought\-fully. \lquote He\rquote d\rquote 
ve had to kill the whole house to get back through the portrait hole ... then he would\rquote ve met the teachers ...\rquote 
\par Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furi\-ous with him she had banned him from all future Hogsmeade vis\-
its, given him a detention and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the Tower. Poor Neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let
 him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him. None of these pun\-ishments, however, came close to matching the one his grand\-mother had in store for him. Two days after Black\rquote 
s break-in, she sent Neville the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive over breakfast \endash  a Howler.
\par The school owls swooped into the Great Hall, carrying the post as usual, and Neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him, a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak. Harry and Ron, who were sitting opp
osite him, recognised the letter as a Howler at once \endash  Ron had got one from his mother the year before.
\par \lquote Run for it, Neville,\rquote  Ron advised.
\par Neville didn\rquote t need telling twice. He seized the envelope and, holding it before him like a bomb, sprinted out of the Hall, while the Slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him. They heard the Howler go off in the Entrance Hall 
\endash  Neville\rquote s grandmother\rquote s voice, magically magnified to a hundred times its usual volume, shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole family.
\par Harry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice immedi\-ately that he had a letter, too. Hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist.
\par \lquote Ouch! Oh \endash  thanks, Hedwig ...\rquote

curity trolls at a run, and headed down to the Entrance Hall.
\par Hagrid was already waiting for them.
\par \lquote All right, Hagrid!\rquote  said Ron. \lquote S\rquote pose you want to hear about Saturday night, do you?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve already heard all abou\rquote  it,\rquote  said Hagrid, opening the front doors and leading them outside.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Ron, looking slightly put out.
\par The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid\rquote s cabin was Buckbeak, who was stretched out on top of Hagrid\rquote s patchwork quilt, his enormous wings folded tight to his body, enjoying a large 
plate of dead ferrets. Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow and orange tie hanging from the top of Hagrid\rquote s wardrobe door.
\par \lquote What are they for, Hagrid?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Buckbeak\rquote s case against the Committee fer the Disposal o\rquote  Dangerous Creatures,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote This Friday. Him an\rquote  me\rquote ll be goin\rquote  down ter London together. I\rquote 
ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus ...\rquote 
\par Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely forgotten that Buckbeak\rquote s trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on Ron\rquote s face, he had, too. They had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare Buckbeak\rquote 
s defence; the arrival of the Firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds.
\par Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns, but they knew better than to accept; they had had too much expe\-rience of Hagrid\rquote s cooking.
\par \lquote I got somethin\rquote  ter discuss with you two,\rquote  said Hagrid, sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Hermione,\rquote  said Hagrid.
\par \lquote What about her?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote She\rquote s in a righ\rquote  state, that\rquote s what. She\rquote s bin comin\rquote  down ter visit me a lot since Chris\rquote mas. Bin feelin\rquote  lonely. Firs\rquote  yeh weren\rquote  talk\-ing to her because o\rquote

\par \lquote \endash  ate Scabbers!\rquote  Ron interjected angrily.
\par \lquote Because her cat acted like all cats do,\rquote  Hagrid continued doggedly. \lquote She\rquote s cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin\rquote  through a rough time at the moment. Bitten off more\rquote 
n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work she\rquote s tryin\rquote  ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak\rquote s case, mind ... she\rquote s found some really good stuff fer me ... reckon he\rquote ll stand a good chance now ...\rquote 

\par \lquote Hagrid, we should\rquote ve helped as well \endash  sorry \endash \rquote  Harry began awkwardly.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not blamin\rquote  yeh!\rquote  said Hagrid, waving Harry\rquote s apology aside. \lquote Gawd knows yeh\rquote ve had enough ter be gettin\rquote  on with, I\rquote ve seen yeh practisin\rquote  Quidditch ev\rquote ry hour o\rquote 
 the day an\rquote  night \endash  but I gotta tell yeh, I thought you two\rquote d value yer friend more\rquote n broomsticks or rats. Tha\rquote s all.\rquote 
\par Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks.
\par \lquote Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. She\rquote s got her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an\rquote  you two not talkin\rquote  to her \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote If she\rquote d just get rid of that cat, I\rquote d speak to her again!\rquote  Ron said angrily. \lquote But she\rquote s still sticking up for it! It\rquote s a maniac, and she won\rquote t hear a word against it!\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou\rquote  their pets,\rquote  said Hagrid wisely. Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid\rquote s pillow.
\par They spent the rest of their visit discussing Gryffindor\rquote s improved chances for the Quidditch Cup. At nine o\rquote clock, Hagrid walked them back up to the castle.
\par A large group of people was bunched around the notice-board when they returned to the common room.
\par \lquote Hogsmeade, next weekend!\rquote  said Ron, craning over the heads to read the new notice. \lquote What d\rquote you reckon?\rquote  he added quietly to Harry, as they went to sit down.
\par \lquote Well, Filch hasn\rquote t done anything about the passage into Honeydukes ...\rquote  Harry said, even more quietly.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  said a voice in his right ear. Harry started and looked around at Hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hid\-ing her.
\par \lquote Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again ... I\rquote ll tell Professor McGonagall about that map!\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Can you hear someone talking, Harry?\rquote  growled Ron, not look\-ing at Hermione.
\par \lquote Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black nearly did to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 you! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote So now you\rquote re trying to get Harry expelled!\rquote  said Ron furiously. \lquote Haven\rquote t you done enough damage this year?\rquote 
\par Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks leapt onto her lap. Hermione took one frightened look at the expression on Ron\rquote s face, gathered Crookshanks up and hurried away towards the girls\rquote  dormitories.
\par \lquote So how about it?\rquote  Ron said to Harry, as though there had been no interruption. \lquote Come on, last time we went you didn\rquote t see any\-thing. You haven\rquote t even been inside Zonko\rquote s yet!\rquote 
\par Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot.

\par Neville broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry\rquote s shoulder.
\par It was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry.
\par \lquote And what are you two doing here?\rquote  said Snape, coming to a halt and looking from one to the other. An odd place to meet \endash \rquote 
\par To Harry\rquote s immense disquiet, Snape\rquote s black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch.
\par \lquote We\rquote re not \endash  meeting here,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote We just \endash  met here.\rquote 
\par \lquote Indeed?\rquote  said Snape. \lquote You have a habit of turning up in unex\-pected places, Potter, and you are rarely there for no reason ... I suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong.\rquote 
\par Harry and Neville set off without another word. As they turned the corner, Harry looked back. Snape was running one of his hands over the one-eyed witch\rquote s head, examining it closely.
\par Harry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by telling him the password, then pretending he\rquote d left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back. Once out of sight of the security trolls, he pulled 
out the map again and held it close to his nose.
\par The third-floor corridor seemed to be deserted. Harry scanned the map carefully and saw, with a leap of relief, that the tiny dot labelled \lquote Severus Snape\rquote  was now back in its office.
\par He sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her hump, heaved himself inside and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute. He wiped the Marauder\rquote s Map blank again, then set off at a run.

\par They set off up the High Street.
\par \lquote Where are you?\rquote  Ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth. \lquote Are you still there? This feels weird ...\rquote 
\par They went to the Post Office; Ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to Bill in Egypt so that Harry could have a good look around. The owls sat hooting softly down at him, at least three hundred of them;
 from Great Greys right down to tiny little Scops owls (\lquote Local Deliveries Only\rquote ) which were so small they could have sat in the palm of Harry\rquote s hand.
\par Then they visited Zonko\rquote s, which was so packed with students Harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic. There were jokes and tricks to fulfil even Fred and George\rquote 
s wildest dreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the Cloak. They left Zonko\rquote s with their money bags considerably lighter than they
 had been on entering, but their pockets bulging with Dungbombs, Hiccough Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap and a Nose-Biting Teacup apiece.
\par The day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt like stay\-ing indoors, so they walked past the Three Broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling in Britain. It stood a little way above the rest of the vil
\-lage, and even in daylight was slightly creepy, with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden.
\par \lquote Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,\rquote  said Ron, as they leaned on the fence, looking up at it. \lquote I asked Nearly Headless Nick ... he says he\rquote 
s heard a very rough crowd live here. No one can get in. Fred and George tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut ...\rquote 
\par Harry, fe
eling hot from their climb, was just considering taking off the Cloak for a few minutes, when they heard voices nearby. Someone was climbing towards the house from the other side of the hill; moments later, Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe 
and Goyle. Malfoy was speaking.
\par \lquote ... should have an owl from Father any time now. He had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm ... about how I couldn\rquote t use it for three months ...\rquote 
\par Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.
\par \lquote I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself ... \'93There\rquote s no \rquote arm in \rquote im, \rquote onest \endash \'94 ... that Hippogriff\rquote s as good as dead \endash \rquote 
\par Malfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face split in a malevolent grin.
\par \lquote What are you doing, Weasley?\rquote 
\par Malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron.
\par \lquote Suppose you\rquote d love to live here, wouldn\rquote t you, Weasley? Dreaming about having your own bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room \endash  is that true?\rquote 
\par Harry seized the back of Ron\rquote s robes to stop him leaping on Malfoy.
\par \lquote Leave him to me,\rquote  he hissed in Ron\rquote s ear.
\par The opportunity was too perfect to miss. Harry crept silently around behind Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle, bent down and scooped a large handful of mud out of the path.
\par \lquote We were just discussing your friend Hagrid,\rquote  Malfoy said to Ron. \lquote Just trying to imagine what he\rquote s saying to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. D\rquote you think he\rquote 
ll cry when they cut off his Hippogriff\rquote s \endash \rquote 
\par SPLAT!
\par Malfoy\rquote s head jerked forwards as the mud hit him; his silver-blond hair was suddenly dripping in muck.
\par \lquote What the \endash ?\rquote 
\par Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he was laughing so hard. Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring wildly around, Malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean.
\par \lquote What was that? Who did that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Very haunted up here, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  said Ron, with the air of one commenting on the weather.
\par Crabbe and Goyle were looking scared. Their bulging muscles were no use against ghosts. Malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscape.
\par Harry sneaked along the path, where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded some foul-smelling, green sludge.
\par SPLATTER!
\par Crabbe and Goyle caught some this time. Goyle hopped furi\-ously on the spot, trying to rub it out of his small, dull eyes.
\par \lquote It came from over there!\rquote  said Malfoy, wiping his face, and star\-ing at a spot some six feet to the left of Harry.
\par Crabbe blundered forwards, his long arms outstretched like a zombie. Harry dodged around him, picked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe\rquote s back. Harry doubled up with
 silent laughter as Crabbe did a kind of pirouette in mid-air, trying to see who had thrown it. As Ron was the only person Crabbe could see, it was Ron he started towards, but Harry stuck out his leg. Crabbe stum\-bled \endash 
 and his huge, flat foot caught the hem of Harry\rquote s Cloak. Harry felt a great tug, then the Cloak slid off his face.
\par For a split second, Malfoy stared at him.
\par \lquote AAARGH!\rquote  he yelled, pointing at Harry\rquote s head. Then he turned tail and ran, at breakneck speed, back down the hill, Crabbe and Goyle behind him.
\par Harry tugged the Cloak up again, but the damage was done.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  Ron said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where Harry had disappeared, \lquote you\rquote d better run for it! If Malfoy tells anyone \endash  you\rquote d better get back to the castle, quick \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote See you later,\rquote  said Harry, and without another word, he tore back down the path towards Hogsmeade.
\par Would Malfoy believe what he had seen? Would anyone believe Malfoy? Nobody knew about the Invisibility Cloak \endash  nobody except Dumbledore. Harry\rquote s stomach turned over \endash 
 Dumbledore would know exactly what had happened, if Malfoy said anything \endash 
\par Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps, across the stone floor, through the trapdoor \endash  Harry pulled off the Cloak, tucked it under his arm, and ran,
 flat out, along the passage ... Malfoy would get back first ... how long would it take him to find a teacher? Panting, a sharp pain in his side, Harry didn\rquote 
t slow down until he reached the stone slide. He would have to leave the Cloak where it was, it was
 too much of a giveaway if Malfoy had tipped off a teacher. He hid it in a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast as he could, his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute. He reached the inside of the witch\rquote 
s hump, tapped it with his wand, stuck his head through and hoisted himself out; the hump closed, and just as Harry jumped out from behind the statue, he heard quick footsteps approaching.
\par It was Snape. He approached Harry at a swift walk, his black robes swishing, then stopped in front of him.
\par \lquote So,\rquote  he said.
\par There was a look of suppressed triumph about him. Harry tried to look innocent, all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands, which he quickly hid in his pockets.
\par \lquote Come with me, Potter,\rquote  said Snape.
\par Harry followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his hands clean on the inside of his robes without Snape noticing. They walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into Snape\rquote s office.
\par Harry had only been in here once before, and he had been in very serious trouble then, too. Snape h
ad acquired a few more horrible slimy things in jars since last time, all standing on shelves behind his desk, glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere.
\par \lquote Sit,\rquote  said Snape.
\par Harry sat. Snape, however, remained standing.
\par \lquote Mr Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,\rquote  said Snape.
\par Harry didn\rquote t say anything.
\par \lquote He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran into Weasley \endash  apparently alone.\rquote 
\par Still, Harry didn\rquote t speak.
\par \lquote Mr Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley, when a large amount of mud hit him on the back of the head. How do you think that could have happened?\rquote 
\par Harry tried to look mildly surprised.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know, Professor.\rquote 
\par Snape\rquote s eyes were boring into Harry\rquote s. It was exactly like trying to stare out a Hippogriff. Harry tried hard not to blink.
\par \lquote Mr Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you imagine what it might have been, Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious.
\par \lquote It was your head, Potter. Floating in mid-air.\rquote 
\par There was a long silence.
\par \lquote Maybe he\rquote d better go to Madam Pomfrey,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote If he\rquote s seeing things like \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?\rquote  said Snape softly. \lquote Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has permission to be in Hogsmeade.\rquote 
\par \lquote I know that,\rquote  said Harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear. \lquote It sounds like Malfoy\rquote s having hallucin\emdash \rquote 
\par \lquote Malfoy is not having hallucinations,\rquote  snarled Snape, and he bent down, a hand on each arm of Harry\rquote s chair, so that their faces were a foot apart. \lquote If your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve been up in Gryffindor Tower,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Like you told \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Can anyone confirm that?\rquote 
\par Harry didn\rquote t say anything. Snape\rquote s thin mouth curled into a horrible smile.
\par \lquote So,\rquote  he said, straightening up again. \lquote Everyone from the Minister for Magic downwards has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law unto him
self. Let the ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where he wants to, with no thought for the consequences.\rquote 
\par Harry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth. He wasn\rquote t going to do it. Snape had no proof \endash  yet.
\par \lquote How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,\rquote  Snape said suddenly, his eyes glinting. \lquote He, too, was exceedingly arro\-
gant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch pitch made him think he was a cut above the rest of us, too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers ... the resemblance between you is uncanny.\rquote 
\par \lquote My dad didn\rquote t }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 strut,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
said Harry, before he could stop himself. \lquote And nor do I.\rquote 
\par \lquote Your father didn\rquote t set much store by rules, either,\rquote  Snape went on, pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. \lquote Rules were for lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote SHUT UP!\rquote 
\par Harry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had not felt since his last night in Privet Drive was thundering through him. He didn\rquote t care that Snape\rquote s face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing dangerously.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote What did you say to me, Potter?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196

\par Snape\rquote s sallow skin had gone the colour of sour milk.
\par \lquote And did the Headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life?\rquote  he whispered. \lquote Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious Potter\rquote s delicate ears?\rquote 
\par Harry bit his lip. He didn\rquote t know what had happened and didn\rquote t want to admit it \endash  but Snape seemed to have guessed the truth.
\par \lquote I would hate you to run away with a false idea of your father, Potter,\rquote  he said, a terrible grin twisting his face. \lquote Have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism? Then let me correct you \endash 
 your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadn\rquote t got cold feet at the last m
oment. There was nothing brave about what he did. He was saving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he would have been expelled from Hogwarts.\rquote 
\par Snape\rquote s uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.
\par \lquote Turn out your pockets, Potter!\rquote  he spat suddenly.
\par Harry didn\rquote t move. There was a pounding in his ears.
\par \lquote Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the Headmaster! Pull them out, Potter!\rquote 
\par Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko\rquote s tricks and the Marauder\rquote s Map.
\par Snape picked up the Zonko\rquote s bag.
\par \lquote Ron gave them to me,\rquote  said Harry, praying he\rquote d get a chance to tip Ron off before Snape saw him. \lquote He \endash  brought them back from Hogsmeade last time \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Indeed? And you\rquote ve been carrying them round ever since? How very touching ... and what is this?\rquote 
\par Snape had picked up the map. Harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive.

\par His hand moved towards the fire.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  Harry said quickly.

 instructions to get into Hogsmeade without passing the Dementors?\rquote 
\par Harry blinked. Snape\rquote s eyes gleamed.
\par \lquote Let me see, let me see ...\rquote  he muttered, taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk. \lquote Reveal your secret!\rquote  he said, touching the wand to the parchment.
\par Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop them shaking.
\par \lquote Show yourself!\rquote  Snape said, tapping the map sharply.
\par It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming breaths.
\par \lquote Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield the information you conceal!\rquote  Snape said, hitting the map with his wand.
\par As though an invisible hand was writing upon it, words appeared on the smooth surface of the map.

\par \lquote Lupin!\rquote  Snape called into the fire. \lquote I want a word!\rquote 
\par Utterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large shape had appeared in it, revolving very fast. Seconds later, Professor Lupin was clambering out of the fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes.
\par \lquote You called, Severus?\rquote  said Lupin mildly.
\par \lquote I certainly did,\rquote  said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk. \lquote I have just asked Potter to empty his pockets. He was carrying this.\rquote 
\par Snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were still shining. An odd, closed expression appeared on Lupin\rquote s face.
\par \lquote Well?\rquote  said Snape.

\par \lquote Full of Dark Magic?\rquote  he repeated mildly. \lquote Do you really think so, Severus? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parch\-

Harry, Ron, come with me, I need a word about my vam\-pire essay. Excuse us, Severus.\rquote

\par \lquote Professor, I \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t want to hear explanations,\rquote  said Lupin shortly. He glanced around the empty Entrance Hall and lowered his voice. \lquote I happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr Filch many years ago. Yes, I know it\rquote

\par \lquote Why did Snape think I\rquote d got it from the manufacturers?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because ...\rquote  Lupin hesitated, \lquote because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school. They\rquote d think it extremely entertaining.\rquote

\par \lquote Don\rquote t expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you take Sirius Black seriously. But I would have thought that what you have heard when the Dementors draw near you would 
have had more of an effect on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poor way to repay them \endash  gam\-bling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks.\rquote 
\par He walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in Snape\rquote s office. Slowly, he and Ron mounted the marble staircase. As Harry passed the one-eyed witch, he remem\-bered the Invisibility Cloak \endash 
 it was still down there, but he didn\rquote t dare go and get it.

\par He broke off; they had reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing, and Hermione was walking towards them. One look at her face convinced Harry that she had heard what had happened. His heart plummeted \endash 
 had she told Professor McGonagall?
\par \lquote Come to have a good gloat?\rquote  said Ron savagely, as she stopped in front of them. \lquote Or have you just been to tell on us?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Hermione. She was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling. \lquote I just thought you ought to know ... Hagrid lost his case. Buckbeak is going to be executed.\rquote

\par They hurried up the marble staircase towards Professor Flitwick\rquote s classroom.
\par \lquote You\rquote re late, boys!\rquote  said Professor Flitwick reprovingly, as Harry opened the classroom door. \lquote Come along, quickly, wands out, we\rquote re experimenting with Cheering Charms today. We\rquote ve already divided into pairs

\par Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags. Ron looked behind him.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Hermione gone?\rquote 
\par Harry looked around, too. Hermione hadn\rquote t entered the class\-room, yet Harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door.
\par \lquote That\rquote s weird,\rquote  said Harry, staring at Ron. \lquote Maybe \endash  maybe she went to the bathroom or something?\rquote 
\par But Hermione didn\rquote t turn up all lesson.
\par \lquote She could\rquote ve done with a Cheering Charm on her, too,\rquote  said Ron, as the class left for lunch, all grinning broadly \endash  the Cheering Charms had left them with a feeling of great content\-ment.
\par Hermione wasn\rquote t at lunch either. By the time they had finished their apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off, and Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried.
\par \lquote You don\rquote t think Malfoy did something to her?\rquote  Ron said anx\-iously, as they hurried upstairs towards Gryffindor Tower.
\par They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password (\lquote Flibbertigibbet\rquote ) and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room.
\par Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on an open Arithmancy book. They went to sit down either side of her. Harry prodded her awake.
\par \lquote Wh-what?\rquote  said Hermione, waking with a start, and staring wild\-ly around. \lquote Is it time to go? W-which lesson have we got now?\rquote 
\par \lquote Divination, but it\rquote s not for another twenty minutes,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Hermione, why didn\rquote t you come to Charms?\rquote 
\par \lquote What? Oh no!\rquote  Hermione squeaked. \lquote I forgot to go to Charms!\rquote 
\par \lquote But how could you forget?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote You were with us till we were right outside the classroom!\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t believe it!\rquote  Hermione wailed. \lquote Was Professor Flitwick angry? Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!\rquote 
\par \lquote You know what, Hermione?\rquote  said Ron, looking down at the enormous Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. \lquote I reckon you\rquote re cracking up. You\rquote re trying to do too much.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I\rquote m not!\rquote  said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag. \lquote I just made a mistake, that\rquote s all! I\rquote d better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry ... I\rquote 
ll see you in Divination!\rquote 
\par Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawney\rquote s classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harassed.
\par \lquote I can\rquote t believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our exams. Professor Flitwick hinted they might!\rquote 
\par Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room. Glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white mist. Harry, Ron and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety table.
\par \lquote I thought we weren\rquote t starting crystal balls until next term,\rquote  Ron muttered, casting a wary eye around for Professor Trelawney, in case she was lurking nearby.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t complain, this means we\rquote ve finished palmistry,\rquote  Harry muttered back. \lquote I was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my hands.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good day to you!\rquote  said the familiar, misty voice, and Professor Trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows. Parvati and Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky glow of their crystal ball.
\par \lquote I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned,\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, seating herself with her back to the fire and gazing around. \lquote 
The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice.\rquote 
\par Hermione snorted.
\par \lquote Well, honestly ... \'93the fates have informed her\'94 ... who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing prediction!\rquote  she said, not troub\-ling to keep her voice low.
\par It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them, as her face was hidden in shadow. She continued, however, as though she had not.
\par \lquote Crystal-gazing is a particularly refined art,\rquote  she said dreamily. \lquote I do not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb\rquote 
s infinite depths. We shall start by practising relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes\rquote  \endash  Ron began to snigger uncontrollably, and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise \endash  \lquote 
so as to clear the Inner Eye and the superconscious. Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you will See before the end of the class.\rquote 
\par And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, star\-ing blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as \lquote this is stupid\rquote  kept drifting across it. It didn\rquote 
t help that Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting.
\par \lquote Seen anything yet?\rquote  Harry asked them, after a quarter of an hour\rquote s quiet crystal-gazing.
\par \lquote Yeah, there\rquote s a burn on this table,\rquote  said Ron, pointing. \lquote Someone\rquote s spilled their candle.\rquote 
\par \lquote This is such a waste of time,\rquote  Hermione hissed. \lquote I could be practising something useful. I could be catching up on Cheering Charms \endash \rquote 
\par Professor Trelawney rustled past.
\par \lquote Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy por\-tents within their Orb?\rquote  she murmured over the clinking of her bangles.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t need help,\rquote  Ron whispered. \lquote It\rquote s obvious what this means. There\rquote s going to be loads of fog tonight.\rquote 
\par Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing.
\par \lquote Now, really!\rquote  said Professor Trelawney, as everyone\rquote s heads turned in their direction. Parvati and Lavender were looking scan\-dalised. \lquote You are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations!\rquote  She approached their table and pee
red into their crystal ball. Harry felt his heart sinking. He was sure he knew what was coming ...
\par \lquote There is something here!\rquote  Professor Trelawney whispered, low\-ering her face to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in her huge glasses. \lquote Something moving ... but what is it?\rquote 
\par Harry was prepared to bet everything he owned, including his Firebolt, that it wasn\rquote t good news, whatever it was. And sure enough ...
\par \lquote My dear ...\rquote  Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at Harry. \lquote It is here, plainer than ever before ... my dear, stalking towards you, growing ever closer ... the Gr\emdash \rquote

\par Professor Trelawney raised her enormous eyes to Hermione\rquote s face. Parvati whispered something to Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione, too. Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione with unmistakeable anger.
\par \lquote I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class, my }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 dear,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par There was a moment\rquote s silence. Then \endash

\par And to the whole class\rquote s amazement, Hermione strode over to the trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of sight.
\par It took a few minutes for the class to settle down again. Professor Trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the Grim. She turned abruptly from Harry and Ron\rquote s table, breathing rather heavily as she tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her.

\par \lquote Ooooo!\rquote  said Lavender suddenly, making everyone start. \lquote Oooooo, Professor Trelawney, I\rquote ve just remembered! You saw her leaving, didn\rquote t you? Didn\rquote t you, Professor? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be leaving us. One hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the Signs ... the Inner Eye can be a burden, you know ...\rquote 
\par Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over so that Professor Trelawney could join their table instead.
\par \lquote Some day Hermione\rquote s having, eh?\rquote  Ron muttered to Harry, looking awed.
\par \lquote Yeah ...\rquote 
\par Harry glanced into the crystal ball, but saw nothing but swirling white mist. Had Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again? Would he? The last thing he needed was another near-fatal accident, with the Quidditch final drawing ever nearer.

s under her eyes, and seemed constantly close to tears.
\par Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak\rquote s appeal. When he wasn\rquote t doing his own work, he was poring over enormously thick volumes with names like }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196

\par Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quidditch practice every day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood. The Gryffindor\endash 
Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after the Easter holidays. Slytherin were leading the tournament by exactly two hundred points. This meant (as Wood constantly reminded his team) that they needed t

\par \lquote I KNOW, OLIVER!\rquote  Harry yelled.
\par The whole of Gryffindor house was obsessed with the coming match. Gryffindor hadn\rquote t won the Quidditch Cup since the leg\-endary Charlie Weasley (Ron\rquote 
s second-oldest brother) had been Seeker. But Harry doubted whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to win as much as he did. The enmity between Ha
rry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade, and even more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of punish\-ment. Harry hadn\rquote t forgotten Malfoy\rquote 
s attempt to sabotage him in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buckbeak that made him most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school.
\par Never, in anyone\rquote s memory, had a match approached in such a highly charged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were
 over, tension between the two teams and their houses was at breaking-point. A number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors, cul\-
minating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor fourth-year and a Slytherin sixth-year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears.
\par Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He couldn\rquote t walk to class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him up; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever he went, and slouching away lo
oking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people. Wood had given instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of action. The whole of Gryffindor house took up the challenge enthusiastically
, so that it was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerned for his Firebolt\rquote s safety than his own. When he wasn\rquote 
t flying it, he locked it securely in his trunk, and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower at break-times to check that it was still there.

\par And next moment, it had emerged: a gigantic, shaggy black dog, moving stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks trotting at its side. Harry stared. What did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the dog as well, how could it be an omen of Harry\rquote

Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touching nothing himself. Then he hurried them off to the pitch before anyone else had finished, so they could get an idea of the conditions. As they left the Great Hall, e
veryone applauded again.
\par \lquote Good luck, Harry!\rquote  called Cho Chang. Harry felt himself blushing.
\par \lquote OK ... no wind to speak of ... sun\rquote s a bit bright, that could impair your vision, watch out for it ... ground\rquote s fairly hard, good, that\rquote ll give us a fast kick-off ...\rquote 
\par Wood paced the pitch, staring around with the team behind him. Finally they saw the front doors of the castle open in the dis\-tance, and the rest of the school spill onto the lawn.
\par \lquote Changing rooms,\rquote  said Wood tersely.
\par None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes. Harry wondered if they were feeling like he was: as though he\rquote d eaten something extremely wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no time at all, Wood was saying, \lquote OK, it
\rquote s time, let\rquote s go ...\rquote 
\par They walked out onto the pitch to a tidal wave of noise. Three-quarters of the crowd were wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion upon them or brandishing banners with slogans such as \lquote GO GRYFFINDOR!\rquote  and 
\lquote LIONS FOR THE CUP!\rquote  Behind the Slytherin goalposts, however, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent of Slytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very front row, wear\-
ing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile.
\par \lquote And here are the Gryffindors!\rquote  yelled Lee Jordan, who was act\-ing as commentator as usual. \lquote Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley and Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best side Hogwarts has seen in a good few years 
\endash \rquote 
\par Lee\rquote s comments were drowned by a tide of \lquote boos\rquote  from the Slytherin end.
\par \lquote And here come the Slytherin team, led by captain Flint. He\rquote s made some changes in the line-up and seems to be going for size rather than skill \endash \rquote 
\par More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however, thought Lee had a point. Malfoy was easily the smallest person on the Slytherin team; the rest of them were enormous.
\par \lquote Captains, shake hands!\rquote  said Madam Hooch.
\par Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other\rquote s hands very tightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the other\rquote s fingers.
\par \lquote Mount your brooms!\rquote  said Madam Hooch. \lquote Three ... two ... one ...\rquote 
\par The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose
 into the air. Harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead; his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw Malfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch.

\par \lquote Sorry!\rquote  said Flint, as the crowd below booed. \lquote Sorry, didn\rquote t see her!\rquote

\par Madam Hooch\rquote s whistle rang out again as she soared over to Montague and began shouting at him. A minute later, Katie had put another penalty past the Slytherin Keeper.

\par \lquote Jordan, if you can\rquote t commentate in an unbiased way \endash !\rquote

\par Harry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He had seen the Snitch \endash  it was shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goalposts \endash  but he mustn\rquote t catch it yet. And if Malfoy saw it ...
\par Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled his Firebolt round and sped off towards the Slytherin end. It worked. Malfoy went haring after him, clearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there ...
\par WHOOSH.
\par One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry\rquote s right ear, hit by the gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick. Next moment \endash 
\par WHOOSH.
\par The second Bludger had grazed Harry\rquote s elbow. The other Beater, Bole, was closing in.
\par Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming towards him, clubs raised \endash 
\par He turned the Firebolt upwards at the last second, and Bole and Derrick collided with a sickening crunch.
\par \lquote Ha haaa!\rquote  yelled Lee Jordan, as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from each other, clutching their heads. \lquote Too bad, boys! You\rquote ll need to get up earlier than that to beat a Firebolt! And it\rquote

\par \lquote Sorry, Professor, sorry! Won\rquote t happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead, thirty points to ten, and Gryffindor in possession \endash \rquote 
\par It was turning into the dirtiest match Harry had ever played in. Enraged that Gryffindor had taken such an early lead, the Slytherins were rapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia with his club and tried to say he\rquote 
d thought she was a Bludger. George Weasley elbowed Bole in the face in retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams penalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular save, making the score forty\endash ten to Gryffindor.
\par The Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still keeping close to Harry as he soared over the match, looking around for it \endash  once Gryffindor were fifty points ahead ...
\par Katie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swoop\-ing around her, clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were thinking of revenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred and George\rquote s absence to a

\par The Gryffindor crowd below were screaming themselves hoarse \endash 
 Gryffindor were sixty points in the lead, and if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup was theirs. Harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as he soared around the pitch, high 
above the rest of the game, with Malfoy speeding along behind him.
\par And then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him.
\par Harry put on a huge burst of speed, the wind roaring in his ears; he stretched out his hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down \endash 
\par Horrified, he looked around. Malfoy had thrown himself for\-ward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt\rquote s tail and was pulling it back.
\par \lquote You \endash \rquote 
\par Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but he couldn\rquote t reach. Malfoy was panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were sparkling maliciously. He had achieved what he\rquote d wanted \endash 
 the Snitch had disappeared again.
\par \lquote Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I\rquote ve never seen such tactics!\rquote  Madam Hooch screeched, shooting up to where Malfoy was slid\-ing back onto his Nimbus Two Thousand and One.
\par \lquote YOU CHEATING SCUM!\rquote  Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone, dancing out of Professor McGonagall\rquote s reach. \lquote YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B\emdash \rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall didn\rquote t even bother to tell him off. She was actually shaking her fist in Malfoy\rquote s direction; her hat had fallen off, and she, too, was shouting furiously.
\par Alicia took Gryffindor\rquote s penalty, but she was so angry she missed by several feet. The Gryffindor team was losing concentra\-tion and the Slytherins, delighted by Malfoy\rquote s foul on Harry, were being spurred on to greater heights.
\par \lquote Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal \endash  Montague scores \endash \rquote  Lee groaned. \lquote Seventy\endash twenty to Gryffindor ...\rquote 
\par Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hit\-ting each other. Harry wasn\rquote t going to let Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch ...
\par \lquote Get out of it, Potter!\rquote  Malfoy yelled in frustration, as he tried to turn and found Harry blocking him.
\par \lquote Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor, come on, Angelina, COME ON!\rquote 
\par Harry looked round. Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy, even the Slytherin Keeper, was streaking up the pitch towards Angelina \endash  they were all going to block her \endash 
\par Harry wheeled the Firebolt about, bent so low he was lying flat along the handle and kicked it forwards. Like a bullet, he shot towards the Slytherins.
\par \lquote AAAAAAARRRGH!\rquote 
\par They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed towards them; Angelina\rquote s way was clear.
\par \lquote SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor lead by eighty points to twenty!\rquote 
\par Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt in mid-air, reversed and zoomed back into the middle of the pitch.
\par And then he saw something to make his heart stand still. Malfoy was diving, a look of triumph on his face \endash  there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer.
\par Harry urged the Firebolt downwards but Malfoy was miles ahead.
\par \lquote Go! Go! Go!\rquote  Harry urged his broom. They were gaining on Malfoy ... Harry flattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him ... he was at Malfoy\rquote s ankles ... he was level \endash 
\par Harry threw himself forwards, taking both hands off his broom. He knocked Malfoy\rquote s arm out of the way and \endash 
\par \lquote YES!\rquote 
\par He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadium exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his ears. The tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wings hopelessly against his fingers.
\par Then Wood was speeding towards him, half-blinded by tears; he seized Harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harry felt two large thumps as Fred and George hit them; then Angelina, Alicia and Katie\rquote s voices, }{

Tangled together in a many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling hoarsely, back to earth.
\par Wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto the pitch. Hands were raining down on their backs. Harry had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in
 on him. Then he, and the rest of the team, were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd. Thrust into the light, he saw Hagrid, plas\-tered with crimson rosettes \endash  \lquote Yeh beat \rquote em, Harry, yeh beat \rquote em! Wait till I tell Buckbeak!
\rquote  There was Percy, jumping up and down like a maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor McGonagall was sobbing harder even than Wood, wiping her eyes with an enor\-
mous Gryffindor flag; and there, fighting their way towards Harry, were Ron and Hermione. Words failed them. They simply beamed, as Harry was borne towards the stands, where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup.
\par If only there had been a Dementor around ... As a sobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have produced the world\rquote s best Patronus.

s euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup lasted at least a week. Even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, the days became cloudless and sultry, and all any\-
body felt like doing was strolling into the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice, per\-haps playing a casual game of Gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake.

t. The exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazing around outside, the students were forced to remain inside the castle, trying to bully their brains into concen\-trating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in t
hrough the windows. Even Fred and George Weasley had been spotted work\-
ing; they were about to take their O.W.Ls (Ordinary Wizarding Levels). Percy was getting ready to sit his N.E.W.Ts (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), the highest qualification Hogwar
ts offered. As Percy hoped to enter the Ministry of Magic, he needed top grades. He was becoming increasingly edgy, and gave very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings. In fact, the only person who seemed
 more anxious than Percy was Hermione.

s triumph in the Quidditch final, seemed to regain some of his old swagger over the next few days. From sneering comments Harry o
verheard, Malfoy was certain Buckbeak was going to be killed, and seemed thoroughly pleased with himself for bringing it about. It was all Harry could do to stop himself imitating Hermione and hitting Malfoy in the face on these occasions. And the worst t
hing of all was that they had no time or opportunity to go and see Hagrid, because the strict new security measures had not been lifted, and Harry didn\rquote t dare retrieve his Invisibility Cloak from below the one-eyed witch.

\par Then, after a hasty lunch, it was straight back upstairs for the Charms exam. Hermione had been right; Professor Flitwick did indeed test them on Cheering Charms. Harry slightly 
overdid his out of nerves and Ron, who was partnering him, ended up in fits of hysterical laughter and had to be led away to a quiet room for an hour before he was ready to perform the Charm himself. After dinner, the students hurried back to their common
 rooms, not to relax, but to start revising for Care of Magical Creatures, Potions and Astronomy.
\par Hagrid presided over the Care of Magical Creatures exam the following morning with a very preoccupied air indeed; his heart didn\rquote t seem to be in it at all. He 
had provided a large tub of fresh Flobberworms for the class, and told them that, to pass the test, their Flobberworm had to still be alive at the end of one hour. As Flobberworms flourished best if left to their own devices, it was the easiest exam any o
f them had ever sat, and also gave Harry, Ron and Hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid.
\par \lquote Beaky\rquote s gettin\rquote  a bit depressed,\rquote  Hagrid told them, bending low on the pretence of checking that Harry\rquote s Flobberworm was still alive. \lquote Bin cooped up too long. But still ... we\rquote ll know day after tomorrow 
\endash  one way or the other.\rquote 
\par They had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified dis\-aster. Try as Harry might, he couldn\rquote t get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and Snape, standing watching with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbled something that looked suspi\-
ciously like a zero onto his notes before moving away.
\par Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in which Harry scrib\-bled everything Florean Fortescue had ever told him about medieval witch hunts, while wishing he could have had one of Fortescue\rquote 
s choco-nut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom. Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the greenhouses under a baking hot sun; then back to
 the common room once more, with the backs of their necks sunburnt, thinking longingly of this time next day, when it would all be over.
\par Their second from last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defence Against the Dark Arts. Professor Lupin had compiled the m
ost unusual exam any of them had ever taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun, where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a Grindylow, cross a series of potholes full of Red Caps, squish their way across a patch of marsh, ig
nor\-ing the misleading directions from a Hinkypunk, then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new Boggart.
\par \lquote Excellent, Harry,\rquote  Lupin muttered, as Harry climbed out of the trunk, grinning. \lquote Full marks.\rquote 
\par Flushed with his success, Harry hung around to wat
ch Ron and Hermione. Ron did very well until he reached the Hinkypunk, which successfully confused him into sinking waist-high into the quagmire. Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the Boggart in it. After about a minute in
side it, she burst out again, screaming.
\par \lquote Hermione!\rquote  said Lupin, startled. \lquote What\rquote s the matter?\rquote 
\par \lquote P-P-Professor McGonagall!\rquote  Hermione gasped, pointing into the trunk. \lquote Sh-she said I\rquote d failed everything!\rquote 
\par It took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at last she had regained a grip on herself, she, Harry and Ron went back to the castle. Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione\rquote 
s Boggart, but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps.
\par Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was standing there staring out at the grounds. He started at the sight of Harry.
\par \lquote Hello there, Harry!\rquote  he said. \lquote Just had an exam, I expect? Nearly finished?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with the Minister for Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background.
\par \lquote Lovely day,\rquote  said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake. \lquote Pity ... pity ...\rquote 
\par He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.
\par \lquote I\rquote m here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad Hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black situation, I was asked to step in.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Does that mean the appeal\rquote s already happened?\rquote  Ron interrupt\-ed, stepping forwards.
\par \lquote No, no, it\rquote s scheduled for this afternoon,\rquote  said Fudge, looking curiously at Ron.
\par \lquote Then you might not have to witness an execution at all!\rquote  said Ron stoutly. \lquote The Hippogriff might get off!\rquote 
\par Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the cas\-tle doors behind him. One was so ancient he appeared to be with\-
ering before their very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin black moustache. Harry gathered that they were representa\-tives of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because the very old wizard squinted towards Hagrid
\rquote s cabin and said in a feeble voice, \lquote Dear, dear, I\rquote m getting too old for this ... two o\rquote clock, isn\rquote t it, Fudge?\rquote 
\par The black-moustached man was fingering something in his belt; Harry looked and saw that h
e was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe. Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head towards the Entrance Hall.
\par \lquote Why\rquote d you stop me?\rquote  said Ron angrily, as they entered the Great Hall for lunch. \lquote Did you see them? They\rquote ve even got the axe ready! This isn\rquote t justice!\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron, your dad works for the Ministry. You can\rquote t go saying things like that to his boss!\rquote  said Hermione, but she, too, looked very upset. \lquote As long as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argues his case properly, they can
\rquote t possibly execute Buckbeak ...\rquote 
\par But Harry could tell Hermione didn\rquote t really believe what she was saying. All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch, happily anticipating the
 end of exams that afternoon, but Harry, Ron and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn\rquote t join in.
\par Harry and Ron\rquote s last exam was Divination; Hermione\rquote s, Muggle Studies. They walked up the marble staircase together. Hermione left them on th
e first floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh, where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney\rquote s classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute revision.
\par \lquote She\rquote s seeing us all separately,\rquote  Neville informed them, as they went to sit down next to him. He had his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Unfogging the Future }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal-gazing. \lquote Have either of you ever seen }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 anything }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 in a crystal ball?\rquote  he asked them unhappily.
\par \lquote Nope,\rquote  said Ron, in an offhand voice. He kept checking his watch; Harry knew that he was counting down the time until Buckbeak\rquote s appeal started.
\par The queue of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each person climbed back down the silver ladder, the rest of the class hissed, \lquote What did she ask? Was it OK?\rquote 
\par But they all refused to say.
\par \lquote She says the crystal ball\rquote s told her that, if I tell you, I\rquote ll have a horrible accident!\rquote  squeaked Neville, as he clambered back down the ladder towards Harry and Ron, who had now reached the landing.
\par \lquote That\rquote s convenient,\rquote  snorted Ron. \lquote You know, I\rquote m starting to think Hermione was right about her,\rquote  (he jabbed his thumb towards the trapdoor overhead), \lquote she\rquote s a right old fraud.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, looking at his own watch. It was now two o\rquote clock. \lquote Wish she\rquote d hurry up ...\rquote 
\par Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride.
\par \lquote She says I\rquote ve got all the makings of a true Seer,\rquote  she informed Harry and Ron. \lquote I saw }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 loads }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 of stuff ... well, good luck!\rquote 
\par She hurried off down the spiral staircase towards Lavender.
\par \lquote Ronald Weasley,\rquote  said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads. Ron grimaced at Harry, and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry was now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on the floor 
with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid.
\par Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron\rquote s large feet reappeared on the ladder.
\par \lquote How\rquote d it go?\rquote  Harry asked him, standing up.
\par \lquote Rubbish,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Couldn\rquote t see a thing, so I made some stuff up. Don\rquote t think she was convinced, though ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Meet you in the common room,\rquote  Harry muttered, as Professor Trelawney\rquote s voice called, \lquote Harry Potter!\rquote 
\par The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curt
ains were closed, the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and tables to where Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crys\-tal ball.
\par \lquote Good day, my dear,\rquote  she said softly. \lquote If you would kindly gaze into the Orb ... take your time, now ... then tell me what you see within it ...\rquote 
\par Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could, willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but nothing happened.
\par \lquote Well?\rquote  Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. \lquote What do you see?\rquote 
\par The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He thought of what Ron had just said, and decided to pretend.
\par \lquote Er \endash ,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote a dark shape ... um ...\rquote 
\par \lquote What does it resemble?\rquote  whispered Professor Trelawney. \lquote Think, now ...\rquote 
\par Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.
\par \lquote A Hippogriff,\rquote  he said firmly.
\par \lquote Indeed!\rquote  whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees. \lquote My boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid\rquote 
s trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look closer ... does the Hippogriff appear to ... have its head?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry firmly.
\par \lquote Are you sure?\rquote  Professor Trelawney urged him. \lquote Are you quite sure, dear? You don\rquote t see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it?\rquote 
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.
\par \lquote No blood? No weeping Hagrid?\rquote 
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat. \lquote It looks fine, it\rquote s \endash  flying away ...\rquote 
\par Professor Trelawney sighed.
\par \lquote Well, dear, I think we\rquote ll leave it there ... a little disappointing ... but I\rquote m sure you did your best.\rquote 
\par Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then a loud, harsh voice spoke behind him.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote It will happen tonight.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
\par Harry wheeled around. Professor Trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging.
\par \lquote S-sorry?\rquote  said Harry.
\par But Professor Trelawney didn\rquote t seem to hear him. Her eyes started to roll. Harry stood there in a panic. She looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure. He hesitated, thinking of running to the hospital wing \endash 
 and then Professor Trelawney spoke again, in the same harsh voice, quite unlike her own:
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his follow\-

\par Professor Trelawney\rquote s head fell forwards onto her chest. She made a grunting sort of noise. Then, quite suddenly, her head snapped up again.
\par \lquote I\rquote m so sorry, dear boy,\rquote  she said dreamily. \lquote The heat of the day, you know ... I drifted off for a moment ...\rquote 
\par Harry stood there, still staring.
\par \lquote Is there anything wrong, my dear?\rquote 
\par \lquote You \endash  you just told me that the \endash  the Dark Lord\rquote s going to rise again ... that his servant\rquote s going to go back to him ...\rquote 
\par Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled.
\par \lquote The Dark Lord? He Who Must Not Be Named? My dear boy, that\rquote s hardly something to joke about ... rise again, indeed ...\rquote 
\par \lquote But you just said it! You said the Dark Lord \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I think you must have dozed off too, dear!\rquote  said Professor Trelawney. \lquote I would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as far-fetched as }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
that!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
\par Harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase, wondering ... had he just heard Professor Trelawney make a real prediction? Or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test?
\par Five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Trelawney\rquote 
s words still resounding in his head. People were striding past him in the opposite direction, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit of long-awaited freedom; by the t
ime he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room, it was almost deserted. Over in a corner, however, sat Ron and Hermione.
\par \lquote Professor Trelawney,\rquote  Harry panted, \lquote just told me \endash \rquote 
\par But he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces.
\par \lquote Buckbeak lost,\rquote  said Ron weakly. \lquote Hagrid\rquote s just sent this.\rquote 
\par Hagrid\rquote s note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legible.

\par \lquote Yeh shouldn\rquote ve come!\rquote  Hagrid whispered, but he stood back, and they stepped inside. Hagrid shut the door quickly and Harry pulled off the Cloak.
\par Hagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon their necks. He looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do. This helplessness was worse to watch than tears.
\par \lquote Wan\rquote  some tea?\rquote  he said. His great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettle.

\par \lquote Scabbers!\rquote  said Ron blankly. \lquote Scabbers, what are you doing here?\rquote 
\par He grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light. Scabbers looked dreadful. He was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches, and he writhed in Ron\rquote s hands as though desperate to free himself.
\par \lquote It\rquote s OK, Scabbers!\rquote  said Ron. \lquote No cats! There\rquote s nothing here to hurt you!\rquote 
\par Hagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the window. His normally ruddy face had gone the colour of parchment.
\par \lquote They\rquote re comin\rquote  ...\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione whipped around. A group of men was walking down the distant castle steps. In front was Albus Dumbledore, his silver beard gleaming i

\par \lquote Yeh gotta go,\rquote  said Hagrid. Every inch of him was trembling. \lquote They mustn\rquote  find yeh here ... go on, now ...\rquote 
\par Ron stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione picked up the Cloak.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll let yeh out the back way,\rquote  said Hagrid.
\par They followed him to the door into his back garden. Harry felt strangely unreal, and even more so when he saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered to a tree behind Hagrid\rquote 
s pumpkin patch. Buckbeak seemed to know something was happening. He turned his sharp head from side to side, and pawed the ground nervously.
\par \lquote It\rquote s OK, Beaky,\rquote  said Hagrid softly. \lquote It\rquote s OK ...\rquote  He turned to Harry, Ron and Hermione. \lquote Go on,\rquote  he said. \lquote Get goin\rquote .\rquote

\par They had no choice. As Hermione threw the Cloak over Harry and Ron, they heard voices at the front of the cabin. Hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight.
\par \lquote Go quick,\rquote  he said hoarsely. \lquote Don\rquote  listen ...\rquote 
\par And he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door.
\par Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron and Hermione set off silently around Hagrid\rquote s house. As they reached the other side, the front door closed with a sharp snap.
\par \lquote Please, let\rquote s hurry,\rquote  Hermione whispered. \lquote I can\rquote t stand it, I can\rquote t bear it ...\rquote 
\par They started up the sloping lawn towards the castle. The sun was sinking fast now; the sky had turned to a clear, purple-tinged grey, but to the west there was a ruby-red glow.
\par Ron stopped dead.
\par \lquote Oh, please, Ron,\rquote  Hermione began.
\par \lquote It\rquote s Scabbers \endash  he won\rquote t \endash  stay put \endash \rquote

\par \lquote Scabbers, it\rquote s me, you idiot, it\rquote s Ron,\rquote  Ron hissed.
\par They heard a door open behind them and men\rquote s voices.
\par \lquote Oh Ron, please let\rquote s move, they\rquote re going to do it!\rquote  Hermione breathed.

\par \lquote Scabbers, keep still,\rquote  Ron hissed, clamping his hand over his chest. The rat was wriggling madly. Ron came to a sudden halt, trying to force Scabbers deeper into his pocket. \lquote What\rquote

\par Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right in front of him. He was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in his pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump.

\par But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even catch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws. Something was bounding towards them out of the dark \endash  an enormous, pale-eyed, jet-black dog.
\par Harry reached for his wand, but too late \endash  the dog had made an enormous leap and its front paws hit him on the chest. He keeled over backwards in a whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch-long teeth \endash 
\par But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him; dazed, feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up; he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.
\par Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back towards them, he pushed Harry aside; the dog\rquote s jaws fastened instead around Ron\rquote s outstretched arm. Harry lunged at it and seized a handful of the brute\rquote 
s hair, but it was dragging Ron away as easily as if he were a rag-doll \endash 
\par Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again. He heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall, too. Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes \endash

\par The wand-light showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind, whipping back\-wards and forwards to stop them going nearer.
\par And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron backwards into a large gap in the roots \endash  Ron was fighting furi\-ously, but his head and torso were slipping out of sight \endash 
\par \lquote Ron!\rquote  Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backwards again.
\par All they could see now was one of Ron\rquote s legs, which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog pulling him fur\-ther underground. Then a horrible crack cut the air like a gun\-shot; Ron\rquote 
s leg had broken, and next second, his foot had van\-ished from sight.
\par \lquote Harry \endash  we\rquote ve got to go for help \endash \rquote  Hermione cried; she was bleeding, too; the Willow had cut her across the shoulder.
\par \lquote No! That thing\rquote s big enough to eat him, we haven\rquote t got time \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re never going to get through without help \endash \rquote 
\par Another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like knuckles.
\par \lquote If that dog can get in, we can,\rquote  Harry panted, darting here and there, trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but he couldn\rquote t get an inch nearer to the tree-roots without being in range of the tree\rquote 
s blows.
\par \lquote Oh, help, help,\rquote  Hermione whispered frantically, dancing uncertainly on the spot, \lquote please ...\rquote 
\par Crookshanks darted forwards. He slithered between the batter\-ing branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk.
\par Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped moving. Not a leaf twitched or shook.
\par \lquote Crookshanks!\rquote  Hermione whispered uncertainly. She now grasped Harry\rquote s arm painfully hard. \lquote How did he know \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s friends with that dog,\rquote  said Harry grimly. \lquote I\rquote ve seen them together. Come on \endash  and keep your wand out \endash \rquote 
\par They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds, but before they had reached the gap in the roots, Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottle-brush tail. Harry went next; he crawled forwards, headfirst, and slid down an earthy slope to the 
bottom of a very low tunnel. Crookshanks was a little way along, his eyes flashing in the light from Harry\rquote s wand. Seconds later, Hermione slithered down beside him.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Ron?\rquote  she whispered in a terrified voice.
\par \lquote This way,\rquote  said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crookshanks.
\par \lquote Where does this tunnel come out?\rquote  Hermione asked breathlessly from behind him.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know ... it\rquote s marked on the Marauder\rquote s Map but Fred and George said no one\rquote s ever got into it. It goes off the edge of the map, but it looked like it ends up in Hogsmeade ...\rquote 
\par They moved as fast as they could, bent almost double; ahead of them, Crookshanks\rquote s tail bobbed in and out of view. On and on went the passage; it felt at least as long as the one to Honeydukes. All Harry could think of
 was Ron, and what the enormous dog might be doing to him ... he was drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at a crouch ...
\par And then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it twisted, and Crookshanks had gone. Instead, Harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening.
\par He and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forwards. Both raised their wands to see what lay beyond.
\par It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper was peel\-ing from the walls; there were stains all over the floor; every piece of furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it. The windows were all boarded-up.
\par Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very frightened, but nodded.
\par Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around. The room was deserted, but a door to their right stood open, leading to a shadowy hallway. Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry\rquote s arm again. Her wide eyes were travelling around the boarded windows.

\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  she whispered. \lquote I think we\rquote re in the Shrieking Shack.\rquote 
\par Harry looked around. His eyes fell on a wooden chair near them. Large chunks had been torn out of it; one of the legs had been ripped off entirely.
\par \lquote Ghosts didn\rquote t do that,\rquote  he said slowly.
\par At that moment, there was a creak overhead. Something had moved upstairs. Both of them looked up at the ceiling. Hermione\rquote s grip on Harry\rquote s arm was so tight he was losing feeling in his fin\-
gers. He raised his eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go.
\par Quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor, where a wide, shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs.
\par They reached the dark landing.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Nox,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands went out. Only one door was open. As they crept towards it, they heard movement from behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring. They exchanged a last look, a last nod.
\par Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open.
\par On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings, lay Crookshanks, purring loudly at the sight of them. On the floor beside him, clutching his leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron.
\par Harry and Hermione dashed across to him.
\par \lquote Ron \endash  are you OK?\rquote 
\par \lquote Where\rquote s the dog?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not a dog,\rquote  Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with pain. \lquote Harry, it\rquote s a trap \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What \endash \rquote

\par Ron was staring over Harry\rquote s shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a snap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.
\par A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn\rquote 
t been shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse. The waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it looked like a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a grin. It was Sirius Black.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Expelliarmus!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 he croaked, pointing Ron\rquote s wand at them.
\par Harry\rquote s and Hermione\rquote s wands shot out of their hands, high in the air, and Black caught them. Then he took a step closer. His eyes were fixed on Harry.
\par \lquote I thought you\rquote d come and help your friend,\rquote  he said hoarsely. His voice sounded as though he had long ago lost the habit of using it. \lquote Your father would have done the same for me. Brave of you, not to run for a teacher. I
\rquote m grateful ... it will make every\-thing much easier ...\rquote 
\par The taunt about his father rang in Harry\rquote s ears as though Black had bellowed it. A boiling hate erupted in Harry\rquote 
s chest, leaving no place for fear. For the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back in his hand, not to defend himself, but to
 attack ... to kill. Without knowing what he was doing, he started forwards, but there was a sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him back. \lquote No, Harry!\rquote 
 Hermione gasped in a petrified whisper; Ron, however, spoke to Black.
\par \lquote If you want to kill Harry, you\rquote ll have to kill us, too!\rquote  he said fiercely, though the effort of standing up had drained him of still more colour, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.
\par Something flickered in Black\rquote s shadowed eyes.
\par \lquote Lie down,\rquote  he said quietly to Ron. \lquote You will damage that leg even more.\rquote 
\par \lquote Did you hear me?\rquote  Ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully to Harry to stay upright. \lquote You\rquote ll have to kill all three of us!\rquote 
\par \lquote There\rquote ll only be one murder here tonight,\rquote  said Black, and his grin widened.
\par \lquote Why\rquote s that?\rquote  Harry spat, trying to wrench himself free of Ron and Hermione. \lquote Didn\rquote t care last time, did you? Didn\rquote t mind slaughtering all those Muggles to get at Pettigrew ... What\rquote 
s the matter, gone soft in Azkaban?\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  Hermione whimpered. \lquote Be quiet!\rquote 
\par \lquote HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!\rquote  Harry roared, and with a huge effort he broke free of Hermione and Ron\rquote s restraint and lunged forwards \endash 
\par He had forgotten about magic \endash  he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man. All Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and that he didn\rquote 
t care how much he got hurt in return ...
\par Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black didn\rquote t raise the wands in time. One of Harry\rquote s hands fastened over Black\rquote s wasted wrist, forcing the wandtips away; the knuckles of Harry\rquote 
s other hand collided with the side of Black\rquote s head and they fell, backwards, into the wall \endash 
\par Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as the wands in Black\rquote s hand sent into the air a jet of sparks which missed Harry\rquote 
s face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand punching every part of Black it could find.
\par But Black\rquote s free hand had found Harry\rquote s throat \endash 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  he hissed. \lquote I\rquote ve waited too long \endash \rquote 
\par The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew.
\par Then he saw Hermione\rquote s foot swing out of nowhere. Black let go of Harry with a grunt of pain. Ron had thrown himself on Black\rquote s wand hand and Harry heard a faint clatter \endash 
\par He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor; he threw himself towards it but \endash 
\par \lquote Argh!\rquote 
\par Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into Harry\rquote s arm; Harry threw him off, but Crookshanks now darted towards Harry\rquote s wand \endash 
\par \lquote NO YOU DON\rquote T!\rquote  roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned \endash 
\par \lquote Get out of the way!\rquote  he shouted at Ron and Hermione.
\par They didn\rquote t need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, her lip bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her and Ron\rquote s wands. Ron crawled to the four-poster and collapsed onto it, pant\-ing, his white fac
e now tinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg.
\par Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer, his wand pointing straight at Black\rquote s heart.
\par \lquote Going to kill me, Harry?\rquote  he whispered.
\par Harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing at Black\rquote s chest, looking down at him. A livid bruise was rising around Black\rquote s left eye and his nose was bleeding.
\par \lquote You killed my parents,\rquote  said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but his wand hand quite steady.
\par Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t deny it,\rquote  he said, very quietly. \lquote But if you knew the whole story \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote The whole story?\rquote  Harry repeated, a furious pounding in his ears. \lquote You sold them to Voldemort, that\rquote s all I need to know!\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote ve got to listen to me,\rquote  Black said, and there was a note of urgency in his voice now. \lquote You\rquote ll regret it if you don\rquote t ... you don\rquote t understand ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I understand a lot better than you think,\rquote  said Harry, and his voice shook more than ever. \lquote You never heard her, did you? My mum ... trying to stop Voldemort killing me ... and you did that ... you did it ...\rquote 
\par Before either of them could say another word, something gin\-ger streaked past Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black\rquote s chest, and settled himself there, right over Black\rquote s heart. Black blinked and looked down at the cat.
\par \lquote Get off,\rquote  he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks off him.
\par But Crookshanks sank his claws into Black\rquote s robes and wouldn\rquote t shift. He turned his ugly, squashed face to Harry, and looked up at him with those great yellow eyes. To his right, Hermione gave a dry sob.
\par Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his grip tighten\-ing on the wand. So what if he had to kill the cat, too? It was in league with Black ... if it was prepared to die, trying to protect Black, that wasn\rquote t Harry\rquote 
s business ... if Black wanted to save it, that only proved he cared more for Crookshanks than Harry\rquote s parents ...
\par Harry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it. Now was the moment to avenge his mother and father. He was going to kill Black. He had to kill Black. This was his chance ...
\par The seconds lengthened, and still Harry stood frozen there, wand poised, Black staring up at him, Crookshanks on his chest. Ron\rquote s ragged breathing came from near the bed; Hermione was quite silent.
\par And then came a new sound \endash 
\par Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor \endash  someone was moving downstairs.
\par \lquote WE\rquote RE UP HERE!\rquote  Hermione screamed suddenly. \lquote WE\rquote RE UP HERE \endash  SIRIUS BLACK \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 QUICK!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196

\par The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his face bloodless, his wand raised and ready. His eyes flick\-
ered over Ron, lying on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the door, to Harry, standing there with his wand covering Black, and then to Black himself, crumpled and bleeding at Harry\rquote s feet.

\par Harry\rquote s wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione was holding. Lupin caught them all deftly, then moved into the room, staring at Black, who still had Crookshanks lying protectively across his chest.
\par Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn\rquote t done it. His nerve had failed him. Black was going to be handed back to the Dementors.
\par Then Lupin spoke, in an odd voice, a voice that shook with some suppressed emotion. \lquote Where is he, Sirius?\rquote 
\par Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn\rquote t understand what Lupin meant. Who was Lupin talking about? He turned to look at Black again.
\par Black\rquote s face was quite expressionless. For a few seconds, he didn\rquote t move at all. Then, very slowly, he raised his empty hand, and pointed straight at Ron. Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked bewildered.
\par \lquote But then ...\rquote  Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind, \lquote ... why hasn\rquote t he shown himself before now? Unless \endash \rquote  Lupin\rquote

\par Very slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin\rquote s face, Black nodded.
\par \lquote Professor Lupin,\rquote  Harry interrupted loudly, \lquote what\rquote s going \endash ?\rquote 
\par But he never finished the question, because what he saw made his voice die in his throat. Lupin was lowering his wand. Next moment, he had walked to Black\rquote

\par Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.

\par There was a ringing silence. Everyone\rquote s eyes were now on Lupin, who looked remarkably calm, though rather pale.
\par \lquote Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,\rquote  he said. \lquote Only one out of three, I\rquote m afraid. I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly don\rquote t want Harry dead ...\rquote 
 An odd shiver passed over his face. \lquote But I won\rquote t deny that I am a werewolf.\rquote 
\par Ron made a valiant effort to get up again, but fell back with a whimper of pain. Lupin made towards him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote

\par \lquote Ages,\rquote  Hermione whispered. \lquote Since I did Professor Snape\rquote s essay ...\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote ll be delighted,\rquote  said Lupin coolly. \lquote He set that essay hoping someone would realise what my symptoms meant. Did you check the lunar chart and realise that I was always ill at the full moon? Or did you realise t

\par \lquote You\rquote re the cleverest witch of your age I\rquote ve ever met, Hermione.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not,\rquote  Hermione whispered. \lquote If I\rquote d been a bit cleverer, I\rquote d have told everyone what you are!\rquote 
\par \lquote But they already know,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote At least, the staff do.\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf?\rquote  Ron gasped. \lquote Is he mad?\rquote 
\par \lquote Some of the staff thought so,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote He had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that I\rquote m trustworthy \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote AND HE WAS WRONG!\rquote  Harry yelled. \lquote YOU\rquote VE BEEN HELP\-ING HIM ALL THE TIME!\rquote 
 He was pointing at Black, who had crossed to the four-poster bed and sunk onto it, his face hidden in one shaking hand. Crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap, purring. Ron edged away from both of them, drag\-ging his leg.

\par Harry didn\rquote t know what to think. Was it a trick?
\par \lquote If you haven\rquote t been helping him,\rquote  he said, with a furious glance at Black, \lquote how did you know he was here?\rquote 
\par \lquote The map,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote The Marauder\rquote s Map. I was in my office examining it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You know how to work it?\rquote  Harry said suspiciously.
\par \lquote Of course I know how to work it,\rquote  said Lupin, waving his hand impatiently. \lquote I helped write it. I\rquote m Moony \endash  that was my friends\rquote  nickname for me at school.\rquote

\par \lquote The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening, because I had an idea that you, Ron and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his Hippogriff was executed. And I was right, wasn\rquote t I?\rquote 

\par He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of dust rose at his feet.
\par \lquote You might have been wearing your father\rquote s old Cloak, Harry \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote How d\rquote you know about the Cloak?\rquote 
\par \lquote The number of times I saw James disappearing under it ...\rquote  said Lupin, waving an impatient hand again. \lquote The point is, even if you\rquote re wearing an Invisibility Cloak you show up on the Marauder\rquote 
s Map. I watched you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid\rquote s hut. Twenty minutes later, you left Hagrid, and set off back towards the castle. But you were now accompanied by some\-body else.\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote No, we weren\rquote t!\rquote 
\par \lquote I couldn\rquote t believe my eyes,\rquote  said Lupin, still pacing, and ignor\-ing Harry\rquote s interruption. \lquote I thought the map must be malfunction\-ing. How could he be with you?\rquote 
\par \lquote No one was with us!\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote And then I saw another dot, moving fast towards you, labelled Sirius Black ... I saw him collide with you, I watched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping Willow \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote One of us!\rquote  Ron said angrily.
\par \lquote No, Ron,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote Two of you.\rquote 
\par He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron.
\par \lquote Do you think I could have a look at the rat?\rquote  he said evenly.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote What\rquote s Scabbers got to do with it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Everything,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote Could I see him, please?\rquote 
\par Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers emerged, thrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black\rquote s lap and made a soft hissing noise.
\par Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at Scabbers.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared. \lquote What\rquote s my rat got to do with anything?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s not a rat,\rquote  croaked Sirius Black suddenly.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean \endash  of course he\rquote s a rat \endash \rquote

\par \lquote Ridiculous!\rquote  said Hermione faintly.
\par \lquote Peter Pettigrew\rquote s dead!\rquote  said Harry. \lquote He killed him twelve years ago!\rquote 
\par He pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively.
\par \lquote I meant to,\rquote  he growled, his yellow teeth bared, \lquote but little Peter got the better of me ... not this time, though!\rquote 
\par And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black\rquote s weight fell on his broken leg.
\par \lquote Sirius, NO!\rquote  Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging Black away from Ron again, \lquote WAIT! You can\rquote t do it just like that \endash  they need to understand \endash  we\rquote ve got to explain \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We can explain afterwards!\rquote  snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off, one hand still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron\rquote s face and neck as he tried to escape.
\par \lquote They\rquote ve \endash  got \endash  a \endash  right \endash  to \endash  know \endash  everything!\rquote  Lupin panted, still trying to restrain Black. \lquote Ron\rquote s kept him as a pet! There are parts of it even I don\rquote

\par Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron\rquote s bitten, scratched and bleeding hands.
\par \lquote All right, then,\rquote  Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat. \lquote Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re nutters, both of you,\rquote  said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for support. \lquote I\rquote ve had enough of this. I\rquote m off.\rquote 
\par He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand again, pointing it at Scabbers.
\par \lquote You\rquote re going to hear me out, Ron,\rquote  he said quietly. \lquote Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.\rquote 
\par \lquote HE\rquote S NOT PETER, HE\rquote S SCABBERS!\rquote  Ron yelled, trying to force the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting too hard; Ron swayed and overbalanced, and
 Harry caught him and pushed him back down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin.
\par \lquote There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,\rquote  he said. \lquote A whole street full of them ...\rquote 
\par \lquote They didn\rquote t see what they thought they saw!\rquote  said Black savage\-ly, still watching Scabbers struggling in Ron\rquote s hands.
\par \lquote Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,\rquote  said Lupin, nodding. \lquote I believed it myself \endash  until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder\rquote s Map never lies ... Peter\rquote s alive. Ron\rquote s holding him, Harry.\rquote 

\par Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have unhinged Black after all \endash 
 but why was Lupin playing along with him?
\par Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly.
\par \lquote But Professor Lupin ... Scabbers can\rquote t be Pettigrew ... it just can\rquote t be true, you know it can\rquote t ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Why can\rquote t it be true?\rquote  Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class, and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experi\-ment with Grindylows.
\par \lquote Because ... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework \endash 
 the Ministry keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there\rquote s a register showing what animal they become, and their markings and things ... and I went and looked Professor Mc
Gonagall up on the register, and there have only been seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew\rquote s name wasn\rquote t on the list \endash \rquote 
\par Harry barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh.
\par \lquote Right again, Hermione!\rquote  he said. \lquote But the Ministry never knew that there used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.\rquote 
\par \lquote If you\rquote re going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,\rquote  snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers\rquote s every desperate move. \lquote I\rquote ve waited twelve years, I\rquote m not going to wait much longer.\rquote 

\par \lquote All right ... but you\rquote ll need to help me, Sirius,\rquote  said Lupin, \lquote I only know how it began ...\rquote 
\par Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode towards it and looked out into the landing.
\par \lquote No one there ...\rquote 
\par \lquote This place is haunted!\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote It\rquote s not,\rquote  said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. \lquote The Shrieking Shack was never haunted ... the screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me.\rquote 
\par He pushed his greying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment, then said, \lquote That\rquote s where all of this starts \endash  with my becoming a werewolf. None of this could have happened if I hadn\rquote t been bitten ... and if I hadn\rquote 
t been so foolhardy ...\rquote 
\par He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione said, \lquote Shh!\rquote  She was watching Lupin very intently.
\par \lquote I was a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The Potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent dis\-
covery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform ... I am able to curl up in my office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.
\par \lquote Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully fledged monster once a month. It seemed impos\-sible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren\rquote t likely to want their children exposed to me.
\par \lquote But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympa\-thetic. He said that, as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I shouldn\rquote t come to school ...\rquote  Lupin sighed, and looked directly at Harry. \lquote 
I told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 because }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 I had come to Hogwarts. This house \endash \rquote  Lupin looked miserably around the room, \lquote \endash  the tunnel that leads to it \endash  t
hey were built for my use. Once a month, I was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform. The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while I was dangerous.\rquote 
\par Harry couldn\rquote t see where this story was going, but he was lis\-tening raptly all the same. The only sound apart from Lupin\rquote s voice was Scabbers\rquote s frightened squeaking.
\par \lquote My transformations in those days were \endash  were terrible. It is very painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so I b
it and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing par\-ticularly violent spirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumour ... even now, when the house has been silent for years, the villagers don
\rquote t dare approach it ...
\par \lquote But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends. Sirius Black ... Peter Pettigrew ... and, of course, your father, Harry \endash  James Potter.
\par \lquote Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disap\-
peared once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was ill, and that I had to go home to see her ... I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was. 
But of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the truth ...
\par \lquote And they didn\rquote t desert me at all. Instead they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life. They became Animagi.\rquote 
\par \lquote My dad, too?\rquote  said Harry, astounded.
\par \lquote Yes, indeed,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus transformation can go h
orribly wrong \endash 
 one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they managed it. They could each turn into a different animal at will.\rquote 
\par \lquote But how did that help you?\rquote  said Hermione, sounding puzzled.
\par \lquote They couldn\rquote t keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as animals,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote A werewolf is only a danger to people. They sneaked out of the castle every month under James\rquote 
s Invisibility Cloak. They transformed ... Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the Willow\rquote 
s attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. They would then slip down the tunnel and join me. Under their influence, I became less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed to become less so while I was with them.\rquote 

\par \lquote Hurry up, Remus,\rquote  snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger in his face.
\par \lquote I\rquote m getting there, Sirius, I\rquote m getting there ... well, highly excit\-
ing possibilities were open to us now we could all transform. Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals, they were able to keep a werewolf i
n check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did ... And that\rquote s how we came to write the Marauder\rquote 
s Map, and sign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James was Prongs.\rquote 
\par \lquote What sort of animal \endash ?\rquote  Harry began, but Hermione cut across him.
\par \lquote That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a werewolf! What if you\rquote d given the others the slip, and bit\-ten somebody?\rquote 
\par \lquote A thought that still haunts me,\rquote  said Lupin heavily. \lquote And there were near misses, many of them. We laughed about them after\-wards. We were young, thoughtless \endash  carried away with our own cleverness.\rquote 
\par \lquote I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore\rquote s trust, of course ... he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other Headmaster would have done so, and he had no idea I was break\-ing the rules he had set down for my own and others
\rquote  safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty feel\-ings every time we sat down to plan our next month\rquote s adventure. And I haven\rquote t changed ...\rquote 

\par Lupin\rquote s face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. \lquote All this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn\rquote 
t do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I\rquote d betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I\rquote d led others along with me ... and Dumbledore\rquote s trust has mean
t everything to me. He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job, when I have been shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I am. And so I con\-
vinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using Dark Arts he learnt from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had noth\-ing to do with it ... so, in a way, Snape\rquote s been right about me all along.\rquote 
\par \lquote Snape?\rquote  said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. \lquote What\rquote s Snape got to do with it?\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s here, Sirius,\rquote  said Lupin heavily. \lquote He\rquote s teaching here as well.\rquote  He looked up at Harry, Ron and Hermione.
\par \lquote Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my appointment to the Defence Against the Dark Arts job. He has been telling Dumbledore all year that I am not to be trust\-
ed. He has his reasons ... you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him, a trick which involved me \endash \rquote 
\par Black made a derisive noise.
\par \lquote It served him right,\rquote  he sneered. \lquote Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to ... hoping he could get us expelled ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Severus was very interested in where I went every month,\rquote  Lupin told Harry, Ron and Hermione. \lquote We were in the same year, you know, and we \endash  er \endash  didn\rquote t like eac
h other very much. He especially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James\rquote 
s talent on the Quidditch pitch ... anyway, Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me towards the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be \endash  er \endash 
 amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree-trunk with a long stick, and he\rquote d be able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it \endash  if he\rquote d got as far as this house, he\rquote 
d have met a fully grown werewolf \endash  but your father, who\rquote 
d heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life ... Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was forbidden to tell anybody by Dumbledore, but from that time on he knew what I was ...\rquote 

\par \lquote So that\rquote s why Snape doesn\rquote t like you,\rquote  said Harry slowly, \lquote because he thought you were in on the joke?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin.
\par Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing directly at Lupin.

\par Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of sup\-pressed triumph. \lquote You\rquote re wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?\rquote  he said, his eyes glittering. \lquote I\rquote 
ve just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your Potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky I did ... lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at it t

\par \lquote I\rquote ve told the Headmaster again and again that you\rquote ve been help\-ing your old friend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here\rquote s the proof. Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout \endash

\par BANG! Thin, snake-like cords burst from the end of Snape\rquote s wand and twisted themselves around Lupin\rquote s mouth, wrists and ankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of
 rage, Black started towards Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between Black\rquote s eyes.
\par \lquote Give me a reason,\rquote  he whispered. \lquote Give me a reason to do it, and I swear I will.\rquote 
\par Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred.
\par Harry stood there, paralysed, not knowing what to do or who to believe. He glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he did, still fighting to keep hold of the strug\-gling Scabbers. Hermione, however, took an uncertain ste

\par \lquote Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,\rquote  Snape spat. \lquote You, Potter and Weasley are out of bounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37

\par \lquote KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!\rquote  Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite deranged. \lquote DON\rquote T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON\rquote T UNDERSTAND!\rquote  A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointing at Black\rquote 
s face. Hermione fell silent.
\par \lquote Vengeance is very sweet,\rquote  Snape breathed at Black. \lquote How I hoped I would be the one to catch you ...\rquote 
\par \lquote The joke\rquote s on you again, Severus,\rquote  snarled Black. \lquote As long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle \endash \rquote  he jerked his head at Ron, \lquote \endash  I\rquote ll come quietly ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Up to the castle?\rquote  said Snape silkily. \lquote I don\rquote t think we need to go that far. All I have to do is call the Dementors once we get out of the Willow. They\rquote 
ll be very pleased to see you, Black ... pleased enough to give you a little kiss, I daresay ...\rquote 
\par What little colour there was in Black\rquote s face left it.
\par \lquote You \endash  you\rquote ve got to hear me out,\rquote  he croaked. \lquote The rat \endash  look at the rat \endash \rquote 
\par But there was a mad glint in Snape\rquote s eye that Harry had never seen before. He seemed beyond reason.
\par \lquote Come on, all of you,\rquote  he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. \lquote I\rquote ll drag the werewolf. Perhaps the Dementors will have a kiss for him, too \endash \rquote 
\par Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three strides, and blocked the door.
\par \lquote Get out of the way, Potter, you\rquote re in enough trouble already,\rquote  snarled Snape. \lquote If I hadn\rquote t been here to save your skin \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,\rquote  Harry said. \lquote I\rquote ve been alone with him loads of times, having defence lessons against the Dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn\rquote

\par Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even one step towards him, he had raised his wand.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Expelliarmus!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 he yelled \endash  except that his wasn\rquote 
t the only voice that shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had been knocked out.

\par Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to dis\-arm Snape at exactly the same moment. Snape\rquote s wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks.
\par \lquote You shouldn\rquote t have done that,\rquote  said Black, looking at Harry. \lquote You should have left him to me ...\rquote 
\par Harry avoided Black\rquote s eyes. He wasn\rquote t sure, even now, that he\rquote d done the right thing.
\par \lquote We attacked a teacher ... we attacked a teacher ...\rquote  Hermione whimpered, staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes. \lquote Oh, we\rquote re going to be in so much trouble \endash \rquote 
\par Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down quickly and untied him. Lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them.
\par \lquote Thank you, Harry,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote I\rquote m still not saying I believe you,\rquote  Harry retorted.
\par \lquote Then it\rquote s time we offered you some proof,\rquote  said Black. \lquote You, boy \endash  give me Peter. Now.\rquote 
\par Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest.
\par \lquote Come off it,\rquote  he said weakly. \lquote Are you trying to say you broke out of Azkaban just to get your hands on }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Scabbers? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 I mean ...\rquote  he looked up at Harry and Hermione for support. \lquote OK, say Pettigrew could turn into a rat \endash  there are millions of rats \endash  how\rquote 
s he supposed to know which one he\rquote s after if he was locked up in Azkaban?\rquote 
\par \lquote You know, Sirius, that\rquote s a fair question,\rquote  said Lupin, turning to Black and frowning slightly. \lquote How }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 did }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 you find out where he was?\rquote 
\par Black put one of his claw-like hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat, and held out to show the others.
\par It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
the previous summer, and there, on Ron\rquote s shoulder, was Scabbers.
\par \lquote How did you get this?\rquote  Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck.
\par \lquote Fudge,\rquote  said Black. \lquote When he came to inspect Azkaban last year, he gave me his paper. And there was Peter, on the front page ... on this boy\rquote 
s shoulder ... I knew him at once ... how many times had I seen him transform? And the caption said the boy would be going back to Hogwarts ... to where Harry was ...\rquote 
\par \lquote My God,\rquote  said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again. \lquote His front paw ...\rquote 
\par \lquote What about it?\rquote  said Ron defiantly.
\par \lquote He\rquote s got a toe missing,\rquote  said Black.
\par \lquote Of course,\rquote  Lupin breathed, \lquote so simple ... so }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 brilliant ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
He cut it off himself?\rquote 
\par \lquote Just before he transformed,\rquote  said Black. \lquote When I cornered him, he yelled for the whole street to hear that I\rquote 
d betrayed Lily and James. Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself \endash  and sped down into the sewer with the other rats ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Didn\rquote t you ever hear, Ron?\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote The biggest bit of Peter they found was his finger.\rquote 
\par \lquote Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or some\-thing! He\rquote s been in my family for ages, right \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Twelve years, in fact,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote Didn\rquote t you ever wonder why he was living so long?\rquote 
\par \lquote We \endash  we\rquote ve been taking good care of him!\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote I\rquote d guess he\rquote s been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again ...\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s been scared of that mad cat!\rquote  said Ron, nodding towards Crookshanks, who was still purring on the bed.
\par But that wasn\rquote t right, Harry thought suddenly ... Scabbers had been looking ill before he met Crookshanks ... ever since Ron\rquote s return from Egypt ... since the time when Black had escaped ...
\par \lquote This cat isn\rquote t mad,\rquote  said Black hoarsely. He reached out a bony hand and stroked Crookshanks\rquote s fluffy head. \lquote He\rquote s the most intelligent of his kind I\rquote 
ve ever met. He recognised Peter for what he was straight away. And when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while before he trusted me. Finally, I managed to communicate to him what I was after, and he\rquote s been helping me ...\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you mean?\rquote  breathed Hermione.
\par \lquote He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn\rquote t ... so he stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me ... As I understand it, he took them from a boy\rquote s bedside table ...\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing. It was absurd ... and yet ...
\par \lquote But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it ... this cat \endash  Crookshanks, did you call him? \endash  told me Peter had left blood on the sheets ... I suppose he bit himself ... well, faking his own death had worked once ...\rquote 

\par These words jolted Harry to his senses.
\par \lquote And why did he fake his death?\rquote  he said furiously. \lquote Because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parents!\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote Harry \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote And now you\rquote ve come to finish him off!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I have,\rquote  said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers.
\par \lquote Then I should\rquote ve let Snape take you!\rquote  Harry shouted.
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  said Lupin hurriedly, \lquote don\rquote t you see? All this time we\rquote ve thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down \endash  but it was the other way around, don\rquote t you see? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37

\par \lquote THAT\rquote S NOT TRUE!\rquote  Harry yelled. \lquote HE WAS THEIR SECRET KEEPER! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU TURNED UP, HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!\rquote 
\par He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes were suddenly over-bright.
\par \lquote Harry ... I as good as killed them,\rquote  he croaked. \lquote I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret Keeper instead of me ... I\rquote 
m to blame, I know it ... the night they died, I\rquote d arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe, but when I arrived at his hiding place, he\rquote d gone. Yet there was no sign of a struggle. It didn\rquote t 
feel right. I was scared. I set out for your parents\rquote  house straight away. And when I saw their house, destroyed, and their bodies \endash  I realised what Peter must have done. What I\rquote d done.\rquote 
\par His voice broke. He turned away.
\par \lquote Enough of this,\rquote  said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice Harry had never heard before. \lquote There\rquote s one certain way to prove what really happened. Ron, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 give me that rat.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
\par \lquote What are you going to do with him if I give him to you?\rquote  Ron asked Lupin tensely.
\par \lquote Force him to show himself,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote If he really is a rat, it won\rquote t hurt him.\rquote 
\par Ron hesitated, then at long last held out Scabbers and Lupin took him. Scabbers began to squeak without stopping, twisting and turning, his tiny black eyes bulging in his head.
\par \lquote Ready, Sirius?\rquote  said Lupin.
\par Black had already retrieved Snape\rquote s wand from the bed. He approached Lupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes sud\-denly seemed to be burning in his face.
\par \lquote Together?\rquote  he said quietly.
\par \lquote I think so,\rquote  said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other. \lquote On the count of three. One \endash  two \endash  THREE!\rquote 
\par A flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands; for a moment, Scabbers was frozen in mid-air, his small black form twisting madly \endash  Ron yelled \endash  the rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding flash of light and then \endash 

\par It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree. A head was shooting upwards from the ground; limbs were sprout\-ing; next moment, a man was standing where Scabbers had been, cringing and wringin
g his hands. Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed, the hair on his back standing up.
\par He was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry and Hermione. His thin, colourless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top. He had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who had lost a lot of weight in a short time. His skin looked grub
by, almost like Scabbers\rquote s fur, and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose, his very small, watery eyes. He looked around at them all, his breathing fast and shallow. Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again.
\par \lquote Well, hello, Peter,\rquote  said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats fre\-quently erupted into old schoolfriends around him. \lquote Long time, no see.\rquote 
\par \lquote S-Sirius ... R-Remus ...\rquote  Even Pettigrew\rquote s voice was squeaky. Again, his eyes darted towards the door. \lquote My friends ... my old friends ...\rquote 
\par Black\rquote s wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him a warning look, then turned again to Pettigrew, his voice light and casual.
\par \lquote We\rquote ve been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night Lily and James died. You might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Remus,\rquote  gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face, \lquote you don\rquote t believe him, do you ... He tried to kill me, Remus ...\rquote 
\par \lquote So we\rquote ve heard,\rquote  said Lupin, more coldly. \lquote I\rquote d like to clear up one or two little matters with you, Peter, if you\rquote d be so \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s come to try and kill me again!\rquote  Pettigrew shrieked sudden\-ly, pointing at Black, and Harry saw that he used his middle finger, because his index was missing. \lquote He killed Lily and James and now he\rquote 
s going to kill me, too ... you\rquote ve got to help me, Remus ...\rquote 
\par Black\rquote s face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew with his fathomless eyes.
\par \lquote No one\rquote s going to try and kill you until we\rquote ve sorted a few things out,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par \lquote Sorted things out?\rquote  squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once more, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again, the only door. \lquote I knew he\rquote d come after me! I knew he\rquote d be back for me! I\rquote ve been waiting
 for this for twelve years!\rquote 
\par \lquote You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?\rquote  said Lupin, his brow furrowed. \lquote When nobody has ever done it before?\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s got Dark powers the rest of us can only dream of!\rquote  Pettigrew shouted shrilly. \lquote How else did he get out of there? I sup\-pose He Who Must Not Be Named taught him a few tricks!\rquote 
\par Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh that filled the whole room.
\par \lquote Voldemort, teach me tricks?\rquote  he said.
\par Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him.
\par \lquote What, scared to hear your old master\rquote s name?\rquote  said Black. \lquote I don\rquote t blame you, Peter. His lot aren\rquote t very happy with you, are they?\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t know \endash  what you mean, Sirius \endash \rquote  muttered Pettigrew, his breathing faster than ever. His whole face was shining with sweat now.
\par \lquote You haven\rquote t been hiding from }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 me }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 for twelve years,\rquote 
 said Black. \lquote You\rquote ve been hiding from Voldemort\rquote s old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban, Peter ... they all think you\rquote re dead, or you\rquote d have to answer to them ... I\rquote ve heard them scream
ing all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went to the Potters\rquote  on your information ... and Voldemort met his downfall there. And not all Voldemort\rquote 
s supporters ended up in Azkaban, did they? There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they\rquote ve seen the error of their ways ... If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t know ... what you\rquote re talking about ...\rquote  said Pettigrew again, more shrilly than ever. He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at Lupin. \lquote You don\rquote t believe this \endash  this madness, Remus \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat,\rquote  said Lupin evenly.
\par \lquote Innocent, but scared!\rquote  squealed Pettigrew. \lquote If Voldemort\rquote s sup\-porters were after me, it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban \endash  the spy, Sirius Black!\rquote 
\par Black\rquote s face contorted.
\par \lquote How dare you,\rquote  he growled, sounding suddenly like the bear-sized dog he had been. \lquote I, a spy for Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself? But you, Peter \endash  I\rquote 
ll never understand why I didn\rquote t see you were the spy from the start. You always liked big friends who\rquote d look after you, didn\rquote t you? It used to be us ... me and Remus ... and James ...\rquote 
\par Pettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting for breath.
\par \lquote Me, a spy ... must be out of your mind ... never ... don\rquote t know how you can say such a \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper because I suggest\-ed it,\rquote  Black hissed, so venomously that Pettigrew took a step backwards. \lquote 
I thought it was the perfect plan ... a bluff ... Voldemort would be sure to come after me, would never dream they\rquote d use a weak, talentless thing l
ike you ... it must have been the finest moment of your miserable life, telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters.\rquote 
\par Pettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught words like \lquote far-fetched\rquote  and \lquote lunacy\rquote , but he couldn\rquote t help paying more atten\-tion to the ashen colour of Pettigrew\rquote 
s face, and the way his eyes continued to dart towards the windows and door.
\par \lquote Professor Lupin?\rquote  said Hermione timidly. \lquote Can \endash  can I say something?\rquote 
\par \lquote Certainly, Hermione,\rquote  said Lupin courteously.
\par \lquote Well \endash  Scabbers \endash  I mean, this \endash  this man \endash  he\rquote s been sleeping in Harry\rquote s dormitory for three years. If he\rquote s working for You Know Who, how come he never tried to hurt Harry before now?\rquote 

\par \lquote There!\rquote  said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Hermione with his maimed hand. \lquote Thank you! You see, Remus? I have never hurt a hair of Harry\rquote s head! Why should I?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll tell you why,\rquote  said Black. \lquote Because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you. Voldemort\rquote s been in hiding for twelve years, they say he\rquote s half-dead. You weren\rquote 
t about to commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore\rquote s nose, for a wreck of a wizard who\rquote d lost all his power, were you? You\rquote d want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him, wouldn
\rquote t you? Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in? Keeping an ear out for news, weren\rquote t you, Peter? Just in case your old protector regained strength, and it was safe to rejoin him ...\rquote 
\par Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times. He seemed to have lost the ability to talk.
\par \lquote Er \endash  Mr Black \endash  Sirius?\rquote  said Hermione timidly.
\par Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at Hermione as though being spoken to politely was something he\rquote d long forgotten.
\par \lquote If you don\rquote t mind me asking, how \endash  how did you get out of Azkaban, if you didn\rquote t use Dark Magic?\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you!\rquote  gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at her. \lquote Exactly! Precisely what I \endash \rquote 
\par But Lupin silenced him with a look. Black was frowning slight\-ly at Hermione, but not as though he was annoyed with her. He seemed to be pondering his answer.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know how I did it,\rquote  he said slowly. \lquote I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn\rquote t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldn\rquote t suck it out of me ... but it
 kept me sane and knowing who I am ... helped me keep my powers ... so when it all became ... too much ... I could transform in my cell ... become a dog. Dementors can\rquote t see, you know ...\rquote  He swallowed. \lquote 
They feel their way towards people by sensing their emotions ... they could tell that my feelings were less \endash 
 less human, less complex when I was a dog ... but they thought, of course, that I was losing my mind like everyone else in there, so it didn\rquote t trouble them. But I was weak, very weak, and I had no h
ope of driving them away from me without a wand ...
\par \lquote But then I saw Peter in that picture ... I realised he was at Hogwarts with Harry ... perfectly positioned to act, if one hint reached his ears that the Dark Side was gathering strength again ...\rquote 
\par Pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing noiselessly, but star\-ing all the while at Black as though hypnotised.
\par \lquote ... ready to strike the moment he could be sure of allies ... to deliver the last Potter to them. If he gave them Harry, who\rquote d dare say he\rquote d betrayed Lord Voldemort? He\rquote d be welcomed back with honours ...
\par \lquote So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who knew Peter was still alive ...\rquote 
\par Harry remembered what Mr Weasley had told Mrs Weasley. \lquote The guards say he\rquote s been talking in his sleep ... always the same words ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \'93He\rquote

\par \lquote It was as if someone had lit a fire in my head, and the Dementors couldn\rquote t destroy it ... it wasn\rquote t a happy feeling ... it was an obsession ... but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night when the
y opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as a dog ... it\rquote 
s so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused ... I was thin, very thin ... thin enough to slip through the bars ... I swam as a dog back to the mainland ... I
 journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog ... I\rquote ve been living in the Forest ever since ... except when I come to watch the Quidditch, of course ... you fly as well as your father did, Harry ...\rquote 
\par He looked at Harry, who did not look away.
\par \lquote Believe me,\rquote  croaked Black. \lquote Believe me. I never betrayed James and Lily. I would have died before I betrayed them.\rquote 
\par And at long last, Harry believed him. Throat too tight to speak, he nodded.
\par \lquote No!\rquote 
\par Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry\rquote s nod had been his own death sentence. He shuffled forward on his knees, grovelling, his hands clasped in front of him as though praying.
\par \lquote Sirius \endash  it\rquote s me ... it\rquote s Peter ... your friend ... you wouldn\rquote t ...\rquote 
\par Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled.
\par \lquote There\rquote s enough filth on my robes without you touching them,\rquote  said Black.
\par \lquote Remus!\rquote  Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin instead, writhing imploringly in front of him. \lquote You don\rquote t believe this ... Wouldn\rquote t Sirius have told you they\rquote d changed the plan?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote I assume that\rquote s why you didn\rquote t tell me, Sirius?\rquote  he said casually over Pettigrew\rquote s head.
\par \lquote Forgive me, Remus,\rquote  said Black.
\par \lquote Not at all, Padfoot, old friend,\rquote  said Lupin, who was now rolling up his sleeves. \lquote And will you, in turn, forgive me for believ\-ing }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 you }{

\par \lquote Of course,\rquote  said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face. He, too, began rolling up his sleeves. \lquote Shall we kill him together?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I think so,\rquote  said Lupin grimly.
\par \lquote You wouldn\rquote t ... you won\rquote t ...\rquote  gasped Pettigrew. And he scram\-bled around to Ron.
\par \lquote Ron ... haven\rquote t I been a good friend ... a good pet? You won\rquote t let them kill me, Ron, will you ... you\rquote re on my side, aren\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion.
\par \lquote I let you sleep in my }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 bed!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 he said.

\par \lquote If you made a better rat than human, it\rquote s not much to boast about, Peter,\rquote  said Black harshly. Ron, going still paler with pain, wrenched his broken leg out of Pettigrew\rquote 
s reach. Pettigrew turned on his knees, staggered forwards and seized the hem of Hermione\rquote s robes.
\par \lquote Sweet girl ... clever girl ... you \endash  you won\rquote t let them ... help me ...\rquote 
\par Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew\rquote s clutching hands and backed away against the wall, looking horrified.
\par Pettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and turned his head slowly towards Harry.
\par \lquote Harry ... Harry ... you look just like your father ... just like him ...\rquote 
\par \lquote HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?\rquote  roared Black. \lquote HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM? HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM?\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  whispered Pettigrew, shuffling towards him, hands outstretched, \lquote Harry, James wouldn\rquote t have wanted me killed ... James would have understood, Harry ... he would have shown me mercy ...\rquote 
\par Both Black and Lupin strode forwards, seized Pettigrew\rquote s shoul\-ders and threw him backwards onto the floor. He sat there, twitching with terror, staring up at them.
\par \lquote You sold Lily and James to Voldemort,\rquote  said Black, who was shaking too. \lquote Do you deny it?\rquote 
\par Pettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch: he looked like an oversized, balding baby, cowering on the floor.
\par \lquote Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord ... you have no idea ... he has weapons you can\rquote 
t imagine ... I was scared, Sirius, I was never brave like you and Remus and James. I never meant it to happen ... He Who Must Not Be Named forced me \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote DON\rquote T LIE!\rquote  bellowed Black. \lquote YOU\rquote D BEEN PASSING INFOR\-MATION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!\rquote 
\par \lquote He \endash  he was taking over everywhere!\rquote  gasped Pettigrew. \lquote Wh-what was there to be gained by refusing him?\rquote 
\par What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed?\rquote  said Black, with a terrible fury in his face. \lquote Only innocent lives, Peter!\rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t understand!\rquote  whined Pettigrew. \lquote He would have killed me, Sirius!\rquote 
\par \lquote THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!\rquote  roared Black. \lquote DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS, AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!\rquote 
\par Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands raised.
\par \lquote You should have realised,\rquote  said Lupin quietly. \lquote If Voldemort didn\rquote t kill you, we would. Goodbye, Peter.\rquote 
\par Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall.
\par \lquote NO!\rquote  Harry yelled. He ran forwards, placing himself in front of Pettigrew, facing the wands. \lquote You can\rquote t kill him,\rquote  he said breathless\-ly. \lquote You can\rquote t.\rquote 
\par Black and Lupin both looked staggered.
\par \lquote Harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents,\rquote  Black snarled. \lquote 
This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die, too, without turning a hair. You heard him. His own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family.\rquote 
\par \lquote I know,\rquote  Harry panted. \lquote We\rquote ll take him up to the castle. We\rquote ll hand him over to the Dementors. He can go to Azkaban ... just don\rquote t kill him.\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms around Harry\rquote s knees. \lquote You \endash  thank you \endash  it\rquote s more than I deserve \endash  thank you \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Get off me,\rquote  Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew\rquote s hands off him in disgust. \lquote I\rquote m not doing this for you. I\rquote m doing it because I don\rquote t reckon my dad would\rquote ve wanted his best friends to become killers 
\endash  just for you.\rquote 
\par No one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew, whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest. Black and Lupin were looking at each other. Then, with one movement, they low\-ered their wands.
\par \lquote You\rquote re the only person who has the right to decide, Harry,\rquote  said Black. \lquote But think ... think what he did ...\rquote 
\par \lquote He can go to Azkaban,\rquote  Harry repeated. \lquote If anyone deserves that place, he does ...\rquote 
\par Pettigrew was still wheezing behind him.
\par \lquote Very well,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote Stand aside, Harry.\rquote 
\par Harry hesitated.
\par \lquote I\rquote m going to tie him up,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote That\rquote s all, I swear.\rquote 
\par Harry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from Lupin\rquote s wand this time, and next moment, Pettigrew was wriggling on the floor, bound and gagged.
\par \lquote But if you transform, Peter,\rquote  growled Black, his own wand pointing at Pettigrew, too, \lquote we }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 will}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196  kill you. You agree, Harry?\rquote 
\par Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor, and nodded so that Pettigrew could see him.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Lupin, suddenly business-like. \lquote Ron, I can\rquote t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it\rquote s best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.\rquote 
\par He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron\rquote s leg with his wand and muttered, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Ferula.\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Bandages spun up Ron\rquote s leg, strap\-ping it tightly to a splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didn\rquote t wince.
\par \lquote That\rquote s better,\rquote  he said. \lquote Thanks.\rquote 
\par \lquote What about Professor Snape?\rquote  said Hermione in a small voice, looking down at Snape\rquote s prone figure.
\par \lquote There\rquote s nothing seriously wrong with him,\rquote  said Lupin, bending over Snape and checking his pulse. \lquote You were just a little \endash  over-enthusiastic. Still out cold. Er \endash  perhaps it will be best if we don\rquote 
t revive him until we\rquote re safely back in the castle. We can take him like this ...\rquote 
\par He muttered, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Mobilicorpus.\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 As though invisible strings were tied 
to Snape\rquote 
s wrists, neck and knees, he was pulled into a standing position, head still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. He hung a few inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling. Lupin picked up the Invisibility Cloak and tucked it safely 
into his pocket.
\par \lquote And two of us should be chained to this,\rquote  said Black, nudging Pettigrew with his toe. \lquote Just to make sure.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll do it,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par \lquote And me,\rquote  said Ron savagely, limping forwards.
\par Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon Pettigrew was upright again, left arm chained to Lupin\rquote s right, right arm to Ron\rquote s left. Ron\rquote s face was set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers\rquote 
s true identity as a personal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room, his bottle-brush tail held jauntily high.

Harry had never been part of a stranger group. Crookshanks led the way down the stairs; Lupin, Pettigrew and Ron went next, looking like contestants in a six-legged race. Next ca
me Professor Snape, drifting creepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they descended, held up by his own wand, which was being pointed at him by Sirius. Harry and Hermione brought up the rear.

rew and Ron had to turn sideways to manage it; Lupin still had Pettigrew covered with his wand. Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in single file. Crookshanks was still in the lead. Harry went right after Sirius, who was still making S
nape drift along ahead of them; he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry had the impression Sirius was making no effort to prevent this.
\par \lquote You know what this means?\rquote  Sirius said abruptly to Harry, as they made their slow progress along the tunnel. \lquote Turning Pettigrew in?\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re free,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Yes ...\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote But I\rquote m also \endash  I don\rquote t know if anyone ever told you \endash  I\rquote m your godfather.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I knew that,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well ... your parents appointed me your guardian,\rquote  said Sirius stiffly. \lquote If anything happened to them ...\rquote 
\par Harry waited. Did Sirius mean what he thought he meant?
\par \lquote I\rquote ll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote But ... well ... think about it. Once my name\rquote s cleared ... if you wanted a ... a different home ...\rquote 
\par Some sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry\rquote s stomach.
\par \lquote What \endash  live with you?\rquote  he said, accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling. \lquote Leave the Dursleys?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course, I thought you wouldn\rquote t want to,\rquote  said Sirius quickly. \lquote I understand. I just thought I\rquote d \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Are you mad?\rquote  said Harry, his voice easily as croaky as Sirius\rquote . \lquote Of course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can I move in?\rquote 
\par Sirius turned right around to look at him; Snape\rquote s head was scraping the ceiling but Sirius didn\rquote t seem to care.
\par \lquote You want to?\rquote  he said. \lquote You mean it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I mean it!\rquote  said Harry.
\par Sirius\rquote  gaunt face broke into the first true smile Harry had seen upon it. The difference it made wa
s startling, as though a person ten years younger was shining through the starved mask; for a moment, he was recognisable as the man who had laughed at Harry\rquote s parents\rquote  wedding.
\par They did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel. Crookshanks darted up first; he had evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the trunk, because Lupin, Pettigrew and Ron clambered upwards without any sound of savaging branches.

\par Sirius saw Snape up through the hole, then stood back for Harry and Hermione to pass. At last, all of them were out.
\par The grounds were very dark now, the only light came from the distant windows of the castle. Without a word, they set off. Pettigrew was still wheezing and occasionally whimpering. Harry\rquote 
s mind was buzzing. He was going to leave the Dursleys. He was going to live with Sirius Black, his parents\rquote  best friend ... he felt dazed ... What would happen when he told the Dursleys he was going to live with the convict they\rquote 
d seen on television?
\par \lquote One wrong move, Peter,\rquote  said Lupin threateningly, ahead. His wand was still pointed sideways at Pettigrew\rquote s chest.
\par Silently they tramped through the grounds, the castle lights growing slowly larger. Snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of Sirius, his chin bumping on his chest. And then \endash 
\par A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground. Their party was bathed in moonlight.
\par Snape collided with Lupin, Pettigrew and Ron, who had stopped abruptly. Sirius froze. He flung out an arm to make Harry and Hermione stop.
\par Harry could see Lupin\rquote s silhouette. He had gone rigid. Then his limbs began to shake.
\par \lquote Oh my \endash \rquote  Hermione gasped. \lquote He didn\rquote t take his Potion tonight! He\rquote s not safe!\rquote 
\par \lquote Run,\rquote  Sirius whispered. \lquote Run! Now!\rquote 
\par But Harry couldn\rquote t run. Ron was chained to Pettigrew and Lupin. He leapt forwards but Sirius caught him around the chest and threw him back.
\par \lquote Leave it to me \endash  RUN!\rquote 
\par There was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin\rquote s head was lengthen\-ing. So was his body. His shoulders were hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands, which were curling into clawed paws. Crookshanks\rquote 
s fur was on end again, he was backing away \endash 
\par As the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius disap\-peared from Harry\rquote 
s side. He had transformed. The enormous, bear-like dog bounded forwards. As the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it, the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backwards, away from Ron and Pettigrew. They were locked, jaw to jaw, 
claws ripping at each other \endash 
\par Harry stood, transfixed by the sight; too intent upon the battle to notice anything else. It was Hermione\rquote s scream that alerted him \endash 
\par Pettigrew had dived for Lupin\rquote s dropped wand. Ron, unsteady on his bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang, a burst of light \endash  and Ron lay motionless on the ground. Another bang \endash 
 Crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heap.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Expelliarmus!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Pettigrew; Lupin\rquote s wand flew high into the air and out of sight. \lquote Stay where you are!\rquote  Harry shouted, running forwards.
\par Too late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on Ron\rquote s outstretched arm, and heard a scurrying through the grass.
\par There was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned to see the werewolf taking flight; it was galloping into the Forest \endash 
\par \lquote Sirius, he\rquote s gone, Pettigrew transformed!\rquote  Harry yelled.
\par Sirius was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back, but at Harry\rquote s words he scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound of his paws was fading to silence as he pounded away across the grounds.
\par Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron.
\par \lquote What did he do to him?\rquote  Hermione whispered. Ron\rquote s eyes were only half-closed; his mouth hung open. He was definitely alive, they could hear him breathing, but he didn\rquote t seem to recognise them.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know.\rquote 
\par Harry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin both gone ... they had no one but Snape for company, still hanging, uncon\-scious, in mid-air.
\par \lquote We\rquote d better get them up to the castle and tell someone,\rquote  said Harry, pushing his hair out of his eyes, trying to think straight. \lquote Come \endash \rquote 
\par But then, out of the darkness, they heard a yelping, a whining; a dog in pain ...
\par \lquote Sirius,\rquote  Harry muttered, staring into the darkness.
\par He had a moment\rquote s indecision, but there was nothing they could do for Ron at the moment, and by the sound of it, Black was in trouble \endash 
\par Harry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him. The yelping seemed to be coming from near the lake. They pelted towards it, and Harry, running flat out, felt the cold without realising what it must mean \endash 
\par The yelping stopped abruptly. As they reached the lake\rquote s shore they saw why \endash  Sirius had turned back into a man. He was crouched on all fours, his hands over his head.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Nooo,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 he moaned. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par And then Harry saw them. Dementors, at least a hundred of them, gliding in a black mass around
 the lake towards them. He spun around, the familiar, icy cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure his vision; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side; they were encircling them ...
\par \lquote Hermione, think of something happy!\rquote  Harry yelled, raising his wand, blinking furiously to try and clear his vision, shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it \endash

\par Black gave a shudder, rolled over and lay motionless on the ground, pale as death.

\par By the feeble light of his formless Patronus, he saw a Dementor halt, very close to him. It couldn\rquote t walk through the cloud of sil\-

\par Where there should have been eyes, there was only thin, grey, scabbed skin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But there was a mouth ... a gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death-rattle.

\par But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly wrapped them\-selves around Harry\rquote s neck. They were forcing his face upwards ... he could feel its breath ... it was going to get rid of 
him first ... he could feel its putrid breath ... his mother was screaming in his ears ... she was going to be the last thing he ever heard \endash 
\par And then, through the fog that was drowning him, he thought he saw a silvery light, growing brighter and brighter ... he felt himself fall forwards onto the grass \endash 
\par Face down, too weak to move, sick and shaking, Harry opened his eyes. The blinding light was illuminating the grass around him ... The screaming had stopped, the cold was ebbing away ...
\par Something was driving the Dementors back ... it was circling around him and Sirius and Hermione ... the rattling, sucking sounds of the Dementors were fading. They were leaving ... the air was warm again ...
\par With every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry raised his hea
d a few inches and saw an animal amidst the light, galloping away across the lake. Eyes blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out what it was ... it was bright as a unicorn. Fighting to stay conscious, Harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the
 opposite shore. For a moment, Harry saw, by its brightness, some\-body welcoming it back ... raising his hand to pat it ... someone who looked strangely familiar ... but it couldn\rquote t be ...
\par Harry didn\rquote t understand. He couldn\rquote t think any more. He felt the last of his strength leave him, and his head hit the ground as he fainted.

\par \lquote Well, well ... we shall see, Snape, we shall see ... the boy has undoubtedly been foolish ...\rquote 
\par Harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut. He felt very groggy. The words he was hearing seemed to be travelling very slowly from his ears to his brain, so that it was difficult to understand. His limbs felt like lead; hi

\par \lquote What amazes me most is the behaviour of the Dementors ... you\rquote ve really no idea what made them retreat, Snape?\rquote

\par \lquote All unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound and gagged Black, naturally, conjured stretchers and brought them all straight back to the castle.\rquote 
\par There was a pause. Harry\rquote s brain seemed to be moving a little faster, and as it did, a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach ...
\par He opened his eyes.
\par Everything was slightly blurred. Somebody had removed his glasses. He was lying in the dark hospital wing. At the very end of the ward, he could make out Madam Pomfrey with her back to him, bending over a bed. Harry squinted. Ron\rquote 
s red hair was visi\-ble beneath Madam Pomfrey\rquote s arm.
\par Harry moved his head over on the pillow. In the bed to his right lay Hermione. Moonlight was falling across her bed. Her eyes were open, too. She looked petrified, and when she saw that Harry was awake, pressed a finger to her li
ps, then pointed to the hospital-wing door. It was ajar, and the voices of Cornelius Fudge and Snape were coming through it from the corridor outside.
\par Madam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to Harry\rquote s bed. He turned to look at her. She was carrying the largest block of chocolate he had ever seen in his life. It looked like a small boulder.
\par \lquote Ah, you\rquote re awake!\rquote  she said briskly. She placed the chocolate on Harry\rquote s bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer.
\par \lquote How\rquote s Ron?\rquote  said Harry and Hermione together.
\par \lquote He\rquote ll live,\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey grimly. \lquote As for you two ... you\rquote ll be staying here until I\rquote m satisfied you\rquote re \endash  Potter, what do you think you\rquote re doing?\rquote 
\par Harry was sitting up, putting his glasses back on and picking up his wand.
\par \lquote I need to see the Headmaster,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote Potter,\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, \lquote it\rquote s all right. They\rquote ve got Black. He\rquote s locked away upstairs. The Dementors will be per\-forming the Kiss any moment now \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote WHAT?\rquote 
\par Harry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the same. But his shout had been heard in the corridor outside; next second, Cornelius Fudge and Snape had entered the ward.
\par \lquote Harry, Harry, what\rquote s this?\rquote  said Fudge, looking agitated. \lquote You should be in bed \endash  has he had any chocolate?\rquote  he asked Madam Pomfrey anxiously.
\par \lquote Minister, listen!\rquote  Harry said. \lquote Sirius Black\rquote s innocent! Peter Pettigrew faked his own death! We saw him tonight! You can\rquote t let the Dementors do that thing to Sirius, he\rquote s \endash \rquote 
\par But Fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face.
\par \lquote Harry, Harry, you\rquote re very confused, you\rquote ve been through a dreadful ordeal, lie back down, now, we\rquote ve got everything under control ...\rquote 
\par \lquote YOU HAVEN\rquote T!\rquote  Harry yelled. \lquote YOU\rquote VE GOT THE WRONG MAN!\rquote

\par \lquote WE\rquote RE NOT CONFUNDED!\rquote  Harry roared.
\par \lquote Minister! Professor!\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey angrily. \lquote I must insist that you leave. Potter is my patient, and he should not be distressed!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not distressed, I\rquote m trying to tell them what happened!\rquote  Harry said furiously. \lquote If they\rquote d just listen \endash \rquote 
\par But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of choco\-late into Harry\rquote s mouth. He choked, and she seized the opportun\-ity to force him back onto the bed.
\par \lquote Now, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 please, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Minister, these children need care. Please leave \endash

\par \lquote For heaven\rquote s sake!\rquote  said Madam Pomfrey hysterically. \lquote Is this a hospital wing or not? Headmaster, I must insist \endash \rquote

\par \lquote That, indeed, is Black\rquote s story,\rquote  said Dumbledore, surveying Snape closely through his half-moon spectacles.
\par \lquote And does my evidence count for nothing?\rquote  snarled Snape. \lquote Peter Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack, nor did I see any sign of him in the grounds.\rquote 
\par \lquote That was because you were knocked out, Professor!\rquote  said Hermione earnestly. \lquote You didn\rquote t arrive in time to hear \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!\rquote 
\par \lquote Now, Snape,\rquote  said Fudge, startled, \lquote the young lady is disturbed in her mind, we must make allowances \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,\rquote  said Dumbledore abruptly. \lquote Cornelius, Severus, Poppy \endash  please leave us.\rquote 
\par \lquote Headmaster!\rquote  spluttered Madam Pomfrey. \lquote They need treat\-ment, they need rest \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote This cannot wait,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I must insist.\rquote 
\par Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end of the ward, slamming the door behind her. Fudge con\-sulted the large gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat.
\par \lquote The Dementors should have arrived by now,\rquote  he said. \lquote I\rquote ll go and meet them. Dumbledore, I\rquote ll see you upstairs.\rquote 
\par He crossed to the door and held it open for Snape, but Snape hadn\rquote t moved.

\par \lquote I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,\rquote  Dumbledore repeated.

\par \lquote It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not interrupt me, because there is very little time,\rquote  he said quietly. \lquote There is not a shred of proof to support Black\rquote s story, except your word \endash

\par \lquote Professor Lupin can tell you \endash \rquote  Harry said, unable to stop himself.
\par \lquote Professor Lupin is currently deep in the Forest, unable to tell anyone anything. By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Sirius will

\par She had thrown the chain around his neck, too.
\par \lquote Ready?\rquote  she said breathlessly.
\par \lquote What are we doing?\rquote  Harry said, completely lost.
\par Hermione turned the hour-glass over three times.
\par The dark ward dissolved. Harry had the sensation that he was flying, very fast, backwards. A blur of colours and shapes rushed past him; his ears were pounding. He tried to yell but couldn\rquote t hear his own voice \endash 
\par And then he felt solid ground beneath his feet, and everything came into focus again \endash 
\par He was standing next to Hermione in the deserted Entrance Hall and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors. He looked wildly around at Hermione, the chain of the hour-glass cutting into his neck.
\par \lquote Hermione, what \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote In here!\rquote  Hermione seized Harry\rquote s arm and dragged him across the hall to the door of a broom cupboard; she opened it, pushed him inside amongst the buckets and mops, followed him in, then slammed the door behind them.

\par \lquote We\rquote ve gone back in time,\rquote  Hermione whispered, lifting the chain off Harry\rquote s neck in the darkness. \lquote Three hours back ...\rquote

\par Harry stared at her shadowy face.
\par \lquote There must be something that happened around now he wants us to change,\rquote  he said slowly. \lquote What happened? We were walking down to Hagrid\rquote s three hours ago ...\rquote

\par Harry frowned; he felt as though he was screwing up his whole brain in concentration.
\par \lquote Dumbledore just said \endash  just said we could save more than one innocent life ...\rquote  And then it hit him. \lquote Hermione, we\rquote re going to save Buckbeak!\rquote 
\par \lquote But \endash  how will that help Sirius?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore said \endash  he just told us where the window is \endash  the window of Flitwick\rquote s office! Where they\rquote ve got Sirius locked up! We\rquote ve got to fly Buck

\par From what Harry could see of Hermione\rquote s face, she looked terrified.
\par \lquote If we manage that without being seen, it\rquote ll be a miracle!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, we\rquote ve got to try, haven\rquote t we?\rquote  said Harry. He stood up and pressed his own ear against the door.
\par \lquote Doesn\rquote t sound like anyone\rquote s there ... come on, let\rquote s go ...\rquote 
\par Harry pushed the cupboard door open. The Entrance Hall was deserted. As quietly and quickly as they could, they darted
 out of the cupboard and down the stone steps. The shadows were already lengthening, the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once more with gold.
\par \lquote If anyone\rquote s looking out of the window \endash \rquote  Hermione squeaked, looking up at the castle behind them.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll run for it,\rquote  said Harry determinedly. \lquote Straight into the Forest, all right? We\rquote ll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote OK, but we\rquote ll go round by the greenhouses!\rquote  said Hermione breathlessly. \lquote We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid\rquote s front door, or we\rquote ll see us! We must be nearly at Hagrid\rquote s by now!\rquote 
\par Still working out what she meant, Harry set off a
t a sprint, Hermione behind him. They tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses, paused for a moment behind them, then set off again, fast as they could, skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing towards the shelter of the Forest ...
\par Safe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned around; seconds later, Hermione arrived beside him, panting.
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  she gasped, \lquote we need to sneak over to Hagrid\rquote s. Keep out of sight, Harry ...\rquote 
\par They made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edge of the Forest. Then, as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid\rquote 
s house, they heard a knock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side. Hagrid had appeared in his doorway, shaking and white, looking around to see who had knocked. And Harry heard his own voice.
\par \lquote It\rquote s us. We\rquote re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeh shouldn\rquote ve come!\rquote  Hagrid whispered. He stood back, then shut the door quickly.
\par \lquote This is the weirdest thing we\rquote ve ever done,\rquote  Harry said fervently.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s move along a bit,\rquote  Hermione whispered. \lquote We need to get nearer to Buckbeak!\rquote 
\par They crept through the trees until they saw the nervous Hippogriff, tethered to the fence around Hagrid\rquote s pumpkin patch.
\par \lquote Now?\rquote  Harry whispered.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote If we steal him now, those Committee people will think Hagrid set him free! We\rquote ve got to wait until they\rquote ve seen he\rquote s tied outside!\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s going to give us about sixty seconds,\rquote  said Harry. This was starting to seem impossible.
\par At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid\rquote s cabin.
\par \lquote That\rquote s Hagrid breaking the milk jug,\rquote  Hermione whispered. \lquote I\rquote m going to find Scabbers in a moment \endash \rquote 
\par Sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard Hermione\rquote s shriek of surprise.
\par \lquote Hermione,\rquote  said Harry suddenly, \lquote what if we \endash  we just run in there, and grab Pettigrew \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Hermione in a terrified whisper. \lquote Don\rquote t you under\-stand? We\rquote re breaking one of the most important wizarding laws! Nobody\rquote s supposed to change time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we\rquote re seen 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote d only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, what do you think you\rquote d do if you saw yourself bursting into Hagrid\rquote s house?\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote I\rquote d \endash  I\rquote d think I\rquote d gone mad,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote or I\rquote d think there was some Dark Magic going on \endash \rquote

\par \lquote OK!\rquote  said Harry. \lquote It was just an idea, I just thought \endash \rquote 
\par But Hermione nudged him, and pointed towards the castle. Harry moved his head a few inches to get a clear view of the dis\-tant front doors. Dumbledore, Fudge, the old Committee member and Macnair the executioner were coming down the steps.
\par \lquote We\rquote re about to come out!\rquote  Hermione breathed.
\par And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid\rquote s back door opened, and Harry saw himself, Ron and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid. It was, with
out a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life, standing behind the tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch.
\par \lquote It\rquote s OK, Beaky, it\rquote s OK ...\rquote  Hagrid said to Buckbeak. Then he turned to Harry, Ron and Hermione. \lquote Go on. Get goin\rquote .\rquote 
\par \lquote Hagrid, we can\rquote t \endash \rquote

\par \lquote Go! It\rquote s bad enough without you lot in trouble an\rquote  all!\rquote 
\par Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility Cloak over himself and Ron.
\par \lquote Go quick. Don\rquote  listen ...\rquote 
\par There was a knock on Hagrid\rquote 
s front door. The execution party had arrived. Hagrid turned around and headed back into his cabin, leaving the back door ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retrea
ting. He, Ron and Hermione had gone ... but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happen\-ing inside the cabin through the back door.
\par \lquote Where is the beast?\rquote  came the cold voice of Macnair.
\par \lquote Out \endash  outside,\rquote  Hagrid croaked.
\par Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair\rquote s face appeared at Hagrid\rquote s window, staring out at Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge.
\par \lquote We \endash  er \endash  have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid. I\rquote ll make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, you\rquote re supposed to listen too, that\rquote s procedure \endash \rquote 
\par Macnair\rquote s face vanished from the window. It was now or never.
\par \lquote Wait here,\rquote  Harry whispered to Hermione. \lquote I\rquote ll do it.\rquote 
\par As Fudge\rquote s voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree, vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch and approached Buckbeak.

\par Harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in his front feet.
\par \lquote Well, let\rquote s get this over with,\rquote  said the reedy voice of the Committee member from inside Hagrid\rquote s cabin. \lquote Hagrid, perhaps it would be better if you stayed inside \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, I \endash  I wan\rquote  ter be with him ... I don\rquote  wan\rquote  him ter be alone \endash \rquote

\par Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak\rquote s neck. The Hippogriff began to walk, rustling its wings irritably. They were still ten feet away from the Forest, in plain view of Hagrid\rquote s back door.
\par \lquote One moment, please, Macnair,\rquote  came Dumbledore\rquote s voice. \lquote You need to sign, too.\rquote  The footsteps stopped. Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster.
\par Hermione\rquote s white face was sticking out from behind a tree.
\par \lquote Harry, hurry!\rquote  she mouthed.
\par Harry could still hear Dumbledore\rquote s voice talking from within the cabin. He gave the rope another wrench. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot. They had reached the trees ...
\par \lquote Quick! Quick!\rquote  Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree, seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster. Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they couldn\rquote t see Hagrid
\rquote s garden at all.
\par \lquote Stop!\rquote  he whispered to Hermione. \lquote They might hear us \endash \rquote 
\par Hagrid\rquote s back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione and Buckbeak stood quite still; even the Hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.
\par Silence ... then \endash 
\par \lquote Where is it?\rquote  said the reedy voice of the Committee member. \lquote Where is the beast?\rquote 
\par \lquote It was tied here!\rquote  said the executioner furiously. \lquote I saw it! Just here!\rquote 
\par \lquote How extraordinary,\rquote  said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in his voice.
\par \lquote Beaky!\rquote  said Hagrid huskily.
\par There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The execu\-tioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the howling, and this time they could hear Hagrid\rquote s words through his sobs.
\par \lquote Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 gone! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 Musta pulled him\-

\par Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to Hagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the Forest floor to stop him.
\par \lquote Someone untied him!\rquote  the executioner was snarling. \lquote We should search the grounds, the Forest \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot?\rquote  said Dumbledore, still sounding amused. \lquote Search the skies, if you will ... Hagrid, I

\par \lquote O\rquote  \endash  o\rquote  course, Professor,\rquote  said Hagrid, who sounded weak with happiness. \lquote Come in, come in ...\rquote 
\par Harry and Hermione listened closely. They heard footsteps, the soft cursing of the executioner, the snap of the door, and then silence once more.
\par \lquote Now what?\rquote  whispered Harry, looking around.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll have to hide in here,\rquote  said Hermione, who looked very shaken. \lquote We need to wait until they\rquote ve gone back to the castle. Then we wait until it\rquote s safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius\rquote  window. He won\rquote

\par They moved around the edge of the Forest, darkness falling thickly around them, until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the Willow.

\par \lquote And there we go ...\rquote  Harry muttered. \lquote We\rquote re in.\rquote 
\par The moment they disappeared, the tree began to move again. Seconds later, they heard footsteps quite close by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge and the old Committee member were making their way up to the castle.

\par Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and Snape had come charging out of them, running towards the Willow.
\par Harry\rquote s fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the tree, looking around. He grabbed the Cloak and held it up.

\par He was thinking about his father, and about his three oldest friends ... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs ... Had all four of them been out in the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead \endash 
 was it so impossible his father had done the same? Had he been seeing things across the lake? The figure had been too far away to see distinctly ... yet he had felt sure, for a moment, before he\rquote d lost consciousness ...
\par The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds. Hermione sat with her face turned towards the Willow, waiting.
\par And then, at last, after over an hour ...
\par \lquote Here we come!\rquote  Hermione whispered.
\par She and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his head. They saw Lupin, Ron and Pettigrew c
lambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots, followed by the unconscious Snape, drifting weirdly upwards. Next came Harry, Hermione and Black. Next came Harry and Black. They all began to walk towards the castle.
\par Harry\rquote s heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky. Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon ...
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  Hermione muttered, as though she knew exactly what he was thinking, \lquote we\rquote ve got to stay put. We mustn\rquote t be seen. There\rquote s nothing we can do ...\rquote 
\par \lquote So we\rquote re just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again ...\rquote  said Harry quietly.
\par \lquote How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?\rquote  snapped Hermione. \lquote There\rquote s nothing we can do! We came back to help Sirius. We\rquote re not supposed to be doing anything else!\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote All right!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
\par The moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop. Then they saw movement \endash 
\par \lquote There goes Lupin,\rquote  Hermione whispered. \lquote He\rquote s transforming \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hermione!\rquote  said Harry suddenly. \lquote We\rquote ve got to move!\rquote 
\par \lquote We mustn\rquote t, I keep telling you \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Not to interfere! But Lupin\rquote s going to run into the Forest, right at us!\rquote 
\par Hermione gasped.
\par \lquote Quick!\rquote  she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. \lquote Quick! Where are we going to go? Where are we going to hide? The Dementors will be coming any moment \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Back to Hagrid\rquote s!\rquote  Harry said. \lquote It\rquote s empty now \endash  come on!\rquote 
\par They ran, fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them. They could hear the werewolf howling behind them ...
\par The cabin was in sight. Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open and Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly.
\par \lquote Shh, Fang, it\rquote s us!\rquote  said Hermione, hurrying over and scratch\-ing his ears to quieten him. \lquote That was really close!\rquote  she said to Harry.
\par \lquote Yeah ...\rquote 
\par Harry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside Hagrid\rquote s house. He lay down in front of the fire, folded his wings contentedl
y and seemed ready for a good nap.
\par \lquote I think I\rquote d better go outside again, you know,\rquote  said Harry slow\-ly. \lquote I can\rquote t see what\rquote s going on \endash  we won\rquote t know when it\rquote s time \endash \rquote 
\par Hermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not going to try and interfere,\rquote  said Harry quickly. \lquote But if we don\rquote t see what\rquote s going on, how\rquote re we going to know when it\rquote s time to rescue Sirius?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well ... OK, then ... I\rquote ll wait here with Buckbeak ... but Harry, be careful \endash  there\rquote s a werewolf out there \endash  and the Dementors \endash \rquote 
\par Harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He could hear yelping in the distance. That meant the Dementors were closing in on Sirius ... he and Hermione would be running to him any moment ...
\par Harry stared out towards the lake, his heart doing a kind of drum-roll in his chest. Whoever had sent that Patronus would be appearing at any moment.
\par For a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid\rquote s door. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 You must not be seen. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 But he didn\rquote t want to be seen. He wanted to do the seeing ... he had to know ...
\par And there were the Dementors. They were emerging out of the darkness from every direction, gliding around the edges of the lake ... they were moving away from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank ... he wouldn\rquote t have to get near them ...
\par Harry began to run. He had no thought in his head except his father ... If it was him ... if it really was him ... he had to know, had to find out ...
\par The lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there was no sign of anybody. On the opposite bank, he could see tiny glimmers of silver \endash  his own attempts at a Patronus \endash 
\par There was a bush at the very edge of the water. Harry threw himself behind it, peering desperately through the leaves. On the opposite bank, the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified excitement shot through him \endash 
 any moment now \endash 
\par \lquote Come on!\rquote  he muttered, staring about. \lquote Where are you? Dad, come on \endash \rquote 
\par But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of Dementors across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It was time for the rescuer to appear \endash  but no one was coming to help this time \endash 
\par And then it hit him \endash  he understood. He hadn\rquote t seen his father \endash  he had seen }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 himself \endash }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 
\par Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand.
\par \lquote EXPECTO PATRONUM!\rquote  he yelled.
\par And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but a blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it was. It looked like a horse. It was gal\-loping silently away from him, across the black 
surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming Dementors ... now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the ground, and the Dementors were falling back, scat\-
tering, retreating into the darkness ... they were gone.
\par The Patronus turned. It was cantering back towards Harry across the still surface of the water. It wasn\rquote t a horse. It wasn\rquote t a unicorn, either. It was a stag. It was shining brightly as the moon above ... it was coming back to him ...
\par It stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it stared at Harry with its large, silver eyes. Slowly, it bowed its antlered head. And Harry realised ...
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Prongs,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 he whispered.

\par Harry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with a great leap of his heart, he heard hooves behind him \endash  he whirled around and saw Hermione dashing towards him, dragging Buckbeak behind her.

\par \lquote I don\rquote t know \endash  Harry, look at Snape!\rquote 
\par Together they peered around the bush at the other bank. Snape had regained consciousness. He was conjuring stretchers and lift\-ing the limp forms of Harry, Hermione and Black onto them. A f
ourth stretcher, no doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his side. Then, wand held out in front of him, he moved them away towards the castle.
\par \lquote Right, it\rquote s nearly time,\rquote  said Hermione tensely, looking at her watch. \lquote We\rquote ve got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing. We\rquote 
ve got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realises we\rquote re missing ...\rquote 
\par They waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while the bush next to them whispered in the breeze. Buckbeak, bored, was ferreting for worms again.
\par \lquote D\rquote you reckon he\rquote s up there yet?\rquote  said Harry, checking his watch. He looked up at the castle, and began counting the win\-dows to the right of the West Tower.
\par \lquote Look!\rquote  Hermione whispered. \lquote Who\rquote s that? Someone\rquote s coming back out of the castle!\rquote 
\par Harry stared through the darkness. The man was hurrying across the grounds, towards one of the entrances. Something shiny glinted in his belt.
\par \lquote Macnair!\rquote  said Harry. \lquote The executioner! He\rquote s gone to get the Dementors! This is it, Hermione \endash \rquote 
\par Hermione put her hands on Buckbeak\rquote s back and Harry gave her a leg up. Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak\rquote s rope back over his neck and tied it to
 the other side of his collar like reins.
\par \lquote Ready?\rquote  he whispered to Hermione. \lquote You\rquote d better hold on to me \endash \rquote 
\par He nudged Buckbeak\rquote s sides with his heels.
\par Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped his flanks with his knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them. Hermione was holding Harry very tightly around the waist; he could hear her muttering, \lquote Oh, no \endash 
 I don\rquote t like this \endash  oh, I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 really }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 don\rquote t like this \endash 
\rquote 
\par Harry urged Buckbeak forwards. They were gliding quietly towards the upper floors of the castle ... Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the rope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the windows flashing past \endash 
\par \lquote Whoa!\rquote  he said, pulling backwards as hard as he could.
\par Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless you counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as he beat his wings to remain airborne.
\par \lquote He\rquote s there!\rquote  Harry said, spotting Sirius as they rose up beside the window. He reached out, and as Buckbeak\rquote s wings fell, was able to tap sharply on the glass.
\par Black looked up. Harry saw his jaw drop. He leapt from his chair, hurried to the window and tried to open it, but it was locked.
\par \lquote Stand back!\rquote  Hermione called to him, and she took out her wand, still gripping the back of Harry\rquote s robes with her left hand.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 \lquote Alohomora!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196

s gone to get them.\rquote 
\par Black placed a hand on either side of the window-frame and heaved his head and shoulders out of it. It was very lucky he was so thin. In seconds, he had managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak\rquote 
s back, and pull himself onto the Hippogriff behind Hermione.
\par \lquote OK, Buckbeak, up!\rquote  said Harry, shaking the rope. \lquote Up to the tower \endash  come on!\rquote 
\par The Hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring upwards again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a clatter on the battlements and Harry and Hermione slid off him at once.
\par \lquote Sirius, you\rquote d better go, quick,\rquote  Harry panted. \lquote They\rquote ll reach Flitwick\rquote s office any moment, they\rquote ll find out you\rquote ve gone.\rquote 
\par Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head.
\par \lquote What happened to the other boy? Ron?\rquote  said Sirius urgently.
\par \lquote He\rquote s going to be OK \endash  he\rquote s still out of it, but Madam Pomfrey says she\rquote ll be able to make him better. Quick \endash  go!\rquote 
\par But Black was still staring down at Harry.
\par \lquote How can I ever thank \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote GO!\rquote  Harry and Hermione shouted together.
\par Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll see each other again,\rquote  he said. \lquote You are \endash  truly your father\rquote s son, Harry ...\rquote 
\par He squeezed Buckbeak\rquote 
s sides with his heels. Harry and Hermione jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more ... the Hippogriff took off into the air ... he and his rider became smaller and smaller as Harry gazed after them ... then a cloud drifted 
across the moon ... they were gone.

\par \lquote Professor Dumbledore \endash  yesterday, when I was having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went very \endash  very strange.\rquote 
\par \lquote Indeed?\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Er \endash  stranger than usual, you mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes ... her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said ... she said Voldemort\rquote s servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight ... she said the servant would help him come back to power.\rquote 
 Harry stared up at Dumbledore. \lquote And then she sort of became normal again, and she couldn\rquote t remember anything she\rquote d said. Was it \endash  was she making a real prediction?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore looked mildly impressed.
\par \lquote Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been,\rquote  he said thoughtfully. \lquote Who\rquote d have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. I should offer her a pay rise ...\rquote 
\par \lquote But \endash \rquote  Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so calmly?
\par \lquote But \endash  I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin killing Pettigrew! That makes it my fault, if Voldemort comes back!\rquote 
\par \lquote It does not,\rquote  said Dumbledore quietly. \lquote Hasn\rquote t your experience with the Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The conse\-
quences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed ... Professor Trelawney, bless her, is living proof of that. You did a very noble thing, in saving Pettigrew\rquote s life.
\rquote 
\par \lquote But if he helps Voldemort back to power \endash !\rquote 
\par \lquote Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt. When one wizard saves another wiz\-ard\rquote s life, it creates a certain bond between them ... and I\rquote

\par \lquote I don\rquote t want a bond with Pettigrew!\rquote  said Harry. \lquote He betrayed my parents!\rquote 
\par \lquote This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me ... the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew\rquote s life.\rquote 
\par Harry couldn\rquote t imagine when that would be. Dumbledore looked as though he knew what Harry was thinking.
\par \lquote I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry,\rquote  he said gently. \lquote He would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it.\rquote 
\par Harry looked up at him. Dumbledore wouldn\rquote t laugh \endash  he could tell Dumbledore ...
\par \lquote Last night ... I thought it was my dad who\rquote d conjured my Patronus. I mean, when I saw myself across the lake ... I thought I was seeing him.\rquote 
\par \lquote An easy mistake to make,\rquote  said Dumbledore softly. \lquote I expect you\rquote re tired of hearing it, but you do look }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid2125196 extraordinarily }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par Harry shook his head.
\par \lquote It was stupid, thinking it was him,\rquote  he muttered. \lquote I mean, I knew he was dead.\rquote 
\par \lquote You think the dead we have loved ever truly leave us? You think that we don\rquote t recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you, Harry, and shows him\-

Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was convinced that Hagrid had found a way of smuggling the Hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper. Percy Weasley, meanwhile, had m
uch to say on the subject of Sirius\rquote  escape.
\par \lquote If I manage to get into the Ministry, I\rquote ll have a lot of proposals to make about Magical Law Enforcement!\rquote  he told the only person who would listen \endash  his girlfriend, Penelope.
\par Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so cheerful, though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits.
\par He certainly wasn\rquote t the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin go. The whole of Harry\rquote s Defence Against the Dark Arts class were miserable about his resignation.
\par \lquote Wonder what they\rquote ll give us next year?\rquote  said Seamus Finnigan gloomily.
\par \lquote Maybe a vampire,\rquote  suggested Dean Thomas hopefully.
\par It wasn\rquote t only Professor Lupin\rquote s departure that was weighing on Harry\rquote s mind. He couldn\rquote t help thinking a lot about Professor Trelawney\rquote 
s prediction. He kept wondering where Pettigrew was now, whether he had sought sanctuary with Voldemort yet. But the thing that was lowering Harry\rquote s 
spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the Dursleys. For maybe half an hour, a glorious half hour, he had believed he would be living with Sirius from now on ... his parents\rquote 
 best friend ... it would have been the next best thing to having his own father back. And while no news of Sirius was definitely good news, because it meant he had suc\-cessfully gone into hiding, Harry couldn\rquote 
t help feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had, and the fact that it was now impossible.
\par The exam results came out on the last day of term. Harry, Ron and Hermione had passed every subject. Harry was amazed that he had got through Potions. He had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore had stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose. Snape
\rquote s behaviour towards Harry over the past week had been quite alarming. Harry wouldn\rquote t have thought it possible that Snape\rquote 
s dislike for him could increase, but it certainly had done. A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of Snape\rquote s thin mouth every time he looked at Harry, and he was constantly flexing his fingers, as though itching to place them around Harry
\rquote s throat.
\par Percy had got his top-grade N.E.W.Ts; Fred and George had scraped a handful of O.W.Ls each. Gryffindor house, meanwhile, largely thanks to 
their spectacular performance in the Quidditch Cup, had won the House Championship for the third year running. This meant that the end-of-term feast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold, and that the Gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot
, as everybody celebrated. Even Harry managed to forget about the journey back to the Dursleys next day as he ate, drank, talked and laughed with the rest.

\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  said Hermione suddenly, peering over his shoulder. \lquote What\rquote s that thing outside your window?\rquote 
\par Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and grey was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look and saw that it was a tiny

s seat and began zooming around their compartment, appar\-ently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of
 dignified disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm\rquote s way.
\par Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the letter and shouted, \lquote It\rquote s from Sirius!\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Ron and Hermione excitedly. \lquote Read it aloud!\rquote
