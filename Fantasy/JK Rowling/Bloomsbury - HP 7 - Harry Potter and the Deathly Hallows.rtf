 be present, that love and live in that which is omnipresent. In this divine glass they see face to face; and their converse is free, as well as pure. This is the comfort of friends, that though they may be said to die, yet their friendship and society ar
e, in the best sense, ever present, because immortal.

The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other\rquote 
s chests; then, recognising each other, they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote News?\rquote  asked the taller of the two.
\par \lquote The best,\rquote  replied Severus Snape.
\par The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men\rquote s long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched.
\par \lquote Thought I might be late,\rquote  said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. \lquote It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You sound
 confident that your reception will be good?\rquote 
\par Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway that led off the lane. The high hedge curved with them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron gates barring the men\rquote 
s way. Neither of them broke step: in silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through as though the dark metal were smoke.
\par The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men\rquote s footsteps. There was a rustle somewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again, pointing it over his companion\rquote 
s head, but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure white peacock, strutting majestically along the top of the hedge.
\par \lquote He always did himself well, Lucius. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Peacocks }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 ...\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, lights glinting in the diamond-paned down
stairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge, a fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped towards the front door, which swung inwards at their approach, though nobody had visibly opened it.
\par The hallw
ay was large, dimly lit and sumptuously decorated, with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the walls followed Snape and Yaxley as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door leadi
ng into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle.
\par The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. The room\rquote s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. I
llumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light they were drawn upwards to the strangest 
f
eature of the scene: an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in the bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the people sea
ted underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it. He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upwards every minute or so.
\par \lquote Yaxley. Snape,\rquote  said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. \lquote You are very nearly late.\rquote 
\par The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was difficult, at first, for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette. As they drew nearer, however, his face shone through the gloom, hair
less, snake-like, with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow.
\par \lquote Severus, here,\rquote  said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate right. \lquote Yaxley \endash  beside Dolohov.\rquote 
\par The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table followed Snape and it was to him that Voldemort spoke first.
\par \lquote So?\rquote 
\par \lquote My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.\rquote 
\par The interest around the table sharpened palpably: some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at Snape and Voldemort.
\par \lquote Saturday ... at nightfall,\rquote  repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened upon Snape\rquote s black ones with such intensity that some of th
e watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked calmly back into Voldemort\rquote s face and, after a moment or two, Voldemort\rquote 
s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile.
\par \lquote Good. Very good. And this information comes \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote From the source we discussed,\rquote  said Snape.
\par \lquote My Lord.\rquote 
\par Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. All faces turned to him.
\par \lquote My Lord, I have heard differently.\rquote 
\par Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, \lquote Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.\rquote 
\par Snape was smiling.
\par \lquote My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time, he is known to be susceptible.\rquote 
\par \lquote I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,\rquote  said Yaxley.
\par \lquote If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote I assure }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 you, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Yaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter. The Order believes that we have infiltrated the Ministry.\rquote 
\par \lquote The Order\rquote s got one thing right, then, eh?\rquote  said a squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table.
\par Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upwards, to the body revolving slowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought.
\par \lquote My Lord,\rquote  Yaxley went on, \lquote Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy \endash \rquote 
\par Voldemort held up a large, white hand and Yaxley subsided at once, watching resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape.
\par \lquote Where are they going to hide the boy next?\rquote 
\par \lquote At the home of one of the Order,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote 
The place, according to the source, has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could provide. I think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course
, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, Yaxley?\rquote  Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Will}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640  the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?\rquote 
\par Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders.
\par \lquote My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have \endash  with difficulty, and after great effort \endash  succeeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.\rquote 
\par Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbour, Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the back.
\par \lquote It is a start,\rquote  said Voldemort. \lquote But Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Minister\rquote s life will set me back a long way.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes \endash  my Lord, that is true \endash  but you know, as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister himself, bu
t also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy, now that we have such a high-ranking official under our control, to subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down.\rquote 
\par \lquote As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest,\rquote  said Voldemort. \lquote 
At any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while he travels.\rquote 
\par \lquote We are at an advantage there, my Lord,\rquote  said Yaxley, who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval. \lquote 
We now have several people planted within the Department of Magical Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.\rquote 
\par \lquote He will not do either,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote The Order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to do with the place.\rquote 
\par \lquote All the better,\rquote  said Voldemort. \lquote He will have to move in the open. Easier to take, by far.\rquote 
\par Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, \lquote I shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them have been my own. That Potter li
ves is due more to my errors, than to his triumphs.\rquote 
\par The company round the table watched Voldemort appre\-hensively, each of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter\rquote s continued existence. Voldemort, however, seemed 
to be speaking more to himself than to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body above him.
\par \lquote I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those wreckers of all but the best laid plans. But I know better now I understand thos
e things that I did not understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.\rquote 
\par At these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail sounded, a terrible, drawn-out cry of misery and pain. Many of those at the table looked downwards, startled, for the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet.
\par \lquote Wormtail,\rquote  said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet, thoughtful tone, and without removing his eyes from the revolving body above, \lquote have I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes m \endash  my Lord,\rquote  gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had been sitting so lo
w in his chair that it had appeared, at first glance, to be unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver.
\par \lquote As I was saying,\rquote  continued Voldemort, looking again at the tense faces of his followers, \lquote I understand better now. I shall need, for instance, to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill Potter.\rquote 
\par The faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms.
\par \lquote No volunteers?\rquote  said Voldemort. \lquote Let\rquote s see ... Lucius, I see no reason for you to have a wand any more.\rquote 
\par Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight and his eyes were sunken and shadowed. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse.
\par \lquote My Lord?\rquote 
\par \lquote Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.\rquote 
\par \lquote I ...\rquote 
\par Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight ahead, quite as pale as he was, her long, blonde hair hanging down her back, but beneath the table her slim fingers closed bri
efly on his wrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, withdrew a wand and passed it along to Voldemort, who held it up in front of his red eyes, examining it closely.
\par \lquote What is it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Elm, my Lord,\rquote  whispered Malfoy.
\par \lquote And the core?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dragon \endash  dragon heartstring.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good,\rquote  said Voldemort. He drew out his own wand and compared the lengths.
\par Lucius Malfoy made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected to receive Voldemort\rquote s wand in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed by Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously.
\par \lquote Give you my wand, Lucius? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 My }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 wand?\rquote 
\par Some of the throng sniggered.
\par \lquote I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late ... what is it about my presence in your home that displeases you, Lucius?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nothing \endash  nothing, my Lord!\rquote 
\par \lquote Such }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 lies,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640  Lucius ...\rquote 
\par The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving. One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder; something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table.
\par The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort\rquote s chair. It rose, seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort\rquote s shoulders: its neck the thickness of a man\rquote 
s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long, thin fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy.
\par \lquote Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my rise to power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course, my Lord,\rquote  said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip. \lquote We did desire it \endash  we do.\rquote 
\par To Malfoy\rquote s left, his wife made an odd,
 stiff nod, her eyes averted from Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son Draco, who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away again, terrified to make eye contact.
\par \lquote My Lord,\rquote  said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice constricted with emotion, \lquote it is an honour to have you here, in our family\rquote s house. There can be no higher pleasure.\rquote 
\par She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanour; where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned towards Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate her longin
g for closeness.
\par \lquote No higher pleasure,\rquote  repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a little to one side as he considered Bellatrix. \lquote That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you.\rquote 
\par Her face flooded with colour; her eyes welled with tears of delight.
\par \lquote My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!\rquote 
\par \lquote No higher pleasure ... even compared with the happy event that, I hear, has taken place in your family this week?\rquote 
\par She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know what you mean, my Lord.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and Narcissa. She has just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud.\rquote 
\par There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. Many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped
 the table with their fists. The great snake, disliking the disturbance, opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did not hear it, so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys\rquote  humiliation. Bellatrix\rquote 
s face, so recently flushed with happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy red.
\par \lquote She is no niece of ours, my Lord,\rquote  she cried over the out\-pouring of mirth. \lquote We \endash  Narcissa and I \endash  have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with either o
f us, nor any beast she marries.\rquote 
\par \lquote What say you, Draco?\rquote  asked Voldemort, and though his voice was quiet, it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. \lquote Will you babysit the cubs?\rquote 
\par The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father, who was staring down into his own lap, then caught his mother\rquote s eye. She shook her head almost imperceptibly, then resumed her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall.
\par \lquote Enough,\rquote  said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake. \lquote Enough.\rquote 
\par And the laughter died at once.
\par \lquote Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time,\rquote  he said, as Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring.
\par \lquote You must prune yours, must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, my Lord,\rquote  whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude again. \lquote At the first chance!\rquote 
\par \lquote You shall have it,\rquote  said Voldemort. \lquote And in your family, so in the world ... we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain \'85\rquote 
\par Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoy\rquote s wand, pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table and gave it a tiny flick. The figure came to life with a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds.
\par \lquote Do you recognise our guest, Severus?\rquote  asked Voldemort.
\par Snape raised his eyes to the upside-down face. All of the Death Eaters were looking up at the captive now, as though they had been given permission to show curiosity. As she revolved to face the firelight, the woman 
said, in a cracked and terrified voice, \lquote Severus! Help me!\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, yes,\rquote  said Snape, as the prisoner turned slowly away again.
\par \lquote And you, Draco?\rquote  asked Voldemort, stroking the snake\rquote s snout with his wand-free hand. Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that the woman had woken, he seemed unable to look at her any more.
\par \lquote But you would not have taken her classes,\rquote  said Voldemort. \lquote For those of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\rquote 
\par There were small noises of comprehension around the table. A broad, hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled.
\par \lquote Yes ... Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about Muggles ... how they are not so different from us ...\rquote 
\par One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape again.
\par \lquote Severus ... please ... please ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Silence,\rquote  said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy\rquote s wand, and Charity fell silent as if gagged. \lquote 
Not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of wizarding children, last week Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned defence of Mudbloods in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Daily Prophet. 
}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Wizards, she says, must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic. The dwindling 
of the pure-bloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most desirable circumstance ... she would have us all mate with Muggles ... or, no doubt, werewolves \'85\rquote 
\par Nobody laughed this time: there was no mistaking the anger and contempt in Voldemort\rquote s voice. For the t
hird time, Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned slowly away from him again.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Avada Kedavra.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room. Charity fell, with a resounding crash, on to the table below, which trembled and creaked. Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in their chairs. Draco fell out of his on to the floor.
\par \lquote Dinner, Nagini,\rquote  said Voldemort softly, and the great snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders on to the polished wood.

Harry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath, he shouldered open his bedroom door. There was a crunch of breaking chin
a: he had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door.

\par He looked around; the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted. Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley\rquote s idea of a clever booby trap. Ke
eping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bed\-room door. Then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap.

\par It 
was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief, that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magic ... but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him. He had never learned how to repair wounds and

 this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education. Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him.

\par Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago. At the start of the intervening school years, he had merely ski
mmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom \endash 
 old quills, desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no longer fitted. Minutes previously Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood.
\par He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside the trunk again, he groped around in the bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

 had been hidden, he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage. He rec
ognised it at once. It was a two-inch-long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more remained of his godfather\rquote 
s last gift except powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit.
\par Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself, seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he placed the fragment on top of that morning\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned, by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk.
\par It took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the useless items and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on. His school and Quidditch robes, cauldron, parchment, quills and most of his textbooks 
were piled in a corner, to be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them; burn them in the dead of night, probably, as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime. His Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit, c
ertain books, the photograph album Hagrid had once given him, a stack of letters and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were the Marauder\rquote s Map and the locket with the note signed \lquote R.A.B.\rquote 
 inside it. The locket was accorded this place of honour not because it was valuable \endash  in all usual senses it was worthless \endash  but because of what it had cost to attain it.
\par This left a sizeable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl, Hedwig: one for each of the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this summer.
\par He got up off the floor, stretched and moved across to his desk. Hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through the newspapers, throwing them on to the rubbish pile one by one; the owl was asleep, or else fakin
g; she was angry with Harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment.
\par As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed down, searching for one particular edition which he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to Privet Drive for the summer; he remembered that there had been a small mention on the fro
nt about the resignation of Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At last he found it. Turning to page ten, he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for.

When Albus and I left Hogwarts, we intended to take the then traditional tour of the world together, visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing our separate careers. However, tragedy intervened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus\rquote 
s mother, Kendra, died, leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at Kendra\rquote s funeral, then left for what was now to be a solitary journey. With a younger brother and sis
ter to care for, and little gold left to them, there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me.
\par That was the period of our lives when we had least contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, perhaps insensitively, the wonders of my journey from n
arrow escapes from Chimaeras in Greece to the experiments of the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little of his day-to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in my own experiences, it was with horr
or that I heard, towards the end of my year\rquote s travels, that yet another tragedy had struck the Dumbledores: the death of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 his }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

Sixteen years of being addressed thus left Harry in no doubt whom his uncle was calling; nevertheless, he did not immediately respond. He was still gazing at the mirror fragment in which, for a split second, he had thought he saw Dumbledore\rquote

\par \lquote You took your time!\rquote  roared Vernon Dursley when Harry appeared at the top of the stairs. \lquote Get down here, I want a word!\rquote 
\par Harry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his jeans pockets. When he reached the living ro
om, he found all three Dursleys. They were dressed for travelling: Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up jacket, Aunt Petunia in a neat, salmon-coloured coat and Dudley, Harry\rquote s large, blond, muscular cousin, in his leather jacket.
\par \lquote Yes?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Sit down!\rquote  said Uncle Vernon. Harry raised his eyebrows. \lquote Please!\rquote  added Uncle Vernon, wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat.
\par Harry sat. He thought he knew what was coming. His uncle began to pace up and down, Aunt Petunia and Dudley following h
is movements with anxious expressions. Finally, his large, purple face crumpled with concentration, Uncle Vernon stopped in front of Harry and spoke.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve changed my mind,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote What a surprise,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you take that tone \endash \rquote  began Aunt Petunia in a shrill voice, but Vernon Dursley waved her down.
\par \lquote It\rquote s all a lot of claptrap,\rquote  said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry with piggy little eyes. \lquote I\rquote ve decided I don\rquote t believe a word of it. We\rquote re staying put, we\rquote re not going anywhere.\rquote 
\par Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement. Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every twenty-four hours for the past four weeks, packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart. Harry\rquote 
s favourite moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon, unaware that Dudley had added his dumb-bells to his case since the last time it had been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.

\par \lquote According to you,\rquote  Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pacing up and down the living room, \lquote we \endash  Petunia, Dudley and I \endash  are in danger. From \endash  from \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Some of \'93my lot\'94, right,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well, I don\rquote t believe it,\rquote  repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front of Harry again. \lquote I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe it\rquote s a plot to get the house.\rquote 
\par \lquote The house?\rquote  repeated Harry. \lquote What house?\rquote 
\par \lquote This house!\rquote  shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to pulse. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Our }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Don\rquote t you dare \endash !\rquote  squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon waved her down: slights on his personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to the danger he had spotted.
\par \lquote Just in case you\rquote ve forgotten,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote I\rquote ve already got a house, my godfather left me one. So why would I want this one? All the happy memories?\rquote 
\par There was silence. Harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument.
\par \lquote You claim,\rquote  said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, \lquote that this Lord Thing \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Voldemort,\rquote  said Harry impatiently, \lquote and we\rquote ve been through this about a hundred times already. This isn\rquote t a claim, it\rquote s fact, Dumbledore told you last year, and Kingsley and Mr Weasley \endash \rquote 
\par Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit, a few days into Harry\rquote 
s summer holidays, of two fully grown wizards. The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock t
o the Dursleys. Harry had to admit, however, that as Mr Weasley had once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon.
\par \lquote \endash  Kingsley and Mr Weasley explained it all as well,\rquote  Harry pressed on remorselessly. \lquote Once I\rquote 
m seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as me. The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, whether to torture you to try and find out where I am, or because he thinks by holding you hostage I\rquote 
d come and try to rescue you.\rquote 
\par Uncle Vernon\rquote s and Harry\rquote s eyes met. Harry was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing. Then Uncle Vernon walked on and Harry resumed, \lquote You\rquote ve got to go into hiding and the Order wants to help. You
\rquote re being offered serious protection, the best there is.\rquote 
\par Uncle Vernon said nothing, but continued to pace up and down. Outside, the sun hung low over the privet hedges. The next-door neighbour\rquote s lawnmower stalled again.
\par \lquote I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?\rquote  asked Vernon Dursley abruptly.
\par \lquote There is,\rquote  said Harry, surprised.
\par \lquote Well, then, why can\rquote t they protect us? It seems to me that, as innocent victims, guilty of nothing more than harbouring a marked man, we ought to qualify for government protection!\rquote 
\par Harry laughed; he could not help himself. It was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment, even within this world that he despised and mistrusted.
\par \lquote You heard what Mr Weasley and Kingsley said,\rquote  Harry replied. \lquote We think the Ministry has been infiltrated.\rquote 
\par Uncle Vernon strode to the fireplace and back, breathing so heavily that his great, black moustache rippled, his face still purple with concentration.
\par \lquote All right,\rquote  he said, stopping in front of Harry yet again. \lquote All right, let\rquote s say, for the sake of argument, we accept this protection. I still don\rquote t see why we can\rquote t have that Kingsley bloke.\rquote 
\par Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This question had also been addressed half a dozen times.
\par \lquote As I\rquote ve told you,\rquote  he said, through gritted teeth, \lquote Kingsley is protecting the Mug\emdash  I mean, your Prime Minister.\rquote 
\par \lquote Exactly \endash  he\rquote s the best!\rquote  said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the blank television screen. The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the news, walking along discreetly b
ehind the Muggle Prime Minister as he visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep voice, had caused the Dursleys to take to Kingsley
 in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him with his earring in.
\par \lquote Well, he\rquote s taken,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote But Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle are more than up to the job \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote If we\rquote d even seen CVs ...\rquote  began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost patience. Getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now pointing at the TV set himself.
\par \lquote These accidents aren\rquote t accidents \endash  the crashes and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news. People are disappearing and dying and he\rquote s behind it \endash  Voldemort. I\rquote 
ve told you this over and over again, he kills Muggles for fun. Even the fogs \endash  they\rquote re caused by Dementors, and if you can\rquote t remember what they are, ask your son!\rquote 
\par Dudley\rquote s hands jerked upwards to cover his mouth. With his parents\rquote  and Harry\rquote s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and asked, \lquote There are ... more of them?\rquote 
\par \lquote More?\rquote  laughed Harry. \lquote More than the two that attacked us, you mean? Of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing as they feed off fear and despair \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote All right, all right,\rquote  blustered Vernon Dursley. \lquote You\rquote ve made your point \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I hope so,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote because once I\rquote m seventeen, all of them \endash  Death Eaters, Dementors, maybe even Inferi, which means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark wizard \endash 
 will be able to find you and will certainly attack you. And if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I think you\rquote ll agree you need help.\rquote 
\par There was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years. Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle Vernon; Dudley was staring at Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, 
\lquote But what about my work? What about Dudley\rquote s school? I don\rquote t suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you understand?\rquote  shouted Harry. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote They will torture and kill you like they did my parents!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par \lquote Dad,\rquote  said Dudley in a loud voice, \lquote Dad \endash  I\rquote m going with these Order people.\rquote 
\par \lquote Dudley,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote for the first, time in your life, you\rquote re talking sense.\rquote 
\par He knew that the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened enough to accept the Order\rquote 
s help, his parents would accompany him: there could be no question of being separated from their Diddykins. Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece.
\par \lquote They\rquote ll be here in about five minutes,\rquote  he said, and when none of the Dursleys replied, he left the room. The prospect of parting \endash  probably forever \endash 
 from his aunt, uncle and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully, but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air. What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years\rquote  solid dislike?
\par Back in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack, then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bars of Hedwig\rquote s cage. They fell with dull thuds to the bottom, where she ignored them.
\par \lquote We\rquote re leaving soon, really soon,\rquote  Harry told her. \lquote And then you\rquote ll be able to fly again.\rquote 
\par The doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of his room and downstairs: it was too much to expect Hestia and Dedalus to cope with the Dursleys on their own.
\par \lquote Harry Potter!\rquote  squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry had opened the door; a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping him a deep bow. \lquote An honour, as ever!\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks, Dedalus,\rquote  said Harry, bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon the dark-haired Hestia. \lquote It\rquote s really good of you to do this ... they\rquote re through here, my aunt and uncle and cousin ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Good day to you, Harry Potter\rquote s relatives!\rquote  said Dedalus happily, striding into the living room. The Dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus; Harry half expect
ed another change of mind. Dudley shrank nearer to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard.
\par \lquote I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry has told you, is a simple one,\rquote  said Dedalus, pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it. \lquote 
We shall be leaving before Harry does. Due to the danger of using magic in your house \endash  Harry being still under-age, it could provide the Ministry with an excuse to arrest him \endash  we shall be driving, say ten miles or so, before Disa
pparating to the safe location we have picked out for you. You know how to drive, I take it?\rquote  he asked Uncle Vernon politely.
\par \lquote Know how to \endash ? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!\rquote  spluttered Uncle Vernon.
\par \lquote Very clever of you, sir, very clever, I personally would be utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs,\rquote 
 said Dedalus. He was clearly under the impression that he was flattering Vernon Dursley, who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word Dedalus spoke.
\par \lquote Can\rquote t even drive,\rquote  he muttered under his breath, his moustache rippling indignantly, but fortunately neither Dedalus nor Hestia seemed to hear him.
\par \lquote You, Harry,\rquote  Dedalus continued, \lquote will wait here for your guard. There has been a little change in the arrangements \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean?\rquote  said Harry at once. \lquote I thought Mad-Eye was going to come and take me by Side-Along-Apparition?\rquote 
\par \lquote Can\rquote t do it,\rquote  said Hestia tersely. \lquote Mad-Eye will explain.\rquote 
\par The Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension on their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Hurry up!\rquote  }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Harry looked all around the room before realising that the voice had issued from Dedalus\rquote s pocket watch.
\par \lquote Quite right, we\rquote re operating to a very tight schedule,\rquote  said Dedalus, nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waistcoat. \lquote We are attempting to time your departure from the house with your family\rquote 
s Disapparition, Harry; thus, the charm breaks at the moment you all head for safety.\rquote  He turned to the Dursleys. \lquote Well, are we all packed and ready to go?\rquote 
\par None of them answered him: Uncle Vernon was still staring, appalled, at the bulge in Dedalus\rquote s waistcoat pocket.
\par \lquote Perhaps we should Wait outside in the hall, Dedalus,\rquote  murmured Hestia: she clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain in the room while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged loving, possibly tearful farewells.
\par \lquote There\rquote s no need,\rquote  Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly, \lquote Well, this is goodbye, then, boy.\rquote 
\par He swung his right arm upwards to shake Harry\rquote s hand, but at the last moment seemed unable to face it, and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backwards and forwards like a metronome.
\par \lquote Ready, Diddy?\rquote  asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether.
\par Dudley did not answer, but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar, reminding Harry a little of the giant, Grawp.
\par \lquote Come along, then,\rquote  said Uncle Vernon.
\par He had already reached the living-room door when Dudley mumbled, \lquote I don\rquote t understand.\rquote 
\par \lquote What don\rquote t you understand, Popkin?\rquote  asked Aunt Petunia, looking up at her son.
\par Dudley raised a large, ham-like hand to point at Harry.
\par \lquote Why isn\rquote t he coming with us?\rquote 
\par Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze where they stood, staring at Dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Uncle Vernon loudly.
\par \lquote Why isn\rquote t he coming too?\rquote  asked Dudley.
\par \lquote Well, he \endash  he doesn\rquote t want to,\rquote  said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at Harry and adding, \lquote you don\rquote t want to, do you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not in the slightest,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote There you are,\rquote  Uncle Vernon told Dudley. \lquote Now come on, we\rquote re off.\rquote 
\par He marched out of the room: they heard the front door open, but Dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps Aunt Petunia stopped too.
\par \lquote What now?\rquote  barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the door\-way.
\par It seemed that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words. After several moments of apparently painful internal struggle, he said, \lquote But where\rquote s he going to go?\rquote 
\par Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was clear that Dudley was frightening them. Hestia Jones broke the silence.
\par \lquote But ... surely you know where your nephew is going?\rquote  she asked, looking bewildered.
\par \lquote Certainly we know,\rquote  said Vernon Dursley. \lquote He\rquote s off with some of your lot, isn\rquote t he? Right, Dudley, let\rquote s get in the car, you heard the man, we\rquote re in a hurry.\rquote 
\par Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but Dudley did not follow.
\par \lquote Off with some of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 our }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 lot?\rquote 
\par Hestia looked outraged. Harry had met this attitude before: witches and wizards seemed stunned that his closest living relatives took so little interest in the famous Harry Potter.
\par \lquote It\rquote s fine,\rquote  Harry assured her. \lquote It doesn\rquote t matter, honestly.\rquote 
\par \lquote Doesn\rquote t matter?\rquote  repeated Hestia, her voice rising ominously. \lquote Don\rquote t these people realise what you\rquote 
ve been through? What danger you are in? The unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti-Voldemort movement?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  no, they don\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote They think I\rquote m a waste of space, actually, but I\rquote m used to \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think you\rquote re a waste of space.\rquote 
\par If Harry had not seen Dudley\rquote s lips move, he might not have believed it. As it was, he stared at Dudley for several seconds before accep
ting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken; for one thing, Dudley had turned red. Harry was embarrassed and astonished himself.
\par \lquote Well ... er ... thanks, Dudley.\rquote 
\par Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression before mumbling, \lquote You saved my life.\rquote 
\par \lquote Not really,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote It was your soul the Dementor would have taken ...\rquote 
\par He looked curiously at his cousin. They had had virtually no contact during this summer or last, as Harry had come back to Privet Drive so briefly
 and kept to his room so much. It now dawned on Harry, however, that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all. Although rather touched, he was nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley appeared to have
 exhausted his ability to express his feelings. After opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley subsided into scarlet-faced silence.
\par Aunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an approving look which changed to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forwards and embraced Dudley rather than Harry.
\par \lquote S \endash  So sweet, Dudders ...\rquote  she sobbed into his massive chest, \lquote s \endash  such a lovely b \endash  boy ... s \endash  saying thank you \'85\rquote 
\par \lquote But he hasn\rquote t said thank you at all!\rquote  said Hestia indignantly. \lquote He only said he didn\rquote t think Harry was a waste of space!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, but coming from Dudley that\rquote s like \'93I love you\'94,\rquote  said Harry, torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry from a burning building.
\par \lquote Are we going or not?\rquote  roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again at the living-room door. \lquote I thought we were on a tight schedule!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes \endash  yes, we are,\rquote  said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watching these exchanges with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together. \lquote We really must be off. Harry \endash \rquote 
\par He tripped forwards and wrung Harry\rquote s hand with both of his own.
\par \lquote \endash  good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the wizarding world rest upon your shoulders.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote right. Thanks.\rquote 
\par \lquote Farewell, Harry,\rquote  said Hestia, also clasping his hand. \lquote Our thoughts go with you.\rquote 
\par \lquote I hope everything\rquote s OK,\rquote  said Harry, with a glance towards Aunt Petunia and Dudley.
\par \lquote Oh, I\rquote m sure we shall end up the best of chums,\rquote  said Diggle brightly, waving his hat as he left the room. Hestia followed him.
\par Dudley gently released himself from his mother\rquote s clutches and walked towards Harry, who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic. Then Dudley held out his large, pink hand.
\par \lquote Blimey, Dudley,\rquote  said Harry, over Aunt Petunia\rquote s renewed sobs, \lquote did the Dementors blow a different personality into you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dunno,\rquote  muttered Dudley. \lquote See you, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ...\rquote  said Harry, taking Dudley\rquote s hand and shaking it. \lquote Maybe. Take care, Big D.\rquote 
\par Dudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room. Harry heard his heavy footfalls on the gravelled drive, and then a car door slammed.
\par Aunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in her handker\-chief, looked round at the sound. She did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with Harry. Hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket she said, \lquote Well \endash  goodbye,
\rquote  and marched towards the door without looking at him.
\par \lquote Goodbye,\rquote  said Harry.
\par She stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to say som
ething to him: she gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with a little jerk of her head, she bustled out of the room after her husband and son.

\rquote  car swinging out of the drive and off up the road. Dedalus\rquote s top hat was visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the back seat. The car turned right at the 
end of Privet Drive, its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and then it was gone.

s cage, his Firebolt and his rucksack, gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look and then made his ungainly way
 back downstairs to the hall, where he deposited cage, broomstick and bag near the foot of the stairs. The light was fading rapidly now, the hall full of shadows in the evening light. It felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was 
a
bout to leave the house for the last time. Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare treat: pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge he had rushed upstairs to 
play on Dudley\rquote s computer, or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his heart\rquote s content. It gave him an odd, empty feeling to remember those times; it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you want to take a last look at the place?\rquote  he asked Hedwig, who was still sulking with her head under her wing. \lquote We\rquote ll never be here again. Don\rquote 
t you want to remember all the good times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories ... Dudley puked on it after I saved him from 
the Dementors ... Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it? ... And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door ...\rquote 
\par Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door.
\par \lquote And under here, Hedwig \endash \rquote  Harry pulled open a door under the stairs \lquote \endash  is where I used to sleep! You never knew me then \endash  blimey, it\rquote s small, I\rquote d forgotten ...\rquote 
\par Harry looked aro
und at the stacked shoes and umbrellas, remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two. Those had been the days before he had known anything about his 
t
rue identity; before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him. But Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes of green light and, o
nce \endash  Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry had recounted it \endash  a flying motorbike ...
\par There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle Vernon\rquote 
s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden.
\par The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then, one by one, figures beg
an to pop into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted. Dominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached. All around him other people were dismounting from brooms an
d, in two cases, skeletal, black winged horses.
\par Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst. There was a general cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron clapped him on the back and Hagrid said, \lquote All righ\rquote , Harry? Ready fer the off?\rquote 
\par \lquote Definitely,\rquote  said Harry, beaming around at them all. \lquote But I wasn\rquote t expecting this many of you!\rquote 
\par \lquote Change of plan,\rquote  growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous, bulging sacks and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity. \lquote Let\rquote 
s get undercover before we talk you through it.\rquote 
\par Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering, they settled on chairs, sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia\rquote s gleaming work-surfaces or leaned up again
st her spotless appliances: Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and George, grinning identi\-
cally; Bill, badly scarred and long-haired; Mr Weasley, kind-faced, balding, his spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle
-worn, one-legged, his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her favourite shade of bright pink; Lupin, greyer, more lined; Fleur, slender and beautiful, with her long, silvery blonde hair; Kingsley, bald, black, broa
d-shouldered; Hagrid, with his wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling, and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty and hangdog, with his droopy, basset hound\rquote s eyes and matted hair. Harry\rquote 
s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: he felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met.
\par \lquote Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister?\rquote  he called across the room.
\par \lquote He can get along without me for one night,\rquote  said Kingsley. \lquote You\rquote re more important.\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, guess what?\rquote  said Tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine, and she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glittered there.
\par \lquote You got married?\rquote  Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry you couldn\rquote t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s brilliant, congrat\emdash \rquote 
\par \lquote All right, all right, we\rquote ll have time for a cosy catch-up later!\rquote  roared Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen. Moody dropped the sacks at his feet and turned to Harry. \lquote 
As Dedalus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He\rquote s made it an imprisonable offence to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here or Apparate in
 or out. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you. Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother\rquote s charm does that already. What he\rquote s really done is to stop you getting out of here safely.
\par \lquote Second problem: you\rquote re under-age, which means you\rquote ve still got the Trace on you.\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote The Trace, the Trace!\rquote  said Mad-Eye impatiently. \lquote The charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about under-age magic! If you, or anyone 
around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters.
\par \lquote We can\rquote t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn seventeen you\rquote ll lose all the protection your mother gave you. In short: Pius Thicknesse thinks he\rquote s got you cornered good and proper.\rquote 
\par Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse.
\par \lquote So what are we going to do?\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace can\rquote t detect, because we don\rquote t need to cast spells to use them: brooms, Thestrals and Hagrid\rquote s motorbike.\rquote 
\par Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give Mad-Eye the chance to address them.
\par \lquote Now, your mother\rquote s charm will only break under two con\-ditions: when you come of age, or \endash \rquote  Moody gestured around the pristine kitchen \lquote \endash 
 you no longer call this place home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full understanding that you\rquote re never going to live together again, correct?\rquote 
\par Harry nodded.
\par \lquote So this time, when you leave, there\rquote ll be no going back, and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range. We\rquote re choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and
 seize you the moment you turn seventeen.
\par \lquote The one thing we\rquote ve got on our side is that You-Know-Who doesn\rquote t know we\rquote re moving you tonight. We\rquote ve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry: they think you\rquote 
re not leaving until the thirtieth. However, this is You-Know-Who we\rquote re dealing with, so we can\rquote t just rely on him getting the date wrong; he\rquote 
s bound to have a couple of Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just in case. So, we\rquote ve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place we\rquote 
re going to hide you, they\rquote ve all got some connection with the Order: my house, Kingsley\rquote s place, Molly\rquote s Auntie Muriel\rquote s \endash  you get the idea.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll be going to Tonks\rquote s parents\rquote . Once you\rquote re within the boundaries of the protective enchantments we\rquote ve put on their house, you\rquote ll be able to use a Portkey to The Burrow. Any questions?\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  yes,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Maybe they won\rquote t know which of the twelve secure houses I\rquote m heading for at first, but won\rquote t it be sort of obvious once \endash \rquote  he performed a quick headcount \lquote 
\endash  fourteen of us fly off towards Tonks\rquote s parents\rquote ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  said Moody, \lquote I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won\rquote t be flying to Tonks\rquote s parents\rquote 
. There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of them with a companion, each pair heading for a different safe house.\rquote 
\par From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud. There was no need for him to say another word; Harry understood the rest of the plan immediately.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. \lquote No way!\rquote 
\par \lquote I told them you\rquote d take it like this,\rquote  said Hermione, with a hint of complacency.

\par \lquote This is different, pretending to be me \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry,\rquote  said Fred earnestly. \lquote Imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.\rquote 
\par Harry did not smile.
\par \lquote You can\rquote t do it if I don\rquote t cooperate, you need me to give you some hair.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, that\rquote s that plan scuppered,\rquote  said George. \lquote Obviously there\rquote s no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who\rquote s not allowed to use magic; we\rquote ve got no chance,\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote Funny,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Really amusing.\rquote 
\par \lquote If it has to come to force, then it will,\rquote  growled Moody, his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at Harry. \lquote Everyone here\rquote s over-age, Potter, and they\rquote re all prepared to take the risk.\rquote 

\par Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways to glare at him out of the side of Moody\rquote s head.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s have no more arguments. Time\rquote s wearing on. I want a few of your hairs, boy, now.\rquote 
\par \lquote But this is mad, there\rquote s no need \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No need!\rquote  snarled Moody. \lquote With You-Know-Who out there and half the Ministry on his side? Potter, if we\rquote re lucky, he\rquote ll have swallowed the fake bait and he\rquote ll be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth, but he
\rquote d be mad not to have a Death Eater or two keeping an eye out, it\rquote s what I\rquote d do. They might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother\rquote s charm holds, but it\rquote 
s about to break and they know the rough position of the place. Our only chance is to use decoys. Even You-Know-Who can\rquote t split himself into seven.\rquote 
\par Harry caught Hermione\rquote s eye and looked away at once.
\par \lquote So, Potter \endash  some of your hair, if you please.\rquote 
\par Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort of way.
\par \lquote Now!\rquote  barked Moody.
\par With all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of his head, grabbed a hank of hair and pulled.
\par \lquote Good,\rquote  said Moody, limping forwards as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of Potion. \lquote Straight in here, if you please.\rquote 
\par Harry dropped the hair into the mud-like liquid. The moment it made contact with its surface the Potion began to froth and smoke then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold.
\par \lquote Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,\rquote  said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron\rquote s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly and saying, \lquote oh, you know what I mean \endash  Goyle\rquote 
s Potion looked like bogies.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,\rquote  said Moody.
\par Ron, Hermione, Fred, George and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunia\rquote s gleaming sink.
\par \lquote We\rquote re one short,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par \lquote Here,\rquote  said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred and George instead.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve toldjer, I\rquote d sooner be a protector,\rquote  said Mundungus.
\par \lquote Shut it,\rquote  growled Moody. \lquote As I\rquote ve already told you, you spineless worm, any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him. Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who would want to finish Potter in person. It
\rquote ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters\rquote ll want to kill them.\rquote 
\par Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already pulling half a dozen egg-cup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one.
\par \lquote Altogether, then ...\rquote 
\par Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur and Mundungus drank. A
ll of them gasped and grimaced as the Potion hit their throats: at once, their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax. Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upwards; Ron, Fred and George were shrinking; their hair was darkening, Hermione\rquote 
s and Fleur\rquote s appearing to shoot backwards into their skulls.
\par Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with him: when he straightened up again, there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front of him.
\par Fred and George turned to each other and said together, \lquote Wow \endash  we\rquote re identical!\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno, though, I think I\rquote m still better-looking,\rquote  said Fred, examining his reflection in the kettle.
\par \lquote Bah,\rquote  said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, \lquote Bill, don\rquote t look at me \endash  I\rquote m \rquote ideous.\rquote 
\par \lquote Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I\rquote ve got smaller here,\rquote  said Moody, indicating the first sack, \lquote and vice versa. Don\rquote t forget the glasses, there\rquote s six pairs in the side pocket. And when you\rquote 
re dressed, there\rquote s luggage in the other sack.\rquote 
\par The real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing t
heir own things away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for his privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity, clearly much more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been with their own.
\par \lquote I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,\rquote  said Ron, looking down at his bare chest.
\par \lquote Harry, your eyesight really is awful,\rquote  said Hermione, as she put on glasses.
\par Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each containing a stuffed snowy owl, from the second sack.
\par \lquote Good,\rquote  said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled and luggage-laden Harrys faced him. \lquote The pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will be travelling with me, by broom \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Why\rquote m I with you?\rquote  grunted the Harry nearest the back door.
\par \lquote Because you\rquote re the one that needs watching,\rquote  growled Moody, and sure enough, his magical eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued, \lquote Arthur and Fred \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m George,\rquote  said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. \lquote Can\rquote t you even tell us apart when we\rquote re Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Sorry, George \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m only yanking your wand, I\rquote m Fred really \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Enough messing around!\rquote  snarled Moody. \lquote The other one \endash  George or Fred or whoever you are \endash  you\rquote re with Remus. Miss Delacour \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m taking Fleur on a Thestral,\rquote  said Bill. \lquote She\rquote s not that fond of brooms.\rquote 
\par Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slavish look that Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again.
\par \lquote Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by Thestral \endash \rquote 
\par Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley\rquote s smile; Harry knew that Hermione, too, lacked confidence on a broomstick.
\par \lquote Which leaves you and me, Ron!\rquote  said Tonks brightly, knocking over a mug-tree as she waved at him.
\par Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione.
\par \lquote An\rquote  you\rquote re with me, Harry. That all righ\rquote ?\rquote  said Hagrid, looking a little anxious. \lquote We\rquote ll be on the bike, brooms an\rquote  Thestrals can\rquote t take me weight, see. \rquote Not a lot o\rquote 
 room on the seat with me on it, though, so you\rquote ll be in the sidecar.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s great,\rquote  said Harry, not altogether truthfully.
\par \lquote We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,\rquote  said Moody, who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling. \lquote Snape\rquote s had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he\rquote 
s never mentioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, we\rquote re betting they\rquote ll choose one of the Potters who look at home on a broomstick. All right then,\rquote  he went on, tying up the sack with the fake Potters\rquote 
 clothes in it and leading the way back to the door, \lquote I make it three minutes until we\rquote re supposed to leave. No point locking the back door, it won\rquote t keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking ... Come on ...\rquote 
\par Harry hurried into the hall to fetch his rucksack, Firebolt and Hedwig\rquote s cage before joining the others in the dark back garden. On every side b
roomsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had already been helped up on to a great, black Thestral by Kingsley; Fleur on to the other by Bill. Hagrid was standing ready beside the motorbike, goggles on.
\par \lquote Is this it? Is this Sirius\rquote s bike?\rquote 
\par \lquote The very same,\rquote  said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. \lquote An\rquote  the last time you was on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand!\rquote 
\par Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar. It placed him several feet below everybody else: Ron smirked at the
 sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed Hedwig\rquote s cage between his knees. It was extremely uncomfortable.
\par \lquote Arthur\rquote s done a bit o\rquote  tinkerin\rquote ,\rquote  said Hagrid, quite oblivious to Harry\rquote s discomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. \lquote It\rquote 
s got a few tricks up its handlebars now. Tha\rquote  one was my idea.\rquote 
\par He pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer.
\par \lquote Please be careful, Hagrid,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, who was standing beside them, holding his broomstick. \lquote I\rquote m still not sure that was advisable and it\rquote s certainly only to be used in emergencies.\rquote 
\par \lquote All right then,\rquote  said Moody. \lquote Everyone ready, please; I want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion\rquote s lost.\rquote 
\par Everybody mounted their brooms.
\par \lquote Hold tight, now, Ron,\rquote  said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either side of he
r waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life: it roared like a dragon and the sidecar began to vibrate.
\par \lquote Good luck, everyone,\rquote  shouted Moody. \lquote See you all in about an hour at The Burrow. On the count of three. One ... two ... THREE.\rquote 
\par There was a great ro
ar from the motorbike and Harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch: he was rising through the air fast, his eyes watering slightly, hair whipped back off his face. Around him brooms were soaring upwards too: the long, black tail of a Thestral flicked pas
t. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig\rquote 
s cage and his rucksack, were already sore and starting to go numb. So great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four, Privet Drive; by the time he looked over the edge of 
the sidecar, he could no longer tell which one it was. Higher and higher they climbed into the sky \endash 
\par And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least thirty hooded figures, suspended in mid-air, formed a vast circle in the midst of which the Order members had risen, oblivious \endash 
\par Screams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they were: street lights above him, yells around him, he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig\rquote 
s cage, the Firebolt and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees \endash 
\par \lquote No \endash  HEDWIG!\rquote 
\par The broomstick spun to earth, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second\rquote 
s relief, and then another burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage.
\par \lquote No \endash  NO!\rquote 
\par The motorbike zoomed forwards; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering as Hagrid blasted through their circle.
\par \lquote Hedwig \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Hedwig \endash \rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage. He could not take it i
n, and his terror for the others was paramount. He glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving, flares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance, but he could not tell who they were \endash 
\par \lquote Hagrid, we\rquote ve got to go back, we\rquote ve got to go back!\rquote  he yelled over the thunderous roar of the engine, pulling out his wand, ramming Hedwig\rquote s cage on to the floor, refusing to believe that she was dead. \lquote 
Hagrid, TURN ROUND!\rquote 
\par \lquote My job\rquote s ter get you there safe, Harry!\rquote  bellowed Hagrid, and he opened the throttle.
\par \lquote Stop \endash  STOP!\rquote  Harry shouted. But as he looked back again two jets of green light flew past his left ear: four Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them, aiming for Hagrid\rquote s broad back. Hagrid swer
ved, but the Death Eaters were keeping up with the bike; more curses shot after them, and Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. Wriggling round, he cried, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Stupefy!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand, cleaving a gap between the
 four pursuing Death Eaters as they scattered to avoid it.
\par \lquote Hold on, Harry, this\rquote ll do for \rquote em!\rquote  roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge.
\par A wall, a solid brick wall, erup
ted out of the exhaust pipe. Craning his neck, Harry saw it expand into being in mid-air. Three of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was not so lucky: he vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it, his broomsti
ck broken into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to save him, but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up.
\par More Killing Curses flew past Harry\rquote s head from the two remaining Death Eaters\rquote  
wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with further Stunning Spells: red and green collided in mid-air in a shower of multi-coloured sparks and Harry thought wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what was happening
 \endash 
\par \lquote Here we go again, Harry, hold on!\rquote  yelled Hagrid, and he jabbed at a second button. This time a great net burst from the bike\rquote 
s exhaust, but the Death Eaters were ready for it. Not only did they swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to sa
ve their unconscious friend had caught up: he bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike, all shooting curses after it.
\par \lquote This\rquote ll do it, Harry, hold on tight!\rquote  yelled Hagrid, and Harry saw him slam his whole hand on to the purple button beside the speedometer.
\par With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from the exhaust, white-hot and blue, and the motorbike shot forwards like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death Eaters swerve ou
t of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame, and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously: its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration.
\par \lquote It\rquote s all righ\rquote , Harry!\rquote  bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat on to his back by the surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike\rquote s slipstream.
\par \lquote I\rquote m on it, Harry, don\rquote  worry!\rquote  Hagrid yelled, and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella.
\par \lquote Hagrid! No! Let me!\rquote 
\par \lquote REPARO!\rquote 
\par There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely: Harry sped forwards, propelled by the impetus of the bike\rquote s flight, then the sidecar began to lose height \endash 
\par In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Wingardium Leviosa!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote I\rquote m comin\rquote , Harry!\rquote  Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but Harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: crouching as low as he could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled, }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat \endash 
\par \lquote I\rquote m comin\rquote , Harry, I\rquote m comin\rquote !\rquote 
\par A huge hand seized the back of Harry\rquote s robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself on to the motorbike\rquote

\par As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid swerved and zigzagged: Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dragon-fire button again, with Harry seated so insecurely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at the
ir pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot another blocking jinx at them: the closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike \endash

\par Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire: as a Death Eater appeared on either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimetres, cast from behind \endash 
\par And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind, without broomstick or Thestral to hold him, his snake\-like face gleaming out of the blackness, his white fingers raising his wand again \endash 
\par Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive. Clinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random into the whirling night. He saw a body fly past him and knew he had hi

\par Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which way was up, which down: his scar was still burning; he expected to die at any second. A hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him, he saw it raise its arm \endash

e himself out of the debris of metal and leather that surrounded him; his hands sank into inches of muddy water as he tried to stand. He could not understand where Voldemort had gone and expected him to swoop out of the dark\-
ness at any moment. Something hot and wet was trickling down his chin and from his forehead. He crawled out of the pond and stumbled towards the great, dark mass on the ground that was Hagrid.
\par \lquote Hagrid? Hagrid, talk to me \endash \rquote 
\par But the dark mass did not stir.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?\rquote 
\par Harry did not recognise the man\rquote s voice. Then a woman shouted, \lquote They\rquote ve crashed, Ted! Crashed in the garden!\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s head was swimming.
\par \lquote Hagrid,\rquote  he repeated stupidly, and his knees buckled.
\par The next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions, with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm. His missing tooth had been regrown. The scar on his forehead was still throbbing.
\par \lquote Hagrid?\rquote 
\par He opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar, lamplit sitting room. His rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away, wet and muddy. A fair-haired, big-bellied man was watching Harry anxiously.
\par \lquote Hagrid\rquote s fine, son,\rquote  said the man, \lquote the wife\rquote s seeing to him now. How are you feeling? Anything else broken? I\rquote ve fixed your ribs, your tooth and your arm. I\rquote m Ted, by the way, Ted Tonks \endash  Dora
\rquote s father.\rquote 
\par Harry sat up too quickly: lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy.
\par \lquote Voldemort \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Easy, now,\rquote  said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry\rquote s shoulder and pushing him back against the cushions. \lquote 
That was a nasty crash you just had. What happened, anyway? Something go wrong with the bike? Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again, him and his Muggle contraptions?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound. \lquote Death Eaters, loads of them \endash  we were chased \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Death Eaters?\rquote  said Ted sharply. \lquote What d\rquote you mean, Death Eaters? I thought they didn\rquote t know you were being moved tonight, I thought \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote They knew,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Ted Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky above.
\par \lquote Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don\rquote t we? They shouldn\rquote t be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction.\rquote 
\par Now Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished; it had been at the point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the Order\rquote 
s charms. He only hoped they would continue to work: he imagined Voldemort, a hundred yards above them as they spoke, looking for a way to penetrate what Harry visualised as a great, transparent bubble.
\par He swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see Hagrid with his own eyes before he would believe that he was alive. He had barely stood up, however, when a door opened and Hagrid squeezed through it, his face covered in mud and
 blood, limping a little but miraculously alive.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote 
\par Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra, he covered the floor between them in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired ribs. \lquote Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o\rquote 
 that? I thought we were both goners.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, me too. I can\rquote t believe \endash \rquote 
\par Harry broke off: he had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind Hagrid.
\par \lquote You!\rquote  he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty.
\par \lquote Your wand\rquote s here, son,\rquote  said Ted, tapping it on Harry\rquote s arm. \lquote It fell right beside you, I picked it up. And that\rquote s my wife you\rquote re shouting at.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, I\rquote m \endash  I\rquote m sorry.\rquote 
\par As she moved forwards into the room, Mrs Tonks\rquote s resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: her hair was a light, soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. Neverthe\-less, she looked a little haughty after Harry\rquote 
s exclamation.
\par \lquote What happened to our daughter?\rquote  she asked. \lquote Hagrid said you were ambushed; where is Nymphadora?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote We don\rquote t know what happened to anyone else.\rquote 
\par She and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped Harry at the sight of their expressions; if any of the others had died, it was his fault, all his fault. He had consented to the plan, given them his hair ...
\par \lquote The Portkey,\rquote  he said, remembering all of a sudden. \lquote We\rquote ve got to get back to The Burrow and find out \endash  then we\rquote ll be able to send you word, or \endash  or Tonks will, once she\rquote s \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Dora\rquote ll be OK, Dromeda,\rquote  said Ted. \lquote She knows her stuff, she\rquote s been in plenty of tight spots with the Aurors. The Portkey\rquote s through here,\rquote  he added to Harry. \lquote It\rquote 
s supposed to leave in three minutes, if you want to take it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, we do,\rquote  said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it on to his shoulders. \lquote I \endash \rquote 
\par He looked at Mrs Tonks, wanting to apologise for the state of fear in which he left her and for which he felt so terribly respon\-sible, but no words occurred to him that did not seem hollow and insincere.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll tell Tonks \endash  Dora \endash  to send word, when she ... thanks for patching us up, thanks for everything. I \endash \rquote 
\par He was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short hallway and into a bedroom. Hagrid came after them, bending low to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel.
\par \lquote There you go, son. That\rquote s the Portkey.\rquote 
\par Mr Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush lying on the dressing table.
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready to leave.
\par \lquote Wait a moment,\rquote  said Hagrid, looking around. \lquote Harry, where\rquote s Hedwig?\rquote 
\par \lquote She ... she got hit,\rquote  said Harry.
\par The realisation crashed over him: he felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung his eyes. The owl had been his companion, his one great link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to return to the Dursleys.
\par Hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder.
\par \lquote Never mind,\rquote  he said gruffly. \lquote Never mind. She had a great old life \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hagrid!\rquote  said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed bright blue, and Hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time.
\par With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forwards, Harry was pulled into nothing\-ness, spinning uncontrollably, his finger glued to the Portkey as he and Hagrid hurtled away from Mr Tonks: seconds later Harry
\rquote s feet slammed on to hard ground and he fell on his hands and knees in the yard of The Burrow. He heard screams. Throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up, swaying slightly, and saw Mrs Weasley and Gin
ny running down the steps by the back door as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, clambered laboriously to his feet.
\par \lquote Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others?\rquote  cried Mrs Weasley.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean? Isn\rquote t anyone else back?\rquote  Harry panted.
\par The answer was clearly etched in Mrs Weasley\rquote s pale face.
\par \lquote The Death Eaters were waiting for us,\rquote  Harry told her. \lquote We were surrounded the moment we took off \endash  they knew it was tonight \endash  I don\rquote t know what happened to anyone else. Four of them 
chased us, it was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort caught up with us \endash \rquote 
\par He could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the plea for her to understand why he did not know what had happened to her sons, but \endash 
\par \lquote Thank goodness you\rquote re all right,\rquote  she said, pulling him into a hug he did not feel he deserved.
\par \lquote Haven\rquote t go\rquote  any brandy, have yeh, Molly?\rquote  asked Hagrid a little shakily. \lquote Fer medicinal purposes?\rquote 
\par She could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back towards the crooked house Harry knew that she wanted to hide her face. He turned to Ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for information at once.
\par \lquote Ron and Tonks should have been back first, but they missed their Portkey, it came back without them,\rquote  she said, pointing at a rusty oilcan lying on the ground nearby. \lquote And that one,\rquote  she pointed at an ancient plimsoll, 
\lquote should have been Dad and Fred\rquote s, they were supposed to be second. You and Hagrid were third and,\rquote  she checked her watch, \lquote if they made it, George and Lupin ought to be back in about a minute.\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she handed to Hagrid. He uncorked it and drank it straight down in one.
\par \lquote Mum!\rquote  shouted Ginny, pointing to a spot several feet away.
\par A blue light had appeared in the darknes
s: it grew larger and brighter, and Lupin and George appeared, spinning and then falling. Harry knew immediately that there was something wrong: Lupin was supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood.
\par Harry ran forwards and seized George\rquote s legs. Together, he and Lupin carried George into the house and through the kitchen to the sitting room, where they laid him on the sofa. As the lamplight fell across George\rquote 
s head, Ginny gasped and Harry\rquote s stomach lurched: one of George\rquote s ears was missing. The side of his head and neck were drenched in wet, shockingly scarlet blood.
\par No sooner had Mrs Weasley bent over her son than Lupin grabbed Harry by the upper arm and dragged him, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where Hagrid was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door.
\par \lquote Oi!\rquote  said Hagrid indignantly. \lquote Le\rquote  go of him! Le\rquote  go of Harry!\rquote 
\par Lupin ignored him.
\par \lquote What creature sat in the corner, the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts?\rquote  he said, giving Harry a small shake. \lquote Answer me!\rquote 
\par \lquote A \endash  a Grindylow in a tank, wasn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard.
\par \lquote Wha\rquote  was tha\rquote  about?\rquote  roared Hagrid.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry, Harry, but I had to check,\rquote  said Lupin tersely. \lquote We\rquote 
ve been betrayed. Voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were directly involved in the plan. You might have been an impostor.\rquote 
\par \lquote So why aren\rquote  you checkin\rquote  me?\rquote  panted Hagrid, still struggling to fit through the door.
\par \lquote You\rquote re half-giant,\rquote  said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. \lquote The Polyjuice Potion is designed for human use only.\rquote 
\par \lquote None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight,\rquote  said Harry: the idea was dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of them. \lquote Voldemort only caught up with me towards the end, he didn\rquote 
t know which one I was in the begin\-ning. If he\rquote d been in on the plan, he\rquote d have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.\rquote 
\par \lquote Voldemort caught up with you?\rquote  said Lupin sharply. \lquote What happened? How did you escape?\rquote 
\par Harry explained, briefly, how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognise him as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they must have summoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he a
nd Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks\rquote s parents\rquote .
\par \lquote They recognised you? But how? What had you done?\rquote 
\par \lquote I ...\rquote  Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic and confusion. \lquote I saw Stan Shunpike ... you know, the bloke who was the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead of \endash 
 well, he doesn\rquote t know what he\rquote s doing, does he? He must be Imperiused!\rquote 
\par Lupin looked aghast.
\par \lquote Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren\rquote t prepared to kill!\rquote 
\par \lquote We were hundreds of feet up! Stan\rquote s not himself, and if I Stunned him and he\rquote d fallen he\rquote d have died the same as if I\rquote d used }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

tly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore\rquote s Army how to Disarm.
\par \lquote Yes, Harry,\rquote  said Lupin with painful restraint, \lquote and a great number of Death Eaters witnessed that happe
ning! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual move then, under imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal!\rquote 
\par \lquote So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?\rquote  said Harry angrily.
\par \lquote Of course not,\rquote  said Lupin, \lquote but the Death Eaters \endash  frankly, most people! \endash  would have expected you to attack back! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Expelliarmus }{

\par Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of defiance inside him.
\par \lquote I won\rquote t blast people out of my way just because they\rquote re there,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote That\rquote s Voldemort\rquote s job.\rquote 
\par Lupin\rquote s retort was lost: finally succeeding in squeezing through the door, Hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down; it collapsed beneath him. Ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies, Harry addressed Lupin again.
\par \lquote Will George be OK?\rquote 
\par All Lupin\rquote s frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the question.
\par \lquote I think so, although there\rquote s no chance of replacing his ear, not when it\rquote s been cursed off \endash \rquote 
\par There was a scuffling from outside. Lupin dived for the back door; Harry leapt over Hagrid\rquote s legs, and sprinted into the yard.
\par Two figures had appeared in the yard and as Harry ran towards them he realised they were Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat hanger. Hermione flung herself into Harry\rquote 
s arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them. Over Hermione\rquote s shoulder Harry saw him raise his wand and point it at Lupin\rquote s chest.
\par \lquote The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?\rquote

said Lupin calmly.
\par Kingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, \lquote It\rquote s him, I\rquote ve checked!\rquote 
\par \lquote All right, all right!\rquote  said Kingsley, stowing his wand back beneath his cloak. \lquote But somebody betrayed us! They knew, they knew it was tonight!\rquote 
\par \lquote So it seems,\rquote  replied Lupin, \lquote but apparently they did not realise that there would be seven Harrys.\rquote 
\par \lquote Small comfort!\rquote  snarled Kingsley. \lquote Who else is back?\rquote 
\par \lquote Only Harry, Hagrid, George and me.\rquote 
\par Hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand.
\par \lquote What happened to you?\rquote  Lupin asked Kingsley.
\par \lquote Followed by five, injured two, might\rquote ve killed one,\rquote  Kingsley reeled off, \lquote and we saw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase halfway through, but vanished pretty quickly. Remus, he can \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Fly,\rquote  supplied Harry. \lquote I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and me.\rquote 
\par \lquote So that\rquote s why he left \endash  to follow you!\rquote  said Kingsley. \lquote I couldn\rquote t understand why he\rquote d vanished. But what made him change targets?\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par \lquote Stan?\rquote  repeated Hermione. \lquote But I thought he was in Azkaban?\rquote 
\par Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh.
\par \lquote Hermione, there\rquote s obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has hushed up. Travers\rquote s hood fell off when I cursed him, he\rquote s supposed to be inside too. But what happened to you, Remus? Where\rquote s George?\rquote 

\par \lquote He lost an ear,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par \lquote Lost an \endash ?\rquote  repeated Hermione in a high voice.

\par Silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky. There was no sign of movement; the stars stared back, unblin
king, indifferent, unobscured by flying friends. Where was Ron? Where were Fred and Mr Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, Tonks, Mad-Eye and Mundungus?
\par \lquote Harry, give us a hand!\rquote  called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which he was stuck again. Glad of someth
ing to do, Harry pulled him free, then headed through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room, where Mrs Weasley and Ginny were still tending to George. Mrs Weasley had staunched his bleeding now, and by the lamplight Harry saw a clean, gaping ho
le where George\rquote s ear had been.
\par \lquote How is he?\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley looked round and said, \lquote I can\rquote t make it grow back, not when it\rquote s been removed by Dark Magic. But it could have been so much worse ... he\rquote s alive.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Thank God.\rquote 
\par \lquote Did I hear someone else in the yard?\rquote  Ginny asked.
\par \lquote Hermione and Kingsley,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Thank goodness,\rquote  Ginny whispered. They looked at each other; Harry wanted to hug her, hold on to her; he did not even care much that Mrs Weasley was there, but before he could act on the impulse there was a great crash from the kitchen.

\par \lquote I\rquote ll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I\rquote ve seen my son, now back off if you know what\rquote s good for you!\rquote 
\par Harry had never heard Mr Weasley shout like that before. He burst into the living room, his bald patch gleaming with sweat, his spectacles askew, Fred right behind him, both pale but uninjured.
\par \lquote Arthur!\rquote  sobbed Mrs Weasley. \lquote Oh thank goodness!\rquote 
\par \lquote How is he?\rquote 
\par Mr Weasley dropped to his knees beside George. For the first time since Harry had known him, Fred seemed to be lost for words. He gaped over the back of the sofa at his twin\rquote s wound as if he could not believe what he was seeing.
\par Perhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father\rquote s arrival, George stirred.
\par \lquote How do you feel, Georgie?\rquote  whispered Mrs Weasley.
\par George\rquote s fingers groped for the side of his head.
\par \lquote Saint-like,\rquote  he murmured.
\par \lquote What\rquote s wrong with him?\rquote  croaked Fred, looking terrified. \lquote Is his mind affected?\rquote 
\par \lquote Saint-like,\rquote  repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. \lquote You see ... I\rquote m holy. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Holey, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par He looked round.
\par \lquote Hi Harry \endash  you are Harry, right?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I am,\rquote  said Harry, moving closer to the sofa.
\par \lquote Well, at least we got you back OK,\rquote  said George. \lquote Why aren\rquote t Ron and Bill huddled round my sickbed?\rquote 
\par \lquote They\rquote re not back yet, George,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. George\rquote s grin faded. Harry glanced at Ginny and motioned to her to accompany him back outside. As they walked through the kit\-chen, she said in a low voice, \lquote Ro
n and Tonks should be back by now. They didn\rquote t have a long journey; Auntie Muriel\rquote s not that far from here.\rquote 
\par Harry said nothing. He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching The Burrow, but now it enveloped him, seeming to crawl over his skin
, throbbing in his chest, clogging his throat. As they walked down the back steps into the dark yard, Ginny took his hand.
\par Kingsley was striding backwards and forwards, glancing up at the sky every time he turned. Harry was reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing 
the living room a million years ago. Hagrid, Hermione and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upwards in silence. None of them looked round when Harry and Ginny joined their silent vigil.
\par The minutes stretched into what might as well have been years. The slightest breath of wind made them all jump and turn towards the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing Order members might leap unscathed from its leaves \endash 

\par And then a broom materialised directly above them and streaked towards the ground \endash 
\par \lquote It\rquote s them!\rquote  screamed Hermione.
\par Tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere.
\par \lquote Remus!\rquote  Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupin\rquote s arms. His face was set and white: he seemed unable to speak. Ron tripped dazedly towards Harry and Hermione.
\par \lquote You\rquote re OK,\rquote  he mumbled, before Hermione flew at him and hugged him tightly.
\par \lquote I thought \endash  I thought \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \rquote M all right,\rquote  said Ron, patting her on the back. \lquote \rquote M fine.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron was great,\rquote  said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on Lupin. \lquote Wonderful. Stunned one of the Death Eaters, straight to the head, and when you\rquote re aiming at a moving target from a flying broom \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You did?\rquote  said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms still around his neck.
\par \lquote Always the tone of surprise,\rquote  he said a little grumpily, breaking free. \lquote Are we the last back?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Ginny, \lquote we\rquote re still waiting for Bill and Fleur and Mad-Eye and Mundungus. I\rquote m going to tell Mum and Dad you\rquote re OK, Ron \endash \rquote 
\par She ran back inside.
\par \lquote So what kept you? What happened?\rquote  Lupin sounded almost angry at Tonks.
\par \lquote Bellatrix,\rquote  said Tonks. \lquote She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry, Remus, she tried very hard to kill me. I just wish I\rquote d got her, I owe Bellatrix. But we definitely injured Rodolphus ... then we got to Ron\rquote s Aun
tie Muriel\rquote s and we\rquote d missed our Portkey and she was fussing over us \endash \rquote 
\par A muscle was jumping in Lupin\rquote s jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to say anything else.
\par \lquote So what happened to you lot?\rquote  Tonks asked, turning to Harry, Hermione and Kingsley.
\par They recounted the stories of their own journeys, but all the time the continued absence of Bill, Fleur, Mad-Eye and Mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost, its icy bite harder and harder to ignore.
\par \lquote I\rquote m going to have to get back to Downing Street. I should have been there an hour ago,\rquote  said Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping gaze at the sky. \lquote Let me know when they\rquote re back.\rquote 
\par Lupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away into the darkness towards the gate. Harry thought he heard the faintest }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 pop }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 as Kingsley Disapparated just beyond The Burrow\rquote s boundaries.
\par Mr and Mrs Weasley came racing down the back steps, Ginny behind them. Both parents hugged Ron before turning to Lupin and Tonks.
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, \lquote for our sons.\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be silly, Molly,\rquote  said Tonks at once.
\par \lquote How\rquote s George?\rquote  asked Lupin.
\par \lquote What\rquote s wrong with him?\rquote  piped up Ron.
\par \lquote He\rquote s lost \endash \rquote 
\par But the end of Mrs Weasley\rquote s sentence was drowned in a general outcry: a Thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them. Bill and Fleur slid from its back, windswept but unhurt.
\par \lquote Bill! Thank God, thank God \endash \rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley ran forwards, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory. Looking directly at his father, he said, \lquote Mad-Eye\rquote s dead.\rquote 
\par Nobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though something inside him was falling, falling through the earth, leaving him forever.
\par \lquote We saw it,\rquote  said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the light from the kitchen window. \lquote It happened just after we broke out of t
he circle: Mad-Eye and Dung were close by us, they were heading north too. Voldemort \endash  he can fly \endash  went straight for them. Dung panicked, I heard him cry out, Mad-Eye tried to stop him, but he Disapparated. Voldemort\rquote 
s curse hit Mad-Eye full in the face, he fell backwards off his broom and \endash  there was nothing we could do, nothing, we had half a dozen of them on our own tail \endash \rquote 
\par Bill\rquote s voice broke.
\par \lquote Of course you couldn\rquote t have done anything,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par They all stood looking at each other. Harry could not quite comprehend it. Mad-Eye dead; it could not be ... Mad-Eye, so tough, so brave, the consummate survivor ...
\par At last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said it, that there was no point waiting in the yard any more, and in silence they followed
 Mr and Mrs Weasley back into The Burrow, and into the living room, where Fred and George were laughing together.
\par \lquote What\rquote s wrong?\rquote  said Fred, scanning their faces, as they entered. \lquote What\rquote s happened? Who\rquote s \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Mad-Eye,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote Dead.\rquote 
\par The twins\rquote  grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody seemed to know what to do. Tonks was crying silently into a hand\-kerchief: she had been close to Mad-Eye, Harry knew, his favourite and his prot\'e9g\'e9
e at the Ministry of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down on the floor in the corner where he had most space, was dabbing at his eyes with his tablecloth-sized handkerchief.
\par Bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of Firewhisky and some glasses.
\par \lquote Here,\rquote  he said, and with a wave of his wand he sent twelve full glasses soaring through the room to each of them, holding the thirteenth aloft. \lquote Mad-Eye.\rquote 
\par \lquote Mad-Eye,\rquote  they all said, and drank.
\par \lquote Mad-Eye,\rquote  echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccough.
\par The Firewhisky seared Harry\rquote s throat: it seemed to burn feeling back into him, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality, firing him with something that was like courage.
\par \lquote So Mundungus disappeared?\rquote  said Lupin, who had drained his own glass in one.
\par The atmosphere changed at once: everybody looked tense, watching Lupin, both wanting him to go on, it seemed to Harry, and slightly afraid of what they might hear.
\par \lquote I know what you\rquote re thinking,\rquote  said Bill, \lquote and I wondered that too, on the way back here, because they seemed to be expecting us, didn\rquote t they? But Mundungus can\rquote t have betrayed us. They didn\rquote 
t know there would be seven Harrys, that confused them the moment we appeared, and in case you\rquote ve forgotten, it was Mund\-ungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery. Why wouldn\rquote t 
he have told them the essential point? I think Dung panicked, it\rquote s as simple as that. He didn\rquote t want to come in the first place, but Mad-Eye made him, and You-Know-Who went straight for them: it was enough to make anyone panic.\rquote 

\par \lquote You-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected him to,\rquote  sniffed Tonks. \lquote Mad-Eye said he\rquote 
d expect the real Harry to be with the toughest, most skilled Aurors. He chased Mad-Eye first, and when Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley \'85\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, and zat eez all very good,\rquote  snapped Fleur, \lquote but still eet does not explain \rquote ow zey knew we were moving \rquote Arry tonight, does eet? Somebody must \rquote 
ave been careless. Somebody let slip ze date to an outsider. Eet eez ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze \rquote ole plan.\rquote 
\par She glare
d around at them all, tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face, silently daring any of them to contradict her. Nobody did. The only sound to break the silence was that of Hagrid hiccoughing from behind his handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, who 
had just risked his own life to save Harry\rquote s \endash  Hagrid, whom he loved, whom he trusted, who had once been tricked into giving Voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragon\rquote s egg ...
\par \lquote No,\rquote  Harry said aloud, and they all looked at him, surprised: the Firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice. \lquote I mean ... if somebody made a mistake,\rquote  Harry went on, \lquote and let something slip, I know they didn\rquote 
t mean to do it. It\rquote s not their fault,\rquote  he repeated, again a little louder than he would usually have spoken. \lquote We\rquote ve got to trust each other. I trust all of you, I don\rquote 
t think anyone in this room would ever sell me to Voldemort.\rquote 
\par More silence followed his words. They were all looking at him; Harry felt a little hot again, and drank some more Firewhisky for something to do. As he drank, he thought of Mad-Eye. Mad-Eye had always been scathing about Dumbledore\rquote 
s willingness to trust people.
\par \lquote Well said, Harry,\rquote  said Fred unexpectedly.
\par \lquote Yeah, \lquote ear, \lquote ear,\rquote  said George, with half a glance at Fred, the corner of whose mouth twitched.
\par Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at Harry: it was close to pitying.
\par \lquote You think I\rquote m a fool?\rquote  demanded Harry.
\par \lquote No, I think you\rquote re like James,\rquote  said Lupin, \lquote who would have regarded it as the height of dishonour to mistrust his friends.\rquote 
\par Harry knew what Lupin was getting at: that his father had been betrayed by his friend, Peter Pettigrew. He felt irrationally angry. He wanted to argue, but Lupin had turned away from him, set down his glass upon a side table and addressed Bill, \lquote 
There\rquote s work to do. I can ask Kingsley whether \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Bill at once, \lquote I\rquote ll do it, I\rquote ll come.\rquote 
\par \lquote Where are you going?\rquote  said Tonks and Fleur together.
\par \lquote Mad-Eye\rquote s body,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote We need to recover it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Can\rquote t it \endash ?\rquote  began Mrs Weasley, with an appealing look at Bill.
\par \lquote Wait?\rquote  said Bill. \lquote Not unless you\rquote d rather the Death Eaters took it?\rquote 
\par Nobody spoke. Lupin and Bill said goodbye and left.
\par The rest of them now dropped into chairs, all except for Harry, who remained standing. The suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve got to go too,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be silly, Harry,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. \lquote What are you talking about?\rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t stay here.\rquote 
\par He rubbed his forehead: it was prickling again; it had not hurt like this for more than a year.
\par \lquote You\rquote re all in danger while I\rquote m here. I don\rquote t want \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But don\rquote t be so silly!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. \lquote The whole point of tonight was to get you here safely, and thank goodness it worked. And Fleur\rquote s agreed to get married here rather than in France, we\rquote 
ve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you \endash \rquote 
\par She did not understand; she was making him feel worse, not better.
\par \lquote If Voldemort finds out I\rquote m here \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But why should he?\rquote  asked Mrs Weasley.
\par \lquote There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote He\rquote s got no way of knowing which safe house you\rquote re in.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s not me I\rquote m worried for!\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote We know that,\rquote  said Mr Weasley quietly, \lquote but it would make our efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yer not goin\rquote  anywhere,\rquote  growled Hagrid. \lquote Blimey, Harry, after all we wen\rquote  through ter get you here?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, what about my bleeding ear?\rquote  said George, hoisting him\-self up on his cushions.
\par \lquote I know that \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Mad-Eye wouldn\rquote t want \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I KNOW!\rquote  Harry bellowed.
\par He felt beleaguered and blackmailed: did they think he did not know what they had done for him, didn\rquote t they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he wanted 
to go now, before they had to suffer any more on his behalf? There was a long and awkward silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb, and which was broken at last by Mrs Weasley.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Hedwig, Harry?\rquote  she said coaxingly. \lquote We can put her up with Pigwidgeon and give her something to eat.\rquote 
\par His insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the truth. He drank the last of his Firewhisky to avoid answering.
\par \lquote Wait \rquote til it gets out yeh did it again, Harry,\rquote  said Hagrid. \lquote Escaped him, fought him off when he was right on top of yeh!\rquote 
\par \lquote It wasn\rquote t me,\rquote  said Harry flatly. \lquote It was my wand. My wand acted of its own accord.\rquote 
\par After a few moments, Hermione said gently, \lquote But that\rquote s impos\-sible, Harry. You mean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively.\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote The bike was falling, I couldn\rquote t have told you where Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him, and it wasn\rquote t even a spell I recognised. I\rquote 
ve never made gold flames appear before.\rquote 
\par \lquote Often,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, \lquote when you\rquote re in a pressured situation you can produce magic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before they\rquote re trained \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It wasn\rquote t like that,\rquote  said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was burning: he felt angry and frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagining him to have power to match Voldemort\rquote s.
\par No one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that he came to think of it, he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its own before.
\par His scar seared with pain; it was all he could do not to moan aloud. Muttering about fresh air, he set down his glass and left the room.
\par As he crossed the dark yard, the great, skeletal Thestral looked up, rustled its enormous bat-like wings, then resumed its grazing. Harry stopped at the gate into the garden, staring out at its over\-
grown plants, rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of Dumbledore.
\par Dumbledore would have believed him, he knew it. Dumbledore would have known how and why Harry\rquote s
 wand had acted independently, because Dumbledore always had the answers; he had known about wands, had explained to Harry the strange connection that existed between his wand and Voldemort\rquote 
s ... but Dumbledore, like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like his parents, like his poor owl, all were gone where Harry could never talk to them again. He felt a burning in his throat that had nothing to do with Firewhisky ...
\par And then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar peaked. As he clutched his forehead and closed his eyes, a voice screamed inside his head.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote You told me the problem would be solved by using another\rquote s wand!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par And into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags upon a stone floor, screaming, a horrible, drawn-out scream, a scream of unendurable agony ...
\par \lquote No! No! I beg you, I beg you ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!\rquote 
\par \lquote I did not ... I swear I did not ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!\rquote 
\par \lquote I swear I did not ... I believed a different wand would work \'85\rquote 
\par \lquote Explain, then, what happened. Lucius\rquote s wand is destroyed!\rquote 
\par \lquote I cannot understand ... the connection ... exists only ... between your two wands ...\rquote

\par \lquote Please ... I beg you \'85\rquote 
\par And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt Volde\-mort\rquote s surge of vicious anger, saw the frail old man on the floor writhe in agony \endash 
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote 
\par It was over as quickly as it had come: Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate into the garden, his heart racing, his scar still tingling. It was several moments before he realised that Ron and Hermione were at his side.
\par \lquote Harry, come back in the house,\rquote  Hermione whispered. \lquote You aren\rquote t still thinking of leaving?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, you\rquote ve got to stay, mate,\rquote  said Ron, thumping Harry on the back.
\par \lquote Are you all right?\rquote  Hermione asked, close enough now to look into Harry\rquote s face. \lquote You look awful!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Harry shakily, \lquote I probably look better than Ollivander ...\rquote 
\par When he had finished telling them what he had seen, Ron looked appalled, but Hermione downright terrified.
\par \lquote But it was supposed to have stopped! Your scar \endash  it wasn\rquote t supposed to do this any more! You mustn\rquote t let that connection open up again \endash  Dumbledore wanted you to close your mind!\rquote 
\par When he did not reply, she gripped his arm.
\par \lquote Harry, he\rquote s taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the wizarding world! Don\rquote t let him inside your head too!\rquote

The shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the house in the days that followed; Harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door like the other Order members, who passed in and out to relay news. Harry felt that nothing but action would assuag
e his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible.

\par \lquote No,\rquote  Harry admitted.
\par \lquote I think Hermione\rquote s been doing a bit of research,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote She said she was saving it for when you got here.\rquote

\par \lquote It\rquote s one extra day,\rquote  said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t they realise how important \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote \rquote Course they don\rquote t,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote They haven\rquote t got a clue. And now you mention it, I wanted to talk to you about that.\rquote 
\par Ron glanced towards the door into the hall to check that Mrs Weasley was not returning yet, then leaned in closer to Harry.
\par \lquote Mum\rquote s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What we\rquote re off to do. She\rquote ll try you next, so brace yourself. Dad and Lupin\rquote ve both asked as well, but when we said Dumbledore
 told you not to tell anyone except us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though. She\rquote s determined.\rquote 
\par Ron\rquote s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch, Mrs Weasley detached Harry from the others by asking him to help identify a lone man\rquote s sock that she
 thought might have come out of his rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off the kitchen, she started.
\par \lquote Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of Hogwarts,\rquote  she began in a light, casual tone.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Well, yeah. We are.\rquote 
\par The mangle turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out what looked like one of Mr Weasley\rquote s vests.
\par \lquote May I ask }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 why}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640  you are abandoning your education?\rquote  said Mrs Weasley.

\par \lquote Well, Dumbledore left me ... stuff to do,\rquote  mumbled Harry. \lquote Ron and Hermione know about it, and they want to come too.\rquote 
\par \lquote What sort of \'93stuff\'94?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry, I can\rquote t \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I\rquote m sure Mr and Mrs Granger would agree!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley. Harry had been afraid of the \lquote concerned parent\rquote 
 attack. He forced himself to look directly into her eyes, noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginny\rquote s. This did not help.
\par \lquote Dumbledore didn\rquote t want anyone else to know, Mrs Weasley. I\rquote m sorry. Ron and Hermione don\rquote t have to come, it\rquote s their choice \endash \rquote

 she snapped, dropping all pretence now. \lquote You\rquote re barely of age, any of you! It\rquote s utter nonsense, if Dumbledore neede

\par \lquote I didn\rquote t misunderstand,\rquote  said Harry flatly. \lquote It\rquote s got to be me.\rquote 
\par He handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be identifying, which was patterned with golden bulrushes.
\par \lquote And that\rquote s not mine, I don\rquote t support Puddlemere United.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, of course not,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley, with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual tone. \lquote I should have realised. Well, Harry, while we\rquote ve still got you here, you won\rquote 
t mind helping with the preparations for Bill and Fleur\rquote s wedding, will you? There\rquote s still so much to do.\rquote 
\par \lquote No \endash  I \endash  of course not,\rquote  said Harry, disconcerted by this sudden change of subject.
\par \lquote Sweet of you,\rquote  she replied, and she smiled as she left the scullery.
\par From that moment on, Mrs Weasley kept Harry, Ron and Hermione so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had time to think. The kindest e
xplanation of this behaviour would have been that Mrs Weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of Mad-Eye, and the terrors of their recent journey. After two days of non-stop cutlery cleaning, of colour-matching favours, ribbons and flowers, of d
e-gnoming the garden and helping Mrs Weasley cook vast batches of canap\'e9
s, however, Harry started to suspect her of a different motive. All the jobs she handed out seemed to keep him, Ron and Hermione away from one another; he had not had a chance to speak 
to the two of them, alone, since the first night, when he had told them about Voldemort torturing Ollivander.
\par \lquote I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning, she\rquote ll be able to delay you leaving,\rquote  Ginny told Harry in an undertone, as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay.
\par \lquote And then what does she think\rquote s going to happen?\rquote  Harry muttered. \lquote Someone else might kill off Voldemort while she\rquote s holding us here making vol-au-vents?\rquote 
\par He had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny\rquote s face whiten.
\par \lquote So it\rquote s true?\rquote  she said. \lquote That\rquote s what you\rquote re trying to do?\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  not \endash  I was joking,\rquote  said Harry evasively.
\par They stared at each other, and there was something more than shock in Ginny\rquote s expression. Suddenly Harry b
ecame aware that this was the first time that he had been alone with her since those stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds. He was sure she was remembering them too. Both of them jumped as the door opened, and Mr Weasley, Kingsley and B
ill walked in.
\par They were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because The Burrow had replaced number twelve, Grim\-mauld Place as the Headquarters. Mr Weasley had explained that after the death of Dumbledore, their Secret Keeper, each of the p
eople to whom Dumbledore had confided Grimmauld Place\rquote s location had become a Secret Keeper in turn.
\par \lquote And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the power of the Fidelius Charm. Twenty times as many opportunities for the Death Eaters to get the secret out of somebody. We can\rquote t expect it to hold much longer.\rquote 
\par \lquote But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by now?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns up there again. We hope they\rquote ll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place, but we can\rquote 
t be sure. It would have been insane to keep using the place as Headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky.\rquote 
\par The kitchen was so cro
wded that evening it was difficult to manoeuvre knives and forks. Harry found himself crammed beside Ginny; the unsaid things that had just passed between them made him wish they had been separated by a few more people. He was trying so hard to avoid brus
hing her arm he could barely cut his chicken.
\par \lquote No news about Mad-Eye?\rquote  Harry asked Bill.
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  replied Bill.
\par They had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, because Bill and Lupin had failed to recover his body. It had been difficult to know where he might have fallen, given the darkness and the confusion of the battle.
\par \lquote The }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 hasn\rquote

\par \lquote And they still haven\rquote t called a hearing about all the under-age magic I used escaping the Death Eaters?\rquote  Harry called across the table to Mr Weasley, who shook his head. \lquote Because they know I had no choice or because they don
\rquote t want me to tell the world Voldemort attacked me?\rquote 
\par \lquote The latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn\rquote t want to admit that You-Know-Who is as powerful as he is, nor that Azkaban\rquote s seen a mass breakout.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, why tell the public the truth?\rquote  said Harry, clenching his knife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out, white against his skin: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Isn\rquote t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?\rquote  asked Ron angrily.
\par \lquote Of course, Ron, but people are terrified,\rquote  Mr Weasley replied, \lquote terrified that they will be next to disappear, their children the next to be attacked! There are nasty rumours going round; I, for one, don\rquote 
t believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned. She hasn\rquote t been seen for weeks now. Meanwhile, Scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day: I just hope he\rquote s working on a plan.\rquote 
\par There was a pause in which Mrs Weasley magicked the empty plates on to the side, and served apple tart.
\par \lquote We must decide \rquote ow you will be disguised, \rquote Arry,\rquote  said Fleur, once everyone had pudding. \lquote For ze wedding,\rquote  she added, when he looked confused. \lquote 
Of course, none of our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey \rquote ave \rquote ad champagne.\rquote 
\par From this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid.
\par \lquote Yes, good point,\rquote  said Mrs Weasley from the top of the table, where she sat, spectacles perched on the end of her nose, scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment. \lquote 
Now, Ron, have you cleaned out your room yet?\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Why?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\par \lquote We are holding your brother\rquote s wedding here in a few days\rquote  time, young man \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote And are they getting married in my bedroom?\rquote  asked Ron furiously. \lquote No! So why in the name of Merlin\rquote s saggy left \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t talk to your mother like that,\rquote  said Mr Weasley firmly. \lquote And do as you\rquote re told.\rquote 
\par Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart.
\par \lquote I can help, some of it\rquote s my mess,\rquote  Harry told Ron, but Mrs Weasley cut across him.
\par \lquote No, Harry, dear, I\rquote d much rather you helped Arthur muck out the chickens, and Hermione, I\rquote d be ever so grateful if you\rquote d change the sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour, you know they\rquote 
re arriving at eleven tomorrow morning.\rquote 
\par But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens.
\par \lquote There\rquote s no need to, er, mention it to Molly,\rquote  Mr Weasley told Harry, blocking his access to the coop, \lquote but, er, Ted Tonks sent me most of what was left of Sirius\rquote s bike and, er, I\rquote m hiding \endash  that\rquote

\par \lquote I\rquote m doing it, I\rquote m doing \endash ! Oh, it\rquote s you,\rquote  said Ron in relief, as Harry entered the room. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had evidently just vacated. The room was just as messy as 
it had been all week; the only change was that Hermione was now sitting in the far corner, her fluffy ginger cat Crookshanks at her feet, sorting books, some of which Harry recognised as his own, into two enormous piles.
\par \lquote Hi, Harry,\rquote  she said, as he sat down on his camp bed.

\par But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings Ron bounded off the bed and got there first. One arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking hand\-
kerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier. Hastily pulling out his wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Tergeo.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par The wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with himself, Ron handed the slightly smoking hand\-kerchief to Hermione.
\par \lquote Oh ... thanks, Ron ... I\rquote m sorry ...\rquote  She blew her nose and hiccoughed. \lquote It\rquote s just so awf \endash  ful, isn\rquote t it? R \endash  Right after Dumbledore ... I j \endash

\par \lquote \'93C \endash  Constant vigilance\'94,\rquote  said Hermione, mopping her eyes.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Ron, nodding. \lquote He\rquote d tell us to learn from what happened to him. And what I\rquote ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit Mundungus.\rquote 
\par Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forwards to pick up two more books. A second later, Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders; she had dropped }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
The Monster Book of Monsters }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 on his foot. The book had broken free from its restrain\-ing belt and snapped viciously at Ron\rquote s ankle.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry, I\rquote m sorry!\rquote  Hermione cried, as Harry wrenched the book from Ron\rquote s leg and retied it shut.
\par \lquote What are you doing with all those books, anyway?\rquote  Ron asked, limping back to his bed.
\par \lquote Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote When we\rquote re looking for the Horcruxes.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, of course,\rquote  said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. \lquote I forgot we\rquote ll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.\rquote

\par \lquote I\rquote ve also modified my parents\rquote  memories so that they\rquote re convinced they\rquote re really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life\rquote s ambition is to move to Australia, which they have now done. That\rquote

\par \lquote Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I\rquote ll find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I don\rquote t \endash  well, I think I\rquote ve cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins don\rquote 
t know that they\rquote ve got a daughter, you see.\rquote 
\par Hermione\rquote s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off the bed, put his arm around her once more and frowned at Harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact. Harry could not think of anything to say, not least because it was
 highly unusual for Ron to be teaching anyone else tact.
\par \lquote I \endash  Hermione, I\rquote m sorry \endash  I didn\rquote t \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Didn\rquote t realise that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you? Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what you\rquote ve done.\rquote 
\par \lquote Nah, he\rquote s just eaten,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Go on, he needs to know!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, all right. Harry, come here.\rquote 
\par For the second time, Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and stumped over to the door.
\par \lquote C\rquote mon.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why?\rquote  Harry asked, following Ron out of the room on to the tiny landing.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Descendo,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A hatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet. A horrible half-sucking, half-moaning sound came out of the square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open drains.

\par \lquote That\rquote s your ghoul, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  asked Harry, who had never actu\-ally met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence.
\par \lquote Yeah, it is,\rquote  said Ron, climbing the ladder. \lquote Come and have a look at him.\rquote 
\par Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space. His head and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from him, fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open.
\par \lquote But it ... it looks ... Do ghouls normally wear pyjamas?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules.\rquote 
\par Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in shape and size, and was wearing what, now Harry\rquote s eyes became used to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron\rquote s py
jamas. He was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters.
\par \lquote He\rquote s me, see?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I don\rquote t.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll explain it back in my room, the smell\rquote s getting to me,\rquote  said Ron. They climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books.
\par \lquote Once we\rquote ve left, the ghoul\rquote s going to come and live down here in my room,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I think he\rquote s really looking forward to it \endash  well, it\rquote s hard to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool 
\endash  but he nods a lot when you mention it. Anyway, he\rquote s going to be me with spattergroit. Good, eh?\rquote 
\par Harry merely looked his confusion.
\par \lquote It is!\rquote  said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan. \lquote Look, when we three don\rquote t turn up at Hogwarts again, everyone\rquote 
s going to think Hermione and I must be with you, right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if they\rquote ve got information on where you are.\rquote 
\par \lquote But hopefully it\rquote ll look like I\rquote ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot of Muggle-borns are talking about going into hiding at the moment,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote We can\rquote t hide my whole family, it\rquote ll look too fishy and they can\rquote t all leave their jobs,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote So we\rquote re going to put out the story that I\rquote m seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I can
\rquote t go back to school. If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can show them the ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules. Spattergroit\rquote s really contagious, so they\rquote re not going to want to go near him. It won\rquote 
t matter that he can\rquote t say anything, either, because apparently you can\rquote t once the fungus has spread to your uvula.\rquote 
\par \lquote And your mum and dad are in on this plan?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Dad is. He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul. Mum ... well, you\rquote ve seen what she\rquote s like. She won\rquote t accept we\rquote re going \rquote til we\rquote ve gone.\rquote 
\par There was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds, as Hermione continued to throw books on to one pile
 or the other. Ron sat watching her, and Harry looked from one to the other, unable to say anything. The measures they had taken to protect their families made him realise, more than anything else could have done, that they really were going to come with 
him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be. He wanted to tell them what that meant to him, but he simply could not find words important enough.
\par Through the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs Weasley shouting from four floors below.
\par \lquote Ginny\rquote s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days before the wedding.\rquote 
\par \lquote Fleur\rquote s sister\rquote s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal and she\rquote s too young to come on her own,\rquote  said Hermione, as she pored indecisively over }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I\rquote d agree with you,\rquote  said Harry, who did not believe that Hermione really under\-stood his desire to return to Godric\rquote s Hollow. His parents\rquote 
 graves were only part of the attraction: he had a strong, though inexplic\-able, feeling that the place held answers for him. Perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived Voldemort\rquote 
s Killing Curse; now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the place where it had happened, wanting to understand.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you think there\rquote s a possibility that Voldemort\rquote s keeping a watch on Godric\rquote s Hollow?\rquote  Hermione asked. \lquote He might expect you to go back and visit your parents\rquote  graves once you\rquote 
re free to go wherever you like?\rquote 
\par This had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to find a counter-argument, Ron spoke up, evidently following his own train of thought.
\par \lquote This R.A.B. person,\rquote  he said. \lquote You know, the one who stole the real locket?\rquote

\par \lquote Yes, but we\rquote re still going to have to try and trace the real locket, aren\rquote t we?\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote To find out whether or not it\rquote s destroyed.\rquote 
\par \lquote And once we get hold of it, how }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 do }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 you destroy a Horcrux?\rquote  asked Ron.

\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote I\rquote ve been researching that.\rquote 
\par \lquote How?\rquote  asked Harry. \lquote I didn\rquote t think there were any books on Horcruxes in the library?\rquote 
\par \lquote There weren\rquote t,\rquote  said Hermione, who had turned pink. \lquote Dumbledore removed them all, but he \endash  he didn\rquote t destroy them.\rquote 
\par Ron sat up straight, wide-eyed.
\par \lquote How in the name of Merlin\rquote s pants have you managed to get your hands on those Horcrux books?\rquote 
\par \lquote It \endash  it wasn\rquote t stealing!\rquote  said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron with a kind of desperation. \lquote They were still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 really }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 didn\rquote t want anyone to get at them, I\rquote m sure he would have made it much harder to 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Get to the point!\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Well ... it was easy,\rquote  said Hermione in a small voice. \lquote I just did a Summoning Charm. You know \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 accio. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 And \endash  they zoomed out of Dumbledore\rquote s study window right into the girls\rquote  dormitory.\rquote 
\par \lquote But when did you do this?\rquote  Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a mixture of admiration and incredulity.
\par \lquote Just after his \endash  Dumbledore\rquote s \endash  funeral,\rquote  said Hermione, in an even smaller voice. \lquote Right after we agreed we\rquote 
d leave school and go and look for the Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get my things, it \endash  it just 
occurred to me that the more we knew about them, the better it would be ... and I was alone in there ... so I tried ... and it worked. They flew straight in through the open window and I \endash  I packed them.\rquote 
\par She swallowed and then said imploringly, \lquote I can\rquote t believe Dumbledore would have been angry, it\rquote s not as though we\rquote re going to use the information to make a Horcrux, is it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Can you hear us complaining?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Where are these books, anyway?\rquote 
\par Hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large volume, bound in faded, black leather. She looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something recently dead.
\par \lquote This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Secrets of the Darkest Art \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 it\rquote s a horrible book, really awful, full of evil magic. I wonder when Dumbledore removed it from the library ... if he didn\rquote 
t do it until he was Headmaster, I bet Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he\rquote d already read that?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about them. I think you\rquote 
re right, Hermione, that could easily have been where he got the information.\rquote 
\par \lquote And the more I\rquote ve read about them,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote the more horrible they seem, and the less I can believe that he actually made six. It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it, and that
\rquote s just by making one Horcrux!\rquote 
\par Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said, about Voldemort moving beyond \lquote usual evil\rquote .
\par \lquote Isn\rquote t there any way of putting yourself back together?\rquote  Ron asked.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Hermione, with a hollow smile, \lquote but it would be excruciatingly painful.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why? How do you do it?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Remorse,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote You\rquote ve got to really feel what you\rquote ve done. There\rquote s a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can\rquote t see Voldemort attempting it, somehow, can you?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Ron, before Harry could answer. \lquote So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if exam\-ining rotting entrails, \lquote because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I\rquote ve read, what Harry did to Riddle
\rquote s diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.\rquote 
\par \lquote What, stabbing it with a Basilisk fang?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Oh, well, lucky we\rquote ve got such a large supply of Basilisk fangs, then,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I was wondering what we were going to do with them.\rquote 
\par \lquote It doesn\rquote t have to be a Basilisk fang,\rquote  said Hermione patiently. \lquote It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can\rquote t repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it\rquote s incredibly rare 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  phoenix tears,\rquote  said Harry, nodding.
\par \lquote Exactly,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as Basilisk venom, and they\rquote re all dangerous to carry around with you. That\rquote s a problem we\rquote 
re going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing or crushing a Horcrux won\rquote t do the trick. You\rquote ve got to put it beyond magical repair.\rquote 
\par \lquote But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote why can\rquote t the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.\rquote 
\par Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on, \lquote Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn\rquote t damage your soul at all.\rquote 
\par \lquote Which would be a real comfort to me, I\rquote m sure,\rquote  said Ron.
\par Harry laughed.
\par \lquote It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote But it\rquote 
s the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can\rquote t exist without it.\rquote 
\par \lquote That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,\rquote  said Harry, remem\-bering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemort\rquote s soul as it vanished.
\par \lquote And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but, obviously, it came back good as new.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hang on,\rquote  said Ron, frowning. \lquote The bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny, wasn\rquote t it? How does that work, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object. I don\rquote t mean holding it for too long, it\rquote s nothing to do with touch\-ing it,\rquote 
 she added, before Ron could speak. \lquote I mean close emotion\-ally. Ginny poured her heart out into that diary, she made herself incredibly vulnerable. You\rquote re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.\rquote 
\par \lquote I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Why didn\rquote t I ask him? I never really \'85\rquote 
\par His voice tailed away: he was thinkin
g of all the things he should have asked Dumbledore, and of how, since the Headmaster had died, it seemed to Harry that he had wasted so many opportunities, when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more ... to find out everything ...
\par The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wall-shaking crash. Hermione shrieked and dropped }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Secrets of the Darkest Art; }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper and sma
cked his head on the opposite wall, and Harry instinctively dived for his wand before realising that he was looking up at Mrs Weasley, whose hair was dishev\-elled and whose face was contorted with rage.
\par \lquote I\rquote m so sorry to break up this cosy little gathering,\rquote  she said, her voice trembling. \lquote I\rquote 
m sure you all need your rest ... but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yes,\rquote  said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt to her feet, sending books flying in every direction, \lquote we will ... we\rquote re sorry ...\rquote 
\par With an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried out of the room after Mrs Weasley.
\par \lquote It\rquote s like being a house-elf,\rquote  complained Ron in an undertone, still massaging his head as he and Harry followed. \lquote Except without the job-satisfaction. The sooner this wedding\rquote s over, the happier I\rquote ll be.\rquote 

\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote then we\rquote ll have nothing to do except find Horcruxes ... it\rquote ll be like a holiday, won\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par Ron started to laugh, but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents waiting for them in Mrs Weasley\rquote s room, stopped quite abruptly.
\par The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o\rquote clock. Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny were feeling quite resentful towards Fleur\rquote 
s family by this time, and it was with an ill grace that Ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry attempted to flatten his hair. Once they had all been deemed smart enough, they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await
 the visitors.
\par Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty caul\-drons and old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby Bushes standing either side of the door in large pots; th
ough there was no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens had been shut away, the yard had been swept and the nearby garden had been pruned, plucked and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked it in its 
overgrown state, thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes.
\par He had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon The Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no lo
nger possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place. Mr Weasley had therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were to arrive by Portkey. The first sound of their approach was an unusually high-pitched laugh,
 which turned out to be coming from Mr Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, laden with luggage and leading a beautiful, blonde woman in long, leaf-green robes, who could only be Fleur\rquote s mother.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Maman!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 cried Fleur, rushing forwards to embrace her. }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par Monsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was a head shorter and extremely plump, with a little, pointed, black beard. However, he looked good-natured. Bouncing towards Mrs Weasley on high-heeled boots, he kissed her twic
e on each cheek, leaving her flustered.
\par \lquote You \rquote ave been to much trouble,\rquote  he said in a deep voice. \lquote Fleur tells us you \rquote ave been working very \rquote ard.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, it\rquote s been nothing, nothing!\rquote  trilled Mrs Weasley. \lquote No trouble at all!\rquote 
\par Ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from behind one of the new Flutterby Bushes.
\par \lquote Dear lady!\rquote  said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs Weas\-ley\rquote s hand between his own two plump ones and beaming. \lquote We are most honoured at the approaching union of our two families! Let me present my wife, Apolline.\rquote 

\par Madame Delacour glided forwards and stooped to kiss Mrs Weasley too.

\par Mr Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs Weasley threw him a look, upon which he became immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend.
\par \lquote And, of course, you \rquote ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!\rquote  said Monsieur Delacour. Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, 
with waist-length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glow\-ing look, batting her eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly.
\par \lquote Well, come in, do!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley brightly, and she ushered the Delacours into the house, with many \lquote No, please!\rquote s and \lquote After you!\rquote s and \lquote Not at all!\rquote s.
\par The Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests. They were pleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding. Monsieur Delacour pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids\rquote  shoes }{

hold spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice; Gabrielle followed her elder sister around, trying to assist in any way she could and jabbering away in rapid French.
\par On the downside, The Burrow was not built to accommodate so many people. Mr and Mrs Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room, having shouted down Monsieur and Madame Delacour\rquote s protests and insisted they take their bedroom.
\par Gabrielle was sleeping with Fleur in Percy\rquote s old room and Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best man, once Charlie arrived from Romania. Opportunities to make plans together became virtually non-existe

 snarled Ron, as their second attempt at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of Mrs Weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms.
\par \lquote Oh, good, you\rquote ve fed the chickens,\rquote  she called as she approached them. \lquote We\rquote d better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow ... to put up the tent for the wedding,\rquote 
 she explained, pausing to lean against the hen house. She looked exhausted. \lquote Millamant\rquote s Magic Marquees ... they\rquote re very good. Bill\rquote s escorting them ... you\rquote d better stay inside while they\rquote 
re here, Harry. I must say it does complicate organising a wedding, having all these security spells around the place.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry,\rquote  said Harry humbly.
\par \lquote Oh, don\rquote t be silly, dear!\rquote  said Mrs Weasley at once. \lquote I didn\rquote t mean \endash  well, your safety\rquote s much more important! Actually, I\rquote 
ve been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday, Harry. Seventeen, after all, it\rquote s an important day ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t want a fuss,\rquote  said Harry quickly, envisaging the add\-itional strain this would put on them all. \lquote Really, Mrs Weasley, just a normal dinner would be fine ... it\rquote s the day before the wedding ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, well, if you\rquote re sure, dear. I\rquote ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall I? And how about Hagrid?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote d be great,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote But please don\rquote t go to loads of trouble.\rquote 
\par \lquote Not at all, not at all ... it\rquote s no trouble \'85\rquote 
\par She looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little sadly, straightened up and walked away. Harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line, and the damp clothes rose into th

\par \lquote You were muttering in your sleep.\rquote

y my brother Fabian\rquote s and he wasn\rquote t terribly careful with his possessions, it\rquote s a bit dented on the back, but \endash \rquote 
\par The rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her. He tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understoo
d them, because she patted his cheek clumsily when he released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan on to the floor.
\par \lquote Happy birthday, Harry!\rquote  said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile. \lquote It\rquote s not much, but I hope you like it. What did you get him?\rquote 
 she added to Ron, who seemed not to hear her.
\par \lquote Come on, then, open Hermione\rquote s!\rquote  said Ron.
\par She had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages contained an enchanted razor from Bill and Fleur (\lquote Ah yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever \rquote ave,\rquote  Monsieur Delacour assured him, \lquote 
but you must tell it clearly what you want ... ozzerwise you might find you \rquote ave a leetle less hair zan you would like ...\rquote ), chocolates from the Delacours and an enormous box of the latest Weasleys\rquote 
 Wizard Wheezes merchandise from Fred and George.
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame Delacour, Fleur and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll pack these for you,\rquote  Hermione said brightly, taking Harry\rquote s presents out of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs. \lquote I\rquote m nearly done, I\rquote 
m just waiting for the rest of your pants to come out of the wash, Ron \endash \rquote 
\par Ron\rquote s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing.
\par \lquote Harry, will you come in here a moment?\rquote 
\par It was Ginny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him by the elbow and tugged him on up the stairs. Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room.
\par He had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There was a large poster of the wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall, and a picture of Gwenog Jones, Captain of the all-witch Quidditch team th
e Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A desk stood facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and Ginny had once played two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Hermione, and which now housed a large, pearly-white marquee. The golden flag on 
top was level with Ginny\rquote s window.
\par Ginny looked up into Harry\rquote s face, took a deep breath and said, \lquote Happy seventeenth.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... thanks.\rquote 
\par She was looking at him steadily; he, however, found it difficult to look back at her; it was like gazing into a brilliant light.
\par \lquote Nice view,\rquote  he said feebly, pointing towards the window.
\par She ignored this. He could not blame her.
\par \lquote I couldn\rquote t think what to get you,\rquote  she said.
\par \lquote You didn\rquote t have to get me anything.\rquote 
\par She disregarded this too.
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you wouldn\rquote t be able to take it with you.\rquote 
\par He chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of the many wonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes thought that having six brothers must have toughened her up.
\par She took a step closer to him.
\par \lquote So then I thought, I\rquote d like you to have something to remember me by, you know, if you meet some Veela when you\rquote re off doing whatever you\rquote re doing.\rquote 
\par \lquote I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be honest.\rquote 
\par \lquote There\rquote s the silver lining I\rquote ve been looking for,\rquote 
 she whispered, and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was kissing her back, and it was blissful oblivion, better than Firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world, Ginny, the feel of her, one hand at her back a
nd one in her long, sweet-smelling hair \endash 
\par The door banged open behind them and they jumped apart.
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Ron pointedly. \lquote Sorry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron!\rquote  Hermione was just behind him, slightly out of breath. There was a strained silence, then Ginny said in a flat little voice, \lquote Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry.\rquote 
\par Ron\rquote s ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam the door in their faces, but it felt as though a cold draught had entered the room when the door opened and his shining moment had popped li
ke a soap bubble. All the reasons for ending his relationship with Ginny, for staying well away from her, seemed to have slunk inside the room with Ron, and all happy forgetfulness was gone.
\par He looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, though he hardly knew what, but she had turned her back on him. He thought that she might have succumbed, for once, to tears. He could not do anything to comfort her in front of Ron.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll see you later,\rquote  he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom.
\par Ron marched downstairs, through the still crowded kitchen and into the yard, and Harry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along behind them looking scared.
\par Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron rounded on Harry.
\par \lquote You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m not messing her around,\rquote  said Harry, as Hermione caught up with them.
\par \lquote Ron \endash \rquote 
\par But Ron held up a hand to silence her.
\par \lquote She was really cut up when you ended it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn\rquote t because I wanted to.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she\rquote s just going to get her hopes up again \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s not an idiot, she knows it can\rquote t happen, she\rquote s not expect\-ing us to \endash  to end up married, or \endash \rquote 
\par As he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry\rquote 
s mind of Ginny in a white dress, marrying a tall, faceless and unpleasant stranger. In one spiralling moment it seemed to hit him: her future was free and unencumbered, whereas his ... he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead.
\par \lquote If you keep groping her every chance you get \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It won\rquote t happen again,\rquote  said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but he felt as though the sun had gone in. \lquote OK?\rquote 
\par Ron looked half-resentful, half-sheepish; he rocked backwards and forwards on his feet for a moment, then said, \lquote Right then, well, that\rquote s ... yeah.\rquote 
\par Ginny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with Harry for the rest of the day, nor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite conversation in her room. Nevertheless, Charlie\rquote s arrival cam
e as a relief to Harry. It pro\-vided a distraction, watching Mrs Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise her wand threateningly and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut.
\par As Harry\rquote s birthday dinner would have stretched The Burrow\rquote s kitchen t
o breaking point even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks and Hagrid, several tables were placed end to end in the garden. Fred and George bewitched a number of purple lanterns, all emblazoned with a large number \lquote 17\rquote 
, to hang in mid-air over the guests. Thanks to Mrs Weasley\rquote s ministrations, George\rquote s wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head, despite the twins\rquote  many jokes about it.
\par Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes.
\par \lquote Nice,\rquote  said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione turned the leaves on the crab-apple tree to gold. \lquote You\rquote ve really got an eye for that sort of thing.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you, Ron!\rquote  said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused. Harry turned away, smiling to himself. He had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches; }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 he caught Ginny\rquote 
s eye and grinned at her, before remembering his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a con\-versation with Monsieur Delacour.
\par \lquote Out of the way, out of the way!\rquote  sang Mrs Weasley, coming through the gate with what appeared to be a giant, beach-ball-size
d Snitch floating in front of her. Seconds later Harry realised that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs Weasley was suspending with her wand rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground. When the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table,
 Harry said, \lquote That looks amazing, Mrs Weasley.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, it\rquote s nothing, dear,\rquote  she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron gave Harry the thumbs up and mouthed, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Good one.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par By seven o\rquote 
clock, all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, who had waited for them at the end of the lane. Hagrid had honoured the occasion by wearing his best, and horrible, hairy brown suit. Although Lupin smiled as he shook Harry\rquote 
s hand, Harry thought he looked rather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside him, looked simply radiant.
\par \lquote Happy birthday, Harry,\rquote  she said, hugging him tightly.
\par \lquote Seventeen, eh!\rquote  said Hagrid, as he accepted a bucket-sized glass of wine from Fred. \lquote Six years ter the day since we met, Harry, d\rquote yeh remember it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Vaguely,\rquote  said Harry, grinning up at him. \lquote Didn\rquote t you smash down the front door, give Dudley a pig\rquote s tail and tell me I was a wizard?\rquote 
\par \lquote I forge\rquote  the details,\rquote  Hagrid chortled. \lquote All righ\rquote , Ron, Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re fine,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote How are you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns, I\rquote ll show yeh when yeh get back \endash \rquote  Harry avoided Ron and Hermione\rquote s gaze as Hagrid rummaged in his pocket. \lquote Here, Harry \endash  couldn\rquote 
 think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this.\rquote  He pulled out a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck. \lquote Mokeskin. Hide anythin\rquote  in there an\rquote 
 no one but the owner can get it out. They\rquote re rare, them.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hagrid, thanks!\rquote 
\par \lquote \rquote S\rquote nothin\rquote ,\rquote  said Hagrid, with a wave of a dustbin-lid-sized hand. \lquote An\rquote  there\rquote s Charlie! Always liked him \endash  hey! Charlie!\rquote 
\par Charlie approached, running his hand slightly ruefully over his new, brutally short haircut. He was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of burns and scratches up his muscly arms.
\par \lquote Hi, Hagrid, how\rquote s it going?\rquote 
\par \lquote Bin meanin\rquote  ter write fer ages. How\rquote s Norbert doin\rquote ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Norbert?\rquote  Charlie laughed. \lquote The Norwegian Ridgeback? We call her Norberta now.\rquote 
\par \lquote Wha \endash  Norbert\rquote s a girl?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yeah,\rquote  said Charlie.
\par \lquote How can you tell?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote They\rquote re a lot more vicious,\rquote  said Charlie. He looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice. \lquote Wish Dad would hurry up and get here. Mum\rquote s getting edgy.\rquote 
\par They all looked over at Mrs Weasley. She was trying to talk to Madame Delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate.
\par \lquote I think we\rquote d better start without Arthur,\rquote  she called to the garden at large after a moment or two. \lquote He must have been held up at \endash  oh!\rquote 
\par They all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that came flying across the yard and on to the table, where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel, which stood on its hind legs and spoke with Mr Weasley\rquote s voice.
\par \lquote Minister for Magic coming with me.\rquote 
\par The Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur\rquote s family peering in astonishment at the place where it had vanished.
\par \lquote We shouldn\rquote t be here,\rquote  said Lupin at once. \lquote Harry \endash  I\rquote m sorry \endash  I\rquote ll explain another time \endash \rquote 
\par He seized Tonks\rquote s wrist and pulled her away; they reached the fence, climbed over it and vanished from sight. Mrs Weasley looked bewildered.
\par \lquote The Minister \endash  but why \endash ? I don\rquote t understand \endash \rquote 
\par But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr Weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly recognisable by his mane of grizzled hair.
\par The two newcomers marched across the yard towards the garden and the lantern-lit table, where everybody sat in silence, watching them draw closer. As Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light, Ha
rry saw that he looked much older than the last time they had met, scraggy and grim.
\par \lquote Sorry to intrude,\rquote  said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the table. \lquote Especially as I can see that I am gatecrashing a party.\rquote 
\par His eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake.
\par \lquote Many happy returns.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote I require a private word with you,\rquote  Scrimgeour went on. \lquote Also with Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger.\rquote 
\par \lquote Us?\rquote  said Ron, sounding surprised. \lquote Why us?\rquote 
\par \lquote I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,\rquote  said Scrimgeour. \lquote Is there such a place?\rquote  he demanded of Mr Weasley.
\par \lquote Yes, of course,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, who looked nervous. \lquote The, er, sitting room, why don\rquote t you use that?\rquote 
\par \lquote You can lead the way,\rquote  Scrimgeour said to Ron. \lquote There will be no need for you to accompany us, Arthur.\rquote 
\par Harry saw Mr Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs Weasley as he, Ron and Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew that the oth
er two were thinking the same as he was: Scrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts.
\par Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messy kitchen and into The Burrow\rquote s sitting room. Although
 the garden had been full of soft, golden evening light, it was already dark in here: Harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but cosy room. Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that Mr Weasley norma
lly occupied, leaving Harry, Ron and Hermione to squeeze side by side on the sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke.
\par \lquote I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if we do it individually. If you two,\rquote  he pointed at Harry and Hermione, \lquote can wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald.\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re not going anywhere,\rquote  said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously. \lquote You can speak to us together, or not at all.\rquote 
\par Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression that the Minister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early.
\par \lquote Very well, then, together,\rquote  he said, shrugging. He cleared his throat. \lquote I am here, as I\rquote m sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore\rquote s will.\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione looked at one another.
\par \lquote A surprise, apparently! You were not aware, then, that Dumbledore had left you anything?\rquote 
\par \lquote A \endash  all of us?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Me and Hermione too?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, all of \endash \rquote 
\par But Harry interrupted.
\par \lquote Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give us what he left us?\rquote 
\par \lquote Isn\rquote t it obvious?\rquote  said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer. \lquote They wanted to examine whatever he\rquote s left us. You had no right to do that!\rquote  she said, and her voice trembled slightly.
\par \lquote I had every right,\rquote  said Scrimgeour dismissively. \lquote The Decree for Justifiable Confiscation gives the Ministry the power to confiscate the contents of a will \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artefacts,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased\rquote 
s possessions are illegal before seizing them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed?\rquote 
\par \lquote Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?\rquote  asked Scrimgeour.
\par \lquote No I\rquote m not,\rquote  retorted Hermione. \lquote I\rquote m hoping to do some good in the world!\rquote 
\par Ron laughed. Scrimgeour\rquote s eyes flickered towards him and away again as Harry spoke.
\par \lquote So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can\rquote t think of a pretext to keep them?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, it\rquote ll be because the thirty-one days are up,\rquote  said Hermione at once. \lquote They can\rquote t keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they\rquote re dangerous. Right?\rquote 
\par \lquote Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?\rquote  asked Scrimgeour, ignoring Hermione. Ron looked startled.
\par \lquote Me? Not \endash  not really ... it was always Harry who ...\rquote 
\par Ron looked round at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving him a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 stop-talking-now! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 sort of look, but the damage was done: Scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear. He swooped like a bird of prey upon Ron\rquote s answer.
\par \lquote If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will? He made exceptionally few personal bequests. The vast majority of his possessions \endash 
 his private library, his magical instruments and other personal effects \endash  were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?\rquote 
\par \lquote I ... dunno,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I ... when I say we weren\rquote t close ... I mean, I think he liked me ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re being modest, Ron,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Dumbledore was very fond of you.\rquote 
\par This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry knew, Ron and Dumbledore had never been alone together, and direct con
tact between them had been negligible. However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. From it he removed a scroll of parchment, which he u
nrolled and read aloud.

\par Scrimgeour took from the ba
g an object that Harry had seen before: it looked something like a silver cigarette lighter but it had, he knew, the power to suck all light from a place, and restore it, with a simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Deluminator to Ron, wh
o took it and turned it over in his fingers, looking stunned.
\par \lquote That is a valuable object,\rquote  said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. \lquote It may even be unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore\rquote s own design. Why would he have left you an item so rare?\rquote 
\par Ron shook his head, looking bewildered.
\par \lquote Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students,\rquote  Scrimgeour persevered. \lquote Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? To what use did he think you would put his Deluminator, Mr Weasley?\rquote 
\par \lquote Put out lights, I s\rquote pose,\rquote  mumbled Ron. \lquote What else could I do with it?\rquote

from Scrimgeour without a word. She held the book in her lap and gazed at it. Harry saw that the title was in runes; he had never learned to read them. As he looked, a tear splashed on to the embossed symbols.
\par \lquote Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger?\rquote  asked Scrimgeour.
\par \lquote He ... he knew I liked books,\rquote  said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping her eyes with her sleeve.

\par \lquote Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?\rquote  asked Scrimgeour.
\par \lquote No idea,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote For the reasons you just read out, I suppose ... to remind me what you can get if you ... persevere and whatever it was.\rquote 
\par \lquote You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote I suppose so,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote What else could it be?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m asking the questions,\rquote  said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa. Dusk was really falling outside, now; the marquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the hedge.
\par \lquote I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch,\rquote  Scrimgeour said to Harry. \lquote Why is that?\rquote 
\par Hermione laughed derisively.
\par \lquote Oh, it can\rquote t be a reference to the fact Harry\rquote s a great Seeker, that\rquote s way too obvious,\rquote  she said. \lquote There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the icing!\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think there\rquote s anything hidden in the icing,\rquote  said Scrimgeour, \lquote but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object. You know why, I\rquote m sure?\rquote 
\par Harry shrugged. Hermione, however, answered: Harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge.
\par \lquote Because Snitches have flesh memories,\rquote  she said.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione\rquote s Quidditch knowledge negligible.
\par \lquote Correct,\rquote  said Scrimgeour. \lquote A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is rele
ased, not even by the maker, who wears gloves. It carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it, in case of a disputed capture. This Snitch,\rquote  he held up the tiny golden ball, \lquote 
will remember your touch, Potter. It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical skill, whatever his other faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s heart was beating rather fast. He was sure that Scrimgeour was right. How could he avoid taking the Snitch with his bare hand in front of the Minister?
\par \lquote You don\rquote t say anything,\rquote  said Scrimgeour. \lquote Perhaps you already know what the Snitch contains?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch the Snitch without really doing so. If only he knew Legilimency, really knew it, and could read Hermione\rquote s mind; he could practically hear her brain whirring beside him.

\par \lquote Take it,\rquote  said Scrimgeour quietly.
\par Harry met the Minister\rquote s yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey. He held out his hand and Scrimgeour leaned forwards again and placed the Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into Harry\rquote s palm.
\par Nothing happened. As Harry\rquote s fingers closed around the Snitch, its tired wings fluttered and were still. Scrimgeour, Ron and Hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball, as if still hoping it might transform in some way.

\par \lquote That was dramatic,\rquote  said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Hermione laughed.
\par \lquote That\rquote s all, then, is it?\rquote  asked Hermione, making to prise herself off the sofa.
\par \lquote Not quite,\rquote  said Scrimgeour, who looked bad-tempered now. \lquote Dumbledore left you a second bequest, Potter.\rquote 
\par \lquote What is it?\rquote  asked Harry, excitement rekindling.
\par Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time.
\par \lquote The sword of Godric Gryffindor,\rquote  he said.
\par Hermione and Ron both stiffened. Harry looked around for a sign of the ruby-encrusted hilt, but Scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather pouch which, in any case, looked much too small to contain it.
\par \lquote So where is it?\rquote  Harry asked suspiciously.
\par \lquote Unfortunately,\rquote  said Scrimgeour, \lquote that sword was not Dumbledore\rquote s to give away. The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical artefact, and as such, belongs \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It belongs to Harry!\rquote  said Hermione hotly. \lquote It chose him, he was the one who found it, it came to him out of the Sorting Hat \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor,\rquote  said Scrimgeour. \lquote That does not make it the exclusive property of Mr Potter, whatever Dumbledore may have decided.\rquote 
 Scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek, scrutinising Harry. \lquote Why do you think \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?\rquote  said Harry, struggling to keep his temper. \lquote Maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall.\rquote 
\par \lquote This is not a joke, Potter!\rquote  growled Scrimgeour. \lquote 
Was it because Dumbledore believed that only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin? Did he wish to give you that sword, Potter, because he believed, as do many, that you are the one destined to destroy He Who Must Not Be Named?
\rquote 
\par \lquote Interesting theory,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in Voldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some people on to that, instead of wasting their time stripping down Deluminators, or c
overing up breakouts from Azkaban. So is this what you\rquote 
ve been doing, Minister, shut up in your office, trying to break open a Snitch? People are dying, I was nearly one of them, Voldemort chased me across three counties, he killed Mad-Eye Moody, but there\rquote 
s been no word about any of that from the Ministry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!\rquote 
\par \lquote You go too far!\rquote  shouted Scrimgeour, standing up; Harry jumped to his feet too. Scrimgeour limped towards Harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his wand: it singed a hole in Harry\rquote s T-shirt like a lit cigarette.

\par \lquote Oi!\rquote  said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but Harry said, \lquote No! D\rquote you want to give him an excuse to arrest us?\rquote 
\par \lquote Remembered you\rquote re not at school, have you?\rquote  said Scrimgeour, breathing hard into Harry\rquote s face. \lquote 
Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence and insubordination? You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a seventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! It\rquote s time you learned some respect!\rquote 

\par \lquote It\rquote s time you earned it,\rquote  said Harry.
\par The floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then the door to the sitting room burst open and Mr and Mrs Weasley ran in.
\par \lquote We \endash  we thought we heard \endash \rquote  began Mr Weasley, looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of Harry and the Minister virtually nose to nose.
\par \lquote \endash  raised voices,\rquote  panted Mrs Weasley.
\par Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at the hole he had made in Harry\rquote s T-shirt. He seemed to regret his loss of temper.
\par \lquote It \endash  it was nothing,\rquote  he growled. \lquote I ... regret your attitude,\rquote  he said, looking Harry full in the face once more. \lquote You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire what you \endash  what Dumbledore \endash 
 desired. We ought to be working together.\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t like your methods, Minister,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Remember?\rquote 
\par For the second time, he raised his right fist, and displayed to Scrimgeour the scars that still showed white on the back of it, spelling }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 I must not tell lies. }{

ed. He turned away without another word and limped from the room. Mrs Weasley hurried after him; Harry heard her stop at the back door. After a minute or so, she called, \lquote He\rquote s gone!\rquote 
\par \lquote What did he want?\rquote  Mr Weasley asked, looking around at Harry, Ron and Hermione, as Mrs Weasley came hurrying back to them.
\par \lquote To give us what Dumbledore left us,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote They\rquote ve only just released the contents of his will.\rquote 
\par Outside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects Scrimgeour had given them were passed from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator and }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword, but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why Dumbledore would have left Harry an
 old Snitch. As Mr Weasley examined the Deluminator for the third or fourth time, Mrs Weasley said tentatively, \lquote Harry, dear, everyone\rquote s awfully hungry, we didn\rquote t like to start without you ... shall I serve dinner now?\rquote 
\par They all ate rather hurriedly and then, after a hasty chorus of \lquote Happy Birthday\rquote 
 and much gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding the following day, but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a tent for himself in a neighbouring field.
\par \lquote Meet us upstairs,\rquote  Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped Mrs Weasley restore the garden to its normal state. \lquote After everyone\rquote s gone to bed.\rquote 
\par Up in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator and Harry filled Hagrid\rquote s Mokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless though some of them were: the Marauder\rquote s Map, the shard of Sirius\rquote 
s enchanted mirror and R.A.B.\rquote s locket. He pulled the strings tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then sat holding the old Snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Muffliato,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the stairs.
\par \lquote Thought you didn\rquote t approve of that spell?\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Times change,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Now, show us that Deluminator.\rquote 
\par Ron obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it. The solitary lamp they had lit went out at once.
\par \lquote The thing is,\rquote  whispered Hermione through the dark, \lquote we could have achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.\rquote 
\par There was a small }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 click, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more.
\par \lquote Still, it\rquote s cool,\rquote  said Ron, a little defensively. \lquote And from what they said, Dumbledore invented it himself!\rquote 
\par \lquote I know, but surely he wouldn\rquote t have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights!\rquote 
\par \lquote D\rquote you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything he\rquote d left us?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Definitely,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote He couldn\rquote t tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things, but that still doesn\rquote t explain ...\rquote 
\par \lquote ... why he couldn\rquote t have given us a hint when he was alive?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote Well, exactly,\rquote  said Hermione, now flicking through }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 The Tales of Beedle the Bard. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Thought wrong, then, didn\rquote t he?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I always said he was mental. Brilliant, and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch \endash  what the hell was that about?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve no idea,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote When Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was so sure that something was going to happen!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, well,\rquote  said Harry, his pulse quickening as he raised the Snitch in his fingers. \lquote I wasn\rquote t going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour, was I?\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you mean?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Don\rquote t you remember?\rquote 
\par Hermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, pointing frantically from Harry to the Snitch and back again until he found his voice.
\par \lquote That was the one you nearly swallowed!\rquote 
\par \lquote Exactly,\rquote  said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the Snitch.
\par It did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him: he lowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out.
\par \lquote Writing! There\rquote s writing on it, quick, look!\rquote 
\par He nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement. Hermi
one was quite right. Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds before there had been nothing, were five words written in the thin slanting handwriting that Harry recognised as Dumbledore\rquote s:
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 I open at the close.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par He had barely read them when the words vanished again.

\par Hermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank.
\par \lquote I open at the close ... at the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 close }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 ... I open at the close ...\rquote 

\par But no matter how often they repeated the words, with many different inflections, they were unable to wring any more meaning from them.
\par \lquote And the sword,\rquote  said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divine meaning in the Snitch\rquote s inscription. \lquote Why did he want Harry to have the sword?\rquote 
\par \lquote And why couldn\rquote t he just have told me?\rquote  Harry said quietly. \lquote It was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 there, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par He felt as though he were sitting in an 
examination with a question he ought to have been able to answer in front of him, his brain slow and unresponsive. Was there something he had missed in the long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know what it all meant? Had Dumbledore expected h
im to understand?
\par \lquote And as for this book,\rquote  said Hermione, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote The Tales of Beedle the Bard ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote No, I\rquote m not!\rquote  said Hermione in surprise. \lquote Do you know them, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, of course I do!\rquote 
\par Harry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read a book that Hermione had not was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused by their surprise.

\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Ron uncertainly, \lquote I mean, that\rquote s just what you hear, you know, that all these old stories came from Beedle. I dunno what they\rquote re like in the original versions.\rquote 
\par \lquote But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?\rquote 
\par Something creaked downstairs.
\par \lquote Probably just Charlie, now Mum\rquote s asleep, sneaking off to regrow his hair,\rquote  said Ron nervously.

clock on the following afternoon found Harry, Ron, Fred and George standing outside the great, white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests. Harry had
 taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and was now the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local village, Ottery St Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a Summoning Charm. The plan was to introduce Harry as \lquote Cousin Barny\rquote 
 and trust to the great number of Weasley relatives to camouflage him.

All four of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could help show people to the right seats. A host of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour earlier, along with a golden-jacketed band, and 
all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree; Harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot.
\par Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set either side of a long, purple carpet. The supporting poles were entwined with white and gold flowers. Fred and George had fastened an enormous bunch of golden ba
l
loons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband and wife. Outside, butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was sli
ghtly fatter than him, and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summer\rquote s day.
\par \lquote When I get married,\rquote  said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes, \lquote I won\rquote t be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I\rquote ll put a full Body-Bind Curse on Mum until it\rquote 
s all over.\rquote 
\par \lquote She wasn\rquote t too bad this morning, considering,\rquote  said George. \lquote Cried a bit about Percy not being here, but who wants him? Oh blimey, brace yourselves \endash  here they come, look.\rquote 
\par Brightly coloured fig
ures were appearing, one by one, out of nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard. Within minutes a procession had formed, which began to snake its way up through the garden towards the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witche
s\rquote  hats, while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards\rquote  cravats; a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent.
\par \lquote Excellent, I think I see a few Veela cousins,\rquote  said George, craning his neck for a better look. \lquote They\rquote ll need help under\-standing our English customs, I\rquote ll look after them ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Not so fast, Lugless,\rquote  said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of middle-aged witches heading the procession he said, \lquote Here \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

s old Ministry colleague, Perkins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to Harry\rquote s lot.
\par \lquote Wotcher,\rquote  said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found Tonks and Lupin at the front of the queue. She had turned blonde for the occasion. \lquote 
Arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night,\rquote  she added in a whisper, as Harry led them up the aisle. \lquote The Ministry\rquote 
s being very anti-werewolf at the moment and we thought our presence might not do you any favours.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s fine, I understand,\rquote  said Harry, speaking more to Lupin than Tonks. Lupin gave him a swift smile, but as they turned away, Harry saw Lupin\rquote 
s face fall again into lines of misery. He did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter: Hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption. Having mis\-understood Fred\rquote s direc
tions, he had sat himself, not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row, but on five seats that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks.
\par While Mr Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted apologies to 
anybody who would listen, Harry hurried back to the entrance to find Ron face to face with a most eccentric-looking wizard. Slightly cross-eyed, with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candyfloss, he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his 
nose and robes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow. An odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened from a golden chain around his neck.
\par \lquote Xenophilius Lovegood,\rquote  he said, extending a hand to Harry, \lquote my daughter and I live just over the hill, so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us. But I think you know my Luna?\rquote  he added to Ron.

t yellow robes, which she had accessorised with a large sunflower in her hair. Once you got over the brightness of it all, the general effect was quite pleasant. At least there were no radishes dangling from her ears.
\par Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaint\-ance, had missed the exchange between Luna and Harry. Bidding the wizard farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her finger and said, \lquote Daddy, look \endash 
 one of the gnomes actually bit me!\rquote 
\par \lquote How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!\rquote  said Mr Lovegood, seizing Luna\rquote s outstretched finger and examining the bleeding puncture marks. \lquote Luna, my love, if you should feel any burgeoning talent today \endash 
 perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaim in Mermish \endash  do not repress it! You may have been gifted by the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Gernumblies!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par Ron, passing them in the opposite direction, let out a loud snort.
\par \lquote Ron can laugh,\rquote  said Luna serenely, as Harry led her and Xenophilius towards their seats, \lquote but my father has done a lot of research on }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Gernumbli

\par \lquote Really?\rquote  said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her father\rquote s peculiar views. \lquote Are you sure you don\rquote t want to put anything on that bite, though?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, it\rquote s fine,\rquote  said Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking Harry up and down. \lquote 
You look smart. I told Daddy most people would probably wear dress robes, but he believes you ought to wear sun colours to a wedding, for luck, you know.\rquote 
\par As she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching his arm. Her beaky nose, red-rimmed eyes, and feathery pink hat gave her the look of a bad-tempered flamingo.
\par \lquote ... and your hair\rquote s much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you were Ginevra. Merlin\rquote s beard, what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He looks like an omelette. And who are you?\rquote  she barked at Harry.
\par \lquote Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our Cousin Barny.\rquote 
\par \lquote Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn\rquote t Harry Potter here? I was hoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?\rquote 
\par \lquote No \endash  he couldn\rquote t come \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in press photographs, then. I\rquote ve just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara,\rquote  she shouted at Harry. \lquote 
Goblin-made, you know, and been in my family for centuries. She\rquote s a good-looking girl, but still \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 French. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long.\rquote 
\par Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time: when next they met at the entrance Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places. The marquee was nearly full now, and for the first time there was no queue outside.

\par \lquote Nightmare, Muriel is,\rquote  said Ron, mopping his forehead on his sleeve. \lquote She used to come for Christmas every year, then, thank God, she took offence because Fred and George set off a Dungbomb under her chair at dinner. Dad al
ways says she\rquote ll have written them out of her will \endash  like they care, they\rquote re going to end up richer than anyone in the family, rate they\rquote re going ... wow,\rquote 
 he added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying towards them. \lquote You look great!\rquote 
\par \lquote Always the tone of surprise,\rquote  said Hermione, though she smiled. She was wearing a floaty, lilac-coloured dress with matching high heels; her hair was sleek and shiny. \lquote Your Great Aunt Muriel doesn\rquote 
t agree, I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara. She said \'93Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?\'94 and then \'93bad posture and skinny ankles\'94.\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t take it personally, she\rquote s rude to everyone,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Talking about Muriel?\rquote  enquired George, re-emerging from the marquee with Fred. \lquote Yeah, she\rquote s just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; he was a right laugh at weddings.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Wasn\rquote t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours later?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote Well, yeah, he went a bit odd towards the end,\rquote  conceded George.
\par \lquote But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote He used to down an entire bottle of Firewhisky, then run on to the dance floor, hoist up his robes and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, he sounds a real charmer,\rquote  said Hermione, while Harry roared with laughter.
\par \lquote Never married, for some reason,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote You amaze me,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par They were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer, a dark-haired young man with a large, curved nose and thick, black eyebrows, until he held out his invitation to Ron and said, with his eyes on Hermione, \lquote You look vunderful.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Viktor!\rquote  she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag, which made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size. As she scrambled, blushing, to pick it up, she said, \lquote I didn\rquote t know you were \endash  goodness \endash  it
\rquote s lovely to see \endash  how are you?\rquote 
\par Ron\rquote s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krum\rquote s invitation as if he did not believe a word of it, he said, much too loudly, \lquote How come you\rquote re here?\rquote 
\par \lquote Fleur invited me,\rquote  said Krum, eyebrows raised.
\par Harry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then, feeling that it would be prudent to remove Krum from Ron\rquote s vicinity, offered to show him his seat.
\par \lquote Your friend is not pleased to see me,\rquote  said Krum, as they entered the now packed marquee. \lquote Or is he a relative?\rquote  he added, with a glance at Harry\rquote s red, curly hair.
\par \lquote Cousin,\rquote  Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening. His appearance was causing a stir, particular
ly amongst the Veela cousins: he was, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Hermione, Fred and George came hurrying down the aisle.
\par \lquote Time to sit down,\rquote  Fred told Harry, \lquote or we\rquote re going to get run over by the bride.\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione took their seats in the second row behind Fred and George. Hermione looked rather pink and Ron\rquote s ears were still scarlet. After a few moments, he muttered to Harry, \lquote Did you see he\rquote s grown a stupi
d little beard?\rquote 
\par Harry gave a non-committal grunt.
\par A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr and Mrs Weasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and waving at relatives; M
rs Weasley was wearing a brand new set of amethyst-coloured robes with a matching hat.
\par A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee, both wearing dress robes, with large, white roses in their buttonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and there was an out\-
break of giggling from the Veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled, from what seemed to be the golden balloons.
\par \lquote Ooooh!\rquote  said Hermione, swivelling round in her seat to look at the entrance.
\par A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as Monsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Monsieur Delacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a 
strong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it beautified every\-
body it fell upon. Ginny and Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier than usual, and once Fleur had reached him, Bill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrir Greyback.
\par \lquote Ladies and gentlemen,\rquote  said a slightly sing-song voice, and with a slight shock Harry saw the same small, tufty-haired wizard who had presided at Dumbledore\rquote s funeral, now standing in front of Bill and Fleur. \lquote 
We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, my tiara sets off the whole thing nicely,\rquote  said Auntie Muriel in a rather carrying whisper. \lquote But I must say, Ginevra\rquote s dress is far too low-cut.\rquote 
\par Ginny glanced round, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again. Harry\rquote 
s mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; they had always seemed too good to be 
true, as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal person\rquote s life, a person without a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead ...
\par \lquote Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle ...?\rquote 
\par In the front row, Mrs Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobb
ing quietly into scraps of lace. Trumpet-like sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out one of his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned and beamed at Harry; her eyes, too, were full of tears.
\par \lquote ... then I declare you bonded for life.\rquote 
\par The tufty-haired wizard raised his wand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiral\-ling around their now entwined figures. As Fred and George led a round of applause, the golden ball
oons overhead burst: birds of paradise and tiny, golden bells flew and floated out of them, adding their songs and chimes to the din.
\par \lquote Ladies and gentlemen!\rquote  called the tufty-haired wizard. \lquote If you would please stand up!\rquote 
\par They all did so, Auntie Muriel gru
mbling audibly; he waved his wand. The seats on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished, so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a glorious view of the sunlit orchard
 and surrounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the centre of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering chairs grouped them\-selves around small, white-clothed tables, which all floated grace\-
fully back to earth around it, and the golden-jacketed band trooped towards a podium.
\par \lquote Smooth,\rquote  said Ron approvingly, as the waiters popped up on all sides, some bearing silver trays of pumpkin juice, Butterbeer and Firewhisky, others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches.
\par \lquote We should go and congratulate them!\rquote  said Hermione, stand\-ing on tiptoe to see the place where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well-wishers.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll have time later,\rquote  shrugged Ron, snatching three Butterbeers from a passing tray and handing one to Harry. \lquote Hermione, cop hold, let\rquote s grab a table ... not there! Nowhere near Muriel \endash \rquote 
\par Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and right as he went: Harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they had reached the other side of the mar\-
quee, most of the tables were occupied: the emptiest was the one where Luna sat alone.
\par \lquote All right if we join you?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote Oh yes,\rquote  she said happily. \lquote Daddy\rquote s just gone to give Bill and Fleur our present.\rquote 
\par \lquote What is it, a lifetime\rquote s supply of Gurdyroots?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry instead. Eyes watering in pain, Harry lost track of the con\-versation for a few moments.
\par The band had begun to play. Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great applause; after a while, Mr Weasley led Madame Delacour on to the floor, followed by Mrs Weasley and Fleur\rquote s father.
\par \lquote I like this song,\rquote  said Luna, swaying in time to the waltz-like tune, and a few seconds later she stood up and glided on to the dance floor, where she revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed and waving her arms.
\par \lquote She\rquote s great, isn\rquote t she?\rquote  said Ron admiringly. \lquote Always good value.\rquote 
\par But the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had dropped into Luna\rquote s vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably flustered, but this time Krum had not come to compliment her. With a scowl on his face he said, \lquote 
Who is that man in the yellow?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s Xenophilius Lovegood, he\rquote s the father of a friend of ours,\rquote  said Ron. His pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation. \lquote Come and dance,\rquote 
 he added abruptly to Hermione.
\par She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up: they vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor.
\par \lquote Ah, they are together now?\rquote  asked Krum, momentarily distracted.
\par \lquote Er \endash  sort of,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Who are you?\rquote  Krum asked.
\par \lquote Barny Weasley.\rquote 
\par They shook hands.
\par \lquote You, Barny \endash  you know this man Lovegood vell?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I only met him today. Why?\rquote 
\par Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophil\-ius, who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor.
\par \lquote Because,\rquote  said Krum, \lquote if he vos not a guest of Fleur\rquote s, I vould duel him, here and now, for vearing that filthy sign upon his chest.\rquote 
\par \lquote Sign?\rquote  said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. The strange, triangular eye was gleaming on his chest. \lquote Why? What\rquote s wrong with it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Grindelvald. That is Grindelvald\rquote s sign.\rquote 
\par \lquote Grindelwald ... the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?\rquote 
\par \lquote Exactly.\rquote 
\par Krum\rquote s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he said, \lquote Grindelvald killed many people, my grandfather, for instance. Of course, he vos never poverful in this country, they said he feared Dumbledore \endash 
 and rightly, seeing how he vos finished. But this \endash \rquote  He pointed a finger at Xenophilius. \lquote This is his symbol, I recog\-
nised it at vunce: Grindelvald carved it into a vall at Durmstrang ven he vos a pupil there. Some idiots copied it on to their books and clothes, thinking to shock, make themselves impressive \endash 
 until those of us who had lost family members to Grindelvald taught them better.\rquote 
\par Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius. Harry felt perplexed. It seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna\rquote s father was a supporter of t
he Dark Arts, and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognised the triangular, rune-like shape.
\par \lquote Are you \endash  er \endash  quite sure it\rquote s Grindelwald\rquote s \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote I am not mistaken,\rquote  said Krum coldly. \lquote I valked past that sign for several years, I know it vell.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, there\rquote s a chance,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote that Xenophilius doesn\rquote t actually know what the symbol means. The Lovegoods are quite ... unusual. He could easily have picked it up somewhere and think it\rquote 
s a cross-section of the head of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or something.\rquote 
\par \lquote The cross-section of a vot?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I don\rquote t know what they are, but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for them \'85\rquote 
\par Harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her father.
\par \lquote That\rquote s her,\rquote  he said, pointing at Luna, who was still dancing alone, waving her arms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges.
\par \lquote Vy is she doing that?\rquote  asked Krum.
\par \lquote Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt,\rquote  said Harry, who recognised the symptoms.
\par Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him. He drew his wand from inside his robes and tapped it menacingly on his thigh; sparks flew out of the end.
\par \lquote Gregorovitch!\rquote  said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry was too excited to care: the memory had come back to him at the sight of Krum\rquote s wand: Ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before the Triwizard Tournament.

\par \lquote Vot about him?\rquote  asked Krum suspiciously.
\par \lquote He\rquote s a wandmaker!\rquote 
\par \lquote I know that,\rquote  said Krum.
\par \lquote He made your wand! That\rquote s why I thought \endash  Quidditch \'85\rquote 
\par Krum was looking more and more suspicious.
\par \lquote How do you know Gregorovitch made my vand?\rquote 
\par \lquote I ... I read it somewhere, I think,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote In a \endash  a fan magazine,\rquote  he improvised wildly and Krum looked mollified.
\par \lquote I had not realised I ever discussed my vand vith fans,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote So ... er ... where is Gregorovitch these days?\rquote 
\par Krum looked puzzled.
\par \lquote He retired several years ago. I vos one of the last to purchase a Gregorovitch vand. They are the best \endash  although I know, of course, that you Britons set much store by Ollivander.\rquote 
\par Harry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like Krum, but he was thinking hard. So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker, and Harry did not have to search far for a reason: it was surely because of what Harry\rquote 
s wand had done on the night that Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. The holly and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand, something that Ollivander had not anticipated or under\-stood. Would Gr
egorovitch know better? Was he truly more skilled than Ollivander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not?
\par \lquote This girl is very nice-looking,\rquote  Krum said, recalling Harry to his surroundings. Krum was pointing at Ginny, who had just joined Luna. \lquote She is also a relative of yours?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, suddenly irritated, \lquote and she\rquote s seeing some\-one. Jealous type. Big bloke. You wouldn\rquote t want to cross him.\rquote 
\par Krum grunted.
\par \lquote Vot,\rquote  he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, \lquote is the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken?\rquote 
\par And he strode off, leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way round the edge of the crowded dance floor. He wanted to find Ron, to tell him about Gregoro\-
vitch, but Ron was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor. Harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched Ginny, who was now dancing with Fred and George\rquote s friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the 
promise he had given Ron.
\par He had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge how wizarding celebrations differed from Muggle ones, though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that too
k flight when the cake was cut, or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd. As evening drew in and moths began to swoop under the canopy, now lit with floating golden lanterns, the rev\-
elry became more and more uncontained. Fred and George had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of Fleur\rquote s cousins; Charlie, Hagrid and a squat wizard in a purple pork-pie hat were singing \lquote Odo the Hero\rquote  in a corner.

\par Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron\rquote s w
ho seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table. His cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock, and was topped by a moth-eaten fez. He was vaguely familiar: racking his br
ains Harry suddenly realised that this was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the Phoenix, and the writer of Dumbledore\rquote s obituary.
\par Harry approached him.
\par \lquote May I sit down?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course, of course,\rquote  said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched, wheezy voice.
\par Harry leaned in.
\par \lquote Mr Doge, I\rquote m Harry Potter.\rquote 
\par Doge gasped.
\par \lquote My dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised ... I am so glad, so honoured!\rquote 
\par In a flutter of nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of champagne.
\par \lquote I thought of writing to you,\rquote  he whispered, \lquote after Dumbledore ... the shock ... and for you, I am sure ...\rquote 
\par Doge\rquote s tiny eyes filled with sudden tears.
\par \lquote I saw the obituary you wrote for the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Daily Prophet,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 said Harry. 
\lquote I didn\rquote t realise you knew Professor Dumbledore so well.\rquote 
\par \lquote As well as anyone,\rquote  said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin. \lquote Certainly I knew him longest, if you don\rquote t count Aberforth \endash  and somehow, people never }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 do }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 seem to count Aberforth.\rquote

t know whether you saw, Mr Doge \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.\rquote 
\par \lquote Elphias, I don\rquote t know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave about Dumbledore?\rquote 
\par Doge\rquote s face flooded with angry colour.
\par \lquote 
Oh, yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might be a more accurate term, positively pestered me to talk to her. I am ashamed to say that I became rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which resulted, as you may have seen, in aspersions cast
 upon my sanity.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, in that interview,\rquote  Harry went on, \lquote Rita Skeeter hinted that Professor Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when he was young.\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t believe a word of it!\rquote  said Doge at once. \lquote Not a word, Harry! Let nothing tarnish your memories of Albus Dumbledore!\rquote 
\par Harry looked into Doge\rquote s earnest, pained face and felt not reassured, but frustrated. Did Doge really think it was that easy, that Harry could simply }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 choose }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 not to believe? Didn\rquote t Doge under\-stand Harry\rquote s need to be sure, to know }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 everything?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par Perhaps Doge suspected Harry\rquote s feelings, for he looked con\-cerned and hurried on, \lquote Harry, Rita Skeeter is a dreadful \endash \rquote 
\par But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle.
\par \lquote Rita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her!\rquote 
\par Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there, the plumes dancing on her hat, a goblet of champagne in her hand. \lquote She\rquote s written a book about Dumbledore, you know!\rquote 
\par \lquote Hello, Muriel,\rquote  said Doge. \lquote Yes, we were just discussing \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You there! Give me your chair, I\rquote m a hundred and seven!\rquote 
\par Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat, looking alarmed, and Auntie Muriel swung it round with sur\-prising strength and plopped herself down upon it between Doge and Harry.
\par \lquote Hello again, Barry, or whatever your name is,\rquote  she said to Harry. \lquote Now, what were you saying about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know she\rquote s written a biography of Dumbledore? I can\rquote 
t wait to read it, I must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts!\rquote 
\par Doge looked stiff and solemn at this, but Auntie Muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement. She took another large gulp of champagne, belched and then said, \lquote There\rquote 
s no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs! Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh, there were some mighty funny rumours about Albus!\rquote 
\par \lquote Ill-informed sniping,\rquote  said Doge, turning radish-coloured again.
\par \lquote You would say that, Elphias,\rquote  cackled Auntie Muriel. \lquote I noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry you think so,\rquote  said Doge, more coldly still. \lquote I assure you I was writing from the heart.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you\rquote ll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib sister!\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Muriel!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 exclaimed Doge.
\par A chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through Harry\rquote s chest.
\par \lquote What do you mean?\rquote  he asked Muriel. \lquote Who said his sister was a Squib? I thought she was ill?\rquote 
\par \lquote Thought wrong, then, didn\rquote t you, Barry!\rquote  said Auntie Muriel, looking delighted at the effect she had produced. \lquote 
Anyway, how could you expect to know anything about it? It all happened years and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened. That\rquote s why I can\rquote 
t wait to find out what Skeeter\rquote s un\-earthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time!\rquote 
\par \lquote Untrue!\rquote  wheezed Doge. \lquote Absolutely untrue!\rquote 
\par \lquote He never told me his sister was a Squib,\rquote  said Harry, without thinking, still cold inside.
\par \lquote And why on earth would he tell you?\rquote  screeched Muriel, sway\-ing a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon Harry.
\par \lquote The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,\rquote  began Elphias, in a voice stiff with emotion, \lquote is, I should have thought, quite clear. He was so devastated by her death \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Why did nobody ever see her, Elphias?\rquote  squawked Muriel. \lquote Why did half of us never even know she existed, until they car\-ried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her?
 Where was saintly Albus, while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off being brilliant at Hogwarts, and never mind what was going on in his own house!\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean \'93locked in the cellar\'94?\rquote  asked Harry. \lquote What is this?\rquote 
\par Doge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again and answered Harry.
\par \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrify\-ing. Muggle-born, though I heard she pretended otherwise \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman,\rquote  whispered Doge miserably, but Auntie Muriel ignored him.
\par \lquote \endash  proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a Squib \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ariana was not a Squib!\rquote  wheezed Doge.
\par \lquote So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended Hogwarts!\rquote  said Auntie Muriel. She turned back to Harry. \lquote 
In our day Squibs were often hushed up. Though to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didn\rquote t exist \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I tell you, that\rquote s not what happened!\rquote  said Doge, but Auntie Muriel steamrollered on, still addressing Harry.
\par \lquote Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the Muggle community ... much kinder than trying to find them a place in the wizarding world, where
 they must always be second class; but naturally Kendra Dumbledore wouldn\rquote t have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a Muggle school \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ariana was delicate!\rquote  said Doge desperately. \lquote Her health was always too poor to permit her \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote To permit her to leave the house?\rquote  cackled Muriel. \lquote And yet she was never taken to St Mungo\rquote s and no healer was ever summoned to see her!\rquote 
\par \lquote Really, Muriel, how you can possibly know whether \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a healer at St Mungo\rquote s at the time, and he told my family in strictest confidence that Ariana had never been seen there. All most suspicious, Lancelot thought!\rquote 
\par Doge looked to be on the verge of tears. Auntie Muriel, who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely, snapped her fingers for mor
e champagne. Numbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had once shut him up, locked him away, kept him out of sight, all for the crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore\rquote 
s sister suffered the same fate in reverse: imprisoned for her lack of magic? And had Dumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went off to Hogwarts, to prove himself brilliant and talented?
\par \lquote Now, if Kendra hadn\rquote t died first,\rquote  Muriel resumed, \lquote I\rquote d have said that it was she who finished off Ariana \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote How can you, Muriel?\rquote  groaned Doge. \lquote A mother kill her own daughter? Think what you are saying!\rquote 
\par \lquote If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end, why not?\rquote  shrugged Auntie Muriel. \lquote But as I say, it doesn\rquote t fit, because Kendra died before Ariana \endash  of what, nobody ever seemed sure 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, no doubt Ariana murdered her,\rquote  said Doge, with a brave attempt at scorn. \lquote Why not?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed Kendra in the struggle,\rquote  said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully. \lquote Shake your head all you like, Elphias! You were at Ariana\rquote s funeral, were you not?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I was,\rquote  said Doge, through trembling lips. And a more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember. Albus was heart\-broken \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote His heart wasn\rquote t the only thing. Didn\rquote t Aberforth break Albus\rquote s nose halfway through the service?\rquote 
\par If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he looked now. Muriel might have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne, which dribbled down her chin.
\par \lquote How do you \endash ?\rquote  croaked Doge.
\par \lquote My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,\rquote  said Auntie Muriel happily. \lquote 
Bathilda described the whole thing to Mother while I was listening at the door. A coffin-side brawl! The way Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus\rquote s fault that Ariana was dead and then punched him in the face. Accord\-
ing to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend himself, and that\rquote s odd enough in itself, Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back.\rquote 
\par Muriel swi
gged yet more champagne. The recitation of these old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified Doge. Harry did not know what to think, what to believe: he wanted the truth, and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had b
een ill. Harry could hardly believe that Dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story.
\par \lquote And I\rquote ll tell you something else,\rquote  Muriel said, hiccoughing slightly as she lowered her goblet. \lquote I think Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter. All those hints in Skeeter\rquote 
s interview about an important source close to the Dumbledores \endash  goodness knows she was there all through the Ariana business and it would fit!\rquote 
\par \lquote Bathilda would never talk to Rita Skeeter!\rquote  whispered Doge.
\par \lquote Bathilda Bagshot?\rquote  Harry said. \lquote The author of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 A History of Magic?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par The name was printed on the front of one of Harry\rquote s textbooks, though admittedly not one of the ones he had read most attentively.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Doge, clutching at Harry\rquote s question like a drowning man at a lifebelt. \lquote A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus\rquote s.\rquote 
\par \lquote Quite gaga these days, I\rquote ve heard,\rquote  said Auntie Muriel cheerfully.
\par \lquote If that is so, it is even more dishonourable for Skeeter to have taken advantage of her,\rquote  said Doge, \lquote and no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I\rquote m sure Rita Skeeter knows them all,\rquote  said Auntie Muriel. \lquote But even if Bathilda\rquote s completely cuckoo, I\rquote m sure she\rquote 
d still have old photographs, maybe even letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years ... well worth a trip to Godric\rquote s Hollow, I\rquote d have thought.\rquote 
\par Harry, who had been taking a sip of Butterbeer, choked. Doge banged him on the back as Harry coughed, looking at Auntie Muriel through streaming eyes. Once he had control of his voice again, he asked, \lquote Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric\rquote 
s Hollow?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yes, she\rquote s been there forever! The Dumbledores moved there after Percival was imprisoned, and she was their neighbour.\rquote 
\par \lquote The Dumbledores lived in Godric\rquote s Hollow?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Barry, that\rquote s what I just said,\rquote  said Auntie Muriel testily.
\par Harry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, had Dumbledore told Harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones in Godric\rquote s Hollow. Why? Were Lily and James buried close to Dumbledore\rquote 
s mother and sister? Had Dumbledore visited their graves, perhaps walked past Lily and James\rquote s to do so? And he had never once told Harry ... never bothered to say ...
\par And why it was so important, Harry could not explain, even to himself, yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place, and these experiences, in common. He stared ahead of 
him, barely noticing what was going on around him, and did not realise that Hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him.
\par \lquote I simply can\rquote t dance any more,\rquote  she panted, slipping off one of her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot. \lquote Ron\rquote s gone looking to find more Butterbeers. It\rquote s a bit odd, I\rquote 
ve just seen Viktor storming away from Luna\rquote s father, it looked like they\rquote d been arguing \endash \rquote  She dropped her voice, staring at him. \lquote Harry, are you OK?\rquote 
\par Harry did not know where to begin,
 but it did not matter. At that moment, something large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor. Graceful and gleaming, the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers. Heads turned, as those nearest it froze, absur
dly, in mid-dance. Then the Patronus\rquote s mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep, slow voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt.

 Harry and Hermione jumped to their feet and drew their wands. Many people were only just real\-ising that something strange had happened; heads were still turn\-

Harry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd. Guests were sprinting in all directions; many were Dis\-apparating; the protective enchantments around The Burrow had broken.
\par \lquote Ron!\rquote  Hermione cried. \lquote Ron, where are you?\rquote 
\par As they pushed their way across the dance floor, Harry saw cloaked and masked figures appearing in the crowd; then he saw Lupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and heard both of them shout }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Protego!\rquote , }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 a cry that was echoed on all sides \endash 
\par \lquote Ron! Ron!\rquote  Hermione called, half sobbing as she and Harry were buffeted by terrified guests: Harry seized her hand to make sure they weren\rquote 
t separated as a streak of light whizzed over their heads, whether a protective charm or something more sinister he did not know \endash 
\par And then Ron was there. He caught hold of Hermione\rquote s free arm and Harry felt her turn on the spot; sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him; all he could feel was Hermione\rquote s hand as he was squeeze
d through space and time, away from The Burrow, away from the descending Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from Voldemort himself ...
\par \lquote Where are we?\rquote  said Ron\rquote s voice.
\par Harry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they had not left the wedding after all: they still seemed to be surrounded by people.
\par \lquote Tottenham Court Road,\rquote  panted Hermione. \lquote Walk, just walk, we need to find somewhere for you to change.\rquote 
\par Harry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up the wide, dark street thronged with late-night revellers
 and lined with closed shops, stars twinkling above them. A double-decker bus rumbled by and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed; Harry and Ron were still wearing dress robes.
\par \lquote Hermione, we haven\rquote t got anything to change into,\rquote  Ron told her, as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him.
\par \lquote Why didn\rquote t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?\rquote  said Harry, inwardly cursing his own stupidity. \lquote All last year I kept it on me and \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s OK, I\rquote ve got the Cloak, I\rquote ve got clothes for both of you,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Just try and act naturally until \endash  this will do.\rquote 
\par She led them down a side street, then into the shelter of a shadowy alleyway.
\par \lquote When you say you\rquote ve got the Cloak, and clothes ...\rquote  said Harry, frowning at Hermione, who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which she was now rummaging.
\par \lquote Yes, they\rquote re here,\rquote  said Hermione, and to Harry and Ron\rquote s utter astonishment, she pulled out a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks and, finally, the silvery Invisibility Cloak.
\par \lquote How the ruddy hell \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Undetectable Extension Charm,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Tricky, but I think I\rquote ve done it OK; anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here.\rquote  She gave the fragile-looking bag a little shake and it echoed like a 
cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it. \lquote Oh, damn, that\rquote ll be the books,\rquote  she said, peering into it, \lquote and I had them all stacked by subject ... oh well ... Harry, you\rquote 
d better take the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry up and change ...\rquote 
\par \lquote When did you do all this?\rquote  Harry asked, as Ron stripped off his robes.
\par \lquote I told you at The Burrow, I\rquote ve had the essentials packed for days, you know, in case we needed to make a quick getaway. I packed your rucksack this morning, Harry, after you changed, and put it in here ... I just had a feeling \'85\rquote 

\par \lquote You\rquote re amazing, you are,\rquote  said Ron, handing her his bundled-up robes.
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote  said Hermione, managing a small smile as she pushed the robes into the bag. \lquote Please, Harry, get that Cloak on!\rquote 
\par Harry threw the Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his head, vanishing from sight. He was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened.
\par \lquote The others \endash  everyone at the wedding \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We can\rquote t worry about that now,\rquote  whispered Hermione. \lquote It\rquote s you they\rquote re after, Harry, and we\rquote ll just put everyone in even more danger by going back.\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s right,\rquote  said Ron, who seemed to know that Harry was about to argue, even if he could not see his face. \lquote Most of the Order was there, they\rquote ll look after everyone.\rquote 
\par Harry nodded, then remembered that they could not see him, and said, \lquote Yeah.\rquote  But he thought of Ginny and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach.
\par \lquote Come on, I think we ought to keep moving,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par They moved back up the side street and on to the main road again, where a group of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement.
\par \lquote Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?\rquote  Ron asked Hermione.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I\rquote m sure we\rquote re safer out in the Muggle world, it\rquote s not where they\rquote ll expect us to be.\rquote 
\par \lquote True,\rquote  said Ron, looking around, \lquote but don\rquote t you feel a bit \endash  exposed?\rquote 
\par \lquote Where else is there?\rquote  asked Hermione, cringing as the men on the other side of the road started wolf-whistling at her. \lquote 
We can hardly book rooms at the Leaky Cauldron, can we? And Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there ... I suppose we could try my parents\rquote  house, though I think there\rquote s a chance they might check there ... oh, I wish they\rquote 
d shut up!\rquote 
\par \lquote All right, darling?\rquote  the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling. \lquote Fancy a drink? Ditch ginger and come and have a pint!\rquote 
\par \lquote Let\rquote s sit down somewhere,\rquote  Hermione said hastily, as Ron opened his mouth to shout back across the road. \lquote Look, this will do, in here!\rquote 
\par It was a small and shabby all-night caf\'e9. A light layer of grease lay on all the formica-topped tables, but it was at least empty. Harry slipped into a booth first and Ron sat next to him opposite Hermione, who had her back to the entrance 
and did not like it: she glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch. Harry did not like being stationary; walking had given the illusion that they had a goal. Beneath the Cloak he could feel the last vestiges of the Polyjuice Po
tion leaving him, his hands returning to their usual length and shape. He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again.
\par After a minute or two, Ron said, \lquote You know, we\rquote re not far from the Leaky Cauldron here, it\rquote s only in Charing Cross \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ron, we can\rquote t!\rquote  said Hermione at once.
\par \lquote Not to stay there, but to find out what\rquote s going on!\rquote 
\par \lquote We know what\rquote s going on! Voldemort\rquote s taken over the Ministry, what else do we need to know?\rquote 
\par \lquote OK, OK, it was just an idea!\rquote 
\par They relapsed into a prickly silence. The gum-chewing waitress shuffled over and Hermione ordered two cappuccinos: as Harry was invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one. A pair of burly workmen entered the caf\'e9
 and squeezed into the next booth. Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper.
\par \lquote I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the countryside. Once we\rquote re there, we could send a message to the Order.\rquote 
\par \lquote Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve been practising and I think so,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Well, as long as it doesn\rquote t get them into trouble, though they might\rquote ve been arrested already. God, that\rquote s revolting,\rquote 
 Ron added, after one sip of the foamy, greyish coffee. The waitress had heard; she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers\rquote 
 orders. The larger of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that Harry came to look at him, waved her away. She stared, affronted.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s get going, then, I don\rquote t want to drink this muck,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Hermione, have you got Muggle money to pay for this?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I took out all my building society savings before I came to The Burrow. I\rquote ll bet all the change is at the bottom,\rquote  sighed Hermione, reaching for her beaded bag.
\par The two workmen made identical movements and Harry mir\-rored them without 
conscious thought: all three of them drew their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in realising what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways on to her bench. The force of the Death Eaters\rquote 
 spells shattered the tiled wall where Ron\rquote s head had just been, as Harry, still invisible, yelled, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Stupefy!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par The great, blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: he slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another at Ron: shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot 
\endash  the waitress screamed and ran for the door \endash  Harry sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window and hit 
the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door.

screamed Hermione from out of sight, and the Death Eater fell forwards like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china, table and coffee. Hermione crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of gla
ss ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over.

\par The severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his arms to regain feeling in them. Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large, blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench.
\par \lquote I should\rquote ve recognised him, he was there the night Dumbledore died,\rquote  he said. He turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot; the man\rquote s eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron and Hermione.
\par \lquote That\rquote s Dolohov,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I recognise him from the old wanted posters. I think the big one\rquote s Thorfinn Rowle.\rquote 
\par \lquote Never mind what they\rquote re called!\rquote  said Hermione a little hyster\-ically. \lquote How did they find us? What are we going to do?\rquote 
\par Somehow her panic seemed to clear Harry\rquote s head.
\par \lquote Lock the door,\rquote  he told her, \lquote and Ron, turn out the lights.\rquote 
\par He looked down at the paralysed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and Ron used the Deluminator to plunge the caf\'e9 into darkness. Harry could hear the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance.
\par \lquote What are we going to do with them?\rquote  Ron whispered to Harry through the dark; then, even more quietly, \lquote Kill them? They\rquote d kill us. They had a good go just now.\rquote 
\par Hermione shuddered and took a step backwards. Harry shook his head.
\par \lquote We just need to wipe their memories,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote It\rquote s better like that, it\rquote ll throw them off the scent. If we killed them, it\rquote d be obvious we were here.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re the boss,\rquote  said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. \lquote But I\rquote ve never done a Memory Charm.\rquote 
\par \lquote Nor have I,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote but I know the theory.\rquote 
\par She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolohov\rquote s forehead and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Obliviate.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par At once, Dolohov\rquote s eyes became unfocused and dreamy.
\par \lquote Brilliant!\rquote  said Harry, clapping her on the back. \lquote Take care of the other one and the waitress while Ron and I clear up.\rquote 
\par \lquote Clear up?\rquote  said Ron, looking around at the partly destroyed caf\'e9. \lquote Why?\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you think they might wonder what\rquote s happened if they wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like it\rquote s just been bombed?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh right, yeah ...\rquote

\par \lquote It\rquote s no wonder I can\rquote t get it out, Hermione, you packed my old jeans, they\rquote re tight.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, I\rquote m so sorry,\rquote  hissed Hermione, and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows Harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where Ron could stick his wand instead.
\par Once the caf\'e9 was restored to its previous condition, they heaved the Death Eaters back into their booth and propped them up facing each other.
\par \lquote But how did they find us?\rquote  Hermione asked, looking from one inert man to the other. \lquote How did they know where we were?\rquote 
\par She turned to Harry.
\par \lquote You \endash  you don\rquote t think you\rquote ve still got your Trace on you, do you, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote He can\rquote t have,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote The Trace breaks at seventeen, that\rquote s wizarding law, you can\rquote t put it on an adult.\rquote 
\par \lquote As far as you know,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote What if the Death Eaters have found a way to put it on a seventeen-year-old?\rquote 
\par \lquote But Harry hasn\rquote t been near a Death Eater in the last twenty-four hours. Who\rquote s supposed to have put a Trace back on him?\rquote 
\par Hermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted: was that really how the Death Eaters had found them?
\par \lquote If I can\rquote t use magic, and you can\rquote t use magic near me, without us giving away our position ...\rquote  he began.
\par \lquote We\rquote re not splitting up!\rquote  said Hermione firmly.
\par \lquote We need a safe place to hide,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Give us time to think things through.\rquote 
\par \lquote Grimmauld Place,\rquote  said Harry.
\par The other two gaped.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there!\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron\rquote s dad said they\rquote ve put up jinxes against him \endash  and even if they haven\rquote t worked,\rquote  he pressed on, as Hermione began to argue, \lquote so what? I swear, I\rquote d like nothing better than to meet Snape!\rquote 

\par \lquote But \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hermione, where else is there? It\rquote s the best chance we\rquote ve got. Snape\rquote s only one Death Eater. If I\rquote ve still got the Trace on me, we\rquote ll have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go.\rquote 
\par She could not argue, though she looked as if she would have liked to. While she unlocked the caf\'e9 door, Ron clicked the Deluminator to release the caf\'e9\rquote s light. Then, on Harry\rquote 
s count of three, they reversed the spells upon their three victims and before the waitress or either of the Death Eaters could do more than stir sleepily, Harry, Ron and Hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into th
e compressing darkness once more.
\par Seconds later Harry\rquote s lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes: they were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square. Tall, dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side. Number twelv
e was visible to them, for they had been told of its existence by Dumbledore, its Secret Keeper, and they rushed towards it, checking every few yards that they were not being followed or observed. They raced up the stone steps and Harry tapped the front d
oor once, with his wand. They heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold.
\par As Harry closed the door behind them, the old-fashioned gas lamps sprang into life, casting flickering light along the length of the hallway. It looked just as Harry remembered it: eerie, cobwebbed, the outlines of the house-elf heads on the wall throw\-
ing odd shadows up the staircase. Long, dark curtains concealed the portrait of Sirius\rquote s mother. The only thing that was out of place was the troll\rquote s leg umbrella stand, which was lying on its side as if Tonks had just knocked it over again.

\par \lquote I think somebody\rquote s been in here,\rquote  Hermione whispered, pointing towards it.
\par \lquote That could\rquote ve happened as the Order left,\rquote  Ron murmured back.
\par \lquote So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par \lquote Maybe they\rquote re only activated if he shows up?\rquote  suggested Ron.
\par Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the door, scared to move further into the house.
\par \lquote Well, we can\rquote t stay here forever,\rquote  said Harry, and he took a step forwards.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Severus Snape?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par Mad-Eye Moody\rquote s voice whispered out of the darkness, making all three of them jump back in fright. \lquote We\rquote re not Snape!\rquote  croaked Harry, before some
thing whooshed over him like cold air and his tongue curled backwards on itself, making it impossible to speak. Before he had time to feel inside his mouth, however, his tongue had unravelled again.
\par The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleas\-ant sensation. Ron was making retching noises; Hermione stam\-mered, \lquote That m \endash  must have b \endash  been the T \endash  Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for Snape!\rquote 
\par Gingerly, Harry took another step forwards. Something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall, and
 before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, dust-coloured and terrible: Hermione screamed and so did Mrs Black, her curtains flying open; the grey figure was gliding towards them, faster and faster, its waist
-length hair and beard streaming behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets: horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at Harry.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him. \lquote No! It wasn\rquote t us! We didn\rquote t kill you \endash \rquote 
\par On the word \lquote kill\rquote  the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust: coughing, his eyes watering, Harry looked round to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her head and Ron, who was shaki
ng from head to foot, patting her clumsily on the shoulder and saying, \lquote It\rquote s all r \endash  right ... it\rquote s g \endash  gone ...\rquote 
\par Dust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight, as Mrs Black continued to scream.

\par \lquote That ... that was ...\rquote  Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped her to her feet.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but it wasn\rquote t really him, was it? Just some\-thing to scare Snape.\rquote 
\par Had it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted the horror-figure aside as casually as he had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, he led t
he other two up the hall, half expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board.
\par \lquote Before we go any further, I think we\rquote d better check,\rquote  whispered Hermione, and she raised her wand and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Homenum revelio.\rquote }{

\par Nothing happened.
\par \lquote Well, you\rquote ve just had a big shock,\rquote  said Ron kindly. \lquote What was that supposed to do?\rquote 
\par \lquote It did what I meant it to do!\rquote  said Hermione rather crossly. \lquote That was a spell to reveal human presence, and there\rquote s nobody here except us!\rquote 
\par \lquote And old Dusty,\rquote  said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from which the corpse-figure had risen.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s go up,\rquote  said Hermione, with a frightened look at the same spot, and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor.
\par Hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in the draughty room, she perched on the sofa, her arms wrapped tightly around her. Ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtain aside an inch.
\par \lquote Can\rquote t see anyone out there,\rquote  he reported. \lquote And you\rquote d think, if Harry still had a Trace on him, they\rquote d have followed us here. I know they can\rquote t get in the house, but \endash  what\rquote s up, Harry?
\rquote 
\par Harry had given a cry of pain: his scar had burned again as something flashed across his mind like a bright light on water. He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through his body, violent and brief as an electric shock.
\par \lquote What did you see?\rquote  Ron asked, advancing on Harry. \lquote Did you see him at my place?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I just felt anger \endash  he\rquote s really angry \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But that could be at The Burrow,\rquote  said Ron loudly. \lquote What else? Didn\rquote t you see anything? Was he cursing someone?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I just felt anger \endash  I couldn\rquote t tell \endash \rquote 
\par Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice, \lquote Your scar, again? But what\rquote s going on? I thought that connection had closed!\rquote 
\par \lquote It did, for a while,\rquote  muttered Harry; his scar was still painful, which made it hard to concentrate. \lquote I \endash  I think it\rquote s started opening again whenever he loses control, that\rquote s how it used to \endash \rquote 

\par \lquote But then, you\rquote ve got to close your mind!\rquote  said Hermione shrilly. \lquote Harry, Dumbledore didn\rquote t want you to use that connec\-tion, he wanted you to shut it down, that\rquote s why you were sup\-posed to 
use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your mind, remember \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I do remember, thanks,\rquote  said Harry through gritted teeth; he did not need Hermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius\rquote 
s death. He wished that he had not told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as though he were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in his scar 
was building and he fought it: it was like resisting the urge to be sick.
\par He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to exam\-ine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again and spun round
 to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing-room window and land upon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron\rquote s father.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Family safe, do not reply, we are being watched.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped on to the sofa: Hermione joined him, gripping his arm.
\par \lquote They\rquote re all right, they\rquote re all right!\rquote  she whispered, and Ron half laughed and hugged her.
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  he said over Hermione\rquote s shoulder, \lquote I \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s not a problem,\rquote  said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. \lquote It\rquote s your family, \rquote course you\rquote re worried. I\rquote d feel the same way.\rquote  He thought of Ginny. \lquote I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37

\par The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had done in the garden of The Burrow. Faintly, he heard Hermione say, \lquote I don\rquote t want to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags I\rquote ve brought and camp in here tonight?\rquote 

\par He heard Ron agree. He could not fight the pain much longer: he had to succumb.
\par \lquote Bathroom,\rquote  he muttered, and he left the room as fast as he could without running.
\par He barely made it: bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor, then, in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage tha
t did not belong to him possess his soul, saw a long room, lit only by firelight, and the great, blond Death Eater on the floor, screaming and writhing, and a slighter figure standing over him, wand outstretched, while Harry spoke in a high, cold, mercile
ss voice.
\par \lquote More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord Voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time ... You called me back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure

\par A log fell in the fire: flames reared, their light darting across a terrified, pointed white face \endash  with a sense of emerging from deep water Harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes.
\par He was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor, his nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub. He sat up. Malfoy\rquote 
s gaunt, petrified face seemed branded on the inside of his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what he had seen, by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort.
\par There was a sharp rap on the door and Harry jumped as Hermione\rquote s voice rang out.
\par \lquote Harry, do you want your toothbrush? I\rquote ve got it here.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, great, thanks,\rquote  he said, fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in.

Harry woke early next morning, wrapped in a sleeping bag on the drawing-room floor. A chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains: it was
 the cool, clear blue of watered ink, somewhere between night and dawn, and everything was quiet except for Ron and Hermione\rquote 
s slow, deep breathing. Harry glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him. Ron had had a fit of gallantry and
 insisted that Hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above his. Her arm curved to the floor, her fingers inches from Ron\rquote 
s. Harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made him feel strangely lonely.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
He looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed chandelier. Less than twenty-four hours ago he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the marquee, waiting to show in wedding guests. It seemed a lifetime away. What was going to 
happen now? He lay on the floor and he thought of the Horcruxes, of the daunting, complex mission Dumbledore had left him ... Dumbledore ...
\par The grief that had possessed him since Dumbledore\rquote s death felt different now. The accusations he had heard from Mur
iel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his brain, like diseased things, infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolised. Could Dumbledore have let such things happen? Had he been like Dudley, content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did 
not affect him? Could he have turned his back on a sister who was being imprisoned and hidden?
\par Harry thought of Godric\rquote s Hollow, of graves Dumbledore had never mentioned there; he thought of mysterious objects left, without explanation, in Dumbledore\rquote s will, and resentment swelled in the darkness. Why hadn\rquote 
t Dumbledore told him? Why hadn\rquote t he explained? Had Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all? Or had Harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed, but not trusted, never confided in?
\par Harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for company. Desperate for something to do, for distraction, he slipped out of his sleeping bag, picked up his wand and crept out of the room. On the landing he whispered, }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Lumos,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 and started to climb the stairs by wandlight.
\par On the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron had slept last time they had been here; he glanced into it. The wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes had been ripped back. Harry remembered the overturned
 troll leg downstairs. Somebody had searched the house since the Order had left. Snape? Or perhaps Mundungus, who had pilfered plenty from this house both before and after Sirius died? Harry\rquote 
s gaze wandered to the portrait that sometimes contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius\rquote 
s great-great-grandfather, but it was empty, showing nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop. Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night in the Headmaster\rquote s study at Hogwarts.
\par Harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing, where there were only two doors. The one facing him bore a nameplate reading }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Sirius. }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Harry had never entered his godfather\rquote s bedroom before. He pushed open the door, holding his wand high to cast light as widely as possible.
\par The room was 
spacious and must, once, have been handsome. There was a large bed with a carved wooden headboard, a tall window obscured by long velvet curtains and a chandelier thickly coated in dust, with candle stubs still resting in its sockets, solid wax hanging in
 frost-like drips. A fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the bed\rquote s headboard; a spider\rquote 
s web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe and as Harry moved deeper into the room, he heard a scurrying of disturbed mice.
\par The teenaged Sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and pictures that little of the walls\rquote  silvery-grey silk was visible. Harry could only assume that Sirius\rquote 
s parents had been unable to remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept them on the wall, because he was sure they would not have appreciated their eldest son\rquote 
s taste in decoration. Sirius seemed to have gone out of his way to annoy his parents. There were several large Gryffindor banners, faded scarlet and gold, just to unde
rline his difference from all the rest of the Slytherin family. There were many pictures of Muggle motorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius\rquote 
s nerve) several posters of bikini-clad Muggle girls; Harry could tell that they were Muggles because they 
remained quite stationary within their pictures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This was in contrast to the only wizarding photograph on the walls, which was a picture of four Hogwarts students standing arm in arm, laughing at the camer
a.
\par With a leap of pleasure, Harry recognised his father; his untidy, black hair stuck up at the back like Harry\rquote 
s and he, too, wore glasses. Beside him was Sirius, carelessly handsome, his slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it alive. To Sirius\rquote 
s right stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter, plump and watery-eyed, flushed with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest of gangs, with the much admired rebels that James and Sirius had been. On James\rquote s left was Lupin, e
ven then a little shabby-looking, but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding himself liked and included ... or was it simply because Harry knew how it had been, that he saw these things in the picture? He tried to take it from the wall; it w
as his, now, after all \endash  Sirius had left him everything \endash  but it would not budge. Sirius had taken no chances in preventing his parents from redecorating his room.
\par Harry looked around at the floor. The sky outside was growing brighter: a shaft of light revealed bits of paper, books and small objects scattered over the carpet. Evidently Sirius\rquote 
s bedroom had been searched too, although its contents seemed to have been judged mostly, if not entirely, worthless. A few of the books had been shaken roughly enough to part company with their covers, and sundry pages littered the floor.
\par Harry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper and examined them. He recognised one as part of an old edition of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 A History of Magic, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 by Bathilda Bagshot, and another as belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual. The third was handwritten and crumpled: he smoothed it out.

\par Impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes, he reread the letter, this time concentrating on the meaning. It was like listening to a half-remembered voice.
\par They had had a cat ... perhaps it had perished, like his parents, at Godric\rquote s Hollow ... or else fled when there was nobody left to feed it ... Sirius had bought him his first broomstick

Perhaps some less gifted Order member had needed its assistance, and Dumbledore had acted as carrier? Harry passed on ...

, had he? Was he aware that he was seeing James and Lily alive for the last time?
\par And finally Bathilda again, who told incredible stories about Dumbledore: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 it seems incredible that Dumbledore \endash }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par That Dumbledore what? But there were any number of things that would seem incredible about Dumbledore; that he had once received bottom marks in a Transfiguration test, for instance, or had taken up goat-charming like Aberforth ...
\par Harry got to his feet an
d scanned the floor: perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere. He seized papers, treating them, in his eagerness, with as little consideration as the original searcher; he pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run his hand ove
r the top of the wardrobe and crawled under the bed and armchair.
\par At last, lying face down on the floor he spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers. When he pulled it out, it proved to be most of the photograph Lily had desc
ribed in her letter. A black-haired baby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom, roaring with laughter, and a pair of legs that must have belonged to James were chasing after him. Harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with Lily
\rquote s letter and continued to look for the second sheet.
\par After another quarter of an hour, however, he was forced to conclude that the rest of his mother\rquote s letter was gone. Had it simply been lost in the sixteen years that had elapsed since it had been written, or ha
d it been taken by whoever had searched the room? Harry read the first sheet again, this time looking for clues as to what might have made the second sheet valuable. His toy broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the Death Eaters ... the onl
y potentially useful thing he could see here was possible information on Dumbledore. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 It seems incredible that Dumbledore \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Oh, Harry ...\rquote 
\par \lquote And there\rquote s this, too.\rquote 
\par He handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the baby zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom.

\par Hermione glanced around.
\par \lquote Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here?\rquote 
\par \lquote Someone had searched before me,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote I thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed. What were they after, do you think?\rquote

\par \lquote And she\rquote s still alive,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote and she lives in Godric\rquote s Hollow, Ron\rquote s Auntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding. She knew Dumbledore\rquote s family too. Be pretty interesting to talk to, wouldn

\par There was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermione gave him for Harry\rquote s liking. He took back the letter and the photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck, so as not to have to look at her and give himself away.
\par \lquote I understand why you\rquote d love to talk to her about your mum and dad, and Dumbledore too,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote But, that wouldn\rquote t really help us in our search for the Horcruxes, would it?\rquote 
 Harry did not answer, and she rushed on, \lquote Harry, I know you really want to go to Godric\rquote s Hollow, but I\rquote m scared ... I\rquote 
m scared at how easily those Death Eaters found us yesterday. It just makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried, I\rquote m sure they\rquote d be expecting you to visit it.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s not just that,\rquote  Harry said, still avoiding looking at her. \lquote Muriel said stuff about Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to know the truth ...\rquote 
\par He told Hermione everything that Muriel had told him. When he had finished, Hermione said, \lquote Of course, I can see why that\rquote s upset you, Harry \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  I\rquote m not upset,\rquote  he lied, \lquote I\rquote d just like to know whether or not it\rquote s true or \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, do you really think you\rquote ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter? How can you believe them? You knew Dumbledore!\rquote 
\par \lquote I thought I did,\rquote  he muttered.
\par \lquote But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about you! Doge is right, how can you let these people tarnish your memories of Dumbledore?\rquote 
\par He looked away, trying not to betray the resentment he felt. There it was again: choose what to believe. He wanted the truth. Why was everybody so determined that he should not get it?
\par \lquote Shall we go down to the kitchen?\rquote  Hermione suggested after a little pause. \lquote Find something for breakfast?\rquote 
\par He agreed, but grudgingly, and followed her out on to the landing and past the second door that led off it. There were deep scratch marks in the paintwork below a small sign that he had not noticed in the dark. He pause
d at the top of the stairs to read it. It was a pompous, little sign, neatly lettered by hand, the sort of thing that Percy Weasley might have stuck on his bedroom door:

\par \lquote What? That was Sirius\rquote s brother, wasn\rquote t it? Regulus Arcturus ... Regulus ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 R.A.B.!}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 There was a click, and the door swung open.
\par They moved over the threshold together, gazing around. Regulus\rquote s bedroom was slightly smaller than Sirius\rquote 
s, though it had the same sense of former grandeur. Whereas Sirius had sought to advertise his difference from the rest of the family, Regulus had striven to emphasise the opposite. The Slytherin colours of emerald an
d silver were everywhere, draping the bed, the walls and the windows. The Black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed, along with its motto, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
Toujours Pur. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Beneath this was a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck together to make a ragged collage. Hermione crossed the room to examine them.
\par \lquote They\rquote re all about Voldemort,\rquote  she said. \lquote Regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the Death Eaters \'85\rquote 
\par A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings. Harry, meanwhile, had noticed another photograph; a Hogwarts Quidditch team was smiling and waving out of the frame. He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on thei
r chests: Slytherins. Regulus was instantly recognisable as the boy sitting in the middle of the front row: he had the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother, though he was smaller, slighter and rather less handsome than Sirius had been.

\par \lquote He played Seeker,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in Voldemort\rquote s press clippings.
\par \lquote He\rquote s sitting in the middle of the front row, that\rquote s where the Seeker ... never mind,\rquote  said Harry, realising that nobody was listening: Ron 
was on his hands and knees, searching under the wardrobe. Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and approached the desk. Yet again, somebody had searched before them. The drawers\rquote 
 contents had been turned over recently, the dust disturbed, 
but there was nothing of value there: old quills, out of date textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled, a recently smashed ink bottle, its sticky residue covering the contents of the drawer.
\par \lquote There\rquote s an easier way,\rquote  said Hermione, as Harry wiped his inky fingers on his jeans. She raised her wand and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Accio locket!\rquote }
{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par Nothing happened. Ron, who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains, looked disappointed.
\par \lquote Is that it, then? It\rquote s not here?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, it could still be here, but under counter-enchantments,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Charms to prevent it being summoned magically, you know.\rquote 
\par \lquote Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,\rquote  said Harry, remembering how he had been unable to Summon the fake locket.
\par \lquote How are we supposed to find it, then?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote We search manually,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote That\rquote s a good idea,\rquote  said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he resumed his examination of the curtains.
\par They combed every inch of the room for over an hour, but were forced, finally, to conclude that the locket was not there.
\par The sun had risen now; its light dazzled them even through the grimy landing windows.
\par \lquote It could be somewhere else in the house, though,\rquote  said Hermione in a rallying tone as they walked back downstairs: as Harry and Ron had become more discouraged, she seemed to have become more determined. \lquote Whether he\rquote 
d managed to destroy it or not, he\rquote d want to keep it hidden from Voldemort, wouldn\rquote t he? Remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last time? That clock that shot
 bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle Ron; Regulus might have put them there to protect the locket\rquote s hiding place, even though we didn\rquote t realise it at ... at ...\rquote 
\par Harry and Ron looked at her. She was standing with one foot in mid-air, with the dumbstruck look of one who had just been Obliviated; her eyes had even drifted out of focus.
\par \lquote ... at the time,\rquote  she finished in a whisper.
\par \lquote Something wrong?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote There was a locket.\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Harry and Ron together.
\par \lquote In the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could open it. And we ... we ...\rquote 
\par Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stomach. He remembered: he had even handled the thing as they passed it round, each trying in turn to prise it open. It had 
been tossed into a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox of Wartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy ...
\par \lquote Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us,\rquote  said Harry. It was the only chance, the only slender hope left to them, and he was going to cling to it until forced to let go. \lquote 
He had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen. C\rquote mon.\rquote 
\par He ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the other two thundering along in his wake. They made so much noise that they woke the portrait of Sirius\rquote s mother as they passed through the hall.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Filth! Mudbloods! Scum!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
she screamed after them as they dashed down into the basement kitchen and slammed the door behind them.
\par Harry ran the length of the room, skidded to a halt at the door of Kreacher\rquote 
s cupboard and wrenched it open. There was the nest of dirty, old blankets in which the house-elf had once slept, but they were no longer glittering with the trinkets Kreacher had salvaged. The only thing there was an old copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Nature\rquote s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
Refusing to believe his eyes, Harry snatched up the blankets and shook them. A dead mouse fell out and rolled dismally across the floor. Ron groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair; Hermione closed her eyes.
\par \lquote It\rquote s not over yet,\rquote  said Harry, and he raised his voice and called, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Kreacher!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

and the house-elf that Harry had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace: tiny, half-human-sized, h
is pale skin hanging off him in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from his bat-like ears. He was still wearing the filthy rag in which they had first met him, and the contemptuous look he bent upon Harry showed that his attitude to his change of owner
ship had altered no more than his outfit.
\par \lquote Master,\rquote  croaked Kreacher in his bullfrog\rquote s voice, and he bowed low, muttering to his knees, \lquote back in my mistress\rquote s old house with the blood traitor Weasley and the Mudblood \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I forbid you to call anyone \'93blood traitor\'94 or \'93Mudblood\'94,\rquote 
 growled Harry. He would have found Kreacher, with his snout-like nose and bloodshot eyes, a distinctly unlovable object even if the elf had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve got a question for you,\rquote  said Harry, his heart beating rather fast as he looked down at the elf, \lquote and I order you to answer it truthfully. Understand?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Master,\rquote  said Kreacher, bowing low again: Harry saw his lips moving soundlessly, undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter.
\par \lquote Two years ago,\rquote  said Harry, his heart now hammering against his ribs, \lquote there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs. We threw it out. Did you steal it back?\rquote 
\par There was a moment\rquote s silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to look Harry full in the face. Then he said, \lquote Yes.\rquote 
\par \lquote Where is it now?\rquote  asked Harry jubilantly, as Ron and Hermione looked gleeful.
\par Kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reactions to his next word.
\par \lquote Gone.\rquote 
\par \lquote Gone?\rquote  echoed Harry, elation flooding out of him. \lquote What do you mean, it\rquote s gone?\rquote 
\par The elf shivered. He swayed.
\par \lquote Kreacher,\rquote  said Harry fiercely, \lquote I order you \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Mundungus Fletcher,\rquote  croaked the elf, his eyes still tight shut. \lquote Mundungus Fletcher stole it all: Miss Bella and Miss Cissy\rquote s pictures, my mistress\rquote 
s gloves, the Order of Merlin, First Class, the goblets with the family crest, and, and \endash \rquote 
\par Kreacher was gulping for air: his hollow chest was rising and falling rapidly, then his eyes flew open and he uttered a blood-curdling scream.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote \endash  and the locket, Master Regulus\rquote s locket, Kreacher did wrong, Kreacher failed in his orders!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par Harry reacted instinctively: as Kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate, he launched himself upon the elf, flattening him. Hermione\rquote s scream mingled with Kreacher\rquote s, but Harry bellowed louder than both of them: \lquote 
Kreacher, I order you to stay still!\rquote 
\par He felt the elf freeze and released him. Kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor, tears gushing from his sagging eyes.
\par \lquote Harry, let him up!\rquote  Hermione whispered.
\par \lquote So he can beat himself up with the poker?\rquote  snorted Harry, kneeling beside the elf. \lquote I don\rquote t think so. Right, Kreacher, I want the truth: how do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the locket?\rquote 
\par \lquote Kreacher saw him!\rquote  gasped the elf, as tears poured over his snout and into his mouth full of greying teeth. \lquote Kreacher saw him coming out of Kreacher\rquote s cupboard with his hands full of Kreacher\rquote 
s treasures. Kreacher told the sneakthief to stop, but Mundungus Fletcher laughed and r \endash  ran ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You called the locket \'93Master Regulus\rquote s\'94,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote 
Why? Where did it come from? What did Regulus have to do with it? Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket, and everything Regulus had to do with it!\rquote 
\par The elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face between his knees and began to rock backwards and forwards. When he spoke, his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent, echoing kitchen.
\par \lquote Master Sirius ran away, good riddance, for he was a bad boy and broke my mistress\rquote s heart with his 
lawless ways. But Master Regulus had proper pride; he knew what was due to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked of the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggle-borns
 ... and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. So proud, so proud, so happy to serve ...
\par \lquote And one day, a year after he had joined, Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to see Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked Kreacher. And Master Regulus said ... he said ...\rquote 
\par The old elf rocked faster than ever.
\par \lquote ... he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.\rquote 
\par \lquote Voldemort needed an }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 elf?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
Harry repeated, looking round at Ron and Hermione, who looked just as puzzled as he did.
\par \lquote Oh yes,\rquote  moaned Kreacher. \lquote And Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher. It was an honour, said Master Regulus, an honour for him and for Kreacher, who must be sure to do whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do ... and then to c 
\endash  come home.\rquote 
\par Kreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in sobs.
\par \lquote So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what they were to do, but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. And beyond the cave there was a cavern, and in the cavern was a great, black lake \'85\rquote 
\par The hairs on the back of Harry\rquote s neck stood up. Kreacher\rquote s croaking voice seemed to come to him from across that dark water. He saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been present.
\par \lquote ... there was a boat \'85\rquote 
\par Of cou
rse there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly green and tiny, bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim towards the island in the centre. This, then, was how Voldemort had tested the defences surrounding the Horcrux: by borrowing a disp
osable creature, a house-elf ...
\par \lquote There was a b \endash  basin full of potion on the island. The D \endash  Dark Lord made Kreacher drink it ...\rquote 
\par The elf quaked from head to foot.
\par \lquote Kreacher drank, and as he drank, he saw terrible things ... Kreacher\rquote s insides burned ... 
Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, but the Dark Lord only laughed ... he made Kreacher drink all the potion ... he dropped a locket into the empty basin ... he filled it with more potion.
\par \lquote And then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the island ...\rquote 
\par Harry could see it happening. He watched Voldemort\rquote s white, snake-like face vanishing into darkness, those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the thrashing elf whose death would occur within minutes, whenever he 
succumbed to the desperate thirst that the burning potion caused its victim ... but here, Harry\rquote s imagination could go no further, for he could not see how Kreacher had escaped.
\par \lquote Kreacher needed water, he crawled to the island\rquote s edge and he drank from the black lake ... and hands, dead hands, came out of the water and dragged Kreacher under the surface ...\rquote 
\par \lquote How did you get away?\rquote  Harry asked, and he was not surprised to hear himself whispering.
\par Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked at Harry with his great, bloodshot eyes.
\par \lquote Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote I know \endash  but how did you escape the Inferi?\rquote 
\par Kreacher did not seem to understand.
\par \lquote Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,\rquote  he repeated.
\par \lquote I know, but \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Well, it\rquote s obvious, isn\rquote t it, Harry?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote He Disapparated!\rquote 
\par \lquote But ... you couldn\rquote t Apparate in and out of that cave,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote otherwise Dumbledore \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Elf magic isn\rquote t like wizard\rquote s magic, is it?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I mean, they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can\rquote t.\rquote 
\par There was silence as Harry digested this. How could Voldemort have made such a mistake? But even as he thought this, Hermione spoke, and her voice was icy.
\par \lquote Of course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of house-elves far beneath his notice, just like all the pure-bloods who treat them like animals ... it would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didn\rquote t.\rquote 

\par \lquote The house-elf\rquote s highest law is his master\rquote s bidding,\rquote  intoned Kreacher. \lquote Kreacher was told to come home, so Kreacher came home ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, then, you did what you were told, didn\rquote t you?\rquote  said Hermione kindly. \lquote You didn\rquote t disobey orders at all!\rquote 
\par Kreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever.
\par \lquote So what happened when you got back?\rquote  Harry asked. \lquote What did Regulus say when you told him what had happened?\rquote 
\par \lquote Master Regulus was very worried, very worried,\rquote  croaked Kreacher. \lquote Master Regulus told Kreacher to stay hidden, and not to leave the house. And then ... it was a little while later ... Master Regulus came to 
find Kreacher in his cupboard one night, and Master Regulus was strange, not as he usually was, disturbed in his mind, Kreacher could tell ... and he asked Kreacher to take him to the cave, the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord ...\rquote 

\par And so they had set off. Harry could visualise them quite clearly, the frightened old elf and the thin, dark Seeker who had so resembled Sirius ... Kreacher knew how to open the concealed entrance to the underground cavern, knew how to raise the tiny boat
; this time it was his beloved Regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of poison ...
\par \lquote And he made you drink the potion?\rquote  said Harry, disgusted.
\par But Kreacher shook his head and wept. Hermione\rquote s hands leapt to her mouth: she seemed to have understood something.
\par \lquote M \endash  Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord had,\rquote  said Kreacher, tears pouring down either side of his snout-like nose. \lquote 
And he told Kreacher to take it and, when the basin was empty, to switch the lockets \'85\rquote 
\par Kreacher\rquote s sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had to concen\-trate hard to understand him.
\par \lquote And he ordered \endash  Kreacher to leave \endash  without him. And he told Kreacher \endash  to go home \endash  and never to tell my mistress \endash  what he had done \endash  but to destroy \endash  the first locket. And he drank \endash 
 all the potion \endash  and Kreacher swapped the lockets \endash  and watched ... as Master Regulus ... was dragged beneath the water ... and ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, Kreacher!\rquote  wailed Hermione, who was crying. She dropped to her knees beside the elf and tried to hug him. At once he was on his feet, cringing away from her, quite obviously repulsed.
\par \lquote The Mudblood touched Kreacher, he will not allow it, what would his mistress say?\rquote 
\par \lquote I told you not to call her \'93Mudblood\'94!\rquote  snarled Harry, but the elf was already punishing himself: he fell to the ground and banged his forehead on the floor.
\par \lquote Stop him \endash  stop him!\rquote  Hermione cried. \lquote Oh, don\rquote t you see, now, how sick it is, the way they\rquote ve got to obey?\rquote 
\par \lquote Kreacher \endash  stop, stop!\rquote  shouted Harry.
\par The elf lay on the floor
, panting and shivering, green mucus glistening around his snout, a bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself, his eyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears. Harry had never seen anything so pitiful.
\par \lquote So you brought the locket home,\rquote  he said relentlessly, for he was determined to know the full story. \lquote And you tried to destroy it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it,\rquote  moaned the elf. \lquote Kreacher tried everything, everything he knew, but nothing, nothing would wo
rk ... so many powerful spells upon the casing, Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it, but it would not open ... Kreacher punished himself, he tried again, he punished himself, he tried again. Kreacher failed to obey orders, Kreache
r could not destroy the locket! And his mistress was mad with grief, because Master Regulus had disappeared, and Kreacher could not tell her what had happened, no, because Master Regulus had f \endash  f \endash  forbidden him to tell any of the f 
\endash  f \endash  family what happened in the c \endash  cave \'85\rquote 
\par Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words. Tears flowed down Hermione\rquote s cheeks as she watched Kreacher, but she did not dare touch him again. Even Ron, who was no fan of Kreacher\rquote s, looked troubled. Harry s
at back on his heels and shook his head, trying to clear it.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t understand you, Kreacher,\rquote  he said finally. \lquote Voldemort tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy to 
go to Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to Voldemort through them ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, Kreacher doesn\rquote t think like that,\rquote  said Hermione, wiping her eyes on the back of her hand. \lquote He\rquote s a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to Kreacher wasn\rquote 
t that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher? He\rquote s loyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs Black must have been, and Regulus certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted thei
r beliefs. I know what you\rquote re going to say,\rquote  she went on, as Harry began to protest, \lquote that Regulus changed his mind ... but he doesn\rquote 
t seem to have explained that to Kreacher, does he? And I think I know why. Kreacher and Regulus\rquote s family were all safer if they kept to the old pure-blood line. Regulus was trying to protect them all.\rquote 
\par \lquote Sirius \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it\rquote s no good looking like that, you know it\rquote s true. Kreacher had been alone for a long time when Sirius came to live here, and he was probably starving for a bit of affection. I\rquote 
m sure \'93Miss Cissy\'94 and \'93Miss Bella\'94 were perfectly lovely to Kreacher when he turned up, so he did them a favour and told them everything they wanted to know. I\rquote ve said all along that wizards would
 pay for how they treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort did ... and so did Sirius.\rquote 
\par Harry had no retort. As he watched Kreacher sobbing on the floor, he remembered what Dumbledore had said to him, mere hours after Sirius\rquote s death: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
I do not think Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human\rquote s ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par \lquote Kreacher,\rquote  said Harry, after a while, \lquote when you feel up to it, er ... please sit up.\rquote 
\par It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccoughed himself into silence. Then he pushed himself into a sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child.
\par \lquote Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,\rquote  said Harry. He glanced at Hermione for assistance: he wanted to give the order kindly, but at the same time, he could not pretend t
hat it was not an order. However, the change in his tone seemed to have gained her approval: she smiled encouragingly.
\par \lquote Kreacher, I want you, please, to go and find Mundungus Fletcher. We need to find out where the locket \endash  where Master Regulus\rquote s locket is. It\rquote s really important. We want to finish the work Master Regulus started, we want to 
\endash  er \endash  ensure that he didn\rquote t die in vain.\rquote 
\par Kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at Harry.
\par \lquote Find Mundungus Fletcher?\rquote  he croaked.
\par \lquote And bring him here, to Grimmauld Place,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Do you think you could do that for us?\rquote 
\par As Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry had a sudden inspiration. He pulled out Hagrid\rquote s purse and took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus had placed the note to Voldemort.
\par \lquote Kreacher, I\rquote d, er, like you to have this,\rquote  he said, pressing the locket into the elf\rquote s hand. \lquote This belonged to Regulus and I\rquote m sure he\rquote d want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote Overkill, mate,\rquote  said Ron, as the elf took one look at the locket, let out a howl of shock and misery and threw himself back on to the ground.
\par It took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who was so overcome to be presented with a Black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly. When finally he was able to totter a few steps, they all accom\-
panied him to his cupboard, watched him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets, and assured him that they would make its p
rotection their first priority while he was away. He then made two low bows to Harry and Ron, and even gave a funny little spasm in Hermione\rquote

If Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry was confident that the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high antici\-pation. However, Kreacher di
d not return that morning, or even that afternoon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of mouldy bread, upon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Kreacher did 
not return the following day, nor the day after that. However, two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve, and they remained there into the night, gazing in the direction of the house that they could not see.
\par \lquote Death Eaters, for sure,\rquote  said Ron, as he, Harry and Hermione watched from the drawing-room windows. \lquote Reckon they know we\rquote re in here?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think so,\rquote  said Hermione, though she looked frightened, \lquote or they\rquote d have sent Snape in after us, wouldn\rquote t they?\rquote 
\par \lquote D\rquote you reckon he\rquote s been in here and had his tongue tied by Moody\rquote s curse?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote otherwise he\rquote d have been able to tell that lot how to get in, wouldn\rquote t he? But they\rquote re probably watching to see whether we turn up. They know that Harry owns the house, after all.\rquote 

\par \lquote How do they \endash ?\rquote  began Harry.
\par \lquote Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember? They\rquote ll know Sirius left you the place.\rquote 
\par The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve. They had not heard a word from anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr Weasley\rquote s Patronus, and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irrit\-
able, Ron had developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket: this particularly infuriated Hermione, who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 The Tales of Beedle the Bard }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off.
\par \lquote Will you stop it!\rquote  she cried on the third evening of Kreacher\rquote s absence, as all light was sucked from the drawing room yet again.
\par \lquote Sorry, sorry!\rquote  said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. \lquote I don\rquote t know I\rquote m doing it!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, can\rquote t you find something useful to occupy yourself?\rquote 
\par \lquote What, like reading kids\rquote  stories?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore left me this book, Ron \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I\rquote m supposed to use it!\rquote 
\par Unable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them. He headed downstairs towards the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where 
Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain.
\par Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten: he pulled out his wand, moved in
to the shadows beside the decapitated elf-heads and waited. The door opened: he saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it. The intruder took a step forwards and Moody\rquote 
s voice asked, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Severus Snape?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
Then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him, raising its dead hand.
\par \lquote It was not I who killed you, Albus,\rquote  said a quiet voice.
\par The jinx broke: the dust-figure exploded again, and it was impossible to make out the newcomer through the dense grey cloud it left behind.
\par Harry pointed his wand into the middle of it.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t move!\rquote 
\par He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs Black: at the sound of his yell the curtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Mudbloods and filt

\par Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, like his, at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below.
\par \lquote Hold your fire, it\rquote s me, Remus!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, thank goodness,\rquote  said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs Black instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. Ron, too, lowered his wand, but Harry did not.
\par \lquote Show yourself!\rquote  he called back.
\par Lupin moved forwards into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of surrender.
\par \lquote I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four creators of the Marauder\rquote s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, all right,\rquote  said Harry, lowering his wand, \lquote but I had to check, didn\rquote t I?\rquote 
\par \lquote Speaking as your ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn\rquote t be quite so quick to lower your defences.\rquote 
\par They ran down the stairs towards him. Wrapped in a thick, black travelling cloak, he looked exhausted, but pleased to see them.
\par \lquote No sign of Severus, then?\rquote  he asked.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote What\rquote s going on? Is everyone OK?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Lupin, \lquote but we\rquote re all being watched. There are a couple of Death Eaters in the square outside \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  we know \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  I had to Apparate very precisely on to the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me. They can\rquote t know you\rquote re in here or I\rquote m sure they\rquote d have more people out there; they\rquote 
re staking out everywhere that\rquote s got any connection with you, Harry. Let\rquote s go downstairs, there\rquote s a lot to tell you and I want to know what happened after you left The Burrow.\rquote 
\par They descended into the kitchen, where Hermione 
pointed her wand at the grate. A fire sprang up instantly: it gave the illusion of cosiness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table. Lupin pulled a few Butterbeers from beneath his travelling cloak and they sat down.
\par \lquote I\rquote d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote So, you came straight here after the wedding?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a caf\'e9 on Tottenham Court Road.\rquote 
\par Lupin slopped most of his Butterbeer down his front.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote What?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par They explained what had happened; when they had finished, Lupin looked aghast.
\par \lquote But how did they find you so quickly? It\rquote s impossible to track anyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear!\rquote 
\par \lquote And it doesn\rquote t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time, does it?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote We wondered,\rquote  said Hermione tentatively, \lquote whether Harry could still have the Trace on him?\rquote 
\par \lquote Impossible,\rquote  said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relieved. \lquote Apart from anything else, they\rquote d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn\rquote t they? But I can\rquote 
t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that\rquote s worrying, really worrying.\rquote 
\par He looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that question could wait.
\par \lquote Tell us what happened after we left, we haven\rquote t heard a thing since Ron\rquote s dad told us the family were safe.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, Kingsley saved us,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote Thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived.\rquote 
\par \lquote Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?\rquote  interjected Hermione.
\par \lquote A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they\rquote re the same thing now,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote There were about a dozen of them, but they didn\rquote 
t know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumour that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it\rquote s true, he didn\rquote t give you away.\rquote 
\par Harry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt. He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man\rquote s final act had been to try to protect Harry.
\par \lquote The Death Eaters searched The Burrow from top to bottom,\rquote  Lupin went on. \lquote They found the ghoul, but didn\rquote t want to get too close \endash 
 and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but, of course, nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there.
\par \lquote At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing their way into every Order-connected house in the country. No deaths,\rquote  he added quickly, forestalling the question, \lquote 
but they were rough. They burned down Dedalus Diggle\rquote s house, but as you know he wasn\rquote t there, and they used the Cruciatus Curse on Tonks\rquote s family. Again, trying to find out where you went after you visited them. They\rquote 
re all right \endash  shaken, obviously, but otherwise OK.\rquote 
\par \lquote The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?\rquote  Harry asked, remembering how effective these had been on the night he had crashed in Tonks\rquote s parents\rquote  garden.
\par \lquote What you\rquote ve got to realise, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the Ministry on their side now,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote They\rquote ve got the power 
to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive spell we\rquote d cast against them, and once inside, they were completely open about why they\rquote d come.\rquote 
\par \lquote And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry\rquote s whereabouts out of people?\rquote  asked Hermione, an edge to her voice.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Lupin. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Daily Prophet.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par \lquote Here,\rquote  he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, \lquote you\rquote ll know sooner or later anyway. That\rquote s their pretext for going after you.\rquote 
\par Harry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own face filled the front page. He read the headline over it:

\par \lquote But surely people realise what\rquote s going on?\rquote 
\par \lquote The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote The official version of Scrimgeour\rquote s murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.\rquote

the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thick\-nesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the Ministry.
\par \lquote Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: there has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is the point: they whisper. They daren
\rquote t confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himsel
f might have provoked open rebellion: remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty and fear.\rquote 
\par \lquote And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote involves warning the wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort?\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s certainly part of it,\rquote  said Lupin, \lquote and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is dead, you \endash  the Boy Who Lived \endash

\par \lquote Ron, as we\rquote re on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in the country, I don\rquote t think it matters. If I was going back to school, it would be different. What\rquote s Voldemort planning for Hogwarts?\rquote 
 she asked Lupin.
\par \lquote Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,\rquote  he replied. \lquote That was announced yesterday. It\rquote 
s a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferre
d. This way, Voldemort will have the whole wizarding population under his eye from a young age. And it\rquote s also another way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given Blood Status \endash 
 meaning that they have proven to the Ministry that they are of wizard descent \endash  before they are allowed to attend.\rquote 
\par Harry felt sickened and angry: at this moment excited eleven-year-olds would be poring over stacks of newly purchased spellbooks, unaware that they would never see Hogwarts, perhaps never see their families again, either.
\par \lquote It\rquote s ... it\rquote s ...\rquote  he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly, \lquote I know.\rquote 
\par Lupin hesitated.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll understand if you can\rquote t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.\rquote 
\par \lquote He did,\rquote  Harry replied, \lquote and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they\rquote re coming with me.\rquote 
\par \lquote Can you confide in me what the mission is?\rquote 
\par Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but greying hair, and wished that he could return a different answer.
\par \lquote I can\rquote t, Remus, I\rquote m sorry. If Dumbledore didn\rquote t tell you, I don\rquote t think I can.\rquote 
\par \lquote I thought you\rquote d say that,\rquote  said Lupin, looking disappointed. \lquote But I might still be of some use to you. You know wh

\par Harry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine.
\par Hermione, however, looked puzzled.
\par \lquote But what about Tonks?\rquote  she asked.
\par \lquote What about her?\rquote  said Lupin.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Hermione, frowning, \lquote you\rquote re married! How does she feel about you going away with us?\rquote 
\par \lquote Tonks will be perfectly safe,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote She\rquote ll be at her parents\rquote  house.\rquote 
\par There was something strange in Lupin\rquote s tone; it was almost cold. There was also something odd in the idea of Tonks remain\-ing hidden at her parents\rquote  house; she was, after all, a mem
ber of the Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick of the action.
\par \lquote Remus,\rquote  said Hermione tentatively, \lquote is everything all right ... you know ... between you and \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Everything is fine, thank you,\rquote  said Lupin pointedly.
\par Hermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward and embarrassed one, and then Lupin said, with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant, \lquote Tonks is going to have a baby.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, how wonderful!\rquote  squealed Hermione.
\par \lquote Excellent!\rquote  said Ron enthusiastically.
\par \lquote Congratulations,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then said, \lquote So ... do you accept my offer? Will three become four? I cannot believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved, he appointed me your Defence
 Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all. And I must tell you that I believe that we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined.\rquote 
\par Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry.
\par \lquote Just \endash  just to be clear,\rquote  he said. \lquote You want to leave Tonks at her parents\rquote  house and come away with us?\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote ll be perfectly safe there, they\rquote ll look after her,\rquote  said Lupin. He spoke with a finality bordering on indifference. \lquote Harry, I\rquote m sure James would have wanted me to stick with you.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Harry slowly, \lquote I\rquote m not. I\rquote m pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you aren\rquote t sticking with your own kid, actually.\rquote 
\par Lupin\rquote s face drained of colour. The temperature in the kitchen might have dropped ten degrees. Ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorise it, while Hermione\rquote 
s eyes swivelled backwards and forwards from Harry to Lupin.
\par \lquote You don\rquote t understand,\rquote  said Lupin at last.
\par \lquote Explain, then,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Lupin swallowed.
\par \lquote I \endash  I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better judgement and I have regretted it very much ever since.\rquote 
\par \lquote I see,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote so you\rquote re just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us?\rquote 
\par Lupin sprang to his feet: his chair toppled over backwards, and he glared at them so fiercely that Harry saw, for the first time ever, the shadow of the wolf upon his human face.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you understand what I\rquote ve done to my wife and my unborn child? I should never have married her, I\rquote ve made her an outcast!\rquote 
\par Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned.
\par \lquote You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore\rquote s protection at Hogwarts! You don\rquote t know how most of the wizarding world sees creatures like me! When they know of my affliction, they can barely talk to me! Don
\rquote t you see what I\rquote ve done? Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage, what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf? And the child \endash  the child \endash \rquote 
\par Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged.
\par \lquote My kind don\rquote t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it \endash 
 how can I forgive myself, when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child? And if, by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, without a father of whom it must always be ashamed!\rquote 

\par \lquote Remus!\rquote  whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. \lquote Don\rquote t say that \endash  how could any child be ashamed of you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, I don\rquote t know, Hermione,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I\rquote d be pretty ashamed of him.\rquote 
\par Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled him to his feet too. Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him.
\par \lquote If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad,\rquote  Harry said, \lquote what will they do to a half-werewolf whose father\rquote s in the Order? My father died trying to protect my mother and me, and you reckon he\rquote 
d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us?\rquote 
\par \lquote How \endash  how dare you?\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote This is not about a desire for \endash  for danger or personal glory \endash  how dare you suggest such a \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I think you\rquote re feeling a bit of a daredevil,\rquote  Harry said. \lquote You fancy stepping into Sirius\rquote s shoes \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, no!\rquote  Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare into Lupin\rquote s livid face.
\par \lquote I\rquote d never have believed this,\rquote  Harry said. \lquote The man who taught me to fight Dementors \endash  a coward.\rquote 
\par Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own; there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backwards as if punched; as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupin\rquote s cloak dis\-
appearing round the door.
\par \lquote Remus, Remus, come back!\rquote  Hermione cried, but Lupin did not respond. A moment later they heard the front door slam.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  wailed Hermione. \lquote How could you?\rquote 
\par \lquote It was easy,\rquote  said Harry. He stood up; he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t look at me like that!\rquote  he snapped at Hermione.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t you start on her!\rquote  snarled Ron.
\par \lquote No \endash  no \endash  we mustn\rquote t fight!\rquote  said Hermione, launching herself between them.
\par \lquote You shouldn\rquote t have said that stuff to Lupin,\rquote  Ron told Harry.
\par \lquote He had it coming to him,\rquote  said Harry. Broken images were racing each other through his mind: Sirius falling through the Veil; Dumbledore suspended, broken, in mid-air; a flash of green light and his mother\rquote 
s voice, begging for mercy ...
\par \lquote Parents,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote shouldn\rquote t leave their kids unless \endash  unless they\rquote ve got to.\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry \endash \rquote  said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off and walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured
. He had once spoken to Lupin out of that fireplace, seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled him. Now Lupin\rquote 
s tortured, white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a sickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back, communicating silently.
\par He turned round and caught them turning hurriedly away from each other.
\par \lquote I know I shouldn\rquote t have called him a coward.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, you shouldn\rquote t,\rquote  said Ron at once.
\par \lquote But he\rquote s acting like one.\rquote 
\par \lquote All the same ...\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote I know,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote But if it makes him go back to Tonks, it\rquote ll be worth it, won\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par He could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron uncertain. Harry looked do
wn at his feet, thinking of his father. Would James have backed Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend?
\par The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron and Hermione\rquote s unspoken reproaches. The }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He walked over to it and sat down, opened the paper at random and pretended to read. He could 
not take in the words, his mind was still too full of the encounter with Lupin. He was sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Prophet. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore\rquote s name leapt out at him. It 
was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the words: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\par His attention caught, Harry examined the picture more care\-fully. Dumbledore\rquote 
s father, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, was little longer than a loaf of bread and no more distinctive-looki
ng. The mother, Kendra, had jet black hair pulled into a high bun. Her face had a carved quality about it. Despite the high-necked silk gown she wore, Harry thought of Native Americans as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones and straight nose. Albus 
and Aberforth wore matching lacy col\-lared jackets and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus looked several years older, but otherwise the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albus\rquote 
s nose had been broken and before he started wearing glasses.
\par The family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up out of the newspaper. Baby Ariana\rquote s arm waved vaguely out of her shawl. Harry looked above the picture and saw the headline:

Harry had been wrong: what he had read had indeed made him feel worse. He looked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family. Was it true? How could he find out? He wanted to go to Godric\rquote 
s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him; he wanted to visit the place where he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. He was in the process of lowering the news\-paper, to ask Ron and Hermione\rquote s opinions, when a deafening }{

For the first time in three days, Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher. His immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room and for a split second, he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that ha
d appeared out of thin air right beside his chair. He hurried to his feet as Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to Harry, croaked, \lquote Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.\rquote 
\par Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too quick for him.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Expelliarmus!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par Mundungus\rquote s wand soared into the air and Hermione caught it. Wild-eyed, Mundungus dived for the stairs: Ron rugby-tackled him and Mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron\rquote s grip. \lquote Wha\rquote ve I done? Setting a bleedin\rquote  \rquote ouse-elf on me, what are you playing at, wha\rquote ve I done, lemme go, lemme go, or 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re not in much of a position to make threats,\rquote  said Harry. He threw 
aside the newspaper, crossed the kitchen in a few strides and dropped to his knees beside Mundungus, who stopped struggling and looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and watched as Harry pointed his wand deliberately at Mundungus\rquote 
s nose. Mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke: his hair was matted and his robes stained.
\par \lquote Kreacher apologises for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,\rquote  croaked the elf. \lquote Fletcher knows how to avoid capture, has many hidey-holes and accomplices. Nevertheless, Kreacher cornered the thief in the end.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote ve done really well, Kreacher,\rquote  said Harry, and the elf bowed low.
\par \lquote Right, we\rquote ve got a few questions for you,\rquote  Harry told Mundun\-gus, who shouted at once: \lquote I panicked, OK? I never wanted to come along, no offence, mate, but I never volunteered to die for you, an\rquote  that was bleedin
\rquote  You-Know-Who come flying at me, anyone woulda got outta there, I said all along I didn\rquote t wanna do it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote For your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Well, you\rquote re a bunch of bleedin\rquote  \rquote eroes, then, aren\rquote t you, but I never pretended I was up for killing meself \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-Eye,\rquote  said Harry, moving his wand a little closer to Mundungus\rquote s baggy, bloodshot eyes. \lquote We already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well then, why the \rquote ell am I being \rquote unted down by \rquote ouse-elves? Or is this about them goblets again? I ain\rquote t got none of \rquote em left, or you could \rquote ave \rquote em \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s not about the goblets either, although you\rquote re getting warmer,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Shut up and listen.\rquote 
\par It felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he could demand some small portion of truth. Harry\rquote s wand was now so close to the bridge of Mundungus\rquote s nose that Mundungus had gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view.
\par \lquote When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,\rquote  Harry began, but Mundungus interrupted him again.
\par \lquote Sirius never cared about any of the junk \endash \rquote 
\par There was the sound of pattering feet, a blaze of shining copper, an echoing clang and a shriek of agony: Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the head with a saucepan.
\par \lquote Call \rquote im off, call \rquote im off, \rquote e should be locked up!\rquote  screamed Mundungus, cowering as Kreacher raised the heavy-bottomed pan again.
\par \lquote Kreacher, no!\rquote  shouted Harry.
\par Kreacher\rquote s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still held aloft.
\par \lquote Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?\rquote 
\par Ron laughed.
\par \lquote We need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading you can do the honours,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Thank you very much, Master,\rquote  said Kreacher with a bow, and he retreated a short distance, his great, pale eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing.
\par \lquote When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find,\rquote  Harry began again, \lquote you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there.\rquote  Harry\rquote 
s mouth was suddenly dry: he could sense Ron and Hermione\rquote s tension and excitement too. \lquote What did you do with it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Why?\rquote  asked Mundungus. \lquote Is it valuable?\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote ve still got it!\rquote  cried Hermione.
\par \lquote No, he hasn\rquote t,\rquote  said Ron shrewdly. \lquote He\rquote s wondering whether he should have asked more money for it.\rquote 
\par \lquote More?\rquote  said Mundungus. \lquote That wouldn\rquote t have been effing dif\-ficult ... bleedin\rquote  gave it away, di\rquote n\rquote  I? No choice.\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote I was selling in Diagon Alley an\rquote  she come up to me an\rquote  asks if I\rquote ve got a licence for trading in magical artefacts. Bleedin\rquote  snoop. She was gonna fine me, but she took a fancy to the locket an\rquote  told me she
\rquote d take it and let me off that time an\rquote  to fink meself lucky.\rquote 
\par \lquote Who was this woman?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote I dunno, some Ministry hag.\rquote 
\par Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled.
\par \lquote Little woman. Bow on top of \rquote er head.\rquote 
\par He frowned and then added, \lquote Looked like a toad.\rquote 
\par Harry dropped his wand: it hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows, which ignited.

screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her wand, engulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus.
\par Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Ron and Hermione\rquote s faces. The scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again.

As August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place shrivelled in the sun until it was brittle and brown. The inhabitants of number twelve were never seen by anybody in the surrounding houses, and nor was number twelve itself. 
The Muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly mos
t intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in Grimmauld Place with no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railings facing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching the join between the two houses. The lurkers wer
e
 never the same two days running, although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing. Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them might glance back, wondering w
hy anyone would wear such long cloaks in this heat.
\par The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. Occasionally one of them started forwards excitedly, as if they had seen something interesting at last, only to fall back looking disappointed.
\par On the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than ever before. Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting stil
l appeared elusive. As evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first time in weeks, there occurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting. The man with the twisted face p
ointed and his closest companion, a podgy, pallid man, started forwards, but a moment later they had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and disappointed.
\par Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the hall. He h
ad nearly lost his balance as he Apparated on to the top step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. Shutting the front door carefully behind him he pulled off the Invis
ibility Cloak, draped it over his arm and hurried along the gloomy hallway towards the door that led to the basement, a stolen copy of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 clutched in his hand.
\par The usual low whisper of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Severus}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote I didn\rquote t kill you,\rquote  he said, once it had unrolled, then held his breath as the dusty jinx-figure exploded. He waited until he was halfway down the stairs to the kitchen, out of earshot of Mrs Black and clear of the dus
t cloud before calling, \lquote I\rquote ve got news, and you won\rquote t like it.\rquote 
\par The kitchen was almost unrecognisable. Every surface now shone: copper pots and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow, the wooden table top gleamed, the goblets and plates already laid for di
nner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire, on which a cauldron was simmering. Nothing in the room, however, was more dramatically different than the house-elf who now came hurrying towards Harry, dressed in a snowy-white towel, his ear hair as
 clean and fluffy as cotton wool, Regulus\rquote s locket bouncing on his thin chest.
\par \lquote Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,\rquote  croaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang it on a hook on the wall, bes
ide a number of old-fashioned robes that had been freshly laundered.
\par \lquote What\rquote s happened?\rquote  Ron asked apprehensively. He and Hermione had been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand-drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now t
hey watched Harry as he strode towards them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered parchment.
\par A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at them all, beneath a headline that read: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER.}{

\par Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying story out loud.

\par \lquote \'93Merlin\rquote s pants\'94?\rquote  repeated Ron, looking amused. \lquote She must be upset.\rquote  He pulled the newspaper towards him and perused the article about Snape.
\par \lquote The other teachers won\rquote t stand for this. McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout all know the truth, they know how Dumble\-dore died. They won\rquote t accept Snape as Headmaster. And who are these Carrows?\rquote 
\par \lquote Death Eaters,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote There are pictures of them inside. They were at the top of the Tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so it\rquote s all friends together. And,\rquote  Harry went on bitterly, drawing up a chair, \lquote 
I can\rquote t see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay. If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape, it\rquote ll be a choice between staying and teaching, or a nice few years in Azkaban \endash  and that\rquote s if they\rquote 
re lucky. I reckon they\rquote ll stay to try and protect the students.\rquote 
\par Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his hands, and ladled out soup into pristine bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so.
\par \lquote Thanks, Kreacher,\rquote  said Harry, flipping over the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
so as not to have to look at Snape\rquote s face. \lquote Well, at least we know exactly where Snape is, now.\rquote 
\par He began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreacher\rquote s cooking had improved dramatically ever since he had been given Regulus\rquote s locket: today\rquote s French onion was as good as Harry had ever tasted.
\par \lquote There are still a load of Death Eaters watching the house,\rquote  he told Ron as he ate, \lquote more than usual. It\rquote s like they\rquote re hoping we\rquote ll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hogwarts Express.
\rquote 
\par Ron glanced at his watch.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago. Weird, not being on it, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par In his mind\rquote s eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and Ron had once followed it by air, shimmering between fields and hills, a rippling scarlet caterpillar. He was sure Ginny, Neville and
 Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wondering where he, Ron and Hermione were, or debating how best to undermine Snape\rquote s new regime.
\par \lquote They nearly saw me coming back in, just now,\rquote  Harry said. \lquote I landed badly on the top step, and the Cloak slipped.\rquote 
\par \lquote I do that every time. Oh, here she is,\rquote  Ron added, craning round in his seat to watch Hermione re-entering the kitchen. \lquote And what in the name of Merlin\rquote s most baggy Y-fronts was that about?\rquote 
\par \lquote I remembered this,\rquote  Hermione panted.
\par She was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now low\-
ered to the floor before seizing her small, beaded bag from the kitchen dresser. Opening it, she proceeded to force the painting inside, and despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit inside the tiny b
ag, within a few seconds it had vanished, like so much else, into the bag\rquote s capacious depths.
\par \lquote Phineas Nigellus,\rquote  Hermione explained as she threw the bag on to the kitchen table with the usual sonorous, clanking crash.
\par \lquote Sorry?\rquote  said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to flit between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the Headmaster\rquote 
s office at Hogwarts: the circular tower-top room where Snape was no doubt sitting right now, in triumphant possession of Dumbledore\rquote 
s collection of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor.
\par \lquote Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him,\rquote  Hermione explained to Ron as she resumed her seat. \lquote But let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good thinking!\rquote  said Ron, looking impressed.
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote  smiled Hermione, pulling her soup towards her. \lquote So, Harry, what else happened today?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nothing,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Watched the Ministry entrance for seven hours. No sign of her. Saw your dad, though, Ron. He looks fine.\rquote 
\par Ron nodded his appreciation of this news. They had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try to communicate with Mr Weasley while he walked in and out of the Ministry, because he was always surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, how\-
ever, reassuring to catch these glimpses of him, even if he did look very strained and anxious.
\par \lquote Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work,\rquote  Ron said. \lquote That\rquote s why we haven\rquote t seen Umbridge, she\rquote d never walk, she\rquote d think she\rquote s too important.\rquote 
\par \lquote And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?\rquote  Hermione asked.
\par \lquote Oh, yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?\rquote  Hermione asked, her soup spoon suspended in mid-air.
\par \lquote Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.\rquote 
\par \lquote But you never told us that!\rquote 
\par Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled towards her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen.
\par \lquote There\rquote s nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing!\rquote  she said, flipping feverishly through the pages.
\par \lquote Well, does it really matter?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron, it }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 all }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 matters! If we\rquote

t even bothering to tell us \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You do realise, don\rquote t you, that there\rquote s probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the Ministry of \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I think we should do it tomorrow,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Hermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little over his soup.
\par \lquote Tomorrow?\rquote  repeated Hermione. \lquote You aren\rquote t serious, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote I am,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I don\rquote t think we\rquote 
re going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the further away that locket could be. There\rquote s already a good chance Umbridge has chuc
ked it away; the thing doesn\rquote t open.\rquote 
\par \lquote Unless,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote she\rquote s found a way of opening it and she\rquote s now possessed.\rquote 
\par \lquote Wouldn\rquote t make any difference to her, she was so evil in the first place,\rquote  Harry shrugged.
\par Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought.
\par \lquote We know everything important,\rquote  Harry went on, addressing Hermione. \lquote We know they\rquote 
ve stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry. We know only the most senior Ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to the Floo Network now, because Ron heard those two Unspeakables complaining about it. And we know roughly where Umbridge
\rquote s office is, because of what you heard that bearded bloke saying to his mate \endash \rquote

Hermione recited immediately.

\par \lquote But we haven\rquote t got any!\rquote 
\par \lquote If the plan works, we will have,\rquote  Harry continued calmly.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know, Harry, I don\rquote t know ... there are an awful lot of things that could go wrong, so much relies on chance ...\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote ll be true even if we spend another three months prepar\-ing,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote It\rquote s time to act.\rquote 
\par He could tell from Ron and Hermione\rquote s faces that they were scared; he was not particularly confident himself, and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation.
\par They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the Invisibility Cloak and spy on the official entrance to the M
inistry, which Ron, thanks to Mr Weasley, had known since childhood. They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in, eavesdropped on their conversations and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied upon to appear, alone, at the same 
time every day. Occasionally, there had been a chance to sneak a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Daily Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
out of somebody\rquote s briefcase. Slowly, they had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of Hermione.
\par \lquote All right,\rquote  said Ron slowly, \lquote let\rquote s say we go for it tomorrow ... I think it should just be me and Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, don\rquote t start that again!\rquote  sighed Hermione. \lquote I thought we\rquote d settled this.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is different, Hermione.\rquote  Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\par \lquote And you\rquote re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at The Burrow! If anyone shouldn\rquote t go, it\rquote s Harry, he\rquote s got a ten thousand Galleon price on his head \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Fine, I\rquote ll stay here,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Let me know if you ever defeat Voldemort, won\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par As Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the scar on Harry\rquote s forehead. His hand jumped to it: he saw Hermione\rquote s eyes narrow, and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing his hair out of his eyes.
\par \lquote Well, if all three of us go, we\rquote ll have to Disapparate separately,\rquote  Ron was saying. \lquote We can\rquote t all fit under the Cloak any more.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s scar was becoming more and more painful. He stood up. At once, Kreacher hurried forwards.
\par \lquote Master has not finished his soup, would Master prefer the savoury stew, or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial?\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks, Kreacher, but I\rquote ll be back in a minute \endash  er \endash  bathroom.\rquote 
\par Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing, where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again. Grunting with pain, he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the
 form of open-mouthed serpents and closed his eyes ...
\par He was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on either side of him had high, timbered gables; they looked like ginger\-bread houses.
\par He approached one of them, then saw the whiteness of his own long-fingered hand against the door. He knocked. He felt a mounting excitement ...
\par The door opened: a laughing woman stood there. Her face fell as she looked into Harry\rquote s face, humour gone, terror replacing it ...
\par \lquote Gregorovitch?\rquote  said a high, cold voice.
\par She shook her head: she was trying to close the door. A white hand held it steady, prevented her shutting him out ...
\par \lquote I want Gregorovitch.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Er wohnt hier nicht mehr!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 she cried, shaking her head. \lquote 
He no live here! He no live here! I know him not!\rquote 
\par Abandoning the attempt to close the door, she began to back away down the dark hall, and Harry followed, gliding towards her, and his long-fingered hand had drawn his wand.
\par \lquote Where is he?\rquote

\par He raised the wand. She screamed. Two young children came running into the hall. She tried to shield them with her arms. There was a flash of green light \endash

\par He opened his eyes; he had sunk to the floor. Hermione was pounding on the door again.
\par \lquote Harry, open up!\rquote 
\par H
e had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and unbolted the door; Hermione toppled inside at once, regained her balance and looked around suspiciously. Ron was right behind her, looking unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom
.
\par \lquote What were you doing?\rquote  asked Hermione sternly.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you think I was doing?\rquote  asked Harry, with feeble bravado.
\par \lquote You were yelling your head off!\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Oh yeah ... I must\rquote ve dozed off or \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, please don\rquote t insult our intelligence,\rquote  said Hermione, taking deep breaths. \lquote We know your scar hurt downstairs, and you\rquote re white as a sheet.\rquote 
\par Harry sat down on the edge of the bath.
\par \lquote Fine. I\rquote ve just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. By now he\rquote s probably killed her whole family. And he didn\rquote t need to. It was Cedric all over again, they were just }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Dumbledore \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Forget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else\rquote s. I want to know why he\rquote s after Gregorovitch.\rquote 
\par \lquote Who?\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s a foreign wandmaker,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote He made Krum\rquote s wand and Krum reckons he\rquote s brilliant.\rquote 
\par \lquote But according to you,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote Voldemort\rquote s got Ollivander locked up somewhere. If he\rquote s already got a wandmaker, what does he need another one for?\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better ... or else he thinks Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me, because Ollivander didn\rquote t know.\rquote 
\par Harry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw Ron and Hermione exchanging sceptical looks behind his back.
\par \lquote Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote but }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 made it happen! Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because I know it wasn\rquote t me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both know what really happened!\rquote 
\par They glared at each other: Harry knew that he had not con\-vinced Hermione and that she was marshalling counter\-arguments, against both his theory on his wand and the fact that he was permitting himself to see into Voldemort\rquote 
s mind. To his relief, Ron intervened.
\par \lquote Drop it,\rquote  he advised her. \lquote It\rquote s up to him. And if we\rquote re going to the Ministry tomorrow, don\rquote t you reckon we should go over the plan?\rquote 
\par Reluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let the matter rest, though Harry was quite sure she would attack again at the first opportunity. In the meantime, they returned to the base\-ment kitchen, where Kreacher 
served them all stew and treacle tart.
\par They did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours going over and over their plan until they could recite it, word-perfect, to each other. Harry, who was now sleeping in Sirius\rquote s room, lay in bed with
 his wandlight trained on the old photograph of his father, Sirius, Lupin and Pettigrew, and muttered the plan to himself for another ten minutes. As he extin\-
guished his wand, however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pastilles or the navy 
blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he thought of Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while Voldemort sought him so determinedly.
\par Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste.
\par \lquote You look terrible,\rquote  was Ron\rquote s greeting, as he entered the room to wake Harry.
\par \lquote Not for long,\rquote  said Harry, yawning.
\par They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being served coffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that Harry associated with exam revision.
\par \lquote Robes,\rquote  she said under her breath, acknowledging their pres\-ence with a nervous nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag, \lquote 
Polyjuice Potion ... Invisibility Cloak ... Decoy Detonators ... you should each take a couple just in case ... Puking Pastilles, Nosebleed Nougat, Extendable Ears ...\rquote 
\par They gulped down their breakfast then set off upstairs, Kreacher bowing them out and promising to have a steak and kidney pie ready for them when they returned.
\par \lquote Bless him,\rquote  said Ron fondly, \lquote and when you think I used to fantasise about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall.\rquote 
\par They made their way on to the front step with immense caution: they could see a couple of puffy-eyed Death Eaters watching the house from across the misty square. Hermione Disapparated with Ron first, then came back for Harry.
\par After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry found himself in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place. It was as yet deserted, except 
for a couple of large bins; the first Ministry workers did not usually appear here until at least eight o\rquote clock.
\par \lquote Right then,\rquote  said Hermione, checking her watch. \lquote She ought to be here in about five minutes. When I\rquote ve Stunned her \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hermione, we know,\rquote  said Ron sternly. \lquote And I thought we were supposed to open the door before she got here?\rquote 
\par Hermione squealed.
\par \lquote I nearly forgot! Stand back \endash \rquote 
\par She pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door beside them, which burst open with a crash. 
The dark corridor behind it led, as they knew from their careful scouting trips, into an empty theatre. Hermione pulled the door back towards her, to make it look as though it was still closed.
\par \lquote And now,\rquote  she said, turning back to face the other two in the alleyway, \lquote we put on the Cloak again \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and we wait,\rquote  Ron finished, throwing it over Hermione\rquote s head like baize over a budgerigar and rolling his eyes at Harry.
\par Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 pop }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
and a little Ministry witch with flyaway, grey hair Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in the sudden brightness; the sun had just come out from behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth, however, before Hermione\rquote 
s silent Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over.
\par \lquote Nicely done, Hermione,\rquote  said Ron, emerging from behind a bin beside the theatre door as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak. Together they carried the little witch into the dark passageway that led backstage. Hermione plucked a few h
airs from the witch\rquote s head and added them to a flask of muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded bag. Ron was rummaging through the little witch\rquote s handbag.
\par \lquote She\rquote s Mafalda Hopkirk,\rquote  he said, reading a small card that iden\-tified their victim as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. \lquote You\rquote d better take this, Hermione, and here are the tokens.\rquote 
\par He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M.O.M., which he had taken from the witch\rquote s purse.
\par Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope colour, and within seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed Mafalda\rquote s spectacles and put them on, Harry checked his watch.
\par \lquote We\rquote re running late, Mr Magical Maintenance will be here any second.\rquote 
\par They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and Ron threw the Invisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione remained in view, waiting. Seconds later there was another }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 pop, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 and a small, ferrety-looking wizard appeared before them.
\par \lquote Oh, hello, Mafalda.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hello!\rquote  said Hermione in a quavery voice. \lquote How are you today?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not so good, actually,\rquote  replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly downcast.
\par As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron crept along behind them.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry to hear you\rquote re under the weather,\rquote  said Hermione, talking firmly over the little wizard as he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him reaching the street. \lquote Here, have a sweet.\rquote 

\par \lquote Eh? Oh, no thanks \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I insist!\rquote  said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles in his face. Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one.
\par The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his tongue, the little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the top of his head.
\par \lquote Oh dear!\rquote  she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. \lquote Perhaps you\rquote d better take the day off!\rquote 
\par \lquote No \endash  no!\rquote  He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being unable to walk straight. \lquote I must \endash  today \endash  must go \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But that\rquote s just silly!\rquote  said Hermione, alarmed. \lquote You can\rquote t go to work in this state \endash  I think you ought to go to St Mungo\rquote s and get them to sort you out!\rquote 
\par The wizard had collapsed, heaving, on all fours, still trying to crawl towards the main street.
\par \lquote You simply can\rquote t go to work like this!\rquote  cried Hermione.
\par At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a repulsed Hermione to claw his way back into a standing position, he turned on the spo
t and vanished, leaving nothing behind but the bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went, and some flying chunks of vomit.
\par \lquote Urgh,\rquote  said Hermione, holding up the skirts of her robe to avoid the puddles of sick. \lquote It would have made much less mess to Stun him too.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Ron, emerging from under the Cloak holding the wizard\rquote s bag, \lquote but I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on his job, though, isn\rquote t he? Chuck us
 the hair and the Potion, then.\rquote 
\par Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick wizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag.
\par \lquote Weird he wasn\rquote t wearing them today, wasn\rquote t it, seeing how much he wanted to go? Anyway, I\rquote m Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back.\rquote 
\par \lquote Now wait here,\rquote  Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invisibility Cloak, \lquote and we\rquote ll be back with some hairs for you.\rquote 
\par He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking alone in the sick-splattered alleyway, beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally, Ron and Hermione reappeared.
\par \lquote We don\rquote t know who he is,\rquote  Hermione said, passing Harry several curly, black hairs, \lquote but he\rquote s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he\rquote s pretty tall, you\rquote ll need bigger robes ...\rquote 
\par She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry retired to take the Potion and change.
\par Once the painful transformation was complete, he was more than six
 feet tall and, from what he could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. He also had a beard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the other two.
\par \lquote Blimey, that\rquote s scary,\rquote  said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over him.
\par \lquote Take one of Mafalda\rquote s tokens,\rquote  Hermione told Harry, \lquote and let\rquote s go, it\rquote s nearly nine.\rquote 
\par They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded pavement, there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of steps, one labelled Gentlemen, the other, Ladies.
\par \lquote See you in a moment, then,\rquote  said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down the steps to the ladies\rquote . Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to be an ordinary un
derground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and white.
\par \lquote Morning, Reg!\rquote  called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a cubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. \lquote Blooming pain in the bum, this, eh? Forcing us all to
 get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry Potter?\rquote 
\par The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced chuckle.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  he said, \lquote stupid, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles.
\par To Harry\rquote s lef
t and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched down and peered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet next door. He looked left, and saw Ron blinking at him.
\par \lquote We have to flush ourselves in?\rquote  he whispered.
\par \lquote Looks like it,\rquote  Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep and gravelly.
\par They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clam\-bered into the toilet.
\par He knew at once that he had done the right thing; though he appeared to be standing in water, his shoes, feet and robes remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the chain, and next moment had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out of a fire\-
place into the Ministry of Magic.
\par He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of h
is body than he was accustomed to. The great Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it. Previously, a golden fountain had filled the centre of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls. Now a gigantic statue 
o
f black stone dominated the scene. It was rather frightening, this vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones, looking down at the Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. Engraved in foot-high letters at the 
base of the statue were the words: MAGIC IS MIGHT.
\par Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs: another wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind him.
\par \lquote Out of the way, can\rquote t y\emdash  oh, sorry, Runcorn!\rquote 
\par Clearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. Appar\-ently the man whom Harry was impersonating, Runcorn, was intimidating.
\par \lquote Psst!\rquote  said a voice, and he looked round to see a wispy little witch and the ferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue. Harry hastened to join them.
\par \lquote You got in all right, then?\rquote  Hermione whispered to Harry.
\par \lquote No, he\rquote s still stuck in the bog,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Oh, very funny ... it\rquote s horrible, isn\rquote t it?\rquote  she said to Harry, who was staring up at the statue. \lquote Have you seen what they\rquote re sitting on?\rquote 
\par Harry looked more closely and realised that what he had thought were decoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved humans: hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies, men, women and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, twis
ted and pressed together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards.
\par \lquote Muggles,\rquote  whispered Hermione. \lquote In their rightful place. Come on, let\rquote s get going.\rquote 
\par They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving towards the golden gates at the end of the hall, looking around as surrepti\-
tiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of Dolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a smaller hall, where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as man
y lifts. They had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said, \lquote Cattermole!\rquote 
\par They looked around: Harry\rquote s stomach turned over. One of the Death Eaters who had witnessed Dumbledore\rquote s death was striding towards them. The Ministry workers beside them fell 
silent, their eyes downcast; Harry could feel fear rippling through them. The man\rquote 
s scowling, slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his magnificent, sweeping robes, which were embroidered with much gold thread. Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophantically, \lquote Morning, Yaxley!\rquote  Yaxley ignored them.

\par \lquote I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my office, Cattermole. It\rquote s still raining in there.\rquote 
\par Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene, but nobody spoke.
\par \lquote Raining ... in your office? That\rquote s \endash  that\rquote s not good, is it?\rquote 
\par Ron gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley\rquote s eyes widened.
\par \lquote You think it\rquote s funny, Cattermole, do you?\rquote 
\par A pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and bustled off.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote no, of course \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You realise that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, Cattermole? In fact, I\rquote m quite surprised you\rquote 
re not down there holding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a pure-blood next time.\rquote 
\par Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She coughed feebly and turned away.
\par \lquote I \endash  I \endash \rquote  stammered Ron.
\par \lquote But if }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 my }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 wife were accused of being a Mudblood,\rquote  said Yaxley, 
\lquote \endash  not that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth \endash  and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforce\-ment needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do that job, Cattermole. Do you understand me?
\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  whispered Ron.
\par \lquote Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not com\-pletely dry within an hour your wife\rquote s Blood Status will be in even graver doubt than it is now.\rquote 
\par The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and unpleasant smile to Harry, who was evidently expected to appreciate this t
reatment of Cattermole, Yaxley swept away towards another lift. Harry, Ron and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed them: it was as if they were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upwards.

\par \lquote Say it again, slowly \endash \rquote  said Ron, searching his pockets desper\-ately for a quill, but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt. A disembodied female voice said, \lquote 
Level Four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office and Pest Advisory Bureau,\rquote  and the grilles slid open again, admitting a couple of wizards and sev
eral pale violet paper aeroplanes that fluttered around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift.
\par \lquote Morning Albert,\rquote  said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at Harry. He glanced over at Ron and Hermione as the lift creaked upwards once more; Hermione was now whisp
ering frantic instructions to Ron. The wizard leaned towards Harry, leering, and muttered, \lquote Dirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin Liaison? Nice one, Albert. I\rquote m pretty confident I\rquote ll get his job, now!\rquote 
\par He winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice. The lift stopped; the grilles opened once more.
\par \lquote Level Two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, includ\-ing the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters and Wizengamot Administration Services,\rquote  said the disembodied witch\rquote s voice.
\par Harry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift, followed by the other wizards, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. The moment the golden door had closed Hermione said, very fast, \lquote Actually, Harry, I think I\rquote 
d better go after him, I don\rquote t think he knows what he\rquote s doing and if he gets caught the whole thing \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Level One, Minister for Magic and Support Staff.\rquote 
\par The golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione gasped. Four people stood before them, two of them deep in conversation: a lon
g-haired wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold and a squat, toad-like witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair and clutching a clipboard to her chest.

 She consulted her clipboard. \lquote Ten people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee! Tut, tut ... even here, in the heart of the Ministry!\rquote  She stepped into the lift beside Hermione, as did the two wizards w

\par \lquote Yes, of course,\rquote  said Harry in Runcorn\rquote s deep voice.
\par Harry stepped out of the lift. The golden grilles clanged shut behind him. Glancing over his shoulder, Harry saw Hermione\rquote s anxious face sinking back out of sight, a tall wizard on either side of her, Umbridge\rquote 
s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder.
\par \lquote What brings you up here, Runcorn?\rquote 
 asked the new Minister for Magic. His long, black hair and beard were streaked with silver, and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes, putting Harry in mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock.
\par \lquote Needed a quick word with,\rquote  Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, \lquote Arthur Weasley. Someone said he was up on Level One.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  said Pius Thicknesse. \lquote Has he been caught having contact with an Undesirable?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, his throat dry. \lquote No, nothing like that.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, well. It\rquote s only a matter of time,\rquote  said Thicknesse. \lquote If you ask me, the blood traitors are as bad as the Mudbloods. Good day, Runcorn.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good day, Minister.\rquote 
\par Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. The moment th
e Minister had passed out of sight, Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out from under his heavy, black cloak, threw it over himself and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction. Runcorn was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure 
his big feet were hidden.
\par Panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with the owner\rquote 
s name and occupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force themselves upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with Ron and Hermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish. 
They had concentrated all their efforts on getting inside without being detected: they had not given a moment\rquote 
s thought to what they would do if they were forced to separate. Now Hermione was stuck in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours: Ron was struggling to do magic that Harry was sure was beyond him, a woman\rquote 
s liberty possibly depending on the outcome, and he, Harry, was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift.
\par He stopped walking, leaned against a wall and tried to decide what to do. The silence pressed upon him: there was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here; the purple-carpeted corridors were as hushed as though the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Muffliato }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 charm had been cast over the place.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Her office must be up here, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Harry thought.
\par It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewellery in her office, but on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. He therefore set off along the corridor again, passing nobody bu
t a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that floated in front of him, scribbling on a trail of parchment.
\par Now paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned a corner. Halfway along the next corridor he emerged into a wide, o
pen space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school desks, though much more highly polished and free from graffiti. Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was quite mesmerising. They were all waving and twid\-
dling t
heir wands in unison, and squares of coloured paper were flying in every direction like little pink kites. After a few seconds, Harry realised that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all formed the same pattern, and after a few more se
conds he realised that what he was watching was the creation of pamph\-lets, that the paper squares were pages, which when assembled, folded and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard.
\par Harry crept closer, although the workers 
were so intent on what they were doing that he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility Cloak. Its pink cover was emblazoned with a go
lden title:

Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose, with a simpering face in the middle of its petals, being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl. There was no author\rquote 
s name upon the pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it. Then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said, still waving and twirling her wand, \lquote 
Will the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all day, does anyone know?\rquote

 said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of his pages slipped and fell to the floor.
\par \lquote What, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?\rquote 
\par The witch glanced towards the shining mahogany door 
facing the space full of pamphlet-makers; Harry looked too, and rage reared in him like a snake. Where there might have been a peephole on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue iris had been set into the wood; an eye that was shocking
ly familiar to anybody who had known Alastor Moody.
\par For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there: he even forgot that he was invisible. He strode straight over to the door to examine the eye. It was not moving: it gazed blindly upwards, frozen. The plaque beneath it read:

Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: though they were intent upon their work, he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of them. He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object wi
th little waving legs, and a rubber-bulbed horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the Cloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator on the ground.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
It scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of him. A few moments later, during whic
h Harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob, there came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid, black smoke billowed from a corner. The young witch in the front row shrieked: pink pages flew every\-
where as she and her fellows jumped up, looking around for the source of the commotion. Harry turned the doorknob, stepped into Umbridge\rquote s office and closed the door behind him.
\par He felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like Umbridge\rquote s office at Hogwarts: lace draperies, doilies and dried flowers
 covered every available surface. The walls bore the same ornamental plates, each featuring a highly coloured, beribboned kitten, gambolling and frisking with sickening cuteness. The desk was covered with a flouncy, flowered cloth. Behind Mad-Eye\rquote 
s eye, a 
telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy on the workers on the other side of the door. Harry took a look through it and saw that they were all still gathered round the Decoy Detonator. He wrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind,
 pulled the magical eyeball out of it and placed it in his pocket. Then he turned to face the room again, raised his wand and murmured, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Accio locket.\rquote }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par Nothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no doubt Umbridge knew all about protective charms and spells. He there\-
fore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open the drawers. He saw quills and notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted paper-clips that coiled snake-like from their drawer and had to be beaten back; a fussy little lace box full of spare hai
r-bows and clips; but no sign of a locket.
\par There was a filing cabinet behind the desk: Harry set to search\-ing it. Like Filch\rquote s filing cabinets at Hogwarts, it was full of folders, each labelled with a name. It was not until Harry reached the bottommost dr
awer that he saw something to distract him from his search: Mr Weasley\rquote s file.
\par He pulled it out and opened it.

\rquote s folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew who that was, and sure enough, as he straightened up and glanced arou
nd the office for fresh hiding places, he saw a poster of himself on the wall, with the words UNDESIRABLE NO. 1 emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note was stuck to it, with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read it and sa
w that Umbridge had written }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote To be punished\rquote .}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried flowers, but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there. He gave the office one last sweeping look, and his h
eart skipped a beat. Dumbledore was staring at him from a small, rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk.
\par Harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up, but realised the moment he touched it that it was not a mirror at all. Dumble
dore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book. Harry had not immediately noticed the curly, green writing across his hat: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 by Rita Skeeter, bestselling author of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?
\par Harry opened the book at random and saw a full-page photo\-graph of two teenage boys, both laughing immoderately with their arms around each other\rquote s shoulders. Dumbledore, now with elbow-length hair, had grow
n a tiny, wispy beard that recalled the one on Krum\rquote 
s chin that had so annoyed Ron. The boy who roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild look about him. His golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders. Harry wondered whether it was a
 young Doge, but before he could check the caption, the door of the office opened.
\par If
 Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered, Harry would not have had time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over himself. As it was, he thought Thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement, because for a moment or two he remained 
q
uite still, staring curiously at the place where Harry had just vanished. Perhaps deciding that all he had seen was Dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the book, for Harry had hastily replaced it upon the shelf, Thicknesse finally walked to the
 desk and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot. It sprang out and began scribbling a note to Umbridge. Very slowly, hardly daring to breathe, Harry backed out of the office into the open area beyond.
\par The pamphlet-makers were still clustered round the remains of the Decoy Detonator, which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked. Harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, \lquote I bet it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, they
\rquote re so careless, remember that poisonous duck?\rquote 
\par Speeding back towards the lifts, Harry reviewed his options. It had never been likely that the locket was here at the Ministry, and there was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of Umbridge while she was sitting in a crowded court. Their priority no
w had to be to leave the Ministry before they were exposed, and try again another day. The first thing to do was to find Ron, and then they could work out a way of extracting Hermione from the courtroom.
\par The lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak as it started its descent. To his enormous relief, when it rattled to a halt at Level Two a soaking wet and wild-eyed Ron got in.
\par \lquote M \endash  morning,\rquote  he stammered to Harry, as the lift set off again.
\par \lquote Ron, it\rquote s me, Harry!\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like \endash  why isn\rquote t Hermione with you?\rquote 
\par \lquote She had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge, she couldn\rquote t refuse, and \endash \rquote 
\par But before Harry could finish the lift had stopped again: the doors opened and Mr Weasley walked inside, talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased so high it resembled an anthill.
\par \lquote ... I quite understand what you\rquote re saying, Wakanda, but I\rquote m afraid I cannot be party to \endash \rquote 
\par Mr Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry. It was very strange to have Mr Weasley glare at him with that much dislike. The lift doors closed and the four of them trundled downwards once more.
\par \lquote Oh, hello, Reg,\rquote  said Mr Weasley, looking round at the sound of steady dripping from Ron\rquote s robes. \lquote Isn\rquote t your wife in for questioning today? Er \endash  what\rquote s happened to you? Why are you so wet?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yaxley\rquote s office is raining,\rquote  said Ron. He addressed Mr Weasley\rquote s shoulder, and Harry felt sure he was scared that his father might recognise him if they looked directly into each other\rquote s eyes. \lquote I couldn\rquote

\par \lquote Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,\rquote  said Mr Weasley. \lquote Did you try }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 meteolojinx recanto? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

t. Thanks, D\emdash  I mean, thanks, Arthur.\rquote 
\par The lift doors opened; the old witch with the anthill hair left and Ron darted past her out of sight. Harry made to follow him, but found his path blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift, his nose buried in some papers he was reading.
\par Not until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realise he was in a lift with his father. He glanced up, saw Mr Weasley, turned radish red, and left the lift the moment the doors opened again. For the second time, Ha
rry tried to get out, but this time found his way blocked by Mr Weasley\rquote s arm.
\par \lquote One moment, Runcorn.\rquote 
\par The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr Weasley said, \lquote I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell.\rquote 
\par Harry had the impression that Mr Weasley\rquote s anger was no less because of the brush with Percy. He decided his best chance was to act stupid.
\par \lquote Sorry?\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t pretend, Runcorn,\rquote  said Mr Weasley fiercely. \lquote You tracked down the wizard who faked his family tree, didn\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  so what if I did?\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote So, Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,\rquote  said Mr Weasley quietly, as the lift sank ever lower. \lquote And if he survives Azkaban, you\rquote ll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, his sons and his friends \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote Arthur,\rquote  Harry interrupted, \lquote you know you\rquote re being tracked, don\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Is that a threat, Runcorn?\rquote  said Mr Weasley loudly.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote it\rquote s a fact! They\rquote re watching your every move \endash \rquote 
\par The lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. Mr Weasley gave Harry a scathing look and swept from the lift. Harry stood there, shaken. He wished he was impersonating somebody other than Runcorn ... the lift doors clanged shut.
\par Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on. He would try to extricate Hermione on his own while Ron was deal\-
ing with the raining office. When the doors opened, he stepped out into a torchlit stone passageway quite different from the wood-p
anelled and carpeted corridors above. As the lift rattled away again, Harry shivered slightly, looking towards the distant black door that marked the entrance to the Department of Mysteries.
\par He set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway h
e remembered on the left-hand side, which opened on to the flight of stairs down to the court chambers. His mind grappled with possibilities as he crept down them: he still had a couple of Decoy Detonators, but perhaps it would be better to simply knock o
n the courtroom door, enter as Runcorn and ask for a quick word with Mafalda? Of course, he did not know whether Runcorn was sufficiently important to get away with this, and even if he managed it, Hermione\rquote 
s non-reappearance might trigger a search before they were clear of the Ministry ...
\par Lost in thought, he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over him as if he were descending into fog. It was becoming colder and colder with every step he took: a cold that reached right down 
into his throat and tore at his lungs. And then he felt that stealing sense of despair, of hopelessness, filling him, expanding inside him ...
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Dementors, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 he thought.
\par And as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right, he saw a dreadful scene.
 The dark passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall, black hooded figures, their faces completely hidden, their ragged breathing the only sound in the place. The petrified Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard
 wooden benches. Most of them were hiding their faces in their hands, perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield themselves from the Dementors\rquote 
 greedy mouths. Some were accompanied by families, others sat alone. The Dementors were gliding up and down in front of them, and the cold, and the hopelessness, and the despair of the place laid themselves upon Harry like a curse ...
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Fight it, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
he told himself, but he knew that he could not conjure a Patronus here without revealing himself instantly. So he moved forw
ards, as silently as he could, and with every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to think of Hermione and of Ron, who needed him.
\par Moving through the towering, black figures was terrifying: the eyeless faces hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed, and he felt sure that they sensed him, sensed, perhaps, a human presence that still had some hope, some resilience ...
\par And then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one of the dungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it.
\par \lquote No, no, I\rquote m half-blood, I\rquote m half-blood, I tell you! My father was a wizard, he was, look him up, Arkie Alderton, he\rquote s a well-known broomstick designer, look him up, I tell you \endash  get your hands of
f me, get your hands off \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote This is your final warning,\rquote  said Umbridge\rquote s soft voice, magic\-ally magnified so that it sounded clearly over the man\rquote s desperate screams. \lquote If you struggle, you will be subjected to the Dementor\rquote s kiss.\rquote 

\par The man\rquote s screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the corridor.
\par \lquote Take him away,\rquote  said Umbridge.
\par Two Dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, their rotting, scabbed hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be fainting. They glided away down the 
corridor with him and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him from sight.
\par \lquote Next \endash  Mary Cattermole,\rquote  called Umbridge.
\par A small woman stood up; she was trembling from head to foot.
\par Her dark hair was smoothed back into a bun and she wore long, plain robes. Her face was completely bloodless. As she passed the Dementors, Harry saw her shudder.
\par He did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because he hated the sight of her walking alone into the dungeon: as the door began to swing closed, he slipped into the courtroom behind her.
\par It was not the same room in which he had once been interro\-gated for improper use of magic. This one was much smaller, though the ceiling was quite as high; it gave the claustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well.
\par There were more Dementors in here, casting their freezing aura over the place; they stood like faceless sentinels in the corners furthest from the high, raised platform. Here, behind a balustrade, sat Umbridge, with Yaxley on one side of her, 
and Hermione, quite as white-faced as Mrs Cattermole, on the other. At the foot of the platform a bright silver, long-haired cat prowled up and down, up and down, and Harry realised that it was there to protect the prosecutors from the despair that emanat
ed from the Dementors: that was for the accused to feel, not the accusers.
\par \lquote Sit down,\rquote  said Umbridge in her soft, silky voice.
\par Mrs Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the raised platform. The moment she had sat down, chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her there.
\par \lquote You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?\rquote  asked Umbridge.
\par Mrs Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod.
\par \lquote Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance Department?\rquote 
\par Mrs Cattermole burst into tears.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!\rquote 
\par Umbridge ignored her.
\par \lquote Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred Cattermole?\rquote 
\par Mrs Cattermole sobbed harder than ever.
\par \lquote They\rquote re frightened, they think I might not come home \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Spare us,\rquote  spat Yaxley. The brats of Mudbloods do not stir our sympathies.\rquote 
\par Mrs Cattermole\rquote s sobs masked Harry\rquote s footsteps as he made his way carefully towards the steps that led up to the raised plat\-form. The moment he had passed the place where the Patronus cat p
atrolled he felt the change in temperature: it was warm and comfortable here. The Patronus, he was sure, was Umbridge\rquote 
s, and it glowed brightly because she was so happy here, in her element, upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write. Slowly and ve
ry carefully, he edged his way along the platform behind Umbridge, Yaxley and Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter. He was worried about making Hermione jump. He thought of casting the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

ord might cause Hermione alarm. Then Umbridge raised her voice to address Mrs Cattermole, and Harry seized his chance.
\par \lquote I\rquote m behind you,\rquote  he whispered into Hermione\rquote s ear.
\par As he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly over\-turned the bottle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview, but both Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating upon Mrs Cattermole, and this went unnoticed.
\par \lquote A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs Cattermole,\rquote  Umbridge was saying. \lquote Eight and three-quarter inches, cherry, unicorn hair core. Do you recognise that description?\rquote 
\par Mrs Cattermole nodded, mopping her eyes on her sleeve.
\par \lquote Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand?\rquote 
\par \lquote T \endash  took?\rquote  sobbed Mrs Cattermole. \lquote I didn\rquote t t \endash  take it from anybody. I b \endash  bought it when I was eleven years old. It \endash  it \endash  it \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par She cried harder than ever.
\par Umbridge laughed a soft, girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her. She leaned forwards over the barrier, the better to observe her victim, and something gold swung forwards too, and dangled over the void: the locket.
\par Hermione had seen it, she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge and Yaxley, still intent upon their prey, were deaf to everything else.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Umbridge, \lquote no, I don\rquote t think so, Mrs Cattermole. Wands only choose witches or wizards. You are not a witch. I have your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here \endash  Mafalda, pass them to me.
\rquote 
\par Umbridge held out a small hand: she looked so toad-like at that moment that Harry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers. Hermione\rquote 
s hands were shaking with shock. She fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her, finally withdrawing a wad of parchment with Mrs Cattermole\rquote s name on it.
\par \lquote That\rquote s \endash  that\rquote s pretty, Dolores,\rquote  she said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds of Umbridge\rquote s blouse.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  snapped Umbridge, glancing down. \lquote Oh yes \endash  an old family heirloom,\rquote  she said, patting the locket lying on her large bosom. \lquote The \'93S\'94
 stands for Selwyn ... I am related to the Selwyns ... indeed, there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not related ... a pity,\rquote  she continued, in a louder voice, flicking through Mrs Cattermole\rquote s questionnaire, \lquote that th
e same cannot be said for you. Parents\rquote  professions: greengrocers.\rquote 
\par Yaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down, and the Dementors stood waiting in the corners.
\par It was Umbridge\rquote s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry\rquote 
s brain and obliterated his sense of caution; that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bolster her own pure-blood credentials. He raised his wand, not even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility Cl
oak, and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Stupefy!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par There was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge of the balustrade: Mrs Cattermole\rquote s papers slid off her lap on to the floor and, down below, the prowling silver cat vanished. Ice-cold air hit them l
ike an oncoming wind: Yaxley, confused, looked around for the source of the trouble and saw Harry\rquote s disembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried to draw his own wand, but too late.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Stupefy!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\par \lquote Harry, Mrs Cattermole!\rquote 
\par Harry whirled round, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down below, the Dementors had moved out of their corners; they were gliding towards the woman ch
ained to the chair: whether because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in control, they seemed to have aban\-
doned restraint. Mrs Cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy, scabbed hand grasped her chin and forced her face back.

of them accused Muggle-borns, he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention. He had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them.
\par \lquote Reg!\rquote  screamed Mrs Cattermole, and she threw herself into Ron\rquote s arms. \lquote Runcorn let me out, he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley, and he\rquote s told all of us to leave the country, I think we\rquote 
d better do it, Reg, I really do. Let\rquote s hurry home and fetch the children and \endash  why are you so wet?\rquote 
\par \lquote Water,\rquote  muttered Ron, disengaging himself. \lquote Harry, they know there are intruders inside the Ministry, something about a hole in Umbridge\rquote s office door, I reckon we\rquote ve got five minutes if that \endash \rquote

as she turned a horror-struck face to Harry.
\par \lquote Harry, if we\rquote re trapped here \endash !\rquote 
\par \lquote We won\rquote t be if we move fast,\rquote  said Harry. He addressed the silent group behind them, who were all gawping at him.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s got wands?\rquote 
\par About half of them raised their hands.
\par \lquote OK, all of you who haven\rquote t got wands need to attach yourself to somebody who has. We\rquote ll need to be fast \endash  before they stop us. Come on.\rquote 
\par They managed to cram themselves into two lifts. Harry\rquote s Patronus stood sentinel before the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise.
\par \lquote Level Eight,\rquote  said the witch\rquote s cool voice, \lquote Atrium.\rquote 
\par Harry knew at once that they were in trouble. The Atrium was full of people moving from fireplace to fireplace, sealing them off.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  squeaked Hermione. \lquote What are we going to \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote STOP!\rquote  Harry thundered, and the powerful voice of Runcorn echoed through the Atrium: the wizards sealing the fireplaces froze. \lquote Follow me,\rquote 
 he whispered to the group of terrified Muggle-borns, who moved forwards in a huddle, shepherded by Ron and Hermione.
\par \lquote What\rquote s up, Albert?\rquote  said the same balding wizard who had followed Harry out of the fireplace earlier. He looked nervous.
\par \lquote This lot need to leave before you seal the exits,\rquote  said Harry, with all the authority he could muster.
\par The group of wizards in front of him looked at one another.
\par \lquote We\rquote ve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone \endash \rquote

Would you like me to have your family tree examined, like I had Dirk Cresswell\rquote s?\rquote 
\par \lquote Sorry!\rquote  gasped the balding wizard, backing away. \lquote I didn\rquote t mean nothing, Albert, but I thought ... I thought they were in for questioning and ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Their blood is pure,\rquote  said Harry, and his deep voice echoed impressively through the hall. \lquote Purer than many of yours, I dare say. Off you go,\rquote  he boomed to the
 Muggle-borns, who scurried forwards into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs. The Ministry wizards hung back, some looking confused, others scared and resentful. Then \endash 
\par \lquote Mary!\rquote 
\par Mrs Cattermole looked over her shoulder. The real Reg Cattermole, no longer vomiting, but pale and wan, had just come running out of a lift.
\par \lquote R \endash  Reg?\rquote 
\par She looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly.
\par The balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from one Reg Cattermole to the other.
\par \lquote Hey \endash  what\rquote s going on? What is this?\rquote 
\par \lquote Seal the exit! SEAL IT!\rquote 
\par Yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running towards the group beside the fireplaces into which all of the Muggle-borns but Mrs Cattermole had now vanished. As the balding wizard lifted his wand, Harry raised a
n enormous fist and punched him, sending him flying through the air.
\par \lquote He\rquote s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley!\rquote  Harry shouted.
\par The balding wizard\rquote s colleagues set up an uproar, under cover of which Ron grabbed Mrs Cattermole, pulled her into the stil
l open fireplace and disappeared. Confused, Yaxley looked from Harry to the punched wizard, while the real Reg Cattermole screamed, \lquote My wife! Who was that with my wife? What\rquote s going on?\rquote 
\par Harry saw Yaxley\rquote s head turn, saw an inkling of the truth dawn in that brutish face.
\par \lquote Come on!\rquote  Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as Yaxley\rquote s curse sailed over Harry\rquote 
s head. They spun for a few seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a cubicle. Harry flung open the door; Ron was standing there beside the sinks, still wrestling with Mrs Cattermole.
\par \lquote Reg, I don\rquote t understand \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Let go, I\rquote m not your husband, you\rquote ve got to go home!\rquote 
\par There was a noise in the cubicle behind them; Harry looked around; Yaxley had just appeared.
\par \lquote LET\rquote S GO!\rquote  Harry yelled. He seized Hermione by the hand and Ron by the arm and turned on the spot.
\par Darkness engulfed them along with the sensation of compress\-ing bands, but something was wrong ... Hermione\rquote s hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip ...
\par He wondered whether he was going to suffocate, he could not breathe or see and the only solid things in the world were Ron\rquote s arm and Hermione\rquote s fingers, which were slowly slipping away ...
\par And then he saw the door of number twelve, Grimmauld Place, with its serpent doorknocker, but before he could draw breath there was a scream and a flash of purple light; Hermione\rquote s hand was suddenly vice-like upon his and everythi
ng went dark again.

Harry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and green; he had no idea what had happened, he only knew that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs. Struggling to draw breath into lungs th
at felt flattened, he blinked and realised that the gaudy glare was sunlight streaming through a canopy of leaves far above him. Then an object twitched close to his face. He pushed himself on to his hands and knees, ready to face some small, fierce creat
ure, but saw that the object was Ron\rquote s foot. Looking around, Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a forest floor, apparently alone.

s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a moment, even though he knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leapt at the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrid\rquote 
s hut. However, in the few moments it took for Ron to give a low groan and Harry to start crawling towards him, he realised that this was not the Forbidden Forest: the trees looked younger, they were more widely spaced, the ground clearer.
\par He met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at Ron\rquote s head. The moment his eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Harry\rquote s mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron\rquote 
s left side and his face stood out, greyish white, against the leaf-strewn earth. The Polyjuice Potion was wearing off now: Ron was halfway between Cattermole and himself in appearance, his hair turning redder and redder as his 
face drained of the little colour it had left.
\par \lquote What\rquote s happened to him?\rquote 
\par \lquote Splinched,\rquote  said Hermione, her fingers already busy at Ron\rquote s sleeve, where the blood was wettest and darkest.
\par Harry watched, horrified, as she tore open Ron\rquote s shirt. He had always thought of Splinching as something comical, but this ... his insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron\rquote 
s upper arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly away as though by a knife.
\par \lquote Harry, quickly, in my bag, there\rquote s a small bottle labelled }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Essence of Dittany \endash \rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Bag \endash  right \endash \rquote 
\par Harry sped to the place where Hermione had landed, seized the tiny beaded bag and thrust his hand inside it. At once, object after object began presenting itself to his touch: he felt the leather spines of books, woolly sleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes 
\endash

\par A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught it and hastened back to Hermione and Ron, whose eyes were now half-closed, strips of white eyeball all that was visible between his lids.
\par \lquote He\rquote s fainted,\rquote  said Hermione, who was also rather pale; she no longer looked like Mafalda, though her hair was still grey in places. \lquote Unstopper it for me, Harry, my hands are shaking.\rquote 
\par Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, Hermione took it and poured three drops of the potion on the bleeding wound. Greenis
h smoke billowed upwards and when it had cleared, Harry saw that the bleeding had stopped. The wound now looked several days old; new skin stretched over what had just been open flesh.
\par \lquote Wow,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote It\rquote s all I feel safe doing,\rquote  said Hermione shakily. \lquote There are spells that would put him completely right, but I daren\rquote t try in case I do them wrong and cause more damage ... he\rquote s lost so much blood already ...
\rquote 
\par \lquote How did he get hurt? I mean,\rquote  Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, to make sense of whatever had just taken place, \lquote why are we here? I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place?\rquote 
\par Hermione took a deep breath. She looked close to tears.
\par \lquote Harry, I don\rquote t think we\rquote re going to be able to go back there.\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote As we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me, and I couldn\rquote t get rid of him, he was too strong, and he was still holding on when we arrived at Grimmauld Place, and then \endash 
 well, I think he must have seen the door, and thought we were stopping there, so he slackened his grip and I managed to shake him off and I brought us here instead!\rquote 
\par \lquote But then, where\rquote s he? Hang on ... you don\rquote t mean he\rquote s at Grimmauld Place? He can\rquote t get in there?\rquote 
\par Her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded.
\par \lquote Harry, I think he can. I \endash  I forced him to let go with a Revulsion Jinx, but I\rquote d already taken him inside the Fidelius Charm\rquote s protection. Since Dumbledore died, we\rquote re Secret Keepers, so I\rquote 
ve given him the secret, haven\rquote t I?\rquote 
\par There was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was a serious blow. I
f Yaxley could now get inside the house, there was no way that they could return. Even now, he could be bringing other Death Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and oppressive though the house was, it had been their one safe refuge: even, now that Kreac
her was so much happier and friendlier, a kind of home. With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food, Harry imagined the house-elf busying himself over the steak and kidney pie that Harry, Ron and Hermione would never eat.
\par \lquote Harry, I\rquote m sorry, I\rquote m so sorry!\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be stupid, it wasn\rquote t your fault! If anything, it was mine ...\rquote 
\par Harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad-Eye\rquote s eye. Hermione recoiled, looking horrified.
\par \lquote Umbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on people. I couldn\rquote t leave it there ... but that\rquote s how they knew there were intruders.\rquote 
\par Before Hermione could answer, Ron groaned and opened his eyes. He was still grey and his face glistened with sweat.
\par \lquote How d\rquote you feel?\rquote  Hermione whispered.
\par \lquote Lousy,\rquote  croaked Ron, wincing as he felt his injured arm. \lquote Where are we?\rquote 
\par \lquote In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote I wanted somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this was \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  the first place you thought of,\rquote  Harry finished for her, glancing around at the apparent
ly deserted glade. He could not help remembering what had happened the last time they had Apparated to the first place Hermione had thought of; how Death Eaters had found them within minutes. Had it been Legilimency? Did Voldemort or his henchmen know, ev
en now, where Hermione had taken them?
\par \lquote D\rquote you reckon we should move on?\rquote  Ron asked Harry, and Harry could tell, by the look on Ron\rquote s face, that he was thinking the same...
\par \lquote I dunno.\rquote 
\par Ron still looked pale and clammy. He had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he was too weak to do so. The prospect of moving him was daunting.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s stay here for now,\rquote  Harry said.
\par Looking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet.
\par \lquote Where are you going?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote If we\rquote re staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place,\rquote  she replied, and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron, murmuring incanta\-
tions as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the surround\-ing air: it was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing.

\par \lquote Tent?\rquote 
\par \lquote In the bag!\rquote 
\par \lquote In the ... of course,\rquote  said Harry.
\par He did not bother t
o grope inside it this time, but used another Summoning Charm. The tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas, rope and poles. Harry recognised it, partly because of the smell of cats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the Quidditch Wor
ld Cup.
\par \lquote I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry?\rquote  he asked, starting to disentangle the tent pegs.
\par \lquote Apparently he didn\rquote t want it back, his lumbago\rquote s so bad,\rquote  said Hermione, now performing complicated figure of eight move\-ments with her wand, \lquote so Ron\rquote s dad said I could borrow it. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37

oared, to land with a final thud at the end of a guy rope.

\par \lquote Don\rquote t say the name!\rquote  Ron cut across her, his voice harsh.
\par Harry and Hermione looked at each other.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry,\rquote  Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them, \lquote but it feels like a \endash  a jinx, or something. Can\rquote t we call him You-Know-Who \endash  please?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore said fear of a name \endash \rquote  began Harry.
\par \lquote In case you hadn\rquote t noticed, mate, calling You-Know-Who by his name didn\rquote t do Dumbledore much good in the end,\rquote  Ron snapped back. \lquote Just \endash  just show You-Know-Who some respect, will you?\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Respect?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Harry repeated, but
 Hermione shot him a warning look; apparently he was not to argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition.
\par Harry and Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron through the entrance of the tent. The interior was exactly as Harry remembered it: a small flat, complete with bathroom and tiny kitchen. He shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron care\-
fully on to the lower berth of a bunk bed. Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter still, and once they had settled him on the mattress, he closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll make some tea,\rquote  said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of her bag and heading towards the kitchen.
\par Harry found the hot drink as welcome as the Firewhisky had been on the night that Mad-Eye had died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest. After a minute or two, Ron broke the silence.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?\rquote 
\par \lquote With any luck, they\rquote ll have got away,\rquote  said Hermione, clutching her hot mug for comfort. \lquote As long as Mr Cattermole had his wits about him, he\rquote ll have transported Mrs Cattermole by Side-Along-Apparition and they\rquote 
ll be fleeing the country right now with their children. That\rquote s what Harry told her to do.\rquote 
\par \lquote Blimey, I hope they escaped,\rquote  said Ron, leaning back on his pillows. The tea seemed to be doing him good; a little of his colour had returned. \lquote I didn\rquote 
t get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all that quick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me when I was him. God, I hope they made it ... if they both end up in Azkaban because of us \'85\rquote 
\par Harry looked over at Hermione and the question he had been about to ask \endash  about whether Mrs Cattermole\rquote s lack of a wand would prevent her Apparating alongside her husband \endash 
 died in his throat. Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in her expression that Harry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing him.
\par \lquote So, have you got it?\rquote  Harry asked her, partly to remind her that he was there.
\par \lquote Got \endash  got what?\rquote  she said, with a little start.
\par \lquote What did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where\rquote s the locket?\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote You got it?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on his pillows. \lquote No one tells me anything! Blimey, you could have mentioned it!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters, weren\rquote t we?\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Here.\rquote 
\par And she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to Ron.
\par It was as large as a chicken\rquote s egg. An ornate letter \lquote S\rquote , inlaid with many small green stones, glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tent\rquote s canvas roof.
\par \lquote There isn\rquote t any chance someone\rquote s destroyed it since Kreacher had it?\rquote  asked Ron hopefully. \lquote I mean, are we sure it\rquote s still a Horcrux?\rquote 
\par \lquote I think so,\rquote  said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking at it closely. \lquote There\rquote d be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed.\rquote 
\par She passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his fingers. The thing looked perfect, pristine. He remembered the mangled remains of the diary, and how the stone in the Horcrux-ring had been cracked open when Dumbledore destroyed it.
\par \lquote I reckon Kreacher\rquote s right,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote We\rquote re going to have to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it.\rquote 
\par Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the little golden doors, hit Harry as he spoke. Even after all their efforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to fling the locket from him. Mastering himself again,
 he tried to prise the locket apart with his fingers, then attempted the charm Hermione had used to open Regulus\rquote 
s bedroom door. Neither worked. He handed the locket back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom did their best, but were no more successful at opening it than he had been.
\par \lquote Can you feel it, though?\rquote  Ron asked in a hushed voice, as he held it tight in his clenched fist.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean?\rquote 
\par Ron passed the Horcrux to Harry. After a moment or two, Harry thought he knew what Ron meant. Was it his own blood pulsing through his veins that he could feel, or was it something beating inside the locket, like a tiny metal heart?
\par \lquote What are we going to do with it?\rquote  Hermione asked.
\par \lquote Keep it safe \rquote til we work out how to destroy it,\rquote  Harry replied, and, little though h
e wanted to, he hung the chain around his own neck, dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes, where it rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given him.
\par \lquote I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,\rquote  he added to Hermione, standing up and stretching. \lquote And we\rquote ll need to think about some food, as well. You stay there,\rquote 
 he added sharply, as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of green.
\par With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set c
arefully upon the table in the tent, Harry and Hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout. However, the Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day, and whether because of the protective enchant\-
ments and Muggle-Repelli
ng Charms Hermione had spread around them, or because people rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood remained deserted apart from occasional birds and squirrels. Evening brought no change; Harry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione at ten
 o\rquote clock, and looked out upon a deserted scene, noting the bats fluttering high above him across the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing.
\par He felt hungry now, and a little light-headed. Hermione had not packed any food in her mag
ical bag, as she had assumed that they would be returning to Grimmauld Place that night, so they had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that Hermione had collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in a billycan. After a couple of mouth
fuls, Ron had pushed his portion away, looking queasy; Harry had only persevered so as not to hurt Hermione\rquote s feelings.
\par The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like crackings of twigs: Harry thought that they were caused by anim
als rather than people, yet he kept his wand held tight at the ready. His insides, already uncomfortable due to their inadequate helping of rubbery mushrooms, tingled with unease.
\par He had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the H
orcrux, but somehow he did not; all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness, of which his wand lit only a tiny part, was worry about what would happen next. It was as though he had been hurtling towards this point for weeks, months, maybe even years
, but now he had come to an abrupt halt, run out of road.
\par There were other Horcruxes out there somewhere, but he did not have the faintest idea where they could be. He did not even know what all of them were. Meanwhile, he was at a loss to know how to destr
oy the only one that they had found, the Horcrux that currently lay against the bare flesh of his chest. Curiously, it had not taken heat from his body, but lay so cold against his skin it might just have emerged from, icy water. From time to time, Harry 
thought, or perhaps imagined, that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside his own.
\par Nameless forebodings crept up on him as he sat there in the dark: he tried to resist them, push them away, yet they came at him relentlessly. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Neither

Ron and Hermione, now talking softly behind him in the tent, could walk away if they wanted to: he could not. And it seemed to Harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion, that the Horcrux against h
is chest was ticking away the time he had left ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Stupid idea, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 he told himself, }{

\par His scar was starting to prickle again. He was afraid that he was making it happen by having these thoughts, and tried to direct them into another channel
. He thought of poor Kreacher, who had expected them home and had received Yaxley instead. Would the elf keep silent or would he tell the Death Eater everything he knew? Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed towards him in the past month, that
 he would be loyal now, but who knew what would happen? What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick images swarmed into Harry\rquote 
s head and he tried to push these away too, for there was nothing he could do for Kreacher: he and Hermione had already decided
 against trying to summon him; what if someone from the Ministry came too? They could not count on elfish Apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken Yaxley to Grimmauld Place on the hem of Hermione\rquote s sleeve.
\par Harry\rquote s scar was burning now. He thought that there was so much they did not know: Lupin had been right about magic they had never encountered or imagined. Why hadn\rquote 
t Dumbledore explained more? Had he thought that there would be time; that he would live for years, for centuries, perhaps, li
ke his friend Nicolas Flamel? If so, he had been wrong ... Snape had seen to that ... Snape, the sleeping snake, who had struck at the top of the Tower ...
\par And Dumbledore had fallen ... fallen ...

\par Harry\rquote s voice was high, clea

\par \lquote Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Gregorovitch. He knows ... he always knows.\rquote 
\par The hanging man\rquote s pupils were wide, dilated with fear, and they seemed to swell, bigger and bigger until their blackness swallowed Harry whole \endash 
\par And now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little Gregorovitch\rquote

s light illuminated him, Harry saw the delight upon his handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backwards out of the window with a crow of laughter.
\par And Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, tunnel-like pupils and Gregorovitch\rquote s face was stricken with terror.

\par She dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking stubborn. Angry, but wishing to avoid a row, Harry ducked back inside.
\par Ron\rquote s still pale face was poking out from the l
ower bunk; Harry climbed into the one above him, lay down and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling. After several moments, Ron spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry to Hermione, huddled in the entrance.
\par \lquote What\rquote s You-Know-Who doing?\rquote 
\par Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then whispered into the darkness.
\par \lquote He found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was torturing him.\rquote 
\par \lquote How\rquote s Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if he\rquote s tied up?\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno ... it\rquote s weird, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par Harry closed his eyes, thinking of all he had seen and heard. The more he recalled, the less sense it made ... Voldemort had said nothing about Harry\rquote 
s wand, nothing about the twin cores, nothing about Gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand to beat Harry\rquote s ...
\par \lquote He wanted something from Gregorovitch,\rquote  Harry said, eyes still closed tight. \lquote He asked him to hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him ... and then ... then ...\rquote 
\par He remembered how he, as Voldemort, had seemed to hurtle through Gregorovitch\rquote s eyes, into his memories ...
\par \lquote He read Gregorovitch\rquote s mind, and I saw this young bloke perched on a windowsill, and he fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight. He stole it, he stole whatever You-Know-Who\rquote s after. And I ... I think I\rquote 
ve seen him somewhere ...\rquote 
\par Harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boy\rquote s face. The theft had happened many years ago, according to Gregorovitch. Why did the young thief look familiar?
\par The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent; all Harry could hear was Ron\rquote s breathing. After a while, Ron whispered, \lquote Couldn\rquote t you see what the thief was holding?\rquote 
\par \lquote No ... it must\rquote ve been something small.\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote 
\par The wooden slats of Ron\rquote s bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed.
\par \lquote Harry, you don\rquote t reckon You-Know-Who\rquote s after something else to turn into a Horcrux?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  said Harry slowly. \lquote Maybe. But wouldn\rquote t it be dangerous for him to make another one? Didn\rquote t Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, but maybe he doesn\rquote t know that.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... maybe,\rquote  said Harry.
\par He had been sure that Voldemort had been looking for a way round the problem of the twin cores, sure that Voldemort sought a solution from the old wandmaker ... and yet he had killed him, apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore.

\par What was Voldemort trying to find? Why, with the Ministry of Magic and the wizarding world at his feet, was he far away, intent on the pursuit of an object that Gregorovitch had once owned, and which had been stolen by the unknown thief?
\par Harry could still see the blond-haired youth\rquote s face, it was merry, wild; there was a Fred and George-ish air of triumphant trickery about him
. He had soared from the windowsill like a bird, and Harry had seen him before, but he could not think where ...
\par With Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was in danger now, and it was on him that Harry\rquote s thoughts dwelled, as Ron\rquote s snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he himself drifted slowly into sleep once more.

Early next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled and resilient-looking tree he could find. There in its shadow he buried Mad-Eye Moody\rquote 
s eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that Mad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge\rquote 
s door. Then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were going to do next.

Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron agreed, with the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing, 
while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town.
\par Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees, and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchant\-
ments, Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely entered the town when an unnatural chill, a descending mist and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood.

\par \lquote But you can make a brilliant Patronus!\rquote  protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the tent empty-handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word \lquote Dementors\rquote .
\par \lquote I couldn\rquote t ... make one,\rquote  he panted, clutching the stitch in his side. \lquote Wouldn\rquote t ... come.\rquote 
\par Their expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had been a nightmarish experience, seeing the Dementors gliding out of the mist in the distance and realising, as the paralysi
ng cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears, that he was not going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry\rquote 
s will power to uproot himself from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless Dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went.
\par \lquote So we still haven\rquote t got any food.\rquote 
\par \lquote Shut up, Ron,\rquote  snapped Hermione. \lquote Harry, what happened? Why do you think you couldn\rquote t make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know.\rquote 
\par He sat low in one of Perkins\rquote s old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the moment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him. Yesterday seemed a long time ago: today he might have been thirteen years old
 again, the only one who collapsed on the Hogwarts Express.
\par Ron kicked a chair leg.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  he snarled at Hermione. \lquote I\rquote m starving! All I\rquote ve had since I bled half to death is a couple of toadstools!\rquote 
\par \lquote You go and fight your way through the Dementors, then,\rquote  said Harry, stung.
\par \lquote I would, but my arm\rquote s in a sling, in case you hadn\rquote t noticed!\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s convenient.\rquote 
\par \lquote And what\rquote s that supposed to \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course!\rquote  cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both of them into silence. \lquote Harry, give me the locket! Come on,\rquote  she said impatiently, clicking her fingers at him when he did not react, \lquote 
the Horcrux, Harry, you\rquote re still wearing it!\rquote 
\par She held out her hands and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head. The moment it parted contact with Harry\rquote s s
kin he felt free and oddly light. He had not even realised that he was clammy, or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach, until both sensations lifted.
\par \lquote Better?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote Yeah, loads better!\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  she said, crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he associated with visiting the very sick, \lquote you don\rquote t think you\rquote ve been possessed, do you?\rquote 
\par \lquote What? No!\rquote  he said defensively. \lquote I remember everything we\rquote ve done while I\rquote ve been wearing it. I wouldn\rquote t know what I\rquote d done if I\rquote 
d been possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times when she couldn\rquote t remember anything.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hm,\rquote  said Hermione, looking down at the heavy locket. \lquote Well, maybe we ought not to wear it. We can just keep it in the tent.\rquote 
\par \lquote We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around,\rquote  Harry stated firmly. \lquote If we lose it, if it gets stolen \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, all right, all right,\rquote  said Hermione, and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt. \lquote But we\rquote ll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long.\rquote 
\par \lquote Great,\rquote  said Ron irritably, \lquote and now we\rquote ve sorted that out, can we please get some food?\rquote 
\par \lquote Fine, but we\rquote ll go somewhere else to find it,\rquote  said Hermione, with half a glance at Harry. \lquote There\rquote s no point staying where we know Dementors are swooping around.\rquote 
\par In the end they settled down for the night in a far-flung field belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread.
\par \lquote It\rquote s not stealing, is it?\rquote  asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as they devoured scrambled eggs on toast. \lquote Not if I left some money under the chicken coop?\rquote 
\par Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, \lquote \rquote Er-my-nee, \rquote oo worry \rquote oo much. \rquote Elax!\rquote 
\par And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed: the argument about the Dementors was forgotten in laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as he took the first of the three night watches.
\par This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry was the least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys\rquote 
. Hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to scavenge nothi
ng but berries or stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences rather dour. Ron, however, had always been used to three delicious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him bo
th unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron\rquote s turn to wear the Horcrux, he became downright unpleasant.
\par \lquote So where next?\rquote  was his constant refrain. He did not seem to have any ideas himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come
 up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies. Accordingly, Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where they might find the other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the one they had already got, their conversations beco
ming increasingly repetitive, as they had no new information.
\par As Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had hidden the Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept recit\-ing, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that Voldem
ort had lived in or visited. The orphanage where he had been born and raised, Hogwarts, where he had been educated, Borgin and Burkes, where he had worked after leaving school, then Albania, where he had spent his years of exile: these formed the basis of
 their speculations.
\par \lquote Yeah, let\rquote s go to Albania. Shouldn\rquote t take more than an after\-noon to search an entire country,\rquote  said Ron sarcastically.
\par \lquote There can\rquote t be anything there. He\rquote d already made five of his Horcruxes before he went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote We know the snake\rquote s not in Albania, it\rquote 
s usually with Vol\emdash \rquote

\par \lquote Not particularly.\rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes,\rquote  said Harry, who had made this point many times before, but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. \lquote Borgin and Burke were experts on Dark objects, they would

\par Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him, Harry ploughed on, \lquote I still reckon he might have hidden something at Hogwarts.\rquote 
\par Hermione sighed.
\par \lquote But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!\rquote 
\par Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favour of this theory.
\par \lquote Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwarts\rquote  secrets. I\rquote m telling you, if there was one place Vol\emdash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oi!\rquote 
\par \lquote YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!\rquote  Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. \lquote If there was one place that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was Hogwarts!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, come on,\rquote  scoffed Ron. \lquote His }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 school?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par \lquote Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was special, it meant everything to him, and even after he left \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote This is You-Know-Who we\rquote re talking about, right? Not you?\rquote  enquired Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck: Harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him.
\par \lquote You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he left,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something, probably another founder\rquote s object, to make into another Horcrux?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote But he didn\rquote t get the job, did he?\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote So he never got the chance to find a founder\rquote s object there and hide it in the school!\rquote 
\par \lquote OK, then,\rquote  said Harry, defeated. \lquote Forget Hogwarts.\rquote 
\par Without any other leads, they travelled into London and, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, searched for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been raised. Hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that the place had been demolish
ed many years before. They visited its site and found a towerblock of offices.
\par \lquote We could try digging in the foundations?\rquote  Hermione suggested half-heartedly.
\par \lquote He wouldn\rquote t have hidden a Horcrux here,\rquote  Harry said. He had known it all along: the orphanage had b
een the place Voldemort had been determined to escape from; he would never have hidden a part of his soul there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places; this dismal, grey corner of London was as far remo
ved as you could imagine from Hogwarts, or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the wizarding bank, with its golden doors and marble floors.
\par Even without any new ideas, they continued to move through the countryside, pitching the tent in a different p
lace each night for security. Every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot, travelling by Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy crevices of cliffs, to purple moors
,
 gorse-covered mountainsides and, once, a sheltered and pebbly cove. Every twelve hours or so, they passed the Horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse, slow-motion game of pass the parcel, where they dreaded the music stopping becau
se the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety.
\par Harry\rquote s scar kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed, when he was wearing the Horcrux. Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain.
\par \lquote What? What did you see?\rquote  demanded Ron, whenever he noticed Harry wince.
\par \lquote A face,\rquote  muttered Harry, every time. \lquote The same face. The thief who stole from Gregorovitch.\rquote 
\par And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his dis\-appointment. Harry knew that Ron was hoping to hear news of his family
, or of the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took his fancy. Apparently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unkn
own youth with the gleeful face, whose name and where\-abouts, Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no better than he did. As Harry\rquote 
s scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam tantalisingly in his memory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain 
or discomfort, for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. He could not entirely blame them, when they were so desperate for a lead on the Horcruxes.
\par As the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that Ron and Her
mione were having conversations without, and about, him. Several times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry entered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled a little distance away, heads together and talking fast; both times they fe
ll silent when they realised he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water.
\par Harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had
 some secret plan that they would learn in due course. Ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and Harry was starting to fear that Hermione, too, was disappointed by his poor leadership. In desperation he tried to think of further Horcrux locations
, but the only one that continued to occur to him was Hogwarts, and as neither of the others thought this at all likely, he stopped suggesting it.
\par Autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it: they were now pitching the tent on mulches of fal
len leaves. Natural mists joined those cast by the Dementors; wind and rain added to their troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing isolation, the lack of other pe
ople\rquote s company, or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against Voldemort.
\par \lquote My mother,\rquote  said Ron one night, as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in Wales, \lquote can make good food appear out of thin air.\rquote 
\par He prodded moodily at the lumps of charred, grey fish on his plate. Harry glanced automatically at Ron\rquote 
s neck and saw, as he had expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there. He managed to fight down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude would, he knew, improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket.
\par \lquote Your mother can\rquote t produce food out of thin air,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote No one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp\rquote s Law of Elemental Transfigur\emdash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, speak English, can\rquote t you?\rquote  Ron said, prising a fishbone out from between his teeth.
\par \lquote It\rquote s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you\rquote ve already got some \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  well, don\rquote t bother increasing this, it\rquote s disgusting,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I\rquote m always the one who ends up sorting out the food; because I\rquote m a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 girl,}{\rtlch\fcs1

\par \lquote Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!\rquote 
\par He was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not to talk. Then, over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them, he heard voices again. He looked round at the Sneakoscope. It was not moving.
\par \lquote You cast the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Muffliato }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 charm over us, right?\rquote

\par \lquote I did everything,\rquote  she whispered back, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Muffliato, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
Muggle-Repelling and Disillusionment Charms, all of it. They shouldn\rquote t be able to hear or see us, whoever they are.\rquote 
\par Heavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs, told t
hem that several people were clambering down the steep, wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting. The enchantments they had cast around them\-
selves ought to be sufficient, in the near total darkness, to shield them from the notice of Muggles and normal witches and wizards. If these were Death Eaters, then perhaps their defences were about to be tested by Dark Magic for the first time.
\par The voices became louder but no more intelligible as t
he group of men reached the bank. Harry estimated that their owners were less than twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a moment she drew out three
 Extendable Ears and threw one each to Harry and Ron, who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh-coloured strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance.
\par Within seconds Harry heard a weary, male voice.
\par \lquote There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d\rquote you reckon it\rquote s too early in the season? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Accio salmon!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively. Harry pressed the Extendable Ear deeper into his own: over the
 murmur of the river he could make out more voices, but they were not speaking English or any human language he had ever heard. It was a rough and unmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural noises, and there seemed to be two speakers, one with a s
lightly lower, slower voice than the other.
\par A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas; large shadows passed between tent and flames. The delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalisingly in their direction. Then came the clinking of cutler
y on plates, and the first man spoke again.
\par \lquote Here, Griphook, Gornuk.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Goblins! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded.
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote  said the goblins together in English.
\par \lquote So, you three have been on the run, how long?\rquote  asked a new, mellow and pleasant voice; it was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a round-bellied, cheerful-faced man.
\par \lquote Six weeks ... seven ... I forget,\rquote  said the tired man. \lquote Met up with Griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a bit of company.\rquote 
 There was a pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground. \lquote What made you leave, Ted?\rquote  continued the man.
\par \lquote Knew they were coming for me,\rquote  replied mellow-voiced Ted, and Harry suddenly knew who he was: Tonks\rquote s father. \lquote Heard Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I\rquote 
d better run for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter of time, knew I\rquote d have to leave in the end. My wife should be OK, she\rquote s pure-blood. And then I met Dean here, what, a few days ago, son?
\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said another voice, and Harry, Ron and Hermione stared at each other, silent but beside themselves with excitement, sure they recognised the voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow Gryffindor.
\par \lquote Muggle-born, eh?\rquote  asked the first man.
\par \lquote Not sure,\rquote  said Dean. \lquote My dad left my mum when I was a kid. I\rquote ve got no proof he was a wizard, though.\rquote 
\par There was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munch\-ing; then Ted spoke again.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve got to say, Dirk, I\rquote m surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surprised. Word was you\rquote d been caught.\rquote 
\par \lquote I was,\rquote  said Dirk. \lquote I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for it, Stunned Dawlish and nicked his broom. It was easier than you\rquote d think; I don\rquote t reckon he\rquote 
s quite right at the moment. Might be Confunded. If so, I\rquote d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it, probably saved my life.\rquote 
\par There was another pause, in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on. Then Ted said, \lquote And where do you two fit in? I, er, had the impression the goblins were for You-Know-Who, on the whole.\rquote 
\par \lquote You had a false impression,\rquote  said the higher-voiced of the goblins. \lquote We take no sides. This is a wizards\rquote  war.\rquote 
\par \lquote How come you\rquote re in hiding, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote I deemed it prudent,\rquote  said the deeper-voiced goblin. \lquote Having refused what I considered an impertinent request, I could see that my personal safety was in jeopardy.\rquote 
\par \lquote What did they ask you to do?\rquote  asked Ted.
\par \lquote Duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,\rquote  replied the goblin, his voice rougher and less human as he said it. \lquote I am not a house-elf.\rquote 
\par \lquote What about you, Griphook?\rquote 
\par \lquote Similar reasons,\rquote  said the higher-voiced goblin. \lquote Gringotts is no longer under the sole control of my race. I recognise no wizarding master.\rquote 
\par He added something under his breath in Gobbledegook and Gornuk laughed.
\par \lquote What\rquote s the joke?\rquote  asked Dean.
\par \lquote He said,\rquote  replied Dirk, \lquote that there are things wizards don\rquote t recognise, either.\rquote 
\par There was a short pause.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t get it,\rquote  said Dean.
\par \lquote I had my small revenge before I left,\rquote  said Griphook in English.
\par \lquote Good man \endash  goblin, I should say,\rquote  amended Ted hastily. \lquote Didn\rquote t manage to lock a Death Eater up in one of the old high-security vaults, I suppose?\rquote 
\par \lquote If I had, the sword would not have helped him break out,\rquote  replied Griphook. Gornuk laughed again and even Dirk gave a dry chuckle.
\par \lquote Dean and I are still missing something here,\rquote  said Ted.
\par \lquote So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,\rquote  said Griphook, and the two goblins roared with malicious laughter.
\par Inside the tent Harry\rquote s breathing was shallow with excitement: he and Hermione stared at each other, listening as hard as they could.
\par \lquote Didn\rquote t you hear about that, Ted?\rquote  asked Dirk. \lquote About the kids who tried to steal Gryffindor\rquote s sword out of Snape\rquote s office at Hogwarts?\rquote 
\par An electric current seemed to course through Harry, jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted to the spot.
\par \lquote Never heard a word,\rquote  said Ted. \lquote Not in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Prophet, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 was it?
\rquote 
\par \lquote Hardly,\rquote  chortled Dirk. \lquote Griphook here told me, he heard about it from Bill Weasley who works for the bank. One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bill\rquote s younger sister.\rquote 
\par Harry glanced towards Hermione and Ron, both of whom were clutching the Extendable Ears as tightly as lifelines.
\par \lquote She and a couple of friends got into Snape\rquote s office and smashed open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword. Snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, God bless \rquote em,\rquote  said Ted. \lquote What did they think, that they\rquote d be able to use the sword on You-Know-Who? Or on Snape himself?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape decided the sword wasn\rquote t safe where it was,\rquote  said Dirk. \lquote Couple of days later, once he\rquote d got the say so from You-Know-Who, I im
agine, he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead.\rquote 
\par The goblins started to laugh again.
\par \lquote I\rquote m still not seeing the joke,\rquote  said Ted.
\par \lquote It\rquote s a fake,\rquote  rasped Griphook.
\par \lquote The sword of Gryffindor!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yes. It is a copy \endash  an excellent copy, it is true \endash 
 but it was wizard-made. The original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only goblin-made armour possesses. Wherever the genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at Gringotts Bank.\rquote 
\par \lquote I see,\rquote  said Ted. \lquote And I take it you didn\rquote t bother telling the Death Eaters this?\rquote 
\par \lquote I saw no reason to trouble them with the information,\rquote  said Griphook smugly, and now Ted and Dean joined in Gornuk and Dirk\rquote s laughter.
\par Inside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone to ask the question he needed answered, and after a minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged; he was (Harry remembered with a jolt) an ex-boyfriend of Ginny\rquote s too.
\par \lquote What happened to Ginny and the others? The ones who tried to steal it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, they were punished, and cruelly,\rquote  said Griphook indifferently.
\par \lquote They\rquote re OK, though?\rquote  asked Ted quickly. \lquote I mean, the Weasleys don\rquote t need any more of their kids injured, do they?\rquote 
\par \lquote They suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware,\rquote  said Griphook.
\par \lquote Lucky for them,\rquote  said Ted. \lquote With Snape\rquote s track record, I suppose we should just be glad they\rquote re still alive.\rquote 
\par \lquote You believe that story, then, do you, Ted?\rquote  asked Dirk. \lquote You believe Snape killed Dumbledore?\rquote 
\par \lquote \rquote Course I do,\rquote  said Ted. \lquote You\rquote re not going to sit there and tell me you think Potter had anything to do with it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hard to know what to believe these days,\rquote  muttered Dirk.
\par \lquote I know Harry Potter,\rquote  said Dean. \lquote And I reckon he\rquote s the real thing \endash  the Chosen One, or whatever you want to call it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, there\rquote s a lot would like to believe he\rquote s that, son,\rquote  said Dirk, \lquote me included. But where is he? Run for it, by the looks of things. You\rquote d think, if he knew anything we don\rquote 
t, or had anything special going for him, he\rquote d be out there now fighting, rallying resistance, instead of hiding. And you know, the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Prophet }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par \lquote It\rquote s not so lunatic these days,\rquote  said Ted. \lquote You want to give it a look. Xeno is printing all the stuff the Prophet\rquote s ignoring, not a single mention of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks in the last issue. How long they\rquote

\par \lquote Hard to help a boy who\rquote s vanished off the face of the earth,\rquote  said Dirk.
\par \lquote Listen, the fact that they haven\rquote t caught him yet\rquote s one hell of an achievement,\rquote  said Ted. \lquote I\rquote d take tips from him gladly. It\rquote s what we\rquote re trying to do, stay free, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, well, you\rquote ve got a point there,\rquote  said Dirk heavily. \lquote With the whole of the Ministry and all their informers looking for him, I\rquote d have expected him to be caught by now. Mind, who\rquote s to say they haven\rquote 
t already caught and killed him without publicising it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, don\rquote t say that, Dirk,\rquote  murmured Ted.
\par There was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks. When they spoke again, it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the bank or retreat back 
up the wooded slope. Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, then clambered back up the incline, their voices fading away.
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry, who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped, now found himself unable to say more than, \lquote Ginny \endash  the sword \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I know!\rquote  said Hermione.
\par She lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit.
\par \lquote Here ... we ... are ...\rquote 
 she said between gritted teeth, and she pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag. Slowly, the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight. Harry hurried to help her. As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas Nigellus f
ree of Hermione\rquote s bag, she kept her wand pointing at it, ready to cast a spell at any moment.
\par \lquote If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in Dumbledore\rquote s office,\rquote  she panted, as they propped the painting against the side of the tent, \lquote Phi
neas Nigellus would have seen it happen, he hangs right beside the case!\rquote 
\par \lquote Unless he was asleep,\rquote  said Harry, but he still held his breath as Hermione knelt down in front of the empty canvas, her wand directed at its centre, cleared her throat, then said, \lquote Er \endash  Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?\rquote 

\par Nothing happened.
\par \lquote Phineas Nigellus?\rquote  said Hermione again. \lquote Professor Black? Please could we talk to you? Please?\rquote 
\par \lquote \'93Please\'94 always helps,\rquote  said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Nigellus slid into his portrait. At once, Hermione cried, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Obscuro!\rquote }{

\par \lquote Remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ruining a great work of art! Where am I? What is going on?\rquote 
\par \lquote Never mind where we are,\rquote  said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus froze, abandoning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold.
\par \lquote Can that possibly be the voice of the elusive Mr Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe,\rquote  said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Nigellus\rquote s interest. \lquote We\rquote ve got a couple of questions to ask you \endash  about the sword of Gryffindor.\rquote

\par \lquote Shut up about my sister,\rquote  said Ron roughly. Phineas Nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows.
\par \lquote Who else is here?\rquote  he asked, turning his head from side to side. \lquote Your tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardy in the extreme. Thieving from the Headmaster!\rquote

\par \lquote Where am I?\rquote  repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the blindfold again. \lquote Where have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?\rquote

\par Still blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying to feel his way out of his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts. Harry had a sudden inspiration.

\par Slightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts to leave his frame.
\par \lquote Professor Black,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote couldn\rquote t you just tell us, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 please, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case? Before Ginny took it out, I mean?\rquote 
\par Phineas snorted impatiently.
\par \lquote I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.\rquote 
\par Hermione whipped round to look at Harry. Neither of them dared say more in front of Phineas Nigellus, who had at last managed to locate the exit.
\par \lquote Well, goodnight to you,\rquote  he said, a little waspishly, and he began to move out of sight again. Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry gave a sudden shout.
\par \lquote Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?\rquote

\par And with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him nothing but his murky backdrop.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  Hermione cried.
\par \lquote I know!\rquote  Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he punched the air: it was more than he had 
dared to hope for. He strode up and down the tent, feeling that he could have run a mile; he did not even feel hungry any more. Hermione was squashing Phineas Nigellus\rquote 
s portrait back into the beaded bag; when she had fastened the clasp, she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to Harry.
\par \lquote The sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe only that which strengthens them \endash  Harry, that sword\rquote s impreg\-nated with Basilisk venom!\rquote 
\par \lquote And Dumbledore didn\rquote t give it to me because he still needed it, he wanted to use it on the locket \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and he must have realised they wouldn\rquote t let you have it if he put it in his will \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  so he made a copy \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and put a fake in the glass case \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and he left the real one ... where?\rquote 
\par They gazed at each other; Harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above them, tantalisingly close. Why hadn\rquote t Dumbledore told him? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but Harry had not realised it at the time?
\par \lquote Think!\rquote  whispered Hermione. \lquote Think! Where would he have left it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not at Hogwarts,\rquote  said Harry, resuming his pacing.
\par \lquote Somewhere in Hogsmeade?\rquote  suggested Hermione.
\par \lquote The Shrieking Shack?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Nobody ever goes in there.\rquote 
\par \lquote But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn\rquote t that be a bit risky?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore trusted Snape,\rquote  Harry reminded her.
\par \lquote Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Yeah, you\rquote re right!\rquote  said Harry; and he felt even more cheered at the thought that Dumbledore had had some reservations, however faint, about Snape\rquote s trustworthiness. \lquote 
So, would he have hidden the sword well away from Hogsmeade, then? What d\rquote you reckon, Ron? Ron?\rquote 
\par Harry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought that Ron had left the tent, then realised that Ron was lying in the shadow of a lower bunk, looking stony.
\par \lquote Oh, remembered me, have you?\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote What?\rquote 
\par Ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk.
\par \lquote You two carry on. Don\rquote t let me spoil your fun.\rquote 
\par Perplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook her head, apparently as nonplussed as he was.
\par \lquote What\rquote s the problem?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Problem? There\rquote s no problem,\rquote  said Ron, still refusing to look at Harry. \lquote Not according to you, anyway.\rquote 
\par There were several }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 plunks }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 on the canvas over their heads. It had started to rain.

\par \lquote Well, you\rquote ve obviously got a problem,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Spit it out, will you?\rquote 
\par Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He looked mean, unlike himself.
\par \lquote All right, I\rquote ll spit it out. Don\rquote t expect me to skip up and down the tent because there\rquote s some other damn thing we\rquote ve got to find. Just add it to the list of stuff you don\rquote t know.\rquote

 heavier; it pattered on the leaf-strewn bank all around them and into the river chattering through the dark. Dread doused Harry\rquote s jubilation: Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking.
\par \lquote It\rquote s not like I\rquote m not having the time of my life here,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after we\rquote

\par \lquote Ron,\rquote  Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was now beating on the tent.
\par \lquote I thought you knew what you\rquote d signed up for,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Yeah, I thought I did too.\rquote 
\par \lquote So what part of it isn\rquote t living up to your expectations?\rquote  asked Harry. Anger was coming to his defence now. \lquote Did you think we\rquote d be staying in five star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you
\rquote d be back to Mummy by Christmas?\rquote 
\par \lquote We thought you knew what you were doing!\rquote  shouted Ron, standing up; and his words pierced Harry like scalding knives. \lquote We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had a real plan!\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron!\rquote  said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof, but again, he ignored her.
\par \lquote Well, sorry to let you down,\rquote  said Harry, his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow, inadequate. \lquote I\rquote ve been straight with you from the start, I told you everything Dumbledore told me. And in case you haven\rquote

\par \lquote Yeah, and we\rquote re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them \endash  nowhere effing near, in other words!\rquote 
\par \lquote Take off the locket, Ron,\rquote  Hermione said, her voice unusually high. \lquote Please take it off. You wouldn\rquote t be talking like this if you hadn\rquote t been wearing it all day.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, he would,\rquote  said Harry, who did not want excuses made for Ron. \lquote D\rquote you think I haven\rquote t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? D\rquote you think I didn\rquote t guess you were thinking this stuff?\rquote 

\par \lquote Harry, we weren\rquote t \endash \rquote

\par \lquote I didn\rquote t say it like that \endash  Harry, I didn\rquote t!\rquote  she cried.
\par The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermione\rquote 
s face, and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been, a short-lived firework that had flared and died, leaving everything dark, wet and cold. The sword of Gryffindor was hidden they knew not where, and they were three
 teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not, yet, to be dead.
\par \lquote So why are you still here?\rquote  Harry asked Ron.
\par \lquote Search me,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Go home then,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Yeah, maybe I will!\rquote  shouted Ron, and he took several steps towards Harry, who did not back away. \lquote Didn\rquote t you hear what they said about my sister? But you don\rquote t give a rat\rquote s fart, do you, it\rquote

\par \lquote Not bothered what it meant, though?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron!\rquote  said Hermione, forcing her way between them, \lquote I don\rquote t think it means anything new has happened, anything we don\rquote t know about; think, Ron, Bill\rquote s already scarred, plenty of

she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and Harry on the one side and Ron on the 
other; all of them were forced backwards a few steps by the strength of the spell and Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time. Harry felt a corrosive hatred towards 
Ron: something had broken between them.
\par \lquote Leave the Horcrux,\rquote  Harry said.
\par Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair. He turned to Hermione.
\par \lquote What are you doing?\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote Are you staying, or what?\rquote 
\par \lquote I ...\rquote  She looked anguished. \lquote Yes \endash  yes, I\rquote m staying. Ron, we said we\rquote d go with Harry, we said we\rquote d help \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I get it. You choose him.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron, no \endash  please \endash  come back, come back!\rquote 
\par She was impeded by her own Shield Charm; by the time she had removed it, he had already stormed into the night. Harry stood quite still and silent, listening to her sobbing and calling Ron\rquote s name amongst the trees.
\par After a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to her face.
\par \lquote He\rquote s g \endash  g \endash  gone! Disapparated!\rquote 
\par She threw herself into a chair, curled up and started to cry.
\par Harry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux and placed it around his own neck. He dragged blankets off Ron\rquote s bunk and threw them over Hermione. Then he climbed on to his own bed and stared up at the dar
k canvas roof, listening to the pounding of the rain.

the following day, it was several seconds before he remembered what had happened. Then he hoped, childishly, that it had been a dream, that Ron was still there and had never left. Yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see Ron\rquote

ve enchantments meant that it would be impossible, once they vacated this spot, for Ron to find them again.
\par He and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. Hermione\rquote s eyes were puffy and red; she looked as if she had not slept. They packed up their things, Hermi
one dawdling. Harry knew why she wanted to spin out their time on the riverbank; several times he saw her look up eagerly and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain, but no red-haired figure appea
red between the trees. Every time Harry imitated her, looked round (for he could not help hoping a little himself) and saw nothing but rain-swept woods, another little parcel of fury exploded inside him. He could hear Ron saying }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote We thought you knew what you were doing!\rquote , }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach.
\par The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over on to their bank. They had lingered a good hour after they would usually have departed their campsit
e. Finally, having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times, Hermione seemed unable to find any more reasons to delay: she and Harry grasped hands and Disapparated, reappearing on a windswept, heather-covered hillside.
\par The instant they arrived Hermione dropped Harry\rquote 
s hand and walked away from him, finally sitting down on a large rock, her face on her knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs. He watched her, supposing that he ought to go and comfort her, but something kept him rooted to the spot. Ever
ything inside him felt cold and tight: again he saw the contemptuous expression on Ron\rquote 
s face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught Hermione at its centre, casting the spells she usually performed to ensure their protection.
\par They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was determined never to mention his name again, and Hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he
 would hear her crying. Meanwhile, Harry had started bringing out the Marauder\rquote s Map and examining it by wandlight. He was waiting for the moment when Ron\rquote 
s labelled dot would reappear in the corridors of Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to the com\-f
ortable castle, protected by his status of pure-blood. However, Ron did not appear on the map, and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at Ginny\rquote s name in the girls\rquote 
 dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was all right.
\par By day, they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible locations of Gryffindor\rquote s sword, but the more they talked about the 
places in which Dumbledore might have hidden it, the more desperate and far-fetched their speculation became. Cudgel his brains though he might, Harry could not remember Dumble\-
dore ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something. There were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
We thought you knew what you were doing ... we thought Dumbledore had told you what to do ... we thought you had a real plan!}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par He could not hide it from himself: Ron had been right. Dumbledore had left him with virtually nothing. They had dis\-
covered one Horcrux, but they had no means of destroying it: the others were as unattainable as they had ever been. Hopelessness threatened to engulf him. He was staggered, now, to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends\rquote 
 offers to accompany him on this meandering, pointless journey. He knew nothing, he had no ideas, and he was constantly, painfully on the alert for any indication that Hermione, too, was about to tell him that she had had enough, that she was leaving.

\par They were spending many evenings in near silence, and Hermione took to bringing out Phineas Nigellus\rquote s portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left by Ron\rquote s departure. Des
pite his previous assertion that he would never visit them again, Phineas Nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out more about what Harry was up to, and consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days or so. Harry was even glad to see
 
him, because he was company, albeit of a snide and taunting kind. They relished any news about what was happening at Hogwarts, though Phineas Nigellus was not an ideal informer. He venerated Snape, the first Slytherin Headmaster since he himself had contr
olled the school, and they had to be careful not to criticise, or ask impertinent questions about Snape, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly leave his painting.
\par However, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape seemed to be facing a constant, low-level of mutiny from a hard core of students. Ginny had been banned from going into Hogsmeade. Snape had reinstated Umbridge\rquote 
s old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students, or any unofficial student societies.
\par From all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, and probably Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to continue Dumbledore\rquote 
s Army. This scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so badly it felt like stomach ache; but it also made him think of Ron again, and of Dumbledore, and
 of Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as his ex-girlfriend. Indeed, as Phineas Nigellus talked about Snape\rquote 
s crackdown, Harry experienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the destabilisation of Snape\rquote 
s regime: being fed, and having a soft bed, and other people being in charge seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at that moment. But then he remembered that he was Undesirable Number One, that there was a ten thousand Galleon price on his h
ead, and that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic. Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently emphasised this fact by slipping in leading questions about Harry and Hermione\rquote 
s whereabouts. Hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time he did this, and Phineas Nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after these unceremonious goodbyes.
\par The weather grew colder and colder. They did not dare remain in any one area too long, so rathe
r than staying in the south of England, where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries, they continued to meander up and down the country, braving a mountainside, where sleet pounded the tent, a wide flat marsh, where the tent was flooded with c
hill water, and a tiny island in the middle of a Scottish loch, where snow half buried the tent in the night.
\par They had already spotted Christmas trees twinkling from several sitting-room windows, before there came an evening when Harry resolved to suggest, 
again, what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left to them. They had just eaten an unusually good meal: Hermione had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left) and Harry though
t that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears. He had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours\rquote 
 break from wearing the Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him.
\par \lquote Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hm?\rquote  She was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 The Tales of Beedle the Bard. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 He could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book, which was not, after all, very long; but evidently she was still deciphering something in it, because }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Harry cleared his throat. He felt exactly as he had done on the occasion, several years previously, when he had asked Professor McGonagall whether he could go into Hogsmeade, despi
te the fact that he had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip.
\par \lquote Hermione, I\rquote ve been thinking, and \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, could you help me with something?\rquote 
\par Apparently she had not been listening to him. She leaned forwards and held out }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 The Tales of Beedle the Bard.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Look at that symbol,\rquote  she said, pointing to the top of a page. Above what Harry assumed was the title of the story (being unable to read runes, he could not be sure), there was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye,

\par \lquote I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione.\rquote

Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689, wizards went into hiding for good. It was natural, perhaps, that they formed their own small communities within a community. Many small villages and 
hamlets attracted several magical families, who banded together for mutual support and protection. The villages of Tinworth in Cornwall, Upper Flagley in Yorkshire and Ottery St Catchpole on the south coast of England were notable homes to knots of wizard
ing families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes Confunded Muggles. Most celebrated of these half-magical dwelling places is, perhaps, Godric\rquote 
s Hollow, the West Country village where the great wizard Godric Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman Wright, wizarding smith, forged the first Golden Snitch. The grave\-
yard is full of the names of ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, for the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little church for many centuries.\'94}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 

\par \lquote You and your parents aren\rquote t mentioned,\rquote  Hermione said, closing the book, \lquote because Professor Bagshot doesn\rquote t cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century. But you see? Godric\rquote

\par \lquote Oh, yeah ...\rquote 
\par Harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword at all when he suggested they go to Godric\rquote s Hollow. For him, the lure of the village lay in his parents\rquote  graves, the house where he 
had narrowly escaped death, and in the person of Bathilda Bagshot.
\par \lquote Remember what Muriel said?\rquote  he asked eventually.
\par \lquote Who?\rquote 
\par \lquote You know,\rquote  he hesitated: he did not want to say Ron\rquote s name. \lquote Ginny\rquote s great aunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that she had sensed Ron\rquote s name in the offing. He rushed on: \lquote She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric\rquote s Hollow.\rquote 
\par \lquote Bathilda Bagshot,\rquote  murmured Hermione, running her index finger over Bathilda\rquote s embossed name on the front cover of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 A History of Magic. }{

\par She gasped so dramatically that Harry\rquote s insides turned over; he drew his wand, looking round at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap, but there was nothing there.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  he said, half-angry, half-relieved. \lquote What did you do that for? I thought you\rquote d seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent, at least \endash \rquote

What if Dumbledore entrusted it to her?\rquote 
\par Harry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be an extremely old woman by now, and according to Muriel, she was \lquote gaga\rquote 
. Was it likely that Dumbledore would have hidden the sword of Gryffindor with her? If so, Harry felt that Dumbledore had left a g
reat deal to chance: Dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake, nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship with Bathilda. Now, however, was not the moment to cast doubt on Hermione\rquote 
s theory, not when she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with Harry\rquote s dearest wish.
\par \lquote Yeah, he might\rquote ve done! So, are we going to go to Godric\rquote s Hollow?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, but we\rquote ll have to think it through carefully, Harry.\rquote  She was sitting up now, and Harry could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his. \lquote We\rquote 
ll need to practise Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak, for a start, and perhaps Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too, unless you think we should go the whole hog and use Polyjuice Potion? In that case we\rquote 
ll need to collect hair from somebody. I actually think we\rquote d better do that, Harry, the thicker our disguises the better ...\rquote 
\par Harry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause, but his mind had left the conversation. For the first time since he had discovered that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, he felt excited.
\par He was about to go home, about to return to the place where he had had a family. It was in Godric\rquote s Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he would have grown up an
d spent every school holiday. He could have invited friends to his house ... he might even have had brothers and sisters ... it would have been his mother who had made his seventeenth birthday cake. The life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to h
i
m as at this moment when he knew he was about to see the place where it had been taken from him. After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from her beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid had given
 him so long ago. For the first time in months, he perused the old pictures of his parents, smiling and waving up at him from the images, which were all he had left of them now.
\par Harry would gladly have set out for Godric\rquote s Hollow the following day, but Hermione had other ideas. Convinced as she was that Voldemort would expect Harry to return to the scene of his parents\rquote 
 deaths, she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible. It was therefore a full week later \endash 
 once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who were Christmas shopping, and had practised Apparating and Disapparating while underneath the Invisibility Cloak together \endash  that Hermione agreed to make the journey.
\par T
hey were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it was late afternoon when they finally swallowed Polyjuice Potion, Harry transforming into a balding, middle-aged Muggle man, Hermione into his small and rather mousy wife. The beaded bag co
ntaining all of their possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which Harry was wearing around his neck) was tucked into an inside pocket of Hermione\rquote 
s buttoned-up coat. Harry lowered the Invisibility Cloak over them, then they turned into the suffocating darkness once again.
\par Heart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. They were standing hand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky in which the night\rquote 
s first stars were already glimmering feebly. Cottages stood on either side of the narrow road, Christmas decorations twinkling in their windows. A short way ahead of them, a glow of golden streetlights indicated the centre of the village.
\par \lquote All this snow!\rquote  Hermione whispered beneath the Cloak. \lquote Why didn\rquote t we think of snow? After all our precautions, we\rquote ll leave prints! We\rquote ll just have to get rid of them \endash  you go in front, I\rquote ll do it 
\endash \rquote 
\par Harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse, trying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their traces.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s take off the Cloak,\rquote  said Harry, and when she looked frightened, \lquote oh, come on, we don\rquote t look like us and there\rquote s no one around.\rquote 
\par He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made th
eir way forwards unhampered, the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more cottages: any one of them might have been the one in which James and Lily had once lived, or where Bathilda lived now. Harry gazed at the front doors, their snow-burdened ro
o
fs and their front porches, wondering whether he remembered any of them, knowing deep inside that it was impossible, that he had been little over a year old when he had left this place forever. He was not even sure whether he would be able to see the cott
age at all; he did not know what happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then the little lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village, a small square, was revealed to them.
\par Strung all around with coloured lights, there was what looked like a war memorial in the middle, partly obscured by a wind\-blown Christmas tree. There were several shops, a post office, a pub and a little church whose stained-glass windows were glow\-
ing jewel bright across the square.
\par The snow here had become impacted: it was hard and slippery where people had trodden on it all day. Villagers were criss\-
crossing in front of them, their figures briefly illuminated by street lamps. They heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed; then they heard a carol start up inside the little church.
\par \lquote Harry, I think it\rquote s Christmas Eve!\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Is it?\rquote 
\par He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for weeks.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sure it is,\rquote  said Hermione, her eyes upon the church. \lquote They ... they\rquote ll be in there, won\rquote t they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it.\rquote 
\par Harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement, more like fear. Now that he was so near, he wondered whether he wanted to see, aft
er all. Perhaps Hermione knew how he was feeling, because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first time, pulling him forwards. Halfway across the square, however, she stopped dead.
\par \lquote Harry, look!\rquote 
\par She was pointing at the war memorial. As the
y had passed it, it had transformed. Instead of an obelisk covered in names, there was a statue of three people: a man with untidy hair and glasses, a woman with long hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy sitting in his mother\rquote 
s arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like fluffy, white caps.
\par Harry drew closer, gazing up into his parents\rquote  faces. He had never imagined that there would be a statue ... how strange it was to see himself represented in stone, a happy baby without a scar on his forehead ...
\par \lquote C\rquote mon,\rquote  said Harry, when he had looked his fill, and they turned again towards the church. As they crossed the road, he glanced over his shoulder; the statue had turned back into the war memorial.
\par The singing grew louder as they approached the church. It made Harry\rquote s throat constrict, it reminded him so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of armour, of the Great Hall\rquote 
s twelve Christmas trees, of Dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker, of Ron in a hand-knitted sweater ...
\par There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Hermione pushed it open as quietly as possible and they edged through it. On either side of the slippery path to the church doors the snow lay deep and untouched. They mo
ved off through the snow, carving deep trenches behind them as they walked round the building, keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant windows.
\par Behind the church, row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket of pale blue that was flecked 
with dazzling red, gold and green wherever the reflections from the stained glass hit the snow. Keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his jacket pocket, Harry moved towards the nearest grave.
\par \lquote Look at this, it\rquote s an Abbott, could be some long lost relation of Hannah\rquote s!\rquote 
\par \lquote Keep your voice down,\rquote  Hermione begged him.
\par They waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, gouging dark tracks into the snow behind them, stooping to peer at the words on old headstones, every now and then squinting into the surro
unding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied.
\par \lquote Harry, here!\rquote 
\par Hermione was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back to her, his heart positively banging in his chest.
\par \lquote Is it \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote No, but look!\rquote 
\par She pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down and saw, upon the frozen, lichen-spotted granite, the words }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Kendra Dumbledore }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. Harry could not help thinking that he and Dumbledor
e both had deep roots in this graveyard, and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so; yet he had never thought to share the connection. They could have visited the place together; for a moment Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore, of what a bond t
hat would have been, of how much it would have meant to him. But it seemed that to Dumbledore, the fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he wanted Harry to do.

\par Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow. He read the words on the tombstone again. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

m, as the eldest member of the family once his mother had died.
\par \lquote Are you sure he never mentioned \endash ?\rquote  Hermione began.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry curtly, then, \lquote let\rquote s keep looking,\rquote  and he turned away, wishing he had not seen the stone: he did not want his excited trepidation tainted with resentment.
\par \lquote Here!\rquote  cried Hermione again a few moments later, from out of the darkness. \lquote Oh, no, sorry! I thought it said Potter.\rquote 
\par She was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little frown on her face.
\par \lquote Harry, come back a moment.\rquote 
\par He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made his way back through the snow towards her.
\par \lquote What?\rquote 
\par \lquote Look at this!\rquote 
\par The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it.
\par \lquote Harry, that\rquote s the mark in the book!\rquote 
\par He peered at the place she indicated: the stone was so worn that it was hard to make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name.
\par \lquote Yeah ... it could be ...\rquote 
\par Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone.
\par \lquote It says Ig \endash  Ignotus, I think ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?\rquote  Harry told her, a slight edge to his voice, and he set off again, leaving her crouched beside the old grave.
\par Every now and then he recognised a surname that, like Abbott, he had met at Hogwarts. Sometimes there were several generations of the same wizarding family represented in the graveyard: Harry could tell from the dates 
that it had either died out, or the current members had moved away from Godric\rquote s Hollow. Deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went, and every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation.
\par The darkness and the s
ilence seemed to become, all of a sudden, much deeper. Harry looked around, worried, thinking of Dementors, then realised that the carols had finished, that the chatter and flurry of church-goers were fading away as they made their way back into the squar
e. Somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights.
\par Then Hermione\rquote s voice came out of the blackness for the third time, sharp and clear from a few yards away.
\par \lquote Harry, they\rquote re here ... right here.\rquote 
\par And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and
 father this time: he moved towards her feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest, the same sensation he had had right after Dumbledore had died, a grief that had actually weighed on his heart and lungs.
\par The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana\rquote s. It was made of white marble, just like Dumbledore\rquote 
s tomb, and this made it easy to read, as it seemed to shine in the dark. Harry did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it.

 the night air, trying to steady himself, trying to regain control. He should have brought something to give them, and he had not thought of it, and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen. But Hermione raised her wand, moved it in a circle t
hrough the air and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed before them. Harry caught it and laid it on his parents\rquote  grave.
\par As soon as he stood up, he wanted to leave: he did not think he could stand another moment there. He put his arm around Hermione\rquote s shoul
ders, and she put hers around his waist, and they turned in silence and walked away through the snow, past Dumbledore\rquote s mother and sister, back towards the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing gate.

\par They had only just reached the grave of the unknown Abbott.
\par \lquote There\rquote s someone there. Someone watching us. I can tell. There, over by the bushes.\rquote

the graveyard was supposed to be haunted: what if \endash ? But then he heard a rustle and saw a little eddy of dislodged snow in the bush to which Hermione had pointed. Ghosts could not move snow.
\par \lquote It\rquote s a cat,\rquote  said Harry, after a second or two, \lquote or a bird. If it was a Death Eater, we\rquote d be dead by now. But let\rquote s get out of here, and we can put the Cloak back on.\rquote 
\par They glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the graveyard. Harry, who did not feel as sanguine as he had pre\-tended when reassuring Hermione, was glad to reach the gate and the slippery pavement. They pulled the Invi
sibility Cloak back over themselves. The pub was fuller than before: many voices inside it were now singing the carol that they had heard as they approached the church. For a moment Harry considered suggest\-
ing they take refuge inside it, but before he could say anything Hermione murmured, \lquote Let\rquote s go this way,\rquote 
 and pulled him down the dark street leading out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered. Harry could make out the point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into o
pen country again. They walked as quickly as they dared, past more windows sparkling with multicoloured lights, the outlines of Christmas trees dark through the curtains.
\par \lquote How are we going to find Bathilda\rquote s house?\rquote  asked Hermione, who was shivering a little and kept glancing back over her shoulder. \lquote Harry? What do you think? Harry?\rquote 
\par She tugged at his arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He was looking towards the dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses. Next moment he had sped up, dragging Hermione along with him; she slipped a little on the ice.
\par \lquote Harry \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Look ... look at it, Hermione \'85\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t ... oh!\rquote 
\par He could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily. The hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the waist-high grass. Most of the cottage was still stand\-
ing, though entirely covered in dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top floor had been blown apart; that, Harry was sure, was wh
ere the curse had backfired. He and Hermione stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it.
\par \lquote I wonder why nobody\rquote s ever rebuilt it?\rquote  whispered Hermione.
\par \lquote Maybe you can\rquote t rebuild it?\rquote  Harry replied. \lquote Maybe it\rquote s like the injuries from Dark Magic and you can\rquote t repair the damage?\rquote 
\par He slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate, not wishing to open it, but simply to hold some part of the house.
\par \lquote You\rquote re not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might \endash  oh, Harry, look!\rquote 
\par His touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign had risen out of the ground in front of them, up through the tangles of nettles and weeds, like some bizarre, fast-growing flower, and in golden letters upon the wood it said:

\par \lquote They shouldn\rquote t have written on the sign!\rquote  said Hermione, indignant.
\par But Harry beamed at her.
\par \lquote It\rquote s brilliant. I\rquote m glad they did. I ...\rquote 
\par He broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane towards them, silhouetted by the bright lights in the distant square. Harry thought, though it was hard to judge, tha
t the figure was a woman. She was moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on the snowy ground. Her stoop, her stoutness, her shuffling gait all gave an impression of extreme age. They watched in silence as she drew nearer. Harry was waiting to see 
whether she would turn into any of the cottages she was passing, but he knew, instinctively, that she would not. At last she came to a halt a few yards from them, and simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing them.
\par He did not need Hermione\rquote 
s pinch to his arm. There was next to no chance that this woman was a Muggle: she was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to her, if she was not a witch. Even assuming that she was a witch, however, it was odd beh
aviour to come out on a night this cold, simply to look at an old ruin. By all the rules of normal magic, meanwhile, she ought not to be able to see Hermione and him at all. Nevertheless, Harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that they were there,
 and also who they were. Just as he had reached this uneasy conclusion, she raised a gloved hand and beckoned.
\par Hermione moved closer to him under the Cloak, her arm pressed against his.
\par \lquote How does she know?\rquote 
\par He shook his head. The woman beckoned again, more vigorously. Harry could think of many reasons not to obey the summons, and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing stronger every moment that they stood facing each other in the deserted street.

\par Was it possible that she had been waiting for them
 all these long months? That Dumbledore had told her to wait, and that Harry would come in the end? Was it not likely that it was she who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to this spot? Even her ability to sense them suggeste
d some Dumbledore-ish power that he had never encountered before.
\par Finally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump.
\par \lquote Are you Bathilda?\rquote 
\par The muffled figure nodded and beckoned again.
\par Beneath the Cloak, Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Harry raised his eyebrows; Hermione gave a tiny, nervous nod.
\par They stepped towards the woman and, at once, she turned and hobbled off back the way they had come. Leading them past several houses, she turned in at a gate. They followed her up the front path through 
a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left. She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped back to let them pass.
\par She smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house: Harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past h
er and pulled off the Cloak. Now that he was beside her, he realised how tiny she was; bowed down with age, she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind them, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and pee
red into Harry\rquote 
s face. Her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin, and her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots. He wondered whether she could make him out at all; even if she could, it was the balding Mu
ggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see.
\par The odour of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as she unwound a moth-eaten, black shawl, revealing a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly.
\par \lquote Bathilda?\rquote  Harry repeated.
\par She nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his skin; the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken; he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. Did it know, could it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near?

\par Bathilda shuffled past them, pushing Hermione aside as though she had not seen her, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room.
\par \lquote Harry, I\rquote m not sure about this,\rquote  breathed Hermione.
\par \lquote Look at the size of her; I think we could overpower her if we had to,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Listen, I should have told you, I knew she wasn\rquote t all there. Muriel called her \'93gaga\'94.\rquote 
\par \lquote Come!\rquote  called Bathilda from the next room.
\par Hermione jumped and clutched Harry\rquote s arm.
\par \lquote It\rquote s OK,\rquote  said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the sitting room.
\par Bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles, but it was still very dark, not to mention extremely dirty. Thick dust crunched beneath their feet and Harry\rquote s nose detected, under\-
neath the dank and mildewed smell, something worse, like meat gone bad. He wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside Bathilda\rquote 
s house to check whether she was coping. She seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic too, for she lit the candles clumsily by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching fire.
\par \lquote Let me do that,\rquote  offered Harry, and he took the matches from her. She stood watching him as he finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room, 
perched precariously on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and mouldy cups.
\par The last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bow-fronted chest of drawers on which there stood a large number of photographs. When the flame danced into life, its reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver. He saw a few tiny move\-
ments from the pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, he muttered, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Tergeo.\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 The dust vanished from the photographs, and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most ornate frames. He wondered whether Bathilda or some\-
body else had removed them. Then the sight of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his eye, and he snatched it up.
\par It was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young man who had perched on Gregorovitch\rquote s windowsill, smiling lazily up at Harry out of the silver frame. And it came to Harry, instantly, where he had seen the boy before: in }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 arm in arm with the tee
nage Dumbledore, and that must be where all the missing photographs were: in Rita\rquote s book.
\par \lquote Mrs \endash  Miss \endash  Bagshot?\rquote  he said, and his voice shook slightly. \lquote Who is this?\rquote 
\par Bathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Hermione light the fire for her.
\par \lquote Miss Bagshot?\rquote  Harry repeated, and he advanced, with the picture in his hands, as the flames burst into life in the fireplace. Bathilda looked up at his voice and the Horcrux beat faster upon his chest.
\par \lquote Who is this person?\rquote  Harry asked her, pushing the picture forwards.
\par She peered at it solemnly, then up at Harry.
\par \lquote Do you know who this is?\rquote  he repeated, in a much slower and louder voice than usual. \lquote This man? Do you know him? What\rquote s he called?\rquote 
\par Bathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful frustration. How had Rita Skeeter unlocked Bathilda\rquote s memories?
\par \lquote Who is this man?\rquote  he repeated loudly.
\par \lquote Harry, what are you doing?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote This picture, Hermione, it\rquote s the thief, the thief who stole from Gregorovitch! Please!\rquote  he said to Bathilda. \lquote Who is this?\rquote 
\par But she only stared at him.
\par \lquote Why did you ask us to come with you, Mrs \endash  Miss \endash  Bagshot?\rquote  asked Hermione, raising her own voice. \lquote Was there something you wanted to tell us?\rquote 
\par Giving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to Harry. With a little jerk of her head, she looked back into the hall.
\par \lquote You want us to leave?\rquote  he asked.
\par She repeated the gesture, this time pointing first at him, then at herself, then at the ceiling.
\par \lquote Oh, right ... Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs with her.\rquote 
\par \lquote All right,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote let\rquote s go.\rquote 
\par But when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with surprising vigour, once more pointing first at Harry, then to herself.
\par \lquote She wants me to go with her, alone.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why?\rquote  asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room; the old lady shook her head a little at the loud noise.
\par \lquote Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only to me?\rquote 
\par \lquote Do you really think she knows who you are?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon his own, \lquote I think she does.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, OK then, but be quick, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Lead the way,\rquote  Harry told Bathilda.
\par She seemed to understand, because she shuffled round him towards the door. Harry glanced back at Hermione with a reassur\-
ing smile, but he was not sure she had seen it; she stood hugging herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking towards the bookcase. As Harry walked out of the room, unseen by both Hermione and Bathilda, he slipped the s
ilver-framed photograph of the unknown thief inside his jacket.
\par The stairs were steep and narrow: Harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout Bathilda\rquote s backside to ensure that she did not topple over backwards on top of him, which seemed only too l
ikely. Slowly, wheezing a little, she climbed to the upper landing, turned immediately right and led him into a low-ceilinged bedroom.
\par It was pitch black and smelled horrible: Harry had just made out a chamber pot protruding from under the bed before Bathilda closed the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Lumos,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
said Harry, and his wand ignited. He gave a start: Bathilda had moved close to him in those few seconds of darkness, and he had not heard her approach.
\par \lquote You are Potter?\rquote  she whispered.
\par \lquote Yes, I am.\rquote 
\par She nodded slowly, solemnly. Harry felt the Horcrux beating fast, faster than his own heart: it was an unpleasant, agitating sensation.
\par \lquote Have you got anything for me?\rquote  Harry asked, but she seemed distracted by his lit wand-tip.
\par \lquote Have you got anything for me?\rquote  he repeated.
\par Then she closed her eyes and several things happened at once: Harry\rquote s scar prickled painfully; the Horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater actually moved; the dark, fetid room dissolved momentarily. He felt a leap
 of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 hold him!}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par Harry swayed where he stood: the dark, foul-smelling room seemed to close around him again; he did not know what had just happened.
\par \lquote Have you got anything for me?\rquote  he asked for a third time, much louder.
\par \lquote Over here,\rquote  she whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry raised his wand and saw the outline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window.
\par This time she did not lead him. Harry edged between her and the unmade bed, his wand raised. He did not want to look away from her.
\par \lquote What is it?\rquote  he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry.
\par \lquote There,\rquote  she said, pointing at the shapeless mass.
\par And in the instant that he looked away, his eyes
 raking the tangled mess for a sword hilt, a ruby, she moved weirdly: he saw it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn and horror paralysed him as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been
.
\par The snake struck as he raised his wand: the force of the bite to his forearm sent the wand spinning up towards the ceiling, its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was extinguished: then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the brea
th out of him: he fell backwards on to the dressing table, into the mound of filthy clothing \endash 
\par He rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake\rquote s tail, which thrashed down upon the table where he had been a second earlier: fragments of the glass surface rained upon him as he hit the floor. From below, he heard Hermione call, \lquote Harry?
\rquote 
\par He could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back: then a heavy smooth mass smashed him to the floor and he felt it slide over him, powerful, muscular \endash 
\par \lquote No!\rquote  he gasped, pinned to the floor.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Yes,\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640  whispered the voice. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par But nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it coiled itself around his torso, squeezing the air from
 him, pressing the Horcrux hard into his chest, a circle of ice that throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, and his brain was flooding with cold, white light, all thought obliterated, his own breath drowned, distant footsteps, everything g
oing ...
\par A metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was flying, flying with triumph in his heart, without need of broom\-stick or Thestral ...
\par He was abruptly awake
 in the sour-smelling darkness; Nagini had released him. He scrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light: it struck, and Hermione dived aside with a shriek: her deflected curse hit the curtained window, which shattered. Frozen air fil
led the room as Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and his foot slipped on a pencil-like something \endash  his wand \endash 
\par He bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, its tail thrashing; Hermione was nowhere to be seen and for

The sun was coming up: the pure, colourless vastness of the sky stretched over him, indifferent to him and his suffering. Harry sat down in the tent entrance and took a deep breath of clean air. Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over the sparkling 
s
nowy hillside ought to have been the greatest treasure on earth, yet he could not appreciate it: his senses had been spiked by the calamity of losing his wand. He looked out over a valley blanketed in snow, distant church bells chiming through the glitter
ing silence.

Without realising it, he was digging his fingers into his arms as if he were trying to resist physical pain. He had spilled his own blood more times than he could count; he had lost all the bones in his right arm once; this journey had already 
given him scars to his chest and forearm to join those on his hand and forehead, but never, until this moment, had he felt himself to be fatally weak\-
ened, vulnerable and naked, as though the best part of his magical power had been torn from him. He knew e
xactly what Hermione would say if he expressed any of this: the wand is only as good as the wizard. But she was wrong, his case was different. She had not felt the wand spin like the needle of a compass and shoot golden flames at his enemy. He had lost th
e protection of the twin cores, and only now that it was gone did he realise how much he had been counting upon it.
\par He pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and, without looking at them, tucked them away in Hagrid\rquote s pouch around his neck. The pouch was now too full of broken and useless objects to take any more. Harry\rquote 
s hand brushed the old Snitch through the Mokeskin and for a moment he had to fight the temptation to pull it out and throw it away. Impenetrable, unhelp\-ful, useless like everything else Dumbledore had left behind \endash 
\par And his fury at Dumbledore broke over him now like lava, scorching him inside, wiping out every other feeling. Out of sheer desperation they had talked themselves into believing that Godric\rquote s Hollow held answers, an
d convinced themselves that they were supposed to go back, that it was all part of some secret path laid out for them by Dumbledore; but there was no map, no plan. Dumbledore had left them to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with unknown and undreamed of
 
terrors alone and unaided: nothing was explained, nothing was given freely, they had no sword, and now, Harry had no wand. And he had dropped the photograph of the thief, and it would surely be easy, now, for Voldemort to find out who he was ... Voldemort
 had all the information now ...

\par He tried to return her watery smile, then turned his attention to the book. Its spine was stiff; it had clearly never been opened before. He riffled through the pages, looking for photo
graphs. He came across the one he sought almost at once, the young Dumbledore and his handsome companion, roaring with laughter at some long forgotten joke. Harry dropped his eyes to the caption.

\par His temper would not remain in check much longer: he stood up and walked around, trying to work some of it off.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote All that \'93right to rule\'94 rubbish, it\rquote s \'93Magic is Might\'94 all over again. But Harry, his mother had just died, he was stuck alone in the house

\par \lquote The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn\rquote t want to conquer Muggles by force!\rquote  Harry shouted, his voice echoing across the empty hilltop, and several blackbirds rose into the air, squawking and spiralling against the pearly sky.
\par \lquote He changed, Harry, he changed! It\rquote s as simple as that! Maybe he did believe these things when he was seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore

\par Rita\rquote s book lay on the ground between them, so that the face of Albus Dumbledore smiled dolefully at both.
\par \lquote Harry, I\rquote m sorry, but I think the real reason you\rquote re so angry is that Dumbledore never told you any of this himself.\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe I am!\rquote  Harry bellowed, and he flung his arms over his head, hardly knowing whether he was trying to hold in his anger or protect himself from the weight of his own disillusionment. \lquote

\par His voice cracked with the strain, and they stood looking at each other in the whiteness and the emptiness, and Harry felt they were as insignificant as insects beneath that wide sky.
\par \lquote He loved you,\rquote  Hermione whispered. \lquote I know he loved you.\rquote 
\par Harry dropped his arms.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn\rquote t love, the mess he\rquote s left me in. He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me.\rquote 

\par Harry picked up Hermione\rquote s wand, which he had dropped in the snow, and sat back down in the entrance of the tent.
\par \lquote Thanks for the tea. I\rquote ll finish the watch. You get back in the warm.\rquote 
\par She hesitat

Finally, he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was huddled in the entrance to the tent reading }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 A History of Magic }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 by the light of her wand. The snow was still falling thickly and she greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll go somewhere more sheltered,\rquote  she agreed, shivering as she pulled on a sweatshirt over her pyjamas. \lquote I kept thinking I could hear people moving outside. I even thought I saw somebody once or twice.\rquote 
\par Harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent, motionless Sneakoscope on the table.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sure I imagined it,\rquote  said Hermione, looking nervous, \lquote the snow in the dark, it plays tricks on your eyes ... but perhaps we ought to Disapparate under the Invisibility Cloak, just in case?\rquote 
\par Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Horcrux and Hermione clutching the beaded bag, they Disapparated. The usual tightness engulfed them; Harry\rquote s feet parted company with the snowy ground
 then slammed hard on to what felt like frozen earth covered with leaves.
\par \lquote Where are we?\rquote  he asked, peering around at a fresh mass of trees as Hermione opened the beaded bag and began tugging out tent poles.
\par \lquote The Forest of Dean,\rquote  she said. \lquote I came camping here once, with my mum and dad.\rquote 
\par Here, too, snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold, but they were at least protected from the wind. They spent most of the day inside the tent, huddled for warmth round the use\-ful bright blue flames that 
Hermione was so adept at producing, and which could be scooped up and carried around in a jar. Harry felt as though he was recuperating from some brief but severe illness, an impression reinforced by Hermione\rquote 
s solicitousness. That afternoon fresh flakes drifted down upon them, so that even their sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery snow.
\par After two nights of little sleep, Harry\rquote s senses seemed more alert than usual. Their escape from Godric\rquote s Hollow had been so narrow that Voldemort seemed some
how closer than before, more threatening. As darkness drew in again, Harry refused Hermione\rquote s offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed.
\par Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing all the sweaters he owned but, even so, still shivery. The darkness deepened with the passing hours until it was virtually impenetrable. He was on the point of taking out the Marauder
\rquote s Map, so as to watch Ginny\rquote s dot for a while, before he remem\-bered that it was the Christmas holidays and that she would be back at The Burrow.
\par Every tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest. Harry knew that it must be full of living creatures, but he wished they would all remain still and silent so that he could separate their innocent scurryings an
d prowlings from noises that might proclaim other, sinister, movements. He remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago, and at once thought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself. Their protective enchantments had
 worked for weeks; why should they break now? And yet he could not throw off the feeling that something was different tonight.
\par Several times he jerked upright, his neck aching because he had fallen asleep, slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the tent. The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he might have been suspended in limbo between Disap\-
parition and Apparition. He had just held up a hand in front of his face to see whether he could make out his fingers when it happened.
\par A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the trees. Whatever the source, it was moving sound\-lessly. The light seemed simply to drift towards him.
\par He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermione\rquote s wand. He screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding, the trees in front of it pitch black in silhouette, and still the thing came closer ...
\par And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak. It was a silver-white doe, moon-bright and dazzling, pi
cking her way over the ground, still silent, and leaving no hoof prints in the fine powdering of snow. She stepped towards him, her beautiful head with its wide, long-lashed eyes held high.
\par Harry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at her strangeness, but at her inexplicable familiarity. He felt that he had been waiting for her to come, but that he had forgotten, until this moment, that they had arranged to meet. His impulse to s
hout for Hermione, which had been so strong a moment ago, had gone. He knew, he would have staked his life on it, that she had come for him, and him alone.
\par They gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned and walked away.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. \lquote Come back!\rquote 
\par She continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon her brightness was striped by their thick, black trunks. For one trembling second he hesitated. Caution murmured: it could be a trick, 
a lure, a trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him that this was not Dark Magic. He set off in pursuit.
\par Snow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as she passed through the trees, for she was nothing but light. Deeper and deeper i
nto the forest she led him, and Harry walked quickly, sure that when she stopped, she would allow him to approach her properly. And then she would speak, and the voice would tell him what he needed to know.
\par At last, she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful head towards him once more, and he broke into a run, a question burning in him, but as he opened his lips to ask it, she vanished.
\par Though the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished image was still imprinted on his retinas; it obscured his vision, brightening when he lowered his eyelids, disorientating him. Now fear came: her presence had meant safety.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Lumos!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited.
\par The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there, listening to the sounds of the forest, to distant crackles of twigs, soft swishes of snow. Was he about to be attacked? Had she enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagin\-
ing that somebody stood beyond the reach of the wandlight, watching him?
\par He held the wand higher. Nobody ran out at him, no flash of green light burst from behind a tree. Why, then, had she led him to this spot?
\par Something gleamed in the light of the wand and Harry spun about, but all that was there was a small, frozen pool, its cracked, black surface glittering as he raised the wand higher to examine it.
\par He moved forwards rather cautiously and looked down. The ice reflected his distorted shadow, and the beam of wandlight, but deep below the thick, misty grey carapace, something else glinted. A great silver cross ...
\par His heart skipped into his mouth: he dropped to his knees at the pool\rquote s edge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red ... it was a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt ..
. the sword of Gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the forest pool.
\par Barely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible? How could it have come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to the place where they were camping? Had some unknown magi
c drawn Hermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had taken to be a Patronus, some kind of guardian of the pool? Or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived, precisely because they were here? In which case, where was the person wh
o
 had wanted to pass it to Harry? Again he directed the wand at the surrounding trees and bushes, searching for a human outline, for the glint of an eye, but he could not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear leavened his exhilaration as he re
turned his atten\-tion to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool.
\par He pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Accio sword.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 

\par It did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy, the sword would have lain on the grou
nd for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice, thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him. He had been in terrible danger, then, and had asked for help.
\par \lquote Help,\rquote  he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool bottom, indifferent, motionless.
\par What was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumbledore had told him the last time he had retrieved the sword? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the Hat. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 And what were the qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry\rquote s head answered him: 
}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 their daring, nerve and chivalry set Gryffindors apart.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air. 
He knew what he had to do. If he was honest with himself, he had thought it might come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice.
\par He glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced, now, that nobody was going to atta
ck him. They had had their chance as he walked alone through the forest, had had plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting.
\par With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing. Where \lquote chivalry\rquote 
 entered into this, he thought ruefully, he was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead.
\par An owl hooted somewhere as he stri
pped off, and he thought with a pang of Hedwig. He was shivering now, his teeth chattering horribly, and yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood there in his underwear, barefooted in the snow. He placed the pouch containing his wand, his moth
er\rquote s letter, the shard of Sirius\rquote s mirror and the old Snitch on top of his clothes, then he pointed Hermione\rquote s wand at the ice.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Diffindo.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par It cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence: the surface of the pool broke and chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled water. As far as Harry could judge, it was not deep, but to retrieve the sword he would have to submerge himself completely.

\par Contemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the water warmer. He stepped to the pool\rquote s edge and placed Hermione\rquote 
s wand on the ground, still lit. Then, trying not to imagine how much colder he was about to become or how violently he would soon be shivering, he jumped.
\par Every pore of his body screamed in protest: the very air in his lungs seemed to freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water. He could hardly breathe; trembling so violently the water lapped over the edges of
 the pool, he felt for the blade with his numb feet. He only wanted to dive once.
\par Harry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second, gasping and shaking, until he told himself that it must be done, gathered all his courage and dived.
\par The cold was agony: it attacked him like fire. His brain itself seemed to have frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached out, groping for the sword. His fingers closed around the hilt; he pulled it upwards.
\par Then something closed tight around his neck. He thought of water weeds, though nothing had brushed him as he dived, and raised his empty hand to free himself. It was not weed: the chain of the Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his wind pip
e.
\par Harry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back to the surface, but merely propelled himself into the rocky side of the pool. Thrashing, suffocating, he scrabbled at the strangling chain, his frozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights
 were popping inside his head, and he was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing he could do, and the arms that closed around his chest were surely Death\rquote s ...
\par Choking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life, he came to, face down in the snow. Somewhere close by, another person was panting and coughing and stagger\-
ing around. Hermione had come again, as she had come when the snake attacked ... yet it did not sound like her, not with those deep coughs, not judging by the weight of the footsteps ...
\par Harry had no strength to lift his head and see his saviour\rquote s identity. All he could do was raise a shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly into his flesh. It was gone: someone had cut him fr
ee. Then a panting voice spoke from over his head.
\par \lquote Are \endash  you \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 mental?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par Nothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given Harry the strength to get up. Shivering violently, he staggered to his feet. There before him stood Ron, fully dressed but
 drenched to the skin, his hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryffindor in one hand and the Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other.
\par \lquote Why the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 hell,\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
 panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, which swung backwards and forwards on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis, \lquote didn\rquote t you take this thing off before you dived?\rquote 
\par Harry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, nothing compared with Ron\rquote s reappearance, he could not believe it. Shuddering with cold, he caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the water\rquote 
s edge and began to pull them on. As he dragged sweater after sweater over his head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him, and yet he had to be real: he had just dived into 
the pool, he had saved Harry\rquote s life.
\par \lquote It was y \endash  you?\rquote  Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his voice weaker than usual due to his near-strangulation.
\par \lquote Well, yeah,\rquote  said Ron, looking slightly confused.
\par \lquote Y \endash  you cast that doe?\rquote

\par Harry put Hagrid\rquote s pouch back around his neck, pulled on a final sweater, stooped to pick up Hermione\rquote s wand and faced Ron again.
\par \lquote How come you\rquote re here?\rquote 
\par Apparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later, if at all.
\par \lquote Well, I\rquote ve \endash  you know \endash  I\rquote ve come back. If \endash \rquote  He cleared his throat. \lquote You know. You still want me.\rquote 
\par There was a pause, in which the subject of Ron\rquote s departure seemed to rise like a wall between them. Yet he was here. He had returned. He had just saved Harry\rquote s life.
\par Ron looked down at his hands. He seemed momentarily surprised to see the things he was holding.
\par \lquote Oh yeah; I got it out,\rquote  he said, rather unnecessarily, holding up the sword for Harry\rquote s inspection. \lquote That\rquote s why you jumped in, right?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote But I don\rquote t understand. How did you get here? How did you find us?\rquote 
\par \lquote Long story,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I\rquote ve been looking for you for hours, it\rquote s a big forest, isn\rquote t it? And I was just thinking I\rquote 
d have to kip under a tree and wait for morning when I saw that deer coming, and you following.\rquote 
\par \lquote You didn\rquote t see anyone else?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I \endash \rquote 
\par But he hesitated, glancing at two trees growing close together some yards away.
\par \lquote \endash  I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the pool at the time, because you\rquote d gone in and you hadn\rquote t come up, so I wasn\rquote t going to make a detour to \endash  hey!\rquote 
\par Harry was already hurrying to the place Ron had indicated. The two oaks grew cl
ose together; there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at eye-level, an ideal place to see, but not be seen. The ground around the roots, however, was free of snow and Harry could see no sign of footprints. He walked back to where Ron stood
 waiting, still holding the sword and the Horcrux.
\par \lquote Anything there?\rquote  Ron asked.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote So how did the sword get in that pool?\rquote 
\par \lquote Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there.\rquote 
\par They both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied hilt glinting a little in the light from Hermione\rquote s wand.
\par \lquote You reckon this is the real one?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote One way to find out, isn\rquote t there?\rquote  said Harry.
\par The Horcrux was still swinging from Ron\rquote s hand. 
The locket was twitching slightly. Harry knew that the thing inside it was agitated again. It had sensed the presence of the sword and had tried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it. Now was not the time for long discussions; now was the moment to
 destroy the locket once and for all. Harry looked around, holding Hermione\rquote s wand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree.
\par \lquote Come here,\rquote  he said, and he led the way, brushed snow from the rock\rquote s surface and held out his hand for the Horcrux. When Ron offered the sword, however, Harry shook his head.
\par \lquote No, you should do it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Me?\rquote  said Ron, looking shocked. \lquote Why?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it\rquote s supposed to be you.\rquote 
\par He was not being kind or gener
ous. As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts.
\par \lquote I\rquote m going to open it,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote and you stab it. Straight away, OK? Because whatever\rquote s in there will put up a fight. The bit of Riddle in the diary tried to kill me.\rquote 
\par \lquote How are you going to open it?\rquote  asked Ron. He looked terrified.
\par \lquote I\rquote m going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue,\rquote 
 said Harry. The answer came so readily to his lips that he thought that he had always known it, deep down: perhaps it had taken his recent encounter with Nagini to make him realise it. He looked at the serpentine \lquote S\rquote 
, inlaid with glittering green stones: it was easy to visualise it as a minuscule snake, curled upon the cold rock.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Ron, \lquote no, don\rquote t open it! I\rquote m serious!\rquote 
\par \lquote Why not?\rquote  asked Harry. \lquote Let\rquote s get rid of the damn thing, it\rquote s been months \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t, Harry, I\rquote m serious \endash  you do it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But why?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because that thing\rquote s bad for me!\rquote  said Ron, backing away from the locket on the rock. \lquote I can\rquote t handle it! I\rquote 
m not making excuses, Harry, for what I was like, but it affects me worse than it affected you and Hermione, it made me think stuff, stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse, I can\rquote t explain it, and then I\rquote 
d take it off and I\rquote d get my head on straight again, and then I\rquote d have to put the effing thing back on \endash  I can\rquote t do it, Harry!\rquote 
\par He had backed away, the sword dragging at his side, shaking his head.
\par \lquote You can do it,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote you can! You\rquote ve just got the sword, I know it\rquote s supposed to be you who uses it. Please, just get rid of it, Ron.\rquote 
\par The sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. Ron swallowed, then, still breathing hard through his long nose, moved back towards the rock.
\par \lquote Tell me when,\rquote  he croaked.
\par \lquote On three,\rquote  said Harry, looking back down at the locket and narrowing his eyes, concentrating on the letter \lquote S\rquote , imagining a serpent, while the contents of the lo
cket rattled like a trapped cockroach. It would have been easy to pity it, except that the cut around Harry\rquote s neck still burned.

\par Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark and handsome as Tom Riddle\rquote s eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and slit-pupilled.
\par \lquote Stab,\rquote  said Harry, holding the locket steady on the rock.

\par On the ground in front of them, Ron\rquote s face filled with anguish: he raised the sword high, his arms shaking.
\par \lquote Do it, Ron!\rquote  Harry yelled.
\par Ron looked towards him and Harry thought he saw a trace of scarlet in his eyes.
\par \lquote Ron \endash ?\rquote 
\par The sword flashed, plunged: Harry threw himself out of the way, there was a clang of metal and a long, drawn-out scream. Harry whirled round, slipping in the snow, wand held ready to defend himself: but there was nothing to fight.
\par The monstrous versions of himself and Hermione were gone: there was only Ron, standing there with the sword held slackly in his hand, looking down at the shattered remains of the locket on the flat rock.
\par Slowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing what to say or do. Ron was breathing heavily. His eyes were no longer red at all, but their normal blue; they were also wet.
\par Harry stooped, pretending he had not seen, and picked up the broken Horcrux. Ron had pierced the glass in both windows: Riddle\rquote s eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking slightly. The thing that had
 lived in the Horcrux had vanished; torturing Ron had been its final act.
\par The sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to his knees, his head in his arms. He was shaking, but not, Harry realised, from cold. Harry crammed the broken locket into his pock
et, knelt down beside Ron and placed a hand, cautiously, on his shoulder. He took it as a good sign that Ron did not throw it off.
\par \lquote After you left,\rquote  he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron\rquote s face was hidden, \lquote she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn\rquote

\par \lquote She\rquote s like my sister,\rquote  he went on. \lquote I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It\rquote s always been like that. I thought you knew.\rquote 
\par Ron did not respond, but turned his face away from Harry and wiped his nose noisily on his sleeve. Harry got to his feet again and walked to where Ron\rquote 
s enormous rucksack lay, yards away, discarded as Ron had run towards the pool to save Harry from drowning. He hoisted it on to his own back and walked back to Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry approached, eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed.

\par \lquote That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was,\rquote  Ron mumbled.
\par \lquote Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I\rquote ve been trying to tell you that for years.\rquote 
\par Simultaneously they walked forwards and hugged, Harry gripping the still sopping back of Ron\rquote s jacket.
\par \lquote And now,\rquote  said Harry, as they broke apart, \lquote all we\rquote ve got to do is find the tent again.\rquote 
\par But it was not difficult. Though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed lengthy, with Ron by his side the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time. Harry could not wait to wake Hermione, and it was with quickening excite\-
ment that he entered the tent, Ron lagging a little behind him.
\par It was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, the only illumination the bluebell flames still shimmering in a bowl on the floor. Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under her blankets, and did not move until Harry had said her name several times.

\par She appeared not to have heard him.
\par \lquote One thing I would like to know, though,\rquote  she said, fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over Ron\rquote s head. \lquote How exactly did you find us tonight? That\rquote s important. Once we know, we\rquote ll be able to make sure we\rquote 
re not visited by anyone else we don\rquote t want to see.\rquote 
\par Ron glared at her, then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket.
\par \lquote This.\rquote 
\par She had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them.
\par \lquote The Deluminator?\rquote  she asked, so surprised she forgot to look cold and fierce.
\par \lquote It doesn\rquote t just turn the lights on and off,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I don\rquote t know how it works or why it happened then and not any other time, because I\rquote ve been wanting to come back ever since I left. But I was listening to
 the radio, really early on Christmas morning, and I heard ... I heard you.\rquote 
\par He was looking at Hermione.
\par \lquote You heard me on the radio?\rquote  she asked incredulously.
\par \lquote No, I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice,\rquote  he held up the Deluminator again, \lquote came out of this.\rquote 
\par \lquote And what exactly did I say?\rquote  asked Hermione, her tone some\-where between scepticism and curiosity.
\par \lquote My name. \'93Ron.\'94 And you said ... something about a wand \'85\rquote 
\par Hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. Harry remembered: it had been the first time Ron\rquote s name had been said aloud by either of them since the day he had left; Hermione had mentioned it when talking about repairing Harry\rquote s wand.
\par \lquote So I took it out,\rquote  Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator, \lquote and it didn\rquote t seem different, or anything, but I was sure I\rquote 
d heard you. So I clicked it. And the light went out in my room, but another light appeared right outside the window.\rquote 
\par Ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes focused on something neither Harry nor Hermione could see.
\par \lquote It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light you get around a Portkey, you know?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry and Hermione together, automatically.
\par \lquote I knew this was it,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I grabbed my stuff and packed it, then I put on my rucksack and went out into the garden.
\par \lquote The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and when I came out it bobbed along a bit and I followed it behind the shed and then it ... well, it went inside me.\rquote 
\par \lquote Sorry?\rquote  said Harry, sure he had not heard correctly.
\par \lquote It sort of floated towards me,\rquote  said Ron, illustrating the move\-ment with his free index finger, \lquote right to my chest, and then \endash  it just went straight through. It was here,\rquote  he touched a point close to his heart, 
\lquote I could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me I knew what I was supposed to do, I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came out on the side of a hill. There was snow everywhere \'85\rquote 
\par \lquote We were there,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote We spent two nights there, and the second night I kept thinking I could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, well, that would\rquote ve been me,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Your protective spells work, anyway, because I couldn\rquote t see you and I couldn\rquote t hear you. I was sure you were around, tho
ugh, so in the end I got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought you\rquote d have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, actually,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote We\rquote ve been Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as an extra precaution. And we left really early, because, as Harry says, we\rquote d heard somebody blundering around.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I stayed on that hill all day,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I kept hoping you\rquote d appear. But when it started to get dark I knew I must have missed you, so I clicked the Del
uminator again, the blue light came out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here, in these woods. I still couldn\rquote t see you, so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end \endash 
 and Harry did. Well, I saw the doe first, obviously.\rquote 
\par \lquote You saw the what?\rquote  said Hermione sharply.
\par They explained what had happened, and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the pool unfolded, Hermione frowned from one to the other of them, concentrating so hard she forgot to keep her limbs locked together.
\par \lquote But it must have been a Patronus!\rquote  she said. \lquote Couldn\rquote t you see who was casting it? Didn\rquote t you see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can\rquote t believe this! Then what happened?\rquote 
\par Ron explaine
d how he had watched Harry jump into the pool and had waited for him to resurface; how he had realised that something was wrong, dived in and saved Harry, then returned for the sword. He got as far as the opening of the locket, then hesitated, and Harry c
ut in.
\par \lquote \endash  and Ron stabbed it with the sword.\rquote 
\par \lquote And ... and it went? Just like that?\rquote  she whispered.
\par \lquote Well, it \endash  it screamed,\rquote  said Harry, with half a glance at Ron. \lquote Here.\rquote 
\par He threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it up and examined its punctured windows.
\par Deciding that it was at last safe to do so, Harry removed the Shield Charm with a wave of Hermione\rquote s wand and turned to Ron.
\par \lquote Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare wand?\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Ron, who had been watching Hermione examin\-ing the locket. \lquote Oh \endash  oh yeah.\rquote 
\par He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short, dark wand out of its pocket. \lquote Here. I figured it\rquote s always handy to have a back-up.\rquote 
\par \lquote You were right,\rquote  said Harry, holding out his hand. \lquote Mine\rquote s broken.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re kidding?\rquote  Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got to her feet, and he looked apprehensive again.
\par Hermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag, then climbed back into her bed and settled down without another word.
\par Ron passed Harry the new wand.
\par \lquote About the best you could hope for, I think,\rquote  murmured Harry.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Could\rquote ve been worse. Remember those birds she set on me?\rquote 
\par \lquote I still haven\rquote t ruled it out,\rquote  came Hermione\rquote s muffled voice from beneath her blankets, but Harry saw Ron smiling slightly as he pulled his maroon pyjamas out of his rucksack.

In fact, when all three of them were together Harry felt like the only non-mourner at a poorly attended funeral. During those few moments he spent alone with Harry (collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms), however, Ron became shamele

\rquote s on our side. One Horcrux down, mate!\rquote 
\par Bolstered by the destruction of the locket, they set to debating the possible locations of the other Horcruxes, and even though they ha
d discussed the matter so often before, Harry felt optimistic, certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first. Hermione\rquote 
s sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits: the sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery of Gryffindor\rquote s sword, and above all, Ron\rquote 
s return, made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face.
\par Late in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione\rquote s baleful presence again, and under the pretence of scouring the bar
e hedges for non-existent blackberries, they continued their on-going exchange of news. Harry had finally managed to tell Ron the whole story of his and Hermione\rquote s various wanderings, right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric
\rquote s Hollow; Ron was now filling Harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider wizarding world during his weeks away.
\par \lquote ... and how did you find out about the Taboo?\rquote  he asked Harry, after explaining the many desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the Ministry.
\par \lquote The what?\rquote 
\par \lquote You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who\rquote s name!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yeah. Well, it\rquote s just a bad habit we\rquote ve slipped into,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote But I haven\rquote t got a problem calling him V\emdash \rquote 
\par \lquote NO!\rquote  roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione (nose buried in a book at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them. \lquote Sorry,\rquote  said Ron, wrenching Harry back out of the brambles, \lquote but the name\rquote 
s been jinxed, Harry, that\rquote s how they track people! Using his name breaks protective enchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance \endash  it\rquote s how they found us in Tottenham Court Road!\rquote 
\par \lquote Because we used his }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 name?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par \lquote Exactly! You\rquote ve got to give them credit, it makes sense. It was only people who were serious about standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who ever dared use it. Now they\rquote ve put a Taboo on it, anyone who says it is trackable \endash 
 quick and easy way to find Order members! They nearly got Kingsley \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re kidding?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said, but he fought his way out. He\rquote s on the run now, just like us.\rquote  Ron scratched his chin thoughtfully with the end of his wand. \lquote You don\rquote 
t reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe?\rquote 
\par \lquote His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yeah ...\rquote 
\par They moved further along the hedge, away from the tent and Hermione.
\par \lquote Harry ... you don\rquote t reckon it could\rquote ve been Dumbledore?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore what?\rquote 
\par Ron looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, \lquote Dumbledore ... the doe? I mean,\rquote  Ron was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, \lquote he had the real sword last, didn\rquote t he?\rquote 
\par Harry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing behind the question. The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to them, that he was watching over them, would have been inexpressibly comforting. He shook his head.
\par \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s dead,\rquote  he said. \lquote I saw it happen, I saw the body. He\rquote s definitely gone. Anyway, his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe.\rquote 
\par \lquote Patronuses can change, though, can\rquote t they?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Tonks\rquote s changed, didn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn\rquote t he show himself? Why wouldn\rquote t he just hand us the sword?\rquote 
\par \lquote Search me,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Same reason he didn\rquote t give it to you while he was alive? Same reason he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kids\rquote  stories?\rquote 
\par \lquote Which is what?\rquote  asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the face, desperate for the answer.
\par \lquote I dunno,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Sometimes I\rquote ve thought, when I\rquote ve been a bit hacked off, he was having a laugh or \endash  or he just wanted to make it more difficult. But I don\rquote 
t think so, not any more. He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn\rquote t he? He \endash  well,\rquote  Ron\rquote s ears turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded with his toe, 
\lquote he must\rquote ve known I\rquote d run out on you.\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  Harry corrected him. \lquote He must\rquote ve known you\rquote d always want to come back.\rquote 
\par Ron looked grateful, but still awkward. Partly to change the subject, Harry said, \lquote Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about him?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yeah,\rquote  said Ron at once, \lquote people are talking about it quite a lot. \rquote Course, if things were different, it\rquote d be huge news, Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald, but now it\rquote 
s just something to laugh about for people who didn\rquote t like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke. I don\rquote t know that it\rquote s such a big deal, though. He was really young when they 
\endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Our age,\rquote  said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in his face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing the subject.
\par A large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry took aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous night, which Hermione had since condescended to examine, and had decided was made of blackthorn.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Engorgio.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par The spider gave a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web. Harry tried again. This time the spider grew slightly larger.
\par \lquote Stop that,\rquote  said Ron sharply. \lquote I\rquote m sorry I said Dumbledore was young, OK?\rquote 
\par Harry had forgotten Ron\rquote s hatred of spiders.
\par \lquote Sorry \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 reducio.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par The spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the black\-thorn wand. Every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt intrusively unfamil
iar, like having somebody else\rquote s hand sewn to the end of his arm.
\par \lquote You just need to practise,\rquote  said Hermione, who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. \lquote It\rquote s all a matter of confidence, Harry.\rquote 

\par He knew why she wanted it to be all right: she still felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprang to his lips: that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he would h
ave hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more.
\par All three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took fir
st watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet: but his magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, after many nervous
 glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try to tune it.
\par \lquote There\rquote s this one programme,\rquote  he told Harry in a low voice, \lquote that tells the news like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who\rquote s side and are following the Ministry line, but this one ... you wait \rquote 
til you hear it, it\rquote s great. Only they can\rquote t do it every night, they have to keep changing locations in case they\rquote re raided, and you need a password to tune in ... trouble is, I missed the last one ...\rquote 
\par He drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand, muttering random words under his breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly fearing an angry outburst, but for all the notice she took of him he might not have been there. For ten minut
es or so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione turned the pages of her book, and Harry continued to practise with the blackthorn wand.
\par Finally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron ceased his tapping at once.
\par \lquote If it\rquote s annoying you, I\rquote ll stop!\rquote  he told Hermione nervously.
\par Hermione did not deign to respond, but approached Harry.
\par \lquote We need to talk,\rquote  she said.
\par He looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that there was a chapter on him in there; he was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita\rquote s version of his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermione\rquote 
s answer, however, was completely unexpected.
\par \lquote I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.\rquote 
\par He stared at her.
\par \lquote Sorry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Xenophilius Lovegood. Luna\rquote s father. I want to go and talk to him!\rquote 
\par \lquote Er \endash  why?\rquote 
\par She took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said, \lquote It\rquote s that mark, the mark in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Beedle the Bard. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

s unwilling eyes and he saw a photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore\rquote s familiar thin, slanting writing. He hated seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had written those words, that they ha
d not been Rita\rquote s invention.
\par \lquote The signature,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Look at the signature, Harry!\rquote 
\par He obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking more closely with the aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the \lquote A\rquote  of Albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 The Tales of Beedle the Bard.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par \lquote Er \endash  what are you \endash ?\rquote  said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with a look and turned back to Harry.
\par \lquote It keeps cropping up, doesn\rquote t it?\rquote  she said. \lquote I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald\rquote s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric\rquote 
s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can\rquote t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means \endash  I don\rquote t even know whether Grindelwald\rquote s still alive \endash 
 but we can ask Mr Lovegood. He was wearing the symbol at the wedding. I\rquote m sure this is important, Harry!\rquote 
\par Harry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense, eager face and then out into the surrounding darkness, thinking. After a long pause, he said, \lquote Hermione, we don\rquote t need another Godric\rquote 
s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore left me }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 The Tales of Beedle the Bard, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Here we go again!\rquote  Harry felt slightly exasperated. \lquote We keep trying to convince ourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,\rquote  piped up Ron. \lquote I think Hermione\rquote s right, I think we ought to go and see Lovegood.\rquote 
\par Harry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron\rquote s support of Hermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune.
\par \lquote It won\rquote t be like Godric\rquote s Hollow,\rquote  Ron added, \lquote Lovegood\rquote s on your side, Harry, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 The Quibbler\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par \lquote I\rquote m sure this is important!\rquote  said Hermione earnestly.
\par \lquote But don\rquote t you think, if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he died?\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe ... maybe it\rquote s something you need to find out for yourself,\rquote  said Hermione, with a faint air of clutching at straws.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Ron sycophantically, \lquote that makes sense.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, it doesn\rquote t,\rquote  snapped Hermione, \lquote but I still think we ought to talk to Mr Lovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Godric\rquote s Hollow? Harry, I\rquote m sure we ought to know about this!\rquote 
\par \lquote I think we should vote on it,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Those in favour of going to see Lovegood \endash \rquote 
\par His hand flew into the air before Hermione\rquote s. Her lips quivered suspiciously as she raised her own.
\par \lquote Outvoted, Harry, sorry,\rquote  said Ron, clapping him on the back.
\par \lquote Fine,\rquote  said Harry, half-amused, half-irritated. \lquote Only, once we\rquote ve seen Lovegood, let\rquote s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? Where do the Lovegoods live, anyway? Do either of you know?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, they\rquote re not far from my place,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote I dunno exactly where, but Mum and Dad always point towards the hills whenever they mention them. Shouldn\rquote t be hard to find.\rquote 
\par When Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his voice.
\par \lquote You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.\rquote 
\par \lquote All\rquote s fair in love and war,\rquote  said Ron brightly, \lquote and this is a bit of both. Cheer up, it\rquote s the Christmas holidays, Luna\rquote ll be home!\rquote 
\par They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St Catchpole from the breezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning. From their high vantage point, the village looked like a collection of toy houses
 in the great, slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks between clouds. They stood for a minute or two looking towards The Burrow, their hands shadowing their eyes, but all they could make out were the high hedges and trees of the orc
hard, which afforded the crooked little house protection from Muggle eyes.
\par \lquote It\rquote s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Well, it\rquote s not like you haven\rquote t just seen them. You were there for Christmas,\rquote  said Hermione coldly.
\par \lquote I wasn\rquote t at The Burrow!\rquote  said Ron, with an incredulous laugh. \lquote Do you think I was going to go back there and tell them all I\rquote d walked out on you? Yeah, Fred and George would\rquote ve been great about it. And Ginny, she
\rquote d have been really understanding.\rquote

\par \lquote Bill and Fleur\rquote s new place. Shell Cottage. Bill\rquote s always been decent to me. He \endash  he wasn\rquote t impressed when he heard what I\rquote d done, but he didn\rquote 
t go on about it. He knew I was really sorry. None of the rest of the family know I was there. Bill told Mum he and Fleur weren\rquote t going home for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alone. You know, first holiday after they were married. I don
\rquote t think Fleur minded. You know how much she hates Celestina Warbeck.\rquote 
\par Ron turned his back on The Burrow.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s try up here,\rquote  he said, leading the way over the top of the hill.
\par They walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione\rquote s insistence, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak. The cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one small cottage, which seemed deserted.
\par \lquote Do you think it\rquote s theirs, and they\rquote ve gone away for Christmas?\rquote  said Hermione, peering through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. Ron snorted.
\par \lquote Listen, I\rquote ve got a feeling you\rquote d be able to tell who lived there if you looked through the Lovegoods\rquote  window. Let\rquote s try the next lot of hills.\rquote 
\par So they Disapparated a few miles further north.
\par \lquote Aha!\rquote  shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and clothes. Ron was pointing upwards, towar
ds the top of the hill on which they had appeared, where a most strange-looking house rose vertically against the sky, a great, black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky. \lquote That\rquote s got to be Luna\rquote 
s house, who else would live in a place like that? It looks like a giant rook!\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s nothing like a bird,\rquote  said Hermione, frowning at the tower.
\par \lquote I was talking about a chess rook,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote A castle to you.\rquote 
\par Ron\rquote s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first. When Harry and Hermione caught up with him, panting and clutching stitches in their sides, they found him grinning broadly.
\par \lquote It\rquote s theirs,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Look.\rquote

\par The gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in the oran
ge, radish-like fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings. Harry thought he recognised a Snargaluff, and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. Two aged crab-apple trees, bent with the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavy with berry-sized red fruits and bus
hy crowns of white-beaded mistletoe, stood sentinel on either side of the front door. A little owl with a slightly flattened, hawk-like head peered down at them from one of the branches.
\par \lquote You\rquote d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote it\rquote s you Mr Lovegood wants to help, not us.\rquote 
\par He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag. She then rapped three times on the thick, black door, which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped like an eagle.
\par Barely 
ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there stood Xenophilius Lovegood, barefooted and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt. His long, white, candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt. Xenophilius had been positively dapper at Bill 
and Fleur\rquote s wedding by comparison.
\par \lquote What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?\rquote  he cried, in a high-pitched, querulous voice, looking first at Hermione, then at Ron, and finally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect, comical \lquote O\rquote .
\par \lquote Hello, Mr Lovegood,\rquote  said Harry, holding out his hand. \lquote I\rquote m Harry, Harry Potter.\rquote 
\par Xenophilius did not take Harry\rquote s hand, although the eye that was not pointing inwards at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harry\rquote s forehead.
\par \lquote Would it be OK if we came in?\rquote  asked Harry. \lquote There\rquote s some\-thing we\rquote d like to ask you.\rquote 
\par \lquote I ... I\rquote m not sure that\rquote s advisable,\rquote  whispered Xenophilius. He swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden. \lquote Rather a shock ... my word ... I ... I\rquote m afraid I don\rquote t really think I ought to \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote It won\rquote t take long,\rquote  said Harry, slightly disappointed by this less-than-warm welcome.
\par \lquote I \endash  oh, all right then. Come in, quickly. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Quickly!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par They were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door shut behind them. They were standing in the mo
st peculiar kitchen Harry had ever seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that it felt like being inside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to fit the walls: the stove, the sink and the cupboards, and all of it had been painted with flowers, ins
ects and birds in bright primary colours. Harry thought he recognised Luna\rquote s style: the effect, in such an enclosed space, was slightly overwhelming.
\par In the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase led to the upper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing.
\par \lquote You\rquote d better come up,\rquote  said Xenophilius, still looking extremely uncomfortable, and he led the way.
\par The room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace, and as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller, and entirely round, the room somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement on the unfor\-
gettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth comprised of 
centuries of hidden objects. There were piles upon piles of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of creatures Harry did not recognise, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung from the ceiling.
\par Luna was not there: the thing that was m
aking such a racket was a wooden object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels. It looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of old shelves, but after a moment Harry deduced that it was an old-fashioned printing press due to the fac
t that it was churning out }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Quibblers.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par \lquote Excuse me,\rquote  said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized a grubby tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers, which all tumbled on to the floor, and threw it over the press, somewhat m
uffling the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry.
\par \lquote Why have you come here?\rquote 
\par Before Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out a small cry of shock.
\par \lquote Mr Lovegood \endash  what\rquote s that?\rquote 
\par She was pointing at an enormous, grey spiral horn, not unlike that of a unicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into the room.
\par \lquote It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack,\rquote  said Xenophilius.
\par \lquote No it isn\rquote t!\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Hermione,\rquote  muttered Harry, embarrassed, \lquote now\rquote s not the moment \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But Harry, it\rquote s an Erumpent horn! It\rquote s a Class B Tradeable Material and it\rquote s an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have in a house!\rquote 
\par \lquote How d\rquote you know it\rquote s an Erumpent horn?\rquote  asked Ron, edging away from the horn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter of the room.
\par \lquote There\rquote s a description in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
Mr Lovegood, you need to get rid of it straight away, don\rquote t you know it can explode at the slightest touch?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Crumple-Horned Snorkack,\rquote  said Xenophilius very clearly, a mulish look upon his face, \lquote is a shy and highly magical creature, and its horn \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Mr Lovegood, I recognise the grooved markings around the base, that\rquote s an Erumpent horn and it\rquote s incredibly dangerous \endash  I don\rquote t know where you got it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I bought it,\rquote  said Xenophilius dogmatically, \lquote two weeks ago, from a delightful young wizard who knew of my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now,\rquote  he said, turning to Harry, \lquote 
why exactly have you come here, Mr Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote We need some help,\rquote  said Harry, before Hermione could start again.
\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  said Xenophilius. \lquote Help. Hm.\rquote  His good eye moved again to Harry\rquote s scar. He seemed simultaneously terrified and mesmerised. \lquote Yes. The thing is ... helping Harry Potter ... rather dangerous \'85\rquote 
\par \lquote Aren\rquote t you the one who keeps telling everyone it\rquote s their first duty to help Harry?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote In that magazine of yours?\rquote 
\par Xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still banging and clattering beneath the tablecloth.
\par \lquote Er \endash  yes, I have expressed that view. However \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  that\rquote s for everyone else to do, not you personally?\rquote  said Ron.
\par Xenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between the three of them. Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Luna?\rquote  asked Hermione. \lquote Let\rquote s see what she thinks.\rquote 
\par Xenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. Finally he said, in a shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press, \lquote Luna is down at the stream, fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She ... she will like to see you. I
\rquote ll go and call her and then \endash  yes, very well. I shall try to help you.\rquote 
\par He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front door open and close. They looked at each other.
\par \lquote Cowardly old wart,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Luna\rquote s got ten times his guts.\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s probably worried about what\rquote ll happen to them if the Death Eaters find out I was here,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Well, I agree with Ron,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Awful old hypocrite, telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm out of it himself. And for heaven\rquote s sake keep away from that horn.\rquote 
\par Harry crossed to the window on the far side of the room. He could see a stream, a thin, glittering ribbon lying far below them at the base of the hill. They were very high up; a bird
 fluttered past the window as he stared in the direction of The Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills. Ginny was over there somewhere. They were closer to each other today than they had been since Bill and Fleur\rquote 
s wedding, but she could have no idea he was gazing towards her now, thinking of her. He supposed he ought to be glad of it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, Xenophilius\rquote s attitude proved that.
\par He turned away from the window and his gaze fell upon another peculiar object,
 standing upon the cluttered, curved sideboard: a stone bust of a beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most bizarre-looking headdress. Two objects that resembled golden ear-trumpets curved out from the sides. A tiny pair of glittering blue wings 
was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around her forehead.
\par \lquote Look at this,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Fetching,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Surprised he didn\rquote t wear that to the wedding.\rquote 
\par They heard the front door close and a moment later Xenophilius had climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin legs now encased in Wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted teacups and a steaming teapot.
\par \lquote Ah, you have spotted my pet invention,\rquote  he said, shoving the tray into Hermione\rquote s arms and joining Harry at the statue\rquote s side. \lquote Modelled, fittingly enough, upon the head of the beautiful Rowena Ravenclaw. }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Wit beyond measure is man\rquote s greatest treasure!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par He indicated the objects like ear-trumpets.
\par \lquote These are the Wrackspurt siphons \endash  to remove all sources of distraction from the thinker\rquote s immediate area. Here,\rquote  he pointed out the tiny wings, \lquote a Billywig propeller, to induce an elevated frame of mind. Finally,
\rquote  he pointed to the orange radish, \lquote the Dirigible Plum, so as to enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary.\rquote 
\par Xenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which Hermione had managed to balance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables.
\par \lquote May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?\rquote  said Xenophilius. \lquote We make it ourselves.\rquote  As he started to pour out the drink, which was as deeply purple as beetroot juice, he added, \lquote 
Luna is down beyond Bottom Bridge, she is most excited that you are here. She ought not to be too long, she has caught nearly enough Plimpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and help yourselves to sugar.
\par \lquote Now,\rquote  he removed a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat down, his wellingtoned legs crossed, \lquote how may I help you, Mr Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encouragingly, \lquote it\rquote s about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at Bill and Fleur\rquote s wedding, Mr Lovegood. We wondered what it meant.\rquote 
\par Xenophilius raised his eyebrows.
\par \lquote Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?\rquote

\par \lquote Sorry?\rquote  said Hermione, sounding confused.
\par \lquote Those are the Deathly Hallows,\rquote  said Xenophilius.
\par He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of parchment from between more books.
\par \lquote The Elder Wand,\rquote  he said, and he drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment. \lquote The Resurrection Stone,\rquote  he said, and he added a circle on top of the line. \lquote The Cloak of Invisibility,\rquote 
 he finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbol that so intrigued Hermione. \lquote Together,\rquote  he said, \lquote the Deathly Hallows.\rquote 
\par \lquote But there\rquote s no mention of the words \'93Deathly Hallows\'94 in the story,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Well, of course not,\rquote  said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. \lquote That is a children\rquote s tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who understand t
hese matters, however, recognise that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death.\rquote 
\par There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window. Already the sun was low in the sky.
\par \lquote Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,\rquote  he said quietly.
\par \lquote When you say \'93master of Death\'94 \endash \rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Master,\rquote  said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. \lquote Conqueror. Vanquisher. Whichever term you prefer.\rquote

cloak of invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to say, it is not a travelling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else woven from Demiguise hair, which
 will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells 
are cast at it. How many cloaks have you ever seen like }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 that, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Miss Granger?\rquote 

\par Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more confused than ever. She, Harry and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry knew that they were all thinking th
e same thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one Xenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment.
\par \lquote Exactly,\rquote  said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument. \lquote None of you have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be immeasurably rich, would he not?\rquote 
\par He glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged with the faintest trace of pink.

\par \lquote Yes, you could,\rquote  said Xenophilius. \lquote I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little.\rquote 
\par \lquote So the Elder Wand,\rquote  said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort, \lquote you think that exists too?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,\rquote  said Xenophilius. \lquote The Elder Wand is the Hallow that is most easily traced, because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand.\rquote 
\par \lquote Which is what?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner, if he is to be truly master of it,\rquote  said Xenophilius. \lquote 
Surely you have heard of the way the wand came to Egbert the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after his son, Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from Barnabas 
Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of wizarding history.\rquote 
\par Harry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she did not contradict him.
\par \lquote So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote Alas, who knows?\rquote  said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window. \lquote 
Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.\rquote 
\par There was a pause. Finally Hermione asked stiffly, \lquote Mr Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?\rquote 
\par Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry\rquote s memory, but he could not locate it. Peverell ... he had heard that name before ...
\par \lquote But you have been misleading me, young woman!\rquote  said Xenophilius, now sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. \lquote 
I thought you were new to the Hallows Quest! Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything \endash  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 everything!}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Who are the Peverells?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric\rquote s Hollow,\rquote  said Hermione, still watching Xenophilius. \lquote Ignotus Peverell.\rquote 
\par \lquote Exactly!\rquote  said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedantically. \lquote The sign of the Deathly Hallows on Ignotus\rquote s grave is conclusive proof!\rquote 
\par \lquote Of what?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers, Antioch, Cadmus and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the Hallows!\rquote 
\par With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray and headed for the spiral staircase.
\par \lquote You will stay for dinner?\rquote  he called, as he vanished downstairs again. \lquote Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimpy soup.\rquote 
\par \lquote Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St Mungo\rquote s,\rquote  said Ron under his breath.
\par Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen downstairs before speaking.
\par \lquote What do you think?\rquote  he asked Hermione.
\par \lquote Oh, Harry,\rquote  she said wearily, \lquote it\rquote s a pile of utter rubbish. This can\rquote t be what the sign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a waste of time.\rquote

\par \lquote You don\rquote t believe it, either?\rquote  Harry asked him.
\par \lquote Nah, that story\rquote s just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn\rquote t it? \'93Don\rquote t go looking for trouble, don\rquote t pick fights, don\rquote t go messing around with stuff that\rquote 
s best left alone! Just keep your head down, mind your own business and you\rquote ll be OK.\'94 Come to think of it,\rquote  Ron added, \lquote maybe that story\rquote s why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.\rquote 
\par \lquote What are you talking about?\rquote 
\par \lquote One of those superstitions, isn\rquote t it? \'93May-born witches will marry Muggles.\'94 \'93Jinx by twilight, undone by midnight.\'94 \'93Wand of elder, never prosper.\'94 You must\rquote ve heard them. My mum\rquote s full of them.\rquote 

\par \lquote Harry and I were raised by Muggles,\rquote  Hermione reminded him, \lquote we were taught different superstitions.\rquote 
 She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen. The one good thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed to have made her forget that she was annoyed with Ron. \lquote I think you\rquote re right,\rquote 
 she told him. \lquote It\rquote s just a morality tale, it\rquote s obvious which gift is best, which one you\rquote d choose \endash \rquote 
\par The three of them spoke at the same time; Hermione said, \lquote the Cloak,\rquote  Ron said, \lquote the wand,\rquote  and Harry said, \lquote the stone.\rquote 
\par They looked at each other, half-surprised, half-amused.

ing sceptical. \lquote You know, the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful wands for hundreds of years.\rquote 
\par \lquote There have?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par Hermione looked exasperated: the expression was so endear\-ingly familiar that Harry and Ron grinned at each other.
\par \lquote The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under dif\-ferent names through the centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who\rquote s boasting about them. Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but \endash  oh, it\rquote 
s all nonsense. Wands are only as powerful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other people\rquote s.\rquote 
\par \lquote But how do you know,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote that those wands \endash  the Deathstick and the Wand of Destiny \endash  aren\rquote t the same wand, surfacing over the centuries under different names?\rquote 
\par \lquote What, and they\rquote re all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?\rquote  said Ron.
\par Harry laughed: the strange idea that had occurred to him was, after all, ridiculous. His wand, he reminded 
himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by Ollivander, whatever it had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. And if it had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken?
\par \lquote So why would you take the stone?\rquote  Ron asked him.
\par \lquote Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius ... Mad-Eye ... Dumbledore ... my parents ...\rquote 
\par Neither Ron nor Hermione smiled.
\par \lquote But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn\rquote t want to come back, would they?\rquote  said Harry, thinking about the tale they had just heard. \lquote I don\rquote 
t suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?\rquote  he asked Hermione.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  she replied sadly. \lquote I don\rquote t think anyone except Mr Lovegood could kid themselves that\rquote s possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Philosopher\rquote 
s Stone; you know, instead of a stone to make you immortal, a stone to reverse death.\rquote 
\par The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger: it was some\-thing like burning underpants. Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings.
\par \lquote What about the Cloak, though?\rquote  said Ron slowly. \lquote Don\rquote t you realise, he\rquote s right? I\rquote ve got so used to Harry\rquote s Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I\rquote ve never heard of one like Harry
\rquote s. It\rquote s infallible. We\rquote ve never been spotted under it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Of course not \endash  we\rquote re invisible when we\rquote re under it, Ron!\rquote 
\par \lquote But all the stuff he said about other cloaks \endash  and they\rquote re not exactly ten a Knut \endash  you know, is true! It\rquote s never occurred to me before, but I\rquote 
ve heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they\rquote ve got holes in. Harry\rquote s was owned by his dad, so it\rquote s not exactly new, is it, but it\rquote s just ... perfect!\rquote 

\par \lquote Yes, all right, but Ron, the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 stone ..}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 .\rquote 
\par As they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only half listening. Reaching the spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once. His own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above.

\par After a moment\rquote s bewilderment, he realised that it was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he began to climb the stairs.
\par \lquote Harry, what are you doing? I don\rquote t think you should look around when he\rquote s not here!\rquote 
\par But Harry had already reached the next level.
\par Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Neville. They were not moving as the portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about them al
l the same: Harry thought they breathed. What appeared to be fine golden chains wove around the pictures, linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or so, Harry realised that the chains were actually one word, repeated a thousand times 
in golden ink: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 friends ... friends }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Harry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. There was a large photograph beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her. They were hugging. Luna looked ra
ther better-groomed in this picture than Harry had ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty. This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared around.
\par Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with dust. There were no clothes in the wardrobe,
 whose doors stood ajar. The bed had a cold, unfriendly look, as though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched over the nearest window, across a blood-red sky.
\par \lquote What\rquote s wrong?\rquote  Hermione asked, as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could respond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls.
\par \lquote Mr Lovegood,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Where\rquote s Luna?\rquote 
\par \lquote Excuse me?\rquote 
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Luna?\rquote 
\par Xenophilius halted on the top step.
\par \lquote I \endash  I\rquote ve already told you. She is down at Bottom Bridge, fishing for Plimpies.\rquote 
\par \lquote So why have you only laid that tray for four?\rquote 
\par Xenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was the continued chugging of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius\rquote s hands shook.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think Luna\rquote s been here for weeks,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Her clothes are gone, her bed hasn\rquote t been slept in. Where is she? And why do you keep looking out of the window?\rquote 
\par Xenophilius dropped the tray: the bowls bounced and smashed. Harry, Ron and Hermione drew their wands: Xenophilius froze, his hand about to enter his pocket. At that moment, the printing press gave a huge bang and numerous }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Quibblers }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 came streaming across the floor from underneath the tablecloth; the press fell silent at last.

\par Hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr Lovegood.
\par \lquote Harry, look at this.\rquote

Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr Lovegood? Sending an owl to the Ministry?\rquote 
\par Xenophilius licked his lips.
\par \lquote They took my Luna,\rquote  he whispered. \lquote Because of what I\rquote ve been writing. They took my Luna and I don\rquote t know where she is, what they\rquote ve done to her. But they might give her back to me if I \endash  if I \endash

\par \lquote No deal,\rquote  said Ron flatly. \lquote Get out of the way, we\rquote re leaving.\rquote

\par \lquote They will be here at any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not leave.\rquote 
\par He spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the same thing in front of his cot.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t make us hurt you,\rquote  Harry said. \lquote Get out of the way, Mr Lovegood.\rquote 
\par \lquote HARRY!\rquote  Hermione screamed.
\par Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of them looked away from him, Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realised their mistake just in time: he launched himself sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm\rquote 
s way as Xenophilius\rquote s Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent Horn.
\par There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow the room apart: fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions, along with an impenetrable cloud of thick,
 white dust. Harry flew through the air, then crashed to the floor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard Hermione\rquote s scream, Ron\rquote 
s yell and a series of sickening metallic thuds, which told him that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backwards down the spiral stairs.
\par Half-buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself: he could barely breathe or see for dust. Half of the ceiling had fallen in and the end of Luna\rquote s bed was hanging through the hole. The bus
t of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing, fragments of torn parchment were floating through the air and most of the printing press lay on its side, blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another white shape moved clo
se by and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed her finger to her lips.
\par The door downstairs crashed open.
\par \lquote Didn\rquote t I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?\rquote  said a rough voice. \lquote Didn\rquote t I tell you this nutter was just raving as usual?\rquote

\par \lquote There\rquote s someone up there all right, Selwyn,\rquote  said the second man sharply.
\par \lquote It\rquote s Potter, I tell you, it\rquote s Potter!\rquote  sobbed Xenophilius. \lquote Please ... please ... give me Luna, just let me have Luna ...\rquote

\rquote ll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury.\rquote 
\par Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurry\-ings and scrapings: Xenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs.
\par \lquote Come on,\rquote  Harry whispered, \lquote we\rquote ve got to get out of here.\rquote 
\par He started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase. Ron was buried deepest: Harry and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where 
he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs. While Xenophilius\rquote s banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer, Hermione managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm.
\par \lquote All right,\rquote  breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs began to tremble; Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still white with dust. \lquote Do you trust me, Harry?\rquote 
\par Harry nodded.
\par \lquote OK then,\rquote  Hermione whispered, \lquote give me the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, you\rquote re going to put it on.\rquote

\par Harry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing press blocking the stairs was vibrating: Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry did not know what Hermione was waiting for.

\par They put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made them tea. After their narrow escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home, safe, familiar and friendly.
\par \lquote Oh, why did we go there?\rquote  groaned Hermione after a few minutes\rquote  silence. \lquote Harry, you were right, it was Godric\rquote 
s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time! The Deathly Hallows ... such rubbish ... although actually,\rquote  a sudden thought seemed to have struck her, \lquote he might have made it all up, mightn\rquote t he? He probably doesn\rquote t

\par \lquote I don\rquote t think so,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote It\rquote s a damn\rquote  sight harder making stuff up when you\rquote re under stress than you\rquote d think. I found that out when the Snatche
rs caught me. It was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the
 truth, just to keep us talking.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I don\rquote t suppose it matters,\rquote  sighed Hermione. \lquote Even if he was being honest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hang on, though,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn\rquote t it?\rquote

\par \lquote You keep saying that, but one of them can,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Harry\rquote s Invisibility Cloak \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \'93The Tale of the Three Brothers\'94 is a story,\rquote  said Hermione firmly. \lquote A story about how humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we\rquote 
d have everything we need already!\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,\rquote  said Harry, turning the blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers.
\par \lquote There\rquote s no such thing, Harry!\rquote 
\par \lquote You said there have been loads of wands \endash  the Deathstick and whatever they were called \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand\rquote s real, what about the Resurrection Stone?\rquote  Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm. \lquote No magic can raise the dead, and that
\rquote s that!\rquote 
\par \lquote When my wand connected with You-Know-Who\rquote s, it made my mum and dad appear ... and Cedric ...\rquote 
\par \lquote But they weren\rquote t really back from the dead, were they?\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Those kinds of \endash  of pale imitations aren\rquote t the same as truly bringing someone back to life.\rquote 
\par \lquote But she, the girl in the tale, didn\rquote t really come back, did she? The story says that once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, didn\rquote 
t he? He even lived with her for a while \'85\rquote 
\par He saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione\rquote s expression. Then, as she glanced at Ron, Harry realised that it was fear: he had scared her with his talk of living with dead people.
\par \lquote So that Peverell bloke who\rquote s buried in Godric\rquote s Hollow,\rquote  he said hastily, trying to sound robustly sane, \lquote you don\rquote t know anything about him, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. \lquote I looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he\rquote d been anyone famous or done anything important, I\rquote m sure he\rquote 
d be in one of our books. The only place I\rquote ve managed to find the name \'93Peverell\'94 is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Nature\rquote s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

It lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.\rquote 
\par \lquote \'93Extinct in the male line\'94?\rquote  repeated Ron.
\par \lquote It means the name\rquote s died out,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote centuries ago, in the case of the Peverells. They could still have descendants, though, they\rquote d just be called something different.\rquote 
\par And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the sound of the name Peverell: a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and he cried aloud, \lquote Marvolo Gaunt!\rquote

\par \lquote Not really,\rquote  said Harry, trying to remember. \lquote There was nothing fancy on there, as far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open.\rquote

\par \lquote Blimey ... you reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the Hallows?\rquote 
\par \lquote Why not?\rquote  said Harry excitedly. \lquote 
Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that house, and trust me, he wasn

\par \lquote Dumbledore had my Cloak, the night my parents died!\rquote 
\par His voice shook and he could feel the colour in his face, but he did not care. \lquote My mum told Sirius Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric

\par He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of possessing them was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two.
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his neck, his fingers shaking hard.
\par \lquote Read it,\rquote  he told her, pushing his mother\rquote s letter into her hand. \lquote Read it! Dumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn\rquote

\par Something fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair: he had dislodged the Snitch when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him ano

\par But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: all his excitement, all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the darkness, and the glorious spell was broken.
\par \lquote That\rquote s what he\rquote s after.\rquote 
\par The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared.
\par \lquote You-Know-Who\rquote s after the Elder Wand.\rquote 
\par He turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth. It all made sense. Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a very old wand indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of t

\par Voldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have told him }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 The Tales of Beedle the Bard }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 when he was a child, any more than Harry had heard them. Hardly any wizards believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew about them?
\par Harry gazed into the darkness ... if Voldemort had known about the Deathly Hallows, surely he would h
ave sought them, done anything to possess them: three objects that made the possessor master of Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he might not have needed Horcruxes in the first place. Didn\rquote 
t the simple fact that he had taken a Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, demonstrate that he did not know this last great wizarding secret?
\par Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realising its full power, without understanding that it was one of three ... for the wand was the Hallow that could not be hidden, whose existence was best known ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37

\par Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-grey and silver sliding over the face of the white moon. He felt light-headed with amazement at his discoveries.
\par He turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing exactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding Lily\rquote s letter, Ron at her side looking slightly anxious. Didn\rquote t they 
realise how far they had travelled in the last few minutes?
\par \lquote This is it,\rquote  Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own astonished certainty. \lquote This explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real, and I\rquote ve got one \endash  maybe two \endash \rquote

Harry, you\rquote re just getting carried away. Please,\rquote  she said, as he started to speak, \lquote please just answer me this. If the Deathly Hallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about
 them, knew that the person who possessed all three of them would be master of Death \endash  Harry, why wouldn\rquote t he have told you? Why?\rquote 
\par He had his answer ready.
\par \lquote But you said it, Hermione! You\rquote ve got to find out about them for yourself! It\rquote s a Quest!\rquote 
\par \lquote But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods\rquote !\rquote  cried Hermione in exasperation. \lquote I didn\rquote t really believe it!\rquote 
\par Harry took no notice.
\par \lquote Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my strength, take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he\rquote d do.\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, this isn\rquote t a game, this isn\rquote t practice! This is the real thing, and Dumbledore left you very clear instructions: find and destroy the Horcruxes! That symbol doesn\rquote t mean anything, forget the Deathly Hallows, we can
\rquote t afford to get sidetracked \endash \rquote 
\par Harry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over and over in his hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to Hermione that he was right, that the Deathly Hallows were real.
\par She appealed to Ron.
\par \lquote You don\rquote t believe in this, do you?\rquote 
\par Harry looked up. Ron hesitated.
\par \lquote I dunno ... I mean ... bits of it sort of fit together,\rquote  said Ron awkwardly. \lquote But when you look at the whole thing ...\rquote  He took a deep breath. \lquote I think we\rquote re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. That\rquote 
s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe ... maybe we should forget about this Hallows business.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you, Ron,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote I\rquote ll take first watch.\rquote 
\par And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance, turning the action into a fierce full stop.
\par But Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken possession of him, and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his mind: the wand, the stone and the Cloak, if he could just possess them all ...
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 I open at the close ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 but what was the close? Why couldn\rquote 
t he have the stone now? If only he had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in person ... and Harry murmured words to the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not open ...
\par And the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where was Voldemort searching now? Harry wished his scar would burn and show him Voldemort\rquote s thoughts, because for the first time 
ever, he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same thing ... Hermione would not like that idea; of course ... but then, she did not believe ... Xenophilius had been right, in a way ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Limited. Narrow. Close-minded. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 The truth was that she was scar
ed of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, especially of the Resurrection Stone ... and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, nearly swallowing it, but the cold metal did not yield ...
\par It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a c
ell in Azkaban, surrounded by Dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. He had forgotten all about her in his feverish contemplation of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her, but Dementors in those numbers would be virtually unassailable. N
ow he came to think about it, he had not yet tried casting a Patronus with the blackthorn wand ... he must try that in the morning ...
\par If only there was a way of getting a better wand ...
\par And desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, invincible, swallowed him once more ...
\par They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that n
ight, and persisted through the whole week, through sodden landscapes which Harry found bleak and depressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing, not Hermione\rquote 
s flat disbelief nor Ron\rquote s
 persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the less joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, bu
t neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute. Harry\rquote s belief in and longing for the Hallows consumed him so much that he felt quite isolated from the other two and their obsession with the Horcruxes.
\par \lquote Obsession?\rquote  said Hermione, in a low, fierce voice, when Harry was careless enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes. \lquote We\rquote 
re not the ones with an obsession, Harry! We\rquote re the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!\rquote 
\par But he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore had left the sign of the Hallows for Hermione to decipher and he had also, Harry remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone hidden in the golden Snitch. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37

Harry quoted calmly.
\par \lquote I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting?\rquote  Hermione retorted, and Harry gave up on her.
\par Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on discussing, seemed less important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he 
did all he could to hide this fact from the other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by what he saw. The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality; they had become blurred, shifting as though they were mo
v
ing in and out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance. Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the chang
e
. He was worried that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that he both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected these unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as
 if it was the blackthorn wand\rquote s fault that he could no longer see into Voldemort\rquote s mind as well as before.
\par As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even through his new self-absorption, that Ron seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having walked out on them: perhaps because Harry\rquote 
s descent into listlessness galvanised his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the other two into action.
\par \lquote Three Horcruxes left,\rquote  he kept saying. \lquote We need a plan of action, come on! Where haven\rquote t we looked? Let\rquote s go through it again. The orphanage ...\rquote 
\par Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visit
ed or murdered in, Ron and Hermione raked over them again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him. He would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read Voldemort\rquote 
s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to keep them moving.

\par Roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly Hallows,
 Harry hurried back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio. Hermione, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for something to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from whic

\par \lquote I do,\rquote  said Lupin firmly. \lquote There is no doubt at all in my mind that his death

 parties are unwise in the present climate.\rquote 
\par \lquote Indeed they are, Romulus,\rquote  said Lee, \lquote so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
Potterwatch! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 And now let\rquote s move to news c
oncerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumours circulating about him, I\rquote 
d like to introduce a new correspondent: Rodent.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote \'93Rodent\'94?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron and Hermione cried out together: \lquote Fred!\rquote 
\par \lquote No \endash  is it George?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s Fred, I think,\rquote  said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said, \lquote I\rquote m not being \'93Rodent\'94, no way, I told you I wanted to be \'93Rapier\'94!\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, all right then. \'93Rapier\'94, could you please give us your take on the various stories we\rquote ve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, River, I can,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote As our listeners will know, unless they\rquote ve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Who\rquote 
s strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the alleged sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos running around the place.\rquote 
\par \lquote Which suits him, of course,\rquote  said Kingsley. \lquote The air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself.\rquote 
\par \lquote Agreed,\rquote  said Fred. \lquote So, people, let\rquote s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill with a single glance from his eyes. That\rquote s a 
}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Basilisk, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 listeners. One simple test: check whether the thing that\rquote 
s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it\rquote s safe to look into its eyes, although if it really is You-Know-Who, that\rquote s still likely to be the last thing you ever do.\rquote 
\par For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing: he could feel the weight of tension leaving him.
\par \lquote And the rumours that he keeps being sighted abroad?\rquote  asked Lee.
\par \lquote Well, who wouldn\rquote t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he\rquote s been putting in?\rquote  asked Fred. \lquote Point is, people, don\rquote t get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he\rquote 
s out of the country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn\rquote t, but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don\rquote t count on him being a long way away if you\rquote 
re planning on taking any risks. I never thought I\rquote d hear myself say it, but safety first!\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,\rquote  said Lee. \lquote Listeners, that brings us to the end of another }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Potterwatch. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par The radio\rquote s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. Harry, Ron and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry had become so used to their isol

\par \lquote Good, eh?\rquote  said Ron happily.
\par \lquote Brilliant,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote It\rquote s so brave of them,\rquote  sighed Hermione admiringly. \lquote If they were found ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, they keep on the move, don\rquote t they?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Like us.\rquote 
\par \lquote But did you hear what Fred said?\rquote  asked Harry excitedly; now the broadcast was over, his thoughts turned again towards his all-consuming obsession. \lquote He\rquote s abroad! He\rquote s still looking for the wand, I knew it!\rquote

\par But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had lit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and

Harry looked round at the other two, now mere outlines in the darkness. He saw Hermione point her wand, not towards the outside, but into 
his face; there was a bang, a burst of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable to see. He could feel his face swelling rapidly under his hands, as heavy footfalls surrounded him.

\par Unknown hands dragged Harry roughly off the ground. Be
fore he could stop them, someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand. Harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognisable beneath his fingers, tight, swollen and puffy as though he had suffered some vi
o
lent allergic reaction. His eyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the tent; all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling Ron and Hermione outside t
oo.
\par \lquote Get \endash  off \endash  her!\rquote  Ron shouted. There was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh: Ron grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, \lquote No! Leave him alone, leave him alone!\rquote 
\par \lquote Your boyfriend\rquote s going to have worse than that done to him if he\rquote s on my list,\rquote  said the horribly familiar, rasping voice. \lquote Delicious girl ... what a treat ... I do enjoy the softness of the skin \'85\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s stomach turned over. He knew who this was: Fenrir Greyback, the werewolf who was permitted to wear Death Eater robes in return for his hired savagery.
\par \lquote Search the tent!\rquote  said another voice.
\par Harry was thrown, face down, on to the ground. A thud told him that Ron had been cast down beside him. They could hear footsteps and crashes; the men were pushing over chairs inside the tent as they searched.
\par \lquote Now, let\rquote s see who we\rquote ve got,\rquote  said Greyback\rquote s gloating voice from overhead, and Harry was rolled over on to his back. A beam of wandlight fell into his face and Greyback laughed.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll be needing Butterbeer to wash this one down. What happened to you, ugly?\rquote 
\par Harry did not answer immediately.
\par \lquote I}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640  said,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\par \lquote Stung,\rquote  Harry muttered. \lquote Been stung.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, looks like it,\rquote  said a second voice.
\par \lquote What\rquote s your name?\rquote  snarled Greyback.
\par \lquote Dudley,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote And your first name?\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  Vernon. Vernon Dudley.\rquote 
\par \lquote Check the list, Scabior,\rquote  said Greyback, and Harry heard him move sideways to look down at Ron, instead. \lquote And what about you, Ginger?\rquote 
\par \lquote Stan Shunpike,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Like \rquote ell you are,\rquote  said the man called Scabior. \lquote We know Stan Shunpike, \rquote e\rquote s put a bit of work our way.\rquote 
\par There was another thud.
\par \lquote I\rquote b Bardy,\rquote  said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood. \lquote Bardy Weadley.\rquote 
\par \lquote A Weasley?\rquote  rasped Greyback. \lquote So you\rquote re related to blood traitors even if you\rquote re not a Mudblood. And lastly, your pretty little friend ...\rquote  The relish in his voice made Harry\rquote s flesh crawl.
\par \lquote Easy, Greyback,\rquote  said Scabior, over the jeering of the others.
\par \lquote Oh, I\rquote m not going to bite just yet. We\rquote ll see if she\rquote s a bit quicker at remembering her name than Barny. Who are you, girly?\rquote 
\par \lquote Penelope Clearwater,\rquote  said Hermione. She sounded terrified, but convincing.
\par \lquote What\rquote s your Blood Status?\rquote 
\par \lquote Half-blood,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Easy enough to check,\rquote  said Scabior. \lquote But the \rquote ole lot of \rquote em look like they could still be \rquote Ogwarts age \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote b lebt,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Left, \rquote ave you, Ginger?\rquote  said Scabior. \lquote And you decided to go camping? And you thought, just for a laugh, you\rquote d use the Dark Lord\rquote s name?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nod a laugh,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Aggiden.\rquote 
\par \lquote Accident?\rquote  There was more jeering laughter.
\par \lquote You know who used to like using the Dark Lord\rquote s name, Weasley?\rquote  growled Greyback. \lquote The Order of the Phoenix. Mean anything to you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Doh.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, they don\rquote t show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name\rquote s been Tabooed. A few Order members have been tracked that way. We\rquote ll see. Bind them up with the other two prisoners!\rquote 
\par Someone yanked Harry up by the hair, dragged him a short way,
 pushed him down into a sitting position, then started binding him back-to-back with other people. Harry was still half-blind, barely able to see anything through his puffed-up eyes. When at last the man tying them had walked away, Harry whispered to the 
other prisoners.
\par \lquote Anyone still got a wand?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Ron and Hermione from either side of him.
\par \lquote This is all my fault. I said the name, I\rquote m sorry \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Harry?\rquote 
\par It was a new, but familiar, voice, and it came from directly behind Harry, from the person tied to Hermione\rquote s left.

\par \lquote Not a bad little haul for one night,\rquote 
 Greyback was saying, as a pair of hobnailed boots marched close by Harry and they heard more crashes from inside the tent. A Mudblood, a runaway goblin and three truants. You checked their names on the list yet, Scabior?\rquote  he roared.
\par \lquote Yeah. There\rquote s no Vernon Dudley on \rquote ere, Greyback.\rquote 
\par \lquote Interesting,\rquote  said Greyback. \lquote That\rquote s interesting.\rquote 
\par He crouched down beside Harry, who saw, through the infini\-tesimal gap left between his swollen eyelids, a face covered in matted, grey hair and whi
skers, with pointed brown teeth and sores at the corners of his mouth. Greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the Tower where Dumbledore had died: of dirt, sweat and blood.
\par \lquote So you aren\rquote t wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list under a different name? What house were you in at Hogwarts?\rquote 
\par \lquote Slytherin,\rquote  said Harry automatically.
\par \lquote Funny \rquote ow they all thinks we wants to \rquote ear that,\rquote  jeered Scabior out of the shadows. \lquote But none of \rquote em can tell us where the common room is.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s in the dungeons,\rquote  said Harry clearly. \lquote You enter through the wall. It\rquote s full of skulls and stuff and it\rquote s under the lake, so the light\rquote s all green.\rquote 
\par There was a short pause.
\par \lquote Well, well, looks like we really \rquote ave caught a little Slytherin,\rquote  said Scabior. \lquote Good for you, Vernon, \rquote cause there ain\rquote t a lot of Mudblood Slytherins. Who\rquote s your father?\rquote 
\par \lquote He works at the Ministry,\rquote  Harry lied. He knew that his whole story would collapse with the smallest investigation, but on the other hand, he only had until his face regained its usual appearance before the game was up in any case. \lquote 
Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.\rquote 
\par \lquote You know what, Greyback,\rquote  said Scabior. \lquote I think there }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\par Harry could barely breathe: could luck, sheer luck, get them safely out of this?
\par \lquote Well, well,\rquote  said Greyback, and Harry could hear the tiniest note of trepidation in that callous voice, and knew that Greyback was wondering whether he had indeed just attacked and bound the son of a Ministry official. Harry\rquote 
s heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs; he would not have been surprised to know that Greyback could see it. \lquote If you\rquote re telling the truth, ugly, you\rquote 
ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect your father\rquote ll reward us just for picking you up.\rquote 
\par \lquote But,\rquote  said Harry, his mouth bone dry, \lquote if you just let us \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Hey!\rquote  came a shout from inside the tent. \lquote Look at this, Greyback!\rquote 
\par A dark figure came bustling towards them, and Harry saw a glint of silver in the light of their wands. They had found Gryffindor\rquote s sword.
\par \lquote Ve-e-ry nice,\rquote  said Greyback appreciatively, taking it from his companion. \lquote Oh, very nice indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where did you get something like this?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s my father\rquote s,\rquote  Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was too dark for Greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt. \lquote We borrowed it to cut firewood \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \rquote Ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Prophet!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 

\par As Scabior said it, Harry\rquote s scar, which was stretched tight across his distended forehead, burned savagely. More clearly than he could make out anything around him, he saw a towering building, a grim fortress, jet black and forbidding; Voldemort
\rquote s thoughts had suddenly become razor-sharp again; he was gliding towards the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose ...
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 So close ... so close ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\par Harry\rquote s scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme effort to keep himself present, not to slip into Voldemort\rquote s mind. He heard the creak of Greyback\rquote s boots as he crouched down in front of Hermione.
\par \lquote You know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot like you.\rquote 
\par \lquote It isn\rquote t! It isn\rquote t me!\rquote

repeated Greyback quietly.
\par A stillness had settled over the scene. Harry\rquote s scar was exquisitely painful, but he struggled with all his strength against the pull of Voldemort\rquote s thoughts: it had never been so important to remain in his own right mind.
\par \lquote Well, this changes things, doesn\rquote t it?\rquote  whispered Greyback.
\par Nobody spoke: Harry sensed the gang of Snatchers watching, frozen, and felt Hermione\rquote s arm trembling against his. Greyback got up and took a couple of steps to where Harry sat, crouching down again to stare closely at his misshapen features.
\par \lquote What\rquote s that on your forehead, Vernon?\rquote  he asked softly, his breath foul in Harry\rquote s nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the taut scar.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t touch it!\rquote  Harry yelled; he could not stop himself; he thought he might be sick from the pain of it.
\par \lquote I thought you wore glasses, Potter?\rquote  breathed Greyback.
\par \lquote I found glasses!\rquote  yelped one of the Snatchers skulking in the background. \lquote There was glasses in the tent, Greyback, wait \endash \rquote 
\par And seconds later Harry\rquote s glasses had been rammed back on to his face. The Snatchers were closing in, now, peering at him.
\par \lquote It is!\rquote  rasped Greyback. \lquote We\rquote ve caught Potter!\rquote

s eyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimatise, then he saw a pair of wrought-iron gates at the foot of what looked like a long drive. He experienced the tiniest trickle of relief. The worst had not happened yet: Voldemort was not here. He w
as, Harry knew, for he was fighting to resist the vision, in some strange, fortress-like place, at the top of a tower. How long it would take Voldemort to get to this place, once he knew that Harry was here, was another matter ...

\par The gates swung open.
\par \lquote Come on!\rquote  said Greyback to his men, and the prisoners were shunted through the gates and up the drive, betwee

ing along sideways, tied back-to-back to the four other prisoners. Closing his puffy eyes he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him for a moment, wanting to know what Voldemort was doing, whether he knew yet that Harry was caught \endash

\par \lquote We\rquote re here to see He Who Must Not Be Named!\rquote  rasped Greyback.

\par \lquote You know me!\rquote  There was resentment in the werewolf\rquote s voice, \lquote Fenrir Greyback! We\rquote ve caught Harry Potter!\rquote

\par Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinising his swollen face. Scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her. She raised her eyebrows.
\par \lquote Bring them in,\rquote  she said.
\par Harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps, into a hallway lined with portraits.
\par \lquote Follow me,\rquote  said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall. \lquote My son, Draco, is home for his Easter holidays. If that is Harry Potter, he will know.\rquote 
\par The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with his eyes almost closed Harry could make out the wide proportions of the room. A crystal chandelier hung f
rom the ceiling, more portraits against the dark purple walls. Two figures rose from chairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by the Snatchers.
\par \lquote What is this?\rquote 
\par The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on Harry\rquote s ears. He was panicking now: he could see no way out, and it was easier, as his fear mounted, to block out Voldemort\rquote s thoughts, though his scar was still burning.

\par \lquote They say they\rquote ve got Potter,\rquote  said Narcissa\rquote s cold voice. \lquote Draco, come here.\rquote 
\par Harry did not dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely: a figure slightly taller than he was, rising from an armchair, his face a pale and pointed blur beneath white-blond hair.
\par Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry directly beneath the chandelier.
\par \lquote Well, boy?\rquote  rasped the werewolf.
\par Harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing with an intricately scrolled frame. Through the slits of his eyes, he saw his own reflection for the first time since leaving Grimmauld Place.
\par His face was huge, shiny and pink, every feature distorted by Hermione\rquote s jinx. His black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw. Had he not known that it was he who stood there, he would have wond
ered who was wearing his glasses. He resolved not to speak, for his voice was sure to give him away; yet he still avoided eye contact with Draco as the latter approached.
\par \lquote Well, Draco?\rquote  said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. \lquote Is it? Is it Harry Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t \endash  I can\rquote t be sure,\rquote  said Draco. He was keeping his distance from Greyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at him.
\par \lquote But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!\rquote 
\par Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited.
\par \lquote Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiv\emdash \rquote 
\par \lquote Now, we won\rquote t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr Malfoy?\rquote  said Greyback menacingly.
\par \lquote Of course not, of course not!\rquote  said Lucius impatiently. He approache
d Harry himself, came so close that Harry could see the usually languid, pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen eyes. With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was peering out from between the bars of a cage.
\par \lquote What did you do to him?\rquote  Lucius asked Greyback. \lquote How did he get into this state?\rquote 
\par \lquote That wasn\rquote t us.\rquote 
\par \lquote Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,\rquote  said Lucius.
\par His grey eyes raked Harry\rquote s forehead.
\par \lquote There\rquote s something there,\rquote  he whispered, \lquote it could be the scar, stretched tight ... Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?\rquote 
\par Harry saw Draco\rquote s face up close, now, right beside his father\rquote s. They were extraordinarily alike, except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement, Draco\rquote s expression was full of reluctance, even fear.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  he said, and he walked away towards the fireplace where his mother stood watching.
\par \lquote We had better be certain, Lucius,\rquote  Narcissa called to her husband in her cold, clear voice. \lquote Completely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the Dark Lord ... They say this is his,\rquote 
 she was looking closely at the blackthorn wand, \lquote but it does not resemble Ollivander\rquote s description ... If we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing ... remember what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?\rquote 
\par \lquote What about the Mudblood, then?\rquote  growled Greyback. Harry was nearly thrown off his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again, so that the light fell on Hermione instead.
\par \lquote Wait,\rquote  said Narcissa sharply. \lquote Yes \endash  yes, she was in Madam Malkin\rquote s with Potter! I saw her picture in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Prophet! }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. \lquote It could be.\rquote 
\par The drawing-room door opened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the sound of the voice wound Harry\rquote s fear to an even higher pitch.
\par \lquote What is this? What\rquote s happened, Cissy?\rquote 
\par Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on Harry\rquote s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes.
\par \lquote But surely,\rquote  she said quietly, \lquote this is the Mudblood girl? This is Granger?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, yes, it\rquote s Granger!\rquote  cried Lucius. \lquote And beside her, we think, Potter! Potter and his friends, caught at last!\rquote 
\par \lquote Potter?\rquote  shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in Harry. \lquote Are you sure? Well, then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!\rquote 
\par She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her beloved master \endash 
\par \lquote I was about to call him!\rquote  said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon Bellatrix\rquote s wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote I}{

hey were no match for her, even though there were four of them against one of her: she was a witch, as Harry knew, with prodigious skill and no conscience. They fell where they stood, all except Greyback, who had been forced into a kneeling position, his 
arms outstretched. Out of the corners of his eyes, Harry saw Bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword of Gryffindor gripped tightly in her hand, her face waxen.
\par \lquote Where did you get this sword?\rquote  she whispered to Greyback as she pulled his wand out of his unresisting grip.
\par \lquote How dare you?\rquote  he snarled, his mouth the only thing that could move as he was forced to gaze up at her. He bared his pointed teeth. \lquote Release me, woman!\rquote 
\par \lquote Where did you find this sword?\rquote  she repeated, brandishing it in his face. \lquote Snape sent it to my vault in Gringotts!\rquote 
\par \lquote It was in their tent,\rquote  rasped Greyback. \lquote Release me, I say!\rquote 
\par She waved her wand and the werewolf sprang to his feet, but appeared too wary to approach her. He prowled behind an armchair, his filthy, curved nails clutching its back.
\par \lquote Draco, move this scum outside,\rquote  said Bellatrix, indicating the unconscious men. \lquote If you haven\rquote t got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me.\rquote

\par She stood, panting slightly, looking down at the sword, examining its hilt. Then she turned to look at the silent prisoners.
\par \lquote If it is indeed Potter, he must not be harmed,\rquote  she muttered, more to herself than to the others. \lquote The Dark Lord wishes to dispose of Potter himself ... but if he finds out ... I must ... I must know ...\rquote

\par \lquote Take these prisoners down to the cellar, Greyback.\rquote 
\par \lquote Wait,\rquote  said Bellatrix sharply. \lquote All except ... except for the Mudblood.\rquote 
\par Greyback gave a grunt of pleasure.

\par Bellatrix hit him across the face; the blow echoed around the room.
\par \lquote If she dies under questioning, I\rquote ll take you next,\rquote  she said. \lquote Blood traitor is next to Mudblood in my book. Take them down\-stairs, Greyback, and make sure they are secure, but do nothing more to them \endash  yet.\rquote 

\par She threw Greyback\rquote s wand back to him
, then took a short silver knife from under her robes. She cut Hermione free from the other prisoners, then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the room while Greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to another door, into a dark passagewa
y, his wand held out in front of him, projecting an invisible and irresistible force.
\par \lquote Reckon she\rquote ll let me have a bit of the girl when she\rquote s finished with her?\rquote  Greyback crooned, as he forced them along the corridor. \lquote I\rquote d say I\rquote ll get a bite or two, wouldn\rquote t you, Ginger?\rquote 

\par Harry could feel Ron shaking. They were forced down a steep flight of stairs, still tied back-to-back and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment. At the bottom was a heavy door. Greyback unlocked it with a tap of his 
wand, then forced them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness. The echoing bang of the slammed cellar door had not died away before there was a terrible, drawn-out scream from directly above them.
\par \lquote HERMIONE!\rquote  Ron bellowed, and he started to writhe and struggle against the ropes tying them together, so that Harry staggered. \lquote HERMIONE!\rquote

\par A few seconds later, there was a click and the luminescent spheres the Deluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar: unable to rejoin their sources they simply hung there, like tiny suns, flooding the undergro

less figure of Ollivander the wandmaker, curled up on the floor in the corner. Craning round, he caught sight of their fellow prisoners: Dean and Griphook the goblin, who seemed barely conscious, kept standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans.

\par Harry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to see Ron running around the cellar, looking up at the low ceiling, searching for a trapdoor. Dean, his face bruised and bloody, said, \lquote Thanks,\rquote 
 to Luna and stood there, shivering, but Griphook sank on to the cellar floor looking groggy and disorientated, many welts across his swarthy face.
\par Ron was now trying to Disapparate without a wand.
\par \lquote There\rquote s no way out, Ron,\rquote  said Luna, watching his fruitless efforts. \lquote The cellar is completely escape-proof. I tried, at first. Mr Ollivander has been here for a long time, he\rquote s tried everything.\rquote 
\par Hermione was screaming again: the sound went through Harry like physical pain. Barely conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar, he, too, started to run ar

\par \lquote What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! CRUCIO!\rquote

\par Harry was not even sure that it had really been there. He tilted the shard of mirror this way and that, and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison, and upstairs Hermione was screaming worse than ever, and next to him, Ron wa

\par \lquote How did you get into my vault?\rquote  they heard Bellatrix scream. \lquote Did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you?\rquote 
\par \lquote We only met him tonight!\rquote  Hermione sobbed. \lquote We\rquote ve never been inside your vault ... it isn\rquote t the real sword! It\rquote s a copy, just a copy!\rquote 
\par \lquote A copy?\rquote  screeched Bellatrix. \lquote Oh, a likely story!\rquote 
\par \lquote But we can find out easily!\rquote  came Lucius\rquote s voice. \lquote Draco, fetch the goblin, he can tell us whether the sword is real or not!\rquote 
\par Harry dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled on the floor.
\par \lquote Griphook,\rquote  he whispered into the goblin\rquote s pointed ear, \lquote you must tell them that sword\rquote s a fake, they mustn\rquote t know it\rquote s the real one, Griphook, please \endash \rquote 
\par He could hear someone scuttling down the cellar steps; next moment, Draco\rquote s shaking voice spoke from behind the door.
\par \lquote Stand back. Line up against the back wall. Don\rquote t try anything, or I\rquote ll kill you!\rquote 
\par They did as they were bidden; as the lock turned Ron clicked the Deluminator and the lights whisked back into his pocket, restoring the cellar\rquote s darkness. The door flew open; Malfoy marched inside, wand held out in front of him, pale and deter\-
mined. He seized the little goblin by the arm and backed out again, dragging Griphook with him. The door slammed shut and at the same moment a loud }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 crack }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 echoed inside the cellar.
\par Ron clicked the Deluminator. Three balls of light flew back into the air from his pocket, revealing Dobby the house-elf, who had just Apparated into their midst.
\par \lquote DOB\emdash !\rquote 
\par Harry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ron looked terrified at his mistake. Footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead: Draco marching Griphook to Bellatrix.
\par Dobby\rquote s enormous, tennis-ball-shaped eyes were wide; he was trembling from his feet to the tips of his ears. He was back in the home of his old masters, and it was clear that he was petrified.
\par \lquote Harry Potter,\rquote  he squeaked, in the tiniest quiver of a voice, \lquote Dobby has come to rescue you.\rquote 
\par \lquote But how did you \endash ?\rquote 
\par An awful scream drowned Harry\rquote s words: Hermione was being tortured again. He cut to the essentials.
\par \lquote You can Disapparate out of this cellar?\rquote  he asked Dobby, who nodded, his ears flapping.
\par \lquote And you can take humans with you?\rquote 
\par Dobby nodded again.
\par \lquote Right. Dobby, I want you to grab Luna, Dean and Mr Ollivander, and take them \endash  take them to \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Bill and Fleur\rquote s,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth!\rquote 
\par The elf nodded for a third time.
\par \lquote And then come back,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Can you do that, Dobby?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course, Harry Potter,\rquote  whispered the little elf. He hurried over to Mr Ollivander, who appeared to be barely conscious. He took one of the wandmaker\rquote 
s hands in his own, then held out the other to Luna and Dean, neither of whom moved.
\par \lquote Harry, we want to help you!\rquote  Luna whispered.
\par \lquote We can\rquote t leave you here,\rquote  said Dean.
\par \lquote Go, both of you! We\rquote ll see you at Bill and Fleur\rquote s.\rquote 
\par As Harry spoke, his scar burned worse than ever, and for a few seconds he looked down, not upon the wandmaker, but on another man who was just as old, just as thin, but laughing scornfully.

\par \lquote Go!\rquote  Harry beseeched Luna and Dean. \lquote Go! We\rquote ll follow, just go!\rquote 
\par They caught hold of the elf\rquote s outstretched fingers. There was another loud }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 crack, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote What was that?\rquote  shouted Lucius Malfoy from over their heads. \lquote Did you hear that? What was that noise in the cellar?\rquote 
\par Harry and Ron stared at each other.
\par \lquote Draco \endash  no, call Wormtail! Make him go and check!\rquote 
\par Footsteps crossed the room overhead, then there was silence. Harry knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar.
\par \lquote We\rquote re going to have to try and tackle him,\rquote  he whispered to Ron. They had no choice: the moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners, they were lost. \lquote Leave the lights on,\rquote  Harry adde
d, and as they heard someone descending the steps outside the door, they backed against the wall on either side of it.
\par \lquote Stand back,\rquote  came Wormtail\rquote s voice. \lquote Stand away from the door. I am coming in.\rquote 
\par The door flew open. For a split second Wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar, ablaze with light from the three mini\-ature suns floating in mid-air. Then Harry and Ron launched themselves upon him. Ron seized Wormtail\rquote 
s wand arm and forced it upwards; Harry slapped a hand to his mouth, muffling his voice. Silently they struggled: Wormtail\rquote s wand emitted sparks; his silver hand closed around Harry\rquote s throat.
\par \lquote What is it, Wormtail?\rquote  called Lucius Malfoy from above.
\par \lquote Nothing!\rquote  Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail\rquote s wheezy voice. \lquote All fine!\rquote 
\par Harry could barely breathe.
\par \lquote You\rquote re going to kill me?\rquote  Harry choked, attempting to prise off the metal fingers. \lquote After I saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail!\rquote 
\par The silver fingers slackened. Harry had not expected it: he wrenched himself free, astonished, keeping his hand over Wormtail\rquote s mouth. He saw the rat-like man\rquote 
s small, watery eyes widen with fear and surprise: he seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his hand had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had betrayed, and he continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to undo that moment of weakness.
\par \lquote And we\rquote ll have that,\rquote  whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail\rquote s wand from his other hand.
\par Wandless, helpless, Pettigrew\rquote s pupils dilated in terror. His eyes had slid from Harry\rquote s face to something else. His own silver fingers were moving inexorably towards his own throat.
\par \lquote No \endash \rquote 
\par Without pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but there was no stopping it. The silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its Disa
rmed and useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; he was being strangled before their eyes.
\par \lquote No!\rquote 
\par Ron had released Worm tail too, and together he and Harry tried to pull the crushing metal fingers from around Wormtail\rquote s throat, but it was no use. Pettigrew was turning blue.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Relashio!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
said Ron, pointing the wand at the silver hand, but nothing happened; Pettigrew dropped to his knees, and at the same moment, Hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead. Wormtail\rquote 
s eyes rolled upwards in his purple face, he gave a last twitch and was still.
\par Harry and Ron looked at each other, then, leaving Wormtail\rquote s body on the floor behind them, ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing roo
m. Cautiously they crept along it, until they reached the drawing-room door, which was ajar. Now they had a clear view of Bellatrix looking down at Griphook, who was holding Gryffindor\rquote 
s sword in his long-fingered hands. Hermione was lying at Bellatrix\rquote s feet. She was barely stirring.
\par \lquote Well?\rquote  Bellatrix said to Griphook. \lquote Is it the true sword?\rquote 
\par Harry waited, holding his breath, fighting against the prickling of his scar.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Griphook. \lquote It is a fake.\rquote 
\par \lquote Are you sure?\rquote  panted Bellatrix. \lquote Quite sure?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said the goblin.
\par Relief broke across her face, all tension drained from it.
\par \lquote Good,\rquote  she said, and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another deep cut into the goblin\rquote s face, and he dropped with a yell at her feet. She kicked him aside. \lquote And now,\rquote 
 she said, in a voice that burst with triumph, \lquote we call the Dark Lord!\rquote 
\par And she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the Dark Mark.
\par At once, Harry\rquote s scar felt as though it had split open again. His true surroundings vanished: he was Voldemort, and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him; he was enraged at the summons he felt \endash 
 he had warned them, he had told them to summon him for nothing less than Potter. If they were mistaken ...

s wands; Harry threw himself to the floor, rolling behind a sofa to avoid them.
\par \lquote STOP OR SHE DIES!\rquote 
\par Panting, Harry peered round the edge of the sofa. Bellatrix was supporting Hermione, who seemed to be unconscious, and was holding her short silver knife to Hermione\rquote s throat.
\par \lquote Drop your wands,\rquote  she whispered. \lquote Drop them, or we\rquote ll see exactly how filthy her blood is!\rquote 
\par Ron stood rigid, clutching Wormtail\rquote s wand. Harry straightened up, still holding Bellatrix\rquote s.
\par \lquote I said, drop them!\rquote  she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermione\rquote s throat: Harry saw beads of blood appear there.
\par \lquote All right!\rquote  he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix\rquote s wand on to the floor at his feet. Ron did the same with Wormtail\rquote s. Both raised their hands to shoulder height.
\par \lquote Good!\rquote  she leered. \lquote Draco, pick them up! The Dark Lord is coming, Harry Potter! Your death approaches!\rquote 
\par Harry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and he could feel Voldemort flying through the sky from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon he would be close enough to Apparate to them, and Harry could see no way out.
\par \lquote Now,\rquote  said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back with the wands, \lquote 
Cissy, I think we ought to tie these little heroes up again, while Greyback takes care of Miss Mudblood. I am sure the Dark Lord will not begrudge you the girl, Greyback, after what you have done tonight.\rquote 
\par At the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. All of them looked upwards in time to see the crystal chandelier tremble; then, with a creak and an ominous jingling, it began to fall. Bellatrix was directly beneath it; d
ropping Hermione, she threw herself aside with a scream. The chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the sword of Gryffindor. Glittering shards of crystal flew in
 all directions: Draco doubled over, his hands covering his bloody face.
\par As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took his chance; he leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco\rquote s grip, pointed all of them at Greyback and yelled: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground.
\par As Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm, Bellatrix sprang to her feet, her hair flying as she brandished the silver knife; but Narcissa had directed her wand at the doorway.
\par \lquote Dobby!\rquote  she screamed, and even Bellatrix froze. \lquote You! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
dropped the chandelier \endash ?\rquote 
\par The tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress.
\par \lquote You must not hurt Harry Potter,\rquote  he squeaked.
\par \lquote Kill him, Cissy!\rquote  shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another loud }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 crack, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 and Narcissa\rquote s wand, too, flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room.
\par \lquote You dirty little monkey!\rquote  bawled Bellatrix. \lquote How dare you take a witch\rquote s wand, how dare you defy your masters?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dobby has no master!\rquote  squealed the elf. \lquote Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s scar was blinding him with pain. Dimly, he knew that they had moments, seconds before Voldemort was with them.
\par \lquote Ron, catch \endash  and GO!\rquote  he yelled, throwing one of the wands to him; then he bent down to tug Griphook out from under the chandelier. Hoisting the groaning goblin, who still clung to the sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobby
\rquote s hand and he spun on the spot to Disapparate.
\par As he turned into darkness, he caught one last view of the drawing room: of the pale, frozen figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that was Ron\rquote s hair, and a blur of flying silver, as Bellatrix\rquote 
s knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing \endash

\par He had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was repeat the name of the destination and hope that it would suffice to tak
e him there. The pain in his forehead pierced him and the weight of the goblin bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of Gryffindor\rquote s sword bumping against his back; Dobby\rquote 
s hand jerked in his; he wondered whether the elf was trying to take charge, to pull them in the right direction, and tried, by squeezing the fingers, to indicate that that was fine with him ...
\par And then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell to his knees, relinquished Dobby\rquote s hand and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground.
\par \lquote Are you all right?\rquote  he said, as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whimpered.
\par Harry squinted around through the darkness. There seemed to be a cottage a short way away under the wide, starry sky, and he thought he saw movement outside it.
\par \lquote Dobby, is this Shell Cottage?\rquote  he whispered, clutching the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys\rquote , ready to fight if he needed to. \lquote Have we come to the right place? Dobby?\rquote 
\par He looked around. The little elf stood feet from him.
\par \lquote DOBBY!\rquote 
\par The elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes. Together, he and Harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf\rquote s heaving chest.
\par \lquote Dobby \endash  no \endash  HELP!\rquote  Harry bellowed towards the cottage, towards the people moving there. \lquote HELP!\rquote 
\par He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby\rquote s front, and that he had stretched out his thin arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry ca
ught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass.
\par \lquote Dobby, no, don\rquote t die, don\rquote t die \endash \rquote 
\par The elf\rquote s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words.
\par \lquote Harry ... Potter ...\rquote 
\par And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great, glassy orbs sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.

After a minute or so, he realised that they had, after all, come to the right place, for here were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering round him as he knelt over the elf.
\par \lquote Hermione?\rquote  he said suddenly. \lquote Where is she?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron\rquote s taken her inside,\rquote  said Bill. \lquote She\rquote ll be all right.\rquote 
\par Harry looked back down at Dobby. He stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf\rquote s body, then dragged off his own jacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket.
\par The sea was rushing ag
ainst rock somewhere nearby; Harry listened to it while the others talked, discussing matters in which he could take no interest, making decisions. Dean carried the injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was making suggestions
 
about burying the elf. Harry agreed without really knowing what he was saying. As he did so, he gazed down at the tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw Voldemo
rt punishing those they had left behind at Malfoy Manor. His rage was dreadful and yet Harry\rquote s grief for Dobby seemed to diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry from across a vast, silent ocean.
\par \lquote I want to do it properly,\rquote  were the first words which Harry was fully conscious of speaking. \lquote Not by magic. Have you got a spade?\rquote 
\par And shortly afterwards he had set to work, alone, digging the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end of the garden, between bushes. He dug with a
 kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives.
\par His scar burned, but he was master of the pain; he felt it, yet was apart from i
t. He had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts co
uld not penetrate Harry now, while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out ... though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love ...
\par On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in sweat, denyin
g the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the Malfoys\rquote 
 returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding blossomed in the darkness ...
\par The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. Hallows ... Horcruxes ... Hallows ... Horcruxes ... yet he no longer burned with that weird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed it out: he felt as though he had been slapped awake again.

\par Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Voldemort had been tonight, and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why ...
\par And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one, small, unconscious impulse of mercy ... Dumbledore had foreseen that ... how much more had he known?
\par Harry lost track of time. He knew only that the darkness had lightened a few degrees when he was rejoined by Ron and Dean.
\par \lquote How\rquote s Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote Better,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Fleur\rquote s looking after her.\rquote 
\par Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had not simply created a perfect grave with his wand, but he did not need it. They jumped down into the hole he had made with spades of their own, and together they worked in silence unt
il the hole seemed deep enough.
\par Harry wrapped the elf more snugly in his jacket. Ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he placed upon the elf\rquote s bare feet. Dean produced a woollen hat, which Harry placed carefully upon Dobby\rquote 
s head, muffling his bat-like ears.
\par \lquote We should close his eyes.\rquote 
\par Harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness. Bill was wearing a travelling cloak; Fleur a large, white apron, from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what Harry re
cognised to be Skele-Gro. Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put an arm around her when she reached him. Luna, who was huddled in one of Fleur\rquote 
s coats, crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of the elf\rquote s eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare.
\par \lquote There,\rquote  she said softly. \lquote Now he could be sleeping.\rquote 
\par Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore\rquote 
s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister for Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore\rquote 
s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole.
\par \lquote I think we ought to say something,\rquote  piped up Luna. \lquote I\rquote ll go first, shall I?\rquote 
\par And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave.
\par \lquote Thank you so much, Dobby, for rescuing me from that cellar. It\rquote s so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and brave. I\rquote ll always remember what you did for us. I hope you\rquote re happy now.\rquote 
\par She turned and looked expectantly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, \lquote Yeah ... thanks Dobby.\rquote 
\par \lquote Thanks,\rquote  muttered Dean.
\par Harry swallowed.
\par \lquote Goodbye, Dobby,\rquote  he said. It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound.
\par \lquote D\rquote you mind if I stay here a moment?\rquote  he asked the others.
\par They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and then they all traipsed back towards the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf.
\par He looked around: there were a number of large, white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking the edge of the flowerbeds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, pillow-like, over the place where Dobby\rquote 
s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand.
\par There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of someone\rquote 
s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock.
\par Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock\rquote 
s surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read:

They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their attention focused upon Bill, who was talking. The room was light-coloured, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace. Harry di
d not want to drop mud upon the carpet, so he stood in the doorway, listening.
\par \lquote ... lucky that Ginny\rquote s on holiday. If she\rquote d been at Hogwarts, they could have taken her before we reached her. Now we know she\rquote s safe too.\rquote 
\par He looked round and saw Harry standing there.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve been getting them all out of The Burrow,\rquote  he explained. \lquote Moved them to Muriel\rquote s. The Death Eaters know Ron\rquote s with you now, they\rquote re bound to target the family \endash  don\rquote t apologise,\rquote 
 he added, at the sight of Harry\rquote s expression. \lquote It was always a matter of time, Dad\rquote s been saying so for months. We\rquote re the biggest blood traitor family there is.\rquote 
\par \lquote How are they protected?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Fidelius Charm. Dad\rquote s Secret Keeper. And we\rquote ve done it on this cottage too; I\rquote m Secret Keeper here. None of us can go to work, but that\rquote 
s hardly the most important thing now. Once Ollivander and Griphook are well enough, we\rquote ll move them to Muriel\rquote s too. There isn\rquote t much room here, but she\rquote s got plenty. Griphook\rquote s legs are on the mend, Fleur\rquote 
s given him Skele-Gro: we could probably move them in an hour or \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  Harry said, and Bill looked startled. \lquote I need both of them here. I need to talk to them. It\rquote s important.\rquote 
\par He heard the authority in his own voice, the conviction, the sense of purpose that had come to him as he dug Dobby\rquote s grave. All of their faces were turned towards him, looking puzzled.
\par \lquote I\rquote m going to wash,\rquote  Harry told Bill, looking down at his hands, still covered in mud and Dobby\rquote s blood. \lquote Then I\rquote ll need to see them, straight away.\rquote 
\par He walked into the little kitchen, to the basin beneath a window overlooking the sea. Dawn was breaking over the horizon, shell pink and faintly gold, as he washed, again following the train of thought that had come to him in the dark garden ...
\par Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar, but Harry knew what he had seen. A piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment, and then help had come. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Harry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window and to the murmuring of the others in the sitting room. He looked out over the ocean and felt closer, this dawn, than ever before, closer to the heart of it all.
\par And still his scar prickled, and he knew that Voldemort was getting there too. Harry understood, and yet did not understand. His instinct was telling him one thing, his brain quite another. The Dumbledore in Harry\rquote

\par Harry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place where a bright gold rim of dazzling sun was rising over the horizon. Then he looked down at his clean hands, and was momentarily sur\-prised to see th
e cloth he was holding in them. He set it down and returned to the hall, and as he did so, he felt his scar pulse angrily, and there flashed across his mind, swift as the reflection of a dragonfly over water, the outline of a building he knew extremely we
ll.
\par Bill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs.
\par \lquote I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,\rquote  Harry said.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Fleur. \lquote You will \rquote ave to wait, \rquote Arry. Zey are both ill, tired \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry,\rquote  he said, without heat, \lquote but it can\rquote t wait. I need to talk to them now. Privately \endash  and separately. It\rquote s urgent.\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, what the hell\rquote s going on?\rquote  asked Bill. \lquote You turn up here with a dead house-elf and a half-conscious goblin, Hermione looks as though she\rquote s been tortured and Ron\rquote s just refused to tell me anything \endash 
\rquote 
\par \lquote We can\rquote t tell you what we\rquote re doing,\rquote  said Harry flatly. \lquote You\rquote re in the Order, Bill, you know Dumbledore left us a mission. We\rquote re not supposed to talk about it to anyone else.\rquote 
\par Fleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look at her; he was staring at Harry. His deeply scarred face was hard to read. Finally, Bill said, \lquote All right. Who do you want to talk to first?\rquote 
\par Harry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was hardly any time left: now was the moment to decide: Horcruxes or Hallows?
\par \lquote Griphook,\rquote  Harry said. \lquote I\rquote ll speak to Griphook first.\rquote 
\par His heart was racing, as if he had been sprinting and had just cleared an enormous obstacle.
\par \lquote Up here, then,\rquote  said Bill, leading the way.
\par Harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back.
\par \lquote I need you two, as well!\rquote  he called to Ron and Hermione, who had been skulking, half-concealed, in the doorway of the sitting room.
\par They both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved.
\par \lquote How are you?\rquote  Harry asked Hermione. \lquote You were amazing \endash  coming up with that story when she was hurting you like that \endash \rquote 
\par Hermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one-armed squeeze.
\par \lquote What are we doing now, Harry?\rquote  he asked.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll see. Come on.\rquote 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs, on to a small landing. Three doors led off it.
\par \lquote In here,\rquote  said Bill, opening the door to his and Fleur\rquote s room. It, too, had a view of the sea, now flecked with gold in the sunrise. Harry moved to t
he window, turned his back on the spectacular view and waited, his arms folded, his scar prickling. Hermione took the chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm.
\par Bill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom he set down carefully upon the bed. Griphook grunted thanks and Bill left, closing the door upon them all.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry to take you out of bed,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote How are your legs?\rquote 
\par \lquote Painful,\rquote  replied the goblin. \lquote But mending.\rquote 
\par He was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a strange look; half-truculent, half-intrigued. Harry noted the goblin\rquote 
s sallow skin, his long, thin fingers, his black eyes. Fleur had removed his shoes: his long feet were dirty. He was larger than a house-elf, but not by much. His domed head was much bigger than a human\rquote s.
\par \lquote You probably don\rquote t remember \endash \rquote  Harry began.
\par \lquote \endash  that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the first time you ever visited Gringotts?\rquote  said Griphook. \lquote I remember, Harry Potter. Even amongst goblins, you are very famous.\rquote 
\par Harry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up. Harry\rquote 
s scar was still prickling. He wanted to get through this interview with Griphook quickly, and at the same time was afraid of making a false move. While he tried to decide on the best way to approach his request, the goblin broke the silence.
\par \lquote You buried the elf,\rquote  he said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous. \lquote I watched you, from the window of the bedroom next door.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes.
\par \lquote You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.\rquote 
\par \lquote In what way?\rquote  asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently.
\par \lquote You dug the grave.\rquote 
\par \lquote So?\rquote 
\par Griphook did not answer. Harry rather thought he was being sneered at for acting like a Muggle, but it did not much matter to him whether Griphook approved of Dobby\rquote s grave or not. He gathered himself for the attack.
\par \lquote Griphook, I need to ask \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You also rescued a goblin.\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote 
\par \lquote You brought me here. Saved me.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I take it you\rquote re not sorry?\rquote  said Harry, a little impatiently.
\par \lquote No, Harry Potter,\rquote  said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the thin, black beard upon his chin, \lquote but you are a very odd wizard.\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Well, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to me.\rquote 
\par The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to frown at Harry as though he had never seen anything like him.
\par \lquote I need to break into a Gringotts vault.\rquote 
\par Harry had not meant to say it so baldly; the words were forced from him as pain shot through his lightning scar and he saw, again, the
 outline of Hogwarts. He closed his mind firmly. He needed to deal with Griphook first. Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry as though he had gone mad.
\par \lquote Harry \endash \rquote  said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook.
\par \lquote Break into a Gringotts vault?\rquote  repeated the goblin, wincing a little as he shifted his position upon the bed. \lquote It is impossible.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, it isn\rquote t,\rquote  Ron contradicted him. \lquote It\rquote s been done.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote The same day I first met you, Griphook. My birthday, seven years ago.\rquote 
\par \lquote The vault in question was empty at the time,\rquote  snapped the goblin, and Harry understood that even though Griphook had left Gringotts, he was offended at the idea of its defences being breached. \lquote Its protection was minimal.\rquote 

\par \lquote Well, the vault we need to get into isn\rquote t empty, and I\rquote m guessing its protection will be pretty powerful,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote It belongs to the Lestranges.\rquote 
\par He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but there would be time enough to explain after Griphook had given his answer.
\par \lquote You have no chance,\rquote  said Griphook flatly. \lquote No chance at all. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \'93If you seek beneath our floors, a treasure that was never yours \endash \'94

yeah, I know, I remember,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote But I\rquote m not trying to get myself any treasure, I\rquote m not trying to take anything for personal gain. Can you believe that?\rquote 
\par The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harry\rquote s forehead prickled, but he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation.
\par \lquote If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal gain,\rquote  said Griphook finally, \lquote 
it would be you, Harry Potter. Goblins and elves are not used to the protection, or the respect, that you have shown this night. Not from wand-carriers.\rquote 
\par \lquote Wand-carriers,\rquote  repeated Harry: the phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar prickled, as Voldemort turned his thoughts north\-wards, and as Harry burned to question Ollivander, next door.
\par \lquote The right to carry a wand,\rquote  said the goblin quietly, \lquote has long been contested between wizards and goblins.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, goblins can do magic without wands,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wandlore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, goblins won\rquote t share any of their magic, either,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote You won\rquote t tell us how to make swords and armour the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have never \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It doesn\rquote t matter,\rquote  said Harry, noting Griphook\rquote s rising colour. \lquote This isn\rquote t about wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature \endash \rquote 
\par Griphook gave a nasty laugh.
\par \lquote But it is, it is about precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful, your race is set still more firmly above mine! Gringotts falls under wizarding rule, house-elves are slaughtered, and who amongst the wand-carriers protests?
\rquote 
\par \lquote We do!\rquote  said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright. \lquote We protest! And I\rquote m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I\rquote m a Mudblood!\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t call yourself \endash \rquote  Ron muttered.
\par \lquote Why shouldn\rquote t I?\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Mudblood, and proud of it! I\rquote ve got no higher position under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to torture, back at the Malfoys\rquote !\rquote 
\par As she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut Bellatrix had made, scarlet against her throat.
\par \lquote Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?\rquote  she asked. \lquote Did you know that we\rquote ve wanted elves to be freed for years?\rquote  (Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of Hermione\rquote s chair.) \lquote You can\rquote 
t want You-Know-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook!\rquote 
\par The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiosity he had shown Harry.
\par \lquote What do you seek within the Lestranges\rquote  vault?\rquote  he asked abruptly. \lquote The sword that lies inside it is a fake. This is the real one.\rquote  He looked from one to the other of them. \lquote 
I think that you already know this. You asked me to lie for you back there.\rquote 
\par \lquote But the fake sword isn\rquote t the only thing in that vault, is it?\rquote  asked Harry. \lquote Perhaps you\rquote ve seen the other things in there?\rquote 
\par His heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his efforts to ignore the pulsing of his scar.
\par The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again.
\par \lquote It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We are the guardians of fabulous treasures. We have a duty to the objects placed in our care, which were, so often, wrought by our fingers.\rquote 
\par The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from Harry, to Hermione, to Ron and then back again.
\par \lquote So young,\rquote  he said finally, \lquote to be fighting so many.\rquote 
\par \lquote Will you help us?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote We haven\rquote t got a hope of breaking in without a goblin\rquote s help. You\rquote re our one chance.\rquote 
\par \lquote I shall ... think about it,\rquote  said Griphook maddeningly.
\par \lquote But \endash \rquote  Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs.
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote  said Harry.
\par The goblin bowed his great, domed head in acknowledgement, then flexed his short legs.
\par \lquote I think,\rquote  he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleur\rquote s bed, \lquote that the Skele-Gro has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me \'85\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, of course,\rquote  said Harry, but before leaving the room he leaned forwards and took the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry thought he saw resentment in the goblin\rquote 
s eyes as he closed the door upon him.
\par \lquote Little git,\rquote  whispered Ron. \lquote He\rquote s enjoying keeping us hanging.\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  whispered Hermione, pulling them both away from the door, into the middle of the still dark landing, \lquote are you saying what I think you\rquote re saying? Are you saying there\rquote s a Horcrux in the Lestranges\rquote  vault?
\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Bellatrix was terrified when she thought we\rquote d been in there, she was beside herself. Why? What did she think we\rquote d seen, 
what else did she think we might have taken? Something she was petrified You-Know-Who would find out about.\rquote 
\par \lquote But I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Who\rquote s been, places he\rquote s done something important?\rquote  said Ron, looking baffled. \lquote Was he ever inside the Lestranges\rquote  vault?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote 
He never had gold there when he was younger, because nobody left him anything. He would have seen the bank from the outside, though, the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted Ron and Hermione to understand about Gringotts before they spoke to Ollivander.
\par \lquote I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Gringotts vault. I think he\rquote d have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the wizarding world. And don\rquote 
t forget, he trusted Bellatrix and her husband. They were his most devoted servants before he fell, and they went looking for him after he vanished. He said it the night he came back, I heard him.\rquote 
\par Harry rubbed his scar.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think he\rquote 
d have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though. He never told Lucius Malfoy the truth about the diary. He probably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place it in her vault. The safest place in the wor
ld for anything you want to hide, Hagrid told me ... except for Hogwarts.\rquote 
\par When Harry had finished speaking, Ron shook his head.
\par \lquote You really understand him.\rquote 
\par \lquote Bits of him,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Bits ... I just wish I\rquote d understood Dumbledore as much. But we\rquote ll see. Come on \endash  Ollivander now.\rquote 
\par Ron and Hermione looked bewildered, but impressed, as they followed him across the little landing and knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleur\rquote s. A weak \lquote Come in!\rquote  answered them.
\par The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed furt
hest from the window. He had been held in the cellar for more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew, on at least one occasion. He was emaciated, the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin. His great, silver eyes seemed vast in t
heir sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton. Harry sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione. The rising sun was not visible here. The room faced the cliff-top garden and the freshly dug grave.

\par \lquote Mr Ollivander, I\rquote m sorry to disturb you,\rquote  Harry said.
\par \lquote My dear boy.\rquote  Ollivander\rquote s voice was feeble. \lquote You rescued us. I thought we would die in that place. I can never thank you ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 never }{

\par \lquote We were glad to do it.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote 
s scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that there was hardly any time left in which to beat Voldemort to his goal, or else to attempt to thwart him. He felt a flutter of panic ... yet he had made his decision when he chose to speak to Griphook first. F
eigning a calm he did not feel, he groped in the pouch around his neck and took out the two halves of his broken wand.
\par \lquote Mr Ollivander, I need some help.\rquote 
\par \lquote Anything. Anything,\rquote  said the wandmaker weakly.
\par \lquote Can you mend this? Is it possible?\rquote 
\par Ollivander held out a trembling hand and Harry placed the two barely connected halves into his palm.
\par \lquote Holly and phoenix feather,\rquote  said Ollivander in a tremulous voice. \lquote Eleven inches. Nice and supple.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Can you \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  whispered Ollivander. \lquote I am sorry, very sorry, but a wand that has suffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any means that I know of.\rquote 
\par Harry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow never\-theless. He took the wand halves back and replaced them in the pouch around his neck
. Ollivander stared at the place where the shattered wand had vanished, and did not look away until Harry had taken from his pocket the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys\rquote .
\par \lquote Can you identify these?\rquote  Harry asked.
\par The wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to his faded eyes, rolling it between his knobble-knuckled fingers, flexing it slightly.
\par \lquote Walnut and dragon heartstring,\rquote  he said. \lquote Twelve and three-quarter inches. Unyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.\rquote 
\par \lquote And this one?\rquote 
\par Ollivander performed the same examination.
\par \lquote Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.\rquote 
\par \lquote Was?\rquote  repeated Harry. \lquote Isn\rquote t it still his?\rquote 
\par \lquote Perhaps not. If you took it \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  I did \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking matters. Much also depends upon the wand itself. In general, however, where a wand has been won, its allegiance will change.\rquote 
\par There was silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of the sea.
\par \lquote You talk about wands like they\rquote ve got feelings,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote like they can think for themselves.\rquote 
\par \lquote The wand chooses the wizard,\rquote  said Ollivander. \lquote That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.\rquote 
\par \lquote A person can still use a wand that hasn\rquote t chosen them, though?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument. The best results, however, must always come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand. These co
nnections are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual quest for experience, the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand.\rquote 
\par The sea gushed forwards and backwards; it was a mournful sound.
\par \lquote I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Can I use it safely?\rquote 
\par \lquote I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master.\rquote 
\par \lquote So I should use this one?\rquote  said Ron, pulling Wormtail\rquote s wand out of his pocket and handing it to Ollivander.
\par \lquote Chestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine and a quarter inches. Brittle. I was forced to make this, shortly after my kidnap, for Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your bidding, and do it well, than another wand.\rquote 

\par \lquote And this holds true for all wands, does it?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote I think so,\rquote  replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Harry\rquote s face. \lquote You ask deep questions, Mr Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic.\rquote 
\par \lquote So, it isn\rquote t necessary to kill the previous owner to take true possession of a wand?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par Ollivander swallowed.
\par \lquote Necessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.\rquote 
\par \lquote There are legends, though,\rquote  said Harry, and as his heart rate quickened, the pain in his scar became more intense; he was sure that Voldemort had decided to put his idea into action. \lquote Legends about a wand \endash  or wands \endash 
 that have passed from hand to hand by murder.\rquote 
\par Ollivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light grey, and his eyes were enormous, bloodshot and bulging with what looked like fear.
\par \lquote Only one wand, I think,\rquote  he whispered.
\par \lquote And You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn\rquote t he?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote I \endash  how?\rquote  croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at Ron and Hermione for help. \lquote How do you know this?\rquote 
\par \lquote He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Ollivander looked terrified.
\par \lquote He tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse, I \endash  I had no choice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed!\rquote 
\par \lquote I understand,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote You told him about the twin cores? You said he just had to borrow another wizard\rquote s wand?\rquote 
\par Ollivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that Harry knew. He nodded slowly.
\par \lquote But it didn\rquote t work,\rquote  Harry went on. \lquote Mine still beat the borrowed wand. Do you know why that is?\rquote 
\par Ollivander shook his head as slowly as he had just nodded.
\par \lquote I had ... never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed something unique that night. The connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare, yet why your wand should have snapped the borrowed wand, I do not know ...\rquote 
\par \lquote We were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands by murder. When You-Know-Who realised my wand had done something strange, he came back and asked about that other wand, didn\rquote t he?\rquote 
\par \lquote How do you know this?\rquote 
\par Harry did not answer.
\par \lquote Yes, he asked,\rquote  whispered Ollivander. \lquote He wanted to know everything I could tell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny or the Elder Wand.\rquote 
\par Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked flabbergasted.
\par \lquote The Dark Lord,\rquote  said Ollivander, in hushed and frightened tones, \lquote had always been happy with the wand I made him \endash  yew and phoenix feather, thirteen and a half inches \endash  until he discovered the connection of 
the twin cores. Now he seeks another, more powerful, wand, as the only way to conquer yours.\rquote 
\par \lquote But he\rquote ll know soon, if he doesn\rquote t already, that mine\rquote s broken beyond repair,\rquote  said Harry quietly.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Hermione, sounding frightened. \lquote He can\rquote t know that, Harry, how could he \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Priori Incantatem,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote We left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the Malfoys\rquote , Hermione. If they examine them properly, make them recreate the spells they\rquote ve cast lately, they\rquote 
ll see that yours broke mine, they\rquote ll see that you tried and failed to mend it, and they\rquote ll realise that I\rquote ve been using the blackthorn one ever since.\rquote 
\par The little colour she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face. Ron gave Harry a reproachful look, and said, \lquote Let\rquote s not worry about that now \endash \rquote 
\par But Mr Ollivander intervened.
\par \lquote The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction, Mr Potter. He is determined to possess it, because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable.\rquote 
\par \lquote And will it?\rquote 
\par \lquote The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,\rquote  said Ollivander, \lquote but the idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit ... formidable.\rquote 
\par Harry was suddenly reminded of how he had been unsure, when they first met, of how much he lik
ed Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the idea of the Dark wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthral him as much as it repulsed him.
\par \lquote You \endash  you really think this wand exists, then, Mr Ollivander?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote Oh yes,\rquote  said Ollivander. \lquote Yes, it is perfectly possible to trace the wand\rquote 
s course through history. There are gaps, of course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or hidden; but always it resurfaces. It has certain identifyin
g characteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognise. There are written accounts, some of them obscure, that I and other wandmakers have made it our business to study. They have the ring of authenticity.\rquote 
\par \lquote So you \endash  you don\rquote t think it can be a fairy tale, or a myth?\rquote  Hermione asked hopefully.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Ollivander. \lquote Whether it }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 needs }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
to pass by murder, I do not know. Its history is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such passions in wiz
ards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong hands, and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands.\rquote 
\par \lquote Mr Ollivander,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote you told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, didn\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as he gulped.
\par \lquote But how \endash  how do you \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Never mind how I know it,\rquote  said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily as his scar burned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so much further north. \lquote 
You told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the wand?\rquote 
\par \lquote It was a rumour,\rquote  whispered Ollivander. \lquote A rumour, years and years ago, long before you were born! I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see ho
w good it would be for business: that he was studying, and duplicating, the qualities of the Elder Wand!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, I can see that,\rquote  said Harry. He stood up. \lquote Mr Ollivander, one last thing, and then we\rquote ll let you get some rest. What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?\rquote 
\par \lquote The \endash  the what?\rquote  asked the wandmaker, looking utterly bewildered.
\par \lquote The Deathly Hallows.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m afraid I don\rquote t know what you\rquote re talking about. Is this still something to do with wands?\rquote 
\par Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting. He did not know about the Hallows.
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Thank you very much. We\rquote ll leave you to get some rest now.\rquote 
\par Ollivander looked stricken.
\par \lquote He was torturing me!\rquote  he gasped. \lquote The Cruciatus Curse ... you have no idea ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I do,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote I really do. Please get some rest. Thank you for telling me all of this.\rquote 
\par He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught a glimpse of Bill, Fleur, Luna and Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them. Th
ey all looked up at Harry as he appeared in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them, and continued into the garden, Ron and Hermione behind him. The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead, and Harry walked back to it, as the pain in his hea
d
 built more and more powerfully. It was a huge effort, now, to close down the visions that were forcing themselves upon him, but he knew that he would have to resist only a little longer. He would yield very soon, because he needed to know that his theory
 was right. He must make only one more, short effort, so that he could explain to Ron and Hermione.
\par \lquote Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, a long time ago,\rquote  he said. \lquote I saw You-Know-Who trying to find him. When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didn\rquote 
t have it any more: it was stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it, I don\rquote t know \endash  but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumour, it can\rquote t have been that difficult.\rquote 

\par Voldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts; Harry could see him standing there, and see, too, the lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn, coming closer and closer.
\par \lquote And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful. And at the height of his power, when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him, he duelled Grindelwald, and beat him, and he took the Elder Wand.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Dumbledore }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 had the Elder Wand?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote But then \endash 
 where is it now?\rquote 
\par \lquote At Hogwarts,\rquote  said Harry, fighting to remain with them in the cliff-top garden.
\par \lquote But then, let\rquote s go!\rquote  said Ron urgently. \lquote Harry, let\rquote s go and get it, before he does!\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s too late for that,\rquote  said Harry. He could not help himself, but clutched his head, trying to help it resist. \lquote He knows where it is. He\rquote s there now.\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  Ron said, furiously. \lquote How long have you known this \endash  why have we been wasting time? Why did you talk to Griphook first? We could have gone \endash  we could still go \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. \lquote Hermione\rquote s right. Dumbledore didn\rquote t want me to have it. He didn\rquote t want me to take it. He wanted me to get the Horcruxes.\rquote 
\par \lquote The unbeatable wand, Harry!\rquote  moaned Ron.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not supposed to ... I\rquote m supposed to get the Horcruxes ...\rquote 
\par And now everything was cool and dark: the sun was barely visible over the horizon as he glided alongside Snape, up through the grounds towards the lake.
\par \lquote I shall join you in the castle shortly,\rquote  he said, in his high, cold voice. \lquote Leave me now.\rquote 
\par Snape bowed and set off back up the path, his black cloak billowing behind him. Harry walked slowly, waiting for Snape\rquote 
s figure to disappear. It would not do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, to see where he was going. But there were no lights in the castle windows, and he could conceal himself ... and in a second he had cast upon himself a Disillusionment
 Charm that hid him even from his own eyes.
\par And he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the outlines of the beloved castle, his first kingdom, his birthright ...
\par And here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark waters. The white marble tomb, an unnecessary blot on the familiar land\-
scape. He felt again that rush of controlled euphoria, that heady sense of purpose in destruction. He raised the old yew wand: how fitting that this would be its last great act.
\par The tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded figure was as long and thin as it had been in life. He raised the wand again.
\par The wrappings fell open. The face was translucent, pale, sunken, yet almost perfectly preserved. They had left his spec\-tacles on the crooked nose: he felt amused derision. Dumbledore\rquote 
s hands were folded upon his chest, and there it lay, clutched beneath them, buried with him.
\par Had the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect the wand? Had he thought that the Dark Lord would be scared to violate his tomb? The spider-like hand swooped and pulled the wand from Dumbledore\rquote 
s grasp, and as he took it, a shower of sparks flew from its tip, sparkling over the corpse of its last owner, ready to serve a new master at last.

s cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea, its walls embedded with shells and whitewashed. It was a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever Harry went inside the tiny cottage or its garden, he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea, like 
the breathing of some great, slumbering creature. He spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face.

\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help voicing whenever they were together.
\par \lquote What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand?\rquote  \lquote What if working out what the symbol meant made you \'93worthy\'94 to get the Hallows?\rquote  \lquote 
Harry, if that really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know-Who?\rquote 
\par Harry had no answers: there were moments
 when he wondered whether it had been outright madness not to try to prevent Voldemort breaking open the tomb. He could not even explain satisfactorily why he had decided against it: every time he tried to reconstruct the internal arguments that had led t
o his decision, they sounded feebler to him.
\par The odd thing was that Hermione\rquote s support made him feel just as confused as Ron\rquote s doubts. Now forced to accept that the Elder Wand was real, she maintained that it was an evil object, and that the way Voldemort h
ad taken possession of it was repellent, not to be considered.
\par \lquote You could never have done that, Harry,\rquote  she said again and again. \lquote You couldn\rquote t have broken into Dumbledore\rquote s grave.\rquote 
\par But the idea of Dumbledore\rquote s corpse frightened Harry much less than the possibility that he might have misunderstood the living Dumbledore\rquote 
s intentions. He felt that he was still groping in the dark; he had chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering whether he had misread the signs, whether he should not have taken the oth
er way. From time to time, anger at Dumbledore crashed over him again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore had not explained before he died.
\par \lquote But }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 he dead?\rquote  said Ron, three days after the
y had arrived at the cottage. Harry had been staring out over the wall that separ\-ated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their argument.
\par \lquote Yes, he is, Ron, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 please }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 don\rquote t start that again!\rquote 
\par \lquote Look at the facts, Hermione,\rquote  said Ron, speaking across Harry, who continued to gaze at the horizon. \lquote The silver doe. The sword. The eye Harry saw in the mirror \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Harry admits he could have imagined the eye! Don\rquote t you, Harry?\rquote 
\par \lquote I could have,\rquote  said Harry, without looking at her.
\par \lquote But you don\rquote t think you did, do you?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote No, I don\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote There you go!\rquote  said Ron quickly, before Hermione could carry on. \lquote If it wasn\rquote t Dumbledore, explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar, Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t \endash  but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if he\rquote s lying in a tomb at Hogwarts?\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno, it could\rquote ve been his ghost!\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore wouldn\rquote t come back as a ghost,\rquote  said Harry. There was little about Dumbledore he was sure of, now, but he knew that much. \lquote He would have gone on.\rquote 
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean, \'93gone on\'94?\rquote  asked Ron, but before Harry could say any more, a voice behind them said, \lquote \rquote Arry?\rquote 
\par Fleur had come out of the cottage, her long, silver hair flying in the breeze.
\par \lquote \rquote Arry, Grip\rquote ook would like to speak to you. \rquote E eez in ze smallest bedroom, \rquote e says \rquote e does not want to be over \rquote eard.\rquote 
\par Her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear; she looked irritable as she walked back round the house.
\par Griphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest of the cottage\rquote 
s three bedrooms, in which Hermione and Luna slept by night. He had drawn the red cotton curtains against the bright, cloudy sky, which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the rest of the airy, light cottage.
\par \lquote I have reached my decision, Harry Potter,\rquote  said the goblin, who was sitting cross-legged in a low chair, drumming its arms with his spindly fingers. \lquote Though the goblins of Gringotts will consider it base treachery, I have decided to
 help you \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s great!\rquote  said Harry, relief surging through him. \lquote Griphook, thank you, we\rquote re really \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  in return,\rquote  said the goblin firmly, \lquote for payment.\rquote 
\par Slightly taken aback, Harry hesitated.
\par \lquote How much do you want? I\rquote ve got gold.\rquote 
\par \lquote Not gold,\rquote  said Griphook. \lquote I have gold.\rquote 
\par His black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes.
\par \lquote I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s spirits plummeted.
\par \lquote You can\rquote t have that,\rquote  he said. \lquote I\rquote m sorry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Then,\rquote  said the goblin softly, \lquote we have a problem.\rquote 
\par \lquote We can give you something else,\rquote  said Ron eagerly. \lquote I\rquote ll bet the Lestranges have got loads of stuff, you can take your pick once we get into the vault.\rquote 
\par He had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily.
\par \lquote I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right!\rquote 
\par \lquote The sword\rquote s ours \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It is not,\rquote  said the goblin.
\par \lquote We\rquote re Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor\rquote s \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote And before it was Gryffindor\rquote s, whose was it?\rquote  demanded the goblin, sitting up straight.
\par \lquote No one\rquote s,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote it was made for him, wasn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote No!\rquote  cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at Ron. \lquote Wizarding arrogance again! That sword was Ragnuk the First\rquote s, taken from him by Godric Gryffindor! It is a lost treasure, a ma
sterpiece of goblinwork! It belongs with the goblins! The sword is the price of my hire, take it or leave it!\rquote 
\par Griphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other two, then said, \lquote We need to discuss this, Griphook, if that\rquote s all right. Could you give us a few minutes?\rquote 
\par The goblin nodded, looking sour.
\par Downstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the fireplace, brow furrowed, trying to think what to do. Behind him, Ron said, \lquote He\rquote s having a laugh. We can\rquote t let him have that sword.\rquote 
\par \lquote It is true?\rquote  Harry asked Hermione. \lquote Was the sword stolen by Gryffindor?\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know,\rquote  she said hopelessly. \lquote Wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races, but there\rquote s no account that I know of that says Gryffindor stole the sword.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote ll be one of those goblin stories,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn\rquote t asked for one of our wands.\rquote 
\par \lquote Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote They\rquote ve been treated brutally in the past.\rquote 
\par \lquote Goblins aren\rquote t exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?\rquote  said Ron. \lquote They\rquote ve killed plenty of us. They\rquote ve fought dirty too.\rquote 
\par \lquote But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhand and violent isn\rquote t going to make him more likely to help us, is it?\rquote 
\par There was a pause while they tried to think of a way round the problem. Harry looked out of the window at Dobby\rquote s grave. Luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone.
\par \lquote OK,\rquote  said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, \lquote how\rquote s this? We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the vault, and then he can have it. There\rquote s a fake in there, isn\rquote 
t there? We switch them, and give him the fake.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron, he\rquote d know the difference better than we would!\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote He\rquote s the only one who realised there had been a swap!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, but we could scarper before he realises \endash \rquote 
\par He quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him.
\par \lquote That,\rquote  she said quietly, \lquote is despicable. Ask for his help, then double-cross him? And you wonder why goblins don\rquote t like wizards, Ron?\rquote 
\par Ron\rquote s ears had turned red.
\par \lquote All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What\rquote s your solution, then?\rquote 
\par \lquote We need to offer him something else, something just as valuable.\rquote 
\par \lquote Brilliant. I\rquote ll go and get one of our other ancient goblin-made swords and you can gift-wrap it.\rquote 
\par Silence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their one, indispens\-able weapon against the Horcruxes.
\par He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea. The idea that Gryffindor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him; he had always been p
roud to be a Gryffindor; Gryffindor had been the champion of Muggle-borns, the wizard who had clashed with the pure-blood-loving Slytherin ...
\par \lquote Maybe he\rquote s lying,\rquote  Harry said, opening his eyes again. \lquote Griphook. Maybe Gryffindor didn\rquote t take the sword. How do we know the goblin version of history\rquote s right?\rquote 
\par \lquote Does it make a difference?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote Changes how I feel about it,\rquote  said Harry.
\par He took a deep breath.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll tell him he can have the sword after he\rquote s helped us get into that vault \endash  but we\rquote ll be careful to avoid telling him exactly }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
when }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 he can have it.\rquote 
\par A grin spread slowly across Ron\rquote s face. Hermione, however, looked alarmed.
\par \lquote Harry, we can\rquote t \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He can have it,\rquote  Harry went on, \lquote after we\rquote ve used it on all of the Horcruxes. I\rquote ll make sure he gets it then. I\rquote ll keep my word.\rquote 
\par \lquote But that could be years!\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote I know that, but }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 needn\rquote t. I won\rquote t be lying ... really.
\rquote 
\par Harry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame. He remembered the words that had been engraved over the gateway to Nurmengard: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 For the Greater Good. }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 He pushed the idea away. What choice did they have?
\par \lquote I don\rquote t like it,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Nor do I, much,\rquote  Harry admitted.
\par \lquote Well, I think it\rquote s genius,\rquote  said Ron, standing up again. \lquote Let\rquote s go and tell him.\rquote 
\par Back in the smallest b
edroom, Harry made the offer, careful to phrase it so as not to give any definite time for the handover of the sword. Hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking; he felt irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However, Griphoo
k had eyes for nobody but Harry.
\par \lquote I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Then shake,\rquote  said the goblin, holding out his hand.
\par Harry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in his own. Then Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands together and said, \lquote So. We begin!\rquote 
\par It was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again. They settled to work in the smallest bedroom, which was kept, according to Griphook\rquote s preference, in semi-darkness.
\par \lquote I have visited the Lestranges\rquote  vault only once,\rquote  Griphook told them, \lquote on the occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the mos
t ancient chambers. The oldest wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected \'85\rquote 
\par They remained shut in the cupboard-like room for hours at a time. Slowly, the days stretched into weeks. There was problem after problem to overcome, not least of which was that their store of Polyjuice Potion was greatly depleted.
\par \lquote There\rquote s really only enough left for one of us,\rquote  said Hermione, tilting the thick mud-like Potion against the lamplight.
\par \lquote That\rquote ll be enough,\rquote  said Harry, who was examining Griphook\rquote s hand-drawn map of the deepest passageways.
\par The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on now that Harry, Ron and Hermione only emerged for mealtimes. Nobody asked questions, although Harry often felt Bill\rquote 
s eyes on the three of them at the table, thoughtful, concerned.
\par The longer they spent together, the more Harry realised that he did not much like the goblin. Griphook was unexpectedly blood-thirsty, laughed at
 the idea of pain in lesser creatures and seemed to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards to reach the Lestranges\rquote 
 vault. Harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it: they needed Griphook.
\par The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he continued to request trays of food in his room, like the still frail Ollivander, until Bill (following an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him
 that the arrange\-ment could not continue. Thereafter, Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat the same food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots and various fungi.
\par Harry felt responsible: it was, after all, he
 who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that he could question him; his fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George and Mr Weasley could no longer work.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry,\rquote  he told Fleur, one blustery April evening as he helped her prepare dinner. \lquote I never meant you to have to deal with all of this.\rquote 
\par She had just set some knives to work, chopping up steaks for Griphook and Bill, who had preferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by Greyback. While the knives sliced away behind her, her somewhat irritable expression softened.
\par \lquote \rquote Arry, you saved my sister\rquote s life, I do not forget.\rquote 
\par This was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry decided against reminding her that Gabrielle had never been in real danger.
\par \lquote Anyway,\rquote  Fleur went on, pointing her wand at a pot of sauce on the stove, which began to bubble at once, \lquote Mr Ollivander leaves for Muriel\rquote s zis evening. Zat will make things easier. Ze goblin,\rquote 
 she scowled a little at the mention of him, \lquote can move downstairs, and you, Ron and Dean can take zat room.\rquote 
\par \lquote We don\rquote t mind sleeping in the living room,\rquote  said Harry, who knew that Griphook would think poorly of having to sleep on the sofa; keeping Griphook happy was essential to their plans. \lquote Don\rquote t worry about us.\rquote 
 And when she tried to protest he went on, \lquote We\rquote ll be off your hands soon, too, Ron, Hermione and I. We won\rquote t need to be here much longer.\rquote 
\par \lquote But what do you mean?\rquote  she said, frowning at him, her wand pointing at the casserole dish now suspended in mid-air. \lquote Of course, you must not leave, you are safe \rquote ere!\rquote 
\par She looked rather like Mrs Weasley as she said it, and he was glad that the back door opened at that moment. Luna and Dean entered, their hair damp from the rain outside and their arms full of driftwood.
\par \lquote ... and tiny little ears,\rquote  Luna was saying, \lquote a bit like a hippo\rquote s, Daddy says, only purple and hairy. And if you want to call them, you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too fast ...\rquote 
\par Looking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at Harry as he passed, following Luna into the combined dining and sitting room where Ron and Hermione were laying the dinner table. Seizing the chance to escape Fleur\rquote 
s questions, Harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin juice and followed them.
\par \lquote ... and if you ever come to our house I\rquote ll be able to show you the horn, Daddy wrote to me about it but I haven\rquote t seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for Christmas,\rquote 
 Luna was saying, as she and Dean relaid the fire.
\par \lquote Luna, we told you,\rquote  Hermione called over to her. \lquote That horn exploded. It came from an Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn,\rquote  said Luna serenely. \lquote Daddy told me. It will probably have reformed by now, they mend themselves, you know.\rquote 
\par Hermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as Bill appeared, leading Mr Ollivander down the stairs. The wand\-maker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung to Bill\rquote s arm as the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase.

\par \lquote I\rquote m going to miss you, Mr Ollivander,\rquote  said Luna, approaching the old man.
\par \lquote And I you, my dear,\rquote  said Ollivander, patting her on the shoulder. \lquote You were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place.\rquote 
\par \lquote So, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 au revoir, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Mr Ollivander,\rquote  said Fleur, 
kissing him on both cheeks. \lquote And I wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to Bill\rquote s Auntie Muriel? I never returned \rquote er tiara.\rquote 
\par \lquote It will be an honour,\rquote  said Ollivander, with a little bow, \lquote the very least I can do in return for your generous hospitality.\rquote 
\par Fleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show the wandmaker. The tiara sat glittering and twinkling in the light from the low-hanging lamp.
\par \lquote Moonstones and diamonds,\rquote  said Griphook, who had sidled into the room without Harry noticing. \lquote Made by goblins, I think?\rquote 
\par \lquote And paid for by wizards,\rquote  said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot him a look that was both furtive and challenging.
\par A strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as B
ill and Ollivander set off into the night. The rest of them squeezed in around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to move, they started to eat. The fire crackled and popped in the grate beside them. Fleur, Harry noticed, was merely play
ing with her food; she glanced at the window every few minutes; however, Bill returned before they had finished their first course, his long hair tangled by the wind.
\par \lquote Everything fine,\rquote  he told Fleur. \lquote Ollivander settled in, Mum and Dad say hello. Ginny sends you all her love. Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall, they\rquote 
re still operating an Owl Order business out of her back room. It cheered her up to have her tiara back, though. She said she thought we\rquote d stolen it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, she eez }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 charmante, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 your aunt,\rquote 
 said Fleur crossly, waving her wand and causing the dirty plates to rise and form a stack in mid-air. She caught them and marched out of the room.
\par \lquote Daddy\rquote s made a tiara,\rquote  piped up Luna. \lquote Well, more of a crown, really.\rquote 
\par Ron caught Harry\rquote s eye and grinned; Harry knew that he was remembering the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius.
\par \lquote Yes, he\rquote s trying to recreate the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He thinks he\rquote s identified most of the main elements now. Adding the Billywig wings really made a difference \endash \rquote 
\par There was a bang on the front door. Everyone\rquote s heads turned towards it. Fleur came running out of the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feet, his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron and Hermione did the same. Silently
, Griphook slipped beneath the table out of sight.
\par \lquote Who is it?\rquote  Bill called.
\par \lquote It is I, Remus John Lupin!\rquote  called a voice over the howling wind. Harry experienced a thrill of fear; what had happened? \lquote I am a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks, and you, t
he Secret Keeper of Shell Cottage, told me the address and bade me come in an emergency!\rquote 
\par \lquote Lupin,\rquote  muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it open.
\par Lupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, wrapped in a travelling cloak, his greying hair windswept. He straightened up, looked around the room, making sure of who was there, then cried aloud, \lquote It\rquote s a boy! We\rquote 
ve named him Ted, after Dora\rquote s father!\rquote 
\par Hermione shrieked.
\par \lquote Wha\emdash ? Tonks \endash  Tonks has had the baby?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, yes, she\rquote s had the baby!\rquote  shouted Lupin. All around the table came cries of delight, sighs of relief: Hermione and Fleur both squealed, \lquote Congratulations!\rquote  and Ron said, \lquote Blimey, a baby!\rquote 
 as if he had never heard of such a thing before.
\par \lquote Yes \endash  yes \endash  a boy,\rquote  said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by his own happiness. He strode round the table and hugged Harry; the scene in the basement of Grimmauld Place might never have happened.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll be godfather?\rquote  he said, as he released Harry.
\par \lquote M \endash  me?\rquote  stammered Harry.
\par \lquote You, yes, of course \endash  Dora quite agrees, no one better \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  yeah \endash  blimey \endash \rquote 
\par Harry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted: now Bill was hurrying to fetch wine and Fleur was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink.
\par \lquote I can\rquote t stay long, I must get back,\rquote  said Lupin, beaming around at them all: he looked years younger than Harry had ever seen him. \lquote Thank you, thank you, Bill.\rquote 
\par Bill had soon filled all of their goblets; they stood and raised them high in a toast.
\par \lquote To Teddy Remus Lupin,\rquote  said Lupin, \lquote a great wizard in the making!\rquote 
\par \lquote \rquote Oo does \rquote e look like?\rquote  Fleur enquired.
\par \lquote I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not much hair. It looked black when he was born, but I swear it\rquote s turned ginger in the hour since. Probably be blond by the time I get back. Andromeda says Tonks\rquote 
s hair started changing colour the day that she was born.\rquote  He drained his goblet. \lquote Oh, go on then, just one more,\rquote  he added, beaming, as Bill made to fill it again.
\par The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled, and Bill was soon opening another bottle of wine. Lupin\rquote 
s news seemed to have taken them out of themselves, removed them for a while from their state of siege: tidings of new life were exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere, and afte
r a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone. Harry thought he was the only one who had noticed this, until he saw Bill\rquote s eyes following the goblin up the stairs.
\par \lquote No ... no ... I really must get back,\rquote  said Lupin at last, declin\-ing yet another goblet of wine. He got to his feet and pulled his travelling cloak back around himself. \lquote Goodbye, goodbye \endash  I\rquote 
ll try and bring some pictures in a few days\rquote  time \endash  they\rquote ll all be so glad to know that I\rquote ve seen you \endash \rquote 
\par He fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women and grasping hands with the men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild night.
\par \lquote Godfather, Harry!\rquote  said Bill, as they walked into the kitchen together, helping clear the table. \lquote A real honour! Congratulations!\rquote 
\par As Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill pulled the door behind him closed, shutting out the still voluble voices of the others, who were continuing to celebrate even in Lupin\rquote s absence.
\par \lquote I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn\rquote t been easy to get an opportunity with the cottage this full of people.\rquote 
\par Bill hesitated.
\par \lquote Harry, you\rquote re planning something with Griphook.\rquote 
\par It was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to deny it. He merely looked at Bill, waiting.
\par \lquote I know goblins,\rquote  said Bill. \lquote I\rquote ve worked for Gringotts ever since I left Hogwarts. As far as there can be friendship between wizards and goblins, I have goblin friends \endash  or, at least, goblins I know well, and like.
\rquote  Again, Bill hesitated. \lquote Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised him in return?\rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t tell you that,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Sorry, Bill.\rquote 
\par The kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring through more empty goblets.
\par \lquote Wait,\rquote  Bill told her. \lquote Just a moment.\rquote 
\par She backed out and he closed the door again.
\par \lquote Then I have to say this,\rquote  Bill went on. \lquote 
If you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin notions of ownership, payment and repayment are not the same as human ones.\rquote 
\par Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake had stirred inside him.
\par \lquote What do you mean?\rquote  he asked.
\par \lquote We are talking about a different breed of being,\rquote  said Bill. \lquote Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries \endash  but you\rquote 
ll know all that from History of Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most
 prone to it, that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no respect for goblin ownership.\rquote 
\par \lquote I respect \endash \rquote  Harry began, but Bill shook his head.
\par \lquote You don\rquote t understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have lived 
with goblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin-made objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs.\rquote 
\par \lquote But if it was bought \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money. They have, however, great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing from wizard to wizard. You saw Griphook\rquote 
s face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I believe he thinks, as do the fiercest of his kind, that it ou
ght to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects, passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little more than theft.\rquote 
\par Harry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill guessed more than he was letting on.
\par \lquote All I am saying,\rquote  said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room, \lquote is to be very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin.
\rquote 
\par \lquote Right,\rquote  said Harry, as Bill opened the door, \lquote yeah. Thanks. I\rquote ll bear that in mind.\rquote 
\par As he followed Bill back to the others, a wry thought came to him, born no doubt of the wine he had drunk. He seemed set on course to become just as reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black had been to him.

\par Harry could not help but remember how Hermione had dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn wand, insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well as his ow
n, telling him to simply practise. He chose not to repeat her own advice back to her, however; the eve of their attempted assault on Gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonise her.
\par \lquote It\rquote ll probably help you get in character, though,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Think what that wand\rquote s done!\rquote 
\par \lquote But that\rquote s my point!\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote This is the wand that tortured Neville\rquote s mum and dad, and who knows how many other people? This is the wand that killed Sirius!\rquote 
\par Harry had not thought of that: he looked down at the wand and was visited by a brutal urge to snap it, to slice it in half with Gryffindor\rquote s sword, which was propped against the wall beside him.
\par \lquote I miss }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 my }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 wand,\rquote  Hermione said miserably. \lquote 
I wish Mr Ollivander could have made me another one too.\rquote 
\par Mr Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that morning. She was out on the back lawn at that moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun. Dean, who had lost his wand to the Snatchers, was watching rather gloomily.
\par Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to Draco Malfoy. He had been surprised, but pleased, to discover that it worked for him at least as well as Hermione\rquote 
s had done. Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the secret workings of wands, Harry thought he knew what Hermione\rquote s problem was: she had not won the walnut wand\rquote s allegiance by taking it personally from Bellatrix.
\par The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered. Harry reached instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to him, but regretted his action at 
once: he could tell that the goblin had noticed. Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment he said, \lquote We\rquote ve just been checking the last-minute stuff, Griphook. We\rquote ve told Bill and Fleur we\rquote re leaving tomorrow, and we\rquote 
ve told them not to get up to see us off.\rquote 
\par They had been firm on this point, because Hermione would need to transform into Bellatrix before they left, and the less that Bill and Fleur knew or suspected about what they were about to do, the better. They had also explained that they would not be ret
urning. As they had lost Perkins\rquote 
s old tent on the night that the Snatchers caught them, Bill had lent them another one. It was now packed inside the beaded bag, which, Harry was impressed to learn, Hermione had protected from the Snatchers by the simple e
xpedient of stuffing it down her sock.
\par Though he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna and Dean, not to mention the home comforts they had enjoyed over the last few weeks, Harry was looking forward to escaping the confinement of Shell Cottage. He was tired of tryin
g to make sure that they were not overheard, tired of being shut in the tiny, dark bedroom. Most of all, he longed to be rid of Griphook. However, precisely how and when they were to part from the goblin without handing over Gryffindor\rquote 
s sword remained a question to which Harry had no answer. It had been impossible to decide how they were going to do it, because the goblin rarely left Harry, Ron and Hermione alone together for more than five minutes at a time; \lquote 
He could give my mother lessons,\rquote  growled Ron, as the goblin\rquote s long fingers kept appearing around the edges of doors. With Bill\rquote 
s warning in mind, Harry could not help suspecting that Griphook was on the watch for possible skulduggery. Hermione disapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that 
Harry had given up attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it; Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing better than \lquote We\rquote ll just have to wing it, mate.\rquote 

\par Harry slept badly that night. Lying awake in the early hours, he thought back to the way he had felt the night before they had infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determin\-
ation, almost an excitement. Now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety, nagging doubts: he c
ould not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong. He kept telling himself that their plan was good, that Griphook knew what they were facing, that they were well-prepared for all the difficulties they were likely to encounter; yet still he fe
lt uneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir, and was sure that he, too, was awake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so Harry did not speak.
\par It was a relief when six o\rquote clock arrived and they could slip out of their sleeping bags, dress in the
 semi-darkness, then creep out into the garden, where they were to meet Hermione and Griphook. The dawn was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was May. Harry looked up at the stars still glimmer\-
ing palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing backwards and forwards against the cliff: he was going to miss the sound.
\par Small green shoots were forcing their way up through the red earth of Dobby\rquote s grave now; in a year\rquote s time the mound would be covered in flowers. The white stone that bore the elf\rquote 
s name had already acquired a weathered look. He realised now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of
 leaving him behind. Looking down on the grave, he wondered yet again how the elf had known where to come to rescue them. His fingers moved absent-mindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck, through which he could feel the jagged mirror fra
gment in which he had been sure he had seen Dumbledore\rquote s eye. Then the sound of a door opening made him look round.
\par Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn towards them, accompanied by Griphook. As she walked, she was tucking the small beaded bag i
nto the inside pocket of another set of the old robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry knew perfectly well that it was really Hermione, he could not suppress a shiver of loathing. She was taller than he was, her long, black hair rippling 
down her back, her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested upon him; but then she spoke, and he heard Hermione through Bellatrix\rquote s low voice.
\par \lquote She tasted }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 disgusting, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
worse than Gurdyroots! OK, Ron, come here so I can do you \'85\rquote 
\par \lquote Right, but remember, I don\rquote t like the beard too long \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, for heaven\rquote s sake, this isn\rquote t about looking handsome \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s not that, it gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit shorter, try and do it the way you did last time.\rquote 
\par Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath as she transformed various aspects of Ron\rquote 
s appearance. He was to be given a completely fake identity, and they were trusting to the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile, Harry and Griphook were to be concealed under the Invisibility Cloak.
\par \lquote There,\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote how does he look, Harry?\rquote 
\par It was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought, because he knew him so well. Ron\rquote s hair was now long and wavy, he had a thick, brown beard and moustache, no freckles, a short, broad nose and heavy eyebrows.
\par \lquote Well, he\rquote s not my type, but he\rquote ll do,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Shall we go, then?\rquote 
\par All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and silent under the fading stars, then turned and began to walk towa
rds the point, just beyond the boundary wall, where the Fidelius Charm stopped working and they would be able to Disapparate. Once past the gate, Griphook spoke.
\par \lquote I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?\rquote 
\par Harry bent down and the goblin clambered on to his back, his hands linked in front of Harry\rquote 
s throat. He was not heavy, but Harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength with which he clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of the beaded bag and threw it over them both.
\par \lquote Perfect,\rquote  she said, bending down to check Harry\rquote s feet. \lquote I can\rquote t see a thing. Let\rquote s go.\rquote 
\par Harry turned on the spot with Griphook on his shoulders, concentrating with all his might on the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that was the entrance to Diagon Alley. T
he goblin clung even tighter as they moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds later Harry\rquote 
s feet found pavement and he opened his eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn\rquote s existence.
\par The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. Tom, the stooped and toothless landlord, was polishing glasses behind the bar counter; a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation in the far corner glanced at Hermion
e and drew back into the shadows.
\par \lquote Madam Lestrange,\rquote  murmured Tom, and as Hermione passed he inclined his head subserviently.
\par \lquote Good morning,\rquote  said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying Griphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised.
\par \lquote Too polite,\rquote  Harry whispered in Hermione\rquote s ear as they passed out of the inn into the tiny backyard. \lquote You need to treat people like they\rquote re scum!\rquote 
\par \lquote OK, OK!\rquote 
\par Hermione drew out Bellatrix\rquote s wand and tapped a brick in the nondescript wall in front of them
. At once the bricks began to whirl and spin: a hole appeared in the middle of them, which grew wider and wider, finally forming an archway on to the narrow cobbled street that was Diagon Alley.
\par It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there we
re hardly any shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much altered, now, from the bustling place Harry had visited before his first term at Hogwarts so many years before. More shops than ever were boarded-up, though several new establish\-
ments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been created since his last visit. Harry\rquote s own face glared down at him from posters plastered over many windows, always captioned with the words }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Undesirable Number One.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. He heard them moaning to the few passers-by, pleading for gold, insisting that they were really wizards. One man had a bloody bandage over his eye.
\par As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione. They seemed to melt away before her, drawing hoods 
over their faces and fleeing as fast as they could. Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path.
\par \lquote My children!\rquote  he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked, high-pitched, he sounded distraught. \lquote Where are my children? What has he done with them? You know, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 you know!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par \lquote I \endash  I really \endash \rquote  stammered Hermione.
\par The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat: then, with a bang and a burst of red light he was thrown backwards on to the gro
und, unconscious. Ron stood there, his wand still outstretched and a look of shock visible behind his beard. Faces appeared at the windows on either side of the street, while a little knot of prosperous-looking passers-by gathered their robes about them a
nd broke into gentle trots, keen to vacate the scene.
\par Their entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more conspicuous; for a moment Harry wondered whether it might not be better to leave, now, and try to think of a different plan. Before they could
 move or consult one another, however, they heard a cry from behind them.
\par \lquote Why, Madam Lestrange!\rquote 
\par Harry whirled round and Griphook tightened his hold around Harry\rquote s neck: a tall, thin wizard with a crown of bushy, grey hair and a long, sharp nose was striding towards them.
\par \lquote It\rquote s Travers,\rquote  hissed the goblin into Harry\rquote s ear, but at that moment Harry could not think who Travers was. Hermione had drawn herself up to her fullest height and said, with as much contempt as she could muster, \lquote 
and what do you want?\rquote 
\par Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote He\rquote s another Death Eater!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
breathed Griphook, and Harry sidled sideways to repeat the information into Hermione\rquote s ear.
\par \lquote I merely sought to greet you,\rquote  said Travers coolly, \lquote but if my presence is not welcome ...\rquote 
\par Harry recognised his voice now; Travers was one of the Death Eaters who had been summoned to Xenophilius\rquote s house.
\par \lquote No, no, not at all, Travers,\rquote  said Hermione quickly, trying to cover up her mistake. \lquote How are you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I confess I am surprised to see you out and about, Bellatrix.\rquote 
\par \lquote Really? Why?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote Well,\rquote  Travers coughed, \lquote I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 heard }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par Harry willed Hermione to keep her head. If this was true, and Bellatrix was not supposed to be out in public \endash 
\par \lquote The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past,\rquote  said Hermione, in a magnificent imitation of Bellatrix\rquote s most contemptuous manner. \lquote 
Perhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine is, Travers.\rquote 
\par Though the Death Eater looked offended, he also seemed less suspicious. He glanced down at the man Ron had just Stunned.
\par \lquote How did it offend you?\rquote 
\par \lquote It does not matter, it will not do so again,\rquote  said Hermione coolly.
\par \lquote Some of these Wandless can be troublesome,\rquote  said Travers. \lquote While they do nothing but beg I have no objection, but one of them actually asked me to plead her case at the Ministry last week. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

he said, in a squeaky impersonation. \lquote As if I was going to give her my wand \endash  but whose wand,\rquote  said Travers curiously, \lquote are you using at the moment, Bellatrix? I heard that your own was \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I have my wand here,\rquote  said Hermione coldly, holding up Bellatrix\rquote s wand. \lquote I don\rquote t know what rumours you have been listening to, Travers, but you seem sadly misinformed.\rquote 
\par Travers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he turned instead to Ron.
\par \lquote Who is your friend? I do not recognise him.\rquote 
\par \lquote This is Dragomir Despard,\rquote  said Hermione; they had decided that a fictional foreigner was the safest cover for Ron to assume. \lquote He speaks very little English, but he is in sympathy with the Dark Lord\rquote s aims. He has tr
avelled here from Transylvania to see our new regime.\rquote 
\par \lquote Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?\rquote 
\par \lquote \rquote Ow you?\rquote  said Ron, holding out his hand.
\par Travers extended two fingers and shook Ron\rquote s hand as though frightened of dirtying himself.
\par \lquote So what brings you and your \endash  ah \endash  sympathetic friend to Diagon Alley this early?\rquote  asked Travers.
\par \lquote I need to visit Gringotts,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Alas, I also,\rquote  said Travers. \lquote Gold, filthy gold! We cannot live without it, yet I confess I deplore the necessity of consorting with our long-fingered friends.\rquote 
\par Harry felt Griphook\rquote s clasped hands tighten momentarily around his neck.
\par \lquote Shall we?\rquote  said Travers, gesturing Hermione forwards.
\par Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the crooked, cobbled street towards the place where the snowy-white Gringotts stood towering over the other little shops. Ron sloped along beside them, and Harry and Griphook followed.

\par A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and the worst of it was, with Travers marching at what he believed to be Bellatrix\rquote s side, there was no means for Harry to communi\-
cate with Hermione or Ron. All too soon they arrived at the foot 
of the marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors. As Griphook had already warned them, the liveried goblins who usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two wizards, both of whom were clutching long, thin golden rods.
\par \lquote Ah, Probity Probes,\rquote  sighed Travers theatrically, \lquote so crude \endash  but effective!\rquote 
\par And he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wizards, who raised the golden rods and passed them up and down his body. The Probes, Harry knew, detected spells of concealment and hidden
 magical objects. Knowing that he had only seconds, Harry pointed Draco\rquote s wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Confundo,\rquote  }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 twice. Unnoticed by Travers, who was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards gave a little start as the spells hit them.
\par Hermione\rquote s long, black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps.
\par \lquote One moment, Madam,\rquote  said the guard, raising his Probe.
\par \lquote But you\rquote ve just done that!\rquote  said Hermione, in Bellatrix\rquote s com\-manding, arrogant voice. Travers 
looked round, eyebrows raised. The guard was confused. He stared down at the thin, golden Probe and then at his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice, \lquote Yeah, you\rquote ve just checked them, Marius.\rquote 
\par Hermione swept forwards, Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook trotting invisibly behind them. Harry glanced back as they crossed the threshold: the wizards were both scratching their heads.
\par Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of silver and which carried the poem warning of dire retribution
 to potential thieves. Harry looked up at it, and all of a sudden a knife-sharp memory came to him: standing on this very spot on the day that he had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday of his life, and Hagrid standing beside him saying, }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Like I said, yeh\rquote d be mad ter try an\rquote  rob it\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
Gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had never known he possessed, and never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would return to steal ... But within se
conds they were standing in the vast marble hall of the bank.
\par The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools, serving the first customers of the day. Hermione, Ron and Travers headed towards an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin 
through an eyeglass. Hermione allowed Travers to step ahead of her on the pretext of explaining features of the hall to Ron.
\par The goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said to nobody in particular, \lquote Leprechaun,\rquote  and then greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key, which was examined and given back to him.
\par Hermione stepped forwards.
\par \lquote Madam Lestrange!\rquote  said the goblin, evidently startled. \lquote Dear me! How \endash  how may I help you today?\rquote 
\par \lquote I wish to enter my vault,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par The old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced around. Not only was Travers hanging back, watching, but several other goblins had looked up from their work to stare at Hermione.
\par \lquote You have ... identification?\rquote  asked the goblin.
\par \lquote Identification? I \endash  I have never been asked for identification before!\rquote  said Hermione.

\par \lquote Your wand will do, Madam,\rquote  said the goblin. He held out a slightly trembling hand, and in a dreadful blast of realisation Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix\rquote s wand had been stolen.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Act now, act now,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 whispered Griphook in Harry\rquote s ear, }{

\par Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the Cloak, pointed it at the old goblin and whispered, for the first time in his life, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Imperio!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par A curious sensation shot down Harry\rquote s arm, a feeling of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just cast. The goblin took Bellatrix\rquote 
s wand, examined it closely and then said, \lquote Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Hermione, \lquote no, no, that\rquote s mine \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote A new wand?\rquote  said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the goblins all around were watching. \lquote But how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?\rquote 
\par Harry acted without thinking: pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Imperio!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 once more.
\par \lquote Oh, yes, I see,\rquote  said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix\rquote s wand, \lquote yes, very handsome. And is it working well? I always think wands require a little breaking in, don\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry\rquote s enormous relief she accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment.
\par The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin approached.
\par \lquote I shall need the Clankers,\rquote  he told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed to his senior. \lquote 
Good, good! So, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange,\rquote  said the old goblin, hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight, \lquote I shall take you to your vault.\rquote 
\par He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily towards them, the contents of the leather bag still jingling. Travers was now standing quite still with his mouth hanging wide ope
n. Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding Travers with confusion.
\par \lquote Wait \endash  Bogrod!\rquote 
\par Another goblin came scurrying around the counter.
\par \lquote We have instructions,\rquote  he said, with a bow to Hermione, \lquote forgive me, Madam Lestrange, but there have been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.\rquote 
\par He whispered urgently in Bogrod\rquote s ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook him off.
\par \lquote I am aware of the instructions. Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her vault ... very old family ... old clients ... this way, please ...\rquote 
\par And, still clanking, he hurried towards one of the many doors leading off the hall. Harry looked back at Travers, who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, and made his decision: with a flick of his wand he made Travers 
come with them, walking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond, which was lit with flaming torches.
\par \lquote We\rquote re in trouble, they suspect,\rquote  said Harry, as the door slammed behind them and he pulled off the
 Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from his shoulders; neither Travers nor Bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry Potter in their midst. \lquote They\rquote re Imperiused,\rquote 
 he added, in response to Hermione and Ron\rquote s confused queries about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now standing there looking blank. \lquote I don\rquote t think I did it strongly enough, I don\rquote t know ...\rquote 
\par And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote You need to

\par \lquote We\rquote ve got this far, I say we go on,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Good!\rquote  said Griphook. \lquote So, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no longer have the authority. But there will not be room for the wizard.\rquote 
\par Harry pointed his wand at Travers.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Imperio!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace.
\par \lquote What are you making him do?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hide,\rquote  said Harry, as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a little cart which came trundling along the tracks towards them out of the darkness. Harry was sure he could h
ear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it, Bogrod in front with Griphook, Harry, Ron and Hermione crammed together in the back.
\par With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: they hurtled past Travers, who was wriggling into
 a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages, sloping downwards all the time. Harry could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the tracks: his hair flew behind him as they swerved between s
t
alactites, flying ever deeper into the earth, but he kept glancing back. They might as well have left enormous footprints behind them; the more he thought about it, the more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, to have brought along 
Bellatrix\rquote s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it \endash 
\par They were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track. Harry heard Griphook shout, \lquote No!\rquote 
 but there was no braking: they zoomed through it. Water filled Harry\rquote s eyes and mouth: he could not see or breathe: then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of it. Harry heard the cart smash int
o pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione shriek something and felt himself glide back towards the ground as though weight\-less, landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor.
\par \lquote C \endash  Cushioning Charm,\rquote  Hermione spluttered, as Ron pulled her to her feet: but to Harry\rquote 
s horror he saw that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood there in overlarge robes, sopping wet and completely herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless again. They were realising it as they looked at each other, feeling their own faces.
\par \lquote The Thief\rquote s Downfall!\rquote  said Griphook, clambering to his feet and looking back at the deluge on to the tracks, which Harry knew, now, had been more than water. \lquote It washes away all enchant\-
ment, all magical concealment! They know there are impostors in Gringotts, they have set off defences against us!\rquote 
\par Harry saw Hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag, and hurriedly thrust his own hand under his jacket to make sure he had not lost the Invisibility Cloak. Then he turned to see Bogrod shaking his head in bewilderment: the Thief\rquote 
s Downfall seemed to have lifted the Imperius Curse.
\par \lquote We need him,\rquote  said Griphook, \lquote we cannot enter the vault without a Gringotts goblin. And we need the Clankers!\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Imperio!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Harry said again; his voice echoed throu
gh the stone passage as he felt again the sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand. Bogrod submitted once more to his will, his befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference, as Ron hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal to
ols.
\par \lquote Harry, I think I can hear people coming!\rquote  said Hermione, and she pointed Bellatrix\rquote s wand at the waterfall and cried, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Protego!\rquote  }{

\par \lquote Good thinking,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote lead the way, Griphook!\rquote 
\par \lquote How are we going to get out again?\rquote  Ron asked, as they hurried on foot into the darkness after the goblin, Bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s worry about that when we have to,\rquote  said Harry. He was trying to listen: he thought he could hear something clanking and moving around nearby. \lquote Griphook, how much further?\rquote 
\par \lquote Not far, Harry Potter, not far ...\rquote 
\par And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which Harry had been prepared, but which still brought all of them to a halt.
\par A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them, barring access to four or five of the deepest vaults in the place. The beast\rquote s scales had turned pale and flaky during its long incarceration under the ground; its eyes were milkily pin
k: both rear legs bore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky floor. Its great, spiked wings, folded close to its body, would have filled the chamber if it spread them, and when it turned its ugly head towards them, 
it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble, opened its mouth and spat a jet of fire that sent them running back up the passageway.
\par \lquote It is partially blind,\rquote  panted Griphook, \lquote but even more savage for that. However, we have the means to control it. It has learned what to expect when the Clankers come. Give them to me.\rquote 
\par Ron passed the bag to Griphook and the goblin pulled out a number of small metal instruments that when shaken made a loud, ringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils. Griphook handed them out: Bogrod accepted his meekly.
\par \lquote You know what to do,\rquote  Griphook told Harry, Ron and Hermi\-one. \lquote It will expect pain when it hears the noise: it will retreat, and Bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault.\rquote 
\par They advanced round the corner again, shaking the Clankers and the noise echoed off the rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that the inside of Harry\rquote 
s skull seemed to vibrate with the din. The dragon let out another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see it trembling, and as they dr
ew nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face, and guessed that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the Clankers.
\par \lquote Make him press his hand to the door!\rquote  Griphook urged Harry, who turned his wand again upon 
Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the wood, and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cave-like opening crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and goblets, silver armour, the skins of strange creatures, some with long sp
ines, others with drooping wings, potions in jewelled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown.
\par \lquote Search, fast!\rquote  said Harry, as they all hurried inside the vault.
\par He had described Hufflepuff\rquote s cup to Ron and Hermione, but if it was the other, unknown Horcru
x that resided in this vault, he did not know what it looked like. He barely had time to glance around, however, before there was a muffled clunk from behind them: the door had reappeared, sealing them inside the vault, and they were plunged into total da
rkness.
\par \lquote No matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!\rquote  said Griphook, as Ron gave a shout of surprise. \lquote Light your wands, can\rquote t you? And hurry, we have very little time!\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Lumos!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par Harry shone his lit wand around the vault: its beam fell upon glittering jew
els, he saw the fake sword of Gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains. Ron and Hermione had lit their wands too, and were now examining the piles of objects surrounding them.
\par \lquote Harry, could this be \endash ? Aargh!\rquote 
\par Hermione screamed in pain an
d Harry turned his wand on her in time to see a jewelled goblet tumbling from her grip: but as it fell it split, and became a shower of goblets, so that a second later, with a great clatter, the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every directi
on, the original impossible to discern amongst them.
\par \lquote It burned me!\rquote  moaned Hermione, sucking her blistered fingers.
\par \lquote They have added Gemino and Flagrante Curses!\rquote  said Griphook. \lquote Everything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are worthless \endash  a
nd if you continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold!\rquote 
\par \lquote OK, don\rquote t touch anything!\rquote  said Harry desperately, but even as he said it, Ron accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot
, and twenty more exploded into being while Ron hopped on the spot, part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal.
\par \lquote Stand still, don\rquote t move!\rquote  said Hermione, clutching at Ron.
\par \lquote Just look around!\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Remember, the cup\rquote s small and gold, it\rquote s got a badger engraved on it, two handles \endash  otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaw\rquote s symbol anywhere, the eagle \endash \rquote 

\par They directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning cautiously on the spot. It was impossible not to brush up against anythi
ng; Harry sent a great cascade of fake Galleons on to the ground where they joined the goblets, and now there was scarcely room to place their feet, and the glowing gold blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a furnace. Harry\rquote 
s wandlight passed over shields and goblin-made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling. Higher and higher he raised the beam, until suddenly it found an object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble.

\par Ron and Hermione pointed their wands 
at it too, so that the little golden cup sparkled in a three-way spotlight: the cup that had belonged to Helga Hufflepuff, which had passed into the possession of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle.
\par \lquote And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything?\rquote  asked Ron.

cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten, in her desperation, what Griphook had told them during their planning sessions.
\par \lquote No use, no use!\rquote  snarled the goblin.
\par \lquote Then what do we do?\rquote  said Harry, glaring at the goblin. \lquote If you want the sword, Griphook, then you\rquote ll have to help us more than \endash  wait! Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it here!\rquote 
\par Hermione fumbled inside her robes, drew out the beaded bag, rummaged for a few seconds, then removed the shining sword. Harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a silver flagon nearby, which did not multiply.
\par \lquote If I can just poke the sword through a handle \endash  but how am I going to get up there?\rquote 
\par The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them, even Ron, who was tallest. The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down Harry\rquote 
s face and back as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup; and then he heard the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door, and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder.
\par They were truly trapped now: there was no way out except through the door, and a horde of goblins seemed to be approach\-ing on the other side. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and saw terror in their faces.
\par \lquote Hermione,\rquote  said Harry, as the clanking grew louder, \lquote I\rquote ve got to get up there, we\rquote ve got to get rid of it \endash \rquote 
\par She raised her wand, pointed it at Harry and whispered, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Levicorpus.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 

\par Hoisted into the air by his ank
le, Harry hit a suit of armour and replicas burst out of it like white-hot bodies, filling the cramped space. With screams of pain Ron, Hermione and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate. Half-buried in a ris
ing tide of red-hot treasure, they struggled and yelled as Harry thrust the sword through the handle of Hufflepuff\rquote s cup, hooking it on to the blade.

screeched Hermione, in an attempt to protect herself, Ron and the goblins from the burning metal.
\par Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down: Ron and Hermione were waist-deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left i
n view.
\par Harry seized Griphook\rquote s fingers and pulled. The blistered goblin emerged by degrees, howling.

yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure, and the sword flew out of Harry\rquote s hand.
\par \lquote Get it!\rquote  Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on his skin, as Griphook clambered on to his shoulders again, deter\-mined to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot objects. \lquote Where\rquote s the sword? It had the cup on it!
\rquote 
\par The clanking on the other side of the door was growing deafening \endash  it was too late \endash 
\par \lquote There!\rquote 
\par It was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who lunged, and in that instant Harry knew that the goblin had never expected them to keep their word. One hand holding tightly to a fistful of Harry\rquote s h
air to make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold, Griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung it high out of Harry\rquote s reach.
\par The tiny golden cup, skewered by the handle on the sword\rquote s blade, was flung into the air. The goblin still 
astride him, Harry dived and caught it, and although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it, even while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the vault opened up again and he found hi
mself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore him, Ron and Hermione into the outer chamber.
\par Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne along on the swell of replicating treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword, but Griphook was gone. Sliding from Harry\rquote 
s shoulders the moment he could, he had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and crying, \lquote Thieves! Thieves! Help! Thieves!\rquote 
 He vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd, all of whom were holding daggers and who accepted him without question.
\par Slipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to his feet and knew that the only way out was through.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Stupefy!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 he 
bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined in: jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins and some toppled over, but others advanced, and Harry saw several wizard guards running round the corner.
\par The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame fle
w over the goblins: the wizards fled, doubled-up, back the way they had come, and inspiration, or madness, came to Harry. Pointing his wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor he yelled, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote This way!\rquote  Harry yelled, and still shooting Stunning Spells at the advancing goblins he sprinted towards the blind dragon.
\par \lquote Harry \endash  Harry \endash  what are you doing?\rquote  cried Hermione.
\par \lquote Get up, climb up, come on \endash \rquote 
\par The dragon had not realised that it was free: Harry\rquote 
s foot found the crook of its hind leg and he pulled himself up on to its back. The scales were hard as steel: it did not even seem to feel him. He stretched out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; Ron climbed on behind them, and a second later the drago
n became aware that it was untethered.
\par With a roar it reared: Harry dug in his knees, clutching as tightly as he could to the jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles, and it soared into the air. Harry, Ron and H
ermione, flat on its back, scraped against the ceiling as it dived towards the passage opening, while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that glanced off its flanks.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll never get out, it\rquote s too big!\rquote 
 Hermione screamed, but the dragon opened its mouth and belched flame again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled. By sheer force the dragon clawed and fought its way through. Harry\rquote 
s eyes were tight shut against the heat and dust: deafened by the crashing of rock and the dragon\rquote s roars, he could only cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then he heard Hermione yelling, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Defodio!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceiling 
as it struggled upwards, towards the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking goblins: Harry and Ron copied her, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They passed the underground lake, and the great crawling, snarling beast seemed 
to sense freedom and space ahead of it, and behind them the passage was full of the dragon\rquote 
s thrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of rock, gigantic, fractured stalactites, and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled, while ahead, the dragon\rquote s fire kept their progress clear \endash 
\par And then at last, by the combined force of their spells and the dragon\rquote s brute strength, they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hallway. Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and f
inally the dragon had room to stretch its wings: turning its horned head towards the cool outside air it could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with Harry, Ron and Hermione still clinging to its back, it forced its way through the metal doors, 
leaving them buckled and hanging from their hinges as it staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into the sky.

After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread that the dragon was going to throw them off, for 
it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison as possible, but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening. He had no idea how long dragons could fly without landing, nor how this partic
ular dragon, which could barely see, would locate a good place to put down. He glanced around constantly, imagining that he could feel his scar prickling ...
\par How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had broken into the Lestranges\rquote  vault? How soo
n would the goblins of Gringotts notify Bellatrix? How quickly would they realise what had been taken? And then, when they discovered that the golden cup was missing? Voldemort would know, at last, that they were hunting Horcruxes ...
\par The dragon seemed to 
crave cooler and fresher air: it climbed steadily until they were flying through wisps of chilly cloud and Harry could no longer make out the little coloured dots which were cars pouring in and out of the capital. On and on they flew, over countryside par
celled out in patches of green and brown, over roads and rivers winding through the landscape like strips of matt and glossy ribbon.
\par \lquote What do you reckon it\rquote s looking for?\rquote  Ron yelled, as they flew further and further north.
\par \lquote No idea,\rquote  Harry bellowed back. H
is hands were numb with cold but he did not dare attempt to shift his grip. He had been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them, if the dragon headed for open sea: he was cold and numb, not to mention desperately
 hungry and thirsty. When, he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten? Surely it would need sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, it realised it had three highly edible humans sitting on its back?
\par The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was 
turning indigo; and still the dragon flew, cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath them, its enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a great, dark cloud. Every part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon\rquote s back.
\par \lquote Is it my imagination,\rquote  shouted Ron, after a considerable stretch of silence, \lquote or are we losing height?\rquote 
\par Harry looked down and saw deep-green mountains and lakes, coppery in the sunset. The landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he squinted over the side o
f the dragon and he wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight.
\par Lower and lower the dragon flew, in great, spiralling circles, honing in, it seemed, upon one of the smaller lakes.
\par \lquote I say we jump when it gets low enough!\rquote  Harry called back to the others. \lquote Straight into the water before it realises we\rquote re here!\rquote 
\par They agreed, Hermione a little faintly: and now Harry could see the dragon\rquote s wide, yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water.
\par \lquote NOW!\rquote 
\par He slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted, feet first, towards the surface of the lake; the drop was greater than he had estimated and he hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a freezing, green, reed-filled world. He kicked towards t
h
e surface and emerged, panting, to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione had fallen. The dragon did not seem to have noticed anything: it was already fifty feet away, swooping low over the lake to scoop up water 
in its scarred snout. As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and gasping from the depths of the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at last on a distant bank.
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore. The lake did
 not seem to be deep: soon it was more a question of fighting their way through reeds and mud than swimming, and finally they flopped, sodden, panting and exhausted, on to slippery grass.
\par Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have happily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand and started casting the usual protective spells around them.
\par When he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time that he had seen them properly since escaping from the 
vault. Both had angry red burns all over their faces and arms, and their clothing was singed away in places. They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany on to their many injuries. Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of 
pumpkin juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them. They changed and then gulped down the juice.
\par \lquote Well, on the up side,\rquote  said Ron finally, who was sitting watching the skin on his hands regrow, \lquote we got the Horcrux. On the down side \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  no sword,\rquote  said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped dittany through the singed hole in his jeans on to the angry burn beneath.
\par \lquote No sword,\rquote  repeated Ron. \lquote That double-crossing little scab ...\rquote 
\par Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just taken off and set it down on the grass in front of them. Glinting in the sun, it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice.
\par \lquote At least we can\rquote t wear it this time, that\rquote d look a bit weird hanging round our necks,\rquote  said Ron, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand.
\par Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank, where the dragon was still drinking.
\par \lquote What\rquote ll happen to it, do you think?\rquote  she asked. \lquote Will it be all right?\rquote 
\par \lquote You sound like Hagrid,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote It\rquote s a dragon, Hermione, it can look after itself. It\rquote s us we need to worry about.\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I don\rquote t know how to break this to you,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote but I think they }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 might }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult to stop. Harry\rquote s ribs ached, he felt light-headed with hunger, but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was raw.
\par \lquote What are we going to do, though?\rquote  said Hermione finally, hiccoughing herself back to seriousness. \lquote He\rquote ll know, won\rquote t he? You-Know-Who will know we know about his Horcruxes!\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe they\rquote ll be too scared to tell him?\rquote  said Ron hopefully. \lquote Maybe they\rquote ll cover up \endash \rquote 
\par The sky, the smell of lake water, the sound of Ron\rquote s voice were extinguished: pain cleaved Harry\rquote 
s head like a sword stroke. He was standing in a dimly lit room, and a semi-circle of wizards faced him, and on the floor at his feet knelt a small, quaking figure.
\par \lquote What did you say to me?\rquote  His voice was high and cold, but fury and fear burned inside him. The one thing he had dreaded \endash  but it could not be true, he could not see how ...

and again and again his wand fell, and those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, for hearing about the golden cup \endash 
\par Alone amongst the dead, he stormed up and down, and they passed before him in vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to immortality \endash  the diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen; what if, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

the boy knew about the others? Could he know, had he already acted, had he traced more of them? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had al
ways suspected him, Dumbledore, dead on his orders, Dumbledore, whose wand was his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 the boy 
\endash }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord Voldemort, would have known
, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of them all, he, the most powerful, he, the killer of Dumbledore and of how many other worthless, nameless men: how could Lord Voldemort not have known, if he, himself, most important and precious, had been at
tacked, mutilated?
\par True, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had thought that was because he had no body to feel, being less than ghost ... no, surely, the rest were safe ... the other Horcruxes must be intact ...
\par But he must know, he must be sure ... He paced the room, kicking aside the goblin\rquote s corpse as he passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts \endash 
\par A modicum of calm cooled his rage now: how could the boy know that he had h
idden the ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to be related to the Gaunts, he had hidden the connection, the killings had never been traced to him: the ring, surely, was safe.
\par And how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or penetrate its protection? The idea of the locket being stolen was absurd ...
\par As for the school: he alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the Horcrux, because he alone had plumbed the deepest secrets of that place ...
\par And there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no longer sent to do his bidding, under his protection ...
\par But to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his hiding places, he must redouble protection around each of his Horcruxes ... a job, like the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must undertake alone ...
\par Which should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old unease flickered inside him. Dumbledore had known his middle name ... Dumbledore might have made the connection with the Gaunts ... their abandoned home wa
s, perhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was there that he would go first ...
\par The lake, surely impossible ... though was there a slight possibility that Dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds, through the orphanage.
\par And Hogwarts
 ... but he knew that his Horcrux there was safe, it would be impossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that the boy might try to re-enter the castle ... 
to tell Snape why the boy might return would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and Malfoy: didn\rquote t their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was, ever, to trust?
\par He would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him: he would not be parted from the snake any more ... And he strode from the room, through the hall and out into the dark garden where the fountain played; he called the snake in Parsel\-
tongue and it slithered out to join him like a long shadow ...
\par Harry\rquote s eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present: he was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione were looking down at him. Judging by their worried looks, and by the continued pounding of his scar,
 his sudden excursion into Voldemort\rquote 
s mind had not passed unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that he was still wet to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before him and the lake, deep-blue shot with gold in the failing sun.
\par \lquote He knows.\rquote  His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemort\rquote s high screams. \lquote He knows, and he\rquote s going to check where the others are, and the last one,\rquote  he was already on his feet, \lquote

\par Ron was gaping at him; Hermione knelt up, looking worried.

\par \lquote We need to get going,\rquote  said Harry firmly. He had been hoping to sleep, looking forward to getting into the new tent, but that was impossible now. \lquote Can you imagine what he\rquote

\par \lquote But how are we going to get in?\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote ll go to Hogsmeade,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote and try to work some\-thing out once we see what the protection around the school\rquote s like. Get under the Cloak, Hermione, I want to stick together this time.\rquote 
\par \lquote But we don\rquote t really fit \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote ll be dark, no one\rquote s going to notice our feet.\rquote 
\par The flapp
ing of enormous wings echoed across the black water: the dragon had drunk its fill and risen into the air. They paused in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher, now black against the rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a nearby 
mountain. Then Hermione walked forwards and took her place between the other two. Harry pulled the Cloak down as far as it would go, and together they turned on the spot into the crushing darkness.

\par Harry seized Ron\rquote s wrist as he raised his wand. There were too many of them to Stun: even attempting it would give away their position. One of the Death Eaters waved his wand and the scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains.

\par \lquote Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?\rquote  yelled the Death Eater who had tried the charm, and then, to his fellows, \lquote Spread out. He\rquote s here.\rquote 
\par Six of the Death Eaters ran towards them: Harry, Ron and Hermione backed
, as quickly as possible, down the nearest side street and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying along the street from the Death Eaters\rquote 
 searching wands.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s just leave!\rquote  Hermione whispered. \lquote Disapparate now!\rquote 
\par \lquote Great idea,\rquote  said Ron, but before Harry could reply, a Death Eater shouted, \lquote We know you\rquote re here, Potter, and there\rquote s no getting away! We\rquote ll find you!\rquote 
\par \lquote They were ready for us,\rquote  whispered Harry. \lquote They set up that spell to tell them we\rquote d come. I reckon they\rquote ve done something to keep us here, trap us \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What about Dementors?\rquote  called another Death Eater. \lquote Let \rquote em have free rein, they\rquote d find him quick enough!\rquote 
\par \lquote The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  an\rquote  Dementors won\rquote t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter\rquote s life, not his soul. He\rquote ll be easier to kill if he\rquote s been kissed first!\rquote 
\par There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: to repel Dementors they would have to produce Patronuses, which would give them away immediately.
\par \lquote We\rquote re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!\rquote  Hermione whispered.
\par Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold begin to steal over the street. Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In the pitch blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spo
t.
\par The air through which they needed to move seemed to have become solid: they could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper into Harry\rquote 
s flesh. He, Ron and Hermione retreated down the side street,
 groping their way along the wall, trying not to make a sound. Then, round the corner, gliding noiselessly, came Dementors, ten or more of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with their black cloaks and their scab
bed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry was sure of it: they seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths he detested, tasting despair on the air, closing in \endash 
\par He raised his wand: he could not, would not, suffer the Dementor\rquote s kiss, whatever happened afterwards. It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Expecto patronum!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: the Dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight.
\par \lquote It\rquote s him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a stag!\rquote 
\par The Dementors had retreated, the stars were popping out again, and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could d
ecide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-hand side of the narrow street and a rough voice said, \lquote Potter, in here, quick!\rquote 
\par He obeyed without hesitation: the three of them hurtled through the open doorway.
\par \lquote Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!\rquote  muttered a tall figure, passing them on his way into the street and slamming the door behind him.
\par Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust-strewn bar of the Hog\rquote 
s Head. They ran behind the counter and through a second doorway, which led to a rickety wooden staircase, which they climbed as fast as they could. The stairs opened on to a sitting room with a threadbare carpet and a small fireplace, above
 which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of vacant sweetness.
\par Shouts reached them from the street below. Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak, they crept towards the grimy window and looked down. Their saviour, whom Harry now recognised as the Hog\rquote s Head\rquote 
s barman, was the only person not wearing a hood.
\par \lquote So what?\rquote  he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. \lquote So what? You send Dementors down my street, I\rquote ll send a Patronus back at \rquote em! I\rquote m not having \rquote em near me, I\rquote ve told you that, I\rquote

\par \lquote That wasn\rquote t your Patronus!\rquote  said a Death Eater. \lquote That was a stag, it was Potter\rquote s!\rquote

\par \lquote Don\rquote t you worry about us,\rquote  said one of the Death Eaters, \lquote worry about yourself, breaking curfew!\rquote

\par \lquote All right, we made a mistake,\rquote  said the second Death Eater. \lquote Break curfew again and we won\rquote t be so lenient!\rquote 
\par The Death Eaters strode back towards the High Street. Hermione moaned with relief, wove out from under the Cloak and sat down on a wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains tight shut, then pul
led the Cloak off himself and Ron. They could hear the barman down below, rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing the stairs.
\par Harry\rquote s attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece: a small, rectangular mirror propped on top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl.
\par The barman entered the room.
\par \lquote You bloody fools,\rquote  he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of them. \lquote What were you thinking, coming here?\rquote 
\par \lquote Thank you,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote we can\rquote t thank you enough. You saved our lives.\rquote 
\par The barman grunted. Harry approached him, looking up into the face, trying to see past the long, stringy, wire-grey hair and beard. He wore spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant blue.
\par \lquote It\rquote s your eye I\rquote ve been seeing in the mirror.\rquote 
\par There was silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each other.
\par \lquote You sent Dobby.\rquote 
\par The barman nodded and looked around for the elf.
\par \lquote Thought he\rquote d be with you. Where\rquote ve you left him?\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s dead,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.\rquote 
\par The barman\rquote s face was impassive. After a few moments, he said, \lquote I\rquote m sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.\rquote 
\par He turned away, lighting lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at any of them.
\par \lquote You\rquote re Aberforth,\rquote  said Harry, to the man\rquote s back.
\par He neither confirmed nor denied it, but bent to light the fire.
\par \lquote How did you get this?\rquote  Harry asked, walking across to Sirius\rquote s mirror, the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before.
\par \lquote Bought it from Dung \rquote bout a year ago,\rquote  said Aberforth. \lquote Albus told me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.\rquote 
\par Ron gasped.
\par \lquote The silver doe!\rquote  he said excitedly. \lquote Was that you too?\rquote 
\par \lquote What are you talking about?\rquote  said Aberforth.
\par \lquote Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!\rquote 
\par \lquote Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven\rquote t I just proved my Patronus is a goat?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Yeah ... well, I\rquote m hungry!\rquote  he added defensively, as his stomach gave an enormous rumble.
\par \lquote I got food,\rquote 
 said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in front of the fire. Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a wh
ile there was silence but for the crackle of the fire, the clink of goblets and the sound of chewing.
\par \lquote Right then,\rquote  said Aberforth, when they had eaten their fill, and Harry and Ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs. \lquote We need to think of the best way to get you out of here. Can\rquote 
t be done by night, you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness: Caterwauling Charm\rquote s set off, they\rquote ll be on to you like Bowtruckles on Doxy eggs. I don\rquote t reckon I\rquote 
ll be able to pass off a stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak, when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you\rquote 
ll be able to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He\rquote s been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him.\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re not leaving,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote We need to get into Hogwarts.\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be stupid, boy,\rquote  said Aberforth.
\par \lquote We\rquote ve got to,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote What you\rquote ve got to do,\rquote  said Aberforth, leaning forwards, \lquote is to get as far from here as you can.\rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t understand. There isn\rquote t much time. We\rquote ve got to get into the castle. Dumbledore \endash  I mean, your brother \endash  wanted us \endash \rquote 
\par The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth\rquote s glasses momentarily opaque, a bright, flat white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog.
\par \lquote My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,\rquote  said Aberforth, \lquote and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans. You get away from this school, Pott
er, and out of the country if you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes. He\rquote s gone where none of this can hurt him, and you don\rquote t owe him anything.\rquote 
\par \lquote You don\rquote t understand,\rquote  said Harry again.
\par \lquote Oh, don\rquote t I?\rquote  said Aberforth quietly. \lquote You don\rquote t think I understood my own brother? Think you knew Albus better than I did?\rquote 
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t mean that,\rquote  said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine. \lquote It\rquote s ... he left me a job.\rquote 
\par \lquote Did he, now?\rquote  said Aberforth. \lquote Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing you\rquote d expert an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?\rquote

\par Harry wanted with all his heart to say \lquote yes\rquote , but somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips. Aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking.
\par \lquote I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother\rquote s knee. Secrets and lies, that\rquote s how we grew up, and Albus ... he was a natural.\rquote 
\par The old man\rquote s eyes travelled to the painting of the girl over the mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only picture in the room. There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of anyone else.
\par \lquote Mr Dumbledore?\rquote  said Hermione rather timidly. \lquote Is that your sister? Ariana?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes,\rquote  said Aberforth tersely. \lquote Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you, missy?\rquote 
\par Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned red.
\par \lquote Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,\rquote  said Harry, trying to spare Hermione.
\par \lquote That old berk,\rquote  muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of mead. \lquote Thought the sun shone out of my brother\rquote s every orifice, he did. Well, so did plenty of people, you three included, by the looks of it.\rquote 
\par Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about Dumbledore that had riddled him for months now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby\rquote 
s grave; he had decided to continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know, but simp
ly to trust. He had no desire to doubt again, he did not want to hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose. He met Aberforth\rquote s gaze, which was so strikingly like his brother\rquote 
s: the bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking, and despised him for it.
\par \lquote Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,\rquote  said Hermione in a low voice.
\par \lquote Did he, now?\rquote  said Aberforth. \lquote Funny thing, how many of the people my brother cared about very much, ended up in a worse state than if he\rquote d left \rquote em well alone.\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you mean?\rquote  asked Hermione breathlessly.
\par \lquote Never you mind,\rquote  said Aberforth.
\par \lquote But that\rquote s a really serious thing to say!\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Are you \endash  are you talking about your sister?\rquote 
\par Aberforth glared at her: his lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back. Then he burst into speech.
\par \lquote When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, set upon, by three Muggle boys. They\rquote d seen her doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge: she was a kid, she couldn\rquote 
t control it, no witch or wizard can at that age. What they saw scared them, I expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and when she couldn\rquote t show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.\rquote 

\par Hermione\rquote s eyes were huge in the firelight: Ron looked slightly sick. Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain.
\par \lquote It destroyed her, what they did: she was never right again. She wouldn\rquote t use magic, but she couldn\rquote t get rid of it: it turned inwards and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn\rquote 
t control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet, and scared, and harmless.
\par \lquote And my father went after the bastards that did it,\rquote  said Aberforth, \lquote and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he\rquote d done it, because if the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she
\rquote d have been locked up in St Mungo\rquote s for good. They\rquote d have seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn\rquote 
t keep it in any longer.
\par \lquote We had to keep her safe, and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote I}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640  was her favourite,\rquote  he said, and as he said it, a grubby school\-
boy seemed to look out through Aberforth\rquote s wrinkles and tangled beard. \lquote Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was home, reading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with \'93
the most notable magical names of the day\'94,\rquote  Aberforth sneered, \lquote he didn\rquote t want to be bothered with her. She liked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn\rquote 
t do it for my mother, I could get her to calm down when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats.
\par \lquote Then, when she was fourteen ... see, I wasn\rquote t there,\rquote  said Aberforth. \lquote If I\rquote d been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn\rquote 
t as young as she was, and ... it was an accident. Ariana couldn\rquote t control it. But my mother was killed.\rquote 
\par Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to hear any more, but Aberforth kept talking and Harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; whether, in fact, he had ever spoken about it.
\par \lquote So that put paid to Albus\rquote s trip round the world with little Doge. The pair of \rquote em came home for my mother\rquote s funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. Ha!\rquote 
\par Aberforth spat into the fire.
\par \lquote I\rquote d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn\rquote t care about school, I\rquote d have stayed home and done it. He told me I had to finish my education and }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

s no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping her blowing up the house every other day. But he did all right for a few weeks ... \rquote til he came.\rquote 
\par And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth\rquote s face.
\par \lquote Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 equal }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 and whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of all wizardkind, and if one young girl got neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par \lquote But after a few weeks of it, I\rquote d had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go back to Hogwarts, so I told \rquote em, both of \rquote em, face to face, like I am to you, now,\rquote  and A
berforth looked down at Harry, and it took little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder brother. \lquote I told him, you\rquote d better give it up, now. You can\rquote t move her, she\rquote

 said Aberforth, and his eyes were briefly occluded by the firelight on the lenses of his glasses: they shone white and blind again. \lquote Grindelwald didn\rquote 
t like that at all. He got angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother ... didn\rquote t I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 to be hidden once they\rquote d changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the Muggles their place?
\par \lquote And there was an argument ... and I pulled out my wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother\rquote s best friend \endash  and Albus was trying to s
top him, and then all three of us were duelling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn\rquote t stand it \endash \rquote 
\par The colour was draining from Aberforth\rquote s face as though he had suffered a mortal wound.
\par \lquote \endash  and I think she wanted to help, but she didn\rquote t really know what she was doing, and I don\rquote t know which of us did it, it could have been any of us \endash  and she was dead.\rquote 
\par His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. Hermione\rquote s face was wet with tears and Ron was almost
 as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: he wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash his mind clean of it.
\par \lquote I\rquote m so ... I\rquote m so sorry,\rquote  Hermione whispered.
\par \lquote Gone,\rquote  croaked Aberforth. \lquote Gone forever.\rquote 
\par He wiped his nose on his cuff, and cleared his throat.
\par \lquote \rquote Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own country, and he didn\rquote t want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn\rquote 
t he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote He was never free,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote I beg your pardon?\rquote  said Aberforth.
\par \lquote Never,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote The night that your brother died he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, pleading with someone who wasn\rquote t there. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details about what had happened on the island on the lake: the events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly.
\par \lquote He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did,\rquote  said Harry, remembering Dumbledore whimpering, pleading. \lquote He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana ... it was torture to him, if you\rquote 
d seen him then, you wouldn\rquote t say he was free.\rquote 
\par Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. After a long pause, he said, \lquote How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn\rquote t more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be sure you aren
\rquote t dispensable, just like my little sister?\rquote 
\par A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry\rquote s heart.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,\rquote  said Hermione.
\par \lquote Why didn\rquote t he tell him to hide, then?\rquote  shot back Aberforth. \lquote Why didn\rquote t he say to him, take care of yourself, here\rquote s how to survive?\rquote 
\par \lquote Because,\rquote  said Harry, before Hermione could answer, \lquote some\-times you\rquote ve }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 got }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote \'93The Order of the Phoenix is finished,\'94\rquote  Harry repeated. \lquote \'93You-Know-Who\rquote s won, it\rquote s over, and anyone who\rquote s pretending different\rquote s kidding themselves.\'94\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t say I like it, but it\rquote s the truth!\rquote 
\par \lquote No, it isn\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and he passed the knowledge on to me. I\rquote m going to keep going until I succeed \endash  or I die. Don\rquote t think I don\rquote t know how this m
ight end. I\rquote ve known it for years.\rquote 
\par He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely scowled.
\par \lquote We need to get into Hogwarts,\rquote  said Harry again. \lquote If you can\rquote t help us, we\rquote ll wait \rquote til daybreak, leave you in peace and try to find a way in ourselves. If you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 can }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 help us \endash  well, now would be a great time to mention it.\rquote 
\par Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eyes that were so extraordinarily like his brother\rquote s. At last he cleared his throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table and approached the portrait of Ariana.
\par \lquote You know what to do,\rquote  he said.
\par She smiled, turned and walked away, not as people in portraits usually did, out of the sides of their frames, but along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted b
ehind her. They watched her slight figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness.
\par \lquote Er \endash  what \endash ?\rquote  began Ron.
\par \lquote There\rquote s only one way in, now,\rquote  said Aberforth. \lquote You must know they\rquote ve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, 
Dementors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. How you expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his Deputie
s ... well, that\rquote s your lookout, isn\rquote t it? You say you\rquote re prepared to die.\rquote 
\par \lquote But what ...?\rquote  said Hermione, frowning at Ariana\rquote s picture.
\par A tiny white dot had reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back towards them, growing 
bigger and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she was, who was limping along looking excited. His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen it: he appeared to have suffered several gashes to his face and his c
l
othes were ripped and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole thing swung forwards on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And out of it
, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled, \lquote I knew you\rquote d come! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

But Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione, and with yells of delight was hugging them too. The longer Harry looked at Neville, the worse he appeared: one of his eyes was swollen, yellow and purple, there were gouge marks on his 
face, and his general air of unkemptness suggested that he had been living rough. Nevertheless, his battered visage shone with happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, \lquote I knew you\rquote 
d come! Kept telling Seamus it was a matter of time!\rquote 
\par \lquote Neville, what\rquote s happened to you?\rquote 
\par \lquote What? This?\rquote  Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head. \lquote This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You\rquote ll see. Shall we get going, then? Oh,\rquote  he turned to Aberforth, \lquote 
Ab, there might be a couple more people on the way.\rquote 
\par \lquote Couple more?\rquote  repeated Aberforth ominously. \lquote What d\rquote you mean, a couple more, Longbottom? There\rquote s a curfew and a Caterwauling Charm on the whole village!\rquote 
\par \lquote I know, that\rquote s why they\rquote ll be Apparating directly into the bar,\rquote  said Neville. \lquote Just send them down the passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot.\rquote 
\par Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb up on to the mantelpiece and into the tunnel; Ron followed, then Neville. Harry addressed Aberforth.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t know how to thank you. You\rquote ve saved our lives, twice.\rquote 
\par \lquote Look after \rquote em, then,\rquote  said Aberforth gruffly. \lquote I might not be able to save \rquote em a third time.\rquote 
\par Harry clambered up on to the mantelpiece and through the hole behind Ariana\rquote s portrait. There were smooth stone steps on the other side: i
t looked as though the passageway had been there for years. Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor was worn and smooth; as they walked, their shadows rippled, fan-like, across the wall.
\par \lquote How long\rquote s this been here?\rquote  Ron asked, as they set off. \lquote It isn\rquote t on the Marauder\rquote s Map, is it, Harry? I thought there were only seven passages in and out of school?\rquote 
\par \lquote They sealed off all of those before the start of the year,\rquote  said Neville. \lquote There\rquote s no chance of getting through any of them now, not with curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and Dementors waiting at the exits.\rquote 
 He started walking backwards, beaming, drinking them in. \lquote Never mind that stuff ... is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a dragon? It\rquote s everywhere, everyone\rquote s
 talking about it, Terry Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, it\rquote s true,\rquote  said Harry.
\par Neville laughed gleefully.
\par \lquote What did you do with the dragon?\rquote 
\par \lquote Released it into the wild,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote Hermione was all for keeping it as a pet \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t exaggerate, Ron \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But what have you been doing? People have been saying you\rquote ve just been on the run, Harry, but I don\rquote t think so. I think you\rquote ve been up to something.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re right,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven\rquote t heard anything.\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s been ... well, it\rquote s not really like Hogwarts any more,\rquote  said Neville, the smile fading from his face as he spoke. \lquote Do you know about the Carrows?\rquote 
\par \lquote Those two Death Eaters who teach here?\rquote 
\par \lquote They do more than teach,\rquote  said Neville. \lquote They\rquote re in charge of all discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.\rquote 
\par \lquote Like Umbridge?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don\rquote t, though, if they can avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.
\par \lquote Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defence Against the Dark Arts, except now it\rquote s just the Dark Arts. We\rquote re supposed to practise the Cruciatus Curse on people who\rquote ve earned detentions \endash \rquote

\par Harry, Ron and Hermione\rquote s united voices echoed up and down the passage.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Neville. \lquote That\rquote s how I got this one,\rquote  he pointed at a particularly deep gash in his cheek, \lquote I refused to do it. Some people are into it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they\rquote 
ve ever been top in anything, I expect.
\par \lquote Alecto, Amycus\rquote s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for everyone. We\rquote ve all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid
 and dirty, and how they drove wizards into hiding by being vicious towards them, and how the natural order is being re-established. I got this one,\rquote  he indicated another slash to his face, \lquote 
for asking her how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got.\rquote 
\par \lquote Blimey, Neville,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote there\rquote s a time and a place for getting a smart mouth.\rquote 
\par \lquote You didn\rquote t hear her,\rquote  said Neville. \lquote You wouldn\rquote t have stood it either. The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote But they\rquote ve used you as a knife sharpener,\rquote  said Ron, wincing slightly as they passed a lamp and Neville\rquote s injuries were thrown into even greater relief.
\par Neville shrugged.

\par Harry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was saying or the matter-of-fact tone in which he said them.

\par \lquote Neville, she\rquote s all right, we\rquote ve seen her \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me.\rquote 
\par From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognised it as one of the fake Galleons that Dumbledore\rquote s Army had used to send one another messages.
\par \lquote These have been great,\rquote  said Neville, beaming at Hermione. \lquote The Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 used to?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 said Harry, who had noticed the past tense.
\par \lquote Well, it got more difficult as time went on,\rquote  said Neville. \lquote We lost Luna at Christmas and Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort of the leaders. The Carrows seemed to know I was behind a lot of it, so t
hey started coming down on me hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year they\rquote d chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off.\rquote 
\par \lquote No kidding,\rquote  muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope upwards.
\par \lquote Yeah, well, I couldn\rquote t ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. That\rquote 
s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran.\rquote 
\par \lquote They }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 what?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640  said Harry, Ron and Hermione together.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was climbing so steeply, \lquote well, you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave, I s\rquote 
pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way round. Thing was,\rquote  he faced them, and Harry was aston\-ished to see that he was grinning, \lquote 
they bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living alone, they probably thought they didn\rquote t need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway,\rquote  Neville laughed, \lquote Dawlish is still in St Mungo\rquote 
s and Gran\rquote s on the run. She sent me a letter,\rquote  he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, \lquote telling me she was proud of me, that I\rquote m my parents\rquote  son, and to keep it up.\rquote 
\par \lquote Cool,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote Yeah,\rquote  said Neville happily. \lquote Only thing was, once they realised they had no hold over me, they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all. I don\rquote 
t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban, either way, I knew it was time to disappear.\rquote 
\par \lquote But,\rquote  said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, \lquote aren\rquote t \endash  aren\rquote t we heading straight back into Hogwarts?\rquote 
\par \lquote \rquote Course,\rquote  said Neville. \lquote You\rquote ll see. We\rquote re here.\rquote 
\par They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage. Another short flight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind Ariana\rquote s portrait. 
Neville pushed it open and climbed through. As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out to unseen people: \lquote Look who it is! Didn\rquote t I tell you?\rquote 
\par As Harry emerged into the room beyond the passage, there were several screams and yells \endash 
\par \lquote HARRY!\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s Potter, it\rquote s POTTER!\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron!\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Hermione!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par He had a confused impression of coloured hangings, of lamps and many faces. The next moment, he, Ron and Hermione were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, their hair ruffled, their hands shaken, by what seemed to be mor
e than twenty people: they might just have won a Quidditch final.
\par \lquote OK, OK, calm down!\rquote  Neville called, and as the crowd backed away, Harry was able to take in their surroundings.
\par He did not recognise the room at all. It was enormous, and looked rather like the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship\rquote 
s cabin. Multicoloured hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from a balcony that ran around the dark wood-panelled and windowless walls, which were covered in bright tapes
try hangings: Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow, and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases, a f
ew broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wooden-cased wireless.
\par \lquote Where are we?\rquote 
\par \lquote Room of Requirement, of course!\rquote  said Neville. \lquote Surpassed itself, hasn\rquote t it? The Carrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hid
eout: I managed to get through the door and this is what I found! Well, it wasn\rquote t exactly like this when I arrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. But it\rquote 
s expanded as more and more of the DA have arrived.\rquote 
\par \lquote And the Carrows can\rquote t get in?\rquote  asked Harry, looking around for the door.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognised until he spoke: Seamus\rquote s face was bruised and puffy. \lquote It\rquote s a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in here, they can\rquote t get at us, the door won\rquote 
t open. It\rquote s all down to Neville. He really }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 gets }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 this Room. You\rquote 
ve got to ask it for }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 exactly }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 what you need \endash  like, \'93I don\rquote 
t want any Carrow supporters to be able to get in\'94 \endash  and it\rquote ll do it for you! You\rquote ve just got to make sure you close the loopholes! Neville\rquote s the man!\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s quite straightforward, really,\rquote  said Neville modestly. \lquote I\rquote d been in here about a day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and that\rquote s when the passage to the Hog
\rquote s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth. He\rquote s been providing us with food, because for some reason, that\rquote s the one thing the Room doesn\rquote t really do.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, well, food\rquote s one of the five exceptions to Gamp\rquote s Law of Elemental Transfiguration,\rquote  said Ron, to general astonishment.
\par \lquote So we\rquote ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,\rquote  said Seamus, \lquote and it just makes more hammocks every time we need them, and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and thought they\rquote d quite like to wash, yes,\rquote 
 supplied Lavender Brown, whom Harry had not noticed until that point. Now that he looked around properly, he recognised many familiar faces. Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein and Michael Corner.
\par \lquote Tell us what you\rquote ve been up to, though,\rquote  said Ernie, \lquote there\rquote ve been so many rumours, we\rquote ve been trying to keep up with you on }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote They did!\rquote  said Neville. \lquote And the dragon\rquote s true too!\rquote 
\par There was a smattering of applause and a few whoops; Ron took a bow.
\par \lquote What were you after?\rquote  asked Seamus eagerly.
\par Before any of them could parry the question with one of their own, Harry felt a terrible, scorching pain in the lightning sc
ar. As he turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces, the Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a ruined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred golden box lay open and empty
 beside the hole, and Voldemort\rquote s scream of fury vibrated inside his head.
\par With an enormous effort, he pulled out of Voldemort\rquote s mind again, back to where he stood, swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face and Ron holding him up.
\par \lquote Are you all right, Harry?\rquote  Neville was saying. \lquote Want to sit down? I expect you\rquote re tired, aren\rquote t \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell them without words that Voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes
. Time was running out fast: if Voldemort chose to visit Hogwarts next they would miss their chance.
\par \lquote We need to get going,\rquote  he said, and their expressions told him that they understood.
\par \lquote What are we going to do, then, Harry?\rquote  asked Seamus. \lquote What\rquote s the plan?\rquote 
\par \lquote Plan?\rquote  repeated Harry. He was exercising all his will power to prevent himself succumbing again to Voldemort\rquote s rage: his scar was still burning. \lquote Well, there\rquote s something we \endash  Ron, Hermione and I \endash 
 need to do, and then we\rquote ll get out of here.\rquote 
\par Nobody was laughing or whooping any more. Neville looked confused.
\par \lquote What d\rquote you mean, \'93get out of here\'94?\rquote 
\par \lquote We haven\rquote t come back to stay,\rquote  said Harry, rubbing his scar, trying to soothe the pain. \lquote There\rquote s something important we need to do \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What is it?\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  I can\rquote t tell you.\rquote 
\par There was a ripple of muttering at this: Neville\rquote s brows contracted.
\par \lquote Why can\rquote t you tell us? It\rquote s something to do with fighting You-Know-Who, right?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, yeah \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Then we\rquote ll help you.\rquote 
\par The other members of Dumbledore\rquote s Army were nodding, some enthusiastically, others solemnly. A couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate action.
\par \lquote You don\rquote t understand.\rquote  Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours. \lquote We \endash  we can\rquote t tell you. We\rquote ve got to do it \endash  alone.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why?\rquote  asked Neville.
\par \lquote Because ...\rquote  In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux, or at least to have a private discussion with Ron and Hermione about where they might commence their search, Harry found it difficult to gather 
his thoughts. His scar was still searing. \lquote Dumbledore left the three of us a job,\rquote  he said carefully, \lquote and we weren\rquote t supposed to tell \endash  I mean, he wanted us to do it, just the three of us.\rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re his Army,\rquote  said Neville. \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s Army. We were all in it together, we\rquote ve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It hasn\rquote t exactly been a picnic, mate,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote I never said it had, but I don\rquote t see why you can\rquote t trust us. Everyone in this Room\rquote s been fighting and they\rquote ve been driven in here because the Carrows were hunting them down. Everyone in here\rquote s proven they
\rquote re loyal to Dumbledore \endash  loyal to you.\rquote 
\par \lquote Look,\rquote  Harry began, without knowing what he was going to say, but it did not matter: the tunnel door had just opened behind him.
\par \lquote We got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I thought you must be here!\rquote 
\par It was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best friend.
\par \lquote Hi, everyone!\rquote  said Luna happily. \lquote Oh, it\rquote s great to be back!\rquote 
\par \lquote Luna,\rquote  said Harry distractedly, \lquote what are you doing here? How did you \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote I sent for her,\rquote  said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. \lquote I promised her and Ginny that if you turned up I\rquote d let them know. We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution. That we we
re going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course that\rquote s what it means,\rquote  said Luna brightly. \lquote Isn\rquote t it, Harry? We\rquote re going to fight them out of Hogwarts?\rquote 
\par \lquote Listen,\rquote  said Harry, with a rising sense of panic, \lquote I\rquote m sorry, but that\rquote s not what we came back for. There\rquote s something we\rquote ve got to do, and then \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re going to leave us in this mess?\rquote  demanded Michael Corner.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Ron. \lquote What we\rquote re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it\rquote s all about trying to get rid of You-Know-Who \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Then let us help!\rquote  said Neville angrily. \lquote We want to be a part of it!\rquote 
\par There was another noise behind them, and Harry turned. His heart seemed to fail: Ginny was now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Fred, George and Lee Jor
dan. Ginny gave Harry a radiant smile: he had forgotten, or had never fully appreciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never been less pleased to see her.
\par \lquote Aberforth\rquote s getting a bit ratty,\rquote  said Fred, raising his hand in answer to several cries of greeting. \lquote He wants a kip, and his bar\rquote s turned into a railway station.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry\rquote s old girlfriend, Cho Chang. She smiled at him.
\par \lquote I got the message,\rquote  she said, holding up her own fake Galleon, and she walked over to sit beside Michael Corner.
\par \lquote So what\rquote s the plan, Harry?\rquote  said George.
\par \lquote There isn\rquote t one,\rquote  said Harry, still disorientated by the sudden appearance of all these people, unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely.
\par \lquote Just going to make it up as we go along, are we? My favourite kind,\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve got to stop this!\rquote  Harry told Neville. \lquote What did you call them all back for? This is insane \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote We\rquote re fighting, aren\rquote t we?\rquote  said Dean, taking out his fake Galleon. \lquote The message said Harry was back, and we were going to fight! I\rquote ll have to get a wand, though \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You haven\rquote t got a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 wand \endash ?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \rquote  began Seamus.
\par Ron turned suddenly to Harry.
\par \lquote Why can\rquote t they help?\rquote 
\par \lquote What?\rquote 
\par \lquote They can help.\rquote  He dropped his voice and said, so that none of them could hear but Hermione, who stood between them. \lquote We don\rquote t know where it is. We\rquote ve got to find it fast. We don\rquote t have to tell them it\rquote 
s a Horcrux.\rquote 
\par Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, \lquote I think Ron\rquote s right. We don\rquote t even know what we\rquote re looking for, we need them.\rquote  And when Harry looked unconvinced, \lquote You don\rquote 
t have to do everything alone, Harry.\rquote 
\par Harry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening to split again. Dumbledore had warned him against telling anyone but Ron and Hermione about the Horcruxes. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Secrets and lies, that\rquote s how we grew up, and Albus ... he was a natural ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
Was he turning into Dumbledore, keeping his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? But Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had that led? To murder at the top of the highest tower ...
\par \lquote All right,\rquote  he said quietly to the other two. \lquote OK,\rquote  he called to the Room at large, and all noise ceased: Fred and George, who had been cracking jokes for the benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and all of them 
looked alert, excited.
\par \lquote There\rquote s something we need to find,\rquote  Harry said. \lquote Something \endash  something that\rquote ll help us overthrow You-Know-Who. It\rquote s here at Hogwarts, but we don\rquote 
t know where. It might have belonged to Ravenclaw. Has anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone ever come across something with her eagle on it, for instance?\rquote 
\par He looked hopefully towards the little group of Ravenclaws, to Padma, Michael, Terry and Cho, but it was Luna who answered, perched on the arm of Ginny\rquote s chair.
\par \lquote Well, there\rquote s her lost diadem. I told you about it, remember, Harry? The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Daddy\rquote s trying to duplicate it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, but the lost diadem,\rquote  said Michael Corner, rolling his eyes, \lquote is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 lost,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640  Luna. That\rquote s sort of the point.\rquote 
\par \lquote When was it lost?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote Centuries ago, they say,\rquote  said Cho, and Harry\rquote s heart sank. \lquote Professor Flitwick says the diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself. People have looked, but,\rquote  she appealed to her fellow Ravenclaws, \lquote nobody\rquote 
s ever found a trace of it, have they?\rquote 
\par They all shook their heads.
\par \lquote Sorry, but what }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 a diadem?\rquote  asked Ron.
\par \lquote It\rquote s a kind of crown,\rquote  said Terry Boot. \lquote Ravenclaw\rquote s was supposed to have magical properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yes, Daddy\rquote s Wrackspurt siphons \endash \rquote 
\par But Harry cut across Luna.
\par \lquote And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?\rquote 
\par They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him. An object that had been lost this long, and apparently without trac
e, did not seem like a good candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the castle ... before he could formulate a new question, however, Cho spoke again.
\par \lquote If you\rquote d like to see what the diadem\rquote s supposed to look like, I could take you up to our common room and show you, Harry? Ravenclaw\rquote s wearing it in her statue.\rquote 
\par Harry\rquote s scar scorched again: for a moment the Room of Requirement swam before him, and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his shoulders. Voldemort w
as flying again, whether to the underground lake or here, to the castle, he did not know: either way, there was hardly any time left.
\par \lquote He\rquote s on the move,\rquote  he said quietly to Ron and Hermione. He glanced at Cho and then back at them. \lquote Listen, I know it\rquote s not much of a lead, but I\rquote 
m going to go and look at this statue, at least find out what the diadem looks like. Wait for me here and keep, you know \endash  the other one \endash  safe.\rquote 
\par Cho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather fiercely, \lquote No, Luna will take Harry, won\rquote t you, Luna?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oooh, yes, I\rquote d like to,\rquote  said Luna happily, and Cho sat down again, looking disappointed.
\par \lquote How do we get out?\rquote  Harry asked Neville.
\par \lquote Over here.\rquote 
\par He led Harry and Luna to a corner, where a small cupboard opened on to a steep staircase.
\par \lquote It comes out somewhere different every day, so they\rquote ve never been able to find it,\rquote  he said. \lquote Only trouble is, we never know exactly where we\rquote re going to end up when we go out. Be careful, Harry, they\rquote 
re always patrolling the corridors at night.\rquote 
\par \lquote No problem,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote See you in a bit.\rquote 
\par He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches and turned corners in unexpected places. At last they reached what appeared to be solid wall.
\par \lquote Get under here,\rquote  Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it over both of them. He gave the wall a little push.
\par It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark corridor: Harry pulled Luna back
 into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch around his neck and took out the Marauder\rquote s Map. Holding it close to his nose, he searched and located his and Luna\rquote s dots at last.
\par \lquote We\rquote re up on the fifth floor,\rquote  he whispered, watching Filch moving away from them, a corridor ahead. \lquote Come on, this way.\rquote 
\par They crept off.
\par Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had his heart hammered this fast, never had so much depended on his safe passage through the place. Through squares of moonlight upon t
he floor, past suits of armour whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around corners beyond which who knew what lurked, Harry and Luna walked, checking the Marauder\rquote 
s Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass
 without drawing attention to themselves. He expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the poltergeist\rquote s approach.
\par \lquote This way, Harry,\rquote  breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him towards a spiral staircase.
\par They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here before. At last they reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole: nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle.
\par Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in mid-air, unconnected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the beak of the eagle opened, but instead of a bird\rquote 
s call, a soft, musical voice said, \lquote Which came first, the phoenix or the flame?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hmm ... what do you think, Harry?\rquote  said Luna, looking thoughtful.
\par \lquote What? Isn\rquote t there just a password?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, no, you\rquote ve got to answer a question,\rquote  said Luna.
\par \lquote What if you get it wrong?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,\rquote  said Luna. \lquote That way you learn, you see?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... trouble is, we can\rquote t really afford to wait for anyone else, Luna.\rquote 
\par \lquote No, I see what you mean,\rquote  said Luna seriously. \lquote Well then, I think the answer is that a circle has no beginning.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well reasoned,\rquote  said the voice, and the door swung open.
\par The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier than any Harry had ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful arc
hed windows punctuated the walls, which were hung with blue and bronze silks: by day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains. The ceiling was domed and painted with stars, which were echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. T
here were tables, chairs and bookcases, and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble.
\par Harry recognised Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at Luna\rquote s house. The statue stood beside a door which led, he guessed, to dormitories a
bove. He strode right up to the marble woman and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half-smile on her face, beautiful yet slightly intimidating. A delicate-looking circlet had been reproduced in marble on top of her head. It was not unlike th
e tiara Fleur had worn at her wedding. There were tiny words etched into it. Harry stepped out from under the Cloak and climbed up on to Ravenclaw\rquote s plinth to read them.

\par \lquote Which makes you pretty skint, witless,\rquote  said a cackling voice.
\par Harry whirled round, slipped off the plinth and landed on the floor. The sloping-shouldered figure of Alecto Carrow was standing before him, and even as Harry raised his wand, she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm.

tated, he raised his wand, but the witch before him was already falling forwards; she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve never Stunned anyone except in our DA lessons,\rquote  said Luna, sounding mildly interested. \lquote That was noisier than I thought it would be.\rquote 
\par And sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble. Scurrying, echoing footsteps were growing louder from behind the door leading to the dormitories: Luna\rquote s spell had woken Ravenclaws sleeping above.
\par \lquote Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!\rquote 
\par Luna\rquote 
s feet appeared out of nowhere; he hurried to her side and she let the Cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a stream of Ravenclaws, all in their nightclothes, flooded into the common room. There were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw Ale
cto lying there unconscious. Slowly, they shuffled in around her, a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack them. Then one brave little first-year darted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe.
\par \lquote I think she might be dead!\rquote  he shouted with delight.
\par \lquote Oh, look,\rquote  whispered Luna happily, as the Ravenclaws crowded in around Alecto. \lquote They\rquote re pleased!\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah ... great ...\rquote 
\par Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into Voldemort\rquote s mind ... he was moving along the tunnel into the first cave ... he had chosen to make sure of the locket before coming ... but that would not take him long ...

\par There was a rap on the common-room door and every Ravenclaw froze. From the other side, Harry heard the soft, musical voice that issued from the eagle doorknocker: \lquote Where do vanished objects go?\rquote 
\par \lquote I dunno, do I? Shut it!\rquote  snarled an uncouth voice that Harry knew was that of the Carrow brother, Amycus. \lquote Alecto? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Alecto? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Are you there? Have you got him? Open the door!\rquote 
\par The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terrified. Then, without warning, there came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody was firing a gun into the door.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote ALECTO! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 If he comes, and we haven\rquote t got Potter \endash  d\rquote 
you want to go the same way as the Malfoys? ANSWER ME!\rquote 
 Amycus bellowed, shaking the door for all he was worth, but still, it did not open. The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the most frightened began scampering back up the staircase to their beds. Then, just as Harry was wondering whet
her he ought not to blast open the door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could do anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang out beyond the door.
\par \lquote May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?\rquote 
\par \lquote Trying \endash  to get \endash  through this damned \endash  door!\rquote  shouted Amycus. \lquote Go and get Flitwick! Get him to open it, now!\rquote 
\par \lquote But isn\rquote t your sister in there?\rquote  asked Professor McGonagall. \lquote Didn\rquote t Professor Flitwick let her in, earlier this evening, at your urgent request? Perhaps she could open the door for you? Then you needn\rquote

\par \lquote She ain\rquote t answering, you old besom! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 open it! Garn! Do it, now!
\rquote 
\par \lquote Certainly, if you wish it,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, with awful coldness. There was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked, again, \lquote Where do vanished objects go?\rquote 
\par \lquote Into non-being, which is to say, everything,\rquote  replied Professor McGonagall.
\par \lquote Nicely phrased,\rquote  replied the eagle doorknocker, and the door swung open.
\par The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs a
s Amycus burst over the threshold, brandishing his wand. Hunched like his sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny eyes, which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on the floor. He let out a yell of fury and fear.
\par \lquote What\rquote ve they done, the little whelps?\rquote  he screamed. \lquote I\rquote ll Cruciate the lot of \rquote em \rquote til they tell me who did it \endash  and what\rquote s the Dark Lord going to say?\rquote 
 he shrieked, standing over his sister and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist. \lquote We haven\rquote t got him, and they\rquote ve gorn and killed her!\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s only Stunned,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall impatiently, who had stooped down to examine Alecto. \lquote She\rquote ll be perfectly all right.\rquote 
\par \lquote No she bludgering well won\rquote t!\rquote  bellowed Amycus. \lquote Not after the Dark Lord gets hold of her! She\rquote s gorn and sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and he thinks we\rquote ve got Potter!\rquote 
\par \lquote \'93Got Potter\'94?\rquote  said Professor McGonagall sharply. \lquote What do you mean, \'93got Potter\'94?\rquote 
\par \lquote He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower, and to send for him if we caught him!\rquote 
\par \lquote Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower? Potter belongs in my house!\rquote 
\par Beneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice, and affection for Minerva McGonagall gushed up inside him.
\par \lquote We was told he might come in here!\rquote  said Carrow. \lquote I dunno why, do I?\rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room. Twice they passed right over the place where Harry and Luna stood.
\par \lquote We can push it off on the kids,\rquote  said Amycus, his pig-like face suddenly crafty. \lquote Yeah, that\rquote s what we\rquote ll do. We\rquote ll say Alecto was ambushed by the kids, them kids up there,\rquote 
 he looked up at the starry ceiling towards the dormitories, \lquote and we\rquote ll say they forced her to press her Mark, and that\rquote s why he got a false alarm ... he can punish them. Couple of kids more or less, what\rquote s the difference?
\rquote 
\par \lquote Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and cowardice,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, who had turned pale, \lquote 
a difference, in short, which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate. But let me make one thing very clear. You are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts. I shall not permit it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Excuse me?\rquote 
\par Amycus moved forwards until he was offensively close to Professor McGonagall, his face within inches of hers. She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck to a lavatory seat.
\par \lquote It\rquote s not a case of what }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 you\rquote ll }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 permit, Miner
va McGonagall. Your time\rquote s over. It\rquote s us what\rquote s in charge here now, and you\rquote ll back me up or you\rquote ll pay the price.\rquote 
\par And he spat in her face.
\par Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand and said, \lquote You shouldn\rquote t have done that.\rquote 
\par As Amycus spun round, Harry shouted, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Crucio!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor.

\par \lquote I see what Bellatrix meant,\rquote  said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, \lquote you need to really mean it.\rquote 
\par \lquote Potter!\rquote  whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. \lquote Potter \endash  you\rquote re here! What \endash ? How \endash ?\rquote  She struggled to pull herself together. \lquote Potter, that was foolish!\rquote 
\par \lquote He spat at you,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Potter, I \endash  that was very \endash  very }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 gallant }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 of you \endash 
 but don\rquote t you realise \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I do,\rquote  Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied him. \lquote Professor McGonagall, Voldemort\rquote s on the way.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?\rquote 
 asked Luna with an air of interest, pulling off the Invisibility Cloak. This appearance of a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm Professor McGonagall, who staggered backwards and fell into a nearby chair, 
clutching at the neck of her old tartan dressing gown.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t think it makes any difference what we call him,\rquote  Harry told Luna, \lquote he already knows where I am.\rquote 
\par In a distant part of Harry\rquote s brain, that part connected to the angry, burning scar, he could see Voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat ... he had nearly reached the island where the stone basin stood ...
\par \lquote You must flee,\rquote  whispered Professor McGonagall. \lquote Now, Potter, as quickly as you can!\rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote There\rquote s something I need to do. Professor, do you know where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?\rquote 
\par \lquote The d \endash  diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not \endash  hasn\rquote t it been lost for centuries?\rquote  She sat up a little straighter. \lquote Potter, it was madness, utter madness, for you to enter this castle \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I had to,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Professor, there\rquote s something hidden here that I\rquote m supposed to find, and it }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 could }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 be the diadem \endash  if I could just speak to Professor Flitwick \endash \rquote 
\par There was a sound of movement, of clinking glass: Amycus was coming round. Before Harry or Luna could act, Professor McGonagall rose to her feet, pointed her wand at the groggy Death Eater and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Imperio.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand, then shuffled obediently to Professor McGonagall and hand
ed it over along with his own. Then he lay down on the floor beside Alecto. Professor McGonagall waved her wand again, and a length of shimmering silver rope appeared out of thin air and snaked around the Carrows, binding them tightly together.
\par \lquote Potter,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, turning to face him again with superb indifference to the Carrows\rquote  predicament, \lquote if He Who Must Not Be Named does indeed know that you are here \endash \rquote 
\par As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through Harry, setting his scar on fire, and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear, and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the surface \endash 
\par \lquote Potter, are you all right?\rquote  said a voice, and Harry came back: he was clutching Luna\rquote s shoulder to steady himself.
\par \lquote Time\rquote s running out, Voldemort\rquote s getting nearer. Professor, I\rquote m acting on Dumbledore\rquote s orders, I must find what he wanted me to find! But we\rquote ve got to get the students out while I\rquote m searching the castle 
\endash  it\rquote s me Voldemort wants, but he won\rquote t care about killing a few more or less, not now \endash \rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Not now he knows I\rquote 
m attacking Horcruxes, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Harry finished the sentence in his head.
\par \lquote You\rquote re acting on }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Dumbledore\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 orders?\rquote 
 she repeated, with a look of dawning wonder. Then she drew herself up to her fullest height.
\par \lquote We shall secure the school against He Who Must Not Be Named while you search for this \endash  this object.\rquote 
\par \lquote Is that possible?\rquote 
\par \lquote I think so,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall drily, \lquote 
we teachers are rather good at magic, you know. I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it. Of course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Let me \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and if Hogwarts is about to enter
 a state of siege, with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible. With the Floo Network under observation and Apparition impossible within the grounds \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote There\rquote s a way,\rquote  said Harry quickly, and he explained about the passageway leading into the Hog\rquote s Head.
\par \lquote Potter, we\rquote re talking about hundreds of students \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they won\rquote t be interested in anyone who\rquote s Disapparating out of the Hog\rquote s Head.\rquote 
\par \lquote There\rquote s something in that,\rquote  she agreed. She pointed her wand at the Carrows, and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies, tied itself around them and hoisted them into the air, where they dangled ben
eath the blue and gold ceiling, like two large, ugly sea creatures. \lquote Come. We must alert the other Heads of House. You\rquote d better put that Cloak back on.\rquote 
\par She marched towards the door, and as she did so she raised her wand. From the tip burst three silver ca
ts with spectacle markings around their eyes. The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the spiral staircase with silvery lights, as Professor McGonagall, Harry and Luna hurried back down.
\par Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left them; Professor McGonagall\rquote s tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor and Harry and Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak.
\par They had descended two more floors when another set of quiet footsteps joined theirs. Harry, whose scar was still prickling, heard them first: he felt in the pouch around his neck for the Marauder\rquote 
s Map, but before he could take it out, McGonagall, too, seemed to become aware of their company. She halted, raised her wand ready to duel, and said, \lquote Who\rquote s there?\rquote 
\par \lquote It is I,\rquote  said a low voice.
\par From behind a suit of armour stepped Severus Snape.
\par Hatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him: he had forgotten the details of Snape\rquote s appearance in the magnitude of his crimes, forgotten how his greasy, black hair hung in curtains around his th
in face, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was not wearing nightclothes, but was dressed in his usual black cloak and he, too, was holding his wand ready for a fight.
\par \lquote Where are the Carrows?\rquote  he asked quietly.
\par \lquote Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall.
\par Snape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor McGonagall into the air around her, as if he knew that Harry was there. Harry held his wand up too, ready to attack.
\par \lquote I was under the impression,\rquote  said Snape, \lquote that Alecto had apprehended an intruder.\rquote 
\par \lquote Really?\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote And what gave you that impression?\rquote 
\par Snape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where the Dark Mark was branded into his skin.
\par \lquote Oh, but naturally,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote You Death Eaters have your own private means of communication, I forgot.\rquote 
\par Snape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still probing the air all about her and he was moving gradually closer, with an air of hardly noticing what he was doing.
\par \lquote I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors, Minerva.\rquote 
\par \lquote You have some objection?\rquote 
\par \lquote I wonder what could have brought you out of your bed at this late hour?\rquote 
\par \lquote I thought I heard a disturbance,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall.
\par \lquote Really? But all seems calm.\rquote 
\par Snape looked into her eyes.
\par \lquote Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have, I must insist \endash \rquote 
\par Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could hav
e believed: her wand slashed through the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape must crumple, unconscious, but the swiftness of his Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was thrown off balance. She brandished her wand at a torch on the wall a
nd it flew out of its bracket: Harry, about to curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape \endash 
\par Then it was no longer fire, but a great, black
 serpent that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which reformed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers: Snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armour in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another, 
into its breast \endash 
\par \lquote Minerva!\rquote  said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding Luna from flying spells, Harry saw Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the corridor towards them in their nightclothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn p
anting along at the rear.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. \lquote You\rquote ll do no more murder at Hogwarts!\rquote 
\par Flitwick\rquote s spell hit the suit of armour behind which Snape had taken shelter: with a clatter it came to life. Snape struggled free of the crushing 
arms and sent it flying back towards his attackers: Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered. When Harry looked up again, Snape was in full flight, McGonagall, Flitwick and Sprout all thundering after him: 
Snape hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, Harry heard McGonagall cry, \lquote Coward! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 COWARD!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par \lquote What\rquote s happened, what\rquote s happened?\rquote  asked Luna.
\par Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted classroom where Professors McGonagall, Flitwick and Sprout were standing at a smashed window.
\par \lquote He jumped,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, as Harry and Luna ran into the room.
\par \lquote You mean he\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 dead?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring 
Flitwick and Sprout\rquote s yells of shock at his sudden appearance.
\par \lquote No, he\rquote s not dead,\rquote  said McGonagall bitterly. \lquote Unlike Dumbledore, he was still carrying a wand ... and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.\rquote 
\par With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, bat-like shape flying through the darkness towards the perimeter wall.
\par There were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of puffing: Slughorn had just caught up.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  he panted, massaging his immense chest beneath his emerald-green silk pyjamas. \lquote My dear boy ... what a surprise ... Minerva, do please explain ... Severus ... what ...?\rquote 
\par \lquote Our Headmaster is taking a short break,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, pointing at the Snape-shaped hole in the window.
\par \lquote Professor!\rquote  Harry shouted, his hands at his forehead. He could see the Inferi-filled lake sliding beneath him, and he felt the ghostly green boat bump into the underground shore, and Voldemort leapt from it with murder in his heart \endash 

\par \lquote Professor, we\rquote ve got to barricade the school, he\rquote s coming now!\rquote 
\par \lquote Very well. He Who Must Not Be Named is coming,\rquote  she told the other teachers. Sprout and Flitwick gasped; Slughorn let out a low groan. \lquote Potter has work to do in the castle on Dumbledore\rquote

\par \lquote You realise, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely?\rquote  squeaked Flitwick.
\par \lquote But we can hold him up,\rquote  said Professor Sprout.
\par \lquote Thank you, Pomona,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, and between the two witches there passed a look of grim understanding. \lquote 
I suggest we establish basic protection around the place, then gather our students and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be evacuated, though if any of those who are over-age wish to stay and fight, I think they ought to be given the chance.\rquote 

\par \lquote Agreed,\rquote  said Professor Sprout, already hurrying towards the door. \lquote I shall meet you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with my house.\rquote 
\par And as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her muttering, \lquote Tentacula. Devil\rquote s Snare. And Snargaluff pods ... yes, I\rquote d like to see the Death Eaters fighting those.\rquote 
\par \lquote I can act from here,\rquote  said Flitwick, and although he could barely see out of it, he pointed his wand through the smas
hed window and started muttering incantations of great complexity. Harry heard a weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the grounds.
\par \lquote Professor,\rquote  Harry said, approaching the little Charms master, \lquote Professor, I\rquote m sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?\rquote

\par \lquote We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her.
\par They had just reached the door when Slughorn rumbled into speech.
\par \lquote My word,\rquote  he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus moustache aquiver. \lquote What a to-do! I\rquote

\par \lquote I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes, also,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote 
If you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance, or take up arms against us within this castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill.\rquote 
\par \lquote Minerva!\rquote  he said, aghast.
\par \lquote The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties,\rquote  interrupted Professor McGonagall. \lquote Go and wake your students, Horace.\rquote 
\par Harry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter: he and Luna ran after Professor McGonagall, who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her wand.

\par \lquote Wh\emdash ?\rquote 
\par As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It was packed, far more crowded than when he had last been in there. Kingsley and Lupin were looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelin

\par \lquote Harry, what\rquote s happening?\rquote  said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the stairs.

\par \lquote They\rquote re evacuating the younger kids and everyone\rquote s meeting in the Great Hall to get organised,\rquote  Harry said. \lquote We\rquote re fighting.\rquote 
\par There was a great roar and a surge towards the foot of the stairs; he was pressed back against the wall as they ran past him, the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore\rquote s Army and Harry\rquote

\par \lquote Come on, Luna,\rquote  Dean called as he passed, holding out his free hand; she took it and followed him back up the stairs.
\par The crowd was thinning: only a little knot of people remained below in the Room of Requirement and Harry joined them. Mrs Weasley was struggling with Ginny. Around them stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill and Fleur.
\par \lquote You\rquote re under-age!\rquote  Mrs Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry approached. \lquote I won\rquote t permit it! The boys, yes, but you, you\rquote ve got to go home!\rquote

\par \lquote A teenagers\rquote  gang that\rquote s about to take him on, which no one else has dared to do!\rquote  said Fred.
\par \lquote She\rquote s sixteen!\rquote  shouted Mrs Weasley. \lquote She\rquote s not old enough! What you two were thinking, bringing her with you \endash \rquote 
\par Fred and George looked slightly ashamed of themselves.
\par \lquote Mum\rquote s right, Ginny,\rquote  said Bill gently. \lquote You can\rquote t do this. Everyone under-age will have to leave, it\rquote s only right.\rquote 
\par \lquote I can\rquote t go home!\rquote  Ginny shouted, angry tears sparkling in her eyes. \lquote My whole family\rquote s here, I can\rquote t stand waiting there alone and not knowing and \endash \rquote 
\par Her eyes met Harry\rquote s for the first time. She looked at him beseechingly, but he shook his head and she turned away bitterly.
\par \lquote Fine,\rquote  she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the Hog\rquote s Head. \lquote I\rquote ll say goodbye now, then, and \endash \rquote 
\par There was a scuffling and a great thump: someone else had clambered out of the tunnel, overbalanced slightly and fallen. He pulled himself up on the nearest chair, looked around through lopsided horn-rimmed glasses and said, \lquote Am I too late
? Has it started? I only just found out, so I \endash  I \endash \rquote 
\par Percy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not expected to run into most of his family. There was a long moment of astonishment, broken by Fleur turning to Lupin and saying, in a wildly transparent attempt to break the tension, \lquote So \endash  
\rquote ow eez leetle Teddy?\rquote 
\par Lupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between the Weasleys seemed to be solidifying, like ice.
\par \lquote I \endash  oh yes \endash  he\rquote s fine!\rquote  Lupin said loudly. \lquote Yes, Tonks is with him \endash  at her mother\rquote s.\rquote 
\par Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one another, frozen.
\par \lquote Here, I\rquote ve got a picture!\rquote  Lupin shouted, pulling a photograph from inside his jacket and showing it to Fleur and Harry, who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of bright turquoise hair, waving fat fists at the camera.
\par \lquote I was a fool!\rquote  Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped his photograph. \lquote I was an idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was a \endash  a \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron,\rquote  said Fred.
\par Percy swallowed.
\par \lquote Yes, I was!\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, you can\rquote t say fairer than that,\rquote  said Fred, holding out his hand to Percy.
\par Mrs Weasley burst into tears. She ran forwards, pushed Fred aside and pulled Percy into a strangling hug, while he patted her on the back, his eyes on his father.
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry, Dad,\rquote  Percy said.
\par Mr Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he, too, hurried to hug his son.
\par \lquote What made you see sense, Perce?\rquote  enquired George.
\par \lquote It\rquote s been coming on for a while,\rquote  said Percy, mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner of his travelling cloak. \lquote But I had to find a way out and it\rquote s not so easy at the Ministry, they\rquote 
re imprisoning traitors all the time. I managed to make contact with Aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight of it, so here I am.\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these,\rquote  said George, in a good imitation of Percy\rquote s most pompous manner. \lquote Now let\rquote s get upstairs and fight, or all the good Death Eaters\rquote 
ll be taken.\rquote 
\par \lquote So, you\rquote re my sister-in-law now?\rquote  said Percy, shaking hands with Fleur as they hurried off towards the staircase with Bill, Fred and George.
\par \lquote Ginny!\rquote  barked Mrs Weasley.
\par Ginny had been attempting, under cover of the reconciliation, to sneak upstairs too.
\par \lquote Molly, how about this,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote Why doesn\rquote t Ginny stay here, then at least she\rquote ll be on the scene and know what\rquote s going on, but she won\rquote t be in the middle of the fighting?\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s a good idea,\rquote  said Mr Weasley firmly. \lquote Ginny, you stay in this Room, you hear me?\rquote 
\par Ginny did not seem to like the idea much, but under her father\rquote s unusually stern gaze she nodded. Mr and Mrs Weasley and Lupin headed off for the stairs as well.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Ron?\rquote  asked Harry. \lquote Where\rquote s Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote They must have gone up to the Great Hall already,\rquote  Mr Weasley called over his shoulder.
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t see them pass me,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote They said something about a bathroom,\rquote  said Ginny, \lquote not long after you left.\rquote 
\par \lquote A bathroom?\rquote 
\par Harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the Room of Requirement and checked the bathroom beyond. It was empty.
\par \lquote You\rquote re sure they said bath\emdash ?\rquote 
\par But then his scar seared and the Room of Requirement vanished: he was looking through the high, wrought-iron gates, with winged boars on pillars at either side, looking through the dark grounds
 towards the castle, which was ablaze with lights. Nagini lay draped over his shoulders. He was possessed of that cold, cruel sense of purpose that preceded murder.

The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with stars, and below it the four long house tables were lined with dishevelled students, some in travelling cloaks, others in dressing gowns. Here and there shone the pearly-white figures of 
t
he school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead, was fixed upon Professor McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall. Behind her stood the remaining teachers, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the O
rder of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight.

... evacuation will be overseen by Mr Filch and Madam Pomfrey. Prefects, when I give the word, you will organise your house and take your charges, in an orderly fashion, to the evacuation point.\rquote 
\par Many of the students looked petrified. However, as Harry skirted the walls, scanning the Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and shouted, \lquote And what if we want to stay and fight?\rquote 
\par There was a smattering of applause.
\par \lquote If you are of age, you may stay,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall.
\par \lquote What about our things?\rquote  called a girl at the Ravenclaw table. \lquote Our trunks, our owls?\rquote 
\par \lquote We have no time to collect possessions,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall. \lquote The important thing is to get you out of here safely.\rquote 
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Professor Snape?\rquote  shouted a girl from the Slytherin table.
\par \lquote He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,\rquote  replied Professor McGonagall, and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws.
\par Harry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still looking for Ron and Hermione. As he passed, faces turned in his direction, and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake.
\par \lquote We have already placed protection around the castle,\rquote  Professor McGonagall was saying, \lquote but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly, and do as your prefects 
\endash \rquote 
\par But her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the Hall. It was high, cold and
 clear: there was no telling from where it came; it seemed to issue from the walls themselves. Like the monster it had once commanded, it might have lain dormant there for centuries.
\par \lquote I know that you are preparing to fight.\rquote  There were screams amongst the students, some of whom clutched each other, look\-ing around in terror for the source of the sound. \lquote 
Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood.\rquote 
\par There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums, that seems too huge to be contained by walls.
\par \lquote Give me Harry Potter,\rquote  said Voldemort\rquote s voice, \lquote and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded.
\par \lquote You have until midnight.\rquote 
\par The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have found Harry, to hold him frozen in the glare of thousands of i
nvisible beams. Then a figure rose from the Slytherin table and he recognised Pansy Parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and screamed, \lquote But he\rquote s there! Potter\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 there!}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640  Someone grab him!\rquote 
\par Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryffind
ors in front of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and, almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with their backs to Harry, all of them looking towards Pansy instead, and Harry, awe\-
struck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves.
\par \lquote Thank you, Miss Parkinson,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. \lquote You will leave the Hall first with Mr Filch. If the rest of your house could follow.\rquote 
\par Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the Slytherins trooping out on the other side of the Hall.
\par \lquote Ravenclaws, follow on!\rquote  cried Professor McGonagall.
\par Slowly, the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out: even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, neces\-
sitating Professor McGonagall\rquote s descent from the teachers\rquote  platform to chivvy the under-age on their way.
\par \lquote Absolutely not, Creevey, go! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 And }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 you, Peakes!\rquote

\par \lquote Where are Ron and Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote Haven\rquote t you found \endash ?\rquote  began Mr Weasley, looking worried.
\par But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forwards on the raised platform to address those who had remained behind.
\par \lquote We\rquote ve only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast! A battle plan has been agreed between the 
teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of the Phoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest Towers \endash  Ravenclaw, Astronomy and Gryffindor \endash  where they\rquote 
ll have a good overview, excellent positions from which to work spells. Meanwhile, Remus,\rquote  he indicated Lupin, \lquote Arthur,\rquote  he pointed towards Mr Weasley, sitting at the Gryffindor table, \lquote 
and I will take groups into the grounds. We\rquote ll need some\-body to organise defence of the entrances of the passageways into the school \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  sounds like a job for us,\rquote  called Fred, indicating himself and George, and Kingsley nodded his approval.
\par \lquote All right, leaders up here and we\rquote ll divide up the troops!\rquote 
\par \lquote Potter,\rquote  said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as students flooded the platform, jostling for position, receiving instructions, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote aren

\par \lquote What? Oh,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote oh yeah!\rquote 
\par He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten that the battle was being fought so that he could search for it: the inexplicable absence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind.
\par \lquote Then go, Potter, go!\rquote 
\par \lquote Right \endash  yeah \endash \rquote 
\par He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again, into the Entran
ce Hall still crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with them, but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. Fear and panic were clouding his thought processes. He tried to calm himself, to con
c
entrate on finding the Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without Ron and Hermione to help him, he could not seem to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along an empty 
passage, where he sat down upon the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauder\rquote s Map out of the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron or Hermione\rquote 
s names anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of Requirement might, he thought, be concealing them. He put the map away, pressed his hands over his face and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate ...
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Voldemort thought I\rquote d go to Ravenclaw Tower.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par There it was: a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had stationed Alecto Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there could only be one explanation: Voldemort feared that Harry already knew his Horcrux was connected to that house.
\par But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost 
diadem ... and how could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it possible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem that had eluded generations of Ravenclaws? Who could have told him where to look, when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory?

\par Beneath his fingers, Harry\rquote s eyes flew open again. He leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last hope. The sound of hundreds of people marching towards the Room of Requirement grew louder
 and louder as he returned to the marble stairs. Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep track of the students in their own houses; there was much pushing and shoving; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling over first-years to get to the front of t
he queue; here and there younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings ...
\par Harry caught sight of a pearly-white figure drifting across the Entrance Hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamour.
\par \lquote Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!\rquote 
\par He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the bottom of the stairs where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower, stood waiting for him.
\par \lquote Harry! My dear boy!\rquote 
\par Nick made to grasp Harry\rquote s hands with both of his own: Harry\rquote s felt as though they had been thrust into icy water.
\par \lquote Nick, you\rquote ve got to help me. Who\rquote s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?\rquote 
\par Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised, and a little offended.
\par \lquote The Grey Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s got to be her \endash  d\rquote you know where she is?\rquote 
\par \lquote Let\rquote s see ...\rquote 
\par Nick\rquote s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither, peering over the heads of the swarming students.
\par \lquote That\rquote s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.\rquote 
\par Harry looked in the direction of Nick\rquote s transparent, pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall.
\par Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from him.
\par \lquote Hey \endash  wait \endash  come back!\rquote 
\par She consented to pause, floating a few inches from 
the ground. Harry supposed that she was beautiful, with her waist-length hair and floor-length cloak, but she also looked haughty and proud. Close to, he recognised her as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor, but to whom he had never spoke
n.
\par \lquote You\rquote re the Grey Lady?\rquote 
\par She nodded but did not speak.
\par \lquote The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?\rquote 
\par \lquote That is correct.\rquote 
\par Her tone was not encouraging.
\par \lquote Please: I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem.\rquote 
\par A cold smile curved her lips.
\par \lquote I am afraid,\rquote  she said, turning to leave, \lquote that I cannot help you.\rquote 
\par \lquote WAIT!\rquote 
\par He had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threaten\-ing to overwhelm him. He glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him: it was a quarter to midnight.
\par \lquote This is urgent,\rquote  he said fiercely. \lquote If that diadem\rquote s at Hogwarts, I\rquote ve got to find it, fast.\rquote 
\par \lquote You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem,\rquote  she said disdainfully. \lquote Generations of students have badgered me \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote This isn\rquote t about trying to get better marks!\rquote  Harry shouted at her. \lquote It\rquote s about Voldemort \endash  defeating Voldemort \endash  or aren\rquote t you interested in that?\rquote 
\par She could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more opaque, and her voice was heated as she replied, \lquote Of course I \endash  how dare you suggest \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, help me, then!\rquote 
\par Her composure was slipping.
\par \lquote It \endash  it is not a question of \endash \rquote  she stammered. \lquote My mother\rquote s diadem \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Your }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 mother\rquote s?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par She looked angry with herself.
\par \lquote When I lived,\rquote  she said stiffly, \lquote I was Helena Ravenclaw.\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re her }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 daughter? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 But then, you must know what happened to it!
\rquote 
\par \lquote While the diadem bestows wisdom,\rquote  she said, with an obvious effort to pull herself together, \lquote I doubt that it would greatly increase your chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself Lord \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Haven\rquote t I just told you, I\rquote m not interested in wearing it!\rquote  Harry said fiercely. \lquote There\rquote s no time to explain \endash  but if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see Voldemort finished, you\rquote 
ve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem!\rquote 
\par She remained quite still, f
loating in mid-air, staring down at him, and a sense of hopelessness engulfed Harry. Of course, if she had known anything, she would have told Flitwick or Dumbledore, who had surely asked her the same question. He had shaken his head, and made to turn awa
y, when she spoke in a low voice.
\par \lquote I stole the diadem from my mother.\rquote 
\par \lquote You \endash  you did what?\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote I stole the diadem,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a whisper. \lquote 
I sought to make myself cleverer, more important than my mother. I ran away with it.\rquote 
\par He did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence, and did not ask: he simply listened, hard, as she went on, \lquote 
My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone, but pretended that she had it still. She concealed her loss, my dreadful betrayal, even from the other founders of Hogwarts.
\par \lquote Then my mother fell ill \endash  fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy, she was desperate to see me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me, though I spurned his advances, to find me. She knew that he would not rest until he had done so.
\rquote 
\par Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head.
\par \lquote He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to return with him, he became violent. The Baron was always a hot-tempered man. Furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom, he stabbed me.\rquote 
\par \lquote The }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Baron? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 You mean \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote The Bloody Baron, yes,\rquote  said the Grey Lady, and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest. \lquote 
When he saw what he had done, he was overcome with remorse. He took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used it to kill himself. All these centuries later, he wears his chains as an act of penitence ... as he should,\rquote  she added bitterly.

\par \lquote And ... and the diadem?\rquote 
\par \lquote It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the forest towards me. Concealed inside a hollow tree.\rquote 
\par \lquote A hollow tree?\rquote  repeated Harry. \lquote What tree? Where was this?\rquote 
\par \lquote A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mother\rquote s reach.\rquote 
\par \lquote Albania,\rquote  repeated Harry. Sense was emerging miraculously from confusion, and now he understood why she was telling him what she had denied Dumbledore and Flitwick. \lquote You\rquote ve already told someone this story, haven\rquote 
t you? Another student?\rquote 
\par She closed her eyes and nodded.
\par \lquote I had ... no idea ... he was ... flattering. He seemed to ... to understand ... to sympathise ...\rquote 
\par Yes, Harry thought, Tom Riddle would certainly have under\-stood Helena Ravenclaw\rquote s desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right.
\par \lquote Well, you weren\rquote t the first person Riddle wormed things out of,\rquote  Harry muttered. \lquote He could be charming when he wanted ...\rquote 
\par So Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem out of the Grey Lady. H
e had travelled to that far-flung forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place, perhaps as soon as he left Hogwarts, before he even started work at Borgin and Burkes.
\par And wouldn\rquote t those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge when, so much later, Voldemort had needed a place to lie low, undisturbed, for ten long years?
\par But the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not been left in that lowly tree ... no, the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home, and Voldemort must have put it there \endash 
\par \lquote \endash  the night he asked for a job!\rquote  said Harry, finishing his thought.
\par \lquote I beg your pardon?\rquote 
\par \lquote He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let him teach!\rquote  said Harry. Saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all. \lquote He must\rquote ve hidden the diadem on his way up to, or down from, Dumbledore
\rquote s office! But it was still worth trying to get the job \endash  then he might\rquote ve got the chance to nick Gryffindor\rquote s sword as well \endash  thank you, thanks!\rquote 
\par Harry left her floating there, looking utterly bewildered. As he rounded the corner back into the Entrance Hall, he checked his watch. It was five minutes until midnight, and though he now knew }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 what }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 the last Horcrux was, he was no closer to discovering }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 where }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 it was ...
\par Generations of students had failed to find the diadem; that suggested that it was not in the Ravenclaw Tower \endash  but if not there, where? What hiding place had Tom Riddle discovered inside Hogwarts Castle, that h
e believed would remain secret forever?
\par Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash. As he leapt aside, a gigantic b
ody flew in through the window and hit the opposite wall. Something large and furry detached itself, whimpering, from the new arrival and flung itself at Harry.
\par \lquote Hagrid!\rquote  Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound\rquote s attentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet. \lquote What the \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, yer here! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Yer here!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par Hagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory and rib-cracking hug, then ran back to the shattered window.
\par \lquote Good boy, Grawpy!\rquote  he bellowed through the hole in the window. \lquote I\rquote ll see yer in a moment, there\rquote s a good lad!\rquote 
\par Beyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a weird, keening scream. He looked down at his watch: it was midnight. The battle had begun.
\par \lquote Blimey, Harry,\rquote  panted Hagrid, \lquote this is it, eh? Time ter fight?\rquote 
\par \lquote Hagrid, where have you come from?\rquote 
\par \lquote Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave,\rquote  said Hagrid grimly. \lquote Voice carried, didn\rquote  it? \'93Yeh got \rquote til midnight ter gimme Potter.\'94 Knew yeh mus\rquote  be here, knew what mus\rquote  be happenin\rquote . Get }{

 Fang. Smashed our way through the boundary by the forest, Grawpy was carryin\rquote  us, Fang an\rquote  me. Told him ter let me down at the castle so he shoved me through the window, bless him. Not exac\rquote ly what I meant, bu\rquote  \endash  where
\rquote s Ron an\rquote  Hermione?\rquote 
\par \lquote That,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote is a really good question. Come on.\rquote 
\par They hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping beside them. Harry could hear movement through the corridors all around: running footsteps, shouts; through the windows, he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds.
\par \lquote Where\rquote re we goin\rquote ?\rquote  puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry\rquote s heels, making the floorboards quake.
\par \lquote I dunno exactly,\rquote  said Harry, making another random turn, \lquote but Ron and Hermione must be around here somewhere.\rquote 
\par The first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead: the two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staff room had been smashed apart by a jinx that had sailed through another brok
en window. Their remains stirred feebly on the floor, and as Harry leapt over one of their dis\-embodied heads it moaned faintly, \lquote Oh, don\rquote t mind me ... I\rquote ll just lie here and crumble ...\rquote 
\par Its ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble bust of Rowena Ravenclaw at Xenophilius\rquote s house, wearing that mad headdress \endash  and then of the statue in Ravenclaw Tower, with the stone diadem upon her white curls ...
\par And as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third stone effigy came back to him: t
hat of an ugly old warlock, on to whose head Harry himself had placed a wig and a battered, old tiara. The shock shot through Harry with the heat of Firewhisky, and he nearly stumbled.
\par He knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him ...
\par Tom Riddle,
 who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in that particu
lar place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school \endash  here at last was a secret he and Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had never discovered \endash 
\par He was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed by Neville and half a dozen others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants.
\par \lquote Mandrakes!\rquote  Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as he ran. \lquote Going to lob them over the walls \endash  they won\rquote t like this!\rquote 
\par Harry knew, now, where to go: he sped off, with Hagrid and Fang galloping behind him. They passed portrait after portrait, and the painted figures raced alongside them, wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches, in armour and cloaks, cramming them\-
selves into each other\rquote s canvases, s
creaming news from other parts of the castle. As they reached the end of this corridor, the whole castle shook and Harry knew, as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force, that it was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of
 the teachers and the Order.
\par \lquote It\rquote s all righ\rquote , Fang \endash  it\rquote s all righ\rquote !\rquote 
 yelled Hagrid, but the great boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air, and Hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog, leaving Harry alone.
\par He for
ged on through the trembling passages, his wand at the ready, and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadogan, rushed from painting to painting beside him, clanking along in his armour, screaming encouragement, his fat little pon
y cantering behind him.
\par \lquote Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive them out, Harry Potter, see them off!\rquote 
\par Harry hurtled round a corner and found Fred and a small knot of students, including Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty 
plinth, whose statue had concealed a secret passageway. Their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole.
\par \lquote Nice night for it!\rquote 
 Fred shouted, as the castle quaked again, and Harry sprinted by, elated and terrified in equal measure. Along yet another corridor he dashed, and then there were owls everywhere, and Mrs Norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws, no doubt t
o return them to their proper place ...
\par \lquote Potter!\rquote 
\par Aberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead, his wand held ready.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter!\rquote 
\par \lquote I know, we\rquote re evacuating,\rquote  Harry said. \lquote Voldemort\rquote s \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  attacking because they haven\rquote t handed you over, yeah,\rquote  said Aberforth, \lquote I\rquote 
m not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage? There are kids of Death Eaters you\rquote ve just sent to safety. Wouldn\rquote t it have been a bit smarter to keep \rquote em here?
\rquote 
\par \lquote It wouldn\rquote t stop Voldemort,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote and your brother would never have done it.\rquote 
\par Aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Your brother would never have done it ... }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 well, it was the truth, Harr
y thought, as he ran on again; Dumbledore, who had defended Snape for so long, would never have held students ransom ...
\par And then he skidded round a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury he saw them: Ron and Hermione, both with their arms full of large, curved, dirty yellow objects, Ron with a broomstick under his arm.
\par \lquote Where the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 hell }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 have you been?\rquote  Harry shouted.

said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt before them.
\par \lquote It was Ron, all Ron\rquote s idea!\rquote  said Hermione breathlessly. \lquote Wasn\rquote t it absolutely brilliant? There we were, after you left, and I said to Ron, even if we find the other one, how are we going to get rid of it? We still hadn
\rquote t got rid of the cup! And then he thought of it! The Basilisk!\rquote 
\par \lquote What the \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote Something to get rid of Horcruxes,\rquote  said Ron simply.
\par Harry\rquote s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermione\rquote s arms: great, curved fangs torn, he now realised, from the skull of a dead Basilisk.
\par \lquote But how did you get in there?\rquote  he asked, staring from the fangs to Ron. \lquote You need to speak Parseltongue!\rquote 
\par \lquote He did!\rquote  whispered Hermione. \lquote Show him, Ron!\rquote 
\par Ron made a horrible, strangled hissing noise.
\par \lquote It\rquote s what you did to open the locket,\rquote  he told Harry apologetic\-ally. \lquote I had to have a few goes to get it right, but,\rquote  he shrugged modestly, \lquote we got there in the end.\rquote 
\par \lquote He was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 amazing!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 said Hermione. \lquote Amazing!\rquote 
\par \lquote So ...\rquote  Harry was struggling to keep up. \lquote So ...\rquote 
\par \lquote So we\rquote re another Horcrux down,\rquote  said Ron, and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of Hufflepuff\rquote s cup. \lquote Hermione stabbed it. Thought she should. She hasn\rquote t had the pleasure yet.\rquote 
\par \lquote Genius!\rquote  yelled Harry.
\par \lquote It was nothing,\rquote  said Ron, though he looked delighted with himself. \lquote So what\rquote s new with you?\rquote 
\par As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead: all three of them looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream.
\par \lquote I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,\rquote  said Harry, talking fast. \lquote He hid it exactly where I hid my old Potions book, where everyone\rquote 
s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on.\rquote 
\par As the walls trembled again, he led the other two back through the concealed entrance and down the staircase into the Room of Requirement. It was empty except for three women: Ginny, Tonks, and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry recogni
sed immediately as Neville\rquote s grandmother.
\par \lquote Ah, Potter,\rquote  she said crisply, as if she had been waiting for him. \lquote You can tell us what\rquote s going on.\rquote 
\par \lquote Is everyone OK?\rquote  said Ginny and Tonks together.
\par \lquote \rquote S far as we know,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Are there still people in the passage to the Hog\rquote s Head?\rquote 
\par He knew that the Room would not be able to transform while there were still users inside it.
\par \lquote I was the last to come through,\rquote  said Mrs Longbottom. \lquote I sealed it, I think it unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you seen my grandson?\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s fighting,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Naturally,\rquote  said the old lady proudly. \lquote Excuse me, I must go and assist him.\rquote 
\par With surprising speed, she trotted off towards the stone steps.
\par Harry looked at Tonks.
\par \lquote I thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your mother\rquote s?\rquote 
\par \lquote I couldn\rquote t stand not knowing \endash \rquote  Tonks looked anguished. \lquote She\rquote ll look after him \endash  have you seen Remus?\rquote

\par Without another word, Tonks sped off.
\par \lquote Ginny,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote I\rquote m sorry, but we need you to leave too. Just for a bit. Then you can come back in.\rquote 
\par Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary.
\par \lquote And then you can come back in!\rquote  he shouted after her, as she ran up the steps after Tonks. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote You\rquote ve got to come back in!\rquote }{

\par \lquote Hang on a moment!\rquote  said Ron sharply. \lquote We\rquote ve forgotten someone!\rquote 
\par \lquote Who?\rquote  asked Hermione.
\par \lquote The house-elves, they\rquote ll all be down in the kitchen, won\rquote t they?\rquote 
\par \lquote You mean we ought to get them fighting?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Ron seriously, \lquote I mean we should tell them to get out. We don\rquote t want any more Dobbys, do we? We can\rquote t order them to die for us \endash \rquote 
\par There was a clatter as the Basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione\rquote s arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the 
mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet.
\par \lquote Is this the moment?\rquote  Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. \lquote OI! There\rquote s a war going on here!\rquote 
\par Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other.
\par \lquote I know, mate,\rquote  said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, \lquote so it\rquote s now or never, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
\par \lquote Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?\rquote  Harry shouted. \lquote D\rquote you think you could just \endash  just hold it in until we\rquote ve got the diadem?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah \endash  right \endash  sorry \endash \rquote  said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face.
\par It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs, that in the minutes that they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated severely: the walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; d
u
st filled the air and through the nearest window Harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place. Looking down, Harry saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swi
nging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure.

\par \lquote As long as it\rquote s not any of our lot!\rquote  said a voice: Harry turned and saw Ginny and
 Tonks, both with their wands drawn at the next window, which was missing several panes. Even as he watched, Ginny sent a well-aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below.
\par \lquote Good girl!\rquote  roared a figure running through the dust towards them, and Harry saw Aberforth again, his grey hair flying as he led a small group of students past. \lquote They look like they might be breaching the North Battlements, they

 he said to Ron and Hermione, and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the Room of Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant.

\par \lquote Somewhere near here,\rquote  Harry muttered to himself. \lquote Some\-where ... somewhere ...\rquote 
\par Deeper and deeper into the laby
rinth he went, looking for objects he recognised from his one previous trip into the room. His breath was loud in his ears, and then his very soul seemed to shiver: there it was, right ahead, the blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old Potio
ns book, and on top of it, the pock-marked stone warlock wearing a dusty, old wig and what looked like an ancient, discoloured tiara.
\par He had already stretched out his hand, though he remained ten feet away, when a voice behind him said, \lquote Hold it, Potter.\rquote 
\par He skidded to a halt and turned round. Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him, shoulder to shoulder, wands pointing right at Harry. Through the small space between their jeering faces, he saw Draco Malfoy.
\par \lquote That\rquote s my wand you\rquote re holding, Potter,\rquote  said Malfoy, pointing his own through the gap between Crabbe and Goyle.
\par \lquote Not any more,\rquote  panted Harry, tightening his grip on the haw\-thorn wand. \lquote Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who\rquote s lent you theirs?\rquote 
\par \lquote My mother,\rquote  said Draco.
\par Harry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about the situation. He could not hear Ron or Hermione any more. They seemed to have run out of earshot, searching for the diadem.
\par \lquote So how come you three aren\rquote t with Voldemort?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote We\rquote re gonna be rewarded,\rquote  said Crabbe: his voice was sur\-prisingly soft for such an enormous person; Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before. Crabbe was smiling like a small child promised a large bag of sweets. \lquote We 
\rquote ung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you to \rquote im.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good plan,\rquote  said Harry in mock admiration. He could not believe that he was this close, and was going to be thwarted by Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle. He began edging slowly back\-
wards towards the place where the Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If he could just get his hands on it before the fight broke out ...
\par \lquote So how did you get in here?\rquote  he asked, trying to distract them.
\par \lquote I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,\rquote  said Malfoy, his voice brittle. \lquote I know how to get in.\rquote

\par \lquote Harry?\rquote  Ron\rquote s voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to Harry\rquote s right. \lquote Are you talking to someone?\rquote 
\par With a whip-like movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty-foot mountain of old furniture, of broken trunks, of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk and shouted, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Ron!\rquote  Harry bellowed, as somewhere out of sight Hermione screamed, and Harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the destabilised wall: he pointed his wand at the rampart, cried, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37

\par \lquote It\rquote s somewhere here!\rquote  Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen. \lquote Look for it while I go and help R\emdash \rquote

\par \lquote Like it hot, scum?\rquote  roared Crabbe as he ran.
\par But he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames of abnormal size were pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their touch.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Aguamenti!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the
 tip of his wand evaporated in the air.
\par \lquote RUN!\rquote 
\par Malfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along: Crabbe outstripped all of them, now looking terrified; Harry, Ron and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them. It was not normal fir
e; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had no knowledge: as they turned a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive, sentient, intent upon kill\-
ing them. Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts: flaming serpents,
 Chimaeras and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up in the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno.
\par Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron and Hermione stopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid as a wall around them.
\par \lquote What can we do?\rquote  Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire. \lquote What can we do?\rquote 
\par \lquote Here!\rquote 
\par Harry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione on to it behind him. Harry swung his leg over the second broom and, with hard kicks to 
the ground, they soared up into the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them. The smoke and heat were becoming overwhelm\-
ing: below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted stu
dents, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room. Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe or Goyle anywhere: he swooped as low as he dared over the marauding monsters o
f flame to try to find them, but there was nothing but fire: what a terrible way to die ... he had never wanted this ...
\par \lquote Harry, let\rquote s get out, let\rquote s get out!\rquote  bellowed Ron, though it was impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke.
\par And then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion, the thunder of devouring flame.
\par \lquote It\rquote s \endash  too \endash  dangerous \endash !\rquote  Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air. His glasses giving his eyes some small protection from the smoke, he raked 
the firestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood ...
\par And he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived. Malfoy s
aw him coming, and raised one arm, but even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good: Goyle was too heavy and Malfoy\rquote s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of Harry\rquote s \endash 
\par \lquote IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I\rquote LL KILL YOU, HARRY!\rquote  roared Ron\rquote s voice, an
d as a great, flaming Chimaera bore down upon them he and Hermione dragged Goyle on to their broom and rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up behind Harry.
\par \lquote The door, get to the door, the door!\rquote  screamed Malfoy in Harry\rquote s
 ear, and Harry sped up, following Ron, Hermione and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe: and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devour\-
ing flames were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace and an old, discoloured tiara \endash 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote What are you doing, what are you doing? The door\rquote s that way!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
screamed Malfoy, but Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it dropped towards the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught it around his wrist \endash 
\par Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him, he soared upwards and straight towards the place where, he prayed, the do
or stood open: Ron, Hermione and Goyle had vanished, Malfoy was screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the smoke, Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and moments later clean air filled his lungs an
d they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond.
\par Malfoy fell off the broom and lay face down, gasping, coughing and retching. Harry rolled over and sat up: the door to the Room of Requirement had vanished and Ron and Hermione sat panting on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious.
\par \lquote C \endash  Crabbe,\rquote  choked Malfoy, as soon as he could speak. \lquote C \endash  Crabbe ...\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s dead,\rquote  said Ron harshly.
\par There was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of huge bangs shook the castle, and a great ca
valcade of transparent figures galloped past on horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet when the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: the battle was still going on all around him. He could hear mor
e screams than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared within him.
\par \lquote Where\rquote s Ginny?\rquote  he said sharply. \lquote She was here. She was supposed to be going back into the Room of Requirement.\rquote 
\par \lquote Blimey, d\rquote you reckon it\rquote ll still work after that fire?\rquote  asked Ron, but he, too, got to his feet, rubbing his chest and looking left and right. \lquote Shall we split up and look \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle remained slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor; neither of them had wands. \lquote Let\rquote s stick together. I say we go \endash  Harry, what\rquote s that on your arm?
\rquote 
\par \lquote What? Oh, yeah \endash \rquote 
\par He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot, blackened with soot, but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Wit beyond measure is man\rquote s greatest treasure.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

blood-like substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from the diadem. Suddenly Harry felt the thing vibrate violently, then break apart in his hands, and as it did so, he thought he heard the fain
test, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the grounds or the castle, but from the thing that had just fragmented in his fingers.
\par \lquote It must have been Fiendfyre!\rquote  whimpered Hermione, her eyes on the broken pieces.
\par \lquote Sorry?\rquote 
\par \lquote Fiendfyre \endash  cursed fire \endash  it\rquote s one of the substances that destroy Horcruxes, but I would never, ever have dared use it, it\rquote s so dangerous. How did Crabbe know how to \endash ?\rquote

\par \lquote Shame he wasn\rquote t concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it, really,\rquote  said Ron, whose hair like Hermione\rquote s was singed, and whose face was blackened. \lquote If he hadn\rquote t tried to kill us all, I\rquote 
d be quite sorry he was dead.\rquote 
\par \lquote But don\rquote t you realise?\rquote  whispered Hermione. \lquote This means, if we can just get the snake \endash \rquote 
\par But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of duelling filled the corridor. Harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail: Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts. Fred and Percy had just backed into view, both of them duelling mas
ked and hooded men.
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione ran forwards to help: jets of light flew in every direction and the man duelling Percy backed off, fast: then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair \endash 
\par \lquote Hello, Minister!\rquote  bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. \lquote Did I mention I\rquote m resigning?\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re joking, Perce!\rquote  shouted Fred, as the Death Eater he was battling collapsed under th
e weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him; he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin. Fred looked at Percy with glee.
\par \lquote You actually }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 joking, Perce ... I don\rquote t think I\rquote 
ve heard you joke since you were \endash \rquote 
\par The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured: and in that fragment of a moment, when danger seemed, tem
porarily, at bay, the world was rent apart. Harry felt himself flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms: he heard the screams a
nd yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them \endash 
\par And then the world resolved itself into pain and semi-darkness: he was half-buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack: cold air told him
 that the side of the castle had been blown away and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding copiously. Then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides, that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause, and he s
tood up, swaying, more frightened than he had been that day, more frightened, perhaps, than he had been in his life ...
\par And Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage, and three red-headed men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart. Harry grabbed Hermione\rquote s hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood.
\par \lquote No \endash  no \endash  no!\rquote  someone was shouting. \lquote No! Fred! No!\rquote 
\par And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred\rquote s eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face.

\par \lquote Get down!\rquote  Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the night: he and Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor, but Percy lay across Fred\rquote s body, shielding it from further harm, and when Harry shouted, \lquote 
Percy, come on, we\rquote ve got to move!\rquote  he shook his head.
\par \lquote Percy!\rquote  Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating Ron\rquote s face as he seized his elder brother\rquote s shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not budge. \lquote Percy, you can\rquote t do anything for him! We\rquote re going to 
\endash \rquote 
\par Hermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask why. A monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall: one of Aragog\rquote s descendants had joined the fight.
\par Ron and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the monster was blown backwards, its legs jerking horribly, and vanished into the darkness.
\par \lquote It brought friends!\rquote  H
arry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted: more giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden Forest into which the Death Eaters must have penet
rated. Harry fired Stunning Spells down upon them, knocking the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over Harry\rquote 
s head, so close he felt the force of them blow his hair.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s move, NOW!\rquote 
\par Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred\rquote s body under the armpits. Percy, realising what Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped; together, crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them
 from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way.
\par \lquote Here,\rquote  said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armour had stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body was well 
hidden he took off after Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had vanished, but at the end of the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from the windows, he saw many people running backwards and forwards, whether friends 
or foes he could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like roar, \lquote ROOKWOOD!\rquote  and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students.
\par \lquote Harry, in here!\rquote  Hermione screamed.
\par She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry. They seemed to be wrestling together, and for one mad second Harry thought that they were embracing again; then he saw that Hermione was trying to restrain Ron, to stop him running after Percy.

\par \lquote Ron, we\rquote re the only ones who can end it! Please \endash  Ron \endash  we need the snake, we\rquote ve got to kill the snake!\rquote  said Hermione.
\par But Harry knew how Ron felt: pu

\par She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke, but she took great, heaving breaths to calm herself as, still keeping a tight hold on Ron, she turned to Harry.
\par \lquote You need to find out where Voldemort is, because he\rquote ll have the snake with him, won\rquote t he? Do it, Harry \endash  look inside him!\rquote 
\par Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, yearning to show him Voldemort\rquote s thoughts? He closed his eyes on her command, and at once, the screams and the bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battl
e were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood far, far away from them ...
\par He was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room, with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded except for one. The sounds of the 
assault on the castle were muffled and distant. The single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the castle stood, but inside the room it was dark except for a solitary oil lamp.
\par He was rolling his wand between his fingers, watching it, h
is thoughts on the Room in the castle, the secret Room only he had ever found, the Room, like the Chamber, that you had to be clever, and cunning, and inquisitive to discover ... he was confident that the boy would not find the diadem ... although Dumbled
ore\rquote s puppet had come much further than he had ever expected ... too far ...
\par \lquote My Lord,\rquote  said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned: there was Lucius Malfoy sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the boy\rquote 
s last escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. \lquote My Lord ... please ... my son ...\rquote 
\par \lquote If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join me, like the rest of the Slytherins. Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote No \endash  never,\rquote  whispered Malfoy.
\par \lquote You must hope not.\rquote 
\par \lquote Aren\rquote t \endash  aren\rquote t you afraid, my Lord, that Potter might die at another hand but yours?\rquote  asked Malfoy, his voice shaking. \lquote Wouldn\rquote

\par \lquote Do not pretend, Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has happened to your son. And I do not need to seek Potter. Before the night is out, Potter will have come to find me.\rquote 
\par Voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers. It troubled him ... and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort needed to be rearranged ...
\par \lquote Go and fetch Snape.\rquote 
\par \lquote Snape, m \endash  my Lord?\rquote 
\par \lquote Snape. Now. I need him. There is a \endash  service \endash  I require from him. Go.\rquote 
\par Frightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, Lucius left the room. Voldemort continued to stand there, twirling the wand between his fingers, staring at it.
\par \lquote It is the only way, Nagini,\rquote 
 he whispered, and he looked round, and there was the great, thick snake, now suspended in mid-air, twisting gracefully within the enchanted, protected space he had made for her, a starry, transparent sphere somewhere between glittering cage and tank.

\par With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes; at the same moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of battle.

\par Before Hermione could get further than, \lquote Ron, I\rquote m just as capable \endash \rquote  the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open.
\par \lquote POTTER!\rquote 
\par Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their wands were fully raised, Hermione shouted, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Glisseo!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par The stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she, Harry and Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast that the Death Eaters\rquote  Stunning Spells flew far over their heads. They shot throug
h the concealing tapestry at the bottom and spun on to the floor, hitting the opposite wall.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Duro!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and there were two loud, sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it.
\par \lquote Get back!\rquote  shouted Ron, and he, Harry and Hermione flattened themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past, shepherded by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She appeared not to notice them: her hair had c
ome down and there was a gash on her cheek. As she turned the corner, they heard her scream: \lquote CHARGE!\rquote 
\par \lquote Harry, you get the Cloak on,\rquote  said Hermione. \lquote Never mind us \endash \rquote 
\par But he threw it over all three of them; large though they were, he doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air, the falling stone, the shimmer of spells.
\par They ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duellers. The portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures, screaming advice and encourage\-
ment, while Death Eaters both masked and unmasked duelled students and teachers. Dean had won himself a wand, for he was face to face with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, Ron and Hermione raised their wands at 
once, ready to strike, but the duellers were weaving and darting around so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote wheeeeeeeeeeee!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
and, looking up, Harry saw Peeves zooming over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down on to the Death Eaters, whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling, green tubers like fat worms.
\par \lquote Argh!\rquote 
\par A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron\rquote s head; the slimy, green roots were suspended improbably in mid-air as Ron tried to shake them loose.
\par \lquote Someone\rquote s invisible there!\rquote  shouted a masked Death Eater, pointing.
\par Dean made the most of the Death Eater\rquote s momentary dis\-traction, knocking him out with a Stunning Spell; Dolohov attempted to retaliate and Parvati shot a Body-Bind Curse at him.
\par \lquote LET\rquote S GO!\rquote  Harry yelled, and he, Ron and Hermione gathered the Cloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down, through the midst of the fighters, slipping
 a little in pools of Snargaluff juice, towards the top of the marble staircase into the Entrance Hall.
\par \lquote I\rquote m Draco Malfoy, I\rquote m Draco, I\rquote m on your side!\rquote 
\par Draco was on the upper landing, pleading with another masked Death Eater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater
 as they passed: Malfoy looked around, beaming, for his saviour, and Ron punched him from under the Cloak. Malfoy fell backwards on top of the Death Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused.
\par \lquote And that\rquote s the second time we\rquote ve saved your life tonight, you two-faced bastard!\rquote  Ron yelled.
\par There were more duellers all over the stairs and in the Hall, Death Eaters everywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, in combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater duelling Kingsley right beside them. Student
s ran in every direction, some carrying or dragging injured friends. Harry directed a Stunning Spell towards the masked Death Eater, it missed but nearly hit Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which looped its
elf happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in.
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione sped down the marble staircase: glass shattered to their left and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded house points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that pe
ople slipped and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the ground and a grey blur that Harry took for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen.
\par \lquote NO!\rquote  shrieked Hermione, a
nd with a deafening blast from her wand Fenrir Greyback was thrown backwards from the feebly stirring body of Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a crystal ball fell
 on the top of his head and he crumpled to the ground and did not move.
\par \lquote I have more!\rquote  shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the banisters, \lquote more for any who want them! Here \endash \rquote 
\par And with a movement like a tennis serve, she heaved another enormous crystal sp
here from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a window. At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst open, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the Entrance Ha
ll.
\par Screams of terror rent the air: the fighters scattered, Death Eaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the oncoming monsters, which shuddered and reared, more terrifying than ever.
\par \lquote How do we get out?\rquote  yelled Ron over all the screaming, but before either Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled aside: Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery pink umbrella.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t hurt \rquote em, don\rquote t hurt \rquote em!\rquote  he yelled.
\par \lquote HAGRID, NO!\rquote 
\par Harry forgot everything else: he sprinted out; from under the Cloak, running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole Hall.
\par \lquote HAGRID, COME BACK!\rquote 
\par But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in their midst.
\par \lquote HAGRID!\rquote 
\par Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend or foe he did not care: he was sprinting down the front steps into the dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with their prey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all.
\par \lquote HAGRID!\rquote 
\par He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst of the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way was i
mpeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked up: a giant stood before him, twenty feet high, its head hidden in shadow, nothing but its tree-like, hairy shins illuminated by lig
ht from the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed a massive fist through an upper window and glass rained down upon Harry, forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway.
\par \lquote Oh my \endash !\rquote  shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up with Harry and gazed upwards at the giant now trying to seize people through the window above.
\par \lquote DON\rquote T!\rquote  Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione\rquote s hand as she raised her wand. \lquote Stun him and he\rquote ll crush half the castle \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote HAGGER?\rquote 
\par Grawp came lurching round the corner of the 
castle; only now did Harry realise that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors looked around and let out a roar. The stone steps trembled as he stomped towards his smaller kin, and Grawp
\rquote s lopsided mouth fell open, showing yellow, half-brick-sized teeth, and then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions.
\par \lquote RUN!\rquote  Harry roared; the night was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione\rquote 
s hand and tore down the steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway towards the Forest before they were brought up short again.
\par The air around them had frozen: Harry\rquote 
s breath caught and solidified in his chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling figures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards the castle, their faces hooded and their breath rattling ...
\par Ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only Dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night ...
\par \lquote Come on, Harry!\rquote  said Hermione\rquote s voice, from a very long way away, \lquote Patronuses, Harry, come on!\rquote 
\par He raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading through him: Fred was gone, and Hagrid was surely dying or already dead; how many more lay dead that he did not yet know about; he felt as though his soul had already half left his body ...
\par \lquote HARRY, COME ON!\rquote  screamed Hermione.
\par A hundred Dementors were advancing, gliding towards them, sucking their way closer to Harry\rquote s despair, which was like a promise of a feast ...
\par He saw Ron\rquote s silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly and expire; he saw Hermione\rquote 
s otter twist in mid-air and fade, and his own wand trembled in his hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling ...
\par And then a silver hare, a boar and a fox soared past Harry, Ron and Hermione\rquote s heads: the Dementors fell back before the creatures\rquote 
 approach. Three more people had arrived out of the darkness to stand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast their Patronuses: Luna, Ernie and Seamus.
\par \lquote That\rquote s right,\rquote  said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the Room of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the DA. \lquote That\rquote s right, Harry ... come on, think of something happy ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Something happy?\rquote  he said, his voice cracked.
\par \lquote We\rquote re all still here,\rquote  she whispered, \lquote we\rquote re still fighting. Come on, now ...\rquote 
\par There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the greatest effort it had ever cost him, the stag burst from the end of Harry\rquote s wand. It cantered forwards, and now the Dementors scattered in earnest, and im
mediately the night was mild again, but the sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears.
\par \lquote Can\rquote t thank you enough,\rquote  said Ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie and Seamus, \lquote you just saved \endash \rquote 
\par With a roar and an earthquaking tremor, another giant came lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the Forest, brandishing a club taller than any of them.
\par \lquote RUN!\rquote  Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling: they all scattered, and not a second too soon, for next moment the creature\rquote s vast foo
t had fallen exactly where they had been standing. Harry looked round: Ron and Hermione were following him, but the other three had vanished back into the battle.
\par \lquote Let\rquote s get out of range!\rquote  yelled Ron, as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the darkness.
\par \lquote The Whomping Willow,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Go!\rquote 
\par Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small space into which he could not look n
ow: thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake, and Voldemort, because that was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it 
\endash 
\par He
 sprinted, half believing he could outdistance death itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through
 grounds that seemed, themselves, to have risen in rebellion, he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw the great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots with whip-like, slashing branches.
\par Panting and gasping Harry slowed down, skirting the Willow\rquote 
s swiping branches, peering through the darkness towards its thick trunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyse it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out of breath she could not speak.
\par \lquote How \endash  how\rquote re we going to get in?\rquote  panted Ron. \lquote I can \endash  see the place \endash  if we just had \endash  Crookshanks again \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Crookshanks?\rquote  wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Are you a wizard, or what?\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \lquote Oh \endash  right \endash  yeah \endash \rquote 
\par Ron looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Wingardium Leviosa!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 The twig flew up from the ground, spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed directly at the trunk through the Willow\rquote s ominously swaying branches
. It jabbed at a place near the roots and at once, the writhing tree became still.
\par \lquote Perfect!\rquote  panted Hermione.
\par \lquote Wait.\rquote 
\par For one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle filled the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, wanted him to come ... was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap?
\par But then the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: the only way forwards was to kill the snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was, and Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel ...
\par \lquote Harry, we\rquote re coming, just get in there!\rquote  said Ron, pushing him forwards.
\par Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree\rquote s roots. It was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it. The tunnel was low-ceilinged: they had had to double up to move through it nearly four years 
previously, now there was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went first, his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none came. They moved in silence, Harry\rquote s gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in his fist.

\par At last the tunnel began to slope upwards and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. Hermione tugged at his ankle.
\par \lquote The Cloak!\rquote  she whispered. \lquote Put the Cloak on!\rquote 
\par He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, murmured, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Nox,\rquote  }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his hands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining, expecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear voice, see a flash of green light.
\par A
nd then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them, only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up to the op
ening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall.
\par The room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirl\-ing and coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which floated unsupported in mid-air. He could se
e the edge of a table, and a long-fingered, white hand toying with a wand. Then Snape spoke, and Harry\rquote s heart lurched: Snape was inches away from where he crouched, hidden.
\par \lquote ... my Lord, their resistance is crumbling \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  and it is doing so without your help,\rquote  said Voldemort, in his high, clear voice. \lquote Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make much difference now. We are almost there ... almost.\rquote 
\par \lquote Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find him, my Lord. Please.\rquote 
\par Snape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could not think of anything. One failed attempt, and he woul
d give away his position ...
\par Voldemort stood up. Harry could see him now, see the red eyes, the flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of him gleaming slightly in the semi-darkness.
\par \lquote I have a problem, Severus,\rquote  said Voldemort softly.
\par \lquote My Lord?\rquote  said Snape.
\par Voldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and precisely as a conductor\rquote s baton.
\par \lquote Why doesn\rquote t it work for me, Severus?\rquote 
\par In the silence, Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled, or was it Voldemort\rquote s sibilant sigh lingering on the air?
\par \lquote My \endash  my Lord?\rquote  said Snape blankly. \lquote I do not understand. You \endash  you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand.\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Voldemort. \lquote I have performed my usual magic. I am extraordinary, but this wand ... no. I
t has not revealed the wonders it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago.\rquote 
\par Voldemort\rquote s tone was musing, calm, but Harry\rquote s scar had begun to throb and pulse: pain was building in his forehead and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort.
\par \lquote No difference,\rquote  said Voldemort again.
\par Snape did not speak. Harry could not see his face: he wondered whether Snape sensed danger, was trying to find the right words, to reassure his master.
\par Voldemort started to move around the room: Harry lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled, speaking in that same measured voice, while the pain and fury mounted in Harry.
\par \lquote I have thought long and hard, Severus ... do you know why I have called you back from the battle?\rquote 
\par And for a moment Harry saw Snape\rquote s profile: his eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage.
\par \lquote No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find Potter.\rquote 
\par \lquote You sound like Lucius. Neither of you un
derstands Potter as I do. He does not need finding. Potter will come to me. I know his weakness, you see, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the others struck down around him, knowing that it is for him that it happens. He will want to stop it at a
ny cost. He will come.\rquote 
\par \lquote But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by one other than yourself \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote My instructions to my Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. Capture Potter. Kill his friends \endash  the more, the better \endash  but do not kill him.
\par \lquote But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable.\rquote 
\par \lquote My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But \endash  let me go and find the boy, my Lord. Let me bring him to you. I know I can \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I have told you, no!\rquote  said Voldemort, and Harry caught the glint of red in his eyes as he turned again, and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort\rquote s impatience in his burning scar. 
\lquote My concern at the moment, Severus, is what will happen when I finally meet the boy!\rquote 
\par \lquote My Lord, there can be no question, surely \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  but there }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 a question, Severus. There is.\rquote 
\par Voldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly again as he slid the Elder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape.
\par \lquote Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  I cannot answer that, my Lord.\rquote 
\par \lquote Can\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry\rquote s head: he forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain. He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking into Snape\rquote s pale face.
\par \lquote My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except to kill Harry Potter. Twice it failed. Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores, told me to take another\rquote s wand. I did so, but Lucius\rquote 
s wand shattered upon meeting Potter\rquote s.\rquote 
\par \lquote I \endash  I have no explanation, my Lord.\rquote 
\par Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere.
\par \lquote I sought a third wand, Severus. The Elder Wand, the Wand of Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I took it from the grave of Albus Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape\rquote s face was like a death mask. It was marble white and so still that when he spoke it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes.
\par \lquote My Lord \endash  let me go to the boy \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote All this long night, when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,\rquote  said Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper, \lquote 
wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner ... and I think I have the answer.\rquote 
\par Snape did not speak.
\par \lquote Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen.\rquote 
\par \lquote My Lord \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine.\rquote 

\par \lquote My Lord!\rquote  Snape protested, raising his wand.
\par \lquote It cannot be any other way,\rquote  said Voldemort. \lquote I must master the wand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.\rquote 
\par And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to Snape, who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved: but then Voldemort\rquote s intention became clear. The snake\rquote s cage was rolling through the air
, and before Snape could do anything more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Kill.\rquote 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape\rquote s face losing the little colour it had left, it whitened as his black eyes widened, as the snake\rquote 
s fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself, as his knees gave way, and he fell to the floor.
\par \lquote I regret it,\rquote  said Voldemort coldly.
\par He turned away; there was no sadness 
in him, no remorse. It was time to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would now do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake, which drifted upwards, off Snape, who fell sideways on to the floor, blood gushing fro
m the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from the room without a backwards glance, and the great serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere.
\par Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes: he had drawn blood, biting down on his knu
ckles in the effort not to shout out. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor.
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view. It lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways, silently. As quietly as he could, he pulled himself up into the room.
\par He did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the dying man: he did not know what he felt as he saw Snape\rquote s 
white face, and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck. Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak and looked down upon the man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as he tried to speak. Harry bent over him; and Snape seized the 
front of his robes and pulled him close.
\par A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape\rquote s throat.
\par \lquote Take ... it ... Take ... it ...\rquote 
\par Something more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed from his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what to do \endash 
\par A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hands by Hermione. Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand. When the flask was full to the brim, and Snape looked as though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry
\rquote s robes slackened.
\par \lquote Look ... at ... me ...\rquote  he whispered.
\par The green eyes found the black, but after a second something in the depths of the dark pair seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, blank and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and Snape moved no more.

s voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Harry realised that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all
 the surrounding area, that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a death blow away.
\par \lquote You have fought,\rquote  said the high, cold voice, \lquote valiantly. Lord Voldemort knows how to value bravery.
\par \lquote Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste.
\par \lquote Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat, immediately.
\par \lquote You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured.
\par \lquote I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face
 me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I
 shall punish every last man, woman and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.\rquote 
\par Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t listen to him,\rquote  said Ron.
\par \lquote It\rquote ll be all right,\rquote  said Hermione wildly. \lquote Let\rquote s \endash  let\rquote s get back to the castle, if he\rquote s gone to the Forest we\rquote ll need to think of a new plan \endash \rquote 
\par She glanced at Snape\rquote s body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron followed her. Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. He did no
t know what to feel, except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason for which it had been done ...
\par They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking, and Harry wondered whether Ron and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their heads, as he could.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest ... one hour ...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle. It could only be a
n hour or so from dawn, yet it was pitch black. The three of them hurried towards the stone steps. A lone clog, the size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There was no other sign of Grawp or of his attacker.
\par The castle was unnaturally silent
. There were no flashes of light now, no bangs or screams or shouts. The flagstones of the deserted Entrance Hall were stained with blood. Emeralds were still scattered all over the floor along with pieces of marble and splintered wood. Part of the banist
ers had been blown away.
\par \lquote Where is everyone?\rquote  whispered Hermione.
\par Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway.
\par The house tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors stood in groups, their arms around each other\rquote s necks. The 
injured were being treated up on the raised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the injured; his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay, unable to stand.
\par The dead lay in a row in the middle of the hall. Harry could not see Fred\rquote s body, because his family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head; Mrs Weasley was lying across Fred\rquote 
s chest, her body shaking, Mr Weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks.
\par Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw Hermione approach Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur and Percy, who flung an arm around Ron\rquote 
s shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred: Remus and Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling.
\par The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry reeled backwards from the doorway. He coul
d not draw breath. He could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself up in the first place, Fred might never have di
ed ...
\par He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks ... he yearned not to feel ... he wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming inside him ...
\par The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in the Great Hall. Harry ran with\-out stopping, clutching the crystal flask of Snape\rquote 
s last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the Headmaster\rquote s office.
\par \lquote Password?\rquote 
\par \lquote Dumbledore!\rquote  said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the spiral staircase behind.
\par But when Harry burst into the circular office, he found a change. The portraits that hung all around the wa
lls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the castle, so that they could have a clear view of what was going on.
\par Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore\rquote s deserted frame, which hung directly behind the Headmaster\rquote 
s chair, then turned his back on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been: Harry heaved it on to the desk and poured Snape\rquote s memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge. To escape into someone else
\rquote s head would be a blessed relief ... nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts. The memories swirled, silver-white and strange, and without hesitating, with a feeli
ng of reckless abandonment, as though this would assuage his torturing grief, Harry dived.
\par He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he straightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single, huge chimney d
ominated the distant skyline. Two girls were swinging backwards and forwards, and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate: too-short jeans, a sh
abby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smock-like shirt.
\par Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, sallow, small, stringy. There was undis\-guised greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister.
\par \lquote Lily, don\rquote t do it!\rquote  shrieked the elder of the two.
\par But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air, quite literally flown, launched herself skywar
ds with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she soared, like a trapeze artist through the air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly.
\par \lquote Mummy told you not to!\rquote 
\par Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground, making a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips.
\par \lquote Mummy said you weren\rquote t allowed, Lily!\rquote 
\par \lquote But I\rquote m fine,\rquote  said Lily, still giggling. \lquote Tuney, look at this. Watch what I can do.\rquote 
\par Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from themselves and, though the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curi
osity and disapproval. Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held out her palm. The flower sat there, opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster.
\par \lquote Stop it!\rquote  shrieked Petunia.
\par \lquote It\rquote s not hurting you,\rquote  said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground.
\par \lquote It\rquote s not right,\rquote  said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower\rquote s flight to the ground and lingered upon it. \lquote How do you do it?\rquote  she added, and there was definite longing in her voice.
\par \lquote It\rquote s obvious, isn\rquote t it?\rquote 
 Snape could no longer contain himself, but had jumped out from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backwards towards the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled, remained where she was. Snape seemed to 
regret his appearance. A dull flush of colour mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily.
\par \lquote What\rquote s obvious?\rquote  asked Lily.
\par Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant Petunia, now hovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, \lquote I know what you are.\rquote 
\par \lquote What do you mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re ... you\rquote re a witch,\rquote  whispered Snape.
\par She looked affronted.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote That\rquote s }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 not a very nice thing to say to somebody!\rquote 
\par She turned, nose in the air, and marched off towards her sister.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  said Snape. He
 was highly coloured now, and Harry wondered why he did not take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did not want to reveal the smock beneath it. He flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously bat-like, like his older self.
\par The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the swing poles as though it was the safe place in tag.
\par \lquote You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 are,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 said Snape to Lily. \lquote You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37

\rquote s one, and I\rquote m a wizard.\rquote

\par \lquote Haven\rquote t been spying,\rquote  said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. Wouldn\rquote t spy on }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 you, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake the tone.
\par \lquote Lily, come on, we\rquote re leaving!\rquote  she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at once, glaring at Snape as she lef
t. He stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate, and Harry, the only one left to observe him, recognised Snape\rquote 
s bitter disappointment, and understood that Snape had been planning this moment for a while, and that it had all gone wrong ...
\par The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, reformed around him. He was now in a small thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. The shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool, green shade. Two children sat
 facing each other, cross-legged on the ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less peculiar in the half-light.
\par \lquote ... and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you get letters.\rquote 
\par \lquote But I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 have }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 done magic outside school!\rquote

ve got to go careful.\rquote 
\par There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air, and Harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, leaned in towards the boy, and said, \lquote It }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37

\par \lquote Really?\rquote  whispered Lily.
\par \lquote Definitely,\rquote  said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes, he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful of confidence in his destiny.
\par \lquote And will it really come by owl?\rquote  Lily whispered.
\par \lquote Normally,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote But you\rquote re Muggle-born, so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents.\rquote 
\par \lquote Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?\rquote 
\par Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair.
\par \lquote No,\rquote  he said. \lquote It doesn\rquote t make any difference.\rquote 
\par \lquote Good,\rquote  said Lily, relaxing: it was clear that she had been worrying.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve got loads of magic,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote I saw that. All the time I was watching you \'85\rquote 
\par His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. He watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground.
\par \lquote How are things at your house?\rquote  Lily asked.
\par A little crease appeared between his eyes.
\par \lquote Fine,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote They\rquote re not arguing any more?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yes, they\rquote re arguing,\rquote  said Snape. He picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing. \lquote But it won\rquote t be that long and I\rquote ll be gone.\rquote 
\par \lquote Doesn\rquote t your dad like magic?\rquote 
\par \lquote He doesn\rquote t like anything, much,\rquote  said Snape.

\par He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small rustling noise behind Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing.
\par \lquote Tuney!\rquote  said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to his feet.
\par \lquote Who\rquote s spying now?\rquote  he shouted. \lquote What d\rquote you want?\rquote 
\par Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her struggling for something hurtful to say.
\par \lquote What is that you\rquote re wearing, anyway?\rquote  she said, pointing at Snape\rquote s chest. \lquote Your mum\rquote s blouse?\rquote 
\par There was a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 crack: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 a branch over Petunia\rquote s head h

\par \lquote Tuney!\rquote 
\par But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape.
\par \lquote Did you make that happen?\rquote 
\par \lquote No.\rquote  He looked both defiant and scared.
\par \lquote You did!\rquote  She was backing away from him. \lquote You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 did! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\par \lquote No \endash  no I didn\rquote t!\rquote 
\par But the lie did not convince Lily: after one last burning look she ran from the little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused ...
\par And the scene 
reformed. Harry looked around: he was on platform nine and three-quarters, and Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, sour-looking woman who greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four a short distance awa
y. The two girls stood a little apart from their parents. Lily seemed to be pleading with her sister; Harry moved closer to listen.
\par \lquote ... I\rquote m sorry, Tuney, I\rquote m sorry! Listen \endash \rquote  She caught her sister\rquote s hand and held tight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull it away. \lquote Maybe once I\rquote m there \endash 
 no, listen, Tuney! Maybe once I\rquote m there, I\rquote ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t \endash  want \endash  to \endash  go!\rquote  said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her sister\rquote s grasp. \lquote You think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a \endash  a \endash \rquote 
\par Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in their owners\rquote  arms, over the owls fluttering and hooting at each other in cages, over the students, some already in the

\par \lquote \endash  you think I want to be a \endash  a freak?\rquote 
\par Lily\rquote s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away.
\par \lquote I\rquote m not a freak,\rquote  said Lily. \lquote That\rquote s a horrible thing to say.\rquote 
\par \lquote That\rquote s where you\rquote re going,\rquote  said Petunia with relish. \lquote A special school for freaks. You and that Snape boy ... weirdos, that\rquote s what you two are. It\rquote s good you\rquote re being separated from normal peopl
e. It\rquote s for our safety.\rquote 
\par Lily glanced towards her parents, who were looking around the platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she looked back at her sister, and her voice was low and fierce.
\par \lquote You didn\rquote t think it was such a freak\rquote s school when you wrote to the Headmaster and begged him to take you.\rquote 
\par Petunia turned scarlet.
\par \lquote Beg? I didn\rquote t beg!\rquote 
\par \lquote I saw his reply. It was very kind.\rquote 
\par \lquote You shouldn\rquote t have read \endash \rquote  whispered Petunia. \lquote That was my private \endash  how could you \endash ?\rquote 
\par Lily gave herself away by half glancing towards where Snape stood, nearby. Petunia gasped.
\par \lquote That boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!\rquote 
\par \lquote No \endash  not sneaking \endash \rquote  Now Lily was on the defensive. \lquote Severus saw the envelope, and he couldn\rquote t believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts, that\rquote

\par \lquote Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!\rquote  said Petunia, now as pale as she had been flushed. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Freak!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the Hogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside. He had already changed into his school robes, had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle clothes
. At last he stopped, outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were talking. Hunched in a corner seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against the window pane.
\par Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily. She glanced at him and then looked back out of the window. She had been crying.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t want to talk to you,\rquote  she said in a constricted voice.
\par \lquote Why not?\rquote 
\par \lquote Tuney h \endash  hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.\rquote 
\par \lquote So what?\rquote 
\par She threw him a look of deep dislike.
\par \lquote So she\rquote s my sister!\rquote 
\par \lquote She\rquote s only a \endash \rquote  He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed, did not hear him.
\par \lquote But we\rquote re going!\rquote  he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. \lquote This is it! We\rquote re off to Hogwarts!\rquote 
\par She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled.
\par \lquote You\rquote d better be in Slytherin,\rquote  said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a little.
\par \lquote Slytherin?\rquote 
\par One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at a
ll in Lily or Snape until that point, looked round at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been well cared for
, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked.
\par \lquote Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I\rquote d leave, wouldn\rquote t you?\rquote  James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realised that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile.
\par \lquote My whole family have been in Slytherin,\rquote  he said.
\par \lquote Blimey,\rquote  said James, \lquote and I thought you seemed all right!\rquote 
\par Sirius grinned.
\par \lquote Maybe I\rquote ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you\rquote ve got the choice?\rquote 
\par James lifted an invisible sword.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote \'93Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!\'94 }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Like my dad.\rquote 

\par Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him.
\par \lquote Got a problem with that?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. \lquote If you\rquote d rather be brawny than brainy \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Where\rquote re you hoping to go, seeing as you\rquote re neither?\rquote  inter\-jected Sirius.
\par James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in dislike.
\par \lquote Come on, Severus, let\rquote s find another compartment.\rquote 
\par \lquote Oooooo ...\rquote 
\par James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he passed.
\par \lquote See ya, Snivellus!\rquote  a voice called, as the compartment door slammed ...
\par And the scene dissolved once more ...
\par Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit house tables, lined with rapt faces. Then Professor McGonagall said, \lquote Evans, Lily!\rquote 
\par He watched his mother walk forwards on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool. Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat on to her head, and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair the Hat cried, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Gryffindor!\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par Harry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off the Hat, handed it back to Professor McGonagall, then hurried towards the cheering Gryffindors, but as she went she glanced back a
t Snape, and there was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up the bench to make room for her. She took one look at him, seemed to recognise him from the train, folded her arms and firmly turned her back on him.
\par The roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew and his father join Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table. At last, when only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall called Snape.
\par Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the Hat upon his head. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Slytherin!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 cried the Sorting Hat.
\par And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted Snape on the back as he sat down beside him ...
\par And the scene changed ...
\par Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he realised how much taller they both were: a few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting.
\par \lquote ... thought we were supposed to be friends?\rquote  Snape was saying. \lquote Best friends?\rquote 
\par \lquote We }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 are, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Sev, but I don\rquote t like some of the people you\rquote

\par Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face.
\par \lquote That was nothing,\rquote  said Snape. \lquote It was a laugh, that\rquote s all \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote It was Dark Magic, and if you think that\rquote s funny \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?\rquote  demanded Snape. His colour rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment.
\par \lquote What\rquote s Potter got to do with anything?\rquote  said Lily.
\par \lquote They sneak out at night. There\rquote s something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?\rquote 
\par \lquote He\rquote s ill,\rquote  said Lily. \lquote They say he\rquote s ill \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Every month at the full moon?\rquote  said Snape.
\par \lquote I know your theory,\rquote  said Lily, and she sounded cold. \lquote Why are you so obsessed with them, anyway? Why do you care what they\rquote re doing at night?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m just trying to show you they\rquote re not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.\rquote 
\par The intensity of his gaze made her blush.
\par \lquote They don\rquote t use Dark Magic, though.\rquote  She dropped her voice. \lquote And you\rquote

\par \lquote I didn\rquote t mean \endash  I just don\rquote t want to see you made a fool of \endash  he fancies you, James Potter fancies you!\rquote  The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. \lquote And he\rquote

\par \lquote I know James Potter\rquote s an arrogant toerag,\rquote  she said, cutting across Snape. \lquote I don\rquote t need you to tell me that. But Mulciber and Avery\rquote s idea of humour is just evil. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Evil,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640  Sev. I don\rquote t understand how you can be friends with them.\rquote 
\par Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on Mulciber and Avery. The moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there was a new spring in Snape\rquote s step ...
\par And the scene dissolved ...
\par Harry watched, again, as Snape left from the Great Hall, after sitting his O.W.L. in Defence Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed, inadvertently, close to the place beneath the beech 
tree where James, Sirius, Lupin and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry kept his distance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure
 to hear it again. He watched, as Lily joined the group and went to Snape\rquote s defence. Distantly he heard Snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Mudblood.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\par \lquote I\rquote m not interested.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m sorry!\rquote 
\par \lquote Save your breath.\rquote 
\par It was night-time. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower.
\par \lquote I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here.\rquote 
\par \lquote I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Slipped out?\rquote  There was no pity in Lily\rquote s voice. \lquote It\rquote s too late. I\rquote ve made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends 
\endash  you see, you don\rquote t even deny it! You don\rquote t even deny that\rquote s what you\rquote re all aiming to be! You can\rquote t wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?\rquote

\par \lquote I can\rquote t pretend any more. You\rquote ve chosen your way, I\rquote ve chosen mine.\rquote 
\par \lquote No \endash  listen, I didn\rquote t mean \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?\rquote 
\par He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole ...
\par The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to reform: Harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colours until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn and co
ld in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees. The adult Snape was panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something or for someone ... his fear infected Harry, too, even though
 he knew that he could not be harmed, and he looked over his shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for \endash 
\par Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air: Harry thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t kill me!\rquote 
\par \lquote That was not my intention.\rquote 
\par Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand.
\par \lquote Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me?\rquote 
\par \lquote No \endash  no message \endash  I\rquote m here on my own account!\rquote 
\par Snape was wringing his hands: he looked a little mad, with his straggling, black hair flying around him.
\par \lquote I \endash  I come with a warning \endash  no, a request \endash  please \endash \rquote 
\par Dumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still flew through the night air around them, silence fell on the spot where he and Snape faced each other.
\par \lquote What request could a Death Eater make of me?\rquote 
\par \lquote The \endash  the prophecy ... the prediction ... Trelawney ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?\rquote 
\par \lquote Everything \endash  everything I heard!\rquote  said Snape. \lquote That is why \endash  it is for that reason \endash  he thinks it means Lily Evans!\rquote 
\par \lquote The prophecy did not refer to a woman,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote It spoke of a boy born at the end of July \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down \endash  kill them all \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote If she means so much to you,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?\rquote 
\par \lquote I have \endash  I have asked him \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You disgust me,\rquote  said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little. \lquote 
You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?\rquote 
\par Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Hide them all, then,\rquote  he croaked. \lquote Keep her \endash  them \endash  safe. Please.\rquote 
\par \lquote And what will you give me in return, Severus?\rquote 
\par \lquote In \endash  in return?\rquote  Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a long moment he said, \lquote Anything.\rquote 
\par The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore\rquote s offic
e, and something was making a terrible sound, like a wounded animal. Snape was slumped forwards in a chair and Dumbledore was standing over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised his face, and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred y
ears of misery since leaving the wild hilltop.
\par \lquote I thought ... you were going ... to keep her ... safe ...\rquote 
\par \lquote She and James put their faith in the wrong person,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Rather like you, Severus. Weren\rquote t you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her?\rquote 
\par Snape\rquote s breathing was shallow.
\par \lquote Her boy survives,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly.
\par \lquote Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the shape and colour of Lily Evans\rquote s eyes, I am sure?\rquote 
\par \lquote DON\rquote T!\rquote  bellowed Snape. \lquote Gone ... Dead ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Is this remorse, Severus?\rquote 
\par \lquote I wish ... I wish }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 were dead \'85\rquote 
\par \lquote And what use would that be to anyone?\rquote  said Dumbledore coldly. \lquote If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.\rquote 
\par Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore\rquote s words appeared to take a long time to reach him.
\par \lquote What \endash  what do you mean?\rquote 
\par \lquote You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect Lily\rquote s son.\rquote 
\par \lquote He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  the Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does.\rquote 
\par There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself, mastered his own breathing. At last he said, \lquote Very well. Very well. But never \endash 
 never tell, Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I cannot bear ... especially Potter\rquote s son ... I want your word!\rquote 
\par \lquote My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?\rquote  Dumbledore sighed, looking down into Snape\rquote s ferocious, anguished face. \lquote If you insist \'85\rquote 
\par The office dissolved but re-formed instantly. Snape was pacing up and down in front of Dumbledore.
\par \lquote \endash  mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You see what you expect to see, Severus,\rquote  said Dumbledore, without raising his eyes from a copy of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Transfiguration Today. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37

\par Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, \lquote Keep an eye on Quirrell, won\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par A whirl of colour, and now everything darkened, and Snape and Dumbledore stood a little apart in the Entrance Hall, while the last stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed.
\par \lquote Well?\rquote  murmured Dumbledore.
\par \lquote Karkaroff\rquote s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears retribution; you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell.\rquote  Snape looked sideways at Dumbledore\rquote s crooked-nosed profile. \lquote 
Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns.\rquote 
\par \lquote Does he?\rquote  said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came giggling in from the grounds. \lquote And are you tempted to join him?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur and Roger\rquote s retreating figures. \lquote I am not such a coward.\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  agreed Dumbledore. \lquote You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff. You know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon ...\rquote 
\par He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken ...
\par And now Harry stood in the Headmaster\rquote 
s office yet again. It was night-time, and Dumbledore sagged sideways in the throne-like chair behind the desk, apparently semi-conscious. His right hand dangled over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was muttering in
cantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down Dumbledore\rquote s throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore\rquote s eyelids fluttered and opened.
\par \lquote Why,\rquote  said Snape, without preamble, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote why }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\par Marvolo Gaunt\rquote s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it.
\par Dumbledore grimaced.
\par \lquote I ... was a fool. Sorely tempted ...\rquote 
\par \lquote Tempted by what?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore did not answer.
\par \lquote It is a miracle you managed to return here!\rquote  Snape sounded furious. \lquote That ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being \endash \rquote 

\par Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio.
\par \lquote You have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I have?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore\rquote s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a weather forecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, \lquote 
I cannot tell. Maybe a year. There is no halting such a spell forever. It will spread, eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to him.
\par \lquote I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.\rquote 
\par \lquote If you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have been able to do more, buy you more time!\rquote  said Snape furiously. He looked down at the broken ring and the sword. \lquote Did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse?
\rquote 
\par \lquote Something like that ... I was delirious, no doubt ...\rquote  said Dumbledore. With an effort, he straightened himself in his chair. \lquote Well, really, this makes matters much more straightforward.\rquote 
\par Snape looked utterly perplexed. Dumbledore smiled.
\par \lquote I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.\rquote 
\par Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk from Dumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of Dumbledore\rquote 
s cursed hand, but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. Scowling, Snape said, \lquote The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This is merely punishment for Lucius\rquote s recent failures. Slow torture for Draco
\rquote s parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price.\rquote 
\par \lquote In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Now, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?\rquote 
\par There was a short pause.
\par \lquote That, I think, is the Dark Lord\rquote s plan.\rquote 
\par \lquote Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts?\rquote 
\par \lquote He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.\rquote 
\par \lquote And if it does fall into his grasp,\rquote  said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed, as an aside, \lquote I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students of Hogwarts?\rquote 
\par Snape gave a stiff nod.
\par \lquote Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to. A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself. Offer him help and guidance, he ought to accept, he likes you \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  much less since his father has lost favour. Draco blames me, he thinks I have usurped Lucius\rquote s position.\rquote 
\par \lquote All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord Voldemort\rquote s wrath.\rquote 

\par Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, \lquote Are you intending to let him kill you?\rquote 
\par \lquote Certainly not. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 You }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 must kill me.\rquote 
\par There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone.
\par \lquote Would you like me to do it now?\rquote  asked Snape, his voice heavy with irony. \lquote Or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, not quite yet,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling. \lquote I daresay the moment will present itself in due course. Given what has happened tonight,\rquote  he indicated his withered hand, \lquote we can be sure that it will happen within a year.
\rquote 
\par \lquote If you don\rquote t mind dying,\rquote  said Snape roughly, \lquote why not let Draco do it?\rquote 
\par \lquote That boy\rquote s soul is not yet so damaged,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I would not have it ripped apart on my account.\rquote 
\par \lquote And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?\rquote 
\par \lquote You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote I ask this one, gr
eat favour of you, Severus, because death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year\rquote 
s league. I confess I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if, for instance, Greyback is involved \endash 
 I hear Voldemort has recruited him? Or dear Bellatrix, who likes to play with her food before she eats it.\rquote 
\par His tone was light but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had frequently pierced Harry, as though the soul they discussed was visible to him. At last Snape gave another curt nod.
\par Dumbledore seemed satisfied.
\par \lquote Thank you, Severus ...\rquote 
\par The office disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight.
\par \lquote What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are closeted together?\rquote  Snape asked abruptly.
\par Dumbledore looked weary.
\par \lquote Why? You aren\rquote t trying to give him }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 more }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
detentions, Severus? The boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out.\rquote 
\par \lquote He is his father over again \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother\rquote s. I spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss with him, information I must give him before it is too late.\rquote 
\par \lquote Information,\rquote  repeated Snape. \lquote You trust him ... you do not trust me.\rquote 
\par \lquote It is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited time. It is essential that I give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do.\rquote 
\par \lquote And why may I not have the same information?\rquote 
\par \lquote I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort.\rquote 
\par \lquote Which I do on your orders!\rquote 
\par \lquote And you do it extremely well. Do not think that I under\-estimate the constant danger in which you place yourself, Severus. To give Voldemort what appears to be valuable informa\-
tion while withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but you.\rquote 
\par \lquote Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency, whose magic is mediocre and who has a direct connection into the Dark Lord\rquote s mind!\rquote 
\par \lquote Voldemort fears that connection,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Not so long ago he had one, small taste of what truly sharing Harry\rquote s mind means to him. It was pain such as he has never experienced.
 He will not try to possess Harry again, I am sure of it. Not in that way.\rquote 
\par \lquote I don\rquote t understand.\rquote 
\par \lquote Lord Voldemort\rquote s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a soul like Harry\rquote s. Like a tongue on frozen steel, like flesh in flame \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Souls? We were talking of minds!\rquote 
\par \lquote In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to speak of the other.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. They were close by the Forbidden Forest, now, but there was no sign of anyone near them.
\par \lquote After you have killed me, Severus \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small service of me!\rquote  snarled Snape, and real anger flared in the thin face now. \lquote You take a great deal for granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I have changed my mind!\rquote 
\par \lquote You gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking about services you owe me, I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend?\rquote 
\par Snape looked angry, mutinous. Dumbledore sighed.
\par \lquote Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not complain that I have no confidence in you ...\rquote 
\par They were back in Dumbledore\rquote s office, the windows dark, and Fawkes sat silent as Snape sat quite still, as Dumbledore walked around him, talking.
\par \lquote Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary, otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done?\rquote 
\par \lquote But what must he do?\rquote 
\par \lquote That is between Harry and me. Now, listen closely, Severus. There will come a time \endash  after my death \endash  do not argue, do not interrupt! There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.\rquote 

\par \lquote For Nagini?\rquote  Snape looked astonished.
\par \lquote Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him, under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Tell him what?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
\par \lquote Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort\rquote 
s soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself on to the only living so
ul left in that collapsing building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord Voldemort\rquote 
s mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to, and protected by Harry, Lord Voldemort cannot die.\rquote 
\par Harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel, they were so far away from him, their voices echoing strangely in his ears.
\par \lquote So the boy ... the boy must die?\rquote  asked Snape, quite calmly.
\par \lquote And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.\rquote 
\par Another long silence. Then Snape said, \lquote I thought ... all these years ... that we were protecting him for her. For Lily.\rquote 
\par \lquote We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try his strength,\rquote  said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. \lquote 
Meanwhile, the connection between them grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth: sometimes I have thought he suspects it himsel
f. If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will, truly, mean the end of Voldemort.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified.
\par \lquote You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?\rquote 
\par \lquote Don\rquote t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?\rquote 
\par \lquote Lately, only those whom I could not save,\rquote  said Snape. He stood up. \lquote You have used me.\rquote 
\par \lquote Meaning?\rquote 
\par \lquote I have spied for you, and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter\rquote s son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote But this is touching, Severus,\rquote  said Dumbledore seriously. \lquote Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?\rquote 
\par \lquote For }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 him?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 shouted Snape. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe: she landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape,
 and his eyes were full of tears.
\par \lquote After all this time?\rquote 
\par \lquote Always,\rquote  said Snape.
\par And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of Dumbledore behind his desk.
\par \lquote You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry\rquote s departure from his aunt and uncle\rquote s,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote 
Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well-informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys \endash  that, I think, ought to ensure Harry\rquote s safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Sever
us, if you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly ... I am counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemort\rquote s good books as long as possible, or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows ...\rquote 
\par Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern, Mundungus\rquote s face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in concentration.
\par \lquote You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,\rquote  Snape murmured, \lquote that they use decoys. Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It is the on
ly thing that might work. You will forget that I have suggested this. You will present it as your own idea. You understand?\rquote 
\par \lquote I understand,\rquote  murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused ...
\par Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dar
k night: he was accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really George ... a Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin\rquote s back \endash 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Sectumsempra!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 shouted Snape.
\par But the spell, intended for the Death Eater\rquote s wand hand, missed and hit George instead \endash 
\par And next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius\rquote s old bedroom. Tears were dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily. The second page carried only a few words:

\par Snape turned at the door.
\par \lquote Don\rquote t worry, Dumbledore,\rquote  he said coolly. \lquote I have a plan ...\rquote

Finally, the truth. Lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought he was learning the secrets of victory, Harry understood at last that he was not supposed to survive. His job was to walk calmly into Death
\rquote s welcoming arms. Along the way, he was to dispose of Voldemort\rquote s remaining links to life, so that when at last he flung himself across Voldemort\rquote 
s path, and did not raise a wand to defend himself, the end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done in Godric\rquote s Hollow would be finished: neither would live, neither could survive.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that in his dread of death, it pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping him alive. But it would have to stop, an
d soon. Its beats were numbered. How many would there be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time, out into the grounds and into the Forest?
\par Terror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral drum pounding inside h
im. Would it hurt to die? All those times he had thought that it was about to happen and escaped, he had never really thought of the thing itself: his will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear of death. Yet it did not occur to him now to
 try to escape, to outrun Voldemort. It was over, he knew it, and all that was left was the thing itself: dying.
\par If he could only have died on that summer\rquote s night when he had left number four, Privet Drive for the last time, when the noble phoenix feather w
and had saved him! If he could only have died like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened! Or if he could have launched himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved ... he envied even his parents\rquote 
 deaths now. This cold-blooded walk to his own destruction would require a different kind of bravery. He felt his fingers trembling slightly and made an effort to control them, although no one could see him; the portraits on the walls were all empty.

\par Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as
 he did so he felt more alive, and more aware of his own living body than ever before. Why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was, brain and nerve and bounding heart? It would all be gone ... or at least, he would be gone from it. His breath came 
slow and deep, and his mouth and throat were completely dry, but so were his eyes.
\par Dumbledore\rquote s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had been a bigger plan; Harry had simply been too foolish to see it, he realised that now. He had never questioned h
is own assumption that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his lifespan had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to him, and obediently he had continued to chi
p
 away at the bonds tying not only Voldemort, but himself, to life! How neat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not be a calamity, but anothe
r blow against Voldemort.
\par And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out, that he would keep going to the end, even though it was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 his }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 end, because he had taken trouble to get to know him, hadn\rquote t he? Dumbledore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry wou
ld not let anyone else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it. The images of Fred, Lupin and Tonks lying dead in the Great Hall forced their way back into his mind\rquote 
s eye, and for a moment he could hardly breathe: Death was impatient ...
\par But Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed: the snake survived. One Horcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the earth, even after Harry had been killed. True, that would mean an easier job for somebody. He wondered who would do it ... Ro
n and Hermione would know what needed to be done, of course ... that would have been why Dumbledore wanted him to confide in two others ... so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early, they could carry on ...
\par Like rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the hard surface of the incontrovertible truth, which was that he must die. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 I must die. }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 It must end.
\par Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far-off country; he felt as though he had parted from them long ago. There would be 
no goodbyes and no explanations, he was determined of that. This was a journey they could not take together, and the attempts they would make to stop him would waste valuable time. He looked down at the battered gold watch he had received on his seventeen
th birthday. Nearly half of the hour allotted by Voldemort for his surrender had elapsed.
\par He stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird. Perhaps it knew it had little time left, perhaps it was determined to fulfil a lifetime\rquote s beats before the end. He did not look back as he closed the office door.
\par The castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as if he had already died. The portrait people were still missing from their frames; the whole place was eerily still, as 
if all its remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall, where the dead and the mourners were crammed.
\par Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended through the floors, at last walking down the marble staircase into the Entrance
 Hall. Perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable, perfect, and he reached the front doors easily.
\par Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half of a pair that was carrying a
 body in from the grounds. Harry glanced down, and felt another dull blow to his stomach: Colin Creevey, though under-age, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle had done. He was tiny in death.
\par \lquote You know what? I can manage him alone, Neville,\rquote  said Oliver Wood, and he heaved Colin over his shoulder in a fireman\rquote s lift and carried him into the Great Hall.
\par Neville leaned against the doorframe for a moment and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. He looked like an old man. Then he set off down the steps again into the darkness to recover more bodies.
\par Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall. People were moving around, trying to comfort each other, drink\-ing, kneeling beside the dead, but he could not see any of the 
people he loved, no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny or any of the other Weasleys, no Luna. He felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them; but then, would he ever have had the strength to stop looking? It was better 
like this.
\par He moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was nearly four in the morning and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they were holding their breath, waiting to see whether he could do what he must.
\par Harry moved towards Neville, who was bending over another body.
\par \lquote Neville.\rquote 
\par \lquote Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!\rquote 
\par Harry had pulled off the Cloak: the idea had come to him out of nowhere, born out of a desire to make absolutely sure.
\par \lquote Where are you going, alone?\rquote  Neville asked suspiciously.
\par \lquote It\rquote s all part of the plan,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote There\rquote s something I\rquote ve got to do. Listen \endash  Neville \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Harry!\rquote  Neville looked suddenly scared. \lquote Harry, you\rquote re not thinking of handing yourself over?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  Harry lied easily. \lquote \rquote Course not ... this is something else. But I might be out of sight for a while. You know Voldemort\rquote s snake, Neville? He\rquote s got a huge snake ... calls it Nagini ...\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve heard, yeah ... what about it?\rquote 
\par \lquote It\rquote s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in case they \endash \rquote 
\par The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment, made it impossible to keep talking. But he pulled himself together again: this was crucial, he must be like Dumbledore, keep a cool head, make sure there were ba
ck-ups, others to carry on. Dumbledore had died knowing that three people still knew about the Horcruxes; now Neville would take Harry\rquote s place: there would still be three in the secret.
\par \lquote Just in case they\rquote re \endash  busy \endash  and you get the chance \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Kill the snake?\rquote 
\par \lquote Kill the snake,\rquote  Harry repeated.
\par \lquote All right, Harry. You\rquote re OK, are you?\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote m fine. Thanks, Neville.\rquote 
\par But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on.
\par \lquote We\rquote re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Yeah, I \endash \rquote 
\par The suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence, he could not go on. Neville did not seem to find it strange. He patted Harry on the shoulder, released him, and walked away to look for more bodies.
\par Harry swung the Cloak back over himself and walked on. Someone else was moving not far away, stooping over another prone figure on the ground. He was feet away from her when he realised it was Ginny.
\par He stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a girl who was whispering for her mother.
\par \lquote It\rquote s all right,\rquote  Ginny was saying. \lquote It\rquote s OK. We\rquote re going to get you inside.\rquote 
\par \lquote But I want to go }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 home,\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 whispered the girl. \lquote I don\rquote 
t want to fight any more!\rquote 
\par \lquote I know,\rquote  said Ginny, and her voice broke. \lquote It\rquote s going to be all right.\rquote 
\par Ripples of cold undulated over Harry\rquote s skin. He wanted to shout out to the night, he wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he wanted her to know where he was going. He wanted to be stopped, to be dragged back, to be sent back home ...
\par But he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 home. Hogwarts was the first and best home he had known. He and Vol
demort and Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home here ...
\par Ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding her hand. With a huge effort, Harry forced himself on. He thought he saw Ginny look round as he passed and wondered whether she had sensed someone walking nearby, but he did not speak, and he did not
 look back.
\par Hagrid\rquote s hut loomed out of the darkness. There were no lights, no sound of Fang scrabbling at the door, his bark booming in welcome. All those visits to Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and 
his great, bearded face, and Ron vomiting slugs, and Hermione helping him save Norbert ...
\par He moved on, and now he reached the edge of the Forest, and he stopped.
\par A swarm of Dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could feel their chill, and he was not
 sure he would be able to pass safely through it. He had no strength left for a Patronus. He could no longer control his own trembling. It was not, after all, so easy to die. Every second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was 
s
o precious: to think that people had years and years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging to each second. At the same time he thought that he would not be able to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was ended, the Snitch ha
d been caught, it was time to leave the air ...
\par The Snitch. His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he pulled it out.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 I open at the close.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par Breathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now that he wanted time to move as slowly as possible, it seemed to have sped up, and understanding was coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed thought. This was the close. This was the moment.
\par He pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered, \lquote I am about to die.\rquote 
\par The metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised Draco\rquote s wand beneath the Cloak and murmured, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Lumos.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par The black stone with its jagged crack running down the centre sat in the two halves of the Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had cracked down the vertical line re
presenting the Elder Wand. The triangle and circle representing the Cloak and the stone were still discernible.
\par And again, Harry understood, without having to think. It did not matter about bringing them back, for he was about to join them. He was not really fetching them: they were fetching him.
\par He closed his eyes, and turned the stone over in his hand, three times.
\par He knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements around him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy, twig-strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the Forest. He opened his eyes and looked around.
\par They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They resembled most closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary, so long ago, and he had been me
mory made nearly solid. Less substantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they moved towards him, and on each face there was the same loving smile.
\par James was exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing the clothes in which he had died, and his hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses were a little lopsided, like Mr Weasley\rquote s.
\par Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry had seen him in life. He loped with an easy grace, his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face.
\par Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was thicker and darker. He looked happy to be back in this familiar place, scene of so many adolescent wanderings.
\par Lily\rquote s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as she drew close to him, and her green eyes, so like his, searched his face hungrily as though she would never be able to look at him enough.
\par \lquote You\rquote ve been so brave.\rquote 
\par He could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought that he would like to stand and look at her forever, and that would be enough.
\par \lquote You are nearly there,\rquote  said James. \lquote Very close. We are ... so proud of you.\rquote 
\par \lquote Does it hurt?\rquote 
\par The childish question had fallen from Harry\rquote s lips before he could stop it.
\par \lquote Dying? Not at all,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote Quicker and easier than falling asleep.\rquote 
\par \lquote And he will want it to be quick. He wants it over,\rquote  said Lupin.
\par \lquote I didn\rquote t want you to die,\rquote  Harry said. These words came without his volition. \lquote Any of you. I\rquote m sorry \endash \rquote 
\par He addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him.
\par \lquote \endash  right after you\rquote d had your son ... Remus, I\rquote m sorry \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I am sorry too,\rquote  said Lupin. \lquote Sorry I will never know him ... but he will know why I died and I hope he will understand. I was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life.\rquote 
\par A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the Forest lifted the hair at Harry\rquote s brow. He knew that they would not tell him to go, that it would have to be his decision.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll stay with me?\rquote 
\par \lquote Until the very end,\rquote  said James.
\par \lquote They won\rquote t be able to see you?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote We are part of you,\rquote  said Sirius. \lquote Invisible to anyone else.\rquote 
\par Harry looked at his mother.
\par \lquote Stay close to me,\rquote  he said quietly.
\par And he set off. The Dementors\rquote  chill did not overcome him; he passed through it with his companio
ns, and they acted like Patronuses to him, and together they marched through the old trees that grew closely together, their branches tangled, their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot. Harry clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the darkness, travelli
n
g deeper and deeper into the Forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that he would find him. Beside him, making scarcely a sound, walked James, Sirius, Lupin and Lily, and their presence was his courage, and the reason he was able to ke
ep putting one foot in front of the other.
\par His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs working without conscious instruction, as if he were passenger, not driver, in the body he was about to leave. The dead who walked beside him through the For
est were much more real to him now than the living back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped towards the end of his life, towards Voldemort ...
\par A thud and a whisper: some other living creature had stirred close by. Harry stopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening, and his mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too.
\par \lquote Someone there,\rquote  came a rough whisper close at hand. \lquote He\rquote s got an Invisibility Cloak. Could it be \endash ?\rquote 
\par Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree: their wands flared, and Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the dark\-ness, directly at the place Harry, his mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood. Apparently they could not see anything.
\par \lquote Definitely heard something,\rquote  said Yaxley. \lquote Animal, d\rquote you reckon?\rquote 
\par \lquote That headcase Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,\rquote  said Dolohov, glancing over his shoulder.
\par Yaxley looked down at his watch.
\par \lquote Time\rquote s nearly up. Potter\rquote s had his hour. He\rquote s not coming.\rquote 
\par \lquote And he was sure he\rquote d come! He won\rquote t be happy.\rquote 
\par \lquote Better go back,\rquote  said Yaxley. \lquote Find out what the plan is now.\rquote 
\par He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the Forest. Harry followed them, knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go. He glanced sideways, and his mother smiled at him, and his father nodded encouragement.
\par They had travelled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and Yaxley and Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where the monstrous Arag
og had once lived. The remnants of his vast web were there still, but the swarm of descendants he had spawned had been driven out by the Death Eaters, to fight for their cause.
\par A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light fell over
 a crowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of them were still masked and hooded, others showed their faces. Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting massive shadows over the scene, their faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock. Harr
y saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing his long nails; the great, blond Rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip. He saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension.
\par Every eye was fixed upon Voldemor
t, who stood with his head bowed, and his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have been praying, or else counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting i
n a game of hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo.
\par When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up.
\par \lquote No sign of him, my Lord,\rquote  said Dolohov.
\par Voldemort\rquote s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in the firelight. Slowly, he drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers.
\par \lquote My Lord \endash \rquote 
\par Bellatrix had spoken: she sat closest to Voldemort, dishevelled, her face a little bloody but otherwise unharmed.
\par Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak another word, but eyed him in worshipful fascination.
\par \lquote I thought he would come,\rquote  said Voldemort in his high, clear voice, his eyes on the leaping flames. \lquote I expected him to come.\rquote 
\par Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was now throwing itself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside. His hands were sweating as he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak 
and stuffed it beneath his robes, with his wand. He did not want to be tempted to fight.
\par \lquote I was, it seems ... mistaken,\rquote  said Voldemort.
\par \lquote You weren\rquote t.\rquote 
\par Harry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could muster: he did not want to sound afraid
. The Resurrection Stone slipped from between his numb fingers and out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents, Sirius and Lupin vanish as he stepped forwards into the firelight. At that moment he felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort. It was just 
the two of them.
\par The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared as the Death Eaters rose together, and there were many cries, gasps, even laughter. Voldemort had frozen where he stood, but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared as Harr
y moved towards him, with nothing but the fire between them.
\par Then a voice yelled \endash 
\par \lquote HARRY! NO!\rquote 
\par He turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby. His massive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled, desperate.
\par \lquote NO! NO! HARRY, WHAT\rquote RE YEH \endash ?\rquote 
\par \lquote QUIET!\rquote  shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand Hagrid was silenced.
\par Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from Voldemort to Harry, her breast heaving. The only things that moved were the flames and the snake, coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind Voldemort\rquote s head.
\par Harry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made no attempt to draw it. He knew that the snake was too well protected, knew that if he managed to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses would
 hit him first. And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and now Voldemort tilted his head a little to the side, con\-sidering the boy standing before him, and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth.
\par \lquote Harry Potter,\rquote  he said, very softly. His voice might have been part of the spitting fire. \lquote The boy who lived.\rquote 
\par None of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting: everything was waiting. Hagrid was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips on his \endash 
\par Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one side, like a curious child, wondering what would happen if he proceeded. Harry looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it to happen now, quick
ly, while he could still stand, before he lost control, before he betrayed fear \endash 
\par He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was gone.

He lay face down, listening to the silence. He was perfectly alone. Nobody was watching. Nobody else was there. He was not perfectly sure that he was there himself.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \fi284\li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must exist, must be more
 than disembodied thought, because he was lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore, he had a sense of a touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too.
\par Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that he was n
aked. Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. In opening them, he discovered that he had eyes.
\par He lay in a bright mist, though it
 was not like mist he had ever experienced before. His surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapour; rather the cloudy vapour had not yet formed into surroundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply there, a f
lat, blank something on which to be.
\par He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not wearing glasses any more.
\par Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him: the small, soft thumpings of something that
 flapped, flailed and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive, shameful.
\par For the first time, he wished he were clothed.
\par Barely had the wish formed in his head, than robes appeared a short distance away. He took them and pulled them on: they were soft, clean and warm. It was extraordinary how they had appeared, just like that, the moment he had wanted them ...
\par He stood up, looking around. Was he in some gre
at Room of Requirement? The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A great, domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from som
ewhere close by in the mist ...
\par Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his eyes. A wide open space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear, domed glass ceiling. It was qu
ite empty. He was the only person there, except for \endash 
\par He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had the form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a sea
t where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, struggling for breath.
\par He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want to approach it. Nevertheless, he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. Soon h
e stood near enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like a coward. He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him.
\par \lquote You cannot help.\rquote 
\par He spun round. Albus Dumbledore was walking towards him, sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue.
\par \lquote Harry.\rquote  He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged. \lquote You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.\rquote 
\par Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay whi
mpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some distance away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into the other, staring at his old Headmaster\rquote s face. Dumbledore
\rquote s long, silver hair and beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked nose: everything was as he had remembered it. And yet ...
\par \lquote But you\rquote re dead,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Oh, yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore matter-of-factly.
\par \lquote Then ... I\rquote m dead too?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah,\rquote  said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. \lquote That is the question, isn\rquote t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.\rquote 
\par They looked at each other, the old man still beaming.
\par \lquote Not?\rquote  repeated Harry.
\par \lquote Not,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote But ...\rquote  Harry raised his hand instinctively towards the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. \lquote But I should have died \endash  I didn\rquote t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!\rquote 
\par \lquote And that,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote will, I think, have made all the difference.\rquote 
\par Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light, like fire: Harry had never seen the man so utterly, so palpably content.
\par \lquote Explain,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote But you already know,\rquote  said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs together.
\par \lquote I let him kill me,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Didn\rquote t I?\rquote 
\par \lquote You did,\rquote  said Dumbledore, nodding. \lquote Go on!\rquote 
\par \lquote So the part of his soul that was in me ...\rquote 
\par Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onwards, a broad smile of encouragement on his face.
\par \lquote ... has it gone?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh, yes!\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and completely your own, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote But then ...\rquote 
\par Harry glanced over his shoulder, to where the small, maimed creature trembled under the chair.
\par \lquote What is that, Professor?\rquote 
\par \lquote Something that is beyond either of our help,\rquote  said Dumbledore.
\par \lquote But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,\rquote  Harry started again, \lquote and nobody died for me this time \endash  how can I be alive?\rquote 
\par \lquote I think you know,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.\rquote 
\par Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature u
nder the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort.
\par \lquote He took my blood,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote Precisely!\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily\rquote s protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!\rquote 
\par \lquote I live ... while he lives? But I thought ... I thought it was the other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?\rquote 
\par He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonised creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again.
\par \lquote Are you sure we can\rquote t do anything?\rquote 
\par \lquote There is no help possible.\rquote 
\par \lquote Then explain ... more,\rquote  said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled.
\par \lquote You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he
 never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He l
eft more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived.
\par \lquote And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children\rquote s tales, of love, loyalty and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Nothing. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 That they all have a po
wer beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped.
\par \lquote He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His bod
y keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort\rquote s one last hope for himself.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.
\par \lquote And you knew this? You knew \endash  all along?\rquote 
\par \lquote I guessed. But my guesses have, usually, been good,\rquote  said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble.
\par \lquote There\rquote s more,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote There\rquote s more to it. Why did my wand break the wand he borrowed?\rquote 
\par \lquote As to that, I cannot be sure.\rquote 
\par \lquote Have a guess, then,\rquote  said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed.
\par \lquote What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is what 
I think happened, and it is unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted it or explained it to Voldemort.
\par \lquote Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother\rquote 
s sacrifice into himself. If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to touch 
your blood ... but then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all.
\par \lquote Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were join
ed in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was twin of his, had never expec
ted.
\par \lquote 
He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between
 those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters.
\par \lquote I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort\rquote s wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand reco
gnised him when he pursued you, recognised a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius\rquote 
s wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort\rquote s own deadly skill: what chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy\rquote s stand?\rquote 
\par \lquote But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?\rquote  asked Harry.
\par \lquote My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at
 Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only towards him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other ... though a good one, I am sure,\rquote  Dumbledore finished kindly.
\par Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things like time, here.
\par \lquote He killed me with your wand.\rquote 
\par \lquote He }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 failed }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 to kill you with my wand,\rquote  Dumbledore corrected Harry. 
\lquote I think we can agree that you are not dead \endash  though, of course,\rquote  he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, \lquote I do not minimise your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.\rquote 
\par \lquote I feel great at the moment, though,\rquote  said Harry, looking down at his clean, unblemished hands. \lquote Where are we, exactly?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, I was going to ask you that,\rquote  said Dumbledore, looking around. \lquote Where would you say that we are?\rquote 
\par Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he found that he had an answer ready to give.
\par \lquote It looks,\rquote  he said slowly, \lquote like King\rquote s Cross station. Except a lot cleaner, and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.\rquote 
\par \lquote King\rquote s Cross station!\rquote  Dumbledore was chuckling immoder\-ately. \lquote Good gracious, really?\rquote 
\par \lquote Well, where do you think we are?\rquote  asked Harry, a little defensively.
\par \lquote My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 your }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 party.\rquote 

\par Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating. He glared at him, then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location.
\par \lquote The Deathly Hallows,\rquote  he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from Dumbledore\rquote s face.
\par \lquote Ah, yes,\rquote  he said. He even looked a little worried.
\par \lquote Well?\rquote 
\par For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old man, much less. He looked, fleetingly, like a small boy caught in wrongdoing.
\par \lquote Can you forgive me?\rquote  he said. \lquote Can you forgive me for not trusting you? For not telling you? Harry,
 I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better man.\rquote 
\par \lquote What are you talking about?\rquote  asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore\rquote s tone, by the sudden tears in his eyes.
\par \lquote The Hallows, the Hallows,\rquote  murmured Dumbledore. \lquote A desperate man\rquote s dream!\rquote 
\par \lquote But they\rquote re real!\rquote 
\par \lquote Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,\rquote  said Dumbledore. \lquote And I was such a fool. But you know, don\rquote t you? I have no secrets from you any more. You know.\rquote 
\par \lquote What do I know?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes.
\par \lquote Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?\rquote 
\par \lquote Of course you were,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Of course \endash  how can you ask that? You never killed if you could avoid it!\rquote 
\par \lquote True, true,\rquote  said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seek\-ing reassurance. \lquote Yet I, too, sought a way to conquer death, Harry.\rquote 
\par \lquote Not the way he did,\rquote  said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the high vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumbledore from himself. \lquote Hallows, not Horcruxes.\rquote 
\par \lquote Hallows,\rquote  murmured Dumbledore, \lquote not Horcruxes. Precisely.\rquote 
\par There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no longer looked round.
\par \lquote Grindelwald was looking for them too?\rquote  he asked.
\par Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment, and nodded.
\par \lquote It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,\rquote  he said quietly. \lquote Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric\rquote 
s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died.\rquote 
\par \lquote So it\rquote s true?\rquote  asked Harry. \lquote All of it? The Peverell brothers \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote \endash  were the three brothers of the tale,\rquote  said Dumbledore, nodding. \lquote 
Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road ... I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death\rquote 
s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations.
\par \lquote The Cloak, as you know now, travelled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus\rquote s last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric\rquote s Hollow.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore smiled at Harry.
\par \lquote Me?\rquote 
\par \lquote You. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died. James had showed it
 to me just a few days previously. It explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, 
could not help taking a closer look ... It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect ... and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!\rquote 
\par His tone was unbearably bitter.
\par \lquote The Cloak wouldn\rquote t have helped them survive, though,\rquote  Harry said quickly. \lquote Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn\rquote t have made them curse-proof.\rquote 
\par \lquote True,\rquote  sighed Dumbledore. \lquote True.\rquote 
\par Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him.
\par \lquote So you\rquote d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yes,\rquote  said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry\rquote s eyes. \lquote You know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.\rquote 
\par \lquote But I don\rquote t despise you \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Then you should,\rquote  said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. \lquote You know the secret of my sister\rquote 
s ill-health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died in Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana.
\par \lquote I resented it, Harry.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking, now, over the top of Harry\rquote s head, into the distance.
\par \lquote I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory.
\par \lquote Do not misunderstand me,\rquote  he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again. \lquote 
I loved them. I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine.
\par \lquote So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then, of course, he came ...\rquote 
\par Dumbledore looked directly into Harry\rquote s eyes again.
\par \lquote Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution.
\par \lquote Oh,
 I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did
, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true.
\par \lquote And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection Stone \endash 
 to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders.
\par \lquote And the Cloak ... somehow, we ne
ver discussed the Cloak much, Harry. Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought that if we ever found it, it mig
ht be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean, invincible.
\par \lquote Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me.
\par \lquote And then ... you know what happened. Reality returned, in the form of my rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admira
ble brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth to seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow.
\par \lquote The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana ... after all my mother\rquote s care and caution ... lay dead upon the floor.
\rquote 
\par Dumbledore gave a little gasp, and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out, and was glad to find that he could touch him: he gripped his arm tightly, and Dumbledore gradually regained control.
\par \lquote Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams
 of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister and learn to live with my guilt, and my terrible grief, the price of my shame.
\par \lquote Years passed. There were rumours about him. They said h
e had procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister for Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.\rquote 
\par \lquote But you\rquote d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrimgeour!\rquote  burst out Harry.
\par \lquote Would I?\rquote  asked Dumbledore heavily. \lquote I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are tho
se who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.
\par \lquote I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You were the best \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote You are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him.
\par \lquote Oh, not death,\rquote  said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry\rquote s questioning look. \lquote 
Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skilful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the c
urse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: you would be right. Harry, I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow t
hat snuffed out her life.
\par \lquote I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until, finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could.
\par \lquote Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.\rquote 
\par Another silenc
e. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the Mirror of Erised, a
nd why Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry.
\par They sat in silence for a long time, and the whimperings of the creature behind them barely disturbed Harry any more.
\par At last he said, \lquote Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose.
\par \lquote They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that
 it is true. I would like to think he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends ... to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow \'85\rquote 
\par \lquote ... or maybe from breaking into your tomb?\rquote  suggested Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his eyes.
\par After another short pause, Harry said, \lquote You tried to use the Resurrection Stone.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore nodded.
\par \lquote When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the Gaunts, the Hallow I had craved most of all \endash  though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons \endash 
 I lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was ab
out to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry I was ...
\par \lquote I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years, I had learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final proof.\rquote 
\par \lquote Why?\rquote  said Harry. \lquote It was natural! You wanted to see them again. What\rquote s wrong with that?\rquote 
\par \lquote Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own 
the Elder Wand, and not to boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to tame and to use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it.
\par \lquote But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiosity, and so it could never have worked for me as i
t works for you, its true owner. The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than to enable my self-sacrifice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore patted Harry\rquote s hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; he could not help himself. How could he remain angry with Dumbledore now?
\par \lquote Why did you have to make it so difficult?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore\rquote s smile was tremulous.
\par \lquote I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was af
raid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I want
ed you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.\rquote 
\par \lquote And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?\rquote 
\par \lquote I do not think so, because he did not recognise the Resurrec\-tion Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first. He would not t
hink that he needed the Cloak, and, as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.\rquote 
\par \lquote But you expected him to go after the wand?\rquote 
\par \lquote I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort\rquote 
s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed
 wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other.
 For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus ...\rquote 
\par \lquote If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn\rquote t you?\rquote 
\par \lquote I admit that was my intention,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote but it did not work as I intended, did it?\rquote 
\par \lquote No,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote That bit didn\rquote t work out.\rquote 
\par The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sat without talking for the longest time yet. The realisation of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes, like softly falling snow.
\par \lquote I\rquote ve got to go back, haven\rquote t I?\rquote 
\par \lquote That is up to you.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ve got a choice?\rquote 
\par \lquote Oh yes.\rquote  Dumbledore smiled at him. \lquote We are in King\rquote s Cross, you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to ... let\rquote s say ... board a train.\rquote 
\par \lquote And where would it take me?\rquote 
\par \lquote On,\rquote  said Dumbledore simply.
\par Silence again.
\par \lquote Voldemort\rquote s got the Elder Wand.\rquote 
\par \lquote True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.\rquote 
\par \lquote But you want me to go back?\rquote 
\par \lquote I think,\rquote  said Dumbledore, \lquote that if you choose to return, there is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.\rquote 
\par Harry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair.
\par \lquote Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love. By returni
ng, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy goal, then we say goodbye for the present.\rquote 
\par Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the Forest had 
been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long moment into each other\rquote s faces.
\par \lquote Tell me one last thing,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?\rquote 
\par Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry\rquote s ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure.
\par \lquote Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?\rquote

He was lying face down on the ground again. The smell of the Forest filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold hard ground beneath his ch
eek, and the hinge of his glasses, which had been knocked sideways by the fall, cutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, and the place where the Killing Curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did not stir, but remained e

pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, stuffed out of sight.

\par \lquote That will do,\rquote  said Voldemort\rquote s voice.
\par More footsteps: several people were backing away from the same spot. Desperate to see what was happening, and why, Harry opened his eyes by a millimetre.
\par Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were hurrying away from him, returning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside Voldemort.
\par Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters had been huddled round Voldemort, who seemed to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened when he had hit
 Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort, too, collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them had fallen briefly unconscious and both of them had now returned ...
\par \lquote My Lord, let me \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote I do not require assistance,\rquote  said Voldemort coldly, and though he could not see it, Harry pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. \lquote The boy ... is he dead?\rquote 
\par There was complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry, but he felt their concentrated gaze, it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch.
\par \lquote You,\rquote  said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shriek of pain. \lquote Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.\rquote 
\par Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there, with his heart thu
mping traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the same time noting, small comfort though it was, that Voldemort was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan ...
\par Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry\rquote s face, pulled back an eyelid, crept beneath his shirt, down to his chest and felt his heart. He could hear the woman\rquote

\par Harry had been expecting it: knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the Forest floor, it must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemort\rquote 
s victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet the pain he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air: his glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide 
a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell to the ground for the last time the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter.
\par \lquote Now,\rquote  said Voldemort, \lquote we go to the castle, and show them what has become of their hero. Who shall drag the body? No \endash  Wait \endash \rquote 
\par There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments Harry felt the ground trembling beneath him.
\par \lquote You carry him,\rquote  Voldemort said. \lquote He will be nice and visible in your arms, will he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the glasses \endash  put on the glasses \endash  he must be recognisable.\rquote 
\par Someone slammed Harry\rquote s glasses back on to his face with deliberate force, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid\rquote 
s arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs, great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost.
\par \lquote Move,\rquote  said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forwards, forcing his way through the close-growing trees, back through the Forest. Branches caught at Harry\rquote 
s hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed nec
k of Harry Potter ...
\par The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed; they made so much din that birds rose, shrieking, into the sky and even the jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. The 
victorious procession marched on towards the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin.
\par \lquote BANE!\rquote 
\par Hagrid\rquote s unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry\rquote s eyes open. \lquote Happy now, are yeh, that yeh didn\rquote  fight, yeh cowardly bunch o\rquote  nags? Are yeh happy Harry Potter\rquote s \endash  d \endash  dead ...?\rquote 
\par Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their proces\-sion pass; he 
dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by a freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge of the Forest.
\par \lquote Stop.\rquote 
\par Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort\rquote 
s command, because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them where they stood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the Dementors that patrolled the outer trees. They would not affect him now. The fact of 
his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his father\rquote s stag kept guardian in his heart.
\par Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort himself because he spoke a moment later, his voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the grounds, crashing upon Harry\rquote s eardrums.
\par \lquote Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone.
\par \lquote The battle is wo
n. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters outnumber you and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of
 the castle, now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will live, and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build together.\rquote 
\par There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so close to him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again.
\par \lquote Come,\rquote  said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was forced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw Voldemort striding in front of them, wearing
 the great snake Nagini around his shoulders, who was now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters who marched on either side of them through the sl
owly lightening darkness ...
\par \lquote Harry,\rquote  sobbed Hagrid. \lquote Oh, Harry ... Harry ...\rquote 
\par Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within.
\par \lquote Stop.\rquote 
\par The Death Eaters came to a halt: Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the open front doors of the school. He could see, even through his closed lids, the reddish glow that meant light stream
ed upon him from the Entrance Hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom he had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid\rquote s arms.
\par \lquote NO!\rquote 
\par The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that Professor McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard another woman laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall\rquote 
s despair. He squinted again, for a single second, and saw the open doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out on to the front steps, to face their vanquishers, and see the truth of Harry\rquote 
s death for themselves. He saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini\rquote s head with a single white finger. He closed his eyes again.

\par Ron, Hermione and Ginny\rquote s voices were worse than McGonagall\rquote

\par \lquote SILENCE!\rquote  cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, and silence was forced upon them all. \lquote It is over! Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!\rquote 
\par Harry felt himself lowered on to the grass.
\par \lquote You see?\rquote  said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding back\-wards and forwards right beside the place where he lay. \lquote 
Harry Potter is dead! Do you understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!\rquote 
\par \lquote He beat you!\rquote  yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more.
\par \lquote He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,\rquote  said Voldemort, and there was relish in his voice for the lie, \lquote killed while trying to save himself \endash \rquote 
\par But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a flash of light and a grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort: Harry saw the figure hit the gr
ound, Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the challenger\rquote s wand aside and laughing.
\par \lquote And who is this?\rquote  he said, in his soft snake\rquote s hiss. \lquote Who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost?\rquote 
\par Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh.
\par \lquote It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?\rquote 
\par \lquote Ah, yes, I remember,\rquote  said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unprotected, standing in the no-man\rquote s-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters. \lquote 
But you are a pure-blood, aren\rquote t you, my brave boy?\rquote  Voldemort asked Neville, who stood facing him, his empty hands curled in fists.
\par \lquote So what if I am?\rquote  said Neville loudly.
\par \lquote You show spirit, and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom.\rquote 
\par \lquote I\rquote ll join you when hell freezes over,\rquote  said Neville. \lquote Dumbledore\rquote s Army!\rquote  he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort\rquote s silencing charms seemed unable to hold.
\par \lquote Very well,\rquote  said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. \lquote If that is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On your head,\rquote  he said quietly, 
\lquote be it.\rquote 
\par Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of one of the castle\rquote s shattered win\-dows, something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half-light and landed in Voldemort\rquote 
s hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled, empty and ragged: the Sorting Hat.
\par \lquote There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,\rquote  said Voldemort. \lquote There will be no more houses. The emblem, shield and colours of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for everyone, won\rquote 
t they, Neville Longbottom?\rquote 
\par He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the Hat on to Neville\rquote s head, so that it slipped down below his eyes. There
 were movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, holding the fighters of Hogwarts at bay.
\par \lquote Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me,\rquote  said Voldemort, and with a flick of his wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames.
\par Screams split the dawn, and Neville was aflame, rooted to the spot, unable to move, and Harry could not bear it: he must act \endash 
\par And then many things happened at the same moment.
\par They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted towards the castle, uttering loud war cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering r
ound the side of the castle and yelled, \lquote HAGGER!\rquote  His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort\rquote 
s giants: they ran at Grawp like bull elephants, making the earth quake. Then came hooves, and the twangs of bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the D
eath Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak from inside his robes, swung it over himself and sprang to his feet, as Neville moved too.
\par In one swift, fluid motion Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him; the flaming Hat fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle \endash 
\par The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd, or the sounds of the clashing giants, or of the stampeding centaurs, and yet it seemed to draw every eye. With a single stroke, Neville sliced off the great snake
\rquote s head, which spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the Entrance Hall, and Voldemort\rquote s mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake\rquote s body thudded to the ground at his feet \endash 

\par Hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville and Voldemort before the latter could raise his wand. Then, over the screams, and the roars, and the thunderous stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid\rquote 
s yell came loudest of all.
\par \lquote HARRY!\rquote  Hagrid shouted, \lquote HARRY \endash  WHERE\rquote S HARRY?\rquote 
\par Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone was fleeing the giants\rquote  stamping feet, and nea
rer and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where; Harry saw great winged creatures soaring around the heads of Voldemort\rquote 
s giants, Thestrals and Buckbeak the Hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and pummelled them; and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Voldemort\rquote 
s Death Eaters alike, were being forced back into the castle. Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd.
\par Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffeted into the Entrance Hall: he was searching for Voldemort and saw him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed into the Great
 Hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort\rquote 
s would-be victims, Seamus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it.
\par And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasley overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emerald pyjamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what lo
oked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight, along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan and Magorian burst into the Hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the d
oor that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges.
\par The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the Entrance Hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleavers, and at their head, the locket of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog\rquote s voice audible even above this din: 
\lquote Fight! Fight! Fight for my master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!\rquote 
\par They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters, their tiny faces ali
ve with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde.

\par But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duellers, past struggling prisoners, and into the Great Hall.
\par Voldemort was in the centre of the battle, and he was striking and smiting all within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer,
 still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded, as everyone who could walk forced their way inside.
\par Harry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick\rquote s hands, saw Walden Macnair th
rown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback, Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy runnin
g through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son.
\par Voldemort was now duelling McGonagall, Slughorn and Kingsley all at once, and there was cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him \endash 
\par Bellatrix was still fighting too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her master she duelled three at once: Hermione, Ginny and Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them, and Harry\rquote 
s attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed death by an inch \endash 
\par He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways.
\par \lquote NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!\rquote 
\par Mrs Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms. Bellatrix spun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of her new challenger.
\par \lquote OUT OF MY WAY!\rquote  shouted Mrs Weasley to the three girls, and with a swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley\rquote s wand slashed and twirled, and Bellatrix Lestrange\rquote 
s smile faltered, and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the witches\rquote  feet became hot and cracked; both women were fighting to kill.
\par \lquote No!\rquote  Mrs Weasley cried, as a few students ran forwards, trying to come to her aid. \lquote Get back! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 Get back! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 She is mine!\rquote 
\par Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both, 
wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent.
\par \lquote What will happen to your children when I\rquote ve killed you?\rquote  taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly\rquote s curses danced around her. \lquote When Mummy\rquote s gone the same way as Freddie?\rquote 
\par \lquote You \endash  will \endash  never \endash  touch \endash  our \endash  children \endash  again!\rquote  screamed Mrs Weasley.
\par Bellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backwards through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did.
\par Molly\rquote s curse soared beneath Bellatrix\rquote s outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart.
\par Bellatrix\rquote s gloating smile froze, her eyes seemed to bulge: for the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed.
\par Harry felt as though he turned in slow motion; he saw McGonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn blasted backwards, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort\rquote s fury at the
 fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb. Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Protego!\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\par The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of \lquote Harry!\rquote  \lquote HE\rquote S ALIVE!\rquote  were stifled at once. The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each
 other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t want anyone else to try to help,\rquote  Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call. \lquote It\rquote s got to be like this. It\rquote s got to be me.\rquote 
\par Voldemort hissed.
\par \lquote Potter doesn\rquote t mean that,\rquote  he said, his red eyes wide. \lquote That isn\rquote t how he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?\rquote 
\par \lquote Nobody,\rquote  said Harry simply. \lquote There are no more Horcruxes. It\rquote s just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good \'85\rquote 
\par \lquote One of us?\rquote  jeered Voldemort, and his whole body was taut and his red eyes stared, a snake that was about to strike. \lquote You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dum
bledore was pulling the strings?\rquote 
\par \lquote Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?\rquote  asked Harry. They were still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and for Harry no face existed but Voldemort\rquote s.

\par \lquote I believe both,\rquote

\par Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart.
\par \lquote Snape\rquote s Patronus was a doe,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote the same as my mother\rquote s, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realised,\rquote  he said, as he saw Voldemort
\rquote s nostrils flare, \lquote he asked you to spare her life, didn\rquote t he?\rquote 
\par \lquote He desired her, that was all,\rquote  sneered Voldemort, \lquote but when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him \endash \rquote 
\par \lquote Of course he told you that,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote but he was Dumbledore\rquote s spy from the moment you threatened her, and he\rquote s been working against you ever since! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him!\rquote 

\par \lquote It matters not!\rquote  shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. \lquote It matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore\rquote

\par \lquote What is this?\rquote 
\par Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten.
\par \lquote It\rquote s your one last chance,\rquote  said Harry, \lquote it\rquote s all you\rquote ve got left ... I\rquote ve seen what you\rquote ll be otherwise ... be a man ... try ... try for some remorse ...\rquote 
\par \lquote You dare \endash ?\rquote  said Voldemort again.

\par Voldemort\rquote s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand and Harry gripped Draco\rquote s very tightly. The moment, he knew, was seconds away.
\par \lquote That wand still isn\rquote t working properly for you, because you murdered the wrong person. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore.\rquote

\par Voldemort\rquote s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face.
\par \lquote The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.\rquote 
\par Blank shock showed in Voldemort\rquote s face for a moment, but then it was gone.
\par \lquote But what does it matter?\rquote  he said softly. \lquote Eve

\par \lquote But you\rquote re too late,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote You\rquote ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took this wand from him.\rquote 
\par Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it.
\par \lquote So it all comes down to this, doesn\rquote t it?\rquote  whispered Harry. \lquote Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does ... I am the true master of the Elder Wand.\rquote 
\par A red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them, as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort\rquote 
s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he, too, yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco\rquote s wand:

\par The bang was like a cannon-blast and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead centre of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort\rquote 
s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise,
 spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air towards the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his fre
e hand as Voldemort fell back\-
wards, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upwards. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snake-like face vacant and unknowing. Voldemor
t was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy\rquote s shell.
\par One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment sus\-pended: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and th
e cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered towards him, and the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incompre\-
hensible shouts 
that deafened him. Then Ginny, Neville and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling
 him, trying to hug some part of him, hun\-dreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last \endash 
\par The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was an indispe
nsable part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their saviour and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of th
e
m, seemed to occur to no one. He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every quarter, as the morning drew on, that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back 
to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister for Magic ...
\par They moved Voldemort\rquote s body and laid it
 in a chamber off the Hall, away from the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey and fifty others who had died fighting him. McGonagall had replaced the house tables, but nobody was sitting according to house any more: all were jumbled together, teac
h
ers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering in a corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found hi
mself sitting on a bench beside Luna.
\par \lquote I\rquote d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,\rquote  she said.
\par \lquote I\rquote d love some,\rquote  he replied.
\par \lquote I\rquote ll distract them all,\rquote  she said. \lquote Use your Cloak.\rquote 
\par And before he could say a word she had cried, \lquote Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!\rquote  and pointed out of the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet.
\par Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother\rquote 
s shoulder: there would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tab
les he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked he saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose co
mpany he craved most.
\par \lquote It\rquote s me,\rquote  he muttered, crouching down between them. \lquote Will you come with me?\rquote 
\par They stood up at once, and together he, Ron and Hermione left the Great Hall. Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains occurred every few steps as they climbed.
\par Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition:

fled by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had st
u
ck with him for so long, and who deserved the truth. Painstakingly, he recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the Forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the pl
ace to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination.
\par Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the Headmaster\rquote s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore.
\par \lquote Can we go up?\rquote  he asked the gargoyle.
\par \lquote Feel free,\rquote  groaned the statue.
\par They clambered over him and on to the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upwards like an escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top.
\par He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it, and then an ear-splitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort \endash 
\par But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached through their frames to grip each other\rquote 
s hands; they danced up and down on the chairs in which they had been painted; Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly, Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Nigellus called, in his high, reedy voice, \lquote 
And let it be noted that Slytherin house played its part! Let our contribution not be forgotten!\rquote 
\par But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the Headmaster\rquote s chair. Tears were sliding down from behind the half-moon spectacles into the long silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating
 from him filled Harry with the same balm as phoenix song.
\par At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respect\-fully silent, beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, and
 chose them with enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed though he was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last piece of advice.
\par \lquote The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,\rquote  he began, \lquote I dropped it in the Forest. I don\rquote t know exactly where, but I\rquote m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree?\rquote 
\par \lquote My dear boy, I do,\rquote  said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious. \lquote A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone else know where it fell?\rquote 
\par \lquote No one,\rquote  said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction.
\par \lquote I\rquote m going to keep Ignotus\rquote s present, though,\rquote  said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed.
\par \lquote But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!\rquote 
\par \lquote And then there\rquote s this.\rquote 
\par Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see.
\par \lquote I don\rquote t want it,\rquote  said Harry.
\par \lquote What?\rquote  said Ron loudly. \lquote Are you mental?\rquote 
\par \lquote I know it\rquote s powerful,\rquote  said Harry wearily. \lquote But I was happier with mine. So ...\rquote 
\par He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two hal
ves of holly still, just, connected by the finest thread of phoenix feather. Hermione had said that they could not be repaired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if this did not work, nothing would.
\par He laid the broken wand upon the Headmaster\rquote s desk, touched it with the very tip of the Elder Wand and said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 \lquote Reparo.\rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 
\par As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he had succeeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand, and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion.
\par \lquote I\rquote m putting the Elder Wand,\rquote  he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration, \lquote back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won
\rquote t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That\rquote ll be the end of it.\rquote 
\par Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other.
\par \lquote Are you sure?\rquote  said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand.
\par \lquote I think Harry\rquote s right,\rquote  said Hermione quietly.
\par \lquote That wand\rquote s more trouble than it\rquote s worth,\rquote  said Harry. \lquote And quite honestly,\rquote  he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Towe

\par But James caught his mother\rquote 
s eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished.
\par \lquote You\rquote ll write to me, won\rquote t you?\rquote  Albus asked his parents immediately, capitalising on the momentary absence of his brother.
\par \lquote Every day, if you want us to,\rquote  said Ginny.

\par \lquote We wrote to James three times a week last year,\rquote  said Ginny.
\par \lquote And you don\rquote t want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,\rquote  Harry put in. \lquote He likes a laugh, your brother.\rquote 
\par Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forwards, gathering speed. As they re
ached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged on to platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick, white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming throu
gh the mist, into which James had already disappeared.
\par \lquote Where are they?\rquote  asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform.
\par \lquote We\rquote ll find them,\rquote  said Ginny reassuringly.
\par But the vapour was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody\rquote 
s faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud. Harry thought he heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello ...
\par \lquote I think that\rquote s them, Al,\rquote  said Ginny suddenly.
\par A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily and Albus had drawn right up to them.
\par \lquote Hi,\rquote  said Albus, sounding immensely relieved.
\par Rose, who was already wearing her brand new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him.
\par \lquote Parked all right, then?\rquote  Ron asked Harry. \lquote I did. Hermione didn\rquote t believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I\rquote d have to Confund the examiner.\rquote

 Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus\rquote s trunk and owl on to the train. \lquote I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let\rquote s face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.\rquote 
\par Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose\rquote s younger brother, having an animated discussion about which house they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts.
\par \lquote If you\rquote re not in Gryffindor, we\rquote ll disinherit you,\rquote  said Ron, \lquote but no pressure.\rquote

\par Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn.
\par \lquote He doesn\rquote t mean it,\rquote  said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention. Catching Harry\rquote s eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yard
s away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist.
\par \lquote Look who it is.\rquote 
\par Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, wh
ich emphasised the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly and turned away again.
\par \lquote So that\rquote s little Scorpius,\rquote  said Ron under his breath. \lquote Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother\rquote s brains.\rquote 
\par \lquote Ron, for heaven\rquote s sake,\rquote  said Hermione, half-stern, half-amused. \lquote Don\rquote t try to turn them against each other before they\rquote ve even started school!\rquote 
\par \lquote You\rquote re right, sorry,\rquote  said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, \lquote don\rquote t get }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 too }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0

\par James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news.

\par \lquote Thestrals are nothing to worry about,\rquote  Harry told Albus. \lquote They\rquote re gentle things, there\rquote s nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won\rquote t be going up to school in the carriages, you\rquote ll be going in the boats.
\rquote 
\par Ginny kissed Albus goodbye.
\par \lquote See you at Christmas.\rquote 
\par \lquote Bye, Al,\rquote  said Harry, as his son hugged him. \lquote Don\rquote t forget Hagrid\rquote s invited you to tea next Friday. Don\rquote t mess with Peeves. Don\rquote t duel anyone \rquote til you\rquote ve learned how. And don\rquote

\par \lquote What if I\rquote m in Slytherin?\rquote 
\par The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was.
\par Harry crouched down so that Albus\rquote s face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry\rquote s three children, Albus had inherited Lily\rquote s eyes.
\par \lquote Albus Severus,\rquote  Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, \lquote 
you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.\rquote 
\par \lquote But }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 just say \endash \rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\par \lquote Really?\rquote 
\par \lquote It did for me,\rquote  said Harry.
\par He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus\rquote s face when he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents were swar
ming forwards for final kisses, last-minute reminders. Albus jumped into the carriage and Ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward
s Harry.
\par \lquote Why are they all }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640 staring?\rquote  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af37 \ltrch\fcs0 \f37\lang2057\langfe3081\langnp2057\insrsid9652640

\par \lquote Don\rquote t let it worry you,\rquote  said Ron. \lquote It\rquote s me. I\rquote m extremely famous.\rquote 
\par Albus, Rose, Hugo and Lily laughed. The train began to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son\rquote 
s thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling, and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away from him ...
\par The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry\rquote s hand was still raised in farewell.
\par \lquote He\rquote ll be all right,\rquote  murmured Ginny.
\par As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absent-mindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead.
\par \lquote I know he will.\rquote 
\par The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.
