    <p>In this long-awaited new novel in The Halfblood Chronicles, fantasy greats Norton and Lackey tell the enthralling story of the reclusive elvenlord Kyrtian, who emerges as a hero in a world torn by politics and war. When his cousin, Aelmarkin, tries to prove that Kyrtian is unfit to run his estate, the plan backfires, and soon Kyrtian, who doesn't share the venal, greedy nature of his cousin, finds himself with more power than he ever wanted.</p>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Like his father before him, Kyrtian has always treated the humans on his estate like servants, instead of enslaving them as other elvenlords do. His father's legacy also leads Kyrtian to learn ancient military skills long since lost to elvenkind through the carelessness of the elvenlords. Kyrtian's rediscovered knowledge piques the interest of the current elvenlords, and soon Kyrtian finds himself appointed the new commander of the army, to the relief of his ruling peers.</p>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>For the sons of the most powerful elvenlords, the Young Lords, have rebelled against their fathers and are waging war. But by taking advantage of both the privileges of his new command and the help of some unexpected new friends, Kyrtian finally gains the resources to embark on his own, personal quest--resuming his father's search for the Great Portal, the magical doorway through which the original elvenlords entered this world.</p>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>As war rages between some sons and fathers, Kyrtian searches desperately for his own lost father, hoping to uncover not only the mystery of his disappearance, but also the secret behind the origin of elvenkind.</p>

   <p>    V'kel Lyon Lord Kyndreth sto­od up, and lo­omed over the Co­un­cil tab­le and the Co­un­ci­lors se­ated the­re. Most of his fel­low El­ven­lords wo­uld not me­et his eyes; tho­se that did so sha­red a cong­ra­tu­la­tory glan­ce with him. The Co­un­cil Cham­ber was not a com­for­tab­le pla­ce to­day, and he had en­su­red-with a few or­ders to the sla­ves who had pre­pa­red it- that it wo­uld re­ma­in so. Cold. Dim. The cus­hi­ons on the se­ats po­un­ded flat. And even the ref­resh­ments we­re ill-ser­ved-at a uni­form tem­pe­ra­tu­re that co­uld only be desc­ri­bed as "te­pid." All to ke­ep ever­yo­ne he­re wis­hing he was el­sew­he­re, and less than ple­ased with the one-not Lord Kyndreth-who was no­mi­nal­ly in char­ge.</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth's star was in the as­cen­dant on­ce aga­in, and this ti­me he wo­uld see to it that it did not fall a se­cond ti­me.</p>
   <p>    "How is it," he as­ked, to empty air, "that a re­bel­li­o­us pack of child­ren and for­mer sla­ves ha­ve ma­na­ged to hold off our al­le­gedly well-tra­ined, well-led and well-sup­pli­ed ar­mi­es? And ha­ve do­ne so for long eno­ugh that pe­op­le are be­gin­ning to call this-tem­per tant­rum-the Yo­ung Lords' Re­bel­li­on?"</p>
   <p>    "Lord Kyndreth-" ven­tu­red V'kel Ans­ter Lord Rec­han, scramb­ling migh­tily for the up­per hand he had-if he had only known it-just lost, "this is, exactly as you say, no mo­re than a tem­per tant­rum. In­con­se­qu­en­ti­al. No mo­re than a hand­ful of es­ta­tes ha­ve be­en lost, our sup­pli­es con­ti­nue to mo­ve wit­ho­ut mo­re than the oc­ca­si­onal am­bush, the­re is no mo­re than a trick­le of sla­ves es­ca­ping, and our li­ves con­ti­nue as they al­ways ha­ve. In ba­lan­ce, the thre­at-"</p>
   <p>    "A trick­le he­re, a loss the­re, the comp­le­te ina­bi­lity of our so-cal­led 'invin­cib­le' army to bring our own of­fsp­ring to he­el, and you say it's in­con­se­qu­en­ti­al?" Lord Kyndreth ro­ared, and had the sa­tis­fac­ti­on of se­e­ing his chi­ef op­po­nent win­ce. "By the An­ces­tors, you fo­ol, can't you see that a so-cal­led 'trick­le' is all that is ne­eded to ble­ed us to de­ath?" Kyndreth saw with so­me sa­tis­fac­ti­on a subt­le and uns­po­ken shif­ting among the ot­her Co­un­cil mem­bers, and watc­hed as po­wer ca­me over to his si­de. "And what, may I ask, do you pro­po­se to do if the­se so-cal­led 'errant child­ren' of ours de­ci­de to ally with the El­ven­ba­ne and her wi­zards and dra­gons?"</p>
   <p>    There. It was out in the open, the thing that no one had da­red to say, and he watc­hed as a chill pas­sed over all the rest of them. Yes, even Lord Rec­han.</p>
   <p>    "They wo­uldn't-" so­me­one whis­pe­red.</p>
   <p>    "Don't ever be­li­eve that," one of Kyndreth's sup­por­ters sa­id, sharply. He to­ok no­te of the spe­aker and re­min­ded him­self to sing­le that one out for so­me spe­ci­al fa­vor. "Why sho­uldn't they?"</p>
   <p>    "Because-because-because they're El­ven­lords!" the first lord splut­te­red, lo­oking so hor­ri­fi­ed by the very no­ti­on that one wo­uld think he'd be­en ac­cu­sed of fat­he­ring halfb­lo­oded child­ren him­self.</p>
   <p>    "And when wha­te­ver ma­gic they've dis­co­ve­red ce­ases to pre­vent our ma­gic from re­ac­hing and pu­nis­hing them?" Lord Kyndreth as­ked. "What then? Do you think, do you re­al­ly think that they will he­si­ta­te for one mo­ment be­fo­re go­ing over to the half-blo­od si­de?"</p>
   <p>    Silence.</p>
   <p>    "Now," Kyndreth sa­id, in­to that si­len­ce, chan­ging his vo­ice from chal­len­ging to calm, "I ha­ve so­me sug­ges­ti­ons. The first of which is one I think no­ne of you will an­ti­ci­pa­te. I sug­gest that we con­ti­nue to al­low our lo­yal of­fsp­ring to con­ti­nue the­ir li­ves as usu­al. I do not pro­po­se in­ter­fe­ring with the­ir ple­asu­res. In fact, if anyt­hing, I sug­gest a slightly lo­oser le­ash for now. And you may well be as­king yo­ur­self why-"</p>
   <p>    "Well-yes," rep­li­ed Lord Rec­han, lo­oking gra­tif­yingly puz­zled. "If, as you say, the in­ro­ads are slowly ble­eding us to de­ath-"</p>
   <p>    "Firstly, we don't want the brats to know it's ble­eding us to de­ath, and rest as­su­red, they must ha­ve ears and eyes among us, and it's pro­bably so­me of our ap­pa­rently-lo­yal child­ren. Se­condly, we want to re­mind our ap­pa­rently-lo­yal child­ren just how ple­asant li­fe is, when one's si­re is ple­ased with one." He smi­led, slightly. "It is easi­er to catch a fly with a swe­et­me­at than with vi­ne­gar. And me­anw­hi­le-" his eyes nar­ro­wed. "-I will be a-hun­ting for a bet­ter com­man­der."</p>
   <p>    And to his im­men­se sa­tis­fac­ti­on, the­re was not one sing­le obj­ec­ti­on.</p>

   <p>    V'kel Ael­mar­kin er-Lord Tor­nal smi­led down at the sla­ve who res­ted her pa­le-tres­sed he­ad on his knee. She was his cur­rent per­so­nal fa­vo­ri­te, a de­li­ca­te yo­ung hu­man fe­ma­le nest­led trus­tingly aga­inst his leg. Her thin, fi­ne-bo­ned fa­ce and por­ce­la­in comp­le­xi­on ple­ased him with the­ir flaw­less symmetry and per­fec­ti­on. She re­tur­ned his smi­le shyly, yet with a to­uch of the co­qu­et­te, her ro­und, blue eyes ref­lec­ting her cal­low, un­sop­his­ti­ca­ted na­tu­re. No re­bel­li­o­us tho­ughts dwel­ling in that nar­row skull-in fact, he wo­uld be surp­ri­sed if she ma­na­ged to co­nj­ure up mo­re than one or two tho­ughts of any kind in an ave­ra­ge day! Her pe­dig­ree was im­ma­cu­la­te, out of a long li­ne of ca­re­ful­ly cho­sen sla­ves fa­med for the­ir be­a­uty and de­li­cacy to be not­hing mo­re comp­li­ca­ted than any ot­her or­na­men­tal obj­ect.</p>
   <p>    He sig­hed with con­tent­ment, and smo­ot­hed the pa­le gold, sil­ken ha­ir away from her brow with a gent­le ca­ress. She was ex­qu­isi­te; lo­vely, eager to ple­ase, pli­ant, gra­ce­ful, in­no­cent and inc­re­dibly easy to ma­ni­pu­la­te. Exactly the sort of sla­ve that ga­ve him the most ple­asu­re. He ca­re­ful­ly cul­ti­va­ted that in­no­cen­ce, and no­ne of his ot­her sla­ves wo­uld da­re his wrath by spo­iling that na­ive­te. No ta­les of flog­gings or mo­re ext­re­me pu­nish­ments, no ha­rem-sto­ri­es of his ot­her "fa­vo­ri­tes" and what had be­co­me of them-not­hing to hint that he had as­pects she had ne­ver ex­pe­ri­en­ced. So far as she was con­cer­ned, he was the gent­le, lo­ving, ever-kind mas­ter that she be­li­eved him to be.</p>
   <p>    He tur­ned his at­ten­ti­on back to his most im­por­tant gu­est. "The­re, you see?" he sa­id, ges­tu­ring ex­pan­si­vely to the hall be­fo­re them and its ra­uco­us oc­cu­pants. "Did I not pro­mi­se you wo­uld be far mo­re amu­sed he­re than in dan­cing at­ten­dan­ce on all the dull, ho­pe­ful ma­idens at yo­ur fat­her's fe­te?"</p>
   <p>    Elvenlord Ael­mar­kin did not pos­sess eno­ugh ma­gic to cre­ate a fan­ci­ful il­lu­si­on in his Gre­at Hall, so the lu­xu­ri­o­us sur­ro­un­dings he­re we­re all qu­ite re­al; gu­ests at his en­ter­ta­in­ments wo­uld al­ways find them­sel­ves in the sa­me opu­lent ro­om that they had gra­ced at the last en­ter­ta­in­ment, rat­her than a new and exo­tic set­ting vastly dif­fe­rent from the­ir last. He ma­de up for the lack of no­vel sur­ro­un­dings by the la­vish­ness of his en­ter­ta­ining, which had be­gun to earn him so­met­hing of a re­pu­ta­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Take this ro­om, for examp­le: for­tu­na­tely it had be­en be­a­uti­ful­ly const­ruc­ted in the first pla­ce, and he had only ne­eded to em­bel­lish it when it ca­me in­to his pos­ses­si­on. The north and so­uth walls we­re mostly of glass-north­wards lay a na­tu­ral la­ke, art­ful­ly lands­ca­ped, and so­uth­wards we­re the ple­asu­re-gar­dens. The east and west walls, pa­ne­led in wo­od ble­ac­hed to sil­ver, held sil­ver-rim­med do­ors that led to the rest of the ma­nor. The ce­iling with its ble­ac­hed-wo­od be­ams from which hung gre­at sil­ver fan­ta­si­es of lights, crystals, tiny glass sculp­tu­res and sil­ver fi­lig­ree, al­so bo­as­ted vast trans­pa­rent skylights; just now the ref­lec­ti­on of the myri­ad lights ma­de it im­pos­sib­le to see anyt­hing of the out­si­de world, but la­ter, when the lights we­re dim­med, the stars wo­uld shi­ne im­pas­si­vely down on the ce­leb­rants. The black car­pet of the flo­or was kind to the ba­re fe­et of the sla­ves, but Ael­mar­kin had se­lec­ted black car­pe­ting lar­gely be­ca­use it was easy to cle­an af­ter one of his en­ter­ta­in­ments and was far mo­re for­gi­ving a sur­fa­ce for a drun­ken re­ve­ler to fall on than marb­le or wo­od. The east and west walls we­re hung with sil­ver dra­pe­ri­es, and the sil­ver di­ning-co­uc­hes we­re up­hols­te­red in black to match the car­pet. Bet­we­en each co­uch and the next sto­od an enor­mo­us sil­ver cen­ser, from which ca­me sen­su­o­us and in­to­xi­ca­ting in­cen­se-smo­kes. Sil­ver tab­les sto­od be­fo­re each co­uch, and the gu­ests pro­vi­ded the only to­uch of co­lor in the ro­om. The co­uc­hes them­sel­ves each held two oc­cu­pants, an in­vi­ted gu­est and a com­pa­ni­on of his (or her) cho­osing-eit­her a fel­low gu­est or one of Ael­mar­kin's ha­rem-sla­ves dres­sed in sil­ver gos­sa­mer and matc­hing sil­ver col­lar. Pic­tu­res­que wi­ne-sla­ves, dres­sed in ab­bre­vi­ated sil­ver tu­nics, sto­od at each co­uch with the­ir sil­ver pitc­hers, and mo­re sla­ves dres­sed in sil­ver tu­nics and gos­sa­mer skirts or trews served the gu­ests with pla­tes of da­in­ti­es. Eno­ugh wi­ne had be­en drank by this ti­me that the gu­ests we­re star­ting to ra­ise the­ir vo­ices in less-than-de­li­ca­te jests, and lo­se what few in­hi­bi­ti­ons they had when they ar­ri­ved he­re.</p>
   <p>    V'sher Ten­nith er-Lord Ka­lu­mel ra­ised one long, sil­ver eyeb­row sar­do­ni­cal­ly as he sur­ve­yed the oc­cu­pants of the di­ning co­uc­hes be­fo­re and be­low him. "I must ad­mit," he draw­led, "that se­e­ing Var­ca­le­me ma­king a fo­ol of him­self is far mo­re en­ter­ta­ining than fen­ding off wo­uld-be bri­des and the­ir an­xi­o­us fat­hers."</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin la­ug­hed and con­ti­nu­ed to ca­ress the pla­ti­num tres­ses of his sla­ve, cho­sen out of all the pos­sib­le can­di­da­tes pre­sen­ted to him, be­ca­use she most re­semb­led a de­li­ca­te El­ven ma­iden. He dres­sed her li­ke an el­ven girl, too, in flo­wing gowns of de­li­ca­te pas­tel silks with hu­ge, but­terfly sle­eves and long emb­ro­ide­red tra­ins, or­de­ring her at­ten­dants to we­ave strings of pe­arls in her sil­ver-blond ha­ir-and to ar­ran­ge her ha­ir so that it co­ve­red the ro­und tips of her ears. So long as one didn't lo­ok too de­eply in­to her eyes, the il­lu­si­on was comp­le­te; and he co­uld use his ma­gic to chan­ge her blue eyes to El­ven-gre­en if he cho­se. Her na­me had be­en "Kind­re" un­til he or­de­red it chan­ged to the El­ven "Synter­rat­he."</p>
   <p>    The afo­re­men­ti­oned Var­ca­le­me was cha­sing one of the wi­ne-girls aro­und his co­uch; the flo­wer-wre­ath she had bo­und aro­und his brows had slip­ped si­de­ways and was obs­cu­ring one eye, and the fact that he had drunk most of the wi­ne in her now-empty flask was not aiding his abi­lity to catch her. She had cast one lo­ok at her mas­ter when she be­gan elu­ding tho­se clutc­hing hands, to see if he obj­ec­ted to her eva­si­ons; he had nod­ded slightly, and she ne­eded no furt­her en­co­ura­ge­ment to ke­ep dod­ging his ad­van­ces. Var­ca­le­me's co­uch-com­pa­ni­on, one of his per­so­nal con­cu­bi­nes, a tall, dark-ha­ired wench gow­ned in bril­li­ant eme­rald that matc­hed the beryl of her cont­rol­ling col­lar, se­emed re­li­eved that she no lon­ger had to en­ter­ta­in him, and was nib­bling on spi­ced fru­it, we­aring a bo­red, but wary, exp­res­si­on.</p>
   <p>    Now the rest of the gu­ests had ta­ken an in­te­rest in the pro­ce­edings, cal­ling out en­co­ura­ge­ment to Var­ca­le­me or the sla­ve, taking bets on whet­her or not he wo­uld catch her, as she dod­ged his outst­retc­hed hands and out­pa­ced his stumb­ling fe­et. Most of Ael­mar­kin's gu­ests we­re ma­le, with a scant pa­ir of El­ven la­di­es. One of the la­di­es, clad in pe­arly silks that re­ve­aled scar­cely less than the sla­ves' cos­tu­mes, had bro­ught her own co­uch-com­pa­ni­on, a musc­le-bo­und hu­man gla­di­ator; the ot­her El­ven lady, swat­hed from na­pe to ank­le in skin-tight black sa­tin, had co­me with anot­her of the El­ven­lords-who was not her af­fi­an­ced. Of the re­ma­ining twenty gu­ests, half had bro­ught the­ir own con­cu­bi­nes, and half had ma­de a se­lec­ti­on from the sla­ves of­fe­red to them by Ael­mar­kin.</p>
   <p>    All of the El­ven­lords pre­sent, with the ex­cep­ti­on of Ael­mar­kin and the lady who had bro­ught her own ma­le con­cu­bi­ne, we­re the sons of ru­ling El­ven­lords-but had not jo­ined the Yo­ung Lords' Re­bel­li­on. Most of them saw them­sel­ves as lo­sing far mo­re than they wo­uld ga­in by re­bel­ling, and the rest we­re cyni­cal­ly ho­ping for the re­bel­li­on to eli­mi­na­te the­ir fat­hers for them.</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin and V'dann Tri­ana Lord Fal­ci­on-who, des­pi­te be­ing fe­ma­le, was Lord of the Fal­ci­on hol­dings in her own right, and thus (it re­cently had be­en ru­led) was en­tit­led to the tit­le of Lord rat­her than Lady or er-Lord-we­re the only El­ven­lords in the ro­om with the­ir own es­ta­tes and pro­perty. Ael­mar­kin, ho­we­ver, was hardly a Gre­at Lord-his pro­perty was a frac­ti­on of the si­ze of any of tho­se with re­al po­wer; most of his we­alth ca­me from the sa­le of the ex­qu­isi­tely bred and tra­ined con­cu­bi­nes who we­re li­te­ral­ly worth the­ir we­ight in gems. That ga­ve him a cer­ta­in sta­tus, but no re­al po­wer. As for Tri­ana, her stan­ding had plum­me­ted af­ter her in­vol­ve­ment in the de­bac­le of the Se­cond Wi­zard War, and she was no lon­ger a de­si­rab­le ally to an­yo­ne on the Gre­at Co­un­cil. She ge­ne­ral­ly kept to her­self on her own es­ta­te. He sus­pec­ted that she was bi­ding her ti­me, wa­iting to see which way the wind blew in the Yo­ung Lords' Up­ri­sing, be­fo­re she tri­ed to worm her way back in­to the go­od gra­ces of the po­wer­ful.</p>
   <p>    As a party gu­est, ho­we­ver, she was still of va­lue; an acid wit and a re­pu­ta­ti­on for dep­ra­vity ga­ve her all the fas­ci­na­ti­on of a cap­ti­va­ting ser­pent, and pe­op­le enj­oyed se­e­ing what she wo­uld say or do next. Any ti­me Ael­mar­kin in­vi­ted her to one of his en­ter­ta­in­ments, he knew he wo­uld ha­ve full par­ti­ci­pa­ti­on, and her own par­ti­es con­ti­nu­ed to be ext­re­mely po­pu­lar among the yo­un­ger sons, tho­se who did not pos­sess gre­at po­wer, and tho­se who did not ha­ve a Co­un­cil se­at.</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin was by no me­ans as cer­ta­in as the Gre­at Lords that Tri­ana wo­uld re­ma­in out of po­wer for the fo­re­se­e­ab­le fu­tu­re. She was cle­ver, re­so­ur­ce­ful, and le­ar­ned from her mis­ta­kes. The Wi­zard Wars and the Re­bel­li­on we­re chan­ging everyt­hing; it was al­ways pos­sib­le that Tri­ana wo­uld pro­ve to be a po­tent ally at so­me po­int. It was even pos­sib­le that she wo­uld so­me­how claw her way to po­wer en­ti­rely on her own. The ex­tent of her bold­ness was de­monst­ra­ted in her dress to­night; gow­ned in trans­pa­rent silks li­ke a con­cu­bi­ne, she knew very well that ho­we­ver temp­ting she might be, the­re was no one he­re with suf­fi­ci­ent po­wer to da­re to­uch her wit­ho­ut her con­sent-and so she ta­un­ted them with her very ap­pe­aran­ce.</p>
   <p>    Besides, she had no scrup­les to spe­ak of; he li­ked that in a wo­man-pro­vi­ded he didn't ha­ve to marry her.</p>
   <p>    "Have you he­ard anyt­hing mo­re from the Co­un­cil abo­ut yo­ur pe­ti­ti­on?" Tri­ana cal­led to him from ac­ross the ro­om with a half smi­le. Her gla­di­ator of­fe­red her a cho­ice tid­bit with a ser­vi­le ges­tu­re; she al­lo­wed him to fe­ed it to her, nib­bling at it with whi­te, sharp te­eth. He was new to Ael­mar­kin, but that was hardly surp­ri­sing; Tri­ana went thro­ugh ma­le sla­ves at an as­to­nis­hing ra­te.</p>
   <p>    He con­ce­aled a win­ce; Tri­ana had a ves­ted in­te­rest in the out­co­me of that pe­ti­ti­on, and it was one qu­ite op­po­si­te to his. She wo­uld bring up the su­bj­ect; he'd che­ris­hed the no­ti­on, when he'd sche­du­led this en­ter­ta­in­ment, that it might be a vic­tory ce­leb­ra­ti­on. Sin­ce it wasn't, he had ho­ped no one wo­uld bring up the su­bj­ect.</p>
   <p>    "They de­ni­ed it," he sa­id, trying to so­und as if he didn't ca­re abo­ut the out­co­me, even tho­ugh his de­fe­at ate at him.</p>
   <p>    Triana ma­de a lit­tle po­ut of sympathy, and Ten­nith tur­ned his he­ad to ga­ze at Ael­mar­kin with as­to­nish­ment. "No, re­al­ly? I sho­uld ha­ve tho­ught that yo­ur co­usin had pro­ved him­self men­tal­ly un­ba­lan­ced a hund­red ti­mes over by now!"</p>
   <p>    About half of the gu­ests lo­oked puz­zled; they didn't know who Ael­mar­kin's co­usin was and he re­al­ly didn't wish to en­ligh­ten them.</p>
   <p>    "Really!" chi­med in anot­her, sen­ding away a ser­ver with a flick of an im­pa­ti­ent hand, "Yo­ur co­usin is qu­ite a pi­ece of work, Ael­mar­kin. Pla­ying sol­di­er with hu­man sla­ves as if he was still an in­fant pla­ying with toys! It's ri­di­cu­lo­us! If he was go­ing to ha­ve an ob­ses­si­on, it at le­ast ought to be a dig­ni­fi­ed ob­ses­si­on!"</p>
   <p>    "Oh, I don't know," pur­red Tri­ana, run­ning her fin­ger along the arm of her gla­di­ator. "So­me of us li­ke to play with sol­di­ers." The sla­ve blus­hed from the top of his he­ad to well past his wa­ist.</p>
   <p>    "On what gro­unds did they deny you?" Ten­nith as­ked, and Ael­mar­kin won­de­red if he de­tec­ted a cer­ta­in ma­li­ci­o­us enj­oy­ment in Ten­nith's to­ne. Ten­nith might not be a lord in his own right, but he out­ran­ked Ael­mar­kin, and he wasn't abo­ve fla­un­ting that fact and em­bar­ras­sing Ael­mar­kin at the sa­me ti­me.</p>
   <p>    But Ten­nith wo­uld find out for him­self what the Co­un­cil had sa­id if he simply bot­he­red to ask his fat­her. Ael­mar­kin's best pro­tec­ti­on lay in pre­ten­ding the de­ci­si­on me­ant very lit­tle to him. "They did a very ti­re­so­me thing; they had the pro­duc­ti­on re­cords from the es­ta­te for the last fifty ye­ars bro­ught out, and not­hing the­re shows that co­usin Kyrti­an is neg­lec­ting his es­ta­te or his du­ti­es. They de­ci­ded that he isn't un­ba­lan­ced, me­rely ec­cent­ric, and that ec­cent­ri­city is hardly gro­unds for ta­king his in­he­ri­tan­ce and gi­ving it to the next ma­le he­ir."</p>
   <p>    "Next ma­le he­ir?" Tri­ana as­ked sig­ni­fi­cantly, with a lit­tle frown. "Isn't his mot­her still ali­ve? Wo­uldn't she be the ap­prop­ri­ate he­ir even if he was di­sin­he­ri­ted on the gro­unds of in­sa­nity?" That was Tri­ana's in­te­rest; anyt­hing that bar­red anot­her fe­ma­le from in­he­ri­ting co­uld even­tu­al­ly be used aga­inst her.</p>
   <p>    "His mot­her is not my sis­ter," Ael­mar­kin rep­li­ed. "She's not the next he­ir of blo­od-des­cent, as you so cle­arly we­re for clan Fal­ci­on. If Kyrti­an we­re re­mo­ved, the es­ta­te wo­uld co­me to me, na­tu­ral­ly and le­gal­ly."</p>
   <p>    "She's pro­bably the one run­ning things, then," Ten­nith po­in­ted out. "If she do­esn't want to be sent back to li­ve in her father's ho­use­hold, she has to ma­ke it lo­ok as if yo­ur co­usin is com­pe­tent."</p>
   <p>    "That may be, but I've no ho­pe of pro­ving it," Ael­mar­kin grow­led, wis­hing that Lady Lydi­ell had re­semb­led the child at his fe­et rat­her than the cle­ver cre­atu­re she was. He re­cal­led his in­ten­ded po­se, and for­ced a la­ugh. "Well, I sup­po­se the Co­un­cil had to ru­le the way that they did. Lord Jas­pi­reth told me rat­her tartly that if fit­ness to hold tit­le and pro­perty was to be jud­ged on the ba­sis of unu­su­al hob­bi­es, half the Co­un­cil wo­uld lo­se the­ir se­ats."</p>
   <p>    "Half?" Ten­nith la­ug­hed. "Mo­re li­ke three-qu­ar­ters! Lo­oked at in that light, it's ob­vi­o­us you are a vic­tim of ne­ces­sity."</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin sig­na­led to his wench to re­fill his gob­let, and sip­ped at the vin­ta­ge with de­li­be­ra­ti­on. "Much as I wo­uld li­ke to see the lands of my clan ad­mi­nis­te­red pro­perly, I sus­pect they will co­me to me in ti­me, any­way. Kyrti­an shows no sign of mar­rying, which in it­self ought to pro­ve his un­fit­ness, and it's en­ti­rely pos­sib­le he'll ma­na­ge to bre­ak his neck, or do so­met­hing equ­al­ly fo­olish to him­self, as he ca­re­ens aro­und the co­untry­si­de."</p>
   <p>    "Break his neck?" qu­eri­ed the se­cond lady, lo­oking puz­zled, as did her es­cort. "I'm af­ra­id I'm rat­her lost, Ael­mar­kin. I don't know anyt­hing abo­ut yo­ur co­usin. Who is he? Is he do­ing so­met­hing dan­ge­ro­us?"</p>
   <p>    That trig­ge­red la­ugh­ter among so­me of the ot­hers, who we­re mo­re fa­mi­li­ar with Ael­mar­kin's co­usin than she was. Tri­ana to­ok pity on her-pro­bably be­ca­use the lady's es­cort was ne­it­her cle­ver nor outs­tan­dingly hand­so­me-and exp­la­ined.</p>
   <p>    "We've be­en dis­cus­sing Kyrti­an V'dyll Lord Pras­ta­ran," Tri­ana sa­id, gi­ving Ael­mar­kin's co­usin his full na­me and tit­le. "Su­rely you've he­ard so­met­hing abo­ut him?"</p>
   <p>    The lady sho­ok her he­ad. "Not re­al­ly," she con­fes­sed, then re­ali­zed that Tri­ana was pat­ro­ni­zing her, and put on a co­ol air as she tri­ed to sa­ve the si­tu­ati­on. "But I don't pay much at­ten­ti­on to the pro­vin­ci­als."</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin snor­ted. "He's cer­ta­inly pro­vin­ci­al, I'll grant you that, Lady Brynni­re. He ne­ver le­aves the es­ta­te un­less he ab­so­lu­tely has to. He co­uld get a se­at on the Gre­at Co­un­cil if he only wor­ked at it, but he won't even try! Ins­te­ad, he spends all of his ti­me col­lec­ting bo­oks and stud­ying-of all the non­sen­si­cal su­bj­ects-mi­li­tary tac­tics!"</p>
   <p>    "Military tac­tics!" Tri­ana erup­ted in pe­als of la­ugh­ter. "Oh, Ael­mar­kin, even if he is se­ri­o­us and not se­ri­o­usly un­ba­lan­ced, just who do­es he think he's go­ing to use mi­li­tary tac­tics on? Ever­yo­ne knows the hu­mans and the halfb­lo­ods don't ha­ve re­al ar­mi­es! They don't fight pro­per bat­tles! And as for the Yo­ung Lords-"</p>
   <p>    She stop­ped, be­ca­use it was en­ti­rely pos­sib­le that this was a to­uchy su­bj­ect for so­me of Ael­mar­kin's ot­her gu­ests. But Ten­nith, who­se fat­her was highly pla­ced in the Gre­at Co­un­cil and thus was the hig­hest-ran­ked El­ven­lord pre­sent, fi­nis­hed her sen­ten­ce for her.</p>
   <p>    "The Yo­ung Lords are a di­sor­ga­ni­zed pack of rab­ble," he sa­id lof­tily. "Once a so­lu­ti­on is fo­und that ne­ga­tes the­ir abi­lity to nul­lify ma­gic, they'll dis­sol­ve and co­me craw­ling back to the­ir fat­hers, beg­ging for­gi­ve­ness. In the me­an­ti­me, it is im­pos­sib­le to use tac­tics aga­inst so­me­one who do­esn't know what the word me­ans."</p>
   <p>    "Oh, that isn't the best of it," glo­ated Lord Prat­he­rin. "He not only stu­di­es this non­sen­se, he prac­ti­ces it! Per­so­nal­ly, I think he's ne­ver got­ten over pla­ying in the nur­sery with toy sol­di­ers; he just do­es it now on a gran­der sca­le." When Brynni­re still lo­oked con­fu­sed, he le­aned over the co­uch in her di­rec­ti­on and exp­la­ined. "He ma­kes up two op­po­sing ar­mi­es out of sla­ves, my de­ar, and per­so­nal­ly le­ads one army in­to bat­tle aga­inst the ot­her, if you can be­li­eve it! Not to set­tle a gri­evan­ce or for any ot­her re­aso­nab­le pur­po­se, not even for the en­ter­ta­in­ment of watc­hing them sla­ugh­ter each ot­her! No, he do­es this just to see how stra­te­gi­es work out with li­ving su­bj­ects!"</p>
   <p>    As the ot­hers chort­led, how­led, or simply lo­oked smug, ac­cor­ding to the­ir na­tu­res, Lady Brynni­re lo­oked start­led, then shoc­ked, then amu­sed. "Ael­mar­kin! If I didn't know you, I'd be temp­ted to think you we­re ma­king this up!"</p>
   <p>    "Sadly, my de­ar, I am not," Ael­mar­kin rep­li­ed, and lo­oked to Ten­nith, who nod­ded in con­fir­ma­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "Really!" Brynni­re gig­gled, a lit­tle ner­vo­usly. "Well, ec­cent­ric is not what I wo­uld call him!"</p>
   <p>    "He ta­kes af­ter his fat­her, de­ar lady," sa­id Ten­nith smo­othly. "Which might be sa­id to de­monst­ra­te that, sadly, mad­ness is in­he­ri­ted in his fa­mily. Su­rely you re­call that po­or de­men­ted fel­low who va­nis­hed se­ve­ral ye­ars ago, out hun­ting so­me obs­cu­re re­lics of Eve­lon?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes!" Brynni­re rep­li­ed, brigh­te­ning. "Ances­tors! You don't me­an to tell me that was Kyrti­an's fat­her?"</p>
   <p>    "The sa­me," Ael­mar­kin told her, with a he­avy sigh. "A sad ca­se in­de­ed. And it sho­uld ha­ve be­en ob­vi­o­us to the Gre­at Co­un­cil from that fi­as­co that the es­ta­te sho­uld not ha­ve be­en put in the hands of his son."</p>
   <p>    "I sho­uld say not." Lady Brynni­re nod­ded her he­ad, af­ter exc­han­ging a lo­ok with her es­cort. "At le­ast, I wo­uld not ha­ve."</p>
   <p>    "Nor an­yo­ne el­se with any sen­se." Ael­mar­kin tho­ught it mo­re than ti­me to chan­ge the su­bj­ect, and sig­na­led for the dan­cers.</p>
   <p>    The mu­si­ci­ans, who had be­en pla­ying so­ot­hing, qu­i­et backg­ro­und mu­sic un­til this mo­ment, ab­ruptly chan­ged mo­od and tem­po, start­ling the gu­ests with a thun­der of per­cus­si­on.</p>
   <p>    The lights dim­med, and a mist aro­se from the cen­sers, a scen­ted, co­ol mist that re­la­xed and yet sti­mu­la­ted the sen­ses, even as it obs­cu­red the co­uc­hes and the­ir oc­cu­pants. Only the spa­ce in the mid­dle of the co­uc­hes re­ma­ined cle­ar, lit from so­me in­vi­sib­le so­ur­ce.</p>
   <p>    The dan­cers ran in from all di­rec­ti­ons, dres­sed in the me­rest scraps of ani­mal-hi­de, pa­int, be­ads, and fe­at­hers, and me­ant to rep­re­sent wild hu­mans. Not that any of Ael­mar­kin's gu­ests had ever se­en wild hu­mans-nor had Ael­mar­kin him­self, for that mat­ter-but that wo­uld hardly mat­ter. Most en­ter­ta­in­ments fe­atu­red dan­cers mi­mic­king the gra­ce­ful and et­he­re­al dan­ces of the­ir mas­ters, or dan­cers chan­ged to re­semb­le ani­ma­ted flo­wers, birds, or fla­mes. Ael­mar­kin wan­ted to start­le his gu­ests with so­met­hing dif­fe­rent.</p>
   <p>    The dan­ce be­gan with as­to­nis­hing le­aps as the per­for­mers hur­led them­sel­ves ac­ross the flo­or with to­tal aban­don, the­ir un­bo­und ha­ir stre­aming out be­hind them. Then, as drums po­un­ded, the fe­ma­les hur­led them­sel­ves at the ma­les, who ca­ught them in va­ri­o­us po­si­ti­ons, whir­led them aro­und, and flung them on to the next part­ner. The­re was frank and unf­linc­hing ero­ti­cism in the­ir cho­re­og­raphy. Even Ael­mar­kin, who had se­en them prac­ti­cing, felt his pul­se qu­ic­ken at the­ir raw sen­su­ality.</p>
   <p>    "Ancestors!" Ten­nith mut­te­red un­der his bre­ath, his eyes wi­de. "What is this?"</p>
   <p>    "An an­ci­ent fer­ti­lity ri­te, so I'm told," Ael­mar­kin sa­id ca­su­al­ly. "I tho­ught it might be in­te­res­ting to watch."</p>
   <p>    Tennith didn't reply; his eyes we­re glu­ed to the dan­cers.</p>
   <p>    Half com­bat, and half ma­ting-frenzy, it was so­me­ti­mes dif­fi­cult to tell if the dan­cers in­ten­ded to co­up­le or kill each ot­her, and the per­for­man­ce bu­ilt to a pul­se-po­un­ding cres­cen­do that en­ded in a tang­le of bo­di­es sug­ges­ti­ve of both.</p>
   <p>    By Ael­mar­kin's or­ders, the lights dim­med gra­du­al­ly as the dan­ce en­ded, le­aving the ro­om bat­hed only in star- and mo­on­light. As he had ho­ped, the per­for­man­ce had ac­hi­eved the aro­using ef­fect he had in­ten­ded. His gu­ests had tur­ned the­ir at­ten­ti­ons to the­ir co­uch-com­pa­ni­ons, and as the dan­cers and ser­vants slip­ped away, Ael­mar­kin tur­ned his at­ten­ti­on to the cen­sers, inc­re­asing the mist ri­sing from them. The sla­ves al­re­ady knew to dust mo­re of the in­to­xi­ca­ting drugs over the co­als the­re­in.</p>
   <p>    Magic did not co­me easily to him, and he had to clo­se his eyes in con­cent­ra­ti­on even to per­form so mi­nor a co­nj­ura­ti­on. As he ope­ned his eyes, he re­ali­zed that he and his lit­tle sla­ve we­re no lon­ger alo­ne. A slim form sat on the end of his co­uch.</p>
   <p>    "Well, Tri­ana," he sa­id blandly, con­ce­aling his surp­ri­se. "Wha­te­ver brings you to my si­de? For­gi­ve me if I do­ubt that you ha­ve ero­tic in­ten­ti­ons."</p>
   <p>    She ma­de a po­uting mo­ti­on with her lips. "Ael­mar­kin, I do be­li­eve you ha­ven't a ro­man­tic par­tic­le in you!"</p>
   <p>    "Neither do you," he co­un­te­red. "So?"</p>
   <p>    "I just won­de­red what it wo­uld be worth to you to see yo­ur co­usin un­se­ated," she sa­id ca­su­al­ly, cas­ting her eyes down and tra­cing a lit­tle path on the fab­ric of the co­uch with her fin­ger.</p>
   <p>    "I sup­po­se that wo­uld de­pend on the cir­cums­tan­ces," he rep­li­ed just as ca­su­al­ly. "It wo­uld do me no go­od at all if, for ins­tan­ce, his es­ta­tes we­re ru­ined in the pro­cess. Why do you ask?"</p>
   <p>    "No re­al re­ason. Just that wo­men of­ten ha­ve so­ur­ces of in­for­ma­ti­on that are clo­sed to the men." She ga­ve him an arch smi­le, but he re­fu­sed to ri­se to the ba­it. The last thing he wan­ted was to gi­ve Tri­ana so­met­hing she co­uld use to ma­ni­pu­la­te him!</p>
   <p>    "Just as men ha­ve so­ur­ces that are clo­sed to wo­men," he co­un­te­red, with an arch smi­le of his own. "Espe­ci­al­ly so­me­one li­ke me. Do re­call what my stock-in-tra­de is, my de­ar. Con­cu­bi­nes don't spe­ak to la­di­es."</p>
   <p>    She smi­led with ma­li­ci­o­us de­light. "If I hadn't ma­de a vow ne­ver to marry, I swe­ar, I wo­uld pro­po­se to you on the spot, Ael­mar­kin! You and I are two of a kind."</p>
   <p>    "You and I wo­uld kill one anot­her be­fo­re a ye­ar was out," he rep­li­ed, and to­uc­hed his fin­ger to the bot­tom of her chin, dra­wing her to him for a bri­ef, dan­ge­ro­us kiss. "Now, you've left that hand­so­me stud all alo­ne. Bet­ter get back to him be­fo­re he pi­nes away."</p>
   <p>    "Or falls as­le­ep." She ro­se with a si­nu­o­us gra­ce worthy of any of his dan­cers. "I'll tell you what; I'll lay a bet with you. I bet that I can find so­met­hing to disc­re­dit him be­fo­re you do."</p>
   <p>    "And the sta­kes?" he as­ked.</p>
   <p>    Her smi­le was so swe­etly po­iso­no­us that it to­ok his bre­ath away. "So­met­hing we both swo­re ne­ver to do. If you lo­se, you tra­in a ma­le sla­ve for me. And if I lo­se, I tra­in a fe­ma­le for you. But you can't li­mit me as to me­ans. Is it a wa­ger?"</p>
   <p>    The idea of ow­ning a sla­ve tra­ined by Tri­ana ma­de his he­ad swim and his bre­ath co­me short. Now he­re we­re sta­kes worthy of the play!</p>
   <p>    "Done," he sa­id im­me­di­ately. She la­ug­hed, and gli­ded away in­to the mist.</p>
   <p>    He felt a ten­ta­ti­ve to­uch on his wrist, and be­la­tedly re­tur­ned his at­ten­ti­on to his cur­rent fa­vo­ri­te. He lo­oked down at her, and saw by the fur­ti­ve co­lor in her che­ek, her mo­ist lips, and her shi­ning eyes that the dan­ce-and the sighs and va­gue sha­pes mo­ving in the mist aro­und them-had pro­du­ced the ef­fect he had an­ti­ci­pa­ted on her, as well.</p>
   <p>    "Lord," the sla­ve bre­at­hed, lo­oking up at him coyly from be­ne­ath her long, flut­te­ring las­hes, "Do you wish my-furt­her ser­vi­ce this eve­ning?"</p>
   <p>    Though un­to­uc­hed, she was by no me­ans una­wa­re of the du­ti­es of a con­cu­bi­ne, and it was cle­ar from the mo­ist eager­ness in her eyes that she was re­ady to ful­fill tho­se du­ti­es.</p>
   <p>    He clo­sed his eyes for a mo­ment, sa­vo­ring what he was abo­ut to do. He had ways of cont­rol­ling the sla­ves he tra­ined that went be­yond, far be­yond, the sla­ve-col­lar and ma­gic co­er­ci­on. He had subt­le tor­tu­res that we­re far mo­re sop­his­ti­ca­ted than anyt­hing Ten­nith dre­amed of.</p>
   <p>    "I don't be­li­eve so," he sa­id, just as ca­su­al­ly as if he we­re re­j­ec­ting a not-qu­ite-ri­pe fru­it. Then he lo­oked down at her and frow­ned. "My de­ar child-is so­met­hing tro­ub­ling you? You se­em to be a lit­tle-puf­fy to­night. Or per­haps you ha­ve just ga­ined a lit­tle we­ight? Per­haps you sho­uld re­turn to yo­ur qu­ar­ters."</p>
   <p>    The girl put her hand to her mo­uth, stif­ling a sob; her eyes brigh­te­ned furt­her with te­ars. Qu­ickly as a flut­te­ring bird, she fled in­to the mist.</p>
   <p>    He chuck­led to him­self. He had ca­re­ful­ly ma­ni­pu­la­ted her mind for we­eks now, and this ca­re­ful­ly cho­sen mo­ment was the be­gin­ning of a de­light­ful in­ter­lu­de.</p>
   <p>    He had ma­de a po­int of pra­ising her slen­der fi­gu­re, of le­aving no do­ubt that he tre­asu­red her slim­ness. Do­ub­ting her own mir­ror, cer­ta­in that she had lost her re­al be­a­uty, and des­pe­ra­te to ga­in his re­gard, she wo­uld be­gin star­ving her­self from this mo­ment. At first he wo­uld ta­unt her by re­fe­ren­ces to plump arms and chubby che­eks, by in­qu­iri­es if she tho­ught she ought to chan­ge her di­et. On­ce she truly be­gan to star­ve her­self, he wo­uld switch to the next pha­se. She wo­uld be­gin re­fu­sing fo­od. He, of co­ur­se, wo­uld ur­ge all man­ner of da­in­ti­es on her, which she wo­uld eat un­wil­lingly, only to pur­ge her­self of them at the ear­li­est op­por­tu­nity.</p>
   <p>    His lips cur­ved in a slight smi­le. Watc­hing her tor­tu­re her­self, all the whi­le cer­ta­in that he was still as gent­le and con­si­de­ra­te as ever, wo­uld be highly amu­sing. Even­tu­al­ly, she wo­uld pro­bably die, of co­ur­se, but not be­fo­re he ga­ined a gre­at de­al of ple­asu­re from watc­hing her ri­di­cu­lo­us suf­fe­rings. If he was fe­eling ge­ne­ro­us, he might even sa­ve her, wi­ping out her me­mo­ri­es of everyt­hing up to this mo­ment so that he co­uld sell her to so­me­one el­se. In any ca­se, the­re wo­uld be we­eks, pos­sibly months, of ple­asu­re ahe­ad.</p>
   <p>    And furt­her ple­asu­re. Bet­we­en the two of them, he and Tri-ana wo­uld al­most cer­ta­inly find a way to bring his co­usin Kyrt-ian down.</p>
   <p>    He la­ug­hed softly; how his for­tu­ne had sud­denly tur­ned! This might well turn out to be the vic­tory ce­leb­ra­ti­on he had ho­ped for.</p>
   <p>    His ap­pe­ti­te sud­denly aro­used, he re­ac­hed for the ne­arest wi­ne-wench to sa­tisfy his ne­eds of the mo­ment.</p>
   <p>    Poor Kyrti­an. He had no no­ti­on even that he had an enemy, much less how for­mi­dab­le that enemy was.</p>

   <p>    One did not nor­mal­ly see an El­ven­lord smud­ged with dirt, twig-scratc­hed, and rat­her the wor­se for se­ve­ral ho­urs of tram­ping thro­ugh un­ta­med fo­rest. I won­der how much scan­dal I wo­uld ca­use if even one of the Gre­at Lords saw me in this sta­te? Kyrti­an mu­sed, as he held asi­de an er­rant limb of a bush, ta­king ca­re that it did not rat­tle, and ma­king cer­ta­in the hu­man be­hind him had a firm grip on it be­fo­re he re­le­ased it. It was im­pos­sib­le to see the man's exp­res­si­on be­hind his helm, but the fel­low sketc­hed a res­pect­ful sa­lu­te with his free hand. Ah well; kno­wing my re­pu­ta­ti­on, they wo­uld pro­bably not be at all surp­ri­sed.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian V'dyll Lord Pras­ta­ran led his skir­mis­hing band of lightly ar­med hu­mans in per­son; very few El­ven­lords wo­uld ever ha­ve put them­sel­ves in that in­fe­ri­or and vul­ne­rab­le a po­si­ti­on. Es­pe­ci­al­ly now, with hu­mans, halfb­lo­oded Wi­zards and yo­un­ger El­ven­lords all in re­volt aga­inst the Gre­at Lords, the me­re no­ti­on of le­ading a gro­up alo­ne, wit­ho­ut the pre­sen­ce of a fully col­lar-cont­rol­led and lo­yalty-spel­led body­gu­ard, was so­met­hing that wo­uld ne­ver oc­cur to most of them.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian ca­red not­hing for the­ir opi­ni­ons, sin­ce lit­tle sec­ret was ma­de of the fact that they ca­red not­hing for his. His re­pu­ta­ti­on was as ec­cent­ric as his hobby, and that was the way he pre­fer­red things. His Grand­fat­her had esc­he­wed po­li­tics when the Gre­at Lords dis­da­ined his ad­vi­ce; by now, sta­ying out of po­li­tics was so­met­hing of a fa­mily tra­di­ti­on, and Kyrti­an was qu­ite pre­pa­red to con­ti­nue that tra­di­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    At this mo­ment, as al­ways when on ma­ne­uvers, all of his at­ten­ti­on was fo­cu­sed on his bat­tle-stra­te­gi­es and his sur­ro­un­dings, to the exc­lu­si­on of everyt­hing el­se. His ini­ti­al bat­tle-plan was so va­gue that at this po­int he was rat­her reck­les­sly ma­king de­ci­si­ons mo­ment by mo­ment. He sus­pec­ted that his op­po­nent was co­un­ting on that, as­su­ming that Kyrti­an's well-known ca­uti­on wo­uld al­so ma­ke him inf­le­xib­le. It was a re­aso­nab­le as­sump­ti­on; Kyrti­an just ho­ped that he co­uld pro­ve that it was an in­cor­rect one. That was the po­int of this exer­ci­se, af­ter all. This was the first ti­me he had ever met an op­po­nent in anyt­hing ot­her than a set bat­tle. Whe­re was the right ba­lan­ce of ca­uti­on and ini­ti­ati­ve? Not­hing in all of his bo­oks and stu­di­es had de­alt with that ma­gic for­mu­la.</p>
   <p>    Sweat trick­led down the back of his neck, but a he­ad­band un­der his helm kept it from drip­ping in­to his eyes. He felt a bri­ef flash of su­pe­ri­ority as he clim­bed the ste­ep and rock-strewn slo­pe be­fo­re him with no sen­se of stra­in, not even an inc­re­ase in his bre­at­hing. How many of the pam­pe­red Gre­at Lords wo­uld be ab­le to do as much? Cer­ta­inly he was swe­ating, but he wasn't in the le­ast ti­red, and if at last he ma­na­ged to bring his skir­mis­hers to a fight, he wo­uld be as re­ady for ac­ti­on as any of them.</p>
   <p>    Senses alert for the le­ast sign of war­ning, he pic­ked his way one ca­re­ful step at a ti­me thro­ugh the spar­se un­derb­rush of the fo­rest. His men spre­ad out in his wa­ke, ca­re­ful­ly fol­lo­wing his examp­le. His sword was out and re­ady in his left hand; that wo­uld gi­ve him a lit­tle ad­van­ta­ge aga­inst an op­po­nent, sho­uld one sud­denly ap­pe­ar be­fo­re him, but not much. The enemy fighters lur­king so­mew­he­re ahe­ad knew him and so­me had fo­ught hand-to-hand aga­inst him be­fo­re.</p>
   <p>    The enemy-all that he knew for cer­ta­in was that they we­re he­re in his patch of pris­ti­ne, old-growth fo­rest, and that the­ir num­bers we­re equ­al to his. The most lo­gi­cal pla­ce to find them, the we­at­he­red re­ma­ins of an an­ci­ent for­ti­fi­ca­ti­on, had be­en empty. He as­su­med now that they pro­bably plan­ned to set up an am­bush for his skir­mis­hers so­mew­he­re; they knew he was co­ming, and he do­ub­ted that they in­ten­ded to ma­ke a pitc­hed bat­tle of it. In the­ir pla­ce, he wo­uldn't.</p>
   <p>    His ad­van­ta­ge was that he knew the­se wo­ods as well as his op­po­nents did; he sho­uld, sin­ce everyt­hing for le­agu­es aro­und he­re be­lon­ged to him. He had ma­de a men­tal tally of all the ob­vi­o­us pla­ces for an am­bush, and he ho­ped he co­uld ap­pro­ach such pla­ces from unex­pec­ted ang­les, and with luck, catch the fo­emen by surp­ri­se.</p>
   <p>    An am­bus­hed am­bush-hardly spor­ting, I sup­po­se. He smi­led, kno­wing the exp­res­si­on was hid­den by his helm. Well, first he wo­uld ha­ve to pull this off. Then he wo­uld worry abo­ut whet­her it was "spor­ting"-assu­ming he'd won the en­co­un­ter, of co­ur­se.</p>
   <p>    After all, it is the vic­tor who wri­tes the his­to­ri­es, and he is the one who gets to de­ter­mi­ne what is fa­ir, af­ter the fact.</p>
   <p>    A mo­ve­ment to one si­de ca­ught his eye; only one of his men, trying to shoo away an ir­ri­ta­ting fly with a mi­ni­mum of ob­vi­o­us mo­ve­ment. They knew bet­ter than to slap at in­sects, lest the so­und bet­ray them to the enemy, and he felt sorry for his hu­man figh­ting-men. For all that he swe­ated as he­avily as any one of them, in­sects sel­dom pla­gu­ed el­ves, per­haps be­ca­use el­ves, not na­ti­ve to this world, did not smell "right" to the pesky bugs.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian fro­ze and ra­ised his hand to sig­nal to his men to do li­ke­wi­se, as he tho­ught he ca­ught a mur­mur of vo­ices up ahe­ad. Hol­ding his bre­ath, he clo­sed his eyes and con­cent­ra­ted on lis­te­ning.</p>
   <p>    Perhaps-perhaps. He ope­ned his eyes aga­in, and con­si­de­red the­ir pre­sent lo­ca­ti­on, frow­ning as he did so. He and his figh­ters we­re ap­pro­ac­hing a rid­ge over­lo­oking one of the les­ser-used path­ways thro­ugh the fo­rest. The rid­ge was an ob­vi­o­us location for an am­bush pla­ce­ment on the part of his fo­es, if they as­su­med he and his men wo­uld ta­ke that path be­low. It wo­uld be very dif­fi­cult for his party to cre­ep up upon the enemy un­se­en if that was whe­re they we­re.</p>
   <p>    He ra­ised his right hand abo­ve his he­ad to desc­ri­be three circ­les with his in­dex fin­ger. The figh­ter im­me­di­ately be­hind him ma­de the sa­me mo­ti­on, and in due ti­me, a slightly bu­ilt, lit­he yo­ung fel­low by the pe­cu­li­ar hu­man na­me of Ho­ren Go­sak mo­ved ca­uti­o­usly and no­ise­les­sly in­to pla­ce be­si­de Kyrti­an.</p>
   <p>    They loc­ked eyes, Kyrti­an's gre­en ones me­eting the hu­man's brown; Kyrti­an nod­ded to­wards the rid­ge in the di­rec­ti­on of the vo­ices and ma­de the hand sig­nal for am­bush. Ho­ren nod­ded, and le­aving his sword and sword-belt be­hind in Kyrti­an's ke­eping lest they catch in the brush, drop­ped to his hands and kne­es to sna­ke his way up to­wards the rid­ge, mo­ving so low to the gro­und that he lo­oked li­ke a craw­ling li­zard.</p>
   <p>    It was al­ways a won­der to Kyrti­an how yo­ung Ho­ren ma­na­ged to di­sap­pe­ar in­to lands­ca­pe that was so bar­ren of ob­vi­o­us co­ver. So­me­ti­mes he won­de­red if the abi­lity was so­me uni­que ap­pli­ca­ti­on of the so-cal­led hu­man ma­gics. That was en­ti­rely pos­sib­le, and wo­uld ha­ve ca­used far mo­re scan­dal among the Gre­at Lords than Kyrti­an's lit­tle ec­cent­ri­city of le­ading his figh­ters in per­son. Alt­ho­ugh it was the law that all hu­man sla­ves be fit­ted with col­lars that in­hi­bi­ted the­ir own pe­cu­li­ar ma­gic, no sla­ve on the Pras­ta­ran es­ta­tes had ever worn anyt­hing but a de­co­ra­ti­ve col­lar sin­ce the El­ven­lords ca­me to this world. And no "sla­ve" on the Pras­ta­ran es­ta­tes had ever be­en a sla­ve in anyt­hing but na­me.</p>
   <p>    Humans ma­ke very po­or sla­ves; Grand­fat­her tri­ed to tell his ar­ro­gant com­pat­ri­ots that, and they wo­uldn't lis­ten, and now they're pa­ying the pri­ce for ig­no­ring such sa­ge ad­vi­ce. The first Lord Pras­ta­ran had re­ti­red to the es­ta­te he'd be­en al­lot­ted, pro­ce­eding the­re to put his own the­ori­es to. work in re­gard to the abo­ri­gi­nal in­ha­bi­tants of the pla­ce. Be­fo­re he drow­ned in a flash flo­od-whi­le ne­arly twenty of his de­vo­ted "sla­ves" al­so drow­ned in fran­tic at­tempts to sa­ve him-he had for­med the lo­ose con­fe­de­ra­ti­on of pri­mi­ti­ves that had be­en li­ving on the pro­perty in­to a thri­ving and pros­pe­ro­us com­mu­nity that not only ac­cep­ted him as the­ir over­lord, but we­re ab­so­lu­tely de­vo­ted to his wel­fa­re.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian's fat­her had in­he­ri­ted that com­mu­nity, and had che­ris­hed and fos­te­red it, re­cog­ni­zing it for the va­lu­ab­le re­so­ur­ce that it was! Now it was Kyrti­an's to gu­ide and gu­ard, for in gu­ar­ding the hu­mans un­der his pro­tec­ti­on, he was all too awa­re that he was gu­ar­ding his own pros­pe­rity.</p>
   <p>    His wan­de­ring tho­ughts we­re ab­ruptly re­cal­led by Ho­ren's re­turn, as the yo­ung man wrig­gled in­to co­ver be­si­de him. With the aid of twigs, peb­bles, and a few hand-sig­nals, Ho­ren swiftly la­id out the dis­po­si­ti­on of the enemy for­ces ahe­ad.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian stu­di­ed the ar­ran­ge­ment for se­ve­ral mo­ments, grin­ding his te­eth a lit­tle in frust­ra­ti­on. As usu­al, the enemy com­man­der sho­wed bril­li­ant skill. It was an ap­pal­lingly su­pe­ri­or dis­po­si­ti­on. Ob­vi­o­usly one co­uldn't ap­pro­ach them from the front or the re­ar, so what did that le­ave him?</p>
   <p>    We co­uld ret­re­at, but that wo­uld le­ave them in pos­ses­si­on of the wo­ods, and they wo­uld win this wit­ho­ut a fight. That was unac­cep­tab­le. Is the­re eno­ugh ro­om on the top of this rid­ge to flank them?</p>
   <p>    He didn't want to di­vi­de his for­ce if he co­uld help it, and he'd ha­ve to if he wan­ted to use a clas­sic pin­cer ma­ne­uver. That wo­uldn't be a go­od idea any­way; one that the gro­und didn't en­co­ura­ge. He'd ha­ve to send his men to fight aga­inst both ends of the enemy am­bush-li­ne in a way that wo­uld only al­low one or two figh­ters to clo­se in at a ti­me; that wo­uld put them at an im­me­di­ate di­sad­van­ta­ge.</p>
   <p>    Finally Kyrti­an de­ci­ded on so­met­hing truly unort­ho­dox; wa­iting un­til the enemy com­man­der was frust­ra­ted eno­ugh to co­me lo­oking for him. Short exp­lo­ra­ti­on by Ho­ren pro­du­ced the pla­ce whe­re any op­po­sing for­ce was most li­kely to des­cend from the rid­ge. Af­ter ca­re­ful de­li­be­ra­ti­on, he set up an am­bush of his own.</p>
   <p>    Of co­ur­se, the we­ak­ness of this plan was that the op­po­si­ti­on might not de­ci­de to co­me down on this si­de of the rid­ge. That wo­uld le­ave him, in his turn, wa­iting to spring an empty trap. Still, the oc­ca­si­onal mur­mur of vo­ices thro­ugh the hush of the fo­rest told him that his op­po­nents we­re get­ting ti­red of wa­iting.</p>
   <p>    Probably they had be­en in pla­ce ever sin­ce his own for­ce had en­te­red the wo­ods. Ho­ren went out aga­in to spy, so that Kyrt-ian's tro­ops wo­uld at le­ast know if the foe mo­ved off in so­me ot­her di­rec­ti­on. Kyrti­an set­tled in­to his own po­si­ti­on and held off bo­re­dom by ma­king an in­for­mal bird-co­unt ba­sed on the calls he he­ard.</p>
   <p>    Time craw­led past, but his pa­ti­en­ce was fi­nal­ly re­war­ded. Ho­ren slit­he­red back to ta­ke up his we­apons. Kyrti­an pum­ped his fist in the air on­ce, and he­ard a fa­int rust­le of le­aves as his men ca­ught the sig­nal, re­la­ying it down the li­ne, and re­ad­ying them­sel­ves for ac­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    He had cho­sen his own pla­ce per­fectly. Anot­her fa­int rust­le of le­aves and the oc­ca­si­onal snap­ping of a twig war­ned that the enemy was on the mo­ve, and shortly af­ter, the men ap­pe­ared fi­ling ca­uti­o­usly down the slo­pe be­low them, flit­ting from bits of co­ver to the­ir next po­si­ti­on. Kyrti­an wa­ited un­til he was cer­ta­in that all of the enemy skir­mis­hers we­re im­me­di­ately be­low the­ir own po­si­ti­on, his ner­ves so ta­ut that his skin ting­led, musc­les we­re afi­re, his pul­se po­un­ding in his temp­les and his ears.</p>
   <p>    Wait for it-</p>
   <p>    If he sprang the am­bush too so­on, his own men wo­uld be sur­ro­un­ded. He didn't know exactly how many men the enemy had, so he co­uldn't co­unt he­ads…</p>
   <p>    Wait for it-</p>
   <p>    He didn't da­re per­mit his for­ce to be outf­lan­ked.</p>
   <p>    Now!</p>
   <p>    His thro­at crac­ked with a yell as he bro­ke out of co­ver and char­ged, his men stre­aming down the slo­pe be­hind him. The start­led skir­mis­hers whir­led to fa­ce them.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian skid­ded to a halt on the slo­pe as he ne­arly ran in­to a figh­ter who was con­si­de­rably tal­ler than he. In that mo­ment, as was al­ways true for him on­ce the figh­ting star­ted, everyt­hing nar­ro­wed to this sing­le op­po­nent. The­ir swords clas­hed to­get­her, his op­po­nent co­un­te­red with a cle­ver parry that sent him le­aping away lest the figh­ter try to grap­ple with him. Next the man tri­ed to circ­le him, but that was the last thing that Kyrti­an was go­ing to al­low-at the mo­ment he had the slight ad­van­ta­ge of be­ing up­hill, and that was the only ad­van­ta­ge he re­al­ly had over this bul­ki­er op­po­nent.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian ret­re­ated as fast as the ot­her ad­van­ced; not­hing was go­ing to for­ce him to turn if he co­uld help it. So­mew­he­re in the back of his mind he was dimly awa­re of sho­uts, the clas­hing of me­tal, and all the din of bat­tle, but he was too se­aso­ned to ever be dist­rac­ted from his own li­ne of com­bat. Gi­ving up on the ploy of for­cing Kyrti­an off hig­her gro­und, the fel­low swung low, hard and wi­de, scything at Kyrti­an's legs; Kyrti­an used the op­por­tu­nity to slash at the man's sword-hand as he him­self skip­ped back­wards.</p>
   <p>    He re­al­ly hadn't ex­pec­ted the luck of a full stri­ke, but his op­po­nent had evi­dently an­ti­ci­pa­ted a blow to the he­ad rat­her than the hand. The figh­ter duc­ked to one si­de and didn't get his hilt up in ti­me to def­lect Kyrti­an's blow.</p>
   <p>    The bla­de pas­sed thro­ugh the ot­her's wrist, le­aving be­hind a glo­wing li­ne. The figh­ter cur­sed, trans­fer­ring the sword to his left hand, tuc­king the "di­sab­led" hand in­to his belt at the small of his back, as per the ru­les of com­bat. If he hadn't, he'd get a war­ning af­ter the bat­tle was over-and the se­cond ti­me he re­fu­sed to ac­cept a blow, the mar­ked area or limb wo­uld truly go comp­le­tely numb and use­less un­til Kyrti­an re­mo­ved the ma­gic that ren­de­red it so.</p>
   <p>    He was by no me­ans as go­od a figh­ter with his we­ak hand as Kyrti­an was. A clumsy at­tempt at an over­hand blow left his arm­pit unp­ro­tec­ted, and the El­ven­lord exe­cu­ted a fa­tal thrust. The bla­de va­nis­hed up to the hilt with no re­sis­tan­ce, and the man jer­ked in re­ac­ti­on to the all-over ting­le that the "de­ath-wo­und" ga­ve him as the sign that he was "de­ad."</p>
   <p>    Now the figh­ter glo­wed the co­lor of new le­aves all over; with a go­od-na­tu­red cur­se, he sa­lu­ted Kyrti­an, she­at­hed his bla­de, and re­mo­ved his helm, jo­ining fi­ve of his fel­low "de­ad men" on the si­de­li­nes. All of them we­re glo­wing the sa­me yel­low-gre­en, which me­ant they we­re all out of the enemy for­ces. Kyrti­an ma­de the mis­ta­ke of al­lo­wing him­self a bri­ef pa­use to glo­at wit­ho­ut lo­oking be­hind him.</p>
   <p>    A mo­ment af­ter that, a sud­den elect­ric jolt told Kyrti­an that he had be­en ta­ken from be­hind. Ru­eful­ly lo­oking down at him­self, he saw that he, too, was glo­wing.</p>
   <p>    "Galkasht!" he cur­sed, in the Old Ton­gue, and he­ard Sar­ge­ant Gel's fa­mi­li­ar la­ugh in ans­wer. He she­at­hed his own sword in dis­gust, pul­led off his helm, and went to jo­in the ot­her de­ad.</p>
   <p>    Gel did not get a chan­ce to enj­oy his vic­tory for long; Ho­ren ro­se out of a bush be­hind him and ca­ught him ac­ross the neck as he tur­ned. Gel swo­re even mo­re co­lor­ful­ly than Kyrti­an had, whi­le his own men je­ered and cat­cal­led from the si­de­li­nes.</p>
   <p>    "Who is it has ne­ver be­en hit from be­hind?" cal­led one, in fe­ig­ned in­no­cen­ce.</p>
   <p>    "You owe me be­er for the next mo­on, Sar­ge­ant," one of the ot­hers he­art­les­sly re­min­ded him. "And you owe Ho­ren three night-watc­hes."</p>
   <p>    "Don't re­mind me." The hu­man pul­led off his helm and threw it to the gro­und, gla­ring at them-but they knew they we­re sa­fe. The "de­ad" co­uld say anyt­hing they li­ked as long as the bat­tle was on. That was anot­her one of the ru­les, me­ant to be su­re that no one tur­ned mock-com­bat in­to a re­al fight.</p>
   <p>    "Temper, tem­per," scol­ded a third, as Ho­ren va­nis­hed to se­ek a new op­po­nent. "A true war­ri­or ne­ver fights with an­ger."</p>
   <p>    "I'm not figh­ting," Gel po­in­ted out so­urly, his jaw clenc­hed tight.</p>
   <p>    Gel pic­ked up his helm af­ter anot­her scorc­hing gla­re and stam­ped his way down the hill to the si­de­li­nes. Kyrti­an hid his own grin, and ga­ve Gel a com­mi­se­ra­ting slap on the sho­ul­der.</p>
   <p>    "Too bad, old man," he sa­id, with what he ho­ped was a go­od co­un­ter­fe­it of sympathy. "That's com­bat-luck for you."</p>
   <p>    'That's ca­re­les­sness, you me­an," Gel grow­led, as he ruf­fled his swe­aty, griz­zled brown ha­ir to dry it. "Don't cod­dle me, Kyrti­an; I got you when you stop­ped to glo­at, then I was ser­ved the sa­me dish. What's mo­re, you am­bus­hed me when I lost pa­ti­en­ce. You're go­ing to win this one. I un­de­res­ti­ma­ted you."</p>
   <p>    Since at this po­int, tho­se who glo­wed yel­low-gre­en out­num­be­red tho­se who glo­wed red-oran­ge by three to one, that was fairly ob­vi­o­us, so Kyrti­an held his ton­gue and tri­ed as­su­me a mo­dest exp­res­si­on.</p>
   <p>    "I think we can co­unt this ex­pe­ri­ment a suc­cess," he sa­id ins­te­ad. "I wasn't su­re we'd be ab­le to ma­ke the tran­si­ti­on from are­na-figh­ting and set-bat­tles, but it's ob­vi­o­us this mo­de is go­ing to work."</p>
   <p>    "I'd ke­ep it at the skir­mish-le­vel for a whi­le," Gel ca­uti­oned.</p>
   <p>    "I in­tend to," Kyrti­an as­su­red him, as mo­re of the "de­ad" on the si­de­li­nes che­ered the sur­vi­ving figh­ters on or sho­we­red them with abu­se. "At le­ast un­til ever­yo­ne's got­ten a fa­ir amo­unt of prac­ti­ce at this. I don't want pe­op­le stumb­ling aro­und bre­aking ank­les in rab­bit-ho­les or run­ning in­to an ali­corn and get­ting ske­we­red. We're out he­re to fight, not get hurt." He lo­ose­ned his thro­at-gu­ard and yan­ked it off.</p>
   <p>    Gel bar­ked a la­ugh at that, and Kyrti­an had to grin. 'That's as true as it so­unds ab­surd," Gel chuck­led. "And it's true you'd ha­ve less luck get­ting pe­op­le to vo­lun­te­er to fight for us if too many of the boys star­ted co­ming back with bro­ken bo­nes, or wor­se." He stuck his thumb in his sword-belt and watc­hed the figh­ters with par­do­nab­le pri­de. "I'll tell you what, tho­ugh-I'd pit the­se lads aga­inst any of the pro­fes­si­onal figh­ters I've se­en when it co­mes to com­bat rat­her than gla­di­ato­ri­al ga­mes. They'd win."</p>
   <p>    "That's rat­her the po­int, tho­ugh I ho­pe it do­esn't co­me to that. The­re'll be far less blo­od shed if they go up aga­inst consc­ripts." Kyrti­an watc­hed as the last of his men sur­ro­un­ded the last of Gel's and de­man­ded the­ir sur­ren­der. "The El­ven­lords can com­pel men to fight, but they can't com­pel them to fight well. Spe­aking of vo­lun­te­ers-the fi­eld-folk are go­ing to ne­ed anot­her ho­li­day be­fo­re too long."</p>
   <p>    "We'd bet­ter think abo­ut or­ga­ni­zing a me­lee, then," Gel sig­hed. He ha­ted set­ting up me­le­es, as they we­re a gre­at de­al of work, and as in re­al bat­tles, most of the pe­op­le who to­ok part in them had no idea how to ac­tu­al­ly fight. A go­od per­cen­ta­ge got mud­dled and did the op­po­si­te of what they'd be­en or­de­red, and when they got mud­dled, they ge­ne­ral­ly con­fu­sed tho­se who we­re trying to obey the or­ders cor­rectly. Still, ever­yo­ne on the es­ta­te enj­oyed the mock-wars and we­re happy to vo­lun­te­er for them; the­re was gre­at ex­ci­te­ment in bat­tle when the­re was no chan­ce of dying and lit­tle chan­ce of get­ting hurt. A war-day me­ant a ge­ne­ral ho­li­day with fe­as­ting and mu­sic, and dan­cing for tho­se who we­re "kil­led" be­fo­re they we­re comp­le­tely ex­ha­us­ted.</p>
   <p>    Not that an­yo­ne got kil­led de­li­be­ra­tely just so he co­uld go dan­cing, sin­ce tho­se who we­re too ex­ha­us­ted to dan­ce we­re pam­pe­red and tre­ated li­ke he­ro­es re­gard­less of which si­de won.</p>
   <p>    Ever sin­ce the first ti­me that Kyrti­an and his right-hand man had ex­pan­ded the­ir war-ga­mes to inc­lu­de the ge­ne­ral po­pu­la­ti­on of the es­ta­te, the exer­ci­se had pro­ven so po­pu­lar that hu­mans and el­ves ali­ke had co­me to ex­pect and an­ti­ci­pa­te a war-day every two or three mo­ons or so. Kyrti­an just co­uldn't bring him­self to di­sap­po­int them-and the one ti­me he'd tri­ed to hold a fe­ast wit­ho­ut a war, the­re had be­en such pro­test that he'd ne­ver da­red do it aga­in.</p>
   <p>    "I don't sup­po­se it co­uld be a wo­ods-bat­tle, co­uld it?" he as­ked wist­ful­ly. "Or-oh, what abo­ut a si­ege?"</p>
   <p>    "With the ma­nor as the tar­get? No, bet­ter yet, the Do­wa­ger-Ho­use; no one's used it in de­ca­des, and it's be­en ye­ars sin­ce it was cle­aned and aired out. It'll gi­ve yo­ur Lady-Mot­her an ex­cu­se to get it set to rights in ca­se we ne­ed it for so­met­hing. An­ces­tors know what, but we might." Gel mul­led that over as his men dec­li­ned to sur­ren­der, elec­ting to fight to the last one stan­ding. "That co­uld be do­ne-if you co­uld ma­na­ge mock-arrows and mock-sto­nes; per­haps mock-bo­iling-oil."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian sta­red at him, ag­hast at the pic­tu­re that co­nj­ured up. "Ances­tors! You're cer­ta­inly blo­ody-min­ded!"</p>
   <p>    "If you want a si­ege, you might as well do it right," Gel ar­gu­ed. "That me­ans that the be­si­egers will use bows, and the be­si­eged will pelt them with wha­te­ver they can from the walls. Now, can you pro­du­ce the pro­per ma­te­ri­al, or can't you?"</p>
   <p>    "I pro­bably can," Kyrti­an ad­mit­ted. "But you do re­ali­ze what this will me­an, don't you?"</p>
   <p>    "Huge ca­su­al­ti­es early on, which me­ans the bat­tle won't run long, which me­ans we'll get to the fe­as­ting so­oner." Gel grin­ned. "Which me­ans less work for me and mo­re for yo­ur ob­li­ging Lady-Mot­her in ar­ran­ging the en­ter­ta­in­ment."</p>
   <p>    "And pro­bably a po­pu­la­ti­on inc­re­ase in ni­ne months un­less I ma­ke su­re to do­se every par­tic­le of fo­od on the es­ta­te aga­inst con­cep­ti­ons," Kyrti­an sig­hed. "Which me­ans mo­re work for me, both in con­coc­ting the new ma­gic-we­apons, and in se­e­ing to it that we don't get that flo­od of new births. You know what hap­pens when the wo­men get to be in on the com­bat! Why it is that mock-figh­ting gets them so sti­mu­la­ted-" He sho­ok his he­ad. "So­me­ti­mes I think that you hu­mans are so dif­fe­rent from us that I'll ne­ver un­ders­tand you. Still-"</p>
   <p>    "A si­ege wo­uld be fun," Gel sa­id, per­su­asi­vely, as his men drop­ped, one by one, be­ne­ath the swords of Kyrti­an's figh­ters. "We've ne­ver do­ne a si­ege be­fo­re with li­ve figh­ters. Things that work on the sand-tab­le with mo­dels don't al­ways work with li­ving pe­op­le."</p>
   <p>    The temp­ta­ti­on was too gre­at to re­sist. "All right," he de­ci­ded. "Start plan­ning and wor­king to­ward it. I'll re­se­arch the ma­gic ne­eded. If it do­esn't lo­ok as if we can pull it off in a months' ti­me, we'll ha­ve the usu­al fi­eld-me­lee ins­te­ad."</p>
   <p>    "Done!" Gel cro­wed, and slap­ped him on the sho­ul­der, just as the last of his men fell. At that po­int, Kyrti­an's re­ma­ining figh­ters rus­hed up, che­ering, and the­re was no po­int in trying to talk un­til the vic­tory ce­leb­ra­ti­on was over.</p>

   <p>    As was usu­al, the two gro­ups of com­ba­tants trud­ged out of the fo­rest to­get­her as a sing­le fra­ter­nal mass with no sen­se of marc­hing or­der. The fo­rest co­uld well ha­ve be­en de­vo­id of li­fe at this po­int; birds and be­asts we­re pro­bably frigh­te­ned in­to im­mo­bi­lity by the la­ugh­ter and tal­king. At any ra­te, Kyrti­an co­uldn't spot so much as a rab­bit or a spar­row as they fol­lo­wed the fa­int track of an old ro­ad be­ne­ath the tre­es. The sun was just set­ting, and a thick, gol­den light po­ured through the branc­hes, gil­ding the ed­ges of the le­aves and to­uc­hing the clo­uds. Ti­red, but che­er­ful, fri­ends and com­ra­des tra­ded cong­ra­tu­la­ti­ons, bo­asts, and out­right li­es as Kyrti­an and Gel bro­ught up the re­ar. Kyrti­an ne­ver per­mit­ted an­yo­ne to carry his ar­mor for him; li­ke his men, he bo­re his own equ­ip­ment, at le­ast as far as the­ir trans­por­ta­ti­on. The­re we­re wa­gons and a car­ri­age wa­iting just out­si­de the wo­ods to carry them all back to the ma­nor, sin­ce it wo­uld ha­ve ta­ken them ho­urs to re­turn on fo­ot; Kyrti­an was very glad to be ab­le to toss his helm to his dri­ver and al­low his body-ser­vant to ta­ke the he­avy ar­mor off be­fo­re he clim­bed in­to the cus­hi­oned com­fort of the car­ri­age. As a to­ken of his pri­vi­le­ged rank, Gel sha­red both the at­ten­ti­ons of the ser­vant and the car­ri­age; the men hel­ped each ot­her and ma­de do with the cus­hi­oning ef­fect of a thick la­yer of hay in the­ir wa­gons. "Ah, the be­ne­fits of rank," Gel sig­hed as he sat back in the car­ri­age op­po­si­te Kyrti­an. Kyrti­an grin­ned.</p>
   <p>    As so­on as Gel got him­self se­ated, the dri­ver tur­ned the hor­ses and sent the car­ri­age on its way whi­le the wa­gons we­re still be­ing lo­aded with men and ar­mor. "Ances­tors!" Kyrti­an exc­la­imed, as the ser­vant han­ded him a flask of co­ol, swe­et wa­ter. "I've be­en lo­oking for­ward to this all af­ter­no­on!" He to­ok a long dra­ught, ti­ming his drink with the jol­ting of the car­ri­age so he didn't bre­ak his te­eth on the neck of the flask, be­fo­re han­ding it to Gel.</p>
   <p>    "You'd think we'd get ti­red of this non­sen­se," Gel res­pon­ded, le­aning back in­to the soft, dark brown vel­vet cus­hi­ons af­ter he'd cor­ked the flask and han­ded it back to yo­ung Lynder, Kyrt-ian's body-ser­vant. "Yo­ur de­ar mot­her ke­eps sa­ying we're too old to play at be­ing sol­di­ers, and so­me­ti­mes I won­der if she's right, at le­ast abo­ut me. Every ti­me we co­me back from one of the­se ga­mes, I ask myself if it isn't ti­me to stop."</p>
   <p>    "You only think that as long as it ta­kes for you to get yo­ur wind back." The yo­ung El­ven­lord grin­ned at his com­pa­ni­ons, and Lynder chuck­led. "And mot­her has a dif­fe­rent set of pri­ori­ti­es from you and me. What do you ex­pect her to say? She's not just a fe­ma­le, she's a lady, and if she had her way we'd all be drif­ting aro­und the es­ta­te in clo­uds of tran­qu­il mu­sic, per­fu­me, and re­fi­ne­ment. If it we­re up to her, you'd be cul­ti­va­ting ro­ses, and I'd be cul­ti­va­ting il­lu­si­ons and co­ur­ting so­me fra­gi­le lit­tle lily of a ma­iden." He ac­cep­ted the flask back and to­ok anot­her drink. "Not that you ne­ed to apo­lo­gi­ze for ha­ving a knack with ro­ses-but I don't think you'd want to spend yo­ur li­fe among the flo­wers."</p>
   <p>    Gel rol­led his eyes. "Gods for­bid!" he exc­la­imed. "I'd die of bo­re­dom in half a day! Ro­ses are all right for a hobby, but not as a li­fe's work!"</p>
   <p>    "I'd pre­fer ten­ding ro­ses to be­ing for­ced to spend my ti­me cul­ti­va­ting a high­born ma­iden." Kyrti­an la­ug­hed, the so­und in­ter­rup­ted oddly by the jo­un­cing of the car­ri­age. "At le­ast you don't ha­ve to ma­ke con­ver­sa­ti­on with a flo­wer, even if you do ha­ve to be ca­re­ful of the thorns. It's easi­er to avo­id thorns than try to ke­ep a stran­ge wo­man from se­e­ing things she sho­uldn't."</p>
   <p>    He tri­ed to ke­ep his to­ne light, but his la­ugh­ter so­un­ded a bit stra­ined in his own ears. The su­bj­ect of wi­ves and he­irs had be­en much on his mot­her's mind and ton­gue la­tely; hardly a day pas­sed wit­ho­ut her al­lu­ding to it at le­ast on­ce. It was a su­bj­ect he was not easy with. He enj­oyed his li­fe the way it was, and had no re­al wish to bring a stran­ger in­to his ho­me. "Ances­tors! I'd ha­ve to set up an en­ti­rely se­pa­ra­te part of the es­ta­te to ke­ep her pro­perly sec­lu­ded, and that wo­uld be as much of a bo­re as co­ur­ting her wo­uld be! I swe­ar, if it we­ren't for­bid­den I'd wed a sto­ut-he­ar­ted hu­man wench from right he­re."</p>
   <p>    Gel ma­de a so­ur fa­ce. "At the le­ast, we'd ne­ed the Do­wa­ger-Ho­use set to rights just to con­fi­ne the girl in, and so­me­how ke­ep her me­wed up the­re in­de­fi­ni­tely. If Te­neb­rinth, Se­la­zi­an and Pe­le­nal had da­ugh­ters-things wo­uld be a gre­at de­al easi­er on all of us. You'd think one of yo­ur cli­ents wo­uld ha­ve the go­od sen­se to ta­ke ca­re of that lit­tle prob­lem for us!"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian rep­li­ed with comp­le­te se­ri­o­us­ness. "I wish they had. Not­hing wo­uld ha­ve ple­ased me bet­ter to ta­ke one of them in­to my fa­mily li­ne; they're all fi­ne gent­le­men. As it is-well, so­me­day so­on I sup­po­se I'll ha­ve to ple­ase Mot­her and go lo­oking amongst so­me­one el­se's un­der­lings for a wi­fe. Even­tu­al­ly I'll find a ma­iden who's of suf­fi­ci­ently low rank to be too ove­ra­wed to no­ti­ce my ec­cent­ri­ci­ti­es."</p>
   <p>    "She'll ha­ve to over­lo­ok mo­re than that," Gel war­ned him,</p>
   <p>    "Or you'll ha­ve her run­ning back to her Pa­pa with sto­ri­es of how you can't ke­ep yo­ur sla­ves pro­perly un­der yo­ur thumb."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian felt com­pel­led to gi­ve his mot­her's co­un­ters to tho­se ar­gu­ments, which we­re the sa­me that he him­self had ra­ised. "Elven ma­idens in most ho­use­holds are kept clo­se-con­fi­ned, Mot­her says. And a ma­iden of low rank sho­uld be daz­zled by her new sur­ro­un­dings and too much in awe of Mot­her ever to qu­es­ti­on things. We think that as long as her ser­vants obe­yed her, she'd ne­ver know we do things dif­fe­rently he­re." He comp­res­sed his brows in a lit­tle frown. "I'd ha­ve to ma­ke su­re that she was ne­ver al­lo­wed to abu­se them, tho­ugh… and that co­uld ta­ke so­me ma­na­ge­ment."</p>
   <p>    Gel lo­oked du­bi­o­us, but only sa­id, "If you'd just le­ave the wi­fe-hun­ting up to yo­ur Mot­her, you can be su­re she won't cho­ose so­me­one we'll ha­ve to worry abo­ut. She has entry to all the bo­wers, and if she can't find so­me­one sympat­he­tic to our ways, she can at le­ast find so­me­one who is too ti­mid to spe­ak up abo­ut anyt­hing, too stu­pid to ca­re, or has be­en too clo­sely shel­te­red to know what is and is not usu­al."</p>
   <p>    "I sup­po­se that's the only re­al so­lu­ti­on," Kyrti­an sig­hed, and win­ced at the tho­ught of a mo­use, a dolt, or a fra­il flo­wer as a wi­fe. What a dis­gus­ting si­tu­ati­on, he tho­ught, frow­ning. And I'm go­ing to ha­ve to do so­met­hing abo­ut it fa­irly so­on. Mot­her isn 't go­ing to al­low me to put it off much lon­ger.</p>
   <p>    Gel snor­ted at his ru­eful exp­res­si­on, as a par­ti­cu­larly hard bo­un­ce sent them all in the air for a bri­ef mo­ment. "Don't mo­pe," he rep­li­ed sternly, then ad­ded, with a cru­de chuck­le, "At le­ast you aren't go­ing to be sad­dled with a wi­fe who has the hips of a cow, the man­ners of a pig, and the fa­ce of a hor­se. You El­ves are ne­ver less than hand­so­me, so you won't ha­ve to wish for a bag to put over her he­ad when you do yo­ur duty to pre­sent the es­ta­te with an he­ir."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian flus­hed, fe­eling the tips of his ears burn. Gel had be­en his te­ac­her, com­pa­ni­on, and fri­end for as long as he co­uld re­mem­ber, but the hu­man co­uld be ama­zingly co­ar­se, so­me­ti­mes. How on earth co­uld he exp­la­in that what ma­de him dre­ad mat­ri­mony was the fe­ar that he'd find him­self bo­und for cen­tu­ri­es to a dull, in­si­pid idi­ot? How co­uld he pos­sibly get up enough in­te­rest in a ma­iden li­ke that to do his duty by the es­ta­te and the clan? Gel wo­uld only la­ugh, and tell him that it wasn't what was bet­we­en a girl's ears that mat­te­red-</p>
   <p>    If I co­uld find so­me­one li­ke Mot­her, he tho­ught wist­ful­ly, I'd wed her no mat­ter what her rank was. Did Fat­her ever re­al­ly know how lucky he was to find a ma­iden with wit, co­ura­ge, sen­se, and in­tel­li­gen­ce? What are rank and ma­gic worth, com­pa­red with qu­ali­ti­es li­ke that?</p>
   <p>    "We'll ha­ve to tell Mi­lady abo­ut the new sche­me for a si­ege," Gel sa­id che­er­ful­ly, in­ter­rup­ting his tho­ughts. "She'll pro­bably want to ha­ve a hand in it her­self this ti­me-and I think you ought to gi­ve her a bit of a com­mand. May­be then she'll stop te­asing us abo­ut our pas­ti­me."</p>
   <p>    "You know, you co­uld be right." Kyrti­an bra­ced him­self as the car­ri­age hit a se­ri­es of ruts that thre­ate­ned to bo­un­ce them all aga­inst the ce­iling, rat­tling his very te­eth. This was the worst part of the ro­ad; in a mo­ment, everyt­hing wo­uld sud­denly smo­oth out as they re­ac­hed the pa­ved sec­ti­on. "May­be if she gets a tas­te of this, she'll re­ali­ze just how chal­len­ging it is."</p>
   <p>    My only ot­her cho­ice wo­uld be to tell her the truth-that it isn 't a ga­me, that Gel and I are tra­ining the hu­mans to de­fend the es­ta­te if-or when-com­bat co­mes he­re. I don't want to do that; I don't know that dan­ger is co­ming, I just fe­el it in my bo­nes. The­ir es­ta­te was re­la­ti­vely iso­la­ted, and he and his mot­her cer­ta­inly we­re not in the first so­ci­al circ­les, but still… first had co­me the El­ven­ba­ne, that we­ird wi­zard-girl who had, by all re­pu­te, sing­le-han­dedly en­gi­ne­ered an up­ri­sing of to­tal­ly un­sus­pec­ted halfb­lo­ods. Not that he ex­pec­ted any tro­ub­le from the halfb­lo­ods-his pe­op­le we­re per­fectly free to jo­in the Wi­zards any ti­me they wan­ted to, and no­ne of them did. Still, to ha­ve a dre­aded le­gend co­me to li­fe and ta­ke down the most po­wer­ful El­ven­lord on the Co­un­cil, and do it with the aid of Lord Dyran's own son, who she so­me­how sub­ver­ted-well, it had all of the El­ven­lords lo­oking for mo­re halfb­lo­ods-in-dis­gu­ise in the­ir midst.</p>
   <p>    And when the Gre­at Lords we­re lo­oking for one thing, they might find so­met­hing el­se they didn't ca­re for.</p>
   <p>    Then had co­me a se­cond re­bel­li­on, this ti­me of the El­venlords' own dis­re­gar­ded se­cond and third of­fsp­ring, the "spa­res," which ap­pa­rently in­vol­ved a new sort of ma­gic that dis­rup­ted even the most po­wer­ful El­ven ma­gic. That war was not go­ing well for the Gre­at Lords. It wasn't so much that they'd lost a gre­at de­al of ter­ri­tory, for the re­la­ti­vely small num­ber of Yo­ung Lords who had re­vol­ted had only ta­ken a few es­ta­tes; the prob­lem was that they'd ta­ken and held them, and con­ti­nu­ed to hold, and alt­ho­ugh Kyrti­an didn't know this for cer­ta­in, he sus­pec­ted they we­re ma­king them­sel­ves felt. They we­re a thorn, not in the si­de, but in the fo­ot, and one which was felt with every step the Gre­at Lords to­ok. That ma­de them edgy; al­ways a dan­ge­ro­us thing. Kyrti­an didn't li­ke the idea of ha­ving an edgy, in­qu­isi­ti­ve Gre­at Lord no­sing aro­und anyw­he­re ne­ar his es­ta­te. Or his pe­op­le.</p>
   <p>    And if anyt­hing hap­pe­ned be­ca­use the­re was an in­qu­isi­ti­ve Gre­at Lord snif­fing aro­und-well, he wan­ted to be re­ady for it.</p>
   <p>    "Maybe she'll want to ta­ke up the sword for her­self," Gel sug­ges­ted, with a sly twink­le. "You know she'd be go­od at it. I think if she ever got a fe­el for righ­ting, she'd be as ad­dic­ted to it as we are."</p>
   <p>    "Oh, the­re's a tho­ught!" Kyrti­an la­ug­hed wic­kedly. "I co­uld ma­ke her my se­cond-in-com­mand. Then what wo­uld you do?"</p>
   <p>    "Go on my kne­es and sub­mit," Gel ad­mit­ted. "And bow to the ine­vi­tab­le. I've se­en her mo­ve and I've se­en her at the hunt- she's got bet­ter re­ac­ti­ons than you do. An­ces­tors! Put a bow in her hands, and I'll sur­ren­der on the spot rat­her than fa­ce her!"</p>
   <p>    The car­ri­age jol­ted one last ti­me, as the whe­els bo­un­ced up on­to the pa­ve­ment, then Kyrti­an and Gel set­tled back with iden­ti­cal sighs of re­li­ef as ro­ugh ri­de ga­ve way to smo­oth rol­ling that was as com­for­tab­le as sa­iling on a smo­oth la­ke.</p>
   <p>    "I trust you've ta­ken ca­re of things for the men as usu­al?" Kyrti­an as­ked Lynder. The yo­ung hu­man had only be­en Kyrt-ian's body-ser­vant for two months, but he'd be­en me­ti­cu­lo­usly tra­ined by Kyrti­an's pre­vi­o­us man, and the El­ven­lord was con­fi­dent he co­uld hand­le his new res­pon­si­bi­li­ti­es as in­vi­sibly as his pre­de­ces­sor.</p>
   <p>    The man lo­oked a lit­tle an­xi­o­us. "The bath­ho­use is cle­ared and re­ady, din­ner's be­en held, the­re's to be mu­sic and la­te-le­ave for the ot­her ser­vants to jo­in the en­ter­ta­in­ment-" He he­si­ta­ted, and glan­ced ple­adingly at Gel, cle­arly won­de­ring if he'd mis­sed so­met­hing.</p>
   <p>    "Exactly right, Lynder," Kyrti­an sa­id so­ot­hingly, to ta­ke the lo­ok of an­xi­ety out of his eyes. Lynder had pro­bably mis­sed one or two de­ta­ils, but the ot­her ser­vants wo­uld see to it that everyt­hing went smo­othly any­way. Af­ter ye­ars of the­se mock-bat­tles, ever­yo­ne knew what was ex­pec­ted af­ter­wards. The ho­use-and fi­eld-ser­vants we­re ex­pec­ted to resc­he­du­le the­ir own baths so that the re­tur­ning figh­ters co­uld ha­ve the pla­ce to them­sel­ves. Din­ner had be­en held back so that it wo­uld re­ach the tab­les hot and fresh as they ca­me out of the bath­ho­use-and it wo­uldn't be the usu­al bre­ad and stew, but so­met­hing a lit­tle fan­ci­er. Ro­ast me­at or chic­ken, usu­al­ly, a cho­ice of si­de-dis­hes, and so­met­hing in the way of a swe­et. The­re wo­uld be a lit­tle ext­ra be­er-not eno­ugh to ca­use prob­lems, but a glass or two mo­re than usu­al for ever­yo­ne. So­me of the ho­use­hold mu­si­ci­ans wo­uld co­me down af­ter din­ner, and the­re wo­uld be so­me li­vely mu­sic and dan­cing, and if beds had two oc­cu­pants or no­ne in them to­night ins­te­ad of one, no one wo­uld be ta­ken to task. To­mor­row wo­uld be a qu­ar­ter-ho­li­day, work and drill to start a bit la­ter in the mor­ning than usu­al so that the men co­uld sle­ep in a bit. All in all, the men wo­uld fe­el them­sel­ves well re­war­ded for the­ir hard work to­day.</p>
   <p>    And we ne­ed to be­gin plan­ning the next ho­li­day by to­mor­row at the la­test, Kyrti­an re­min­ded him­self. He didn't li­ke to ma­ke the in­ter­vals bet­we­en ho­li­days too long; he didn't want the ho­use-and fi­eld-ser­vants to start fe­eling ag­gri­eved at the spe­ci­al tre­at­ment the figh­ters re­ce­ived.</p>
   <p>    The car­ri­age slo­wed and ca­me to a stop; in the dusty gold light that was swiftly fa­ding, a ser­vant in eme­rald-gre­en tu­nic and trews ope­ned the do­or, and Kyrti­an got out, fol­lo­wed by Gel and Lynder. Ro­und, blue-whi­te lights han­ging in clus­ters of fo­ur from bron­ze posts al­re­ady bla­zed on eit­her si­de of the whi­te sto­ne sta­ir­ca­se that led to the front por­tals of the ma­nor. Mo­re gre­en-li­ve­ri­ed ser­vants to­ok pos­ses­si­on of the ar­mor and arms as Kyrti­an lo­oked abo­ut. Gel sa­lu­ted and stal­ked off to­wards the bar­racks in that ti­re­less, age­less stri­de that Kyrti­an could ne­ver imi­ta­te, with the fi­nal rays of the set­ting sun il­lu­mi­na­ting him li­ke so­me god-to­uc­hed he­ro of hu­man his­tory.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian ran up the ala­bas­ter steps of the ma­nor with Lynder clo­se be­hind, de­ep sha­dows now gi­ving way to blue dusk. At the top of the sta­irs, do­ub­le do­ors of cast bron­ze wo­uld ha­ve swung open at the me­rest to­uch of his ma­gic, but he ig­no­red them en­ti­rely, in­ten­ding to ta­ke the in­cons­pi­cu­o­us do­or­ke­eper's entry at the si­de. The gre­en-clad do­or­ke­eper had ex­pec­ted just that, and was hol­ding open the smal­ler por­tal for him, bo­wing slightly as he pas­sed thro­ugh.</p>
   <p>    "Beker!" Kyrti­an gre­eted him. "Is yo­ur wi­fe bet­ter?"</p>
   <p>    The hu­man's long fa­ce brigh­te­ned at the qu­es­ti­on. "Oh, much bet­ter, Lord Kyrti­an! We can­not thank you eno­ugh-"</p>
   <p>    "You'll thank me by not let­ting things get to such a pass be­fo­re you say so­met­hing," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, with just eno­ugh of a stern to­ne to his vo­ice that the do­or­ke­eper wo­uld know he was se­ri­o­us. "Don't ke­ep go­ing back to the 'pot­he­cary; when the simp­le cu­re do­esn't work, go to Lord Se­la­zi­an. That's why I ke­ep him as a re­ta­iner, Be­ker; ma­ke the lazy lo­ut work for his li­ving!"</p>
   <p>    "Yes. Lord Kyrti­an," the do­or­ke­eper whis­pe­red, bo­wing furt­her. "I will, my lord."</p>
   <p>    "Carry on, Be­ker," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, and mo­ved on, le­aving the do­or­ke­eper to shut things up be­hind him.</p>
   <p>    "Lynder, re­mind Lord Te­neb­rinth to ha­ve a talk with the apot­he­cary, will you?" Kyrti­an sa­id in a qu­i­et asi­de as they stro­de down the mid­dle of the ent­ran­ce hall. A thick, pa­le-grey car­pet be­ne­ath the­ir fe­et muf­fled all so­und of fo­ot­fal­ls, and alt­ho­ugh the ala­bas­ter ce­iling and grey-ve­ined marb­le walls we­re not im­po­sing, Kyrti­an tho­ught they had a gre­at de­al of dig­nity abo­ut them. "I can't ha­ve my pe­op­le get­ting sick and rel­ying on that-that herb-sha­man for everyt­hing! I wo­uldn't ha­ve had him at all, if you hu­mans hadn't in­sis­ted on him."</p>
   <p>    "Lord Kyrti­an-it is frigh­te­ning for so­me of us to ask a Lord for anyt­hing, much less ask him to tre­at us for our ail­ments," Lynder rep­li­ed with he­si­ta­ti­on. "You for­get so­me­ti­mes that alt­ho­ugh many of us ha­ve be­en born and ra­ised in yo­ur ser­vi­ce, many mo­re co­me from out­si­de the bo­un­dary of yo­ur es­ta­te, and things are very dif­fe­rent in the gre­ater world."</p>
   <p>    "Well, that's why I want you to re­mind Lord Te­neb­rinth to talk to the apot­he­cary. I sus­pect the man might be en­co­ura­ging tho­se fe­ars, and if that's true, I want it stop­ped." Kyrti­an frow­ned. "Ances­tors! The last thing we ne­ed is to get a pla­gue star­ted be­ca­use a man who thinks rat­tling bo­nes and bre­wing te­as can cu­re everyt­hing won't gi­ve up trying till his pa­ti­ents are de­ad!"</p>
   <p>    "With yo­ur per­mis­si­on, Lord Kyrti­an, I'll ask Ser­ge­ant Gel to ha­ve a word with him first." Kyrti­an saw out of the cor­ner of his eye that Lynder was smi­ling a lit­tle. "The Ser­ge­ant can be very per­su­asi­ve."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian nod­ded, as they tur­ned down a si­de cor­ri­dor to the fa­mily-qu­ar­ters. "I trust yo­ur judg­ment, Lynder. But do fe­el free to bring Te­neb­rinth in on it; he is my Se­nesc­hal, af­ter all."</p>
   <p>    Lynder mo­ved ahe­ad to smo­othly open a do­or on the right-hand si­de of the cor­ri­dor be­fo­re Kyrti­an co­uld to­uch it him­self. "Yes, Lord Kyrti­an," he rep­li­ed, and as Kyrti­an step­ped thro­ugh the do­or in­to his pri­va­te qu­ar­ters, he was en­gul­fed by ser­vants.</p>
   <p>    In ot­her ho­use­holds, they wo­uld ha­ve be­en cal­led "sla­ves," and it was true that Kyrti­an was the­ir ti­tu­lar ow­ner-but if any one of them wan­ted to le­ave, he wo­uld ha­ve only to pe­ti­ti­on the El­ven­lord and per­mis­si­on wo­uld be ins­tantly gran­ted. So­me­how, so­me way, Kyrti­an wo­uld find a way to smug­gle the hu­man out to the ter­ri­to­ri­es held by the Wi­zards or the free hu­mans. Not that an­yo­ne wo­uld ever ask for that per­mis­si­on-the world open to free hu­mans was hos­ti­le and un­com­for­tab­le, and en­ti­rely too dan­ge­ro­us to be much of a temp­ta­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    As had be­en the ca­se with Kyrti­an's fat­her and grand­fat­her, Kyrti­an and his mot­her we­re res­pec­ted, ad­mi­red, even be­lo­ved, not only by the hu­mans of the es­ta­te, but by the few El­ven re­ta­iners who cal­led them the­ir li­ege-lords. The­re we­re three who we­re of the most im­por­tan­ce; the afo­re­men­ti­oned Te­neb­rinth who­se po­si­ti­on as Se­nesc­hal pre­da­ted Kyrti­an's birth, Se­la­zi­an the Physi­ci­an who had be­en stud­ying the di­se­ases of hu­mans as well as El­ves for li­te­ral­ly cen­tu­ri­es-and Lord Pe­le­nal, Kyrtian's Agent, who hand­led all the af­fa­irs of the es­ta­te that ne­eded to be con­duc­ted out­si­de the walls of the es­ta­te.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian and his mot­her we­re as de­pen­dent on Pe­le­nal's go­od will as he was on the­irs, but he had ne­ver gi­ven them even a mo­ment of une­ase. Pe­le­nal bo­ught new sla­ves, ne­go­ti­ated cont­racts, and hag­gled to get the best pri­ces for the fo­ods­tuf­fs pro­du­ced by this most fer­ti­le of es­ta­tes. Pe­le­nal was one of tho­se most des­pi­sed of cre­atu­res, an El­ven­lord with so lit­tle ma­gic he might just as well ha­ve had no­ne at all. Des­pi­te the fact that the­re co­uld not pos­sibly ha­ve be­en a bet­ter Agent in all of the es­ta­tes, Pe­le­nal wo­uld ne­ver ha­ve at­ta­ined that po­si­ti­on of po­wer in the ser­vi­ce of an­yo­ne ot­her than Kyrti­an's fa­mily. He knew that; saw El­ves with mo­re ma­gic than he gro­ve­ling for crumbs at the tab­les of gre­ater El­ven­lords, and de­monst­ra­ted his gra­ti­tu­de in the most tan­gib­le of terms on a re­gu­lar ba­sis.</p>
   <p>    That was just as well, be­ca­use whe­re re­al po­wer, the po­li­ti­cal po­wer of the Co­un­cil of the Gre­at Lords was con­cer­ned, Kyrti­an had no­ne. His only po­wer was eco­no­mic, and that was in no small part due to Pe­le­nal's cle­ver ma­na­ge­ment.</p>
   <p>    Still, that po­wer co­uld be for­mi­dab­le.</p>
   <p>    As ser­vants swar­med over him, strip­ping him to the skin as they pro­pel­led him to­wards the bat­hing ro­om, he al­lo­wed him­self the lu­xury of fe­eling just a lit­tle smug. Po­li­ti­cal po­wer ca­me and went-even ma­gic po­wer co­uld fa­de with ti­me, or be lost to furt­her ge­ne­ra­ti­ons-but eco­no­mic po­wer was a much mo­re de­pen­dab­le, if un­der­ra­ted for­ce. His grand­fat­her had un­ders­to­od that, even if his fat­her hadn't-but his fat­her had the ser­vi­ces of Te­neb­rinth to en­su­re that the es­ta­te's pros­pe­rity con­ti­nu­ed. Pe­le­nal had simply bu­ilt on that fo­un­da­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    The bat­hing-ro­om, of gre­en-ve­ined marb­le with shi­ning sil­ver fix­tu­res, fe­atu­red a sun­ken tub lon­ger than Kyrti­an was tall, and de­ep eno­ugh for him to sink in up to his chin. Just now it was so full of ste­am it was dif­fi­cult to see ac­ross it. Kyrti­an step­ped in­to the tub ca­re­ful­ly. When fat­her va­nis­hed, things co­uld ha­ve be­en very bad, if mot­her hadn't had the go­od sen­se to ask Te­neb­rinth if he knew so­me­one he co­uld trust to be­co­me our out­si­de Agent. Kyrti­an eased him­self down in­to the hot, juniper-scented wa­ter of his bath, thin­king as he did so that his Mot­her was al­most as re­mar­kab­le in her way as his Grand­fat­her had be­en. The mo­re he le­ar­ned abo­ut run­ning this es­ta­te, the mo­re ama­zing it was to him that not­hing had go­ne wrong. Thanks to Te­neb­rinth and Pe­le­nal, who stu­di­ed the de­mands of the ot­her es­ta­tes and the re­so­ur­ces of the­ir own with the fi­er­ce de­di­ca­ti­on of a war­ri­or for his craft, Kyrti­an's es­ta­te was so pros­pe­ro­us that even his worst ene­mi­es wo­uld ne­ver dre­am of for­cing a conf­ron­ta­ti­on with him.</p>
   <p>    He clo­sed his eyes and frag­rant ste­am ro­se up and fil­led the ro­om furt­her with scen­ted fog. No one Lord wo­uld ever da­re chal­len­ge me, he tho­ught con­ten­tedly. And pro­bably not two or three to­get­her. Not that they 're li­kely to, sin­ce I don't med­dle in po­li­tics, but they still wo­uldn't da­re. Not when the­se lands fe­ed and clot­he a third of them. Not when the fru­its of our la­bors are ser­ved up on the­ir tab­les, when our wi­nes are the cho­icest, our silks the fa­irest.</p>
   <p>    Granted, an El­ven­lord with po­wer­ful ma­gic co­uld trans­form wa­ter and as­hes in­to the fi­nest wi­ne and cho­icest me­als-but it was still wa­ter and as­hes, and wo­uldn't no­urish any bet­ter. It to­ok a gre­at de­al of ma­gic to cre­ate such il­lu­si­ons, ma­gic which co­uld be put to bet­ter use. Il­lu­sory gold had no com­mer­ci­al worth-but the gold in Kyrti­an's tre­asury was re­al eno­ugh.</p>
   <p>    No, no one is ever go­ing to try any po­li­ti­cal ga­mes with us, he told him­self, as the he­at of the bath war­med and so­ot­hed all of his ti­red, stra­ined musc­les. They wo­uldn't da­re. Pe­le­nal wo­uldn 't sell to them, and then whe­re wo­uld they be? Half the stuff that go­es to fe­ed the­ir sla­ves co­mes from he­re; most of them don't bot­her gro­wing gra­in any­mo­re, or ra­ising she­ep for wo­ol and flax for li­nen.</p>
   <p>    As of­ten as he as­ked Te­neb­rinth if the­re was anyt­hing the Se­nesc­hal wan­ted as a re­ward for all his go­od ser­vi­ce, Te­neb­rinth had ne­ver as­ked for anyt­hing but the most tri­vi­al of fa­vors. Lord Te­neb­rinth of­ten se­emed to Kyrti­an the most con­ten­ted of be­ings; he had a wi­fe who ado­red him, and the fre­edom to ma­na­ge the es­ta­te as he saw fit. Te­neb­rinth's chi­ef ple­asu­re out­si­de of his fa­mily ca­me from trying out lit­tle theories of ma­na­ge­ment. Over the de­ca­des, he had we­eded out all the ones that didn't work at all, or didn't work well, and now he was in the pro­cess of fi­ne-tu­ning and ba­lan­cing everyt­hing. The one thing that Te­neb­rinth wo­uld ha­ve wan­ted that Kyrti­an co­uldn't gi­ve him was a child.</p>
   <p>    And if I co­uld, I wo­uld. I think we pay for our long li­ves in our lack of child­ren. It was sad, re­al­ly, for if the­re was ever an El­ven lady born to be a mot­her, it was Te­neb­rinth's wi­fe, Lady Ser­ya­na.</p>
   <p>    And of co­ur­se, it wo­uld be so much easi­er on all of us if they just had a da­ugh­ter. It wo­uldn't ha­ve mat­te­red how yo­ung the girl was; Kyrti­an wo­uld be mo­re than wil­ling to wa­it for her to grow up. Af­ter all, he had all the ti­me in the world be­fo­re him; El­ves did age and die even­tu­al­ly, but "even­tu­al­ly" was se­ve­ral cen­tu­ri­es away.</p>
   <p>    Maybe what he ought to do wo­uld be to in­ves­ti­ga­te tho­se ru­mors that so­me El­ven­lords had dis­co­ve­red ways to en­han­ce the­ir fer­ti­lity with ma­gic. If that we­re true, and he co­uld find a way to purc­ha­se the ser­vi­ces of such a ma­gi­ci­an-</p>
   <p>    That wo­uld sol­ve ever­yo­ne's prob­lem, wo­uldn't it?</p>
   <p>    It was an easy so­lu­ti­on on the sur­fa­ce, but li­ke de­ep wa­ter, such a "so­lu­ti­on" co­uld co­ver mo­re than was im­me­di­ately ap­pa­rent.</p>
   <p>    The fa­vor might cost mo­re than I'm wil­ling to gi­ve. What if the ma­ge wan­ted sla­ves? How co­uld I send off any of my pe­op­le in­to re­al sla­very? What if he wan­ted so­me of my figh­ters? What if he wan­ted Gel?</p>
   <p>    Even if that dif­fi­culty ne­ver ca­me up, the­re was the ima­gi­nary girl to con­si­der. She might not li­ke me. She might li­ke me, but not eno­ugh. She might fall in lo­ve with so­me­one el­se-even Pe­le­nal. He win­ced away from the idea of for­cing a ma­iden to wed be­ca­use she'd be­en bet­rot­hed to him in her crad­le. How co­uld any go­od co­me out of such a bad bar­ga­in?</p>
   <p>    Gel is right. I sho­uld le­ave it up to mot­her, he de­ci­ded, with a slight sin­king of his he­art and a cont­ra­dic­tory fe­eling of re­li­ef. I'll tell her so at din­ner. That sho­uld ma­ke her so happy she'll let us be­si­ege her very bo­wer if we want!</p>

   <p>    As Lynder rep­le­nis­hed the gob­let of co­ol wa­ter at Kyrti­an's right hand, the yo­ung lord so­aked un­til the ac­hes in his ti­red, so­re musc­les eased. He'd ha­ve re­ma­ined in the bath un­til he was in dan­ger of fal­ling as­le­ep, if not for two fac­tors. His sto­mach comp­la­ined that it hadn't got­ten anyt­hing but wa­ter for so­me ti­me, and he knew his mot­her was wa­iting for him to ha­ve din­ner with her and out of po­li­te­ness wo­uld not to­uch a mor­sel un­til he ap­pe­ared. Ser­vants sent off for a plat­ter of fin­ger-fo­ods wo­uld ha­ve ta­ken ca­re of the hun­ger, but he was not go­ing to be ru­de to his mot­her!</p>
   <p>    It isn 't wi­se to be ru­de to one's mot­her. She knows everyt­hing abo­ut yo­ur child­ho­od that is po­ten­ti­al­ly em­bar­ras­sing.</p>
   <p>    Reluctantly, he step­ped up out of the wa­ter, drip­ping on­to the marb­le flo­or, and wa­ved off anot­her at­ten­ti­ve ser­vant, ta­king the soft, snowy to­wel the lad held out to him. Wrap­ping the to­wel aro­und him­self, he re­tur­ned to his bed­ro­om to find clot­hing la­id out over a stand and wa­iting for him to don. This clot­hing had be­en se­lec­ted by Lynder to comp­le­ment wha­te­ver his mot­her was we­aring for din­ner. It was a small ges­tu­re, but one that his mot­her ap­pre­ci­ated, and it only cost a lit­tle ext­ra at­ten­ti­on on the part of the ser­vants; such at­ten­ti­on was no bur­den to them, for she was as be­lo­ved to her staff as she was to her son.</p>
   <p>    To his re­li­ef, the wa­iting clot­hing was ca­su­al, a com­for­tab­le tu­nic and trews of he­avy am­ber silk with a simp­le ge­omet­ric de­sign in bron­ze be­ad­work trim­ming the col­lar and belt. That me­ant his mot­her was in a ca­su­al mo­od; in fact, with any luck, she had ar­ran­ged to di­ne on the bal­cony out­si­de the les­ser di­ning-ro­om, whe­re they co­uld watch the­ir hu­man de­pen­dents dan­cing and lis­ten to the­ir mu­sic.</p>
   <p>    He knew, be­ca­use she had told him, that ot­her El­ven­lords generally cho­se to di­ne amid self-cre­ated, fan­tas­tic set­tings bu­ilt of il­lu­si­on, a simp­ler ver­si­on of the il­lu­si­ons he'd se­en at the few El­ven gat­he­rings and fe­tes he had at­ten­ded. He had ne­ver be­en ab­le to fat­hom why they wo­uld wish to do such a thing. How bo­ring must it be, sur­ro­un­ded by so­met­hing so ut­terly cont­rol­led, in which one knew to the mo­ment exactly what wo­uld hap­pen? He pre­fer­red re­al we­at­her, re­al sun­sets, and the spon­ta­ne­ity of li­ve per­for­mers. But then, he'd ne­ver ca­red much for even the most ela­bo­ra­te of il­lu­si­ons, far pre­fer­ring the be­a­uti­es of the re­al world to gos­sa­mer fan­ta­si­es. Even his su­ite held a but sing­le il­lu­si­on, to bring the out­do­ors that he lo­ved in­si­de re­gard­less of we­at­her or se­ason. He had cre­ated an et­he­re­al fo­rest gla­de and wa­ter­fall, il­lu­mi­na­ted in a per­pe­tu­al twi­light, in the cor­ner of his sit­ting ro­om. This il­lu­si­on ope­ned his su­ite and ma­de the ro­om se­em to ex­tend far be­yond the ac­tu­al walls. He co­uld easily ha­ve had a re­al wa­ter­fall put in, but that wo­uld ha­ve ma­de the sit­ting ro­om rat­her mo­re hu­mid than he li­ked. The three ro­oms of his su­ite-sit­ting ro­om, study, and bed­ro­om-we­re ot­her­wi­se all as they had be­en bu­ilt: grey car­pet, whi­te walls and ce­iling, simp­le, unor­na­men­ted fur­nis­hings with fra­mes of pa­le birch-wo­od and fat cus­hi­ons in grey-blue, grey-gre­en, and sla­te-grey. So­ur­ce­less, gent­le light bat­hed the ro­oms, but co­uld be ex­tin­gu­is­hed with a sing­le com­mand-ma­gic, yes, but hardly il­lu­si­on.</p>
   <p>    He don­ned the soft, com­for­tab­le silk gar­ments, slip­ped on a pa­ir of but­tery le­at­her in­do­or bo­ots and bel­ted the tu­nic with a matc­hing sash. Af­ter a qu­ick glan­ce at him­self in a mir­ror to en­su­re that he had not for­got­ten anyt­hing, he set out for the di­ning-cham­bers, le­aving the ser­vants to cle­an up be­hind him. The sa­me so­ur­ce­less light as brigh­te­ned his ro­oms il­lu­mi­na­ted the hal­lways who­se only or­na­ments we­re small tab­les pla­ced at in­ter­vals aga­inst the wall. He no­ted with ap­pro­val that now that it was sum­mer, so­me­one had rep­la­ced the sta­tu­es that had sto­od on each tab­le with ar­ran­ge­ments of flo­wers which gently scen­ted the air wit­ho­ut be­ing clo­ying. So much bet­ter than all the in­cen­se and he­avy per­fu­mes he'd en­co­un­te­red in the few ot­her ma­nors he'd oc­ca­si­onal­ly vi­si­ted! His mot­her ma­de li­fe he­re in­to an art form, so­met­hing that ap­pe­ared ef­fort­less and was anyt­hing but. It re­qu­ired a small army of the­ir fa­ith­ful ser­vants, wor­king in ca­re­ful har­mony, to ac­hi­eve the "simp­le" ef­fects that ot­hers cre­ated with il­lu­si­ons.</p>
   <p>    As he ap­pro­ac­hed the di­ning cham­bers, the light subtly chan­ged, gro­wing war­mer in to­ne, and the flo­wer ar­ran­ge­ments he­re we­re no lon­ger ma­de up of blo­oms of whi­te and pa­le pas­tels, but of ric­her co­lors. This was cle­arly the work of his mot­her's hand and mind. The imp­res­si­on now cre­ated was that of che­er and wel­co­me, and he no­ted pro­udly that on­ce aga­in, it was ac­comp­lis­hed wit­ho­ut the use of a sing­le il­lu­si­on.</p>
   <p>    Lynder wa­ited pa­ti­ently out­si­de the do­or of the les­ser di­ning-cham­ber, con­fir­ming Kyrti­an's gu­ess that he and his mot­her wo­uld be di­ning wit­ho­ut the com­pany of any of the ot­her El­ves of the es­ta­te. Lynder ope­ned the bron­ze-edged do­or for him, and he pas­sed thro­ugh with a nod of thanks. Sub­du­ed ligh­ting and an empty tab­le gre­eted him, and the open ca­se­ment do­or to the bal­cony be­yond bec­ko­ned him on­ward.</p>
   <p>    Out on the ala­bas­ter bal­cony, a pa­ir of bron­ze lamps ga­ve just eno­ugh light to be use­ful wit­ho­ut be­ing obt­ru­si­ve. A ser­vant with a cart la­den with co­ve­red dis­hes wa­ited be­si­de a small tab­le flan­ked by two cha­irs. His mot­her ro­se from the furt­hest of the­se as he step­ped on­to the bal­cony, and held out her hand to him with a wel­co­ming smi­le.</p>
   <p>    V'dyll Lydi­ell Lady Pras­ta­ran was not the most be­a­uti­ful of El­ven wo­men; her gre­en eyes we­re a to­uch too shrewd, her che­ek­bo­nes too sharply de­fi­ned, her mo­uth at on­ce too ge­ne­ro­us and too sar­do­nic, her wing­li­ke eyeb­rows too inc­li­ned to arc up­wards in wry amu­se­ment. Her fi­gu­re was too slight to be cal­led "ge­ne­ro­us," and too mus­cu­lar to be cal­led "de­li­ca­te"; in fact, she was a no­tab­le dan­cer and ath­le­te. And she was too tall for the cur­rent fas­hi­on, with fully as much he­ight as her son. To­night her mo­on-pa­le ha­ir was ca­ught at the back of her he­ad in a sing­le, prac­ti­cal knot, only re­li­eved by three strands of bron­ze, mo­ons­to­ne and am­ber be­ads thre­aded on­to slen­der locks of ha­ir be­hind her left ear. Her clot­hing was vir­tu­al­ly iden­ti­cal to her son's, ex­cept that she wo­re a di­vi­ded skirt ins­te­ad of trews. She fol­lo­wed no fas­hi­ons, and set no­ne; she was a law un­to her­self, and as such, fit the Pras­ta­ran es­ta­te and clan per­fectly.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian to­ok her hand, drop­ped a fi­li­al kiss on it, and as­sis­ted her back in­to her se­at be­fo­re ta­king his own. He snif­fed ap­pre­ci­ati­vely at the sa­vory scents ari­sing from the first dish as the ser­vant un­co­ve­red a thick so­up and of­fe­red it for the­ir ap­pro­val.</p>
   <p>    Lydiell to­ok the lad­le her­self, and me­asu­red out two por­ce­la­in bowls full. "I've al­re­ady qu­iz­zed Lynder, so I know that you be­at Gel," she sa­id with amu­se­ment. "And I al­so know that he ma­na­ged to kill you in the pro­cess of be­ating him. A rat­her du­bi­o­us vic­tory, don't you think?"</p>
   <p>    "I sup­po­se it wo­uld de­pend on whet­her you we­re the cap­ta­in who was kil­led or the ge­ne­ral who sent him," Kyrti­an po­in­ted out. "My ima­gi­nary su­pe­ri­or wo­uld ha­ve no re­ason to be un­hap­py abo­ut the out­co­me of our bat­tle."</p>
   <p>    Lydiell ma­de a lit­tle gri­ma­ce of dis­tas­te. "Yo­ur not-so-ima­gi­nary re­la­ti­ons wo­uld eit­her be very gri­eved or very ple­ased if yo­ur de­mi­se had be­en ge­nu­ine," she co­un­te­red. "Yo­ur ob­no­xi­o­us co­usin Ael­mar­kin in par­ti­cu­lar-"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian knew what was co­ming, and this ti­me de­ci­ded to pre­empt the lit­tle spe­ech abo­ut his duty to the le­gacy left to him by his fat­her. "My ob­no­xi­o­us co­usin in par­ti­cu­lar is go­ing to be very wnhappy as so­on as you fi­nish the pro­j­ect I'd li­ke you to un­der­ta­ke, Lady-Mot­her," he in­ter­rup­ted, tap­ping her hand play­ful­ly with his in­dex fin­ger. "I want you to go hunt me out a co­up­le of su­itab­le fe­ma­les so I can ma­ke a se­lec­ti­on for a bri­de. I'd li­kely only bung­le the job; you, ho­we­ver, will ma­na­ge it bril­li­antly."</p>
   <p>    Lydiell sta­red at him with her mo­uth slightly open, her eyes wi­de and her eyeb­rows arc­hed as high as they wo­uld go. "Are you se­ri­o­us?" she de­man­ded. "Are you re­al­ly re­ady to wed?"</p>
   <p>    She didn't say "at last" but she didn't ha­ve to.</p>
   <p>    He shrug­ged. "As re­ady as I am ever li­kely to be, and with all the un­rest abo­ut, it wo­uld pro­bably be bet­ter to get it over with be­fo­re it be­co­mes im­pos­sib­le for you to tra­vel aro­und to find me so­me­one."</p>
   <p>    Lydiell's exp­res­si­on as­su­med a fa­int cast of gu­ilt. "I swo­re to your fat­her I wo­uld ne­ver pres­su­re you in­to mar­rying so­me­one for whom you had no af­fec­ti­on," she be­gan. "And-"</p>
   <p>    "And you aren't go­ing to now," he rep­li­ed firmly. "I've just got­ten over the ex­pec­ta­ti­on that the per­fect wo­man will so­me­how drop out of the sky on gos­sa­mer wings, emer­ge ni­xi­eli­ke from the ri­ver, or ma­te­ri­ali­ze spi­rit-wi­se out of the fo­rest, and ma­ke me fall in­to pas­si­ona­te lo­ve with her. A girl who won't be­co­me a risk for us is far mo­re im­por­tant, and you're the best jud­ge of that. So far as my own ne­eds are con­cer­ned, so­me­one I can to­le­ra­te over bre­ak­fast will do ni­cely. If we ha­ve so­me things in com­mon so that we don't baf­fle or bo­re each ot­her, bet­ter still." He put his hand over his mot­her's as it res­ted on the tab­le, and he felt it tremb­le. "To my mind, it is far mo­re im­por­tant that she fe­el lo­ve and af­fec­ti­on for you, my lady."</p>
   <p>    "If you fo­und a wi­fe whom you lo­ved but who didn't ca­re for me, I co­uld al­ways re­ti­re to the Do­wa­ger-Ho­use," she be­gan bra­vely, but he sho­ok his he­ad.</p>
   <p>    "I know Grand­mot­her lo­ved the Do­wa­ger-Ho­use and re­ti­red the­re be­ca­use she fo­und too many me­mo­ri­es in the­se halls, but that won't be the ca­se for you. I co­uldn't ca­re for an­yo­ne who dro­ve you out of yo­ur own ho­me, so I rely on you to find me so­me­one sen­sib­le. I will be happy with sa­fety, sen­se, and in­tel­li­gen­ce, in that or­der. Now," he con­ti­nu­ed, se­e­ing the light in her eyes and de­ci­ding to ta­ke ad­van­ta­ge of the si­tu­ati­on, "Gel and I want to sta­ge anot­her ho­li­day-bat­tle, and we tho­ught we'd ha­ve a si­ege of the Do­wa­ger-Ho­use ins­te­ad of the usu­al wo­ods-bat­tle or fi­eld-me­lee. Do you think we co­uld ar­ran­ge that?"</p>
   <p>    As su­rely as if he had the hu­man ma­gic for re­ading tho­ughts, he knew she was eng­ros­sed in run­ning over the va­ri­o­us mat­ri­mo­ni­al pos­si­bi­li­ti­es in her mind, and that the mo­ment he had sa­id Gel's na­me, she dis­mis­sed the rest of the sen­ten­ce as ir­re­le­vant to the all-impor­tant task of match­ma­king. "Oh, cer­ta­inly," she sa­id ab­sently, al­lo­wing the ser­vant to ta­ke away her so­up and ser­ve her a por­ti­on of ba­ked eel, a dish she nor­mal­ly ne­ver to­uc­hed. She ate it, too, ta­king da­inty but ra­pid bi­tes, all of her tho­ughts oc­cu­pi­ed with mo­re im­por­tant things than fo­od.</p>
   <p>    He grin­ned to him­self, and de­vo­ured his own por­ti­on wit­ho­ut furt­her com­ment, cong­ra­tu­la­ting him­self on his cle­ver ma­neuver. He'd got­ten her ap­pro­val of the si­ege-which she wo­uld be­la­tedly re­mem­ber, so­me ti­me la­te to­night as she went over the din­ner con­ver­sa­ti­on in her mind. By that ti­me it wo­uld be too la­te to ret­ract the ap­pro­val. And it hadn't cost him anyt­hing ot­her than so­met­hing he'd al­re­ady ma­de up his mind to do. Sa­tis­fac­ti­on ga­ve him a he­arty ap­pe­ti­te, and he enj­oyed every bi­te of his din­ner.</p>
   <p>    Down be­low the bal­cony, the lawn stretc­hed out in a plush, vel­vety slo­pe for so­me dis­tan­ce be­fo­re it flat­te­ned out and be­ca­me the vil­la­ge gre­en sha­red by all of the hu­man ser­vants who had ear­ned cot­ta­ges in the ma­nor-vil­la­ge. Sur­ro­un­ded by lan­terns sus­pen­ded from stands plun­ged in­to the turf, it was bril­li­antly and fes­ti­vely il­lu­mi­na­ted. The gre­en ser­ved as fa­irg­ro­unds, dan­ce-flo­or, and fe­ast-tab­le in fi­ne we­at­her, and it ser­ved the lat­ter two pur­po­ses to­night. The war­ri­ors, vic­to­ri­o­us and de­fe­ated both, ce­leb­ra­ted at long wo­oden tab­les that had be­en car­ri­ed out from the­ir bar­racks. Ot­her ser­vants and fi­eld-wor­kers, the­ir din­ners long over, slowly ca­me by gro­ups of two and three to jo­in the fun. Fes­ti­ve torc­hes bur­ned brightly at eit­her end of each tab­le, and a lit­tle band of mu­si­ci­ans had set up at the far end and pla­yed ra­uco­us dan­cing-tu­nes that we­re un­li­ke anyt­hing ever he­ard at an El­ven ce­leb­ra­ti­on. Kyrti­an rat­her li­ked hu­man mu­sic, him­self, and he knew his mot­her was amu­sed by it-but to com­pa­re hu­man to El­ven mu­sic wo­uld be li­ke com­pa­ring a no­isy fo­rest stre­am to an il­lu­mi­na­ted wa­ter-sculp­tu­re. They we­re both ma­de of mo­ving wa­ter, but with that all re­semb­lan­ce en­ded.</p>
   <p>    Gel and a do­zen ot­hers had al­re­ady fi­nis­hed the­ir din­ner and fo­und them­sel­ves part­ners, and we­re dan­cing with gre­at ent­hu­si­asm and aban­don, if not skill. From the rosy che­eks and spark­ling eyes of the girls, no­ne of the part­ners we­re inc­li­ned to comp­la­in if the­ir to­es got trod­den on, oc­ca­si­onal­ly. Kyrti­an fi­nis­hed his me­al in si­len­ce, and set­tled back in his cha­ir with a glass of wi­ne, watc­hing the swirl and cha­os of the ever-incre­asing crowd of dan­cers.</p>
   <p>    "About yo­ur ob­no­xi­o­us co­usin-" Lydi­ell mur­mu­red unex­pec­tedly, start­ling him.</p>
   <p>    "What abo­ut him?" Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, glan­cing at her. "He doesn't want to vi­sit aga­in, do­es he? I tho­ught we'd ma­na­ged to cu­re him of that af­ter the last ti­me."</p>
   <p>    Lydiell win­ced. "It al­most cu­red me of wan­ting to stay he­re," she sa­id, shud­de­ring. "If I'd had to sit thro­ugh one mo­re eve­ning of yo­u­Jro­ning in that flat vo­ice-! You'd ha­ve ma­de ero­tic po­etry un­be­arably dull with that vo­ice!"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian grin­ned. "I tho­ught the mo­no­to­ne went with the su­bj­ect mat­ter. You can thank Gel for that, by the way. I had no idea he knew so much abo­ut the tac­ti­cal im­por­tan­ce of camp supply and sa­ni­ta­ti­on; by the ti­me he was do­ne fil­ling my he­ad with the in­for­ma­ti­on, I co­uld ha­ve writ­ten a mo­nog­raph on the su­bj­ect."</p>
   <p>    "Remind me to ha­ve him ser­ved a ni­ce dish of li­ve scor­pi­ons," she sa­id, with a to­uch of exas­pe­ra­ti­on. "He might ha­ve ta­ken ca­re to re­call that I was go­ing to ha­ve to en­du­re that eve­ning too! But, to go back to the su­bj­ect-no, yo­ur co­usin Ael-mar­kin has no in­ten­ti­on of vi­si­ting. Evi­dently, ho­we­ver, he do­es want to ma­ke up for trying to di­sin­he­rit you."</p>
   <p>    "Oh, re­al­ly?" Kyrti­an felt his eyeb­rows ri­sing in an imi­ta­ti­on of his mot­her's most sar­do­nic exp­res­si­on. "How fra­ter­nal of him. What, exactly, do­es he want?"</p>
   <p>    Lydiell's fa­ce ga­ve no hint of her fe­elings. "He wants you to vi­sit. He's in­vi­ted you to a-a gat­he­ring, of sorts. Lord Mart­hi­en and Lord Wyvar­na are set­tling the­ir dis­pu­te at his es­ta­te."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian was unp­le­asantly surp­ri­sed. "Two Gre­at Lords are set­tling a fe­ud and Ael­mar­kin wants me the­re? Wha­te­ver for?"</p>
   <p>    Lydiell sho­ok her he­ad. "I don't know," she rep­li­ed, so­un­ding ho­nestly perp­le­xed. "Per­haps he has de­ci­ded he sho­uld chan­ge his be­ha­vi­or, in the ho­pe you'll for­get his pe­ti­ti­on. Or for­gi­ve it, at le­ast."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian ma­de a so­ur fa­ce. "Per­haps he just wants to show the Gre­at Lords that I'm as cra­zed as my fat­her. Af­ter all, I ha­ve the sa­me ob­ses­si­on with the past that fat­her did. He's pro­bably ho­ping I'll start dro­ning abo­ut Eve­lon his­tory, or as­king if any of them ha­ve an­ci­ent bo­oks in the­ir lib­ra­ri­es that I co­uld ha­ve co­pi­ed."</p>
   <p>    "Darthenian wasn't cra­zed," Lydi­ell sa­id softly. "And ne­it­her are you. It isn't mad­ness to be con­cer­ned abo­ut the past-it's mad­ness to try and pre­tend it ne­ver hap­pe­ned. Lo­ok at the si­tuation the Gre­at Lords ha­ve cre­ated-at war with the­ir own sons! If they had re­mem­be­red the past, and the fe­uds that sent us fle­e­ing Eve­lon in the first pla­ce, they might ha­ve avo­ided this tra­gedy."</p>
   <p>    "I so­me­ti­mes won­der if it isn't a lit­tle mad to pur­sue the past so re­lent­les­sly," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, his mo­od sud­denly sha­do­wed. "Why el­se wo­uld fat­her ha­ve di­sap­pe­ared?"</p>
   <p>    Lydiell's che­eks flus­hed de­li­ca­tely with an­ger, but she did not gi­ve re­in to it. "Why el­se?" she as­ked, and ans­we­red the qu­es­ti­on her­self, for­ce­ful­ly. "A com­bi­na­ti­on of de­di­ca­ti­on and bad luck-or, per­haps, the ac­qu­isi­ti­on of a ruth­less enemy. I don't know what Dart­he­ni­an was hun­ting when he va­nis­hed, my lo­ve, for he kept it a sec­ret even from me, but I do know that it was im­por­tant and po­ten­ti­al­ly very po­wer­ful. That ma­de the sec­ret a dan­ge­ro­us one, and that was why he kept it from me. It is pos­sib­le that he met with an ac­ci­dent. It is al­so pos­sib­le that so­me­one be­si­des me to­ok him se­ri­o­usly-and wis­hed to le­arn what he knew, or pre­vent him from dis­co­ve­ring anyt­hing that might ha­ve gi­ven him an ed­ge in the end­less jost­ling for po­wer."</p>
   <p>    "Are you sug­ges­ting that he was-mur­de­red?" Kyrti­an as­ked slowly. It was so­met­hing that had ne­ver oc­cur­red to him.</p>
   <p>    Lydiell sig­hed. "I don't know. It is pos­sib­le-but I can­not even gu­ess at how li­kely it is. I ha­ve ne­ver se­en or he­ard anyt­hing to al­low me to dis­miss the idea, or that con­fir­med it." Her exp­res­si­on was ha­un­ted by that very un­cer­ta­inty. "Ne­vert­he­less, let ot­hers re­mem­ber him as an uns­tab­le dab­bler for del­ving in­to the ol­dest of our re­cords-I know bet­ter, and so sho­uld you."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian im­me­di­ately felt as­ha­med, and bent his he­ad in mu­te apo­logy. "And I sho­uld not al­low the vi­ews of V'kel Ael­mar­kin er-Lord Tor­nal to sha­de my opi­ni­on of even so tri­vi­al a qu­es­ti­on as wi­ne se­lec­ti­on, much less anyt­hing im­por­tant." He frow­ned. "I've half a mind to turn his in­vi­ta­ti­on down. It's co­me too qu­ickly on the Co­un­cil's de­ci­si­on, and Ael­mar­kin is not­hing if not per­sis­tent. He su­rely has so­met­hing plan­ned as an at­tempt to em­bar­rass me."</p>
   <p>    But Lydi­ell sho­ok her he­ad. "That, you mustn't do. He has mo­re po­li­ti­cal po­wer than you, and he co­uld ma­ke things dif­ficult if you of­fend him. Do you re­al­ly want to was­te yo­ur ti­me co­un­te­ring his petty nas­ti­ness with the Co­un­cil, when you co­uld avo­id ha­ving to do so by at­ten­ding his gat­he­ring?"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian sig­hed, kno­wing with re­sig­na­ti­on that he was go­ing to ha­ve to go and play the fo­ol to ke­ep Ael­mar­kin happy. "Not re­al­ly. When is this far­ce sche­du­led?"</p>
   <p>    "In three days," Lydi­ell told him, and pat­ted his hand com­for­tingly. "Che­er up," she of­fe­red. "It's only for an af­ter­no­on. How hard can it be to ma­in­ta­in yo­ur com­po­su­re for an af­ter­no­on?"</p>
   <p>    How hard can it be to ma­in­ta­in my com­po­su­re for an af­ter­no­on? Kyrti­an as­ked him­self sa­va­gely, as he gla­red down at the sands of the are­na to avo­id me­eting any mo­re con­temp­tu­o­us or amu­sed glan­ces. Har­der than get­ting the bet­ter of Gel in a sword-bo­ut, that's how!</p>
   <p>    From the mo­ment he'd step­ped out of the Por­tal in­to Ael-mar­kin's ma­nor, he'd re­ali­zed two things. The first: Lydi­ell had be­en ab­so­lu­tely right; if he hadn't shown his fa­ce-and his sa­nity-at this func­ti­on, Ael­mar­kin wo­uld ha­ve be­en ab­le to say wha­te­ver he li­ked and be be­li­eved. The se­cond: it was go­ing to stress his pa­ti­en­ce and his ac­ting abi­lity to the li­mit to put up with the at­ti­tu­de of every ot­her gu­est that Ael­mar­kin had in­vi­ted. He had ne­ver felt so ut­terly out-of-pla­ce in his li­fe. Why, he had mo­re in com­mon with the hu­mans of his es­ta­te than he did the­se stran­ge cre­atu­res of his own ra­ce!</p>
   <p>    A gre­at many of them we­re ap­pro­xi­ma­tely his age-much yo­un­ger than Ael­mar­kin-the id­le of­fsp­ring of Gre­at Lords who didn't ca­re to at­tend this par­ti­cu­lar chal­len­ge-fight them­sel­ves, but wan­ted to send rep­re­sen­ta­ti­ves. Of co­ur­se this me­ant that he was sur­ro­un­ded by tho­se with lit­tle to do ex­cept chat­ter abo­ut ot­hers of the­ir set, cur­rent fads, use­less pas­ti­mes, and new fas­hi­ons. The pe­op­le of the­ir so­ci­al set we­re pe­op­le he didn't know anyt­hing abo­ut, and the pur­su­its they fo­und so im­por­tant-well, he co­uldn't ima­gi­ne why an­yo­ne wo­uld was­te ti­me on such things. But in the­ir eyes, he was cle­arly im­pos­sibly back­ward, out-of-step, and pro­vin­ci­al.</p>
   <p>    None of them knew anyt­hing abo­ut any of the su­bj­ects he ca­red abo­ut, which ma­de him so­und both a bo­re and a bo­or.</p>
   <p>    And af­ter he'd shown a flic­ker of start­le­ment at sta­te­ments he con­si­de­red out­ra­ge­o­us, they pro­bably put him down as cal­low and a prig.</p>
   <p>    Well, by the­ir stan­dards, I am a prig. I don't con­si­der an af­ter­no­on spent in ha­ving my jaded ap­pe­ti­tes aro­used by po­or hu­man girls who only exist to ser­ve as my con­cu­bi­nes to be par­ti­cu­larly amu­sing.</p>
   <p>    After the first ho­ur, they snub­bed him openly, and with un­ve­iled con­tempt.</p>
   <p>    This, stran­gely eno­ugh, ma­de him very un­com­for­tab­le. He hadn't ex­pec­ted them to ma­ke him fe­el that way. He co­uld try to tell him­self that the­se pe­op­le didn't mat­ter, that all he had to do was re­ma­in po­li­te and com­port him­self li­ke a gent­le­man and not­hing they re­por­ted back to the­ir fat­hers wo­uld do any harm-but that didn't ma­ke the sne­ers and the snig­ge­ring any easi­er to be­ar. He didn't li­ke them, but they we­re many and he was one; it was all too easy to fe­el the hurt of the scor­ned out­si­der. He truly hadn't an­ti­ci­pa­ted that sort of re­ac­ti­on from him­self, and he wis­hed the­re was a way he co­uld gra­ce­ful­ly ext­ri­ca­te him­self and go ho­me.</p>
   <p>    As he sta­red fi­xedly down at the wo­oden-wal­led are­na be­low him, he he­ard whis­pers be­hind him, and snic­ke­ring, and felt the back of his neck grow hot. He was just glad that Gel was he­re with him, in the ro­le of body­gu­ard; so­me­how it was easi­er to stay com­po­sed with Gel's sto­ne-fa­ced examp­le to copy.</p>
   <p>    I'm on the­ir cho­ice of gro­und; the best I can ho­pe to do is get out of this wit­ho­ut ma­king any ma­j­or blun­ders. Mot­her co­uldn 't pos­sibly ha­ve known how slip­pery this si­tu­ati­on co­uld be­co­me. He was acu­tely awa­re that they had far mo­re ex­pe­ri­en­ce than he at the ma­ne­uve­ring of int­ri­gue and po­li­tics. He felt hor­ribly yo­ung, shal­low, and na­ive; the­se pe­op­le had drunk mac­hi­na­ti­on with the­ir first milk, and he had no idea how to de­al with si­tu­ati­ons they wo­uldn't even he­si­ta­te over.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian had ta­ken a se­at in the first row to avo­id me­eting the­ir eyes any lon­ger, but they con­ti­nu­ed to spe­ak to each ot­her in vo­ices pitc­hed for him to over­he­ar, ta­un­ting him to res­pond.</p>
   <p>    "Who, exactly, is this fel­low?" as­ked an ar­ro­gant yo­ung ma­le a lit­tle to Kyrti­an's left.</p>
   <p>    "My co­usin Kyrti­an," Ael­mar­kin sa­id lightly. "Son of the la­te Lord Dart­he­ni­an, my unc­le."</p>
   <p>    "Lord Dart­he­ni­an…" so­me­one mur­mu­red be­hind him. "That na­me so­unds fa­mi­li­ar. Don't I know it from so­me old story or ot­her?"</p>
   <p>    "Try co­up­ling the na­me with daft," draw­led anot­her, so­un­ding so smug that it was all Kyrti­an co­uld do to ke­ep from stan­ding up and go­ing for the fel­low's thro­at. "Daft Dart­he­ni­an, pot-hun­ter, ex­ca­va­tor of things bet­ter left bu­ri­ed, and pur­su­er of use­less old ma­nusc­ripts. Mis­sing in pur­su­it of sa­me, and pre­su­med de­ad, oh, de­ca­des ago."</p>
   <p>    "Now, Fe­ra­hi­ne, the­re's not­hing wrong with ha­ving a hobby," rep­li­ed Ael­mar­kin, in a to­ne so to­le­rant that Kyrti­an clenc­hed his hands on the arm­rests of his cha­ir to ke­ep him­self in his se­at. "Isn't in­sect-col­lec­ting as silly? I've se­en you send sla­ves out bob­bing abo­ut in fi­elds and fo­rests with a net and a bot­tle-and all tho­se bo­xes of de­ad be­et­les are just as use­less as un­re­adab­le ma­nusc­ripts!"</p>
   <p>    "Point ta­ken. Still, hob­bi­es are all very well, Ael­mar­kin," sa­id the draw­ler, "But no gent­le­man and no sa­ne fel­low go­es off him­self to dig up nasty old dis­cards in parts unk­nown, now, do­es he? I cer­ta­inly don't go ramb­ling thro­ugh bri­ars with nets and bot­tles! That's what sla­ves are for! And he went out alo­ne, too! Why, that was simply in­sa­ne, if you ask me."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian grit­ted his te­eth. He knew he was me­ant to over­he­ar all of this. He knew they we­re trying to pro­vo­ke him. And they we­re only sa­ying in his he­aring what they told each ot­her-and what the­ir el­ders sa­id. If he just kept his tem­per, he wo­uld le­arn a gre­at de­al. If they tho­ught he was too dull to un­ders­tand-or too co­wardly to res­pond-what pos­sib­le harm co­uld it do?</p>
   <p>    Still, it was the har­dest thing he had ever do­ne, to sit the­re and let stran­gers abu­se the me­mory of his own fat­her, wit­ho­ut chal­len­ging them.</p>
   <p>    "Alone!" exc­la­imed the first spe­aker. "Why didn't he ta­ke sla­ves, if he wo­uldn't send them to do his hun­ting for him? Ael­mar­kin, ad­mit it, he must ha­ve be­en de­ran­ged!"</p>
   <p>    There was an audib­le rust­le of fab­ric, mar­king Ael­mar­kin's ca­re­less shrug. "He was al­ways sec­re­ti­ve abo­ut the­se hunts of his, and ne­ver mo­re so than on the last one. He was hun­ting the si­te of the Gre­at Ga­te that bro­ught us from Eve­lon, and the things that we­re dis­car­ded as use­less be­ca­use they no lon­ger func­ti­oned af­ter pas­sing the Ga­te. Why? I ha­ven't a no­ti­on."</p>
   <p>    "Yes, well, it's ob­vi­o­us he was an ob­ses­si­ve, at the very le­ast," sa­id the draw­ler, dis­mis­si­vely. "And jud­ging from the di­sas­ter of a con­ver­sa­ti­on I had with Kyrti­an, yon­der, ob­ses­si­on runs in the fa­mily blo­od. All the po­or fo­ol can talk abo­ut is mi­li­tary mat­ters! His­tory, tac­tics, bat­tles no one ca­res abo­ut." A sne­er crept in­to the drawl. "As if an­yo­ne wo­uld ever gi­ve the li­kes of him com­mand over so much as a squ­ad of lat­ri­ne-dig­gers."</p>
   <p>    By now Kyrti­an's neck bur­ned, his che­eks we­re ne­arly the sa­me tem­pe­ra­tu­re, and his jaw and sho­ul­ders ac­hed with the stra­in of tightly-clenc­hed musc­les. He gladly wo­uld ha­ve gi­ven half his pos­ses­si­ons for the op­por­tu­nity to co­me at any of tho­se fop­pish fo­ols in ba­re­han­ded com­bat!</p>
   <p>    And that's just what they ex­pect from you, he re­min­ded him­self, trying men­tal­ly to throw a lit­tle cold wa­ter on his over­he­ated tem­per. They think you 're an ata­vis­tic bar­ba­ri­an, and they may very well be wa­iting for you to stand up and at­tack them physi­cal­ly! They wo­uld ha­ve the right to chal­len­ge you or bring you up in front of the Gre­at Co­un­cil.</p>
   <p>    And that, be­yond a sha­dow of a do­ubt, was what Ael­mar­kin wan­ted him to do, for such an at­tack wo­uld pro­ve to ever­yo­ne's sa­tis­fac­ti­on that he, Kyrti­an, was just as mad as Ael­mar­kin cla­imed in his pe­ti­ti­on. An El­ven­lord and a gent­le­man did not set­tle dif­fe­ren­ces hand-to-hand. An El­ven­lord and a gent­le­man is­su­ed a pro­per chal­len­ge, and set­tled it as this fe­ud was be­ing set­tled.</p>
   <p>    I ha­ve to ke­ep my mo­uth clo­sed and my eyes open and find out just how the­se things work! he told him­self ve­he­mently. So that if I get a chan­ce, I can ar­ran­ge for the­se fo­ols to eat the­ir words wit­ho­ut salt!</p>
   <p>    Beside him, Gel sto­od at wary at­ten­ti­on, as im­pas­si­ve as any sta­tue, and as in­vi­sib­le to the­se fo­ols as any ot­her body­gu­ard. Gel had he­ard every word, too-but you wo­uld ne­ver know it by lo­oking at him.</p>
   <p>    Copy Gel, he told him­self. Stay qu­i­et, if not calm. Wa­it, and watch. He knew only that the­se fe­uds we­re set­tled in tri­al-by-com­bat, using sla­ves as pro­xi­es. If his figh­ters we­re bet­ter-tra­ined than the­se-</p>
   <p>    Then it might be worth de­aling with the­se dolts in a way they 'II un­ders­tand.</p>
   <p>    Abruptly, con­ver­sa­ti­on be­hind him ce­ased, as so­me sig­nal he didn't re­cog­ni­ze war­ned the id­lers that the com­bat was abo­ut to be­gin. Ab­ruptly ca­ught up in spi­te of him­self, Kyrti­an le­aned for­ward with the rest, as the light in the are­na brigh­te­ned, and the lights abo­ve the­ir se­ats dim­med.</p>

   <p>    Two bron­ze do­ors, one at each end of the are­na and de­co­ra­ted with ham­me­red ima­ges of ar­mo­red figh­ters, ope­ned on­to the sands of the are­na. Two li­nes of he­avily-equ­ip­ped figh­ters pa­ced thro­ugh them, mo­ving pon­de­ro­usly in­to the light. The­re we­re fo­ur­te­en of the­se hu­mans in all, se­ven to each si­de. One set was ar­mo­red in pa­le gre­en, with a win­ged ser­pent bad­ge in bril­li­ant blue on the­ir bre­astp­la­tes and shi­elds, the ot­her in eme­rald gre­en with the bad­ge of a re­aring ali­corn in whi­te.</p>
   <p>    The ar­mor was imp­res­si­ve; the men in­si­de it we­re less so. Kyrti­an stu­di­ed each of the figh­ters mi­nu­tely, we­ig­hing and me­asu­ring the­ir ge­ne­ral strength, no­ting the kinds of we­apons each man car­ri­ed. He as­su­med that Gel was do­ing the sa­me.</p>
   <p>    "Ancestors!" ca­me anot­her whis­per from be­hind. "What can be so fas­ci­na­ting abo­ut a hand­ful of figh­ters? Is he so pro­vin­ci­al that he's ne­ver se­en gla­di­ators be­fo­re?"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian's neck bur­ned aga­in for a mo­ment, but he cal­med him­self qu­ickly. With so­met­hing be­fo­re him to study and analy­ze, he fi­nal­ly ma­na­ged to think of his own si­tu­ati­on in terms of tac­tics rat­her than emo­ti­ons.</p>
   <p>    Most of them are ta­king me for a pro­vin­ci­al bo­or, but tho­se are the ones who are ig­no­ring me. The com­ments might be co­ming from tho­se who are sus­pi­ci­o­us of me-thin­king that the "pro­vin­ci­al fo­ol" might just be a po­se. They wo­uld be trying to prod me in­to eit­her do­ing so­met­hing typi­cal of a fo­ol-such as lo­se my tem­per and in­sult them back-or to do or say so­met­hing that will gi­ve them mo­re in­for­ma­ti­on abo­ut what I'm re­al­ly he­re for. If I do ne­it­her, I'll con­fu­se them furt­her. It's even pos­sib­le that Ael­mar­kin is be­hind the prod­ding. The pos­sib­le num­ber of plots and co­un­terp­lots go­ing on be­hind his back ma­de him fe­el dizzy.</p>
   <p>    And the­se stran­gers se­emed even mo­re ali­en to him. How did they do it? How co­uld an­yo­ne li­ve li­ke that, spen­ding most of every day in gu­ar­ding aga­inst tre­ac­hery, and the rest in plan­ning tre­ac­hery? It wo­uld dri­ve him mad in no ti­me. He co­uld not ima­gi­ne how they co­ped with the cons­tant pa­ra­no­ia.</p>
   <p>    Perhaps that is why they spend so much ti­me in de­ba­uc­hing them­sel­ves. Only by im­mer­sing them­sel­ves in ple­asu­re can they re­lax for a few mo­ments. If that was so-he felt sud­denly sorry for them. But not too sorry.</p>
   <p>    The best we­apon he had to use aga­inst them was the un­cer­ta­inty he rep­re­sen­ted, the very fact that he was unk­nown. No mat­ter what Ael­mar­kin had told them, they pro­bably wo­uldn't re­al­ly be­li­eve it un­til they had pro­ved for them­sel­ves what he was. They wo­uld tend to jud­ge him aga­inst the stan­dard of the­ir own be­ha­vi­or. What wo­uld one of them do in a si­tu­ati­on si­mi­lar to his? Play the fo­ol? Try and find an ally?</p>
   <p>    Probably lo­ok for an ally or a pro­tec­tor; ho­pe­ful­ly by do­ing ne­it­her, he had con­fu­sed them furt­her. He wis­hed he co­uld talk openly to Gel; of all the ti­mes he ne­eded ad­vi­ce-</p>
   <p>    Then aga­in, Gel might not ha­ve any bet­ter no­ti­on of how to hand­le the­se ef­fe­te cre­atu­res than he did.</p>
   <p>    Well, ot­hers ha­ve mis­ta­ken my ca­uti­on for a lack of ima­gi­na­ti­on in the past-so per­haps that is what is go­ing on now. I can only ho­pe so; it will ma­ke them un­de­res­ti­ma­te me furt­her.</p>
   <p>    All he re­al­ly knew was how such si­tu­ati­ons wo­uld ha­ve be­en hand­led in the far past, as re­co­un­ted in the his­tory bo­oks he spent so much ti­me pe­ru­sing. In the days of long ago, the­re had been less ti­me and le­isu­re for long plots and po­li­ti­cal mac­hi­na­ti­on. The El­ven­lords of old had de­alt with prob­lems with the­ir own kind in ways that "hu­man bar­ba­ri­ans" wo­uld find per­fectly fa­mi­li­ar.</p>
   <p>    If one of the First Lords cho­se to de­al with the in­sults ins­te­ad of ta­mely ac­cep­ting them, he wo­uld ha­ve cal­led his enemy out for a du­el-by-ma­gic.</p>
   <p>    That ma­kes a sa­tisf­ying fan­tasy the­se days as well-pro­vi­ding you pic­tu­re yo­ur­self as the win­ner rat­her than the lo­ser.</p>
   <p>    In law, that was still an op­ti­on, but it was one that very few ever to­ok any­mo­re. Mo­re than ni­nety-ni­ne ti­mes out of a hund­red, in­sults we­re ans­we­red and ar­gu­ments set­tled by proxy, in the are­na, at the hands of hu­man gla­di­ators li­ke the ones be­low. Hardly fa­ir, sin­ce cle­arly so­me­one who­se me­ans we­re li­mi­ted co­uldn't af­ford to ke­ep and tra­in as many figh­ters as so­me­one of gre­ater rank and po­wer, but so­me­one of gre­ater rank and po­wer wo­uld al­so be much stron­ger in ma­gic than a les­ser lord-so it wo­uldn't ma­ke a gre­at de­al of dif­fe­ren­ce to the out­co­me, whet­her it was set­tled by com­bat or ma­gic du­el.</p>
   <p>    It's even pos­sib­le for so­me­one with we­ak ma­gic to be­co­me we­althy eno­ugh to af­ford first-qu­ality figh­ters, or to ga­in an ally with ac­cess to such figh­ters, but not­hing inc­re­ases the po­wer of the ma­gic that so­me­one is born with. I sup­po­se com­bat-by-proxy is mar­gi­nal­ly mo­re fa­ir than com­bat-by-ma­gic.</p>
   <p>    It wo­uldn't be qu­ite as vis­ce­ral­ly sa­tisf­ying, tho­ugh.</p>
   <p>    I won­der how I'd fa­re if I de­ci­ded to chal­len­ge one of the char­mers be­hind me to a ma­gic du­el? Ha­ve any of them even bot­he­red to prac­ti­ce and tra­in the­ir po­wer? The­re was no way of jud­ging how strong they we­re by the way they we­re ac­ting, and he re­al­ly didn't know how strong his ma­gic was in com­pa­ri­son with the­irs. Go­ing in­to such a chal­len­ge blind wo­uld be the stu­pi­dest thing he co­uld do.</p>
   <p>    He didn't use ma­gic ex­cept when the­re was no way to ac­comp­lish so­met­hing wit­ho­ut it. He re­al­ly didn't ha­ve much use for il­lu­si­ons, so he'd ne­ver re­al­ly prac­ti­ced them, but the­re was no re­ason why even an il­lu­si­on co­uldn't be used as a we­apon. Ot­her El­ven­lords se­emed to was­te a gre­at de­al of po­wer on out­ward ap­pe­aran­ces-for ins­tan­ce, as Ael­mar­kin had, tur­ning his manor in­to an im­pos­sib­le con­fec­ti­on that hardly re­semb­led a dwel­ling at all. But was that the was­te that it se­emed to be?</p>
   <p>    Is it a kind of bluff-or even a way of de­monst­ra­ting po­wer wit­ho­ut the risk en­ta­iled by com­bat?</p>
   <p>    For a mo­ment, he felt a flic­ker of con­cern that he hadn't do­ne li­ke­wi­se; sho­uld he ha­ve cre­ated an opu­lent il­lu­sory cos­tu­me li­ke the­irs? What wo­uld the­se pe­op­le think if they saw his una­dor­ned ho­me? Did they think him we­ak, and of lit­tle ac­co­unt, be­ca­use he didn't cre­ate and ma­in­ta­in fan­tas­tic il­lu­si­ons?</p>
   <p>    It do­esn 't mat­ter, he told him­self qu­ickly. No one ever co­mes to vi­sit who ne­eds to be imp­res­sed, and I'm not the only one he­re we­aring or­di­nary clot­hing.</p>
   <p>    He re­min­ded him­self that his sta­tus, and that of his fa­mily, re­ma­ined se­cu­re-be­ca­use they pro­du­ced what ot­hers ne­eded, and they had no po­wer that an­yo­ne el­se co­ve­ted. It was a re­as­su­ring tho­ught, and one that cal­med his new-born con­cerns. He wan­ted to lo­ok harm­less and in­con­se­qu­en­ti­al; he'd ne­arly for­got­ten that. He wan­ted pe­op­le li­ke the­se fri­ends of Ael­mar­kin to un­de­res­ti­ma­te him and his fa­mily.</p>
   <p>    He ga­ve him­self a men­tal sha­ke. The­se pe­op­le we­re con­ta­mi­na­ting him-he hadn't be­en among them for even half a day, and al­re­ady he was thin­king abo­ut chal­len­ges and sta­tus, wor­rying be­ca­use they tho­ught he was a pro­vin­ci­al, in­su­lar bump­kin! So what if they did? That was what kept him and his sa­fe! Let them joc­key with each ot­her he re­min­ded him­self. Let them ig­no­re us. As long as they con­si­der us po­li­ti­cal­ly in­sig­ni­fi­cant, but too use­ful to dis­turb, we 'II re­ma­in se­cu­re and sa­fe.</p>
   <p>    Unless, of co­ur­se, the fa­mily hol­dings lo­oked so pros­pe­ro­us that they be­ca­me a cho­ice plum, ri­pe for pic­king. Cer­ta­inly Ael­mar­kin tho­ught so; was it pos­sib­le that so­me ot­her, mo­re dan­ge­ro­us op­po­nent wo­uld co­me to sha­re that be­li­ef?</p>
   <p>    Perhaps-perhaps he ought to con­sult with Lydi­ell when he re­tur­ned ho­me. May­be it was ti­me to cre­ate a few ca­re­ful­ly-craf­ted bluffs. Lydi­ell was cle­ver; su­rely she wo­uld be ab­le to con­coct an ex­cu­se for Kyrti­an to de­monst­ra­te his po­wers in such a way that wo­uld ma­ke it ap­pe­ar that Kyrti­an had inc­re­dib­le abi­lity. Or, at le­ast, that he had eno­ugh ma­gi­cal po­wer to ma­ke chal­len­ging him mo­re costly than the pri­ze was worth.</p>
   <p>    Something to ma­ke it ap­pe­ar that it isn 't worth up­set­ting the way things are now, that's what we ne­ed. So­met­hing to show that the­re is not­hing to be ga­ined and a gre­at de­al to be lost in a di­rect conf­ron­ta­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    It might be all to his ad­van­ta­ge that most conf­licts we­re set­tled in the are­na. He knew for cer­ta­in that in strength and agi­lity, his own worst figh­ters we­re the equ­al of even the best of the figh­ters down the­re on the sand-and we­re su­pe­ri­or to most of the men wa­iting to fight. If it ca­me to a chal­len­ge-match li­ke this one, Kyrti­an was con­fi­dent that his si­de wo­uld not lo­se.</p>
   <p>    That re­ali­za­ti­on ma­de him re­lax a lit­tle. Re­al­ly, he was wor­rying for no re­ason. As long as is­su­es we­re set­tled by hu­man gla­di­ators li­ke tho­se be­low him, he had not­hing to fe­ar.</p>
   <p>    In fact, the mo­re he stu­di­ed tho­se figh­ters, the mo­re con­fi­dent of that fact he be­ca­me. It was odd; tho­se gla­di­ators all se­emed a go­od bit yo­un­ger than he wo­uld ha­ve ex­pec­ted. This was an im­por­tant match, or so he had be­en led to be­li­eve. So why we­ren't the two an­ta­go­nists fi­el­ding the­ir ol­der, mo­re ex­pe­ri­en­ced gla­di­ators? What is it that Gel says? "Expe­ri­en­ce and dup­li­city will over­co­me yo­uth and energy every ti­me."</p>
   <p>    He had ma­na­ged to lo­se track of what the gos­sips be­hind him we­re chat­te­ring abo­ut whi­le he mul­led over his own si­tu­ati­on and stu­di­ed the com­ba­tants. When he tur­ned a frac­ti­on of his at­ten­ti­on back to them, he dis­co­ve­red they we­re pla­cing bets on the out­co­me, not only of the who­le com­bat, but on the for­tu­nes of in­di­vi­du­al figh­ters. Mildly int­ri­gu­ed, he eavesd­rop­ped wit­ho­ut sha­me.</p>
   <p>    "You must know so­met­hing, if you're bet­ting that high," the draw­ler sa­id sus­pi­ci­o­usly. "Don't ta­ke the bet, Ga­li­ath! He's too con­fi­dent! I think he bri­bed the tra­iners to tell him so­met­hing!"</p>
   <p>    "Nonsense, he do­esn't know anyt­hing-he's just bluf­fing, and I've wan­ted a chan­ce to get that hor­se for ages!" rep­li­ed a new vo­ice, one that Kyrti­an tho­ught was slur­red just a lit­tle with drink. "I'll ta­ke that bet; yo­ur ra­ce­hor­se aga­inst my red-ha­ired con­cu­bi­ne and two jewe­led arm­lets that the one with the two swords draws first blo­od be­fo­re he's mar­ked!"</p>
   <p>    It to­ok a mo­ment for the sen­se of what they we­re sa­ying to sink in, and when it did, he felt a lit­tle sick. The idea of equ­ating the va­lue of a hu­man with that of a hor­se-no, as less than that of the hor­se… it hit him with the for­ce of a blow to the sto­mach just how fo­re­ign the­ir way of thin­king was to his. He'd known it in­tel­lec­tu­al­ly, of co­ur­se, but this was the first conc­re­te examp­le he'd wit­nes­sed. Up un­til now, Ael­mar­kin's sla­ves hadn't be­ha­ved any dif­fe­rently than his own ser­vants at the­ir most disc­re­et.</p>
   <p>    I truly am the ali­en he­re. If they knew how we tre­at our hu­mans, they wo­uldn 't he­si­ta­te for a mo­ment to bring us all down. He wo­uld be con­si­de­red a tra­itor to his ra­ce, and wor­se than the Wi­zards and the wild hu­mans. He had to re­mem­ber to ke­ep his gu­ard up!</p>
   <p>    The two fe­uding par­ti­es fi­nal­ly ar­ri­ved, with gre­at fan­fa­re, at exactly the sa­me mo­ment. With each of the El­ven­lords ca­me an en­to­ura­ge of glit­te­ring, fan­ci­ful­ly-cos­tu­med han­gers-on. The­re we­re box se­ats at eit­her end of the are­na, di­rectly abo­ve the two do­ors that had dis­gor­ged the com­ba­tants; tho­se bo­xes we­re now oc­cu­pi­ed by the newly-arri­ved lords and the­ir en­to­ura­ges. Kyrt-ian fo­und that he co­uld not for the li­fe of him re­mem­ber the­ir na­mes and Ho­uses-not that it re­al­ly mat­te­red to him. He wo­uld, if he was int­ro­du­ced la­ter, cong­ra­tu­la­te the win­ner and be pro­perly sympat­he­tic to the lo­ser. It wasn't li­kely, tho­ugh, that Ael­mar­kin wo­uld ma­ke such an int­ro­duc­ti­on, un­less he tho­ught he had a way of ma­king Kyrti­an lo­se fa­ce.</p>
   <p>    How they to­ok the­ir se­ats and in what or­der was cle­arly as cho­re­og­rap­hed as an ela­bo­ra­te ri­tu­al. Ne­it­her of the Lords wis­hed to be se­ated first, and the­re was much ar­ran­ging of the cha­irs and joc­ke­ying of se­ating be­fo­re the two Gre­at Lords sat at pre­ci­sely the sa­me mo­ment. They gla­red at each ot­her ac­ross the span of the are­na, be­fo­re tur­ning away with stu­di­ed in­dif­fe­ren­ce to spe­ak with a com­pa­ni­on.</p>
   <p>    Now Ael­mar­kin, as host, sto­od up; Kyrti­an ca­ught the mo­ve­ment out of the cor­ner of his eye, and tur­ned j ust eno­ugh so that he co­uld watch his co­usin wit­ho­ut be­ing ob­vi­o­us abo­ut it.</p>
   <p>    "Most nob­le Lords," Ael­mar­kin sa­id, his smo­oth and im­per­so­nal words car­rying ef­fort­les­sly abo­ve the whis­pers of tho­se seated all aro­und him, "You ha­ve de­ter­mi­ned to set­tle yo­ur dif­fe­ren­ces in tri­al-by-com­bat, and ha­ve ac­cep­ted my of­fer to host this ven­tu­re. Are you still of the sa­me mind to ac­cept the out­co­me of this com­bat as the set­tling of yo­ur fe­ud?"</p>
   <p>    He of the azu­re ser­pent rep­li­ed with a gruff, "Aye" whi­le he of the whi­te ali­corn simply nod­ded.</p>
   <p>    "Very well," Ael­mar­kin sa­id calmly. "Let the re­cord show that both ag­ree to be bo­und by the out­co­me he­re be­low us. Let all who ye as­semb­led he­re so be­ar wit­ness."</p>
   <p>    "We so be­ar wit­ness," ca­me a cho­rus of vo­ices, so­me in­dif­fe­rent, sxj­me full of ten­se ex­ci­te­ment. A hush ca­me over them; all whis­pers and mo­ve­ment stop­ped. So pro­fo­und was the si­len­ce that the sligh­test rust­le of fab­ric ca­me as a shock.</p>
   <p>    As if this had be­en a sig­nal, the figh­ters be­low ten­sed.</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin sur­ve­yed the two op­po­sed li­nes of figh­ters for a mo­ment, an odd smi­le on his lips. "Very well," he sa­id at last, in­to the stil­lness. "Be­gin."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian's full at­ten­ti­on im­me­di­ately tur­ned to the are­na. The two li­nes of figh­ters le­apt at each ot­her, hur­ling them­sel­ves ac­ross the sand to me­et in a clan­gor of me­tal and harsh ma­le sho­uts. The no­ise ec­ho­ed in­si­de the are­na, ma­king Kyrti­an win­ce in­vo­lun­ta­rily. Ad­ded to the no­ise of figh­ting was the cla­mor of sho­uts and che­ers be­hind him and to eit­her si­de of him, as the on­lo­okers che­ered the com­ba­tants on.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian was still trying to fi­gu­re out how Ael­mar­kin in­ten­ded to sco­re this com­bat, when the swords­man ne­arest him ma­na­ged to be­at down his op­po­nent's gu­ard and la­id open the ot­her's sword-arm from sho­ul­der to wrist with a sing­le blow.</p>
   <p>    The rnan scre­amed, and drop­ped to his kne­es, a tor­rent of shoc­kingly scar­let blo­od po­uring from the wo­und in­to the sand as his bla­de fell from his slack fin­gers.</p>
   <p>    For one mo­ment, Kyrti­an was start­led by how re­alis­tic the wo­und was-then he re­ali­zed that it wasn't "re­alis­tic," it was re­al.</p>
   <p>    He felt as if so­me­one had ram­med him in the mid­sec­ti­on and knoc­ked all the bre­ath out of him. He star­ted to sha­ke, as a wa­ve of sick hor­ror twis­ted his thro­at and sto­mach.</p>
   <p>    It's re­al-it's re­al. They're trying to re­al­ly kill each ot­her.</p>
   <p>    They 're dying, and all so a co­up­le of idi­ots can set­tle an ar­gu­ment! Sen­se­less-use­less-insa­ne!</p>
   <p>    Then, stran­gely, it all dis­sol­ved un­der a flo­od of blin­ding ra­ge. He lost ca­uti­on, lost fo­cus, lost everyt­hing ex­cept the will to ma­ke it all stop. He ro­se ab­ruptly to his fe­et.</p>
   <p>    "No!" he sho­uted, spre­ading his arms wi­de, his vo­ice so­me­how car­rying abo­ve the no­ise of com­bat. His po­wers, le­aping to ans­wer his will, po­ured out; an angry and vi­olent burst of ma­gic to­re out of him.</p>
   <p>    It flung the com­ba­tants to the­ir own si­des of the are­na, and drop­ped every man in the are­na to his kne­es-except the inj­ured one, who was fran­ti­cal­ly trying to clo­se his ga­ping wo­und with his go­od hand.</p>
   <p>    The sud­den si­len­ce, he­avy with an­ger, se­emed lo­uder than his sho­ut.</p>
   <p>    For a mo­ment, no one mo­ved-no one se­emed ab­le to be­li­eve what he had do­ne.</p>
   <p>    Then in an ins­tant, both of the Gre­at Lords tur­ned to sta­re at him with an an­ger as overw­hel­ming as his. Kyrti­an felt the we­ight of that an­ger, all of it di­rec­ted so­lely at him, and ca­me to his sen­ses with a start.</p>
   <p>    This might ha­ve be­en a tac­ti­cal er­ror…</p>
   <p>    The lord of the whi­te ali­corn was the first to ri­se from his se­at; the­re was light­ning in his ga­ze and thun­der in his vo­ice as he ad­dres­sed, not Kyrti­an, but his co­usin.</p>
   <p>    "Aelmarkin," the El­ven­lord sa­id, enun­ci­ating each syllab­le with ca­re, "I trust you did not an­ti­ci­pa­te this?"</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin al­so ro­se, and his vo­ice fa­irly drip­ped apo­logy and con­cern. "Go­od my lord, I as­su­re you, I had no idea that my co­usin wo­uld in­dul­ge in such bi­zar­re be­ha­vi­or! I do apo­lo­gi­ze, I wo­uld ne­ver ha­ve in­vi­ted him if-"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian, who had be­en sta­ring down at the wo­un­ded figh­ter, now be­ing aided by one of his com­pa­ni­ons, felt fury over­co­me his go­od sen­se aga­in; he swung aro­und to fa­ce his co­usin, twis­ting his lips in­to a snarl, a red ha­ze set­tling ac­ross his vi­si­on.</p>
   <p>    "Bizarre be­ha­vi­or? Bi­zar­re? I call it sa­nity-stop­ping ut­terly sen­se­less and wan­ton was­te! What-"</p>
   <p>    "Waste?" sho­uted the ot­her fe­uding lord, fu­ri­o­usly, the ice in his vo­ice fre­ezing Kyrti­an's words in his thro­at. "Was­te? What do you know of was­te, you im­pu­dent puppy? You pro­vin­ci­al idi­ot, who let you in among ci­vi­li­zed be­ings? I-"</p>
   <p>    "I apo­lo­gi­ze aga­in, my lords," Ael­mar­kin pro­tes­ted, wa­ving his hands abo­ut fran­ti­cal­ly. "Ple­ase, ta­ke yo­ur se­ats and the com­bat can re­su­me-"</p>
   <p>    "Resume? Re­su­me?" At that, Kyrti­an's ra­ge sprang to full and in­sen­sa­te li­fe aga­in, and grew un­til it was be­yond anyt­hing, he had ever felt be­fo­re. He went cold, then hot, then cold aga­in, and a stran­ge ha­ze ca­me over his vi­si­on. "Ha­ven't you he­ard a word I've sa­id? This idi­ocy will not re­su­me, not whi­le I'm stan­ding he­re!"</p>
   <p>    "That can be re­me­di­ed,'' mut­te­red so­me­one, as Gel fi­nal­ly put a cal­ming hand on Kyrti­an's arm. Kyrti­an had the sen­se not to throw it off, but he was qu­ite re­ady at that mo­ment to snatch up a sword him­self and ta­ke them all on sing­le-han­ded.</p>
   <p>    "Don't back down," Gel mut­te­red, "but get hold of yo­ur­self. Think fast-if you can't sal­va­ge this si­tu­ati­on, we're go­ing to ha­ve three fe­uds on our hands, two with them and one with Ael­mar­kin."</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin was so angry he co­uld scar­cely think. When he'd in­vi­ted that fo­ol Kyrti­an he­re, he'd ho­ped the puppy wo­uld ma­ke so­me sort of blun­der that wo­uld pro­ve he was as fo­olish as Ael­mar­kin cla­imed. Well, he'd blun­de­red all right-but he'd ma­na­ged to do it in such a way that now Ael­mar­kin was po­ten­ti­al­ly in as much tro­ub­le as he was! How had he ma­na­ged to stop the com­bat? Whe­re did he get all that ma­gic po­wer?</p>
   <p>    To the de­sert with that! How am I go­ing to sa­ve myself?</p>
   <p>    This was not­hing short of a di­sas­ter. The amo­unt of sta­tus he sto­od to lo­se over this de­bac­le was in­cal­cu­lab­le. This might even cost him his Co­un­cil se­at.</p>
   <p>    "Please, my lords," he sa­id, ent­re­atingly, to his two fu­ri­o­us gu­ests, "my yo­ung co­usin has ne­ver se­en one of the­se ex­hi­bi­ti­ons be­fo­re and-"</p>
   <p>    "Exhibitions?" Ael­mar­kin blin­ked at the to­ne of Kyrti­an's vo­ice-a mo­ment ago it had ne­arly crac­ked with stra­in, and Kyrti­an was cle­arly a short step from lo­sing cont­rol en­ti­rely.</p>
   <p>    Suddenly now-the an­ger was still the­re, but it was cont­rol­led an­ger, and over­la­id with cal­cu­la­ted scorn worthy of an ex­pe­ri­en­ced Co­un­ci­lor. He tur­ned to see that Kyrti­an's fa­ce was now a ca­re­ful­ly ha­ughty mask.</p>
   <p>    Could Kyrti­an ac­tu­al­ly sal­va­ge this si­tu­ati­on?</p>
   <p>    "Exhibitions?" Kyrti­an re­pe­ated. "Is that what you call the­se sen­se­less sla­ugh­ters?" His lip cur­led in what was un­mis­ta­kably a sne­er. "I sup­po­se if yo­ur idea of 'sport' is to ta­ke ta­me pets and li­ne them up for tar­gets, then you co­uld call so­met­hing li­ke this an ex­hi­bi­ti­on, but I cer­ta­inly wo­uldn't dig­nify this idi­ocy with such a term."</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin saw with ho­pe that the two fe­uding lords had for­got­ten all abo­ut him. Kyrti­an's dec­la­ra­ti­on and at­ti­tu­de had ca­used them to fo­cus all of the­ir in­sul­ted ra­ge on him.</p>
   <p>    "I sup­po­se it's too much to ex­pect you to ans­wer that sta­te­ment of ut­ter non­sen­se with anyt­hing li­ke a chal­len­ge?" as­ked Lord Mart­hi­en, his vo­ice drip­ping with sar­casm.</p>
   <p>    "Yes it is," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, ans­we­ring sar­casm with ar­ro­gan­ce, "Be­ca­use yo­ur figh­ters are no match for mi­ne. You wo­uld lo­se be­fo­re the com­bat be­gan. That is why I say this is sen­se­less. The le­ast of my figh­ters has fo­ur ye­ars of com­bat ex­pe­ri­en­ce-the best of yo­urs can't pos­sibly ha­ve mo­re than one. No, less than one, sin­ce I do­ubt yo­ur men ever sur­vi­ve even that long."</p>
   <p>    That ar­ro­gan­ce to­ok them rat­her aback; Lord Wyvar­na glan­ced at Ael­mar­kin as if as­king for con­fir­ma­ti­on of the as­to­nis­hing sta­te­ment. Ael­mar­kin ma­de a slight shrug.</p>
   <p>    "And are we sup­po­sed to ac­cept this bluff at fa­ce va­lue, im­pu­dent puppy?" Lord Wyvar­na de­man­ded.</p>
   <p>    To the­ir as­to­nish­ment, Kyrti­an la­ug­hed, al­be­it mirth­les­sly.</p>
   <p>    "You wo­uld be wi­se to, sin­ce it is hardly a bluff," he rep­li­ed. "Con­si­der what you al­re­ady know abo­ut me and my-hobby. Con­si­der that I ha­ve very lit­tle to do ex­cept tra­in and drill my figh­ters in every pos­sib­le style and man­ner of com­bat, and that I do not and ne­ver ha­ve sold any of them for any pri­ce. Con­si­der that I ha­ve be­en do­ing this every day for the past ten ye­ars at le­ast, per­so­nal­ly over­se­e­ing the tra­ining and prac­ti­ce in every as­pect. Me­anw­hi­le, what ha­ve you be­en do­ing? Ent­rus­ting the training and prac­ti­ce of yo­ur gla­di­ators to ot­hers, qu­ite wit­ho­ut su­per­vi­si­on, and sla­ugh­te­ring the best of yo­ur men in use­less ex­hi­bi­ti­ons. And what sta­ke do tho­se you ent­rust with this tra­ining ha­ve in yo­ur suc­cess or fa­ilu­re? What per­so­nal in­cen­ti­ve ha­ve they to ma­ke cer­ta­in that not­hing is left to chan­ce? And how many of yo­ur gla­di­ators die or are crip­pled in tra­ining? For that mat­ter, what in­cen­ti­ve do yo­ur gla­di­ators ha­ve to suc­ce­ed? The best and cle­ve­rest of them are su­rely cont­ri­ving to get them­sel­ves mildly crip­pled in the first we­ek of yo­ur so-cal­led 'tra­ining!' It wo­uld se­em to me that the very smar­test ones, the ones who wo­uld ma­ke the very best figh­ters, wo­uld see to it that they we­re al­ways crip­pled in tra­ining, in or­der to avo­id be­ing sla­ugh­te­red in one of yo­ur so-cal­led ex­hi­bi­ti­ons!"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian cle­verly left the qu­es­ti­ons han­ging in the air, and now Ael­mar­kin saw a cer­ta­in wa­ri­ness cre­ep over the exp­res­si­ons of the two fe­uding lords.</p>
   <p>    "And I sup­po­se you ha­ve a bet­ter idea?" bo­omed a new vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    Both Ael­mar­kin and Kyrti­an tur­ned to fa­ce the new spe­aker, who sto­od up from among his son's en­to­ura­ge. Ael­mar­kin was start­led; he hadn't re­ali­zed that Lord Lyon had co­me with his son Gil­dor-</p>
   <p>    Damn! Has he be­en the­re all along, or did he just ar­ri­ve for the com­bat? Did I so­me­how in­sult him by not no­ti­cing him? Can anyt­hing el­se go wrong he­re to­day?</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin's tho­ughts scur­ri­ed af­ter one anot­her, li­ke fran­tic sla­ves trying to cle­an up a ter­rib­le spill. V'kel Lyon Lord Kyndreth-Lord Lyon of the Gre­at Ho­use of Kyndreth-sto­od wrap­ped in a scar­let clo­ak emb­ro­ide­red with le­aping stags, his arms cros­sed over his chest. Ael­mar­kin shi­ve­red; the man was one of the most po­wer­ful lords of the Gre­at Co­un­cil. A vo­te from Lord Lyon was worth three from an­yo­ne with a les­ser Co­un­cil Se­at. The num­ber of al­li­es he had-the num­ber of pe­op­le he co­uld ma­ke or bre­ak with a sing­le word-</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin held his bre­ath. All his own pra­yers might be ans­we­red in the next few mo­ments. If Kyrti­an in­sul­ted Lord Lyon badly eno­ugh-if he con­vin­ced Lord Lyon that he was as in­sa­ne and uns­tab­le as Ael­mar­kin had be­en cla­iming…</p>
   <p>    Then be­fo­re this day was over, Ael­mar­kjn might be or­ga­ni­zing his sla­ves for the mo­ve to his new pro­per­ti­es.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian lo­oked at Lord Lyon, a ve­ri­tab­le icon of po­wer, as if he we­re no mo­re im­por­tant than any of the les­ser sons and han­gers-on.</p>
   <p>    "Yes," he sa­id, simply, "I ha­ve. And I'm qu­ite pre­pa­red to de­monst­ra­te it, he­re and now in front of you all."</p>

   <p>    That's V'kel Lyon Lord Kyndreth," Gel his­sed in Kyrt-ian's ear. Kyrti­an ma­de the fin­ger-sign for I un­ders­tand, but did not lo­ok away from the tall, po­wer­ful­ly-bu­ilt nob­le who had ad­dres­sed him. That was one na­me he de­fi­ni­tely re­cog­ni­zed, and the half-for­med plan he had thrown to­get­her in an ins­tant of pa­nic-rid­den thin­king to­ok on a new im­por­tan­ce and ur­gency. If he co­uld per­su­ade Lord Lyon to use his met­hods, not only in tra­ining, but in chal­len­ge-matc­hes, how many tho­usands of li­ves wo­uld be spa­red? For if Lord Lyon dec­re­ed it, all tra­ining and matc­hes wo­uld be per­for­med Kyrti­an's way.</p>
   <p>    So he tur­ned his half-for­med plan in­to a bluff. "In fact," he con­ti­nu­ed, as calmly as if he spo­ke the truth, "I ca­me he­re ho­ping to stop this non­sen­se for all ti­me with such a de­monst­ra­ti­on."</p>
   <p>    "Really?" Lord Lyon lo­oked amu­sed, which bo­ded well for Kyrti­an. "And how is that? I ta­ke it you in­tend a li­ve de­monst­ra­ti­on, and not so­me il­lu­sory sha­dow show."</p>
   <p>    "Pit one figh­ter of yo­ur cho­osing aga­inst my body­gu­ard," Kyrti­an sa­id, boldly. "They will use my met­hods of figh­ting. They will fight to a de­ath-wo­und, but ne­it­her will be har­med by the ex­pe­ri­en­ce. You can use the best of yo­ur men-the one you wo­uld le­ast ca­re to lo­se-wit­ho­ut any fe­ar that harm will co­me to him and you will be wit­ho­ut his ser­vi­ces."</p>
   <p>    "Indeed." Lord Lyon lo­oked from one si­de of the are­na to the other. "Wyvar­na, Mart­hi­en-if I pro­po­sed using my body­gu­ard in this com­bat, wo­uld you ac­cept the re­sults of such a du­el ins­te­ad of using yo­ur gla­di­ators as set­tling yo­ur dis­pu­te?"</p>
   <p>    The lord of the whi­te ali­corn lo­oked sul­len; the lord of the blue ser­pent res­pon­ded first. "How wo­uld we de­ci­de which figh­ter rep­re­sen­ted which of us?"</p>
   <p>    "Draw lots," Lyon sa­id ca­re­les­sly. "I know my man ta­kes se­cond-pla­ce to very few, and I hardly think Lord Kyrti­an's man is less ex­pert." He tur­ned back to Kyrti­an. "I ag­ree in prin­cip­le that this is a was­te of figh­ting-strength. The tra­ining is ex­pen­si­ve, and it's all go­ne to was­te when a figh­ter is kil­led-or runs off to jo­in tho­se dam­ned re­ne­ga­de Wi­zards. Be­fo­re the cur­rent unp­le­asant­ness, the­re we­re no Wi­zards to run off to, of co­ur­se, and the­re was no ne­ed to fi­eld bat­tle-tro­ops, but our pre­sent si­tu­ati­on do­es call for so­me chan­ges in our own cus­toms. In fact, so­me of the mem­bers of the Co­un­cil ha­ve even as­ked openly if it might be wi­se to out­law chal­len­ges al­to­get­her to sa­ve the was­te of tra­ined figh­ters." He smi­led thinly. "So­me ha­ve even sug­ges­ted that if chal­len­gers are un­wil­ling or unab­le to con­duct du­els-by-ma­gic, that they sho­uld ta­ke sword in hand them­sel­ves to set­tle the­ir qu­ar­rels."</p>
   <p>    Astonished mut­ters and a few gasps fol­lo­wed that an­no­un­ce­ment, and Lords Wyvar­na and Mart­hi­en lo­oked openly dis­ma­yed.</p>
   <p>    Lord Lyon lo­oked down his long, aris­toc­ra­tic no­se at Kyrti­an with a hint of sar­do­nic in­te­rest. Kyrti­an ra­ised his chin and re­min­ded him­self that his li­ne­age was as long and pro­ud as that of the Ho­use of Kyndrefh. "How much bet­ter, then, if you can ha­ve yo­ur chal­len­ges wit­ho­ut the loss of a sing­le figh­ting man or spil­la­ge of a sing­le drop of blo­od?" he de­man­ded. "May­be yo­ur gla­di­ators will stop run­ning off if they know they aren't go­ing to be kil­led in a sen­se­less grud­ge-match. And I know I ne­ed not po­int out to a Lord of yo­ur ex­pe­ri­en­ce and wis­dom that such tra­ining will ma­ke bet­ter fi­eld-for­ces than anyt­hing our fo­es can cre­ate. Think of the kind of figh­ters you will fi­eld, when you can bre­ed the best to the best, then gi­ve them re­al com­bat ex­pe­ri­en­ce whe­re they can le­arn from the­ir mis­ta­kes!"</p>
   <p>    "Bloodless matc­hes? Whe­re's the sport in that?" so­me­one be­hind Kyrti­an mut­te­red.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian ig­no­red the com­ment-and ig­no­red the fact that the spec­ta­tors we­re le­aving, one by one, grumb­ling. He had Lord Lyon's at­ten­ti­on, and he was not go­ing to gi­ve it up. "I am well awa­re that many con­si­der my in­te­rest in the past to be ec­cent­ric," he con­ti­nu­ed, "but be­ca­use of that in­te­rest, I ha­ve le­ar­ned at le­ast one of the sec­rets lost when we pas­sed the Ga­te from Eve­lon. I know how the An­ces­tors con­duc­ted the­ir du­els-of-ho­nor and the­ir tra­ining ses­si­ons-how they ta­ught and prac­ti­ced com­bat wit­ho­ut pul­ling blows, wit­ho­ut using blun­ted we­apons, yet wit­ho­ut spil­ling blo­od. Didn't it ever oc­cur to you that they must ha­ve had so­me way to le­arn sword-work them­sel­ves wit­ho­ut ris­king hurt? Af­ter all, un­li­ke us-" he­re he lo­oked down his no­se at the yo­ung Lords aro­und him with a bland exp­res­si­on "-they en­ga­ged in sword-du­els them­sel­ves, and not by proxy. The­ir met­hod is what I use to tra­in my own figh­ters. Furt­her­mo­re, I gi­ve every ab­le-bo­di­ed hu­man on my pro­per­ti­es a ba­sic tra­ining in figh­ting-skil­ls, aga­inst the day that they may ne­ed to de­fend the ma­nor un­til my re­al figh­ters can co­me to the­ir res­cue!"</p>
   <p>    He did not say what foe he tra­ined his hu­mans to fight-he fi­gu­red that Lord Lyon wo­uld as­su­me that he me­ant the army of the Wi­zards or of the Wild Hu­mans, not an army com­man­ded by his fel­lows. Not a flic­ker of mist­rust ap­pe­ared on Lord Lyon's fa­ce, only a gro­wing in­te­rest-and if an­yo­ne he­re had be­en thin­king abo­ut the idea of ta­king his hol­dings by for­ce, that last sta­te­ment wo­uld gi­ve them a re­ason to think bet­ter of the plan.</p>
   <p>    "If all this is true-" Lord Lyon tur­ned to a si­lent, black-clad, fla­me-ha­ired hu­man who sta­yed at his si­de li­ke his sha­dow. "Ka­eth-get down to the are­na and get so­me ar­mor and we­apons. I want to see how this works."</p>
   <p>    The hu­man sa­lu­ted, and left Lord Lyon's si­de, jum­ping down in­to the are­na and wal­king past the gla­di­ators as ca­su­al­ly as if they we­re sta­tu­es. Kyrti­an ca­ught Gel's eye and nod­ded; Gel fol­lo­wed him.</p>
   <p>    "I be­li­eve that you will find this well worth yo­ur ti­me, Lord Lyon," Kyrti­an sa­id evenly, then tur­ned to the fe­uding par­ti­es. "My lords, will you ma­ke yo­ur cho­ice of com­ba­tant?"</p>
   <p>    There was mo­re grumb­ling, but fi­nal­ly it was set­tled that Lord Mart­hi­en wo­uld be rep­re­sen­ted by Gel, and Wyvar­na by Lord Lyon's man Ka­eth. Sin­ce it was ob­vi­o­us that the­re was no lon­ger go­ing to be the blo­ody spec­tac­le that ever­yo­ne had plan­ned on, no one re­al­ly wan­ted to re­ma­in any lon­ger, and both lords lost most of the­ir en­to­ura­ges, le­aving only the­ir hu­man body­gu­ards and one or two ot­her sla­ves in at­ten­dan­ce.</p>
   <p>    As for Ael­mar­kin's gu­ests, they had all de­par­ted as well, pro­bably re­tur­ning to the Gre­at Hall and the fo­od and drink and ot­her ple­asu­res they had aban­do­ned to watch the com­bat. That left only Ael­mar­kin, Lord Lyon and a yo­ung er-Lord who was pro­bably his son, a co­up­le of yo­ung lords who lo­oked to be fri­ends of his son, and Kyrti­an. Tho­se who re­ma­ined se­ated them­sel­ves, and wa­ited with var­ying deg­re­es of im­pa­ti­en­ce for so­met­hing to hap­pen.</p>
   <p>    Gel was no stran­ger to get­ting in­to ar­mor qu­ickly, and ne­it­her, ap­pa­rently, was Lord Lyon's red-ha­ired body­gu­ard. Both ap­pe­ared at the sa­me do­or of the are­na a re­mar­kably short ti­me la­ter; Gel must ha­ve told Ka­eth not to bot­her abo­ut we­apons, for ne­it­her man car­ri­ed any. Ka­eth lo­oked up at his mas­ter, who nod­ded to Lord Wyvar­na; Ka­eth im­me­di­ately pic­ked up one of the dis­car­ded shi­elds stac­ked at the si­de of the are­na be­aring the azu­re ser­pent, and Gel to­ok one of the dis­car­ded whi­te ali­corn shi­elds.</p>
   <p>    "We've ag­re­ed to longs­word and shi­eld, mas­ter," Gel cal­led up, in a ser­vi­le vo­ice that Kyrti­an hardly re­cog­ni­zed. He sup­pres­sed a ner­vo­us chuck­le, and nod­ded.</p>
   <p>    Then Kyrti­an fi­xed his ga­ze on a po­int on the sand at Gel's fe­et, and con­cent­ra­ted, dra­wing mo­tes of po­wer out of him­self, and spin­ning them in­to the fab­ric of a pa­ir of his very spe­ci­al bla­des.</p>
   <p>    He'd co­nj­ured up longs­words so many ti­mes, that it was hardly any ef­fort at all to spin out a me­re pa­ir of them. The air abo­ve the sand mis­ted bri­efly, then shim­me­red, and a pa­ir of fi­ne bla­des con­den­sed out of the mist as Kyrti­an felt a slight in­ward drain of po­wer. He lo­oked up to see that Ael­mar­kin was watc­hing clo­sely, with a lo­ok of in­ten­se con­cent­ra­ti­on on his fa­ce.</p>
   <p>    I won­der if he can fol­low what I'm do­ing? Has he the ta­lent to re­ad all the spe­ci­al mo­di­fi­ca­ti­ons I've ma­de?</p>
   <p>    Gel ges­tu­red to the iden­ti­cal swords and let Ka­eth pick first.</p>
   <p>    The body­gu­ard pic­ked up the ne­arest, and ga­ve it an ex­pe­ri­men­tal swing, then rap­ped his shi­eld with it. The shi­eld ga­ve off a per­fectly nor­mal me­tal­lic clang, and Ka­eth nod­ded with sa­tis­fac­ti­on. "Fe­els li­ke a re­gu­la­ti­on longs­word, Lord Lyon," he cal­led up in­to the vi­ewing stands, squ­in­ting aga­inst the light. "May­be a bit bet­ter ba­lan­ced than most."</p>
   <p>    "These bla­des will act in all res­pect li­ke a nor­mal bat­tle we­apon," Kyrti­an as­su­red the few who we­re left in the stands, but con­cent­ra­ting on Lord Lyon. "With a sing­le ex­cep­ti­on, that is. They will not ca­use any physi­cal da­ma­ge. Gel, ple­ase of­fer yo­ur op­po­nent a tar­get."</p>
   <p>    Gel held out his sword-arm with a grin, kno­wing that Kyrti­an wo­uld eli­mi­na­te the shock of be­ing struck for this part of the de­monst­ra­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "Kaeth, if you wo­uld swing at Gel ple­ase, and cut off his arm?"</p>
   <p>    Lord Lyon's sla­ve did not he­si­ta­te; he to­ok a full, over­hand swing at the arm Gel ex­ten­ded for him as Lord Lyon le­aned for­ward a lit­tle with in­te­rest. The bla­de pas­sed thro­ugh Gel's arm, le­aving a glo­wing li­ne, and ma­king abo­ut half his body glow.</p>
   <p>    "Wounds ca­use a slight shock to the wo­un­ded man to tell him that he has be­en wo­un­ded, and the bla­de le­aves a mark that he and any re­fe­re­es can see," Kyrti­an exp­la­ined. "The­re is no ot­her ef­fect on the figh­ter so struck, but for the pur­po­ses of sco­ring, the­re is full at­ten­ti­on pa­id to the re­ali­ti­es of bat­tle. The lon­ger Gel stands the­re, the mo­re of him will glow, rep­re­sen­ting how clo­se he is to de­ath by blo­od-loss from such a mas­si­ve wo­und. If he had only got­ten a slight wo­und, the­re wo­uld only ha­ve be­en a mark and a shock. Even­tu­al­ly, ac­cor­ding to the ru­les we fol­low, he will glow all over and be for­ced to re­ti­re."</p>
   <p>    "And if the wo­und was im­me­di­ately mor­tal, he'd glow all over as well?" Lord Lyon sup­pli­ed.</p>
   <p>    "Yes, and he wo­uld get a lar­ger, qu­ite un­mis­ta­kab­le shock."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian rep­li­ed. He per­mit­ted him­self a smi­le. "We al­low for the he­at of com­bat ca­using pe­op­le to for­get them­sel­ves, and the shocks they re­ce­ive will get the­ir at­ten­ti­on." He ne­ga­ted the glow with a mo­ment's tho­ught, and Gel shif­ted his fe­et in the sand.</p>
   <p>    Lord Lyon nod­ded tho­ught­ful­ly, and even Wyvar­na and Mart­hi­en lo­oked mo­re in­te­res­ted than they had be­en. "I'm su­re the­re are mo­re de­ta­ils that I will want to ask you abo­ut la­ter," Lord Lyon sa­id af­ter a mo­ment of si­len­ce. "But me­anw­hi­le- let's set­tle this qu­ar­rel and ha­ve our prac­ti­cal de­monst­ra­ti­on, shall we?"</p>
   <p>    At this po­int, Kyrti­an ca­ught a de­ci­dedly unf­ri­endly exp­res­si­on on Ael­mar­kin's fa­ce. It was the­re for only a mo­ment, but it re­min­ded him that his co­usin was the host of this com­bat, and that Kyrti­an had do­ne him a fa­ir amo­unt of da­ma­ge.</p>
   <p>    But may­be the­re was a way to be­gin re­pa­iring that da­ma­ge- or at le­ast, do­ing so­met­hing to ma­ke up for it. Ne­ver ma­ke an enemy that you don't ha­ve to, he re­min­ded him­self, and ne­ver gi­ve an enemy you al­re­ady ha­ve anot­her ex­cu­se to act aga­inst you.</p>
   <p>    "Cousin?" he sa­id, ges­tu­ring to the are­na. "As host, yo­urs sho­uld be the ho­nor."</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin lo­oked bri­efly start­led, then sus­pi­ci­o­us, but sto­od up. He bo­wed to the two for whom this en­ti­re com­bat had be­en ar­ran­ged. "Lord Mart­hi­en, Lord Wyvar­na, will yo­ur fe­ud be set­tled by the out­co­me of this chal­len­ge?"</p>
   <p>    "Aye," ca­me the reply-grud­gingly, but wit­ho­ut much he­si­ta­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "Be it wit­nes­sed," Ael­mar­kin in­to­ned.</p>
   <p>    "We so wit­ness," ca­me the cho­rus of Kyrti­an, Lord Lyon, Lyon 's son, and a pa­ir of han­gers-on, thin­ner than be­fo­re, but eno­ugh to sa­tisfy cus­tom.</p>
   <p>    "Very well," Ael­mar­kin con­ti­nu­ed, as Gel and Ka­eth eyed each ot­her and set­tled in­to ne­arly iden­ti­cal stan­ces. "Be­gin."</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin se­ated him­self, and cros­sed his arms over his chest. Kyrti­an le­aned for­ward to watch what he sus­pec­ted wo­uld be a very fi­ne show.</p>
   <p>    There was no rush to com­bat and clash of we­apons this ti­me, not with two such se­aso­ned figh­ters. They circ­led each ot­her warily, ta­king ca­re­ful me­asu­re of each ot­her, ma­king tiny fe­ints and ga­uging the spe­ed of res­pon­se. Gel and Ka­eth we­re a go­od match for one anot­her, and alt­ho­ugh Ael­mar­kin le­aned back in his se­at and lo­oked dre­ad­ful­ly bo­red, Lord Lyon and the two fe­uding El­ven­lords we­re qu­ickly on the ed­ge of the­ir cha­irs, re­cog­ni­zing the le­vel of skill each man rep­re­sen­ted. Kyrti­an felt a thrill of pri­de as he watc­hed Gel's cat­li­ke, po­wer­ful mo­ves; it was ob­vi­o­us that Ka­eth was an ext­re­mely well-tra­ined and pro­bably very ex­pen­si­ve sla­ve, and re­gar­ded Gel as his equ­al in abi­lity.</p>
   <p>    When the first exc­han­ge ca­me, it was sud­den; Ka­eth tho­ught he de­tec­ted a we­ak­ness and dro­ve in, ma­king Gel's shi­eld and bla­de ring with a flurry of blows. Gel co­un­te­red suc­ces­sful­ly, and when Ka­eth sprang back, both of them had tiny glo­wing marks, Ka­eth along the back of his sword-hand and Gel ac­ross his fo­re­he­ad.</p>
   <p>    Well used to the ru­les of the ga­me, Gel did so­met­hing that surp­ri­sed Ka­eth; he sprin­ted back­wards out of re­ach for a mo­ment, just long eno­ugh to pull a scarf from aro­und his neck and whip it aro­und his fo­re­he­ad. Kyrti­an ris­ked a glan­ce at Lord Lyon, and saw him frown sud­denly in puz­zle­ment, then just as qu­ickly nod and smi­le slightly.</p>
   <p>    Good. He un­ders­tands that if Gel hadn 't do­ne that, the glow wo­uld drop over his eye, obs­cu­ring his vi­si­on as blo­od wo­uld wit­ho­ut a scarf to stop it. He's be­gin­ning to un­ders­tand how comp­lex the ru­les-ma­gic is.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian aban­do­ned him­self to watc­hing the fight, ab­le to enj­oy it as a de­monst­ra­ti­on of gra­ce and ex­per­ti­se. He no­ti­ced that Ka­eth was grin­ning, just as Gel was; evi­dently, Ka­eth sel­dom fo­und him­self with an op­po­nent of com­pa­rab­le abi­lity, and wit­ho­ut ne­eding to worry abo­ut crip­pling inj­uri­es or de­ath, had gi­ven him­self over to the ex­hi­la­ra­ti­on and vis­ce­ral ple­asu­re of such a du­el. With each exc­han­ge of blows, one or both of the com­ba­tants ca­me away mar­ked, but only su­per­fi­ci­al­ly-and by the ti­me they'd ac­qu­ired half a do­zen "cuts" each, Lord Mart­hi­en and Lord Wyvar­na we­re on the­ir fe­et, che­ering the­ir rep­re­sen­ta­ti­ves on with as much vi­gor as they wo­uld ha­ve used if the­ir con­test had go­ne as plan­ned. Kyrti­an's own he­art was pounding at this po­int, and his fists clenc­hed with ex­ci­te­ment. It was a ter­ri­fic com­bat, and he ho­nestly wasn't cer­ta­in who he wis­hed to see win it.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian no­ti­ced a pat­tern in Ka­eth's shi­eld­work, a we­ak­ness, a ten­dency to push an on­co­ming blow to the out­si­de rat­her than hold up un­der it. That spa­red the shock to the shi­eld-arm, yes, but it left him open for a sli­ding parry un­der the shi­eld or a fe­int and a dri­ve stra­ight to the chest. If he saw it, cer­ta­inly Gel did-</p>
   <p>    Gel ma­de a lit­tle dan­ce to the si­de, anot­her blow to­wards the shi­eld-but it wasn't a blow, it was a fe­int, and he fol­lo­wed it with a lun­ge stra­ight for Ka­eth's un­gu­ar­ded thro­at!</p>
   <p>    But Ka­eth was re­ady for him! The pat­tern had be­en a ru­se, a lu­re to see if Gel wo­uld ta­ke it! He dod­ged asi­de, mo­ving just eno­ugh so that Gel's bla­de slid over his sho­ul­der wit­ho­ut har­ming him, and slas­hed up in a vi­ci­o­us gut-thrust.</p>
   <p>    Gel stif­fe­ned, and burst in­to glo­wing light. Obe­di­ent to the ru­les (and his own sen­se of high dra­ma), he top­pled over and drop­ped to the gro­und, "de­ad."</p>
   <p>    Lord Lyon ro­se to his fe­et, ap­pla­uding ent­hu­si­as­ti­cal­ly, as Ka­eth sa­lu­ted him, then sa­lu­ted Lord Wyvar­na, who was al­so on his fe­et and che­ering. So, for that mat­ter, was Kyrti­an-</p>
   <p>    -and oddly eno­ugh, Lord Mart­hi­en.</p>
   <p>    "By the blo­od of our An­ces­tors, Lyon, I ha­ven't se­en a bet­ter fight in de­ca­des!" Lord Mart­hi­en sho­uted, as Kyrti­an ba­nis­hed the we­apons, and Ka­eth of­fe­red his now free hand to Gel to help him up. "It's worth lo­sing the chal­len­ge to ha­ve se­en it!" He tur­ned his at­ten­ti­on bri­efly to the are­na, and wa­ved gra­ci­o­usly at Gel. "Well fo­ught, boy! I co­uldn't ha­ve had a bet­ter cham­pi­on!"</p>
   <p>    He gat­he­red up the re­ma­ins of his en­to­ura­ge, and in ama­zingly go­od hu­mor, led them out.</p>
   <p>    Kaeth and Gel left the are­na in a si­mi­lar sta­te of ac­cord, and Lord Wyvar­na ma­de his way to the area of se­ating whe­re Lord Lyon still sto­od, cle­arly in a high flo­od of eup­ho­ria. Af­ter a mo­ment of he­si­ta­ti­on, Kyrti­an fol­lo­wed to jo­in them.</p>
   <p>    When he re­ac­hed them, he fo­und them in­vol­ved in a re­hash of the com­bat, but Lord Lyon bro­ke off when he no­ti­ced Kyrt-ian's ap­pro­ach.</p>
   <p>    "Well, you im­pu­dent yo­ung puppy, you we­re right and I was wrong!" Wyvar­na exc­la­imed, la­ug­hing. He sho­wed Kyrti­an a fri­endly fa­ce for the first ti­me sin­ce he'd en­te­red the are­na. "Ances­tors! That old fo­ol Mart­hi­en was right for the first ti­me in his li­fe-even if I'd be­en the one who lost, I'd ha­ve tho­ught it was worth it to ha­ve se­en a fight li­ke that!"</p>
   <p>    He sho­ok his he­ad, and now that he was clo­ser, Kyrti­an re­ali­zed that Wyvar­na was much ol­der than he had tho­ught. It was of­ten dif­fi­cult to tell the age of an El­ven­lord, but a hint of li­nes at the cor­ners of his eyes, and a cer­ta­in shar­pe­ning of the tips of his ears in­di­ca­ted that he was ol­der than Lord Lyon. If Lord Mart­hi­en was just as old-</p>
   <p>    Then I've got­ten myself two very well-entrenc­hed al­li­es; may­be not as po­wer­ful as Lord Lyon, but cer­ta­inly res­pec­ted by the Co­un­cil. This is co­ming out bet­ter than I da­red ho­pe!</p>
   <p>    "And I think it was just as well that it ne­ver ca­me to a chal­len­ge with yo­ung Kyrti­an, he­re, hmm?" Lord Lyon as­ked, slyly. "Gi­ven how well his body­gu­ard fo­ught-what must his tra­ined figh­ters be li­ke?"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian's res­pect for Lord Lyon ro­se a notch. He's re­min­ding Wyvar­na that this co­uld ha­ve be­en very ex­pen­si­ve-and he's ma­king su­re that Wyvar­na will spre­ad the word. So alt­ho­ugh I might be con­si­de­red a dolt, I'm a dolt no one will want to chal­len­ge.</p>
   <p>    Lord Wyvar­na ga­ve an exag­ge­ra­ted shud­der, and la­ug­hed aga­in. "Damn me if you aren't right abo­ut that! His men wo­uld ha­ve cut mi­ne to pi­eces wit­ho­ut even bre­at­hing hard!" He clap­ped Kyrti­an on the back, hard, trying to ma­ke him stag­ger. Kyrti­an, who had be­en ex­pec­ting so­met­hing of the sort, bra­ced him­self and sto­od firm, smi­ling.</p>
   <p>    "It was a ple­asu­re to show you the sec­ret I dis­co­ve­red, my lords," he rep­li­ed blandly. "Of all the things I dis­li­ke the most, was­te is hig­hest on the list, and the­re is no re­ason ot­her than los­ses in a re­al bat­tle to ha­ve to rep­la­ce a gla­di­ator or a figh­ting-sla­ve be­fo­re his ti­me. Hu­mans are hardly dif­fi­cult to bre­ed, but it ta­kes ti­me and re­so­ur­ces to tra­in them, re­so­ur­ces that co­uld mo­re sen­sibly be put to ot­her uses! Be­si­des, if we ke­ep kil­ling the stron­gest and cle­ve­rest of our bre­eding-sla­ves, what do you think we'll end up with? The­se tech­ni­qu­es are qu­ite easy to le­arn, and even easi­er to apply; if you can set a col­lar-spell, you can cre­ate the­se tra­ining con­di­ti­ons."</p>
   <p>    Wyvarna ga­ve a half smi­le, and glan­ced over at Lord Lyon. "Then I ex­pect we'll be get­ting a man­da­te from the Co­un­cil abo­ut using them shortly, eh, Lyon?"</p>
   <p>    "I be­li­eve that you can co­unt on that, Wyvar­na," Lord Lyon rep­li­ed, just as blandly as Kyrti­an.</p>
   <p>    Wyvarna co­ug­hed, and then shrug­ged. "Well, ti­mes chan­ge, and the ones who won't chan­ge with them are fo­ols," he sa­id to no one in par­ti­cu­lar. "I'll be off; Mart­hi­en will be sen­ding his con­ci­li­ati­on-party, and I sho­uld be the­re to re­ce­ive them pro­perly, or the­re'll be anot­her fe­ud on my hands."</p>
   <p>    With that, Lord Wyvar­na tur­ned and led his own en­to­ura­ge out of the are­na, le­aving Kyrti­an stan­ding be­si­de Lord Lyon.</p>
   <p>    "Well, eit­her you are the cle­ve­rest yo­ung lord­ling I ha­ve ever se­en, or the luc­ki­est," Lyon ob­ser­ved softly. "I wo­uldn't ha­ve gi­ven you any odds of get­ting out of that si­tu­ati­on in­tact."</p>
   <p>    "The luc­ki­est, my lord," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed qu­ickly-ho­ping that he so­un­ded mo­dest. "I fe­ar that alt­ho­ugh I had co­me to this event in­ten­ding to de­monst­ra­te my dis­co­very, I ma­de a pro­fo­und mis­ta­ke in per­mit­ting my fe­elings to get the bet­ter of me, ini­ti­al­ly. I am, I fe­ar, a very pro­vin­ci­al fel­low, and this was the first com­bat-tri­al I ha­ve ever at­ten­ded. And if I of­fen­ded you with my un­tu­to­red man­ner, I do apo­lo­gi­ze, for I had no in­ten­ti­on of of­fen­ding an­yo­ne."</p>
   <p>    And on­ce aga­in, he tur­ned to his co­usin. Ael­mar­kin's exp­res­si­on was so bland it co­uld not ha­ve be­en anyt­hing ot­her than a mask. He was pro­bably still in­fu­ri­ated.</p>
   <p>    "Cousin, I must ask yo­ur for­gi­ve­ness for using yo­ur pre­mi­ses as the in­ten­ded ve­nue for my disp­lay, but-well, not to put too fi­ne a po­int upon it, this is the only com­bat-chal­len­ge I ha­ve ever be­en in­vi­ted to, so op­por­tu­ni­ti­es ha­ve not exactly be­en thick upon the gro­und." He had no re­al ho­pe that this wo­uld pa­cify Ael­mar­kin, but at le­ast it wo­uld ma­ke it lo­ok as if he'd tri­ed.</p>
   <p>    "I wo­uldn't worry abo­ut it if I we­re you, Ael­mar­kin," Lord Kyndreth told the sto­ne-fa­ced El­ven­lord, with a ra­ised eyeb­row. "I can pro­mi­se you, this lit­tle de­monst­ra­ti­on is only go­ing to ref­lect to yo­ur glory. If you li­ke, I can even spre­ad it abo­ut that you col­lu­ded with yo­ung Kyrti­an he­re-"</p>
   <p>    "To what end, my lord?" Ael­mar­kin as­ked dryly.</p>
   <p>    "Ah, well, to a most pro­per end. You are awa­re of the dre­ad­ful was­ta­ge of figh­ters we've had in this cam­pa­ign aga­inst the so-cal­led Yo­ung Lords. And I as­su­me, gi­ven the age and rank of yo­ur two ma­in gu­ests, you we­re awa­re that I wo­uld ap­pe­ar at this com­bat. Of co­ur­se you are awa­re of my ke­en in­te­rest in new met­hods of tra­ining our figh­ting-sla­ves fas­ter." Lord Kyndreth smi­led; the smi­le re­min­ded Kyrti­an of a lar­ge cat with its prey be­ne­ath its paw. "So you de­ci­ded to help yo­ur co­usin and yo­ur­self at the sa­me ti­me, by gi­ving him a ve­nue to de­monst­ra­te the fru­its of his hobby for me. Hmm?"</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin's exp­res­si­on re­ma­ined as bland as cre­am, but he bo­wed. "As you say, my lord, and I am de­eply gra­te­ful to you."</p>
   <p>    "No mo­re than I am to you." This was cle­arly a dis­mis­sal, and Ael­mar­kin to­ok it as such.</p>
   <p>    "I must re­turn to my gu­ests, my lord, if I may ex­cu­se myself?" Ael­mar­kin bo­wed.</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth wa­ved him off, and Ael­mar­kin de­par­ted; the li­ne of his back­bo­ne sug­ges­ted furt­her tro­ub­le to Kyrti­an. But that was for the fu­tu­re; the­re was a lar­ger and mo­re dan­ge­ro­us pre­da­tor in front of him still. Ael­mar­kin was a jac­kal at best. Lord Kyndreth was a li­on in truth and not just in na­me.</p>
   <p>    "Thank you aga­in, my lord," Kyrti­an sa­id, me­aning it.</p>
   <p>    "Hmph." Lord Lyon eyed him as if sus­pec­ting furt­her cle­ver­ness. "Well, I shall be wan­ting to co­me vi­sit you wit­hin the next few days. I want to dis­cuss yo­ur tra­ining met­hods-and ot­her things."</p>
   <p>    "I am at yo­ur ser­vi­ce, Lord Lyon," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, stun­ned. "I will send a Por­tal-to­ken to the Co­un­cil Hall in yo­ur na­me." Be­fo­re he co­uld think of anyt­hing el­se to say, the Old Lord had sketc­hed a bri­ef sa­lu­te and tur­ned away, le­ading what was left of his en­to­ura­ge off thro­ugh the exit.</p>

   <p>    Every tra­ce of the blo­ody conf­lict that had pre­ce­ded Gel's fight had be­en cle­ared away from the pre­pa­ra­ti­on ro­om by the ti­me that he and the ot­her lord's body­gu­ard re­ti­red to it. Even the ar­mor was go­ne; all that re­ma­ined was the pre­sen­ce of the li­ve­ri­ed gla­di­ators them­sel­ves, di­vi­ded in­to two tight gro­ups with a ca­re­ful spa­ce bet­we­en them. Di­ves­ted of arms and ar­mor, to Gel's eyes they lo­oked ab­surdly yo­ung, ba­rely out of boy­ho­od. The two sets of gla­di­ators ho­ve­red at a res­pect­ful dis­tan­ce from Gel and Lord Kyndreth's man as they to­ok over the pre­pa­ra­ti­on ro­om for them­sel­ves. Gel sup­pres­sed a smi­le of amu­se­ment; the­re was mo­re than a to­uch of he­ro-wors­hip in tho­se yo­ung fa­ces. He and his op­po­nent had not only sa­ved the­se child­ren from inj­ury and de­ath, they had pro­bably put on the most skil­lful com­bat the cal­low lads had ever se­en. He was just glad that he was go­ing to be ab­le to re­turn to his own es­ta­te and get away from all tho­se ad­mi­ring eyes.</p>
   <p>    As Gel fol­lo­wed Ka­eth Jared's examp­le and di­ves­ted him­self of ar­mor, clot­hing, and wal­ked na­ked in­to the whi­te-ti­led wa­ter-cas­ca­de cu­bic­le as if he be­lon­ged the­re, he was tho­ro­ughly cons­ci­o­us of gra­ti­tu­de for be­ing ab­le to cle­an up af­ter the­ir stre­nu­o­us bo­ut. With all of the yo­ungs­ters still watc­hing, awe-fil­led eyes glu­ed to him, Gel was mo­re than a lit­tle un­com­for­tab­le as he plun­ged un­der the warm cas­ca­de of wa­ter and let it so­ot­he musc­les that had be­en as­ked to work wit­ho­ut a pro­per warm-up. He won­de­red why the ot­her figh­ters didn't say anyt­hing to him-or at le­ast, to Ka­eth Jared. They might not know him, but su­rely they knew Ka­eth at le­ast by sight. Well, they've got ton­gu­es, he told him­self, as he duc­ked his he­ad un­der the ste­aming wa­ter and let it po­ur down his neck and back. If they don't want to use them, that's not my prob­lem.</p>
   <p>    Kaeth Jared must ha­ve be­en mo­re used to this odd, se­mi-frigh­te­ned tre­at­ment from his fel­low hu­mans, as he ac­ted on the sur­fa­ce as if the ot­her figh­ters simply we­ren't the­re.</p>
   <p>    On the sur­fa­ce, any­way.</p>
   <p>    To Gel's ex­pe­ri­en­ced eyes, he mo­ved as if he no­ted and analy­zed every mo­ve any of them ma­de, ho­we­ver in­con­se­qu­en­ti­al. That spel­led "assas­sin" as well as "body­gu­ard" to Gel, which ac­tu­al­ly ma­de a gre­at de­al of sen­se, con­si­de­ring Lord Kyn-dreth's pro­mi­nen­ce and the un­cer­ta­in ti­mes. The­re was no tel­ling if the Yo­ung Lords or his own pe­ers might de­ci­de to re­vert to the an­ci­ent ways of de­aling with an obs­tac­le in the form of anot­her El­ven­lord. Who bet­ter to gu­ard aga­inst as­sas­sins than anot­her as­sas­sin?</p>
   <p>    Still. It aro­used his sus­pi­ci­ons. In all his li­fe­ti­me, Gel had en­co­un­te­red no mo­re than fo­ur as­sas­sins, and he him­self was one of them.</p>
   <p>    And I won­der if Ka­eth Jared has ma­de the sa­me conc­lu­si­ons abo­ut me that I ha­ve abo­ut him…</p>
   <p>    The first had be­en his own te­ac­her, the third had be­en his te­ac­her's te­ac­her-a suc­ces­si­on of tra­ined men to gu­ard the es­ta­te's lord, just in ca­se. The fo­urth had be­en on the auc­ti­on block, and that par­ti­cu­lar set of skills hadn't be­en men­ti­oned in the auc­ti­on ca­ta­log. Alt­ho­ugh it mo­men­ta­rily temp­ted him-to ha­ve so­me­one el­se he co­uld trust with his lord's sa­fety-he had sa­id not­hing to the Se­nesc­hal who had be­en lo­oking for a few cho­ice yo­ungs­ters to int­ro­du­ce to the fre­edom of the es­ta­te. It was a bad idea; li­ke his own te­ac­her he wo­uld tra­in his own suc­ces­sor. The­re was no tel­ling whe­re that man had be­en, or why he was on the block.</p>
   <p>    For a mo­ment, Gel re­cal­led his te­ac­her with gre­at fond­ness-Hak­kon Shor had not be­en Gel's fat­her, but he might just as well ha­ve be­en. He'd hel­ped ra­ise Gel from the mo­ment that Gel sho­wed the sort of ath­le­tic po­ten­ti­al that ma­de him the skil­led figh­ter he was to­day. Hak­kon hadn't had sons, only da­ugh­ters-not that one of them wo­uldn't ha­ve ser­ved per­fectly well as Kyrti­an's body­gu­ard, but no­ne of them to­ok af­ter Hak­kon; in po­int of fact, they we­re swe­et-na­tu­red and ab­so­lu­tely ob­li­vi­o­us to half of what went on aro­und them. Now Tirith Shor, who'd be­en Hak­kon's fat­her, felt that was just as well, but Gel knew it had be­en a gre­at di­sap­po­int­ment to the Old Man that his son wo­uldn't be the one to stand at the next Lord's si­de…</p>
   <p>    Kaeth Jared was an un­li­kely sort for an as­sas­sin, if you only saw him clot­hed. Tall and slim, pa­le, with ha­ir of a dark auburn and long, cle­ver hands, he didn't lo­ok par­ti­cu­larly strong. If you saw him nu­de, ho­we­ver-or in com­bat-you re­ali­zed that he was a gre­at de­al stron­ger and mo­re agi­le than he se­emed. The­re wasn't an oun­ce of su­perf­lu­o­us flesh on him anyw­he­re, and the musc­les he had we­re wi­re and whip­cord; to­ugh, and po­wer­ful.</p>
   <p>    Gel won­de­red if the ot­hers had no­ti­ced Ka­eth Jared's unu­su­al alert­ness and ca­uti­on, and de­ci­ded that they pro­bably hadn't. They we­re just or­di­nary figh­ters, and wo­uldn't be tra­ined or prac­ti­ced in such ca­re­ful ob­ser­va­ti­on and de­duc­ti­on. They we­re pro­bably just imp­res­sed by the bo­ut that he and Gel had comp­le­ted-and per­haps a lit­tle stun­ned at its blo­od­less out­co­me.</p>
   <p>    Part of the­ir awe might very well ha­ve be­en due to the lack of scars on Ka­eth's body and his own. In the old met­hods of tra­ining, at so­me po­int, when two figh­ters met, they wo­uld co­vertly re­ad true ex­per­ti­se in mar­ti­al arts not by the num­ber of wo­unds col­lec­ted over the ye­ars, but by the ab­sen­ce of scar­ring. An un­mar­ked body in the­ir world me­ant eit­her that one's lord va­lu­ed one so highly that he gran­ted the use of ma­gic in he­aling, or that a figh­ter's ref­le­xes we­re so swift and mo­ve­ment so agi­le that no op­po­nent ever got a chan­ce to land a blow. Ne­it­her he nor Ka­eth we­re mar­red by mo­re than a few tri­vi­al li­nes, long he­aled.</p>
   <p>    As Gel emer­ged from the cas­ca­de of wa­ter and sho­ok his he­ad li­ke a dog, he ca­ught Ka­eth watc­hing out of the cor­ner of his eye; Ka­eth knew he'd be­en ca­ught, and unex­pec­tedly grin­ned. "You ga­ve me the best bo­ut I've had in a long ti­me, fri­end," he sa­id, pitc­hing his vo­ice just lo­ud eno­ugh to be he­ard over the so­und of the wa­ter-cas­ca­de. "I'm imp­res­sed."</p>
   <p>    "So am I," Gel ad­mit­ted fre­ely, as the circ­le of si­lent gla­di­ators stra­ined the­ir ears to he­ar every syllab­le eit­her of them spo­ke. "And I don't mind sa­ying that if you'd had the be­ne­fit of Lord Kyrti­an's system to tra­in un­der, you'd be so much bet­ter than me that it wo­uldn't ha­ve be­en a con­test."</p>
   <p>    "I wo­uldn't know abo­ut that," Ka­eth rep­li­ed, qu­ickly eno­ugh to sal­ve Gel's bru­ised ego. "But if I'm any jud­ge of Lord Kyn-dreth, he'll be using this system of yo­urs be­fo­re the month is out. And if he do­es, every ot­her lord will do the sa­me, or be tho­ught ho­pe­les­sly pro­vin­ci­al and out-of-step. With eno­ugh ap­pro­val be­hind him, he might well man­da­te this system thro­ugh the Co­un­cil."</p>
   <p>    The en­circ­ling men let out a sup­pres­sed sigh; so that was what they had be­en wa­iting to he­ar, and per­haps Ka­eth had known that. Gel sympat­hi­zed; such news wo­uld be li­ke a rep­ri­eve from a de­ath-sen­ten­ce.</p>
   <p>    Like? By the Stars, it is a rep­ri­eve from a de­ath-sen­ten­ce! I won­der how many of the­ir com­ra­des we­re kil­led in tra­ining, and how many mo­re kil­led in fe­ud-com­bat or the­ir mas­ters' en­ter­ta­in­ments? Now the only thing they 'II ha­ve to fe­ar is be­ing draf­ted in­to the Old Lords 'Army and sent up aga­inst the re­bels or the Wi­zards.</p>
   <p>    "I da­re say you're right," Gel ag­re­ed, wa­ving his hand in front of the cas­ca­de to stop it, then re­ac­hing for a to­wel from the rack be­hind him. At that po­int, a ser­vant ap­pe­ared to sum­mon the gla­di­ators to the­ir res­pec­ti­ve lords for the re­turn to the­ir ho­me es­ta­tes, and with pal­pab­le di­sap­po­int­ment, the two gro­ups of men fi­led out of the pre­pa­ra­ti­on ro­om.</p>
   <p>    Kaeth wa­ved his own hand at the cas­ca­de be­ne­ath which he'd be­en stan­ding, and the so­und of rus­hing wa­ter was rep­la­ced by si­len­ce. He se­ized a to­wel and dri­ed him­self, then wrap­ped it aro­und his wa­ist as Gel al­re­ady had and exc­han­ged a wry smi­le with his com­pa­ni­on. "Alo­ne at last!" he sa­id.</p>
   <p>    Gel chuck­led, wa­rily. For an as­sas­sin, this man had a re­mar­kab­le sen­se of hu­mor and no re­ti­cen­ce abo­ut sho­wing it. "I wo­uld hardly ha­ve tho­ught my con­ver­sa­ti­on was that ent­ran­cing."</p>
   <p>    Surely he's he­re by ac­ci­dent. As­sas­sins are nor­mal­ly sent aga­inst key hu­mans in an El­ven­lord's en­to­ura­ge, and the­re was no way of kno­wing who wo­uld be pla­ying body­gu­ard to Kyrt-ian. Was the­re?</p>
   <p>    "It's bet­ter than the­irs." Ka­eth jer­ked his he­ad in the di­rec­ti­on of the exit do­or. "Tho­se po­or block­he­ads don't ha­ve much to talk abo­ut ex­cept figh­ting, fo­od, and sex. If they'd got­ten up the co­ura­ge to spe­ak to us, you'd ha­ve fo­und that out."</p>
   <p>    Gel ra­ised an eyeb­row. "Well, they're yo­ung," he po­in­ted out, as he fol­lo­wed Ka­eth ca­re­ful­ly in­to the ma­in ro­om.</p>
   <p>    "And un­der the old system, not li­kely to get ol­der," Ka­eth re­tor­ted, get­ting his clot­hing off the sho­ul­der-high shelf be­si­de him, and la­ying it out on a po­lis­hed wo­oden bench. "How old's yo­ur ol­dest figh­ter?"</p>
   <p>    Gel con­si­de­red his reply ca­re­ful­ly be­fo­re ans­we­ring, using the op­por­tu­nity to lay out his own ge­ar as a chan­ce to stall a lit­tle. "If you co­unt re­ti­red figh­ters who co­uld still pick up a we­apon in de­fen­se of the es­ta­te-the ol­dest just tur­ned se­venty-eight."</p>
   <p>    Kaeth was ac­tu­al­ly ta­ken aback, and let out a low whist­le as he re­ac­hed for his trews. "I don't know that I've ever se­en a hu­man that old, much less a figh­ter! You me­an yo­ur lord ac­tu­al­ly puts his old men out to pas­tu­re ins­te­ad of put­ting them down? Gre­at An­ces­tors, man, how many of the­se re­ti­red figh­ters ha­ve you got?"</p>
   <p>    "I'm not su­re," Gel rep­li­ed, his sus­pi­ci­ons aro­used. He's as­king too many qu­es­ti­ons. He's a tra­ined as­sas­sin, 1 know he is- what if he's tar­ge­ting Kyrti­an?</p>
   <p>    It was pos­sib­le-Lord Kyndreth co­uld be a pat­ron and ally of the ob­no­xi­o­us Ael­mar­kin. It might be that he wo­uld wa­it just long eno­ugh to le­arn Kyrti­an's tra­ining-tech­ni­que, then eli­mi­na­te Ael­mar­kin's in­con­ve­ni­ent co­usin.</p>
   <p>    In fact he might ha­ve be­en bro­ught to get rid of Kyrti­an right he­re and now, which was why Kyrti­an got the in­vi­ta­ti­on in the first pla­ce! May­be that's why Lord Kyndreth wants to co­me to our es­ta­te now, to get the sec­ret, then get rid of Kyrti­an whe­re the­re aren 't any wit­nes­ses-and may­be get rid of the Lady at the sa­me ti­me!</p>
   <p>    By now, Gel had got­ten his se­cond wind, and such alar­ming tho­ughts only inc­re­ased his energy. And Ka­eth, all un­sus­pec­ting, had ac­tu­al­ly tur­ned his back to him. If the­re was ever a ti­me when a tra­ined as­sas­sin wo­uld be vul­ne­rab­le, this was it.</p>
   <p>    Gel didn't even pa­use for a bre­ath; he ac­ted. He had be­en bent over, tying his bo­ots; now wit­ho­ut war­ning, he tur­ned his po­se in­to a char­ge, sta­ying cro­uc­hed over and rus­hing Ka­eth, sho­ul­de­ring him in­to the wall fa­ce-first. He he­ard Ka­eth grunt as he hit the wall, but be­fo­re he co­uld se­cu­re the as­sas­sin, Ka­eth writ­hed lo­ose a trif­le. His re­ac­ti­ons we­re as swift as a ser­pent's, and he ma­na­ged to get him­self tur­ned aro­und, but not be­fo­re Gel grab­bed a wrist in eit­her hand and smas­hed them in­to the wall, then got his knee up to re­in­for­ce his hold. Now Gel had Ka­eth pin­ned aga­inst the wall with both wrists imp­ri­so­ned over his he­ad and Gel's knee in his gut.</p>
   <p>    His legs are still free. If he can kick my leg out from un­der me-</p>
   <p>    Flushed, but im­pas­si­ve, he sta­red in­to Gel's grey-vi­olet eyes for a long mo­ment as Gel wa­ited for him to spe­ak or act. His wrists un­der Gel's hands sho­wed no sign of ten­si­on, nor was the­re any in­di­ca­ti­on that he in­ten­ded re­sis­tan­ce or strug­gle.</p>
   <p>    But that co­uld be a ru­se to get me to drop my gu­ard.</p>
   <p>    "I sup­po­se it's too much to ask what promp­ted this-ah- rat­her unex­pec­ted ac­ti­on of yo­urs?" he fi­nal­ly as­ked mildly, a bit out of bre­ath, but comp­le­tely po­li­te, in spi­te of the si­tu­ati­on.</p>
   <p>    Gel gla­red at him, but he didn't drop his eyes. "I sup­po­se you're go­ing to deny you're an as­sas­sin," he rep­li­ed flatly.</p>
   <p>    "Ah!" The exp­res­si­on­less eyes now ref­lec­ted un­ders­tan­ding, and the mo­uth re­la­xed a trif­le in a fa­int smi­le. 'Wow I un­ders­tand! You think Lord Kyndreth has tar­ge­ted me at you-or per­haps, yo­ur mas­ter! Be at ease, fri­end; Lord Kyrti­an is in no dan­ger that I know of, ot­her than from his own con­ni­ving co­usin. And you're in no dan­ger at all, le­ast of all from me."</p>
   <p>    It felt ho­nest. Gel wan­ted to be­li­eve him.</p>
   <p>    "But you don't deny you're an as­sas­sin-" Gel's ins­tincts war­red with his in­tel­lect. His ins­tincts and his sen­ses swo­re that Ka­eth was tel­ling the truth-his mo­re cyni­cal mind war­ned him that this was just a trick. Still, he was very temp­ted to re­le­ase the fel­low; this just didn't se­em li­ke a lie.</p>
   <p>    "Hardly, sin­ce you se­em to ha­ve ca­ught me as one," Ka­eth rep­li­ed, with a surp­ri­sing amo­unt of hu­mor. "Altho­ugh my own Lord isn't ne­arly as ob­ser­vant as you, sin­ce he is to­tal­ly una­wa­re of my tra­ining; I went to him, bo­ught at auc­ti­on af­ter the unlamented de­ath of my old lord. Still, on­ce an as­sas­sin, as they say, the clo­ak ne­ver drops from yo­ur sho­ul­ders-so I'll qu­alify it by ad­mit­ting for Lyon Lord Kyndreth, I'm an ac­ti­ve agent, but an inac­ti­ve as­sas­sin, nor am I ever li­kely to let him know of my mo­re eso­te­ric abi­li­ti­es."</p>
   <p>    "Huh." Slowly, ca­re­ful­ly, Gel roc­ked his we­ight back on­to his own fe­et, and re­le­ased Ka­eth's wrists. Just as slowly, Ka­eth drop­ped his hands from the wall and rub­bed, then fle­xed, his wrists, tes­ting them. "And just how did you be­co­me an inac­ti­ve as­sas­sin?"</p>
   <p>    "Look for yo­ur­self." Ka­eth re­ac­hed up and pul­led the neck of his tu­nic open, then til­ted his chin up so that Gel co­uld see his sla­ve-col­lar cle­arly. It wasn't the se­al of Lyon Lord Kyndreth the­re, but that of the de­ce­ased-and, as Ka­eth had sa­id, un­la­men­ted-Lord Dyran.</p>
   <p>    Things we­re be­gin­ning to add up.</p>
   <p>    The nob­le Lord Dyran, who tra­ined all man­ner of sla­ves in skills best left une­xa­mi­ned… and who­se es­ta­te was bro­ken up and di­vi­ded among his re­la­ti­ves, with what was left go­ing to auc­ti­on. And that was whe­re I saw anot­her as­sas­sin!</p>
   <p>    That se­al co­uldn't pos­sibly be co­un­ter­fe­ited, eit­her. The fact that he was still we­aring Dyran's col­lar me­ant that he'd be­en cla­imed af­ter Dyran's de­ath-other­wi­se the new mas­ter wo­uld in­sist on ha­ving the old col­lar re­mo­ved and his own put on. Gel bac­ked up, gi­ving him a lit­tle mo­re spa­ce. "Inte­res­ting."</p>
   <p>    "My be­lo­ved for­mer mas­ter," Ka­eth sa­id, with a to­uch of iro­nic inf­lec­ti­on on the word "be­lo­ved" that did not es­ca­pe Gel's no­ti­ce, "Was not the sort of El­ven­lord to for­get the tra­di­ti­ons of his An­ces­tors."</p>
   <p>    "Including as­sas­si­na­ti­on?" Gel rep­li­ed evenly.</p>
   <p>    Kaeth nod­ded with a dig­nity that imp­res­sed Gel in spi­te of him­self. "Even so. I was tra­ined from child­ho­od, ha­ving shown unu­su­al abi­lity for get­ting in­to and out of sup­po­sedly gu­ar­ded spa­ces and pla­ces wit­ho­ut be­ing ca­ught. Whet­her or not you cho­ose to be­li­eve me, I will say that my tra­ining was ne­ver emp­lo­yed aga­inst El­ven­lords…"</p>
   <p>    "Not that Dyran wo­uld ha­ve he­si­ta­ted if he'd tho­ught he could get away with it," Gel in­te­rj­ec­ted. Aga­in, Ka­eth nod­ded, this ti­me with a shrug.</p>
   <p>    "Be that as it may, my usu­al tasks we­re to act as his in­tel­li­gen­ce agent, which is how I was emp­lo­yed at the ti­me of his de­mi­se. And, not kno­wing any bet­ter, that is how my ta­lents we­re ad­ver­ti­sed when the es­ta­te was bro­ken up and the sla­ves went to auc­ti­on, as an agent and body­gu­ard." Ka­eth tur­ned his palms up, and shrug­ged his sho­ul­ders aga­in.</p>
   <p>    "And you, of co­ur­se, we­re un­der no com­pul­si­on to en­ligh­ten the auc­ti­one­ers.” Gel felt a re­luc­tant smi­le cre­eping over his lips; if this story was true, Ka­eth was a very cle­ver fel­low in­de­ed. Hardly li­kely he 'd tell them, when it was a lot mo­re li­kely that the ot­her El­ven­lords wo­uld or­der him dest­ro­yed rat­her than ta­ke the chan­ce of one of the­ir num­ber get­ting his hands on a tra­ined as­sas­sin. "I don't sup­po­se it ever oc­cur­red to you to bolt?"</p>
   <p>    "Of co­ur­se it did," Ka­eth rep­li­ed, and sat down on the bench, in­di­ca­ting to Gel that he sho­uld do the sa­me. "Oh, don't worry abo­ut an­yo­ne over­he­aring us. If the­re had be­en an­yo­ne lis­te­ning or watc­hing, they'd ha­ve be­en in he­re the mo­ment you went for my thro­at. I cost Kyndreth a very pretty penny, and he'd ta­ke it per­so­nal­ly if so­me­one dep­ri­ved him of my ser­vi­ces."</p>
   <p>    And this co­uld be a set-up, but it's get­ting rat­her too un­li­kely and comp­li­ca­ted-no, I think I'll go with my ins­tincts and ta­ke him at his word.</p>
   <p>    "Naturally, it oc­cur­red to me to flee to the Wi­zards and the Wild Hu­mans," he re­pe­ated, "But-well, 1 le­ar­ned a few things abo­ut the­se col­lars that I wasn't sup­po­sed to. Only Dyran co­uld com­pel me ma­gi­cal­ly, and on­ce he was de­ad, no ot­her El­ven-lord can harm me thro­ugh this col­lar, un­less he is Dyran's equ­al or bet­ter in po­wer. That was a re­ason to run. But Dyran was as cle­ver a bas­tard as his re­pu­ta­ti­on cla­imed-I can still be tra­ced and pur­su­ed thro­ugh the col­lar, and any at­tempt to ta­ke it off will dep­ri­ve me of my he­ad. That was Dyran's lit­tle fa­il-sa­fe in ca­se an­yo­ne ever de­ci­ded to sub­vert me."</p>
   <p>    Gel win­ced; that to­ok po­wer­ful ma­gic, and it to­ok a par­ti­cu­larly cru­el mind to think of it.</p>
   <p>    "So, on the who­le, it se­emed bet­ter for ever­yo­ne that I turn myself in as one of Dyran's sla­ves and go up for auc­ti­on with the rest," Ka­eth conc­lu­ded with a lazy smi­le. "After all, I still had the op­ti­on to bolt if my new mas­ter pro­ved un­be­arab­le, and I'd be ab­le to plan my es­ca­pe so that I'd ha­ve a de­cent chan­ce to get so far away be­fo­re they dis­co­ve­red I was mis­sing that it wo­uldn't be worth pur­su­it. At the ti­me of Dyran's de­ath I was in a po­si­ti­on whe­re that wasn't a pos­si­bi­lity."</p>
   <p>    "What if Kyndreth ever finds out from anot­her of Dyran's sla­ves-" Gel be­gan, but Ka­eth in­ter­rup­ted him with a gent­le sha­ke of his he­ad.</p>
   <p>    "It's not li­kely, sin­ce ever­yo­ne who ever knew what I was tra­ined for is de­ad-mostly at Dyran's hands, I might add." For just a mo­ment, the­re was a sha­de of bit­ter­ness in his vo­ice, but he qu­ickly co­ve­red it. "And of all the Old Lords, frankly, Kyndreth is the le­ast li­kely to use an as­sas­sin. He's po­wer­ful eno­ugh to do his own dirty work, and ruth­less eno­ugh to enj­oy do­ing so. No, I'm out of the bu­si­ness, un­less for so­me re­ason it be­co­mes ne­ces­sary to re-enter it long eno­ugh to pro­tect myself. On the who­le, I'm rat­her enj­oying myself. Kyndreth tre­ats ex­pen­si­ve pro­perty well, and my du­ti­es are light, com­pa­red to tho­se I had un­der Dyran."</p>
   <p>    Gel didn't miss the ve­iled thre­at in tho­se words, but he shrug­ged them off. "I don't gi­ve a flying damn what you do with yo­ur skills, as long as you're not tar­ge­ting Kyrti­an." He co­uldn't help it; a no­te of fi­er­ce pro­tec­ti­ve­ness crept in­to his vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    Kaeth blin­ked slowly, and lo­oked de­eply and pe­net­ra­tingly in­to Gel's eyes for a mo­ment. "Inte­res­ting," he mur­mu­red. "I'd he­ard ru­mors abo­ut Lord Kyrti­an's pe­op­le…"</p>
   <p>    Then he sho­ok his he­ad, as if it was no con­se­qu­en­ce. "I over­he­ar a gre­at de­al, as all body­gu­ards do, and Kyndreth has the usu­al fa­iling of our mas­ters that he for­gets how much his sla­ves see and he­ar. I ho­pe you will be­li­eve me when I tell you that Kyndreth's plans are such, and so comp­lex, that it is un­li­kely he co­uld ever fit a tra­ined as­sas­sin in­to them with any deg­ree of con­fi­den­ce."</p>
   <p>    "Maybe aga­inst the Old Lords, and the lords that ha­ven't revolted," Gel obj­ec­ted, "but what abo­ut the Yo­ung Lords who are still in re­volt?"</p>
   <p>    "A ba­re pos­si­bi­lity if they ac­tu­al­ly de­ve­lo­ped a le­ader with eno­ugh cha­ris­ma to ma­ke them all work to­get­her." Ka­eth ad­mit­ted. "But it's mo­re li­kely that cat­tle will fly be­fo­re that hap­pens. And be­si­des, even if he did, sons aren't so thick on the gro­und that the vic­tim's re­la­ti­ves wo­uld be very happy that the er­rant lad had be­en eli­mi­na­ted rat­her than re­tur­ned to the pa­ren­tal fold." He smi­led, but this ti­me the­re was no hu­mor in it. "After all, a yo­ungs­ter who has had all tho­ughts of re­bel­li­on ne­atly wi­ped from his mind can still func­ti­on to si­re the next ge­ne­ra­ti­on, even if the rest of the ti­me all he do­es is sit in a cor­ner and dro­ol."</p>
   <p>    That shoc­ked Gel; he'd he­ard ru­mors that so­me of the Old Lords had the abi­lity to tam­per with anot­her El­ven­lord's mind and me­mory, but this was the first ti­me an­yo­ne had sa­id anyt­hing that con­fir­med what he had pri­va­tely tho­ught was a rat­her wild ta­le.</p>
   <p>    He did his best to se­em as nonc­ha­lant abo­ut it as Ka­eth was, ho­we­ver. "Put­ting it that way-I sup­po­se you're right. Kyn-dreth wo­uld get no joy from the sur­vi­ving re­la­ti­ves if he wi­ped out an he­ir, no mat­ter how they felt abo­ut that he­ir when he was ali­ve." He sho­ok his he­ad, and al­lo­wed his dis­gust and baf­fle­ment to show. "Damn, but this is as twis­ted as ball of sna­kes! How do you ma­ke it all out?"</p>
   <p>    "Early tra­ining, mostly." Now Ka­eth ac­tu­al­ly re­la­xed, and for the first ti­me, Gel saw him drop all of his de­fen­si­ve man­ne­risms. He knew that he was me­ant to see that-and he ins­tinc­ti­vely knew that Ka­eth now trus­ted him as far as he had ever trus­ted an­yo­ne but him­self. "Po­li­tics among the El­ven­lords-it's con­si­de­red a high art. So­me­ti­mes I think it's a pity that no one will ever know how ac­comp­lis­hed an ar­tist I am but myself."</p>
   <p>    Gel had to chuck­le at that, and Ka­eth smi­led-a re­al, un­mas­ked smi­le-in ans­wer. "Well, I'm a pla­in man, and I tell you now that I'd rat­her map bat­tle­fi­eld stra­tegy than po­li­ti­cal stra­tegy any day."</p>
   <p>    "It's cle­aner." The reg­ret in that vo­ice was so de­ep that Gel co­uld ha­ve drow­ned in it. For a mo­ment, they both fell si­lent, then Ka­eth co­ug­hed. "Well-be­fo­re Lord Kyndreth won­ders what is ta­king me so long, and sum­mons me-what can you tell me abo­ut this tra­ining met­hod of Lord Kyrti­an's?"</p>
   <p>    Gel stu­di­ed his exp­res­si­on, and ca­me to an in­te­res­ting conc­lu­si­on. He ap­pro­ves. Gran­ted, if his mas­ter asks what we we­re tal­king abo­ut, this will gi­ve him so­met­hing to fe­ed to him, but he al­so ap­pro­ves of this and wants to know for him­self. Fas­ci­na­ting. I wo­uldn 't ha­ve tho­ught that an as­sas­sin wo­uld be in­te­res­ted in pre­ser­ving li­ves.</p>
   <p>    "He's do­ing so­met­hing with his ma­gic that's ini­ti­al­ly comp­li­ca­ted to set up, but do­esn't ta­ke a gre­at de­al of po­wer," Gel ad­mit­ted. "That's what he's told me, any­way. Not be­ing a lord, I don't know the mec­ha­nics of it." He bro­oded a mo­ment, thin­king back to the first ti­me that Kyndreth set the spells. "The­re are two dif­fe­rent pi­eces of ma­gic in­vol­ved: one to cre­ate a we­apon that lo­oks and fe­els re­al, but has no mo­re subs­tan­ce than an il­lu­si­on; and the ot­her that he sets on the figh­ter that works with the we­apon and re­acts to what the we­apon do­es."</p>
   <p>    "Senses it, you me­an?" Ka­eth as­ked, his eyes in­tent.</p>
   <p>    "I gu­ess that's clo­se, as clo­se as anyt­hing a hu­man can un­ders­tand." Gel lic­ked his lips. "Anyway, that se­cond spell is what ma­kes the glow and the shock when you're hit. The first ti­me he did it, it to­ok him most of the day; he says it gets easi­er as you get used to it. And ac­cor­ding to him, it's al­most as simp­le to work the spells on a lot of pe­op­le as it is to cast them for one-he sa­id so­met­hing on­ce abo­ut gi­ving the ma­gic ext­ra energy and it co­pi­es it­self for as long as you fe­ed it." He la­ug­hed with em­bar­ras­sment. "That pro­bably so­unds stu­pid, but that's the best I can tell you."</p>
   <p>    "No, no, it ma­kes sen­se," Ka­eth told him. "I've he­ard them tal­king abo­ut that, when they want to cre­ate a lot of so­met­hing, li­ke tre­es or flo­wers-do­ing the first one, then set­ting it to copy it­self. That's how they can tell the dif­fe­ren­ce bet­we­en the il­lu­si­on that a re­al­ly po­wer­ful lord cre­ates, and one cre­ated by an un­der­ling. You ne­ver see a po­wer­ful lord ma­king co­pi­es; in his il­lu­si­ons, every tree, every flo­wer is dif­fe­rent."</p>
   <p>    "Whatever. That's the best desc­rip­ti­on I can tell you." He pon­de­red a mo­ment, then de­ci­ded to gi­ve Ka­eth so­me in­for­mation that, sho­uld he fe­ed it back to Lord Kyndreth, wo­uld be a pro­tec­ti­on for Kyrti­an rat­her than a dan­ger. "Kyrti­an has as many re­gu­lar figh­ters as any ot­her Gre­at Lord, but I ha­ve to tell you, all we do is prac­ti­ce-eit­her in da­ily drill using his met­hod, or in ac­tu­al bat­tle-si­mu­la­ti­ons. That's the re­gu­lar figh­ters. On­ce a figh­ter is over forty, he go­es on light-duty; he has so­me ot­her job, but ke­eps in prac­ti­ce-archery prac­ti­ce, mostly, tho­ugh so­me of them ke­ep the­ir sword and spe­ar work right up to the­ir old stan­dards."</p>
   <p>    "Which me­ans you don't just ha­ve gla­di­ators, you ha­ve an army, tra­ined to fight to­get­her." Ka­eth pul­led on his lo­wer lip. "And you ha­ve a back-up corps of tho­se ol­der men. In­te­res­ting. Only a fo­ol wo­uld chal­len­ge yo­ur Lord."</p>
   <p>    That was sa­id as a sta­te­ment, not a qu­es­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Good. Let Kyndreth chew on that! "Exactly," Gel nod­ded. "That's be­ca­use Lord Kyrti­an li­kes to see how bat­tle-stra­tegy re­al­ly works, rat­her than just re­ading abo­ut it. We work out new com­bat si­mu­la­ti­ons fa­irly of­ten, be­ca­use un­less so­me­one steps in­to a ho­le and bre­aks a leg or so­met­hing equ­al­ly stu­pid, we co­me out of com­bat with the sa­me num­ber of figh­ters we went in­to it with."</p>
   <p>    "It's a dam­ned go­od system," Ka­eth ag­re­ed, fi­nal­ly. "So go­od, it ma­kes me won­der what the ad­van­ta­ge is to Lord Kyrti­an. Tra­ined figh­ters co­uld re­volt, if they put the­ir minds to it," Gel la­ug­hed easily. "Well, for one thing, the­re aren't any re­al we­apons aro­und whe­re we can get hold of them. They're all loc­ked up in the ar­mory un­der Kyrti­an's se­al."</p>
   <p>    "So he do­esn't ha­ve to worry abo­ut a sla­ve-re­volt." Ka­eth's fa­ce cle­ared, and he nod­ded.</p>
   <p>    "And, of co­ur­se, kno­wing you aren't go­ing to get inj­ured or kil­led ma­kes the men wil­ling to prac­ti­ce."</p>
   <p>    "He wo­uldn't ha­ve the ex­pen­se of bu­ying or ra­ising rep­la­ce­ments, eit­her." Ka­eth sig­hed in open ad­mi­ra­ti­on. "Bril­li­ant stra­tegy, es­pe­ci­al­ly for so­me­one with no po­li­ti­cal al­li­es. Af­ter to­day, no one will da­re chal­len­ge him to a fe­ud; his po­si­ti­on is se­cu­re aga­inst all nor­mal ave­nu­es of chal­len­ge. I wo­uld ne­ver ha­ve tho­ught it, gi­ven his re­pu­ta­ti­on."</p>
   <p>    "Not exactly bad stra­tegy to ma­ke the ot­hers un­der­ra­te him until he was re­ady, was it?" Gel sa­id slyly, and Ka­eth ac­tu­al­ly la­ug­hed.</p>
   <p>    Gel had the imp­res­si­on now that des­pi­te his si­nis­ter tra­ining, Ka­eth Jared was a pretty de­cent sort, and that surp­ri­sed him, mo­re than a lit­tle. He'd al­ways con­si­de­red as­sas­sins to be-</p>
   <p>    To be scum, ac­tu­al­ly. I sus­pect most of them are. This one, tho­ugh-well, he's got my res­pect.</p>
   <p>    His tho­ughts we­re in­ter­rup­ted by a disc­re­et co­ugh from the do­or, whe­re a pa­ir of yo­ung lads in Ael­mar­kin's li­very sto­od une­asily. "Yo­ur Lords-" the ne­arest sa­id, a tre­mor in his vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    "Our Lords re­qu­ire us," Ka­eth sup­pli­ed with a nod. Sud­denly the mask drop­ped over his fa­ce and he was all co­ol sur­fa­ce aga­in, re­mo­te and un­re­adab­le. "Of co­ur­se, im­me­di­ately."</p>
   <p>    Gel sto­od only a frac­ti­on be­hind Ka­eth, who tur­ned and of­fe­red his hand. "It was a ple­asu­re in every sen­se," Ka­eth sa­id, the warmth of his to­ne bel­ying his lack of exp­res­si­on. "I wo­uld li­ke to me­et you aga­in un­der si­mi­lar cir­cums­tan­ces."</p>
   <p>    Gel clas­ped the of­fe­red hand so­lemnly. "I ho­pe that we can," he rep­li­ed as warmly, "and I lo­ok for­ward to it."</p>
   <p>    And with that, they par­ted. As Gel fol­lo­wed his gu­ide, he won­de­red what Ka­eth's emo­ti­ons we­re. He didn't think he was mis­ta­ken; so­met­hing had re­so­na­ted bet­we­en them.</p>
   <p>    Maybe not fri­ends­hip, at le­ast not yet, he de­ci­ded, as he saw Kyrti­an wa­iting up ahe­ad with a sen­se of re­li­ef that the or­de­al was fi­nal­ly over. But de­fi­ni­tely ad­mi­ra­ti­on. And ne­it­her of us wants to ever ha­ve to kill the ot­her. That has to co­unt for so­met­hing!</p>

   <p>    Kyrtian pas­sed thro­ugh the Por­tal, which on Ael­mar­kin's si­de was a gre­at gil­ded bas-re­li­ef ga­te wi­de and tall eno­ugh for a car­go-wa­gon to pass thro­ugh, and on the ma­nor si­de was an or­na­tely-car­ved wo­oden do­or with a high lintel fe­atu­ring the fa­mily crest. He had be­en in a pro­fo­undly tho­ught­ful sta­te of mind from the mo­ment that he had par­ted with Lord Kyndreth, and Gel didn't in­ter­rupt his mu­sings by trying to talk to him. Then aga­in, it was en­ti­rely li­kely that Gel was too ti­red to talk, which didn't hurt Kyrti­an's fe­elings in the le­ast.</p>
   <p>    Longstanding fa­mily tra­di­ti­on of ca­uti­on si­tu­ated the Por­tal in­si­de a small cham­ber with walls of sto­ne and a loc­ked do­or of fi­re-to­ug­he­ned bron­ze as in­su­ran­ce aga­inst an enemy using it to pe­net­ra­te the he­art of the ma­nor. In­vi­ted gu­ests we­re met he­re by an es­cort and let out, and the cham­ber it­self wo­uld hold no mo­re than ten at the most. The "key" to un­lock the do­or was the pre­sen­ce of a fa­mily mem­ber or so­me­one el­se (li­ke Gel) to whom the lock had be­en sen­si­ti­zed. Of co­ur­se, it was pos­sib­le to over­po­wer the es­cort and open the cham­ber do­or that way, but the do­or was gu­ar­ded every mo­ment of every day, and at le­ast one gu­ard wo­uld be ab­le to ra­ise an alarm. The­re wo­uld be no in­va­si­ons of the es­ta­te thro­ugh this Por­tal-or so it was ho­ped. Af­ter all of his stu­di­es in mi­li­tary tac­tics, Kyrti­an was only too awa­re that a cle­ver com­man­der co­uld think of ways to get past the­ir pre­ca­uti­ons. His only com­fort was that most of the El­ven­lords we­re not very cle­ver com­man­ders.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian par­ted with Gel just out­si­de the Por­tal Cham­ber, as the gu­ards tri­ed to pre­tend they we­ren't eavesd­rop­ping. "Well, we're in for it now," he sa­id, in ming­led pri­de and chag­rin. "I think this is the hig­hest-ran­ked mem­ber of the Gre­at Co­un­cil to co­me he­re sin­ce Grand­fat­her's day, and we're go­ing to ha­ve to ma­ke cer­ta­in ever­yo­ne is to­tal­ly pre­pa­red and un­ders­tands what they ne­ed to do. The so­oner we start pre­pa­ring the staff and ser­vants for Lord Kyndreth's vi­sit, the so­oner we can get it over with, and then everyt­hing can go back to nor­mal."</p>
   <p>    "And the lon­ger we de­lay, the mo­re we risk an in­sult. Don't worry, I'm on it," the Ser­ge­ant sa­id with a wa­ve. "You go bre­ak the news to the Lady."</p>
   <p>    Gel ma­de for the tra­ining-qu­ar­ters at a trot, and Kyrti­an ref­lec­ted that the Ser­ge­ant was pro­bably al­re­ady fi­ve steps ahe­ad of him in plan­ning things. And one thing was ab­so­lu­tely certain; the vi­sit co­uld not ta­ke pla­ce un­til every ser­vant on the es­ta­te was so well-re­he­ar­sed in the ap­prop­ri­ate con­duct of a sla­ve that not­hing wo­uld for­ce him to de­part from it, not in­sult, not pu­nish­ment, and cer­ta­inly not ca­re­les­sness. Tho­se ser­vants clo­sest to Kyrti­an and his mot­her wo­uld ha­ve to be the best ac­tors of the lot, which me­ant that cer­ta­in of the yo­un­ger and less ex­pe­ri­en­ced ho­use-ser­vants (such as Lynder) wo­uld be rep­la­ced for the du­ra­ti­on with ot­hers who had be­en pro­mo­ted to ot­her po­si­ti­ons or had even re­ti­red. Kyrti­an wo­uld cer­ta­inly be do­ing wit­ho­ut most of his per­so­nal ser­vants, who wo­uld be at­ten­ding Lord Kyndreth, but that was a small pri­ce to pay for ke­eping up the de­cep­ti­on that this was a nor­mal El­ven ho­use­hold.</p>
   <p>    All that wo­uld be in the hands of Gel, Lady Lydi­ell, and Lord Te­neb­rinth the Se­nesc­hal, and the so­oner he let the last two know what was abo­ut to des­cend on them, the bet­ter. Gel was right; Lord Kyndreth's vi­sit co­uld not be post­po­ned for long wit­ho­ut of­fen­ding him.</p>
   <p>    He pa­used for a mo­ment to lo­ca­te both his mot­her and the Se­nesc­hal; this was no ti­me to was­te pre­ci­o­us mo­ments hun­ting for them by or­di­nary me­ans. The me­rest whis­per of ma­gic told him that, as was of­ten the ca­se at this ti­me of day, Te­neb­rinth was with his mot­her in the lat­ter's of­fi­ce, pro­bably go­ing over the ho­use­hold and es­ta­te ac­co­unts, ma­king plans for the next co­up­le of months, or de­aling with is­su­es of the ser­vants. That co­uld not pos­sibly ha­ve be­en bet­ter for Kyrti­an's pur­po­ses. By catc­hing them to­get­her, Kyrti­an wo­uld only ha­ve to go over the pros­pec­ti­ve vi­sit and the re­asons for it on­ce.</p>
   <p>    Lydiell's of­fi­ce was li­te­ral­ly at the cen­ter of the ma­nor, over­lo­oking everyt­hing. The ma­nor bo­as­ted fi­ve to­wers, one at each cor­ner and one at the cen­ter, with the cen­ter-most be­ing a go­od two sto­ri­es tal­ler than the ot­hers-a full twel­ve sto­ri­es tall. The to­wers ga­ve the ma­nor a lo­ok of de­li­cacy and at­te­nu­ati­on that Kyrti­an fo­und both at­trac­ti­ve and amu­singly de­cep­ti­ve, for the bu­il­ding it­self had be­en const­ruc­ted to sur­vi­ve a long si­ege, and had be­en bu­ilt to withs­tand si­ege we­apons that for the most part no lon­ger exis­ted. Lydi­ell's of­fi­ce was a glass-wal­led ro­om at the very tip of the cen­ter-most to­wer, a pla­ce that wo­uld, in wartime, be oc­cu­pi­ed by at le­ast fo­ur lo­oko­uts. Even in the worst we­at­her, it was a snug and wel­co­ming pla­ce, as the to­wer was one of the few pla­ces in the ma­nor that de­pen­ded on ma­gic for mo­re than ligh­ting and a de­co­ra­ti­ve il­lu­si­on or two. Ma­gic, and not mec­ha­ni­cal cont­ri­van­ces, he­ated and co­oled the to­wer and pro­tec­ted it from the worst we­at­her. Ma­gic al­so en­su­red the sa­fety of any oc­cu­pants of the trans­pa­rent tu­be he en­te­red at the bot­tom of the to­wer, po­we­ring the lit­tle plat­form un­der his fe­et that slowly ro­se thro­ugh the to­wer to the top. No hu­man co­uld use this cont­ri­van­ce by him­self, not even if that hu­man was bles­sed with the hu­mans' own form of ma­gic. In this way, when she wor­ked, Lydi­ell co­uld be as­su­red that no one co­uld in­ter­rupt her wit­ho­ut ha­ving to go first to one of el­ven blo­od. The­re we­re draw­backs to be­ing as ap­pro­ac­hab­le as the lords of this ma­nor had al­ways be­en; the short-li­ved hu­mans ten­ded to co­me to them with any prob­lem that had them stymi­ed for mo­re than a few mo­ments, as­su­ming that long ex­pe­ri­en­ce gran­ted un­fat­ho­mab­le wis­dom.</p>
   <p>    If it did that, the­re wo­uldn 't be a Yo­ung Lords' War now. The Old Lords wo­uld ha­ve known bet­ter than to let them get as far as they did. And the­re wo­uldn't ha­ve be­en a se­cond Wi­zard War eit­her.</p>
   <p>    The in­ter­ve­ning flo­ors of the to­wer we­re, for the most part, un­fur­nis­hed, alt­ho­ugh this was the ol­dest sec­ti­on of the ma­nor and everyt­hing el­se had be­en const­ruc­ted aro­und it. The ro­und ro­oms we­re too small to use for anyt­hing but of­fi­ces, and only Lydi­ell and Te­neb­rinth had ne­ed of an of­fi­ce. So Kyrti­an pas­sed ro­om af­ter ro­und, empty, ala­bas­ter-wal­led ro­om with not­hing mo­re to en­ter­ta­in him than bri­ef glimp­ses of the out­si­de thro­ugh the we­apon-slits that ser­ved in pla­ce of win­dows. Even the lo­ok of ala­bas­ter was de­cep­ti­ve; the to­wer was bu­ilt of so­met­hing far stron­ger, tho­ugh too much ma­gic went in­to the const­ruc­ti­on of the ma­te­ri­al for an­yo­ne to use it the­se days. This to­wer was an ar­ti­fact of the first fifty ye­ars af­ter the El­ves cros­sed out of Eve­lon, when no one knew if this world wo­uld pro­ve to be as dan­ge­ro­us as the one they had left, a ti­me when the el­ven-born exis­ted as clo­sely crow­ded to­get­her as any of the primitive hu­mans in the­ir huts, and wa­ited for so­met­hing in­fi­ni­tely mo­re dan­ge­ro­us to des­cend wit­ho­ut war­ning than a mob of we­ak, short-li­ved hu­mans.</p>
   <p>    Tenebrinth's of­fi­ce, just be­low Lydi­ell's, was empty and un-te­nan­ted as Kyrti­an had an­ti­ci­pa­ted. That of­fi­ce, and Lydi­ell's, we­re ne­arly do­ub­le the si­ze of the ro­oms be­low them. The walls swel­led out he­re, gi­ving the to­wer the lo­ok of a de­ep pla­te or shal­low bowl ba­lan­ced on a cand­les­tick and co­ve­red with a ro­und, po­in­ted sil­ver dish co­ver that was the over­han­ging (and pro­j­ec­ti­le-pro­of) ro­of. The win­dows in Te­neb­rinth's of­fi­ce we­re only half the si­ze of the ones in Lydi­ell's, but we­re gla­zed with the sa­me im­per­vi­o­us subs­tan­ce used ins­te­ad of or­di­nary glass in every ope­ning of this to­wer. Light that ca­me thro­ugh this subs­tan­ce lost so­me of its co­lor and strength, ma­king it ap­pe­ar as if the of­fi­ce lay un­der­wa­ter.</p>
   <p>    Now Kyrti­an he­ard vo­ices, and as he ro­se thro­ugh the ce­iling of Te­neb­rinth's of­fi­ce in­to that of Lady Lydi­ell, Lord Te­ne-brinth him­self got up from his cha­ir to gre­et him. Lady Lydi­ell re­ma­ined se­ated, but wel­co­med her son with a smi­le and an ex­ten­ded hand.</p>
   <p>    Tenebrinth was a lit­tle ol­der than Kyrti­an's fat­her wo­uld ha­ve be­en had he still be­en ali­ve, ha­ving ap­pren­ti­ced in the po­si­ti­on of Se­nesc­hal un­der Kyrti­an's grand­fat­her. He had ser­ved in his of­fi­ci­al ca­pa­city for as long as Kyrti­an had known him, and as one of Kyrti­an's tu­tors as well. As with all El­ven­lords abo­ve a cer­ta­in age but be­low the po­int of be­ing con­si­de­red an­ci­ent, it was im­pos­sib­le to tell exactly how old he was. Tall, thin­ner and less mus­cu­lar than Lady Lydi­ell, with a long jaw and no­se and pro­mi­nent che­ek­bo­nes, ha­ir con­fi­ned with a sil­ver clasp at the na­pe of his neck, he lo­oked exactly li­ke what he was, a stu­di­o­us cre­atu­re, se­ri­o­us and ca­re­ful in tho­ught and spe­ech, a true scho­lar and thin­ker who pre­fer­red to jo­ust with his mind and not his body.</p>
   <p>    "Well, I see you sur­vi­ved yo­ur en­co­un­ter with the yo­ung tygers," the Se­nesc­hal sa­id ge­ni­al­ly. "Per­mit me to cong­ra­tu­la­te you."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian step­ped out of the tu­be, kis­sed the back of his mot­her's hand, and to­ok the cha­ir that the Se­nesc­hal of­fe­red him. "Be­li­eve me, it felt li­ke be­ing in a tyger-pit," he rep­li­ed with fe­eling. "I can't ima­gi­ne how an­yo­ne enj­oys the­se so-cal­led so­ci­al oc­ca­si­ons."</p>
   <p>    "They aren't all as bad as com­bat chal­len­ges se­em to be," Lady Lydi­ell sa­id with a to­uch of sympathy and a shrug. "So­me of the fe­tes can be po­si­ti­vely ple­asant, es­pe­ci­al­ly the fe­tes for un­wed da­ugh­ters. The pre­sen­ce of wo­men se­ems to ma­ke the yo­ung tygers she­ath the­ir claws and hi­de the­ir te­eth, at le­ast long eno­ugh to lo­ok ci­vi­li­zed whi­le in the com­pany of the la­di­es."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian had de­ba­ted whet­her or not to tell his mot­her everyt­hing, and de­ci­ded now that on the who­le she was bet­ter off not kno­wing abo­ut how he had in­ter­rup­ted the chal­len­ge-com­bat, sin­ce only go­od had co­me out of his ne­ar-blun­der in the end. "Well, I know you don't ca­re who won the dis­pu­te-but Gel and I ma­na­ged to pull off a lit­tle tri­umph that I think you two will ap­pro­ve of."</p>
   <p>    Tenebrinth blin­ked, and his mot­her ra­ised an eyeb­row. "Oh?" she sa­id. "Now what ha­ve you two got­ten in­to?"</p>
   <p>    "Well, the­re's go­od news and the­re's in­con­ve­ni­ent news," he rep­li­ed, "The in­con­ve­ni­ent news is that Lyon Lord Kyndreth wants to vi­sit for long eno­ugh to le­arn my tra­ining and com­bat met­hods. The go­od news is that the re­ason he do­es is that we per­su­aded the two fe­uding lords to ha­ve the­ir dif­fe­ren­ces set­tled in a com­bat my way, bet­we­en Gel and Lord Lyon's man. Lyon was imp­res­sed, and not only wants to know how the spells are set, but sa­id in the pre­sen­ce of the ot­her lords that he in­tends to ma­ke this the way in which figh­ters are tra­ined and dis­pu­tes set­tled from now on. Af­ter se­e­ing blo­od­less com­bat, he says that he ag­re­es with me; the old ways are too was­te­ful to con­ti­nue."</p>
   <p>    With every word, Lydi­ell and Te­neb­rinth grew mo­re and mo­re as­to­nis­hed, eyes wi­de­ning and mo­uths drop­ping slightly open. It was Te­neb­rinth who co­uld not rest­ra­in him­self as Kyrti­an le­aned back in his cha­ir, a sa­tis­fi­ed smi­le on his fa­ce.</p>
   <p>    "By the An­ces­tors, boy, that isn't go­od news, it's won­der­ful news! Do you re­ali­ze what this me­ans to the hu­mans out the­re?" Te­neb­rinth wa­ved his arm at the world out­si­de the win­dows.</p>
   <p>    "Well-mostly," Lady Lydi­ell in­te­rj­ec­ted gently. "The­re are go­ing to be tho­se of our ra­ce who­se thirst for blo­od and cru­elty will not be sa­tis­fi­ed with blo­od­less com­bat and who will con­ti­nue to was­te the li­ves of gla­di­ators. Not even Lyon co­uld get a law thro­ugh the Co­un­cil for­bid­ding them to kill the­ir own sla­ves. That stri­kes at the he­art and so­ul of what ne­arly every El­ven­lord se­es as his ba­sic rights over cre­atu­res he con­si­ders to be no bet­ter than be­asts and pro­perty." At Kyrti­an's nod of ag­re­ement, she smi­led. "No­net­he­less, Te­neb­rinth is right. Most of the El­ven­lords will be only too ple­ased with the no­ti­on that they can set­tle dif­fe­ren­ces thro­ugh blo­od­less com­bat. It's a gre­at dra­in, bre­eding and bu­ying ex­pen­si­ve figh­ting stock. The furt­her ex­pen­se of tra­ining gla­di­ators and ke­eping them in tra­ining is bad eno­ugh; it's wor­se to ha­ve the­ir ex­pen­si­ve pro­perty mas­sac­red du­ring tra­ining, and ne­arly as bad when the mas­sac­re hap­pens in set­tling a petty ar­gu­ment, le­aving them to tra­in gla­di­ators all over aga­in if they wish to ma­in­ta­in the­ir po­si­ti­on and sta­tus."</p>
   <p>    Tenebrinth nod­ded. "That's be­en a comp­la­int of the Les­ser Lords aga­inst the Gre­ater for the past two ge­ne­ra­ti­ons-very few ha­ve the re­so­ur­ces to toss away sla­ves wit­ho­ut con­si­de­ring the ex­pen­se! Lord Lyon will ga­in a gre­at de­al of sup­port among the Les­ser Lords for this, if he ma­kes it po­licy-and al­most as im­por­tantly, he won't ag­gra­va­te the Gre­ater. He stands to win all aro­und."</p>
   <p>    Lydiell pat­ted her son's hand. "I'm so ple­ased that I won't even ask what tro­ub­le you tumb­led in­to in or­der to ac­hi­eve this re­mar­kab­le go­al!"</p>
   <p>    "Mother!" Kyrti­an obj­ec­ted, ho­ping he didn't so­und gu­ilty.</p>
   <p>    "But the pri­ce of this is that we are to ex­pect Lord Kyndreth so­me ti­me in the im­me­di­ate fu­tu­re?" the Se­nesc­hal in­te­rj­ec­ted. "Did you ac­tu­al­ly set a da­te for the vi­sit?"</p>
   <p>    "No da­te has be­en set, and I told him that I wo­uld send him a Por­tal-key when I had things re­ady for him. I tri­ed to gi­ve the imp­res­si­on that, as we we­re a small ho­use­hold, rec­lu­si­ve and unu­sed to vi­si­tors, we ne­eded ti­me to pre­pa­re for the vi­sit of so pro­mi­nent a gu­est. He was sa­tis­fi­ed with that so far as I co­uld tell, and I ha­ve no in­ten­ti­on of let­ting him set fo­ot he­re un­til everyone is pre­pa­red. That won't be un­til you two and Gel ha­ve got­ten the ser­vants and fi­eld-hands re­ady to hold up the il­lu­si­on that this is an or­di­nary es­ta­te," Kyrti­an as­su­red him. "He didn't se­em all that im­pa­ti­ent and he wasn't of­fen­ded that I co­uldn't of­fer him our hos­pi­ta­lity im­me­di­ately."</p>
   <p>    "No do­ubt he has bu­si­ness of his own to ta­ke ca­re of be­fo­re he can af­ford a for­mal vi­sit," the Se­nesc­hal mur­mu­red, as if to him­self.</p>
   <p>    "More li­kely he is ta­king the ti­me to see who is and is not our ally, go­ing back to the ti­me we all left Eve­lon," Lydi­ell rep­li­ed tartly. "So­me­one of his rank and sta­tus can't af­ford an ally with an in­con­ve­ni­ent num­ber of de­adly ene­mi­es."</p>
   <p>    "Well, the only enemy we ha­ve that I know of is Ael-mar­kin…" Kyrti­an sa­id, let­ting his vo­ice tra­il off and lo­oking at his mot­her qu­es­ti­oningly.</p>
   <p>    "Correct; Ael­mar­kin is our only open enemy, with the re­mo­te pos­si­bi­lity that his al­li­es might cho­ose to throw in on his si­de," his mot­her con­fir­med. "Tho­ugh on­ce they see that Lyon has thrown in with us, ho­we­ver bri­efly, they are un­li­kely to back Ael­mar­kin aga­inst us in anyt­hing im­por­tant. Thank the An­ces­tors we ne­ver med­dled in po­li­tics on eit­her si­de of the fa­mily! We'll ha­ve a cle­an sla­te, so far as Lord Lyon is con­cer­ned. All we ha­ve to worry abo­ut is ke­eping up ap­pe­aran­ces for a few days at most."</p>
   <p>    "I-don't in­tend to ask anyt­hing of Lord Lyon for this, Mot­her," Kyrti­an sa­id, he­si­tantly. "And I don't in­tend to ma­ke it se­em as if I con­si­der it a gre­at fa­vor on my part to te­ach him my met­hods. I want it to se­em as if I con­si­der this to be-how shall 1 put this?-so­met­hing that I truly be­li­eve sho­uld be of­fe­red, part of my duty to the El­ven­lords as a who­le. I want to gi­ve him the imp­res­si­on of a so­lemn yo­ung man who is de­vo­ted to the wel­fa­re of his pe­op­le. Which I am; just not the pe­op­le that he thinks." He smi­led. "The­re's no po­int in di­sil­lu­si­oning him on that."</p>
   <p>    "Exactly right; any of the or­di­nary sta­tus-grub­bers wo­uld do the op­po­si­te," she con­fir­med. "By ac­ting dif­fe­rently than he ex­pects, you'll catch him off gu­ard and he won't know qu­ite what to think of us. At best, he may de­ci­de that we're worth having as a per­ma­nent ally. The worst he'll as­su­me is that we are so qu­i­etly pro­vin­ci­al, so wrap­ped up in our own ways and li­fe, with such qu­a­int ide­as of lo­yalty and duty, that we are no thre­at or chal­len­ge to an­yo­ne. We'll be sa­fe to pat­ro­ni­ze, and he'll be mo­ti­va­ted to pro­tect us from any mo­re of Ael­mar­kin's ma­ne­uve­rings."</p>
   <p>    "For my part, I wo­uld say that this wo­uld be the best thing he co­uld as­su­me," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, re­li­eved. "Can I ta­ke it that you ap­pro­ve?"</p>
   <p>    "Completely," Lady Lydi­ell sa­id, as Te­neb­rinth nod­ded. Kyrti­an smi­led, a lit­tle thrill of ple­asu­re tick­ling his spi­rit at the no­ti­on that his first fo­ray in­to the dan­ge­ro­us world of Gre­at Lords and po­li­tics had co­me off so suc­ces­sful­ly.</p>
   <p>    Even tho­ugh I al­most tur­ned it in­to a di­sas­ter, he re­min­ded him­self. This is not the ti­me for hub­ris!</p>
   <p>    He to­ok his le­ave of both of them and step­ped in­to the tu­be, which held him in pla­ce un­til the plat­form ro­se to re­ce­ive him. On­ce he had be­en de­po­si­ted on the gro­und flo­or, he he­aded stra­ight for the West To­wer, which held all fi­ve flo­ors of the gre­at lib­rary.</p>
   <p>    He plan­ned to do a lit­tle ge­ne­alo­gi­cal in­ves­ti­ga­ti­on him­self be­fo­re his own plans went any furt­her.</p>
   <p>    In the ho­me of every El­ven­lord, Gre­at or Les­ser, the­re was al­ways a Gre­at Bo­ok of An­ces­tors, kept up to da­te by eit­her the Lady of the clan or a clerk she per­so­nal­ly su­per­vi­sed. Every birth, de­ath, and wed­ding was promptly re­por­ted to the Co­un­cil, which sent out im­me­di­ate no­ti­fi­ca­ti­on to every ho­use­hold, ho­we­ver small and in­sig­ni­fi­cant. No mar­ri­age or al­li­an­ce co­uld be ma­de wit­ho­ut con­sul­ting the Gre­at Bo­ok, which da­ted back to the exi­le from Eve­lon.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian sat at the tab­le hol­ding the Gre­at Bo­ok on its slan­ting stand, and drew it clo­ser to him. As he al­ways did, be­ca­use tho­se First Days fas­ci­na­ted him, Kyrti­an ope­ned the Bo­ok to the first pa­ge whe­re the na­mes of all of tho­se who had da­red the Ga­te out of Eve­lon we­re writ­ten. Fully half of them we­re insc­ri­bed with de­ath-da­tes that ca­me wit­hin days or we­eks of the Cros­sing. So­me had di­ed of the stra­in of the Cros­sing it­self, or of inj­uri­es sus­ta­ined in Eve­lon be­fo­re the Cros­sing.</p>
   <p>    Few in the­se days re­ali­zed that tho­se who had ma­de the Cros­sing had be­en the lo­sers in a war that had split El­ven­kind and set one half war­ring aga­inst the ot­her. The Cros­sing had be­en the des­pe­ra­te at­tempt of the de­fe­ated to es­ca­pe rat­her than sur­ren­der, not the va­li­ant and bold mo­ve of tho­se who we­re in se­arch of a new world to con­qu­er. That was one fact that tho­se who ru­led he­re now pre­fer­red to for­get and bury in the past.</p>
   <p>    Of the sur­vi­vors that re­ma­ined af­ter the Cros­sing, no­ne we­re still ali­ve at the pre­sent day. El­ven­lords li­ved long, pro­vi­ded no ac­ci­dent, il­lness, in­he­ri­ted we­ak­ness, or mur­der dis­po­sed of them be­fo­re the nor­mal span of fo­ur or fi­ve cen­tu­ri­es, but they we­re hardly im­mor­tal. Kyrti­an's pa­ter­nal gre­at-grand­fat­her had be­en one of the lon­gest-li­ved sur­vi­vors, as (he now le­ar­ned) had Lyon Lord Kyndreth's gre­at-grand­si­re; most ot­her El­ven­lords in the­se days we­re yet a furt­her ge­ne­ra­ti­on down the li­ne from the ori­gi­nal in­ha­bi­tants of the new land.</p>
   <p>    He tur­ned the pa­ge to tra­ce his mot­her's li­ne, rat­her than his fat­her's. Odd, he tho­ught, as he no­ted so­met­hing that had ne­ver se­emed im­por­tant be­fo­re. I'm li­te­ral­ly the first ma­le any wo­man of her li­ne has pro­du­ced sin­ce Eve­lon-</p>
   <p>    "That is why the­re was no gre­at obj­ec­ti­on when I wed­ded yo­ur fat­her," sa­id Lydi­ell, be­hind him, as if she had the hu­man gift of re­ading tho­ughts. He was too used to her un­can­ny abi­lity to do this with him to be start­led; he simply tur­ned and smi­led at her as she step­ped for­ward anot­her pa­ce and pla­ced her hand af­fec­ti­ona­tely on his sho­ul­der.</p>
   <p>    "No one-le­ast of all Ael­mar­kin-ever tho­ught I wo­uld pro­du­ce a ma­le he­ir," she sa­id qu­i­etly. "That was why the­re was no obj­ec­ti­on ra­ised to the mar­ri­age, and why Ael­mar­kin is so in­tent on dis­pos­ses­sing you of yo­ur in­he­ri­tan­ce now. He as­su­med that the ri­pe plum of our es­ta­te wo­uld drop in­to his lap wit­ho­ut any ef­fort on his part-or that he co­uld so­me­how con­ni­ve or for­ce me to wed my pre­su­med da­ugh­ter to him." Lydi­ell smi­led down at her son, who­se birth had spo­iled Ael­mar­kin's plans.</p>
   <p>    "But he's re­al­ly a co­usin in na­me only," Kyrti­an obj­ec­ted, tra­cing back Ael­mar­kin's li­ne. "His pe­op­le ha­ven't be­en di­rectly re­la­ted to ours sin­ce Eve­lon it­self! It was our gre­at-grandfathers who we­re co­usins, and the­re's be­en no clo­ser mar­ri­age sin­ce then."</p>
   <p>    "But if you tra­ce ca­re­ful­ly, he's the only ot­her ma­le he­ir to the Clan," Lydi­ell po­in­ted out. "That's as much yo­ur gre­atg­rand­fat­her's and grand­fat­her's fa­ult as anyt­hing el­se. On­ce they had a sing­le, li­ving child, the ne­ed to pro­tect what we had bu­ilt he­re to­ok pre­ce­den­ce over trying to si­re any mo­re child­ren. They each had one ma­le he­ir by one mar­ri­age and no furt­her child­ren; no da­ugh­ters to wed out­si­de the Clan, no se­cond sons to se­cu­re al­li­an­ces. Gran­ted, they we­re ex­cep­ti­onal­ly long-li­ved, and that's what sa­ved us, but I was the first bri­de to co­me from a fa­mily not bo­und in any way to yo­ur Clan, and if yo­ur fat­her was still with us, by now you wo­uld ha­ve at le­ast a yo­un­ger sis­ter or brot­her, be­ca­use I wo­uld ha­ve per­so­nal­ly se­en to it, rat­her than ac­cep­ted the edict that the­re was no ne­ed for furt­her child­ren."</p>
   <p>    Now Kyrti­an no­ted so­met­hing el­se that had so­me­how es­ca­ped his at­ten­ti­on. His age­less mot­her was ne­arer in age to his grand­fat­her than his fat­her! She saw his eyes res­ting on the birth-da­te un­der her na­me, and chuck­led richly.</p>
   <p>    "I won­de­red when you wo­uld un­co­ver that!" she sa­id. "Yes, I'll ad­mit it; I rob­bed the crad­le! When yo­ur grand­mot­her- wi­ser or mo­re prag­ma­tic than her hus­band-knew that she wo­uld not sur­vi­ve yo­ur fat­her's birth, she had eno­ugh ti­me to hand­pick a suc­ces­sor. She tur­ned to our fa­mily, who had be­en her fri­ends; she wan­ted my sis­ter, but the fa­mily had al­re­ady wed her off, so she cho­se me! But she had rec­ko­ned wit­ho­ut yo­ur grand­fat­her's lo­ve and de­vo­ti­on; he re­fu­sed to ta­ke anot­her wi­fe, es­pe­ci­al­ly one as ba­rely-nu­bi­le as I was. Still, for the sa­ke of my fri­ends­hip with her, I vi­si­ted of­ten and long, trying to amu­se yo­ur grand­fat­her and pos­sibly even per­su­ade him in ti­me that I was fas­ci­na­ting and de­si­rab­le! I wish you had se­en me, still ba­rely past my pre­sen­ta­ti­on fe­te, slin­king aro­und he­re as if I was a har­de­ned se­duct­ress!"</p>
   <p>    Since Kyrti­an co­uldn't ima­gi­ne his mot­her slin­king aro­und li­ke a se­duct­ress at any age, he splut­te­red a lit­tle and red­de­ned.</p>
   <p>    "Well, when se­duc­ti­on fa­iled, I tho­ught I wo­uld win him by sho­wing him what a de­vo­ted mot­her I co­uld be to his son," she continued. "The­re was one lit­tle wrink­le in that plan; by the ti­me I tho­ught of it, yo­ur fat­her was hardly of an age to ne­ed mot­he­ring! But I per­sis­ted in cul­ti­va­ting him, only to find that his son and I we­re mu­tu­al­ly fal­ling he­ad over he­els in lo­ve as so­on as he was old eno­ugh to think of such things! Yo­ur grand-si­re was much amu­sed, and so was my sis­ter, Moth."</p>
   <p>    "Moth," of co­ur­se, was V'tern Mort­he­na Lady Ara­da, ne­arly a full cen­tury Lydi­ell's se­ni­or, and the only sur­vi­ving re­lict of Lord Ara­da's tiny Clan. She held a small es­ta­te gran­ted her by her la­te hus­band in her own right, with no in­con­ve­ni­ent co­usins to pes­ter her.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian sig­hed. When he lo­oked at the Gre­at Bo­ok, in the comp­li­ca­ted web of in­ter­mar­ri­ages and se­cond and third mar­ri­ages, his fa­mily sto­od all alo­ne, li­ke a sing­le strand of silk off to one si­de of the gre­ater pat­tern.</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ve not told you this be­fo­re, but Ael­mar­kin tri­ed to for­ce a mar­ri­age on me when yo­ur fat­her first di­sap­pe­ared," she con­ti­nu­ed, as calmly as if it had hap­pe­ned to so­me­one el­se. "That was when Moth ca­me to my res­cue; she dug up an obs­cu­re law pre­ven­ting a man from mar­rying the wi­dow of his co­usin if she al­re­ady had a ma­le he­ir. She vi­si­ted each of the Gre­at Lords her­self and po­in­ted out to each one of them-with examp­les- how that law wo­uld pro­tect the­ir own sons from cer­ta­in of the­ir op­po­nents if anyt­hing hap­pe­ned to the lord him­self. Ne­ed­less to say, they up­held the law to a man, and Ael­mar­kin had to slink away with his ta­il bet­we­en his legs."</p>
   <p>    "No won­der he ha­tes you," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, en­ligh­te­ned.</p>
   <p>    She snif­fed de­li­ca­tely. "Per­so­nal­ly, I pre­fer not to was­te an emo­ti­on as em­po­we­ring as hat­red on that worm. It was ob­vi­o­us from the start what his plans we­re when he ca­me slin­king aro­und he­re, oozing fal­se sympathy and gro­omed and jewel-be­dec­ked to wit­hin an inch of his li­fe. Even if I had be­en the fo­olish wo­man he tho­ught I was, I wo­uld qu­ickly ha­ve se­en that such an al­li­an­ce wo­uld me­an yo­ur de­ath. No mat­ter what my per­so­nal fe­elings we­re on the su­bj­ect, I wo­uld ne­ver ha­ve pla­ced you or our pe­op­le in the hands of the odi­o­us Ael­mar­kin!"</p>
   <p>    "Thank you for that!" Kyrti­an la­ug­hed.</p>
   <p>    "And so­me­ti­me you might thank yo­ur aunt for de­vi­sing the means to pro­tect us both," she rep­li­ed che­er­ful­ly, with a light squ­e­eze of her hand on his sho­ul­der.</p>
   <p>    "Well, ho­we­ver much you play at mo­desty, I think that you wo­uld ha­ve fo­und the so­lu­ti­on just as qu­ickly as Lady Moth if you hadn't had her help," he told her. "You are two out of the sa­me mold, as cle­ver as you are be­a­uti­ful, and far mo­re in­tel­li­gent than any me­re ma­les."</p>
   <p>    "I only ne­eded to be cle­ver eno­ugh to ta­ke ad­van­ta­ge of our iso­la­ti­on," she sa­id, with a la­ugh at his at­tempt to comp­li­ment her. "After all, we are out back of be­yond of now­he­re, and I do­ubt that an­yo­ne ot­her than Ael­mar­kin wo­uld even con­si­der wan­ting our es­ta­te for that re­ason;" Her to­ne tur­ned scorn­ful. "And frankly, I think if Ael­mar­kin knew how much work it is to ke­ep this es­ta­te so pro­fi­tab­le, he'd qu­ickly chan­ge his mind abo­ut wan­ting it."</p>
   <p>    "I only wish that we­re true," Kyrti­an sig­hed. "It's only a lot of work be­ca­use of the way we tre­at our hu­man fri­ends; if this es­ta­te we­re run on the sa­me li­nes as any ot­her, the pro­fits wo­uld pro­bably be much hig­her. At le­ast," he amen­ded, "That's what Te­neb­rinth told me on­ce."</p>
   <p>    "That's be­si­de the po­int," Lydi­ell sa­id re­so­lu­tely. "The po­int now is to ma­ke su­re we get the most out of Lord Lyon's vi­sit, wit­ho­ut ma­king any blun­ders and wit­ho­ut sac­ri­fi­cing any of our in­de­pen­den­ce. You go off and con­sult with Gel over din­ner; I'll do the sa­me with Te­neb­rinth. We're go­ing to want to ple­ase Lyon wit­ho­ut daz­zling him, charm him wit­ho­ut ma­king it lo­ok as if we ha­ve anyt­hing he re­al­ly wants ot­her than yo­ur know­led­ge and ex­per­ti­se. And you and Gel ought to put yo­ur he­ads to­get­her to see if you can think of anyt­hing el­se he might want out of you in par­ti­cu­lar."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian clo­sed the Gre­at Bo­ok with a de­ter­mi­ned snap. "You're per­fectly right, as usu­al," he sa­id. "I'll go chan­ge in­to so­met­hing less os­ten­ta­ti­o­us and find Gel, and we'll get down to bu­si­ness."</p>
   <p>    But in spi­te of the ex­ci­te­ment of the mo­ment, the­re was one thing he had re­ali­zed as he wal­ked off in se­arch of Gel. With all of the con­ver­sa­ti­on abo­ut mar­ri­ages and al­li­an­ces, for the first time sin­ce he'd co­me of age, Lydi­ell had not even men­ti­oned the pros­pect of his own mar­ri­age!</p>
   <p>    And that was eno­ugh of a re­li­ef that his steps be­ca­me no­ti­ce­ably ligh­ter.</p>

   <p>    Over the next se­ve­ral days, he and Gel we­re so busy with pre­pa­ra­ti­ons for Lord Kyndreth's vi­sit that he hardly had ti­me to do anyt­hing ot­her than eat and sle­ep. He cer­ta­inly didn't ha­ve any ti­me for sta­ging even com­bat-prac­ti­ce, so the figh­ters we­re left to fend for them­sel­ves un­til Gel co­uld ta­ke over the­ir prac­ti­ce-ses­si­ons using the old, blun­ted wo­oden we­apons ins­te­ad of the ma­gic ones.</p>
   <p>    He al­re­ady knew that he did not ha­ve to worry abo­ut the figh­ters ta­king ad­van­ta­ge of his inat­ten­ti­on. Thanks to a very re­al sen­se of what Gel wo­uld ha­ve to say-and do-abo­ut it, if they spent the­ir ti­me id­le, they to­ok it upon them­sel­ves to fol­low the usu­al co­ur­se of exer­ci­se and simp­le drill, va­ri­ed with hand-to-hand, unar­med con­tests, in which the worst ac­ci­dent that co­uld be­fall wo­uld be a bro­ken bo­ne or two.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian al­so knew that the figh­ters wo­uld not gi­ve the ga­me away by ac­ting out-of-cha­rac­ter. They we­re mi­li­tary, he­art and so­ul, and wo­uld no mo­re spe­ak out-of-turn or he­si­ta­te to obey an or­der than fly. No, the figh­ters co­uld be co­un­ted upon to play the­ir parts li­ke the pro­fes­si­onals that they we­re.</p>
   <p>    It was the re­gu­lar ser­vants and fi­eld-hands who had to be dril­led in sub­ser­vi­en­ce un­til it be­ca­me se­cond na­tu­re, and many ti­mes Kyrti­an was strongly temp­ted to med­dle with the­ir minds by me­ans of ma­gic to ke­ep them from for­get­ting. It was fi­nal­ly Gel who ca­me up with the ex­cel­lent so­lu­ti­on of ac­tu­al­ly wor­king thro­ugh the elf-sto­nes on the­ir sel­dom-worn col­lars, set­ting up a war­ning ting­le whe­ne­ver the we­arer al­te­red his or her pos­tu­re from that of comp­le­te ser­vi­lity.</p>
   <p>    That wor­ked, and far bet­ter than Kyrti­an had ex­pec­ted. The ser­vi­le po­se, with sho­ul­ders slightly hunc­hed and eyes on the gro­und, for­cibly re­min­ded pe­op­le of how they we­re ex­pec­ted to act. "It won't mat­ter if they lo­ok co­wed and af­ra­id all the ti­me," Gel po­in­ted out. "Lord Kyndreth won't know it's all ac­ting a part, no mat­ter how exag­ge­ra­ted it se­ems to us. A re­al sla­ve just can't be too ser­vi­le; if they gro­vel a lot, he'll only think you're ke­eping the­ir le­as­hes short and using the whip a gre­at de­al. Now-much as I ha­te to bring this up, but what if Kyndreth do­esn't bring along so­me of his own wo­men? He'll ex­pect to be of­fe­red en­ter­ta­in­ment, even if he turns it down."</p>
   <p>    "I don't ha­ve any con­cu­bi­nes to of­fer him," Kyrti­an po­in­ted out. "I sus­pect that's one of the things Ael­mar­kin tri­es to use aga­inst me with the ot­her Lords, that I'm-ah-"</p>
   <p>    "Virginal and chas­te-and pro­bably sex­less, hen­ce no fit he­ir," Gel grow­led bluntly. "Well, you may not ha­ve a ha­rem to of­fer him at the mo­ment, but what are you go­ing to do? Ha­ve you ma­de any plans?"</p>
   <p>    "Mother had an idea," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, but ma­de a fa­ce of dis­tas­te. "I don't li­ke it, mind you, but… she thinks it's just that I'm too fas­ti­di­o­us. She's go­ing to send Te­neb­rinth to the sla­ve mar­kets and buy a pretty con­cu­bi­ne or two just be­fo­re the vi­sit; she'll med­dle with the­ir me­mo­ri­es to ma­ke them think they've be­en he­re for the last co­up­le of ye­ars, ke­ep them iso­la­ted in a tiny ha­rem of the­ir own and ha­ve me of­fer them to Lord Kyndreth."</p>
   <p>    "You're too fas­ti­di­o­us," Gel told him bluntly. "It's per­fect. They won't know anyt­hing abo­ut us, and they won't be re­la­ted to an­yo­ne he­re. If the­re's an… ac­ci­dent… we won't be lo­sing any of our pe­op­le."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian's dis­tas­te grew, but he co­uldn't deny that Gel's prag­ma­tic vi­ew was at le­ast prac­ti­cal. "And what do we do with them af­ter­wards?" he as­ked so­urly.</p>
   <p>    Gel shrug­ged. "Hardly mat­ters. Con­cu­bi­nes aren't the brigh­test as a who­le, and I sus­pect any that yo­ur mot­her picks will be very pretty and very dim-much sa­fer that way. We could pro­bably marry them off to so­me­one, if you've got no tas­te for ha­ving them aro­und. Or sell them aga­in," He ra­ised an eyeb­row at Kyrti­an's exp­res­si­on, and snor­ted. "Do yo­ur­self a fa­vor; let yo­ur mot­her and Te­neb­rinth de­al with it. Ke­ep yo­ur hands cle­an if you dis­li­ke it that much."</p>
   <p>    As if my not kno­wing ma­kes it any bet­ter, he tho­ught grimly. No, that's no ans­wer. "I'll tell Mot­her you ag­ree with her idea, and even tho­ugh I don't li­ke the idea, I ag­ree it's ne­ces­sary, the­re re­al­ly do­esn't se­em to be a bet­ter so­lu­ti­on."</p>
   <p>    "There isn't," Gel sa­id, with emp­ha­sis. "What el­se do you want to do, ask for vo­lun­te­ers?"</p>
   <p>    That was de­fi­ni­tely no ans­wer. He sho­ok his he­ad. "I'll do the me­mory ma­ni­pu­la­ti­on-mot­her isn't go­ing to be ab­le to im­part many con­vin­cing il­lu­si­ons abo­ut-um-I me­an, it's not as if she's a ma­le-" He flus­hed, and didn't comp­le­te the sen­ten­ce, but got the dis­tinct fe­eling that Gel fo­und his em­bar­ras­sment highly amu­sing. "We'll do what we ha­ve to, all of us, and try to ma­ke things up af­ter­wards if the­re's an­yo­ne hurt by this." He just ho­ped that Lord Kyndreth wasn't one of tho­se who left wo­men da­ma­ged. "I can al­ways ma­ke the girls for­get everyt­hing when he's go­ne," he ad­ded, as much for his own be­ne­fit as for Gel's.</p>
   <p>    Gel lo­oked re­li­eved. "You'll ne­ver be a re­al com­man­der if you can't ma­ke the dif­fi­cult de­ci­si­ons and carry them out," he re­min­ded his erstw­hi­le su­pe­ri­or-per­haps just a to­uch smugly.</p>
   <p>    "I just did, didn't I?" he rep­li­ed, ir­ri­ta­ted. "Eno­ugh; we're spen­ding mo­re ti­me on this than the is­sue war­rants, and it has not­hing to do with yo­ur part in this, which is get­ting the figh­ters re­ady. Well?"</p>
   <p>    Gel grin­ned. "Oh, they're re­ady. Very eager to show the­ir pa­ces, and just as eager to see you vin­di­ca­ted. Ha­ve no fe­ar, they know the­ir parts. We'll gi­ve Lord Kyndreth a show he isn't li­kely to for­get for the next three cen­tu­ri­es."</p>
   <p>    Triana con­si­de­red the sla­ve dis­pas­si­ona­tely-a ra­re sta­te of mind for her. The­re we­re se­ve­ral con­si­de­ra­ti­ons he­re, not the le­ast of which was this; how far co­uld one trust a hu­man? As she had told Ael­mar­kin, she sel­dom tra­ined fe­ma­le slaves. Ne­ver was not the ope­ra­ti­ve word; ne­ver was not a word to be used at all among the El­ven­lords, who­se long li­ves had no ro­om in them for ne­ver. So­oner or la­ter, wha­te­ver it was that had be­en vo­wed aga­inst wo­uld hap­pen. Mind, the­re we­re El­ven­lords so ri­gid in the­ir thin­king that they ac­tu­al­ly be­li­eved that they co­uld say they wo­uld "ne­ver" do so­met­hing-but Tri-ana knew bet­ter.</p>
   <p>    This wo­man was not of her bre­eding; the fe­ma­le sla­ves that Tri­ana bred on her own es­ta­te we­re strictly uti­li­ta­ri­an, and whi­le not pla­in (she co­uldn't be­ar to ha­ve anyt­hing pla­in or ugly abo­ut her) we­re abo­ut as ani­ma­ted as sta­tu­es in the pre­sen­ce of the­ir mist­ress. This girl, bo­ught, not at auc­ti­on, but hand­pic­ked from among the of­fe­rings of a pri­va­te sa­le, was the op­po­si­te of sto­ic and una­ni­ma­ted. She was tra­ined as a dan­cer as well as in ha­rem skills; she was very in­tel­li­gent. Tri­ana ne­eded a wo­man who was in­tel­li­gent, but with in­tel­li­gen­ce ca­me the li­abi­lity of thin­king for one's self.</p>
   <p>    How far to trust her? That was the qu­es­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "Would it surp­ri­se you very much to le­arn that I ne­ed a spy?" she as­ked alo­ud.</p>
   <p>    The sla­ve sho­ok her he­ad slightly, eno­ugh to in­di­ca­te that she was not surp­ri­sed, but not so much that the mu­te reply co­uld be con­si­de­red im­per­ti­nent.</p>
   <p>    "The mot­her of a cer­ta­in yo­ung lord is purc­ha­sing ha­rem sla­ves, and I in­tend that you sho­uld num­ber among them," Tri­ana con­ti­nu­ed. "I ne­ed to know what go­es on in his ho­use­hold, and ha­rem sla­ves are in a uni­que po­si­ti­on to find that out."</p>
   <p>    "But ha­rem sla­ves are kept in iso­la­ti­on-" the girl res­pon­ded ten­ta­ti­vely.</p>
   <p>    Triana smi­led. "But men do not he­ed the­ir ton­gu­es when among them," she cor­rec­ted. "I co­uld ha­ve me­rely plan­ted a te­le­son-ring on you and sent you on as a pas­si­ve lis­te­ner-but I wo­uld not le­arn a tenth as much as I will when you work for me in full know­led­ge of what I want." She con­si­de­red the girl furt­her. "It is yo­ur duty to gi­ve me that, but yo­ur pre­vi­o­us mas­ter in­di­ca­ted that you are bot­her­so­mely in­tel­li­gent-"</p>
   <p>    Here the girl flus­hed and lo­oked down at her fe­et.</p>
   <p>    "-and as a con­se­qu­en­ce, I am awa­re that me­re duty is not going to ext­ract what I want from the pla­ce to which I am go­ing to send you." Tri­ana chuck­led, and the girl lo­oked up aga­in in surp­ri­se. "Oh, co­me now-I am not one of tho­se lords who pre­fers sla­ves to ha­ve no tho­ughts of the­ir own! You lit­tle mayfly hu­mans may not ha­ve the ca­pa­city to ap­pre­ci­ate what yo­ur mas­ters can, but you are still as mo­ti­va­ted by the pros­pect of ga­in as we are. I know full well that on­ce plan­ted in this ho­use­hold, yo­ur le­ash will be slip­ped and you can and will do as you ple­ase in this mat­ter." She le­aned for­ward, catc­hing and hol­ding the girl's ga­ze with her own. "I ha­ve an in­cen­ti­ve to of­fer you, so that you will work that de­ar lit­tle mind of yo­urs to the ful­lest on my be­half."</p>
   <p>    A flic­ker of emo­ti­on pas­sed ac­ross the girl's fa­ce, and she flus­hed aga­in. "Incen­ti­ve, Mist­ress?" she ven­tu­red bre­at­hily.</p>
   <p>    Satisfied that she had fo­und the cor­rect key to the lock of the girl's am­bi­ti­on, Tri­ana le­aned back. "A re­ward, if that word ple­ases you bet­ter; a re­ward for exemp­lary ser­vi­ce. Exert yo­ur­self to the ut­most on my be­half, find a way to con­vin­ce Kyrti­an to le­ave the ha­rem do­or un­bar­red to yo­ur co­mings and go­ings, and abo­ve all, re­port everyt­hing you see and he­ar, ho­we­ver small and se­emingly in­con­se­qu­en­ti­al, to me. Do that, sa­tisfy me, and at the end of a ye­ar in his ser­vi­ce I will ha­ve you ret­ri­eved. You can re­ti­re he­re, and na­me what you will for yo­ur con­di­ti­ons of li­ving, ne­ver aga­in be­ing re­qu­ired to do anyt­hing you do not ca­re for. From a cot­ta­ge and ma­te of yo­ur cho­ice to the su­ite and ser­vi­ce of a yo­ung Lady. Or-if this is mo­re to yo­ur li­king-you may go to yo­ur wild breth­ren among the Wi­zards. I can ar­ran­ge for that as well."</p>
   <p>    From the slight qu­ic­ke­ning of the girl's bre­ath, Tri­ana knew she had ca­ught her. Mi­ne, she tho­ught, with sa­tis­fac­ti­on, and nod­ded to set the ho­ok, now that the ba­it had be­en ta­ken. "This will not be easy," she war­ned. "You will ha­ve to bend yo­ur who­le mind to the task, and you will ha­ve to ke­ep Lord Kyrti­an and his mot­her from ever gu­es­sing that you are not what you se­em. If you do not sa­tisfy me-" she shrug­ged "-I will not be ab­le to pu­nish you, ob­vi­o­usly, but I can and will le­ave you in pla­ce, and you will li­ve and die the con­cu­bi­ne of a mi­nor lord in a tiny ha­rem with un­var­ying ro­uti­ne. Kyrti­an do­es not of­ten have gu­ests, so you wo­uld not even ha­ve that pros­pect to brigh­ten yo­ur days. I be­li­eve that so­me­one li­ke you wo­uld find that sort of li­fe mad­de­ningly rest­ric­ti­ve."</p>
   <p>    The sla­ve did not he­si­ta­te even for the smal­lest part of a mo­ment. "I will ser­ve you, Lady," the girl rep­li­ed de­ci­si­vely. "You will find not­hing lac­king in my ze­al."</p>
   <p>    Triana la­ug­hed alo­ud, with a glan­ce at the girl to in­vi­te her to jo­in in her go­od hu­mor. Ah, Ael­mar­kin, she tho­ught, as she set­tled down to inst­ruct the girl in the use of the te­le­son-ring and her ini­ti­al du­ti­es. This wa­ger is al­re­ady won!</p>
   <p>    Gel knew his bu­si­ness, no­ne bet­ter. Kyrti­an left the mat­ter of the ho­use­hold to his mot­her, and to­ok char­ge of the rest. Now that the war­nings we­re in pla­ce and the at­ti­tu­de of the fi­eld-hands and far­mers had be­en es­tab­lis­hed, he jud­ged that it was ti­me to pre­pa­re the ge­ne­ral out­ward ap­pe­aran­ce of his pe­op­le. They must lo­ok self-suf­fi­ci­ent and pros­pe­ro­us, but not too pros­pe­ro­us. The ser­vants must not lo­ok too he­althy, too happy. In fact, the ones in the fi­elds must not lo­ok happy at all.</p>
   <p>    He spent a day con­si­de­ring how to ac­comp­lish that, re­se­arc­hing spells of il­lu­si­on, won­de­ring what he wo­uld do if Lord Kyndreth de­tec­ted them or bro­ke them. Kyndreth had not got­ten whe­re he was by be­ing a fo­ol, and if he de­tec­ted il­lu­si­ons, he wo­uld want to know what they hid-he wo­uld first sus­pect tre­ac­hery, but he wo­uld de­fi­ni­tely want to know why the­re we­re il­lu­si­ons on hu­man sla­ves.</p>
   <p>    Finally, in the twi­light, he de­ci­ded to ta­ke a walk to see if the fresh air wo­uld cle­ar his he­ad out and let so­me fresh tho­ughts in.</p>
   <p>    The stars we­re just co­ming out, and a fi­ne bre­eze car­ri­ed the scents of the gar­dens on its wings. He to­ok a mo­ment to ex­tin­gu­ish the glo­wing glo­bes il­lu­mi­na­ting the path­ways, for he knew the gar­den paths by he­art and had no ne­ed of the lights. At the mo­ment, he wo­uld rat­her enj­oy the dark­ness, not be­ca­use he was bro­oding, but be­ca­use he wan­ted his mind to rest.</p>
   <p>    How did Ael­mar­kin's ser­vants lo­ok? That wo­uld be the sort of thing to get his own pe­op­le to emu­la­te. Des­pi­te the­ir ser­vi­le stan­ces, the­re was still so­met­hing wrong abo­ut them that he co­uld not put a fin­ger on. He to­ok slow, de­li­be­ra­te steps and cast his mind back a few days, trying not to frown in con­cent­ra­ti­on. It wasn't an exact me­mory he wan­ted, af­ter all, but an imp­res­si­on. How did the or­di­nary ser­vants, the ones who cle­aned the ro­oms and bro­ught the fo­od from the kitc­hen, se­em to an ob­ser­ver?</p>
   <p>    It was easy eno­ugh to re­mem­ber the pretty ones, the up­per-le­vel sla­ves, who­se du­ti­es inc­lu­ded be­ing de­co­ra­ti­ve. Tho­se we­ren't the ones he wan­ted, at le­ast in part be­ca­use he wasn't cer­ta­in any of his pe­op­le co­uld ma­na­ge a con­vin­cing imi­ta­ti­on of a ple­asu­re-sla­ve, and in part be­ca­use it wo­uldn't do any harm for Lord Kyndreth to be­li­eve that his ho­use­hold was on the aus­te­re and so­ber si­de. Let Kyndreth think of him as hard-wor­king, so­mew­hat ob­ses­sed with his hobby, and not re­al­ly in­te­res­ted in the opu­lent li­fe. That wo­uld do no harm at all.</p>
   <p>    It will al­so re­in­for­ce the imp­res­si­on that we aren't worth the at­tempt to ta­ke us over. Pro­fit can only be stretc­hed so far; we might be aus­te­re be­ca­use we can't af­ford too many lu­xu­ri­es.</p>
   <p>    Try as he might, all he co­uld co­me up with was a va­gue imp­res­si­on of sa­me­ness, as if the les­ser ser­vants we­re all as ali­ke as ants, and as in­terc­han­ge­ab­le. They co­uld ha­ve be­en fur­ni­tu­re, flo­or-ti­les, the plinths upon which sta­tu­es sto­od, they blen­ded so well in­to the backg­ro­und.</p>
   <p>    With a flash of in­sight, he re­ali­zed at that mo­ment that this was what he wan­ted!</p>
   <p>    They must ha­ve all be­en in so­me drably uni­form tu­nics, or the li­ke, he de­ci­ded. They aren't sup­po­sed to stand out-they sho­uld be in­vi­sib­le. Drab tu­nics wo­uld do that. No mat­ter that he didn't know what such a tu­nic or what-not sho­uld lo­ok li­ke-any of the se­amst­res­ses co­uld de­al with that de­ta­il. He'd ta­ke the ne­ed to them first thing in the mor­ning, and let them de­ci­de how to ma­ke ever­yo­ne on the ma­nor lands uni­formly drab.</p>
   <p>    As for ma­king pe­op­le lo­ok un­hap­py… he grin­ned as anot­her idea ca­me to him. I'll ha­ve the fi­eld-wor­kers stick a burr or a pin so­mew­he­re in the­ir clot­hing whe­re it'll ir­ri­ta­te them wit­ho­ut re­al­ly hur­ting them-or put sto­nes in the­ir sho­es, or we­ar sho­es too tight or too big. That'll gi­ve them all so­ur exp­res­si­ons, sho­uld any of Kyndreth's pe­op­le co­me sno­oping abo­ut.</p>
   <p>    He yaw­ned, and re­ali­zed that he'd be­en up far too long-but they we­re all go­ing short on sle­ep, trying to get them­sel­ves re­ady. Bed, he de­ci­ded. And first thing in the mor­ning, the ma­nor se­amst­res­ses.</p>
   <p>    Even tho­ugh he wo­ke very, very early-just at the bre­ak of dawn, in fact-when he sho­wed up unan­no­un­ced at the se­amst­ress's work­ro­oms, they we­re al­re­ady well in­to the day's la­bors. That surp­ri­sed him; he'd al­ways known, in a va­gue way, that his pe­op­le be­gan the­ir work early, long be­fo­re he awo­ke, but he hadn't ever gi­ven much tho­ught to what that me­ant.</p>
   <p>    Here was a lar­ge, well-lit ro­om, fur­nis­hed with com­for­tab­le cha­irs in which se­ve­ral wo­men we­re se­ated, se­wing di­li­gently. The­re was a lar­ge tab­le co­ve­red with a pi­ece of fab­ric at the far si­de of the ro­om, and a wo­man with a wic­kedly-bla­ded pa­ir of scis­sors ma­de deft cuts in it, fol­ding and la­ying asi­de the pi­eces she had ma­de as she went along. Bolts of fab­ric we­re ar­ra­yed in a rack along one wall, rib­bons and ot­her trim we­re wo­und aro­und wo­oden co­nes on pegs, and spo­ols of thre­ad we­re ar­ran­ged in lit­tle racks be­si­de them. He put his ne­ed to the chi­ef of the la­di­es, a for­mi­dab­le da­me with sil­ver-stre­aked ha­ir, exp­la­ining the ef­fect he wan­ted, and why. She pur­sed her lips and frow­ned.</p>
   <p>    "My lord-do you re­ali­ze what you are as­king when you re­qu­est com­mon uni­form tu­nics for the en­ti­re es­ta­te? Aye, we've eno­ugh se­ed-sack ma­te­ri­al abo­ut, but no ti­me-even a simp­le ta­bard with no hems wo­uld ne­ed si­de and sho­ul­der se­ams, and it'd be so cru­de it wo­uld lo­ok ma­kes­hift-"</p>
   <p>    "Dye," in­ter­rup­ted one of the wo­men en­ga­ged in so­me myste­ri­o­us task that se­emed to in­vol­ve the ed­ges of a gre­at de­al of fab­ric that po­oled on eit­her si­de of her. "Don't bot­her with ma­king anyt­hing new, just fi­re up dye-pots and ha­ve ever­yo­ne co­me in and dunk an old tu­nic and trews, so you get the lo­ok of we­ar as well as ha­ving it lo­ok uni­form."</p>
   <p>    "Oh, well-tho­ught!" the ol­der wo­man exc­la­imed, her brow cle­aring. "That might be a prob­lem, mightn't it-if it lo­oked as if ever­yo­ne in the pla­ce had new clot­hes!"</p>
   <p>    "For co­lor-black'd be best, wal­nut-black the che­apest, and we've got plenty of that; so­on or la­te, every­body ne­eds so­me bit of black, and that way I do­ubt the­re'll be much comp­la­ining abo­ut spo­iling so­met­hing go­od." The wo­man was very ple­ased with her in­ge­nu­ity, and so we­re Kyrti­an and her su­per­vi­sor.</p>
   <p>    "Aye, that's the way! Then­kee, Margyt!" The he­ad se­amst­ress be­amed and pat­ted Kyrti­an on the sho­ul­der as if he was a small boy. "Don't worry yo­ur he­ad abo­ut it, my yo­ung Lord, we'll hand­le this for you; when the day co­mes, every­body'U be ma­king a ni­ce dep­res­sing backg­ro­und." She ac­tu­al­ly pus­hed him-gently, but pus­hed him, ne­vert­he­less-out the do­or. He didn't re­sist; in fact, he was rat­her amu­sed at the si­tu­ati­on. He'd had no idea how things we­re run on the do­mes­tic si­de, but cle­arly this wo­man was as much a "com­man­der" in her own ranks as Gel was in his!</p>
   <p>    And he had no do­ubt that she wo­uld get the job do­ne, eit­her. She had the air abo­ut her that sa­id she wo­uld ri­de right over the top of an­yo­ne and anyt­hing to comp­le­te wha­te­ver she'd pro­mi­sed.</p>
   <p>    He went back to his own pre­pa­ra­ti­ons, cal­ling in each of the su­per­vi­sors of work-par­ti­es and exp­la­ining to them what he wan­ted do­ne-the burrs and all-and why. He'd dis­co­ve­red a very long ti­me ago that if pe­op­le knew why they we­re be­ing as­ked to do so­met­hing that se­emed sen­se­less, they we­re much mo­re li­kely to comply.</p>
   <p>    "Now, I don't want an­yo­ne to start get­ting too cre­ati­ve," he war­ned. "Don't let an­yo­ne go ma­im him­self, or try to co­un­ter­fe­it pla­gue or so­met­hing, but if pe­op­le get ot­her ide­as abo­ut how to lo­ok less than happy and he­althy, let them go to it. Par­ti­cu­larly I'm a bit wor­ri­ed abo­ut the lit­tle child­ren gi­ving things away-the ol­der ones will be all right if you put it to them as be­ing im­por­tant, but the lit­tlest are used to run­ning right up to any stran­ger and sa­ying what they think."</p>
   <p>    "There're se­ve­ral of the pa­rents fi­gu­ring on that now, my lord," one of the su­per­vi­sors as­su­red him. "If not­hing el­se, every­body's ag­re­ed that we can hi­de the lit­tlest off so­mew­he­re no­body'll see them, all in a gro­up. Per­haps we co­uld ta­ke them out in­to the wo­ods, and let them ha­ve a cam­ping-excur­si­on. Le­ave it to us, we'll ta­ke ca­re of it. Tell them it's a ho­li­day tre­at, and they'll be go­od as lambs."</p>
   <p>    So many de­ta­ils-as so­on as Kyrti­an tho­ught he'd de­alt suc­ces­sful­ly with the last, anot­her oc­cur­red to him. It wasn't un­til days la­ter that his mot­her ap­pro­ac­hed him as he was ar­ran­ging with one of the bu­il­ding crews to ma­ke "alte­ra­ti­ons" to the wor­kers' qu­ar­ters. It had oc­cur­red to him by then that it was unu­su­al eno­ugh for his pe­op­le to ha­ve the­ir own lit­tle ho­mes and vil­la­ges ins­te­ad of be­ing her­ded in­to vast wa­re­ho­uses when they we­ren't wor­king-and he'd bet­ter ha­ve the­ir qu­ar­ters lo­ok shabby and ill-ma­de!</p>
   <p>    Lady Lydi­ell wa­ited pa­ti­ently as he and the bu­il­ders qu­ickly wor­ked out what was ne­eded; it was pretty cle­ar that she wan­ted to spe­ak with him alo­ne, so he dis­mis­sed them as so­on as he co­uld, and clo­sed the do­or of his own new of­fi­ce be­hind them.</p>
   <p>    She sat with a rust­le of silk and a swirl of scar­let skirts. "You told me to co­me to you when I had yo­ur ha­rem, and I ha­ve," she sa­id simply, and the words hit him li­ke a splash of cold wa­ter in his fa­ce. "They're re­ady for you to pre­pa­re them."</p>
   <p>    He didn't al­low the shock to fre­eze his tho­ughts, tho­ugh. "I don't ha­ve anyt­hing on my pla­te at the mo­ment, so I had best see to them, then," he told her, and was ple­ased to see a bit of surp­ri­se in her eyes that he was wil­ling to de­al with the unp­le­asant duty so qu­ickly. She knew that he ha­ted med­dling with hu­mans' minds thro­ugh the­ir col­lars, es­pe­ci­al­ly for a pur­po­se li­ke this-</p>
   <p>    But on the who­le, he'd rat­her just get it over with so that he wo­uldn't ha­ve to dwell on it.</p>
   <p>    "That's fi­ne," she rep­li­ed qu­ickly, get­ting to her fe­et with that gra­ce he ad­mi­red so much and was so much a part of her. "Co­me along; I've con­ver­ted yo­ur old nur­sery to a ha­rem; it was the most se­cu­re su­ite in the ma­nor and the only one not in use."</p>
   <p>    "It had to be the most se­cu­re, didn't it?" he chuck­led, ope­ning the do­or for her. "Not only did you ha­ve to worry abo­ut so­met­hing get­ting in at me, you had to worry abo­ut me get­ting out!"</p>
   <p>    "And a misc­hi­evo­us es­ca­pe-artist you we­re, too," she re­tor­ted. "Well, I can tell you that I am very pro­ud of Te­neb­rinth, and you will be, too, when you see the­se wo­men. With all of the up­he­avals, the sla­ve-tra­de has be­en very much dis­rup­ted-"</p>
   <p>    "Which I will not shed te­ars over," he res­pon­ded, with a hint of a frown.</p>
   <p>    "Nevertheless, it has ma­de his task har­der." The lo­ok she ga­ve back to him was one of rep­ro­ach. "Many of the sla­ve-mar­kets ha­ve be­en clo­sed down, and ot­hers ha­ve only the most me­ager of se­lec­ti­on. On the ot­her hand, if it hadn't be­en so dis­rup­ted, I do­ubt we wo­uld ha­ve fo­und three wo­men so per­fectly su­ited to our pur­po­ses. I do­ubt that even the gre­at Lord Kyn-dreth will won­der why yo­ur ha­rem is so small, on­ce he se­es the­se girls."</p>
   <p>    "Oh?" Now his cu­ri­osity was pi­qu­ed.</p>
   <p>    She nod­ded, her ha­ir fal­ling in a gra­ce­ful cur­ve ac­ross her brow as she did so. She pus­hed it back with an im­pa­ti­ent hand. "Firstly, I very much do­ubt that an­yo­ne ot­her than the­ir tra­iner and for­mer ow­ner ha­ve ever se­en them, which ma­kes it much easi­er to carry off the fic­ti­on that you wo­uld ha­ve ow­ned them yo­ur­self for se­ve­ral ye­ars. Se­condly, if the tra­de we­re not so dis­rup­ted, I do­ubt if we wo­uld ha­ve be­en ab­le to get them at all; they'd ha­ve be­en snap­ped up be­fo­re they re­ac­hed the gre­ater mar­kets."</p>
   <p>    Now he was surp­ri­sed. "Are they that at­trac­ti­ve, then?" he as­ked, his cu­ri­osity mo­re than pi­qu­ed.</p>
   <p>    "They are not pre­ci­sely gre­at be­a­uti­es, alt­ho­ugh they are qu­ite hand­so­me-well, ma­ke that judg­ment for yo­ur­self." By this ti­me they had re­ac­hed the do­or-and now gu­ar­ded-of his for­mer nur­sery. The gu­ards step­ped asi­de, fa­ces as exp­res­si­on­less as sta­tu­es, and Lady Lydi­ell ope­ned the do­or, ges­tu­ring to him to go in ahe­ad.</p>
   <p>    He did so, fe­eling the fa­int ting­le of a se­cond "do­or" as he cros­sed the thres­hold that wo­uld pre­vent the wo­men from cros­sing it un­til it was ta­ken down. That was usu­al eno­ugh in ha­rems to ke­ep them out of the Lady's Bo­wer; it was ne­ces­sary he­re, to ke­ep them from wan­de­ring and se­e­ing things they sho­uldn't.</p>
   <p>    The three wo­men had cle­arly be­en told to awa­it him, for they we­re stan­ding in po­ses that we­re a lit­tle too cont­ri­ved to be na­tu­ral. That was when he un­ders­to­od what his mot­her had me­ant.</p>
   <p>    There co­uld not pos­sibly ha­ve be­en three wo­men mo­re stri­kingly dif­fe­rent. The first, tall, with pa­le gold ha­ir and vi­vid blue eyes, had an an­gu­lar fa­ce and a fi­gu­re as slen­der and wil­lowy as any El­ven lady, and a far-away exp­res­si­on as if she li­ved en­ti­rely in a clo­ud of dre­ams. She had po­sed her­self be­si­de a gi­ant va­se of flo­wers, mu­sing on a sing­le enor­mo­us lily-blos­som, her fril­led and lacy gown ec­ho­ing the pas­tel co­lors of the blo­oms. The se­cond, a bru­net­te with brown eyes full of pas­si­on, full lips, and a sen­su­o­us body, fa­irly ra­di­ated pro­mi­ses; she lo­un­ged aga­inst a pil­lar in a way that thrust her bo­som for­ward-stra­ining the silk of her scar­let, form-fit­ting wrap-and al­lo­wed her to watch him with a pro­vo­ca­ti­ve, flir­ta­ti­o­us, si­de­ways glan­ce. The third had a tumb­le of fla­ming curls and merry gre­en eyes, a dan­cer's body of strength and agi­lity clot­hed in a simp­le blue tu­nic that left her legs ba­re, and the exp­res­si­on of a comp­le­tely in­no­cent child; she lo­oked up from the kit­ten she was pla­ying with to smi­le at him with a fa­ce full of la­ugh­ter. It se­emed that in the­se three, all the va­ri­ety of an en­ti­re ha­rem was en­com­pas­sed. And only a sta­tue co­uld ha­ve fa­iled to res­pond to the si­lent in­vi­ta­ti­ons each of them sent to him in her own way.</p>
   <p>    "You see?" Lady Lydi­ell sa­id qu­i­etly, as the three sank to the gro­und in de­ep curt­si­es. He glan­ced at her, and saw that she had a glint of misc­hi­ef in her own eyes. "Well, de­arest, is it sa­fe to le­ave you alo­ne with them?"</p>
   <p>    He co­uldn't help it; he flus­hed-but he co­ve­red it with a half-moc­king bow. "You're go­ing to ha­ve to if I'm to gi­ve them con­vin­cing me­mo­ri­es," he told her, ca­using her to blush. It was with a bit of sa­tis­fac­ti­on that he bo­wed her out, and tur­ned to fa­ce his new "acqu­isi­ti­ons."</p>
   <p>    He was trying to think of so­met­hing to say when they des­cen­ded on him as a body and ma­de spe­ech ir­re­le­vant, at le­ast for that mo­ment, and the many that fol­lo­wed.</p>
   <p>    Sergeant Gel fol­lo­wed Lord Te­neb­rinth in­to the Old To­wer, his mo­od not pre­ci­sely ap­pre­hen­si­ve, but tin­ged with that emo­ti­on. Lady Lydi­ell ra­rely spo­ke to him fa­ce-to-fa­ce, and this was the first ti­me that she had ever re­qu­ired him to at­tend her in her pri­va­te of­fi­ce.</p>
   <p>    He had ne­ver be­en in­si­de the Old To­wer; few hu­mans had, only the one or two re­qu­ired to cle­an Lydi­ell's, and Te­ne-brinth's, of­fi­ces. One of the lords, or the lady her­self, wo­uld ha­ve to ha­ve bro­ught him per­so­nal­ly; the­re was no ot­her way for him to use the only me­ans of ac­cess, which was a bi­zar­re trans­pa­rent tu­be. He co­uldn't ima­gi­ne how he was sup­po­sed to climb it and en­te­red it with Te­neb­rinth rat­her du­bi­o­usly-only to sup­press a start as the flo­or be­ne­ath him be­gan to ri­se. It ga­ve him a qu­e­asy sen­sa­ti­on, des­pi­te his fa­mi­li­arity with ma­gic, to ri­de this cont­rap­ti­on. It just didn't se­em… na­tu­ral. Ro­und, empty ro­om af­ter ro­om pas­sed him-or rat­her, he pas­sed them-as he ro­se with no re­al sen­sa­ti­on of mo­ve­ment.</p>
   <p>    He be­gan to won­der if he wo­uld ever re­ach the top, when fi­nal­ly one of the ro­oms sho­wed signs of oc­cu­pa­ti­on-as did the next af­ter that-and then the plat­form slo­wed and ca­me to a stop at the top­most le­vel.</p>
   <p>    Lydiell's of­fi­ce, at the top of the to­wer, had a diz­zying and un­rest­ric­ted vi­ew that he, as a mi­li­tary com­man­der, co­uld see was of in­cal­cu­lab­le va­lue for the cha­te­la­ine of the ma­nor-or the com­man­der of its de­fen­ses. The of­fi­ce walls we­re all win­dow, and he won­de­red as he step­ped gin­gerly off the plat­form what a storm wo­uld be li­ke up he­re.</p>
   <p>    Lydiell gre­eted him with a smi­le, which ma­de his ap­pre­hen­si­on va­nish. She even ro­se; that was an unex­pec­ted ho­nor, and he bo­wed as de­eply as he co­uld wit­ho­ut lo­oking ri­di­cu­lo­us. The Lady did not li­ke gro­ve­ling; no­ne of her clan did.</p>
   <p>    "Sergeant Gel, ple­ase, ma­ke yo­ur­self easy," she sa­id, as she ges­tu­red with that gra­ce only the El­ven­lords pos­ses­sed to­wards an unoc­cu­pi­ed cha­ir. "This is not an of­fi­ci­al sum­mons-rat­her, it is a per­so­nal one. I ha­ve a de­si­re to con­sult you."</p>
   <p>    Tenebrinth evi­dently to­ok this as the sig­nal to de­part; he step­ped back on the lit­tle plat­form and disc­re­etly drop­ped back to the next le­vel, le­aving them alo­ne.</p>
   <p>    Gel to­ok his se­at and exa­mi­ned the Lady's fa­ce, and swiftly un­ders­to­od why she wan­ted to see him. "Kyrti­an?" he as­ked, was­ting no words.</p>
   <p>    She nod­ded, and to­ok her pla­ce be­hind her desk, clas­ping her hands on the sur­fa­ce be­fo­re her. "I had ho­ped," she sa­id, he­sitantly, as if she was vo­icing tho­ughts long held in sec­ret, "that I co­uld ke­ep Kyrti­an iso­la­ted from the po­li­tics of the Gre­at Lords and the Co­un­cil. Un­for­tu­na­tely, it se­ems that the ti­mes cons­pi­re aga­inst my ho­pes."</p>
   <p>    "It do­es lo­ok li­ke he's go­ing to get tang­led up whet­her he li­kes it or not," Gel sa­id ca­uti­o­usly, his eyes ne­ver le­aving her fa­ce, un­ner­ving as it was to lo­ok her stra­ight in the eyes. "My Lady, I don't mind tel­ling you that I don't li­ke the idea any bet­ter than you do."</p>
   <p>    "I'm not cer­ta­in you re­ali­ze just how tang­led he's li­kely to get," Lydi­ell rep­li­ed, a fa­int frown-li­ne cre­asing her age­less brow. Gel co­uldn't for the li­fe of him re­ad tho­se odd eme­rald eyes the El­ven­lords all had, but at le­ast she wasn't trying to hi­de her fa­ci­al exp­res­si­ons. "Lord Kyndreth is not go­ing to be con­tent me­rely to le­arn a few tricks with ma­gic to help tra­in hu­mans-when he re­ali­zes just how ex­ten­si­ve Kyrti­an's know­led­ge and prac­ti­cal ex­pe­ri­en­ce of mi­li­tary mat­ters is, he is go­ing to want my son to exer­ci­se his ta­lents in the ser­vi­ce of the Old Lords. He will cer­ta­inly want Kyrti­an to com­mand a for­ce aga­inst the Yo­ung Lords, and pos­sibly ke­ep him on af­ter the Yo­ung Lords are crus­hed, to mo­ve aga­inst the Wi­zards and the wild hu­mans."</p>
   <p>    Gel swo­re un­der his bre­ath, angry at him­self for not thin­king of that him­self. And it was far too la­te to try to talk Kyrti­an out of aban­do­ning the full-sca­le ma­ne­uvers he had plan­ned. The boy was de­ter­mi­ned to pro­ve to Lord Kyndreth that this was the only way to tra­in figh­ters, and not­hing wo­uld do but to show him how easy it was to hold the spells ne­eded on en­ti­re ar­mi­es.</p>
   <p>    Lady Lydi­ell sig­hed. "Yo­ur fa­ce tells me that my fe­ars are li­kely to be re­ali­zed. Oh, why co­uldn't he ha­ve be­en an ar­tist or a mu­si­ci­an, or ob­ses­sed with-with-oh, hor­ti­cul­tu­re or so­met­hing equ­al­ly fri­vo­lo­us?"</p>
   <p>    "At le­ast he isn't bent on be­ing the de­ad op­po­si­te of his fat­her, my Lady," Gel rep­li­ed grimly. "You'd not li­ke him as a fop, or a lazy la­ya­bo­ut. Or wor­se, fal­ling in with-"</p>
   <p>    He he­si­ta­ted; af­ter all, he was a hu­man, and Lydi­ell was El-ven. Blo­od was blo­od-</p>
   <p>    But Lydi­ell surp­ri­sed him with a bit­ter smi­le and a light answer. "Fal­ling in with the pam­pe­red per­verts that most of my kind are. You don't ne­ed to spa­re my fe­elings, Gel; we can­not af­ford to be less than ho­nest with each ot­her if we are go­ing to be ab­le to ke­ep Kyrti­an out of the pit­fal­ls lying be­fo­re him."</p>
   <p>    Ah, cowf­lops. Why do I ha­ve to fe­el li­ke it's me that's his fat­her? I'd rest easi­er at night. He might be only a few ac­tu­al ye­ars ol­der than Kyrti­an, but in re­al terms, he might just as well ha­ve be­en the El­ven­lord's fat­her. By the stan­dards of his ra­ce, Kyrti­an was the equ­iva­lent of a strip­ling, alt­ho­ugh by hu­man rec­ko­ning he was in his la­te thir­ti­es. In know­led­ge and ge­ne­ral res­pon­si­bi­lity, he was cer­ta­inly that-but in the un­cons­ci­o­us things that cha­rac­te­ri­zed an ado­les­cent, he was very much Gel's juni­or. His bo­und­less energy, his ent­hu­si­asm, his ten­dency to act rat­her than sit­ting back and wa­iting for events to co­me to him-tho­se we­re the cha­rac­te­ris­tics of the yo­ung, and ma­de Gel fe­el very old.</p>
   <p>    The strength, spe­ed, and en­du­ran­ce of yo­uth we­re al­so his, and might be for the next cen­tury or two, which ma­de Gel fe­el even ol­der. He'd no­ti­ced of la­te, much to his chag­rin, that he was slo­wing down, lo­sing so­me of his ed­ge; in fact, he and that man of Lord Kyndreth's had tal­ked abo­ut that. Ka­eth wasn't get­ting any yo­un­ger eit­her, and if he ever had to ac­tu­al­ly fo­il a fel­low-assas­sin, that co­uld be fa­tal if he didn't ta­ke steps to com­pen­sa­te.</p>
   <p>    We 'II both just ha­ve to be sne­aki­er to ma­ke up for what we 're lo­sing, he re­min­ded him­self. Yo­uth and ent­hu­si­asm are no match for ex­pe­ri­en­ce and tre­ac­hery.</p>
   <p>    "I ha­te to ad­mit this, my lady," he sa­id, fe­eling as­ha­med that he had not an­ti­ci­pa­ted this si­tu­ati­on, "but I've kept him as ig­no­rant as you ha­ve of the way things are-" he wa­ved his hand va­gu­ely at the win­dows "-out the­re. And I did it for pretty much the sa­me re­asons as you, I fi­gu­re. Why throw so­met­hing at him that he co­uldn't chan­ge and wo­uld only worry abo­ut?"</p>
   <p>    Ah, all tho­se old les­sons ca­me back to him now, of be­ing ta­ken off the es­ta­te as Te­neb­rinth's pa­ge, so he co­uld see just how the ot­her El­ven­lords re­al­ly ac­ted and tho­ught. Te­neb­rinth had col­la­red him, of co­ur­se, and if he'd do­ne so­met­hing even slightly stu­pid-which, even as a child he hadn't be­en li­kely to-the El­ven­lord co­uld ha­ve qu­ickly cont­rol­led him. And in a pe­cu­li­ar way, that, too, had be­en part of the les­sons in just how fra­gi­le and pre­ci­o­us the li­fe hu­mans led he­re was.</p>
   <p>    Lydiell nod­ded. "And at this po­int, if we try to tell him that Lord Kyndreth is no mo­re to be trus­ted than Ael­mar­kin, he wo­uld only ma­ke the wrong de­ci­si­ons. He'd try to put Kyndreth off, or-or so­met­hing. And now that he's aro­used Kyndreth's in­te­rest, he can't do that wit­ho­ut aro­using sus­pi­ci­on as well."</p>
   <p>    "Damn all po­li­tics any­way," Gel sa­id so­urly. "Kyndreth is go­ing to use him, ma­ke a to­ol out of him, and gi­ve him not­hing but fi­ne words and empty pra­ise for his tro­ub­les-"</p>
   <p>    "Yes-but-" Lydi­ell be­gan.</p>
   <p>    Gel wa­ited, but she didn't comp­le­te the tho­ught. He spo­ke in­to the he­avy si­len­ce. "But it might not be bad for him; so long as he's va­lu­ab­le to Kyndreth, he's not go­ing to be was­ted. And as long as he's va­lu­ab­le, Kyndreth will see that we're left alo­ne, no mat­ter how pe­cu­li­ar so­me things aro­und he­re may lo­ok to him."</p>
   <p>    Lydiell nod­ded, and Gel felt a cer­ta­in re­li­ef that she ag­re­ed with him. The­re was sel­fish­ness in his mo­ti­va­ti­on, and he knew that; as long as Kyrti­an was not only ali­ve and well but un­der the open pro­tec­ti­on of so­me­one li­ke Lord Kyndreth, Gel and the ot­her hu­mans on the es­ta­te wo­uld be per­fectly sa­fe. Ael­mar­kin wo­uldn't da­re try to in­ter­fe­re or con­ti­nue in his at­tempts to ga­in cont­rol of the ma­nor and lands.</p>
   <p>    As for the hu­mans li­ving el­sew­he­re-hu­mans that Kyrti­an wo­uld be very con­cer­ned abo­ut if he knew how bad things co­uld be on ot­her es­ta­tes-Gel fo­und it dif­fi­cult to worry abo­ut the well-be­ing of pe­op­le he didn't know. The suf­fe­rings of hu­man sla­ves on ot­her es­ta­tes we­re just sto­ri­es to him, and alt­ho­ugh he be­li­eved them in the abst­ract, he just co­uldn't ma­ke him­self ca­re when pe­op­le he knew ne­eded his who­le con­cent­ra­ti­on and con­cern.</p>
   <p>    He co­uldn't re­al­ly be­li­eve in anyt­hing he hadn't se­en with his own eyes, not de­ep down whe­re it co­un­ted.</p>
   <p>    Those are all old sto­ri­es, any­way, and it ma­kes no sen­se the­se days that the El­ven­lords wo­uld wan­tonly was­te or mar the­ir own pos­ses­si­ons. With wild hu­mans on the bor­der, dragons in the sky, the Wi­zards thre­ate­ning to start the war up aga­in and the­ir own child­ren in ar­med re­volt, they can't af­ford the sort of go­ings-on they did in the past. Sla­very-yes, the­re was no do­ubt that the El­ven­lords we­re harsh mas­ters, and kept the­ir hu­mans un­der comp­le­te cont­rol. It was a ter­rib­le thing that hu­mans el­sew­he­re had every ac­ti­on cont­rol­led by so­me­one el­se, that they co­uld ma­ke not even the smal­lest de­ci­si­on abo­ut the­ir own li­ves. But star­va­ti­on, tor­tu­re, abu­se-why? The­re's no re­ason to do any of tho­se things; a star­ved, abu­sed, or inj­ured sla­ve works less, and is worth less, than a he­althy one who is pu­nis­hed only when he de­ser­ves it.</p>
   <p>    "Lady, I pled­ge you, I will not let the boy out of my sight or ca­re, no mat­ter what Lord Kyndreth wants of him," he pro­mi­sed, co­ming back to con­cerns he co­uld un­ders­tand and see for him­self. "I'm a tre­ac­he­ro­us old bas­tard, and if I think he's in tro­ub­le, I'll do­se the boy's wi­ne, ma­ke Kyndreth think he's had a fit, and drag him ho­me myself." He surp­ri­sed him­self with his own sud­den fi­er­ce pro­tec­ti­ve­ness, and tri­ed fe­ebly to smi­le. "Once we've got him sa­fe, we can talk him in­to pla­ying wit­less. If he's lost his sen­ses, he might not be of va­lue to Kyndreth, but he won't be a thre­at, eit­her."</p>
   <p>    And that was the best pro­mi­se he co­uld think of to gi­ve her, po­or as it was.</p>
   <p>    Lydiell sent Gel back to his work wit­ho­ut fe­eling much com­fort from his words. She was very tro­ub­led, and co­uld see no im­me­di­ate way out of the di­lem­ma that had co­me at them out of now­he­re. I had ho­ped to ke­ep him iso­la­ted from all of this, but events ha­ve cons­pi­red aga­inst us, she tho­ught som­berly, sta­ring out the win­dow at the pla­cid fi­elds spre­ad so in­vi­tingly be­low. Thanks to the two la­test Wi­zard Wars, Kyrti­an 's obs­cu­re skills are no lon­ger wit­ho­ut va­lue; he will be drawn in­to El­ven­lord po­li­tics whet­her he li­kes it or not. But Gel is right; tel­ling him so­me of the re­ali­ti­es of the si­tu­ati­on won't help him. He might be bet­ter if he re­ma­ins in ig­no­ran­ce. If he knows what the El­ven­lords are re­al­ly li­ke, his own sen­se of ho­nor just might dri­ve him to ma­ke so­me very dan­ge­ro­us cho­ices. If, ho­we­ver, Kyndreth fe­eds him what the Old Lords want him to know, and convinces him to help them-then ke­eps him ig­no­rant of the truth- he will ser­ve them well and stay out of tro­ub­le.</p>
   <p>    There was one po­si­ti­ve ef­fect of all the war­fa­re and qu­ar­re­ling; the­re we­re now­he­re ne­ar as many of the Old Lords as the­re on­ce had be­en, and tho­se that re­ma­ined we­re mostly very shrewd. They ha­ve lit­tle po­wer to spa­re, and won't was­te any to­ol that co­mes to the­ir hands when it costs lit­tle to ke­ep that to­ol con­tent. The­re are very few Dyrans abo­ut in the hig­her co­un­cils the­se days.</p>
   <p>    She sig­hed, tas­ting the bit­ter­ness of her own ex­pe­di­en­ce, the so­ur know­led­ge that by ke­eping him ig­no­rant she was pla­ying the sa­me ma­ni­pu­la­ti­ve ga­mes as tho­se she des­pi­sed.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian wo­uld be used, in­de­ed, but wasn't it bet­ter to be an un­wit­ting to­ol than a de­ad he­ro?</p>
   <p>    I can­not see any ot­her op­ti­ons.</p>
   <p>    Keeping him pur­po­se­ful­ly blin­ded abo­ut the true na­tu­re of his fel­low El­ven­lords might ha­ve be­en a mis­ta­ke, but she co­uld not see how she co­uld ha­ve do­ne anyt­hing el­se.</p>
   <p>    Gel did ha­ve a go­od idea, she re­min­ded her­self, if it lo­oks as if Kyrti­an is in dan­ger. Ever­yo­ne thinks his fat­her was mad, and no one wo­uld be par­ti­cu­larly surp­ri­sed if he went mad un­der the stra­ins they will pro­bably put him un­der. Oh, An­ces­tors, why did I try to ke­ep him shel­te­red? Why co­uldn 't I ha­ve gi­ven him so­me ar­mor aga­inst the thorn-ma­ze he is abo­ut to walk in­to?</p>
   <p>    She only pra­yed that her de­ci­si­on wo­uld not ca­use mo­re harm than she had ever dre­amt pos­sib­le.</p>

   <p>    I ho­pe I don't lo­ok as ner­vo­us as I fe­el," Kyrti­an mut­te­red to himself, as he re-chec­ked his ap­pe­aran­ce in the gilt-edged mirror to his right. He'd lost co­unt of the num­ber of ti­mes he'd glan­ced in­to mir­rors to­day, ma­king cer­ta­in-of what? He wasn't qu­ite su­re; he only knew that he didn't want to lo­ok li­ke Lord Kyndreth's son Gil­dor and his cro­ni­es, nor did he want to ape the ap­pe­aran­ce of Lord Kyndreth him­self. He wan­ted to lo­ok ma­tu­re, so­ber, per­haps a to­uch on the scho­larly si­de, but ab­le to hold his own in physi­cal com­bat as well. Lo­oking pros­pe­ro­us, but not ne­ces­sa­rily opu­lent, was as im­por­tant; on ref­lec­ti­on, per­haps what he wan­ted was to lo­ok as if he co­uld be Lord Kyndreth's in­tel­lec­tu­al equ­al, but not as if he al­re­ady as­su­med that he was. Af­ter go­ing thro­ugh at le­ast fo­ur chan­ges of clot­hing and ne­arly dri­ving his po­or ser­vants mad, he fi­nal­ly set­tled on a con­ser­va­ti­ve tu­nic and tight-fit­ting trews of soft do­es­kin dyed a rich blue and slas­hed to disp­lay the sil­ver sa­tin of his shirt. Matc­hing bo­ots su­itab­le for so­me hard wal­king comp­le­ted the out­fit, with a he­avy sil­ver cha­in and fil­let con­fi­ning his ha­ir as his only jewelry. Jewels wo­uld not imp­ress Lord Kyndreth, who was a po­wer­ful ma­ge and knew how easily such things co­uld be pro­du­ced by il­lu­si­on.</p>
   <p>    The mir­ror he kept glan­cing in­to was just out­si­de the Por­tal Cham­ber; at any mo­ment now Lord Kyndreth and his en­to­ura­ge sho­uld be co­ming thro­ugh. The do­or to the cham­ber was open; it was re­al­ly too small to al­low for a gra­ce­ful exit of so lar­ge a gro­up. Ser­vants in the ho­use­hold co­lors li­ned the cham­ber and the hall out­si­de, but Kyrti­an was the so­le rep­re­sen­ta­ti­ve of the fa­mily; he was the he­ad of the Clan now, and it wo­uld bet­ray an un­he­althy inf­lu­en­ce from his mot­her if she we­re he­re to re­ce­ive the gu­ests as well as he.</p>
   <p>    The ser­vants, well-scho­oled in the­ir ro­les, kept the­ir eyes cast down as Kyrti­an fid­ge­ted with the cha­in aro­und his neck. At long last, the Por­tal shim­me­red with energy, and Kyrti­an snap­ped to at­ten­ti­on, pre­sen­ting a mask of calm, the per­fect pic­tu­re of a wel­co­ming host.</p>
   <p>    The first fi­gu­res thro­ugh the Por­tal we­re, na­tu­ral­ly, Lord Kyrti­an's body­gu­ards, one of whom was the figh­ter cal­led Ka­eth that Kyrti­an re­mem­be­red from the com­bat. They dep­lo­yed them­sel­ves on eit­her si­de of the Por­tal with smo­oth, ef­fi­ci­ent, and prac­ti­ced mo­ve­ments, ma­king a bar­ri­er of them­sel­ves bet­we­en the Por­tal and Kyrti­an's ser­vants. They must go thro­ugh such ma­ne­uvers cons­tantly; what surp­ri­sed him was that they lo­oked alert and sus­pi­ci­o­us, not bo­red. The ser­vants to­ok no no­ti­ce; Gel had lec­tu­red them on what they co­uld ex­pect and what they sho­uld-or mo­re ap­prop­ri­ately, sho­uld not-do. They kept the­ir pla­ces, as if this sort of qu­asi-mi­li­tary in­va­si­on hap­pe­ned every day.</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth was next thro­ugh the do­or, fol­lo­wed by his son Gil­dor. Ka­eth mo­ved in clo­ser to his lord, stan­ding unobt­ru­si­vely ne­arby, clo­se eno­ugh to in­ter­cept any ag­gres­si­ve ac­ti­on. Kyrti­an mo­ved im­me­di­ately to wel­co­me the El­ven­lord, ma­king su­re that his own mo­ve­ments we­re non-aggres­si­ve.</p>
   <p>    "Welcome, my lord," he sa­id, pitc­hing his vo­ice low, but put­ting warmth in­to it. "And thank you for be­ing pa­ti­ent eno­ugh to wa­it un­til we co­uld wel­co­me you with all the ho­nor and com­fort that is yo­ur due. I ho­pe that you will be ple­ased with what we ha­ve to show you."</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth to­ok Kyrti­an's ex­ten­ded hand in his, in a firm clasp that was cle­arly a test. Kyrti­an re­tur­ned an equ­al pres­su­re, and Lord Kyndreth smi­led, ever so slightly, as he re­le­ased Kyrti­an's hand. "It is I who sho­uld be than­king you for yo­ur hos­pi­ta­lity, Lord Kyrti­an," he rep­li­ed, as they mo­ved for­ward to per­mit the rest of the en­to­ura­ge to co­me thro­ugh. "Yo­ur ho­use­hold is a qu­i­et one, and I un­ders­tand that you ha­ve few vi­si­tors; we are cre­ating qu­ite a dis­rup­ti­on for you."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian ma­de the ex­pec­ted disc­la­imers, as he kept one eye on Lord Kyndreth and the ot­her on Lord Gil­dor and the part of the en­to­ura­ge that was com­po­sed of Gil­dor's fri­ends. "I he­si­ta­te to men­ti­on this, my lord, but we we­re not ex­pec­ting so lar­ge a gro­up-per­haps so­me of the gu­ests wo­uld ac­cept ac­com­mo­da­ti­on in a pa­vi­li­on?"</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth east an eye back at his son and his son's fol­lo­wers, who we­re cle­arly in­to­xi­ca­ted and li­kely to re­ma­in that way for so­me ti­me. "Lord Gil­dor and his as­so­ci­ates are not re­ma­ining," he rep­li­ed smo­othly. "They ca­me only to vi­ew the pitc­hed bat­tle, and will de­part as so­on as the de­monst­ra­ti­on is comp­le­te."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian did not let out a sigh of re­li­ef, but so­me of his con­cern left him. Ho­using Gil­dor and his cro­ni­es was the last of his po­ten­ti­al prob­lems, and the only one he hadn't an­ti­ci­pa­ted.</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth and his ser­vants sho­uld be­ha­ve in pre­dic­tab­le ways, but Gil­dor and his drun­ken fri­ends we­re ne­it­her pre­dic­tab­le nor sa­fe for the ser­vants to be aro­und. They we­re used to get­ting the­ir way in all things, used to ta­king what they wan­ted, and it was en­ti­rely pos­sib­le that what they wan­ted wo­uld in­vo­ke auto­ma­tic, unt­hin­king re­bel­li­on in the hu­man ser­vants, who we­re not used to be­ing tre­ated as obj­ects to be used and dis­car­ded at will. But if Gil­dor and his cro­ni­es we­re al­re­ady plan­ning to le­ave right af­ter the de­monst­ra­ti­on-well, Kyrti­an was con­fi­dent his pe­op­le co­uld hold things to­get­her for that long.</p>
   <p>    "The de­monst­ra­ti­on is re­ady, my Lord," he sa­id; and ges­tu­red, brin­ging se­ve­ral pre-se­lec­ted ser­vants for­ward. "My pe­op­le will gu­ide yo­ur ser­vants to yo­ur qu­ar­ters, so that all will be in re­adi­ness for yo­ur com­fort when the bat­tle is over."</p>
   <p>    "Excellent." Kyndreth did not­hing, but Ka­eth ma­de a ges­tu­re, sen­ding two of the body­gu­ards and se­ve­ral of Kyndreth's sla­ves la­den with bag­ga­ge to jo­in Kyrti­an's ser­vants. Kyrti­an's pe­op­le qu­ickly to­ok over most of the bur­dens of the lug­ga­ge and led the ot­hers down the cor­ri­dor to­wards the gu­est-qu­ar­ters. Lord Kyndreth ga­ve an ex­pec­tant glan­ce at Kyrti­an, who to­ok the hint and led the rest of the gro­up thro­ugh the ma­ze of cor­ri­dors to the bal­cony out­si­de the les­ser di­ning-ro­om. This sa­me bal­cony over­lo­oked the fi­eld usu­al­ly used for ce­leb­ra­ti­ons; to­day it wo­uld be the si­te of a bat­tle.</p>
   <p>    For this oc­ca­si­on, the bal­cony was shel­te­red from the gla­re of the sun with an aw­ning ma­de of ta­pestry, gi­ving it the lo­ok of a vi­ewing-stand for a for­mal to­ur­na­ment. Banks of com­for­tab­le se­ats awa­ited the vi­si­tors, and ref­resh­ments had be­en pre­pa­red and set out to gre­et them, all un­der the watch­ful eye of Lady Lydi­ell. Out of the cor­ner of his eye, Kyrti­an saw the smugly su­pe­ri­or exp­res­si­ons of Gil­dor and his fri­ends chan­ged to lo­oks of gra­ti­fi­ca­ti­on and ple­asu­re. Ob­vi­o­usly they had not tho­ught to find a sop­his­ti­ca­ted le­vel of hos­pi­ta­lity in this pro­vin­ci­al ho­use­hold.</p>
   <p>    Now Kyrti­an pre­sen­ted his mot­her to the gu­ests; Lydi­ell had go­ne to gre­at ef­fort to ap­pe­ar as a typi­cal El­ven lady. Gow­ned and co­if­fed as her son had sel­dom se­en her be­fo­re, her exp­ression that of a flaw­less sta­tue, she re­semb­led her every­day self very lit­tle in­de­ed. Kyrti­an had not se­en her un­til this mo­ment, and win­ced in­wardly as he tho­ught how long she must ha­ve spent in the hands of her ser­vants to ac­hi­eve her ap­pe­aran­ce. Her sil­ver ha­ir had be­en di­vi­ded in­to hund­reds of tiny bra­ids, which had then be­en ar­ran­ged in a se­ri­es of dra­ped lo­ops and knots held in pla­ce with jewe­led pins. Her pas­tel-hu­ed gown, of mul­tip­le la­yers of misty, cob­web-li­ke blue fab­ric, with sle­eves and tra­in that tra­iled be­hind her, co­uld not pos­sibly be mo­re imp­rac­ti­cal for her nor­mal du­ti­es. Each and every hem had be­en ed­ged in la­ce so fi­ne it was clo­se to trans­pa­rent, and li­kely to snag on everyt­hing un­less gre­at pa­ins we­re ta­ken to pre­vent such a di­sas­ter. Tiny, spark­ling mo­tes of gems win­ked amid the misty folds of the gown, and mo­re gems strung on gos­sa­mer strands of sil­ver wre­at­hed her neck. From her to­es to the last ha­ir, Lydi­ell's cos­tu­me was so fra­gi­le it in­vi­ted ru­in in the me­re acts of mo­ving and wal­king.</p>
   <p>    That, ho­we­ver, was not an El­ven Lady's bu­si­ness to worry abo­ut; it was the duty of her sla­ves to ma­na­ge sle­eves and hems, and see to it that her gown re­ma­ined per­fect and pris­ti­ne at all ti­mes. So it was to­day; any ti­me Lydi­ell mo­ved, she was tra­iled by fo­ur wo­men who­se only pur­po­se was to see that she co­uld mo­ve abo­ut as easily as a gra­ce­ful ima­ge in a per­fect dayd­re­am.</p>
   <p>    This, of co­ur­se, was exactly what Lord Kyndreth ex­pec­ted to see, so he simply bo­wed over Lydi­ell's hand and es­cor­ted her back to her cha­ir whi­le Gil­dor and the rest cho­se se­ats. Lord Kyndreth to­ok the pla­ce of ho­nor at Lydi­ell's right hand, and Kyrti­an as­su­med the se­at at her left. As so­on as each gu­est was in his cho­sen se­at, a ser­vant pre­sen­ted him with a chil­led glass of spark­ling wi­ne and a plat­ter of da­in­ti­es from which to ma­ke a cho­ice. Gel and Kyrti­an had left not­hing to chan­ce, not even the num­ber of gu­ests; a yo­ung pa­ge had sprin­ted to the bal­cony whi­le Kyrti­an and Lord Kyndreth spo­ke to re­port the exact num­ber of El­ven­lords that had ar­ri­ved. The­re was ne­it­her one cha­ir too many, nor too few, and pre­ci­sely the cor­rect num­ber of ser­vants, one to each gu­est. The hu­man sla­ves, Lord Kyn-dreth's body­gu­ards inc­lu­ded, all sto­od, of co­ur­se. No sla­ve sat in the pre­sen­ce of his mas­ters.</p>
   <p>    Only when ever­yo­ne was set­tled, did the two "armi­es" mo­ve out on­to the fi­eld. Lord Kyndreth le­aned for­ward in his se­at im­me­di­ately, his at­ten­ti­on ri­ve­ted on the com­ba­tants. For his part, Kyrti­an tri­ed not to fid­get ner­vo­usly, tho­ugh not be­ca­use the suc­cess of the com­bat was in do­ubt. No, it was only that he was not on the fi­eld him­self; this wo­uld be the first ti­me he was only an ob­ser­ver rat­her than a par­ti­ci­pant. He fo­und, so­mew­hat to his own chag­rin, that he did not ma­ke a very go­od ob­ser­ver.</p>
   <p>    As the two for­ces char­ged to­wards each ot­her, sho­uting ta­unts and bat­tle-cri­es, Gil­dor and his fri­ends we­re mo­men­ta­rily di­ver­ted. But as the com­bat con­ti­nu­ed-and it was cle­ar that it wo­uld be a blo­od­less com­bat, as man af­ter man glo­wed scar­let or blue and had to re­ti­re to the si­de­li­nes-they qu­ickly lost in­te­rest.</p>
   <p>    "How many men can you hold this ma­gic on at a ti­me?" Lord Kyndreth as­ked qu­i­etly, as Kyrti­an ig­no­red the mut­te­red je­ers and scorn­ful la­ugh­ter of Gil­dor and his fri­ends.</p>
   <p>    "I don't know for cer­ta­in, my lord," Kyrti­an sa­id ho­nestly. "I've ne­ver had oc­ca­si­on to try it on mo­re than a tho­usand, so I ha­ve not yet fo­und an up­per li­mit."</p>
   <p>    "A tho­usand!" Kyndreth was cle­arly imp­res­sed, even if his son was un­derw­hel­med. "By the An­ces­tors, that is re­mar­kab­le! The­re sho­uld be no dif­fi­culty then in tra­ining bat­ta­li­ons of figh­ters in fi­eld ma­ne­uvers so long as se­ve­ral ma­ges are used to hold the ma­gic in pla­ce!"</p>
   <p>    "I sho­uld think not, my lord," Kyrti­an res­pon­ded de­fe­ren­ti­al­ly. "Espe­ci­al­ly if the ma­ges con­cer­ned are po­wer­ful ones such as yo­ur­self. I am cer­ta­in that you wo­uld find it a tri­vi­al task to hold the ma­gic on twi­ce that num­ber."</p>
   <p>    Behind them, Gil­dor and his fri­ends we­re ma­king de­ep in­ro­ads on the wi­ne, sho­wing qu­ite cle­arly just how bo­red they we­re with the com­bat. Ne­vert­he­less, gi­ven Lord Kyndreth's in­te­rest and ap­pro­val, they didn't da­re be too vo­cal in the­ir con­tempt.</p>
   <p>    Finally the­ir rest­les­sness got to the po­int whe­re it an­no­yed Lord Kyndreth him­self. The bat­tle had de­vol­ved in­to a mass of sing­le com­bats bet­we­en the most skil­led of the figh­ters, and it was ob­vi­o­us it wo­uld be so­me ti­me be­fo­re she­er we­ari­ness became the un­do­ing of many of the figh­ters. Lord Kyndreth ab­ruptly sto­od up, and Kyrti­an to­ok that as he was me­ant to, blo­wing the shrill whist­le that sig­na­led the end of the de­monst­ra­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Obedient to the sig­nal, figh­ting ce­ased im­me­di­ately, and in the sud­den si­len­ce, Lord Kyndreth tur­ned to his host with a bro­ad smi­le.</p>
   <p>    "This has be­en a most imp­res­si­ve de­monst­ra­ti­on, Lord Kyrti­an," he sa­id, with as much warmth as Kyrti­an had ever se­en him disp­lay un­til now. "Even mo­re so than the sing­le-com­bat you ori­gi­nal­ly sho­wed us. I am lo­oking for­ward to le­ar­ning this new ap­pli­ca­ti­on of ma­gic in the next few days-but I fe­ar than my son and his fri­ends ha­ve pre­vi­o­us com­mit­ments and must be on the­ir way-" Now he le­ve­led a ga­ze on his be­mu­sed son that sho­ok the yo­ung El­ven­lord in­to mo­men­tary sob­ri­ety. "Mustn't you, Gil­dor?"</p>
   <p>    The yo­un­ger lord, start­led by his si­re's ab­rupt chan­ge of mo­od, stam­me­red out his reply. "Of-of co­ur­se, cer­ta­inly," he bab­bled. "Pre­vi­o­us com­mit­ments, pres­sing en­ga­ge­ments, and all that. So sorry. Ex­cel­lent show. Be on our way now-"</p>
   <p>    "My pe­op­le will show you the way back to the Por­tal Cham­ber, Lord Gil­dor," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, with as fi­ne a disp­lay of the he­ight of go­od man­ners as an­yo­ne co­uld ha­ve as­ked. He ga­ve no hint that he had he­ard the dis­pa­ra­ging re­marks, nor that he was well awa­re that Gil­dor was so drank he pro­bably co­uld not ha­ve fo­und the do­or wit­ho­ut help. "I can­not tell you how gra­ti­fi­ed I was by yo­ur pre­sen­ce, or by yo­ur ap­pre­ci­ati­on. I ho­pe that we will be ab­le to gi­ve you a bet­ter de­monst­ra­ti­on of our hos­pi­ta­lity at so­me ti­me in the fu­tu­re."</p>
   <p>    Gildor and his fri­ends fi­led back in­to the di­ning hall, sub­du­ed by Lord Kyndreth's ent­hu­si­as­tic re­cep­ti­on of the de­monst­ra­ti­on. The­re we­re no mo­re je­ering asi­des, no mo­re snic­kers. Kyrti­an was un­der no il­lu­si­ons abo­ut this; he fully ex­pec­ted that the mo­ment the yo­un­ger El­ven­lords pas­sed the Por­tal, they wo­uld be­gin the­ir scorn­ful gos­sip aga­in. But for now, it was ob­vi­o­us who the mas­ter was, and what the mas­ter ap­pro­ved-and all the yo­ung lords fell obe­di­ently in­to li­ne.</p>
   <p>    Odd, Kyrti­an tho­ught, as Lord Kyndreth exc­han­ged so­me polite comp­li­ments with Lady Lydi­ell and the last of the un­wan­ted vi­si­tors pas­sed thro­ugh the do­ors of the les­ser di­ning hall. I wo­uld ha­ve tho­ught, gi­ven the way he li­kes to puff him­self up and blus­ter, that Gil­dor wo­uld ha­ve si­ded with the Yo­ung Lords aga­inst his fat­her. Lord Kyndreth isn't go­ing to pass over po­wer any ti­me in the fo­re­se­e­ab­le fu­tu­re, and I wo­uld ha­ve tho­ught that by now Gil­dor wo­uld be hungry for that po­wer.</p>
   <p>    Perhaps, tho­ugh, Gil­dor li­ked com­fort bet­ter than po­wer. Per­haps he al­re­ady knew he didn't da­re to chal­len­ge his fat­her. Or, per­haps Gil­dor was less am­bi­ti­o­us than Kyrti­an wo­uld ha­ve be­en in his pla­ce. As it was, Gil­dor had pres­ti­ge, sta­tus, and a ca­ref­ree, pam­pe­red exis­ten­ce. If he sat whe­re his fat­her now he­Jd sway, he might ac­tu­al­ly ha­ve to work.</p>
   <p>    Kyndreth tur­ned to Kyrti­an, who col­lec­ted his scat­te­red thoughts. "I be­li­eve that I wo­uld li­ke to re­ti­re to my qu­ar­ters to prejpare for din­ner and think abo­ut all you ha­ve shown me," he said."Unless you ha­ve so­met­hing mo­re plan­ned to show me today?"</p>
   <p>    "Only one thing, and that is on the way," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, with a slight smi­le. "Ple­ase, al­low me to es­cort you. Per­haps so­me qu­es­ti­ons will oc­cur to you that I can ans­wer as we walk."</p>
   <p>    They both bo­wed to Lady Lydi­ell, who nod­ded gra­vely to both of them wit­ho­ut spe­aking. Kyrti­an wa­ited whi­le one of the ser­vants held the do­or open for them; he al­so wa­ited for the body­gu­ards to flank his gu­est be­fo­re ta­king his own pla­ce be­si­de Kyndreth. Ot­her than that, he pa­id no at­ten­ti­on to the body­gu­ards.</p>
   <p>    Kyndreth glan­ced sharply aro­und as they pas­sed along the hal­lways; for a mo­ment, Kyrti­an won­de­red what had ca­ught his at­ten­ti­on, then Kyndreth ans­we­red his qu­es­ti­on with a qu­ery of his own.</p>
   <p>    "You use no il­lu­si­on he­re, do you?" Kyndreth as­ked, as if surp­ri­sed.</p>
   <p>    "Very lit­tle, my lord," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, and smi­led slightly. "Per­haps we are so­mew­hat con­ser­va­ti­ve in na­tu­re, but we-my mot­her and I, that is-pre­fer the re­al to the il­lu­sory. Il­lu­si­on is-" He gro­ped for words.</p>
   <p>    "Cheap?" Kyndreth surp­ri­sed him with the word he had be­en trying to avo­id, and the iro­nic lif­ting of his eyeb­row. "I tend to ag­ree, ac­tu­al­ly. Any half­way com­pe­tent ma­ge can clo­ak rot­ting tim­ber and moth-eaten ta­pestry in il­lu­si­on. To ma­in­ta­in a gra­ci­o­us and at­trac­ti­ve ho­me wit­ho­ut il­lu­si­on re­qu­ires de­di­ca­ti­on and ef­fort. Il­lu­si­on is, I be­li­eve, the lazy man's way."</p>
   <p>    "I ag­ree, my lord. We he­re pre­fer subs­tan­ce to style, one might say." Aga­in, he ven­tu­red a smi­le. "Our ho­me may be old-fas­hi­oned in style, but that is the pri­ce of pre­fer­ring subs­tan­ce."</p>
   <p>    By this ti­me, they had re­ac­hed the area of the old nur­sery- which was now the new ha­rem-and Kyrti­an pa­used. "I wo­uld li­ke to of­fer you all the com­forts of our ho­use, my lord. If you wo­uld ca­re to pass wit­hin?"</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth co­uld easily see the shim­mer of po­wer that clo­aked the do­or, which me­ant his body­gu­ards wo­uld not be ab­le to fol­low him in­si­de. But the­re was al­so no do­ubt what Kyrti­an's words had imp­li­ed, and he was pro­bably cu­ri­o­us just what sort of ha­rem the no­to­ri­o­usly as­ce­tic Kyrti­an had. He sig­na­led to his body­gu­ards to jo­in the two gu­ards at the do­or, and fol­lo­wed Kyrti­an wit­hin.</p>
   <p>    The three yo­ung wo­men we­re wa­iting for them, and ro­se ins­tantly to the­ir fe­et, pa­using just long eno­ugh for Lord Kyndreth to get a go­od lo­ok at them be­fo­re they sank to the gro­und in de­ep curt­si­es.</p>
   <p>    For the very first ti­me, Kyrti­an saw the Gre­at Lord surp­ri­sed. So surp­ri­sed, in fact, that his jaw drop­ped, just a trif­le. The he re­co­ve­red his com­po­su­re, and tur­ned to Kyrti­an with a sly grin.</p>
   <p>    "You yo­ung dog!" he exc­la­imed, and clap­ped Kyrti­an on the sho­ul­der. "No won­der not­hing tempts you to mix with the ot­her yo­ungs­ters. They ha­ven't anyt­hing to of­fer that co­uld ever match the­se tre­asu­res!"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian bo­wed his he­ad slightly. "So I be­li­eve, my lord." He ges­tu­red, and the yo­ung wo­men, flus­hing pret­tily, ro­se aga­in. Lord Kyndreth sur­ve­yed them aga­in, his eyes lin­ge­ring on each in turn.</p>
   <p>    "I be­li­eve I shall ta­ke up yo­ur of­fer," he sa­id with a chuck­le. "But af­ter din­ner. The­re is, as the An­ces­tors sa­id, a ple­asu­re in an­ti­ci­pa­ti­on that the wi­se man le­arns to che­rish as much as the ful­fil­lment of that an­ti­ci­pa­ti­on."</p>
   <p>    "Very true, my lord," Kyrti­an mur­mu­red de­fe­ren­ti­al­ly. "Very true."</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth was a surp­ri­singly go­od din­ner-gu­est. He ate and drank mo­de­ra­tely, ga­ve pra­ise to the co­ok, and to­ok ca­re to in­vol­ve Lady Lydi­ell in the con­ver­sa­ti­on. Kyrti­an gra­du­al­ly re­la­xed. The vi­sit was go­ing well; if it con­ti­nu­ed in this ve­in, the en­ti­re ex­pen­di­tu­re of ti­me and energy wo­uld ha­ve be­en well re­pa­id.</p>
   <p>    As the des­sert co­ur­se was bro­ught in, Lord Kyndreth tur­ned to Kyrti­an, and for the first ti­me the­re was a hint of he­si­ta­ti­on in his exp­res­si­on. "Lord Kyrti­an, the­re is so­met­hing that I ha­ve be­en cu­ri­o­us abo­ut for a very long ti­me, but I he­si­ta­te to bring up a su­bj­ect that wo­uld ca­use you or yo­ur Lady-Mot­her any dis­com­fort."</p>
   <p>    "What su­bj­ect wo­uld that be?" Kyrti­an as­ked, ca­uti­o­usly.</p>
   <p>    "I am-and ha­ve be­en-very cu­ri­o­us abo­ut yo­ur la­te fat­her," ca­me the surp­ri­sing ans­wer. "Mo­re to the po­int, I am cu­ri­o­us as to his re­asons for va­nis­hing in­to the wil­der­ness. I know so­me ha­ve ma­de inap­prop­ri­ate ob­ser­va­ti­ons abo­ut him, but I saw not­hing in yo­ur fat­her's de­me­anor be­fo­re he va­nis­hed to ma­ke me be­li­eve that he had anyt­hing but very go­od re­asons for his ac­ti­ons."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian glan­ced at his mot­her, who nod­ded slightly. The uns­po­ken mes­sa­ge was cle­ar: he co­uld go ahe­ad and re­ve­al so­me of what he al­re­ady knew.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian cle­ared his thro­at. "The­re is a tra­di­ti­on-so­me might call it a le­gend-in our fa­mily that when the El­ves first ca­me ac­ross from Eve­lon, the mac­hi­nes and most of the bo­oks they had bro­ught with them we­re too bur­den­so­me to carry. Mo­re pres­sing con­cerns had to be de­alt with-in the hunt for a pla­ce to li­ve and the me­ans to do so, an­ci­ent know­led­ge was of no use in such a brand new world. So all the­se things we­re mo­re of a han­di­cap than an ad­van­ta­ge, and they we­re cac­hed shortly af­ter the se­arch for mo­re hos­pi­tab­le ter­ri­tory be­gan. For so­me re­ason, no one ever went back for them-per­haps only be­ca­use the El­ven­lords we­re too busy sub­du­ing the na­ti­ves. Tho­se cac­hes of an­ci­ent know­led­ge we­re what my fat­her was hun­ting when he va­nis­hed."</p>
   <p>    "Interesting." Lord Kyndreth pul­led at his lo­wer lip in tho­ught. "Assu­ming that the­re is use­ful know­led­ge the­re that we ha­ve lost, which is qu­ite pos­sib­le, who­ever fo­und tho­se cac­hed ma­te­ri­als co­uld ha­ve a dis­tinct ad­van­ta­ge."</p>
   <p>    "Since I rep­li­ca­ted my met­hods of com­bat-tra­ining by me­ans of re­se­arch in­to the old bo­oks we still ha­ve, I sus­pect the­re is a gre­at de­al of know­led­ge that has be­en lost or for­got­ten," Kyrt-ian rep­li­ed, som­berly. "Frankly, I ha­ve no idea what might lie out the­re, nor did my fat­her. We simply ha­ven't got eno­ugh in­for­ma­ti­on even to ma­ke a gu­ess."</p>
   <p>    What he did not ob­ser­ve was that Lady Lydi­ell knew so­met­hing mo­re and had told Kyrti­an her fa­mily tra­di­ti­ons as well as his fat­her's. And it was not par­ti­cu­larly flat­te­ring to the Gre­at Lords of this land.</p>
   <p>    The ta­le of the Cros­sing was one that the Gre­at Lords had pro­bably do­ne the­ir best to for­get. The­re had be­en a ci­vil war in Eve­lon, and the­ir si­de was the one that was, at the ti­me of the Cros­sing, the lo­sing si­de. The an­ces­tors of the cur­rent Er­ven-lords de­ci­ded to es­ca­pe thro­ugh the Ga­te they wo­uld bu­ild to­get­her, ta­king the­ir chan­ces on fin­ding a hos­pi­tab­le land with easily co­wed na­ti­ves on the ot­her si­de. It was eit­her that, or fa­ce sur­ren­der, and ha­ve the­ir po­wer reft from them by the win­ners. The re­sult wo­uld be that the lo­sers wo­uld li­ve on, but ens­la­ved, and disg­ra­ced.</p>
   <p>    "Official" his­tory sa­id lit­tle of the war, and did not even hint that the El­ven­lords might ha­ve be­en get­ting the worst of the conf­lict. Ins­te­ad, by com­mon con­sent, the An­ces­tors we­re re­gar­ded as bold, fe­ar­less pi­one­ers, stri­king out on the­ir own when li­fe in Eve­lon grew we­ari­so­me thro­ugh its ne­ver-chan­ging sa­me­ness.</p>
   <p>    Lady Lydi­ell knew mo­re, pre­ser­ved thro­ugh the fe­ma­le li­ne. Even tho­ugh it had be­en ag­re­ed that all of the El­ven ma­ges wo­uld po­ol the­ir strength and ma­gic, the mo­re unsc­ru­pu­lo­us and sel­fish held back. As a re­sult, when the Ga­te went up, so­me we­re dra­ined of ma­gic po­wer, whi­le ot­hers still had eno­ugh to ma­ke them the ru­lers on the ot­her si­de.</p>
   <p>    That was the dif­fe­ren­ce bet­we­en the ori­gi­nal Gre­at Lords and the Les­ser Lords, and not, as the Gre­at Lords wo­uld ha­ve ever­yo­ne be­li­eve, a mat­ter of in­tel­li­gen­ce and in­he­ri­ted po­wer.</p>
   <p>    "The mac­hi­nes that ca­me over se­emed to en­co­un­ter dif­fi­cul­ti­es, pos­sibly due to the dis­rup­ti­ve ef­fect of the Ga­te on the­ir spells, and may ha­ve be­en aban­do­ned as a con­se­qu­en­ce. My fat­her had fo­und a spe­cu­la­ti­ve do­cu­ment sug­ges­ting that the war-mac­hi­nes they bro­ught with them co­uld be dra­ined for po­wer, even if they no lon­ger wor­ked cor­rectly," Kyrti­an went on. "If so, they co­uld pro­vi­de a re­ser­vo­ir of ma­gic to fall back on when a ma­ge's own po­wers we­re dep­le­ted."</p>
   <p>    Once aga­in, he saw Lord Kyndreth's eyes nar­row slightly, as he con­temp­la­ted this pos­si­bi­lity. Kyrti­an's fat­her had in­ten­ded-if it co­uld be do­ne-to res­to­re the ma­gic to tho­se El­ves who lac­ked it. Lord Kyndreth was pro­bably thin­king in terms of ke­eping all that po­wer to him­self, to be do­led out as he cho­se.</p>
   <p>    That wo­uld gi­ve him unp­re­ce­den­ted po­wer among his own pe­ers, and an unp­re­ce­den­ted to­ol to ma­ni­pu­la­te them. A ma­ge with such a re­so­ur­ce at his dis­po­sal wo­uld be what the El­ven-lords had ne­ver yet had.</p>
   <p>    A King.</p>
   <p>    "At any ra­te, that was why Fat­her was out hun­ting-lo­oking for the mac­hi­nes and the bo­oks, and ob­vi­o­usly this was not so­met­hing that a ra­ti­onal man wo­uld ha­ve hu­man sla­ves do­ing, be­ca­use of the dan­gers imp­li­cit in ex­po­sing sla­ves to things so unk­nown and unp­re­dic­tab­le," Kyrti­an fi­nis­hed. "The hu­mans do ha­ve the­ir own form of ma­gic, af­ter all-and who knows what ex­po­su­re to tho­se mac­hi­nes wo­uld do? It might free them of the­ir col­lars-might gi­ve them po­wers to match ours! No, that was a task he pre­fer­red to ke­ep to him­self."</p>
   <p>    "I can see why-and yo­ur fat­her was a far wi­ser man than an­yo­ne has gi­ven him cre­dit for be­ing," Lord Kyndreth sa­id gra­vely. "Now you ha­ve gi­ven me twi­ce as much to think abo­ut…"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian sho­ok his he­ad. "But this talk of lost mac­hi­nes and cac­hed bo­oks-such things su­rely must wa­it un­til we ha­ve de­alt with the Halfb­lo­ods and our own re­bel­li­o­us yo­uth." He deliberately fra­med the reply to inc­lu­de him­self in the op­po­si­te party to the Yo­ung Lords, and he saw Lord Kyndreth smi­le in reply.</p>
   <p>    "You are cor­rect," the Gre­at Lord rep­li­ed. "And long be­fo­re we do that, the­re is much we must ac­comp­lish-not the le­ast of which is to do jus­ti­ce to the fi­na­le of this ex­cel­lent me­al."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian sig­ned in­ter­nal­ly, and ans­we­red Kyndreth's smi­le with one of his own. He had be­en ac­cep­ted-per­haps not as an equ­al, but cer­ta­inly as an ally. And that sho­uld put pa­id to Co­usin Ael­mar­kin's plans for the ne­ar fu­tu­re, at le­ast.</p>
   <p>    "Very true, my lord," he mur­mu­red. "You are en­ti­rely cor­rect, as usu­al."</p>

   <p>    One worry, at le­ast, was off Kyrti­an's mind by the next mor­ning. As so­on as he awo­ke, he pa­id a ca­uti­o­us vi­sit to the ha­rem; if anyt­hing unp­le­asant had hap­pe­ned to the yo­ung wo­men, he wan­ted to be the one to de­al with it. He was, af­ter all, the one res­pon­sib­le for them.</p>
   <p>    But as it hap­pe­ned, Lord Kyndreth had tre­ated all three of the ha­rem wo­men very well; had, in fact, gi­ven them each a hand­so­me gift of jewelry for ple­asing him. They we­re ex­ci­ted and happy, and did not ma­ke much of an ef­fort to dis­gu­ise the­ir ho­pes that the­re might be mo­re such vi­sits-and pre­sents- from the Gre­at Lord. Kyrti­an fo­und it rat­her to­uc­hing, ac­tu­al­ly; they we­re so li­ke three lit­tle girls in the­ir in­no­cent ple­asu­re at be­ing re­war­ded with ba­ub­les.</p>
   <p>    There we­re three ot­her El­ven­lords in Kyndreth's en­to­ura­ge, but no­ne of them we­re of high eno­ugh sta­tus to be of­fe­red the ser­vi­ces of the ha­rem. They wo­uld ha­ve to put up with en­for­ced chas­tity un­til they re­tur­ned to the­ir own ho­mes, for ho­use-ser­vants, un­less they ac­tu­al­ly of­fe­red them­sel­ves or we­re offered by the host, we­re con­si­de­red off-li­mits. If Lord Kyndreth had shown him­self to be lu­ke­warm in his re­gard for Kyrti­an, such a bre­ach of eti­qu­et­te co­uld ha­ve ta­ken pla­ce any­way, but not when Kyndreth had shown his fa­vor. Kyrti­an co­uld re­mo­ve at le­ast this one mi­nor con­cern from his long list of wor­ri­es; the girls wo­uld not be abu­sed by his gu­est, nor wo­uld his ser­vants be mist­re­ated by Kyndreth's un­der­lings.</p>
   <p>    As so­on as Lord Kyndreth put in an ap­pe­aran­ce and had bro­ken his fast, the rest of the day was spent in an odd ro­le-re­ver­sal, as Kyrti­an tu­to­red the ol­der Lord in the ma­gic of mock-com­bat.</p>
   <p>    It felt awk­ward. It was al­so dan­ge­ro­us work, and not from a ma­gi­cal stand­po­int. So­me­how Kyrti­an had to si­mul­ta­ne­o­usly be te­ac­her and de­fe­ren­ti­al (but not gro­ve­ling) Les­ser Lord to Kyndreth's Gre­ater. Kyrti­an wal­ked a nar­row li­ne bet­we­en tho­se two ext­re­mes, and he da­red not de­vi­ate from it, if he wan­ted Lord Kyndreth's pro­tec­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    But Lord Kyndreth wan­ted this know­led­ge badly eno­ugh to exert him­self to be ac­com­mo­da­ting and char­ming, and slowly Kyrti­an be­gan to re­lax, for­get abo­ut his own ca­re­ful po­se, and simply inst­ruct.</p>
   <p>    He'd cal­led in all of his figh­ters to act as su­bj­ects for the prac­ti­ce, tho­ugh ini­ti­al­ly the ma­gic was only cast on one. Kyrti­an was su­re eno­ugh of his own mas­tery that he rec­ko­ned he co­uld co­un­ter any mis­ta­kes Lord Kyndreth ma­de be­fo­re they ca­used any harm, and it was a very re­al me­asu­re of the trust his men had in him that the figh­ters to­ok that for gran­ted, stan­ding re­la­xed and un­con­cer­ned whi­le Lord Kyndreth felt his way thro­ugh the we­aving of the comp­li­ca­ted ma­gery the first ti­me. It to­ok a fi­ne to­uch, a de­li­ca­te to­uch, to en­su­re that the figh­ter en-spel­led felt eno­ugh of a war­ning ting­le to tell him that he'd be­en hit, even in the ex­ci­te­ment of com­bat-yet was kept from ac­tu­al­ly be­ing hurt, which wo­uld be co­un­terp­ro­duc­ti­ve.</p>
   <p>    "This is the op­po­si­te of the way we tra­in our gla­di­ators now," Kyndreth ob­ser­ved, pa­using to wi­pe his brow with a spot­less scrap of whi­te silk, which he then drop­ped, wit­ho­ut thin­king abo­ut it, on the gro­und be­hind him. His own man auto­ma­ti­cal­ly ret­ri­eved the hand­kerc­hi­ef and step­ped back aga­in. Kyndreth never even no­ti­ced. "When they prac­ti­ce, even with blun­ted we­apons, the po­int is that they will be hurt if they al­low a blow to fall, and so the­ir de­fen­se-work is sup­po­sed to imp­ro­ve."</p>
   <p>    "Yes, but if that blow falls, even in prac­ti­ce, it can di­sab­le a man," Kyrti­an po­in­ted out, as the figh­ter wa­ited pa­ti­ently for Kyndreth to comp­le­te the spel­lcas­ting. "What's the go­od of le­ar­ning from yo­ur mis­ta­ke if you end up lo­sing so much ti­me in re­co­ve­ring from yo­ur inj­ury that you ha­ve to go back to the be­gin­ning aga­in? Con­di­ti­oning is as im­por­tant as tra­ining, or so my ex­pe­ri­en­ce le­ads me to be­li­eve."</p>
   <p>    "Oh, you are ar­gu­ing with the con­ver­ted, yo­ung fri­end," Kyndreth chuck­led, ca­su­al­ly mas­sa­ging his hands as if they felt stiff. "I've lost far too many fi­ne and pro­mi­sing spe­ci­mens per­ma­nently to so-cal­led 'tra­ining ac­ci­dents.' It's a costly bu­si­ness- too costly, when now we ne­ed figh­ters for re­al com­bat mo­re than we ne­ed gla­di­ators." He re­su­med the task be­fo­re him, and the figh­ter be­gan to ha­ve a fa­intly glo­wing aura.</p>
   <p>    "In the ca­se of men who are stub­born abo­ut ack­now­led­ging hits, I do set it high eno­ugh to hurt, tho­ugh," Kyrti­an ad­mit­ted, as he su­per­vi­sed Lord Kyndreth's ef­fort. "The­re are so­me fel­lows who get so wor­ked up du­ring a fight that not­hing less than re­al pa­in se­ems to get thro­ugh to them."</p>
   <p>    "Those men I wo­uld put in the front li­nes," Kyndreth ob­ser­ved wryly, with a si­de glan­ce at Kyrti­an. "If they are that im­per­vi­o­us. I've se­en a few of tho­se; they ha­ve a kind of mad­ness in bat­tle. It's use­ful if they're in the front li­ne, but they're as much a dan­ger to fri­end as to foe anyw­he­re el­se. I put 'em on the po­int of a thrust; let them car­ve the­ir way in, and ta­ke gro­und be­hind them with figh­ters that can ke­ep the­ir he­ads."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian nod­ded, alt­ho­ugh he ha­ted to think of any of his figh­ters be­ing in the front li­nes of re­al com­bat. His eyes nar­ro­wed as he kept track of Lord Kyndreth's prog­ress. "The­re-" he ca­uti­oned. "That is exactly the le­vel you can usu­al­ly set it at. That's per­fect." As Kyndreth let go of his cont­rol of the fi­eld aro­und the figh­ter, Kyrti­an fle­xed his sho­ul­ders to ease so­me of the stra­in in them. "Now we bu­ild the we­apon." He smi­led. "That's not as dif­fi­cult; it's just a lit­tle dif­fe­rent from a truly ex­pert il­lu­si­on."</p>
   <p>    Once Kyndreth had the ini­ti­al ma­gic set, he was ab­le to swiftly ma­ke co­pi­es upon as many figh­ters as Kyrti­an had pre­sent. "This is ama­zing!" he ob­ser­ved, his eyes wi­de­ning a lit­tle, as his to­tal pas­sed twenty. "The first one is dif­fi­cult, but the­re is very lit­tle dra­in on­ce the ini­ti­al figh­ter is do­ne! 1 had ex­pec­ted this to be qu­ite ex­pen­si­ve in terms of per­so­nal energy."</p>
   <p>    "I be­li­eve that is be­ca­use you aren't exactly rep­li­ca­ting the ma­gic-I be­li­eve you are simply spre­ading it to inc­lu­de every sub­se­qu­ent figh­ter," Kyrti­an ob­ser­ved, ple­ased with how qu­ickly Lord Kyndreth had le­ar­ned the spe­ci­al tech­ni­qu­es. The so­oner he has mas­te­red all this, the so­oner he can be go­ne, and we can get this mas­qu­era­de over with. "I ho­pe that ma­kes sen­se to you."</p>
   <p>    "Perfect sen­se." Kyndreth ga­ve him an odd lo­ok. "Do you al­so ma­ke a study of the mec­ha­nics and the­ory of ma­gic? It's an eso­te­ric branch of study, and one I had not as­so­ci­ated with so­me­one who is so cle­arly a-well, a sol­di­er, so to spe­ak, rat­her than a pu­re scho­lar."</p>
   <p>    "Only a lit­tle-I had to do a cer­ta­in amo­unt of study to rep­li­ca­te this-" he wa­ved his hand va­gu­ely at the as­semb­led figh­ters. "I won't cla­im to be a ge­ni­us, or even to ha­ve a par­ti­cu­lar knack for re­se­arch, only a gre­at de­al of pa­ti­en­ce and per­sis­ten­ce when it co­mes to so­met­hing I'm in­te­res­ted in."</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth's exp­res­si­on blan­ked for a mo­ment, as if Kyrti­an's at­ti­tu­de had ta­ken him aback, but he sa­id not­hing.</p>
   <p>    "Well, let's ha­ve the figh­ters pa­ir off, and see the ma­gic in ac­ti­on, shall we?" Kyrti­an con­ti­nu­ed, won­de­ring what that lo­ok me­ant. Ha­ve I be­en too mo­dest? Ha­ve I tip­ped my hand? Or is it just that he isn't used to he­aring so­me­one that do­esn't bo­ast abo­ut his pro­wess?</p>
   <p>    "An ex­cel­lent plan." Lord Kyndreth step­ped to the si­de­li­nes, and Kyrti­an sig­na­led to the figh­ters to be­gin spar­ring. Lord Kyndreth's ple­asu­re in the dis­co­very that his rep­li­ca­ti­on of the ma­gic func­ti­oned exactly the sa­me as Kyrti­an's was ob­vi­o­us.</p>
   <p>    For his own part, Kyrti­an was just as ple­ased. For on­ce, he didn't ha­ve to hold both si­des in the spell, and that fre­ed up eno­ugh of his at­ten­ti­on that he co­uld mo­re fully ap­pre­ci­ate the skill of his men.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian sig­na­led to his men to stop, and tur­ned to his gu­est, his own fe­eling of ac­comp­lish­ment matc­hing Lord Kyndreth's. "You are a mar­ve­lo­usly qu­ick study, my lord, and no one wo­uld do­ubt yo­ur mas­tery of ma­gic," he sa­id, wim no in­tent to flat­ter. "I do not think you ne­ed to le­arn anyt­hing el­se from me. You ha­ve the tech­ni­que now, and all that you ne­ed is prac­ti­ce. In ti­me you will pro­bably be fas­ter even than I at set­ting the ma­gic."</p>
   <p>    "Practice is so­met­hing I can get at ho­me; I will not stra­in yo­ur ge­ne­ro­us hos­pi­ta­lity lon­ger than I ha­ve to," the Gre­at Lord rep­li­ed im­me­di­ately, much to Kyrti­an's ve­iled re­li­ef. He wants to le­ave so so­on! Thank the An­ces­tors!</p>
   <p>    "Truly, it is a gre­at ho­nor to be yo­ur host," he pro­tes­ted any­way, for form's sa­ke.</p>
   <p>    "And truly, it is a gre­at in­con­ve­ni­en­ce for you," Kyndreth sa­id, with just a to­uch of moc­kery in his vo­ice. "I am not blind, Kyrti­an. For all that you and yo­ur Lady Mot­her li­ve gra­ci­o­usly, yo­ur me­ans are li­mi­ted, and I am a bur­den on them. This is a small and very pri­va­te ma­nor, and my folk are an int­ru­si­on and an in­con­ve­ni­en­ce to yo­ur ro­uti­ne, no mat­ter how you clo­ak that in go­od man­ners. I shall beg yo­ur for­be­aran­ce for just this one night mo­re, for the­re is so­met­hing I wo­uld li­ke to dis­cuss with you, but to­mor­row my folk and I will le­ave you and yo­urs in pe­ace. Me­anw­hi­le-I fe­el in strong ne­ed of a bath and a rest!"</p>
   <p>    Before Kyrti­an had a chan­ce to re­act to the first part of that sta­te­ment, Lord Kyndreth had clap­ped him on the back li­ke an old fri­end, then tur­ned to dis­miss the ma­gic he had cast over the figh­ters. He stro­de off in the di­rec­ti­on of the ma­nor, pre­su­mably to re­turn to the gu­est qu­ar­ters, le­aving Kyrti­an in char­ge of his own pe­op­le.</p>
   <p>    "You did well, men; Gel, ta­ke over the prac­ti­ce," was all he da­red say, not kno­wing whet­her he was un­der so­me co­vert ob­ser­va­ti­on. He re­cast the ma­gic, and Ser­ge­ant Gel as­su­med com­mand, bar­king out or­ders to pa­ir off and start spar­ring. He watc­hed, an ob­ser­ver rat­her than a par­ti­ci­pant, as the figh­ters went thro­ugh the­ir usu­al pa­ces, chan­ging we­apons, chan­ging spar­ring-part­ners, un­til they we­re all drenc­hed with swe­at and ex­ha­us­ted. It was very dif­fi­cult to re­ma­in alo­of; his hands twitched to hold a sword, and se­ve­ral ti­mes he had to for­ce him­self to re­ma­in qu­i­et when so­me­one re­qu­ired cor­rec­ti­on. It wo­uld not do for him to cor­rect the men him­self; he must be pa­ti­ent and wa­it for Gel to spot the prob­lem and de­al with it. Kyn-dreth might ha­ve a man watc­hing; he co­uld ha­ve a ma­gi­cal "eye" ob­ser­ving them. It wo­uld not do for Kyrti­an to be se­en wa­ding in as if he was of no hig­her es­ta­te than his own drill-mas­ter. Only when the men we­re comp­le­tely ex­ha­us­ted did he dis­miss them and per­mit them to re­turn to the­ir own qu­ar­ters un­der the su­per­vi­si­on of Ser­ge­ant Gel. And only then co­uld he re­turn to his mot­her's of­fi­ce and find out what Lord Kyndreth's three un­der­lings had be­en do­ing whi­le he and Kyndreth we­re oc­cu­pi­ed with the figh­ters.</p>
   <p>    Lady Lydi­ell was wa­iting for him as he ro­se thro­ugh the flo­or of her of­fi­ce; she must ha­ve se­en him ap­pro­ac­hing from the prac­ti­ce-fi­eld. "Te­neb­rinth to­ok them ri­ding," she sa­id im­me­di­ately, kno­wing with that acu­ity that so­me­ti­mes re­semb­led a hu­man's ma­gic what he wan­ted be­fo­re he even vo­iced the qu­es­ti­on. "They just wan­ted exer­ci­se; I think they we­re bo­red. Te­neb­rinth to­ok them on a to­ur of the hun­ting-re­ser­ve, which is far eno­ugh away from any of our lit­tle vil­la­ges to ke­ep anyt­hing un­to­ward from hap­pe­ning, and I think they may ac­tu­al­ly ha­ve do­ne a lit­tle hun­ting them­sel­ves. Lo­ok-you can see them from he­re-"</p>
   <p>    She po­in­ted, and he went to the wes­tern si­de of the of­fi­ce, pe­ering in­to the dis­tan­ce un­til he ca­ught sight of fo­ur bril­li­antly co­lo­red ato­mi­es ma­king the­ir way along­si­de a tree li­ne that had be­en re­du­ced by dis­tan­ce to a me­re blur of gre­en.</p>
   <p>    "What abo­ut Kyndreth's hu­man sla­ves?" he as­ked, wit­ho­ut ta­king his eyes off the dis­tant ri­ders.</p>
   <p>    "They re­ma­ined wit­hin the gu­est-qu­ar­ters, ex­cept for the body­gu­ards, who we­re ke­eping you and Kyndreth un­der sur­ve­il­lan­ce," Lydi­ell told him calmly. "And so­me of our pe­op­le we­re in turn watc­hing them. It ma­de me won­der how many la­yers of watc­hers-watc­hing-watc­hers we co­uld ha­ve had be­fo­re pe­op­le be­gan run­ning in­to each ot­her!"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian tur­ned away from the win­dow, and ca­ught his mot­her's iro­nic smi­le. "It wo­uld be an in­te­res­ting ex­pe­ri­ment.</p>
   <p>    That hu­man Ka­eth is a very sharp fel­low; I ha­ve no do­ubt that he knew his pe­op­le we­re be­ing over­lo­oked. I sho­uldn't li­ke to ha­ve to pit Gel aga­inst him; I think that Gel might be out­matc­hed in cer­ta­in are­as."</p>
   <p>    "Then let us ho­pe we ne­ver ne­ed to." Lydi­ell lo­oked at him sharply. "What is it that you ha­ve not told me? So­met­hing Kyn-dreth sa­id?"</p>
   <p>    "Something he has yet to say," Kyrti­an sig­hed, chag­ri­ned that she was ab­le to re­ad him so easily. I sho­uld know bet­ter than to think I can hi­de anyt­hing from her. "He le­ar­ned the ma­gic qu­ite qu­ickly; ac­tu­al­ly mo­re qu­ickly than I had an­ti­ci­pa­ted. Wha­te­ver el­se his ac­comp­lish­ments may be, the­re is no do­ubt that he de­ser­ves his po­si­ti­on as a ma­ge and a Gre­at Lord."</p>
   <p>    "Do not at­tempt to dist­ract me; I am too old to play that ga­me with," Lydi­ell res­pon­ded, a to­uch sharply. "What was this abo­ut 'so­met­hing he has yet to say'?"</p>
   <p>    "He imp­li­ed that he wis­hes to dis­cuss so­met­hing with me, pos­sibly at or af­ter din­ner. 1 ha­ve no idea what it is." Kyrti­an tri­ed to shrug it all off as of no im­por­tan­ce, but his mot­her im­me­di­ately lo­oked con­cer­ned, then tri­ed to con­ce­al it.</p>
   <p>    "Did he say anyt­hing el­se?" she as­ked, a lit­tle too ca­su­al­ly.</p>
   <p>    "One thing mo­re-that he and his pe­op­le will be le­aving in the mor­ning, which is not too so­on for me." Fe­eling overly con­fi­ned by the re­la­ti­vely for­mal gar­ments he'd be­en but­to­ned in­to this mor­ning, Kyrti­an ru­ined the ef­forts of his body-ser­vants by rest­les­sly un­but­to­ning the col­lar of his tu­nic and run­ning his hands dist­rac­tedly thro­ugh his ha­ir.</p>
   <p>    "At le­ast that is go­od news." Lady Lydi­ell sank in­to her se­at be­hind her desk. "I knew this cha­ra­de of ours wo­uld be a stra­in, but I hadn't ex­pec­ted it to be as much of a stra­in as it has be­en."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian nod­ded in ag­re­ement, and to­ok a qu­ick glan­ce back at the win­dow. The tiny fi­gu­res we­re no lon­ger so tiny and we­re gro­wing lar­ger by the mo­ment-the ri­ders must ha­ve de­ci­ded that they had exer­ci­sed eno­ugh for one day. Eit­her that, or Kyn-dreth sent a ma­gi­cal sum­mons to them. "If I am go­ing to con­ti­nue the ga­me, I had best get down to my qu­ar­ters to dress for din­ner, Lady-Mot­her. Sin­ce this is to be Lord Kyndreth's last night-sho­uldn't we do so­met­hing-well-ela­bo­ra­te?"</p>
   <p>    "Indeed we sho­uld, and I will fol­low yo­ur examp­le as so­on as I've se­en the co­oks." She ro­se from her cha­ir and mo­ved aro­und her desk to kiss him fondly on the che­ek. "We must show him every pos­sib­le ho­nor. We ne­ed to dri­ve it ho­me to Lord Kyn-dreth that we are rec­lu­si­ve, but ne­it­her mad, nor bar­ba­ric."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian was temp­ted to bre­ak his long-stan­ding ha­bit and use il­lu­si­on to aug­ment his cos­tu­me, for the clot­hing his ser­vants la­id out for him was not the sort of thing he wo­uld ha­ve cho­sen for him­self. It was imp­res­si­ve, yes, but the plush vel­vet tu­nic of a so­ber mid­night-blue was so he­avily or­na­men­ted with gold bul­li­on and tiny be­ads ma­de from sap­phi­res and eme­ralds that it we­ig­hed as much as ar­mor, and the high col­lar was pro­bably go­ing to dri­ve him to dist­rac­ti­on be­fo­re the eve­ning was over and he co­uld ta­ke it off.</p>
   <p>    Nevertheless, he al­lo­wed his men to as­sist him in­to the stiff cos­tu­me, and ma­de his ap­pe­aran­ce in the grand di­ning ro­om well ahe­ad of the­ir gu­est. So­me­how Lady Lydi­ell had wor­ked mi­rac­les among the co­oks, for the­re was every evi­den­ce of a me­al worthy of the ro­om in the of­fing. The tab­le, dec­ked in snowy da­mask, was ador­ned with a do­zen dif­fe­rent glas­ses at each pla­ce, and the si­de­bo­ard was la­den with small dis­hes and a myri­ad of spe­ci­ali­zed kni­ves, forks and spo­ons, each (by the ru­les of eti­qu­et­te) su­ited only to very par­ti­cu­lar sorts of co­ur­ses. Al­so by the ru­les of eti­qu­et­te, the­re was only a sing­le pla­te and no uten­sils at each pla­ce. The par­ti­cu­lar sil­ver­wa­re ne­eded for each co­ur­se wo­uld be la­id with the co­ur­se, and whis­ked away aga­in to pre­vent any fa­ux pas in di­ning on the part of a gu­est. When Lord Kyndreth and his three un­der­lings ap­pe­ared, con­duc­ted by a ho­use­hold ser­vant, even they se­emed surp­ri­sed and imp­res­sed by the pre­pa­ra­ti­ons.</p>
   <p>    Lydiell ar­ri­ved last, in a gown of de­cep­ti­ve simp­li­city, one that Kyrti­an had ne­ver se­en her we­ar be­fo­re. It was only when she drew ne­ar that it was ob­vi­o­us that only the "cut" of the gown was simp­le; with clo­se-fit­ting sle­eves and a mo­dest neck­li­ne, it was com­po­sed en­ti­rely of mi­ni­atu­re in­ter­wo­ven links and pla­qu­es of sil­ver, each no lar­ger than a gnat, each pla­que stud­ded with di­amonds no lar­ger than the he­ad of a pin. She seemed to be gow­ned in shim­me­ring fish-sca­les, or that fa­bu­lo­us subs­tan­ce, dra­gon skin.</p>
   <p>    And I tho­ught my cos­tu­me was un­com­for­tably he­avy! he tho­ught in awe. He'd had no idea she even pos­ses­sed such a thing; it co­uldn't be il­lu­si­on, but whe­re had it co­me from?</p>
   <p>    I won­der if it co­uld turn a bla­de? he tho­ught, as he wa­ited for Lydi­ell to be se­ated. The­re was no tel­ling how old such a gar­ment might be-it might even da­te back to Eve­lon it­self. If so… per­haps the la­di­es of tho­se long-go­ne days had ma­de a vir­tue of the ne­ces­sity of we­aring pro­tec­ti­ve ar­mor even to a fes­ti­ve me­al.</p>
   <p>    They to­ok the­ir pla­ces, and the ce­re­mo­ni­al me­al be­gan, co­ur­se af­ter co­ur­se, un­til Kyrti­an lost co­unt of them. Each co­ur­se was no mo­re than a tas­te, a bi­te or two of so­me de­li­cacy; then the pla­tes and cut­lery we­re whis­ked away to be rep­la­ced by a new set­ting, anot­her dish. Cold dis­hes and hot, sa­vory, salty, swe­et, so­ur-frag­rant no­od­les, lightly co­oked and se­aso­ned ve­ge­tab­les sculp­ted li­ke flo­wers, flo­wers ma­de in­to tiny sa­lads of pe­tals, tiny por­ti­ons of ba­rely se­ared me­at gar­nis­hed with ra­re herbs and sa­uces, so­ups hot and chil­led-each co­ur­se was ac­com­pa­ni­ed with a dif­fe­rent drink. This was not al­ways wi­ne; it co­uld be a spi­ced ju­ice, a tea, or de­li­ca­tely fla­vo­red spring wa­ter, wha­te­ver best comp­le­men­ted the co­ur­se.</p>
   <p>    It co­uld not be cal­led a me­al, it was an event un­to it­self, a thing which swiftly ac­qu­ired its own mo­men­tum. If Kyrti­an was ama­zed, Lord Kyndreth was not-altho­ugh it se­emed he was very, very ple­ased. Ho­urs pas­sed, the sun­set fa­ded out­si­de the win­dows and was rep­la­ced by the night and stars; Kyndreth and his pe­op­le exer­ted them­sel­ves to be char­ming, and Lady Lydi­ell was equ­al­ly char­ming and witty. Kyrti­an was awed; he'd ne­ver se­en his mot­her qu­ite li­ke this be­fo­re, and he had to stretch his own wits to ke­ep pa­ce with the ot­hers.</p>
   <p>    Finally, the last co­ur­se was pla­ced be­fo­re them-and the fact that it was the fi­nal co­ur­se was sig­na­led by the di­sap­pe­aran­ce of every hu­man ser­vant the mo­ment each pla­te was pla­ced be­fo­re the di­ners. Each pla­te held a sing­le de­li­ca­te, gil­ded fru­it-ice the si­ze of Lydi­ell's gra­ce­ful hand. Each sco­op of ice had be­en molded in­to the Li­on of Lord Kyndreth's Ho­use, with the de­ta­ils pic­ked out in su­gar-crystals and pe­ar­les­cent icing.</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth sto­od up, and ra­ised his cup to Lady Lydi­ell.</p>
   <p>    "My de­ar hos­tess," he sa­id, in a vo­ice full of warmth and ad­mi­ra­ti­on. "I can­not ima­gi­ne how you co­nj­ured up a Co­urt fe­ast on less than no no­ti­ce, but al­low me to dec­la­re that you are su­rely the equ­al of any Gre­at Ma­ge in the land, and I bow to yo­ur pro­wess. I drink to you, Lady Lydi­ell!"</p>
   <p>    The rest ans­we­red his to­ast, and Lydi­ell gra­ce­ful­ly ack­now­led­ged the comp­li­ment with a nod of her he­ad.</p>
   <p>    Kyndreth sat down aga­in. "I can see by all of this that my judg­ment of yo­ur Ho­use was not mis­ta­ken. If you do not mo­ve in the circ­les of the Co­un­cil, it is not be­ca­use you do not me­rit such at­ten­ti­on, but be­ca­use you cho­se not to se­ek it."</p>
   <p>    He lo­oked from Lydi­ell to Kyrti­an, and back aga­in. It was Lydi­ell he evi­dently ex­pec­ted to ans­wer, and it was Lydi­ell who ma­de the reply.</p>
   <p>    "My Lord Kyndreth, our fa­mily has long pre­fer­red to ke­ep our own com­pany, and li­ve qu­i­etly and even rec­lu­si­vely," Lydi­ell mur­mu­red. "It is not out of un­se­emly pri­de, I beg to ur­ge, but out of mo­desty and a ge­nu­ine pre­fe­ren­ce for a qu­i­et and rec­lu­si­ve li­fe. All of us-my la­te hus­band, his fat­her be­fo­re him, and my son as well as myself-are mo­re of the tem­pe­ra­ment of a scho­lar than of a co­ur­ti­er, and the li­fe of a se­eming her­mit su­its us well. Per­haps our ne­eds and ple­asu­res may se­em simp­le to you, but we find that they sa­tisfy every wish and de­si­re we ha­ve, for our wis­hes and de­si­res are for the in­ner world of tho­ught, rat­her than the outer world, which ot­hers might find sti­mu­la­ting, but we find con­ten­ti­o­us and dis­tur­bing."</p>
   <p>    Kyndreth sig­hed, a bit me­lod­ra­ma­ti­cal­ly, per­haps. "And I wish that you co­uld con­ti­nue to enj­oy that qu­i­et li­fe, my Lady, but the ti­mes, I fe­ar, will not per­mit yo­ur mo­desty to deny the ge­nu­ine ta­lents that lie hid­den in this lit­tle ha­ven of yo­urs."</p>
   <p>    Now he tur­ned to Kyrti­an. "Lord Kyrti­an, I do not ha­ve to tell you what yo­ur re­pu­ta­ti­on is among the ig­no­rant; you ha­ve he­ard it al­re­ady from the mo­uth of yo­ur kins­man, Ael­mar­kin. I was pre­pa­red to dis­co­unt that re­pu­ta­ti­on when I ac­cep­ted yo­ur invitation, but now I find that yo­ur kins­man was not only in­cor­rect, he was-" Kyndreth sho­ok his he­ad. "Words fa­il me. Ael-mar­kin is eit­her po­iso­no­usly pre­j­udi­ced aga­inst you, or comp­le­tely blind. I ha­ve se­en and he­ard eno­ugh in two days to con­vin­ce me that, des­pi­te yo­ur own disc­la­imers, you, Lord Kyrti­an, are not­hing short of a mi­li­tary ge­ni­us. This is no me­re ec­cent­ric hobby that you ha­ve, it is a ge­nu­ine vo­ca­ti­on."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian ope­ned his mo­uth to pro­test, but Kyndreth si­len­ced him with a wa­ve of his hand.</p>
   <p>    "You ha­ve, with no help ot­her than that of so­me an­ci­ent ma­nusc­ripts, un­co­ve­red a tra­ining met­hod that cre­ates ex­pert figh­ters in a frac­ti­on of the ti­me we ha­ve ta­ken he­re­to­fo­re and as you yo­ur­self po­in­ted out, with no­ne of the cri­mi­nal was­ta­ge that our met­hod en­ta­ils. I ha­ve se­en yo­ur stra­te­gic abi­lity in ac­ti­on, I ha­ve se­en yo­ur ca­re­ful at­ten­ti­on to every as­pect of mi­li­tary li­fe. Lord Kyrti­an, you can­not re­ma­in a her­mit any lon­ger; you are des­pe­ra­tely ne­eded. The High Co­un­cil ne­eds you."</p>
   <p>    "I-cannot ima­gi­ne why you wo­uld think that," Kyrti­an stam­me­red, ta­ken comp­le­tely by surp­ri­se. "You al­re­ady hold the key to the tra­ining-ma­gic, and you are a gre­ater ma­ge than I-"</p>
   <p>    "We ne­ed yo­ur mi­li­tary know­led­ge," Kyndreth in­sis­ted. "Bet­we­en the wars with the Wi­zards and the re­volt of our own ung­ra­te­ful of­fsp­ring, the­re are pre­ci­o­us few with the wis­dom and know­led­ge to com­mand, and no­ne with yo­ur ta­lent. We ne­ed you, Lord Kyrti­an. We ne­ed you to le­ad our ar­mi­es."</p>
   <p>    Out of the cor­ner of his eye, Kyrti­an saw his mot­her ten­se, and re­ali­zed that alt­ho­ugh he had not an­ti­ci­pa­ted this de­mand, she had.</p>
   <p>    "You al­re­ady ha­ve le­aders," he pro­tes­ted. "Le­aders of hig­her rank than 1.1 wo­uld not da­re-"</p>
   <p>    "With my bac­king, no one wo­uld da­re dis­pu­te you" Kyndreth co­un­te­red, grimly. "With my bac­king, I can easily per­su­ade every Co­un­ci­lor that mat­ters that you are the only pos­sib­le Com­man­ding Ge­ne­ral for our for­ces."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian was dumb­fo­un­ded; he had ho­ped that Kyndreth's gra­ti­tu­de wo­uld bring them a res­pi­te from Ael­mar­kin's en­mity, but he had not ex­pec­ted Kyndreth to pro­po­se he ta­ke his pla­ce among the Gre­atest of the Gre­at Lords!</p>
   <p>    "Lord Kyndreth, ple­ase do not think me ung­ra­te­ful-rat­her, I am stun­ned," he ma­na­ged. "And su­rely you re­ali­ze that I ha­ve no prac­ti­cal ex­pe­ri­en­ce!"</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth ra­ised his eyeb­row. "All the prac­ti­cal ex­pe­ri­en­ce of our cur­rent Com­man­der has ava­iled him not­hing," he po­in­ted out. "The si­tu­ati­on with our yo­ung re­bels has be­en in sta­le­ma­te for the last month and mo­re." He pa­used. "And that is to go no furt­her than this tab­le; only the mem­bers of the Co­un­cil are awa­re of it."</p>
   <p>    "Stalemate-" Kyrti­an bit his lip. "How much ter­ri­tory are they hol­ding?"</p>
   <p>    "Roughly half of the es­ta­tes are in the hands of the re­bels," Kyndreth rep­li­ed. "We are for­tu­na­te that no­ne of them are vi­tal to the eco­nomy-they we­re mostly es­ta­tes pro­du­cing lit­tle ex­cept sla­ves and lu­xu­ri­es. Ne­vert­he­less, that is a gre­at de­al of ter­ri­tory to be in unf­ri­endly hands-and the­re are iso­la­ted es­ta­tes wit­hin that ter­ri­tory that are still in the hands of our pe­op­le, lo­yal folk who ne­ed and de­ser­ve suc­cor." Now he lo­oked shrewdly at Lydi­ell. "Unless I am very much mis­ta­ken, one of tho­se is the es­ta­te of Lady Mort­he­na, yo­ur kins­wo­man."</p>
   <p>    "Lady Moth?" Lydi­ell pa­led. Kyrti­an bit his lip. Gran­ted, Lady Moth had cons­pi­cu­o­usly not ta­ken si­des, and if the re­bels had tro­ub­led her, Lydi­ell cer­ta­inly wo­uld ha­ve he­ard abo­ut it by now. Still, she might be pre­su­med to be in dan­ger.</p>
   <p>    "Lady Mort­he­na is en­circ­led and cer­ta­inly trap­ped," Kyndreth con­ti­nu­ed, his eyes nic­king from Lydi­ell to Kyrti­an. "As yet, she has held cont­rol over her sla­ves, so that she has pre­ven­ted any in­cur­si­ons on­to her lands. As yet, the re­bels ha­ve not at­temp­ted any se­ri­o­us ef­fort at cap­tu­ring her. But how long will it be un­til they see her as a va­lu­ab­le bar­ga­ining to­ol? She is a Gre­at Lady; the ho­nor of the High Lords and the Co­un­cil wo­uld be comp­ro­mi­sed if she we­re to be cap­tu­red and held aga­inst her will. We wo­uld eit­her be for­ced to aban­don her- which is unt­hin­kab­le-or ma­ke con­ces­si­ons to the re­bels- which is al­so unt­hin­kab­le."</p>
   <p>    It is all unt­hin­kab­le. Kyrti­an grit­ted his te­eth. Kyndreth eit­her knew or gu­es­sed that he wo­uld be ext­re­mely lo­yal to tho­se mem­bers of his fa­mily-unli­ke Ael­mar­kin-who de­ser­ved loyalty. He had known that Lady Moth was clo­se to the ter­ri­tory held by the re­bels, for she her­self had told them. The Yo­ung Lords co­uld not block te­le­son mes­sa­ges, and did not even try; so far Lady Moth had se­emed en­ti­rely un­con­cer­ned abo­ut her po­si­ti­on in the midst of the Yo­ung Lords, even pro­fes­sing to a cer­ta­in de­tac­hed sympathy for the­ir ca­use. But Lord Kyndreth was right; if the Yo­ung Lords ca­red to, they co­uld ta­ke Lady Moth cap­ti­ve to use her as a bar­ga­ining-chip. A qu­ick glan­ce at Lydi­elFs fa­ce told him all he ne­eded to know; this was no id­le spe­cu­la­ti­on, but a re­al pos­si­bi­lity.</p>
   <p>    "You must gi­ve me ti­me to con­si­der all you ha­ve sa­id, Lord Kyndreth," he ma­na­ged, fi­nal­ly. "I am-stun­ned. I ne­ed ti­me to sha­ke my tho­ughts lo­ose."</p>
   <p>    "I can sympat­hi­ze," Kyndreth sa­id gra­vely, but the­re was a smi­le of sa­tis­fac­ti­on in his eyes. He al­re­ady knew that Kyrti­an wo­uld ag­ree, just as Kyrti­an al­re­ady knew he must ag­ree. It was only a mat­ter of ti­me, and ti­me was not his fri­end.</p>

   <p>    Lord Kyndreth re­ti­red to his gu­est-su­ite and the com­pe­tent hands of his body-sla­ves with a fe­eling of to­tal con­tent-ment. Not only had he just sa­vo­red the ple­asu­re of enj­oying an ex­qu­isi­tely pre­pa­red, pre­sen­ted, and ser­ved High Co­urt fe­ast, but he was per­fectly well awa­re that he was abo­ut to ac­qu­ire a most use­ful ad­he­rent. He had se­en yo­ung Kyrti­an's re­ac­ti­on to the do­ub­le temp­ta­ti­ons of po­wer and the op­por­tu­nity to play the he­ro. He had al­so no­ted Lady Lydi­ell's. The boy might be na­ive, but his mot­her was no fo­ol, and she knew that the Gre­at Lord and High Co­un­ci­lor Lord Kyndreth wo­uld not ha­ve ma­de tho­se of­fers if it was pos­sib­le to re­fu­se them.</p>
   <p>    She al­so knows that wit­ho­ut my pat­ro­na­ge that co­usin of the­irs will con­ti­nue to be a thorn in the­ir si­des, at the very le­ast, and might well find a pat­ron po­wer­ful eno­ugh that he can ta­ke everyt­hing from them, he tho­ught with sa­tis­fac­ti­on. She re­ad that imp­li­cit thre­at cle­arly eno­ugh.</p>
   <p>    He'd men­ti­oned Ael­mar­kin for just that re­ason. In this par­ti­cu­lar ga­me of ho­unds-and-ali­corns, Lord Kyndreth had her­ded the ho­unds in­to exactly the po­si­ti­ons he wan­ted them.</p>
   <p>    His sla­ves und­res­sed him and he slip­ped in­to the silk lo­un­ging-ro­be one of them held out for him. As al­ways, his body­gu­ard Ka­eth was in unobt­ru­si­ve at­ten­dan­ce, and when the last sla­ve left the ro­om, Ka­eth re­ma­ined, a fa­ith­ful sha­dow, to be ig­no­red-or not. Ka­eth was equ­al­ly re­cep­ti­ve to eit­her con­di­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Kaeth's tra­ining must ha­ve be­en im­pec­cab­le; Lord Kyndreth only wis­hed that he co­uld ha­ve got­ten Ka­eth's tra­iners along with the body­gu­ard. When the sla­ve grew too old to ser­ve, it wo­uld be dif­fi­cult to rep­la­ce him, and it wo­uld by ne­ces­sity be with an in­fe­ri­or spe­ci­men.</p>
   <p>    Kyndreth tur­ned his back on his body­gu­ard and to­ok a se­at be­si­de an il­lu­sory fi­re bur­ning in the very re­al marb­le fi­rep­la­ce-one of the few il­lu­si­ons in this su­ite. The fla­mes dan­ced with ra­in­bow co­lors, and as the fi­re "bur­ned," it ga­ve off a ple­asant scent of ce­dar and alo­es-wo­od, but no he­at.</p>
   <p>    "Well, Ka­eth," Kyndreth sa­id to the fi­re, "the boy will ta­ke the ba­it, I've no do­ubt. He do­esn't da­re re­fu­se it."</p>
   <p>    "True, my Lord." As al­ways, Ka­eth was as eco­no­mi­cal with words as with everyt­hing el­se. "He'll ac­cept by mor­ning, I ex­pect."</p>
   <p>    "He's as go­od as I think." That was a sta­te­ment; Kyndreth didn't ex­pect Ka­eth to di­sag­ree. "The boy is go­ing to bre­ak the de­ad­lock for us. The only re­ason Ael­mar­kin ma­na­ged to con­vin­ce ever­yo­ne that he was half-mad was be­ca­use he sta­yed me­wed up he­re. An­yo­ne who had bot­he­red to talk with him for mo­re than half an ho­ur wo­uld ha­ve known he was sa­ne-and bril­li­ant. If he'd be­en out in so­ci­ety, Ael­mar­kin wo­uldn't ha­ve had a chan­ce of ma­king a la­ug­hing-stock out of him."</p>
   <p>    "He is bet­ter than you think, my Lord."</p>
   <p>    Astonished, Lord Kyndreth swi­ve­led his he­ad to lo­ok at his nor­mal­ly la­co­nic body­gu­ard. "Inde­ed?" he ma­na­ged. By the An­ces­tors, I can't re­mem­ber the last ti­me Ka­eth vo­lun­te­ered a comment, much less an opi­ni­on! This yo­ungs­ter must be so­met­hing truly out of the or­di­nary!</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ve exa­mi­ned his lib­rary, his stra­tegy-ro­om, and so­me of his own wri­tings, my lord. I al­so watc­hed his men when he com­man­ded them. It is one thing to com­mand men; it is anot­her to le­ad them. Lord Kyrti­an is a le­ader. Men may not al­ways obey a com­man­der-or at le­ast, they may only obey the let­ter of his com­mands, but not exert them­sel­ves be­yond that-but they will al­ways fol­low a le­ader." Ka­eth's un­re­adab­le exp­res­si­on did not chan­ge by so much as a ha­ir, but Lord Kyndreth fan­ci­ed he'd he­ard the fa­in­test hint of ap­pro­val in the body­gu­ard's vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    Interesting. Very in­te­res­ting.</p>
   <p>    He tur­ned back to the fi­re. It wo­uldn't do to gi­ve Ka­eth too much di­rect at­ten­ti­on. The sla­ve was in­tel­li­gent, highly in­tel­li­gent, and Kyndreth ne­eded to be very ca­re­ful how he hand­led the man. Too much at­ten­ti­on might gi­ve him a sen­se of self-impor­tan­ce that co­uld af­fect his use­ful­ness. "All the mo­re re­ason to put him in char­ge of the army. Half the ti­me Lord Le­ve­lis has to dri­ve the tro­ops in­to ac­ti­on with pa­in and pu­nish­ment. If the tro­ops had so­me ot­her mo­ti­va­ti­on, that alo­ne might en­su­re our vic­tory."</p>
   <p>    "Lord Le­ve­lis," ca­me the surp­ri­sing reply, "will be mor­tal­ly of­fen­ded by be­ing rep­la­ced by a-Les­ser Lord."</p>
   <p>    Again, Ka­eth had vo­lun­te­ered an ob­ser­va­ti­on. Lord Kyrti­an must ha­ve imp­res­sed the man so much that Ka­eth's ca­re­ful self-cont­rol was crac­king a trif­le. Kyndreth la­ug­hed mirth­les­sly. "By an ec­cent­ric no­body, you me­an, but of co­ur­se can­not say. If his de­ar co­usin is to be be­li­eved, a half-mad no­body. Lord Le­ve­lis will ha­ve to sur­vi­ve be­ing of­fen­ded; he has do­ne not­hing to en­de­ar him­self to me, he has bung­led every at­tempt at put­ting down the re­bels, and he is not one of my ad­he­rents. I can af­ford to of­fend him; let his pat­ron find a way to con­so­le him."</p>
   <p>    There was no reply; the hu­man re­al­ly co­uldn't reply to the sta­te­ments wit­ho­ut be­ing in­so­lent, and Lord Kyndreth wo­uld not to­le­ra­te in­so­len­ce, even from a sla­ve as trus­ted as his body­gu­ard.</p>
   <p>    "The boy's po­si­ti­on will be sa­fe eno­ugh when it is cle­ar that I am his pat­ron," Kyndreth con­ti­nu­ed for Ka­eth's be­ne­fit. "I could ha­ve him ins­tal­led to­mor­row, if I cho­se. Le­ve­lis has bung­led too many ti­mes, and he will not da­re mo­ve aga­inst me or an­yo­ne I cho­ose to rep­la­ce him with."</p>
   <p>    "Perhaps not aga­inst you-but out on the bat­tle­fi­eld, Lord Kyrti­an will no lon­ger be un­der yo­ur di­rect su­per­vi­si­on or pro­tec­ti­on. Lord Le­ve­lis may mo­ve aga­inst him the­re; my Lord, the bat­tle­fi­eld is a chan­ce-rid­den pla­ce, and ac­ci­dents do hap­pen to even the most ca­re­ful."</p>
   <p>    Well, well! I do be­li­eve that is anot­her opi­ni­on!</p>
   <p>    Kyndreth co­uld not re­sist the temp­ta­ti­on to see what el­se he co­uld draw out of Ka­eth-furt­her ob­ser­va­ti­ons, even sug­ges­ti­ons? This was mo­re than the body­gu­ard had shown of him­self in ye­ars!</p>
   <p>    "Perhaps I sho­uld send you to watch out for his wel­fa­re," he half-jes­ted.</p>
   <p>    "I will do wha­te­ver you di­rect, my Lord," ca­me the exp­res­si­on­less reply, and Kyndreth sig­hed with di­sap­po­int­ment. Ka­eth had re­ve­aled all that he was go­ing to-and pro­bably wo­uld not ven­tu­re so much as a bland com­ment for the next ye­ar.</p>
   <p>    Kyndreth had no in­ten­ti­on of as­sig­ning Ka­eth-who was far too va­lu­ab­le whe­re he was-to the task of se­e­ing to Kyrti­an's well-be­ing. The boy will eit­her be ab­le to pro­tect him­self, or not. And if he can­not, then he do­es not de­ser­ve my pat­ro­na­ge. The­re was that body­gu­ard of his own, af­ter all-a man who had co­me very clo­se to de­fe­ating Ka­eth in com­bat. Ha­ving that par­ti­cu­lar sla­ve in his tra­in sho­wed a cer­ta­in amo­unt of self-pre­ser­ving sen­se.</p>
   <p>    Levelis wo­uldn't be ab­le to eli­mi­na­te him un­til af­ter he'd bro­ken the sta­le­ma­te, any­way, and by then the re­al work wo­uld be do­ne, and Le­ve­lis co­uld ha­ve his old po­si­ti­on back if he re­al­ly wan­ted it. By that po­int, Kyndreth wo­uld ha­ve what he wan­ted; cre­dit for bre­aking the backs of the re­bels, and when the re­bels we­re de­fe­ated, Kyrti­an wo­uld be--expendable. Still use­ful, per­haps, but ex­pen­dab­le.</p>
   <p>    Gel had sto­od si­lent watch thro­ug­ho­ut the long me­al, lis­te­ning to the con­ver­sa­ti­on with a fa­ce as im­pas­si­ve as that of the body­gu­ard Ka­eth-and when the ser­vants va­nis­hed he did the sa­me.</p>
   <p>    But he didn't go far. Li­ke every pub­lic ro­om in this ma­nor, the­re was a spy-ho­le whe­re a trus­ted con­fe­de­ra­te co­uld lis­ten to the El­ven­lords when they tho­ught they we­re spe­aking among them­sel­ves.</p>
   <p>    He didn't trust Lord Kyndreth. No mat­ter how that par­ti­cu­lar El­ven­lord ac­ted, he wo­uld ne­ver do anyt­hing that wasn't in his own in­te­rest; so­lely and comp­le­tely in his own in­te­rest. He might lull ot­hers in­to be­li­eving that he ac­ted out of-say- fri­ends­hip, or even the alt­ru­is­tic wish to do so­me­one who might de­ser­ve help a fa­vor, but the­re wo­uld al­ways be a hid­den re­ason for such ac­ti­ons, and eit­her a la­ter cost, or a cur­rent be­ne­fit.</p>
   <p>    It was mo­de­ra­tely in­te­res­ting to he­ar Kyndreth spe­aking so openly in front of, and to, his body­gu­ard Ka­eth. It wasn't un­he­ard of or out-of-cha­rac­ter, tho­ugh; af­ter all, what was the use of ha­ving a ful­ly-tra­ined and in­tel­li­gent body­gu­ard if you didn't ma­ke use of all of his skills?</p>
   <p>    The spy-ho­le was a cle­ver lit­tle const­ruc­ti­on, bu­ilt whe­re the chim­ney wo­uld ha­ve ac­tu­al­ly be­en had the fi­rep­la­ce be­en re­al and func­ti­onal. The­re was eno­ugh ro­om to sit com­for­tably with one ear to the wall, fo­re­he­ad res­ting aga­inst a pad­ded pro­j­ec­ti­on, in the ut­ter dark­ness-not a sing­le pe­ep-ho­le, not even a thin lit­tle crack to bet­ray the pos­sib­le pre­sen­ce of a spy he­re.</p>
   <p>    So, the cur­rent com­man­der is go­ing to be an enemy. That was no surp­ri­se, tho­ugh it was a go­od thing to ha­ve the man's na­me. Te­neb­rinth co­uld put so­me ti­me in­to in­ves­ti­ga­ting the fel­low. It might well be pos­sib­le to com­pen­sa­te him in so­me way for the loss of his im­por­tant post.</p>
   <p>    It might be pos­sib­le to pla­ca­te him with no mo­re than a simp­le vi­sit. Kyrti­an plays the humb­le so­ul very well.</p>
   <p>    The mur­mur of vo­ices in the ot­her ro­om con­ti­nu­ed, and he stra­ined to he­ar every nu­an­ce, wis­hing he al­so had so­me way to re­ad Lord Kyndreth's tho­ughts.</p>
   <p>    The cur­rent com­man­der isn't Kyndreth's? That's go­od to know; Kyndreth pro­bably knows next to not­hing abo­ut him, and if Ka­eth do­es, he's only sa­id that the fel­low is go­ing to be in­sul­ted. Well, in­sults can be ne­ga­ted with a pur­ging do­se of hu­mi­lity. If Kyrti­an pa­id an im­me­di­ate call on Le­ve­lis, af­ter accepting the ap­po­int­ment but be­fo­re it be­ca­me ge­ne­ral­ly known, and gro­ve­led…</p>
   <p>    Must ask Te­neb­rinth. That can be a two-edged sword.</p>
   <p>    Assuming that the cur­rent com­man­der co­uld not be pla­ca­ted or bo­ught off, the­re was a pos­si­bi­lity that Le­ve­lis wo­uld re­vert to the an­ci­ent ways of Eve­lon. The El­ven­lord was not li­kely to act openly-after the disp­lay at the chal­len­ge-du­el hos­ted by Ael­mar­kin, no one was go­ing to is­sue a chal­len­ge that they knew they we­re go­ing to lo­se. A chal­len­ge to a du­el-by-ma­gic was pos­sib­le, and the­re we­re se­ve­ral po­ten­ti­al ways of de­aling with it. Kyndreth and the Co­un­cil co­uld for­bid it. Kyrti­an co­uld ac­cept and the du­el co­uld go on, and he co­uld eit­her win or lo­se-and in eit­her ca­se, Gel wo­uld ha­ve to be cer­ta­in that the sta­kes we­ren't too high to lo­se. What is the li­mit on sta­kes in the­se things? Must ask Te­neb­rinth. If it's pretty much a to­ken, it might pay Kyrti­an to lo­se any­way.</p>
   <p>    But if the Co­un­cil for­ba­de a du­el al­to­get­her on the gro­unds that the chal­len­ge was spe­ci­o­us and ma­de pu­rely out of pi­que, Le­ve­lis co­uld de­ci­de to ta­ke mat­ters in­to his own hands. That left the pos­si­bi­lity-if Le­ve­lis had or co­uld purc­ha­se a pro­perly-tra­ined sla­ve-of as­sas­si­na­ti­on. He wis­hed very strongly that he had Ka­eth at his dis­po­sal abo­ut now-an as­sas­sin wo­uld be the best pos­sib­le ex­pert at spot­ting anot­her.</p>
   <p>    But he didn't. And I spot­ted Ka­eth, so I sup­po­se I co­uld spot anot­her. Pro­vi­ded he was ope­ra­ting in the open, and not ma­king an at­tempt at sni­ping from a dis­tan­ce. Damn. He ma­de anot­her no­te; ma­ke su­re that Kyrti­an's tent and per­son we­re al­ways out of bow shot of any co­ver. Fi­ne, pro­vi­ded that the cur­rent bat­tle­fi­eld si­te wasn't in the mid­dle of a fo­rest.</p>
   <p>    But he knew that the­re was no use in trying to per­su­ade Kyrti­an not to go; he didn't even con­si­der the op­ti­on. It was too dan­ge­ro­us to try and dec­li­ne the in­vi­ta­ti­on, at le­ast in the short-term. So long as Kyndreth was Kyrti­an's spon­sor, Ael­mar­kin wo­uld ke­ep his dis­tan­ce.</p>
   <p>    Damn them all for a nest of twisty sna­kes, any­way! Why co­uldn't an­yo­ne among the­se po­inty-eared bas­tards ever do anyt­hing in a stra­ight­for­ward man­ner?</p>
   <p>    But the su­bj­ect had chan­ged, and Gel sho­ved his ear even tigh­ter aga­inst the wall, ho­ping for mo­re in­sights.</p>
   <p>    Kara and Gi­an­na we­re fus­sing with the­ir clot­hing aga­in, ho­ping for a se­cond vi­sit from the Gre­at Lord and a se­cond pre­sent of jewels, no do­ubt. What go­od jewels we­re, with only the­ir mas­ter to see them, Ren­na­ti had no idea. Ren­na­ti sig­hed, but qu­i­etly; Ka­ra had go­ne thro­ugh three chan­ges of cos­tu­me al­re­ady, and still she wasn't sa­tis­fi­ed with the imp­res­si­on she was go­ing to ma­ke.</p>
   <p>    She lo­oked back at the win­dow; a doe and fawn ap­pe­ared at the very ed­ge of the lawn, but qu­ickly dar­ted back out of vi­ew be­fo­re she got mo­re than a glimp­se of them.</p>
   <p>    I wo­uld li­ke a fawn, mo­re than jewels. Or a kit­ten of my own, li­ke the one that slip­ped in when we first ca­me he­re. Any kind of pet. Ka­ra and Gi­an­na wo­uldn't want to sha­re the ha­rem with an ani­mal, tho­ugh.</p>
   <p>    Kara tri­ed anot­her gown, and re­j­ec­ted it im­me­di­ately-not that the­re was anyt­hing wrong with it, but be­ca­use she had worn it two days ago.</p>
   <p>    Well, may­be Lady Lydi­ell sho­uldn 't ha­ve gi­ven us such ex­ten­si­ve ward­ro­bes when she bo­ught us and ins­tal­led us he­re, Ren­na­ti tho­ught. Half of all this cos­tu­me-chan­ging is only be­ca­use Ka­ra's got an ex­cu­se to try on everyt­hing in her clo­set.</p>
   <p>    Kara and Gi­an­na twit­te­red at each ot­her; what did Ren­na­ti ne­ed with a bird when she had them? "The black," she sa­id, in the first ava­ilab­le mo­ment of si­len­ce. "We­ar the black. It's at the right end of the clo­set."</p>
   <p>    Two he­ads swi­ve­led on two swan-li­ke necks to pe­er in her di­rec­ti­on, both sets of eyes, blue and brown, equ­al­ly un­cer­ta­in. "Black?" Ka­ra sa­id do­ubt­ful­ly. "But-" she shud­de­red. "He'll think-"</p>
   <p>    "Black's not for mo­ur­ning, not with them," Ren­na­ti sa­id, an­ti­ci­pa­ting Ka­ra's obj­ec­ti­on. "I know it's not a co­lor you usu­al­ly we­ar, but Lady Lydi­ell has per­fect tas­te, and she wo­uldn't ha­ve put the black in yo­ur ward­ro­be if she didn't think you'd lo­ok go­od in it."</p>
   <p>    The fa­ir and de­cep­ti­vely fra­gi­le Ka­ra pur­sed her lips in tho­ught. "I co­uld try it, I sup­po­se-"</p>
   <p>    The tho­ught was mot­her to the act; in a me­re mo­ment, the gown of se­ven­te­en overd­res­ses ma­de of she­erest silk was in a he­ap on the flo­or, and Ka­ra slid the he­avy sa­tin black over her he­ad whi­le Gi­an­na pic­ked up the dis­car­ded gown, sho­ok it out, and put it back in the ward­ro­be. Gi­an­na, for­tu­na­tely, had a ma­nia for ne­at­ness. Ka­ra smo­ot­hed the bi­as-cut gown over her flat sto­mach, set­tled the po­in­ted neck­li­ne, and twitc­hed the long sle­eves so that the po­ints of the cuffs ca­me down pre­ci­sely over the backs of her hands, then tur­ned to ga­ze at her ref­lec­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Gianna was al­re­ady sta­ring in awe, her lips pur­sed. "Oo­oh, Ka­ra!" she ent­hu­sed. "It's per­fect, Ren's right! We­ar it!"</p>
   <p>    And it was per­fect; Ka­ra's misty-blue eyes in the ref­lec­ti­on we­re wi­de with surp­ri­se as she pul­led her long ha­ir over one sho­ul­der to fall in a sil­ver-gilt cas­ca­de along the shi­ning black sa­tin. Ren­na­ti smot­he­red a smi­le. "Re­mem­ber tho­se sil­ver-and-jet or­na­ments that puz­zled you in the jewel-chest?" she promp­ted. "I wo­uld bet that they're me­ant to go with the black." As the ot­her two wo­men do­ve for the jewel-chest, Ren­na­ti went back to her own tho­ughts. She and Gi­an­na we­re mo­re than re­ady for any po­ten­ti­al call for the­ir ser­vi­ces; it was only Ka­ra who'd be­en in­de­ci­si­ve. Ka­ra co­uld ne­ver ma­ke up her mind abo­ut anyt­hing, and pre­fer­red to be led by the ot­her two.</p>
   <p>    Which was fi­ne with Ren­na­ti. Gi­an­na was the na­tu­ral le­ader of the ha­rem, if one co­uld be cal­led a "le­ader" in a gro­up of three. Ren­na­ti was in­dif­fe­rent to who to­ok the le­ad in such pres­sing qu­es­ti­ons as what to eat, what mu­sic to play, or what to we­ar. Even now Ka­ra sat pas­si­vely whi­le Gi­an­na de­ci­ded what to do with her ha­ir and the we­alth of sil­ver and black or­na­ments that we­re ob­vi­o­usly sup­po­sed to go in­to a co­if­fu­re.</p>
   <p>    Gianna had be­en re­ady ho­urs ago; last night she had worn a clo­se-cut scar­let vel­vet gown with a cle­ava­ge so low and tight that she ne­arly pop­ped out of it-not that, with her ge­ne­ro­us fe­atu­res, she wasn't pe­ri­lo­usly clo­se to pop­ping out of anyt­hing she wo­re. To­night she fa­vo­red a dusty ro­se that was not tight-fit­ting at all, but plun­ged so low in the back that the­re was not a single one of her per­fectly-sculp­tu­red ver­teb­rae that was not on show, and as usu­al, she had ma­de up her mind af­ter swiftly rif­ling thro­ugh her clo­set. Ren­na­ti had be­en re­ady even ear­li­er; last night she had worn an eme­rald-gre­en she­ath that matc­hed her eyes, slit to the hips on eit­her si­de, and to­night it was a pa­le gre­en tu­nic with an asym­met­ri­cal hem and no sho­es. She didn't ex­pect Lord Kyndreth to get to her, any­way; she ex­pec­ted to dan­ce whi­le the ot­her two wor­ked the­ir wi­les on him. Lord Kyndreth had exp­res­sed ple­asu­re with her dan­cing last night, and she hadn't even be­gun to show off her ta­lent. If the ot­her two oc­cu­pi­ed his bed, that wo­uld gi­ve her a ra­re mo­ment alo­ne to ac­ti­va­te her te­le­son-ring to spe­ak with her re­al Mist­ress.</p>
   <p>    She hadn't le­ar­ned much-except that Kyndreth was ple­ased, very ple­ased, with Lord Kyrti­an, and in­ten­ded to be­co­me his pat­ron-but she re­mem­be­red Lady Tri­ana's inst­ruc­ti­ons to re­port everyt­hing. They hadn't yet be­en al­lo­wed out of the tiny ha­rem, tho­ugh ne­it­her Ka­ra nor Gi­an­na par­ti­cu­larly ca­red. Ren­na­ti wo­uld ha­ve li­ked the chan­ce to get out, ra­re tho­ugh it might be for a con­cu­bi­ne to ha­ve that chan­ce, but she had to ad­mit that, alt­ho­ugh the su­ite was re­la­ti­vely small, it was sump­tu­o­usly ap­po­in­ted and sho­uld sa­tisfy most cra­vings.</p>
   <p>    It even had win­dows ga­zing out on the world; from the lo­ok of things, the­ir su­ite was in a to­wer, for the win­dow-se­at whe­re Ren­na­ti lo­un­ged was at so­me he­ight abo­ve a wi­de, gre­en lawn. The­re we­re tre­es in the far dis­tan­ce, alt­ho­ugh with twi­light dar­ke­ning the sky it was hard to dis­tin­gu­ish anyt­hing but a va­gue, blu­ish blur at the end of the lawn. This was a no­velty; Ren­na­ti had ne­ver be­en in a ha­rem that had a vi­ew of the world she had last se­en as a yo­ung child, and she spent as much ti­me as pos­sib­le in the win­dows, watc­hing the rest of Lord Kyrti­an's sla­ves wal­king from he­re to the­re with pur­po­se in the­ir steps, or even wor­king on that plushy grass.</p>
   <p>    Anything they might pos­sibly ha­ve wan­ted had be­en sup­pli­ed to them. The­re we­re the usu­al lu­tes and harps to play on, if they de­si­red, or they co­uld le­ave the inst­ru­ments to play by them­sel­ves with a to­uch of the hand on a lit­tle sil­ver stud in the neck. If they cho­se the lat­ter, the inst­ru­ments so­me­how al­so sup­pli­ed an ac­com­pa­ni­ment of drums, bells, and flu­tes. The­re were ma­te­ri­als for emb­ro­idery and be­ad­work, scents, cos­me­tics of every sort, ha­ir-dres­sing inst­ru­ments, and even bo­oks, tho­ugh Ren­na­ti was the only one of the three of them who co­uld re­ad with any pro­fi­ci­ency. The bath­ro­om was small, but one didn't ne­ces­sa­rily ne­ed a bath one co­uld swim in, and the fo­od in­va­ri­ably ple­asant, if not sump­tu­o­us. Still, one didn't par­ti­cu­larly want a fe­ast pre­sen­ted to one every day in a ha­rem; it was al­to­get­her too easy to ove­re­at, and that wo­uld be a di­sas­ter for the fi­gu­re.</p>
   <p>    The do­or-chi­me sent the ot­her two in­to a flut­ter, and Ren­na­ti ro­se from the win­dow se­at to jo­in them as they flew in­to the re­cep­ti­on-cham­ber to­get­her.</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth, tall, bro­ad-sho­ul­de­red, and hand­so­me eno­ugh for any two hu­mans, stro­de unac­com­pa­ni­ed in­to the ro­om. All three of them drop­ped to the flo­or in a pro­fo­undly de­ep curtsy the mo­ment his fo­ot cros­sed the thres­hold. He la­ug­hed at Ka­ra's eager fa­ce as she lo­oked up at him.</p>
   <p>    "Well, last night you we­re a lily, so what are you to­night, hmm?" he te­ased. "A black nar­cis­sus, per­haps?"</p>
   <p>    "I am wha­te­ver yo­ur lords­hip ple­ases to call me," Ka­ra rep­li­ed, ri­sing first, with an exp­res­si­on of ado­ra­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    She pro­bably didn't fe­el ado­ra­ti­on, but she was adept at as­su­ming any exp­res­si­on she tho­ught might be met with ple­asu­re.</p>
   <p>    "As it sho­uld be," he res­pon­ded, ges­tu­ring to Ka­ra and Gi-anna, and gat­he­ring each in­to an arm. "Co­me now, last night I had but a bri­ef int­ro­duc­ti­on to fla­me-ha­ir's dan­cing, and I am eager to see mo­re."</p>
   <p>    He to­ok a se­at on a co­uch pi­led high with silk and vel­vet pil­lows, still with a girl on eit­her si­de to mi­nis­ter to him. Ren­na­ti ma­de the ro­unds of the ro­om, to­uc­hing each of the wa­iting inst­ru­ments in turn, then set the ti­me for the dan­ce by clap­ping her hands for a me­asu­re. The inst­ru­ments, in con­cert, struck up a li­vely pi­ece; she let it play thro­ugh for fo­ur me­asu­res be­fo­re le­aping out in­to the ro­om and set­ting her flying fe­et in­to mo­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    This, if anyt­hing, was what she li­ved for. She wo­uld rat­her ha­ve di­ed than not dan­ce. Her first ow­ner, a Lord of disc­ri­mi­na­ting tas­tes (so he styled him­self) and li­mi­ted me­ans, had grown bo­red with her pas­si­on, and had de­ci­ded to dis­po­se of her in a pri­va­te sa­le to fi­nan­ce the purc­ha­se of a new girl to tra­in.</p>
   <p>    "There's not­hing at all wrong with her," he'd told Lady Tri-ana, "It's just that she's al­ways dan­cing. I'd re­al­ly li­ke to find a new girl who has ta­lents that are a lit­tle mo­re rest­ful. One do­esn't al­ways want pran­cing abo­ut; it's very fa­ti­gu­ing to watch af­ter a whi­le."</p>
   <p>    For Lord Kyndreth, ho­we­ver, Ren­na­ti's pas­si­on ap­pa­rently had the vir­tue of no­velty, even if he was so busy with Ka­ra and Gi­an­na that he pa­id scant at­ten­ti­on to the nu­an­ces of Ren­na­ti's per­for­man­ce. And long be­fo­re she was we­ary, he was fully in­vol­ved with them. Or­na­ments had be­en re­mo­ved and set ca­re­ful­ly asi­de, along with a few bits of clot­hing, and when Ren­na­ti sig­na­led the inst­ru­ments to play qu­i­etly to them­sel­ves and sto­le out of the ro­om, no­ne of the three even no­ti­ced. That was fa­ir eno­ugh; she'd be­en Lord Kyndreth's first last night, which had left Ka­ra out. Ka­ra no do­ubt wan­ted a chan­ce for a bet­ter pre­sent to­night.</p>
   <p>    Rennati sto­le up the sta­irs to the up­per­most story of the to­wer whe­re the­ir bed­ro­oms we­re-not so much bed­ro­oms, as cur­ta­ined-off al­co­ves of a ro­om me­ant ne­ver to be se­en by the eyes of a Lord. He­re they co­uld prac­ti­ce with cos­me­tics, so­me­ti­mes to hi­la­ri­o­us ef­fect; he­re they kept the lit­ter of the­ir pre­vi­o­us li­ves, per­so­nal be­lon­gings too shabby for a Lord to see. Ka­ra had a bat­te­red old doll, much lo­ved and worn, and every bit of "jewelry" she ever ow­ned, go­ing right back to a string of pi­er­ced sea-shel­ls so­me lit­tle boy-child had on­ce gi­ven her, up to her own ef­forts with ne­ed­le and be­ads. The­re we­re a do­zen works-in-prog­ress on a tab­le, along with a doll be­ing cos­tu­med with be­ads and bits. Gi­an­na had ma­na­ged to ke­ep hold of all of her at­tempts at art­work and kept her sup­pli­es and easel up he­re. She was ma­king an at­tempt at a still-li­fe of Ka­ra's work-tab­le, but Ka­ra kept mo­ving things aro­und, much to her frust­ra­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Rennati had bo­oks-not the pretty le­at­her-bo­und vo­lu­mes of po­etry downs­ta­irs, but dirty old things with torn co­vers or no co­vers at all on every su­bj­ect un­der the sun, res­cu­ed from the Lord's trash-he­aps. And, of co­ur­se, she had Lady Tri­ana's te­le­son-ring.</p>
   <p>    With a few he­si­tant words, she ac­ti­va­ted it.</p>
   <p>    It was too small to al­low a pic­tu­re; it sent and re­ce­ived vo­ices only. As she had be­en told to ex­pect, the first vo­ice was un­fa­mi­li­ar.</p>
   <p>    "Who calls?" the vo­ice as­ked.</p>
   <p>    "Rennati," she rep­li­ed bre­ath­les­sly, a lit­tle as­to­nis­hed and a lit­tle fe­ar­ful to be hol­ding a thing of such gre­at ma­gic in her hand.</p>
   <p>    "Ah-wait one mo­ment. Lady Tri­ana will wish to spe­ak with you her­self."</p>
   <p>    The ring, a beryl li­ke the one in her col­lar, fell si­lent. Ren­na­ti wa­ited pa­ti­ently; so long as no one ca­me up he­re to in­ter­rupt her, she wo­uld wa­it for as long as she was told to. El­ven­lords we­re busy, and it was not re­aso­nab­le to ex­pect one to drop wha­te­ver she was do­ing simply to co­me and he­ar what a me­re con­cu­bi­ne had to say.</p>
   <p>    Finally, "Spe­ak," sa­id an im­pe­ri­o­us fe­ma­le vo­ice from the ring.</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ve be­en he­re sin­ce yo­ur agent sent me to Lady Lydi­ell," Ren­na­ti sa­id ins­tantly. "I am with two ot­her con­cu­bi­nes, in a to­wer, in a small ha­rem. I can see out­si­de from the win­dows, but I ha­ve not yet be­en al­lo­wed to ven­tu­re past the do­or. Lord Kyrti­an has be­en he­re on­ce only. He is en­ter­ta­ining Lyon Lord Kyndreth, who was he­re last night and is he­re now. Lord Kyn-dreth is go­ing to be­co­me Lord Kyrti­an's pat­ron. He told Ka­ra to­night that Lord Kyrti­an has ple­ased him and that we must not ex­pect to see very much of our mas­ter for so­me ti­me, sin­ce he is go­ing to go away to ta­ke char­ge of an army."</p>
   <p>    There was an odd la­ugh. "Well, that rat­her puts a kink in my plans; if he won't be the­re, you won't be ab­le to le­arn much from him. On the ot­her hand, if you do ma­na­ge to get out, you can see a gre­at de­al mo­re when the lord him­self is away. And this ot­her news-mo­re than in­te­res­ting. I ta­ke it that this is all you ha­ve for me for now?"</p>
   <p>    Rennati nod­ded, for­get­ting for a mo­ment that she co­uld not be se­en, then has­tily sa­id, "I am sorry, but that is in­de­ed all I ha­ve le­ar­ned."</p>
   <p>    "It is not a gre­at de­al, but the qu­ality is go­od, and I am ple­ased. No­tify me the mo­ment you le­arn anyt­hing mo­re. You may de­ac­ti­va­te the ring now."</p>
   <p>    Obediently, Ren­na­ti pas­sed her hand over the ring, shut­ting out the light from the ro­om for a mo­ment, which tur­ned it in­to an or­di­nary beryl aga­in. Then she pla­ced the ring in the dar­kest co­mer of her jewel-box, and hur­ri­ed back downs­ta­irs.</p>
   <p>    After all, it was not too la­te to earn anot­her ge­ne­ro­us pre­sent from Lord Kyndreth-and mo­re im­por­tantly, he might be inc­li­ned to talk af­ter­wards. El­ven­lord or hu­man, if they didn't sle­ep, they we­re all of­ten inc­li­ned to talk-after­wards.</p>

   <p>    The sun shi­ning down on the top of the hig­hest to­wer of the lady-ke­ep im­par­ted a drowsy warmth to Lady Moth's back that she was tho­ro­ughly enj­oying. She had al­ways li­ked the gent­le he­at of the sun; her la­te hus­band had on­ce scorn­ful­ly ac­cu­sed her of be­ing half-li­zard for the way she enj­oyed bas­king in the gar­den. But even if it had be­en the de­ad of win­ter, she wo­uld ha­ve be­en up he­re, for this was the only pla­ce on the en­ti­re es­ta­te that ga­ve an un­rest­ric­ted vi­ew down in­to the val­ley be­low. And what she watc­hed thro­ugh the eye­pi­ece of her bit of an­ti­que equ­ip­ment was fas­ci­na­ting in­de­ed. The­re was no bre­eze to stir the sil­ken, sil­very-blue folds of her dress, or dis­turb the simp­le, stra­ight fall of her ha­ir, nor to ma­ke bre­ezes wa­ve dis­tant branc­hes bet­we­en her and the in­te­res­ting sce­ne so far away in the val­ley. She felt sorry for the tiny lit­tle fi­gu­res that she knew by the­ir drab tu­nics we­re hu­man sla­ves. First one brightly-co­lo­red cre­atu­re in scar­let pa­ra­ded them out and set them to work in the kitc­hen-gar­den. Then a se­cond ap­pe­ared, clad in a vi­olent blue, far too so­on for them to ha­ve ac­comp­lis­hed much, and marc­hed them off to drill with we­apons.</p>
   <p>    Then a third emer­ged from the stab­les, this one in bron­ze sa­tin, and ran them off in­to the farm-fi­elds. What tho­se po­or be­wil­de­red sla­ves must be thin­king now, she co­uld not even be­gin to gu­ess.</p>
   <p>    "Lady Mort­he­na?" sa­id a dif­fi­dent vo­ice from be­hind the El-ven lady. "What are you do­ing?"</p>
   <p>    Lady Moth to­ok her eye away from the eye­pi­ece of the old-fas­hi­oned, gold-and-bron­ze te­les­co­pe, and tur­ned to smi­le at her most re­cent gu­est.</p>
   <p>    "I am using an old de­vi­ce, my de­ar," she sa­id to the yo­un­ger wo­man in a kindly vo­ice, kno­wing that Lady Vi­ri­di­na wo­uld ne­ver ha­ve se­en such a thing as a te­les­co­pe. "In fact, it da­tes qu­ite back to Eve­lon-or at le­ast, the len­ses in it do. It is cal­led a te­les­co­pe, and alt­ho­ugh I nor­mal­ly use it to exa­mi­ne stars, at the mo­ment I am using it to spy upon our ne­igh­bors." She pat­ted the long cylin­der of bron­ze, with or­na­te cur­li­cu­es cha­sed in­to the me­tal and in­la­id with gold wi­re, for it was a very old fri­end and long-ti­me com­pa­ni­on.</p>
   <p>    Lady Vi­ri­di­na's pa­le brow wrink­led with puz­zle­ment, with a fa­int frown on a fa­ce that was at­te­nu­ated by long il­lness. "Why are you bot­he­ring to do that?" she won­de­red. "They al­re­ady tell you everyt­hing, don't they?"</p>
   <p>    "That, my de­ar, is what I am as­cer­ta­ining for myself." Lady Moth put her eye back to the eye­pi­ece, and con­ti­nu­ed to ma­ke men­tal no­tes on the mo­ve­ments of the Yo­ung Lords' sla­ves out­si­de the Gre­at Ho­use. "In po­int of fact, I rat­her do­ubt that they are tel­ling me everyt­hing. For ins­tan­ce, the­re se­ems to be so­me di­sag­re­ement down the­re abo­ut just who is in char­ge of what. Just du­ring the ti­me I ha­ve be­en sit­ting he­re, I ha­ve se­en one hap­less gro­up of sla­ves her­ded from one un­comp­le­ted task to anot­her by three dif­fe­rent Yo­ung Lords." She chuck­led, and her la­ugh­ter was ec­ho­ed fa­intly by her com­pa­ni­on, who pat­ted the knot of long, sil­ver ha­ir at the back of her he­ad self-cons­ci­o­usly. "That is what co­mes with age, Vi­ri­di­na; sus­pi­ci­on. I stop­ped ta­king things at fa­ce va­lue a very, very long ti­me ago."</p>
   <p>    "So did I-but the dif­fe­ren­ce bet­we­en us, I think, is that you fo­und ot­her ways of fin­ding out what you ne­eded to know, and I didn't even try," Vi­ri­di­na sa­id ru­eful­ly, twis­ting her hands in the fi­ne silk of her flo­wing and many-la­ye­red vi­olet gown. "If I had, per­haps-"</p>
   <p>    She didn't fi­nish the sen­ten­ce, but Lady Moth was not abo­ut to al­low her to sink in­to self-rec­ri­mi­na­ti­on. "If you had, I do­ubt that it wo­uld ha­ve ma­te­ri­al­ly chan­ged anyt­hing. You and I we­re firmly un­der the thumbs of our un­la­men­ted Lords, and no know­led­ge or even fo­rek­now­led­ge wo­uld ha­ve al­lo­wed us to chan­ge what hap­pe­ned to us. Know­led­ge is not al­ways po­wer." She smi­led aga­in. "If it was, fond as I am of my To­wer, it wo­uld be Lady Moth who ru­led the ma­nor down the­re, and not that rab­ble of Yo­ung Lords."</p>
   <p>    Lady Moth had known very well that the­re was go­ing to be a sla­ve re­volt when the Yo­ung Lords sta­ged the­ir own re­vo­lu­ti­on aga­inst the­ir el­ders. Her own sla­ves had told her. She had al­re­ady ta­ken her­self out of her di­sag­re­e­ab­le hus­band's ho­me; she had ma­de a bar­ga­in with him-if he ga­ve her the lady-ke­ep, which had be­en the Do­wa­ger-Ho­use at­tac­hed to his es­ta­te, she wo­uld ma­ke no tro­ub­le for him when he fi­led a di­vor­ce­ment with the Co­un­cil. He had his eye on a very yo­ung El­ven girl- his tas­tes had be­gun to run to the ba­rely-pu­bes­cent in the past few ye­ars-and he was he­ar­tily ti­red of the wi­fe who co­uld not or wo­uld not ta­ke him as se­ri­o­usly as he tho­ught he sho­uld be ta­ken.</p>
   <p>    "I wish you had ma­na­ged to ta­ke the Ma­nor," Lady Vi­ri­di­na sig­hed wist­ful­ly. "I ha­te to think what da­ma­ge tho­se ca­re­less boys are wre­aking to yo­ur be­a­uti­ful ho­me."</p>
   <p>    Lady Moth only shrug­ged. "I ha­ve an equ­al­ly be­a­uti­ful ho­me he­re-and much mo­re ma­na­ge­ab­le," she po­in­ted out. "It's pro­bably just as well that I didn't try."</p>
   <p>    For her part, she had be­en so he­ar­tily ti­red of her lord that- gi­ven that she wo­uld not be re­qu­ired to re­mar­ry and co­uld ha­ve an es­tab­lish­ment, ho­we­ver small, of her own-she was pre­pa­red to al­low him to say wha­te­ver he ple­ased abo­ut her in or­der to ob­ta­in his fre­edom. She sus­pec­ted that he wo­uld cla­im she was ple­asu­ring her­self with hu­man sla­ves-but as it fell out, he ne­ver got the chan­ce, so her re­pu­ta­ti­on sur­vi­ved in­tact.</p>
   <p>    "May I lo­ok?" Vi­ri­di­na fi­nal­ly as­ked, al­lo­wing her cu­ri­osity to overcome her re­ti­cen­ce. Moth just la­ug­hed, sho­wed her how to fo­cus the inst­ru­ment, and ro­se so that Di­na co­uld ta­ke her se­at.</p>
   <p>    Moth's hus­band had not even li­ved to en­co­un­ter the re­volt, tho­ugh wit­ho­ut a do­ubt, if he had, he and his son wo­uld ha­ve be­en on op­po­si­te si­des of the conf­lict. Her son, who had sud­denly be­co­me as con­ser­va­ti­ve as his fat­her on­ce he was in the ru­ling se­at, had ma­na­ged to be sla­ugh­te­red al­most im­me­di­ately, and her da­ugh­ter had fled af­ter an abor­ti­ve at­tempt to ru­le the ma­nor her­self had fa­iled mi­se­rably. Lady Moth, as was the tra­di­ti­on in her fa­mily, had al­ways tre­ated her sla­ves with con­si­de­ra­ti­on and res­pect, en­ti­rely as if they we­re ser­vants, not sla­ves, and as if they we­re free to le­ave her ser­vi­ce if they cho­se to. She had ta­ken all her sla­ves with her to the To­wer, every sla­ve for which she co­uld con­coct even the re­mo­test ex­cu­se to ha­ve with her- a fact which pro­bably wo­uld ha­ve pro­vi­ded amp­le fod­der for her hus­band's ac­cu­sa­ti­ons. On­ce the­re, she had de­ac­ti­va­ted the elfs­to­nes in all of the­ir col­lars, ma­king them me­rely de­co­ra­ti­ve shams, and told them frankly that they now we­re free to go or stay. They all, to a man and wo­man, cho­se to stay. When the re­volt was at the bre­aking-po­int, her sla­ves had told her. They had for­ti­fi­ed the pla­ce, she had ar­med tho­se who knew how to use we­apons. To­get­her, they had out­fa­ced re­bel­li­o­us ex-sla­ves and Yo­ung Lords. In fact, her burly yo­ung gu­ards cal­led her "lit­tle mot­her," and to­ok as much ca­re of her as if she had truly gi­ven birth to them-unli­ke her own of­fsp­ring.</p>
   <p>    "Why not use scrying ins­te­ad of this de­vi­ce?" Di­na as­ked, mo­ving the te­les­co­pe to ga­ze at anot­her part of the val­ley.</p>
   <p>    "Because, my de­ar, the pla­ce is ade­qu­ately shi­el­ded aga­inst scrying-oh, not by ma­gic, by all that iron and ste­el they've ma­na­ged to col­lect." She sta­red down at the val­ley, one fin­ger tap­ping her lips tho­ught­ful­ly. "Very cle­ver of them, ac­tu­al­ly; the­re aren't three of them to­get­her that are a match for a sing­le one of the Old Lords, but the me­tal do­es the­ir work for them."</p>
   <p>    Needless to say, her son's ma­gic had not be­en eno­ugh to sa­ve him from en­ra­ged and mist­re­ated hu­mans who ca­me in the mid­dle of the night to be­at him to de­ath in his own bed-espe­ci­al­ly not when they ar­ri­ved be­dec­ked in thin iron arm­bands.</p>
   <p>    During the cha­os of the re­volt it­self, so­me of her son's sla­ves had es­ca­ped to her; the rest fled to the Wi­zards and the wil­der­ness. When mo­re ar­med bands of es­ca­ped sla­ves had co­me upon the To­wer, her pe­op­le pro­tec­ted and gu­ar­ded her whi­le she sto­od re­ady to use de­adly war-ma­gics if it be­ca­me ne­ces­sary. She knew abo­ut the ef­fects of iron and ste­el; she wo­uld not ha­ve ma­de any at­tempt to blast at­tac­kers, un­li­ke tho­se fo­olish El­ven­lords li­ke Di­na's hus­band. She plan­ned to blast ho­les in­to the earth be­ne­ath the­ir fe­et-or to use her ma­gic to la­unch lar­ge and he­avy obj­ects at them. Most of her an­xi­ety had not be­en for her­self, but for her pe­op­le, if they co­uld not con­vin­ce the­ir fel­low hu­mans to go away pe­ace­ably. She didn't want them hurt on her be­half, and she didn't want them to ha­ve to wit­ness what she might ha­ve to do to pro­tect them all.</p>
   <p>    Dina sto­od, and re­lin­qu­is­hed her se­at with a smi­le. "Very cle­ver of you to know the things that can't be in­ter­fe­red with by that me­tal," she sa­id, as Moth to­ok her se­at aga­in.</p>
   <p>    "Not cle­ver, de­ar, only re­so­ur­ce­ful. If I we­re cle­ver, I'd ha­ve ma­na­ged to find a way to eavesd­rop on them." That ir­ri­ta­ted her; she still hadn't ma­na­ged to in­si­nu­ate a re­li­ab­le spy in­to the­ir sla­ve-stock.</p>
   <p>    She was not en­ti­rely cer­ta­in what her pe­op­le had told ma­ra­uders du­ring tho­se first we­eks of the Re­volt to dis­su­ade them from at­tac­king the To­wer; the­re pro­bably had be­en se­ve­ral dif­fe­rent sto­ri­es, spe­ci­fi­cal­ly ta­ilo­red to each gro­up. It was true eno­ugh that a few, se­lect es­ca­pe­es had de­ci­ded to swell the ranks of her own folk-no do­ubt, be­ca­use they we­re un­wil­ling or unab­le to ma­ke the stre­nu­o­us jo­ur­ney over the mo­un­ta­ins to an un­cer­ta­in and pro­bably un­com­for­tably bar­ba­ric exis­ten­ce in the wil­der­ness.</p>
   <p>    Not that she bla­med them in the le­ast. She had al­ways had an amp­le por­ti­on of "Lady-ma­gic," and alt­ho­ugh her hus­band had not be­en awa­re of the fact, she was his equ­al in the re­alms of El­ven ma­gic usu­al­ly ta­ught only to men. Had it be­en ne­ces­sary, she co­uld ha­ve de­fen­ded the To­wer as well as many El­ven­lords, and pro­bably bet­ter than most. Now, her ma­gic went to en­su­ring the con­ti­nu­ed sur­vi­val of her di­mi­nis­hed es­ta­te. She did everyt­hing ne­eded to en­su­re exactly the right we­at­her for the farmfields, she went over the fi­elds and gar­dens da­ily to mo­ni­tor and en­co­ura­ge growth and he­alth in plants and ani­mals. She had the know­led­ge and the long me­mory to tell them what they ne­eded to do, and when. They trus­ted her, her le­ar­ning, her judg­ment, her ex­pe­ri­en­ce. That was what she had bro­ught to the tab­le; they had bro­ught the­ir la­bor. Re­tur­ning to the grand tra­di­ti­on of her fa­mily, they had wor­ked to­get­her to ma­ke su­re that El­ven-blo­od and hu­man-blo­od pros­pe­red.</p>
   <p>    "Is the­re anyt­hing you'd li­ke me to do this af­ter­no­on?" Di­na as­ked, dif­fi­dently.</p>
   <p>    Moth exa­mi­ned her fri­end ca­re­ful­ly. The­re had be­en mo­ments, in tho­se first days af­ter Vi­ri­di­na to­ok re­fu­ge with her, that she truly felt that Vi­ri­di­na wo­uld ne­ver be en­ti­rely sa­ne aga­in. But Di­na was stron­ger than Moth had first tho­ught; even af­ter es­ca­ping mur­der at her Lord's hands and se­e­ing her Lord in­ci­ne­ra­ted vir­tu­al­ly at her fe­et, she had not truly had a bre­ak­down of her sen­ses. It to­ok ti­me and ca­re­ful ten­ding, but she had re­co­ve­red. Moth de­ci­ded that it was ti­me for her to help do her part he­re.</p>
   <p>    "Would you ma­ke the ro­unds of the kitc­hen-gar­dens for me, de­ar? I wo­uld re­al­ly ap­pre­ci­ate it, and I know you must ha­ve ten­ded yo­ur own gar­dens tho­usands of ti­mes. I ne­edn't tell you what to do." Moth felt her­self both jus­ti­fi­ed and re­war­ded when Di­na's fa­ce lit up.</p>
   <p>    "Gladly! I ha­ve be­en fe­eling so-" she ges­tu­red frust­ra­ti­on with both hands "-so use­less. And a bur­den on you."</p>
   <p>    "You ha­ve ne­ver be­en a bur­den," Moth li­ed gra­ce­ful­ly. Di­na only smi­led, re­cog­ni­zing the lie, and the gra­ci­o­us­ness be­hind it, and tur­ned to go back down the sta­irs, her sle­eves and tra­iling hem flut­te­ring be­hind her.</p>
   <p>    After most of the es­ca­ping sla­ves we­re go­ne, but be­fo­re Moth had a chan­ce to mo­ve her­self and her pe­op­le back to the Gre­at Ho­use, the Yo­ung Lords had mo­ved in. Oc­ca­si­onal­ly, even now, she cur­sed her­self for he­si­ta­ting-but on the ot­her hand, the Gre­at Ho­use was much less de­fen­sib­le, and even with her new fol­lo­wers, she still had re­al­ly not eno­ugh pe­op­le to ade­qu­ately staff and run a pro­perty that was ten ti­mes the si­ze of that at­tac­hed to the To­wer.</p>
   <p>    The Yo­ung Lords had ta­ken over the aban­do­ned es­ta­te; they had bro­ught the­ir own sla­ves with them. Lady Moth was not en­ti­rely cer­ta­in whe­re they had got­ten tho­se sla­ves; many of them se­emed ter­ribly yo­ung for the work they we­re re­qu­ired to do. She sus­pec­ted that the Yo­ung Lords had ra­ided the bre­eding-farms of so­me of the Old Lords whi­le the lat­ter we­re oc­cu­pi­ed with the figh­ting, car­rying off hor­des of con­fu­sed and frigh­te­ned cre­atu­res ba­rely out of child­ho­od.</p>
   <p>    Poor, po­or things, she tho­ught, ta­king one last lo­ok thro­ugh the te­les­co­pe, her lips tigh­te­ning. Well, at le­ast the­re are eno­ugh of them to do the work they are or­de­red to do, and they are sa­ved one hor­ror. The­ir mas­ters are too busy with the­ir own con­cerns to abu­se them; con­fu­si­on is the worst they ha­ve to fa­ce.</p>
   <p>    The re­ason she had as­ked Di­na to ta­ke her pla­ce in "wor­king" the gar­den was that she had an ap­po­int­ment with the Yo­ung Lords qu­ite so­on, and it was bo­und to be stres­sful. She had co­me up he­re in the first pla­ce to get a lit­tle mo­re in­for­ma­ti­on be­fo­re she fa­ced them; now it was ti­me to chan­ge in­to a ri­ding-ha­bit and ma­ke the short jo­ur­ney over to the­ir strong­hold.</p>
   <p>    She cho­se her clot­hing ca­re­ful­ly: a ta­ilo­red, se­ve­re ha­bit of stark black, with only the ba­rest hints of sil­ver at the cuffs and thro­at. She dres­sed to in­ti­mi­da­te; the last thing she wis­hed to be tho­ught was "fe­mi­ni­ne." Her gro­om bro­ught her hor­se aro­und, along with her gu­ards, and she mo­un­ted and ma­de the short jo­ur­ney to what had on­ce be­en her ho­me.</p>
   <p>    She was ac­com­pa­ni­ed by fo­ur burly yo­ung men-hu­mans, not El­ves, and hu­mans that wo­re sca­le-armor of iron, not bron­ze, and had os­ten­ta­ti­o­usly ba­re necks. Moth had pla­yed the ga­me of wits and tre­ac­hery for cen­tu­ri­es be­fo­re the­se strip­lings had ever be­en born.</p>
   <p>    They we­re, one and all, less than a cen­tury old; when she swept in­to the me­eting-cham­ber in her trim sab­le-silk ri­ding ha­bit, her ha­ir in an un­comp­ro­mi­sing knot bo­und in a black silk sno­od, with all fo­ur of her es­corts flan­king her, they fo­und them­sel­ves ri­sing from the­ir se­ats des­pi­te wha­te­ver the­ir ori­gi­nal in­ten­ti­ons had be­en in the way of gre­eting.</p>
   <p>    She pa­used at her se­at, lo­oked gra­vely up and down the tab­le with an un­re­adab­le exp­res­si­on, and only then did she sit- which in turn, al­lo­wed them to re­su­me the­ir se­ats. She might not be the le­ader he­re, but in the­ir he­arts, they all ack­now­led­ged her po­wer.</p>
   <p>    Which is mo­re than the­ir fat­hers wo­uld. Then aga­in, she pro­bably wo­uldn't ever use tac­tics this cru­de with the­ir fat­hers.</p>
   <p>    She lis­te­ned wit­ho­ut com­ment to the re­ports of the­ir prog­ress-or lack of it-aga­inst the­ir fat­hers. The si­tu­ati­on was cle­arly at sta­le­ma­te, and had be­en for so­me ti­me now. This was not ne­ces­sa­rily bad, and had they as­ked her opi­ni­on, she wo­uld ha­ve ad­vi­sed pa­ti­en­ce. When the­re is sta­le­ma­te, it is of­ten pos­sib­le for frust­ra­ti­on to dri­ve one si­de or the ot­her to ma­ke a cru­ci­al mis­ta­ke.</p>
   <p>    But, of co­ur­se, they didn't ask her opi­ni­on, and she didn't of­fer it-sin­ce it was cle­ar that they wo­uld not be­li­eve a me­re fe­ma­le wo­uld ha­ve any ex­pe­ri­en­ce re­le­vant to the "man's work" of war­fa­re.</p>
   <p>    As if they ha­ve any! she tho­ught, wit­ho­ut amu­se­ment. But war­fa­re was not why she had co­me to this me­eting. Even­tu­al­ly they got aro­und to the to­pic she wis­hed to co­ver, in the form of a sing­le ca­su­al com­ment by one of the le­ast in­tel­li­gent (to her mind) of the lot, oc­ca­si­oned by one of her body­gu­ards stif­ling a co­ugh at one of the mo­re fa­tu­o­us sug­ges­ti­ons.</p>
   <p>    "Lady Mort­he­na," sa­id Lord Al­ret­ha­ne, with a frown on his fa­ce, "I re­al­ly do not know what you are thin­king, al­lo­wing ar­med and un­cont­rol­led sla­ves to con­ti­nue in yo­ur ser­vi­ce."</p>
   <p>    "They are not sla­ves, they are my wil­ling ser­vants," she co­un­te­red smo­othly. "I find that I sle­ep bet­ter, kno­wing that my sle­ep is gu­ar­ded by fa­ith­ful pe­op­le who ser­ve me from lo­yalty and not be­ca­use they are for­ced to."</p>
   <p>    "Loyalty? Lo­yalty?" Al­ret­ha­ne exp­lo­ded. "Are you ac­tu­al­ly asc­ri­bing a ci­vi­li­zed emo­ti­on to the­se simp­le-min­ded bar­ba­ri­ans? They're a ba­re step abo­ve the be­asts!"</p>
   <p>    Another disc­re­et co­ugh re­min­ded him that he was in­sul­ting pe­op­le who we­re fre­emen, ar­med, and pro­tec­ted with ar­mor that wo­uld stop both ma­gic and bla­des. He stop­ped, ab­ruptly, and aver­ted his eyes.</p>
   <p>    "He has a po­int-" so­me­one sa­id.</p>
   <p>    Morthena lo­oked up and down the tab­le aga­in, exa­mi­ning exp­res­si­ons, and was di­sap­po­in­ted.</p>
   <p>    So. Not­hing has chan­ged. She had ho­ped that so­me, at le­ast, of the Yo­ung Lords wo­uld ha­ve star­ted to see sen­se. In­so­far as the hu­mans we­re con­cer­ned, the Yo­ung Lords we­re of two camps; the ma­j­ority-a scant ma­j­ority, but eno­ugh-held hu­mans and halfb­lo­ods in the sa­me con­tempt as did the­ir el­ders. The mi­no­rity, led and co­ac­hed by Lady Moth, wan­ted to see hu­mans and halfb­lo­ods gi­ven equ­al sta­tus with El­ves. So far, no­ne of tho­se she con­si­de­red to be "wa­ve­ring" had chan­ged the­ir minds. She had ho­ped that this par­ti­cu­lar disp­lay, sho­wing just how far she trus­ted her pe­op­le, wo­uld ha­ve had so­me ef­fect.</p>
   <p>    At le­ast the mi­no­rity saw to it that the hu­man sla­ves ow­ned by the rest we­re not mist­re­ated.</p>
   <p>    And the­re ha­ve be­en eno­ugh chan­ces al­re­ady that tho­se who had the co­ura­ge and ini­ti­ati­ve to es­ca­pe to the Wi­zards ha­ve al­re­ady do­ne so.</p>
   <p>    The sla­ves they now had pro­bably ser­ved out of the usu­al mix of fe­ar of the col­lar, an ina­bi­lity to ima­gi­ne that anyt­hing co­uld be dif­fe­rent, and an ina­bi­lity to get the­ir hands on any iron or ste­el which wo­uld ren­der a sla­ve-col­lar use­less. She sus­pec­ted that it was the for­mer two re­asons that we­re the stron­gest, sin­ce an­yo­ne who re­al­ly wan­ted the me­tal rings that wo­uld ne­ga­te the col­lars co­uld ha­ve one from Moth's pe­op­le just by as­king. Pity wo­uld only ta­ke her so far; if the sla­ves he­re co­uldn't lo­ok be­yond the­ir fe­ar, if they didn't ha­ve the ba­sic in­tel­li­gen­ce to ima­gi­ne so­met­hing dif­fe­rent from the­ir cur­rent li­fe, she co­uldn't help them.</p>
   <p>    I won't press the is­sue any furt­her; if I do, I'll only we­aken my own party, and if the rest of the­se yo­ung fo­ols turn on me, I will ha­ve to bar­ri­ca­de myself wit­hin my own lands and ho­pe they grow bo­red with me. The­re wo­uld be no po­int in trying to flee; I am not at all san­gu­ine abo­ut the li­ke­li­ho­od of a full El-ven­lord fin­ding a wel­co­me among the Wi­zards, even if Di­na's child­ren are among them.</p>
   <p>    Her tho­ughts we­re mo­men­ta­rily dist­rac­ted by that re­min­der of Di­na's child­ren. Po­or Di­na; she hadn't he­ard anyt­hing from them sin­ce they par­ted from her on Moth's do­ors­tep. It was, after all, just as li­kely they we­re in hi­ding so­mew­he­re ot­her than among the halfb­lo­oded Wi­zards. Only one of them was a half-blo­od any­way-Lor­ryn, the boy. Shey­re­na was of full el­ven blo­od, and she co­uld not ima­gi­ne the girl be­ing wel­co­med by the Wi­zards.</p>
   <p>    It's li­kely that alt­ho­ugh Lorryn might ha­ve be­en ab­le to con­vin­ce the Wi­zards that Shey­re­na was not ac­tu­al­ly an im­me­di­ate dan­ger to them when he first en­co­un­te­red them, he wo­uld ne­ver be ab­le to con­vin­ce them that Re­na is comp­le­tely harm­less. And if he co­uldn't con­vin­ce them that his own sis­ter wasn't go­ing to bring di­sas­ter on them, he'd ne­ver be ab­le to ma­ke them be­li­eve that an an­ci­ent El­ven lady li­ke Moth was on the­ir si­de.</p>
   <p>    Poor, po­or Di­na; she wor­ri­ed so much abo­ut them, alt­ho­ugh she tri­ed not to show it. The one reg­ret that Moth had was that the­re was no way for her to dis­co­ver if Di­na's two child­ren we­re all right, or even whe­re they we­re.</p>
   <p>    It is the most li­kely, ac­tu­al­ly, that Re­na is ens­con­ced so­mew­he­re off in the wil­der­ness, far from El­ven­lord, hu­man, or half-blo­od. She has ma­gic eno­ugh to ke­ep her­self sa­fe-well, ac­cor­ding to Di­na, she has ma­gic eno­ugh to cont­rol ali­corns! And Lorryn wo­uld ne­ver al­low her to co­me to harm or suf­fer any want-if he's with the Wi­zards, he'll see to it that she's got fo­od eno­ugh and shel­ter. In a way, she en­vi­ed the two yo­ungs­ters. If I'd had the yo­uth and the op­por­tu­nity, I'd ha­ve go­ne right off the map. The world is wi­de, af­ter all; wi­de eno­ugh to hi­de dra­gons from us for all the­se cen­tu­ri­es, it can cer­ta­inly hi­de a few El­ves who don't wish to be fo­und.</p>
   <p>    The con­ver­sa­ti­on had ma­de a wi­de de­to­ur aro­und the qu­es­ti­on of the sla­ves, and was back on the to­pic of the war. So­me­one wis­hed alo­ud for so­me sec­ret that wo­uld al­low the se­lect eli­mi­na­ti­on of so­me of the le­aders. "That wo­uld throw a go­od fright in­to them," the cal­low yo­ungs­ter sa­id, with a sa­va­gery worthy of any "bar­ba­ri­an and bes­ti­al hu­man." "Let a few mo­re of them die the way Lord Dyran di­ed, and they'll gi­ve us wha­te­ver we want!"</p>
   <p>    Moth held her ton­gue. It was just as well that the Yo­ung Lords we­re not awa­re that Di­na and her da­ugh­ter ma­na­ged to in­ci­ne­ra­te Di­na's hus­band, the Lord Tre­ves, in a' way very similar to the way Lord Dyran's son slew him. Her own trus­ted ser­vants knew, and they had kept it a strict sec­ret, and she was qu­ite gra­te­ful to them for pre­ser­ving that sec­ret. The­se yo­ung hot­he­ads sho­uld ne­ver le­arn so­met­hing that dan­ge­ro­us. They 'd pro­bably ma­na­ge to kill each ot­her with it.</p>
   <p>    Eventually the me­eting gro­und down to its ine­vi­tab­le conc­lu­si­on, and Moth ro­se. "With yo­ur per­mis­si­on, gent­le­men, I sho­uld li­ke to go tend to the lib­rary un­til sun­set, if I may?" she as­ked po­li­tely.</p>
   <p>    They didn't even ta­ke a se­cond tho­ught abo­ut her re­qu­est- yo­ung Lord Ke­ta­li­arn wa­ved va­gu­ely at her, and she to­ok that as per­mis­si­on and left, tra­iled fa­ith­ful­ly by her es­cort.</p>
   <p>    Of all the things that sho­wed how cal­low they we­re, this was by far the most bla­tant. They con­si­de­red the lib­rary to be use­less, fit only for the con­cern of silly old la­di­es half li­ving in the past. They tho­ught all she was do­ing was cle­aning and pre­ser­ving the bo­oks-re­mo­ving a few, now and then, for her own amu­se­ment in her bo­wer.</p>
   <p>    Oh, the yo­ung fo­ols.</p>
   <p>    The ro­om she now en­te­red, one of the fi­nest lib­ra­ri­es ever as­semb­led in this world, was (had they only had the wit to re­ali­ze it) full of in­for­ma­ti­on the Yo­ung Lords co­uld use to help the­ir own ca­use. She bre­at­hed de­eply of the scent of le­at­her, vel­lum, parch­ment and pa­per, to­ok a long lo­ok aro­und the shel­ves that her hus­band had only sel­dom per­mit­ted her to ac­cess whi­le he was ali­ve, and set to work.</p>
   <p>    Many of the ol­dest bo­oks had not be­en ten­ded in far too long; she wo­uld not per­mit any bo­ok, ho­we­ver tri­vi­al, to suf­fer from the worm's to­oth or the de­cay of age. Whe­ne­ver she was he­re, she spent a few ho­urs in cle­aning and res­to­ring tho­se an­ci­ent bo­oks-no mat­ter how tri­vi­al they se­emed to be, the­re was no tel­ling when so­me scrap of know­led­ge in them might pro­ve use­ful.</p>
   <p>    Most of her ti­me, ho­we­ver, was spent in lo­oking for the ones that she wo­uld rat­her not le­ave to the cu­ri­o­us eyes of the Yo­ung Lords.</p>
   <p>    Lady Moth had hel­ped yo­ung Kyrti­an's fat­her with his re­se­arch in this very lib­rary on­ce or twi­ce be­fo­re his di­sap­pe­arance, and. she was well awa­re that he had known bet­ter than she what lay he­re. She only knew wit­hin her own bo­oks was a set of very, very an­ci­ent works that Kyrti­an's fat­her had con­sul­ted in his se­arc­hes for an­ci­ent sec­rets; she did not know which bo­oks they we­re, nor what they held.</p>
   <p>    Nevertheless, sin­ce she had be­en for­ced to qu­it the pla­ce, she had be­en de­ter­mi­ned that at the first chan­ce she wo­uld get in he­re and find them aga­in. Sin­ce the Yo­ung Lords got he­re, she had be­en using her vi­sits to find each and every one of tho­se pre­ci­o­us vo­lu­mes and ta­ke them back to the To­wer, a few at a ti­me. Wha­te­ver was in them had led to the de­ath of one Er­ven-lord; she sus­pec­ted that what he had go­ne se­eking had so­me­how kil­led him. Which imp­li­ed that the sec­rets to be fo­und in tho­se bo­oks co­uld be very, very dan­ge­ro­us in­de­ed.</p>
   <p>    None of the Yo­ung Lords ca­red what she did in the­re. So as she wor­ked on the task of ke­eping the lib­rary cle­aned and pre­ser­ved, and she fer­re­ted out tho­se pre­ci­o­us few bo­oks so that one day, per­haps, she co­uld pre­sent them to Kyrti­an, they we­re comp­le­tely ob­li­vi­o­us to the va­lue of what she was ta­king out right un­der­ne­ath the­ir very no­ses.</p>
   <p>    I shall ha­ve to do so­me re­se­arch of my own, I'm af­ra­id, she ref­lec­ted. A dan­ge­ro­us sec­ret was exactly what she was lo­oking for, af­ter all; the­re we­re a few old half-re­mem­be­red sto­ri­es of things that had be­en aban­do­ned right af­ter the Cros­sing, and tech­ni­qu­es that had be­en for­got­ten in the has­te to find and bu­ild a se­cu­re ha­ven.</p>
   <p>    For her part, at the mo­ment, she wo­uld be happy to find so­me way to com­mu­ni­ca­te with her nep­hew ot­her than by te­le­son or mes­sen­ger.</p>
   <p>    She had just be­en in­for­med this mor­ning of a very dis­tur­bing ru­mor-as yet un­con­fir­med, but she had be­en ho­ping to he­ar so­met­hing eit­her to con­firm or deny it at to­day's me­eting. One of her ser­vants to­ok pe­ri­odic and very risky ven­tu­res in­to the lands still held by the Old Lords, co­ming back just af­ter dawn with the si­tu­ati­on as vi­ewed from the Enemy's van­ta­ge-and he had told her that the­re was a re­port that Kyrti­an had ta­ken com­mand of the Old Lords' army.</p>
   <p>    If that was true-</p>
   <p>    If that is true, then the ot­her si­de has ma­de a des­pe­ra­te gamb­le, and all unk­no­wing has hit upon the one thing that will pro­bably gi­ve them vic­tory. And the thing is, the­se yo­ung fo­ols will be de­ad cer­ta­in that put­ting Kyrti­an in com­mand of the Enemy is go­ing to be the one thing that will en­su­re the Old Lords' de­fe­at. Yo­ung idi­ots.</p>
   <p>    If only she co­uld spe­ak to him, and per­su­ade him that she was one of the re­bels, su­rely he wo­uld think twi­ce abo­ut his cur­rent al­le­gi­an­ce!</p>
   <p>    I don't da­re use a te­le­son-tho­se are too easily mo­ni­to­red. And no­ne of my hu­mans ha­ve the hu­man type of ma­gic that lets them talk mind-to-mind with each ot­her. And I won't send one of my pe­op­le whe­re he might be cap­tu­red or consc­rip­ted in­to the army. It is a ter­rib­le po­si­ti­on to be in.</p>
   <p>    She was go­ing to ha­ve to start stud­ying the­se old to­mes her­self.</p>
   <p>    After all, it was a far bet­ter idea than sit­ting with her hands fol­ded, wa­iting for di­sas­ter to over­ta­ke all of them.</p>
   <p>    Besides, she de­ci­ded firmly, sho­ving anot­her an­ci­ent vo­lu­me in­to the sad­dle­bag for her gu­ard to ta­ke with him. I will ne­ver sit by with fol­ded hands whi­le things fall to pi­eces.</p>
   <p>    -not even if so­me­one ti­es me in­to the cha­ir and binds my hands to­get­her!</p>

   <p>    In the he­art of the Ci­ta­del, the ho­me of the halfb­lo­oded Wi­zards, Lorryn ig­no­red the dro­ne of vo­ices aro­und the tab­le and to­ok just a mo­ment to mar­vel at his sur­ro­un­dings. It se­ems so stran­ge, even now, to fi­nal­ly be myself. No il­lu­si­ons, no ca­re­ful­ly hi­ding what I am- In spi­te of everyt­hing, all the hards­hips, all the dan­ger, even the silly ag­gra­va­ti­ons, Lorryn was not sorry to be he­re, among Halfb­lo­ods li­ke him­self, at last.</p>
   <p>    This most spa­ci­o­us of ca­verns in the­ir new ho­me that the Wi­zards used as a me­eting-hall was a ple­asant pla­ce in which to find one­self-so long as no one was me­eting in it. A pe­cu­li­arity of the ca­verns al­lo­wed a won­der­ful flow of fresh air thro­ugh he­re, so long as cer­ta­in ope­nings that ser­ved as do­ors and win­dows we­re left open to catch the sum­mer bre­ezes. Last win­ter things had got­ten a lit­tle sta­le in this ro­om, and with such a high ce­iling it ten­ded to be dank and chill.</p>
   <p>    Unfortunately for his she­er ple­asu­re, the­re was a me­eting go­ing on, and Lorryn was glad that he had amp­le ex­pe­ri­en­ce in ke­eping a ple­asant exp­res­si­on plas­te­red on his fa­ce whi­le he him­self was not fe­eling in the le­ast ple­asant. He had a he­adac­he li­ke a tight band aro­und his he­ad, and he had in­ser­ted his ton­gue a trif­le bet­we­en his te­eth to ke­ep from grin­ding them and ma­king the he­adac­he wor­se.</p>
   <p>    How is it that Ca­el­lach Gwa­in has ma­na­ged to find the pre­ci­se na­sal whi­ne best cal­cu­la­ted to set my ner­ves on ed­ge? he as­ked him­self, as he nod­ded af­fably at the el­der Wi­zard. He ac­tu­al­ly co­uldn't ma­ke out mo­re than half of what the man sa­id, thanks to the we­ird aco­us­tics in the pla­ce, but then he didn't ha­ve to lis­ten to Ca­el­lach to know what he was go­ing to say. The man is li­ke a te­le­son stuck on end­less re­pe­ti­ti­on of the last thing it sent.</p>
   <p>    This was sup­po­sed to be a me­eting abo­ut the prog­ress ma­de in set­ting up the she­ep and cat­tle farm be­low the Ci­ta­del, but Ca­el­lach had ta­ken it over as usu­al. He was in­tent only on rec­re­ating as much of the old com­fort of the first Ci­ta­del in the­ir new ho­me as he co­uld ma­na­ge, and he had ta­ken the op­por­tu­nity of a bri­ef al­lu­si­on to the old Ci­ta­del to air his usu­al gri­evan­ce.</p>
   <p>    Which is, of co­ur­se, that the Wi­zards are not tre­ated li­ke El-ven­lords of the High Co­un­cil. Old fo­ol. Hasn't he fi­gu­red out yet that when one gro­up lords it over anot­her, the un­der­lings are go­ing to want to stri­ke back?</p>
   <p>    The old man's li­tany of comp­la­ints was as fa­mi­li­ar to Lorryn as the tex­tu­re of the wo­oden tab­le he sta­red at as he cont­rol­led his tem­per and his exp­res­si­on. The be­gin­ning, mid­dle, and end of Ca­el­lach's tro­ub­les we­re se­ated in his own gre­ed. He wan­ted all the ef­fort of the yo­un­ger Wi­zards and the hu­mans to go in­to ma­king him as cos­set­ted as he had be­en be­fo­re the se­cond Half-blo­od War. He didn't ca­re that they had to be self-suf­fi­ci­ent now, and co­uldn't ste­al ma­gi­cal­ly from the El­ven­lords any­mo­re. He didn't tro­ub­le him­self to think that it was far mo­re im­por­tant to see to the ra­ising of she­ep, go­ats and cat­tle, the cul­ti­va­ti­on of fi­elds, than to scrub an old wi­zard's flo­or on a da­ily ba­sis.</p>
   <p>    And he ab­so­lu­tely ha­ted that the ma­j­ority of the Halfb­lo­ods, vo­ting down Ca­el­lach and his cro­ni­es, had ma­de tre­ati­es of al­li­an­ce with the Iron Pe­op­le and with the Tra­der clans, gi­ving them the sta­tus of full equ­als and ho­no­red part­ners. The­se we­re ful­lblo­oded hu­mans who had the sta­tus of full equ­als and ho­no­red part­ners. Tho­ugh he did not da­re co­me out and say so di­rectly, this at­ti­tu­de in­cen­sed Ca­el­lach and his ilk, for to the­ir minds, the halfb­lo­oded Wi­zards we­re cle­arly su­pe­ri­or in every way to me­re hu­mans, and thus, sho­uld be tre­ated as such.</p>
   <p>    And we sho­uld all be run­ning and fetc­hing for them, ten­ding to the­ir com­fort, gi­ving them of our­sel­ves and the first fru­its of our la­bors, so as to re­ward them for the fa­ti­gu­ing ef­fort of the­ir ma­gics on our be­half. Lorryn, who was not only halfb­lo­oded him­self, but had be­en bro­ught up as an El­ven­lord with all of the at­ten­dant pri­vi­le­ges, fo­und Ca­el­lach's at­ti­tu­de just as in­sul­ting and ab­surd as any of the highly in­de­pen­dent Iron Pe­op­le or Tra­der clan folk did. The­re was not­hing in­he­rently su­pe­ri­or abo­ut a wi­zard. Yes, they had ma­gics, but so did the hu­mans. And sin­ce they had be­en set­tled he­re in the new Ci­ta­del, the ol­der wi­zards had not exer­ted them­sel­ves on­ce for the com­mon go­od-except, ra­rely, to te­ach so­me of the child­ren how to use the­ir po­wers.</p>
   <p>    Rather than lis­te­ning to Ca­el­lach's words, Lorryn lis­te­ned to the to­ne be­hind the words. He'd dis­co­ve­red he pos­ses­sed an in­te­res­ting knack for fer­re­ting out the emo­ti­ons and mo­ti­ves be­hind what pe­op­le sa­id, pro­vi­ded that they we­ren't as skil­led at co­ve­ring them­sel­ves as he was. He he­ard inj­ured self-este­em and af­front-that was ex­pec­ted-but he al­so he­ard fe­ar, and that was in­te­res­ting. He had not an­ti­ci­pa­ted that.</p>
   <p>    I sho­uld ha­ve, tho­ugh, he tho­ught, ra­ising his eyes and studying Ca­el­lach's exp­res­si­on as the man shif­ted his eyes away from Lorryn's di­rect ga­ze. Ca­el­lach was lo­oking a bit un­kempt, now that the­re was no one to wa­it on him. His clot­hing, the usu­al long ro­be af­fec­ted by most of the ol­der Wi­zards, was a bit sta­ined and fra­yed abo­ut the hem. His grey ha­ir was brus­hed, but no lon­ger hung abo­ut his sho­ul­ders in a kind of thick mant­le-inste­ad, it was held back un­ti­dily in a ta­il, and it se­emed to Lorryn that it had got­ten a bit thin at the temp­les. Pe­op­le do tend to re­act to new things eit­her with in­te­rest or fe­ar, and re­al­ly, I think Ca­el­lach Gwa­in is too hi­de­bo­und to re­act with in­te­rest to anyt­hing new.</p>
   <p>    Lorryn al­re­ady knew that Ca­el­lach was af­ra­id of the dra­gons; that was abun­dantly cle­ar to an­yo­ne with half an eye. The old Wi­zard wo­uldn't set fo­ot out­si­de when the­re we­re dra­gons abo­ut in the­ir na­tu­ral form, and as for the ones shif­ted in­to half-blo­od or hu­man sha­pe-well. If they to­ok se­ats on one si­de of the tab­le, it was a sa­fe bet that Ca­el­lach wo­uld pla­ce him­self as far from them as physi­cal­ly pos­sib­le whi­le still re­ma­ining at the tab­le.</p>
   <p>    His dis­li­ke of the Tra­ders and the Iron Pe­op­le was a lit­tle mo­re comp­li­ca­ted, and har­der to un­ders­tand. Lorryn let a few of the old wi­zard's ac­tu­al words-la­den with an­ger and ap­pre­hen­si­on-sift in past his own tho­ughts. What in the world had the old man's trews in a wad?</p>
   <p>    "-and how da­re they de­mand pay­ment in ad­van­ce, much less at all, for-"</p>
   <p>    Ah. That was eno­ugh to get the key. Lorryn had the ta­il of the tree-sna­ke now. Ca­el­lach wasn't in­cen­sed that he was ex­pec­ted to pay in ad­van­ce for the go­ods that the Tra­ders bro­ught he­re- he was angry that he was ex­pec­ted to pay at all. Pos­sibly be­ca­use Ca­el­lach's only ava­ilab­le co­in was, qu­ite frankly, de­ba­sed. He wasn't the most po­wer­ful Wi­zard any­mo­re, he wasn't the most skil­led, and his gre­ed had led him to ex­pend most of his ener­gi­es on his own com­forts, le­aving him with lit­tle that he co­uld use to bar­ter for things he wan­ted.</p>
   <p>    "And as for tho­se-bar­ba­ri­ans-"</p>
   <p>    Third leg to the sto­ol; he was in­cen­sed that the Iron Pe­op­le sho­wed him no de­fe­ren­ce at all-and didn't ne­ed his ma­gic.</p>
   <p>    Though why Ca­el­lach sho­uld think that a mob of ill-re­gu­la­ted ca­ve-dwel­ling re­fu­ge­es sho­uld con­si­der them­sel­ves mo­re ci­vi­li­zed than a well-re­gu­la­ted no­ma­dic pe­op­le was be­yond Lor-ryn's ima­gi­na­ti­on. But pre­j­udi­ce has not­hing to do with lo­gic. Per­haps it was be­ca­use the Iron Pe­op­le we­re comp­le­tely unimp­res­sed by the Wi­zards. They didn't ne­ed Wi­zards to de­fend them­sel­ves from the El­ven­lords; they had the­ir iron or­na­ments and a po­wer­ful war­ri­or class. Not to put too fi­ne a po­int on it, they had ac­tu­al­ly held two El­ven­lords as ens­la­ved pri­so­ners for the pur­po­ses of the­ir own amu­se­ment. The most that Ca­el­lach Gwa­in had ever ma­na­ged was to es­ca­pe re­la­ti­vely uns­cat­hed from them.</p>
   <p>    That had be­en a ne­ar thing, too. Ca­el­lach and his cro­ni­es eit­her did not re­ali­ze, or wo­uld not ad­mit, that it wasn't the El-ven­ba­ne's fa­ult en­ti­rely that the old Ci­ta­del and its dwel­lers had be­en dis­co­ve­red. The Wi­zards had be­en dan­cing on the ed­ge of a kni­fe for a very long ti­me, what with the­ir pil­fe­rings from the El­ven­lords and all. So far as the El­ves we­re con­cer­ned, the­re was only one kind of go­od halfb­lo­od-a de­ad one. Halfb­lo­ods we­ren't even sup­po­sed to exist, and most of the El­ven­lords we­re ut­terly de­vo­ted to ma­king cer­ta­in that they didn't. Las­ha­na's ac­ti­ons had only trig­ge­red the ava­lanc­he of El­ven ret­ri­bu­ti­on, not ca­used it.</p>
   <p>    And if it hadn't be­en for her qu­ick thin­king, and her dra­co­nic fri­ends, the wi­zards wo­uldn't ha­ve sur­vi­ved it.</p>
   <p>    What was mo­re, they we­ren't out of the wo­ods yet. As long as the halfb­lo­oded wi­zards li­ved, the El­ven­lords wo­uld try to eli­mi­na­ted them, tre­aty or no tre­aty. If Ca­el­lach Gwa­in and his circ­le tho­ught any dif­fe­rently, they we­re de­lu­ding them­sel­ves.</p>
   <p>    Not that the­re was anyt­hing new in the no­ti­on of Ca­el­lach Gwa­in de­lu­ding him­self…</p>
   <p>    Finally, Ca­el­lach ran out of things to say, and sat down. Lor-ryn had very qu­ickly fi­gu­red out that al­lo­wing the old Wi­zard to rant and whi­ne, whi­le unp­le­asant to lis­ten to, ge­ne­ral­ly had the sa­lub­ri­o­us ef­fect of ma­king him si­lent for the rest of any me­eting of which he was a part. "Thank you, Ca­el­lach; yo­ur ex­pe­ri­en­ce is, as al­ways, ap­pa­rent to all of us," he sa­id, gra­ci­o­usly. Ca­el­lach be­gan to pre­en. "Yo­ur ob­ser­va­ti­ons are con­ti­nu­o­usly fascinating." He ig­no­red the gri­ma­ce that one of the yo­un­ger halfb­lo­ods ma­de at him from be­hind the shel­ter of one hand, and the spasms that cros­sed se­ve­ral ot­her fa­ces in an ef­fort to ke­ep from burs­ting out in­to la­ugh­ter. "Now-I'd li­ke to put the mat­ter of the pro­po­sed up­per pas­tu­re for the go­ats to a vo­te. All in fa­vor?"</p>
   <p>    Even Ca­el­lach ra­ised his hand, se­du­ced, no do­ubt, in­to thin­king that the go­ats wo­uld lo­ok af­ter them­sel­ves, and not re­qu­ire shep­herds, now that they had so­me of the hu­ge cat­tle-dogs ra­ised by the Iron Pe­op­le at the­ir dis­po­sal. Lorryn ma­de cer­ta­in that the­re we­re no dis­sen­ters, and nod­ded. "Go­od. We're all ag­re­ed. Half­den, wo­uld you see abo­ut fin­ding so­me vo­lun­te­ers for the job and get­ting them to me to be in­ter­vi­ewed?" He ne­eded hu­mans for this task, pre­fe­rably child­ren with the abi­lity to spe­ak mind-to-mind, so that they co­uld call for help if they saw anyt­hing, or if the­re was so­met­hing out the­re that ne­it­her they nor the dogs co­uld hand­le.</p>
   <p>    More of the ser­vants that Ca­el­lach Gwa­in thinks are his per­so­nal pro­perty.</p>
   <p>    Halfden, one of the ol­der ex-sla­ves, nod­ded, and Lorryn cal­led the me­eting to a clo­se.</p>
   <p>    But li­ke it or not, he wasn't qu­ite do­ne with Ca­el­lach-at le­ast so far as Ca­el­lach was con­cer­ned.</p>
   <p>    "I re­al­ly ne­ed to talk with you abo­ut the qu­ality of my qu­ar­ters, Lorryn," the wi­zard sa­id, grab­bing him by the el­bow be­fo­re he co­uld ma­ke his es­ca­pe. Lorryn le­ve­led a blank ga­ze at him.</p>
   <p>    "My go­od sir," he sa­id, with the kind of po­li­te to­ne in which a spe­ci­o­us warmth and charm we­re mi­xed with ut­ter calm, "if you think you are be­ing sligh­ted, I in­vi­te you to co­me and ins­pect my qu­ar­ters-or Sha­na's for that mat­ter. I think you will find that they are by no me­ans su­pe­ri­or to yo­urs. In fact, gi­ven that ne­it­her of us cho­se our ro­oms un­til ever­yo­ne el­se had got­ten the­ir pick, you'll find them far in­fe­ri­or to yo­urs."</p>
   <p>    "Yes, but-" Ca­el­lach pro­tes­ted-altho­ugh we­akly, sin­ce he had be­en in the lit­tle no­ok of a ca­ve that Lorryn used, and knew that it was scar­cely lar­ger than the clo­set in his own su­ite of lin­ked ca­ve­lets.</p>
   <p>    "I know that it is trying to you to be in such pri­mi­ti­ve surroundings, af­ter ha­ving to aban­don such a won­der­ful and com­for­tab­le pla­ce as yo­ur old ho­me," Lorryn sa­id, now in­te­rj­ec­ting a so­ot­hing no­te in­to his vo­ice. "Who co­uld know bet­ter than I? Do think what I left be­hind; I was the only ma­le he­ir to a po­wer­ful lord! But you will so­on find this li­fe as ex­hi­la­ra­ting as I do if you re­gard it as an op­por­tu­nity rat­her than a loss! Think of it! You now ha­ve the chan­ce to de­sign yo­ur very own qu­ar­ters in pre­ci­sely the way you'd most li­ke them-rat­her than be for­ced to en­du­re in­con­ve­ni­en­ces and awk­ward­nes­ses that co­unt­less ge­ne­ra­ti­ons of wi­zards be­fo­re you cre­ated! With a lit­tle ef­fort, you can, for the first ti­me, ha­ve everyt­hing per­fect!"</p>
   <p>    "Yes-but-" Ca­el­lach fal­te­red.</p>
   <p>    "There, you see?" Lorryn slap­ped him lightly on the back. "That se­ems bet­ter al­re­ady, do­esn't it? I knew I co­uld rely on you!"</p>
   <p>    And with that, he strol­led away, le­aving Ca­el­lach to go over the con­ver­sa­ti­on in his mind and try to de­ter­mi­ne what co­uld pos­sibly ha­ve go­ne wrong.</p>
   <p>    As he ro­un­ded a cor­ner, so­me­one jum­ped at him from the sha­dows. Ins­tinc­ti­vely he si­des­tep­ped and drew his hid­den dag­ger, with a de­fen­si­ve ma­gic me­ant def­lect a le­vin-bolt al­re­ady in pla­ce.</p>
   <p>    "You're get­ting bet­ter," Sha­na la­ug­hed, le­aning aga­inst the rock wall with her arms cros­sed over her chest, lo­oking qu­ite as if she had not be­en ca­ta­pul­ting her­self ac­ross the hal­lway from a na­tu­ral nic­he just at the le­vel of his he­ad a mo­ment be­fo­re.</p>
   <p>    "I sho­uld ho­pe so," he re­tor­ted. "You cer­ta­inly gi­ve me eno­ugh prac­ti­ce. We­re you lis­te­ning in on the me­eting?"</p>
   <p>    "I was-and you are a ge­ni­us. And so­me sort of ma­ge that I ha­ven't qu­ite fi­gu­red out." She til­ted her he­ad to the si­de, qu­iz­zi­cal­ly. "How you ma­na­ge Ca­el­lach-and how you ma­na­ge to not strang­le Ca­el­lach-is qu­ite be­yond me."</p>
   <p>    Lorryn la­ug­hed and of­fe­red her his hand, which she to­ok. "No ma­gic-just po­li­tics," he told her. "Ver­bal self-de­fen­se. I didn't spend much ti­me among the sche­mers and plot­ters, but I did hob-nob with so­me of them and, of co­ur­se, I al­ways had to be ab­le to pla­ca­te my fat­her. I le­ar­ned early how to say not­hing whi­le se­eming to say everyt­hing."</p>
   <p>    She squ­e­ezed his hand. "It's still she­er ge­ni­us. No mat­ter how hard I try, I can't ma­na­ge pe­op­le half as well as you do."</p>
   <p>    He glan­ced asi­de at the yo­ung wo­man cal­led "the El­ven-ba­ne." She didn't lo­ok li­ke the stuff of le­gends; her scar­let tres­ses we­re ti­ed up on­to the top of her he­ad in a very prac­ti­cal ta­il, which she of­ten tos­sed li­ke an im­pa­ti­ent hor­se pla­gu­ed with fli­es. Her hand­so­me fa­ce was not­hing in be­a­uty com­pa­red to the ho­me­li­est of el­ven la­di­es, and her fi­gu­re was so well-musc­led that most of them wo­uld ha­ve re­co­iled in hor­ror at the no­ti­on of lo­oking li­ke her. To­day she had on a sle­eve­less tu­nic of le­at­her and a pa­ir of co­ar­se sla­ves'-cloth trews-but to his eyes, she co­uldn't ha­ve lo­oked bet­ter if she'd be­en en­ro­bed in his sis­ter Shey­re­na's pre­sen­ta­ti­on-gown.</p>
   <p>    "I ho­pe you aren't-bot­he­red by me ta­king on all the­se me­etings li­ke this," he sa­id, he­si­tantly. "You're sup­po­sed to be the le­ader, I know, but-"</p>
   <p>    "Am I je­alo­us? Oh, Fi­re and Ra­in, get that idea out of yo­ur he­ad this mo­ment!" she rep­li­ed with a la­ugh. "I ne­ver as­ked to be the El­ven­ba­ne, you know-and the only re­ason be­si­des that stu­pid le­gend that pe­op­le pay any at­ten­ti­on to what I think is that I think qu­ic­ker than they do. Hand­ling the old go­ats is not a job that re­qu­ires qu­ick thin­king-and you ha­ve the-" She con­si­de­red for a mo­ment, he­ad til­ted to one si­de. "-the 'man­ner born' is how I'd put it. You say things, and pe­op­le do them, ins­te­ad of ar­gu­ing with you abo­ut it."</p>
   <p>    He tho­ught that if she was dis­semb­ling in any way, he wo­uld be ab­le to tell; he was get­ting pretty sen­si­ti­ve to her nu­an­ces- not that she had many, for she was a stri­kingly open per­son. No, she se­emed to be happy with him ta­king her le­aders­hip ro­le.</p>
   <p>    "If I co­uld find a do­ub­le to play El­ven­ba­ne for me, I'd do that in a he­art­be­at," she con­ti­nu­ed on­wards, ob­li­vi­o­us of his scru­tiny, "And then I co­uld just be Sha­na aga­in."</p>
   <p>    "Speaking of just be­ing Sha­na-oh crafty one-" he led her down a si­de pas­sa­ge that bro­ught them out on­to the top of the Ci­ta­del, in­to the warm air and suns­hi­ne, whe­re they co­uld sit and talk wit­ho­ut be­ing over­he­ard.</p>
   <p>    She didn't fling her­self down on­to the grass as she usu­al­ly did when bro­ught out­si­de. "Crafty one, hmm? I know what that means." She sa­un­te­red ca­su­al­ly up the hill a lit­tle ways to a grassy knoll with a sha­de-tree atop it-down­wind of the half-hid­den ent­ran­ce. Now they co­uld spe­ak wit­ho­ut be­ing over­he­ard. Only then did she drop down in­to the grass in the sun, with all of the ple­asu­re of her fos­ter-mot­her dra­gon in bas­king.</p>
   <p>    "Ask away," she sa­id, as he plop­ped down be­si­de her. "I've just spent the bet­ter part of the mor­ning tal­king to Ke­man but I ne­ed yo­ur help to re­ach Sha­dow."</p>
   <p>    Shana, fre­ed from the res­pon­si­bi­li­ti­es of the day-to-day run­ning of the Ci­ta­del, was con­cent­ra­ting on the vastly mo­re im­por­tant pro­j­ect of col­lec­ting in­tel­li­gen­ce re­ports, by me­ans of amp­li­fi­ed te­le­pathy, from Ke­man and so­me of the ot­her pe­op­le she and Lorryn had out in the gre­ater world. Alt­ho­ugh it wo­uld not be pos­sib­le to send eit­her a hu­man or a halfb­lo­od in­to the midst of El­ves to spy un­der a spell of il­lu­si­on, the halfb­lo­ods we­re not li­mi­ted to il­lu­si­on as long as they had dra­gons with them, for the dra­gons co­uld ac­tu­al­ly shift the­ir sha­pe to ap­pe­ar li­ke an­yo­ne or anyt­hing they li­ked. Sha­na's fos­ter-brot­her Ke­man and his pro­bab­le ma­te Do­ra we­re Sha­na's sha­pec­han­ged spi­es among both camps of El­ves.</p>
   <p>    "Your mot­her is not only do­ing well, so far as Do­ra can tell, she's ta­king over so­me of Lady Moth's du­ti­es on the ho­me-fi­elds," Sha­na told him, smi­ling at his sigh of re­li­ef. It might not be the most im­por­tant pi­ece of in­for­ma­ti­on, but it was the one that was most li­kely to re­li­eve his mind. "Do­ra thinks that she's pro­bably well over the shock of-well, you know-by now."</p>
   <p>    "I know I do her a dis­ser­vi­ce by thin­king of her as be­ing so fra­il," he rep­li­ed, cha­fing one fin­ger aga­inst anot­her ner­vo­usly, "But that's how she lo­oks. And she's my mot­her-"</p>
   <p>    "You can't help be­ing pro­tec­ti­ve of yo­ur mot­her, I know. I fe­el the sa­me way abo­ut my mot­her." By this, she me­ant not her re­al mot­her, who pre­su­mably had be­en an El­ven­lord's con­cu­bi­ne, but her fos­ter-mot­her, who was a dra­gon and not much in ne­ed of an­yo­ne's pro­tec­ti­on. But Lorryn ref­ra­ined from sa­ying this.</p>
   <p>    "Is the­re any chan­ge in the si­tu­ati­on the­re?" he as­ked, and Sha­na sho­ok her he­ad.</p>
   <p>    "Stalemate. The Old Lords can't bre­ak in and the Yo­ung Lords can't bre­ak out. Oc­ca­si­onal skir­mis­hes and fe­ints, but not­hing worth tal­king abo­ut. Lady Moth's no clo­ser to get­ting the Yo­ung Lords to see that hu­mans are-well-pe­op­le. And un­til she do­es, they're go­ing to be ig­no­ring the one re­so­ur­ce they ha­ve that might tip the sca­les in the­ir fa­vor." Sha­na so­un­ded cu­ri­o­usly in­dif­fe­rent to the si­tu­ati­on, mo­re as if it was a chess ga­me that she was ob­ser­ving, rat­her than pla­ying in. Lorryn won­de­red how she co­uld de­tach her­self from it so easily. He co­uldn't.</p>
   <p>    "Now, on the ot­her si­de-the­re's so­met­hing just co­me up that Ke­man thinks is go­ing to gi­ve the Old Lords the ad­van­ta­ge, and a ma­j­or one at that." She tos­sed her he­ad, and her "ta­il" switc­hed li­ke an im­pa­ti­ent hor­se's. "They've got a new com­man­der, and from what Ke­man says, he's ab­so­lu­tely bril­li­ant."</p>
   <p>    There was no in­dif­fe­ren­ce in her vo­ice now, and he sat up a bit stra­igh­ter. "A new com­man­der? Who? I tho­ught that the­re wasn't an Old Lord in the lot that co­uld co­or­di­na­te a pro­per at­tack!"</p>
   <p>    "Keman says his na­me is Kyrti­an. Kyrti­an V'dyll Lord Pras-ta­ran." She tur­ned her he­ad to lo­ok ke­enly in­to his eme­rald eyes with her own, the mark of the­ir El­ven­lord blo­od along with the po­in­ted ears and El­ven ma­gics. "He­ard of him?"</p>
   <p>    "Vaguely." And that, in and of it­self, was in­te­res­ting. It sug­ges­ted that for so­me re­ason the High Co­un­cil had ele­va­ted a no­body in­to a po­si­ti­on of ma­j­or im­por­tan­ce, with no steps in bet­we­en. "I think his fat­her was sup­po­sed to be a scho­lar-I know the­re was so­met­hing when I was a child abo­ut Lord Pras-ta­ran who va­nis­hed off in the Was­te Lands bet­we­en he­re and the si­te of the Ga­te that bro­ught us from Eve­lon." He wa­ved va­gu­ely in a so­ut­herly di­rec­ti­on. "He ke­eps-kept-to him­self, and his son did the sa­me. Un­til now. And why, one won­ders?"</p>
   <p>    "Apparently, be­ca­use he's bril­li­ant. And ac­cor­ding to Ke­man, be­ca­use he's got a way of tra­ining sla­ves to be sol­di­ers wit­ho­ut the un­tidy pro­cess of ha­ving half of them cut to rib­bons in or­der that the rest get ex­pe­ri­en­ce in figh­ting." She dram­med her fin­gers si­lently on the si­de of her leg. "And you re­ali­ze, of co­ur­se, that this is not go­od news for us."</p>
   <p>    "No." That was cle­ar eno­ugh; if this Kyrti­an was as bril­li­ant as Sha­na sa­id, he wasn't bo­und by tra­di­ti­on-he wo­uld use what wor­ked. Be­ing en­ca­sed in tra­di­ti­on li­ke a chrysa­lis ne­ver me­ant to be ope­ned was the only thing that kept the Old Lords from ham­me­ring the­ir less-expe­ri­en­ced of­fsp­ring.</p>
   <p>    "A go­od com­man­der with the re­so­ur­ces of the Old Lords be­hind him can ta­ke the de­fen­ses of the Yo­ung Lords to pi­eces," she con­ti­nu­ed, tur­ning her ga­ze in the di­rec­ti­on of El­ven-held lands.</p>
   <p>    "When he do­es that, he'll ha­ve pro­ved him­self to his mas­ters," Lorryn ag­re­ed. "And it won't ta­ke them any ti­me at all to bre­ak the tre­aty and send him af­ter us." He felt his sto­mach turn over une­asily. "I don't sup­po­se you ha­ve any go­od news for me, do you?" he as­ked pla­in­ti­vely.</p>
   <p>    She sho­ok off her own som­ber mo­od. "I know what you're thin­king, and you're right; un­til we know so­met­hing abo­ut this Kyrti­an, the­re is no po­int in ima­gi­ning all the things he might- or might not-do. Be­si­des, Me­ro and Re­na are do­ing very well for us, and the Iron Pe­op­le se­em to li­ke them a gre­at de­al."</p>
   <p>    "The Iron Pe­op­le hel­ped us hold off the El­ven­lords the last ti­me wit­ho­ut ac­tu­al­ly get­ting in­vol­ved-" Lorryn mu­sed, fe­eling a bit less hag-rid­den at the tho­ught of anot­her conf­lict with the El­ven­lords. "If they jo­ined us this ti­me-bet­we­en them and the dra­gons-"</p>
   <p>    "It might be the El­ven­lords do­ing the ret­re­ating," Sha­na fi­nis­hed for him. "One of Do­ra's la­ir is hel­ping them to find gra­zing and ore-and la­tely the­re ha­ve be­en small gro­ups of 'wild' hu­mans tur­ning up who spe­ak so­me di­alect that the Iron Pe­op­le un­ders­tand."</p>
   <p>    "Do you sup­po­se they co­uld be what is left of the Corn Pe­op­le?" Lorryn as­ked, his cu­ri­osity now pi­qu­ed.</p>
   <p>    Shana shrug­ged. "They co­uld just be Tra­ders-we knew al­re­ady that the Iron Pe­op­le ha­ve had so­me con­tact with Tra­ders. Ke­man says they are slowly brin­ging in the­ir fa­mi­li­es and de­pen­dents to jo­in the en­camp­ment, and so­me of them ha­ve be­en sa­ying it's sa­fer than hi­ding in the wil­der­ness. They do know far­ming, tho­ugh-"</p>
   <p>    "Grazing-and far­mers to help with crops." Lorryn pul­led a grass stem to chew on it. "That wo­uld su­it the Iron Pe­op­le down to the bo­ne. They'd pre­fer to ma­ke a set­tle­ment, if they can. It's hard to run pro­per for­ges un­less you're set­tled. Did you tell Me­ro abo­ut this new El­ven com­man­der?"</p>
   <p>    She nod­ded. "I told him to pass the in­for­ma­ti­on on, as he se­es fit. The­re's be­en a comp­li­ca­ti­on; we re­al­ly ne­ed to find a re­li­ab­le so­ur­ce of iron. Me­ro and Re­na can't do anyt­hing abo­ut fin­ding so­me, and if we're go­ing to ke­ep the Iron Pe­op­le as al­li­es, we ha­ve to get a dra­gon to find us a mi­ne."</p>
   <p>    "That re­minds me-we've got an iron-re­la­ted prob­lem of our own." Lorryn wis­hed pro­fo­undly that Ca­el­lach Gwa­in wasn't at the he­art of so many of his prob­lems. "The­re is anot­her prob­lem among the wi­zards so far as Ca­el­lach Gwa­in and his cro­ni­es are con­cer­ned."</p>
   <p>    "The ma­gic-twis­ting." Sha­na ma­de a fa­ce. "Well, we've known abo­ut that for as long as we've had any amo­unt of iron aro­und us; you just inc­re­ase yo­ur fo­cus to get aro­und the way the ma­gic warps. Or you use the warp-I've se­en Ori­en ac­tu­al­ly lob a le­vin-bolt aro­und a cor­ner! What's the prob­lem?"</p>
   <p>    "Younger wi­zards can le­arn how to de­al with it, be­ca­use they're used to using se­mi-pre­ci­o­us sto­nes as fo­cu­ses. Ca­el­lach just do­esn't want the iron aro­und, at all. So far as he's con­cer­ned, it's one mo­re Chan­ge in the Way Things We­re, and that's what he wants to go back to." Lorryn sig­hed, and felt his he­adac­he co­ming back. Why was it that so many of the prob­lems se­emed to be­gin and end in Ca­el­lach Gwa­in?</p>
   <p>    "He's just lazy," Sha­na snor­ted.</p>
   <p>    "Well-I ag­ree, he is, but not all of the ol­der wi­zards are, and they're ha­ving the sa­me prob­lems adj­us­ting. And they aren't comp­la­ining, they're just suf­fe­ring qu­i­etly."</p>
   <p>    "Suffering?" Sha­na ra­ised a skep­ti­cal eyeb­row.</p>
   <p>    "Well, not suf­fe­ring then, but it's hard for the old ones. They aren't as fit, they aren't as he­althy, and it's har­der for them to le­arn new things. No­ne of it's out of stub­born­ness." He felt very sorry for them-he'd se­en so­me of them strug­gling to use a fo­cus-sto­ne to do things that pre-ado­les­cents we­re ac­comp­lis­hing wit­ho­ut a tho­ught. He'd watc­hed them suf­fer with ac­hing jo­ints and co­ughs and colds from li­ving in ca­verns rat­her than the com­for­tab­le ro­oms of the old Ci­ta­del. Most im­por­tantly, he'd se­en them dis­he­ar­te­ned and frust­ra­ted, thin­king that af­ter all of the­ir ye­ars in hi­ding, they we­re now con­si­de­red to be lit­tle bet­ter than use­less.</p>
   <p>    "I know." It was her turn to sigh. "It's not fa­ir, is it? If it wasn't for them, I wo­uldn't be he­re. But I don't know what to do abo­ut it. We can't stop things from chan­ging-"</p>
   <p>    "No, but-let me think abo­ut this one." He of­fe­red her a shy smi­le. "You've sa­id it yo­ur­self; you're the one that's go­od with plans and stra­tegy, I'm the one that's go­od with pe­op­le. May­be we can find a way to turn all this to our ad­van­ta­ge."</p>
   <p>    "How?" That skep­ti­cal lo­ok aga­in-but this ti­me he had just the glim­me­ring of an idea, and he met her ga­ze firmly.</p>
   <p>    "I don't know-but the­re's al­ways pos­si­bi­li­ti­es, as long as you ke­ep yo­ur eyes open for them." And on that po­si­ti­ve no­te, he got to his fe­et and of­fe­red her his hand. "Let's go ta­ke a walk and blow the cob­webs out of our bra­ins be­fo­re we go back to work."</p>
   <p>    "Cobwebs do get in the way of cle­ar sight," she ag­re­ed, to his gre­at ple­asu­re. "And I co­uld use a walk-with you."</p>
   <p>    And tho­se last two words inc­re­ased his ple­asu­re ten­fold.</p>

   <p>    Rena had be­en wor­king hard most of yes­ter­day, chan­ging gras­ses and le­aves with her el­ven ma­gic in­to swe­et tre­ats with which the Iron Pe­op­le co­uld lu­re in the yo­ung bulls for the­ir first les­sons in be­ing ac­cus­to­med to sad­dles and be­ing rid­den. Hor­ses co­uld be bro­ken to sad­dle-it was not the best way to te­ach them, but it was suc­ces­sful-but bulls, ne­ver. The­ir stub­born na­tu­res and the gre­at co­ura­ge bred in­to the­ir li­ne ma­de it im­pos­sib­le to bre­ak the­ir spi­rit, so the only way to tra­in them for the­ir du­ti­es as war-bul­ls was to be­gin by temp­ting them, gently, in­to cap­ti­vity, and re­war­ding them for every sign of co­ope­ra­ti­on with the one thing they al­ways res­pon­ded to-food. Mo­re spe­ci­fi­cal­ly, a tre­at, a tas­te they co­uldn't find on the­ir own. Li­ke pe­op­le, cat­tle had a swe­et to­oth, and now that Re­na was ac­ting as an en­voy to the­se pe­op­le, she was de­ter­mi­ned to do everyt­hing that she co­uld to bring the we­ight of debt over to the wi­zards' si­de of the sca­les. If that me­ant that she spent half a day chan­ging grass in­to the go­odi­es with which the bull-tra­iners co­uld re­ward the­ir ani­mals, so be it.</p>
   <p>    The ma­gic that el­ven la­di­es we­re tra­di­ti­onal­ly tra­ined in was a gent­le art of trans­for­ma­ti­on, which they usu­al­ly used to ta­ilor gar­ments se­am­les­sly to fit li­ke sil­ken skins, to sculpt flo­wers in­to gos­sa­mer and fan­tas­tic sha­pes, or to ma­ke ot­her cos­me­tic chan­ges. Re­na had le­ar­ned to use it to turn the re­la­ti­vely ine­dib­le in­to edib­le and tasty-and, at ne­ed, to stop a be­ating he­art. It had la­tely oc­cur­red to her that she co­uld al­so use it to start a he­art that had stop­ped, or per­haps to cu­re di­se­ase or mend a wo­und, but she had not yet had the op­por­tu­nity (or the co­ura­ge) to try.</p>
   <p>    The nor­mal no­ise of the camp wo­ke her just af­ter dawn; the so­unds of vo­ices and co­oking, the far-off lo­wing of the cat­tle herds. She li­ved with the Iron Pri­est, Di­ric, and his wi­fe Ka­la. The gre­at fri­end of the El­ven­ba­ne Las­ha­na, halfb­lo­oded Me­ro, who was openly co­ur­ting Re­na, al­so li­ved with them, but Ka­la watc­hed over both of them with as stern an eye to prop­ri­ety as if Re­na was the­ir own child. Di­ric and Ka­la had gi­ven them se­pa­ra­te sle­eping-cham­bers on op­po­si­te si­des of the fa­mily tent. Re­na fo­und that re­as­su­ring; ra­ised as a shel­te­red el­ven ma­iden, iso­la­ted, for the most part, from all ma­les but her brot­her and fat­her, she enj­oyed Me­ro's at­ten­ti­ons but she was al­so un­com­for­tably shy abo­ut be­ing co­ur­ted. Not that she wan­ted him to stop! By no me­ans. But she was not yet pre­pa­red to go any furt­her than a he­si­tant kiss or two.</p>
   <p>    Still, wa­king up in the co­ol of the dawn, with the bust­le of the camp aro­und her and a bre­ath of bre­eze car­rying the scents of grass and the smo­ke from dung-fi­res waf­ting un­der the skirts of the tent, she felt just a lit­tle lo­nely in her so­li­tary bed.</p>
   <p>    Lorryn isn 't so shy-but then, Lorryn isn 't a girl. She sig­hed. I wish I was li­ke Sha­na. Sha­na is al­ways so strong, so bra­ve, and she ne­ver wor­ri­es abo­ut what pe­op­le will think. She wondered if Sha­na and Lorryn sha­red a bed; she won­de­red, in the fre­edom of tho­ught that be­ing only half-awa­ke lent to her, just what went on when one did sha­re a bed. Me­ro's ca­re­ful kis­ses and ca­res­ses sent stran­ge sen­sa­ti­ons thro­ugh her; ple­asant, oh my yes, but stran­ge. Su­rely it wasn't-well-li­ke the cat­tle, or the birds of her gar­den…</p>
   <p>    Her tho­ughts drif­ted; she lis­te­ned to the che­er­ful vo­ices of wo­men pre­pa­ring the mor­ning me­al out­si­de. She li­ked the so­und of the­ir vo­ices; they we­re de­eper than tho­se of the wo­men she was used to, even the hu­man sla­ves. Lo­vely! Ins­te­ad of that an­no­ying bird-li­ke twit­ter, this was a me­lo­di­o­us mur­mur.</p>
   <p>    Then, of co­ur­se, the mo­od was bro­ken as a child did so­met­hing wrong, its mot­her ra­ised her vo­ice in a scold, and anot­her child be­gan to cry in sympathy. Re­na wo­ke en­ti­rely at that, and la­ug­hed at her­self and her no­ti­ons; how typi­cal of an el­ven girl to try and cast a spe­ci­o­us gla­mo­rie over so­met­hing rich and sa­tisf­ying in and of it­self, if less than per­fect and not at all tran­qu­il.</p>
   <p>    She stretc­hed, yaw­ned, and wrig­gled out of her blan­kets, gi­ving her­self a qu­ick wash in the le­at­her buc­ket of wa­ter that sto­od just in­si­de the flap that con­nec­ted her por­ti­on of the tent with that of Di­ric's wi­fe. The Iron Pe­op­le wo­re lo­ose and com­for­tab­le clot­hing per­fectly su­ited to the­ir no­ma­dic way of li­fe. Ka­la had fit­ted Re­na out with the outg­rown clot­hing of her el­dest da­ugh­ter-well su­ited to the slim bu­ild of an el­ven fe­ma­le. Wo­men of the­se pe­op­le eit­her wo­re a si­mi­lar out­fit to the men-lo­ose tro­users with a drawst­ring wa­ist and a sle­eve­less, v-nec­ked shirt-or long, emb­ro­ide­red gowns fit­ted to the wa­ist with a pa­ir of ti­es in the back. In eit­her ca­se, the co­lors we­re earthy and bold. Re­na co­uld not ima­gi­ne anyt­hing less li­ke the gowns she had on­ce worn in the bo­wer, with the­ir tra­iling hems and sle­eves, tightly-la­ced wa­ists, and pas­tel co­lors, all in the most de­li­ca­te silks and sa­tins.</p>
   <p>    Today she slip­ped in­to one of the dres­ses, a warm brown li­nen that wo­uld ha­ve ma­de her lo­ok li­ke a ble­ac­hed-out lit­tle wax doll if she still lo­oked li­ke the pal­lid, ti­mid girl who had es­ca­ped from her fat­her's ma­nor. But alt­ho­ugh she still had the pa­le sil­ver-gilt ha­ir of that girl, her skin was a warm ivory, sunkissed and glo­wing with he­alth, and the­re was not­hing that was ble­ac­hed abo­ut her any­mo­re.</p>
   <p>    She sig­hed, tho­ugh, as she pul­led the dress on over her he­ad and ti­ed the straps be­hind her back. Her first duty, to­day as ever, was to see if she co­uld do anyt­hing with the cap­ti­ve El­ven­lord, Hal­dor.</p>
   <p>    As if the­re was anyt­hing lord-li­ke abo­ut him now!</p>
   <p>    Neither Hal­dor, nor his fel­low-cap­ti­ve Kel­yan, we­re en­ti­rely sa­ne any­mo­re, but Hal­dor was wor­se. When she and Me­ro had co­me back to the camp of the Iron Pe­op­le, one of the first things that Di­ric had re­qu­es­ted of her was to see if anyt­hing co­uld be do­ne abo­ut the two cap­ti­ves, who had be­en ta­ken by the gre­at-grand­si­res of the cur­rent Iron Pe­op­le and pres­sed in­to ser­vi­ce as en­ter­ta­iners, using the­ir ma­gic to cre­ate il­lu­si­ons. They cle­arly co­uldn't re­le­ase eit­her of the El­ves, for even if they we­ren't men­tal­ly com­pe­tent any­mo­re, they still knew too much-and they co­uldn't gi­ve them over to the Wi­zards eit­her, at le­ast not in Re­na's opi­ni­on. In the ti­me they'd be­en go­ne, Hal­dor had lap­sed in­to a stu­por or tor­por and co­uld scar­cely be ro­used eno­ugh to eat. It had fal­len upon his fel­low cap­ti­ve Kel­yan to ta­ke ca­re of him, but at le­ast they we­re no lon­ger for­ced to en­ter­ta­in the Iron Pe­op­le, and thanks to Re­na's trans­for­ma­ti­ve ma­gics the­ir di­et was so­met­hing ot­her than curds, milk, and me­at.</p>
   <p>    She ha­ted go­ing ne­ar them, to tell the truth. She wasn't af­ra­id of them, but the­re wasn't anyt­hing she co­uld re­al­ly do for them eit­her. She had the rat­her sick fe­eling that they we­re both too far go­ne to help. If only the­re was so­me way to wi­pe the­ir minds cle­an of everyt­hing that had hap­pe­ned to them sin­ce they'd be­en cap­tu­red! Then they co­uld be put to sle­ep and set down by a dra­gon so­mew­he­re-per­haps whe­re one of the El-ven­lords' tra­ding-ca­ra­vans cros­sed-</p>
   <p>    She pa­used, one hand on the tent-flap. That's no bad idea, she tho­ught, struck by the no­ti­on. And may­be Me­ro is the one who co­uld do just that! Me­ro, li­ke all the halfb­lo­ods, had both the ma­gics of his hu­man mot­her, and tho­se of his El­ven fat­her. The hu­man ma­gics inc­lu­ded the abi­lity to un­ders­tand the tho­ughts of ot­hers-co­uld Me­ro chan­ge them as well?</p>
   <p>    She lif­ted the par­ti­ti­on-flap, in­ten­ding to ask him as so­on as she saw him, but to her di­sap­po­int­ment, he was now­he­re to be fo­und. Ne­it­her was Di­ric, for that mat­ter; only Ka­la was in the part of the tent that ser­ved as a com­mon area for eating and so­ci­al func­ti­ons. The Iron Pri­est's amp­le wi­fe was bent over her bre­ak­fast-pre­pa­ra­ti­ons, and lo­oked up at Re­na's ent­ran­ce, her te­eth shi­ning in a start­lingly whi­te smi­le aga­inst her dark brown skin.</p>
   <p>    The Iron Pe­op­le we­re un­li­ke any hu­mans that Re­na had ever se­en; the­ir skins we­re a black-bron­ze (ne­arer to black than to bron­ze) and the­ir ebony ha­ir cur­led mo­re tightly than she­ep's fle­ece. No­mads, tho­ugh not by na­tu­re, they des­cen­ded from a long li­ne of cat­tle-, go­at-, and grel-bre­eders who­se re­li­gi­on and li­ves cen­te­red aro­und the­ir for­ges. In the long-ago when the El-ven­lords first ca­me to this world, they had a clo­se al­li­an­ce with anot­her hu­man ra­ce of far­mers, now va­nis­hed, cal­led the Corn Pe­op­le. The Iron Pe­op­le pro­vi­ded the "me­aty" si­de of the di­etary equ­ati­on, the Corn Pe­op­le the gra­ins and ve­ge­tab­les. The Iron Pe­op­le wor­ked in le­at­her and me­tal, the Corn Pe­op­le in pot­tery and fab­ric. Then the El­ven­lords had des­cen­ded, and dro­ve the mo­re-mo­bi­le Iron Pe­op­le in­to the so­uth, pre­su­mably ad­ding the Corn Pe­op­le to the­ir long list of sla­ve-na­ti­ons.</p>
   <p>    "There is anot­her gro­up of Corn Pe­op­le co­me," Ka­la sa­id che­er­ful­ly. "Di­ric and Me­ro ha­ve go­ne to spe­ak with them. I ex­pect them back be­fo­re too long; they went off wit­ho­ut any fo­od, and I ha­ve ne­ver yet se­en a man who can do wit­ho­ut his mor­ning me­al wit­ho­ut be­co­ming cross."</p>
   <p>    Rena la­ug­hed, and went out­si­de to the­ir lit­tle fi­re to help Ka­la with her me­al-pre­pa­ra­ti­ons.</p>
   <p>    Ever sin­ce the Iron Pe­op­le had ar­ri­ved in what now ap­pe­ared to be the­ir an­ci­ent pas­tu­ra­ge, this pla­in be­low the mo­un­ta­ins whe­re the Wi­zards and Tra­der­kin li­ved, small gro­ups of pe­op­le with flax-co­lo­red ha­ir had be­en drif­ting in­to the­ir camp, cla­iming the right of an­ci­ent al­li­an­ce. They re­semb­led the desc­rip­ti­ons that Lorryn had re­ad in the old his­to­ri­es, and they cer­ta­inly spo­ke a lan­gu­age si­mi­lar to that of the Iron Pe­op­le, so the­re was every re­ason to think that they we­re the rem­nants of the Corn Pe­op­le.</p>
   <p>    Certainly Di­ric's folk be­li­eved it and wel­co­med them as long-lost kin. Me­ro was per­fectly ple­ased to see them co­ming to the Iron Folk; if the old al­li­an­ce co­uld be re-estab­lis­hed, with the Corn Pe­op­le far­ming part of the pla­ins for gra­in, the fi­ber-crops of hemp and flax, and ve­ge­tab­les as they on­ce had, the Iron Pe­op­le wo­uld ha­ve one mo­re re­ason to set­tle. The­re was plenty of go­od gra­zing he­re; all they ne­eded to be per­fectly happy was a ste­ady supply of iron ore.</p>
   <p>    If we can in­du­ce them to set­tle-if we co­uld just work out a way to find them eno­ugh iron! she tho­ught, hel­ping Ka­la by spre­ading the thin bat­ter for mor­ning ca­kes on the hot sto­ne that ser­ved her as an oven. All of the fa­mi­li­es had such a sto­ne, flat and black, po­lis­hed smo­oth, which ser­ved as a co­oking sur­fa­ce or to ke­ep fo­ods or li­qu­ids warm, and they we­re che­ris­hed as the im­por­tant obj­ects they we­re. The thin, to­ugh pan­ca­kes that they used for bre­ad we­re co­oked on the­se sto­nes, eggs co­uld be fri­ed atop them, pots of tea or so­up kept warm on them. They we­re bu­ri­ed in co­als to he­at them for co­oking, the co­als and as­hes brus­hed to one si­de when the sur­fa­ce was ne­eded.</p>
   <p>    Rena spre­ad the bat­ter atop the sto­ne with cir­cu­lar mo­ti­ons of a horn spo­on; Ka­la per­for­med the tric­ki­er task of jud­ging when the thin ca­kes we­re do­ne eno­ugh to pe­el off and flip, and she did it with fin­gers to­ug­he­ned by many ye­ars of wor­king at her own jewelry-for­ge. Re­na wo­uldn't ha­ve da­red to try; she'd ha­ve co­me up with blis­ters on the tips of every fin­ger.</p>
   <p>    The fi­nis­hed ca­kes, pa­per-thin and tasty, we­re tos­sed in­to a bas­ket to wa­it. Bre­ak­fast was al­ways ca­kes, milk, a lit­tle che­ese or me­at, and wha­te­ver fru­it co­uld be fo­und. The­re we­re bramb­les out he­re, and the ber­ri­es we­re just co­ming ri­pe. Re­na her­self had gat­he­red so­me yes­ter­day, af­ter che­ating a bit by sof­te­ning the thorns with her ma­gic so that they wo­uldn't stick her whi­le she gat­he­red the fru­it.</p>
   <p>    Just as they fi­nis­hed the last of the bat­ter, they he­ard the vo­ices of the two men: Di­ric's a low, che­er­ful rumb­le li­ke the whe­els of a he­avy cart on a bumpy ro­ad, Me­ro's a cle­ar te­nor.</p>
   <p>    "-I ha­ven't any idea whe­re this 'Lord Kyrti­an' ca­me from," Me­ro was sa­ying as they ca­me aro­und the si­de of the ro­und tent. "The­re cer­ta­inly wasn't any El­ven­lord com­man­der by that na­me when I had any re­gu­lar con­tact with the El­ven­lords."</p>
   <p>    By that Re­na re­ali­zed that Me­ro had be­en catc­hing the Iron Pri­est up on what he'd be­en told last night when Sha­na had fi­nal­ly be­en ab­le to re­ach him with her tho­ughts.</p>
   <p>    "But this can me­an very lit­tle to us," Di­ric obj­ec­ted, then pa­used to bend and gi­ve his wi­fe a mor­ning-kiss by way of a gre­eting. He was a tall, ro­und-fa­ced hu­man, he­avily musc­led- not surp­ri­sing, gi­ven that he was the chi­ef Pri­est of a re­li­gi­on that cen­te­red aro­und the for­ge. Re­na was no go­od at jud­ging the ages of hu­mans, but Me­ro sa­id he gu­es­sed that both Di­ric and Ka­la we­re pro­bably in the­ir fif­ti­es. "Ka­la, my rock-do­ve, the yo­ung one tells me that the De­mons ha­ve a new War-Cap­ta­in in the­ir bat­tle with the­ir own re­bel­li­o­us yo­uth. This one se­ems to ha­ve rat­her mo­re sen­se than the last, and is ma­king prog­ress in his cam­pa­ign to bring them to he­el. Me­ro is con­cer­ned that this co­uld me­an tro­ub­le for us."</p>
   <p>    "This can ha­ve very lit­tle to do with us," Ka­la ag­re­ed comp­la­cently. "Except, per­haps, go­od. Let them con­cent­ra­te on each ot­her and for­get that we are he­re."</p>
   <p>    "But that's just what won't hap­pen if this Kyrti­an is suc­ces­sful, don't you see?" Me­ro obj­ec­ted, as Re­na nod­ded vi­go­ro­usly.</p>
   <p>    But the gray-ha­ired Iron Pri­est only sho­ok his he­ad. "Ti­me eno­ugh to be con­cer­ned if it hap­pens," he res­pon­ded with a shrug. "My pe­op­le will be mo­re fret­ful that the­ir for­ges are dark than that so­me war among De­mons has pos­sibly ta­ken anot­her turn."</p>
   <p>    Mero bit his lip and lo­oked to Re­na for help, but she co­uldn't of­fer him any. Di­ric was right; the Iron Pe­op­le hadn't had to en­ga­ge the El­ven­lords in com­bat for ge­ne­ra­ti­ons, and le­gends we­re un­li­kely to aro­use any an­xi­ety in the­ir he­arts at this po­int. But the lack of iron for the­ir for­ges was a prob­lem, and a cur­rent, even ur­gent one.</p>
   <p>    It was a con­cern for the Wi­zards, as well-the Yo­ung Lords' Re­bel­li­on had be­en gro­un­ded on the fo­un­da­ti­on of the iron jewelry that the Iron Pe­op­le had ma­de and the Wi­zards had dist­ri­bu­ted. We­aring this jewelry, the re­bels-not just yo­un­ger sons, but the abu­sed and re­vi­led Les­ser Lords with very lit­tle ma­gic, who of­ten we­re tre­ated as badly as any hu­man sla­ve-we­re pro­tec­ted from the Gre­at Lords' ma­gic. For the first ti­me, they we­re ab­le to act wit­ho­ut fe­ar of le­vin-bolt and pa­raly­zing pa­in, and act they had.</p>
   <p>    But that had used up the scant sto­re of raw iron, and the Iron Pe­op­le we­re grumb­ling abo­ut the lack of ma­te­ri­al to work with and won­de­ring if the­ir sac­ri­fi­ce to help sa­ve the Wi­zards by gi­ving the Gre­at Lords a new thre­at to worry abo­ut had be­en worth it. So far, the only bits of iron that the dra­gons had be­en ab­le to find had be­en co­axed out of the gro­und and drop­ped as raw lumps bet­we­en the ter­ri­tory cla­imed by the Wi­zards and the strong­holds of the El­ves. They for­med a bar­ri­er of pro­tec­ti­on, dif­fi­cult to find and dis­rup­ti­ve far out of pro­por­ti­on to the­ir small si­ze, and the Wi­zards we­re very re­luc­tant to re­mo­ve them, ho­we­ver badly the Iron Pe­op­le wan­ted them.</p>
   <p>    The pla­in fact was that the Iron Pe­op­le we­re not go­ing to ma­ke any mo­re of the­ir jewelry for the Wi­zards un­less and un­til the Wi­zards ca­me up with mo­re iron. And the supply of jewelry to sne­ak in among the re­bels had long ago run out. How much mo­re dis­rup­ti­on co­uld be ac­comp­lis­hed if simp­le iron tor­qu­es co­uld be sent in among the hu­man sla­ves? Tho­se iron bands co­uld ne­ga­te the ma­gic that cont­rol­led the sla­ves thro­ugh the­ir col­lars-with them, es­ca­pes co­uld be suc­ces­sful, and even the ta­ke­over of an en­ti­re es­ta­te. Wit­ho­ut them-not­hing wo­uld chan­ge. If this Lord Kyrti­an ma­na­ged to con­qu­er the Yo­ung Lords by po­wer of arms alo­ne, the Wi­zards wo­uld des­pe­ra­tely ne­ed anot­her di­ver­si­on to ke­ep the El­ven­lords oc­cu­pi­ed, and the hu­man sla­ves co­uld only lo­ok for­ward to mo­re abu­se, mo­re rep­res­si­on.</p>
   <p>    Diric ate his bre­ak­fast with a pla­cid fa­ce, ob­li­vi­o­us to the con­cerns of his gu­ests. "The Tra­der-pe­op­le are to co­me, al­so, at last," he of­fe­red, bet­we­en bi­tes. "One of the new Corn Pe­op­le told me that they we­re fol­lo­wing no mo­re than a few days be­hind, with bur­dens of tra­de-go­ods. I am eager to see them, and I think the rest will be al­so."</p>
   <p>    Rena smi­led, des­pi­te her con­cerns. "I ha­ve no do­ubt," she rep­li­ed, thin­king of the ex­ci­te­ment that each new bo­at­lo­ad of Tra­ders ca­used among the Wi­zards.</p>
   <p>    "They are go­od pe­op­le," Me­ro of­fe­red. "You won't be sorry that you de­ci­ded to open full tra­de with them."</p>
   <p>    "So you sa­id in co­un­cil, tho­ugh the­re are still tho­se of my folk who think we sho­uld simply ta­ke them as sla­ves and ha­ve them and the­ir go­ods." The gle­am in Di­ric's eye re­min­ded Re­na that the Iron Pe­op­le we­re qu­ite used to the idea of ha­ving ot­her hu­mans as sla­ves. The­re we­ren't many sla­ves among the tents, mostly ton Pe­op­le who had be­en sold by the­ir pa­rents or who had sold them­sel­ves to re­pay debts, but they did exist. Me­ro had be­en rat­her ta­ken aback when he dis­co­ve­red the­ir exis­ten­ce.</p>
   <p>    "And I po­in­ted out then, as I will re­pe­at, that it will be far mo­re pro­fi­tab­le to tra­de ho­no­rably. If you ta­ke them and the­ir go­ods," Me­ro re­min­ded the Iron Pri­est shrewdly, "you will only ha­ve a few sla­ves and the go­ods they car­ri­ed. No mo­re will co­me to you. But if you tra­de-mo­re will po­ur in­to yo­ur camp, and you will li­kely be ab­le to bar­ter what is com­mon to you for what is worth a gre­at de­al to you."</p>
   <p>    "Eh, now, did I say that I did not fe­el the sa­me way?" Di­ric as­ked, in­ge­nu­o­usly, pre­ten­ding that he had ne­ver even en­ter­ta­ined the no­ti­on, alt­ho­ugh both Re­na and Me­ro knew how hard they had ar­gu­ed to sway him to the­ir way of thin­king. This wo­uld be one mo­re hold on the Iron Pe­op­le, one mo­re re­ason for them to stay he­re ins­te­ad of lo­oking for anot­her spot to set­tle. Right now, with a gro­wing num­ber of vo­ices cal­ling for anot­her mo­ve to so­me pla­ce that might ha­ve mo­re to of­fer than just wa­ter and gra­zing, the Tra­ders co­uld pro­vi­de what Me­ro and Re­na ne­eded un­til so­me­how, so­mew­he­re, they co­uld co­me up with a so­ur­ce for the all-impor­tant iron.</p>
   <p>    The Tra­ders ar­ri­ved ri­ding on-of all imp­ro­bab­le things- pack-grels. The­se inc­re­dibly ugly ani­mals, long-leg­ged, long-nec­ked, with bul­ging eyes and blub­bery lips, ser­ved the tra­ding-ca­ra­vans in­to the de­sert com­man­ded by the El­ven­lords, but Me­ro had hardly ex­pec­ted that the Tra­der-clans wo­uld ha­ve any. Up un­til this po­int, he had tho­ught that they tra­ve­led exc­lu­si­vely afo­ot or on wa­ter.</p>
   <p>    The Iron Pe­op­le we­re just as surp­ri­sed, and even mo­re ex­ci­ted to see a half-do­zen of the cre­atu­res they them­sel­ves had once de­pen­ded on. In the ol­dest chro­nic­les, the Iron Pe­op­le had even be­en re­fer­red to as the "grel-ri­ders." It was only when they had be­en dri­ven so­uth that they had lost the grels, which had not sur­vi­ved the ar­du­o­us jo­ur­ney and the new pests that the cat­tle had shrug­ged off.</p>
   <p>    The grels we­re less ent­hu­sed to see the­se new dark-skin­ned hu­mans-they had no long tra­di­ti­on of as­so­ci­ati­on, and they shi­ed and bel­lo­wed at the un­fa­mi­li­ar dark fa­ces, much to the Iron Pe­op­le's di­sap­po­int­ment.</p>
   <p>    "I'm sorry, but they aren't very bright, and they think anyt­hing they don't re­cog­ni­ze is go­ing to eat them," the grel-hand­ler kept sa­ying, over and over, stumb­ling a lit­tle over the un­fa­mi­li­ar syllab­les of the Iron Pe­op­les' ton­gue. Even­tu­al­ly, when the be­asts re­fu­sed to co­ope­ra­te, the cu­ri­o­us got over the­ir di­sap­po­int­ment and set­tled down to se­ri­o­us tra­ding.</p>
   <p>    Each si­de la­id out the go­ods that they had bro­ught. The Iron Pe­op­le of­fe­red hi­des, dri­ed me­at, bas­kets, or­na­men­tal be­ad-work, skil­led le­at­her work, horn bows, and we­aving. They had li­nen-flax grew abun­dantly on the pla­ins, and out­ri­ders ma­de su­re that the cat­tle didn't de­vo­ur it be­fo­re the wo­men had a chan­ce to gat­her it. They did not ha­ve she­ep, alt­ho­ugh they did ha­ve go­ats and we­re skil­led at spin­ning and we­aving go­at-ha­ir. The Tra­ders had raw wo­ol, glass, sto­ne, and pot­tery obj­ects, flo­ur and salt, so­me very spe­ci­fic wo­od pro­ducts-li­ke long­bows of yew, which the war­ri­ors we­re very imp­res­sed with- and ar­row­he­ads, which we­re al­ways in short supply. They al­so had so­me cop­per trin­kets, cop­per pots, and a few in­gots of cop­per. But most of all, of co­ur­se, the Iron Pe­op­le re­al­ly wan­ted iron mo­re than anyt­hing el­se, and at the ini­ti­al tra­ding ses­si­on it was cle­ar to Re­na that they we­re di­sap­po­in­ted not to see any.</p>
   <p>    Still, they co­ve­red the­ir di­sap­po­int­ment well, and tra­ding on the first day pro­ce­eded briskly. At the end of the day, Hal­kan, the spo­kes­man and le­ader of this par­ti­cu­lar gro­up, in­vi­ted the im­por­tant mem­bers of the tri­be to din­ner in his tent, and inc­lu­ded Me­ro and Re­na in on the in­vi­ta­ti­on mo­re out of po­li­te­ness than anyt­hing el­se. The Tra­der clans had a set of firm ag­re­ements with the Wi­zards, and it wasn't as if he co­uld ha­ve ex­pec­ted anyt­hing new out of two en­voys to the­se odd, ebony-skin­ned folk.</p>
   <p>    Mero had ne­ver se­en an ac­tu­al camp of the Tra­der clans be­fo­re, and lo­oked aro­und with li­vely in­te­rest as they ac­com­pa­ni­ed Di­ric and Ka­la to the mo­dest fe­ast. The Iron Pe­op­le li­ved in ro­und tents const­ruc­ted of hi­des and felt; the Tra­ders had squ­are and rec­tan­gu­lar pa­vi­li­ons of sturdy he­avily-wa­xed cloth. Be­ne­ath the wax, ran­dom pat­terns of blotc­hes of gre­en and brown had be­en pa­in­ted on the can­vas, and he tho­ught that it wo­uld be dif­fi­cult to spot such tents in the mid­dle of a fo­rest. Out he­re, of co­ur­se, they lo­oked a bit odd.</p>
   <p>    All aro­und the outs­kirts of the camp we­re wic­ker ca­ges on po­les; they we­ren't torc­hes or lamps, and Me­ro co­uldn't even gu­ess what func­ti­on they we­re sup­po­sed to ser­ve. As they all to­ok the­ir pla­ces be­ne­ath an or­na­men­tal pa­vi­li­on to enj­oy the­ir hosts' hos­pi­ta­lity, he fo­und that the Tra­ders had elec­ted to pla­ce the­ir gu­ests on flat cus­hi­ons aro­und a cent­ral ser­ving area, with Tra­ders al­ter­na­ting with the­ir gu­ests. That put one of the Tra­ders (a ner­vo­us, thin fel­low) bet­we­en him and Re­na, which was a lit­tle an­no­ying. He was wor­ri­ed that she might be un­com­for­tab­le with the se­ating ar­ran­ge­ments, but he hadn't rec­ko­ned with her early tra­ining-if she was un­com­for­tab­le bet­we­en two stran­gers, she didn't show it.</p>
   <p>    Mero mostly stuck to small-talk with his two ne­igh­bors, al­lo­wing Di­ric and his fel­low chi­efs to mo­no­po­li­ze the con­ver­sa­ti­on. But just as they we­re ser­ved a des­sert of ho­ney-drenc­hed fru­its (from the Tra­ders' sto­res) and be­aten cre­am (sup­pli­ed by the Iron Pe­op­le), so­met­hing re­min­ded him of tho­se cu­ri­o­us wic­ker ca­ges and he as­ked abo­ut them.</p>
   <p>    Out of co­ur­tesy, so that the Iron Pe­op­le co­uld un­ders­tand everyt­hing that was sa­id aro­und the circ­le, they both spo­ke in the Iron Pe­op­les' ton­gue. "Ah! Tho­se are to pro­tect us from the De­mons and the­ir ma­gic," sa­id the yo­ung Tra­der who­se na­me Me­ro hadn't ca­ught. "We put fo­ol's gold in them, and it works as the iron jewelry do­es."</p>
   <p>    Heads snap­ped in the­ir di­rec­ti­on from all aro­und the circ­le the mo­ment that the word "iron" was spo­ken. "What is this?" Di­ric de­man­ded.</p>
   <p>    The Clan-chi­ef exp­la­ined, and tri­ed to desc­ri­be the con­tents of the ward-bas­kets in such a way that the Iron Pe­op­le wo­uld un­ders­tand, but Di­ric was baf­fled. "Wa­it-" he sa­id, fi­nal­ly, and sent one of the yo­un­ger Tra­ders to fetch one of the bas­kets-.</p>
   <p>    In front of Di­ric's in­te­res­ted ga­ze, he ope­ned the top of the bas­ket and po­ured out abo­ut three fist­ful­ls worth of glit­te­ring, gold-co­lo­red sto­nes with ro­ugh sur­fa­ces. "Fo­ol's gold," the Tra­der-chi­ef sa­id dis­mis­si­vely. "Fo­ols think it is re­al gold; it is go­od only for ke­eping the-"</p>
   <p>    He stop­ped, his fa­ce a study in be­wil­der­ment, as Di­ric ut­te­red a cry of tri­umph and sco­oped up two hand­fuls of the sto­nes, bran­dis­hing them over his he­ad.</p>
   <p>    "Tell him!" the red-ha­ired Tra­der-chi­ef sa­id, whir­ling and ad­dres­sing Me­ro fran­ti­cal­ly. "Tell him it is not gold! Tell him that it is worth­less!"</p>
   <p>    But what Di­ric and the ot­hers we­re sho­uting was not gold- nor wo­uld they ha­ve be­en half so ex­ci­ted over a bas­ket­ful of true gold nug­gets.</p>
   <p>    "Iron!" Di­ric bel­lo­wed with joy, "Iron!"</p>
   <p>    And he and the ot­hers ran out of the camp, le­aving Me­ro and Re­na to try to exp­la­in.</p>
   <p>    "We call the­se things 'iron pyri­tes,' and the­re are things we can do with them that we can­not with ot­her iron," Ka­la sa­id to Re­na, as she bent, glo­ating, over her pre­ci­o­us pi­le of rocks. On­ce the Tra­ders re­ali­zed how much the­ir "fo­ol's gold" was va­lu­ed by the Iron Pe­op­le, it didn't ta­ke long for them to tra­de away all they had, trus­ting to the­ir own skills and a pro­mi­sed es­cort of bull-ri­ders to ma­ke it back to the co­ver of fo­res­ted lands sa­fely. They didn't ha­ve much, but at le­ast they knew whe­re the­re was mo­re, and the Iron Pe­op­le we­re no lon­ger thre­ate­ning to ta­ke the­ir herds and the Corn Pe­op­le and go el­sew­he­re.</p>
   <p>    "It is the wo­men who will most va­lue the­se," Ka­la con­ti­nu­ed. "The men wo­uld only wish to melt them down. The­re are bet­ter things to be do­ne with the­se sto­nes."</p>
   <p>    Rena watc­hed in fas­ci­na­ti­on as Ka­la ma­de go­od her words, her plump, stubby fin­gers mo­ving with gre­at skill and surp­rising de­li­cacy, as she cut and fa­ce­ted tiny "gems­to­nes" from the iron pyri­tes, lit­tle things that glit­te­red li­ke black di­amonds. It to­ok un­be­li­evab­le pa­ti­en­ce.</p>
   <p>    "What are you go­ing to do with the­se?" Re­na as­ked, stir­ring a fi­nis­hed one in the palm of her hand with one fin­ger.</p>
   <p>    "Oh, I shall melt down the was­te and cast it in­to a set­ting for it," Ka­la res­pon­ded ab­sently. "It will be a dif­fe­rent style than you ha­ve se­en he­re­to­fo­re, but I think you will li­ke it. We ha­ve ag­re­ed to exc­han­ge it for the raw pyri­tes, so that the Tra­ders ne­ed no lon­ger was­te the­se pre­ci­o­us things in bas­kets on po­les in or­der to pro­tect them­sel­ves. One we­ight of jewelry to ten we­ights of pyri­tes."</p>
   <p>    There was no do­ubt in Re­na's mind that Ka­la tho­ught she was get­ting the bet­ter part of the bar­ga­in. Re­na con­ti­nu­ed to watch her for a whi­le, but Ka­la be­ca­me so in­vol­ved in her work that it se­emed an int­ru­si­on to stay, and she got up and went to lo­ok for Me­ro.</p>
   <p>    "We ha­ve a prob­lem," she sa­id to him, wor­ri­edly, as so­on as she ca­ught sight of him hur­rying to­wards her thro­ugh the tents.</p>
   <p>    "I know; Di­ric told me the tra­de-agre­ement," he rep­li­ed, just as wor­ri­ed. "I me­an, it's a go­od thing that they've got so­me iron, but this cuts us right out of everyt­hing. They can get most of what they ne­ed from eit­her the Corn Pe­op­le or the Tra­ders-"</p>
   <p>    "-so what use are the Wi­zards to them?" Re­na conc­lu­ded for him. "If the El­ven­lords do ma­na­ge to de­fe­at the Yo­ung Lords and co­me af­ter us, why sho­uld the Iron Pe­op­le bot­her to help now? The­re's not­hing in the al­li­an­ce for them!"</p>
   <p>    Mero nod­ded. "They're not­hing if not prac­ti­cal." He set his chin. "Right. First of all, we ne­ed to get in to­uch with Sha­na and let her know what's hap­pe­ned. May­be she'll ha­ve so­me ide­as."</p>
   <p>    "And next?" Re­na as­ked, ho­pe­ful­ly. Me­ro was re­so­ur­ce­ful- su­rely he co­uld think of so­met­hing they co­uld do!</p>
   <p>    "I can't think of a 'next,'" he rep­li­ed, das­hing her ho­pes. "I only wish I co­uld…"</p>

   <p>    Kyrtian sat we­arily on his hor­se be­ne­ath the bro­iling sun, and wa­ited for his sco­ut to co­me re­port to him. Ahe­ad of him-so­mew­he­re-we­re the ret­re­ating for­ces of the Yo­ung Lords. They we­re far eno­ugh ahe­ad of his tro­ops that the­re wasn't even the tell-ta­le sign of a dust-clo­ud on the ho­ri­zon.</p>
   <p>    It was un­can­ny, it was in­de­ed. The mo­ment, the very mo­ment that the Co­un­cil ag­re­ed-re­luc­tantly-to put him in char­ge of the­ir for­ces, so­me­one must ha­ve aler­ted the re­bels. And that sa­me so­me­one must ha­ve told them that in Lord Kyrti­an they we­re go­ing to fa­ce a tra­ined com­man­der and tra­ined tro­ops. Be­ca­use he ne­ver even got a chan­ce to fa­ce an army in the fi­eld, only a few skir­mis­hers me­ant to de­lay him whi­le the army it­self ret­re­ated.</p>
   <p>    That was what his sco­uts we­re out lo­oking for now-skir­mis­hers, traps, fal­se tra­ils. And, just pos­sibly, signs that the Yo­ung Lords had cho­sen a pla­ce to ma­ke a stand. But he didn't re­al­ly ex­pect that, not for so­me ti­me yet. They we­re too far from are­as they held se­cu­re, nor was the gro­und par­ti­cu­larly go­od for tur­ning at bay.</p>
   <p>    Meanwhile-</p>
   <p>    The sco­ut-one of his own pe­op­le-ca­me run­ning up; the man stop­ped at his stir­rup and sa­lu­ted.</p>
   <p>    "Report," Kyrti­an com­man­ded.</p>
   <p>    "My lord-all's cle­ar, and the ot­hers ha­ve mar­ked out a se­cu­re camp­si­te," the man sa­id crisply. "No sign of the enemy, ot­her than the marks of ret­re­at."</p>
   <p>    "Very go­od." Kyrti­an sa­lu­ted in dis­mis­sal, and the sco­ut trot­ted off to re­turn to his own gro­up. He lo­oked over at Gel, who was al­so mo­un­ted, and wa­iting just be­si­de him.</p>
   <p>    "Well?" he as­ked.</p>
   <p>    Gel bar­ked a la­ugh. "It's ma­king yo­ur re­pu­ta­ti­on easily eno­ugh," he sa­id. "But I wo­uldn't co­unt on it to last."</p>
   <p>    "I'm not." He sig­hed. "Let's get them mo­ving. If we camp early eno­ugh, I can drill them so­me mo­re."</p>
   <p>    "Good plan." Gel whe­eled his hor­se away and he­aded to­wards the ma­in body of the army, pa­used for a rest, to re­lay Kyrti­an's or­ders. Kyrti­an sta­red at the ho­ri­zon-and won­de­red when the ine­vi­tab­le blow was go­ing to fall.</p>
   <p>    Rennati sig­hed, brus­hed her ha­ir back over her sho­ul­ders, and bent to lo­ok out of the win­dow in her sle­eping-alco­ve, cra­ning her neck to see as much of the vi­ew be­low her as pos­sib­le. Sin­ce Lord Kyrti­an had left-and she did not know why, only that the­ir ser­vants sa­id that he had go­ne-the­re had be­en not­hing to re­port to Lady Tri­ana, and not­hing what­so­ever had hap­pe­ned he­re in the ha­rem. No mo­re vi­si­tors had co­me, and not­hing had be­en told to the con­cu­bi­nes. Ren­na­ti had as­si­du­o­usly prac­ti­ced her dan­cing, but one co­uldn't fill every ho­ur of the day with dan­cing. It had be­en her one pas­si­on, but now she had all the le­isu­re she co­uld ever ha­ve dre­amed of to prac­ti­ce and per­fect her art, and she re­ali­zed that wit­ho­ut an audi­en­ce to ap­pre­ci­ate what she did, simply prac­ti­cing and per­fec­ting no lon­ger was eno­ugh for her.</p>
   <p>    The ot­her two con­cu­bi­nes we­re hap­pily oc­cu­pi­ed with the con­tents of se­ve­ral chests that Lady Lydi­ell had tho­ught­ful­ly sent up. So­me­how she had known that the last batch of dres­sma­king ma­te­ri­als was ex­ha­us­ted, and she had sup­pli­ed a true hor­de of pre­ci­o­us things-swaths of silks, sa­tins, and vel­vets, yards of trim, buc­kets of glit­te­ring glass, shell and sto­ne be­ads, gold and sil­ver and sil­ken emb­ro­idery thre­ads, and everyt­hing the he­art co­uld de­si­re for the ma­king of dres­ses and or­na­ments. A tho­ught­ful gift that had rat­her surp­ri­sed Ren­na­ti, ac­tu­al­ly; not­hing in her li­fe wo­uld ha­ve led her to ex­pect any such at­ten­ti­ons from the cha­te­la­ine and mot­her of a yo­ung lord. And if Ren­na­ti had be­en just a lit­tle mo­re li­ke the ot­her two sla­ves of Lord Kyrti­an's ha­rem, she wo­uld ha­ve be­en right down the­re beside Gi­an­na and Ka­ra, plan­ning dres­ses, se­wing, and ma­king de­li­ca­te lit­tle amu­let-neck­la­ces with the we­alth of be­ads.</p>
   <p>    She had do­ne so­me of that, but li­ke her dan­cing, the­re was only so much put­te­ring with trin­kets that she co­uld do be­fo­re she lost in­te­rest. Con­cu­bi­nes we­re sup­po­sed to be ob­ses­sed with clot­hing and self-orna­men­ta­ti­on; Ren­na­ti li­ked clot­hing well eno­ugh, and she enj­oyed lo­oking pretty, but she had al­ways felt frust­ra­ted and con­fi­ned by li­fe in the ha­rem, tho­ugh she had ta­ken very gre­at ca­re ne­ver to show it. The al­ter­na­ti­ve to the ha­rem was the li­fe of a fi­eld- or ho­use-sla­ve, and they we­re not tre­ated ne­arly as well as the con­cu­bi­nes.</p>
   <p>    The vi­ew from her win­dow, tho­ugh rest­ric­ted, was mo­re in­te­res­ting than anyt­hing in­si­de the ha­rem. At le­ast the­re was so­met­hing go­ing on out the­re, so­met­hing dif­fe­rent from the in­te­ri­or of the ha­rem to­wer. We­at­her chan­ged, sla­ves wal­ked past, birds flew by. And she was, frankly, put­ting off re­por­ting to Lady Tri­ana. The Lady had be­en inc­re­asingly im­pa­ti­ent with Ren­na­ti's lack of in­for­ma­ti­on and, the last ti­me, had thre­ate­ned to re­vo­ke her bar­ga­in un­less Ren­na­ti had mo­re to re­port the next ti­me she cal­led.</p>
   <p>    At last, with a gri­ma­ce, she de­ci­ded that she co­uldn't put it off any lon­ger. She pic­ked up the lit­tle box of per­so­nal jewelry, and dug the te­le­son-ring out from its hi­ding-pla­ce among her tiny tre­asu­res. Ca­re­ful­ly she put it on, spo­ke the few words that ac­ti­va­ted it, and sta­red in­to the dark gre­en murk of the beryl, wa­iting for a vo­ice to call to her thinly ac­ross the vast dis­tan­ce bet­we­en this ma­nor and Lady Tri­ana's.</p>
   <p>    "Well. So this is whe­re the dis­tur­ban­ce has be­en co­ming from."</p>
   <p>    Rennati star­ted, and lo­oked up, for the vo­ice did not co­me from the ring, nor was it Lady Tri­ana's.</p>
   <p>    Lady Lydi­ell sto­od in the do­or­way, and in her shock, Ren­na­ti co­uld only sta­re at her dumbly. El­ven la­di­es ne­ver en­te­red the ha­rem, much less ca­me in­to the con­cu­bi­nes' pri­va­te qu­ar­ters! She had fe­ared dis­co­very by Gi­an­na or Ka­ra, or per­haps even Lord Kyrti­an him­self, but ne­ver, ever by his mot­her!</p>
   <p>    The lady was not dres­sed in the sa­me fas­hi­on that she had been when Ren­na­ti first met with her; in fact, she lo­oked very lit­tle li­ke the shel­te­red Lady of the ma­nor that Ren­na­ti knew her to be. With her long, sil­ver ha­ir bo­und in­to a se­ve­re knot at the na­pe of her neck, no cos­me­tics on her fa­ce, and no jewels- we­aring a soft brown di­vi­ded skirt and matc­hing long-sle­eved tu­nic-only her air of aut­ho­rity bet­ra­yed her rank.</p>
   <p>    Her eyes we­re qu­i­et, un­re­adab­le po­ols of murky gre­en, exactly li­ke the beryl in Ren­na­ti's ring; her fa­ce as exp­res­si­on­less as a sta­tue.</p>
   <p>    Lady Lydi­ell calmly to­ok the few steps ne­eded to cross the dis­tan­ce bet­we­en the do­or­way and Ren­na­ti, and held out her hand.</p>
   <p>    "Whomever you ha­ve be­en re­por­ting to won't ans­wer you, child," the Lady sa­id, with no sign of an­ger or any ot­her emo­ti­on that Ren­na­ti co­uld de­tect. "I've ta­ken ca­re of that. You might as well gi­ve that te­le­son-ring to me."</p>
   <p>    Numbly, Ren­na­ti to­ok the ring off and han­ded it to her-then auto­ma­ti­cal­ly drop­ped to her kne­es be­si­de the co­uch she had be­en se­ated on, and bo­wed her he­ad, clas­ping her hands be­hind her back, wa­iting for the Lady to pu­nish her.</p>
   <p>    Her vi­vid ima­gi­na­ti­on pa­in­ted a do­zen pic­tu­res for her of what to ex­pect in the next few mo­ments, as her he­art be­at so ra­pidly she had tro­ub­le bre­at­hing, and she shi­ve­red with fe­ar. Her mo­uth dri­ed, her thro­at clo­sed, and she felt as if she was abo­ut to fa­int. She wo­uld be pu­nis­hed, of co­ur­se. She had bet­ra­yed her Mas­ter-at the be­hest of anot­her El­ven­lord, true, but that was no ex­cu­se. No sla­ve co­uld bet­ray her mas­ter and be ca­ught, and ex­pect to es­ca­pe wit­ho­ut pu­nish­ment. At the le­ast, she wo­uld be sent out in­to the fi­elds. At the worst-</p>
   <p>    "What on earth are you do­ing, child?" Lady Lydi­ell as­ked, in an as­to­nis­hed vo­ice, which tur­ned exas­pe­ra­ted as Ren­na­ti re­ma­ined whe­re she was. "Oh, for-get up lit­tle fo­ol! I'm not go­ing to hurt you! And lo­ok at me!"</p>
   <p>    Automatically Ren­na­ti le­apt obe­di­ently to her fe­et, tur­ning her as­to­nis­hed eyes to the Lady's fa­ce as her he­art skip­ped be­ats and her chest tigh­te­ned along with her thro­at. For a mo­ment, she tho­ught she wo­uld fa­int.</p>
   <p>    Lady Lydi­ell frow­ned, but not in such a way as-say-Lady Triana had frow­ned. This frown was just an­no­yan­ce, not so­met­hing that wo­uld fre­eze the blo­od. It was an im­per­so­nal frown-the­re was no re­al an­ger in it. Tho­ugh Ren­na­ti's skin felt cold and clammy, her he­art slo­wed, just a lit­tle, and the ten­si­on in her chest eased.</p>
   <p>    "'Sit down," Lady Lydi­ell sa­id shortly, and Ren­na­ti obe­yed, her eyes fi­xed on the Lady's fa­ce. "And tell me abo­ut this ring. Who ga­ve it to you? Why? And what ha­ve you be­en tel­ling him?"</p>
   <p>    "Her," Ren­na­ti cor­rec­ted auto­ma­ti­cal­ly, and clap­ped her hand to her mo­uth in re­ne­wed alarm. But when no slap, sting of the col­lar, or in­de­ed, any ot­her cor­rec­ti­on ca­me, she to­ok her co­ura­ge in both hands, and be­gan her ta­le.</p>
   <p>    There was no re­ason to lie; if Lady Lydi­ell ca­red to, she co­uld ha­ve it all out of her in a mo­ment, eit­her un­der the inf­lu­en­ce of drugs or by ap­pli­ca­ti­on of pa­in thro­ugh the col­lar. And at this po­int the­re was no chan­ce that Lady Tri­ana wo­uld ke­ep her si­de of the bar­ga­in, which had spe­ci­fi­ed that Ren­na­ti re­ma­in un­de­tec­ted. So Ren­na­ti told everyt­hing, from the mo­ment that Lady Tri­ana pic­ked her out of a sla­ve-sa­le to the last thing that she had re­por­ted. As she spo­ke, Lady Lydi­ell's frown sof­te­ned, un­til when at last Ren­na­ti fell si­lent, the el­ven lady's exp­res­si­on was no wor­se than tho­ught­ful and slightly di­sap­pro­ving.</p>
   <p>    As she spo­ke, and Lydi­ell's exp­res­si­on eased, so, too, did the fe­eling of pa­nic and fe­ar, the aw­ful sick fe­eling in her sto­mach. As she fi­nis­hed her last words, Lydi­ell nod­ded.</p>
   <p>    "It co­uld ha­ve be­en wor­se," she sa­id when Ren­na­ti fell si­lent. "You ha­ven't gi­ven that cre­atu­re much that's go­ing to be of any use to her, and fo­re­war­ned is fo­re­ar­med as they say." She watc­hed Ren­na­ti for a few mo­ments, then ap­pe­ared to ma­ke up her mind abo­ut so­met­hing. "Stand up, child," she sa­id. "I want you to co­me with me."</p>
   <p>    The fe­ar re­tur­ned, re­do­ub­led, and her he­art ra­ced aga­in, her bre­ath co­ming qu­ickly as she tri­ed to get air past the ter­rib­le tight­ness of her thro­at and chest. Now it co­mes, Ren­na­ti tho­ught, he­art sin­king with dre­ad. But, of co­ur­se, she co­uldn't di­so­bey. She fol­lo­wed Lady Lydi­ell down the sta­irs, past Gi-anna and Ka­ra-</p>
   <p>    And out past the bar­ri­er at the do­or that kept una­ut­ho­ri­zed slaves from get­ting in­to the ha­rem-and the con­cu­bi­nes from le­aving it. The­re was a fa­int ting­le on her skin as she pas­sed thro­ugh the shim­me­ring cur­ta­in of ma­gic po­wer, and she shi­ve­red. Now she was out­si­de, and away from the scant pro­tec­ti­on of the pre­sen­ce of the ot­her two. What was Lady Lydi­ell go­ing to do with her? Hand her over to the gla­di­ators?</p>
   <p>    "You're in­tel­li­gent, and I don't think you're a bad child at he­art," Lydi­ell sa­id, as if to her­self, then lo­oked over her sho­ul­der at Ren­na­ti, who shrank in­si­de her­self when tho­se pe­net­ra­ting gre­en eyes met hers. "I'm usu­al­ly con­si­de­red a go­od jud­ge of cha­rac­ter, by the way."</p>
   <p>    "Yes, my lady," Ren­na­ti whis­pe­red, sin­ce it se­emed that Lady Lydi­ell was wa­iting for an ans­wer as they wal­ked down a marb­le-fa­ced hal­lway.</p>
   <p>    "I'm go­ing to ta­ke a chan­ce with you," Lydi­ell con­ti­nu­ed, still hol­ding her with that,sharp ga­ze. "I'm go­ing to do so­met­hing that has ne­ver be­en do­ne with a hu­man from out­si­de our own circ­le, born and ra­ised among us. I'm go­ing to show you exactly what you've je­opar­di­zed with yo­ur ac­ti­ons."</p>
   <p>    And for the next se­ve­ral ho­urs, Ren­na­ti fo­und her­self ha­uled all over Lord Kyrti­an's es­ta­te, se­e­ing things that left her ga­ping, too overw­hel­med to spe­ak. This-this pla­ce was not­hing li­ke anyw­he­re she had ever be­en be­fo­re!</p>
   <p>    At first, it only se­emed as if this was just an or­di­nary es­ta­te, alt­ho­ugh the Mas­ter and Mist­ress of it we­re unu­su­al­ly kind to the­ir sla­ves and tre­ated them ext­ra­or­di­na­rily well. First, the Lady to­ok her to every no­ok and cranny of the Gre­at Ho­use- not only thro­ugh the ro­oms that she and her son and the ot­her El­ven­lords of the ho­use­hold used, but in­to the kitc­hen, the still-ro­om, the la­undry, the se­wing and we­aving ro­om. Everyw­he­re the Lady was gre­eted with res­pect, tho­ugh not ser­vi­lity; mo­re im­por­tantly, she didn't ex­pect or se­em to de­mand ser­vi­lity. In every ot­her ho­use­hold Ren­na­ti had be­en in, sla­ves we­re ex­pec­ted ne­ver to spe­ak un­less di­rectly ad­dres­sed, ne­ver to ra­ise the­ir eyes to the mist­ress's fa­ce un­less gi­ven per­mis­si­on, and ne­ver, ever, to do as the­se sla­ves did, and ac­tu­al­ly ap­pro­ach the mist­ress with a re­port or a qu­ery. But Ren­na­ti qu­ickly be­gan to realize that Lady Lydi­ell not only was inc­re­dibly ap­pro­ac­hab­le, she was al­so gre­eted with ac­tu­al af­fec­ti­on by her sla­ves.</p>
   <p>    Affection? From sla­ves? How was that pos­sib­le?</p>
   <p>    "What do you think of our ho­me so far?" Lydi­ell as­ked, as they mo­ved out­si­de and he­aded for a long, low bu­il­ding. This was a qu­es­ti­on that wo­uld ha­ve be­en ap­prop­ri­ate if as­ked of an equ­al or one only slightly in­fe­ri­or, but not of a con­cu­bi­ne. Con­cu­bi­nes we­re not sup­po­sed to ha­ve opi­ni­ons. They we­re ba­rely sup­po­sed to think.</p>
   <p>    The qu­es­ti­on surp­ri­sed her in­to ho­nesty, not the le­ast be­ca­use the sla­ves in the kitc­hen had ac­tu­al­ly cal­led che­er­ful and wel­co­ming gre­etings when the Lady had first en­te­red, le­aving Ren-na­ti dumb­fo­un­ded. "I don't un­ders­tand," she sa­id. "They li­ke you! How can sla­ves li­ke you?"</p>
   <p>    She hadn't re­al­ly ex­pec­ted a reply, un­less it ca­me as a rep­ro­of. But what Lady Lydi­ell sa­id in res­pon­se to the im­pul­si­ve exc­la­ma­ti­on shoc­ked her to the co­re and left her spe­ech­less.</p>
   <p>    "They li­ke me be­ca­use they are not sla­ves," Lydi­ell sa­id. "Ne­it­her they, nor the­ir an­ces­tors, we­re ever sla­ves; he­re, in this one ma­nor, no El­ven­lord has ever ens­la­ved a hu­man."</p>
   <p>    What? Ren­na­ti felt her he­art ac­tu­al­ly stop for a mo­ment.</p>
   <p>    "They are in my emp­loy," Lady Lydi­ell con­ti­nu­ed. "They are my hel­pers, and we res­pect each ot­her. Kyrti­an and I pro­tect them from the out­si­de world, as his fat­her did for the­ir an­ces­tors, and his grand­fat­her for the­irs, and for that pro­tec­ti­on, they and the­ir fa­mi­li­es ser­ve us," the Lady sa­id qu­i­etly. "We ha­ve ne­ver had sla­ves he­re, and ne­ver shall, if we are left alo­ne by the Lady Tri­anas of the world."</p>
   <p>    It was such an as­to­nis­hing sta­te­ment that it had to be a lie. It was simply not pos­sib­le that the­re was a fa­mily of the El­ven-lords that hadn't ens­la­ved hu­mans!</p>
   <p>    And yet-how co­uld it be a lie? Why sho­uld the Lady ma­ke up such an as­to­nis­hing story? What pur­po­se wo­uld it ser­ve? And how co­uld she ha­ve got­ten all of her sla­ves to act in such a na­tu­ral way, un­less it was true and not a lie?</p>
   <p>    As Ren­na­ti con­ti­nu­ed to fol­low Lady Lydi­ell out in­to the fi­elds, to the cot­ta­ges of the farm-la­bo­rers, to the bar­racks of the figh­ters, she had be­en pro­tec­ted by a co­re of ut­ter dis­be­li­ef, but the mo­re she saw, the mo­re that co­re ero­ded. If the Lady had only shown her the ho­use­hold ser­vants, she wo­uld not ha­ve trus­ted what she saw, but he­re we­re pe­op­le who sho­uld ne­ver ha­ve set eyes on the lady, who, if they ever by so­me chan­ce had se­en her sho­uld ne­ver re­cog­ni­ze the pla­inly-dres­sed Lady for the aut­ho­rity that she was. But ti­me af­ter ti­me, the Lady was met with wel­co­me and gre­eting, with the kind of com­mon talk that might be sha­red with a trus­ted hu­man over­se­er, but ne­ver with an El­ven­lord, and she her­self as­ked qu­es­ti­ons abo­ut the far­ming, tra­ining, or the sla­ves them­sel­ves and the­ir fa­mi­li­es (fa­mi­li­es? Im­pos­sib­le!) that sho­wed she was in­ti­ma­tely fa­mi­li­ar with the mi­nu­ti­ae of the­ir li­ves.</p>
   <p>    Even so, Ren­na­ti clung to her stub­born re­fu­sal to be­li­eve in this mi­rac­le of El­ven kind­ness, right up un­til the two of them ap­pro­ac­hed a set of small bu­il­dings const­ruc­ted aro­und a gar­den. Ren­na­ti co­uld not ima­gi­ne what they co­uld be, but to her inc­re­du­lo­us ears ca­me the so­und of high, shrill vo­ices-the vo­ices of child­ren-</p>
   <p>    As Lady Lydi­ell ca­me in­to vi­ew of the gar­den, the child­ren pla­ying the­re ca­ught sight of her, and ran to­ward her, shri­eking gre­etings at the tops of the­ir lungs.</p>
   <p>    "Lady Li­di! Lady Li­di!" "Co­me see my puppy!" "Will you ma­ke us swe­eti­es?" "Lady Li­di, Jordy fo­und a frog!"</p>
   <p>    Lady Lydi­ell only smi­led se­re­nely as the hor­de of small child­ren (so­me of them very grubby in­de­ed) swar­med all aro­und her, hol­ding up flo­wers, a frog, a puppy, dolls, and toy bows and ar­rows for her ap­pro­val. As Ren­na­ti sta­red, her mo­uth drop­ping comp­le­tely open, the Lady ga­ve each of the child­ren her gra­vest at­ten­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Now she knew why the­re we­re no bre­eding pens, no mass nur­se­ri­es, no ot­her signs that hu­man sla­ves we­re bred he­re with the sa­me ca­re to se­lec­ti­on and ca­re­les­sness as to fe­elings as we­re cat­tle and hor­ses. The clus­ter of small bu­il­dings we­re- ho­uses. Ho­uses for fa­mi­li­es. Fa­mi­li­es who we­re al­lo­wed to ke­ep the­ir child­ren with them. And sin­ce the­re we­re no bre­eding pens, this must be the norm he­re, not the ex­cep­ti­on, as it was on the es­ta­te that had bred Ren­na­ti.</p>
   <p>    These child­ren we­re ut­terly fe­ar­less in the pre­sen­ce of the cha­te­la­ine of the ma­nor. They must ne­ver ha­ve re­ce­ived so much as an un­kind­ness from an El­ven­lord.</p>
   <p>    And lo­ok at the Lady her­self! She co­uldn't ha­ve be­en mo­re pa­ti­ent with this hor­de of exu­be­rant child­ren if she had be­en the­ir nur­se­ma­id or be­lo­ved re­la­ti­ve!</p>
   <p>    Rennati let fall the last of her dis­be­li­ef, and felt the world whir­ling aro­und her, tur­ned ut­terly up­si­de down.</p>
   <p>    "Will you ple­ase ma­ke us swe­eti­es, Lady Li­di?" as­ked one of the boys, po­li­te, but bold as a yo­ung ro­os­ter.</p>
   <p>    Lady Lydi­ell la­ug­hed. "All right. One flo­wer each. Go pick fresh ones." She tur­ned to Ren­na­ti, who clutc­hed a be­am em­bed­ded in the cor­ner of the ho­use be­si­de her, fe­eling ac­tu­al­ly dizzy. "Elven wo­men are tra­ined to use the­ir ma­gic in small ways rat­her than lar­ge-you'll find most of them ma­king fo­olish sculp­tu­res out of flo­wers, but that's a bas­tar­di­za­ti­on of what we ori­gi­nal­ly did in Eve­lon. We he­aled wo­unds and so­me­ti­mes sick­ness-but most im­por­tant of all, we ma­de the ine­dib­le edib­le. Lady Moth ta­ught me that lit­tle trick, which she le­ar­ned from her mot­her. I still use it to ma­ke ho­ney-swe­ets from flo­wers for the child­ren-ah, he­re they co­me!"</p>
   <p>    There we­re plenty of flo­wers in the lit­tle gar­dens that Ren­na­ti now no­ti­ced aro­und the ho­uses, and it hadn't ta­ken the child­ren long to pick out which flo­wer they wis­hed ma­de in­to a tre­at. She no­ti­ced that the girls ge­ne­ral­ly cho­se ro­ses; well, she was par­ti­al to ro­se-pe­tal can­di­es her­self. Many of them suc­ked thorn-wo­un­ded fin­gers, but no­ne of them comp­la­ined. The boys se­emed to pre­fer sunf­lo­wers, dah­li­as, anyt­hing lar­ge. But one lit­tle girl at the re­ar of the gro­up ca­me up hol­ding a sing­le vi­olet, and lo­oked to Lady Lydi­ell with eyes fil­led with di­sap­po­int­ment.</p>
   <p>    "Sahshi, what's the mat­ter?" Lydi­ell as­ked, se­e­ing her and her dist­ress at on­ce, and mo­ti­oning for the ot­hers to let her thro­ugh.</p>
   <p>    "You sa­id only one," Sahs­hi whis­pe­red imp­lo­ringly. "But I li­ke vi'lets-"</p>
   <p>    "Oh de­ar-child­ren, do you think it's fa­ir for Sahs­hi only to ha­ve one tiny vi­olet?" Lydi­ell ap­pli­ed to the rest of the child­ren- and had they be­en pen-born and nur­sery-ra­ised, whe­re it was every child for him­self, Ren­na­ti knew what the ans­wer wo­uld ha­ve be­en. But not he­re.</p>
   <p>    "No!" ca­me the cla­mor, ins­tantly, and wit­ho­ut promp­ting, se­ve­ral of them ran to ne­arby gar­dens, brin­ging back bunc­hes of vi­olets that they pres­sed in­to Sahs­hi's hands un­til the child co­uldn't hold any mo­re.</p>
   <p>    Her fa­ce glo­wing with hap­pi­ness, Sahs­hi held up the vi­olets for Lady Lydi­ell to trans­mu­te-and then ga­ve Ren­na­ti a furt­her surp­ri­se (as if she ne­eded one at this po­int) by sha­ring out her swe­ets with the ot­hers as they wa­ited in the­ir turn for Lady Lydi­ell to get to them. This was pro­bably just as well, for had she eaten them all her­self she wo­uld su­rely ha­ve ear­ned her­self a bel­lyac­he, but ne­ver be­fo­re had Ren­na­ti se­en a child of the lo­west, fi­eld wor­ker class who wo­uld not ha­ve im­me­di­ately sho­ve­led a tre­at in­to her mo­uth with both hands and de­vo­ured it as fast as she co­uld, stuf­fing her­self un­til she was sick be­ca­use it wo­uld be ages be­fo­re she might tas­te any ot­her go­od thing.</p>
   <p>    It was all, in a word, im­pos­sib­le.</p>
   <p>    When Lydi­ell had fi­nis­hed with the last flo­wer, the child­ren than­ked her and stre­amed back to the­ir playg­ro­und, a small squ­are sur­ro­un­ded by ro­ugh-hewn logs enc­lo­sing an area of soft sand that held stumps and bars to climb on, a bo­ard with se­ats on eit­her end po­ised on a hewn block of wo­od that al­lo­wed the ends to ri­se and fall with child­ren ba­lan­ced on se­ats the­re, and ot­her things that the child­ren se­emed to enj­oy swar­ming over.</p>
   <p>    These things all sho­wed signs of a gre­at de­al of we­ar; they hadn't be­en pla­ced the­re re­cently. This was no ar­ti­fi­ci­al set­ting ma­de for her be­ne­fit, to sway her opi­ni­on.</p>
   <p>    As if my opi­ni­on, the at­ti­tu­de of a mor­tal, ac­tu­al­ly me­ans so­met­hing! But to Lady Lydi­ell it did, it pa­tently did.</p>
   <p>    Lydiell tur­ned back to fa­ce Ren­na­ti with a qu­iz­zi­cal smi­le on her fa­ce. "Well?" she sa­id, po­in­tedly.</p>
   <p>    Rennati felt cold and hot at the sa­me ti­me, and the­re was a fa­int buz­zing in her ears. "What-is-this-pla­ce?" she as­ked, thickly.</p>
   <p>    "Ah. That is a very go­od qu­es­ti­on." Lady Lydi­ell to­ok Ren-na­ti's arm, as if she was Ren­na­ti's ol­dest fri­end. "Co­me back to the ma­nor with me. I think, when you ha­ve had so­met­hing to drink to ste­ady you, you will ha­ve a gre­at many mo­re qu­es­ti­ons, and I will try to ans­wer them."</p>
   <p>    In the end, Ren­na­ti tho­ught she wo­uld ne­ver co­me to an end of her qu­es­ti­ons. Lydi­ell ans­we­red each and every one, with in­fi­ni­te pa­ti­en­ce as they sat in ele­gant cha­irs on eit­her si­de of a lit­tle tab­le on one of the out­do­or ter­ra­ces. He­re she was-eating da­in­ti­es that, in her ex­ci­te­ment, she did not truly tas­te; drin­king so­met­hing that might just as well ha­ve be­en wa­ter for all the at­ten­ti­on she pa­id to it; and ar­ran­ged ac­ross from a high­born el-ven lady on one of the pri­va­te ter­ra­ces as if she, too, was El­ven­born. The sun sho­ne down on the gar­dens be­low them, alt­ho­ugh they we­re sha­ded by a fi­ne cloth ca­nopy of ta­pest­ri­ed li­nen. A few wo­men wor­ked in the gar­dens be­low, the very pic­tu­re of bu­co­lic con­tent­ment-well-clot­hed in prac­ti­cal leg­gings and long, lo­ose li­nen tu­nics, pro­tec­ted from the sun by bro­ad-brim­med straw hats, and no su­per­vi­sor in sight.</p>
   <p>    Slowly she be­gan to re­al­ly un­ders­tand just what it was that Lord Kyrti­an's fa­mily pro­tec­ted he­re. That was when the enor­mity of her own tre­ac­hery daw­ned on her, hit­ting her with the for­ce of a blow. If she had still be­en ab­le to we­ep, she wo­uld ha­ve, then; she'd ha­ve bro­ken down and how­led with the pa­in of what she had do­ne to the­se ama­zing El­ven­lords and the­ir hu­man char­ges. She wan­ted to; her thro­at clo­sed and she ne­arly cho­ked on her uns­hed te­ars, but we­eping had long sin­ce be­en tra­ined out of her, and she co­uld not cry, not even for this. Con­cu­bi­nes did not we­ep; it spo­iled the­ir lo­oks, and only an­no­yed the­ir mas­ters.</p>
   <p>    But the depth of her des­pa­ir co­uld not be me­asu­red, and she co­uld not simply sit the­re and be­ar it in­vi­sibly.</p>
   <p>    She slip­ped from her se­at and sank down to her kne­es, then prost­ra­ted her­self on the sto­ne of the ter­ra­ce, not da­ring to lo­ok at the Lady lest she crack in­to a tho­usand pi­eces.</p>
   <p>    "Ah," sa­id the lady softly. "Now you un­ders­tand."</p>
   <p>    It was hard, hard to spe­ak; hard to get words aro­und that lump of gu­ilt and pa­in in her thro­at. "Yes." It was all she co­uld ma­na­ge.</p>
   <p>    "Now I ha­ve qu­es­ti­ons for you," Lady Lydi­ell sa­id, in a vo­ice that war­ned she wo­uld in­sist on ans­wers.</p>
   <p>    Rennati co­uld not be­ar to lo­ok in­to the fa­ce of the one she had so vi­lely bet­ra­yed, and she re­ma­ined whe­re she was, prost­ra­ted on the sto­ne of the ter­ra­ce, spe­aking bro­kenly to the soft grey slab just be­low her no­se. The lady's qu­es­ti­ons went on as long as Ren­na­ti's had, every de­ta­il of her li­fe, of her bar­ga­in with Lady Tri­ana, pul­led from her gently, but ine­xo­rably.</p>
   <p>    It se­emed to go on fo­re­ver, and when she was do­ne, she felt dra­ined of everyt­hing ex­cept pa­in. The­re was not­hing that Lady Lydi­ell did not know abo­ut her now, and su­rely, su­rely, the pu­nish­ment she so richly de­ser­ved wo­uld be forth­co­ming.</p>
   <p>    The lady fi­nal­ly ma­de a so­und-a we­ary sigh. "Get up, child, and sit down so that I can talk to you pro­perly."</p>
   <p>    Rennati co­uldn't mo­ve-but a mo­ment la­ter, she fo­und her­self be­ing mo­ved, as Lady Lydi­ell to­ok her el­bows, lif­ted her to her fe­et and rep­la­ced her in her se­at, as ef­fort­les­sly as if she we­ig­hed not­hing. Per­haps, for the Lady, she was ne­ar-we­ight­less; she was cle­arly a past mist­ress of El­ven ma­gic, and how co­uld Ren­na­ti know what was and was not pos­sib­le in ma­gic?</p>
   <p>    "Now," the Lady sa­id, her eyes bo­ring in­to Ren­na­ti's as if to sta­re in­to her very tho­ughts. "You un­ders­tand what you ha­ve do­ne to us. Are you pre­pa­red to ma­ke amends?"</p>
   <p>    By now Ren­na­ti had ex­ha­us­ted all emo­ti­ons but one-ho­pe. And un­der­ne­ath all that he­avy, black des­pa­ir, ho­pe stir­red and eased the const­ric­ti­on of her thro­at eno­ugh to let her bre­at­he a lit­tle. Numbly, she nod­ded.</p>
   <p>    Speaking ca­re­ful­ly and exactly, Lady Lydi­ell out­li­ned what Ren­na­ti was to do. And Ren­na­ti ag­re­ed to it, wit­ho­ut ever on­ce ma­king a sing­le obj­ec­ti­on or as­king what wo­uld hap­pen to her when the ine­vi­tab­le mo­ment ca­me when she was no lon­ger use­ful.</p>
   <p>    It had be­en a long, very hard day, most of it spent in the sad­dle, and Kyrti­an was al­re­ady we­ari­ed when his mot­her cal­led him.</p>
   <p>    So far, the cam­pa­ign aga­inst the Yo­ung Lords was tur­ning in­to so­met­hing ot­her than the hard-slog­ging bat­tle he'd be­en led to be­li­eve it wo­uld be. In fact, if it wasn't for the evi­den­ce of the de­vas­ta­ted es­ta­tes he'd se­en, with ma­nors half-bur­ned and fi­elds left to we­eds, it wo­uld ha­ve be­en so­met­hing of a far­ce.</p>
   <p>    Because the mo­ment he to­ok com­mand of the army-qu­ite li­te­ral­ly from the mo­ment he to­ok com­mand of the army-the Yo­ung Lords' di­rect op­po­si­ti­on mel­ted away. Qu­ite simply, they tur­ned and ran.</p>
   <p>    Now, as a com­man­der, he had to ag­ree with the­ir tac­tics. He bro­ught with him his own pe­op­le, who wo­uld ha­ve strengt­he­ned the li­ne as not­hing el­se co­uld ha­ve. The next pitc­hed bat­tle wo­uld ha­ve be­en a conc­lu­si­ve one. The Yo­ung Lords' army was not ne­ar any area that co­uld be used as a se­cu­re ba­se, and sup­pli­es had to be prob­le­ma­tic, even with the use of ma­gic. If he had be­en in the­ir si­tu­ati­on, he'd ha­ve do­ne the sa­me.</p>
   <p>    But now he was in pur­su­it, which me­ant that when they did ta­ke a stand, it wo­uld co­me as a surp­ri­se to him, and wo­uld be on gro­und of the­ir cho­osing. And very pro­bably he wo­uld be fa­cing the­ir res­ted for­ce with his own we­ary one.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian sta­red down at the tiny ima­ge of his mot­her in the te­le­son-scre­en set in­to his cam­pa­ign-desk, with Gel watc­hing over his sho­ul­der ma­king in­te­res­ted no­ises.</p>
   <p>    "Triana?" he sa­id, fi­nal­ly. "Ael­mar­kin I co­uld un­ders­tand, but why wo­uld Tri­ana want an agent in our ho­use­hold?"</p>
   <p>    Gel snor­ted, be­fo­re Lydi­ell co­uld ans­wer. "That's simp­le eno­ugh. They're wor­king to­get­her. Or Ael­mar­kin thinks they are. From all I've he­ard, that b-" he co­ug­hed. "-ah, fe­ma­le is an even nas­ti­er pi­ece of work than yo­ur co­usin, if that's pos-sib­le. Sne­aki­er, any­way. What do you think abo­ut this girl? Can you trust what she says? Can you trust what she'll do, now that you-"</p>
   <p>    Lydiell smi­led. "Oh, co­me now, Gel. This is the Lady you're tal­king to. How many of our pe­op­le ha­ve the hu­man ma­gic? And how many do you think we­re ke­eping watch on the girl's tho­ughts whi­le I qu­es­ti­oned her be­si­des the ones I as­ked to- just to ma­ke su­re that the ot­hers didn't miss so­met­hing?"</p>
   <p>    Gel had the gra­ce to blush. "Sho­uldn't try and te­ach my gran­dam what mush­ro­oms to pick, you me­an. Sorry, m'lady. So she's sa­fe?"</p>
   <p>    "More than sa­fe. I think we sho­uld ke­ep her," ca­me the rat­her surp­ri­sing reply. "She's very in­tel­li­gent, she's cle­ver-which is not at all the sa­me thing as be­ing in­tel­li­gent-and she's got a kind na­tu­re. I'd be very happy to see her ma­ke her ho­me with our pe­op­le. She co­uld be very use­ful to us-we ha­ven't got many pe­op­le who've be­en ra­ised in the sla­ve-pens; she gi­ves us a lo­ok in­to that world that is be­yond pri­ce."</p>
   <p>    "Not as my con­cu­bi­ne-" Kyrti­an blur­ted, and flus­hed when Gel chuck­led.</p>
   <p>    "I rat­her do­ubt that by the ti­me she's le­ar­ned to ta­ke her pla­ce among our pe­op­le she'd be wil­ling to be an­yo­ne's con­cu­bi­ne," Lydi­ell rep­li­ed dryly. "And af­ter all, that wo­uld be the po­int, wo­uldn't it?"</p>
   <p>    "I ta­ke it that yo­ur plan is to ha­ve her send de­arest Tri­ana as much di­sin­for­ma­ti­on as you think she'll swal­low?" Kyrti­an sa­id, has­tily chan­ging the su­bj­ect.</p>
   <p>    "It se­ems a pity to was­te the op­por­tu­nity," Lydi­ell ag­re­ed, her eyes twink­ling a lit­tle, or so Kyrti­an tho­ught, alt­ho­ugh the ima­ge was so small it was dif­fi­cult to tell. "If it se­ems that the ploy is wor­king, per­haps you might want to ha­ve her with you. I un­ders­tand that many of­fi­cers ha­ve a con­cu­bi­ne or two with them-"</p>
   <p>    Before Kyrti­an co­uld obj­ect, Gel rep­li­ed. "That's a go­od idea, when you're su­re be­yond a sha­dow of a do­ubt that we can trust her, Lady," he ent­hu­sed. "If Tri­ana is re­por­ting back to Ael­mar­kin, we can fe­ed her non­sen­se le­ave­ned with just eno­ugh truth to ma­ke it se­em that the girl is do­ing mo­re than the b-wo­man ever ex­pec­ted."</p>
   <p>    "I wo­uldn't call Tri­ana a 'bitch,' Gel," Lydi­ell sa­id mildly. "It's a ter­rib­le in­sult to all fe­ma­le ca­ni­nes, which are, on the who­le, rat­her ni­ce cre­atu­res."</p>
   <p>    Gel ne­arly cho­ked on his la­ugh­ter, and Kyrti­an felt his fa­ce grow hot. What had got­ten in­to his mot­her la­tely?</p>
   <p>    Or was it only that now his mot­her con­si­de­red him eno­ugh of an adult not to min­ce words aro­und him?</p>
   <p>    "In the abst­ract, it so­unds li­ke a go­od idea to me, pro­vi­ded that brin­ging her out he­re do­esn't put her in any dan­ger," he tem­po­ri­zed. "And I don't me­an dan­ger from the figh­ting; that's turning out to be rat­her-well-ta­mer than I tho­ught. For now, any­way. So­me­one's con­vin­ced the Yo­ung Lords to run, rat­her than stand and fight. I can't say I'm un­hap­py abo­ut that-it cer­ta­inly ma­kes me lo­ok li­ke a bril­li­ant com­man­der. But whi­le this girl is wit­hin the walls of our es­ta­te, she's sa­fe eno­ugh from Tri­ana-if she co­mes out he­re, and Tri­ana de­ci­des that she wants mo­re than a few words over a te­le­son-ring, it wo­uld be no gre­at cho­re to find so­me way to kid­nap her. Hu­man sla­ves and El­ven­lords are co­ming and go­ing from my qu­ar­ters all the ti­me, Gel is the only per­son I'd trust to ke­ep her sa­fe, and he and I can't ha­ve her on the bat­tle­fi­eld with us."</p>
   <p>    And I re­al­ly don 'twant a fe­ma­le comp­li­ca­ting things aro­und he­re, he ad­ded, but only in tho­ught. He re­al­ly did not want his mot­her- wor­rying abo­ut the dan­ger. The­re was, of co­ur­se, a gre­at de­al mo­re of that than he was go­ing to tell her abo­ut. When the ine­vi­tab­le hap­pe­ned, and the Yo­ung Lords tur­ned at bay-</p>
   <p>    Lydiell pur­sed her lips in tho­ught. "That hadn't oc­cur­red to me," she ad­mit­ted. "For that mat­ter, it wo­uldn't ta­ke a gre­at de­al of ef­fort on Tri­ana's part to send so­me­one to yo­ur qu­ar­ters to in­ti­mi­da­te the girl, and we can't ha­ve that. Well, let's hold that ploy in re­ser­ve for a whi­le, in ca­se Tri­ana starts ur­ging it on her. It may be that con­coc­ting a story that I've ma­de her in­to my pri­va­te ma­id whi­le you're go­ne and she can 'over­he­ar' my con­ver­sa­ti­ons with you will be eno­ugh."</p>
   <p>    "I sho­uld think," Kyrti­an sa­id firmly. "Ances­tors! For on­ce, you ha­ve be­en the one with all the in­te­res­ting news! All I can tell you is what I ha­ve be­fo­re; that, and I'm ne­arer to Lady Moth's es­ta­te and I think I can push the li­nes back far eno­ugh to put her in our hands aga­in wit­hin the we­ek."</p>
   <p>    "Assuming she wants to be," ca­me the tho­ught­ful reply. "All things con­si­de­red-do you think you might be ab­le to push just far eno­ugh that she can send a mes­sa­ge or co­me to you her­self, wit­ho­ut cut­ting her off from the Yo­ung Lords?"</p>
   <p>    Again, Kyrti­an was surp­ri­sed by the qu­es­ti­on, but he saw im­me­di­ately why his mot­her had as­ked it. "No one is li­kely to qu­es­ti­on me as long as I push them back-so­mew­he­re," he res­pon­ded. "You think she has wor­ked her way in­to the­ir con­fi­den­ce, don't you?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes. And I'm not en­ti­rely su­re you sho­uld be wor­king so hard to de­fe­at them." Lady Lydi­ell frow­ned slightly. "The­re is this: whi­le the Gre­at Lords are con­cent­ra­ting on the re­bels, they aren't pa­ying any at­ten­ti­on to us."</p>
   <p>    "Or the Wi­zards," Gel ad­ded.</p>
   <p>    "Or the Wi­zards," she ag­re­ed. "But if you de­fe­at the Yo­ung Lords, they are cer­ta­in to want you to le­ad an army aga­inst the Wi­zards next."</p>
   <p>    The very idea ma­de Kyrti­an's he­art sink, and he felt a lit­tle sick for not thin­king of that him­self. Of co­ur­se they wo­uld! And whi­le he didn't in the le­ast mind brin­ging the yo­ung pups to he­el for the old dogs, the very idea of pit­ting an army of sla­ves aga­inst the­ir fel­low hu­mans-</p>
   <p>    "I'll re­sign first," he sa­id hur­ri­edly. "I'll find an ex­cu­se. Or Gel can bre­ak my leg."</p>
   <p>    "Or yo­ur skull," Gel grow­led, but the­re was ap­pro­val in his vo­ice. "We'll worry abo­ut that when the ti­me co­mes. In the me­an­ti­me-"</p>
   <p>    "In the me­an­ti­me, I'll say go­odb­ye, and you can think abo­ut what to do abo­ut Moth," Lydi­ell sa­id firmly. "If we talk any lon­ger, so­me­one is bo­und to try and mir­ror this sen­ding. Watch yo­ur back, my lo­ve."</p>
   <p>    "I will," Kyrti­an pro­mi­sed, and the te­le­son win­ked out, le­aving both him and Gel with far too much to think abo­ut--and far too lit­tle ti­me for thin­king.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    The plight of one yo­ung wo­man co­uld not hold Kyrti­an's attention for long. So long as she was no lon­ger a thre­at, he didn't par­ti­cu­larly ca­re what his mot­her did with her.</p>
   <p>    Truthfully, he co­uldn't even re­mem­ber which of the three girls she was; she was Lydi­ell's prob­lem now, and he wo­uld just as soon that things sta­yed that way. Wit­hin a few mo­ments, he had even for­got­ten her na­me as his at­ten­ti­on tur­ned to the mo­re ur­gent task of chan­ging his stra­tegy to de­al with Moth and the Yo­ung Lords in light of this new in­for­ma­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    It was just a go­od thing that they had al­re­ady set­tled at the­ir eve­ning camp­si­te. Out­si­de the tent was the usu­al ca­cop­hony of hund­reds of hu­mans set­ting up camp­fi­res and bed­rol­ls, get­ting fed at the mess-wa­gons, and be­ing or­de­red abo­ut by the­ir el­ven of­fi­cers. The mel­low gol­den light of ne­ar-sun­set ma­de the wes­tern wall of Kyrti­an's tent glow; the air was full of dust and the scent of tramp­led grass and wo­od smo­ke. The­re was fo­od on a tray on his camp-bed, vir­tu­al­ly the sa­me sort of fo­od that the hu­man figh­ters wo­uld be eating, but Kyrti­an ig­no­red it. Gel wo­uld pro­bably nag him in­to eating it even­tu­al­ly.</p>
   <p>    "Well, we ne­ed to ret­hink our bat­tle-plan," he sa­id to Gel, spre­ading his ter­ra­in-map out over the blank black glass of the te­le­son-scre­en set in­to the top of his cam­pa­ign-desk. "The qu­es­ti­on is, what can we push to­wards now that will al­low us to get clo­se eno­ugh to Moth that she can send so­me­one out to us if she wants, wit­ho­ut ma­king stra­ight for her es­ta­te or lo­ok as if we're trying to avo­id that es­ta­te?"</p>
   <p>    "Good qu­es­ti­on." Gel pul­led at his chin whi­le he stu­di­ed the map, frow­ning. "Damn go­od qu­es­ti­on. What abo­ut he­re-" his fin­ger stab­bed down at a spot on the map whe­re they had no­ted a pos­sib­le sla­ve-camp, one full of for­mer gla­di­ators. "We can let it out that we think this is a tra­ining-camp for the Yo­ung Lords' sol­di­ers. That ought to be re­ason eno­ugh for an­yo­ne."</p>
   <p>    Taking the army in that di­rec­ti­on wo­uld al­low them to skirt Moth's es­ta­te wit­ho­ut ac­tu­al­ly ta­king it-and wo­uld gi­ve them a cor­ri­dor for a stri­ke de­eper in­to Yo­ung Lords' ter­ri­tory. Kyrti­an nod­ded, and re­ac­hed ab­sently for his mug of wa­ter, ta­king a sip to ease a thro­at tick­ling with in­ha­led dust. "Let's ma­ke a re­port to Lord Kyndreth and sug­gest the chan­ge of plan. I want him to ar­gue aga­inst me for a lit­tle."</p>
   <p>    "Why?" Gel ga­ve him a qu­iz­zi­cal glan­ce, brows knit­ted.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian re­fol­ded the map ca­re­ful­ly and set it asi­de. "Be­ca­use this is go­ing to ser­ve us in mo­re ways than one. He's go­ing to po­int out that with a very lit­tle ef­fort I can res­cue Moth. I'm going to co­un­ter that Moth is pro­bably sa­fe whe­re she is, that the Yo­ung Lords pro­bably ha­ven't even tho­ught abo­ut one old wo­man in a tiny es­ta­te, and pus­hing to­wards the Yo­ung Lords at that po­int will ma­ke them think that Moth is va­lu­ab­le to us. I want him to see that it's pos­sib­le so­me of the old re­ta­iners held be­hind the li­nes that ha­ve be­en ig­no­red un­til now co­uld be used as hos­ta­ges. It do­esn't se­em to ha­ve oc­cur­red to the Yo­ung Lords to do that yet, but I want Kyndreth to re­ali­ze he do­esn't want to gi­ve them the idea. I do want Kyndreth to fo­cus on that and not lo­ok for ot­her re­asons why I might not want to push at that po­int."</p>
   <p>    "That'll gi­ve him so­met­hing mo­re to think abo­ut," Gel sa­id, pul­ling on his chin un­til Kyrti­an won­de­red if he was go­ing to stretch it out of sha­pe so­me­how. "Aye, and that'll gi­ve him one mo­re thing to warn the ot­hers abo­ut."</p>
   <p>    "Which will gi­ve the Co­un­cil so­met­hing el­se to think abo­ut be­si­des the Wi­zards. It might even gi­ve them a re­ason to or­der me to hold back un­til they can find ways to get the pe­op­le they want out of harms' way." Kyrti­an nod­ded as Gel's eyes wi­de­ned. "You see. You know, I ne­ver tho­ught I'd be trying to think up ways to get Kyndreth to pull our for­ces back-but that co­uld be the best stra­tegy at the mo­ment." The back of his neck ac­hed with ten­si­on, and he rub­bed it, ho­ping that a he­adac­he wasn't co­ming on. "I ne­ver tho­ught this wo­uld be so comp­li­ca­ted," he sa­id pla­in­ti­vely, to no one at all. "If I had known-"</p>
   <p>    "If you'd known, you still wo­uldn't ha­ve be­en ab­le to es­ca­pe this," Gel po­in­ted out bluntly. "Kyndreth wan­ted you; what Kyndreth wants, hap­pens."</p>
   <p>    There was no re­al ans­wer to that, and Gel knew it. Kyrti­an just sho­ok his he­ad, and win­ced a lit­tle at the start of that he­adac­he he'd ho­ped to avo­id.</p>
   <p>    He ke­yed the te­le­son with Kyndreth's se­al, pla­cing it fa­ce­down in the lit­tle ro­und dep­res­si­on ma­de for re­ce­iving such se­als in the up­per right-hand cor­ner, and with a to­uch and a word, ac­ti­va­ted the spell. As he ex­pec­ted, he con­tac­ted, not Kyndreth di­rectly, but one of the Gre­at Lord's many un­der­lings.</p>
   <p>    The pla­inly-clad El­ven­lord sta­red up at him with a so­lemn and ex­pec­tant exp­res­si­on on his long fa­ce. "Wo­uld you ple­ase consult with Lyon Lord Kyndreth?" Kyrti­an as­ked po­li­tely. "Ple­ase in­form him that I be­li­eve we ne­ed to chan­ge our bat­tle-plans." He exp­la­ined his new plans ca­re­ful­ly and the re­asons for them, whi­le the un­der­ling to­ok de­ta­iled and co­pi­o­us no­tes, oc­ca­si­onal­ly stop­ping and as­king him po­li­tely to re­pe­at or ela­bo­ra­te on so­met­hing. Kyrti­an was imp­res­sed; he'd en­co­un­te­red no few of Lord Kyrti­an's flun­ki­es who had be­en ut­terly bo­red with him and his cam­pa­ign sin­ce he'd be­en put in char­ge of the army, but this fel­low was not of that ilk.</p>
   <p>    "I'm to be yo­ur li­a­ison with Lord Kyndreth for the fo­re­se­e­ab­le fu­tu­re, Lord Kyrti­an," the un­der­ling sa­id so­lemnly. "Lord Kyndreth has ma­de it very cle­ar that yo­ur re­ports are to be gi­ven his first con­si­de­ra­ti­on, and I ha­ve the aut­ho­rity to bre­ak in upon him at any ti­me-inclu­ding in his sle­ep, if you sho­uld de­em yo­ur re­port to be suf­fi­ci­ently ur­gent."</p>
   <p>    Well, well, well. Kyrti­an blin­ked. "It's not ur­gent, sin­ce we'll still be mo­ving thro­ugh ter­ri­tory that the Yo­ung Lords ha­ve aban­do­ned for at le­ast two mo­re days, but I sho­uld li­ke to he­ar his opi­ni­on be­fo­re we bre­ak camp and mo­ve at dawn to­mor­row."</p>
   <p>    The un­der­ling ga­ve a slight bow of his he­ad. "I shall see to it that he re­ads this re­port and com­mu­ni­ca­te yo­ur re­qu­est to him wit­hin the ho­ur, Lord Kyrti­an."</p>
   <p>    The te­le­son-scre­en went blank aga­in, and Gel, who had sta­yed ca­re­ful­ly out of ran­ge for the du­ra­ti­on of the con­ver­sa­ti­on, chuck­led. "It se­ems that yo­ur va­lue has go­ne up in the world, Kyrti­an."</p>
   <p>    "So it do­es," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, and put a thin, flat pla­te of be-spel­led bron­ze over the te­le­son-scre­en, fit­ting it in­to the slight dep­res­si­on whe­re the glass had be­en in­set the­re, to pre­vent it from be­ing inad­ver­tently ac­ti­va­ted. Sho­uld so­me­one-Lord Kyndreth, ho­pe­ful­ly-wish to con­tact him whi­le the pla­te was in pla­ce, the pla­te it­self wo­uld glow and emit a ple­asant re­pe­ating chi­me to alert him. Kyrti­an al­ways "pla­ted" his te­le­son when he wasn't using it him­self; it was pos­sib­le for out­si­ders to ac­ti­va­te one's scre­en and spy on what was go­ing on wit­hin its ran­ge if they had a key to it-li­ke the ones he had to Lord Kyn-dreth's te­le­son and his mot­her's. And keys co­uld be dup­li­ca­ted by even the we­akest of ma­ges.</p>
   <p>    With the pla­te in pla­ce, he tur­ned to Gel. "Inte­res­ting, don't you think?" he as­ked. "Are you thin­king what I'm thin­king?"</p>
   <p>    "That Lord Kyndreth's own sta­tus is go­ing up be­ca­use of what you've ma­na­ged to do out he­re?" Gel co­un­te­red. At Kyrt-ian's nod, he pur­sed his lips. "If that's the ca­se, he may want you to press ahe­ad to Moth's es­ta­te any­way."</p>
   <p>    "So we ha­ve to think of an al­ter­na­te plan." The mo­re Kyrti­an tho­ught abo­ut it, the less he wan­ted to press the Yo­ung Lords now hol­ding the es­ta­te that Moth's hus­band had on­ce ow­ned. "We've got to gi­ve him a ric­her vic­tory. Not just the pos­si­bi­lity, but the re­al thing."</p>
   <p>    "Ah, hor­se turds," Gel sa­id so­urly. "You don't ask much, do you? Let me get so­me sco­uts out; may­be they can find us a ju­icy pri­ze."</p>
   <p>    He stal­ked out of the tent to ro­und up a few of the sco­uts who had, in all li­ke­li­ho­od, set­tled in at the­ir camp­fi­re and wo­uld not be ple­ased to be sent out aga­in. The sco­uts we­re all El­ven­lords, of co­ur­se-the pre­vi­o­us com­man­der had not trus­ted hu­mans to run free and act as sco­uts, and Kyrti­an was not go­ing to risk any of his own pe­op­le in this si­tu­ati­on. No­ne of them had mo­re than the ba­re mi­ni­mum of ma­gic; they we­re El­ven only by be­ne­fit of birth and blo­od. In the world of the Gre­at Lords they we­re use­ful only as over­se­ers and su­per­vi­sors of hu­mans and bre­eders of pos­sib­le ma­tes for un­mar­ri­ed sons or them­sel­ves. They we­re ex­pen­dab­le, and of­ten tre­ated wor­se than sla­ves de­emed to be mo­re va­lu­ab­le, such as tre­asu­red con­cu­bi­nes or skil­led gla­di­ators.</p>
   <p>    From the be­gin­ning, Kyrti­an tre­ated them with res­pect, and as a con­se­qu­en­ce, had gra­du­al­ly won the­ir lo­yalty to the po­int whe­re they had ac­cep­ted Gel as Kyrti­an's se­cond-in-com­mand, so­met­hing no Gre­at Lord wo­uld ever do. He to­ok pa­ins ne­ver to show them that he felt sorry for them, but he did. In the long story of the El­ven­lords in this pla­ce, next to the his­tory of the ens­la­ved and abu­sed hu­mans, the­irs was the sad­dest.</p>
   <p>    A chi­ming from the bron­ze pla­te at his el­bow bro­ke in­to his tho­ughts, and he has­tily un­co­ve­red the te­le­son.</p>
   <p>    The crag­gily hand­so­me fa­ce of Lord Kyndreth him­self sta­red up at him, and Kyrti­an ma­de a sketchy sa­lu­te. "Hrot­he­ran passed on yo­ur re­qu­est, and the re­ason for it," Kyndreth rumb­led. "My first tho­ught was that the yo­ung pups wo­uldn't da­re thre­aten harm to anot­her El­ven­lord or lady but-" he chuck­led harshly "-my next tho­ught was that they al­re­ady ha­ve."</p>
   <p>    "Well," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, "yes. Frankly, we've no way of kno­wing if the de­aths of so­me of the Les­ser Lords on the­ir es­ta­tes we­re at the hands of re­vol­ting sla­ves, or of the Yo­ung Lords. They wo­uldn't ad­mit it if they had kil­led one of us, not when they know very well how harsh the pe­nal­ti­es will be when we de­fe­at them."</p>
   <p>    Kyndreth smi­led wit­ho­ut any hu­mor. "You show a fi­ne grasp of re­ality for such a yo­ung man. I'd ex­pec­ted a lit­tle mo­re ide­alism from you un­til this last mes­sa­ge of yo­urs."</p>
   <p>    "My lord, I ha­ve stu­di­ed our his­tory sin­ce Eve­lon well eno­ugh to re­ali­ze that ho­nor is only for tho­se who can af­ford it," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, wit­ho­ut any exp­res­si­on in his vo­ice. "We ha­ve' the all the ad­van­ta­ges and can af­ford to be ho­no­rab­le; they can­not, and the only re­ason they ha­ven't ta­ken such a step be­fo­re this is pro­bably be­ca­use it hasn't oc­cur­red to them." He pa­used and ad­ded judi­ci­o­usly, "I am af­ra­id that I ha­ve not yet de­tec­ted much in the way of ima­gi­na­ti­on in the­ir tac­tics. I sho­uld not li­ke to be the one to gi­ve them ide­as that wo­uld not ha­ve ari­sen on the­ir own."</p>
   <p>    "Well sa­id. Now, I'll hand­le the Co­un­cil; you go on as you ha­ve." Kyndreth chuck­led dryly, this ti­me with just a to­uch of re­al amu­se­ment. "Gi­ven the­ir past per­for­man­ce, it's en­ti­rely pos­sib­le that the pup­pi­es will pa­nic and just aban­don the­ir strong­hold any­way when you've flan­ked them. Ke­ep me in­for­med."</p>
   <p>    "Yes, my lord," Kyrti­an sa­id, but the Gre­at Lord had al­re­ady bro­ken his spell and the con­nec­ti­on; the te­le­son-pla­te ref­lec­ted only Kyrti­an's own fa­ce.</p>
   <p>    It was Moth's own pe­op­le, and not the Yo­ung Lords he­ad­qu­ar­te­red on her old es­ta­te, who ga­ve her the as­to­nis­hing news that Kyrti­an's for­ces we­re inexp­li­cably tur­ning asi­de wit­ho­ut trying to ta­ke the Yo­ung Lords' strong­hold. She'd had the cle­ve­rest of her "boys" out sha­do­wing the army, and it was one of the­se who had co­me back in the dawn to re­port that the army was up and away at right ang­les to the­ir pre­vi­o­us li­ne of march. They we­re not me­rely cle­ver, fo­ur of them had the "hu­man ma­gic," the knack of lis­te­ning to the tho­ughts of ot­hers. When they we­re clo­se eno­ugh, they we­re ab­le to he­ar what the com­mon figh­ters and even so­me of the of­fi­cers knew, and that was in­va­lu­ab­le.</p>
   <p>    The army was now he­aded, pre­su­mably, for the tra­ining-camp that the Yo­ung Lords had set up to ret­ra­in so­me of the gla­di­ators that they had ta­ken as sol­di­ers.</p>
   <p>    "They just up and chan­ged march, Lit­tle Mot­her," the swarthy, squ­at yo­ung hu­man told her, as she kept re­fil­ling his glass and his pla­te. The "boys" ten­ded to for­get abo­ut eating and drin­king whi­le they we­re out the­re, and ca­me back star­ved and re­ady to drink a la­ke. "It's as if they got dif­fe­rent or­ders last night."</p>
   <p>    Lady Moth con­si­de­red this in­for­ma­ti­on for a mo­ment, then ma­de up her mind. "La­sen, on a fast hor­se, how long do you think it wo­uld ta­ke me to catch up to the army?" she as­ked. The man sta­red at her, un­ders­tan­ding slowly co­ming in­to his brown eyes; his brow wrink­led with con­cern so that he lo­oked li­ke a wor­ri­ed ho­und.</p>
   <p>    He knew her; he knew bet­ter than to try and dis­su­ade her. He didn't ha­ve to re­ad her tho­ughts to know what they we­re- alt­ho­ugh, if he had ca­red to, he pro­bably co­uld ha­ve, sin­ce he was one of the fo­ur with wi­zard-po­wers.</p>
   <p>    He won't tho­ugh; tho­se boys think it's im­po­li­te to he­ar tho­ughts wit­ho­ut per­mis­si­on, if you 're a fri­end. He pro­bably wo­uldn't even think of do­ing it un­less my li­fe or his was at sta­ke, the de­ar child. The­re was not­hing in her tho­ughts she ca­red to hi­de from an­yo­ne the­se days-tho­ugh when she'd be­en yo­un­ger…</p>
   <p>    "You co­uld catch them by sun­down," he told her, slowly. "But the qu­es­ti­on is, can you co­me at Lord Kyrti­an thro­ugh all of his army and co­me away aga­in back to us?" A fle­eting ghost of fe­ar tra­ve­led ac­ross his fa­ce then, and it was that fe­ar she ans­we­red be­fo­re she ad­dres­sed the spo­ken qu­es­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ve no in­ten­ti­on of aban­do­ning all of you, my lad," she sa­id fondly, and tap­ped his sho­ul­der in mock-admo­ni­ti­on with the bo­ok she was hol­ding. "Ne­ver fe­ar that; you and the rest are all the fa­mily I ha­ve now, and all the fa­mily I want. I want to talk to Kyrti­an, that's all; I think I can do a lot for all of us if I can just talk to him."</p>
   <p>    Lasen lo­oked skep­ti­cal, and Lady Moth smi­led. "Lit­tle Mot­her, this is the Army Com­man­der, not one of yo­ur Yo­ung Lords."</p>
   <p>    "He's no ol­der than the Yo­ung Lords, my lad, and what's mo­re, if you think I'm go­od to my pe­op­le, you sho­uld see his! I pled­ge you my word for it."</p>
   <p>    Lasen nod­ded slowly. Moth didn't of­ten pled­ge her word; all her hu­mans knew that when she did, she was be­yond cer­ta­in of what she pro­mi­sed. A lit­tle of the con­cern cle­ared from his fa­ce.</p>
   <p>    "As for get­ting in and out-" she chuck­led "-no fe­ar the­re, eit­her. So long as the­re isn't anot­her El­ven­lord I ha­ve to out­wit, I'll get in and out aga­in."</p>
   <p>    "I'll ha­ve Star­fo­ot sad­dled and wa­iting-and it's myself that will co­me with you, then," La­sen sa­id, in a vo­ice that told her that he wo­uld be just as stub­born as she on that po­int. She inc­li­ned her he­ad in ta­cit ag­re­ement, and went off to tell Vi­ri­di­na what she in­ten­ded, and to chan­ge her gown for so­met­hing mo­re su­ited to the task at hand.</p>
   <p>    Lasen wa­ited at the do­or of the stab­le, Star­fo­ot and anot­her hor­se sad­dled and re­ady, when she ar­ri­ved, clad in bre­ec­hes and som­ber tu­nic of brown do­es­kin. Star­fo­ot was a ma­re so na­med, not be­ca­use she was lo­vely (for in ac­tu­al fact she was as ugly as a mud-pie and scrawny as a sap­ling), but be­ca­use she was fle­et as any sho­oting-star. She was per­fect for such a task; her mud-co­lor wo­uld hi­de her, just as the brown of Moth's clot­hing wo­uld ser­ve the sa­me pur­po­se. La­sen had cho­sen anot­her mud-co­lo­red, swift hor­se, a gel­ding that was Star­fo­ot's half-brot­her, and al­re­ady wo­re dust-grey tu­nic and bre­ec­hes for the sa­me ca­mo­uf­la­ging pur­po­se.</p>
   <p>    And La­sen had one ot­her ad­van­ta­ge as her gu­ide and gu­ard; he had the hu­man ma­gic of spe­aking and he­aring in tho­ughts. No one wo­uld get ne­ar to them wit­ho­ut him kno­wing, and they co­uld avo­id the army's own sco­uts and sent­ri­es easily. That was the one thing that idi­ot El­ven­lords al­ways for­get, Moth tho­ught so­urly, as she mo­un­ted Star­fo­ot a lit­tle stiffly. Hu­man magic ma­kes it pos­sib­le for them to know long be­fo­re an enemy ar­ri­ves.</p>
   <p>    It was a long, hard ri­de, even for Moth, who was used to ri­ding the bo­unds of her own es­ta­te every day. They did not stop ex­cept to rest the hor­ses and al­low them to drink and snatch a mo­uth­ful of oats. And it was af­ter sun­set when they fi­nal­ly saw the camp­fi­res of Kyrti­an's army from the top of a hill, li­ke stran­ge, yel­low stars sprink­led ac­ross the hil­lsi­de op­po­si­te them.</p>
   <p>    Lasen sta­red at the en­camp­ment. "The pas­sword is 'A fi­ne sa­tin she­ep,'" he sa­id, af­ter a mo­ment's pa­use.</p>
   <p>    "Sheep? Not she­et?" she as­ked, nonp­lu­sed.</p>
   <p>    "Definitely she­ep," he rep­li­ed. "They're using non­sen­se phra­ses just to ma­ke things a bit mo­re se­cu­re."</p>
   <p>    Moth dis­mo­un­ted; no ne­ed to or­der La­sen to watch the hor­ses and lie con­ce­aled whi­le she ma­de her way in­to the army. He va­nis­hed in­to the dark­ness be­hind her; she wor­ked her ma­gic on her­self.</p>
   <p>    She was al­re­ady as thin and bony as many hu­man men, and her lo­ose tu­nic con­ce­aled what the­re was of her fi­gu­re. With her long ha­ir knot­ted on the top of her he­ad and hid­den be­ne­ath a cap, she ne­eded only to al­ter her ap­pe­aran­ce a trif­le to pass as a sla­ve: ro­und her ears, dar­ken her skin, and so long as she kept her he­ad down, simply dar­ke­ning her eyes wo­uld suf­fi­ce to hi­de what she was.</p>
   <p>    And the ma­gic of el­ven wo­men, af­ter all, was to al­ter small things…</p>
   <p>    It hurt; that was the worst of it. Her ears bur­ned as if she had dip­ped them in bo­iling wa­ter as she ro­un­ded the po­ints, and she bit her net­her lip un­til it bled to ke­ep from crying out. Then it was the turn of her eyes-not so dif­fi­cult, this, to chan­ge the co­lor, and not as pa­in­ful.</p>
   <p>    Then, fol­lo­wing the whis­pe­red con­ver­sa­ti­on that La­sen had gi­ven her be­fo­re he va­nis­hed, she wal­ked in­to the army en­camp­ment. Thanks to La­sen she had the pas­sword she ne­eded to pass the sent­ri­es qu­ite as if she was part of the army her­self. No one even ga­ve her a se­cond glan­ce.</p>
   <p>    As she stro­de stiffly among the camp­fi­res, in the flic­ke­ring light from fi­re and torch that ma­de it pos­sib­le to pull off the next part of her ru­se, she kept a sharp eye out for so­met­hing she co­uld use to get up as far as, and even in­to, Kyrti­an's tent. One pi­ece at a ti­me, she ma­na­ged to pil­fer a tray, a pla­te, and a ro­ugh-hewn wo­oden cup; with a bre­ath of her own ma­gic, they ac­qu­ired a pa­ti­na of sil­ver. Wa­ter to­ok on the rosy hue of wi­ne, and a co­up­le of chunks of wo­od be­ca­me me­at, che­ese and bre­ad, at le­ast on the sur­fa­ce. A snatc­hed hand­ful of we­eds trans­for­med in­to tasty-lo­oking "gar­den" gre­ens put the fi­nal to­uc­hes on. This all lo­oked edib­le (altho­ugh it wasn't) but by no me­ans mo­re than a scant to­uch abo­ve the or­di­nary sol­di­ers' ra-. ti­ons. She knew her nep­hew; knew that was what he wo­uld eat by cho­ice. She didn't want her ex­cu­se for ent­ran­ce to be snatc­hed away by the of­fi­ci­o­us ser­vant of so­me les­ser El­ven-lord just be­ca­use it lo­oked tasty eno­ugh to be ap­pe­ti­zing to his mas­ter!</p>
   <p>    By this ti­me she was well up to the clus­ter of tents of the com­man­ders; the lar­ger si­ze of Kyrti­an's ma­de it ob­vi­o­us which was his. The­re we­re gu­ards on the tent, but her age, si­ze, and bur­den ma­de her sta­tus and er­rand ob­vi­o­us, and they ga­ve her the me­rest of cur­sory on­ce-overs to en­su­re that she wasn't ar­med be­fo­re hol­ding the flap asi­de and sen­ding her in.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian and his hu­man sha­dow Gel we­re bent over maps, se­emingly ob­li­vi­o­us to anyt­hing el­se. She cle­ared her thro­at os­ten­ta­ti­o­usly.</p>
   <p>    Neither of them tur­ned aro­und, or even so much as star­ted. "We know you're the­re," Gel sa­id cros­sly-which re­li­eved her so­mew­hat, sin­ce she'd be­en a lit­tle alar­med at how easily she had got­ten clo­se to her nep­hew, unc­hal­len­ged. "Put it down and get out."</p>
   <p>    "That's a fi­ne way to talk to yo­ur Lord's aunt," she rep­li­ed, lo­udly eno­ugh so they co­uld he­ar her, but softly eno­ugh that her vo­ice sho­uldn't carry to the gu­ards out­si­de.</p>
   <p>    They pi­vo­ted so fast to lo­ok at her, the­ir eyes so wi­de and shoc­ked, that she chuck­led.</p>
   <p>    "Moth? Moth?" Kyrti­an squ­e­aked.</p>
   <p>    "Voice just now star­ting to bre­ak, boy?" Moth rep­li­ed with a grin, put­ting down her ine­dib­le bur­den. "Always knew everyt­hing abo­ut you was slow to grow but yo­ur mind, but isn't that a bit much?"</p>
   <p>    "So, that's the si­tu­ati­on, then," Kyrti­an fi­nis­hed. The ar­ri­val of his aunt on his very do­ors­tep-and dis­gu­ised as a hu­man sla­ve, no less!-had be­en so­met­hing of a shock. A ple­asant shock, ho­we­ver. "And I don't mind tel­ling you that I've be­en scramb­ling to find so­me ex­cu­se not to res­cue you." He and Moth had be­en tal­king nons­top for so long that they we­re both ho­ar­se, and on­ce he got over his surp­ri­se, he had ne­ver be­en so glad to see an­yo­ne in his li­fe.</p>
   <p>    "Well," she ru­mi­na­ted. "You can see why I was in no gre­at hurry to be res­cu­ed. The­se yo­ung re­bels are still not the best ans­wer to our tro­ub­les, but they're a damn sight bet­ter than the­ir fat­hers."</p>
   <p>    He re­ac­hed for a pitc­her of so­met­hing she had co­nj­ured up out of wa­ter, a hand­ful of blos­soms and a bit of ma­gic and po­ured cups of the stuff for both of them. Wha­te­ver it was, it had as go­od an ef­fect on a ho­ar­se thro­at as ho­ne­yed tea. "I don't know what to do," he ad­mit­ted. "I can't stop com­man­ding the army-it will just me­an hu­mans sla­ugh­te­ring hu­mans. At le­ast this way I'm ke­eping blo­ods­hed to a mi­ni­mum. But if I de­fe­at the Yo­ung Lords, mot­her thinks the Gre­at Lords will turn the army aga­inst the Wi­zards, and ne­ver mind the tre­aty."</p>
   <p>    "Your mot­her's right," Moth sa­id so­urly, her mo­uth twis­ted up in­to a scowl. "The­re was ne­ver an ag­re­ement re­ac­hed by any of the Gre­at Lords that wasn't bro­ken as so­on as one or the ot­her of them co­uld ma­na­ge it, and that's a fact you'd bet­ter get used to. The­re's no ho­nor among them; yo­ur co­usin is just a bit mo­re open abo­ut his tre­ac­hery than most of them are. If he was go­od, he'd ha­ve had yo­ur es­ta­te ye­ars ago."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian co­uld only sha­ke his he­ad. Sin­ce ta­king com­mand, he had got­ten one examp­le af­ter anot­her of the dup­li­city of his own ra­ce, and he was still ha­ving a hard ti­me get­ting used to it. What was the po­int of all this do­ub­le-and trip­le-cros­sing, any­way? Wasn't the world wi­de eno­ugh for ever­yo­ne to pros­per?</p>
   <p>    Evidently not, or at le­ast, not so far as the Gre­at Lords we­re con­cer­ned.</p>
   <p>    Gel's sar­do­nic exp­res­si­on and oc­ca­si­onal sar­cas­tic com­ments had ma­de it very cle­ar that he was not anyw­he­re ne­ar as in­no­cent as Kyrti­an had be­en. And, all things con­si­de­red, Lady Lydi­ell pro­bably wasn't eit­her.</p>
   <p>    "Look," Gel sa­id, bre­aking in­to his tho­ughts. "We ne­ed a plan, and I think I ha­ve one, but it de­pends on Moth's abi­lity to sca­re the whey out of the­se pet re­bels of hers." He ra­ised an eyeb­row at her. "Can you?"</p>
   <p>    "Depends on what you and this army of yo­urs can do," she tem­po­ri­zed. "What's the plan?"</p>
   <p>    "You can go as yo­ur­self to this tra­ining-camp. The gla­di­ators will trust yo­ur hu­mans, I sus­pect; figh­ters tend to trust ot­her figh­ters. Wha­te­ver it ta­kes, see if you can get them to lis­ten to you and ag­ree to what you want to do."</p>
   <p>    She smi­led. "It won't ta­ke much," she told them both, we­aring an exp­res­si­on that told them she was migh­tily ple­ased with her­self. "I can ne­ga­te the­ir col­lars; I've eno­ugh bits of iron to do that. We've do­ne so­me ex­pe­ri­men­ting, and all it ta­kes is a thin she­et of it slip­ped in be­hind and aro­und the lock and beryl, and you can pry the col­lar off wit­ho­ut hur­ting the sla­ve. I al­ways carry a few pi­eces with me now, just in ca­se."</p>
   <p>    "Hah!" Gel hit the tab­le with his fist, gre­atly ple­ased. "Go­od! You tell 'em that when we at­tack, if they scat­ter ins­te­ad of figh­ting, we'll open up our li­nes at a par­ti­cu­lar po­int in­si­de the fo­rest to let 'em thro­ugh, then swal­low them up in­to the army." Kyrti­an im­me­di­ately saw what Gel had in mind-they had a cad­re of figh­ters that Gel trus­ted tra­ined up now, who we­re ac­tu­al­ly lo­yal to Kyrti­an. So even if, say, Lord Kyndreth was watc­hing via ma­gic, all he wo­uld see was that the enemy gla­di­ators scat­te­red and not­hing mo­re. He al­so had a go­od idea what Gel was go­ing to sug­gest next.</p>
   <p>    "Then," he to­ok over, "Moth, you go to yo­ur re­bels, and sug­gest that they bre­ak up and get out of the es­ta­tes; ta­ke to the hills with small gro­ups to avo­id be­ing cap­tu­red, and start a gu­er­ril­la war."</p>
   <p>    His aunt ab­sor­bed all this for a mo­ment, then a smi­le bro­ke out on her fa­ce. "I see! I sca­re the yo­ungs­ters, by tel­ling them what I per­so­nal­ly wit­nes­sed of the sla­ugh­ter of the­ir best tro­ops, and con­vin­ce them that they can't pos­sibly hold out di­rectly. They aban­don the es­ta­tes, or at le­ast the ones that still ha­ve ol­der re­la­ti­ves among the Gre­at Lords to cla­im them- which is half of what the­ir fat­hers want. I can be 'res­cu­ed' and ser­ve as the­ir eyes and ears in­to what the­ir fat­hers are up to- which gi­ves you eyes and ears in­to what they're do­ing, so you can ar­ran­ge things to yo­ur li­king. You still ha­ve a war that you can fight in tiny skir­mis­hes, wit­ho­ut ever co­ming to a conc­lu­si­on." Her grin wi­de­ned. "I can even of­fer to hi­de the ring­le­aders and so­me of the rest on the pro­perty I hold now, and they can run the­ir fight from the­re."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian ga­ve her a lit­tle bow of res­pect. She sho­uld ha­ve be­en a ge­ne­ral. "Which me­ans the Gre­at Lords won't send me aga­inst the Wi­zards, at le­ast, not for a whi­le." He con­si­de­red the next mo­ve in the plan. "We can de­lay things for a whi­le, whi­le I try and co­me up with a bet­ter so­lu­ti­on."</p>
   <p>    Lady Moth la­ug­hed moc­kingly. "And my re­ward is to get my hus­band's es­ta­te back, which is no bad bri­be for my comp­li­city, boy."</p>
   <p>    "There has to be so­met­hing in this bar­ga­in for you, my Lady," he de­mur­red. She sho­ok her he­ad at him.</p>
   <p>    "I think this will work for a whi­le, any­way," Gel vo­iced his own opi­ni­on. "I li­ke it. And I've got no par­ti­cu­lar obj­ec­ti­on to patc­hing to­get­her tem­po­rary so­lu­ti­ons for the next two de­ca­des."</p>
   <p>    Lady Moth sto­od up. "Ti­me for me to go. Boy, when you ha­ve the ti­me, find an ex­cu­se to co­me to the es­ta­te-I've fo­und so­me things in the lib­rary I think will in­te­rest you."</p>
   <p>    She didn't was­te ti­me on fa­re­wel­ls; Lady Moth was not one to was­te ti­me on anyt­hing, as Kyrti­an re­cal­led. A bri­ef emb­ra­ce for him, and a sketchy sa­lu­te for Gel was all she ga­ve, then she was out of the tent and back on her way to her wa­iting hu­man es­cort.</p>
   <p>    Gel fol­lo­wed her out, to be su­re she got back sa­fely thro­ugh the li­nes. Whi­le he was go­ne, Kyrti­an fol­ded the maps, ti­di­ed the tent, and re­mo­ved the bron­ze pla­que from the te­le­son. He wan­ted to talk to Lady Lydi­ell abo­ut this whi­le it was all still fresh in his mind. It was worth the chan­ce of be­ing "over­he­ard," alt­ho­ugh gi­ven that this was a very odd ho­ur to be tal­king to her, that was less li­kely this ti­me.</p>
   <p>    Lydiell lis­te­ned to his bri­ef sum­mary with her eyes alight. "If this had be­en an­yo­ne ot­her than Moth, I wo­uld ha­ve sa­id it was too go­od to be true," she sa­id when he was fi­nis­hed. "But it is Moth, and frankly, it's exactly the sort of thing I wo­uld ex­pect out of her. Well-lo­ok what she's do­ne on her own, dis­co­ve­ring how to ne­ga­te the col­lar-spel­ls and get them off wit­ho­ut hur­ting the sla­ves!"</p>
   <p>    "Useful bit of in­for­ma­ti­on, that," Kyrti­an mur­mu­red, thin­king out lo­ud. "It wo­uld ha­ve to be a hu­man that did it, tho­ugh; I wo­uldn't want to chan­ce eit­her po­iso­ning by the me­tal or ma­gi­cal back­lash. Mot­her, how am I go­ing to ke­ep Lord Kyndreth from sus­pec­ting that so­met­hing is up when all re­sis­tan­ce sud­denly melts away?"</p>
   <p>    "By sta­ging mo­re of a ro­ut at this next mock-bat­tle than you're li­kely to get from the hand­ful of for­mer gla­di­ators the­re," she sa­id ins­tantly. "You and I will cre­ate a Ga­te from he­re to the­re, and we'll send thro­ugh all of our pe­op­le that can fight. They'll po­se as sla­ves of the Yo­ung Lords-they'll hold a li­ne, then bre­ak and ro­ut-stra­ight back to the Ga­te and ho­me. That will gi­ve you so­met­hing to con­vin­ce Kyndreth that you've won a conc­lu­si­ve vic­tory."</p>
   <p>    "A Ga­te? Can I do that?" he as­ked do­ubt­ful­ly. "Am I strong eno­ugh?"</p>
   <p>    "Not by yo­ur­self-but re­mem­ber what you dis­co­ve­red abo­ut com­bi­ning ma­gic from se­ve­ral pe­op­le?" she co­un­te­red. "You ha­ve me and the ot­hers he­re; to­get­her we will ha­ve qu­ite eno­ugh to cre­ate a Ga­te."</p>
   <p>    He nod­ded, and be­gan to fe­el mo­re con­fi­dent. "Per­haps I sho­uld in­vi­te Lord Kyndreth to ob­ser­ve?"</p>
   <p>    "At a dis­tan­ce," she ans­we­red. "With the Co­un­cil. The­re's an old vi­ewing-te­le­son in the Co­un­cil Cham­ber; they pro­bably ha­ven't used it sin­ce the di­sast­ro­us de­bac­le with Lord Dyran."</p>
   <p>    "But if I cho­ose whe­re to put the te­le­son-sen­der, they'll see what I want them to see." This was co­ming out bet­ter and bet­ter. "And with all of the Gre­at Lords jost­ling abo­ut, they aren't go­ing to no­ti­ce the Ga­te-"</p>
   <p>    "They won't no­ti­ce it any­way," Lydi­ell sa­id with con­fi­den­ce. "It's very no­isy, but they won't be ex­pec­ting it and they'll be too far away. They'd ha­ve to know so­met­hing li­ke that was go­ing on."</p>
   <p>    "Oh, I can co­ver it with so­me le­vin-bolts any­way," Kyrti­an de­ci­ded. "They'd be ex­pec­ting so­met­hing of the sort. Mot­her- I think this is go­ing to work-"</p>
   <p>    "I ne­ver do­ub­ted that you wo­uld find a way," she sa­id se­re­nely.</p>
   <p>    When they en­ded the­ir con­ver­sa­ti­on, and he had co­ve­red the te­le­son-scre­en aga­in, he wa­ited im­pa­ti­ently for Gel to re­turn so that he co­uld work out all the de­ta­ils of this ad­di­ti­on to the plan.</p>
   <p>    For the first ti­me sin­ce he had ta­ken over the com­mand of the Gre­at Lords' army, he be­gan to ho­pe he co­uld sa­ve, not only his own pe­op­le, but ever­yo­ne in­vol­ved. Or at le­ast, al­most ever­yo­ne. And that was so much mo­re than he had ever tho­ught he'd be ab­le to do, that he felt as if he had just drunk an en­ti­re bot­tle of spark­ling wi­ne.</p>
   <p>    Now, let's ho­pe all this do­esn't pro­ve to be as ep­he­me­ral as wi­ne-joy!</p>

   <p>    The ears out­si­de Lord Kyrti­an's tent are a lot ke­ener than he has any re­ason to gu­ess, Ke­man tho­ught with glee, as he he­ard Kyrti­an conc­lu­ding the se­cond con­ver­sa­ti­on of the day with Lady Lydi­ell. So, El­ven­lord, why ha­ven't you fi­gu­red out that you ha­ve dra­gons on yo­ur do­ors­tep-li­te­ral­ly?</p>
   <p>    Keman, Sha­na's fos­ter-brot­her, was, of co­ur­se, that dra­gon. So was his part­ner in this spying en­de­avor, alt­ho­ugh she ca­me from a La­ir that had ne­ver known the­re we­re ot­her dra­gons in the world un­til she met him. Dra­gons, with the­ir abi­lity to sha­pec­han­ge in­to vir­tu­al­ly anyt­hing they cho­se, we­re uni­qu­ely su­ited to spying on the El­ves, who co­uld easily crack any dis­gu­ise wro­ught with il­lu­si­ons. In spi­te of the fact that in his re­al form he was easily forty or fifty ti­mes the bulk of even the stron­gest and tal­lest ma­le hu­man (or Elf) he'd ever se­en, the dra­co­nic gift of be­ing ab­le to push mass and we­ight el­sew­he­re-they cal­led it, "into the Out"-ma­de it pos­sib­le for him to mas­qu­era­de as even a small child.</p>
   <p>    He and Do­ra had sha­pec­han­ged them­sel­ves in­to hu­man figh­ters and in­si­nu­ated them­sel­ves in­to the Gre­at Lords' army as so­on as it be­ca­me ob­vi­o­us that this new com­man­der was just as bril­li­ant as the old one had be­en in­com­pe­tent. When they first be­gan this task on Sha­na's be­half, they had go­ne from one Gre­at Lord's ho­use­hold to anot­her in the forms of va­ri­o­us sla­ves-sin­ce no Gre­at Lord ever bot­he­red to ta­ke no­te of a me­re hu­man so long as he didn't di­so­bey and had no hint of ma­gic as an Elf un­ders­to­od it abo­ut him. They had ac­tu­al­ly be­en in Lord Kyndreth's ho­use­hold as a pa­ir of pa­ges when the first news of Lord Kyrti­an's vic­to­ri­es ca­me in. From the­re it had be­en a mat­ter of simp­li­city to in­si­nu­ate them­sel­ves in­to the com­pany of figh­ters the Gre­at Lord sent to aug­ment the army.</p>
   <p>    The only hard part had be­en slip­ping away at night every so of­ten to hunt, for a dra­gon ne­eded vastly mo­re fo­od than a hu­man. Even that hadn't be­en too hor­ribly dif­fi­cult, and they had be­en ke­eping Sha­na in­for­med fa­ith­ful­ly of all that this new com­man­der was do­ing. It had ta­ken him a lit­tle ti­me to get used to his part­ner's out­ward ap­pe­aran­ce, ho­we­ver; ha­ving a griz­zled, musc­le-bo­und, surly ma­le lo­ok at him whi­le he was he­aring Do­ra's vo­ice in his mind was a lit­tle un­set­tling. And it hardly ne­eded to be sa­id that whi­le they we­re in the­se gu­ises, they co­uld not even ma­ke the most ca­su­al of af­fec­ti­ona­te ges­tu­res to­wards one anot­her, not even the sorts of things that had be­en pos­sib­le as pa­ges. Only when they flew in the­ir own sha­pes co­uld he co­urt her as she de­ser­ved.</p>
   <p>    Keman and Do­ra we­ren't the gu­ards just out­si­de the tent flaps of Lord Kyrti­an's tent-that po­si­ti­on was re­ser­ved for the handful of men that Ser­ge­ant Gel had tes­ted and tri­ed and fo­und trust­worthy. For one thing, alt­ho­ugh both dra­gons might lo­ok li­ke figh­ters, they didn't ha­ve any re­al skill with the for­mi­dab­le we­apons that they held-skill did not co­me with the sha­pe, alas. They hadn't even be­en among the vo­lun­te­ers ho­ping for such a po­si­ti­on. No, they we­re gu­ar­ding the wa­gons hol­ding the pos­ses­si­ons of the ot­her El­ven­lords ser­ving as Kyrti­an's of­fi­cers, pos­ses­si­ons which had not be­en un­pac­ked for days (much to the disg­runt­le­ment of the­ir ow­ners) sin­ce the spe­ed of march had not per­mit­ted the kind of le­isu­rely cam­ping with lu­xu­ri­es that the pre­vi­o­us com­man­der had al­lo­wed.</p>
   <p>    It was a go­od thing that dark­ness clo­aked any fa­int signs of his im­pa­ti­en­ce, for Ke­man co­uld hardly con­ta­in him­self. They had known for so­me ti­me that Lord Kyrti­an was very un­li­ke Lord Le­ve­lis, the pre­vi­o­us com­man­der, in mo­re ways than simp­le com­pe­ten­ce. For one thing, his met­hod of tra­ining was as­to­un­ding-using ma­gic to co­un­ter­fe­it bla­des and ot­her we­apons, so that it was pos­sib­le to ac­qu­ire re­al skill wit­ho­ut ever get­ting hurt! For the first ti­me, a hu­man sla­ve de­le­ga­ted to the po­si­ti­on of "figh­ter" sto­od a de­cent chan­ce of sur­vi­ving- and wo­uld ma­na­ge to get thro­ugh his tra­ining pe­ri­od wit­ho­ut be­ing kil­led or ma­imed.</p>
   <p>    That in and of it­self had bro­ught ex­ci­te­ment among the ranks to a fe­ver pitch, but the­re was so­on mo­re to re­j­o­ice in. Ru­mor in the ranks had so­on be­en pro­ved truth-that Lord Kyrti­an ac­tu­al­ly ca­red abo­ut the hu­mans who ser­ved in the ranks and was not inc­li­ned to throw them in­to com­bat and use them up the way his pre­de­ces­sor had. But un­til to­night they had not re­ali­zed how wildly dif­fe­rent his at­ti­tu­des to­ward hu­mans we­re from tho­se of ot­her El­ven­lords!</p>
   <p>    It se­emed that Lady Moth and the la­te and la­men­ted Lord Va-lyn we­re not the only ones of the­ir kind to re­gard hu­mans as so­met­hing ot­her than obj­ects of pos­ses­si­on, cre­atu­res des­ti­ned by birth to ser­ve and be con­su­med and tos­sed away at the whims of the­ir El­ven mas­ters. Even the re­bel­li­o­us Yo­ung Lords had pro­ved so­met­hing of a di­sap­po­int­ment on­ce they had a mo­di­cum of po­wer-the hu­mans un­der the­ir cont­rol might not ha­ve to fe­ar the ter­rib­le pu­nish­ments inf­lic­ted on them by ma­gic anymore, but they we­re still sla­ves, and tre­ated as such. Not so with Lord Kyrti­an, who­se very se­cond-in-com­mand was a hu­man, much to the furt­her disg­runt­le­ment of the El­ven­lords ser­ving as of­fi­cers.</p>
   <p>    Wait un­til Sha­na he­ars all this! he tho­ught, hardly ab­le to con­ta­in him­self and wa­it for the next shift of gu­ards to co­me and re­li­eve them.</p>
   <p>    It was cle­ar to Ke­man at le­ast that so­me­one from the Wi­zards was go­ing to ha­ve to ap­pro­ach Lord Kyrti­an. They co­uldn't af­ford not to, now. It was cle­ar from his two con­ver­sa­ti­ons that he did not want to find him­self for­ced to hunt down the Wi­zards, which he wo­uld, if he ma­na­ged to de­fe­at the Yo­ung Lords.</p>
   <p>    What was mo­re, it was en­ti­rely li­kely that he co­uld find them and be­at them in com­bat. The one thing that had sa­ved them in the past was that the El­ven­lords had used mostly ma­gic aga­inst the Wi­zards-and the Wi­zards had used mostly ma­gic aga­inst the­ir fo­es. The prob­lem was that the Wi­zards' ma­in de­fen­se now was the use of iron-which was bril­li­ant, but did pre­vent them from using ma­gic of­fen­si­vely. The dra­gons co­uld help, but they we­re as vul­ne­rab­le to re­al we­apons as hu­mans and halfb­lo­ods we­re-and Lord Kyrti­an co­uld fi­eld an army of sla­ves that wo­uld ha­ve no dif­fi­culty in de­fe­ating any Wi­zard army.</p>
   <p>    Unless, of co­ur­se, the Iron Pe­op­le co­uld be con­vin­ced to help. Ah, but why sho­uld they? Why sho­uld they ac­tu­al­ly fight, when they them­sel­ves we­re in no re­al dan­ger from the El­ven­lords and they co­uld al­ways go back to the so­uth and sa­fety? The­ir le­ader, the Iron Pri­est Di­ric, cer­ta­inly li­ked Sha­na and her fri­ends, but he was a prag­ma­tic sort, and he co­uld lo­se his po­si­ti­on if he ad­vo­ca­ted so­met­hing that wo­uld bring dan­ger to the Iron Pe­op­le with lit­tle or no re­ward.</p>
   <p>    Ah, but now they knew that Lord Kyrti­an didn't want to fight the Wi­zards. True, he might find him­self in the po­si­ti­on whe­re he had to ap­pe­ar to fight them, but if the Wi­zards we­re in sec­ret part­ners­hip with Lord Kyrti­an, he co­uld obey the or­ders to do so with every ap­pe­aran­ce of obe­di­en­ce to the Co­un­cil. If, for ins­tan­ce, he knew whe­re the Wi­zards ac­tu­al­ly we­re, he co­uld hunt un­suc­ces­sful­ly, but du­ti­ful­ly, everyw­he­re that they we­ren't un­til the Co­un­cil got ti­red of it all and dis­ban­ded the army.</p>
   <p>    Sooner or la­ter they wo­uld do just that; es­pe­ci­al­ly if the Wi­zards we­re ab­le to help in that di­rec­ti­on. It wo­uldn't be dif­fi­cult to sta­ge sce­nes of aban­do­ned camps and gre­at de­so­la­ti­on, to ma­ke it lo­ok as if, on­ce cha­sed from the ha­ven of the Ci­ta­del, the Wi­zards had fo­und it im­pos­sib­le to sur­vi­ve in the wil­der­ness.</p>
   <p>    Keman's tho­ughts fil­led with con­tempt for the "Old Whin-ers." They wo­uld ha­ve had that very prob­lem if it hadn't be­en for Sha­na and the dra­gons. Ca­el­lach Gwa­in and the ot­hers li­ke him we­re no mo­re equ­ip­ped to ta­ke ca­re of them­sel­ves than the pam­pe­red El­ven­lords them­sel­ves wo­uld ha­ve be­en if strip­ped of ma­gi­cal po­wers. Put so­me for­lorn "set­tle­ments" to­get­her,. ma­de of mud huts with crumb­ling walls and ca­ved-in ro­ofs, and scat­ter a few bo­nes abo­ut, and le­ave them for Lord Kyrti­an to "dis­co­ver" and the El­ven­lords might be con­vin­ced that if any halfb­lo­ods did sur­vi­ve they we­re not worth pur­su­ing.</p>
   <p>    And then, Ke­man tho­ught, when we're se­cu­re aga­in, we might even be ab­le to sec­retly tra­de with Lord Kyrti­an for things that we ne­ed. Alt­ho­ugh he li­ked Di­ric and the Iron Pe­op­le, and the folk of the Tra­der clans, enor­mo­usly, it ma­de him very une­asy that the Wi­zards now de­pen­ded on the­se two sets of re­la­ti­ve stran­gers (who af­ter all had agen­das of the­ir own) for the things they co­uldn't pro­du­ce them­sel­ves. Ke­man co­uld ne­ver for­get that the Iron Pe­op­le had on­ce held him, Sha­na, Me­ro, and Fat­her Dra­gon cap­ti­ve-Iron Pri­est Di­ric had ne­arly be­en top­pled from his se­at of po­wer on­ce, and it co­uld hap­pen aga­in. Ke­man wo­uld rat­her that his fri­ends and fos­ter-sis­ter had one mo­re la­yer to the­ir net of sur­vi­val.</p>
   <p>    The Wi­zards had on­ce sto­len what they wan­ted from the sup­ply-wa­gons of the El­ven­lords them­sel­ves, but that had all co­me to an end when the El­ven­lords re­ali­zed that they still exis­ted and we­re pil­fe­ring sup­pli­es. Such thefts we­re too dan­ge­ro­us now and, in fact, had be­en for­bid­den by the te­nu­o­us tre­aty that the El­ven­lords had ag­re­ed to with them-but the Wi­zards we­re not crafts­folk or ter­ribly suc­ces­sful far­mers. Hun­ters-oh my, yes-they me­rely had to ma­gi­cal­ly trans­port an ani­mal from the fo­rest or fi­elds by ma­gic to kill it, and even the le­ast skil­led of them co­uld do that, for ma­gic was one stal­ker that no be­ast co­uld scent. Me­at of all sorts they had in abun­dan­ce, and hides, and the rat­her lo­vely horns of ali­corns, but the best they we­re ab­le to do in the way of ag­ri­cul­tu­re was a bit of ve­ge­tab­le-gar­de­ning. Sha­na, one of the few Wi­zards to ma­na­ge the trans­por­ta­ti­on spell that enab­led her to mo­ve li­ving cre­atu­res in­tact, had be­en ab­le to bring the flock of she­ep that had be­en at the old Ci­ta­del, and had pur­lo­ined so­me chic­kens that had stra­yed and so we­re tech­ni­cal­ly not El­ven­lord pro­perty. Ke­man and Ka­la­ma­dea had bro­ught them go­ats, and even hor­ses, but the ter­ra­in aro­und the ca­ves they had ta­ken to li­ve in was simply un­su­ited for cul­ti­va­ting gra­in.</p>
   <p>    And as for crafts, well, at so­me po­int they we­re go­ing to run out of cloth, and the­re we­ren't mo­re than a do­zen of the ful­ly-hu­man ex-sla­ves among them that knew how to spin and we­ave. The­re was one sing­le pot­ter, and no glas­sma­kers. As for me­tal-smiths, well, the less sa­id, the bet­ter. True, the Iron Pe­op­le had smiths in plenty, but they we­re down in the pla­in, and thus far the­re hadn't be­en a gre­at de­al that the Wi­zards co­uld pro­vi­de that the Iron Pe­op­le wan­ted in tra­de.</p>
   <p>    At le­ast three qu­ar­ters of that lack of skil­led wor­kers was due to the at­ti­tu­des of Ca­el­lach Gwa­in and his cro­ni­es. What sen­sib­le wild hu­man or even a for­mer sla­ve, es­pe­ci­al­ly one with skills and a tra­de, wo­uld ca­re to set­tle among pe­op­le who re­gar­ded him as an in­fe­ri­or pe­on who sho­uld be happy to ser­ve his "bet­ters" with no tho­ught for com­pen­sa­ti­on? No few of the sla­ves that had es­ca­ped du­ring the Yo­ung Lord's ini­ti­al re­volt had set­tled bri­efly with the Wi­zards then drif­ted off with the Tra­ders to set­tle el­sew­he­re.</p>
   <p>    They're as bad as the El­ven­lords, Ke­man tho­ught, not for the first ti­me.</p>
   <p>    For now they we­re rel­ying on the things that had on­ce be­en stock­pi­led in the Ci­ta­del; they hadn't be­en ab­le to carry tho­se things away with them, but the Ci­ta­del had so­me­how re­ma­ined un­pe­net­ra­ted-or at le­ast, no one had bot­he­red to lo­ot it or dest­roy what was in it. Sha­na had te­ams of the yo­un­ger wi­zards wor­king to­get­her to trans­port everyt­hing pos­sib­le out of the­re and in­to the hands of tho­se who ac­tu­al­ly ow­ned the things or in­to the sto­ra­ge-ro­oms of the­ir new ho­me. So­me things we­re in surp­lus-anything that didn't get used up or suf­fer much from wear and te­ar. Ne­vert­he­less, they had mo­re-many mo­re- bo­di­es to clot­he and mo­uths to fe­ed than they'd had back when only halfb­lo­oded Wi­zards li­ved in the old Ci­ta­del.</p>
   <p>    But if they co­uld set up a tra­ding-agre­ement with a re­al El-ven es­ta­te… well, then the­ir trans­por­ta­ti­on ma­gics co­uld be used to swap hi­des and me­at, raw lum­ber, even the gems and pre­ci­o­us me­tals that we­re so easy for the dra­gons to co­ax up out of the earth, for most of tho­se things that they now de­pen­ded on the Tra­ders and Iron Pe­op­le for.</p>
   <p>    Don't de­pend on that egg to hatch just yet, Ke­man, he war­ned him­self. Re­port to Sha­na first. It's mo­re im­por­tant to get to the po­int whe­re we 've got an ag­re­ement with this Kyrti­an that will pre­vent him and the army from co­ming af­ter us!</p>
   <p>    Their re­li­ef party ar­ri­ved just then, two strip­ling hu­mans that had be­en rec­ru­ited from the ranks of the gla­di­ators and lo­oked it-musc­led everyw­he­re, inc­lu­ding bet­we­en the­ir ears. They pre­sen­ted them­sel­ves with the pro­per pas­sword, and he and Do­ra gra­te­ful­ly sur­ren­de­red the­ir arms to the new sent­ri­es and plod­ded down the hill to the­ir own camp­si­te. They had ma­na­ged to ma­ke them­sel­ves un­po­pu­lar, not by unp­le­asant be­ha­vi­or, but simply by be­ing unf­ri­endly and ta­ci­turn. No one dis­li­ked them, but no one wan­ted to as­so­ci­ate with them eit­her. Hu­mans, in Ke­man's ex­pe­ri­en­ce, when away from the­ir fa­mi­li­ar sur­ro­un­dings, ne­eded to so­ci­ali­ze. When any par­ti­cu­lar hu­man of­fe­red a cold sho­ul­der, he was ge­ne­ral­ly shut out ta­citly.</p>
   <p>    So Ke­man and Do­ra had a lit­tle fi­re to them­sel­ves; they un­der­to­ok the­ir du­ti­es in si­len­ce, and now they col­lec­ted the­ir ra­ti­ons from the com­mon camp-kitc­hen wit­ho­ut com­ment be­yond a grunt or a nod. They bro­ught the­ir fo­od back to the­ir camp, and to all ap­pe­aran­ces set­tled down to the­ir be­la­ted din­ners.</p>
   <p>    Ah, but be­ne­ath the sur­fa­ce, tho­ughts we­re flying bet­we­en them. They we­re, in fact, mostly fi­nis­hed with that rat­her me­ager (by dra­co­nic stan­dards) me­al, be­fo­re the exc­han­ges got be­yond inc­re­du­lo­us:Can you be­li­eve what he sa­id?: and si­mi­lar exc­la­ma­ti­ons of as­to­nish­ment.</p>
   <p>    :How so­on to­night do you think Sha­na will try and ma­ke con­tact with us?: Do­ra as­ked at last.:We ha­ve to tell her abo­ut this! If we can so­me­how get this Kyrti­an on our si­de, it will ma­ke all the dif­fe­ren­ce!:</p>
   <p>    Keman's fa­ce sho­wed no exp­res­si­on, but the­re was not­hing but glee in his tho­ughts.:It's what we've ne­eded all along, re­al­ly-what Sha­na has ne­eded-: he amen­ded.</p>
   <p>    :Oh, we dra­gons ha­ve thrown our lot in with the Wi­zards now, no mat­ter what so­me of us think,: Do­ra sa­id che­er­ful­ly.:It's what we ne­ed, an ally and a per­son in­si­de the ranks of the El­ven­lords.:</p>
   <p>    Keman tho­ught a chuck­le.:It wo­uldn 't hurt the Tra­der clans to dis­co­ver they've got so­me com­pe­ti­ti­on, eit­her.: He was be­gin­ning to re­sent the ca­su­al way in which the Tra­ders had as­su­med that the Wi­zards we­re to­tal­ly at the­ir mercy now when it ca­me to things that the Wi­zards co­uldn't pro­du­ce. His per­sis­tent fe­ar was that the Tra­ders wo­uld le­arn that the Iron Folk most va­lu­ed and ne­eded the me­tal that ga­ve them the­ir na­me, and wo­uld find a way to supply it in qu­an­tity, the­reby gi­ving the Iron Pe­op­le no re­ason to con­ti­nue the­ir al­li­an­ce with the Wi­zards. That co­uld be a di­sas­ter; wit­ho­ut the Iron Pe­op­le, the Wi­zards didn't ha­ve a lot of figh­ting-types if it ca­me to re­al com­bat.</p>
   <p>    :But if we can get this new com­man­der on our si­de, we won't ne­ed any figh­ters!: Do­ra re­min­ded him ex­ci­tedly.</p>
   <p>    :I wo­uldn't want to aban­don the al­li­an­ce, tho­ugh,: he rep­li­ed with ca­uti­on, as he to­ok her tin pla­te and his own, and scra­ped co­als in­to both of them to burn off the re­ma­ins of the­ir stew- the most com­mon way any of the­se hu­mans he­re cle­aned the­ir dis­hes when they we­re do­ne with them. Even the co­oks cle­aned the­ir gre­at pots this way so­me­ti­mes. Es­pe­ci­al­ly la­tely, with Kyrti­an mo­ving the army from dawn to just be­fo­re dark, cha­sing the Yo­ung Lords' army.</p>
   <p>    :Well, do you think you've suf­fi­ci­ently cal­med down eno­ugh to help me re­ach Sha­na?: he te­ased, as he sat down ac­ross the fi­re from her.</p>
   <p>    Her reply was not trans­la­tab­le, but was ru­de. He al­most crac­ked his dis­gu­ise with a grin, then they set­tled in­to the­ir task-lo­oking from the out­si­de as if they we­re two mid­dle-aged, we­ary men do­zing by the­ir fi­re.</p>
   <p>    Shana had hardly be­en ab­le to be­li­eve what Ke­man told her; in fact, the mo­ment he'd told her what Lord Kyrti­an was plot­ting with his aunt Mort­he­na, she'd as­ked him to wa­it for a mo­ment. Then, her blo­od sin­ging with ex­ci­te­ment, she ran to get Lorryn so that he co­uld he­ar and ve­rify it be­fo­re it ac­tu­al­ly sank in as truth.</p>
   <p>    She po­un­ded down the ro­ugh sto­ne cor­ri­dors, red ha­ir stre­aming be­hind her, from her cham­bers to the com­mon-ro­om, whe­re he was sit­ting with Zed and one or two ot­hers, prac­ti­cing wor­king in con­cert and using gems­to­nes to fo­cus and amp­lify the­ir po­wers. The­se we­re the skills that the yo­un­ger wi­zards had de­ve­lo­ped that enab­led them to do so much mo­re than the­ir el­ders-abi­li­ti­es which Ca­el­lach Gwa­in and his cro­ni­es re­sen­ted wit­ho­ut ac­tu­al­ly tro­ub­ling them­sel­ves to le­arn.</p>
   <p>    "Keman has so­me news," she sa­id bre­ath­les­sly, as the lit­tle gro­up lo­oked up with so­me surp­ri­se at her hasty ent­ran­ce. "I'd li­ke to he­ar what you think abo­ut it, if you can spa­re the ti­me, Lorryn."</p>
   <p>    "Certainly; we we­re just abo­ut fi­nis­hed any­way." Lorryn sto­od up, and han­ded the bas­ket-full of baby chicks he'd be­en crad­ling in his lap to Zed with a grin. "I ne­ver tho­ught that I'd find myself pur­lo­ining chic­kens with ma­gic when I ran off to jo­in the Wi­zards!"</p>
   <p>    "Hah. Can you think of any bet­ter way to prac­ti­ce the 'sa­fe' trans­por­ta­ti­on spell?" Zed co­un­te­red, with his own wi­de grin split­ting his tan­ned and swarthy fa­ce. "If you flat­ten a chick or two, it's no gre­at loss."</p>
   <p>    "But they're so-well, cu­te-I'd fe­el gu­ilty," Lorryn pro­tes­ted, lo­oking down at the yel­low balls of fluff whi­le they che­eped sle­epily.</p>
   <p>    Zed only grin­ned wi­der. "All the mo­re in­cen­ti­ve, then," he po­in­ted out.</p>
   <p>    "Let's ta­ke a walk," Sha­na sug­ges­ted-a go­od ex­cu­se to get away from the ot­hers. She didn't want to ra­ise ho­pes that might be crus­hed; Lorryn co­uld be trus­ted to con­si­der all pos­sib­le out­co­mes and not just the most de­si­red. To­get­her they co­uld dis­cuss pos­si­bi­li­ti­es-grim as well as ho­pe­ful.</p>
   <p>    Which is just anot­her re­ason why I'm glad he's with me. She'd fal­len in­to the ha­bit of con­si­de­ring him as a part­ner so qu­ickly it was al­most as ma­gi­cal as any spell. How not? She knew she co­uld de­pend on him to do so­met­hing when she as­ked him to, but even mo­re im­por­tantly, she knew she co­uld de­pend on him to do so­met­hing he saw ne­eded do­ing even if she didn't ask.</p>
   <p>    After a qu­ick walk up to one of the con­ce­aled exits on the top of the hill co­ve­ring the­ir ca­ve-comp­lex, the two of them we­re out un­der the stars. It wasn't li­kely that they'd be over­he­ard, but Sha­na re­la­ted what Ke­man had told her mind-to-mind any­way. Just be­ca­use so­met­hing wasn't li­kely that was no re­ason to as­su­me it wo­uldn't hap­pen.</p>
   <p>    And the Old Whi­ners are just as li­ke to set so­me­one to spy on us as not, she tho­ught re­sent­ful­ly. The fat wo­uld be in the fi­re if they even tho­ught that I was go­ing to open ne­go­ti­ati­ons with an El­ven­lord!</p>
   <p>    :Ancestors!: Lorryn exc­la­imed,.-This is fan­tas­tic news! I wo­uld ne­ver, ever ha­ve an­ti­ci­pa­ted this!:</p>
   <p>    While Sha­na went to get Lorryn, Ke­man had be­en wa­iting pa­ti­ently; now she sat down on a rock and con­cent­ra­ted on the fo­cus-sto­ne in her hand, con­tac­ting him on­ce aga­in.</p>
   <p>    :I ha­ve Lorryn,: she told him, ope­ning her tho­ughts slightly so that Lorryn co­uld sen­se what Ke­man was tel­ling her.:Can you go thro­ugh all that aga­in for both of us?:</p>
   <p>    Keman was only too wil­ling to; Sha­na sen­sed both Lorryn's gro­wing ex­ci­te­ment and that of Do­ra be­hind Ke­man's ca­re­ful­ly cont­rol­led tho­ughts. But Lorryn so­be­red im­me­di­ately af­ter the first burst of inc­re­du­lo­us ent­hu­si­asm, and didn't in­ter­rupt any­mo­re whi­le Ke­man conc­lu­ded his re­port to Sha­na. It was dif­fi­cult eno­ugh for them to ma­in­ta­in con­tact at such ext­re­me dis­tan­ce, and Sha­na ap­pre­ci­ated that he kept his own tho­ughts qu­i­et whi­le she and her fos­ter-brot­her fi­nis­hed the­ir bu­si­ness.</p>
   <p>    But Ke­man had an idea of his own for the­ir si­tu­ati­on, that he vo­iced be­fo­re they bro­ke off con­tact.:Sha­na, why don't you ask Mot­her and Ka­la­ma­dea to find iron for you? Oh, I know it in­ter­fe­res too much even with our ma­gic for them to bring it to the sur­fa­ce, but su­rely they can find it, and on­ce it's be­en fo­und, you can work out how to mi­ne it. Su­rely the Iron Pe­op­le know how!:</p>
   <p>    .7 can ask,: she rep­li­ed.</p>
   <p>    :Good! The mo­re claws we ha­ve shar­pe­ned, the bet­ter,: was his fi­nal reply.</p>
   <p>    "That's not a bad tho­ught," Sha­na sa­id alo­ud, as a men­tal si­len­ce fil­led the pla­ce whe­re Ke­man's word-tho­ughts had be­en. She he­aded back down in­to the ca­verns, with Lorryn fol­lo­wing be­si­de her. "But I tho­ught the dra­gons didn't much li­ke be­ing aro­und iron-"</p>
   <p>    "They don't," Lorryn ag­re­ed, "But Fat­her Dra­gon and yo­ur fos­ter-mot­her Ala­ra are li­kely to ag­ree to do just abo­ut anyt­hing wit­hin re­ason that you ask them to, don't you think?"</p>
   <p>    "Hmm. So­me­how I can't be­li­eve that it's go­ing to be that easy," Sha­na told him, skep­ti­cal­ly. "Still, the­re's no harm in as­king."</p>
   <p>    "And no ti­me li­ke the pre­sent," Lorryn ag­re­ed. She was not at all disp­le­ased when he to­ok her hand and squ­e­ezed it en­co­ura­gingly, then didn't bot­her to let it go as they des­cen­ded on­ce aga­in in­to the Ci­ta­del cor­ri­dors.</p>
   <p>    And when they fo­und the two dra­gons who (next to Ke­man) had most clo­sely alig­ned them­sel­ves with the Wi­zards, she put the qu­es­ti­on to them.</p>
   <p>    They had ma­de them­sel­ves re­al la­irs he­re, which was no gre­at dif­fi­culty for a dra­gon, a cre­atu­re who co­uld sha­pe rock and earth to its will. The two of them we­re in Ala­ra's la­ir, rec­li­ning in the­ir na­tu­ral forms in smo­oth hol­lows fil­led with the soft sand that dra­gons pre­fer­red to rest in. Fat­her Dra­gon- Ka­la­ma­dea by ac­tu­al na­me-was not at his full si­ze in he­re, for dra­gons ne­ver re­al­ly stop­ped gro­wing as long as they li­ved, and Fat­her Dra­gon was very, very old and his si­ze was im­men­se. He wo­uld hardly ha­ve fit in one of Ala­ra's hol­lows if he hadn't shif­ted part of his bulk in­to the Out first.</p>
   <p>    Even so, both of them we­re hu­ge, dwar­fing the two half-blo­ods next to them. Ala­ra's scar­let-sca­led tor­so co­uld ha­ve ser­ved as a hut if it we­re hol­low.</p>
   <p>    "I tho­ught what you ne­eded we­re gems­to­nes and pre­ci­o­us me­tals to tra­de with," Ala­ra res­pon­ded to Sha­na's qu­es­ti­on, her bob­bing he­ad in­di­ca­ting her con­fu­si­on. "That's what we've all be­en lo­oking for. That's what you as­ked us to find."</p>
   <p>    Shana gri­ma­ced. "I know; that was my mis­ta­ke. I tho­ught so, too-actu­al­ly, I didn't re­al­ly think, not even when Sha­dow told us how nervy the Iron Pe­op­le we­re get­ting wit­ho­ut any new so­ur­ce of me­tal for the­ir for­ges. Two mis­ta­kes, then. I sup­po­se, if I had tho­ught abo­ut it at all, I just as­su­med that now that the Iron Pe­op­le we­re set­tling, they'd find the­ir own iron. So, can you find it?"</p>
   <p>    "More or less," Ka­la­ma­dea rumb­led, lif­ting his he­ad from his fo­rec­laws. "Re­mem­ber, af­ter all, that we use ma­gic to find things, and sin­ce the Rot­ten Me­tal in­ter­fe­res with ma­gic, its very pre­sen­ce is go­ing to in­ter­fe­re with lo­ca­ting it. We'll ac­tu­al­ly ha­ve to do so­me ro­un­da­bo­ut rec­ko­ning on whe­re the in­ter­fe­ren­ce is stron­gest to find ve­ins of ore."</p>
   <p>    "I knew it co­uldn't be all that easy," Sha­na mut­te­red to her­self, but at le­ast Fat­her Dra­gon se­emed to think that the­re was a way to work aro­und the prob­lem, and that was mo­re than she had ex­pec­ted.</p>
   <p>    "We al­so won't be ab­le to bring it to the sur­fa­ce the way we can the sil­ver and gold," Ala­ra sig­hed reg­ret­ful­ly. "So on­ce we find it, you'll still ha­ve to dig for it, and it'll be ore rat­her than the ni­ce, pu­re nug­gets of ot­her things we can bring up."</p>
   <p>    "Oh, An­ces­tors-" Lorryn sa­id in mock dis­may. "Think of it-one mo­re re­ason for ab­le-bo­di­ed folks to ha­ve to le­ave the Ci­ta­del, which me­ans fe­wer ser­vants to at­tend to the whims of the Old Whi­ners! They might ac­tu­al­ly ha­ve to le­arn to cle­an up af­ter them­sel­ves on­ce in a whi­le!"</p>
   <p>    Shana had no­ti­ced that Lorryn had, if anyt­hing, less pa­ti­en­ce with Ca­el­lach Gwa­in than she did, alt­ho­ugh you wo­uld ne­ver ha­ve known it by the way he ac­ted with the old wi­zard and his cro­ni­es. She smi­led. "I wo­uldn't mind ta­king my turn on the end of a sho­vel," she vo­lun­te­ered. "Espe­ci­al­ly if it me­ant that you wo­uld ta­ke over de­aling with them ins­te­ad of me."</p>
   <p>    He gro­aned and sho­ok his he­ad. "Oh, Sha­na-all right. I sup­po­se that among the three of us, Parth Agon, De­ne­lor and I can hand­le them. I've no­ti­ced a dis­tinct imp­ro­ve­ment in Parth's at­ti­tu­de ever sin­ce he's se­en just what an idi­ot Ca­el­lach is be­ing."</p>
   <p>    "And De­ne­lor al­ways was a de­ar," Sha­na sa­id, spe­aking fondly of her for­mer te­ac­her and the "mas­ter" to her "appren­ti­ce."</p>
   <p>    Kalamadea snor­ted. "I wo­uld not ha­ve used that desc­rip­ti­on," he sa­id. "But he cer­ta­inly is far mo­re wil­ling to adapt, ac­com­mo­da­te, and chan­ge than any of the ot­her ol­der wi­zards. Well, I wo­uld say that we ha­ve so­met­hing of a plan, then. Ala­ra and one or two of the ot­hers sho­uld be the ones to go lo­oking for Rot­ten Me­tal; when they find so­me that is not too far be­ne­ath the sur­fa­ce, you and a few hardy so­uls, Sha­na, can see abo­ut dig­ging so­me up. Me­anw­hi­le Lorryn will ad­vi­se Parth Agon, with the help of De­ne­lor-and me."</p>
   <p>    Shana al­most la­ug­hed alo­ud at that last. If Ca­el­lach was af­ra­id of anyt­hing, it was of the dra­gons, and Ka­la­ma­dea was the most im­po­sing of his kind. Ca­el­lach had tri­ed-and ne­arly suc­ce­eded-in un­do­ing all of the re­forms of the yo­un­ger wi­zards on­ce, when Sha­na had be­en away from the Ci­ta­del. As it hap­pe­ned, she had be­en the cap­ti­ve, at the ti­me, of the Iron Pe­op­le, as had Ka­la­ma­dea and Ke­man. So the­re had be­en no one in pla­ce to ke­ep Ca­el­lach Gwa­in in check.</p>
   <p>    "You or I, Sha­na, will al­ways ha­ve a pre­sen­ce he­re, and Lorryn, too, I think," Fat­her Dra­gon rumb­led, con­fir­ming her tho­ught. "At le­ast, un­til the day when Ca­el­lach Gwa­in swells up with in­dig­na­ti­on and exp­lo­des."</p>
   <p>    They all la­ug­hed so hard at the ima­ges co­nj­ured up by that sta­te­ment that a sle­epy ol­der wi­zard pad­ded grumb­ling in­to the la­ir to lod­ge a pro­test at ha­ving her sle­ep dis­tur­bed, and went away mut­te­ring un­der her bre­ath.</p>

   <p>    Kyrtian sat une­asily on his hor­se in the chill dark­ness just be­fo­re dawn. He had bro­ught in his tro­ops just af­ter mid­night, po­si­ti­oning them as if this was go­ing to be a re­al fight and not the sham thing that he and Moth had ar­ran­ged. Af­ter all, the only pe­op­le that knew it was a sham we­re his own people on both si­des of the co­ming bat­tle, all of Moth's pe­op­le, and he and Gel. It was a gi­ven that so­me of his com­man­ders (if not all of them) we­re re­por­ting to one or mo­re of the Gre­at Lords. Kyrti­an wan­ted them to re­port the most imp­res­si­ve vic­tory yet-and the most de­ci­si­ve.</p>
   <p>    This wo­uld be enj­oyab­le only if he was down the­re with his tro­ops; he wo­uld ha­ve gi­ven a gre­at de­al to be ab­le to le­ap out of his sad­dle and he­ad up the men he knew so well. Well, the only re­ason it wo­uld be enj­oyab­le is be­ca­use I know how much of this at­tack is sham.</p>
   <p>    Ancestors, but it was cold! Ar­mor and pad­ded gam­be­son we­ren't do­ing a lot aga­inst the dank­ness, which pe­net­ra­ted everyt­hing. In fact, the ar­mor was only ma­king things wor­se; it suc­ked he­at away from him ins­te­ad of hol­ding it in.</p>
   <p>    And-was the­re ac­tu­al­ly dew con­den­sing on it?</p>
   <p>    A cold drop­let spark­led for a mo­ment just be­fo­re his eyes, then drop­ped off the tip of his helm to splash on­to his no­se.</p>
   <p>    There was. He shi­ve­red and tri­ed to stop him­self; it only ma­de his ri­di­cu­lo­us, use­less, over-orna­men­ted ar­mor rat­tle.</p>
   <p>    Not pos­sib­le for him to jo­in his men whe­re they wa­ited for the sig­nal to at­tack, of co­ur­se. The Gre­at Lords who we­re his ul­ti­ma­te mas­ters he­re wo­uld, one and all, ha­ve had him ha­uled up in front of them for reck­les­sness and bla­tant dis­re­gard for his po­si­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    So he had to sit on a hor­se on a hill-ma­king an ex­cel­lent tar­get, in­ci­den­tal­ly, had his ma­gic not be­en so strong-and di­rect his figh­ters from afar. Ne­ver on­ce dirt­ying his hands with ac­tu­al com­bat, oh, no. That was be­ne­ath his dig­nity as a com­man­der, and da­ma­ging to the aut­ho­rity of El­ves in ge­ne­ral and the Gre­at Co­un­cil in the per­son of its de­sig­na­ted com­man­der in par­ti­cu­lar.</p>
   <p>    At le­ast this ti­me he wo­uld ha­ve so­met­hing to do be­si­des sit and watch and is­sue an oc­ca­si­onal or­der. Moth's yo­ung re­bels we­re go­ing to be very vi­sibly in the fi­eld to­day; they we­re al­so go­ing to be we­aring so­me of that bi­zar­re jewelry she'd told him abo­ut. They co­uldn't work any ma­gic whi­le we­aring it, but that didn't mat­ter, sin­ce most of them didn't ha­ve that much in the first pla­ce. It wo­uld pro­tect them from his le­vin-bolts; they wanted to de­monst­ra­te in the most pub­lic fo­rum pos­sib­le that the­ir fat­hers co­uld no lon­ger thre­aten to stri­ke them down in that par­ti­cu­lar fas­hi­on.</p>
   <p>    I can­not ima­gi­ne that. I just can't. I know in­tel­lec­tu­al­ly that the­re are men out the­re who think of the­ir sons as pos­ses­si­ons, and are per­fectly wil­ling to dest­roy them and try be­get­ting a son aga­in if the­ir "pos­ses­si­ons" of­fend them, but I still can­not fat­hom it in my he­art.</p>
   <p>    Since the­ir fat­hers didn't know it was only sets of gold-pla­ted cuffs and tor­qu­es that pro­tec­ted the re­bel­li­o­us Yo­ung Lords, and not so­me new sort of ma­gic, this de­monst­ra­ti­on was go­ing to set the Co­un­cil rat­her well aback.</p>
   <p>    The re­bels aren 't just Yo­ung Lords eit­her, tho­ugh most of them he­re are. Moth had gi­ven him a bri­ef sum­mary of the re­bel­li­on-and to say that he'd be­en shoc­ked was an un­ders­ta­te­ment. The­re's a con­si­de­rab­le num­ber of the ones who are Lords only be­ca­use they aren't hu­man, the scorn­ful­ly dis­re­gar­ded El­ven­lords no one talks abo­ut-the ones with lit­tle ma­gic. Moth had int­ro­du­ced him to two of tho­se bit­ter re­bels, men Lord Kyndreth's age if not ol­der. I won­der if the Gre­at Lords ha­ve any idea how cor­di­al­ly they are ha­ted by so many of the­ir "infe­ri­ors "?</p>
   <p>    Mind, this in­vul­ne­ra­bi­lity to le­vin-bolts wasn't go­ing to do the re­bels any prac­ti­cal go­od, in the plan­ned sce­na­rio. Kyrti­an's army was too lar­ge and well-orga­ni­zed, and when the re­bels fled, the­ir army wo­uld fall apart. Kyrti­an's men had or­ders to ta­ke an­yo­ne who sur­ren­de­red as a pri­so­ner; the re­bels had no il­lu­si­ons abo­ut the lo­yalty of the­ir sla­ve-figh­ters. When they fled, the­ir army wo­uld drop we­apons and ca­pi­tu­la­te. Kyrti­an's vic­tory was a cer­ta­inty-as fi­nely scrip­ted as a Co­urt dan­ce and as pre­dic­tab­le.</p>
   <p>    It was de­fi­ni­tely get­ting ligh­ter. When he'd first bro­ught his re­luc­tant mo­unt up he­re be­ne­ath the­se tre­es, it had be­en too dark to see. Now the ho­ri­zon had ligh­te­ned, and he co­uld ma­ke out the dark sha­pes of tre­es and un­derg­rowth be­ne­ath him, and in the dis­tan­ce, the squ­are and rec­tan­gu­lar bulks of the bu­il­dings whe­re the­ir qu­ar­ry wa­ited-sup­po­sedly as­le­ep and una­wa­re of the army abo­ut to des­cend on them.</p>
   <p>    Good thing we aren't go­ing to ha­ve to be­si­ege this pla­ce; we'd be he­re for months. Be­fo­re bat­tles, or even the prac­ti­ces he and Gel had held on the es­ta­te, he usu­al­ly got a tigh­te­ning in his sto­mach, a dry mo­uth, and his skin felt hyper­sen­si­ti­ve. Not to­day; in fact, if anyt­hing, he was bo­red and he wan­ted it over with. The conc­lu­si­on he­re was fo­re­go­ne; the only qu­es­ti­on was whet­her or not any of Moth's pe­op­le wo­uld be inj­ured be­fo­re they co­uld sur­ren­der.</p>
   <p>    The Yo­ung Lords had ac­tu­al­ly cho­sen the­ir sup­po­sed strong­hold well-altho­ugh the­re wasn't a man on the Gre­at Co­un­cil who wo­uld ha­ve va­lu­ed it pro­perly. For the last co­up­le of cen­tu­ri­es it had be­en the very mi­nor hol­ding of a very mi­nor El-ven­lord who had not be­en swal­lo­wed up by so­me gre­ater Lord only be­ca­use he ne­ver qu­ar­re­led with an­yo­ne, ne­ver ga­ve of­fen­se to an­yo­ne, and ra­ised not­hing mo­re de­si­rab­le than herbs and spi­ces. This was fi­nicky work, far mo­re than any Gre­at Lord had any in­te­rest in un­der­ta­king, so V'trayn Ild­ren Lord Je-re­min and his wi­fe, da­ugh­ter and sla­ves had be­en left in pe­ace. Un­til the re­bel­li­on, that is. At the mo­ment, Lord Ild­ren and his ho­use­hold we­re sa­fely wa­iting out the conf­lict in the­ir ca­ra-van­se­rie in one of the ci­ti­es.</p>
   <p>    So much for him; what was of in­te­rest was his ma­nor, which in the far past had be­en one of the ori­gi­nal for­ti­fi­ed ma­nors of this re­gi­on, bu­ilt back when hu­mans had ar­mi­es and we­re con­si­de­red at le­ast a thre­at to El­ven­kind. It had be­en furt­her for­ti­fi­ed at the be­gin­ning of the first Wi­zard War, ma­king it qu­ite a snug lit­tle ret­re­at. It was Kyrti­an's opi­ni­on that its for­mer ow­ner wo­uld ha­ve do­ne bet­ter to re­ma­in but­to­ned up in­si­de it rat­her than fle­e­ing to the city and the cram­ped dis­com­fort of his tiny ca­ra­van­se­rie.</p>
   <p>    But he hadn't, and the re­bels had ap­prop­ri­ated it as a pla­ce to ho­use and tra­in the­ir hu­man figh­ters.</p>
   <p>    It had be­en, the­re­fo­re, of mi­nor stra­te­gic im­por­tan­ce un­til this mo­ment. But he and Moth had de­ci­ded that for to­day's pur­po­se it wo­uld play the ro­le of the re­bel's he­ad­qu­ar­ters, so that when the Yo­ung Lords all went to gro­und on Moth's es­ta­te af­ter a spec­ta­cu­lar ro­ut, no one wo­uld be lo­oking for them the­re.</p>
   <p>    It was a gi­ven that no one on the Co­un­cil wo­uld won­der why pe­op­le who had be­en cle­ver eno­ugh to cho­ose a de­fen­sib­le struc­tu­re li­ke this one as the­ir he­ad­qu­ar­ters wo­uld al­so le­ave it for a pitc­hed bat­tle out­si­de the walls of the struc­tu­re. Analy­zing the enemy's stra­tegy was not a skill that the Gre­at Lords of the Co­un­cil exer­ci­sed. So long as things went the­ir way, they we­re not inc­li­ned to ask why or lo­ok the si­tu­ati­on over very clo­sely.</p>
   <p>    Which is why they are in this par­ti­cu­lar qu­an­dary in the first pla­ce.</p>
   <p>    Birds twit­te­red softly and sle­epily over­he­ad. They had be­gun to wa­ke; it wo­uldn't be much lon­ger be­fo­re the at­tack.</p>
   <p>    Light se­eped in­to the lands­ca­pe, re­ve­aling it in sha­des of blue-grey. Ro­un­ded sha­pes we­re bus­hes, tre­es. Po­in­ted ones, rocky outc­rops. And in the far dis­tan­ce, le­agu­es be­low his hill, the squ­ares and rec­tang­les we­re the for­ti­fi­ed ma­nor.</p>
   <p>    The light strengt­he­ned, alt­ho­ugh the only sign of the sun­ri­se to co­me was the ste­ady brigh­te­ning in the east. A sing­le fi­gu­re sto­od sentry on the walls be­low; tho­se of the Gre­at Lords ob­ser­ving this in the­ir te­le­sons must be la­ug­hing now. One sentry! And the ga­tes wi­de open!</p>
   <p>    The ga­tes we­re wi­de open so that the army wit­hin co­uld bo­il out easily-which, in a mo­ment, when the sentry "spot­ted" the first of his tro­ops at­temp­ting to ap­pro­ach by ste­alth and so­un­ded the "alert", they wo­uld.</p>
   <p>    The dis­tant fi­gu­re sud­denly mo­ved, and the thin wa­il of a trum­pet car­ri­ed up to Kyrti­an's ears, and the pe­ace of the mor­ning shat­te­red li­ke brit­tle glass as figh­ters erup­ted from every ga­te, sho­uting, the­ir vo­ices ri­sing to Kyrti­an in a con­fu­sed bab­ble.</p>
   <p>    Time to gi­ve the sig­nal.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian sto­od up in his stir­rups, po­in­ted his right hand skyward, and la­unc­hed a bolt of ma­gic up to the de­ep blue-grey bowl of the pre-dawn sky: not a le­vin-bolt, but one of the harm­less il­lu­si­on-bolts of­ten used to en­li­ven eve­ning en­ter­ta­in­ments, a so­und­less sho­wer of co­lo­red sparks of light high in the air. And now it was the turn of his army to emer­ge from the pla­ces whe­re the men had la­in hid­den half the night, not sho­uting, but eerily si­lent, li­ke an army of spi­rits…</p>
   <p>    But they didn't stay si­lent for long; that was too much to ex­pect of flesh and blo­od. Half­way down the hill the­ir ner­ves or the­ir ex­ci­te­ment got the bet­ter of them, and the­ir own thro­ats ope­ned with a col­lec­ti­ve ro­ar. Be­ne­ath his hor­se's ho­oves, the gro­und sho­ok, and the ter­ri­fi­ed birds burst out of the tree abo­ve him.</p>
   <p>    At that mo­ment, be­fo­re the two ar­mi­es had even met, Kyrti­an spot­ted the Yo­ung Lords co­ming out of the ga­tes of the­ir fort­ress. He knew them by the­ir co­lor­ful ar­mor, ri­ding out thro­ugh the flo­od of the­ir own figh­ters, the­ir hor­ses car­ri­ed along li­ke flot­sam in a stre­am.</p>
   <p>    Ha!</p>
   <p>    He had be­en told not to hold back, and he didn't. As so­on as the fo­re­most of the ri­ders got free of the hu­man sea abo­ut him, Kyrti­an aimed-gat­he­red his po­wer from the depths of his so­ul-clas­ped both hands abo­ve his he­ad, and let lo­ose a le­vin-bolt at the ne­arest.</p>
   <p>    The le­vin-bolt stre­aked from his clas­ped hands ac­ross the spa­ce bet­we­en them, a fi­re-stre­aming co­met, and tho­se who saw it and had the ti­me to re­act flung them­sel­ves scre­aming out of its path. An­yo­ne with any ex­pe­ri­en­ce of le­vin-bolts wo­uld see that this one was de­adly-and strong.</p>
   <p>    It hit-it hit! Kyrti­an's thro­at clo­sed for a mo­ment-what if Moth was wrong? But in the sa­me mo­ment, he knew, he knew that Moth had not be­en wrong, for his fa­tal le­vin-bolt in the mo­ment of stri­king frag­men­ted in­to a tho­usand shards of light, blin­ding his vi­ew of his tar­get for just a mo­ment. In the next mo­ment, the­re was his tar­get, un­har­med-tho­ugh the po­or hor­se was fro­zen in pla­ce, all fo­ur ho­oves plan­ted.</p>
   <p>    Yes! It works! Now su­re that he wo­uld not kill so­me­one, Kyrti­an didn't he­si­ta­te, and at last he had a lit­tle of the thrill of bat­tle, the exul­ta­ti­on of suc­cess; bolt af­ter bolt flew down the hill and in­to the chests of the Yo­ung Lords; bolt af­ter bolt shat­te­red on the­ir de­fen­ses just as the first had.</p>
   <p>    By now the figh­ters of both si­des had cle­ared out of the way of the bolts, which me­ant that asi­de from a few scat­te­red pa­irs loc­ked in com­bat, the ma­in body of tro­ops we­ren't ac­tu­al­ly figh­ting an­yo­ne. That, too, was part of the plan.</p>
   <p>    But ins­te­ad of ta­king he­art from the fa­ilu­re of his le­vin-bolts to kill-as any sa­ne com­man­der wo­uld ha­ve-the Yo­ung Lords ap­pa­rently "pa­nic­ked" when conf­ron­ted by a ma­ge of su­pe­ri­or po­wer.</p>
   <p>    They tur­ned ta­il and fled; not in a body, but bre­aking from the­ir army, sen­ding figh­ters tumb­ling out of the way of the ho­oves of the­ir bol­ting ste­eds, and scat­te­ring in every pos­sib­le di­rec­ti­on ex­cept to­wards the enemy, whip­ping the­ir hor­ses in a frenzy of fe­ig­ned fe­ar. And at the sight of the­ir le­aders in a ro­ut (which was, of co­ur­se, the sig­nal to cer­ta­in of the hu­man figh­ters to mo­ve in­to the next pha­se of the plan), the re­bel army it­self sud­denly bro­ke off com­bat be­fo­re it had even be­gun. Le­ader­less, it was every man for him­self, and the hu­mans we­re un­der no ob­li­ga­ti­on to carry out the or­ders of mas­ters who had aban­do­ned them. Most sur­ren­de­red or fled wit­hin mo­ments. The li­on's sha­re of the ones who fled we­re Kyrti­an's-bro­ught to aug­ment the Yo­ung Lords' tro­ops and ma­ke the army lo­ok for­mi­dab­le eno­ugh to ha­ve be­en a re­al thre­at. Kyrti­an's men, thro­wing down the­ir we­apons the bet­ter to flee unen­cum­be­red, we­re he­ading for a Ga­te that wo­uld ta­ke them ho­me.</p>
   <p>    The rest drop­ped the­ir we­apons as well, but threw them­sel­ves on the­ir fa­ces to sur­ren­der-Kyrti­an had co­un­ted on that, and he had the sa­tis­fac­ti­on of se­e­ing that the sur­ren­de­ring figh­ters ma­na­ged to im­pe­de tho­se who might ha­ve fol­lo­wed the ones who fled.</p>
   <p>    Now the­re was so­me ple­asu­re, the thrill of se­e­ing a plan un­fold per­fectly, tho­ugh the­re was and wo­uld not be any of the ex­ci­te­ment and tri­umph of a re­al vic­tory.</p>
   <p>    The Gre­at Lords' figh­ters pur­su­ed-but the van­gu­ard was com­po­sed of mo­re of his own men, and they ma­na­ged to obst­ruct the pas­sa­ge of the men be­hind them by get­ting tang­led up with tho­se who we­re sur­ren­de­ring. This ma­na­ged to im­pe­de the rest of the figh­ters, slo­wing them and per­mit­ting the van­qu­is­hed to get a he­ad start. By the ti­me re­al pur­su­it got un­der­way, the enemy was al­re­ady too far ahe­ad to pur­sue ef­fec­ti­vely afo­ot. So, gi­ven that Kyrti­an ga­ve no or­ders to ur­ge them on from his hil­ltop com­mand-post, they be­gan the easi­er task of ta­king char­ge of tho­se who sur­ren­de­red. Moth and Lady Vi­ridina had ta­ken the pre­ca­uti­on of tam­pe­ring with every sla­ve-col­lar to ma­ke it se­em that the Yo­ung Lords had fo­und a way to over­ri­de the right­ful ow­ners' com­pul­si­ons. Gla­di­ato­ri­al sla­ves-the only ones that we­re re­aso­nab­le can­di­da­tes for com­bat-we­ren't so plen­ti­ful the­se days that an­yo­ne wo­uld even con­si­der kil­ling or pu­nis­hing the­se men for so­met­hing they co­uld not help; if the­ir ori­gi­nal ow­ners co­uldn't be de­ter­mi­ned, they'd pro­bably be al­lot­ted among the Gre­at Lords as bo­oty.</p>
   <p>    Further en­ric­he­ning the cof­fers of tho­se who don't ne­ed it. Kyrti­an felt al­most dep­res­sed, as he watc­hed the cha­os of the bat­tle­fi­eld sort it­self in­to tidy gro­ups of pri­so­ners and cap­tors. The­re didn't se­em to be many de­ad or se­ri­o­usly wo­un­ded; the­re we­re a few dis­tant fi­gu­res still on the gro­und, but they we­re mo­ving in a way that sug­ges­ted inj­ury but not se­ri­o­us tra­uma.</p>
   <p>    I sho­uld be glad of that. And he was-but he al­so felt as if he'd be­en che­ated, so­me­how; all of the pre­pa­ra­ti­on for a bat­tle-mo­re, far mo­re, in the way of plan­ning and or­ga­ni­za­ti­on- but no­ne of the ex­ci­te­ment. The most he felt was gra­ti­tu­de that it was do­ne with and the­re we­re so few ca­su­al­ti­es.</p>
   <p>    The sun was only just cres­ting the eas­tern ho­ri­zon, the me­rest fin­ger­na­il-pa­ring of hot ro­se, and the bat­tle was over; so far as the Gre­at Lords we­re con­cer­ned, the war with the­ir re­bel of­fsp­ring was over, too. Now wo­uld co­me the hard part; hun­ting them down in­di­vi­du­al­ly, or wa­iting for them to co­me craw­ling back, lo­oking for for­gi­ve­ness. That was what they wo­uld be thin­king, any­way, and Kyrti­an was not abo­ut to al­low them to dis­co­ver any part of the truth.</p>
   <p>    He sig­na­led to his hor­se, and let it plod back down the hill to his tent. Ti­me to pre­pa­re him­self for Lord Kyndreth's cong­ra­tu­la­ti­ons, and pre­tend to an ela­ti­on he didn't fe­el.</p>
   <p>    The sub­com­man­ders mil­led abo­ut in the backg­ro­und, not da­ring to ap­pro­ach such exal­ted per­so­na­ges as Lords of the Co­un­cil wit­ho­ut be­ing sum­mo­ned, but cle­arly ho­ping to be no­ti­ced.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian, on the ot­her hand, was very much the cen­ter of at­ten­ti­on, and not fe­eling par­ti­cu­larly com­for­tab­le in that po­si­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "Brilliant!" Kyndreth bo­omed, as Kyrti­an duc­ked his he­ad modestly. "Bril­li­ant! Cle­arly they ne­ver gu­es­sed you wo­uld for­ce a march af­ter dark to get in­to pla­ce be­fo­re sun­ri­se."</p>
   <p>    "I had ma­de a po­int of al­ways bi­vo­u­ac­king be­fo­re sun­set un­til I knew whe­re they had ma­de the­ir he­ad­qu­ar­ters, my lord," Kyrti­an sa­id, as Lord Kyndreth ac­cep­ted a glass of wi­ne from one of the sla­ves. "I wan­ted them to see a pat­tern and be­co­me used to it."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian's tent had be­en cle­ared of everyt­hing ex­cept tab­les and cha­irs bor­ro­wed from tho­se of his un­der­lings who in­sis­ted on tra­ve­ling with su­ites of fur­ni­tu­re; with car­pets on the flo­or and sla­ves hol­ding trays of ref­resh­ments, it co­uld not ha­ve lo­oked less li­ke his cam­pa­ign he­ad­qu­ar­ters. But Lord Kyndreth had in­sis­ted on Ga­ting he­re ("with a se­lect few of the Co­un­cil, not­hing to tro­ub­le yo­ur­self abo­ut") to ten­der his cong­ra­tu­la­ti­ons in per­son. "Not­hing to tro­ub­le yo­ur­self abo­ut" had en­ta­iled non-stop, fran­tic work on the part of his staff up un­til the very mo­ment that the tem­po­rary Ga­te ope­ned and Kyndreth and en­to­ura­ge marc­hed thro­ugh.</p>
   <p>    "Ha-of co­ur­se, you'd ne­ver do­ne such a thing be­fo­re, so they lac­ked the ima­gi­na­ti­on to sup­po­se that you wo­uld do it now," Kyndreth la­ug­hed, as the ot­her three Gre­at Lords he had bro­ught with him nod­ded wi­sely. "Of co­ur­se, old Le­ve­lis ne­ver did such a thing eit­her."</p>
   <p>    "Levelis," sa­id one long-fa­ced Lord so­urly, "ne­ver exer­ted him­self to tra­vel mo­re than a le­ague or two at a ti­me."</p>
   <p>    "Levelis is an old fo­ol," Lady Moth snap­ped, jo­ining the dis­cus­si­on, wi­neg­lass in hand, "and if it had be­en left up to him, I'd still be pen­ned up on my es­ta­te next Mid­win­ter."</p>
   <p>    Moth ro­de over, es­cor­ted by her body­gu­ards, so­on eno­ugh to wel­co­me the Co­un­ci­lors along with Kyrti­an and to ser­ve as his hos­tess. This was not the first ti­me in the con­ver­sa­ti­on that she had ma­de a po­int of men­ti­oning that Kyrti­an had res­cu­ed her from the re­bels, and it pro­bably wo­uld not be the last.</p>
   <p>    "Entirely pos­sib­le, my lady," the so­ur-fa­ce Co­un­ci­lor sa­id, with a slight bow. "And now what do you plan, yo­ung com­man­der?" he con­ti­nu­ed, tur­ning to Kyrti­an.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian sig­hed. "Now, my lord, co­mes the most te­di­o­us, most ti­me-con­su­ming, and le­ast-re­war­ding part of this campaign," he rep­li­ed. "We hunt down the fu­gi­ti­ves one at a ti­me and bring them back to the Co­un­cil for judg­ment. I'd cal­cu­la­ted that so­met­hing li­ke this wo­uld oc­cur, and plan­ned for it from the be­gin­ning; this is a task for smal­ler par­ti­es of men, and if you will per­mit me, my lords, I wo­uld pre­fer to use my own men if pos­sib­le. I can co­unt on them not to da­ma­ge the fu­gi­ti­ves when they are ca­ught. As for the rest of the for­ce-well, if it we­re my de­ci­si­on to ma­ke, I wo­uld dis­band it. An army is es­sen­ti­al­ly a gre­at be­ast that is all mo­uth and sto­mach out of which no use­ful work can be got­ten when it is not en­ga­ged in a cam­pa­ign."</p>
   <p>    "We will-ta­ke that un­der con­si­de­ra­ti­on," Lord Kyndreth rep­li­ed, with a glan­ce at his fel­low Co­un­cil mem­bers. "It do­es ma­ke sen­se, ho­we­ver."</p>
   <p>    He's thin­king abo­ut the Wi­zards. Kyrti­an to­ok a sip of wi­ne and tri­ed to lo­ok un­con­cer­ned.</p>
   <p>    "Oh, co­me now, Kyndreth, the boy's right," sa­id the so­ur one, ap­prop­ri­ating a tid­bit from one of the trays and exa­mi­ning it as if he ex­pec­ted to find a bug on it be­fo­re put­ting it ca­uti­o­usly in his mo­uth. "The­re's no po­int in ke­eping the­se men sit­ting abo­ut do­ing not­hing mo­re use­ful than mi­li­tary ma­ne­uvers when we co­uld ha­ve them all back on our es­ta­tes do­ing so­me me­aning­ful work, even if it's only in the bre­eding pens."</p>
   <p>    He's not. And he might not be in fa­vor of anot­her Wi­zard War if the su­bj­ect we­re bro­ac­hed at the mo­ment.</p>
   <p>    "And Le­ve­lis," po­in­ted out a Co­un­cil mem­ber in mid­night blue and de­ep gre­en, who was ma­king ste­ady in­ro­ads on the wi­ne wit­ho­ut sho­wing the le­ast sign of in­to­xi­ca­ti­on, "wo­uld im­me­di­ately ad­vi­se to ke­ep the­se men out he­re un­der his com­mand."</p>
   <p>    "And you know how I fe­el abo­ut" Le­ve­lis," Kyndreth ack­now­led­ged with a fa­int smi­le. "Anot­her sa­li­ent po­int, but one that is bet­ter dis­cus­sed in Co­un­cil, don't you think?"</p>
   <p>    "Hmmm," sa­id the fel­low in blue, but didn't add anyt­hing mo­re.</p>
   <p>    How is he drin­king so much and sta­ying so­ber?</p>
   <p>    Kyndreth im­me­di­ately chan­ged the su­bj­ect back to the cur­rent vic­tory, but Kyrti­an co­uldn't help but no­ti­ce that the­re was an as­pect of it that he did not to­uch on-the re­bels' abi­lity to co­un­te­ract his own le­vin-bolts. It was the fo­urth mem­ber of Kyndreth's party who bro­ught it up.</p>
   <p>    "I had no no­ti­on that you had so much ma­gic of yo­ur own- and how we­re tho­se brats ma­na­ging to dod­ge yo­ur le­vin-bolts, Kyrti­an?" he as­ked, inc­re­du­lo­usly. "I tho­ught they hadn't but drib­lets of ma­gic of the­ir own!"</p>
   <p>    He shrug­ged. "I ne­ver saw anyt­hing li­ke it," he ad­mit­ted. "Even if they had be­en using shi­elds as I know them, the le­vin-bolts wo­uldn't ha­ve ac­ted in that way when con­tac­ting a shi­eld. I'm baf­fled."</p>
   <p>    "Huh. I won­der if they fo­und anyt­hing in my lib­rary…" Moth mu­sed, as if thin­king alo­ud-but her sly glan­ce at Kyrti­an aler­ted him that she was abo­ut to pre­sent him with an op­por­tu­nity for so­met­hing.</p>
   <p>    But what?</p>
   <p>    "Your lib­rary, my lady?" Kyrti­an as­ked, obe­ying her promp­ting. "What do you me­an?"</p>
   <p>    "Oh, when I got in­to the Gre­at Ho­use on the es­ta­te, the lib­rary was in a right mess," she rep­li­ed promptly, "bo­oks down off the shel­ves, pi­led up on the tab­les, left lying open-so­met­hing on the or­der of the hug­gle-mug­gle yo­ur fat­her used to cre­ate in the­re when he was do­ing his re­se­arch, Kyrti­an, but on a lar­ger sca­le. My ho­use­hold is cle­aning up the cha­os now, but to tell you the truth, it's as if they we­re fol­lo­wing his le­ad and lo­oking for so­met­hing."</p>
   <p>    "Perhaps they fo­und it-" Kyndreth sa­id slowly, spe­cu­la­ti­on cre­eping in­to his ga­ze as he lo­oked from Moth to Kyrti­an and back aga­in. "Per­haps-ha­ving dis­co­ve­red that the son's lit­tle ec­cent­ric hobby was so de­adly to the­ir ca­use, they tho­ught to co­un­ter it by fol­lo­wing the fat­her's examp­le."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian did his best not to sta­re at Moth with his mo­uth open in shock, gat­he­red his wits, and se­ized the op­por­tu­nity he'd be­en gi­ven with both hands. "If that is true-and I do re­call my fat­her be­ing very ent­hu­si­as­tic over so­met­hing he fo­und in Lady Mort­he­na's bo­oks-then the re­bels might ha­ve do­ne just that, and we ne­ed to dis­co­ver what it is that they fo­und!"</p>
   <p>    "Agreed!" sa­id the Co­un­ci­lor in blue, ins­tantly. "So­me­one sho­uld be­gin im­me­di­ately!"</p>
   <p>    I wish mot­her co­uld he­ar that. My fat­her has just go­ne in an ins­tant from cra­zed ec­cent­ric to vin­di­ca­ted.</p>
   <p>    He tur­ned to Lord Kyndreth. "My lord, if I may be so bold- an­yo­ne can track down fu­gi­ti­ves; it's only a mat­ter of ha­ving go­od hun­ters and end­less pa­ti­en­ce-but I know the di­rec­ti­on of my fat­her's re­se­arch as no one el­se co­uld. Wo­uld the Co­un­cil be ple­ased to per­mit me to co­ur­se this par­ti­cu­lar ha­re?"</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth's spe­cu­la­ti­ve exp­res­si­on ga­ve Kyrti­an the thrill of ex­ci­te­ment that the sham bat­tle had not. "What, pre­ci­sely, was he lo­oking for?"</p>
   <p>    "A way, or per­haps a de­vi­ce," Kyrti­an sa­id, very slowly, "for tho­se with lit­tle ma­gic to amp­lify that ma­gic." Even as he sa­id that, he re­ali­zed that this wo­uld not be ple­asant he­aring for tho­se who­se po­wer­ful ma­gic kept them at the top of the hi­erarchy. "Pre­su­mably it wo­uld do the sa­me for tho­se with gre­at ma­gic as well," he ad­ded qu­ickly. "I wo­uld as­su­me it wo­uld work for an­yo­ne who used it, whet­her 'it' is a de­vi­ce, an obj­ect, or a met­hod."</p>
   <p>    "What sent yo­ur fat­her in­to Lady Mort­he­na's lib­rary, Lord Kyrti­an?" as­ked the wi­ne-lo­ving Lord, with every evi­den­ce of in­te­rest.</p>
   <p>    "He was a stu­dent of our his­tory, and co­uld not fat­hom why we we­re unab­le to rep­li­ca­te so­me of the fe­ats of the An­ces­tors, when ac­cor­ding to the frag­ments of chro­nic­les he fo­und, even the le­ast of the An­ces­tors co­uld ac­comp­lish what the Gre­at Lords co­uld," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed ca­re­ful­ly, lo­oking ear­nestly in­to the ol­der Lord's in­tent eyes. "And he co­uld see no re­ason why ma­gic sho­uld be thin­ning in our blo­od­li­nes."</p>
   <p>    "A go­od po­int." Kyndreth mul­led that one over, as the ot­her Co­un­ci­lors lo­oked in­te­res­ted, even eager. Even the so­ur-fa­ced one lost so­me of his do­ur lo­ok.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian tho­ught abo­ut sa­ying mo­re, tho­ught aga­in, and held his pe­ace. It was Moth who drop­ped anot­her tid­bit in­to the po­ol for the shi­ning carp to gob­ble.</p>
   <p>    "It was all of the ol­dest bo­oks that we­re left lying abo­ut," she observed in­no­cently. "The sa­me sorts of chro­nic­les exactly that Kyrti­an's fat­her used to lo­ok at. And my word-the dust was un­be­li­evab­le!"</p>
   <p>    "Kyndreth, I think we ought to let the boy in­ves­ti­ga­te this," the so­ur-fa­ced Co­un­ci­lor sa­id de­ci­si­vely. "Let him ke­ep his own figh­ting sla­ves in ca­se he finds not­hing and elects to hunt down our fu­gi­ti­ves, whi­le you ta­ke the rest of the army back to the mus­te­ring-bar­racks. We can de­ci­de what to do with it af­ter Kyrti­an de­ter­mi­nes if the­re's anyt­hing to this hun­ting abo­ut in the old chro­nic­les or not. Me­anw­hi­le, we've got men and arms re­ady to send out on the chan­ce that one of our pup­pi­es ma­na­ges to scra­pe to­get­her anot­her for­ce and mo­unts an at­tack on one of the outl­ying ma­nors."</p>
   <p>    "Good plan!" se­con­ded the one in blue, and dra­ined his wi­neg­lass. "Per­so­nal­ly, I think they're go­ing to crawl back to us beg­ging for mercy, but I'd rat­her be re­ady for the tre­ac­he­ro­us yo­ung dogs just in ca­se."</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth lo­oked in be­mu­se­ment from one to anot­her of his fel­low Co­un­ci­lors-evi­dently he was the one who nor­mal­ly con­coc­ted all the plans in Co­un­cil of la­te, and he was so­mew­hat ta­ken aback that the­se three had sud­denly de­vi­sed a so­lu­ti­on of the­ir own.</p>
   <p>    "We don't ne­ed a ma­j­ority vo­te for this, Kyndreth," the wi­ne-lo­ver po­in­ted out. "Kyrti­an won't ac­tu­al­ly be do­ing anyt­hing, not un­less he de­ci­des that the­re's not­hing to be fo­und in that lib­rary, and by then the who­le Co­un­cil will ha­ve had a chan­ce to sit."</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth la­ug­hed. "I see that you ha­ve al­re­ady ma­de up yo­ur minds," he sa­id, ge­ni­al­ly-tho­ugh Kyrti­an won­de­red if the­re was a hint of an­no­yan­ce, and even an­ger, un­der his smo­oth words. "As it hap­pens, I am en­ti­rely in ag­re­ement with you, if for no ot­her re­ason than that it gi­ves our fi­ne yo­ung com­man­der an op­por­tu­nity for so­me well-ear­ned le­isu­re be­fo­re we lay any furt­her bur­dens on his sho­ul­ders." He coc­ked an eyeb­row at Kyrti­an. "I am cor­rect in re­cal­ling that you con­si­der del­ving in­to mo­un­ta­ins of musty old bo­oks to be an enj­oyab­le le­isu­re ac­ti­vity?"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian la­ug­hed. "You are cor­rect, my lord," he ag­re­ed, smi­ling a ge­nu­ine smi­le for the first ti­me that af­ter­no­on. "Li­ke fat­her, li­ke son, you see."</p>
   <p>    "Well then." The smi­le Lord Kyndreth re­tur­ned ne­ver re­ac­hed his eyes, but the­re was no sign of di­sap­pro­val that Kyrti­an co­uld de­tect in it.</p>
   <p>    I sus­pect his an­no­yan­ce is re­ser­ved at this mo­ment for his fel­low Co­un­ci­lors.</p>
   <p>    Kyndreth spun, and fi­xed one of Kyrti­an's su­bor­di­na­tes with a ste­ely ga­ze. "You've he­ard the plan, As­to­lan. You're in char­ge of everyt­hing but Kyrti­an's sla­ves. Gi­ve the lot a go­od fe­ed and go­od rest, then march them and the pri­so­ners back to mus­te­ring-bar­racks. We'll sort out the pri­so­ners the­re. And see to it that you ma­ke as go­od ti­me co­ming back as Lord Kyrti­an did go­ing out."</p>
   <p>    Lord As­to­lan went flus­hed, then pa­le, and drew him­self up stra­ight as any of Gel's rec­ru­its. "My Lord!" he res­pon­ded, with a crisp sa­lu­te, fol­lo­wed by a bow, just for go­od me­asu­re.</p>
   <p>    Kyndreth trans­fer­red his ga­ze to the ot­hers. "The rest of you see that he suc­ce­eds in ma­king go­od ti­me," he conc­lu­ded, ma­king it per­fectly cle­ar that the pe­nalty for fa­ilu­re wo­uld land on all of the­ir sho­ul­ders.</p>
   <p>    Before they co­uld ma­ke any reply, Kyndreth's at­ten­ti­on had al­re­ady go­ne back to the ot­her Co­un­ci­lors. "Shall we ma­ke our de­par­tu­res, my lords?" he as­ked, ma­king it very cle­ar that he was le­aving, and if the ot­hers wan­ted to re­ma­in, they wo­uld ha­ve to find the­ir own ways back. And sin­ce he held the key to the tem­po­rary Ga­te…</p>
   <p>    There was no dis­sen­si­on.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian es­cor­ted them to the Ga­te, and watc­hed the stran­gely shi­ning struc­tu­re fa­de and di­sap­pe­ar af­ter they pas­sed thro­ugh it. He re­tur­ned to his tent to find Lady Moth en­ter­ta­ining his su­bor­di­na­tes with scan­dal.</p>
   <p>    "Well, As­to­lan!" he sa­id che­er­ful­ly as he pus­hed the tent-flap asi­de. "My things are al­re­ady pac­ked up and out of the way, and yo­urs are he­re-well, part of them any­way-so why don't I just ro­und up my sla­ves and es­cort Lady Moth back to her es­ta­te and le­ave you free to fol­low Lord Kyndreth's or­ders?"</p>
   <p>    Astolan swel­led with pri­de and self-impor­tan­ce. Cle­arly he hadn't ex­pec­ted to be con­fir­med in his new-if tem­po­rary- com­mand so so­on. "Cer­ta­inly, my lord, if that is yo­ur wish-"</p>
   <p>    "It is; if we start now, we will all be at Lady Moth's es­ta­te well be­fo­re sun­down," he sa­id firmly, and of­fe­red Lady Moth his arm. "My Lady?"</p>
   <p>    She swept him a curtsy, and al­lo­wed him to see a glimp­se of the wic­ked amu­se­ment in her eyes be­fo­re ac­cep­ting his arm. "My lord," she rep­li­ed. "Let us go in se­arch of that so-admi­rab­le chi­ef of yo­ur sla­ves, that so-stern fel­low Gel, and be on our way. I can­not wa­it to be ho­me, now that I know that my ho­me is sa­fe aga­in."</p>
   <p>    How is she ma­na­ging to ke­ep a stra­ight fa­ce? "I shall be at pa­ins to ke­ep it ever so, my lady," he rep­li­ed, de­ad­pan, and was re­war­ded by the sha­king of her sho­ul­ders as she tri­ed to ke­ep from la­ug­hing as they swept out.</p>

   <p>    Her gu­ide pa­used at the ed­ge of the mi­ning-pit, and Sha­na sur­ve­yed the ac­ti­vity be­low her with an in­ten­se fe­eling of sa­tis­fac­ti­on. The dra­gons had, inc­re­dibly, fo­und a pla­ce not that far from the New Ci­ta­del whe­re iron ore lay ne­ar to the sur­fa­ce of the earth, ma­king it pos­sib­le to ext­ract the pre­ci­o­us subs­tan­ce wit­ho­ut ha­ving to dig dan­ge­ro­us un­derg­ro­und tun­nels.</p>
   <p>    The dra­gons, ho­we­ver, had gi­ven so­me strict or­ders re­gar­ding mi­ning ope­ra­ti­ons. The fer­ti­le top­so­il was to be ca­re­ful­ly re­mo­ved be­fo­re true mi­ning be­gan, and set asi­de; when a spot had be­en pla­yed out, the har­ves­ted so­il was to be re­tur­ned and rep­lan­ted with sap­lings cul­led from the fo­rest, or clumps of me­adow-flo­wers. Alt­ho­ugh this ma­de very lit­tle sen­se to most of the Wi­zards and all of the hu­mans, the dra­gons we­re so ada­mant abo­ut this that no one ar­gu­ed.</p>
   <p>    Shana, ho­we­ver, fully ag­re­ed with this inj­unc­ti­on. She had li­ved among dra­gons for too long not to think in terms of cen­tu­ri­es rat­her than ye­ars-and the scars left on the land by un-con­si­de­red mi­ning wo­uld last for cen­tu­ri­es. In the de­sert and the mo­un­ta­ins, re­so­ur­ces we­re not inex­ha­us­tib­le; to scar the land and le­ave it that much less ab­le to sup­port the hu­mans and Wi­zards of the Ci­ta­del was unt­hin­kably stu­pid. No mat­ter what el­se she was, she ho­ped that even her own worst ene­mi­es wo­uld ne­ver think of her as that stu­pid.</p>
   <p>    A gre­at de­al of work was re­qu­ired to pro­du­ce a few in­gots of iron. In the pit be­low her, twenty or thirty qu­ite burly men, bro­ad sho­ul­ders and backs po­uring swe­at, la­bo­red with picks and sho­vels to fill cru­de whe­el­bar­rows. The bar­rows we­re in the­ir turn trund­led up a dirt ramp to the rim of the pit by less burly men, so­me wo­men, and even a few ado­les­cent boys with the musc­le to ma­ke the gru­eling trip over and over.</p>
   <p>    At the op­po­si­te rim of the pit sto­od the­ir pri­mi­ti­ve smel­ter, the myste­ri­es of which we­re of no in­te­rest to Sha­na. That was Zed's pur­vi­ew, and so far as Sha­na was con­cer­ned, as long as his fu­el-cut­ters and char­co­al-bur­ners cut the­ir tim­ber se­lec­ti­vely and rep­lan­ted whe­re they cut, she didn't ca­re. Her con­cern was for the iron to tra­de with and the land it ca­me out of, not for how the iron was pro­du­ced.</p>
   <p>    It was the num­ber of pe­op­le at work he­re that surp­ri­sed her-and the­ir ages. She had sent Zed and his wo­uld-be mi­ners off with the yo­ung dra­gon who'd fo­und this pla­ce, and the­re hadn't be­en a sing­le one of them much over the age of twenty-nor we­re any of them par­ti­cu­larly mus­cu­lar. But down the­re in the pit we­re men that co­uld ha­ve be­en la­bor-sla­ves for an El­ven­lord-</p>
   <p>    "What do you think of my crew?" cal­led Zed, as he wa­ved at her from ac­ross the pit. The mi­ners lo­oked up, glan­ced from him to Sha­na, and grin­ned bro­adly. Fi­re and Ra­in! They lo­oked li­ke la­bor-sla­ves and we­re scar­red li­ke gla­di­ators!</p>
   <p>    Not a fa­mi­li­ar fa­ce among them…</p>
   <p>    "I think they're very imp­res­si­ve," she cal­led back, as she and her gu­ide ma­de the­ir way aro­und the ed­ge of the pit. "But what I'd re­al­ly li­ke to know," she con­ti­nu­ed, as she ca­me clo­ser and didn't ha­ve to sho­ut, "is whe­re they ca­me from-"</p>
   <p>    Zed la­ug­hed. "They're sla­ves-ex-sla­ves ac­tu­al­ly. The sa­me ex-sla­ves that old Ca­el­lach dro­ve away from the New Ci­ta­del by tre­ating them as sla­ves rat­her than our fel­low-cre­atu­res."</p>
   <p>    "But…" She wrink­led her brow, puz­zled. "They're wor­king just as hard-har­der-than they wo­uld ha­ve if they'd sta­yed at the Ci­ta­del."</p>
   <p>    "But I'm not tre­ating them as sla­ves," Zed po­in­ted out. "I don't ex­pect them to work he­re for the she­er gra­ti­tu­de of ser­ving a wi­zard and get­ting not­hing mo­re ge­ne­ro­us than fo­od and shel­ter. They each get a fa­ir sha­re of the iron we smelt; they can tra­de it back to me for wha­te­ver we Wi­zards ha­ve that they want, or for what I've got­ten from the Tra­ders or the Iron Pe­op­le. That way the ac­tu­al iron stays in our cont­rol, but they get a fa­ir wa­ge for the­ir work." He ra­ised an eyeb­row. "We're gre­at be­li­evers in wa­ges he­re."</p>
   <p>    She sho­ok her he­ad in ad­mi­ra­ti­on. "Zed, that's bril­li­ant! Are they set­tled he­re? Do they want to stay? Can they bu­ild a vil­la­ge or so­met­hing?" It wo­uld be won­der­ful to ha­ve the­se strong folk ne­arby-the­re was so much they ne­eded simp­le la­bo­rers for, and Sha­na didn't in the le­ast obj­ect to bar­te­ring for work do­ne.</p>
   <p>    "They want to know whet­her Ca­el­lach is li­kely to po­ke his no­se in he­re first, be­fo­re they ac­tu­al­ly bu­ild a set­tle­ment," Zed rep­li­ed with a gri­ma­ce.</p>
   <p>    Shana glan­ced down, and saw that all work had stop­ped, whi­le the for­mer sla­ves all lis­te­ned for her reply.</p>
   <p>    She was not at all lo­ath to gi­ve it, pitc­hing her vo­ice so that the wor­kers co­uld he­ar it as well as Zed.</p>
   <p>    "Caellach Gwa­in is abo­ut as li­kely to ap­pe­ar he­re as I am to be wel­co­med in­to the ranks of the El­ven­lords," she sa­id, with a to­uch of aci­dic hu­mor. "He's got­ten so bad abo­ut ha­ving the ti­ni­est bit of iron ne­ar him that we've ta­ken to we­aring the fal­se-gold pen­dants when we aren't wor­king ma­gic. Lorryn calls them 'Ca­el­lach-cha­sers.'"</p>
   <p>    Zed's guf­faw drow­ned anyt­hing from the wor­kers, but Sha­na saw plenty of grins as they bent back to the­ir work.</p>
   <p>    "I think you can co­unt on a set­tle­ment go­ing up he­re, then," Zed rep­li­ed. "The­re's eno­ugh iron ore he­re to ke­ep the smel­ter go­ing for ye­ars and ye­ars, and mo­re than eno­ugh work for ever­yo­ne. Who­ever isn't mi­ning, smel­ting or ha­uling can be put to work on the rep­lan­ting and res­to­ra­ti­on of pla­yed-out are­as."</p>
   <p>    "I was af­ra­id, af­ter I saw that first lo­ad of in­gots, that I was pus­hing you too hard over he­re," she sa­id in to­nes aimed only for his ears, on­ce he stop­ped spe­aking. "I'm glad to see that I was mis­ta­ken."</p>
   <p>    Zed pat­ted her sho­ul­der. "Anything but," he rep­li­ed. "Ah- wo­uld you li­ke to see the smel­ter? Or not-"</p>
   <p>    "Not," she sa­id firmly. "I'm no Ca­el­lach, but this much iron kind of ma­kes the in­si­de of my he­ad itch."</p>
   <p>    Zed shrug­ged. "Do­esn't bot­her me as much, but then I've ne­ver had as much of the el­ven ma­gic as you do. He­re, I'll show you whe­re we want to put a set­tle­ment ins­te­ad. I think you'll be surp­ri­sed."</p>
   <p>    He tur­ned away from the smel­ter and he­aded in­to the wo­ods. Sha­na fol­lo­wed him, glad to get out of the hot sun, away from the smel­ter and un­der the tree-sha­dows.</p>
   <p>    "How did the Iron Pe­op­le re­act to our first de­li­very?" Zed as­ked, with acu­te-and tho­ro­ughly un­ders­tan­dab­le-inte­rest.</p>
   <p>    "By thro­wing a fes­ti­val, or so Me­ro tells me," she was happy to tell him. "I'm af­ra­id that the Tra­ders are a bit di­sap­po­in­ted, tho­ugh."</p>
   <p>    "The Tra­ders can le­arn to li­ve with the­ir di­sap­po­int­ment," Zed sa­id smugly. "Now we can start do­ing mo­re to pro­tect our­sel­ves-and we can send out the jewelry aga­in."</p>
   <p>    "That can't hap­pen too so­on for me," Sha­na sa­id fer­vently. "It's not just the Yo­ung Lords who ne­ed it, tho­ugh the mo­re jewelry we can get in­to the­ir hands, the mo­re dis­rup­ti­on they'll ma­ke with the Gre­at Lords. No, I want to get pi­eces to the La­di­es, and I es­pe­ci­al­ly want to get it in­to the hands of the sla­ves."</p>
   <p>    Want was too mild a word; ever sin­ce she had last he­ard from Keman and Do­ra, she was po­si­ti­vely wild to get the jewelry mo­ving out in­to the El­ven lands aga­in. If they co­uld get Lord Kyrti­an on the­ir si­de-</p>
   <p>    The jewelry might put Lord Kyrti­an on the­ir si­de. If he had a way to pro­tect his own pe­op­le from El­ven ma­gic, to pro­tect his lands from the ma­gi­cal at­tacks of ot­her El­ven­lords, the­re was no do­ubt in Sha­na's mind that Lord Kyrti­an's own in­ten­sely lo­yal figh­ters wo­uld be mo­re than a match for any physi­cal for­ce that the Gre­at Lords co­uld bring aga­inst him. It was only at­tack-ma­gi­cal at­tack-that he ne­eded to fe­ar.</p>
   <p>    And tre­ac­hery. The­re was that. And the Gre­at Lords we­re past mas­ters at tre­ac­hery.</p>
   <p>    "You think it might nul­lify the col­lars?" Zed as­ked with in­te­rest, "Re­mem­ber, if we can't do that, we might as well not gi­ve the stuff to them."</p>
   <p>    "I think I know how." Eagerly she out­li­ned her idea, which had co­me to her just that mor­ning. "If we ma­ke a sort of clams­hell de­vi­ce that clo­ses over the beryl in the col­lar, back and front-" she mi­med the idea with her hands "-so­met­hing that will lock in pla­ce, tight, even if we can't get the col­lar off, we ke­ep com­mands from get­ting to the elf-sto­nes and the sto­ne from ac­tu­al­ly do­ing anyt­hing to the we­arer."</p>
   <p>    Zed con­si­de­red the idea. "Inte­res­ting. It do­esn't help so­me­one li­ke a con­cu­bi­ne, who might ha­ve a col­lar stud­ded with beryls, but a com­mon wor­ker won't ha­ve mo­re than one. So un­less the Lords start rep­la­cing all the col­lars on all the­ir sla­ves, which wo­uld be ex­pen­si­ve, even for them, we co­uld free who­le gro­ups at a ti­me!"</p>
   <p>    Shana grin­ned with glee. "That was my idea-the clams­hel­ls wo­uldn't be big, and it wo­uldn't be hard to dist­ri­bu­te them. For ins­tan­ce, we co­uld smug­gle a who­le bag­ful out to the wor­kers in a fi­eld, the sla­ve ta­king the wa­ter-buc­ket aro­und co­uld pass them out, and the who­le gro­up co­uld bolt at on­ce."</p>
   <p>    Or the shells co­uld be pas­sed aro­und an army, at night, un­der co­ver of dark­ness. And when the mor­ning co­mes, and co­er­ci­on no lon­ger works on the figh­ters and they are sa­fe from ma­gi­cal at­tack, how many of them will re­ma­in to fight for the­ir mas­ters?</p>
   <p>    "Tricky," Zed sa­id with ad­mi­ra­ti­on. "It's too bad that col­lars are usu­al­ly me­tal, not le­at­her; we co­uld in­cor­po­ra­te cut­ters in­to the ed­ges of the clams­hell, and nul­lify the beryl and re­mo­ve the col­lar all in one go. Well, this is whe­re the camp is, and whe­re the men wo­uld li­ke to put in a per­ma­nent set­tle­ment."</p>
   <p>    There wasn't much the­re at the mo­ment, and it was a go­od thing that not only was it high sum­mer but the­re had be­en re­mar­kably go­od we­at­her, for the shel­ters we­re ba­rely eno­ugh to ke­ep off the ra­in. Sha­na co­uld see how it wo­uld ma­ke a per­fect spot for a set­tle­ment, ho­we­ver, and she ma­de all the right so­unds of ent­hu­si­asm for Zed and his pe­op­le. The­re was no do­ubt in her mind that she and Lorryn had ma­de the right de­ci­si­on in put­ting Zed in char­ge of mi­ning, smel­ter, and crews to man both ope­ra­ti­ons, alt­ho­ugh she wo­uld not ha­ve pic­tu­red him as a le­ader. And Ca­el­lach Gwa­in had, of co­ur­se, ar­gu­ed aga­inst the me­re tho­ught of put­ting so­me­one as yo­ung as Zed in char­ge of anyt­hing.</p>
   <p>    She comp­le­ted her ins­pec­ti­on-if that was not too of­fi­ci­al a word for me­rely lo­oking the si­tu­ati­on over-in short or­der. Things co­uld not pos­sibly be bet­ter; at the mo­ment, she re­al­ly didn't want pro­duc­ti­on go­ing any fas­ter. It wo­uldn't hurt tra­de to ke­ep the Iron Pe­op­le wa­iting for the­ir in­gots just a lit­tle bet­we­en each ship­ment; she didn't want them to start thin­king that the supply was un­li­mi­ted, and she had a long talk with Zed on just that su­bj­ect. He was di­sap­po­in­ted in one way, and re­li­eved in anot­her. He wo­uldn't ha­ve be­en un­hap­py to be as­ked to find mo­re ex-sla­ves to rec­ru­it, but on the ot­her hand, he didn't want his work­for­ce gro­wing past the po­int whe­re he co­uld hand­le everyt­hing him­self.</p>
   <p>    In the end, Sha­na and the la­test lo­ad of cru­de iron in­gots re­tur­ned over­land to the New Ci­ta­del by pack-mu­le, ar­ri­ving just abo­ut sun­set.</p>
   <p>    Just in ti­me for Ca­el­lach Gwa­in to run stra­ight in­to them.</p>
   <p>    He sta­red; he be­gan to sha­ke with an­ger. In a mat­ter of mo­ments, he was prac­ti­cal­ly be­si­de him­self with ra­ge.</p>
   <p>    "What are you do­ing, girl?" he scre­amed at the top of his lungs, dra­wing ever­yo­ne wit­hin he­aring dis­tan­ce to the mo­uth of the ca­vern whe­re the un­lo­ading was ta­king pla­ce.</p>
   <p>    "I sho­uld think that was per­fectly ob­vi­o­us," she re­tor­ted. Af­ter the long walk-for she was not go­ing to ri­de when she had two per­fectly go­od legs, and her we­ight-equ­iva­lent in iron bars co­uld be lo­aded on a mu­le in her pla­ce-she was hot and ti­red, and not in the mo­od for the tem­per-tant­rums of iras­cib­le old men.</p>
   <p>    "You idi­ot!" he shri­eked. "Brin­ging that-filthy stuff he­re? Brin­ging it in­si­de the ca­ves? You're mad! You're cra­zed! How is any­body sup­po­sed to work ma­gic with that fo­ul gar­ba­ge prac­ti­cal­ly on top of us?"</p>
   <p>    There we­re so­me grumb­les and mut­te­rings from the ol­der wi­zards in the crowd that had gat­he­red aro­und them, but this ti­me Sha­na sto­od her gro­und. It was abo­ut ti­me that the re­cal­cit­rant wi­zards adap­ted to the si­tu­ati­on, ins­te­ad of ex­pec­ting so­me­one to work aro­und the­ir re­luc­tan­ce to chan­ge.</p>
   <p>    "You'll work ma­gic aro­und it the sa­me way we yo­ungs­ters do," she sa­id firmly, hands on hips, gla­ring at him. "I sho­uld think you'd be gra­te­ful to me! The mo­re iron the­re is aro­und he­re, the sa­fer you are! Ha­ven't you at le­ast fi­gu­red that out by now?"</p>
   <p>    Usually she ma­de so­me pre­ten­se of po­li­te­ness to the old man, but she was in no mo­od for him at the mo­ment, and her at­ti­tu­de sent him in­to an in­co­he­rent frenzy.</p>
   <p>    That was just abo­ut the last straw.</p>
   <p>    "Shut up, you stu­pid old man!" she scre­amed-and sin­ce her sop­ra­no was con­si­de­rably mo­re pi­er­cing than his ho­ar­se howls, even he he­ard her, and sta­red at her, mo­uth aga­pe.</p>
   <p>    "Ever sin­ce we ar­ri­ved he­re, all you've do­ne is comp­la­in!" she sho­uted, her fa­ce flus­hed. "We've fed you, clot­hed you, se­en to it that you got yo­ur cre­atu­re com­forts, and you ha­ve do­ne not­hing, not­hing to help the rest of us! You're a pa­ra­si­te, Ca­el­lach Gwa­in, you're as use­less as a se­cond no­se and you aren't even half as en­ter­ta­ining! Now shut up and le­arn to work ma­gic aro­und iron li­ke ever­yo­ne el­se, or-or-"</p>
   <p>    "Or what?" Gwa­in sne­ered. "You'll turn me over to the El-ven­lords? That's just what you wo­uld do, isn't it? El­ven­ba­ne?"</p>
   <p>    As hot as she had be­en the mo­ment be­fo­re, now she was cold. "No," she sa­id flatly. "But only you wo­uld think that I co­uld. No. If you won't le­arn to adapt to our new li­fe he­re, Caellach Gwa­in, I will see to it that no one el­se will cos­set you from this mo­ment on. You will find yo­ur own fo­od or star­ve, cle­an yo­ur own clot­hing or go dirty, cut yo­ur own fi­re­wo­od or fre­eze. So­oner or la­ter, you'll fi­gu­re out how to li­ve li­ke a res­pon­sib­le adult, and high ti­me, too."</p>
   <p>    And with that, she tur­ned on her he­el and stal­ked off, pus­hing her way thro­ugh the sur­ro­un­ding crowd of ming­led yo­ung and old wi­zards.</p>
   <p>    Someone grab­bed her el­bow; she star­ted to pull away blindly, when she re­ali­zed it was Lorryn. "Don't run off," he mut­te­red. "Not now. This isn't over yet." He tur­ned her back to fa­ce the crowd.</p>
   <p>    "I've he­ard the mut­ters and the comp­la­ints," he sa­id lo­udly. "I've he­ard them from the mo­ment that I ar­ri­ved he­re. I co­uldn't help but no­ti­ce that most of them ca­me from the sa­me set of mo­uths-so let's just ad­dress this si­tu­ati­on on­ce and for all. I'm cal­ling a con­vo­ca­ti­on of all Wi­zards."</p>
   <p>    "Here?" so­me­one gas­ped. "Now?"</p>
   <p>    "Here and now," Lorryn ag­re­ed. "I gi­ve you all a qu­ar­ter-cand­le to get ever­yo­ne as­semb­led; who­ever isn't he­re by then I'll as­su­me has no in­te­rest in the way things are run in the New Ci­ta­del, and do­esn't fe­el the ne­ed to ha­ve his vo­ice he­ard."</p>
   <p>    About half of tho­se pre­sent shot or lum­be­red off in every di­rec­ti­on to gat­her fri­ends and ene­mi­es from every part of the Ci­ta­del. Sha­na lo­oked as­kan­ce at Lorryn.</p>
   <p>    "Is this a go­od idea?" she as­ked do­ubt­ful­ly.</p>
   <p>    "It had to hap­pen so­me­ti­me so­on," Lorryn rep­li­ed. "Bet­ter that it co­mes as a surp­ri­se to both si­des; Ca­el­lach and his cro­ni­es won't ha­ve a chan­ce to pre­pa­re them­sel­ves."</p>
   <p>    "And we're pre­pa­red?" she rep­li­ed, sta­ring at him inc­re­du­lo­usly.</p>
   <p>    "More than they are-and what's the be­set­ting sin of every one of the Whi­ners?" he as­ked, and ans­we­red him­self tri­ump­hantly. "La­zi­ness! That's why I only ga­ve them a qu­ar­ter-cand­le. How many will think it's too much tro­ub­le to drag them­sel­ves away from wha­te­ver they'd plan­ned or we­re in the mid­dle of?"</p>
   <p>    "Maybe eno­ugh to ma­ke a re­al dif­fe­ren­ce," she sa­id slowly-for al­re­ady the yo­ung wi­zards we­re co­ming up to the cle­aring at the ent­ran­ce, bro­ught in by the yo­ungs­ters who had scat­te­red li­ke qu­a­il to bring the mes­sa­ge to ever­yo­ne wit­hin re­ach of a pa­ir of fle­et fe­et.</p>
   <p>    With the help of a co­up­le of the­ir fri­ends, Lorryn pre­pa­red the area. This was al­so the spot whe­re fi­re­wo­od was chop­ped and sto­red, and the yo­ung wi­zards got to work, rol­ling in so­me logs for the less-than-he­althy to sit on down in front, and set­ting up sawn sec­ti­ons of trunk for him­self, Sha­na, and pre­su­mably Ca­el­lach to stand on so ever­yo­ne co­uld see them. Ca­el­lach, of co­ur­se, me­rely sto­od abo­ut and ob­ser­ved them so­urly. Mo­re and mo­re pe­op­le we­re ar­ri­ving with every pas­sing mo­ment, and by the ti­me the al­lot­ted span was go­ne, the only Wi­zards not pre­sent we­re a scant hand­ful of the ol­dest or la­zi­est. The big­gest surp­ri­se was the num­ber of pu­re hu­mans who had co­me as well; vir­tu­al­ly every full hu­man in the Ci­ta­del.</p>
   <p>    With a gre­at de­al of ove­rac­ted in­fir­mity, Ca­el­lach bul­li­ed a co­up­le of hu­man yo­ungs­ters in­to hel­ping him up on­to one trunk-sec­ti­on, as Sha­na and Lorryn to­ok the ot­her two.</p>
   <p>    "Now, set­tle down!" Lorryn sho­uted, very lo­udly, so that tho­se who we­re chat­te­ring and mil­ling abo­ut obe­di­ently stop­ped tal­king alo­ud and tur­ned the­ir at­ten­ti­on to whe­re the three of them sto­od. "All right, then. I am go­ing to mo­de­ra­te this con­vo­ca­ti­on sin­ce I'm the one who cal­led it."</p>
   <p>    "But you're Sha­na's lo­ver!" Ca­el­lach sput­te­red, red-fa­ced.</p>
   <p>    Shana was go­ing to pro­test, but Lorryn be­at her to it. The fu­ri­o­us lo­ok that Lorryn tur­ned on him sent him from red to whi­te, and he even shrank back a lit­tle. No one had ever se­en Lorryn angry be­fo­re-and he lo­oked po­si­ti­vely mur­de­ro­us.</p>
   <p>    "I am not," he rep­li­ed in­to the si­len­ce, "Las­ha­na's lo­ver. We are fri­ends, and she has be­en rel­ying upon my ex­pe­ri­en­ce on my fat­her's es­ta­te to help her hand­le you un­ruly lot. Even if that we­re true, it wo­uld ha­ve not­hing to do with this si­tu­ati­on and it wo­uld be no­ne of yo­ur bu­si­ness so long as her fos­ter mot­her ap­pro­ves. I am of­fen­ded, Ca­el­lach Gwa­in. I do sug­gest that you con­fi­ne yo­ur words to the is­su­es at hand, or I will be temp­ted to chal­len­ge you."</p>
   <p>    Challenge him? What on earth do­es he me­an by that? Sha­na thought, be­wil­de­red. Ca­el­lach Gwa­in evi­dently knew, tho­ugh, for he tur­ned even whi­ter, and stam­me­red an apo­logy.</p>
   <p>    "The pri­mary is­sue at hand," Lorryn sa­id, when the old wi­zard was do­ne, "is a gre­ater one than just the pre­sen­ce of iron wit­hin the Ci­ta­del, or the num­ber of pe­op­le who are at­ten­ding to tasks ot­her than… ho­use­ke­eping." His bland exp­res­si­on ga­ve no hint as to his own fe­elings on the su­bj­ect, and alt­ho­ugh they we­re no sec­ret to Sha­na, from the lo­oks on the fa­ces of Ca­el­lach's cro­ni­es, they we­re not su­re if he was Sha­na's par­ti­san or not. He might be co­ur­ting her, but he was al­so an aris­toc­rat, used to the at­ten­ti­ons of hund­reds of sla­ves, so sho­uldn't he be on the­ir si­de? For that mat­ter, he might only be using her to get the po­wer of le­aders­hip him­self-she saw that in the new spe­cu­la­ti­on with which Ca­el­lach re­gar­ded him.</p>
   <p>    "Caellach Gwa­in," Lorryn con­ti­nu­ed, tur­ning to the old wi­zard, "you ha­ve vo­iced yo­ur opi­ni­ons of­ten eno­ugh for the ears of yo­ur fri­ends and sup­por­ters-I must in­sist that you al­low ever­yo­ne in the Ci­ta­del to he­ar them."</p>
   <p>    Caellach sta­red at him; tri­ed wit­ho­ut suc­cess to sta­re him down. His exp­res­si­on re­ma­ined insc­ru­tab­le. "As mo­de­ra­tor, I will not be qu­es­ti­oning eit­her of you. Ins­te­ad, you will ans­wer qu­es­ti­ons from ever­yo­ne ex­cept me. I will see to it that the­re are no in­ter­rup­ti­ons and that you both ha­ve a fa­ir chan­ce to be he­ard."</p>
   <p>    What? That to­ok Sha­na comp­le­tely by surp­ri­se, and she felt se­ri­o­usly sha­ken. What on earth was he af­ter? Su­rely the Old Whi­ners wo­uld try to ma­ke her lo­ok a fo­ol-</p>
   <p>    But it was too la­te to back out now, for eit­her of them, as Lorryn fi­el­ded tho­se who wan­ted a chan­ce and se­lec­ted one of Ca­el­lach's cro­ni­es for the first qu­es­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "You we­re the one that bro­ught the El­ven­lords down on us in the first pla­ce, girl, so what've you got to say for yo­ur­self?" sho­uted the old man, who prac­ti­cal­ly tremb­led with eager­ness to fi­nal­ly ha­ve a chan­ce to conf­ront her in front of wit­nes­ses. "If it hadn't be­en for you and yo­ur pre­ten­si­ons of be­ing so­me mythi­cal El­ven­ba­ne, we'd still all be back in the Ci­ta­del and com­for­tab­le!"</p>
   <p>    Think! Don't re­act, think! "I ne­ver cal­led myself the El­venbane," she re­tor­ted, throt­tling down pa­nic and ir­ri­ta­ti­on that ming­led un­com­for­tably, set­ting her in­si­des topsy-turvy. "I ne­ver even he­ard of the El­ven­ba­ne un­til af­ter I was bro­ught to the Ci­ta­del. And be­si­des, it was the dra­gons that ma­de the El­ven­ba­ne up in the first pla­ce, not me!" She ca­ught sight of Fat­her Dra­gon back in the crowd, in his halfb­lo­od-sha­pe. "Right, Ka­la­ma­dea?"</p>
   <p>    Gazes fol­lo­wed hers, and se­ve­ral of the mo­re wary, el­derly wi­zards who fo­und the dra­gons as un­can­ny as Ca­el­lach did cle­ared away from him. Fat­her Dra­gon cle­ared his thro­at mo­destly. "Well, it was mostly my do­ing," he ad­mit­ted. "But yes. We dra­gons cre­ated the le­gend of the El­ven­ba­ne, and we we­re just as surp­ri­sed as the rest of you when the le­gend ca­me to li­fe." He war­med to his su­bj­ect. "We be­li­eve, we dra­gon­kin, that cer­ta­in cre­atu­res are en­do­wed at birth with gre­at ha­men-le­ai, which is the po­wer to be­co­me Fa­te rat­her than to be ste­ered by it, and I tell you all now, Las­ha­na, even as an in­fant, sho­wed such tre­men­do­us ha­men­le­ai that even if she had be­en ra­ised by ali­corns in the wil­der­ness, the le­gend wo­uld ha­ve fit­ted it­self aro­und her. Every dra­gon ack­now­led­ges that now, whet­her or not they co­unt her as a fri­end. Whe­re she walks, gre­at chan­ge will fol­low."</p>
   <p>    That was not what Sha­na had ho­ped he wo­uld say-not­hing li­ke it, in fact-but she ga­mely to­ok up whe­re she had left off. "As for all of you still be­ing in the Ci­ta­del, I don't think you wo­uld ha­ve las­ted un­de­tec­ted for much lon­ger. You we­re ta­king too many risks. So­me­one wo­uld ha­ve fo­und out why go­ods and sup­pli­es we­re va­nis­hing and whe­re they we­re go­ing, if not­hing el­se. The El­ven­lords we­re al­re­ady star­ting to won­der abo­ut that even be­fo­re I jo­ined you."</p>
   <p>    "Didn't I say that was too risky?" sa­id a wi­ze­ned old scrap of a wi­zard, be­fo­re he was hus­hed. Lorryn had al­re­ady sig­na­led so­me­one el­se to ask a qu­es­ti­on, and Sha­na felt her he­art sink as she sur­ve­yed the fa­ces aro­und her. She had felt, and so­un­ded, we­ak and un­cer­ta­in. She hadn't con­vin­ced an­yo­ne, and Fat­her Dra­gon hadn't hel­ped.</p>
   <p>    "What ma­kes you think you're bet­ter than any of the rest of us at le­ading?" sho­uted so­me­one from the back. "Both of you!"</p>
   <p>    "I don't," Sha­na rep­li­ed promptly, but Ca­el­lach was al­re­ady swel­ling with self-impor­tan­ce and ran right over the top of her.</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ve de­ca­des of ex­pe­ri­en­ce, not to men­ti­on in­tel­li­gen­ce and wis­dom," he bo­as­ted, "which is far mo­re than this im­pu­dent lit­tle girl can cla­im. I do not ma­ke im­pe­tu­o­us de­ci­si­ons, and I do not rush to emb­ra­ce so­met­hing just be­ca­use it is no­vel and new. The­re is no do­ubt in my mind that the si­tu­ati­on he­re is well on the way to be­co­ming in­to­le­rab­le, bet­we­en the­se fo­olish in­no­va­ti­ons in ma­gic and dan­ge­ro­us li­a­isons with bar­ba­ric wild hu­mans, not to men­ti­on cre­atu­res that aren't even hu­man. The yo­ung sho­uld ser­ve the­ir el­ders, not dic­ta­te ab­surd ru­les to them! They sho­uld be thril­led to tra­de the­ir ser­vi­ce for the wis­dom that we ha­ve gat­he­red!" He war­med to his su­bj­ect, sur­ro­un­ded as he was by his own nod­ding sup­por­ters, pa­ying no at­ten­ti­on at all to the exp­res­si­ons of so­me of tho­se who we­re fart­hest away. "What sho­uld we Wi­zards ha­ve to do with hu­mans, any­way-except in that they, too, sho­uld be eager to ser­ve us! We are mo­re po­wer­ful, we are lon­ger-li­ved and ha­ve the op­por­tu­nity to gar­ner far mo­re ex­pe­ri­en­ce than what can be le­ar­ned in the few ye­ars the­se mayfly hu­mans enj­oy. It is cle­ar that we are far su­pe­ri­or in every way-and this girl, this child, thinks that we are to tre­at them as equ­als! Ne­ver! I will ne­ver to­le­ra­te tre­ating such de­ba­sed cre­atu­res, cre­atu­res who sho­uld be com­pe­ting in de­vo­ti­on to me, as my equ­als!"</p>
   <p>    An ac­tu­al growl aro­se from the hu­mans who ma­de up the bulk of the crowd-per­haps few of them had ever re­ali­zed just how de­eply Ca­el­lach's pre­j­udi­ces went, nor how po­iso­no­us they we­re. At that mo­ment Sha­na re­ali­zed Lorryn's tac­tics in al­lo­wing this con­vo­ca­ti­on to ta­ke pla­ce in the way it had, for he had per­mit­ted Ca­el­lach full fre­edom to say wha­te­ver he cho­se with his fol­lo­wers aro­und him, and the old wi­zard's mo­uth had run away with him.</p>
   <p>    "Debased cre­atu­res, are we?" ca­me an angry sho­ut from one of the car­ters who had bro­ught the last batch of iron in­gots up from the mi­ne. "I'd li­ke to see you try yo­ur hand at a lit­tle ho­nest work, you soft whi­te worm!"</p>
   <p>    "You can just fetch and carry for yo­ur­self from now on!" ca­me anot­her, dis­gus­ted vo­ice, along with a cho­rus of si­mi­lar sentiments. Even so­me of the child­ren that Ca­el­lach had co­wed in­to obe­ying his de­mands to­ok he­art from the sen­ti­ments of the­ir el­ders, and ad­ded the­ir shrill vo­ices to the rest.</p>
   <p>    Caellach and the ot­hers wo­ke to the­ir dan­ger, but con­si­de­rably too la­te for any ret­rac­ti­on. They gat­he­red in a knot aro­und Ca­el­lach and it be­ca­me pa­in­ful­ly cle­ar to them how tiny a mi­no­rity they for­med, as a sea of angry fa­ces sur­ro­un­ded them. Sha­na and her short­co­mings we­re qu­ite for­got­ten.</p>
   <p>    Lorryn al­lo­wed them eno­ugh ti­me to re­al­ly be­gin to frigh­ten Ca­el­lach, be­fo­re using a lit­tle to­uch of ma­gic to amp­lify his vo­ice so that it car­ri­ed over the no­ise of what was fast be­co­ming a mob.</p>
   <p>    "Friends!" he bo­omed. "Qu­i­et! Ple­ase!"</p>
   <p>    Surprise si­len­ced all the vo­ices for the mo­ment-just long eno­ugh for one sing­le vo­ice, the vo­ice of her fos­ter mot­her Ala­ra, to be he­ard.</p>
   <p>    "Shana, the obj­ec­ti­ons se­em to be to all of the chan­ges," Ala­ra sa­id, in the first re­aso­ned vo­ice Sha­na had he­ard in the last few mo­ments. "And you re­al­ly we­re the aut­hor of most of them. So what ha­ve you to say abo­ut the obj­ec­ti­ons?"</p>
   <p>    "If you don't chan­ge," she sa­id, very slowly, cho­osing each word as ca­re­ful­ly as if she pic­ked her way ac­ross a tre­ac­he­ro­us swamp. "I think you be­co­me just li­ke the El­ven­lords."</p>
   <p>    That bro­ught true si­len­ce, in which even the sig­hing of the bre­eze in the­ir cle­aring se­emed lo­ud. It was a si­len­ce that beg­ged for an exp­la­na­ti­on and drew furt­her words, ho­we­ver un­wil­lingly, out of her.</p>
   <p>    "They ha­ven't chan­ged, not sin­ce they con­qu­ered this pla­ce, and may­be not even in lon­ger than that," she con­ti­nu­ed. "They as­su­me that they're the pro­per lords of the uni­ver­se and that not­hing they want or think or do can be wrong-no mat­ter how many ti­mes things hap­pen that pro­ve that they are wrong. When you don't chan­ge, you get brit­tle, and the next thing that hits you will bre­ak you."</p>
   <p>    She lo­oked past the fa­ces of her own fri­ends, out to the hu­mans, in who­se eyes smol­de­red re­sent­ment for all Wi­zards now, even her. "Chan­ging me­ans that we can't sit in our Ci­ta­del and think we're su­pe­ri­or to anyt­hing just be­ca­use we can do so­me things well. Don't you see?" She fumb­led a lit­tle. "We all ne­ed each ot­her. Oh, I can bring in a li­ve she­ep from the hills with ma­gic, but I don't ha­ve the first idea of how to ta­ke clay and ma­ke a wa­ter­tight cup, and let's fa­ce it, if I'm thirsty, I ne­ed that cup, and the per­son who can ma­ke it is su­pe­ri­or to me at that mo­ment! Don't you see?" she ple­aded. "I ne­ver wan­ted to be a le­ader, but-I don't know, may­be Ka­la­ma­dea is right and ha­men­le­ai has so­met­hing to do with it and I just can see that we all ne­ed to chan­ge and we all ne­ed each ot­her if we are go­ing to sur­vi­ve-and may­be, if they'll le­arn to chan­ge a lit­tle, we even ne­ed-them-"</p>
   <p>    She ges­tu­red help­les­sly at Ca­el­lach and his fri­ends, unab­le to put what she wan­ted to show them in­to words-the gre­at puz­zle that she saw in her mind that so­me­how had pla­ces for all of them to fit in­to.</p>
   <p>    But evi­dently, alt­ho­ugh the­re was so­me puz­zle­ment out the­re, she got part of her po­int ac­ross. The re­sent­ment and an­ger had fa­ded, and alt­ho­ugh the­re we­re gri­ma­ces at the tho­ught of inc­lu­ding Ca­el­lach and his ilk back in­to the fold, the­re se­emed to be ac­cep­tan­ce of the idea, too.</p>
   <p>    Then ca­me the thing she hadn't ex­pec­ted-</p>
   <p>    "It's hard on an old man, all this chan­ging," sa­id one of Ca­el-lach's cro­ni­es pla­in­ti­vely. "It's hard, girl. You go along with yo­ur li­fe all even, then sud­denly it's all up­set-but-"</p>
   <p>    He to­ok a de­ep bre­ath, and shuf­fled ac­ross the spa­ce bet­we­en Ca­el­lach's crowd and the rest of the con­vo­ca­ti­on. He lo­oked up at her, and he­aved a sigh. "I ha­te all of this un­com-for­tab­le­ness and ha­ving to do wit­ho­ut," he con­ti­nu­ed, half in comp­la­int, half in re­sig­na­ti­on, "but I'd rat­her stand with you than aga­inst you. Just don't ask too much all at on­ce of an old, ti­red man, will you?"</p>
   <p>    She got down off her sli­ce of tree-trunk and of­fe­red her hand. He to­ok it, and that was the be­gin­ning of the end. In ones and twos, the rest of Ca­el­lach's fol­lo­wers ca­me over to her si­de, alt­ho­ugh most of them just tri­ed to blend back in­to the crowd and didn't ac­tu­al­ly co­me to stand with her. It didn't mat­ter; they'd abandoned Ca­el­lach. Even if they didn't en­ti­rely ag­ree with her, even if they we­re still go­ing to ar­gue and grumb­le, they'd aban­do­ned the­ir le­ader and they had ope­ned them­sel­ves up to the pos­si­bi­lity of chan­ge.</p>
   <p>    It was eno­ugh. For now, it was eno­ugh.</p>

   <p>    Rena to­ok her pla­ce on the car­pet next to Me­ro in Di­ric's tent. The flaps we­re rol­led knee-high, and scrims of lo­osely wo­ven li­nen kept bugs out whi­le al­lo­wing a bre­eze to flow thro­ugh. It was din­ner­ti­me, a me­al much en­li­ve­ned the­se days by the ad­di­ti­on of ve­ge­tab­les sup­pli­ed by tra­ding and the gar­dens that the Corn Pe­op­le we­re gro­wing, as well as by the chan­ged herbs pro­vi­ded by Re­na her­self. Din­ner, sha­red with Di­ric and Ka­la, was a mo­re-than-ple­asant me­al, now that the first lot of cru­de iron in­gots had ar­ri­ved from the Ci­ta­del. On­ce aga­in, Di­ric's star was in the as­cen­dant, so far as his pe­op­le we­re con­cer­ned; and he had lost that wor­ri­ed frown. Ka­la was just as ple­ased and far mo­re open abo­ut it. Af­ter all, the Iron Pe­op­le now had everyt­hing they ne­eded-iron, go­od gra­zing and wa­ter, and even the re­ma­ins of the­ir old al­li­es, the Corn Pe­op­le, to set­tle in so­mew­he­re ne­arby and com­men­ce the far­ming that they wo­uld not or co­uld not do.</p>
   <p>    Rena and Me­ro we­re re­aping the be­ne­fits as well; as the rep­re­sen­ta­ti­ves of the Wi­zards, ever­yo­ne with a for­ge wan­ted to know what they knew abo­ut pos­sib­le fu­tu­re pro­duc­ti­on, and the­re we­re no few folks who wan­ted to see if they co­uld so­me­how ease to the he­ad of the qu­e­ue wa­iting for the next ship­ment. The Tra­der clans we­re a lit­tle dis­com­fi­ted to find that they we­re no lon­ger the only so­ur­ce of iron, but they'd got­ten over it, par­ti­cu­larly now that the wo­men among the Iron Pe­op­le had be­gun to ex­pe­ri­ment with fa­ce­ting the fo­ol's gold and po­lis­hing yet anot­her form of mi­ne­ral with a high iron con­tent that the Tra­ders had bro­ught in. Both ma­de fi­ne "gems" for set­ting, the new "oil-iron" in par­ti­cu­lar ha­ving a lo­vely li­qu­id-black she­en to it that lo­oked won­der­ful in blac­ke­ned-iron fi­lig­ree. So now the wo­men had mo­re ma­te­ri­al for the­ir tiny jewelry works­hops than they'd ever had be­fo­re and the new ma­te­ri­als had bro­ught on a spa­te of cre­ati­vity that had even the men int­ri­gu­ed and ho­ve­ring over the wo­men's work, trying to rec­kon how they co­uld co­ax the­ir ma­tes, mot­hers, sis­ters, and fri­ends to pro­du­ce so­me of the new work for them. Di­ric al­re­ady spor­ted le­at­her arm-gu­ards in­la­id with iron set­tings that held lar­ge oil-iron ca­boc­hons, co­ur­tesy of Ka­la's hands, and she was wor­king on a matc­hing col­lar as well. He was set­ting so­met­hing of a fas­hi­on, much to Re­na's si­lent amu­se­ment and Ka­la's open glee.</p>
   <p>    It se­emed an aus­pi­ci­o­us ti­me for Re­na to see abo­ut so­met­hing she had be­en plan­ning for a whi­le.</p>
   <p>    Kala bro­ught in pla­tes of flatb­re­ad, bro­iled me­at, thinly sli­ced ve­ge­tab­les, and bowls of so­ured cre­am. The Iron Pe­op­le co­uld now enj­oy one of the­ir fa­vo­ri­te me­als-flatb­re­ad rol­led aro­und spi­ced me­at strips and ve­ge­tab­les, gar­nis­hed with dol­lops of cre­am. Re­na and Me­ro had co­me to enj­oy the­se as much as the­ir hosts, and Me­ro qu­ickly ma­de him­self a roll as so­on as Ka­la set the plat­ters on the car­pet be­fo­re them.</p>
   <p>    "How badly do you want to ke­ep yo­ur two El­ven­lords, Di­ric? They don't lo­ok very he­althy to me," Re­na as­ked, as Di­ric re­ac­hed for a pi­ece of flatb­re­ad.</p>
   <p>    He didn't even pa­use in his mo­ti­on. "They ha­ven't be­en a lot of use for so­me ti­me," he ad­mit­ted, la­ying a pa­per-thin sli­ce of cu­cun-pod and so­me of Re­na's swe­ete­ned and ten­de­ri­zed gras­ses on the flatb­re­ad, fol­lo­wing it with strips of me­at and a dol­lop of so­ured cre­am. "Out of res­pect for yo­ur wis­hes they ha­ven't be­en en­ter­ta­ining us, but I don't think they wo­uld now even if we tri­ed to for­ce them in­to it with be­atings. I think they're go­ing mad, ac­tu­al­ly. The­ir ke­eper can ba­rely get them to eat and drink; I'm told all they do is sta­re at wha­te­ver they're po­in­ted at."</p>
   <p>    "I think they've go­ne mad," Re­na rep­li­ed, re­li­eved to he­ar the mat­ter-of-fact to­ne in his vo­ice. "You can still get Kel­yan to talk if you try hard eno­ugh, but Hal­dor-yo­ur ke­epers are ha­ving to fe­ed him by hand. I want them, if you don't."</p>
   <p>    "Tell me what you want to do with them, first," Di­ric rep­li­ed ca­uti­o­usly.</p>
   <p>    Rena to­ok a de­ep bre­ath and lo­oked to Me­ro, who ga­ve her an en­co­ura­ging smi­le. She lo­oked back in­to Di­ric's sab­le-brown eyes, and told her­self what a fun­da­men­tal­ly re­aso­nab­le man he was. "I want-I want to try so­met­hing. I want to see if my ma­gics can chan­ge pe­op­le's me­mo­ri­es. The­re ha­ve be­en ru­mors, oh fo­re­ver, that so­me of the Old Lords can do that, and I sho­uld think that sin­ce wo­men's ma­gics among my pe­op­le are used de­li­ca­tely, it sho­uld be easi­er for a wo­man to do that than a man. Sin­ce Kel­yan and his fri­end are al­re­ady mad, I can't hurt them furt­her, and I may be ab­le to help them." She ste­eled her­self. "If I can-help them, that is-the­re are se­ve­ral things I want to do with them. The first thing is to find out how the elf-sto­nes of the sla­ves' cont­rol­ling col­lars are ma­de and how the sla­ves are cont­rol­led by them."</p>
   <p>    "Shana's got this idea that wo­uld ta­ke less iron than the jewelry," Me­ro put in help­ful­ly, his gre­en eyes alight with ent­hu­si­asm for his fri­end's plans. "Sort of a clams­hell ar­ran­ge­ment to clo­se aro­und the beryl li­ke this-" he de­monst­ra­ted with his two hands snap­ping to­get­her "-and cut it off from ma­gic get­ting out or in. Tho­se wo­uld be easy to get in to the sla­ves in sack­fuls, and if ever­yo­ne who was re­ady to es­ca­pe all snap­ped the­ir iron-clams­hel­ls over the­ir sto­nes at on­ce, they co­uld ma­ke a njn for it. The El­ven­lords wo­uldn't be ab­le to pur­sue any sing­le in­di­vi­du­al or track him eit­her, and by the ti­me so­me­one with eno­ugh ma­gic to cast le­vin-bolts was sum­mo­ned, the sla­ves wo­uld be long go­ne."</p>
   <p>    "But we ha­ve to know how the elf-sto­nes work so we can see if the plan wo­uld work," Re­na con­ti­nu­ed, as Di­ric set down his half-eaten flatb­re­ad and le­aned for­ward, int­ri­gu­ed by the idea. "I ne­ver le­ar­ned how, and I don't think Lorryn ever did, eit­her, but Kel­yan pro­bably did. So I want to see if I can get him to show me. If I can't trick him in­to do­ing it, may­be Me­ro can get the me­mory stra­ight out of his mind. On­ce we know how to ma­ke the elf-sto­nes, we can test the clams­hel­ls."</p>
   <p>    "But that is not all you plan, I gat­her?" Di­ric as­ked, with he­avy eyeb­rows ra­ised. He lo­oked mo­re than int­ri­gu­ed now, he lo­oked ent­hu­si­as­tic.</p>
   <p>    "Um-no." She de­ci­ded to go ahe­ad and tell him her en­ti­re plan whi­le he still was open to it. "I want to wi­pe away every tra­ce in the­ir minds of be­ing cap­tu­red, of the Iron Pe­op­le, and rep­la­ce it with so­met­hing el­se."</p>
   <p>    "What el­se?" Di­ric wan­ted to know. "Why?"</p>
   <p>    "I tho­ught-" she fal­te­red for a mo­ment, then went on. "I tho­ught I'd const­ruct so­me new me­mo­ri­es-illu­si­ons re­al­ly- out of the way Lorryn and I wan­de­red aro­und in the wil­der­ness. Or may­be Me­ro can help me put things in the­ir minds, when I've blan­ked out the old me­mo­ri­es. And on­ce I knew that they we­ren't go­ing to re­mem­ber anyt­hing abo­ut the Iron Pe­op­le or the Wi­zards or dra­gons or anyt­hing, I'd put them to sle­ep and get Ke­man or one of the ot­her dra­gons to drop them so­mew­he­re ne­ar eno­ugh to an es­ta­te for them to find the­ir way back." She bit her lip and wa­ited for the ine­vi­tab­le re­ac­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "You me­an that you in­tend to free them?" Di­ric's eyeb­rows had craw­led all the way up to the top of his fo­re­he­ad. "You think we sho­uld let them go to jo­in the rest of our ene­mi­es?"</p>
   <p>    "Well, we can't kill them!" she sa­id, a lit­tle des­pe­ra­tely.</p>
   <p>    For a mo­ment she fe­ared that Di­ric wo­uld res­pond with, "And why can't we?" But he re­gar­ded her tho­ught­ful­ly, pul­ling on his lo­wer lip, and sa­id not­hing for a very long ti­me.</p>
   <p>    "If that was yo­ur plan," he rep­li­ed, pitc­hing his vo­ice low, "it se­ems a was­te of a per­fectly go­od re­so­ur­ce for de­cep­ti­on that we can furt­her use aga­inst the De­mons that you call El­ven­lords. Rat­her than gi­ving the pri­so­ners me­mo­ri­es of wan­de­ring abo­ut in the wil­der­ness, why not gi­ve them me­mo­ri­es that are comp­le­tely er­ro­ne­o­us?"</p>
   <p>    "Such as-?" Re­na as­ked, her he­art lif­ting. He was go­ing to let her do this! Fi­nal­ly she was go­ing to be ab­le to do so­met­hing that wo­uld help po­or Kel­yan and Hal­dor, but may­be help out Sha­na­as well!</p>
   <p>    "Oh-I think we can work out so­met­hing. Ma­ke them think that they we­re held cap­ti­ve by the Wi­zards, mo­re Wi­zards than the El­ven­lords ha­ve any no­ti­on exist." Di­ric grin­ned in that sudden way that ma­de him lo­ok li­ke a boy full of misc­hi­ef. "And in the­ir minds we can lo­ca­te the­ir pri­son in so­me imp­reg­nab­le fort­ress so­mew­he­re in the op­po­si­te di­rec­ti­on from the re­al Ci­ta­del." He win­ked wic­kedly. "For that mat­ter, con­coct a set of Wi­zards that ha­ve ne­ver even he­ard of our set! Ma­ke the De­mons think that they ha­ve an enemy that un­til that mo­ment they had known not­hing abo­ut! Ma­ke them was­te ti­me and war­ri­ors trying to find this new set of Wi­zards!"</p>
   <p>    Mero ut­te­red a who­op of la­ugh­ter. "Ances­tors! What an idea! It'll ha­ve them scramb­ling to gu­ard the­ir re­ar, it'll ha­ve them figh­ting over which set of Wi­zards are the most dan­ge­ro­us, and best of all, it will buy us mo­re ti­me to get stron­ger!"</p>
   <p>    "Exactly so." Di­ric pic­ked up his for­got­ten me­al, and wa­ved his free hand at Re­na. "If that is yo­ur plan, child, ta­ke them and wel­co­me. They are not­hing but a bur­den now, and if you can suc­ce­ed in yo­ur plan, you will con­vert them to an as­set."</p>
   <p>    He sa­id not­hing abo­ut what wo­uld hap­pen to them if she co­uldn't wi­pe the­ir me­mo­ri­es cle­an, but she de­ci­ded that she wo­uld de­al with that if the oc­ca­si­on aro­se. She than­ked the Iron Pri­est and tur­ned to her own un­to­uc­hed me­al with a go­od ap­pe­ti­te.</p>
   <p>    Diric had so­met­hing he wan­ted to dis­cuss with Me­ro af­ter din­ner, and Re­na de­ci­ded that she might as well tack­le the first part of her plan stra­ight off. Not be­ing a halfb­lo­od was so­met­hing of a han­di­cap, as she co­uldn't re­ad the minds of the two El­ven­lords di­rectly-so what she plan­ned to do was to try and co­ax the in­for­ma­ti­on out of them using words, il­lu­si­on, her own sex, and gent­le prod­ding. She'd had the Tra­ders bring her an old, de­ac­ti­va­ted col­lar from one of the es­ca­ped sla­ves wor­king with Sha­na; she bro­ught this with her as she en­te­red the­ir tent.</p>
   <p>    "Kelyan?" she cal­led; she'd put on die il­lu­si­on of one of the fi­ne gos­sa­mer gowns she'd worn in her old li­fe, and as Kel­yan ro­used from his apat­he­tic tran­ce and slowly ra­ised dull eyes to lo­ok at her, she cre­ated a se­cond il­lu­si­on, that they we­re in a typi­cal ro­om that one wo­uld find in an El­ven ma­nor. She used as her mo­del one of the ro­oms in which her fat­her wo­uld in­for­mal­ly en­ter­ta­in gu­ests, but kept the pla­ce shro­uded in sha­dows.</p>
   <p>    Kelyan lo­oked ter­rib­le; his eme­rald eyes we­re clo­uded, his pale ha­ir hung lank and brit­tle, the only ti­me he chan­ged his clot­hing was when his ke­epers strip­ped him of the so­iled clot­hing. Re­na wasn't su­re what had trig­ge­red this di­ve in­to in­sa­nity- per­haps he'd just snap­ped when he'd first se­en Ke­man in dra­gon-form, or per­haps he had just gi­ven up when it be­ca­me ob­vi­o­us that even tho­ugh the Wi­zards had be­en ac­cep­ted as al­li­es, the­re was no way that two El­ven­lords we­re go­ing to be re­le­ased. But his cur­rent con­fu­si­on, and the way in which he drif­ted in and out of a world of his own ma­king, wo­uld help her. She ho­ped that in his cur­rent men­tal sta­te he wo­uld eit­her be­li­eve that he was back among his own pe­op­le, or was dre­aming; eit­her wo­uld ser­ve her equ­al­ly well. It was un­li­kely that he wo­uld re­cog­ni­ze the Re­na he knew in the El­ven lady-gu­ise she had just cre­ated for her­self; she'd even do­ne her­self up in High-Fe­te fas­hi­on with exag­ge­ra­ted cos­me­tics.</p>
   <p>    His eyes brigh­te­ned as he to­ok in her and her sur­ro­un­dings; the­re still wasn't a gre­at de­al of sa­nity in them, but the­re was mo­re sen­se. To re­in­for­ce the il­lu­si­on she had cre­ated, she hid Kel­yan's com­pa­ni­on in cap­ti­vity in the sha­dows so that he wo­uldn't see Hal­dor's mo­ti­on­less form and ha­ve his il­lu­si­on bro­ken. He didn't se­em to no­ti­ce or ca­re.</p>
   <p>    "My lady-?" his he­ad til­ted in­qu­iringly, sho­wing that he re­al­ly didn't re­cog­ni­ze her.</p>
   <p>    "Sheyrena," she sup­pli­ed. "Wel­co­me to my fe­te, Lord Kel­yan."</p>
   <p>    "My Lady Shey­re­na." He nod­ded his he­ad. "Do I know you?"</p>
   <p>    Good. He do­esn 't re­mem­ber or re­cog­ni­ze me, or so­met­hing de­ep in his mind do­esn't want to. He'd much rat­her li­ve in dre­ams than in the world he's in now.</p>
   <p>    "I am the da­ugh­ter of a fri­end of yo­ur mot­her's," she rep­li­ed, aping as best she co­uld her own mot­her's man­ner when with a gu­est. "Thank you for co­ming with yo­ur mot­her to my lit­tle en­ter­ta­in­ment. I won­de­red if I co­uld im­po­se upon yo­ur go­od na­tu­re for a trif­ling task?"</p>
   <p>    "I am at yo­ur com­mand," he res­pon­ded, with a hand over his he­art and a slight bow.</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ve ta­ken a new body-sla­ve, a lit­tle girl who has not yet be­en fit­ted with a col­lar," she li­ed glibly. "As you know, my father will not re­turn from his me­etings with the Co­un­cil for se­ve­ral days, and I won­de­red-co­uld you-help me with cle­aring and set­ting this so that I can use it on the child?" she held out the col­lar, and he to­ok it from her fin­gers.</p>
   <p>    And frow­ned, slightly. "This is hardly a fit col­lar for the neck of a lady's sla­ve," he po­in­ted out.</p>
   <p>    She po­uted. "It is the only one I co­uld find that has not be­en set and pla­ced on the neck of a li­ving sla­ve, and I don't want to wa­it for so­me­one to const­ruct one for me," she sa­id with just a hint of pe­tu­lan­ce. "Be­si­des, I've ta­ken a par­ti­cu­lar fancy to this one child. She's qu­ite pretty, and I don't want Fat­her to de­ci­de to gi­ve her to so­me­one. If she's se­aled to me, he shan't be ab­le to."</p>
   <p>    Kelyan smi­led, and she smi­led back, ins­tantly for­ming a cons­pi­racy of two aga­inst the­ir gre­edy el­ders. "In that ca­se, I shall be happy to set it to you on yo­ur be­half," he rep­li­ed easily.</p>
   <p>    He bent over the col­lar and went im­me­di­ately to work on it-</p>
   <p>    And she fol­lo­wed the sligh­test nu­an­ce of that work with an in­ten­sity that su­rely wo­uld ha­ve start­led him, had he not be­en con­cent­ra­ting on the col­lar to the exc­lu­si­on of all el­se.</p>
   <p>    She had be­en do­ubly-pre­pa­red; in ca­se she ne­eded to use this ploy aga­in, she didn't want him to think it was anyt­hing ot­her than a dre­am.</p>
   <p>    When he fi­nis­hed his ma­gics, she than­ked him pret­tily. "You ha­ve do­ne me a gre­at go­od turn, Lord Kel­yan," she sa­id, flir­ting subtly with him in a way that wo­uld pro­bably ha­ve had Me­ro wild with sup­pres­sed je­alo­usy. "How can I pro­perly thank you?"</p>
   <p>    She pli­ed him with drug­ged wi­ne as she flut­te­red her eye­las­hes at him, per­fectly awa­re that he wo­uldn't ac­tu­al­ly do anyt­hing ot­her than flirt back. The­re was a rhythm to this sort of co­urts­hip; un­til he had her fat­her's ta­cit per­mis­si­on to ap­pro­ach her, he wo­uld only in­di­ca­te gal­lant in­te­rest. He wo­uldn't want to find him­self cal­led in­to a chal­len­ge that he might not ha­ve the tra­ined sla­ves to me­et. Le­asing gla­di­ators to me­et a chal­len­ge was pos­sib­le, but ex­pen­si­ve, sin­ce so­me of them wo­uld al­most cer­ta­inly die in the com­bat. Bet­ter to be ca­uti­o­us.</p>
   <p>    "Performing any ser­vi­ce for a fa­ir lady is a pri­vi­le­ge, not a bur­den," he rep­li­ed, dow­ning the wi­ne in a sing­le gulp. As she had plan­ned; she'd doc­to­red the wi­ne to ma­ke its tas­te smo­ot­her than ho­ney and dis­gu­ise its na­tu­re. She re­fil­led his glass, and he dow­ned that as well. She pas­sed him a lit­tle bowl of highly-sal­ted, to­as­ted bits of ro­ot-also ma­ni­pu­la­ted by her ma­gic. The mo­re he ate, the thirs­ti­er he wo­uld be­co­me.</p>
   <p>    "Thank you," he sa­id af­ter his first tas­te, and when she left the pla­te the­re be­si­de his hand, he didn't obj­ect. "I do not ha­ve the com­pany of a lo­vely lady of­ten eno­ugh that I see it as less than a re­ward in and of it­self," he con­ti­nu­ed, now sip­ping from his glass and nib­bling at the snacks.</p>
   <p>    She la­ug­hed softly, pro­du­cing a tink­ling lit­tle so­und that surp­ri­sed her and ma­de his eyes wi­den with ap­pro­val.</p>
   <p>    "I do not ha­ve the com­pany of fi­ne yo­ung lords of­ten eno­ugh to think it less than a tre­at," she rep­li­ed in the sa­me ve­in. "Tell me so­met­hing of yo­ur­self."</p>
   <p>    He was not at all lo­ath to do so, and she con­ti­nu­ed to ply him with wi­ne as well as con­ver­sa­ti­on un­til his eyes dro­oped, his he­ad drop­ped, and he col­lap­sed limply down on­to the pal­let he'd be­en sit­ting on all this ti­me. With a tho­ught and a flick of her fin­gers, she ba­nis­hed all the il­lu­si­ons she had cre­ated, le­aving him aga­in in the felt-wal­led tent. When he wo­ke the next mor­ning, if he re­cal­led the in­ci­dent at all, it wo­uld pro­bably be as a dre­am.</p>
   <p>    Then she blew out the lights, and left him in the dark­ness, tur­ning the col­lar over tri­ump­hantly in her hands.</p>
   <p>    Now it was Ka­la's turn on the new pro­j­ect to li­be­ra­te the sla­ves; she exa­mi­ned the col­lar and the sto­ne, and set abo­ut ma­king the clams­hell clasp that wo­uld lock the sto­ne away from we­arer and ma­ge. She was cer­ta­in she co­uld ma­ke such a mec­ha­nism; the trick wo­uld be to cre­ate one that was small eno­ugh to con­ce­al, but lar­ge eno­ugh and sturdy eno­ugh to ha­ve an ef­fec­ti­ve se­al.</p>
   <p>    Meanwhile, drop­ping her gu­ise and co­ming as her­self, Re­na at­temp­ted to en­ga­ge the two El­ves in con­ver­sa­ti­ons every day whi­le Me­ro "eavesd­rop­ped" on the­ir minds. As she tal­ked to them-or, as of­ten as not, at them-she pla­yed, de­li­ca­tely, with her ma­gic in­si­de the­ir he­ads.</p>
   <p>    When the Gre­at Lords re­mo­ved me­mo­ri­es, they did so wholesale, le­aving be­hind a blank. She had del­ved in­to the myste­ri­o­us wor­kings of the bra­in as well as she co­uld, and now she sus­pec­ted the­ir cru­de ef­forts, dif­fi­cult as they we­re, cre­ated a men­tal in­fant. Pro­bably af­ter­wards the­ir vic­tim had to be re-ta­ught even the simp­lest of things, which was why she-it was usu­al­ly a re­bel­li­o­us girl who was so ca­va­li­erly tre­ated- wo­uldn't ma­ke a re­ap­pe­aran­ce for a ye­ar or mo­re af­ter she was su­bj­ec­ted to the tre­at­ment. Re­na wan­ted to be mo­re subt­le.</p>
   <p>    So whi­le she tal­ked and spi­ed upon the physi­cal wor­kings in­si­de the­ir he­ads, she did so on the sa­me mi­nu­te le­vel that she wor­ked when ma­king the le­aves and plants swe­et and tasty-or just pla­in edib­le. When Me­ro "saw" a me­mory that he knew they ne­eded to ex­pun­ge-which wo­uld be when one of the El­ves ac­tu­al­ly tho­ught abo­ut it-he sig­na­led Re­na. She wo­uld know then whe­re it physi­cal­ly re­si­ded, and that, she co­uld chan­ge. Af­ter a few days, she be­gan do­ing just that. Gently, she bro­ke the con­nec­ti­ons that ma­de the me­mo­ri­es, then era­sed them al­to­get­her with the ti­ni­est of shocks-much, much smal­ler and mo­re subt­le than tho­se that ca­used bra­ins­torms. When she was do­ne, tho­se par­ti­cu­lar me­mo­ri­es we­re go­ne. Ask Kel­yan abo­ut them, and he wo­uld lo­ok at her blankly.</p>
   <p>    She had ho­ped that she wo­uld be ab­le to re­mo­ve the me­mo­ri­es se­qu­en­ti­al­ly, but alas, that was not pos­sib­le. Me­mory, it se­emed, was a pe­cu­li­ar thing. It wasn't se­qu­en­ti­al; me­mory cha­ins led oddly to in­ci­dents that se­emed to ha­ve not­hing what­so­ever to do with the trig­ge­ring re­col­lec­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    But one thing was ab­so­lu­tely cer­ta­in, and that was the mo­re she era­sed, the mo­re nor­mal Kel­yan-and in par­ti­cu­lar Hal­dor, sin­ce he was the most withd­rawn-be­ca­me.</p>
   <p>    When that hap­pe­ned, me­mo­ri­es we­re easi­er to trig­ger and thus, to re­mo­ve. Re­na's prog­ress with them ca­me in le­aps and bo­unds, and so­on they we­re both as ac­ti­ve and alert as they'd be­en when first cap­tu­red. That was pro­mi­sing, sin­ce it wo­uld ha­ve be­en the next thing to mur­der to drop the two of them un­cons­ci­o­us so­mew­he­re if Hal­dor was still ne­ar-ca­ta­to­nic, but it cre­ated a new prob­lem.</p>
   <p>    As they reg­res­sed in­to the past, they no lon­ger had the memories that told them that re­sis­tan­ce was of no use, that es­ca­pe was not pos­sib­le. By ha­ving the­ir eve­ning fo­od drug­ged, bu­il­ding il­lu­si­ons, and in­ter­ro­ga­ting them se­pa­ra­tely, Re­na was ab­le to con­vin­ce them that she and her qu­es­ti­ons we­re no mo­re than an int­ri­gu­ing dre­am. She didn't even ha­ve to con­vin­ce them that they we­re in the midst of a dre­am se­qu­en­ce, sin­ce she was ab­le to era­se the me­mory of each night be­fo­re she left them drug­ged and sle­eping.</p>
   <p>    "But what are we go­ing to do with them?" she as­ked Me­ro des­pe­ra­tely, three days af­ter she had be­gun this task, when Hal-dor had an­no­un­ced his in­ten­ti­on to es­ca­pe from the­ir cur­rent cap­ti­vity the next day. She drop­ped down be­si­de him on the grass out­si­de the­ir tent, both of them sta­ring up at the star-be­gem­med sky over the­ir he­ads. Her hand re­ac­hed for his, only to find his re­ac­hing for hers. She to­ok com­fort from the to­uch. "So­oner or la­ter, they're go­ing to try to ma­ke a run, and that's only go­ing to ma­ke a ter­rib­le amo­unt of tro­ub­le."</p>
   <p>    "Keep 'em drug­ged by day," Me­ro ad­vi­sed, squ­e­ezing her hand. "We ha­ve to fi­gu­re out how to gi­ve them a new past, and I ha­ven't wor­ked that one out yet." Mo­on­light flo­oded the camp, al­most bright eno­ugh to re­ad by. He sho­ok his he­ad at her. "I don't know. Il­lu­si­ons? But that wo­uld ta­ke as much ti­me to show them as it wo­uld for them to li­ve it? I might be ab­le to stick new me­mo­ri­es right in the­ir he­ads whe­re the old ones we­re, but for one per­son to cre­ate all that-"</p>
   <p>    "Does it ha­ve to be one per­son?" Re­na in­ter­rup­ted. "What if the­re we­re se­ve­ral?" She flus­hed with the ex­ci­te­ment of sud­denly se­e­ing a pos­sib­le so­lu­ti­on. "We don't ha­ve to be the ones to ma­ke the new me­mo­ri­es! We co­uld ask Ka­la­ma­dea and Ala­ra to co­me get them, and Sha­na and Zed and so­me of the ot­her Wi­zards co­uld all pitch to­get­her and do it!"</p>
   <p>    Mero sho­ok his he­ad. "I don't know," he rep­li­ed du­bi­o­usly. "Wo­uldn't tho­se me­mo­ri­es get aw­ful­ly con­fu­sing with so many pe­op­le med­dling?"</p>
   <p>    "Isn't it bet­ter for us if they are con­fu­sing?" Re­na co­un­te­red, fe­eling even mo­re cer­ta­in that this was the right way to hand­le the prob­lem. "We don't want them to ha­ve a who­le pic­tu­re, we just want them to ha­ve frag­ments, don't we? Let them think they we­re drug­ged most of the ti­me, or ens­pel­led, but the mo­re con­fu­sing the­ir me­mo­ri­es are, the mo­re con­fu­sed the Old Lords will be."</p>
   <p>    "And the mo­re con­fu­sed the Old Lords are, the mo­re li­kely that they'll be alar­med-I see whe­re you're go­ing with this." Me­ro chuck­led unex­pec­tedly, and hug­ged her. "You're right, Re­na, you're right! I'll try and re­ach Sha­na and exp­la­in all this and see if she falls in with the plan. I'll ke­ep trying un­til I re­ach her."</p>
   <p>    "And I'll wi­pe the­ir me­mo­ri­es back to the­ir cap­tu­re," she sa­id hap­pily, se­cu­re now that her plan wo­uld work exactly as she had ho­ped.</p>
   <p>    In a few days, the dra­gons ar­ri­ved-but qu­i­etly, wit­ho­ut fan­fa­re, in the gu­ise of Wi­zards. Re­na had ne­ver se­en Ala­ra in that form; Sha­na's fos­ter-mot­her had cho­sen to re­semb­le a very sturdy wo­man of in­de­ter­mi­na­te age, with high che­ek­bo­nes and ha­ir of de­ep brown. Ka­la­ma­dea, of co­ur­se, wo­re the gu­ise with which the Iron Pe­op­le we­re al­re­ady fa­mi­li­ar, and when he and she wal­ked in­to the camp at dawn, Di­ric and the ot­her le­aders of the gro­up wel­co­med him-tho­ugh the wel­co­me was tem­pe­red with the me­mory of the last ti­me they had se­en him, in his re­al sha­pe of a hu­ge, blue-black dra­gon.</p>
   <p>    "We've co­me to carry off yo­ur in­con­ve­ni­ent gu­ests," Fat­her Dra­gon sa­id ge­ni­al­ly, be­aming as if he'd had the gre­atest of tre­ats bes­to­wed upon him. No mat­ter that the last ti­me an­yo­ne of the Iron Pe­op­le had se­en him, it was as a dra­gon; he be­ha­ved so nor­mal­ly, and lo­oked so harm­less, so inof­fen­si­ve, that it was hard for an­yo­ne to think of the me­na­cing dra­gon with tho­se gu­ile­less gre­en eyes pe­ering at them out of a sea of wrink­les. Fat­her Dra­gon pla­yed the part of an ec­cent­ric lit­tle old man to per­fec­ti­on, and so­on had Di­ric chat­ting with him li­ke the old fri­end he was. With Di­ric ac­ting so nor­mal­ly, the rest of his pe­op­le re­la­xed as well.</p>
   <p>    "And what ha­ve you do­ne with Myre?" he as­ked, at last.</p>
   <p>    "We ga­ve her over to the ke­eping of the Corn Pe­op­le for now; they do not trust her in the le­ast, for I told them only that she had ne­arly bet­ra­yed us and her own pe­op­le to the De­mons." Di­ric lo­oked smug, and Re­na had to smi­le. That was at le­ast partly true, af­ter all! "They gi­ve her fi­eld tasks to do, and no fo­od if she will not work. She has qu­ickly le­ar­ned the va­lue of car­rying out what she is told to do."</p>
   <p>    "Obviously, you aren't con­cer­ned abo­ut her es­ca­ping?" Ala­ra ma­de that a qu­es­ti­on; she co­uldn't qu­ite cont­rol the pa­in she felt at this po­si­ti­on her se­cond-born fo­und her­self in, but Di­ric mi­sin­terp­re­ted it.</p>
   <p>    "Oh, no, lady! If she wis­hes to run off, we will let her! She is not so gre­at a help to us that we wo­uld miss her, and she can­not re­mo­ve the col­lar that ke­eps her lo­oking as one of the De­mons' sla­ves. She can­not go back to the De­mons, so-the Wi­zards, we, the Corn Pe­op­le and the Tra­ders all know of her tre­ac­hery and wo­uld not re­mo­ve it." He smi­led. "If she wis­hes to wan­der the pla­ins, alo­ne and una­ided, in pre­fe­ren­ce to re­ma­ining with the Corn Folk whe­re she has fo­od and shel­ter, well, let her sa­vor her fre­edom."</p>
   <p>    Alara sig­hed, but sa­id not­hing; Ka­la­ma­dea co­ve­red her si­len­ce with chat­ter. Re­na ga­ve her a lo­ok of sympathy; for all that Myre had be­en a mi­se­rably thank­less child, Myre was her da­ugh­ter. It must ha­ve torn po­or Ala­ra's he­art to ha­ve to si­de with one child-or child­ren, co­un­ting Sha­na as Ala­ra's fos­ter-da­ugh­ter-aga­inst anot­her.</p>
   <p>    "We'll wa­it un­til dark to ta­ke them, so we don't dist­ress yo­ur pe­op­le un­duly," Ka­la­ma­dea was sa­ying qu­i­etly, as the ot­her El­ders of the tri­be ma­de the­ir ca­uti­o­us gre­etings, lost in­te­rest, and went back to the­ir usu­al tasks.</p>
   <p>    "That is well," Di­ric sa­id judi­ci­o­usly, then brigh­te­ned. "But you must al­so see the prog­ress my Ka­la has ma­de upon yo­ur ot­her ne­ed! And you must see the new jewels my lady-smiths ha­ve ma­de! Co­me!"</p>
   <p>    Rena and Me­ro spent the rest of the day in the com­pany of Di­ric and the two dra­gons. Di­ric must ha­ve shown them every jewelry for­ge in the camp, and alt­ho­ugh Ala­ra did not on­ce ask to see her way­ward da­ugh­ter, Re­na had to won­der if Di­ric was trying to dist­ract the dra­gon to ke­ep her from ma­king that very re­qu­est.</p>
   <p>    At last-at long last, for even Re­na was be­gin­ning to ti­re of watc­hing jewe­lers at work, a task she nor­mal­ly fo­und fas­ci­na­ting-the sun set, and dark­ness fell.</p>
   <p>    She left then, to see to the two she now con­si­de­red "her" char­ges. She fo­und them in­sen­sib­le, so tho­ro­ughly drug­ged that not even a he­arty sha­king co­uld wa­ke them. Not­hing less wo­uld do; ob­vi­o­usly they co­uldn't ri­de out of he­re as she and Me­ro had do­ne, a-dra­gon­back. They wo­uld ha­ve to be car­ri­ed.</p>
   <p>    She and fo­ur of the yo­un­ger Iron Pri­ests bund­led the un­cons­ci­o­us El­ves in­to the sa­me kind of swad­dlings that the Iron Pe­op­le used for the­ir in­fants, only adult-si­zed, comp­le­te with a ri­gid bo­ard very li­ke a crad­le-bo­ard. The swad­dlings wo­uld pre­vent them from mo­ving, the bo­ard wo­uld en­su­re that they wo­uldn't bend in the mid­dle; now they co­uld be put in a net sling, to be car­ri­ed in dra­gon-claws back to the Ci­ta­del.</p>
   <p>    Once pac­ka­ged up li­ke a pa­ir of par­cels for de­li­very, the Iron Pri­ests each to­ok an end and un­ce­re­mo­ni­o­usly car­ri­ed the mo­ti­on­less bund­les out in­to the dark­ness.</p>
   <p>    Rena fol­lo­wed be­hind, as the yo­ung Pri­ests in the­ir pe­cu­li­ar cloth he­ad­res­ses and le­at­her ap­rons car­ri­ed the bund­les as far as the open gras­slands out­si­de of the camp, put them down in the wa­iting nets, and hur­ri­ed off. They didn't lo­ok back and Re­na didn't bla­me them; if she her­self hadn't spent so much ti­me with Ke­man in all of his forms, she wo­uld ha­ve be­en ner­vo­us aro­und the dra­gons.</p>
   <p>    And Ka­la­ma­dea and Ala­ra wo­uld be back from fe­eding at any mo­ment…</p>
   <p>    The sud­den "wind" that ca­me up all aro­und her, the thun­der of un­se­en wings over­he­ad, war­ned her that they we­re he­re.</p>
   <p>    Silvered by the mo­on­light, cas­ting black sha­dows that stretc­hed ac­ross the fran­ti­cal­ly-wa­ving gras­ses in front of them, they back­win­ged in be­si­de the­ir char­ges. Re­na step­ped back in­vo­lun­ta­rily; she had so­me­how for­got­ten how big the fully adult dra­gons we­re in the­ir true forms. Fat­her Dra­gon usu­al­ly re­du­ced his, to fit in with the ot­hers, and to be ab­le to use the la­irs in­si­de the Ci­ta­del-but dra­gons ne­ver stop­ped gro­wing entirely, and he easily dwar­fed Ala­ra, and Ala­ra was twi­ce the si­ze of her son, Ke­man.</p>
   <p>    They we­re li­ke for­ces of na­tu­re, too big, too po­wer­ful to re­al­ly comp­re­hend; she put her hands out in an un­cons­ci­o­us ges­tu­re of war­ding. She might not even ha­ve be­en the­re for all the no­ti­ce that they to­ok Of her.</p>
   <p>    They had eaten well among the herds, and they had a long way to go, all of it this very night, be­fo­re the two El­ves wo­ke. The­re was no ti­me for fa­re­wel­ls, and in her he­art, Re­na co­uldn't bla­me Ala­ra for wan­ting to be go­ne from the pla­ce whe­re her yo­un­gest lan­gu­is­hed in her pri­son of iron col­lar and hu­man flesh.</p>
   <p>    Instead, each pa­used on the gro­und only long eno­ugh to se­ize a net and ho­ok it in­to claws as long as Re­na's arm. Then, with a le­ap for the sky and a tre­men­do­us bo­oming of wings, they we­re off.</p>
   <p>    In mo­ments, they we­re only dark sha­dows, be­ating slow wings aga­inst the sil­ver mo­on. Then, go­ne.</p>
   <p>    Rena stra­ined her eyes, but co­uldn't see them-and jum­ped when Me­ro to­uc­hed her arm.</p>
   <p>    "Well," he sa­id qu­i­etly, "it's out of our hands now. You've gi­ven Sha­na a tre­men­do­us we­apon, my lo­ve, and now it's up to her to ma­ke the best use of it. You've do­ne yo­ur part; you can re­lax."</p>
   <p>    Only when he sa­id that did she re­ali­ze that she co­uld. And that Me­ro had sa­id that she had, at last, gi­ven Sha­na ma­te­ri­al help una­ided by an­yo­ne. She glo­wed with ple­asu­re at the me­re tho­ught, and la­ug­hed a lit­tle.</p>
   <p>    "I sup­po­se I can, can't I?" she rep­li­ed, and tur­ned so that his arm went aro­und her sho­ul­ders. "Well, then-" she con­ti­nu­ed, play­ful­ly, fe­eling strong and em­bol­de­ned by her suc­cess, "Don't you ha­ve so­me-ah-co­ur­ting to catch up on?"</p>
   <p>    For a mo­ment he sta­red at her, as if un­su­re of how to re­act. "I do?" he sa­id, a lit­tle stu­pidly.</p>
   <p>    -then he grin­ned, bro­adly. "I sup­po­se I do," he sa­id with far mo­re sen­se…</p>
   <p>    … then pro­ce­eded to ma­ke a very go­od start on all that catc­hing-up.</p>

   <p>    Lady Tri­ana su­per­vi­sed the pre­pa­ra­ti­on of her re­cep­ti­on cham­ber with the sa­me ca­re a go­od ge­ne­ral wo­uld ha­ve gi­ven to the pre­pa­ra­ti­on of bat­tle-plans. Things we­re be­gin­ning to mo­ve, at last, alt­ho­ugh not en­ti­rely in the di­rec­ti­on she had wan­ted. Ael­mar­kin was on his way to her ma­nor-she knew this, of co­ur­se, be­ca­use she had not gi­ven him an ac­cess-key to her Por­tal, and as a con­se­qu­en­ce he had to ma­ke the last leg of his jo­ur­ney the hard way, over­land from the ma­nor whe­re Ael­mar­kin had a fri­end wil­ling to al­low him the use of his Por­tal. He pro­bably didn't even know that she had a Por­tal. The­re we­ren't many who she trus­ted with keys to it, so it wasn't com­mon know­led­ge.</p>
   <p>    She'd had plenty of ti­me to pre­pa­re for him by now, and he knew that. Al­re­ady she had an ad­van­ta­ge over him.</p>
   <p>    She had be­en ex­pec­ting this vi­sit for so­me ti­me; in fact, she was surp­ri­sed that he hadn't tur­ned up be­fo­re this. Ael­mar­kin's co­usin Lord Kyrti­an, rat­her than disg­ra­cing him­self, was dis­tin­gu­is­hing him­self on the bat­tle­fi­eld aga­inst the re­bel­li­o­us Yo­ung Lords. Af­ter that last ro­ut of the Yo­ung Lords, his star was par­ti­cu­larly high with the Co­un­cil. Ael­mar­kin must be fu­ri­o­us.</p>
   <p>    She only wis­hed that she had ne­arly as much of an ad­van­ta­ge over Ael­mar­kin as she was go­ing to pre­tend she had. Her lit­tle spy in the ho­use­hold, kept as she was in the ha­rem and with no ac­cess to yo­ung Kyrti­an when he was away on his mar­ti­al bu­si­ness, had pro­ved of lit­tle use. The do­mes­tic de­ta­ils that the sla­ve had be­en sen­ding we­re only of in­te­rest in that they sho­wed how tho­ro­ughly Kyrti­an's mot­her held the re­ins of the ma­nor. A pity, that. It ap­pe­ared that Tri­ana was go­ing to ha­ve to do most of the work of sub­ver­ting Lord Kyrti­an her­self.</p>
   <p>    But it was, of co­ur­se, not to her ad­van­ta­ge to al­low Aelmarkin to know any of this, and she didn't in­tend to. She wo­uld pro­bably let him know that she had the spy; that wo­uld be use­ful wit­ho­ut gi­ving away too much.</p>
   <p>    When Ael­mar­kin ar­ri­ved, what she did in­tend was that Ael-mar­kin wo­uld see a si­de of her that he wo­uld ne­ver ha­ve ex­pec­ted. All he had ever se­en was the tempt­ress, and that was all he was re­ady for. He pro­bably ex­pec­ted that she wo­uld try to use her wi­les on him.</p>
   <p>    Men we­re so pre­dic­tab­le.</p>
   <p>    She had two dif­fe­rent re­cep­ti­on cham­bers, for two very dif­fe­rent pur­po­ses; this one al­so ser­ved as the of­fi­ce from which she ran her own lit­tle es­ta­te, and as such, it was both to­tal­ly "li­ke" her and comp­le­tely un­li­ke any of the fa­ces she pre­sen­ted to the out­si­de world. It was not spa­re and as­ce­tic by any me­ans; the desk be­hind which she sat was a work of art, fit­ted to­get­her from mas­si­ve pi­eces of hand-car­ved, pet­ri­fi­ed wo­od po­lis­hed to a mir­ror-gle­am, and fit­ted aro­und her so that she co­uld ke­ep every bit of work ne­ar at hand wit­ho­ut ha­ving to re­ach for it. The char­co­al-co­lo­red, le­at­her-uphols­te­red cha­ir that crad­led her was as com­for­tab­le as any syba­ri­tic co­uch, and gli­ded on ra­ils in­to and out of the nic­he wit­hin the cur­ve of the desk. The­re was a matc­hing co­uch ac­ross from the desk; it matc­hed su­per­fi­ci­al­ly, that is, but it had be­en ma­de so that, alt­ho­ugh it was ext­re­mely com­for­tab­le, it was tre­ac­he­ro­us. Be the oc­cu­pant ever so tall, who­ever sat the­re wo­uld find that his he­ad was lo­wer than hers, and get­ting up cre­ated so­me awk­ward mo­ments. For the rest, the cham­ber exu­ded a rest­ra­ined opu­len­ce; soft, dark grey car­pet with subt­le grey-on-grey pat­tern, sil­ver-grey sa­tin dra­pe­ri­es co­ve­ring the walls, ligh­ter in co­lor than the car­pet but with the sa­me pat­tern. The only co­lor in the ro­om lay in the sto­ne of the desk, which drew the eye li­ke a mag­net, away from Tri­ana. Which was the po­int; it was dif­fi­cult for a be­a­uti­ful el­ven lady to ap­pe­ar in­ti­mi­da­ting, but the desk ma­na­ged to overw­helm simply by be­ing.</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin had re­ac­hed the ga­tes of her es­ta­te and be­en ad­mit­ted not long ago. He wo­uld ar­ri­ve at any mo­ment, and she was per­fectly re­ady for him.</p>
   <p>    Meanwhile she bu­si­ed her­self with the ac­co­unts. With the fall in her for­tu­nes, her lit­tle es­ta­te had to be self-sup­por­ting, for the­re we­re no mo­re gifts-well, call them what they we­re, bri­bes-forth­co­ming from tho­se who wis­hed to at­tach them­sel­ves to a ri­sing star. She sup­po­sed she co­uld ha­ve imp­ro­ved her for­tu­nes by mar­rying, but that was hardly a so­lu­ti­on that was to her tas­te. The­re wasn't an­yo­ne free among the Old Lords who wasn't a clo­se match for her wits and who wo­uldn't hed­ge her aro­und with so many const­ra­ints that it wo­uld ta­ke all of her energy just to con­ti­nue to enj­oy her­self as she had. And as for the Yo­ung Lords still lo­yal to the­ir si­res--well, she was not min­ded to wet-nur­se a cal­low yo­uth, who had no inc­li­na­ti­on to work, no in­te­rests but his own amu­se­ment, and no am­bi­ti­ons ex­cept to in­dul­ge in sex and ga­mes. She'd be bet­ter off adop­ting such a yo­ung fo­ol than wed­ding him; at le­ast then she co­uld tre­at the fel­low li­ke the child he was.</p>
   <p>    So, fol­lo­wing her fall from gra­ce, she had ap­pli­ed her­self to the bu­si­ness of ra­ising and tra­ining very spe­ci­al sla­ves, ex­qu­isi­te cre­atu­res much in de­mand for the­ir be­a­uty and skills. The­re was al­ways a wa­iting-list for her pretty boys and de­co­ra­ti­ve men-she was an ex­pert, af­ter all, in the things that ma­de ma­les both or­na­men­tal and use­ful. The­re we­re plenty of El­ven­lords- Ael­mar­kin for one-who bred and tra­ined lo­vely fe­ma­le sla­ves for the lu­xury tra­de, but Tri­ana was the only sup­pli­er of ma­les for the sa­me pur­po­se. So­me we­re bo­ught by El­ven­lords, but not ne­arly as many as we­re bo­ught by the la­di­es-not that the lords the­se la­di­es ans­we­red to we­re ever ma­de awa­re of the exis­ten­ce of the­se spe­ci­al sla­ves. La­di­es might well be hed­ged abo­ut by ru­le and cus­tom and kept clo­se in the ha­rem-but not­hing pre­ven­ted the vi­sits of anot­her Lady.</p>
   <p>    Triana, say, with a small en­to­ura­ge of her spe­ci­al sla­ves.</p>
   <p>    Now, on­ce Tri­ana and her sla­ves we­re wit­hin the walls of an es­ta­te, it was child's play for the lady she vi­si­ted to purc­ha­se one or mo­re; un­less she was to­tal­ly hed­ged abo­ut, she had simply to or­der that the re­qu­isi­te pri­ce be sent to Tri­ana's ste­ward by her own ho­use­hold ste­ward, who wo­uld not ga­in­say her. The sla­ves then va­nis­hed in­to the ho­use­hold, as­sig­ned to the lady's per­so­nal ser­vi­ce, ne­ver to be se­en-oh, most cer­ta­inly ne­ver!-by the mas­ter of the ho­use. It was easy eno­ugh to do, for even on es­ta­tes that bred the­ir own sla­ves the­re we­re al­ways mo­re be­ing purc­ha­sed-a spe­ci­al skill might be ne­eded, or the sla­ves them­sel­ves di­sob­li­ged by pre­sen­ting one with too many of one sex and not eno­ugh of the ot­her. The purc­ha­se of a gre­at many of the­se ma­le sla­ves that Tri­ana so ca­re­ful­ly tra­ined was con­ce­aled un­der the bland he­ading "ho­use­hold ex­pen­ses."</p>
   <p>    One of Tri­ana's own sla­ves, sle­ek in her li­very of dark sil­ver and mid­night, ca­me to the do­or of the cham­ber, and Tri­ana lo­oked up and nod­ded ack­now­ledg­ment of his si­lent sig­nal. A mo­ment la­ter, a se­cond ar­ri­ved, Ael­mar­kin in tow.</p>
   <p>    "V'kel Ael­mar­kin el-Lord Tor­nal, my Lady," he in­to­ned, as Ael­mar­kin sa­un­te­red past him in­to the of­fi­ce. Both sla­ves va­nis­hed as so­on as Tri­ana nod­ded to them.</p>
   <p>    "Aelmarkin, it is a ple­asu­re to see you," she sa­id, exu­ding sub­du­ed warmth. "For­gi­ve me for not ri­sing to gre­et you pro­perly, but as you see, you ha­ve ca­ught me in the midst of my lit­tle cho­res."</p>
   <p>    Now, Ael­mar­kin knew very well that she had got­ten amp­le eno­ugh war­ning of his im­mi­nent ar­ri­val to ha­ve set her "lit­tle cho­res" asi­de, and she knew that he knew and he knew that she knew that he knew, so they we­re most com­for­tab­le in the­ir mu­tu­al know­led­ge. He lo­oked the vi­si­tors' co­uch over be­fo­re sit­ting in it, and was pro­bably not surp­ri­sed to dis­co­ver what a di­sad­van­ta­ge it put him at.</p>
   <p>    "My cur­sed co­usin has co­ve­red him­self with glory," he grumb­led, as a sla­ve ap­pe­ared at the do­or, of­fe­red him wi­ne, and di­sap­pe­ared aga­in. "1 ho­pe you've be­en ma­king bet­ter prog­ress than I. It will be worth it to me to lo­se this bet if you can bring him down."</p>
   <p>    She smi­led enig­ma­ti­cal­ly. "You are awa­re that the key to all this is to eit­her get rid of his mot­her or en­co­ura­ge him to put her in her-approp­ri­ate-pla­ce?"</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin wasn't stu­pid; she had to grant him that. He sat up-or did so as much as the co­uch wo­uld al­low him. "So it's Lady Lydi­ell who ru­les that ro­ost, do­es she? I'd sus­pec­ted as much. That's hardly surp­ri­sing, gi­ven how long she has be­en the so­le aut­ho­rity on that es­ta­te." He lo­oked so­ur, and wo­uld probably ha­ve ad­ded his di­sap­pro­val of a lady as­su­ming such aut­ho­rity, but that was hardly po­li­tic in Tri­ana's pre­sen­ce.</p>
   <p>    "But it's high ti­me that Lord Kyrti­an as­su­med his pro­per ro­le as he­ad of the es­ta­te, I sho­uld think," Tri­ana rep­li­ed, ca­re­ful­ly exa­mi­ning her flaw­les­sly po­lis­hed na­ils. "And I ex­pect, af­ter all of his vic­to­ri­es in the fi­eld, he's not go­ing to be con­tent to sit back and let so­me­one el­se ma­na­ge his pro­perty any­mo­re."</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin re­la­xed back in his se­at and pro­du­ced a thin smi­le. "And the right wo­man co­uld-wo­uld!-cer­ta­inly en­co­ura­ge him in that di­rec­ti­on, wo­uldn't she? The only qu­es­ti­on in my mind is, to what ef­fect?" The smi­le har­de­ned. "It is not go­ing to ple­ase me par­ti­cu­larly to find that the mot­her has be­en sup­plan­ted by the equ­al­ly-com­pe­tent-wi­fe."</p>
   <p>    She left off exa­mi­ning her na­ils and ga­ve him a chill lo­ok. How very li­ke a ma­le to as­su­me that she in­ten­ded to ta­ke the mot­her's pla­ce! "I do as­su­re you, Ael­mar­kin, that wed­ding that child is no part of my plans. The­re is not­hing abo­ut his es­ta­tes or his per­son that co­uld tempt me to the folly of put­ting my es­ta­tes and my per­son in­to his le­gal cont­rol."</p>
   <p>    "See that you re­ma­in of that mind," Ael­mar­kin res­pon­ded shortly. The­re was no mis­ta­ke; he fully ex­pec­ted her to be that fo­olish! Did he think that every fe­ma­le in exis­ten­ce li­ved only to wed?</p>
   <p>    "The tho­ught wo­uld ne­ver ha­ve cros­sed my mind, and is no part of my plans." She al­lo­wed a tin­ge of con­tempt to co­lor her ga­ze. "Did you co­me all this way to fen­ce with me, or ha­ve you anot­her pur­po­se you ha­ven't yet re­ve­aled?"</p>
   <p>    He had co­me to dis­co­ver what, if anyt­hing, she knew or had do­ne, of co­ur­se-but she sus­pec­ted that- he had al­so co­me to ke­ep an eye on her. Of co­ur­se he had be­gun to think her plans might inc­lu­de wed­ding Kyrti­an as well as se­du­cing him-he.was a ma­le, af­ter all, and he was blin­ded by the auto­ma­tic as­sump­ti­on that every fe­ma­le wan­ted ul­ti­ma­tely to be so­me­one's lady-as if the only pos­sib­le iden­tity a fe­ma­le had was thro­ugh her ma­le re­la­ti­ves.</p>
   <p>    Idiot.</p>
   <p>    But she co­uld use him. This lit­tle exer­ci­se that had be­gun as a bet had ta­ken on a li­fe and a pur­po­se for her far be­yond its original. No, she did not want Kyrti­an or his es­ta­tes-but she did want that se­at on the Co­un­cil that had be­en de­ni­ed her for so long. She wan­ted to be co­un­ted as the equ­al of any Gre­at Lord. She knew-how not?-that Lord Kyndreth only in­ten­ded to sup­port Kyrti­an for as long as it to­ok to dest­roy the Yo­ung Lords' Re­volt and pos­sibly the Wi­zards. On­ce that was over, Kyrti­an had the po­ten­ti­al to be­co­me a dan­ge­ro­us ri­val for Lord Kyndreth's as­cen­dancy in the Co­un­cil. He wo­uld be al­to­get­her ple­ased to find so­me­one wil­ling to help and pla­ced to eli­mi­na­te Kyrti­an when the ti­me ca­me. Not by as­sas­si­na­ti­on, no-that was too cru­de, and be­si­des, the­re was the small prob­lem of get­ting away with mur­der on­ce it had be­en com­mit­ted. That al­to­get­her-too-effi­ci­ent body­gu­ard of Kyrti­an's was anot­her prob­lem.</p>
   <p>    But eli­mi­na­ti­on by ot­her me­ans-that was anot­her co­vey of qu­a­il al­to­get­her. On­ce Tri­ana was clo­se to Kyrti­an, trus­ted by him, the­re we­re any num­ber of op­ti­ons open to her. She co­uld ar­ran­ge for him to do so­met­hing that wo­uld disg­ra­ce him en­ti­rely-so­met­hing to do with sla­ves, per­haps. He tre­ated that body­gu­ard with sus­pi­ci­o­us soft­ness, and Lydi­ell's fa­mily was known for its ri­di­cu­lo­us cos­se­ting of hu­mans. Per­haps so­met­hing co­uld be con­coc­ted lin­king him to the Wi­zards as a sympat­hi­zer. Or if no­ne of that se­emed pos­sib­le, a fe­ma­le, al­lo­wed clo­ser than any ma­le, co­uld do things that we­re not open to men. She co­uld ad­mi­nis­ter drugs that wo­uld en­fe­eb­le mind or body, but gra­du­al­ly-and most im­por­tant of all, ir­re­ver­sibly. She co­uld le­ak im­por­tant fi­nan­ci­al or ot­her de­ta­ils of the es­ta­te that wo­uld al­low so­me­one li­ke Kyndreth to work the ma­gic that wo­uld ru­in it-its ma­in so­ur­ce of in­co­me lay in fo­ods­tuf­fs, af­ter all, and pro­perly ma­ni­pu­la­ted we­at­her or in­sect-pla­gu­es for se­ve­ral ye­ars in a row co­uld bring the fa­mily to its kne­es. She co­uld and wo­uld en­co­ura­ge in­fa­tu­ati­on on Kyrti­an's part, along with the gi­ving of very ex­pen­si­ve gifts and reck­less be­ha­vi­or to imp­ress her. It was pos­sib­le that she co­uld ar­ran­ge him to bank­rupt him­self, in ga­mes of chan­ce and the li­ke-or to bre­ak his own neck in sport and the hunt.</p>
   <p>    Or, even, to emu­la­te his fat­her and va­nish in­to the wil­der­ness, ne­ver to be se­en aga­in. That, in par­ti­cu­lar, ap­pe­aled to her.</p>
   <p>    Encouraging him in that di­rec­ti­on had gre­at po­ten­ti­al, and sho­uldn't be all that dif­fi­cult. The wil­der­ness had kil­led the fat­her, so why not the son?</p>
   <p>    There we­re so many op­ti­ons open to her, on­ce she got clo­se to Kyrti­an, that she had no in­ten­ti­on of li­mi­ting her­self to any one plan for the mo­ment.</p>
   <p>    Meanwhile, it was ac­tu­al­ly pos­sib­le for Ael­mar­kin to pro­ve use­ful.</p>
   <p>    "If you wo­uld ca­re to stay for a vi­sit, I think we can ac­com­mo­da­te you," she sa­id, smi­ling, and surp­ri­sing him. "Ha­ve you co­me pre­pa­red to re­ma­in?"</p>
   <p>    She knew he had, of co­ur­se; alt­ho­ugh she might not know the con­tents of his bag­ga­ge, she cer­ta­inly knew the we­ight and vo­lu­me. He'd bro­ught a cart-full and only two per­so­nal sla­ves, so he'd be­en in­ten­ding to inf­lict him­self on her for a go­od fort­night at le­ast.</p>
   <p>    "I con­fess I was ho­ping that you wo­uld ten­der the in­vi­ta­ti­on," he rep­li­ed ca­uti­o­usly. Cle­arly he had ho­ped to trick or bully her in­to the in­vi­ta­ti­on, and had not tho­ught for a mo­ment that it wo­uld be of­fe­red fre­ely.</p>
   <p>    "Then why don't you set­tle in," she sa­id airily, wa­ving a hand at the do­or, whe­re at her in­vi­sib­le sig­nal, the sla­ve who had bro­ught him he­re ar­ri­ved, ha­ving res­pon­ded to that sum­mons. "I'll de­al with my lit­tle ho­use­hold af­fa­irs, and we can dis­cuss plans over lunc­he­on."</p>
   <p>    She kept in­vi­sib­le her amu­se­ment at his strug­gles to ext­ri­ca­te him­self from the co­uch, and res­pon­ded to his no­ne-too-gra­ci­o­us bow with a nod of her he­ad. As he ac­com­pa­ni­ed the sla­ve to the gu­est qu­ar­ters she went back to her ac­co­unts. Whi­le not of spel­lbin­ding in­te­rest, they we­re im­por­tant af­ter all, and ne­eded to be at­ten­ded to. The­se days she didn't trust that anyt­hing had be­en do­ne pro­perly un­less she her­self had run a cri­ti­cal eye over it.</p>
   <p>    Now-luncheon was cer­ta­inly go­ing to be in­te­res­ting. She was qu­ite lo­oking for­ward to it, af­ter all.</p>
   <p>    She co­un­ted on the fact that she had wel­co­med Ael­mar­kin, and that the­re wasn't a gre­at de­al for him to amu­se him­self with on her es­ta­te, to en­su­re that as so­on as he had con­vin­ced him­self that she wasn't pla­ying a de­eper ga­me than he tho­ught, he wo­uld le­ave.</p>
   <p>    And, in fact, that was pre­ci­sely what hap­pe­ned. Alt­ho­ugh he had cle­arly co­me pre­pa­red to re­ma­in for a we­ek or mo­re, wit­hin three days he was go­ne.</p>
   <p>    She had spe­eded his de­par­tu­re by be­ing ri­di­cu­lo­usly vir­tu­o­us for the du­ra­ti­on of his vi­sit. She held no par­ti­es, en­ter­ta­ined no ot­her gu­ests, and alt­ho­ugh he did ha­ve ac­cess to so­me at­trac­ti­ve fe­ma­le sla­ves she ma­de it po­li­tely cle­ar that if he da­ma­ged them, he co­uld con­si­der them purc­ha­ses. His fi­nan­ces we­re not so se­cu­re that he co­uld con­temp­la­te the purc­ha­se of one of her sla­ves at the uxo­ri­o­us va­lu­ati­on she wo­uld ma­ke, that pretty much put pa­id to that pos­sib­le amu­se­ment.</p>
   <p>    That left hun­ting (which he de­tes­ted), lands­ca­pe-vi­ewing (which bo­red him), and ga­ming (which he was ill-equ­ip­ped for, eit­her men­tal­ly or physi­cal­ly-nor wo­uld he ha­ve enj­oyed ei-~ ther lo­sing to a hu­man sla­ve or win­ning over one who was al­lo­wing him to win. No in­de­ed.</p>
   <p>    So, off he went, li­be­ra­ting her from his un­wel­co­me com­pany and al­lo­wing her the fre­edom to find out just what Kyrti­an was up to.</p>
   <p>    That me­ant a se­lect din­ner-party. Not one of the li­ber­ti­ne af­fa­irs that she threw for tho­se of the Yo­ung Lords who we­re still lo­yal to the­ir fat­hers, but a se­da­te, yet very lu­xu­ri­o­us din­ner for tho­se few of the Gre­at Lords who fo­und her amu­sing and co­uld af­ford to be se­en with her.</p>
   <p>    Which inc­lu­ded, of co­ur­se, Lord Kyndreth.</p>
   <p>    First, she spent a pro­fi­tab­le ho­ur in the kitc­hens, in­for­ming the staff of her plans and ter­rif­ying them with ca­su­al­ly drop­ped ta­les of what had hap­pe­ned to sla­ves who­se fo­od and ser­vi­ce disp­le­ased the Gre­at Lords who wo­uld be her gu­ests. Of co­ur­se, one thing that se­pa­ra­ted her es­tab­lish­ment from that of ot­her El­ven­lords was that her me­als re­li­ed on the skills of her kitc­hen-sla­ves and not on il­lu­si­on-now her ser­vants wo­uld exert them­sel­ves to the ut­most to ple­ase.</p>
   <p>    She did not tro­ub­le her­self abo­ut the me­nu; her chi­ef co­ok wo­uld de­ter­mi­ne that. He knew what was best, fres­hest, at its peak of ri­pe­ness; he knew what fowl, fish, and me­ats we­re at per­fec­ti­on. She co­uld le­ave all that to him, and set abo­ut de­li­ve­ring the in­vi­ta­ti­ons via te­le­son to her se­lect Gre­at Lords-six of them al­to­get­her, inc­lu­ding Lord Kyndreth and his son Gil­dor. Gil­dor was a bo­re, but she wo­uld see that his simp­le ne­eds we­re ta­ken ca­re of.</p>
   <p>    All ma­le, of co­ur­se; the­re wo­uld be one fe­ma­le, but only a hu­man sla­ve, Gil­dor's fa­vo­ri­te con­cu­bi­ne. He was ab­surdly fa­ith­ful to the cre­atu­re, but when Lord Kyndreth is­su­ed a de­li­ca­te hint that Gil­dor wo­uld pro­bably want to bring her, she la­ug­hed lightly.</p>
   <p>    "Children must ha­ve the­ir toys, mustn't they?" she sa­id, with just a hint of moc­kery. "No mat­ter, my lord. I shall supply the rest of you with co­mely com­pa­ni­ons, so she will not be cons­pi­cu­o­us. I may not spe­ci­ali­ze in such sla­ves, but I pro­mi­se that you will be con­ten­ted with what I supply."</p>
   <p>    "That will su­it me very well," Lord Kyndreth rep­li­ed, from the depths of the te­le­son em­bed­ded in the wall ac­ross from her desk, which was nor­mal­ly hid­den be­hind the dra­pe­ri­es the­re. He se­emed just as amu­sed by his of­fsp­ring's dog­ged in­fa­tu­ati­on as Tri­ana was. "Yo­ur hos­pi­ta­lity will be gra­ci­o­us, as al­ways."</p>
   <p>    "Then I can ex­pect you to­mor­row night." She smi­led at him, exer­ting all her charm. "Go­od. You still ha­ve my te­le­son-key I as­su­me?"</p>
   <p>    "I ne­ver let it out of my ke­eping," he as­su­red her, as all of the ot­hers had. "Till to­mor­row night, then?"</p>
   <p>    "Till to­mor­row night." She al­lo­wed him to bre­ak the con­nec­ti­on, and sat back in her cha­ir, well-con­tent for just a mo­ment.</p>
   <p>    But only for a mo­ment, for she had a de­ci­si­on to ma­ke. Sho­uld she disp­lay her ex­per­ti­se in ma­gic, by cre­ating a fan­tas­ti­cal set­ting for her party, or dis­tin­gu­ish her­self by hos­ting the din­ner with no ma­gic what­so­ever?</p>
   <p>    With ma­gic, she de­ci­ded af­ter long con­si­de­ra­ti­on. But it must be subt­le. The­se men we­re ex­perts in po­wer­ful ma­gic, and it wo­uld be far mo­re imp­res­si­ve to ca­ress them with sur­ro­un­dings that had a calm depth than to bom­bard them with-say-an enc­han­ted ex­hi­bi­ti­on of song and dan­ce.</p>
   <p>    Subtlety wo­uld ta­ke ti­me to pro­du­ce; she had bet­ter start on it now.</p>
   <p>    She let the cha­ir gli­de back on its ra­ils, and to­ok her­self to her di­ning ro­om, wal­king aro­und it to study every ang­le.</p>
   <p>    Should she at­tempt an il­lu­si­on of spa­ce, or cre­ate an at­mosp­he­re of in­ti­ma­te enc­lo­su­re?</p>
   <p>    The aura of in­ti­macy wo­uld be bet­ter for her pur­po­ses.</p>
   <p>    She cal­led in her ser­vants, and set them to re­mo­ving the di­ning tab­le and cha­irs from her last party and rep­la­cing them with two-per­son di­ning co­uc­hes with at­ten­dant tab­les. By the ti­me they re­tur­ned with the moss-gre­en, vel­vety dra­pes she wan­ted for the co­uc­hes, she had de­ci­ded on the the­me.</p>
   <p>    Overhead, stars. As a backd­rop, moss-co­ve­red sto­nes, as if this pla­ce was a de­ep and nar­row, sec­ret val­ley. Slowly, arid with gre­at ca­re, Tri­ana bu­ilt up the il­lu­si­on as she sat on one of the co­uc­hes, spin­ning it out of air and energy. She pla­ced, and re-pla­ced each sto­ne, each gra­ce­ful tree, each tiny vi­olet, un­til she was sa­tis­fi­ed with the ba­lan­ce and har­mony. Tend­rils of energy for­med in­to branc­hes and dis­sol­ved aga­in un­til she was happy with the ef­fect.</p>
   <p>    A wa­ter­fall? No. Ever­yo­ne had wa­ter­fal­ls la­tely; they'd be­en do­ne to de­ath. Ins­te­ad, she si­mu­la­ted the calls of frogs and cric­kets, and a sing­le nigh­tin­ga­le.</p>
   <p>    She cal­led for ref­resh­ments and re­al tre­es in tubs that wo­uld be mas­ked with dra­ped vi­nes, su­per­vi­sing the sla­ves as they mo­ved the re­al tre­es in­to po­si­ti­on aro­und the six co­uc­hes. It was al­re­ady past sun­down, but her gu­ests wo­uld ar­ri­ve well be­fo­re din­ner to­mor­row, and she must ha­ve the di­ning ro­om re­ady long be­fo­re then.</p>
   <p>    She over­la­id an il­lu­si­on of moss on the car­pet, vi­su­al only, as the car­pet it­self was soft eno­ugh to the tre­ad to ple­ase. That left only scent-easily ta­ken ca­re of with no il­lu­si­on at all. She left or­ders for gar­lands of flo­wers and le­aves to be dra­ped bet­we­en the tub­bed tre­es and wre­at­hed aro­und the co­uc­hes.</p>
   <p>    She sat down on one of the co­uc­hes and sur­ve­yed her work with a cri­ti­cal eye, ma­king mi­nu­te chan­ges he­re and the­re so that the grot­to ap­pe­ared ran­dom, en­ti­rely na­tu­ral. Even the sky overhead was a cle­ver va­ri­ati­on; she had ke­yed the stars to fol­low the mo­ve­ments of the re­al sky. By the ti­me she dec­la­red her­self fi­nis­hed, she was ex­ha­us­ted with the unac­cus­to­med la­bor. But it wo­uld all be worth it, to­mor­row.</p>
   <p>    Triana sur­ve­yed her gu­ests and smi­led openly. Gil­dor and his fa­vo­ri­te con­cu­bi­ne we­re ins­tal­led on the most pri­va­te of the co­uc­hes, at the re­ar of the grot­to. Gil­dor cle­arly con­si­de­red this to be a fa­vor, not an in­sult-and so, evi­dently, did his fat­her.</p>
   <p>    Each of the ot­her fi­ve gu­ests sha­red his co­uch with an at­trac­ti­ve fe­ma­le sla­ve, too, but the­se men we­re all po­wer­ful and pro­bably had con­cu­bi­nes that ma­de the­se girls lo­ok li­ke fi­eld-sla­ves. For them the­se sla­ves we­re not­hing mo­re than sen­ti­ent fur­ni­tu­re that ser­ved them si­lently wit­ho­ut ne­eding di­rec­ti­on- ple­asant ac­co­ut­re­ments, which de­monst­ra­ted the tho­ro­ugh­ness and tho­ught­ful­ness of the­ir hos­tess, but not­hing mo­re. They ate and tal­ked as if the girls we­ren't even the­re. And the girls had be­en well-scho­oled, if not gi­ven the kind of in­ten­si­ve tra­ining that Tri­ana la­vis­hed on her ma­le sla­ves; they ac­ted on the ne­eds of the­ir tem­po­rary mas­ters be­fo­re tho­se mas­ters even knew they had a ne­ed. Cups we­re re­fil­led af­ter a sing­le sip, pla­tes rep­la­ced with ones fil­led with new da­in­ti­es the mo­ment the hot fo­ods be­gan to co­ol or the co­ol ones to warm.</p>
   <p>    Triana her­self had no com­pa­ni­on, and ate very lit­tle. Her gu­ests had lo­ose­ned up eno­ugh to be­gin to spe­ak of Co­un­cil bu­si­ness, and she wa­ited for the su­bj­ect of Lord Kyrti­an to co­me up, as Gil­dor dal­li­ed with his con­cu­bi­ne, comp­le­tely ob­li­vi­o­us to his el­ders.</p>
   <p>    It was Lord Kyndreth who bro­ac­hed the su­bj­ect, la­unc­hing in­to a desc­rip­ti­on of the af­ter­math of the cli­mac­tic bat­tle that ro­uted the Yo­ung Lords.</p>
   <p>    "So whe­re are the wretc­hes?" as­ked Lord Wend­re­lith, his brow wrink­led with sup­pres­sed an­ger. "All that's be­en cap­tu­red are sla­ves."</p>
   <p>    "Scattered li­ke flus­hed qu­a­il-but un­li­ke qu­a­il, they aren't re­gat­he­ring," Lord Kyndreth rep­li­ed. "I sus­pect that they've each con­coc­ted bolt-ho­les du­ring the ti­me they we­re hol­ding us off, and now they've go­ne to gro­und. How much ti­me and ef­fort are you wil­ling to spend in trac­king them to the­ir la­irs?"</p>
   <p>    "Not ne­arly as much as it will ta­ke, I sus­pect," sa­id Lord Van-dri­en dryly.</p>
   <p>    "It will be a mas­si­ve ef­fort," Lord Kyndreth ag­re­ed. "Every trac­king te­am will ha­ve to ha­ve a lord with it-one who­se lo­yalty is un­qu­es­ti­oned and can­not be sub­ver­ted. Hu­man sla­ves can be de­ce­ived or cor­rup­ted."</p>
   <p>    Lord Wend­re­lith sho­ok his he­ad in dis­gust. "Ances­tors! We'd eit­her ha­ve to track them down one at a ti­me-"</p>
   <p>    "Which wo­uld ta­ke fo­re­ver, even by our stan­dards-" Tri­ana in­te­rj­ec­ted softly.</p>
   <p>    "-or strip our es­ta­tes of su­per­vi­sors. Ne­it­her is a vi­ab­le op­ti­on," Kyndreth sa­id, nod­ding.</p>
   <p>    Triana, se­e­ing that she had not be­en re­buf­fed, put in anot­her of her ob­ser­va­ti­ons. "Aren't they now craf­ting the­ir own pu­nish­ment?"</p>
   <p>    Another of the Gre­at Lords tur­ned his full at­ten­ti­on to Tri­ana. "That is a very in­te­res­ting idea, my Lady," Lord Aren­ti­el-lan sa­id, with an in­ten­sely alert exp­res­si­on in his eyes. "Co­uld you ela­bo­ra­te?"</p>
   <p>    "They can­not ha­ve mo­re than one or two sla­ves api­ece; they da­re not col­lect in gro­ups of mo­re than three. They will not ha­ve anyt­hing that we think of as de­cent ho­using-not so much as a hun­ting lod­ge. They are li­kely to be li­ving in ca­ves or ot­her cru­de shel­ters. No­ne of them are truly po­wer­ful ma­gi­ci­ans; if they wish to eat, they must ste­al, hunt, gat­her-with the­ir own hands and tho­se of the one or two sla­ves they still re­ta­in." She la­ug­hed, in a vo­ice low and husky. "It is en­ti­rely pos­sib­le that many of them are out the­re, bur­ning the­ir din­ners over smo­king fi­res, only to shi­ver thro­ugh the night in scant shel­ter, even as we spe­ak." She smi­led swe­etly. "I can­not ima­gi­ne a pu­nish­ment wor­se than that-li­ving li­ke a wild hu­man, and kno­wing that the only way to rec­tify the si­tu­ati­on is to co­me gro­ve­ling back to us."</p>
   <p>    All fi­ve of the Gre­at Lords sta­red at her for a long ti­me; then Lord Kyndreth bro­ke out in unex­pec­tedly lo­ud la­ugh­ter, in which he was jo­ined by the rest. Gil­dor lo­oked up at them for a mo­ment wit­ho­ut in­te­rest, then went back to his con­cu­bi­ne.</p>
   <p>    "By the An­ces­tors, my Lady, I think you ha­ve the right of it!" sa­id Lord Aren­ti­el­lan with ad­mi­ra­ti­on. "My mi­se­rab­le brat is cer­ta­inly wel­co­me to all the bur­ned rab­bit and ra­in he can stand."</p>
   <p>    "What of the army, Kyndreth?" as­ked Vand­ri­en. "If it we­re up to me, I'd dis­band them."</p>
   <p>    To Tri­ana's ve­iled joy, the rest mur­mu­red ag­re­ement.</p>
   <p>    "It's up to the full Co­un­cil, of co­ur­se," Kyndreth de­mur­red. "And the­re are the Wi­zards to think of."</p>
   <p>    "True…" Vand­ri­en mu­sed.</p>
   <p>    "Who we will, ine­vi­tably, out­li­ve," Tri­ana po­in­ted out qu­i­etly. "With half the­ir blo­od co­ming from sla­ve-stock, I can­not see that they wo­uld ha­ve our ye­ars. With no mo­re of the full blo­od, they will di­lu­te the­ir stock to the po­int that they are no mo­re long-li­ved than me­re sla­ves. As­su­ming that they don't kill each ot­her off in the­ir own qu­ar­rels."</p>
   <p>    "Once aga­in, my Lady, you surp­ri­se and de­light me." Lord Vand­ri­en sat up eno­ugh to gi­ve her the full bow of res­pect. "I am in yo­ur debt for such re­aso­ned ob­ser­va­ti­ons."</p>
   <p>    "Thank you." She lo­we­red her ga­ze mo­destly.</p>
   <p>    "Still, the Wi­zards… the qu­es­ti­on is, whet­her it is pos­sib­le that they co­uld po­se a thre­at to us, simply by exis­ting and ser­ving as a temp­ta­ti­on to the sla­ves to re­volt." Kyndreth ra­ised an eyeb­row. "After all, our own of­fsp­ring did."</p>
   <p>    "And sla­ves wo­uld ha­ve no dif­fi­culty with the no­ti­on of- of-li­ving li­ke wild hu­mans." Aren­ti­el­lan nod­ded. "Still, I don't know-"</p>
   <p>    "If you dis­ban­ded the army, the­re is a qu­es­ti­on of what Lord Kyrti­an wo­uld do with him­self," Tri­ana sug­ges­ted gently.</p>
   <p>    "If you ask me, he ought to be on the Co­un­cil!" Aren­ti­el­lan sa­id im­me­di­ately-but Tri­ana saw Lord Kyndreth exc­han­ge a po­in­ted glan­ce with one of the ot­hers. She stro­ve to catch his eye, and nod­ded slightly.</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth lo­oked surp­ri­sed, then spe­cu­la­ti­ve, then re­tur­ned her nod.</p>
   <p>    She le­aned back in­to her co­uch, se­cu­re in the cer­ta­inty that her mes­sa­ge had be­en re­ad and un­ders­to­od.</p>
   <p>    When the last ho­ne­yed gra­pe had be­en eaten, and the last ple­asantry exc­han­ged, the Gre­at Lords to­ok the­ir le­ave of the­ir hos­tess, one by one. Lord Kyndreth sent his son and the con­cu­bi­ne back thro­ugh the Por­tal and ma­de as if to fol­low, but fo­und a sud­den ex­cu­se to re­ma­in un­til all of the ot­hers had left but him­self. Tri­ana had ac­com­pa­ni­ed them to the Por­tal her­self to bid them a po­li­te fa­re­well, and now fo­und her­self, as she had ho­ped, alo­ne with the Gre­at Lord.</p>
   <p>    "So, my lady," Kyndreth sa­id, when the last ha­ze of energy had di­ed from the Por­tal mo­uth. "You se­em to ha­ve so­me no­ti­ons abo­ut Lord Kyrti­an."</p>
   <p>    "You are co­ming to the po­int with unac­cus­to­med ab­rupt­ness, if I may say so, Lord Kyndreth," Tri­ana de­mur­red.</p>
   <p>    "I am-so­mew­hat con­cer­ned abo­ut Lord Kyrti­an," the Gre­at Lord rep­li­ed, shif­ting his we­ight rest­les­sly from his left fo­ot to his right. "I may ha­ve awa­ke­ned sle­eping am­bi­ti­on in him, and if now he finds no out­let for it, he may be-dist­res­sed."</p>
   <p>    "He may use his new-won re­pu­ta­ti­on wit­hin the Co­un­cil to the di­sad­van­ta­ge of ot­hers," Tri­ana re­tor­ted, co­ming to the po­int just as di­rectly as Lord Kyndreth had. "The stra­te­gi­es of war and po­li­tics are not una­li­ke. On the ot­her hand-"</p>
   <p>    "Yes?" Kyndreth promp­ted.</p>
   <p>    "His ener­gi­es co­uld be tur­ned el­sew­he­re, by so­me­one who is cle­ver eno­ugh to de­vi­se a chan­nel for them." She lo­oked up at him from be­ne­ath her long las­hes, and smi­led.</p>
   <p>    "And what wo­uld this dist­rac­ti­on cost me, if I may ask, my lady?" Kyndreth was was­ting no ti­me; it oc­cur­red to Tri­ana that he might be mo­re wor­ri­ed abo­ut Kyrti­an's am­bi­ti­ons than she had tho­ught.</p>
   <p>    She de­ci­ded to risk all on a sing­le throw of the di­ce. "The Co­un­cil Se­at on­ce held by my fat­her."</p>
   <p>    His mo­uth pur­sed, but he didn't lo­ok as if he par­ti­cu­larly obj­ec­ted to the no­ti­on. "It co­uld be do­ne… the­re ha­ve be­en fe­ma­les on the Co­un­cil be­fo­re now."</p>
   <p>    But he hadn't com­mit­ted to the bar­ga­in eit­her. "The sa­me clever per­son who fo­und one out­let for his ener­gi­es co­uld turn them back to a mo­re-unfor­tu­na­te-di­rec­ti­on, if bar­ga­ins ma­de are not kept."</p>
   <p>    Now he smi­led, wryly. "You ha­ve a way with words, my lady. The bar­ga­in will be kept-and I be­li­eve that you will find our yo­ung Com­man­der at the es­ta­te of his Aunt, the Lady Mort­he­na."</p>
   <p>    She smi­led ra­di­antly at him. "Thank you, my lord. That is all I ne­ed."</p>
   <p>    He ga­ve her a full co­urt bow. "And all I re­qu­ire, as well." He step­ped to­wards the Por­tal, which be­gan to glow with energy in res­pon­se to his pro­xi­mity. Then he pa­used on the thres­hold, to lo­ok back over his sho­ul­der at her. "Go­od hun­ting, my Lady," he sa­id.</p>
   <p>    "And to you, my lord-" she rep­li­ed. And he was go­ne.</p>

   <p>    Shana hadn't se­en Kel­yan and Hal­dor in ages-and she wo­uld ha­ve be­en hard-pres­sed to re­cog­ni­ze them now. Re­na had be­en right to ta­ke ac­ti­on; per­haps the chan­ge in the two "yo­ung" El­ven­lords had be­en so gra­du­al that it had pas­sed re­la­ti­vely un­no­ti­ced by the pe­op­le who saw them every day, but to Sha­na's eyes the chan­ge was so­met­hing of a shock. El­ven­lords we­re ra­rely "ro­bust" by hu­man or halfb­lo­od stan­dards, but Kel­yan and Hal­dor we­re wra­ith-thin, bo­nes sho­wing thro­ugh skin go­ne qu­ite trans­lu­cent. The­ir sil­ver-gilt ha­ir was lank and brit­tle, and they bru­ised badly and easily. The dra­gons had bro­ught them to the Ci­ta­del in a stu­por in­du­ced by Me­ro; af­ter wa­king them only eno­ugh to stuff them full of fo­od and drink and cle­an them up af­ter the­ir jo­ur­ney, Sha­na had put them back to sle­ep aga­in.</p>
   <p>    Two el­ven cap­ti­ves sum­ma­rily dum­ped on the­ir do­ors­tep- one mo­re prob­lem to try and fix.</p>
   <p>    This ti­me she was at a loss; this was not her area of ex­per­ti­se! If it hadn't be­en for Lorryn co­ming in and vo­lun­te­ering to find a gro­up to help her with them, she wo­uldn't ha­ve known whe­re to start.</p>
   <p>    Now Sha­na and the gro­up of yo­ung wi­zards Lorryn had cal­led to­get­her sta­red down at the­ir pa­ir of cap­ti­ves as they slept in a ma­gic-indu­ced fog, il­lu­mi­na­ted by a pa­ir of ma­ge-lights. And it wasn't just wi­zards that Lorryn had as­ked for help, eit­her; the gro­up inc­lu­ded so­me of the stron­gest of the hu­man ma­ges that Sha­na had ever met as well.</p>
   <p>    I wo­uldn 't ha­ve tho­ught of that-stu­pid of me. Hu­mans are the ones with the ma­gic that works on tho­ughts. The­re we­re se­ve­ral of them now, li­ving among the Wi­zards, drawn down out of the hills by the pro­mi­se of a pla­ce whe­re they co­uld li­ve wit­ho­ut fe­ar of be­ing cap­tu­red by el­ven-led sla­ve-hun­ting ex­pe­di­ti­ons. They sta­yed be­ca­use Ca­el­lach had be­en very qu­i­et ever sin­ce he had be­en de­fe­ated in the war of words with Sha­na. She was not al­to­get­her cer­ta­in just how long he wo­uld re­ma­in qu­i­et, but for now she was go­ing to ta­ke the gift and not worry abo­ut him.</p>
   <p>    One of the­se hu­man ma­gi­ci­ans was a mid­dle-aged man cal­led Narshy, who­se abi­lity to cre­ate il­lu­si­ons wit­hin the minds of tho­se who we­re not adept at the Iron Pe­op­les' mind-wall tech­ni­que was not­hing short of bog­gling. It was he, evi­dently, that Lorryn had first tho­ught of when Me­ro had first sug­ges­ted that the Wi­zards ta­ke over whe­re Me­ro and Re­na had be­en for­ced to le­ave off. Narshy co­uld so­me­ti­mes even get past the mind-wall-and be­ca­use of that, Sha­na con­si­de­red it a go­od thing he was on the­ir si­de.</p>
   <p>    It ma­de Sha­na won­der-be­fo­re she dis­mis­sed the idea, ap­pal­led that she'd even con­si­de­red it-if Narshy co­uld be used to ma­ni­pu­la­te Ca­el­lach Gwa­in. A ba­se and im­mo­ral idea-but oh, so temp­ting! It had ta­ken a dis­tinct ef­fort of will to put the idea firmly asi­de.</p>
   <p>    It was just a go­od thing that Ca­el­lach re­gar­ded the full humans with so much dis­da­in, tho­ugh. She wo­uldn't ha­ve put it past him to use the we­apon that she dis­car­ded as im­mo­ral.</p>
   <p>    For that mat­ter, was it im­mo­ral to be tin­ke­ring with the minds of the two El­ven­lords?</p>
   <p>    Probably. But they we­re al­re­ady mad. We 'd eit­her ha­ve to kill them or fix them in such a way that they can't eit­her bet­ray us or the Iron Pe­op­le. She was ca­ught bet­we­en two equ­al­ly dis­tas­te­ful so­lu­ti­ons-but had no re­al cho­ice, sin­ce Me­ro and Re­na had al­re­ady med­dled with the si­tu­ati­on past men­ding.</p>
   <p>    Both El­ven­lords lay on pal­lets in the mid­dle of a small, di­su­sed ro­om, with the­ir hu­man and halfb­lo­oded-"physi­ci­ans"- clus­te­red aro­und them. "Well, it sho­uldn't be too dif­fi­cult for ten or twenty of us to­get­her to con­coct wha­te­ver me­mo­ri­es of be­ing held you want us to," Narshy told Sha­na with such sup­re­me self-con­fi­den­ce that Sha­na felt a kind of grud­ging ad­mi­ra­ti­on. Whet­her he was right or wrong he­re, it wo­uld be ni­ce to be ab­le to fe­el, just on­ce, that sa­me sort of self-con­fi­den­ce. "With that many of us wor­king at on­ce, we can just-engra­ve the new me­mo­ri­es in pla­ce wit­hin a few days. So, whe­re do you want the­se two to ha­ve be­en held?"</p>
   <p>    "Umm-" she hadn't tho­ught that far, to tell the truth, but if she ad­mit­ted that, wo­uld she lo­se aut­ho­rity in the­ir eyes? They we­re all lo­oking at her as if they ex­pec­ted her to pre­sent them with everyt­hing they ne­eded, re­ady to go. "What abo­ut the old Ci­ta­del?" she sug­ges­ted, unab­le to think of anyt­hing mo­re cle­ver on such non-exis­tent no­ti­ce. "That way we won't ha­ve to ma­ke anyt­hing up-wo­uldn't re­al me­mo­ri­es be bet­ter than ones we con­coc­ted?"</p>
   <p>    "But the El­ven­lords know abo­ut the old Ci­ta­del," so­me­one pro­tes­ted. "Wo­uldn't they ha­ve fo­und the­se two?"</p>
   <p>    Before Sha­na co­uld ans­wer that, so­me­one el­se did it for her, with glee in the­ir vo­ice. "No! Be­ca­use we can use our me­mo­ri­es of the old Ci­ta­del, but we don't ha­ve to ha­ve them think that the pla­ce they we­re kept was the old Ci­ta­del. If we don't le­ave the­se two whe­re the old Ci­ta­del ac­tu­al­ly is, who­ever finds them will think that the­ir pri­son was so­mew­he­re ne­ar whe­re they we­re fo­und! Let the El­ven­lords think that the­re's anot­her hid­den Ci­ta­del so­mew­he­re."</p>
   <p>    "What abo­ut the fo­rest on the ed­ge of Lord Chey­nar's es­ta­te?" Lorryn sug­ges­ted, from the re­ar of the gro­up. "It's got a bad re­pu­ta­ti­on any­way. An­ces­tors only know what's in the­re; plenty of hun­ters ha­ve go­ne in and ne­ver co­me out aga­in. Chey-nar won't even send his own men in the­re af­ter es­ca­ped sla­ves any­mo­re."</p>
   <p>    "That's true eno­ugh," Sha­na sa­id tho­ught­ful­ly. "I re­mem­ber that Me­ro told me abo­ut so­me spo­oky sort of in­vi­sib­le thing that got his hor­se in the­re and ne­arly got him, when he and Va-lyn we­re es­ca­ping." She co­uldn't help it; she ca­ught her­self smi­ling grimly. The­re we­re plenty of things in tho­se hills that we­re mo­re than a match for El­ven­lords.</p>
   <p>    "Good eno­ugh," Narshy sa­id, ta­king the de­ci­si­on as ma­de. "That's what we'll do-the lot of you that li­ved in the old Ci­ta­del, let's pry so­me of tho­se me­mo­ri­es out of yo­ur skulls and get them sha­red aro­und so we can stuff the­se two full of them."</p>
   <p>    Shana was ple­ased and ama­zed at the way he ma­na­ged to ta­ke cont­rol of the lit­tle gro­up and herd them off to a cor­ner whe­re they co­uld work un­dis­tur­bed. With a sen­se of re­li­ef that was qu­ite pal­pab­le, she re­ali­zed that this ti­me, for on­ce, so­me­one el­se was go­ing to ta­ke ca­re of a prob­lem.</p>
   <p>    Unbelievable. "Whe­re did you find him?" she as­ked Lorryn. "He acts as if he's be­en in char­ge of pe­op­le, ma­ges even, be­fo­re this-"</p>
   <p>    "He has be­en-that's why I as­ked him to ta­ke char­ge of this gro­up of yo­urs," Lorryn rep­li­ed, then sud­denly lo­oked an­xi­o­us. "You don't mind-I ho­pe-he­re I've go­ne and usur­ped yo­ur aut­ho­rity and now so has Narshy. Ple­ase tell me you aren't up­set!"</p>
   <p>    "Mind? I sho­uld think not!" She sho­ok her he­ad and smi­led, ti­redly. "I don't know how you just do this, find the right pe­op­le and get them to ta­ke over this or that job-I can't se­em to find the right way to get pe­op­le to think for them­sel­ves-or find the ones that can ta­ke the ini­ti­ati­ve on the­ir own." She bit her lip as the all-too-fa­mi­li­ar frust­ra­ti­on aro­se.</p>
   <p>    "Maybe it's be­ca­use you can't be­li­eve that you don't ha­ve to do everyt­hing," Lorryn sa­id gently. "That's all I do; I find the pe­op­le who are go­od at so­met­hing, I ask them to do the job-and I be­li­eve that they can. Then I get out of the way and let them do it, in the­ir own way, at the­ir own pa­ce."</p>
   <p>    There was no gra­ce­ful way to reply to that, and she just sat down on a sto­ne led­ge, fe­eling to­tal­ly ina­de­qu­ate and ut­terly def­la­ted. "I ne­ver wan­ted to be a le­ader," she sa­id, for­lornly. "If any­body had as­ked me, I co­uld ha­ve had the chan­ce to say no."</p>
   <p>    "I know." He sat down be­si­de her. "I'd rat­her you we­re free to do what you're go­od at; plan­ning, thin­king, co­ming up with so­lu­ti­ons. You're all bog­ged down with trying to get pe­op­le to see that yo­ur so­lu­ti­ons are sen­sib­le-or to co­me up with bet­ter ones. You spend half yo­ur ti­me trying to con­vin­ce pe­op­le, and the ot­her half trying to herd them in­to wor­king on the so­lu­ti­on rat­her than sit­ting aro­und and ar­gu­ing abo­ut it. I'd rat­her you -didn't ha­ve to worry abo­ut all that."</p>
   <p>    "So wo­uld I." Sud­denly she felt li­ke we­eping, and swal­lo­wed the lump in her thro­at, blin­king ra­pidly. "But-"</p>
   <p>    He in­ter­rup­ted her. "Wo­uld you trust me to ta­ke what you aren't go­od at off yo­ur pla­te?" he as­ked, lo­oking ear­nestly in­to her eyes. "I'm be­gin­ning to think that I am a le­ader, that it's in my na­tu­re-pe­op­le lis­ten to me, and I'm go­od at get­ting them to co­ope­ra­te. But wo­uld you trust me to do what I'm go­od at so that you can do what you're go­od at?"</p>
   <p>    It to­ok her a mo­ment to work out what he was get­ting at, and he pro­bably wasn't en­ti­rely cer­ta­in of it him­self. Wo­uld she put him in the po­si­ti­on that Ca­el­lach Gwa­in wan­ted so badly, trust him to carry out what she co­uld see we­re the right plans and de­ci­si­ons for her? Sho­uldn't she ha­ve so­me­one ol­der, so­me­one from the ori­gi­nal Wi­zards of the Ci­ta­del?</p>
   <p>    But ne­it­her De­ne­lor nor Parth Agon-who sho­uld ha­ve be­en the le­aders, and who Sha­na had ex­pec­ted wo­uld act as the le­aders-se­emed to be up to the job. Ins­te­ad they had be­en de­le­ga­ting mo­re and mo­re aut­ho­rity to her, re­gard­less of how she felt abo­ut it. De­ne­lor ne­ver had ca­red to stir him­self mo­re than he had to, af­ter all-she al­re­ady knew that his be­set­ting sin was sloth-and Parth-Parth, she sud­denly re­ali­zed, was old. How old, she didn't ac­tu­al­ly know, not in ye­ars-but on­ce they had got­ten set­tled he­re and it se­emed that she and her yo­ung wi­zards had the si­tuation well in hand, he'd star­ted ta­king a back se­at, let­ting her fight with Ca­el­lach and his cro­ni­es, wa­iting for her to ma­ke the de­ci­si­ons. From va­gue hints over the ye­ars, she re­ali­zed that he must be at le­ast a cen­tury old, and per­haps mo­re.</p>
   <p>    He's too old and ti­red to le­ad any­mo­re, es­pe­ci­al­ly now that the Wi­zards are do­ing things and not just hi­ding. He do­esn 't want the le­aders­hip po­si­ti­on eit­her. It's too much for him now.</p>
   <p>    Maybe that was the ca­se with De­ne­lor, too.</p>
   <p>    But co­uld she hand over that much aut­ho­rity to Lorryn? It wo­uld ma­ke her ter­ribly vul­ne­rab­le.</p>
   <p>    As vul­ne­rab­le as if he truly is my lo­ver, the way ever­yo­ne se­ems to think he is-and this is the sort of thing they'd ex­pect me to do, start ma­king him my-my-ru­ling con­sort. This will only ma­ke them mo­re cer­ta­in that we're lo­vers even tho­ugh we 're not-even tho­ugh I-</p>
   <p>    She flus­hed as that tho­ught ca­me, un­bid­den, and she must ha­ve for­got­ten to shi­eld it, for sud­denly he flus­hed, too. "I can't help what ot­her pe­op­le think," he sa­id, de­fen­si­vely. "I can't help it that we-that I-"</p>
   <p>    She flus­hed aga­in, fumb­led for words, and co­uldn't find any.</p>
   <p>    "This isn't a very ni­ce po­si­ti­on for you," he sa­id at last. "Even my own sis­ter thinks we're-you know. No mat­ter what we do, pe­op­le are go­ing to ma­ke up the­ir own minds abo­ut yo­ur per­so­nal li­fe and the­re's not­hing you can say or do that will chan­ge what they think. But that do­esn't ma­ke things easy for you, when the­re's not­hing go­ing on bet­we­en us."</p>
   <p>    "Nor for you," she ma­na­ged. "I me­an, he­re I've be­en dum­ping all the­se things on you, and pe­op­le are ma­king all the­se as­sump­ti­ons, and you aren't even get­ting-" Now her fa­ce red­de­ned so it felt as if she we­re inc­hes from a fi­re.</p>
   <p>    "Assumptions! I don't mind, but I'm not in the sa­me po­si­ti­on that you are. It's got to be in­to­le­rab­le for you!" he exc­la­imed. "I-Sha­na-I wish-"</p>
   <p>    Suddenly, everyt­hing fell be­a­uti­ful­ly in­to pla­ce, as if the bro­ken shards of a va­se flew back to­get­her aga­in be­fo­re her eyes. She knew what he wis­hed; he didn't ne­ed to say it, he was pro­j­ec­ting it so for­ce­ful­ly that he was al­most sho­uting the words in her he­ad. He wan­ted tho­se as­sump­ti­ons to be true, but he had be­en af­ra­id that if he tri­ed to push him­self on­to her, she wo­uld re­act by sen­ding him away. He-he lo­ved her. He re­al­ly did! And-</p>
   <p>    Fire and Ra­in! I fe­el the sa­me way!</p>
   <p>    Lorryn wasn't just a sup­por­ti­ve and cle­ver fri­end any­mo­re. It wasn't just his fri­ends­hip she ne­eded and wan­ted. How long had she be­en fe­eling this abo­ut him? When did she stop fe­eling me­re at­trac­ti­on, just enj­oying his com­pany, and sud­denly start ne­eding his pre­sen­ce the way she ne­eded to bre­at­he?</p>
   <p>    "I didn't-I don't want to for­ce you in­to anyt­hing," he was sa­ying, a lit­tle wildly. "I knew how you'd felt abo­ut Valyn and I didn't want you to think I tho­ught I co­uld rep­la­ce him! I wan­ted us to be fri­ends, re­al­ly go­od fri­ends, and I wan­ted it to be that we co­uld de­pend on each ot­her, and then af­ter a whi­le, when things star­ted to get cal­med down, and we had the le­isu­re to think abo­ut our­sel­ves we co­uld-I me­an I know that-I don't know-"</p>
   <p>    "Oh, hush," she sa­id, sud­denly full of a half-mad joy, and kis­sed him, put­ting everyt­hing she felt be­hind it just so she co­uld get it all past the wild ti­de of his fe­elings.</p>
   <p>    :oh: she he­ard in her mind.</p>
   <p>    And then, for so­me ti­me­less ti­me, the­re was no ro­om in eit­her of the­ir minds for words at all. Fi­nal­ly, for that one mo­ment, no mat­ter what wo­uld co­me af­ter, everyt­hing was per­fectly, comp­le­tely, right. And she knew that she co­uld trust Lorryn mo­re than she co­uld even trust her­self.</p>
   <p>    "This isn't exactly the cho­icest spot-" he sa­id, fi­nal­ly, in­to her ha­ir. "We're rat­her out in pub­lic, not to men­ti­on our audi­en­ce."</p>
   <p>    "I sup­po­se they co­uld wa­ke up." Sha­na sig­hed and re­luc­tantly bro­ke the emb­ra­ce.</p>
   <p>    She smo­ot­hed down her ha­ir, self-cons­ci­o­usly. He brus­hed a strand or two out of her eyes and tuc­ked it be­hind her ear for her. "Ha­ve you any ti­me to spa­re?" he as­ked wist­ful­ly.</p>
   <p>    No-there's this, and the for­ges, and the sla­ve-col­lars, and the de­fen­ses and-</p>
   <p>    "I'll ma­ke so­me," she rep­li­ed.</p>
   <p>    The irony of the si­tu­ati­on was that the only pe­op­le af­fec­ted by this sea-chan­ge in the­ir re­la­ti­ons­hip we­re Lorryn and Sha­na them­sel­ves. But oh, the dif­fe­ren­ce for them!</p>
   <p>    No one se­emed to ha­ve no­ti­ced that Lorryn's qu­ar­ters had be­en strip­ped and con­ver­ted in­to a sto­ra­ge area. Spi­te­ful com­ments from Ca­el­lach Gwa­in as re­por­ted by Sha­na's sharp-eared ob­ser­vers among the child­ren we­re in no wi­se chan­ged. And yet-the dif­fe­ren­ce to her!</p>
   <p>    But the world out­si­de the­ir cham­ber was not go­ing to go away.</p>
   <p>    A plan-a lar­ge and comp­li­ca­ted plan to sa­fe­gu­ard the Ci­ta­del fo­re­ver-was be­gin­ning to ta­ke sha­pe bet­we­en the two of them. When news ca­me from Ke­man that Lord Kyrti­an had eit­her gi­ven or be­en or­de­red to gi­ve the com­mand of the army to so­me­one el­se whi­le the Co­un­cil de­ba­ted its fu­tu­re, the ne­ed for that plan to­ok on a new sen­se of ur­gency.</p>
   <p>    The old Ci­ta­del had de­fen­ses that this one didn't; it was ti­me to put them in pla­ce. Ala­ra and Ka­la­ma­dea we­re the chi­ef arc­hi­tects of the Ci­ta­del, and it was ti­me to con­sult with them.</p>
   <p>    She and Lorryn, Ala­ra and Fat­her Dra­gon sat to­get­her over a three-di­men­si­onal "map" of the Ci­ta­del, sculp­ted in re­mo­vab­le la­yers, trying to plan what next ne­eded to be mol­ded out of the rocks of the­ir mo­un­ta­in. One grim con­si­de­ra­ti­on-esca­pe tun­nels. Just in ca­se the Gre­at Lords de­ci­ded to send the for­mi­dab­le Lord Kyrti­an af­ter them. Anot­her, a dup­li­ca­te of the Ci­ta­del far eno­ugh away to flee to, but ne­ar eno­ugh that an eva­cu­ati­on co­uld ta­ke pla­ce by me­ans of the trans­por­ta­ti­on spell. The­re we­re eno­ugh Wi­zards ab­le to use it now that the en­ti­re po­pu­la­ti­on co­uld be eva­cu­ated wit­hin ho­urs, and the ad­van­ta­ge of the spell was that the­re wo­uld be no tracks to tra­ce them by.</p>
   <p>    The exis­ten­ce of this dup­li­ca­te-which was ne­ar eno­ugh to Zed's iron-mi­nes to pro­vi­de ext­ra pro­tec­ti­on, but at this po­int hardly mo­re than a few cham­bers mol­ded out of the rock by so­me of the yo­un­gest dra­gons-was for now a clo­sely-kept sec­ret. Even from the dra­gons wor­king on it. Ala­ra had told them it was not­hing mo­re than a new set of la­irs.</p>
   <p>    Which we al­so ne­ed, Sha­na tho­ught, won­de­ring just how thin the­ir re­so­ur­ces co­uld be stretc­hed be­fo­re things star­ted snap­ping.</p>
   <p>    "The pri­so­ners-how go­es the me­mory-ma­king?" Fat­her Dra­gon as­ked. He and Ala­ra we­re in halfb­lo­od form at the mo­ment, or they wo­uld ne­ver ha­ve fit in­to the map-cham­ber. "I do not wish to alarm you un­duly, but the so­oner we can drop tho­se two whe­re they can be fo­und, the bet­ter."</p>
   <p>    "Narshy's sor­ted out who's the best at plan­ting the new me­mo­ri­es, and he's got them stuf­fed with abo­ut a ye­ar's worth," Sha­na rep­li­ed, tra­cing a pos­sib­le exit tun­nel from the lo­west sto­ra­ge cham­ber on­to the mo­del with a wax pen­cil. "We de­ci­ded to ma­ke the me­mo­ri­es con­fu­sed and foggy, as if they'd be­en kept drug­ged."</p>
   <p>    "We no­mi­na­ted Ca­el­lach as the Chi­ef Wi­zard of this ima­gi­nary lot," Lorryn put in, get­ting a grin from Fat­her Dra­gon and a he­ad sha­ke from Ala­ra. "We had to ha­ve so­me­body, and at le­ast he's me­mo­rab­le."</p>
   <p>    "Narshy says we sho­uld be ab­le to plant them in a few days. He to­ok the re­al me­mo­ri­es of be­ing cap­tu­red, put new fa­ces on the pe­op­le do­ing the cap­tu­re, then to­ok it from the­re." Sha­na bro­oded over the mo­del. "He's using as much of the­ir re­al me­mo­ri­es as he can, just chan­ging the fa­ces to Wi­zards, the tents to rock wal­ls-and eli­mi­na­ting the iron col­lars. He's ma­king tho­se in­to so­met­hing li­ke sla­ve-col­lars, so that the El­ven-lords will think that this new lot of con­coc­ted Wi­zards are ac­tu­al­ly bet­ter at using el­ven ma­gic than the El­ven­lords them­sel­ves are."</p>
   <p>    "A go­od to­uch," Fat­her Dra­gon Sa­id, ad­mi­ringly.</p>
   <p>    "Now if only I co­uld fi­gu­re out a way to be in two pla­ces at the sa­me ti­me," Sha­na sa­id, sta­ring down at the map.</p>
   <p>    Keman and Do­ra had not be­en ab­le to get any ne­arer to Lord Kyrti­an wit­ho­ut re­ve­aling them­sel­ves, thanks in no small part to the sus­pi­ci­o­us Sar­ge­ant Gel. Sha­na had not da­red ask them to ta­ke that fi­nal, ir­re­vo­cab­le step. I ne­ed des­pe­ra­tely to see Lord Kyrti­an for myself! Only then wo­uld she know whet­her or not he was truly to be trus­ted-and if trus­ted, to be ap­pro­ac­hed. But if she was go­ne from he­re, the­re was no tel­ling what misc­hi­ef Ca­el­lach might not get up to. If she was de­la­yed-if so­met­hing hap­pe­ned-co­uld Lorryn cont­rol the old tro­ub­le­ma­ker for long? Or wo­uld Ca­el­lach ma­na­ge to re­ga­in his hold over his old fac­ti­on and set this en­ti­re war­ren se­et­hing with so many qu­ar­rels and bad fe­elings that it wo­uld all fall to pi­eces?</p>
   <p>    "Your mind or yo­ur body?" Ka­la­ma­dea as­ked, sud­denly, with an odd bird­li­ke twist of his he­ad.</p>
   <p>    "What do you me­an?" she rep­li­ed, won­de­ring what had promp­ted that sort of reply.</p>
   <p>    "Well-if it's yo­ur mind that ne­eds to be in two pla­ces at on­ce-that is, if you fe­el that you ha­ve to be ab­le to see and ma­ke de­ci­si­ons yo­ur­self abo­ut things go­ing on in two dif­fe­rent pla­ces at the sa­me ti­me, then we can't help you," Ka­la­ma­dea sa­id. "But if it's yo­ur body that ne­eds to be se­en in two pla­ces- if, for ins­tan­ce, you wan­ted to le­ave, and had con­fi­den­ce in so­me­one eno­ugh to let him ma­ke de­ci­si­ons for you but you ne­eded a sort of fi­gu­re­he­ad or pup­pet of yo­ur­self so that cer­ta­in pe­op­le wo­uldn't de­ci­de to ma­ke tro­ub­le whi­le you we­re go­ne-</p>
   <p>    "A cer­ta­in per­son who­se na­me rhymes with dra­in," Ala­ra put in, with a sly wink.</p>
   <p>    "Exactly-and if that's what's con­cer­ning you, well, that's en­ti­rely dif­fe­rent. And it's so­met­hing Ala­ra and I can help you with." Fat­her Dra­gon lo­oked par­ti­cu­larly smug, and it didn't ta­ke long for Sha­na to re­ali­ze why, what he me­ant, and she wan­ted to smack her­self in the he­ad for not thin­king of it so­oner.</p>
   <p>    "Of co­ur­se!" she exc­la­imed. "Oh, Mot­her-the­re's no re­ason why you can't sha­pe-shift in­to me, is the­re? You know me well eno­ugh to co­un­ter­fe­it me for every­body-" She flus­hed, as Lorryn la­ug­hed and ma­de a fa­ce. "-well, prac­ti­cal­ly every­body!"</p>
   <p>    "No re­ason at all," Ala­ra sa­id ag­re­e­ably. "And I don't know why we didn't think of this be­fo­re, when You-Know-Who be­ca­me so in­ter­fe­ring and di­sag­re­e­ab­le. Un­less it was be­ca­use we we­re too wor­ri­ed abo­ut what had hap­pe­ned to you to think of it."</p>
   <p>    Already her mind was ra­cing; if Ala­ra co­uld do this, and was wil­ling, then she co­uld go in per­son to see this Lord Kyrti­an and ma­ke a de­ci­si­on abo­ut whet­her or not she sho­uld try to ma­ke an ally of him.</p>
   <p>    She exc­han­ged a glan­ce with Lorryn. "Lord Kyrti­an," he sa­id simply, the­ir minds fol­lo­wing the sa­me track.</p>
   <p>    "I can't ma­ke a de­ci­si­on abo­ut him wit­ho­ut se­e­ing him myself," she rep­li­ed, nod­ding.</p>
   <p>    "Nor sho­uld you," Ka­la­ma­dea sa­id firmly. "Ke­man and Do­ra are go­od child­ren, but if they ma­ke a po­or cho­ice, they ha­ve the op­ti­on of flying away from Wi­zards and Ci­ta­del and all. Not-" he ad­ded has­tily "-that I be­li­eve that they wo­uld, but the op­ti­on is the­re, lur­king be­hind the­ir tho­ughts, and it co­uld ma­ke them a bit less ca­uti­o­us." He rub­bed his chin tho­ught­ful­ly. "I be­li­eve that sa­me op­ti­on might ha­ve ma­de me too ca­va­li­er in my own de­ci­si­ons at the ti­me of the First War."</p>
   <p>    Since Sha­na had oc­ca­si­onal­ly won­de­red that her­self, the­re was no go­od ans­wer she co­uld ma­ke to that.</p>
   <p>    Since she co­uldn't, she held her ton­gue. "Lorryn can cont­rol Ca­el­lach bet­ter than I can," she sa­id, with comp­le­te con­fi­den­ce and a wink to him. "And Lorryn is so­me­one the rest will lis­ten to."</p>
   <p>    They lis­ten to him mo­re than they do to me, ac­tu­al­ly. May­be be­ca­use he ne­ver was a wi­zard's ap­pren­ti­ce. The­re we­re so­me pro­fo­und di­sad­van­ta­ges to ha­ving be­en the ra­west of raw be­gin­ners wit­hin the old Ci­ta­del and the old re­gi­me it­self, and that was one of them. "The­re's only one dif­fi­culty, and that's-well, if an­yo­ne lo­oks in­to Ala­ra's mind, they're go­ing to know she isn't me."</p>
   <p>    "But the tro­ub­le­ma­kers are not the ones who are at all adept with the po­wers of hu­man ma­gic," Lorryn po­in­ted out lo­gi­cal­ly.</p>
   <p>    Alara just shrug­ged off the dif­fi­culty. "How of­ten is an­yo­ne li­kely to sno­op on the tho­ughts of the El­ven­ba­ne any­way?" she as­ked. "I sho­uldn't think it hap­pens of­ten, and be­si­des, I can pro­bably le­arn mind-wall well eno­ugh to ke­ep them out."</p>
   <p>    Perhaps. Per­haps not. Dra­gon minds aren't li­ke ours. But Ala­ra was right that in all this ti­me, Sha­na had very sel­dom felt the to­uch of anot­her's mind on hers, and even then it was so­me­one wan­ting to com­mu­ni­ca­te, not sno­op.</p>
   <p>    "I can ta­ke you to whe­re Ke­man and Do­ra are," Ka­la­ma­dea con­ti­nu­ed se­re­nely. "Now that Lord Kyrti­an has ta­ken le­ave of his com­mand whi­le the Gre­at Lords de­ba­te whet­her or not to dis­band the gre­ater part of the army, Ke­man and Do­ra ha­ve just to­day fol­lo­wed him to Lady Mort­he­na's es­ta­te."</p>
   <p>    "Lady Moth?" Lorryn's exc­la­ma­ti­on ma­de them all turn to lo­ok at him-and this news must ha­ve co­me as a surp­ri­se to him. "But that's whe­re my mot­her is! Lady Moth is one of her ol­dest fri­ends!"</p>
   <p>    "Really?" That was in­te­res­ting, but not overly so, and it didn't se­em par­ti­cu­larly im­por­tant to the­ir cur­rent si­tu­ati­on. But Lorryn was con­ti­nu­ing.</p>
   <p>    "You re­mem­ber, we've be­en get­ting so­me com­mu­ni­ca­ti­ons from mot­her-irre­gu­lar let­ters," he con­ti­nu­ed. "Lady Moth isn't just any el­ven lady. She has ne­ver mist­re­ated her hu­mans- they're ser­vants, not sla­ves, to her. In fact, when we left mot­her with her, just at the start of the re­volt, she was ri­ding the bo­unds of her es­ta­te with ar­med hu­man men who cal­led her 'Lit­tle Mot­her' and tre­ated her-well, with af­fec­ti­on."</p>
   <p>    That got her at­ten­ti­on. The only El­ven­lord that she had ever se­en tre­ated with af­fec­ti­on by hu­mans had be­en Valyn. "Re­al­ly?" And Lord Kyrti­an had go­ne the­re-why? "I won­der-"</p>
   <p>    "Don't won­der, go and find out," Fat­her Dra­gon ur­ged her. "Do it be­fo­re the Gre­at Lords ma­ke up the­ir minds what to do abo­ut him. Be­ca­use if they don't de­ci­de to use him, you can be su­re that they'll try to dest­roy him."</p>
   <p>    "Would that be so bad?" Sha­na co­un­te­red, kno­wing that she so­un­ded he­art­less-but she had to bring up the po­int, be­ca­use ot­hers wo­uld. If it ca­me down to it, her aut­ho­rity res­ted on one thing, and that was the abi­lity of the rest to trust her de­ci­si­ons. With so­me ra­re ex­cep­ti­ons, the hu­mans and Wi­zards of the Ci­ta­del wo­uld see El­ven­lords ta­king down ot­her El­ven­lords as a step in the right di­rec­ti­on, and not tro­ub­le them­sel­ves as to what might fol­low.</p>
   <p>    "It co­uld be." That was Lorryn, lo­oking tro­ub­led. "For one thing, Sha­na, if we can ma­ke him an ally, he'd be bet­ter than an­yo­ne he­re at the art of war. For anot­her-he has to be one of the ra­re ones, li­ke Lady Moth. If he's re­mo­ved, all the hu­mans on his es­ta­te will be in de­adly dan­ger from who­ever they put in his pla­ce. You can't want that!"</p>
   <p>    She gro­aned, but had to ag­ree; if all that was true, even if they ma­na­ged to res­cue all of Lord Kyrti­an's sla­ves, it wo­uld stra­in the ca­pa­city of the Ci­ta­del to sup­port them. Why was it that every turn of fa­te bro­ught mo­re and mo­re pe­op­le for whom she had to be res­pon­sib­le in­to her pur­vi­ew?</p>
   <p>    "He may not re­ali­ze just how tre­ac­he­ro­us the Gre­at Lords are, Sha­na," Ka­la­ma­dea sa­id qu­i­etly. "He may not dre­am he's in dan­ger. If not­hing el­se, he de­ser­ves to be war­ned."</p>
   <p>    "And the best per­son to warn him is me, I sup­po­se." She tri­ed to so­und re­sig­ned, but asi­de from the pres­su­re and bur­den of ap­pa­rently ad­di­ti­onal res­pon­si­bi­li­ti­es, she didn't re­al­ly fe­el re­sig­ned at all. She felt ex­ci­ted-this was the sort of thing she was go­od at.</p>
   <p>    But Lor­ryn-to se­pa­ra­te, even tem­po­ra­rily, now that they we­re to­get­her-</p>
   <p>    Once aga­in, he re­ad her fe­elings as well as her tho­ughts.</p>
   <p>    "You go," he sa­id, softly, be­fo­re she even lo­oked at him. "You ha­ve to go. I'll see no one ma­kes tro­ub­le he­re, and you'll be the­re and back aga­in be­fo­re you know it. It can't ta­ke mo­re than a few days at most, can it?"</p>
   <p>    "I wo­uldn't think so, but-" Now she lo­oked at him.</p>
   <p>    :I'll miss you every mo­ment, but this is so­met­hing only you can do. He might not trust a dra­gon. He won't trust that so­me stran­ge wi­zard has the aut­ho­rity to spe­ak for all of us. Re­na can't get he­re so­on eno­ugh to talk to him, even if she'd be wil­ling to le­ave Mew. But you're the El­ven­ba­ne. If you ma­ke him an of­fer, he'll be­li­eve you.:</p>
   <p>    And the­re, af­ter all, was the he­art of the mat­ter. She was dis­tinc­ti­ve; no one co­uld mis­ta­ke her for anyt­hing ot­her than what she was. Her desc­rip­ti­on had cir­cu­la­ted to every part of the El-ven­lords' do­ma­in now, and on­ce Lord Kyrti­an set eyes on her, he wo­uld know who she was.</p>
   <p>    :Just pro­mi­se to co­me back to me.:</p>
   <p>    That was the easi­est pro­mi­se she had ever ma­de.</p>

   <p>    Kyrtian's no­se tick­led, and he rub­bed it ab­sently. Why is it that in spi­te of de­ca­des of prac­ti­ce, the An­ces­tors had handw­ri­ting that was uni­formly at­ro­ci­o­us? The tiny words not only lo­oked as tho­ugh they had be­en writ­ten with the aid of a lens, they con­for­med to no scho­ol of cal­lig­raphy he 'd ever se­en.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian la­bo­red his way thro­ugh yet anot­her per­so­nal jo­ur­nal, ma­king no­tes on she­ets of fo­ols­cap for la­ter transc­rip­ti­on in his own ne­at (and ext­re­mely le­gib­le) hand. This bu­si­ness of con­coc­ting a "per­so­nal" script-style must ha­ve be­en a com­mon af­fec­ta­ti­on among the bo­red. But why they sho­uld cho­ose to al­so wri­te as if pa­per was mo­re va­lu­ab­le than gold was be­yond his comp­re­hen­si­on.</p>
   <p>    Here in Lady Moth's lib­rary, it was so qu­i­et he co­uld al­most he­ar dust mo­tes fal­ling out of the air to add to the ac­cu­mu­la­ti­on on the bo­oks. Lady Moth had bro­ught back all the vo­lu­mes that she had ext­rac­ted du­ring the ti­me that the Yo­ung Lords we­re using the pla­ce as the­ir he­ad­qu­ar­ters. The si­tu­ati­on was re­ver­sed now, and she com­man­ded her la­te hus­band's es­ta­te and hol­dings as she sho­uld ha­ve do­ne so­me ti­me past. With no army to com­mand and no war to fight, the Yo­ung Lords we­re hardly in ne­ed of a com­mand-post, alt­ho­ugh they we­re still full of an im­po­tent de­fi­an­ce.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian re­ac­hed for a glass of wa­ter and ab­sently to­ok a sip.</p>
   <p>    For the mo­ment, the Yo­ung Lords we­re li­ving on the gro­unds of the do­wa­ger-esta­te, Lady Moth's To­wer, hi­ding in the one pla­ce whe­re no one was li­kely to co­me lo­oking for them. We­aring il­lu­sory dis­gu­ises to ma­ke them lo­ok li­ke hu­man sla­ves, it was un­li­kely that even if a se­arch was ma­de the­re for them that they wo­uld be fo­und.</p>
   <p>    As long as they can hold to­get­her, and not ha­ve so­me­one get a chan­ge of he­art and de­fect, they sho­uld do all right.</p>
   <p>    He'd tal­ked to them all, and at the mo­ment, he didn't think that li­kely. Not whi­le they we­re sa­fe and not ha­ving to suf­fer any se­ri­o­us hards­hips.</p>
   <p>    Not even Moth's own sla­ves knew who they we­re-the story was that they had be­en part of the Yo­ung Lord's army, and that Moth was shel­te­ring them to ke­ep them from be­ing pu­nis­hed for ha­ving be­en consc­rip­ted in the first pla­ce.</p>
   <p>    It was a si­tu­ati­on that ma­de it hard for Kyrti­an to ke­ep a stra­ight fa­ce whe­ne­ver he tho­ught abo­ut it. Li­ving among the sla­ves was go­ing to do them a world of go­od.</p>
   <p>    Already he'd se­en signs of a chan­ge in at­ti­tu­de to­wards the hu­mans from so­me of them. He had every con­fi­den­ce that if- or when-the Re­volt star­ted aga­in, it wo­uld be on a very dif­fe­rent fo­oting.</p>
   <p>    If it hap­pe­ned, they al­re­ady co­un­ted on it ha­ving a very dif­fe­rent en­ding. The­ir plans cal­led for him to eit­her jo­in them openly or per­mit the Gre­at Lords to pla­ce him back in com­mand of the army and pro­ce­ed to ac­tu­al­ly do as lit­tle as pos­sib­le. Then, at the right mo­ment, he co­uld turn the Co­un­cil's army aga­inst the Gre­at Lords them­sel­ves.</p>
   <p>    But I don't want to do that if I can help it. Such a war-be­ca­use it wo­uld be a war, and not a re­volt-wo­uld be blo­ody. Most of the ca­su­al­ti­es wo­uld be hu­man; the­re was just no get­ting aro­und that. And alt­ho­ugh-if the Yo­ung Lords had chan­ged the­ir at­ti­tu­de to­wards sla­ve-owning by then-the hu­mans on the­ir si­de wo­uld ha­ve an ac­ti­ve sta­ke in the out­co­me, they wo­uld still be the ones ta­king the full for­ce of the figh­ting. The­re we­re far mo­re of them than the­re we­re El­ves, and as physi­cal figh­ters-well, the Yo­ung Lords we­re not very go­od.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian's plan, which he ho­ped to talk the Yo­ung Lords in­to, was mo­re subt­le. He wan­ted them to cre­ep back to the­ir august fat­hers one at a ti­me, in sec­ret, and gro­vel. They wo­uld still ha­ve the iron jewelry that kept the­ir fat­hers from wor­king ma­gic on them; that was key.</p>
   <p>    After they re­tur­ned, and on­ce they ma­na­ged to re­ga­in so­me fre­edom of mo­ve­ment, he ho­ped they co­uld work the­ir own way back up thro­ugh the hi­erarchy, and at­tri­ti­on among the Gre­at Lords wo­uld even­tu­al­ly put them in the se­ats of po­wer.</p>
   <p>    Such a plan, ho­we­ver, did ha­ve a num­ber of draw­backs, not the le­ast of" which was that the­re we­re plenty of the Gre­at Lords who wo­uld qu­ite re­adily slay the­ir re­bel­li­o­us sons and un­der­lings out of hand if they ever so much as sho­wed the­ir fa­ces. And on­ce back in a fat­her's go­od gra­ces, the­re was al­ways the chan­ce that so­me­one wo­uld turn tra­itor. That wo­uld be… awk­ward.</p>
   <p>    So for now, they we­re in hi­ding, and if they we­ren't ac­comp­lis­hing anyt­hing, at le­ast they we­ren't get­ting in­to tro­ub­le eit­her.</p>
   <p>    Meanwhile-as the Co­un­cil de­ba­ted the next use they we­re go­ing to ma­ke of him, and his erstw­hi­le ene­mi­es co­oled the­ir he­els in cir­cums­tan­ces he ho­ped wo­uld te­ach them so­me em­pathy, he was using his en­for­ced le­isu­re to get back to the se­arch for his fat­her.</p>
   <p>    The ans­wer to his fat­her's whe­re­abo­uts was in this ro­om, so­mew­he­re, he was su­re. The tro­ub­le was that the­re was so much to wa­de thro­ugh, and no­ne of it had ever be­en pro­perly ca­ta­lo­ged. Per­so­nal jo­ur­nals we­re cram­med in next to the sort of ro­man­tic no­vels con­si­de­red ap­prop­ri­ate for la­di­es to whi­le away the­ir ho­urs with-bo­oks on flo­ra and fa­una we­re pi­led atop maps and vo­lu­mes on ma­gic.</p>
   <p>    His no­se tick­led aga­in, and he un­suc­ces­sful­ly tri­ed to sup­press a sne­eze. Moth or her fri­end Vi­ri­di­na we­re in he­re a do­zen ti­mes a day, trying to cle­an out the dust ma­gi­cal­ly, but every ti­me he ope­ned a vo­lu­me mo­re of it flew up in­to the air in clo­uds.</p>
   <p>    Moth's fa­mily had a ma­nia of the­ir own-for col­lec­ting. Most of this lib­rary had co­me to her from va­ri­o­us fa­mily mem­bers. They we­re, ho­we­ver, in­disc­ri­mi­na­te in the­ir ma­nia. In the ca­se of the ones who'd ac­qu­ired bo­oks and ma­nusc­ripts, the de­fi­ni­ti­on of a "bo­ok" se­emed to be "any col­lec­ti­on of pa­per with co­vers on it" and the de­fi­ni­ti­on of "ma­nusc­ript" was "any col­lec­ti­on of handw­rit­ten pa­per." As far as he co­uld tell, the­re was no met­hod in what they'd se­lec­ted, no ca­te­go­ri­es, no at­tempt to pla­ce a va­lue on anyt­hing.</p>
   <p>    Perhaps, if he'd be­en in he­re be­fo­re the Yo­ung Lords to­ok re­si­den­ce, he'd ha­ve be­en ab­le to find the things his fat­her had stu­di­ed that had gi­ven him his re­al clue. But they had simply sho­ve­led everyt­hing they fo­und to the si­de in he­aps so that they co­uld use the ro­om for the­ir own pur­po­ses, and Moth hadn't hel­ped when she ext­rac­ted the bo­oks that she tho­ught we­re im­por­tant. Moth, bless her, had be­en un­der the imp­res­si­on that she had kept so­me or­der and cle­an­li­ness to the lib­rary.</p>
   <p>    Yes, well, that was be­fo­re we fo­und the bo­xes in the sto­ra­ge-cham­ber. Moth's hus­band had ma­in­ta­ined a "show" lib­rary, with things he tho­ught worth ke­eping at­trac­ti­vely shel­ved. The rest-which amo­un­ted to fo­ur or fi­ve ti­mes the vo­lu­me of works on show-had got­ten pac­ked in­to bo­xes and stac­ked up in a sto­re­ro­om be­hind the lib­rary it­self. Moth had tho­ught that the sto­re­ro­om was empty un­til they'd ope­ned the do­or. In the­ir se­arch for maps they co­uld use to plan the­ir cam­pa­ign and the plans of ma­nors and es­ta­te-ho­uses, the Yo­ung Lords had rum­ma­ged thro­ugh it all, brin­ging so­me things in­to the lib­rary and le­aving them, re­mo­ving ot­her things to ma­ke ro­om for what they bro­ught in. Wha­te­ver or­der had on­ce be­en he­re was go­ne comp­le­tely. Now the sto­re­ro­om had shel­ves, and so did the unu­sed of­fi­ce next to it, and the unu­sed re­cep­ti­on-ro­om next to that, and Kyrti­an was trying to bring so­me or­der to the cha­os.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian, ho­we­ver, was fast be­co­ming con­vin­ced that his ans­wer lay, not in prin­ted bo­oks or il­lu­mi­na­ted ma­nusc­ripts, in­te­res­ting as tho­se might be, but in the per­so­nal jo­ur­nals kept of­ten by el­ven la­di­es, and inf­re­qu­ently by the­ir lords.</p>
   <p>    His fat­her had al­most cer­ta­inly di­vi­ned the lo­ca­ti­on of the Por­tal from so­met­hing in he­re. That lo­ca­ti­on was lost, and what was mo­re, the­re se­emed to be evi­den­ce that the An­ces­tors who had bu­ilt the thing had en­ga­ged in an ac­ti­ve ef­fort to hi­de that lo­ca­ti­on from the­ir des­cen­dants-and even from so­me of the­ir own who had co­me thro­ugh the Por­tal.</p>
   <p>    Why? That was a go­od qu­es­ti­on. Per­haps they fe­ared a tra­itor in the­ir midst who wo­uld re-open the Por­tal to the­ir ene­mi­es. The Por­tal it­self had co­ope­ra­ted in era­sing me­mo­ri­es; it was fa­irly cle­ar that the Cros­sing was such a tra­uma­tic or­de­al in and of it­self that a subs­tan­ti­al num­ber of tho­se who Cros­sed co­uld not re­mem­ber a gre­at de­al of what hap­pe­ned im­me­di­ately the­re­af­ter.</p>
   <p>    And per­haps so­me of tho­se folk we­re "hel­ped" to for­get.</p>
   <p>    None, not one, of the Gre­at Lords that had cre­ated the Por­tal and sur­vi­ved the Cros­sing left any subs­tan­ti­ve re­cords abo­ut it. That much was fact. Nor did any of the his­to­ri­ans-anot­her fact. So with no of­fi­ci­al re­cords, he was left with only one ot­her so­ur­ce, the unof­fi­ci­al ones-and of tho­se, the best wo­uld be the re­cords of tho­se who we­re con­si­de­red too in­sig­ni­fi­cant to mat­ter.</p>
   <p>    The la­di­es… ah yes, the la­di­es.</p>
   <p>    And the ec­cent­rics.</p>
   <p>    Some of tho­se jo­ur­nals we­re at­trac­ti­vely bo­und and might at one ti­me ha­ve be­en shel­ved in the ma­in ro­om-and that might be whe­re Kyrti­an's fat­her had got­ten his in­for­ma­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Or he might ha­ve fo­und so­met­hing in of­fi­ci­al re­cords that Kyrti­an had so­me­how comp­le­tely over­lo­oked.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian ran a dusty hand thro­ugh his ha­ir in frust­ra­ti­on, then told him­self sternly not to get so im­pa­ti­ent. Af­ter all, his fat­her had be­en hun­ting for the Por­tal for de­ca­des be­fo­re Kyrti­an was born; by the ti­me he fo­und what he was lo­oking for, he had pro­bably got­ten to the po­int that he was so fa­mi­li­ar with the An­ces­tors and the way the­ir minds wor­ked that he was ab­le to in­tu­it things that we­ren't ob­vi­o­us.</p>
   <p>    So he was wa­ding thro­ugh everyt­hing handw­rit­ten that Moth had in this lib­rary, with the Gre­at Bo­ok of An­ces­tors be­si­de him. Be­fo­re he co­uld eli­mi­na­te any ma­nusc­ript or jo­ur­nal, he first had to fi­gu­re out who wro­te it, or at le­ast who the aut­hor's con­tem­po­ra­ri­es we­re, then dis­co­ver whet­her or not the aut­hor li­ved far eno­ugh back to ha­ve ma­de the Cros­sing.</p>
   <p>    Since it was al­most a gu­aran­tee that most of the ma­nusc­ripts he fo­und wo­uld be from too la­te a pe­ri­od to men­ti­on the Cros­sing ex­cept in pas­sing, he wo­uld then try to find every ot­her ma­nusc­ript that co­uld be at­tri­bu­ted to that per­son. Most pe­op­le who we­re ad­dic­ted to jo­ur­nal-wri­ting had pro­du­ced mul­tip­le vo­lu­mes over the co­ur­se of the­ir very long li­ves. If the aut­hor was of too la­te a pe­ri­od, well, it hel­ped to be ab­le to we­ed out everyt­hing that co­uld be at­tri­bu­ted to her pen.</p>
   <p>    It was a pa­in­ful­ly lo­gi­cal and met­ho­di­cal plan of de­aling with the si­tu­ati­on. It was al­so very te­di­o­us, very ti­me-con­su­ming, and very, very dusty.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian had two hel­pers at le­ast-Gel, and that lit­tle fe­ma­le con­cu­bi­ne that Lady Tri­ana had be­en so con­si­de­ra­te in plan­ting on him. He'd sent for her a-pur­po­se on­ce he'd tur­ned over his com­mis­si­on to Lord Kyndreth whi­le the Co­un­cil de­ba­ted. If Tri­ana was so in­te­res­ted in what he was do­ing, he was inc­li­ned to al­low her mo­re in­for­ma­ti­on than she co­uld com­for­tably di­gest. He had a no­ti­on that she was wor­king with Ael­mar­kin, at le­ast for the mo­ment. Lady Moth had be­en very help­ful in pre­sen­ting him with a sum­mary of her past be­ha­vi­or, and from that he'd for­med the opi­ni­on that wha­te­ver ga­me she pla­yed, wha­te­ver al­li­an­ces she ma­de, her ul­ti­ma­te go­al wo­uld ser­ve no one but her­self.</p>
   <p>    Now, to his mind, the best pos­sib­le way to hand­le her was to gi­ve her the in­for­ma­ti­on he wan­ted her to ha­ve. Gel had exa­mi­ned the girl him­self, in­ter­ro­ga­ting her to the po­int of ex­ha­us­ti­on and even te­ars, and it was his opi­ni­on that Lydi­ell had suc­ce­eded in "tur­ning" her. Whe­ne­ver she re­por­ted to Tri­ana- and Tri­ana had be­en very in­te­res­ted to le­arn just whe­re he was and what he was do­ing right now-Gel was the­re, ma­king cer­ta­in she stuck to the script they'd ag­re­ed on.</p>
   <p>    Nevertheless, she didn't know exactly what it was he was do­ing in Moth's lib­rary; what she didn't know, she co­uldn't be for­ced to re­ve­al if Tri­ana or Ael­mar­kin ever got the­ir hands on her. She knew only what she saw-which was that he had or­de­red all the bo­oks down off the shel­ves to be sor­ted-that Moth's sla­ves had then res­hel­ved and ca­ta­lo­ged all of the prin­ted ma­te­ri­al. Whi­le they wor­ked, he exa­mi­ned the handw­rit­ten stuff, cre­ating a se­cond ca­ta­log, and she and Gel shel­ved what he was do­ne with. She co­uldn't re­ad el­ven hand-script; she didn't know what he was ke­eping and what he was re­j­ec­ting. So alt­ho­ugh she now had a we­alth of in­for­ma­ti­on abo­ut his mo­ve­ments, no­ne of it was li­kely to do Tri­ana any go­od.</p>
   <p>    He ac­tu­al­ly ex­pec­ted the in­fa­mo­us Tri­ana to put in an ap­pe­aran­ce be­fo­re too very much lon­ger. He co­uldn't see how she co­uld pos­sibly re­sist trying to pry in­to his af­fa­irs in per­son. She would pro­bably al­so try to se­du­ce him; that was her pat­tern in the past. He had he­ard, even from Moth, that she was a gre­at be­a­uty, and not a pas­si­ve, sta­tu­es­que cre­atu­re eit­her, but li­vely, witty, ag­gres­si­ve, and not af­ra­id to show her in­tel­li­gen­ce. Such a wo­man had le­ar­ned how to turn her lo­oks and fas­ci­na­ti­on in­to a we­apon long ago. She might even ha­ve ap­pro­ac­hed Lord Kyndreth as well as Ael­mar­kin, pre­pa­red to use an­yo­ne and anyt­hing in her qu­est for per­so­nal po­wer. If that was the ca­se, she might well ha­ve met her match in Lord Kyndreth, who had be­en pla­ying de­ep ga­mes for far lon­ger than lit­tle Lady Tri­ana.</p>
   <p>    Ancestors-I've tur­ned in­to such a cynic-</p>
   <p>    There we­re ti­mes when he lon­ged for what he had be­en- when the worst of his wor­ri­es was wor­king out lit­tle bat­tle-plans and cons­pi­ring with Lydi­ell to ke­ep Ael­mar­kin at a dis­tan­ce. To think that he had ac­tu­al­ly lo­oked up to pe­op­le li­ke Lord Kyndreth!</p>
   <p>    Well, I know bet­ter now.</p>
   <p>    It hadn't just be­en his own ex­pe­ri­en­ces that had en­ligh­te­ned him, nor the night-long, acid-was­hed "frank talk" that Moth had had with him when he first ar­ri­ved. It was the tes­ta­ment of the­se very ma­nusc­ripts be­ne­ath his hands, that out­li­ned the mac­hi­na­ti­ons and bet­ra­yals, the abu­se of po­wer and the use of it, from the po­int of vi­ew of tho­se that the po­wer­ful con­si­de­red too in­sig­ni­fi­cant to mo­ni­tor. Mind, so­me of them we­re no pri­zes, eit­her, ac­ting li­ke chic­kens in the hen yard, tur­ning, when pec­ked, to ham­mer on tho­se be­ne­ath them. But it had be­en an en­ligh­te­ning, if dis­tas­te­ful edu­ca­ti­on, wa­ding thro­ugh the pa­ges they pro­bably tho­ught no one el­se wo­uld ever re­ad.</p>
   <p>    Is it any bet­ter among the Wi­zards and free hu­mans, I won­der? With most of his il­lu­si­ons go­ne, he had to gu­ess that it was pro­bably mo­re a mat­ter of deg­ree. The Gre­at Lords we­re so po­wer­ful and tho­se who as­pi­red to the­ir po­wer we­re so fi­xa­ted on ac­hi­eving it, that the very po­wer they all held or cra­ved cor­rup­ted them. It was ine­vi­tab­le un­less, li­ke Moth, they we­re acu­tely awa­re of just how dan­ge­ro­us that much po­wer was. The fact that they li­ved such very long li­ves only me­ant that the cor­rup­ti­on and sel­fish­ness was etc­hed de­eper than it co­uld ever pos­sibly go with a me­re hu­man.</p>
   <p>    But the­re are the ot­hers. Li­ke Moth, Lydi­ell-and myself, I ho­pe. Po­wer didn't ha­ve to cor­rupt, if you knew just how dan­ge­ro­us it was, and we­re well awa­re that it ca­me bur­de­ned with inc­re­dib­le res­pon­si­bi­li­ti­es. He ho­ped that the­re we­re tho­se among the Wi­zards and free hu­mans who knew that.</p>
   <p>    Perhaps that was the key to tho­se among the El­ven­lords who did tre­at the hu­mans who had co­me un­der the­ir pro­tec­ti­on with the sa­me con­si­de­ra­ti­on that they wo­uld ha­ve gi­ven an el­ven un­der­ling; and tho­se el­ven un­der­lings who tre­ated hu­mans as equ­als. They we­re the ones who had felt the bo­ot of the Eve­lon over­lords on the­ir backs, and had le­ar­ned from the ex­pe­ri­en­ce- or who, at le­ast, had de­ter­mi­ned ne­ver to tre­at one with less po­wer as they them­sel­ves had be­en tre­ated. And tho­se An­ces­tors, in the­ir turn, had pas­sed the­ir at­ti­tu­de down to the­ir of­fsp­ring.</p>
   <p>    Were the­re mo­re such ho­use­holds as his.and Lady Moth's? Pos­sibly-for a mo­ment, he da­red to ho­pe that the­re we­re, hi­ding the­ir na­tu­re just as he and his fat­her and grand­fat­her had. They we­re pro­bably just li­ke his fa­mily-re­ma­ining qu­i­etly, self-suf­fi­ci­ently in the backg­ro­und, per­mit­ting the Gre­at Lords to be­li­eve that they we­re ho­pe­les­sly pro­vin­ci­al and not worth tro­ub­ling with. An­ces­tors knew that if Ael­mar­kin hadn't be­en such a thorn in the­ir si­de, the­ir ho­use­hold wo­uld ne­ver ha­ve co­me un­der the scru­tiny of Kyndreth, and he wo­uld ne­ver ha­ve be­en for­ced in­to the "open" to find him­self rec­ru­ited as a mi­li­tary ex­pert.</p>
   <p>    He re­ali­zed at that mo­ment that he'd be­en sta­ring at the sa­me pa­ge for qu­ite so­me ti­me, and hadn't de­cip­he­red a word of it.</p>
   <p>    Gah. I'm a scho­lar, not a phi­lo­sop­her! He bent over the clo­sely-writ­ten pa­ge aga­in.</p>
   <p>    Whispers from the re­ar of the lib­rary int­ru­ded on his at­ten­ti­on- be­ca­use one of the whis­pe­rers was Gel, and the­re was a to­ne in the man's vo­ice he'd ne­ver he­ard be­fo­re.</p>
   <p>    He to­ok a qu­ick glan­ce over the top of the ma­nusc­ript. Su­re eno­ugh, the­re wasn't a gre­at de­al of shel­ving go­ing on, but Gel and the pretty lit­tle con­cu­bi­ne cer­ta­inly had the­ir he­ads clo­se to­get­her.</p>
   <p>    Well, well, well! The gra­ni­te crag cracks at last!</p>
   <p>    He didn't know whet­her to la­ugh or be an­no­yed. Not that he wan­ted the girl; oh, she was at­trac­ti­ve and ta­len­ted eno­ugh, but so we­re the two ot­her girls his mot­her had purc­ha­sed for him. But of all the ti­mes for his to­ugh-min­ded part­ner to pick to go soft over a wo­man, this had to be the worst!</p>
   <p>    On the ot­her hand, this was Gel he was tal­king abo­ut. Gel, who had ta­ught him the bu­si­ness of war and figh­ting, Gel who stuck by his si­de li­ke a fa­ith­ful dog, Gel who had ne­ver as­ked for anyt­hing for him­self. How co­uld he pos­sibly be an­no­yed that Gel had fi­nal­ly fo­und so­me­one who to­uc­hed his he­art?</p>
   <p>    Oh, An­ces­tors.</p>
   <p>    Now how was he go­ing to jug­gle all this? Hid­den re­bels, pos­sib­le tre­ac­hery from his su­pe­ri­ors, the hunt for his fat­her- and now Gel in lo­ve? What next?</p>
   <p>    As he sta­red at the not-so-yo­ung lo­ver, he felt a tap on his sho­ul­der. Lady Moth had co­me in­to the lib­rary wit­ho­ut his no­ti­cing, and she wo­re her mask-fa­ce, the one that ge­ne­ral­ly me­ant that she was-well, up to so­met­hing.</p>
   <p>    "We ha­ve a vi­si­tor that I be­li­eve you will want to me­et yo­ur­self," she whis­pe­red, af­ter a glan­ce at Gel and the girl who we­re comp­le­tely ob­li­vi­o­us to anyt­hing el­se go­ing on aro­und them.</p>
   <p>    Oh no-not Tri­ana-</p>
   <p>    "You may tell Lady Tri­ana that-" he be­gan.</p>
   <p>    But Moth's eyeb­rows shot up, and she in­ter­rup­ted him. "I don't know why you sho­uld be ex­pec­ting her," Moth rep­li­ed, "but it's not Lady Tri­ana. And I do think you sho­uld put down that stu­pid jo­ur­nal writ­ten by an equ­al­ly stu­pid block­he­ad and co­me with me. Now."</p>
   <p>    Seeing that she was not to be de­ni­ed, Kyrti­an sig­hed, mar­ked the pla­ce whe­re he was le­aving off, and sto­od up.</p>
   <p>    The lo­vers ne­ver no­ti­ced that he was le­aving. That in it­self was an in­di­ca­ti­on of just how hard Gel had fal­len.</p>
   <p>    Oh, An­ces­tors, I only ho­pe that Tri­ana didn 't pla­ce that girl with me to get at Gel rat­her than me…</p>
   <p>    With his tho­ughts flit­ting bet­we­en amu­se­ment and con­cern, he wasn't pa­ying a gre­at de­al of at­ten­ti­on when Moth bro­ught him in­to a tiny cham­ber kit­ted out as a sit­ting-ro­om, whe­re a young wo­man wa­ited, pa­cing up and down in front of the win­dows, disp­la­ying no gre­at pa­ti­en­ce her­self. All he no­ti­ced at first was that she was red-ha­ired and gre­en-eyed, clot­hed in the sa­me sort of tu­nic, bo­ots, and trews as a com­mon la­bo­rer, with the physi­que of so­me­one who was ath­le­tic and very much used to ta­king ca­re of her­self in any and all cir­cums­tan­ces. He co­uldn't ima­gi­ne why Moth had in­sis­ted he me­et this per­son- un­less, per­haps, she was one of Moth's hu­man ser­vants and had in­for­ma­ti­on abo­ut the Yo­ung Lords?</p>
   <p>    "Lord Kyrti­an," Moth sa­id for­mal­ly, "I be­li­eve that you ha­ve many things to dis­cuss with Las­ha­na." She tip­ped her he­ad to the si­de as he sig­hed with exas­pe­ra­ti­on, still won­de­ring what she was get­ting at. She pur­sed her lips, but her gre­en eyes held the ghost of amu­se­ment in them. "I be­li­eve you might know her by anot­her na­me. El­ven­ba­ne."</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>WHAT?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    He lost every ves­ti­ge of exas­pe­ra­ti­on, an­no­yan­ce, im­pa­ti­en­ce in that mo­ment. He sta­red at the wo­man, who sto­od po­ised li­ke a de­er abo­ut to flee, trying to ma­ke his mind be­li­eve what his ears had just he­ard.</p>
   <p>    Red ha­ir-but el­ven eyes. And the ears. Wi­zard blo­od, un­less it's an il­lu­si­on-</p>
   <p>    But Moth wo­uld ne­ver ha­ve be­en fo­oled by an il­lu­si­on. Moth had met Wi­zards. Moth's fri­end Vi­ri­di­na-her son was a wi­zard.</p>
   <p>    "Lashana ar­ri­ved be­aring a let­ter from Vi­ri­di­na's halfb­lo­od son, ve­rif­ying her iden­tity," Moth sa­id, as if di­vi­ning his tho­ughts.</p>
   <p>    She pro­bably is, the old sche­mer! She do­esn 't ne­ed to re­ad tho­ughts, she knows me li­ke her fa­vo­ri­te son­net!</p>
   <p>    "I am-fas­ci­na­ted to me­et you, Las­ha­na," he sa­id ca­re­ful­ly. "Or sho­uld I call you 'Elven­ba­ne?'"</p>
   <p>    "Please don't," the yo­ung wo­man sa­id firmly. She was still ten­se and very ill-at-ease. "It's not a na­me I ever cla­imed for myself."</p>
   <p>    Both of them sto­od so awk­wardly, so stiffly, that Moth be­gan to chuck­le. "Kyrti­an, Las­ha­na, for An­ces­tors' sa­ke, sit down! You lo­ok li­ke a pa­ir of bad car­vings, I do swe­ar!"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian re­la­xed mar­gi­nal­ly, and ges­tu­red to Las­ha­na to ta­ke a se­at on the cus­hi­oned bench ne­arest her. She did so, mo­ving as if she was an old cre­atu­re with fro­zen jo­ints. He se­lec­ted a slightly lo­wer se­at on a sto­ol, to put his eyes a lit­tle lo­wer than hers.</p>
   <p>    "I don't ha­ve much ti­me," she sa­id, fi­nal­ly. "And I'm not cer­ta­in how to be­gin."</p>
   <p>    "I can tell you that," he of­fe­red, and tri­ed a smi­le. "Be­gin with why you knew you co­uld trust me not to kill you on sight."</p>
   <p>    As he had ho­ped, such a di­rect and blunt ap­pro­ach was pre­ci­sely the right way to ap­pro­ach her, and she be­gan tel­ling him the most ama­zing story that he had ever he­ard in his li­fe. He lis­te­ned and had to work not to al­low his mo­uth to fall open with shock mo­re than on­ce. To think that two of her pe­op­le had got­ten clo­se eno­ugh to him to stand gu­ard on his very tent so that they co­uld spy on him! He wo­uld ha­ve to ha­ve a word with Gel abo­ut that, la­ter.</p>
   <p>    At so­me po­int his ca­pa­city for she­er as­to­nish­ment was ex­ha­us­ted, and he co­uld only lis­ten to her in a sort of tran­ce. It was all too im­pos­sib­le to be­li­eve, and yet he had to be­li­eve in it. The things she told him fit too well with what he al­re­ady knew.</p>
   <p>    Then, af­ter tal­king un­til she was ho­ar­se, she pa­used, and exc­han­ged a sig­ni­fi­cant lo­ok with Lady Moth. "So," she sa­id. "Now you tell me to ta­ke myself off. Or-"</p>
   <p>    "Or I ask you if yo­ur Wi­zards wo­uld da­re ac­cept the El­ven-lord Com­man­der as an ally," he fi­nis­hed, ha­ving al­re­ady co­me to the conc­lu­si­on that this, and only this, co­uld be the re­ason why she had co­me to him. Bril­li­ant-auda­ci­o­us-and comp­le­tely lo­gi­cal. And on the ot­her hand, comp­le­tely il­lo­gi­cal that she sho­uld ever trust a ful­lblo­od.</p>
   <p>    She sta­red at him, and sud­denly every bit of ten­si­on ran out of her, just li­ke wa­ter run­ning out of a crac­ked jar. "Fi­re and Ra­in!" she exc­la­imed we­akly. "You're just as Ke­man cla­imed you are!"</p>
   <p>    He won­de­red if she had re­ad his tho­ughts, using the sa­me hu­man ma­gic that so­me of his own pe­op­le had-and Moth's.</p>
   <p>    "Only the sur­fa­ce," she rep­li­ed ins­tantly. "I don't pry; no­ne of us wo­uld. And if you want, I can te­ach you a met­hod to ke­ep even the sur­fa­ce tho­ughts pri­va­te."</p>
   <p>    He lo­oked de­eply in­to her eme­rald eyes, so li­ke and un­li­ke a ful­lblo­od's, and saw only sin­ce­rity in them. He'd be­en aro­und hu­man ma­ges too of­ten to fe­el un­ner­ved by her ins­tant res­pon­se to his tho­ught. "I'd ap­pre­ci­ate that," he rep­li­ed. "But it can wa­it. So, now I as­su­me you know abo­ut my own pe­op­le?" A sud­den, blin­ding idea oc­cur­red to him at that mo­ment, the way that he co­uld, fi­nal­ly, sa­fe­gu­ard his own pe­op­le and his mot­her no mat­ter what hap­pe­ned to him, and he saw that she saw it in his tho­ughts by the surp­ri­se that flas­hed in­to her eyes.</p>
   <p>    "Yes!" she exc­la­imed. "Oh, in­de­ed yes, Lord Kyrti­an, we can, and we will, ta­ke yo­ur folk if they must be eva­cu­ated! Por­tals-the trans­por­ta­ti­on ma­gic-wha­te­ver is ne­eded; bet­we­en yo­ur pe­op­le and mi­ne we can do wha­te­ver it ta­kes to get them to sa­fety. And you ne­edn't fe­ar for yo­ur mot­her and the ot­her El­ves of yo­ur ho­use, eit­her-we ha­ve Lorryn's half-sis­ter with us and she is as wel­co­me now among us as he is!"</p>
   <p>    Now it was his turn to fe­el re­li­ef that ma­de him sag. "Bles­sed An­ces­tors," he mur­mu­red, pas­sing a hand over his brow. "If you knew what it me­ant to me to he­ar that-" Then he smi­led we­akly. "What am I sa­ying? Of co­ur­se you know."</p>
   <p>    But re­li­ef from one prob­lem didn't help much with the ot­hers, and if this yo­ung wo­man did not ha­ve much ti­me, they ne­eded to ma­ke plans, ur­gently. "Bless you, Las­ha­na. Now- let's de­ci­de bet­we­en us what I can do for you and yo­urs."</p>
   <p>    Gel was not happy with him.</p>
   <p>    "Next ti­me-" Gel mut­te­red un­der his bre­ath. "The next ti­me you go ma­king ha­re-bra­ined me­etings wit­ho­ut me, with wo­men you've ne­ver se­en and don't know anyt­hing abo­ut, I'll ta­ke you to the hor­se-tro­ugh and hold yo­ur he­ad un­der till you co­me to yo­ur sen­ses, I swe­ar!"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian sag­ged aga­inst the back of his cha­ir, but was not go­ing to back down this ti­me. He didn't bla­me his old fri­end-but so­met­hing had told him that Las­ha­na and Gel sho­uldn't me­et, yet. The­re wasn't eno­ugh ti­me to ne­go­ti­ate all of Gel's sus­picions, not and co­me to an un­ders­tan­ding be­fo­re she had to le­ave. An­ces­tors! The dan­ger she had put her­self in by co­ming to him di­rectly! And the dan­ger had inc­re­ased with every mo­ment that pas­sed; the­re was no tel­ling who co­uld ha­ve dis­co­ve­red her the­re.</p>
   <p>    Gel's din­ner sat une­aten in front of him; he had al­re­ady stuf­fed his me­al down his own thro­at as he'd exp­la­ined the mi­rac­le that had hap­pe­ned in that in­cong­ru­o­usly or­di­nary ro­om this af­ter­no­on. "Gel, Mort­he­na was the­re the en­ti­re ti­me-and what co­uld one lit­tle wi­zard-girl pos­sibly do to me?" he as­ked, re­aso­nably.</p>
   <p>    Gel only grow­led. "I sup­po­se you know she co­uld ha­ve be­en tal­king things she's got no aut­ho­rity to pro­mi­se?"</p>
   <p>    "Morthena says she has the aut­ho­rity, and that's go­od eno­ugh for me." His mind was too full of plans now to be put off by Gel's ir­ri­ta­ti­on. His old fri­end was mostly just an­no­yed that, for the first ti­me, he had ma­de plans and for­ged a pact wit­ho­ut Gel's su­per­vi­si­on. "I know what I'm do­ing, Gel," he sa­id, with per­fect con­vic­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Gel lo­oked at him with one eyeb­row ra­ised, then slowly and grud­gingly nod­ded. And his exp­res­si­on chan­ged comp­le­tely. He went from an­ger-to de­fe­at.</p>
   <p>    "I gu­ess you do," he sa­id slowly. "I gu­ess you don't ne­ed me any­mo­re."</p>
   <p>    Now it was his turn to fe­el exas­pe­ra­ted, and he tos­sed his fork down on his pla­te. "Oh for-don't be ri­di­cu­lo­us. I'd as so­on cut off my right hand! Now, lo­ok-we ne­ed to try and think of all pos­sib­le con­tin­gen­ci­es he­re, and ha­ve so­me sort of ske­le­ton in pla­ce if-"</p>
   <p>    There was a tap on the do­or, and Lady Moth po­ked her he­ad in­to the lib­rary. "If I didn't know bet­ter, I'd say you we­re a wi­zard, or el­se you so­me­how co­nj­ured the bag­ga­ge by sa­ying her na­me," she sa­id so­urly. "I se­em to be at­trac­ting all man­ner of vi­si­tors to­day."</p>
   <p>    This ti­me, Kyrti­an knew that the na­me that sprang in­to his mind was the right one. "Oh, no-" he sa­id, gri­ma­cing. "Lady Tri­ana. Just what we ne­ed."</p>

   <p>    Moth! Can you ke­ep the b-Lady Tri­ana oc­cu­pi­ed for a lit­tle?" Kyrti­an as­ked, a lit­tle des­pe­ra­tely. He ran both his hands thro­ugh his ha­ir fran­ti­cal­ly. "I can't see her just yet-"</p>
   <p>    "Oh, pro­bably." Moth's an­no­yan­ce was tur­ning to amu­se­ment. "In fact, I'll ta­ke it as a chal­len­ge. Ob­vi­o­usly you'd bet­ter talk to Gel; I'm su­re he can ad­vi­se you. Be­si­des, you're in no sta­te to en­ter­ta­in a lady-the le­ast you can do is cle­an yo­ur­self up." Moth eyed him with dis­fa­vor. "Be­li­eve me, you'd bet­ter ha­ve yo­ur wits abo­ut you and pre­sent a marb­le fa­ca­de to Lady Tri­ana. I'll go and in­sist she tell me every tiny de­ta­il of every af­fa­ir, qu­ar­rel, and in­con­se­qu­en­ti­al bit of ma­ne­uve­ring among the Gre­at Ho­use­holds whi­le you do so. I've be­en iso­la­ted for so­me ti­me-and ever­yo­ne knows what a ter­rib­le old busy­body I am. If I can't en­ga­ge her, Vi­ri­di­na can."</p>
   <p>    "You are not old," he pro­tes­ted, ear­ning a smi­le. "Thank you."</p>
   <p>    Moth was right; he ne­eded ti­me to get his wits abo­ut him. Whi­le Lady Moth left the lib­rary to ke­ep her vi­si­tor busy with a flo­od of gos­sip-under the ex­cu­se that she ne­eded to be ca­ught up on all the news she had mis­sed whi­le sur­ro­un­ded by the Yo­ung Lords-Kyrti­an had a lot of work to do. And first on his list was to warn the girl that Tri­ana was he­re.</p>
   <p>    But when Kyrti­an got up from the tab­le, Gel fi­nal­ly bro­ke off the con­ver­sa­ti­on with his yo­ung wo­man. Ren­na? Re­an­na? Ren-na­ti, that was it. Both of them lo­oked up as he ap­pro­ac­hed.</p>
   <p>    "I've be­en tel­ling Ren­na­ti that you had a vi­si­tor," Gel be­gan, and Kyrti­an felt a sur­ge of pa­nic, which eased as Gel went on, with a lift of an eyeb­row, "It's a rat­her go­od thing that tho­se po­or mi­su­sed sla­ves that the Yo­ung Lords com­man­de­ered ha­ve realized that no bla­me is go­ing to be at­tac­hed to them and sent one of the­ir num­ber to talk to you."</p>
   <p>    Thank the An­ces­tors he didn't gi­ve her the re­al story yet! Kyrti­an tho­ught, re­li­eved. "Yes, well, you can't bla­me them for wan­ting to send a sort of de­le­ga­te to me to ple­ad the­ir ca­se," he rep­li­ed, men­da­ci­o­usly. "They can't ha­ve re­ali­zed that Lady Moth wo­uld tre­at her hu­man ser­vants exactly the way we tre­at ours. But we've got anot­her vi­si­tor, it se­ems. Lady Moth tells me that Lady Tri­ana has co­me cal­ling."</p>
   <p>    Rennati's fa­ce went de­ad whi­te; that alo­ne wo­uld ha­ve be­en a gi­ve­away that she had be­en co­vertly ser­ving Tri­ana, even if Kyrti­an hadn't al­re­ady known the who­le story. Tri­ana had cho­sen her to­ol very po­orly, on the who­le, if she so re­adily bet­ra­yed her­self by her me­re exp­res­si­ons.</p>
   <p>    But Tri­ana ne­ver re­al­ly tho­ught of hu­mans much, ex­cept as cat's-paws. She pro­bably ne­ver on­ce con­si­de­red that he or Gel-or an­yo­ne that mat­te­red!-wo­uld be aro­und to see her re­ac­ti­on if Tri­ana's na­me was men­ti­oned.</p>
   <p>    But Gel im­me­di­ately put his we­at­he­red paw over her slim hand, and sa­id gruffly, "Now, Ren­na­ti-she ne­edn't even know you're he­re-"</p>
   <p>    "On the cont­rary," Kyrti­an sa­id firmly, "I want Tri­ana to know she's he­re. In fact, I ha­ve so­met­hing in mind-it might be a lit­tle hu­mi­li­ating for you," he con­ti­nu­ed, tur­ning to the girl, "but if you can we­at­her a bit of hu­mi­li­ati­on, I think we can turn her at­ten­ti­on away from you comp­le­tely and for all ti­me, if you'll co­ope­ra­te."</p>
   <p>    He exp­la­ined what he wan­ted her to do, and alt­ho­ugh the girl flus­hed with em­bar­ras­sment, and Gel grow­led over the plan, they both even­tu­al­ly ag­re­ed it was the only pos­sib­le so­lu­ti­on. "She'll pro­bably cor­ner you at so­me po­int this eve­ning, if only to get her te­le­son-ring back," he ca­uti­oned. "I think we can ma­na­ge to in­ter­rupt that conf­ron­ta­ti­on be­fo­re she can do anyt­hing to you, but you know, if she do­es ta­ke back the ring, it will ef­fec­ti­vely se­ver all con­tact with you and show that she's got no mo­re in­te­rest in you."</p>
   <p>    And if what Las­ha­na told me is true, we can al­so ex­pect to have a de­vi­ce to comp­le­tely ne­ut­ra­li­ze the col­lar she pla­ced on you in a day or so, he tho­ught, but did not say alo­ud. That was a sec­ret he wis­hed to ke­ep to him­self un­til Lady Tri­ana was long go­ne.</p>
   <p>    Rennati nod­ded, and lic­ked her lips. "I think that wo­uld be best, my lord," she whis­pe­red, as Gel squ­e­ezed her hand com­for­tingly. "I'll go to my qu­ar­ters and pre­pa­re."</p>
   <p>    "And I'd bet­ter go to mi­ne," Kyrti­an sa­id, stif­ling a gro­an. He left the two of them alo­ne; no do­ubt Gel, who had de­li­ve­red en­co­ura­ging spe­ec­hes to figh­ters in the past, co­uld find the words to put co­ura­ge in­to this lit­tle dan­cer's he­art.</p>
   <p>    He didn't ha­ve a gre­at de­al of clot­hing with him su­itab­le for for­mal oc­ca­si­ons but he had the run of Lady Moth's man­si­on, and as­ked her ser­vants to rum­ma­ge thro­ugh the clo­sets of her la­te hus­band's ward­ro­be and se­lect so­met­hing ap­prop­ri­ate. He wor­ked a lit­tle judi­ci­o­us use of ma­gic to adj­ust the fit of the so­ber, black silk and sil­ver out­fit they bro­ught him, and it ma­de him pre­sen­tab­le eno­ugh. He des­cen­ded from the se­cond-flo­or gu­est qu­ar­ters to Lady Moth's dra­wing ro­om lo­oking (he ho­ped) li­ke the suc­ces­sful, but no-non­sen­se, mi­li­tary com­man­der he was.</p>
   <p>    The la­di­es bro­ke off the­ir con­ver­sa­ti­on as he en­te­red the spa­ci­o­us, pa­le-pink and gold cham­ber; Lady Vi­ri­di­na and Lady Moth flan­ked Lady Tri­ana, perc­hed on de­li­ca­te cha­irs on eit­her si­de of the so­fa that Tri­ana oc­cu­pi­ed.</p>
   <p>    If wo­men's clot­hing ser­ved as a we­apon-and gi­ven all that Kyrti­an knew abo­ut Tri­ana, the­re was no do­ubt in his mind that for her, it did-then Lady Tri­ana had co­me ar­med to the te­eth. Not­hing abo­ut her cos­tu­me was ex­ces­si­ve, the­re was not­hing abo­ut it that any ot­her lady co­uld ta­ke ex­cep­ti­on to-except that the flesh-co­lo­red silk of her gown, tho­ugh it co­ve­red her li­te­ral­ly from neck to knee, co­uld not ha­ve re­ve­aled mo­re of her un­less she'd be­en stark na­ked. But the ef­fect was oh! so subt­le; the silk was he­avy, not thin, and her charms we­re disc­lo­sed by im­per­cep­tib­le deg­re­es as she mo­ved. The co­lor cont­ri­bu­ted to the ef­fect, and kno­wing what he knew now abo­ut the lady, Kyrti­an co­uldn't help but ad­mi­re her tac­ti­cal ex­per­ti­se on her own bat­tle­fi­eld.</p>
   <p>    That did not, ho­we­ver, me­an he in­ten­ded to fall vic­tim to it.</p>
   <p>    He half-bo­wed to all three la­di­es, then to­ok a step for­ward and ma­de a mo­re for­mal bow over Tri­ana's hand. "Lady Tri­ana, I ha­ve he­ard a gre­at de­al in pra­ise of you," he sa­id, ke­eping the irony out of his vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    "Likewise, Lord Kyrti­an," she rep­li­ed. "Most es­pe­ci­al­ly from my fri­end, Lord Kyndreth. So much so that when I he­ard you we­re he­re with Lady Mort­he­na, I tho­ught I wo­uld tres­pass on her hos­pi­ta­lity and co­me to see you myself."</p>
   <p>    Very ni­ce. Drop Kyndreth's na­me so that I know I can't just dis­miss you out of hand, then turn on yo­ur charm. She was cer­ta­inly do­ing all of that, and the ama­zing part was that it was not at all bla­tant. If he'd be­en the na­ive fel­low he was when he'd first ta­ken on com­mand of the army, he pro­bably wo­uld ha­ve fal­len di­rectly for her. Kyrti­an had al­ways be­en inc­li­ned to gi­ve pe­op­le the be­ne­fit of the do­ubt un­til he met them him­self; if he'd do­ne that with Tri­ana he wo­uld ha­ve be­en cer­ta­in that she co­uld not be as bad as she'd be­en pa­in­ted.</p>
   <p>    So, let me think, what sho­uld my re­ac­ti­on be? He re­al­ly didn't want very much ex­cept to see the back of her; he do­ub­ted that the­re was very much he co­uld le­arn from her, and frankly, the­re was far too much that she co­uld le­arn from, or abo­ut him if she sta­yed very long. "I do ho­pe that I am not a bit­ter di­sap­po­int­ment to you, but I fe­ar that most pe­op­le find me qu­ite bo­ring," he sa­id bluntly. "And they ge­ne­ral­ly tell me so to my fa­ce. I don't cul­ti­va­te any in­te­rests out­si­de of the bat­tle­fi­eld, my lady, and at the mo­ment, I can't af­ford to."</p>
   <p>    That to­ok her aback for a mo­ment; he watc­hed her as she tri­ed to think of so­met­hing flat­te­ring to say that wo­uldn't so­und li­ke flat­tery. "Well, sin­ce I ha­ven't he­ard you spe­ak mo­re than a few sen­ten­ces, I'm not in any po­si­ti­on to jud­ge!" she rep­li­ed, with a thro­aty la­ugh that pro­bably sto­le the bre­ath of many an imp­res­si­onab­le lad.</p>
   <p>    "It won't ta­ke you very long to ve­rify," was his reply, brus­que to the po­int of ru­de­ness. Then he was sa­ved from furt­her ple­asant­ri­es by the ser­vant co­me to an­no­un­ce din­ner-to which, of co­ur­se, Tri­ana was of ne­ces­sity in­vi­ted. She wo­uld ha­ve to stay the night as well, sin­ce she had co­me the way any uninvited gu­est wo­uld ha­ve-over­land, from the ne­arest po­int to which she had a Por­tal key. Pos­sibly Kyndreth him­self had got­ten her as far as the army camp, which was qu­ite ne­ar eno­ugh for an easy day's ri­de. If she was on any kind of terms with Kyndreth, he wo­uld ha­ve fo­und that an easy thing to do.</p>
   <p>    Which me­ant that it co­uld be Kyndreth, and not Ael­mar­kin, that she was wor­king with.</p>
   <p>    Or both. Gi­ven what the El­ven­ba­ne had told him abo­ut Kyndreth, the­re was very lit­tle do­ubt in his mind that the mo­ment his erstw­hi­le be­ne­fac­tor saw him as a pos­sib­le ri­val, he wo­uld be eli­mi­na­ted-and that, of co­ur­se, pla­yed right in­to Ael-mar­kin's plans. So, it didn't mat­ter whet­her she was wor­king for his co­usin or the Gre­at Lord, what he had to do was to pa­int him­self as ut­terly un­li­kely to en­ga­ge in po­li­tics-the bluff sol­di­er, hap­pi­est when on the bat­tle­fi­eld.</p>
   <p>    Very well; now he had his co­ur­se of ac­ti­on. Moth had or­de­red din­ner in an in­ti­ma­te set­ting; that su­ited him very well. Over the co­ur­se of the me­al, he wor­ked hard to es­tab­lish him­self as a mo­no­ma­ni­ac, ob­ses­sed with war and tac­tics pri­ma­rily-and se­con­da­rily with dis­co­ve­ring the whe­re­abo­uts of his fat­her, or at le­ast, his fat­her's fa­te. Every hint that he might- on­ce the Co­un­cil had de­ci­ded they ne­eded his ser­vi­ces as a com­man­der no lon­ger-se­ek a Co­un­cil se­at was re­buf­fed. "Ne­ver!" he sa­id at last when she stop­ped hin­ting and sug­ges­ted it out­right. "It'd dri­ve me mad in a day. I'd rat­her ta­ke up flo­wer-sculp­ting! At le­ast the flo­wers wo­uldn't ar­gue with me!" And that was very much to Tri­ana's surp­ri­se, tho­ugh in­te­res­tingly eno­ugh, not to her dis­com­fi­tu­re. In fact, on­ce he es­tab­lis­hed that co­ur­se, she en­co­ura­ged it.</p>
   <p>    "In that ca­se-well, yo­ur tra­ining met­hods cer­ta­inly work won­ders with the gla­di­ato­ri­al sla­ves," she sa­id smo­othly. "Per­haps, if you aren't in­te­res­ted in bre­eding them yo­ur­self, you co­uld es­tab­lish a tra­ining scho­ol in con­cert with a bre­eder."</p>
   <p>    "I might." Then he threw her anot­her men­tal puz­zle to chew on. "Of co­ur­se," he con­ti­nu­ed pom­po­usly, "as long as tho­se wretc­hed Wi­zards are in exis­ten­ce, the Co­un­cil will re­qu­ire the army to ex­ter­mi­na­te them, and they'll ne­ed me to le­ad that army. They may ha­ve be­en cle­ver tac­ti­ci­ans com­pa­red to- well, I won't men­ti­on na­mes-but I'm bet­ter."</p>
   <p>    Thanks to Las­ha­na, he knew what she didn't-that two long-held El­ven­lords had just be­en tur­ned lo­ose in the vi­ci­nity of Lord Chey­nar's es­ta­te, with fal­se me­mo­ri­es of be­ing held by a se­cond, en­ti­rely unk­nown gro­up of Wi­zards hid­den in the stran­ge hills and fo­rests so­mew­he­re ne­ar the­re. He knew that on­ce the Co­un­cil le­ar­ned of the­se spe­ci­o­us Wi­zards so ne­ar them, the­re wo­uld be pa­nic. And he wo­uld be cal­led on to find them.</p>
   <p>    Especially if Tri­ana bro­ught word of his hub­ris to Kyndreth or Ael­mar­kin or both. For Kyndreth, sen­ding him on a hunt for the­se Wi­zards was a win­ning stra­tegy all aro­und. If they de­fe­ated him, he wo­uld al­most cer­ta­inly die-in the past the Wi­zards had ma­de kil­ling the El­ven com­man­ders a key part of the­ir stra­tegy, and that wasn't li­kely to chan­ge. If he de­fe­ated them, Kyndreth wo­uld get the cre­dit, and he co­uld be def­lec­ted back in­to the hunt for his fat­her's fa­te. For Ael­mar­kin, well, do­ubt­less his co­usin wo­uld ho­pe for his de­fe­at, and bi­de his ti­me.</p>
   <p>    When Kyndreth he­ard his plan for fin­ding the ima­gi­nary Wi­zards, he'd be do­ubly ple­ased…</p>
   <p>    "Pardon, my lord," sa­id one of Moth's "sla­ves" in as for­mal and stiff a man­ner as even the most pro­to­col-obses­sed El­ven-lord co­uld ha­ve wis­hed, "but the mat­ter you wis­hed to at­tend to-the sla­ves you re­qu­es­ted ha­ve be­en bro­ught, and are awa­iting yo­ur ple­asu­re."</p>
   <p>    The lad al­most ga­ve him­self away; Kyrti­an ca­ught the twink­le in his eye, but his own so­ber exp­res­si­on, only ba­rely ligh­te­ned with do­ur ple­asu­re, kept the li­ve­ri­ed ser­vant from lo­sing his com­po­su­re. "I beg yo­ur par­don, my lady," he sa­id to Tri­ana, "but I had ar­ran­ged for a cer­ta­in mat­ter to be de­alt with at din­ner this eve­ning, and I didn't think to can­cel my or­ders. I am su­re you won't mind my at­ten­ding to it."</p>
   <p>    "What-a chas­ti­se­ment?" For just a mo­ment the­re was an avi­dity in her eyes that ma­de him sick. Thank the An­ces­tors I was war­ned aga­inst her-</p>
   <p>    "No, my lady-a re­ward, ac­tu­al­ly." He tur­ned to Moth's sla­ve, stiff in his for­mal li­very. "Ha­ve them bro­ught in."</p>
   <p>    The lad bo­wed; a mo­ment la­ter, in ca­me Gel, es­cor­ted by two of the figh­ters, fol­lo­wed by Ren­na­ti, es­cor­ted by a pa­ir of Moth's hand­ma­idens. All hu­mans, of co­ur­se-</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian al­lo­wed him­self a smi­le. "Sar­ge­ant Gel," he sa­id, in the most over­be­aring man­ner pos­sib­le, "you ha­ve dis­tin­gu­is­hed yo­ur­self in my ser­vi­ce for ye­ars, but in this cam­pa­ign aga­inst the re­bels, you truly ha­ve outs­ho­ne any ot­her sla­ve in my pos­ses­si­on. I am lo­ath to lo­se you; ho­we­ver, I am even mo­re lo­ath to lo­se such a pa­tently ex­cel­lent blo­od­li­ne. I ha­ve de­ci­ded to re­ti­re you-and to en­su­re that yo­ur li­ne con­ti­nu­es, and pro­vi­des me with mo­re outs­tan­ding figh­ters and tac­ti­ci­ans in the fu­tu­re, I am pre­sen­ting you with this hand­so­me wench as yo­ur ma­te." He ges­tu­red, and the two hand­ma­idens us­he­red Ren­na­ti for­ward. The po­or child was blus­hing fu­ri­o­usly, cas­ting her eyes down. Gel had ma­na­ged to cont­ri­ve an exp­res­si­on of ut­ter dumb­fo­un­ded­ness. "She's qu­ite a lit­tle ath­le­te in her own right-" he la­ug­hed co­ar­sely "-which sho­uld comp­le­ment yo­ur own at­tri­bu­tes, and I'm su­re that pro­vi­ding me with mo­re of yo­ur stock will be a ple­asu­re to you, gi­ven her ex­per­ti­se and ac­comp­lish­ments."</p>
   <p>    Gel drop­ped his eyes, and went stiffly to one knee, and from the way that his neck had red­de­ned, Kyrti­an knew that it was only the full know­led­ge that this in­sul­ting spe­ech was me­ant for Tri­ana's be­ne­fit alo­ne that kept his old fri­end from exp­lo­ding with ra­ge. "Thank you, my gra­ci­o­us lord," Gel got out thro­ugh clenc­hed te­eth. For­tu­na­tely, with his he­ad bo­wed, it so­un­ded sin­ce­re and humb­le. "I can ne­ver be worthy of this ho­nor-"</p>
   <p>    "Well, go ta­ke the girl and see abo­ut re­war­ding my ge­ne­ro­sity as qu­ickly as pos­sib­le," Kyrti­an sa­id airily, wa­ving a dis­mis­si­ve hand. Gel got up, to­ok Ren­na­ti's limp and un­re­sis­ting hand in his own, and rat­her ab­ruptly ha­uled her away, fol­lo­wed by the rest of the "sla­ves."</p>
   <p>    Oh, I'm go­ing to pay for this the next ti­me we prac­ti­ce.</p>
   <p>    He tur­ned to Tri­ana, who­se fa­ce was a study in shock. "Ni­ce lit­tle dan­cer my mot­her bo­ught for me," he sa­id dis­mis­si­vely. "Knows her bu­si­ness. Per­fect to ma­ke su­re the old fel­low can do his duty by her and by me-I can gu­aran­tee she's be­en well tra­ined. On top of that, she's got a fan­tas­tic physi­que and reflexes. If I don't get a set of un­be­li­evab­le body­gu­ards out of tho­se two, I'll eat my bo­ots wit­ho­ut sa­uce." Then he pre­ten­ded be­la­tedly to see Tri­ana's stun­ned exp­res­si­on. "Oh, yo­ur par­don,' my lady-I ho­pe I didn't shock you by be­ing so frank, but I un­ders­to­od you we­re a bre­eder of so­me no­te-"</p>
   <p>    She qu­ickly got hold of her­self, and smi­led fal­sely. "Oh, you didn't shock me in the le­ast, my lord," she rep­li­ed. "I was just con­temp­la­ting what the re­sults of that ma­ting are li­kely to be. Splen­did body­gu­ards, no do­ubt-but for­gi­ve me for ho­ping that the stock ta­kes af­ter her lo­oks, rat­her than his!" She pro­du­ced anot­her of tho­se low, bre­athy la­ughs. "You will re­call that I bre­ed for est­he­tics!"</p>
   <p>    "Of co­ur­se, of co­ur­se." He then tur­ned the con­ver­sa­ti­on to so­met­hing el­se, and even­tu­al­ly the din­ner gro­und its way to its fi­na­le.</p>
   <p>    He left the la­di­es, as was the cus­tom, to conc­lu­de the­ir eve­ning to­get­her over swe­et wi­nes and con­ver­sa­ti­on, bles­sing the cus­tom for al­lo­wing him to es­ca­pe the tab­le be­fo­re Tri­ana.</p>
   <p>    She wo­uld, wit­ho­ut a sha­dow of a do­ubt, try to get at Ren-na­ti. But it wo­uldn't hap­pen to­night, and it wo­uldn't hap­pen on her terms. It wo­uld be to­mor­row-at the ti­me and pla­ce that Kyrti­an had pic­ked.</p>
   <p>    The pa­le pink marb­le hal­lway out­si­de Lady Tri­ana's gu­est-su­ite lo­oked, Kyrti­an ref­lec­ted with no lit­tle amu­se­ment, as if they had plan­ned an am­bush for the el­ven lady. In a sen­se, they had. Ren­na­ti wa­ited in a marb­le-pa­ne­led nic­he clo­se to the do­or. A lit­tle fart­her along, be­hind a se­cond bron­ze do­or left just the ti­ni­est bit open, Lady Vi­ri­di­na wa­ited. And fart­her still, watc­hing from the end of the hal­lway, be­hind the pa­ne­led do­or to one of the sit­ting-ro­oms, was Kyrti­an him­self. If Tri­ana ga­ve the lit­tle dan­cer too much tro­ub­le, Lady Vi­ri­di­na wo­uld ap­pe­ar-and if Vi­ri­di­na's pre­sen­ce didn't gi­ve Ren­na­ti a chan­ce to es­ca­pe, he wo­uld put in an ap­pe­aran­ce and cla­im "his" sla­ve.</p>
   <p>    The do­ors ma­de no so­und as they ope­ned, of co­ur­se, and the only clue he had that Tri­ana had fi­nal­ly emer­ged was the soft pat­ter of Ren­na­ti's fo­ots­teps on the he­avy car­pet.</p>
   <p>    "My lady, I beg yo­ur fa­vor!" Ren­na­ti's high, cle­ar vo­ice, with a hint of des­pe­ra­ti­on in it, rang down the hal­lway. A lit­tle judi­ci­o­us ma­gic al­lo­wed him to he­ar every word as she ap-' pro­ac­hed the el­ven lady.</p>
   <p>    "My lady," Ren­na­ti re­pe­ated, as she flung her­self to her kne­es be­si­de the wa­iting Tri­ana, who had pa­used be­si­de the open do­or. "My lady, for­gi­ve me-I fa­iled you-I know I ha­ve fa­iled you-"</p>
   <p>    "Indeed you ha­ve," Tri­ana sa­id, in a le­vel vo­ice. "The in­for­ma­ti­on you ga­ve to me was of lit­tle use. You we­re ne­ar Lord Kyrti­an only on­ce, and that bri­efly. And now he has tur­ned you in­to a me­re bre­eder, which will re­mo­ve you from the ho­use­hold al­to­get­her and oc­cupy yo­ur ti­me with things of no in­te­rest to me. I am not ple­ased."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian pe­eked thro­ugh a crack whe­re the do­or met the fra­me. Ren­na­ti bent her he­ad, tremb­ling with fe­ar. The po­or child wasn't ac­ting, she re­al­ly was af­ra­id of Tri­ana. It was ter­ribly bra­ve of her to ta­ke this step, but it was the only pos­sib­le way for her to es­ca­pe Tri­ana's to­ils, and both she and Kyrti­an knew it. "I had no cho­ice, my lady," Ren­na­ti rep­li­ed humbly. "I am only a sla­ve; I ha­ve no cont­rol over how I am dis­po­sed of."</p>
   <p>    "Hmph." Kyrti­an to­ok anot­her ca­uti­o­us pe­ek; Tri­ana sto­od over Ren­na­ti lo­oking down at the girl with a me­asu­re of dis­gust. "If you'd had an oun­ce or two mo­re of am­bi­ti­on-" She sho­ok her he­ad. "I do not re­ward in­com­pe­ten­ce, girl. A go­od part of yo­ur fa­ilu­re is yo­ur own fa­ult. You did not ma­ke yo­ur­self in­dis­pen­sab­le to Lord Kyrti­an."</p>
   <p>    "Yes, my lady." Ren­na­ti co­uldn't ha­ve got­ten any lo­wer to the gro­und wit­ho­ut prost­ra­ting her­self.</p>
   <p>    Triana prod­ded at the dan­cer with her fo­ot. "You've ma­na­ged to ma­ne­uver yo­ur­self in­to yo­ur own pu­nish­ment, fo­ol. You'll be not­hing mo­re than a bre­eder for the rest of yo­ur li­fe. And bred to that hi­de­o­us old man! You can ex­pect to be be­aten when you don't ple­ase him, and ta­ken li­ke an ani­mal when you do. On the who­le, I must say I co­uldn't ha­ve cont­ri­ved anyt­hing bet­ter as chas­ti­se­ment." She la­ug­hed, a cru­el la­ugh that ma­de even Kyrti­an shi­ver. "I trust he'll ma­ke you su­itably mi­se­rab­le. Now, you ha­ve so­met­hing of mi­ne, I be­li­eve?" She put out her hand.</p>
   <p>    Rennati, sha­king li­ke a wil­low in a winds­torm, pul­led the teleson-ring from her fin­ger and ma­na­ged to pla­ce it in Tri­ana's palm. Tri­ana slip­ped the ring on her own fin­ger, spur­ned the dan­cer with her fo­ot, pus­hing her off-ba­lan­ce so that she spraw­led clum­sily on­to the car­pet. With a fi­nal, nasty chuck­le, Tri­ana stal­ked off.</p>
   <p>    Rennati lay whe­re she'd fal­len, sha­king vi­olently, un­til Tri­ana was out of sight; Kyrti­an and Vi­ri­di­na re­ma­ined in hi­ding as well. On­ce they we­re both su­re she was go­ne, they both rus­hed out in­to the hall-</p>
   <p>    Only to find that Ren­na­ti was sha­king, not with fe­ar or in te­ars, but with the we­ak la­ugh­ter of re­li­ef. Kyrti­an hel­ped her to her fe­et, and Vi­ri­di­na fus­sed over her for a mo­ment-a stran­ge sight, that; an el­ven lady se­e­ing to the wel­fa­re of a me­re hu­man!</p>
   <p>    "I'm all right, re­al­ly I am," Ren­na­ti pro­tes­ted at last. "Thank you, my lady, thank you for be­ing so clo­se-but I am all right. I was only af­ra­id that if eit­her of you had to in­ter­ve­ne, she wo­uld sen­se so­met­hing wasn't qu­ite right."</p>
   <p>    "You did won­der­ful­ly well, yo­ung lady," Kyrti­an told her ap­pro­vingly. "Won­der­ful­ly well. I co­uldn't ha­ve as­ked for bet­ter. I must say that you've shown an abi­lity to play-act that I hadn't ex­pec­ted."</p>
   <p>    "I was af­ra­id I was go­ing to start la­ug­hing when she desc­ri­bed po­or Gel," Ren­na­ti told him, dimp­ling and co­lo­ring pret­tily. "She co­uldn't ha­ve be­en mo­re wrong abo­ut him-"</p>
   <p>    "And it's just as well that she do­esn't know that. It's my turn to apo­lo­gi­ze for put­ting you thro­ugh all that em­bar­ras­sment now, and last night," he con­ti­nu­ed, "and I ho­pe you'll for­gi­ve me for it."</p>
   <p>    "Only if you-" she co­lo­red mo­re de­eply. "Only if you- don't ta­ke back what you sa­id-abo­ut me and Gel-"</p>
   <p>    "My de­ar child, that is bet­we­en you and Gel!" he exc­la­imed, hol­ding up both hands in mock-de­fen­se, as both Ren­na­ti and Vi­ri­di­na gig­gled li­ke a pa­ir of yo­ung girls. "I ha­ve not­hing to do with it! If you ha­ve the auda­city to col­lar and ta­me that wretc­hed man, you may ha­ve joy of him!"</p>
   <p>    Stifling the­ir la­ugh­ter in the­ir hands, Vi­ri­di­na and Ren­na­ti ret­re­ated in­to Vi­ri­di­na's su­ite-for so­me wo­ma­nish re­ason, he had no do­ubt, per­haps to plan the con­qu­est of po­or Gel! Ah, Gel, you wretc­hed man, you ha­ven't a pra­yer aga­inst them! Wha­te­ver it was, the im­por­tant mis­si­on had be­en ac­comp­lis­hed; Tri­ana no lon­ger had a spy in his ho­use­hold, and it was va­nis­hingly li­kely that she'd get anot­her in the­re. Now he co­uld con­ti­nue with his own lib­rary se­arch, and wa­it for the two "lost" El­ven­lords to be fo­und, for the Co­un­cil to le­arn of the "new Wi­zards" and for the pa­nic to be­gin.</p>
   <p>    Triana left that very day, and no one, le­ast of all Kyrti­an, was sorry to see her le­ave, alt­ho­ugh Lady Moth ma­na­ged to con­vey the op­po­si­te. With Tri­ana's de­par­tu­re, everyt­hing went back to "nor­mal."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian, ho­we­ver, ga­ve up trying to use Ren­na­ti and Gel as his hel­pers. Ins­te­ad, he com­man­de­ered a co­up­le of the sla­ves that had be­en li­be­ra­ted from the Yo­ung Lords, a pa­ir of re­mar­kably in­tel­li­gent twins. Bred and tra­ined to be ho­use­hold sla­ves, not hand­so­me eno­ugh to be put to "front of the ho­use" du­ti­es, they had be­en was­ted both on the me­ni­al tasks they'd be­en as­sig­ned and as the figh­ters that the Yo­ung Lords wan­ted them to be. They qu­ickly le­ar­ned what he wan­ted of them, and as they had be­en ta­ught to re­ad and wri­te, we­re so­on ac­tu­al­ly hel­ping him with his hunt for in­for­ma­ti­on. On­ce he had iden­ti­fi­ed the aut­hor of jo­ur­nals that we­re too la­te to be of any in­te­rest to him, the boys co­uld pick thro­ugh the re­ma­ining vo­lu­mes and eli­mi­na­te any mo­re by the sa­me aut­hor. As they shel­ved the­se bo­oks, the task in front of him be­gan to lo­ok a bit less da­un­ting.</p>
   <p>    Meanwhile Ren­na­ti had evi­dently ta­ken him at his word; she was the "aggres­sor" in this co­urts­hip, and in Kyrti­an's opi­ni­on, Gel might just as well run up the flag of sur­ren­der, be­ca­use he hadn't a chan­ce in the world. Not that he se­emed to be un­hap­py abo­ut the pros­pect. But it was cer­ta­inly an odd thing to see to­ugh old Gel wan­de­ring abo­ut the gar­dens, eyes fa­intly clo­uded with be­mu­se­ment, hol­ding a bas­ket for the flo­wers Ren­na­ti was se­lec­ting to gra­ce the va­ses of Lady Moth's cham­bers.</p>
   <p>    Three days pas­sed, then fo­ur, and the­re was no sign that the two "lost Lords" had yet be­en dis­co­ve­red. On the one hand, Kyrti­an was per­fectly happy with this, sin­ce it ga­ve him mo­re ti­me among the bo­oks.</p>
   <p>    On the ot­her hand, he grew mo­re an­xi­o­us with every day that pas­sed, for the­re was no tel­ling what Lord Kyndreth and the Co­un­cil we­re up to, what they we­re thin­king, and per­haps most im­por­tantly of all, whet­her Tri­ana had be­en con­vin­ced that he was not am­bi­ti­o­us for a pla­ce on the Grand Co­un­cil as a Gre­at Lord. Only if she was con­vin­ced wo­uld she in turn con­vin­ce Kyndreth.</p>
   <p>    There was no furt­her sign from the El­ven­ba­ne, eit­her, but Kyrti­an didn't truly ex­pect anyt­hing. It had be­en ter­ribly risky for her to co­me to him; it wo­uld be bet­ter for the next me­eting to ta­ke pla­ce so­mew­he­re in the wil­der­ness, per­haps whi­le he pur­su­ed the fal­se Wi­zards.</p>
   <p>    Then, on the fo­urth day af­ter Tri­ana left, ca­me the sum­mons to the te­le­son that he had be­en wa­iting for. It to­ok all of his self-cont­rol to ma­in­ta­in a cu­ri­o­us, but calm exp­res­si­on when he gre­eted Lord Kyndreth's ima­ge in the flat glass.</p>
   <p>    "Something en­ti­rely unex­pec­ted has co­me up, my Lord," Kyndreth sa­id, in to­nes of cont­rol­led ur­gency. "Two mi­nor El-ven­lords that we tho­ught had so­me­how be­en kil­led on a hun­ting ex­pe­di­ti­on de­ca­des ago ha­ve tur­ned up. They we­re fo­und by two of Lord Chey­nar's sla­ves and bro­ught stra­ight to his ma­nor, and the­ir story-well, it's ter­rif­ying."</p>
   <p>    Ancestors! They ma­na­ged to walk all the way from the fo­rest to the es­ta­te? They must ha­ve be­en ex­ha­us­ted!</p>
   <p>    "Where we­re they all this ti­me?" Kyrti­an as­ked, ca­re­ful­ly as­su­ming an exp­res­si­on of con­cern. "I know that fo­rest has an evil re­pu­ta­ti­on, but how co­uld they ha­ve be­en lost for de­ca­des?"</p>
   <p>    "They say that they we­re held as pri­so­ners by Wi­zards," Kyndreth con­ti­nu­ed, "and the ac­ci­dent of a rock­fall in the ca­ves whe­re they we­re held is what al­lo­wed them to es­ca­pe. The­re is only one prob­lem-the Wi­zards that held them are not the Wi­zards with whom we fo­ught!"</p>
   <p>    "Ancestors!" Kyrti­an exc­la­imed, fal­ling back a lit­tle in fe­ig­ned shock. "But-that's ter­rib­le!"</p>
   <p>    "It is, and the Co­un­cil was in an up­ro­ar abo­ut it," Kyndreth rep­li­ed with vi­sib­le un­hap­pi­ness. "We ha­ve to find the­se cre­atu­res and eli­mi­na­te them. If they are la­ired up so­mew­he­re wit­hin stri­king dis­tan­ce of Chey­nar's es­ta­te-"</p>
   <p>    "Then they are too clo­se, ho­we­ver few in num­ber they may be," Kyrti­an sa­id firmly. "I will de­al with the mat­ter, my Lord. This is pre­ci­sely the sort of thing my per­so­nal sla­ves are tra­ined for. We will ta­ke a small for­ce in­to the fo­rest to find the pla­ce, then re­turn with a lar­ger one and wi­pe them out."</p>
   <p>    "I knew I co­uld rely on you," Kyndreth sa­id, with evi­dent re­li­ef, and bro­ke the con­nec­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    With a la­ugh, Kyrti­an le­apt to his fe­et, fe­eling very li­ke a ra­ce­hor­se fi­nal­ly let lo­ose-now he co­uld show what he was re­al­ly ma­de of; this might ha­ve be­en what he had be­en tra­ining for all of his li­fe.</p>
   <p>    And let Kyndreth and the ot­hers sche­me as they wo­uld, for he was fi­nal­ly on the right si­de.</p>

   <p>    Kyrtian’s own es­ta­te was ro­ughly half­way bet­we­en Moth s pro­perty and Lord Chey­nar's, aro­und the pe­ri­me­ter of the rag­ged circ­le de­fi­ned by the outer­most El­ven­lord es­ta­tes. Alt­ho­ugh it might ha­ve be­en shor­ter to cut thro­ugh the he­art of el­ven lands, it was qu­ic­ker to ta­ke Moth's Por­tal to his own pro­perty, se­lect the men he wan­ted, and go from the­re to the ne­arest es­ta­te with a Por­tal that he co­uld get ac­cess to. In this ca­se, it was the es­ta­te of the la­te un­la­men­ted Lord Dyran, which had even­tu­al­ly wo­und up in the hands of Lord Kyndreth. Dyran's es­ta­te bor­de­red on the de­sert; Chey­nar's, bet­we­en Dyran's land and the rest of the el­ven-held world, was in well-wa­te­red hills that ran up to low, fo­res­ted mo­un­ta­ins that we­re equ­al­ly well wa­te­red. So much wa­ter, in fact, that the es­ta­te spent most of the win­ter shro­uded in grey clo­uds that driz­zled con­ti­nu­o­usly. The­re co­uld not ha­ve be­en a gre­ater cont­rast in ter­ri­tory, but that wasn't the most in­te­res­ting part. The in­te­resting part was, be­ne­ath tho­se hills and mo­un­ta­ins-ca­ves, and a gre­at many of them.</p>
   <p>    Going ho­me first al­so al­lo­wed him to ta­ke Ren­na­ti back to the es­ta­te. That to­ok one bur­den off his mind and wo­uld gi­ve him an ex­cu­se to le­ave Gel as well. Not that he didn't want Gel along-but this wo­uld not be a mis­si­on whe­re Gel's ex­per­ti­se was ne­eded. Gi­ven that he co­uld not be at ho­me, he wan­ted so­me­one he trus­ted to be the­re. Lady Lydi­ell was cle­ver and cun­ning, but she was no sol­di­er. If sol­di­ers we­re ne­eded, Gel co­uld com­mand as well, if not bet­ter, than Kyrti­an.</p>
   <p>    As for his own tro­ops, tho­se who we­re left we­re by this ti­me he­ar­tily ti­red of re­al war­fa­re and re­ady to go back to the farm, fi­eld, and ho­use­hold po­si­ti­ons they had left. It was ti­me to ta­ke them ho­me, too-and by the gre­atest of go­od for­tu­ne, he wo­uld be ta­king all of them ho­me. The­re had be­en only mi­nor ca­su­al­ti­es among his own pe­op­le, no de­aths at all, and tho­se inj­uri­es they sus­ta­ined we­re ne­it­her crip­pling nor in­ca­pa­ci­ta­ting. That was not by ac­ci­dent or en­ti­rely by go­od for­tu­ne alo­ne; Kyrti­an's men, with the­ir gre­ater ex­per­ti­se in figh­ting than the Yo­ung Lords' consc­ripts, had shown the­ir cle­ar su­pe­ri­ority in the fi­eld in all ways.</p>
   <p>    He was ter­ribly pro­ud of them. The po­int was, they we­ren't pro­fes­si­onal, tra­ined figh­ters; they we­re fan­ners, ho­use-ser­vants, her­ders. But they had ap­pli­ed them­sel­ves with will and ent­hu­si­asm to his tra­ining, and when cal­led on to use that tra­ining, they had do­ne so with all the de­di­ca­ti­on he co­uld ha­ve as­ked for.</p>
   <p>    He didn't qu­ite know how to re­ward them; the kind of gre­at fe­ast he usu­al­ly held for a suc­ces­sful "cam­pa­ign" was wo­eful­ly ina­de­qu­ate as a re­com­pen­se. And as he shep­her­ded the last of his pe­op­le thro­ugh Moth's Por­tal, he ma­de a men­tal no­te to ask his mot­her her opi­ni­on. Of all pe­op­le, she su­rely sho­uld ha­ve so­me no­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Finally the­re we­re only the three of them left to cross-him­self, Gel, and Ren­na­ti. And as he watc­hed the ot­her two wa­iting pa­ti­ently for the Por­tal to cle­ar, with Gel's arm openly and pro­tec­ti­vely aro­und the ap­pre­hen­si­ve lit­tle dan­cer, he knew with considerable amu­se­ment that the­re was at le­ast one per­son he had had no dif­fi­culty in fit­ting a re­ward to. The­re had be­en a gra­in of truth in that pom­po­us and inc­re­dibly in­sul­ting lit­tle spe­ech he'd ma­de in front of Lady Tri­ana; he re­al­ly did ho­pe that Gel wo­uld ha­ve a son-or se­ve­ral-to tra­in to ta­ke the fat­her's pla­ce at Kyrti­an's si­de. No one co­uld ha­ve had a bet­ter body­gu­ard-or fri­end-and Kyrti­an was not lo­oking for­ward to the day when he wo­uld ha­ve to tell Gel to stand down and let anot­her ta­ke his pla­ce. But li­ke it or not, the fact was that un­less so­met­hing hap­pe­ned to him, Kyrti­an wo­uld li­kely be ser­ved by Gel's gre­at-gre­at-gre­at-gre­at-grandc­hild­ren. Ne­ar-immor­ta­lity ca­me with its own costs.</p>
   <p>    He sho­ok off the me­lanc­holy tho­ught, and bro­ught his mind back to the pre­sent. Lady Lydi­ell wo­uld be very amu­sed, he was su­re, when she re­ali­zed what had hap­pe­ned bet­we­en Ren-na­ti and Gel. An in­ve­te­ra­te match­ma­ker, she had be­en trying to pa­ir Gel off for ye­ars. She'd find the cur­rent si­tu­ati­on en­ti­rely to her li­king.</p>
   <p>    She'll ha­ve them tuc­ked up in a lit­tle cot­ta­ge or su­ite of the­ir own in the ma­nor be­fo­re the two of them get a chan­ce to turn aro­und.</p>
   <p>    "Go on thro­ugh, you two," he sa­id, wa­ving at them. He tur­ned to Moth, as they step­ped in­to the ut­ter black­ness wit­hin the Por­tal.</p>
   <p>    "Are you go­ing to be all right?" he as­ked. "Can you ke­ep tho­se idi­ot child­ren from trying to start the re­bel­li­on all over aga­in, or so­me­how get­ting ca­ught?"</p>
   <p>    She la­ug­hed. "The day I can't ke­ep an un­ruly pack of pup­pi­es li­ke that un­der my thumb, now that they've had a go­od sca­re, is the day you might as well start plan­ning my fu­ne­ral-ga­mes. You and yo­ur boys sho­wed them that everyt­hing they'd won aga­inst the­ir fat­hers was due to the­ir inc­re­dib­le go­od luck, the Wi­zards' iron, and the Gre­at Lords' in­com­pe­ten­ce. They're happy eno­ugh to be es­ca­ping the ho­unds, and I ima­gi­ne they'll stay that way for so­me lit­tle whi­le."</p>
   <p>    He had to smi­le at that. "I sho­uld ha­ve known bet­ter than to ask; I sho­uld be as­king them if they think they'll be sa­fe from you."</p>
   <p>    "Indeed you sho­uld." Moth smi­led, and win­ked. "Two or three of tho­se lads are rat­her to­oth­so­me, and still yo­ung eno­ugh to tra­in pro­perly. I'm not too old to re­mar­ry." She grin­ned as he la­ug­hed. "Now, get on with you. By now, po­or Lydi­ell is pro­bably won­de­ring if the Por­tal's bro­ken down."</p>
   <p>    He emb­ra­ced her, then step­ped ac­ross the thres­hold.</p>
   <p>    As so­on as he re­co­ve­red from the shock of cros­sing, which was al­ways di­so­ri­en­ting, he saw that his mot­her had al­re­ady sor­ted out the new re­la­ti­ons­hip bet­we­en Gel and Ren­na­ti. And much to Gel's surp­ri­se and be­mu­se­ment, she had ta­ken it all in stri­de and with con­si­de­rab­le ap­lomb-and from the so­und of things, had be­gun ma­king plans for them wit­ho­ut wa­iting for Kyrti­an.</p>
   <p>    Heh. I won­der if he ex­pec­ted Mot­her to be shoc­ked or out­ra­ged that Ren­na­ti has ma­na­ged to cap­tu­re him? He sho­uld ha­ve known bet­ter than that-gi­ven all the match­ma­king she's do­ne all over the es­ta­te! He's just lucky she ne­ver se­ri­o­usly to­ok it in­to her he­ad to find a wo­man for him, or he 'd ha­ve be­en ti­ed up long be­fo­re this.</p>
   <p>    "Our pe­op­le will ex­pect a wed­ding-ce­re­mony and a fe­ast, of co­ur­se," she was exp­la­ining to a be­wil­de­red Ren­na­ti. "Our Gel is a per­son of gre­at im­por­tan­ce he­re, and if we did anyt­hing less, pe­op­le wo­uld fe­el che­ated. We'll ha­ve to ha­ve all of the figh­ters and the­ir fa­mi­li­es, of co­ur­se-I won­der if we co­uld ha­ve the who­le thing in the open air? I can't think of any bu­il­ding on the es­ta­te lar­ge eno­ugh to fit ever­yo­ne in­si­de-"</p>
   <p>    "But-" Ren­na­ti sa­id, fe­ebly, lo­oking alar­med.</p>
   <p>    "Oh, I know you've no idea what to do, child," Lydi­ell con­ti­nu­ed calmly. "But our pe­op­le ne­ver had the­ir tra­di­ti­ons wrenc­hed from them and bu­ri­ed past ret­ri­eval. They ha­ve the­ir pri­ests and the­ir ri­tu­als exactly as they did be­fo­re we ca­me on the sce­ne. Don't con­cern yo­ur­self with it; they know what to do, and if you can le­arn a cle­ver dan­ce, you can cer­ta­inly le­arn a simp­le wed­ding ce­re­mony. Now, this co­uld fit in very ni­cely with the ge­ne­ral ho­me­co­ming; yo­ur wed­ding can be the start of a we­ek of fes­ti­vi­ti­es and-"</p>
   <p>    "Mother, my lo­ve," Kyrti­an in­ter­rup­ted her. "Don't for­get, with all yo­ur plan­ning, I ha­ve to be off with a se­lect crew on Lord Kyndreth's Wi­zard-hunt as so­on as may be. This will ha­ve to lo­ok as if I con­si­der it to be as ur­gent as he do­es."</p>
   <p>    "So Gel tells me," Lydi­ell sa­id se­re­nely. "All the mo­re re­ason to ha­ve the wed­ding as so­on as pos­sib­le. I ha­ve be­en plan­ning the­se ho­me­co­ming ce­leb­ra­ti­ons for a fort­night, and you will be he­re for at le­ast the first day and night of them! And if Kyndreth gets im­pa­ti­ent, I will tell him that you ne­eded the ti­me to se­lect exactly the right gro­up of sco­uts and hun­ters."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian bo­wed to the ine­vi­tab­le. "Yes, Mot­her," he sa­id obe­di­ently, and be­at a hasty ret­re­at to his own su­ite, le­aving Gel and Ren­na­ti to fa­ce his for­mi­dab­le mot­her and all her plans alo­ne.</p>
   <p>    A co­ward's ploy, and he wo­uld su­rely he­ar all abo­ut it from Gel on­ce the Sar­ge­ant got away. But in the me­anw­hi­le-</p>
   <p>    He can ta­ke ca­re of him­self. At le­ast for a whi­le. On­ce Ren­na­ti gets over be­ing da­zed, she 'II pro­bably jo­in for­ces with mot­her, the fe­ma­les aga­inst the po­or, help­less ma­le. I've ne­ver se­en a wo­man that co­uld re­sist an op­por­tu­nity for a ce­leb­ra­ti­on and a new gown. Gel won't ha­ve a chan­ce.</p>
   <p>    But oh, the mo­re he tho­ught abo­ut it, the mo­re he ho­ped that his own ti­me to wed wo­uldn't ar­ri­ve any­ti­me so­on.</p>
   <p>    I think I'll run off and ha­ve Moth ta­ke ca­re of everyt­hing. I'll hi­de in her lib­rary un­til the very last mo­ment, so no one can swarm over me.</p>
   <p>    He pus­hed open the do­ors to his own ro­oms and sig­hed; it se­emed an age sin­ce he'd be­en he­re, and the sight of his own qu­ar­ters was very wel­co­me.</p>
   <p>    But mo­re wel­co­me still was the bath­ro­om, the re­ady tub, and the smi­ling ser­vants wa­iting to help him.</p>
   <p>    He didn't stop for the­ir help; he threw off his clot­hes and plun­ged in­to the hot wa­ter, re­la­xing comp­le­tely in the pe­net­ra­ting he­at, as he had not be­en ab­le to do sin­ce he left. Much as he lo­ved and trus­ted Lady Moth, she had all tho­se Yo­ung Lords still lur­king on her pre­mi­ses, and Lady Tri­ana's unex­pec­ted ar­ri­val only pro­ved that even the for­mi­dab­le Lady Mort­he­na co­uld be surp­ri­sed by unex­pec­ted vi­si­tors. Furt­her­mo­re, she ad­mit­ted la­ter that she had no no­ti­on how many keys to her Por­tal her la­te hus­band had han­ded abo­ut. It co­uld be many, it co­uld be few, but the fact was they pro­bably exis­ted. And if an­yo­ne was li­kely to fer­ret tho­se keys out, it wo­uld be Kyndreth, Tri-ana, or Ael­mar­kin. As a re­sult, he had not re­al­ly be­en ab­le to re­lax, even whi­le on her es­ta­te.</p>
   <p>    And, of co­ur­se, whi­le on cam­pa­ign he'd had no such lu­xu­ri­es as this. Just the tho­ught of all the ti­mes he'd go­ne to bed ac­hing and bru­ised and bath­less ma­de this all the mo­re ple­asu­rab­le.</p>
   <p>    It might be a whi­le be­fo­re I get to enj­oy it aga­in. Alt­ho­ugh his hunt for the non-exis­tent Wi­zards was by its very na­tu­re a wild-go­ose cha­se, he wo­uld ha­ve to con­duct it as if it was se­ri­o­us. The ba­re es­sen­ti­als for cam­ping, no mo­re than six men, and they wo­uld ha­ve to ke­ep them­sel­ves fed off the land as much as pos­sib­le. The­re wo­uld be no hot, so­aking baths out the­re in the fo­rests.</p>
   <p>    He was, ho­we­ver, too ener­ge­tic by na­tu­re to re­lax for too long in a hot bath when he wasn't bo­ne-ti­red and wasn't cur­rently ac­hing and bru­ised. So­on eno­ugh he was out and dres­sed, and went lo­oking for his fat­her's no­tes. They we­re still whe­re he had left them, in the lib­rary. A qu­ick glan­ce thro­ugh them told him everyt­hing he ne­eded to know.</p>
   <p>    He sent his body­ser­vant Lynder to find Gel. Just abo­ut now, Gel sho­uld be fran­tic for a way to es­ca­pe the two fe­ma­les who we­re plan­ning a wed­ding aro­und him, will-he, nill-he.</p>
   <p>    Sure eno­ugh, wit­hin mo­ments Lynder and Gel we­re back, Lynder's eyes dan­cing with mer­ri­ment, Gel lo­oking dis­tinctly har­ri­ed. "Be­fo­re ever­yo­ne gets wrap­ped up in this fes­ti­val bu­si­ness, I want you to help me pick out six of our trac­kers for this pse­udo Wi­zard-hunt," he told Gel. "I want men who didn't go out as figh­ters, but who can still be spa­red. It's get­ting clo­se to the first hay-har­vest, and I don't want to le­ave Mot­her short-han­ded even by a trif­le."</p>
   <p>    "I can tell you who wit­ho­ut even thin­king abo­ut it," Gel rep­li­ed im­me­di­ately. "Kar, Tem, Shal­van, Res­so, Ha­le­an and No­et. They're all the juni­or fo­res­ters; they don't help with the har­vest and the­ir da's can li­ve wit­ho­ut 'em for a bit. Why so many? You plan on ac­tu­al­ly do­ing anyt­hing in the­re?"</p>
   <p>    "It's dan­ge­ro­us; it isn't go­ing to be a ple­asu­re trip," Kyrti­an war­ned. "Even if the new Wi­zards are a fab­ri­ca­ti­on, the­re are still a lot of de­adly cre­atu­res in that area. And you aren't go­ing to be along."</p>
   <p>    Gel's fa­ce fell, but he al­so lo­oked re­sig­ned. "I was af­ra­id you we­re go­ing to de­ci­de that," he grumb­led. "Damn it all, Kyrti­an-"</p>
   <p>    "Gel, you're a figh­ter, a tac­ti­ci­an; you're ne­it­her a hun­ter nor a fo­res­ter," Kyrti­an po­in­ted out. "You'd be of less use to me than one of tho­se boys. You'll be of mo­re user he­re to me-and Mot­her-on the ba­re chan­ce that Ael­mar­kin tri­es so­met­hing whi­le I'm go­ne. Mot­her is many things-but not a sol­di­er."</p>
   <p>    Gel's mo­uth tigh­te­ned. "You're not thin­king he'd con­vin­ce Kyndreth to put this pla­ce un­der si­ege?"</p>
   <p>    "I'm not thin­king anyt­hing," he li­ed with a stra­ight fa­ce-be­ca­use that was pre­ci­sely what he was thin­king. He didn't trust Ael­mar­kin-and he didn't trust Kyndreth, eit­her. May­be he was still use­ful to the Gre­at Lord-but may­be he wasn't, any­mo­re. "Kyndreth still ne­eds me as long as he thinks the­re's a tri­be of Wi­zards hi­ding right on our bor­ders. I'm mo­re wor­ri­ed abo­ut what Ael­mar­kin might do-or try. But bet­we­en you and Mot­her, with Moth to fe­ed you gos­sip, you'll see thro­ugh anyt­hing he tri­es be­fo­re he's do­ne mo­re than ma­ke a ten­ta­ti­ve pro­be." He clap­ped Gel on the sho­ul­der. "I am not trying to put you out to stud li­ke my fa­vo­ri­te war­hor­se, alt­ho­ugh I sug­gest you ma­ke that char­ming lit­tle dan­cer in­to a very happy wi­fe! I am al­lo­ca­ting my re­so­ur­ces whe­re they'll do the most go­od. I ne­ed you and Mot­her he­re, watc­hing for tro­ub­le, whi­le I go in­to the fo­rest and wa­it for the El­ven­ba­ne to con­tact me aga­in- which she will, sin­ce the fo­rest is the most lo­gi­cal pla­ce for that." He rub­bed his chin tho­ught­ful­ly. "The­re's one ot­her thing-be­fo­re we had to le­ave Moth's, I was re­ading so­me per­so­nal jo­ur­nals, and so­met­hing I ran in­to re­min­ded me of so­me of Fat­her's no­tes that he left be­hind. It's pos­sib­le we've be­en lo­oking for the Gre­at Por­tal in the wrong pla­ce. I think it's un­derg­ro­und, and the area aro­und Chey­nar's es­ta­te has a lot in com­mon with the fo­rest our an­ces­tors fled thro­ugh when they first ar­ri­ved."</p>
   <p>    Gel knew exactly what he was hin­ting. "Tho­se hills are rid­dled with ca­ves!" he exc­la­imed. "Co­me to think of it, if yo­ur ancestors fo­und that the­ir Por­tal drop­ped 'em in­to a ca­ve, they wo­uldn't ha­ve be­en disp­le­ased abo­ut that, I wo­uldn't think; co­ming in­to a stran­ge world in a pro­tec­ted spot."</p>
   <p>    "It's one pos­sib­le pla­ce to lo­ok," Kyrti­an ag­re­ed. He didn't tell Gel the one thing that con­cer­ned him de­eply-the An­ces­tors had fled the vi­ci­nity of the Gre­at Por­tal in ter­ror, but why? That was the very last thing he wan­ted Gel thin­king abo­ut when he was go­ne. "That's why I want yo­ur hun­ters and trac­kers. As long as I ha­ve to pre­tend I'm hun­ting for Wi­zards li­ving in ca­ves, I ha­ve every ex­cu­se to check every ca­ve we co­me ac­ross."</p>
   <p>    "Then you don't want hun­ters and trac­kers-or, at le­ast, not all hun­ters and trac­kers," Gel sa­id de­ci­si­vely. "You'll ne­ed men that can ke­ep all of you fed, but you'll al­so ne­ed men who're used to clam­be­ring aro­und un­derg­ro­und. Ins­te­ad of Kar and Tem, I want you to ta­ke Kar's brot­her Ho­bie, and yo­ur laddy Lynder, the­re."</p>
   <p>    "Lynder?" Kyrti­an tur­ned to his body­ser­vant in surp­ri­se. "Lynder? Why Lynder?"</p>
   <p>    "Because Lynder and Ho­bie ha­ve be­en trying to kill them­sel­ves clim­bing down ho­les in the gro­und on the­ir spa­re ti­me ever sin­ce they we­re in the­ir te­ens," Gel rep­li­ed, wryly, as Lynder flus­hed a bril­li­ant scar­let. "If you're go­ing to be do­ing the sa­me, I sug­gest you ta­ke pe­op­le who've had the ex­pe­ri­en­ce of ne­arly drow­ning when a clo­ud­burst out­si­de flo­oded the ca­ve they we­re in."</p>
   <p>    "We got out ahe­ad of the flo­od!" Lynder pro­tes­ted, tur­ning red­der. "We he­ard it co­ming!"</p>
   <p>    "And it wo­uld be use­ful if you had a co­up­le of lads who'd be­en stuck in a pas­sa­ge they re­ali­zed a bit too la­te was too small for them." Gel was cle­arly enj­oying him­self.</p>
   <p>    "It wasn't too small ori­gi­nal­ly," Lynder mut­te­red. "The rock shif­ted."</p>
   <p>    "I can see Lynder has plenty of ex­pe­ri­en­ce," Kyrti­an in­ter­rup­ted, trying not to la­ugh, alt­ho­ugh he al­so felt very sorry for the po­or yo­ung man. "Ha­ven't you told me, ti­me and ti­me aga­in, that the best te­ac­her is ex­pe­ri­en­ce?"</p>
   <p>    "Hobie and I ha­ve be­en ca­ve-explo­ring for three ye­ars now without a sing­le se­ri­o­us mis­hap," Lynder sa­id, get­ting his blus­hing un­der cont­rol and trying to gat­her the scat­te­red shards of his shat­te­red dig­nity. "And the kinds of mi­nor inj­uri­es we've had co­uld hap­pen sco­uting thro­ugh a fo­rest or do­ing so­me he­avy work on the farm." He didn't gla­re at Gel, who was still cle­arly amu­sed, but Kyrti­an sen­sed that he wan­ted to.</p>
   <p>    Gel fi­nal­ly to­ok pity on the lad. "Kyrti­an, I wo­uldn't ha­ve re­com­men­ded yo­ung Lynder if I didn't think he co­uld gu­ard yo­ur steps as well in his world as I can in mi­ne," he sa­id ge­ne­ro­usly, and now Lynder flus­hed with ple­asu­re rat­her than em­bar­ras­sment.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian nod­ded. "In that ca­se-Lynder, I want you to get the ca­ve-explo­ring ge­ar to­get­her for se­ven. Gel and I will ta­ke ca­re of the rest of the sup­pli­es we'll ne­ed. I'd li­ke everyt­hing re­ady by-" He tho­ught, and im­pishly de­ci­ded to te­ase Gel a lit­tle mo­re. "I'd li­ke to le­ave to­mor­row, but-"</p>
   <p>    Gel tur­ned whi­te. Lynder sho­ok his he­ad. "Ge­ar for se­ven- we'll ne­ed so­me spe­ci­al clim­bing equ­ip­ment and we don't ha­ve anyt­hing li­ke that he­re. I'll ha­ve to get stra­ight to the blacks­mith, and he and his hel­pers will ha­ve to work the rest of to­day and all to­mor­row. The rest will ta­ke a bit of hun­ting among the sto­res."</p>
   <p>    "But you can ha­ve it by the day af­ter to­mor­row?" Kyrti­an per­sis­ted.</p>
   <p>    "If you da­re le­ave be­fo­re this wed­ding fol­de­rol-" Gel grow­led un­der his bre­ath, glo­we­ring.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian co­uldn't hold back his la­ugh­ter-and then he had to run, for Sar­ge­ant Gel lun­ged for him, and he knew that if Gel got his hands on his mas­ter, the "mas­ter" wo­uld wind up in the bath­tub aga­in, but this ti­me fully clot­hed.</p>
   <p>    They co­uldn't get away in less than three days, af­ter all.</p>
   <p>    On the eve­ning of the se­cond day, Gel and Ren­na­ti we­re wed at sun­set in an open-air ce­re­mony, pre­si­ded over by an old man we­aring a long, black ro­be. So inc­re­dibly dig­ni­fi­ed was this in­di­vi­du­al, and so full of so­lem­nity, Kyrti­an had a dif­fi­cult ti­me in re­cog­ni­zing Ho­bie's fat­her Rand, the ma­nor's chi­ef stab­le­hand, who al­ways had a joke for ever­yo­ne, usu­al­ly ri­bald.</p>

   <p>    Rand first waf­ted smo­ke over the co­up­le, then, whi­le chan­ting un­der his bre­ath, sprink­led them with wa­ter, wa­ved a ligh­ted ta­per aro­und them, and blew dust at them. Then he drew a wobbly circ­le aro­und all three of them with the po­in­ted end of a staff. Still dro­ning a chant that Kyrti­an co­uldn't ma­ke he­ad or ta­il of, he con­duc­ted a long ri­tu­al that in­vol­ved an ama­zing amo­unt of sprink­ling of herbs and wa­ter and salt on the part of the happy co­up­le, a gre­at de­al of wal­king in circ­les and fi­gu­re-eights, and the sha­ring of bre­ad and salt.</p>
   <p>    Finally, at Rand's low-vo­iced or­der, they held out the­ir co­nj­o­ined hands, and Rand bo­und the­ir hands to­get­her. Then, tur­ning to the crowd, as the last wink of the sun des­cen­ded be­low the ho­ri­zon and the first stars ca­me out, he spre­ad his arms wi­de be­hind them.</p>
   <p>    "Hands are bo­und as he­arts are bo­und; two are one!" he sho­uted.</p>
   <p>    A tre­men­do­us che­er aro­se from the hu­ge crowd co­me to see the ce­re­mony. Then, of co­ur­se, ca­me the ce­leb­ra­ti­on. The­re was a very gre­at de­al of wi­ne and be­er ava­ilab­le, the­re was dan­cing and wil­ling girls to bu­ild up a thirst, and all of Kyrti­an's cho­sen party we­re yo­ung men with hard he­ads and the usu­al ina­bi­lity of yo­ung men to re­mem­ber what a han­go­ver felt li­ke du­ring the ti­me that the drink was sli­ding smo­othly down the­ir thro­ats. As a con­se­qu­en­ce, no­ne of Kyrti­an's six we­re go­od for much on the fol­lo­wing day.</p>
   <p>    However, that was not so bad, be­ca­use that was the day of so­me of the ris­ki­er com­pe­ti­ti­ons-the wrest­ling, the hur­ling of lar­ge obj­ects, the ga­me pit­ting two te­ams aga­inst each ot­her in com­pe­ti­ti­on for an inf­la­ted blad­der, with no holds bar­red. Nur­sing he­adac­hes and un­cer­ta­in sto­machs, it was easy to per­su­ade the six that they sho­uld be spec­ta­tors, not par­ti­ci­pants.</p>
   <p>    On the mor­ning of the third day, a day de­vo­ted to the gent­ler pur­su­its and com­pe­ti­ti­ons of the wo­men-folk-fo­ot­ra­ces, tar­get-sho­oting, mil­king, se­wing, and co­oking com­pe­ti­ti­ons- they we­re in fi­ne fet­tle and high spi­rits, and qu­ite re­ady to go. So was the­ir equ­ip­ment, and Kyrti­an was not go­ing to al­low the temp­ta­ti­on of anot­her fe­ast, dan­ce, and drin­king so­iree in­ca­pa­ci­ta­te them all over aga­in. By mid-mor­ning he had them all li­ned up at the Por­tal, ful­ly-la­den, with still mo­re of the ser­vants equ­al­ly bur­de­ned.</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth had pro­mi­sed hor­ses on the ot­her si­de, and Kyrti­an was go­ing to hold him to that pro­mi­se. He sent his party and all of the ser­vants thro­ugh first, and wa­ited for the ser­vants to re­turn be­fo­re pas­sing thro­ugh the Por­tal him­self. The­re we­re no fa­re­wel­ls this ti­me. He had cho­sen a ti­me when Lydi­ell was busy su­per­vi­sing and jud­ging a con­test, and as for Gel-well, he hadn't se­en his old fri­end sin­ce the ce­re­mony, and he ho­ped that Ren­na­ti was te­ac­hing him a few of the tricks she'd shown him…</p>
   <p>    He pas­sed the dark and cold and di­so­ri­en­ta­ti­on of the Por­tal- and with a jolt, ca­me out on the ot­her si­de.</p>
   <p>    "Lord Kyrti­an?"</p>
   <p>    He sho­ok his he­ad to cle­ar it, and for­ced his eyes to fo­cus. The per­son who had ad­dres­sed him was a ra­re cre­atu­re-an el­derly El­ven­lord, who­se thin­ning, sil­ver ha­ir and fa­intly-li­ned fa­ce ca­me as so­met­hing of a shock. "Yes," he sa­id, "I'm Lord Kyrti­an."</p>
   <p>    The el­derly gent­le­man bo­wed. "I am Lord Rat­hi­en. Lord Kyndreth di­rec­ted me to supply wha­te­ver you re­qu­ire."</p>
   <p>    Well, that was ple­asant. "I ne­ed eno­ugh hor­ses to carry all of this lot," he sa­id, wa­ving at the sup­pli­es and equ­ip­ment he­aped on eit­her si­de of the cor­ri­dor le­ading to the Por­tal.</p>
   <p>    Lord Rat­hi­en eyed the pi­les with an ex­pe­ri­en­ced glan­ce. "Se­ven ri­ding-mo­unts and as many pack-mu­les," he sa­id with aut­ho­rity. "You will find the mu­les can carry mo­re than hor­ses, and the­ir tem­pers are ste­adi­er. When you camp in the fo­rest, tet­her each hor­se to a mu­le be­fo­re you sta­ke out the li­ne- sho­uld anyt­hing at­tack, the mu­les will run un­fa­ilingly away from dan­ger, they will not plun­ge blindly in­to furt­her dan­ger, and they will stop when pur­su­it stops." He smi­led then, with gre­at charm. "I am very fond of mu­les, myself."</p>
   <p>    "So I see." Kyrti­an smi­led back, but Lord Rat­hi­en had al­re­ady tur­ned away, and was or­de­ring a set of hu­man sla­ves to pick up the pi­led go­ods and ta­ke them to the stab­les. All Kyrti­an and his party had to do was to fol­low.</p>
   <p>    By no­on, with the mu­les lo­aded, hor­ses sad­dled, and a mu­le tethered be­hind each ri­der, they we­re on the­ir way. His task comp­le­ted, Lord Rat­hi­en was go­ne by the ti­me they ro­de out of the ga­tes; Kyrti­an won­de­red if he was one of Lord Kyndreth's un­der­lings, or was a le­gacy from Lord Dyran. He was cer­ta­inly ef­fi­ci­ent-and if he tre­ated the sla­ves exactly as he did the mu­les, well, at le­ast he didn't tre­at them wor­se. Kyrti­an's own yo­ung men had be­en ca­uti­oned as to how to be­ha­ve on­ce they we­re off the es­ta­te, so they had not do­ne anyt­hing to aro­use Rat­hi­en's sus­pi­ci­ons. The­ir ten­si­on had be­en pal­pab­le du­ring that ti­me; they hadn't da­red to spe­ak, lest they say so­met­hing un-sla­ve­li­ke, or to ra­ise the­ir eyes abo­ve Kyrti­an's kne­es, lest the­ir pos­tu­re or de­me­anor bet­ray them.</p>
   <p>    Once they we­re all on the ro­ad, ho­we­ver, they re­la­xed. "Sar­ge­ant Gel told us that we we­re go­ing down in ca­ves, m'Lord," Ho­bie sa­id, ur­ging his hor­se up be­si­de Kyrti­an's, as Lynder did so on the ot­her si­de, and the rest of the six got in as clo­sely as they co­uld, the bet­ter to he­ar what he had to say. "Why's that?"</p>
   <p>    "Well, you know that we're cha­sing af­ter Wi­zards that don't re­al­ly exist," Kyrti­an be­gan.</p>
   <p>    "Aye sir. Bet­ter than cha­sing ones that do!" rep­li­ed Ho­bie. One of the men in the re­ar la­ug­hed.</p>
   <p>    "They're sup­po­sedly li­ving in an un­derg­ro­und strong­hold whe­re we're go­ing, so we'll be exp­lo­ring ca­ves. Now, as it hap­pens, I think my fat­her may ha­ve be­en hun­ting the­se sa­me ca­ves when he di­sap­pe­ared, and I'm ho­ping we'll find so­me sign of him the­re." The man who had la­ug­hed so­be­red im­me­di­ately, and the­re we­re so­me sympat­he­tic mur­murs from all of them.</p>
   <p>    "You-surely don't ex­pect to find him af­ter all this ti­me, do you, m'Lord?" Ho­bie as­ked he­si­tantly.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian sig­hed. "Not af­ter all this ti­me, no-not ali­ve, at any ra­te," he sa­id sadly. "But, you know-my cla­im to the es­ta­te is clo­uded as long as no one knows what be­ca­me of him. And un­til Mot­her and I find out what re­al­ly hap­pe­ned…"</p>
   <p>    He let the sen­ten­ce tra­il off. Ho­bie drop­ped his eyes for a mo­ment. "Well, m'Lord," Lynder sa­id in­to the si­len­ce, "if the­re's a sign to be fo­und, we'll find it. Ho­bie and I ha­ve fo­und a gre­at many stran­ge things in ca­ves."</p>
   <p>    "Such as?" Kyrti­an as­ked, to chan­ge the su­bj­ect and che­er the men up aga­in. To­uc­hing as the­ir sympathy was, he'd far rat­her ha­ve la­ugh­ter aro­und him than glo­om.</p>
   <p>    It was, af­ter all, a long ri­de to Lord Chey­nar's es­ta­te, and the­re was no re­ason to ma­ke it un­der a clo­ud of dep­res­si­on!</p>
   <p>    There was qu­ite eno­ugh that was dep­res­sing abo­ut Lord Chey­nar's es­ta­te to ha­ve su­ited a do­zen fu­ne­ral pro­ces­si­ons.</p>
   <p>    The ma­nor, sur­ro­un­ded by pi­ne fo­rest, bo­as­ted not­hing in the way of ma­gi­cal ame­ni­ti­es; no ma­ge-lights to il­lu­mi­na­te the dark­ness, no il­lu­si­ons, all work do­ne by sla­ves or mec­ha­ni­cal de­vi­ces. The pi­nes we­re of a va­ri­ety that Kyrti­an was un­fa­mi­li­ar with-so dark a gre­en as to be ne­arly black, and in­ha­bi­ted by flocks of crows. Chey­nar, a ta­ci­turn in­di­vi­du­al with very lit­tle ma­gic of his own, war­med slightly to Kyrti­an when the lat­ter cong­ra­tu­la­ted him on so­me of his mec­ha­ni­cal de­vi­ces-and when Kyrti­an at dark­ness ma­de che­er­ful use of the lan­terns, rat­her than sho­wing off by cre­ating his own ma­ge-lights.</p>
   <p>    He war­med still mo­re over din­ner, and fi­nal­ly ca­me out with so­met­hing en­ti­rely unex­pec­ted.</p>
   <p>    "I knew yo­ur fat­her," Chey­nar of­fe­red. "I me­an, I met him- he was he­re just be­fo­re he di­sap­pe­ared."</p>
   <p>    That elect­ri­fi­ed Kyrti­an, and he co­uld not con­ce­al his shock. "What?" he exc­la­imed. "But-why didn't you-"</p>
   <p>    "Why didn't I say so­met­hing?" Chey­nar as­ked shrewdly. "I did, to Lord Dyran. I sup­po­se he didn't think it im­por­tant eno­ugh to pass it to yo­ur Lady Mot­her. But then, he wasn't at all ple­ased with what yo­ur fat­her was hun­ting."</p>
   <p>    "The old de­vi­ces the An­ces­tors bro­ught with them." Kyrti­an was torn bet­we­en ex­ci­te­ment and des­pa­ir. If his mot­her had known whe­re her hus­band had last be­en se­en, wo­uld it ha­ve ma­de a dif­fe­ren­ce? Co­uld they ha­ve fo­und him still ali­ve?</p>
   <p>    Cheynar nod­ded. "One of tho­se-yo­ur fat­her sa­id-wo­uld put tho­se of us with we­ak ma­gic on a par with tho­se who are stron­ger," he told Kyrti­an. "I don't know if Lord Dyran knew that. Yo­ur fat­her told me, at le­ast in part be­ca­use he saw all the mec­ha­ni­cal de­vi­ces I use aro­und he­re ins­te­ad of ma­gic, but he might not ha­ve sa­id anyt­hing to Dyran." He shrug­ged.</p>
   <p>    "And Lord Dyran was one of the Gre­at Lords of the Co­un­cil, any­way," Kyrti­an sig­hed. "And my fat­her and I-well, we're not­hing li­ke the equ­als of any Gre­at Lord. I do­ubt that Lord Dyran even pa­id any he­ed to anyt­hing fat­her sa­id. You know." He half-smi­led at Chey­nar, ho­ping that Chey­nar wo­uld warm a lit­tle furt­her, and see him­self in the sa­me po­si­ti­on as Kyrti­an. "When we're use­ful, we're equ­als at the fe­ast-tab­le, but on­ce they don't ne­ed us any­mo­re…"</p>
   <p>    Cheynar to­ok the ba­it. "Pro­bably he just tho­ught that the man was half-cra­zed, if he even to­ok ti­me for a tho­ught at all," Chey­nar sa­id, and with so­me sympathy. "But I can tell you this-"</p>
   <p>    He pa­used sig­ni­fi­cantly.</p>
   <p>    "If you are go­ing Wi­zard-hun­ting in tho­se ca­ves, you'll be wal­king in the steps of yo­ur fat­her. Be­ca­use the last ti­me an­yo­ne saw him-that was whe­re he was go­ing, too."</p>

   <p>    One set of items in the­ir packs was im­me­di­ately use­ful the mo­ment they en­te­red the fo­rest: ra­in ge­ar. Kyrti­an had ne­ver se­en so much ra­in in his li­fe; he was glad that he'd chec­ked on the cli­ma­te when ar­ran­ging for the sup­pli­es. And oh, the ad­van­ta­ge of be­ing on equ­al terms with one's fe­ma­les in an el­ven ho­use­hold! He had not re­ali­zed that silk co­uld be ma­de so comp­le­tely wa­terp­ro­of. Evi­dently that oft-de­ri­ded "wo­men's ma­gic" used for flo­wer-sculp­ting had a gre­at many ot­her pur­po­ses that the wo­men them­sel­ves knew but sel­dom sha­red. He cer­ta­inly didn't bla­me them, the "lords of cre­ati­on" that El­ven­lords con­si­de­red them­sel­ves to be wo­uld pro­bably gre­et such in­no­va­ti­ons as tri­vi­al and wo­men kept pent up in the­ir bo­wers, dis­re­gar­ded and dis­car­ded as toys them­sel­ves co­uld hardly be ex­pec­ted to sha­re such know­led­ge voluntarily. He co­uld well ima­gi­ne se­ve­ral disg­runt­led la­di­es sit­ting aro­und in the­ir bo­wer, con­temp­la­ting the­ir drip­ping men­folk, and sa­ying to each ot­her with glee, "Well, why don't they just stop the ra­in?"</p>
   <p>    Rain-capes, with ho­ods snug­ged in aro­und the­ir fa­ces, co­ats with an outer wa­ter-pro­ofed sur­fa­ce be­ne­ath that, me­ant that what co­uld ha­ve be­en a mi­se­rab­le si­tu­ati­on was me­rely in­te­res­ting. Pro­vi­ded that one co­uld ma­na­ge so­me­how to see past the glo­om, this was a truly uni­que fo­rest.</p>
   <p>    More wa­terp­ro­ofed she­ets-which wo­uld la­ter ser­ve as shel­ters for the­ir three tents-co­ve­red the se­ven packs car­ri­ed by the pack mu­les. This me­ant that the­ir sup­pli­es and be­lon­gings we­re dry and wo­uld stay dry; no small con­si­de­ra­ti­on when, at the end of the day, they we­re go­ing to be ab­le to camp dry.</p>
   <p>    Too much wa­ter was, in the long run, bet­ter than too lit­tle. This co­uld ha­ve be­en a hunt in the de­sert, and even Kyrti­an was not en­ti­rely su­re that ma­gic wo­uld be eno­ugh to en­su­re wa­ter for ever­yo­ne. Grels we­re the only op­ti­on in the de­sert for trans­por­ta­ti­on, but ne­it­her he nor an­yo­ne on his es­ta­te knew anyt­hing abo­ut grels. The­ir ma­in prob­lem he­re-and to so­me ex­tent, in the ca­ves-wo­uld be to pre­vent get­ting wet and cold with no way to get warm and dry aga­in.</p>
   <p>    Game was cer­ta­inly ava­ilab­le, if not pre­ci­sely plen­ti­ful. One wo­uld ex­pect lar­ge ga­me he­re, and yet the only ani­mals that ma­de an ap­pe­aran­ce we­re small ga­me. Well, the ad­van­ta­ge of tra­ve­ling with fo­res­ters was that they didn't scorn small ga­me in a fu­ti­le se­arch for so­met­hing lar­ger. The fo­ur fo­res­ters qu­ickly tra­ded the­ir he­avi­er bows and ar­rows for hand cross-bows, and to­ok ca­re­ful shots wit­ho­ut ever se­eming to aim. One by one, plump lit­tle bo­di­es ac­cu­mu­la­ted, ti­ed to the cant­les and pom­mels of sad­dles.</p>
   <p>    The ra­in ne­ver stop­ped. It let up, from ti­me to ti­me, dec­re­asing to a me­re driz­zle, which per­co­la­ted down thro­ugh the tre­es and drip­ped from every limb, every ne­ed­le. Then, when the ra­in re­su­med, it obs­cu­red everyt­hing in the dis­tan­ce, far or ne­ar, re­du­cing vi­si­bi­lity to a few hor­se-lengths ahe­ad of the le­ad ri­der.</p>
   <p>    Which was not Kyrti­an.</p>
   <p>    He knew very well that he was not a fo­res­ter. That was why he ro­de in the de­ad mid­dle of the string, with Lynder in front of him and Ho­bie be­hind, two of the yo­ung fo­res­ters ahe­ad and two be­hind. It surp­ri­sed him, a lit­tle, that an en­ti­re tra­in of fo­ur­te­en ani­mals co­uld ma­ke so lit­tle no­ise, but the track that they fol­lo­wed, which led in the ge­ne­ral di­rec­ti­on of a pur­por­ted ca­ve-entran­ce, was ank­le-de­ep in a la­yer of pi­ne ne­ed­les. They pro­ce­eded at an amb­ling walk, and not just to sa­ve the hor­ses.</p>
   <p>    Up at the he­ad of the string, No­et ro­de with his he­ad slightly coc­ked, lis­te­ning. Be­hind him, Shal­van con­cent­ra­ted on pe­ering thro­ugh the mist and ra­in. At the re­ar of the tra­in, Ha­le­an and Res­so sha­red the sa­me du­ti­es.</p>
   <p>    Beyond the om­nip­re­sent so­unds of ra­in plop­ping on­to the­ir ca­pes, in­to the ne­ed­le-bed, trick­ling down trunks, and drip­ping on­to le­aves, the­re we­re ot­her so­unds of li­fe that Kyrti­an to­ok to be go­od signs that not­hing el­se was stal­king them. On­ce the crows got used to the­ir pre­sen­ce, the birds stop­ped ma­king alarm-cal­ls and went back to the­ir crow-bu­si­ness with only an oc­ca­si­onal ap­pe­aran­ce as if to ta­ke no­te of the­ir prog­ress. Unex­pec­ted sho­wers of drop­lets he­ral­ded the pas­sa­ge of small birds thro­ugh the branc­hes, and lit­tle rust­les bet­ra­yed the pas­sa­ge of tho­se plump lit­tle squ­ir­rels and rab­bits.</p>
   <p>    By mid-after­no­on, Kyrti­an knew his men we­re lo­oking for a pla­ce to stop and ma­ke camp for the night. Al­re­ady the­re was a chan­ge in the qu­ality of light un­der the­se tre­es, and his ner­ves we­re just a trif­le on ed­ge. He didn't know why, just that the­re was so­met­hing… odd…</p>
   <p>    Noet held up a hand, and the en­ti­re ca­val­ca­de stop­ped. Now Kyrti­an knew what had him on ed­ge-the ab­so­lu­te ab­sen­ce of any so­und ot­her than the drip­ping of wa­ter. Even the crows we­re go­ne.</p>
   <p>    "I don't li­ke this," No­et sa­id, in a low vo­ice, but one that car­ri­ed easily in the si­len­ce. "The hor­ses and mu­les ha­ven't no­ti­ced anyt­hing, but-"</p>
   <p>    "But may­be that's the po­int, if this is a hun­ter," Res­so rep­li­ed. "If it works by am­bush and ste­alth."</p>
   <p>    "Should we turn back?" Kyrti­an as­ked.</p>
   <p>    "Yes-but slowly and ca­re­ful­ly. Just turn yo­ur hor­ses and mu­les in pla­ce, pe­op­le. Shal­van and I will be­co­me re­ar-gu­ard.</p>
   <p>    We'll stop back at that stre­am we cros­sed, and try fol­lo­wing it for a whi­le."</p>
   <p>    "With any luck, it'll le­ad us to the ca­ves any­way," Ho­bie opi­ned.</p>
   <p>    One by one, they tur­ned the­ir hor­ses and drew the mu­les be­hind them, the re­ar­most first. Shal­van and No­et al­re­ady had the­ir he­avy bows out with ar­rows noc­ked to the strings. And as for Kyrti­an-</p>
   <p>    His fin­gers ting­led with po­wer. At any mo­ment, he co­uld, and wo­uld, la­unch a le­vin-bolt in­to wha­te­ver might emer­ge.</p>
   <p>    "It's out the­re, all right," Shal­van sa­id grimly, as No­et tur­ned his hor­se and mu­le. "It's up the tra­il-off to one si­de, in the bus­hes. Every so of­ten the bush sha­kes, and from the mo­ve­ment, I'd say that it's abo­ut the si­ze of a hay­wa­in. It's not mo­ving much, tho­ugh. I don't know if that's be­ca­use it's not cer­ta­in of us, or if it's ter­ri­to­ri­al."</p>
   <p>    He tur­ned his hor­se as No­et sto­od gu­ard and they mo­ved at the sa­me le­isu­rely pa­ce they'd ma­in­ta­ined all along, back up the way they had co­me. The back of Kyrti­an's neck prick­led. What wo­uld-wha­te­ver it was-think of its prey mo­ving away from it?</p>
   <p>    "Uh-oh-" That was Res­so, now in the le­ad, and the ha­ir on Kyrti­an's he­ad li­te­ral­ly sto­od stra­ight up. Pa­cing de­li­be­ra­tely to­wards them was-not one-an en­ti­re herd of ali­corns. The­ir red eyes flas­hed, and the black stal­li­on in the le­ad tos­sed his he­ad with its wic­ked, slightly cur­ved, spi­ral horn.</p>
   <p>    "Don't mo­ve," Ha­le­an sa­id in a strang­led vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian had no in­ten­ti­on of mo­ving. One ali­corn was dan­ge­ro­us; what was a herd? They we­re trap­ped, bet­we­en a very vi­sib­le me­na­ce an in­vi­sib­le one.</p>
   <p>    The ali­corn stal­li­on snor­ted and mo­ved to­wards them. Kyrti­an won­de­red what was go­ing on in tho­se nar­row he­ads. Sho­uld he fling a le­vin-bolt at them? But if he did, what wo­uld the thing be­hind them do? And wo­uldn't the­ir hor­ses spo­ok if he did? No­ne of them we­re war-tra­ined-</p>
   <p>    None of them are war-tra­ined. Mu­les will run un­til the­re's no pur­su­it. The mu­les are tet­he­red to the hor­ses-and vi­ce ver­sa.</p>
   <p>    "Give yo­ur hor­ses free re­in, and hang on," Kyrti­an or­de­red, feeling that sen­se of pre­sen­ce and dan­ger at his back inc­re­asing, just a lit­tle. "And duck yo­ur he­ads on the co­unt of three."</p>
   <p>    The ali­corn-stal­li­on pa­wed the gro­und and ba­red its fangs.</p>
   <p>    "One. Two. Three!"</p>
   <p>    On the co­unt of three, Kyrti­an fi­red a kind of le­vin-bolt- stra­ight up over the­ir he­ads. It exp­lo­ded in a blin­ding flash and a vi­olent bo­om that ac­tu­al­ly shat­te­red the ne­arby limbs of tre­es. The hor­ses, as Kyrti­an had ho­ped, bol­ted-and so did the ali­corns.</p>
   <p>    The hor­ses shot for­ward in the di­rec­ti­on they had be­en fa­cing, along the ga­me tra­il. The ali­corns, foe and prey for­got­ten, scat­te­red in all di­rec­ti­ons, so­me off in­to the wo­ods to eit­her si­de of the tra­il, so­me tur­ning and fle­e­ing, and three, fol­lo­wing the stal­li­on, char­ging he­ad-down to­wards them. At the last mo­ment, the ali­corns ve­ered a lit­tle to the left, and the hyste­ri­cal hor­ses to the right.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian hung on­to his mo­unt with every bit of strength that arms and legs pos­ses­sed, duc­king low along its neck to ke­ep from be­ing knoc­ked out of his sad­dle by low-han­ging bo­ughs. Ho­oves thun­de­red all aro­und him; even if the hor­ses we­ren't stic­king to the ga­me-tra­il, they we­re at le­ast sta­ying to­get­her. Be­hind him he he­ard a ro­ar, and the bat­tle-scre­am of an al-icorn, but wha­te­ver was go­ing on wo­uld ha­ve to re­ma­in a mystery.</p>
   <p>    His he­art ra­ced, his hands and legs ac­hed, and he clenc­hed his te­eth; he co­uldn't see what was hap­pe­ning or whe­re they we­re go­ing. His mo­unt's ma­ne las­hed his fa­ce un­til his eyes wa­te­red.</p>
   <p>    Then, so­oner than he'd tho­ught, he felt the hor­se be­gin­ning to slow, felt a we­ight tug­ging at the le­ad-re­in fas­te­ned to the sad­dle. The hor­se didn't li­ke it; he tri­ed to sur­ge for­ward. The mu­le wasn't ha­ving any.</p>
   <p>    Gradually, the mu­le won. The he­ad­long gal­lop slo­wed to a can­ter, a trot, and fi­nal­ly, the hor­se's si­des he­aving and swe­at po­uring from his neck and sho­ul­ders, a walk. Kyrti­an to­ok up the slack in the re­ins and bro­ught his mo­unt to a stop, and lo­oked aro­und.</p>
   <p>    The ra­in had slac­ke­ned aga­in, and thro­ugh the miz­zle, he counted his men scat­te­red among the tre­es and qu­ickly ca­me up with the right num­ber of ri­ders and pack mu­les.</p>
   <p>    "Ancestors!" he bre­at­hed, in pro­fo­un­dest re­li­ef. The men sa­id not­hing; they simply gu­ided the­ir we­ary be­asts back to­wards him un­til on­ce aga­in they for­med a co­he­rent gro­up.</p>
   <p>    "Everyone all right?" he as­ked, as the­ir hor­ses sto­od with he­ads han­ging, and flanks a-fo­am with swe­at. Only the mu­les lo­oked un­per­tur­bed.</p>
   <p>    "I've be­en wor­se," rep­li­ed No­et la­co­ni­cal­ly. "Gon­na kill who­ever de­sig­ned this sad­dle with a pom­mel right whe­re it don't be­long, tho­ugh."</p>
   <p>    Noet did lo­ok a lit­tle pa­le, and in a cer­ta­in amo­unt of pa­in. Kyrti­an win­ced, and has­tily chan­ged the su­bj­ect. "Do­es an­yo­ne know whe­re we are?"</p>
   <p>    "We bol­ted in the ge­ne­ral di­rec­ti­on of whe­re we wan­ted to go," re­por­ted Shal­van. "So the stre­am sho­uld still be that way-" he po­in­ted with his chin, rat­her than his hand. "We might as well get on with it, the hor­ses aren't go­ing to be the bet­ter for stan­ding in the cold and ra­in, and they're go­ing to ne­ed wa­ter af­ter this."</p>
   <p>    Once aga­in they for­med up, but this ti­me not in sing­le fi­le sin­ce they we­ren't fol­lo­wing a tra­il; Ha­le­an ro­de on the right flank and Res­so on the left. And, not too much la­ter, they ca­me to the stre­am, much to ever­yo­ne's re­li­ef.</p>
   <p>    There wasn't much ti­me be­fo­re night­fall, and with the over­cast ski­es and the fo­rest all aro­und, dark­ness wo­uld co­me so­on. They qu­ickly ma­de camp, with Kyrti­an ten­ding to the fi­re-ma­king cho­res. They pitc­hed the­ir three tents in a tri­ang­le, with the fi­re in the cen­ter. On­ce the tents we­re pitc­hed and Res­so to­ok up the co­oking, the rest gat­he­red mo­re fi­re­wo­od whi­le Kyrti­an ran a circ­le of ma­ge-lights aro­und the tents to stand bet­we­en them and wha­te­ver was in the wo­ods or ac­ross the stre­am. As fi­re­wo­od was bro­ught in, he stac­ked it ne­ar eno­ugh to the fi­re that it sto­od a de­cent chan­ce of drying out so­me be­fo­re it was used.</p>
   <p>    The last thing he did was to run a string hung with small bells aro­und the trunks of tre­es be­yond the glow of the ma­ge­light at about ank­le-he­ight. Anyt­hing that brus­hed aga­inst that string wo­uld set the bells jing­ling.</p>
   <p>    "Do you think we ne­ed to worry abo­ut so­met­hing co­ming in from abo­ve?" he as­ked No­et, with a frown of con­cern.</p>
   <p>    Noet glan­ced up. "Not thro­ugh branc­hes that thick," he rep­li­ed. "I wo­uldn't think, any­way."</p>
   <p>    Darkness, as Kyrti­an had an­ti­ci­pa­ted, ca­me qu­ickly. They tet­he­red the hor­ses-and tet­he­red the mu­les to the hor­ses- wit­hin the circ­le of ma­ge­light. The ra­in ac­tu­al­ly stop­ped on­ce dark­ness fell, and as they gat­he­red aro­und the­ir fi­re, Kyrti­an felt the­ir mu­tu­al fe­ar of what lur­ked out­si­de that ma­gic circ­le dra­wing them all to­get­her des­pi­te rank and ra­ce.</p>
   <p>    Resso had ma­na­ged to grill the day's catch tas­tily, with a mi­ni­mum of bur­ning, ske­we­red on twigs over the fi­re. With that and jo­ur­ney-ca­ke, and swe­et wa­ter from the stre­am at the­ir backs, they ma­de a sa­tisf­ying me­al. They had thrown the bo­nes in­to the fi­re and we­re re­ady to di­vi­de the night in­to watc­hes, when a vo­ice from the dark­ness sa­lu­ted them.</p>
   <p>    "Hello the camp!"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian knew that vo­ice, and had be­en ho­ping to he­ar it. He sto­od up eagerly and wa­ved in the di­rec­ti­on from which it had co­me. The El­ven­ba­ne wal­ked calmly in­to the ma­ge­light circ­le wit­ho­ut trip­ping over the li­ne of bells.</p>
   <p>    "Well met, Lord Kyrti­an! Go­od idea, tho­se bells," she re­mar­ked che­er­ful­ly, as she jo­ined them be­si­de the fi­re and of­fe­red Kyrti­an her hand. To­day she was we­aring a pa­ir of bre­ec­hes and a tu­nic of so­met­hing glit­te­ring and blue, co­ve­red with jewel-li­ke sca­les, a wic­ked-lo­oking kni­fe strap­ped over it. Her abun­dant auburn ha­ir had be­en bo­und back at the na­pe of her neck in a se­ve­re knot.</p>
   <p>    The men we­re sta­ring at this unex­pec­ted vi­si­tor with the­ir mo­uths drop­ping wi­de open.</p>
   <p>    "Gentlemen," Kyrti­an sa­id so­lemnly, firmly rep­res­sing the ur­ge to la­ugh at them as he ac­cep­ted Las­ha­na's hand. "May I pre­sent to you Las­ha­na? Al­so known as the El­ven­ba­ne-"</p>
   <p>    If he had set off anot­her of tho­se exp­lo­si­ve le­vin-bolts in the­ir midst he co­uldn't ha­ve got­ten a mo­re in­te­res­ting re­ac­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Noet prac­ti­cal­ly cho­ked, Ho­bie and Shal­van let out in­vo­lun­tary who­ops of surp­ri­se, Res­so le­apt to his fe­et we­aring an exp­res­si­on of such ut­ter shock that Kyrti­an wo­uld not ha­ve be­en surp­ri­sed to see him fa­int de­ad away in the next mo­ment. Only Lynder ma­na­ged to re­ta­in his com­po­su­re. He got to his fe­et, gat­he­red his yo­ung dig­nity abo­ut him, and to­ok the hand that Kyrti­an re­lin­qu­is­hed.</p>
   <p>    "My lady, this is an ho­nor, and a pri­vi­le­ge," he rep­li­ed, bo­wing over the hand be­fo­re re­le­asing it.</p>
   <p>    "Oh pish," she sa­id, blus­hing a lit­tle, but cle­arly ple­ased. "Didn't Lord Kyrti­an tell you that I'd be in­ter­cep­ting you out he­re?"</p>
   <p>    "Lord Kyrti­an didn't know you wo­uld, he only ho­ped you wo­uld," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed for him­self. "Won't you jo­in us?"</p>
   <p>    How she had got­ten the­re, how long she had be­en out in the wo­ods watc­hing them, he didn't know. And, truth to tell, it didn't mat­ter. As his men to­ok the­ir se­ats aga­in and Las­ha­na set­tled easily among them, it was very cle­ar why this yo­ung lady wi­zard had be­co­me a le­ader. She drew all eyes to­wards her in a way that had not­hing to do with her lo­oks or her sex.</p>
   <p>    "Well, he­re's what I can tell you," she be­gan. "We-the Wi­zards-ha­ve got watc­hers on yo­ur es­ta­te, my Lord, and that of Lady Mort­he­na. If anyt­hing sho­uld thre­aten them, we'll know, and we'll be ab­le to eva­cu­ate as many or as few pe­op­le ne­ed to be got­ten out." She dimp­led. "And may I say, that is qu­ite a ce­leb­ra­ti­on yo­ur pe­op­le are put­ting on! I'd li­ke to ask yo­ur mot­her if she wo­uld or­ga­ni­ze one for us, so­me day, when things are-mo­re stab­le."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian felt a gre­at we­ight lift from his sho­ul­ders, but Las­ha­na's next words ma­de him ten­se aga­in. "A cer­ta­in Lady Tri­ana-" she arc­hed her brow at him, and he nod­ded grimly his ack­now­led­ge­ment that he knew the Lady, "-pa­id anot­her, very short vi­sit to Lady Mort­he­na af­ter you left. She cla­imed that she wis­hed to con­sult Lady Mort­he­na's fa­vo­ri­te lib­rary, and in­de­ed, she left aga­in wit­hin a few ho­urs. She ar­ri­ved and de­par­ted by me­ans of a tem­po­rary Ga­te set up just out­si­de the Lady's es­ta­te. I don't sup­po­se you can cast any light on what she was lo­oking for?"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian sho­ok his he­ad re­luc­tantly. "I ha­ven't a clue. But kno­wing Tri­ana, it can't be for an­yo­ne's go­od but her own."</p>
   <p>    Lashana snor­ted. "Be­li­eve me, I know. I've had-so­me ex­pe­ri­en­ce of the Lady myself."</p>
   <p>    "My con­do­len­ces." That res­pon­se start­led a smi­le from her.</p>
   <p>    "The army-mi­nus yo­ur cont­ri­bu­ti­on of tro­ops-has mo­ved ne­arer to the tra­de-city of Pret­hon, whe­re it's easi­er to supply. I'm as­su­ming that in the ab­sen­ce of an ac­tu­al pla­ce to put them per­ma­nently, that's whe­re they'll stay, cam­ped just out­si­de the city walls." Las­ha­na's gre­en eyes twink­led. "Which is, of co­ur­se, pre­ci­sely whe­re we'd li­ke them, as far from our new Ci­ta­del as pos­sib­le, which was why we sug­ges­ted this pla­ce as the lo­ca­ti­on of the ima­gi­nary Wi­zards. Even if they de­ci­ded you we­ren't mo­ving fast eno­ugh for them, this is mi­se­rab­le co­untry to try and do any hun­ting of in­vi­sib­le pe­op­le in, and the pla­ce is ab­so­lu­tely hol­low with ca­ves. You co­uld spend a cen­tury trying to hunt thro­ugh them all!"</p>
   <p>    "Actually-I wan­ted to ask you abo­ut that, Las­ha­na," Kyrti­an sa­id he­si­tantly. "Do you ha­ve the ti­me to he­ar so­me his­tory?"</p>
   <p>    When she nod­ded, he la­unc­hed in­to the story-as he had puz­zled it out-of the An­ces­tors' ar­ri­val in this world, and fol­lo­wed it with the mo­re per­so­nal ta­le of his fat­her's own in­te­rest in that ar­ri­val and the things that might ha­ve be­en left be­hind. "So the last pla­ce whe­re he was do­ing re­se­arch be­fo­re he di­sap­pe­ared was Lady Moth's lib­rary-and that was whe­re I fo­und so­me per­so­nal jo­ur­nals that ga­ve desc­rip­ti­ons that so­un­ded li­ke this area-" He wa­ved his hand at the drip­ping fo­rest be­yond the camp. "You must ad­mit that it's pretty dis­tinc­ti­ve. And the very few pas­sa­ges that desc­ri­bed the Cros­sing ma­de me think that the An­ces­tors might ha­ve co­me out in­to a ca­ve, and not abo­veg­ro­und as ever­yo­ne has al­ways as­su­med. Then when we sta­ged at Lord Chey­nar's," he conc­lu­ded tri­ump­hantly, "Lord Chey­nar ad­mit­ted that my fat­her had go­ne off in­to the­se fo­rests, and that he was pro­bably the last El­ven­lord to see my fat­her ali­ve!"</p>
   <p>    Lashana pur­sed her lips tho­ught­ful­ly. "That-that's in­te­res­ting. You know, I dis­co­ve­red that Wi­zards, at le­ast, can use gem-sto­nes to help con­cent­ra­te and amp­lify the­ir po­wers. I don't know if they'll work for El­ven­lords that way, but it stands to re­ason that if our po­wers can be amp­li­fi­ed by so­met­hing, so can yo­urs."</p>
   <p>    "I can't see any ot­her way that the An­ces­tors co­uld ha­ve bu­ilt the things that they did," he ad­mit­ted. She til­ted her he­ad to the si­de.</p>
   <p>    "It's a very go­od thing that I trust you, Lord Kyrti­an," she sa­id in a me­asu­red to­ne. "Other­wi­se I don't think I co­uld al­low you to le­ave the­se wo­ods ali­ve."</p>
   <p>    Lynder le­apt to his fe­et, his hand on his dag­ger-hilt, and the ot­hers we­ren't far be­hind. Las­ha­na ap­pe­ared un­con­cer­ned.</p>
   <p>    And she pro­bably has go­od re­ason to be. She'd be a fo­ol to ha­ve co­me he­re alo­ne, and no mat­ter what the El­ven­ba­ne is, no one has ever sus­pec­ted her of be­ing a fo­ol.</p>
   <p>    "Sit down, all of you," he sa­id mildly. "Don't you re­ali­ze what a hor­rib­le me­na­ce wo­uld be let lo­ose in the world if so­me­one li­ke Ael­mar­kin got his hands on a way to ma­ke him­self as strong as Lord Kyndreth? She's only spe­aking sen­se."</p>
   <p>    She ma­de a lit­tle ges­tu­re of thanks in his di­rec­ti­on. "Now, the­re's one ot­her thing I'd li­ke to show you, so­met­hing my pe­op­le will shortly be han­ding out to Moth's and yo­urs, among ot­hers, then dist­ri­bu­ting co­vertly among the fi­eld-sla­ves." She held out a lit­tle obj­ect, sha­ped rat­her li­ke an open clams­hell, of a dull grey me­tal. He star­ted to re­ach for it, and she has­tily pul­led it back.</p>
   <p>    "Don't to­uch it, Lord Kyrti­an!" she war­ned. "At le­ast, not with yo­ur ba­re hand! That's what you call De­ath Me­tal-for­ged iron."</p>
   <p>    He has­tily drew back his fin­gers. He'd to­uc­hed unp­ro­tec­ted ste­el be­fo­re, in the sha­pe of one of the iron col­lars that Moth's own sla­ves wo­re un­der the­ir pse­udo-sla­ve col­lars, and it had bur­ned him li­ke acid. He was in no hurry to re­pe­at the ex­pe­ri­en­ce.</p>
   <p>    "I bro­ught an ac­ti­ve sla­ve-col­lar with me to show you what it do­es," she con­ti­nu­ed. "Watch-with yo­ur ma­gic-sen­ses." She to­ok out a le­at­her sla­ve-col­lar set with a clo­udy beryl, which was, in­de­ed, ac­ti­ve. She fit­ted the back half of the clams­hell device be­hind the beryl, then snap­ped the top half over it, and nip­ped a catch to squ­e­eze it clo­sed and lock it.</p>
   <p>    The Elfs­to­ne went de­ad to his sen­ses. He lo­oked at her hand, with the dull-grey obj­ect loc­ked aro­und what had be­en an ac­ti­ve de­vi­ce for the comp­le­te cont­rol of a sla­ve, dumb­fo­un­ded. Then he lo­oked up in­to her kno­wing eyes.</p>
   <p>    "Ancestors-" he bre­at­hed. "You've do­ne it. You've fo­und a way-snap one of tho­se over a col­lar-sto­ne, and you can cut the col­lar right off wit­ho­ut hur­ting the sla­ve!"</p>
   <p>    "Or le­ave the col­lar on, it won't mat­ter, and any ma­gic that an over­se­er flings at a fle­e­ing sla­ve will simply mis­fi­re," she po­in­ted out, ba­rely con­ce­aling her glee. "We ha­ve the iron, we ha­ve the crafts­men, and we ha­ve the ways to get the­se in­to the hands of the sla­ves. Wit­hin months, yo­ur Yo­ung Lords and my Wi­zards will be the last things that the Gre­at Lords will be wor­rying abo­ut!"</p>
   <p>    "Slave re­volts-" mur­mu­red Shal­van, won­de­ringly.</p>
   <p>    "All over the es­ta­tes," Las­ha­na ag­re­ed. "Which is why I'm he­re with you. Every mo­ment of ti­me that you can buy us with yo­ur wi­zard-hun­ting will enab­le us to ma­ke that many mo­re of the­se de­vi­ces, and bring the mo­ment of fre­edom for all hu­mans that much clo­ser."</p>
   <p>    "At which po­int, my lord," Lynder po­in­ted out dif­fi­dently, "Our pe­op­le will al­so be the very last thing that the Gre­at Lords will be wor­rying abo­ut."</p>
   <p>    "Except that-if you and yo­urs can pull this off, Las­ha­na-" he ba­red his te­eth in a fe­ral grin, the re­col­lec­ti­on of the sto­ri­es he'd he­ard from the mist­re­ated sla­ves shel­te­ring with Moth fresh in his mind "-you may con­si­der my es­ta­te to be the tra­ining gro­und for a new hu­man army!"</p>
   <p>    He held out his hand; she clas­ped it joy­ful­ly, as his men ma­de the so­unds of sub­du­ed che­ering-even now, they didn't want to aro­use the at­ten­ti­on of things that might be out the­re in the dark­ness.</p>
   <p>    "Lord Kyrti­an-" she se­emed to be se­arc­hing for words, then ga­ve up al­to­get­her, and just sho­ok her he­ad, her fa­ce ra­di­ant with smi­les. "Thank you-se­ems ina­de­qu­ate."</p>
   <p>    "It's early days yet," he war­ned, as the men set­tled down, alt­ho­ugh he co­uld not help but fe­el a lit­tle in­to­xi­ca­ted with the he­ady in­tel­lec­tu­al wi­ne she had just po­ured for him. "We've a long way to go."</p>
   <p>    "So we ha­ve." She so­be­red as well, and star­ted to stow the iron de­vi­ce and the col­lar in her belt-po­uch, then evi­dently tho­ught bet­ter of it and han­ded it to Lynder. "He­re. If you've got craf­ters and a so­ur­ce of De­ath Me­tal, you might want to start dup­li­ca­ting the­se yo­ur­self."</p>
   <p>    Lynder nod­ded, and sto­wed the de­vi­ce away.</p>
   <p>    "Now-about the ca­ves and yo­ur fat­her-I think I might be ab­le to help nar­row yo­ur se­arch a lit­tle. You see, I've run the­se hills myself." Las­ha­na then be­gan a ta­le of her own, abo­ut the ti­me when she, a me­re child then and not yet the El­ven­ba­ne, had res­cu­ed a band of hu­man child­ren-with hu­man ma­gic- who we­re go­ing to be cul­led by Lord Tre­ves's over­se­er.</p>
   <p>    Lord Tre­ves-wo­uld that be Lady Vi­ri­di­na's Lord? Moth's fri­end? What an odd co­in­ci­den­ce!</p>
   <p>    Lashana had hel­ped them es­ca­pe and flee in­to the­se very hil­ls-and, by anot­her odd co­in­ci­den­ce, had run in­to the in­fa­mo­us yo­ung Lord Valyn, fle­e­ing with his wi­zard­ling half-brot­her and lo­oking for Wi­zards to pro­tect them both.</p>
   <p>    The story was an ab­sor­bing one, and Las­ha­na told it well. He co­uld see in his mind's eye the hud­dle of frigh­te­ned child­ren, the drenc­hed and mi­se­rab­le yo­ung Valyn and the equ­al­ly mi­se­rab­le Me­ro. She desc­ri­bed the stran­ge mons­ters they had en­co­un­te­red, one of which so­un­ded eerily fa­mi­li­ar.</p>
   <p>    "I think we ne­arly ran in­to one of tho­se-invi­sib­le lur­king things back the­re," No­et sa­id tho­ught­ful­ly, and desc­ri­bed be­ing trap­ped bet­we­en it and the ali­corn herd, and how Kyrti­an had sol­ved the si­tu­ati­on.</p>
   <p>    "Which is why he's the ge­ne­ral, and we aren't," Lynder put in, as Las­ha­na sho­ok her he­ad in ama­zed ad­mi­ra­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "That cer­ta­inly so­unds li­ke one of them-well, as you mo­ve de­eper in­to the hills, mo­re or less in that di­rec­ti­on-" she po­in­ted "-and don't worry, we can gu­ide you to­mor­row-the wi­erd­lings get thic­ker, and od­der. Now, sup­po­se that this Por­tal of yo­urs isn't en­ti­rely clo­sed? I've he­ard from Shey­re­na and Lorryn that yo­ur An­ces­tors left a pretty nasty pla­ce to co­me he­re…" She lo­oked at him with spe­cu­la­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    He nod­ded. "If the Por­tal isn't qu­ite clo­sed and shut down, yes, things co­uld slip over, when eno­ugh re­si­du­al po­wer bu­ilt up to let the Por­tal open for a mo­ment. And what ca­me over wo­uld be very unp­le­asant."</p>
   <p>    "And the area ne­arest whe­re they we­re co­ming thro­ugh?" she promp­ted.</p>
   <p>    "Would be the pla­ce ne­arest the Por­tal, of co­ur­se." He felt anot­her burst of ela­ti­on-but then worry. "That wo­uld ma­ke it that much mo­re dan­ge­ro­us. I'm not su­re I sho­uld ask you fel­lows to sha­re in so­met­hing li­ke this-it's pretty cer­ta­in that Fat­her is-de­ad-"</p>
   <p>    There. He'd sa­id it. It co­uldn't be un­sa­id.</p>
   <p>    "-so lo­oking for what be­ca­me of him is re­al­ly only my con­cern-"</p>
   <p>    "Balderdash! Beg­ging yo­ur par­don, my Lord," Lynder exc­la­imed. "Yo­ur fat­her, and his fat­her, and his fat­her be­fo­re him, are the ones that al­lo­wed us to grow up in fre­edom. It's as much our con­cern as yo­urs."</p>
   <p>    "And my pe­op­le ha­ve-ways of de­aling with most of the­se cre­atu­res, or get­ting you aro­und them," Las­ha­na ad­ded. "We've both got ma­gic, you know, and mi­ne's eno­ugh dif­fe­rent from yo­urs that they'll com­bi­ne well. I'd be ple­ased to help you out, he­re."</p>
   <p>    "It's set­tled, then," Shal­van sa­id, as the rest of his men nod­ded.</p>
   <p>    Once aga­in, Kyrti­an felt a sur­ge of emo­ti­ons-pri­de, gra­ti­tu­de, a to­uch of em­bar­ras­sment. But most of all, the warmth of kno­wing that they wo­uld sup­port him, and they knew that he wo­uld sup­port them, thro­ugh anyt­hing. And a dif­fe­rent kind of warmth, of dis­co­ve­ring an unex­pec­ted fri­end and com­ra­de in the wo­man cal­led the El­ven­ba­ne, who was so very dif­fe­rent, and so very much mo­re, than he had ever ima­gi­ned her to be.</p>
   <p>    "Then in the mor­ning-?" he ma­de it a qu­es­ti­on. She la­ug­hed and sto­od up.</p>
   <p>    "In the mor­ning you can ex­pect me-and a fri­end," she pro­mi­sed. "And un­til then, sle­ep well. And don't worry, you're be­ing gu­ar­ded. So get a go­od night's sle­ep."</p>
   <p>    And with that, she wal­ked off in­to the dark­ness.</p>
   <p>    And ma­na­ged, aga­in, not to trip over the bells.</p>
   <p>    "My Lord," sa­id Shal­van, lo­oking af­ter her with un­dis­gu­ised ad­mi­ra­ti­on, "beg­ging yo­ur par­don myself, but that is one fi­ne wo­man. Not to my tas­te," he ad­ded has­tily, "but one fi­ne wo­man."</p>
   <p>    "Yes she is," Kyrti­an ag­re­ed. "And not to my tas­te, eit­her! But I ho­pe she finds a man who de­ser­ves her, as­su­ming that's what she wants! I will ma­ke no as­sump­ti­ons abo­ut anyt­hing the El­ven­ba­ne might want!"</p>
   <p>    That start­led a la­ugh out of them, and on that no­te, they to­ok to the­ir tents, and to bed, kno­wing that the mor­row wo­uld be­gin an en­ti­rely new and stran­ger qu­est than they had ever ima­gi­ned.</p>

   <p>    Triana set her jaw grimly as she pa­ced in and out of the bars of sun­light po­uring thro­ugh the win­dows of her so­lar-a tra­di­ti­onal part of the bo­wer, whe­re she sel­dom spent any ti­me. Why bot­her, when she was the mist­ress of the en­ti­re man­se?</p>
   <p>    It lo­oked as if she was go­ing to ha­ve to le­ave her do­ma­in, for a short, but dis­tinctly un­com­for­tab­le qu­est. Of all the things she wo­uld ha­ve pre­fer­red not to do, this was go­ing to be right on the top of the list. She did not enj­oy "the out­do­ors," she lo­at­hed ha­ving to camp wit­ho­ut pro­per ame­ni­ti­es, and she des­pi­sed ra­in, damp, driz­zle and cold. But she was go­ing to ha­ve to en­du­re all of that, be­ca­use whe­re she was go­ing and what she ne­eded to do re­qu­ired sec­recy.</p>
   <p>    Her skirts swis­hed aro­und her ank­les with a his­sing so­und. She ha­ted this idea. But she co­uldn't trust Ael­mar­kin; she co­uldn't trust him to be any fit­ter for tra­iling so­me­one in the sa­va­ge fo­rest than she, and she was pretty cer­ta­in he wo­uld try to ke­ep wha­te­ver he fo­und all to him­self. She had fa­iled in her at­tempt to sub­vert his bo­ring co­usin for now-she was gra­te­ful that she hadn't put any term on the bet with Ael­mar­kin-but Kyrti­an's on­go­ing suc­cess was ma­king Ael­mar­kin im­pa­ti­ent. Not that she ca­red whet­her she lost the bet. It wo­uldn't be all that dif­fi­cult to tra­in one stu­pid sla­ve for Ael­mar­kin's use. No, the thing it­self had be­co­me a chal­len­ge, an ob­ses­si­on. She wo­uld not be be­aten, not in this, not when it was only her own skill and wit that sto­od bet­we­en her and fa­ilu­re. For on­ce, she didn't ha­ve to rely on an­yo­ne el­se.</p>
   <p>    It hadn't ta­ken long in a con­ver­sa­ti­on via te­le­son with Lord Kyndreth to dis­co­ver what Kyrti­an was up to and whe­re he was go­ing-openly. That was the key; Kyrti­an might be pom­po­us, might be de­adly dull, but af­ter his de­ci­si­ve vic­tory over the Yo­ung Lords no one wo­uld ever cla­im that he was stu­pid.</p>
   <p>    She kic­ked the tra­in of her skirt out of her way im­pa­ti­ently as she tur­ned. No, he wasn't stu­pid. And just be­ca­use he was dull, that didn't me­an he wasn't ca­pab­le of ke­eping so­me things to him­self.</p>
   <p>    Triana had her own ide­as of what el­se might be go­ing on, when a qu­ick check with Lord Kyndreth con­fir­med that Kyrti­an was plan­ning on a new ex­pe­di­ti­on at the be­hest of the Co­un­cil. What hadn't ma­de any sen­se was why he wo­uld ha­ve be­en in­te­res­ted in the ca­ves be­ne­ath tho­se hills be­fo­re that se­cond batch of Wi­zards ma­de an ap­pe­aran­ce. Be­ca­use he had be­en- she knew it, be­ca­use she knew so­me of the qu­es­ti­ons he'd be­en as­king, and so­me of the maps and bo­oks he'd be­en re­qu­es­ting, be­fo­re the two mind-addled cap­ti­ves had ap­pe­ared in Lord Chey­nar's fo­rest.</p>
   <p>    It hadn't ma­de any sen­se, that is, un­til she vi­si­ted Mort­he­na aga­in, de­ter­mi­ned what he'd be­en do­ing the­re in the first pla­ce, and fer­re­ted out just what bo­oks he'd be­en lo­oking at. The two sla­ves who had be­en hel­ping him we­re no chal­len­ge to her; wit­hin mo­ments, she had them eagerly pul­ling vo­lu­mes down for her pe­ru­sal.</p>
   <p>    Now she knew. And she was, per­haps, bet­ter than any ot­her El­ven­lord, equ­ip­ped to fi­gu­re out what Kyrti­an's ul­te­ri­or mo­ti­ves we­re. The­re we­re her own fa­mi­li­al tra­di­ti­ons of the Crossing, and jo­ur­nals she had idly le­afed thro­ugh in mo­ments of bo­re­dom. Put­ting Kyrti­an's sud­den fas­ci­na­ti­on with the jo­ur­nals in Mort­he­na's lib­rary to­get­her with his fat­her's li­fe­long ob­ses­si­on with fin­ding the Ga­te, and she knew, she knew, that he ex­pec­ted to find, at long last, so­me tra­ce of his fat­her.</p>
   <p>    But as im­por­tant, gi­ven Lord Kyrti­an's new-fo­und im­por­tan­ce as a mi­li­tary le­ader to the Gre­at Lords, we­re the we­apons sup­po­sedly left be­hind as use­less. With tho­se we­apons, Lord Kyrti­an wo­uld not ne­ed an army to im­po­se the will of the Gre­at Lords. With tho­se we­apons, he co­uld be­co­me a Gre­at Lord him­self. Per­haps mo­re than that. Per­haps-the­ir first king?</p>
   <p>    Perhaps. That dull ex­te­ri­or might con­ce­al a gre­at de­al of am­bi­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Unless so­me­one el­se got the­re at the sa­me ti­me. So­me­one who co­uld bring ac­cu­ra­te in­for­ma­ti­on back to-say-Lord Kyndreth.</p>
   <p>    Or so­me­one who co­uld use that in­for­ma­ti­on for her­self.</p>
   <p>    Triana li­ked to ke­ep her plans flu­id. Which was why her sla­ves we­re put­ting to­get­her the ge­ar that she and two ma­le sla­ves-men who knew how to hunt and track-wo­uld ta­ke thro­ugh the ne­arest Ga­te and on to the thri­ce-be­dam­ned ra­in-so­aked fo­rest that Lord Chey­nar's es­ta­te bor­de­red.</p>
   <p>    Lord Chey­nar did not ap­pro­ve of Tri­ana. No mat­ter. She didn't ne­ed his ap­pro­val, and she didn't ne­ed his help. She didn't even ne­ed to get on­to his lands; she had only to jo­ur­ney to his es­ta­te and fol­low the fen­ces and walls aro­und it, en­te­ring the fo­rest whe­re she ple­ased. Her men we­re go­od eno­ugh to find Kyrti­an's track and fol­low it.</p>
   <p>    Even if that me­ant she did ha­ve to camp in a wretc­hed fo­rest in the cons­tant ra­in. Just be­ca­use Tri­ana lo­ved her com­forts, that didn't me­an she wasn't per­fectly pre­pa­red to sac­ri­fi­ce them wit­ho­ut he­si­ta­ti­on for the right in­cen­ti­ve.</p>
   <p>    Without he­si­ta­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Not wit­ho­ut comp­la­int. She kic­ked sa­va­gely at her tra­in.</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin bro­oded over the inj­us­ti­ce of the world from the com­fort of a fa­vo­ri­te lo­un­ge, sta­ring at a de­li­ca­te sto­ne sculp­tu­re of a dan­cer as if it had of­fen­ded him per­so­nal­ly.</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin did not trust his co­usin. The­re was mo­re, much mo­re, to this bu­si­ness of pur­su­ing stu­pid Wi­zards in a half-inac­ces­sib­le fo­rest than ap­pe­ared on the sur­fa­ce. Kyrti­an might be dull, he might be ob­ses­si­ve, but he wasn't stu­pid.</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin tra­ced a circ­le in the up­hols­tery with his fin­ger­na­il. Kyrti­an was not go­ing on what Ael­mar­kin wo­uld con­si­der a "mi­li­tary ex­pe­di­ti­on." He wasn't ta­king any ot­her El­ven­lords with him, nor was he ta­king a very lar­ge party. In fact, he wasn't ta­king any sla­ves ot­her than tho­se from his own ho­use­hold; eit­her he was ri­di­cu­lo­usly su­re of him­self, or…</p>
   <p>    … or he tho­ught the­re was so­met­hing in that fo­rest that he co­uld use for him­self. What co­uld it be?</p>
   <p>    There had to be so­met­hing. The­re was no re­ason to ta­ke that sort of risk, un­less the­re was a po­wer­ful re­ason for it. So­met­hing to do with the Wi­zards them­sel­ves? Ael­mar­kin hadn't he­ard anyt­hing that ma­de them so­und dif­fe­rent from the ones that had al­re­ady be­en dri­ven out in­to the wil­der­ness. Qu­ite to the cont­rary, in fact, it se­emed very much as if they we­re fe­wer.</p>
   <p>    Except…</p>
   <p>    Except that they al­so had that cu­ri­o­us abi­lity to nul­lify ma­gic that the Yo­ung Lords had so­me­how ac­qu­ired!</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin slap­ped the arm of his lo­un­ge with a fe­eling of angry tri­umph. Of co­ur­se that was it! So far, no one had ma­na­ged to catch any of the ring­le­aders, so no one knew just what the trick was-but if Kyrti­an co­uld cap­tu­re a Wi­zard and get the ans­wer that way, he'd be in a po­si­ti­on to de­mand, and get, anyt­hing he wan­ted from the Co­un­cil, inc­lu­ding a Co­un­cil se­at even if the­re we­re no va­can­ci­es!</p>
   <p>    And if that hap­pe­ned-Ael­mar­kin's chan­ces of get­ting the es­ta­te drop­ped to less than ze­ro. For all the­ir bic­ke­ring, no Co­un­cil mem­ber had ever be­en known to back a mo­ve to oust anot­her Co­un­cil mem­ber from his lands, po­si­ti­on, or se­at, and not just be­ca­use it "wasn't do­ne." They gu­ar­ded the­ir pri­macy je­alo­usly, and when an out­si­der thre­ate­ned one, he thre­ate­ned all, and they clo­sed ranks aga­inst him.</p>
   <p>    For a mo­ment, Ael­mar­kin des­pa­ired, and be­gan po­un­ding the arm of his lo­un­ge with frust­ra­ted fury. He bro­ke the un­derl­ying wooden fra­me with a crack, but his an­ger didn't ease un­til the arm of the lo­un­ge sag­ged, its struc­tu­re re­du­ced to frag­ments.</p>
   <p>    Finally his tem­per wo­re out, and he was ab­le to think cle­arly. He left his study and went out in­to his gar­dens to con­ti­nue thin­king. The sky was over­cast, but the pall over his spi­rit was dar­ker than the grey sky.</p>
   <p>    He had to think… as he pa­ced, his fe­et ma­king no no­ise on the vel­vety sod of the paths, he ig­no­red the mur­mur of fo­un­ta­ins and ar­ti­fi­ci­al wa­ter­fal­ls he pas­sed.</p>
   <p>    First, this all might co­me to not­hing, but he didn't da­re to ta­ke that chan­ce. Kyrti­an was too go­od at fin­ding what he wan­ted to find. Per­sis­tent-obsti­na­tely per­sis­tent.</p>
   <p>    Second, it was just ba­rely pos­sib­le that Kyrti­an wo­uld fa­il; eit­her he wo­uldn't find a wi­zard or he wo­uldn't be ab­le to ta­ke one cap­ti­ve. Ael­mar­kin tho­ught so­urly that this was not so­met­hing he sho­uld co­unt on; Kyrti­an's luck had be­en dis­gus­tingly go­od. Per­sis­ten­ce and go­od luck. It was dam­nably un­fa­ir.</p>
   <p>    Third-Third…</p>
   <p>    It hit him, blin­ding as a ray of sun lan­cing thro­ugh the clo­uds. He hadn't ever ex­pec­ted dup­li­city out of Kyrti­an-but he hadn't ex­pec­ted bril­li­an­ce, eit­her. What if all of this was a do­ub­le-ga­me?</p>
   <p>    What if Kyrti­an plan­ned, not to cap­tu­re a Wi­zard, but to tre­at with them? What if he in­ten­ded to ally with them?</p>
   <p>    Ridiculous tho­ught, of co­ur­se but-it stop­ped him in his tracks. Both be­ca­use of the auda­city of it, and the pos­si­bi­li­ti­es the me­re idea ope­ned up.</p>
   <p>    If the Gre­at Lords tho­ught that was what Kyrti­an had in mind, the­ir sup­port of him wo­uld not only col­lap­se, they'd turn on him. Rightly so, of co­ur­se; tre­ason didn't even be­gin to co­ver it.</p>
   <p>    Well, the­re was only one way to find out, and that was to fol­low Kyrti­an him­self. Even if Kyrti­an didn't me­an tre­ason, per­haps the ap­pe­aran­ce of tre­ason co­uld be ma­nu­fac­tu­red.</p>
   <p>    For the first ti­me in many days, Ael­mar­kin's spi­rits ro­se.</p>
   <p>    He even la­ug­hed out lo­ud at the tho­ught, his mind wor­king bu­sily. The first thing, of co­ur­se, wo­uld be to fol­low Kyrti­an and see if, aga­inst all pro­ba­bi­lity, Kyrti­an re­al­ly was a tra­itor. It wo­uld be best not to ha­ve to ma­nu­fac­tu­re anyt­hing out of who­le cloth. If he co­uld find even the ap­pe­aran­ce of dup­li­city, he co­uld bu­ild on that. This, of co­ur­se, me­ant that he co­uld not trust this to an­yo­ne el­se.</p>
   <p>    Least of all Lady Tri­ana.</p>
   <p>    He cur­led his lip in con­tempt, trying to ima­gi­ne Lady Tri­ana ac­tu­al­ly exer­ting her­self eno­ugh to fol­low Kyrti­an as far as Chey­nar's, much less ent­rust her­self to the pri­va­ti­ons of ro­ugh cam­ping. She co­uldn't be bot­he­red to vi­sit her own gar­dens wit­ho­ut a do­zen sla­ves, a pa­vi­li­on and cus­hi­ons.</p>
   <p>    No mat­ter. This wasn't so­met­hing to be sha­red with an­yo­ne. And the sa­ying was, af­ter all, that if you wan­ted to be su­re of so­met­hing, you had bet­ter see to it yo­ur­self.</p>
   <p>    Besides, the­re was one last pos­si­bi­lity, one that he do­ub­ted even Tri­ana, as ruth­less as she was, wo­uld think of. He co­uld ar­ran­ge a lit­tle "acci­dent" to be­fall Kyrti­an, es­pe­ci­al­ly if he had left that body­gu­ard of his be­hind.</p>
   <p>    Oh yes. Now he had it. Kyrti­an wo­uld not le­ave that fo­rest as he had en­te­red it. When he ca­me out, it wo­uld eit­her be as a pri­so­ner, or in a shro­ud.</p>
   <p>    For the first ti­me that day, he smi­led, and the sla­ve wal­king pa­ti­ently and in­vi­sibly be­hind him to supply wha­te­ver the mas­ter ne­eded shud­de­red at the sight of that smi­le.</p>
   <p>    Caellach Gwa­in pa­ced the une­ven sto­ne flo­or of his mi­se­rab­le ex­cu­se for a ro­om, brow fur­ro­wed, a ban­ked fi­re of an­ger in his gut that hadn't di­mi­nis­hed in the le­ast in the ti­me sin­ce that wretc­hed girl had de­ba­ted him in front of the en­ti­re po­pu­la­ti­on of the Ci­ta­del. How had he let him­self get drawn in­to that? A di­sas­ter, a to­tal di­sas­ter; and he still co­uldn't see whe­re it had all go­ne so hor­ribly wrong. He'd only told ever­yo­ne exactly the truth!</p>
   <p>    At the ti­me, it had se­emed li­ke a stro­ke of the pu­rest luck; the brat had no ex­pe­ri­en­ce at ma­king spe­ec­hes, and she didn't know how to exu­de the con­fi­dent aut­ho­rity that he cer­ta­inly co­uld. And over and abo­ve all of that, he had be­en the one in the right! Mi­se­rab­le cre­atu­re! How had she ma­na­ged it? How, when he had spo­ken not­hing that was not true, had she ma­na­ged to turn vir­tu­al­ly ever­yo­ne in the Ci­ta­del aga­inst him? By the ti­me he re­ali­zed that every word he spo­ke was tur­ning mo­re pe­op­le away from him, it had be­en too la­te.</p>
   <p>    He kic­ked a shoe out of his path with a sa­va­ge wish that it was the re­ar end of one of his so-cal­led "fri­ends" who had de­ser­ted him li­ke the co­wards that they we­re. As a con­se­qu­en­ce of that de­ba­te, he had be­en left ut­terly, comp­le­tely wit­ho­ut ser­vants. No one wo­uld lift a fin­ger to so much as ke­ep him from trip­ping over an obs­tac­le.</p>
   <p>    Even the hu­mans, even the hu­man child­ren, ig­no­red any com­mand he ga­ve them. If he wan­ted to eat, rat­her than enj­oying a me­al in qu­i­et dig­nity in his ro­om alo­ne, he had to trud­ge up to the ca­vern used as a com­mon di­ning hall, sit down at one of the com­mon benc­hes whe­re­ver he co­uld find a pla­ce, and ser­ve him­self from a com­mon pot. The­re co­uld not pos­sibly be anyt­hing mo­re deg­ra­ding than that-a re­gu­lar pu­nish­ment, thri­ce da­ily. How he ha­ted it! He didn't know what was wor­se; ha­ving to star­ve him­self un­til the last mo­ment and con­tent him­self with wha­te­ver the rest had left him so that he co­uld sit at a bench alo­ne, or bra­ving the crowd to get so­met­hing edib­le, but ha­ving to be­ar the snic­kers and the way pe­op­le os­ten­ta­ti­o­usly spre­ad them­sel­ves out so as to le­ave no ro­om at the­ir tab­les for him. At le­ast they we­re still per­mit­ting him to eat. The­re we­re a gro­wing num­ber of lo­ud re­marks every ti­me he ap­pe­ared that the­re sho­uld be a ru­le in the new Ci­ta­del abo­ut ha­ving to do so­me work if you wan­ted to eat.</p>
   <p>    Ingrates! He'd show them! If they for­ba­de him me­als, he'd go back to the old ways, and ste­al his own fo­od by ma­gic from the El­ven­lords' sto­res, and to the Net­her­world with Las­ha­na's stu­pid tre­aty! That wo­uld show them!</p>
   <p>    At le­ast he'd ha­ve so­met­hing de­cent then; re­al che­ese, re­al bre­ad, ham and sa­usa­ge. Hah. If he even filc­hed fo­od from the kitc­hens, he co­uld ha­ve anyt­hing he li­ked!</p>
   <p>    He tho­ught so­urly of his last me­al; harshly-fla­vo­red go­at-che­ese, stringy mut­ton and not much of it, so­me nasty mess of wild gre­ens, and bre­ad ma­de with co­ar­sely-gro­und flo­ur, he­avy and dark. If they wan­ted him "pu­nis­hed," die qu­ality of the fo­od around he­re was pu­nish­ment eno­ugh. How he lon­ged for the go­od things filc­hed from the El­ven­lords, the de­li­ca­tely-smo­ked me­ats, the fi­ne che­eses, swe­et but­ter and clot­ted cre­am, the ca­kes ma­de with pro­per flo­ur and swe­ete­ned with whi­te su­gar! His mo­uth wa­te­red at the me­re tho­ught of them.</p>
   <p>    He gla­red at the fi­re in his "fi­rep­la­ce"-for­tu­na­tely for him, he had se­cu­red this ro­om be­fo­re his cur­rent disg­ra­ce, so at le­ast it had a fi­rep­la­ce: If you wan­ted to call a me­re al­co­ve in the rock wall with an open-top­ped shaft punc­hed up to the sur­fa­ce with dra­co­nic rock-ma­gic a "fi­rep­la­ce." When it ra­ined up abo­ve, wa­ter drip­ped down in­to the fi­re, and when the wind blew wrong, it dro­ve the smo­ke back down in­to his ro­om. Right now it was ra­ining, and drops siz­zled and spat in the fla­mes, thre­ate­ning to put them out. If he wan­ted a fi­re, he now had to gat­her the wo­od him­self, and if he didn't want the pla­gu­ey thing clog­ged with ash, he had to swe­ep it out and dis­po­se of the as­hes him­self.</p>
   <p>    At le­ast he was put­ting so­me things over on them all. He knew very well when fi­re­wo­od was de­li­ve­red to ot­her ro­oms; he just hel­ped him­self when the oc­cu­pants we­re out. And as for the as­hes, well, he didn't swe­ep them any fart­her away than the hall, and ser­ve them all right. They co­uld eit­her swe­ep them up them­sel­ves or tramp­le them everyw­he­re; he didn't ca­re.</p>
   <p>    It had fi­nal­ly co­me down to this; a job he'd spent most of the day on un­til the an­ger in his he­art star­ted to in­ter­fe­re with his scrying spell. Spying with his own ma­gic on the Wi­zard­ling child­ren te­ac­hing his for­mer cro­ni­es the ma­gics that they used to trans­port them­sel­ves wit­ho­ut harm and mag­nify the­ir own po­wers, so that he co­uld le­arn to use tho­se ma­gics wit­ho­ut ha­ving to hu­mi­li­ate him­self furt­her. And he had to ha­ve tho­se les­sons, be­ca­use he had no cho­ice; if he wan­ted so­met­hing, he had to ob­ta­in it him­self, and he didn't ha­ve the po­wer he ne­eded, alo­ne.</p>
   <p>    And every day, new hu­mi­li­ati­ons we­re pi­led atop the old. No one ap­pe­ared to cle­an his qu­ar­ters, and he, he, had to eit­her do it him­self, or find so­met­hing one of the wretc­hed child­ren wan­ted and use it to bri­be the lit­tle be­ast to do the work! And, of co­ur­se, what they wan­ted was ne­ver so­me use­less trin­ket of his own or so­met­hing he co­uld just go and ap­prop­ri­ate from the sto­res, oh no-it was al­ways so­met­hing dif­fi­cult, and usu­al­ly so­met­hing he had to use his own po­wers to fetch from the old Ci­ta­del! It ma­de him so angry he co­uld hardly think for ho­urs af­ter­wards. He lon­ged for the days when he co­uld drop so­met­hing on the flo­or in the sup­re­me con­fi­den­ce that wha­te­ver it was wo­uld be whis­ked off im­me­di­ately to be dis­car­ded, put away, or cle­aned as the ca­se might be.</p>
   <p>    And it was all the fa­ult of that over­we­ening fe­ma­le.</p>
   <p>    She was up to so­met­hing, too. No go­od, of co­ur­se; that went wit­ho­ut sa­ying. He co­uld tell that the­re was so­met­hing in the air, so­met­hing clan­des­ti­ne go­ing on; from the way she ac­ted, from the way that lo­ver of hers ac­ted. He'd felt the trans­por­ta­ti­on spell be­ing trig­ge­red mo­re ti­mes than it sho­uld ha­ve be­en of la­te, now that he knew how to re­cog­ni­ze it. A no­isy ma­gic, that; not­hing subt­le abo­ut it, and oh so typi­cal of a fe­ma­le, to use so­met­hing that only drew at­ten­ti­on to the cas­ter. He knew how to use it him­self now, of co­ur­se, no thanks to an­yo­ne's ef­fort but his own. He'd go­ne back to the Old Ci­ta­del in per­son, to rum­ma­ge thro­ugh not only his own qu­ar­ters, but the ro­oms of as many ot­her pe­op­le as he co­uld be­fo­re he grew too ti­red and hungry to stay the­re any lon­ger. Af­ter all, if you didn't know or re­mem­ber what was in a par­ti­cu­lar pla­ce, you co­uldn't bring it back by ma­gic un­less you did so­me fa­irly pa­ins­ta­king scrying. He'd pi­led what he wan­ted in his ro­om when he co­uld, and he'd ma­de plenty of no­tes on what he co­uldn't pick up that he wan­ted in ot­her ro­oms. He was get­ting mo­re pos­ses­si­ons to­get­her now, be­si­des the arm­lo­ad of things he'd bro­ught back with him.</p>
   <p>    So he knew qu­ite eno­ugh abo­ut the trans­por­ta­ti­on spell to re­cog­ni­ze it, and the­re was no do­ubt in his mind that it was be­ing used a gre­at de­al by Las­ha­na her­self of la­te. And for what? The­re was no ne­ed to use it to bring li­ving things he­re any­mo­re, now that they had flocks of she­ep and go­ats and even cat­tle- you co­uld bring anyt­hing you wan­ted he­re qu­i­etly, with the old ma­gics that the Wi­zards had al­ways used be­fo­re, to ste­al what they wan­ted right out from be­ne­ath the no­ses of the El­ven­lords.</p>
   <p>    In fact-that pe­cu­li­ar dis­cor­dant fe­eling in the back of his skull sig­na­led that so­me­one wit­hin the Ci­ta­del had used that par­ti­cu­lar ma­gic aga­in. It had to be Las­ha­na. And in no way co­uld it be for an­yo­ne's go­od ex­cept that sel­fish brat's.</p>
   <p>    But no one, no one wo­uld be­li­eve a sing­le word he sa­id aga­inst her. Not the­ir de­ar El­ven­ba­ne, the per­son who had bro­ught them the dra­gons (tre­ac­he­ro­us, sne­aky be­asts, who­se minds co­uld shift as easily as the­ir sha­pes), the Tra­der clans (untrust­worthy, wild hu­man bar­ba­ri­ans), and the Iron Pe­op­le (folly to put fa­ith in any pe­op­le who we­re not only wild hu­man bar­ba­ri­ans, but who had the­ir own de­fen­ses aga­inst the El­ven-lords and didn't ne­ed al­li­es). Ever­yo­ne so easily for­got that it was be­ca­use of Las­ha­na that they had ne­eded tho­se "alli­es," and ne­eded to le­ave the­ir com­for­tab­le, easy li­fe in the old Ci­ta­del in the first pla­ce!</p>
   <p>    She was up to so­met­hing; he knew it, he co­uld tas­te it! She was up to so­met­hing, and it co­uld only me­an new tro­ub­le for ever­yo­ne el­se!</p>
   <p>    If only he co­uld find out abo­ut it be­fo­re everyt­hing fell apart-if he co­uld catch her at so­me folly and pro­ve she was up to so­met­hing that wo­uld only drag ever­yo­ne he­re in­to so­me new dan­ger, they'd all be­li­eve him aga­in!</p>
   <p>    That was it-that was it!</p>
   <p>    He kic­ked anot­her shoe from his path, but this ti­me with a tri­ump­hant cack­le of la­ugh­ter. That wo­uld ser­ve the brat her just des­serts! He'd use her own fancy ma­gics to spy on her and find out exactly whe­re she was go­ing-then he'd use mo­re of them to find out what she was do­ing! He'd catch her red-han­ded, and then he'd ha­ul her back to the Ci­ta­del and ma­ke her con­fess in front of ever­yo­ne! Oh, it wo­uld ser­ve her right for her own ma­gic to be used aga­inst her!</p>
   <p>    He tur­ned ab­ruptly and rum­ma­ged thro­ugh the lit­ter on his desk for the pi­ece of smo­ke-qu­artz that ser­ved him for a mag­ni­fi­er of his po­wer, then cle­ared a spa­ce and con­cent­ra­ted on the scrying spell. Las­ha­na didn't dis­co­ver everyt­hing abo­ut ma­gic, af­ter all! She hadn't be­en the one to le­arn that in scrying, you didn't ha­ve to lo­ok for a pla­ce you knew, or even a per­son-just a par­ti­cu­lar obj­ect or kind of obj­ect. That was how they filc­hed pro­vi­si­ons from the El­ven­lords, back in the go­od old days…</p>
   <p>    So rat­her than lo­ok for Las­ha­na-be­ca­use she might be aler­ted if she sen­sed so­me­one scrying for her-he lo­oked for an obj­ect. So­met­hing she al­ways wo­re. A dra­gon-skin belt, ma­de from the shed hi­de of her so-cal­led "fos­ter brot­her" and uni­que in that it had be­en dul­led with dye so that it didn't catch the eye the way the bril­li­antly co­lo­red skin nor­mal­ly did.</p>
   <p>    When he fo­und it, he wo­uld find her-then he wo­uld study whe­re she was ca­re­ful­ly-very ca­re­ful­ly.</p>
   <p>    Then the next ti­me she left, he wo­uld fol­low, a lit­tle be­hind. He'd find out whe­re she was go­ing, and what she was do­ing.</p>
   <p>    And the mo­ment that he fo­und out her sec­ret-</p>
   <p>    He clo­sed his hand in­to a fist, and smi­led.</p>

   <p>    Triana lay on her sto­mach on the cold, hard gro­und be­ne­ath a bush, pe­ering down at an en­camp­ment in the tiny val­ley be­low her. Wa­ter drip­ped down on the ho­od of her clo­ak from the branc­hes abo­ve her, and alt­ho­ugh the clo­ak it­self was wa­terp­ro­of, mist per­me­ated even the cle­verly-ma­gic­ked fab­ric so­mew­hat. It was not a com­for­tab­le po­si­ti­on, but her she­er as­to­nish­ment at the sight that lay be­ne­ath her al­lo­wed her to ig­no­re her dis­com­fort.</p>
   <p>    There was a camp­si­te down the­re in the miz­zle, with six or eight stan­ding fi­gu­res, put­ting the pla­ce to rights, and one sit­ting fi­gu­re. It was the se­ated one that had her at­ten­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "You see, my lady?" mur­mu­red the hu­man trac­ker in Tri-ana's ear. "It is as I told you. The­re is the El­ven­lord you wis­hed to find."</p>
   <p>    Well, it was an El­ven­lord, all right, but it was not the one she had in­ten­ded to find. Not that the trac­ker co­uld be bla­med in this ca­se. He didn't know what Lord Kyrti­an lo­oked li­ke, es­pe­ci­al­ly at a dis­tan­ce. He co­uldn't know that Kyrti­an, the fo­ol, would ne­ver ha­ve sat back and watc­hed whi­le his sla­ves put up a camp. But what in the na­me of all the An­ces­tors had got­ten Ael­mar­kin to stir his lazy be­hind and co­me out to this how­ling wil­der­ness?</p>
   <p>    She was rat­her ple­ased to see that he didn't lo­ok very happy. Hunc­hed over, el­bows on kne­es, even from he­re she co­uld see his frown. An­ces­tors! She co­uld fe­el his frown. His sla­ves we­re trying to light a fi­re and not ha­ving a lot of suc­cess with the wet wo­od; he slum­ped on a sto­ol be­ne­ath the shel­ter of his tent, watc­hing them. She co­uldn't tell what he was thin­king from he­re, but a mo­ment la­ter, he po­in­ted his fin­ger at the pi­le of wo­od and it ro­ared up, ca­using his sla­ves to le­ap back lest they be scorc­hed.</p>
   <p>    Could it be that he, too, was fol­lo­wing Kyrti­an? And wit­ho­ut ever bot­he­ring to in­form her?</p>
   <p>    She gro­und her te­eth in a sud­den fla­re of tem­per. The ner­ve of him! How da­re he-</p>
   <p>    But just as qu­ickly the tem­per sub­si­ded, be­ca­use she co­uldn't ho­nestly sus­ta­in it. Hadn't she ex­pec­ted this? And had she bot­he­red to tell him what she was plan­ning? Of co­ur­se not, so why be angry with him when she was do­ing the sa­me thing? And alt­ho­ugh to her this was just a wa­ger, to him it was a gre­at de­al mo­re than that. Eno­ugh to for­ce him in­to a pla­ce that was as ali­en and un­com­for­tab­le to him as it was to her.</p>
   <p>    Well, if he was fol­lo­wing Kyrti­an, she wo­uld just fol­low him! It wo­uld sa­ve her a gre­at de­al of work, for he was by no me­ans as wo­ods-wi­se as his co­usin, nor we­re his men. Only if he be­gan to flo­un­der wo­uld she ha­ve her men stri­ke out on the­ir own.</p>
   <p>    Meanwhile, Kyrti­an was bo­und to go un­derg­ro­und even­tu­al­ly; he had to lo­ok for Wi­zards, and he wan­ted to lo­ok for the Gre­at Por­tal, and both wo­uld be in ca­ves. If the ca­ves we­re as ex­ten­si­ve as ru­mor pa­in­ted them, it wo­uld be child's play to get ahe­ad of Ael­mar­kin.</p>
   <p>    "You've do­ne well," she whis­pe­red back to the sla­ve, who be­amed at her, the smi­le of pri­de trans­for­ming an ot­her­wi­se un­hand­so­me fa­ce. "Watch them. I will send Kar­tar to you. When they le­ave, you both fol­low. Send Kar­tar back to fetch us to whe­re they camp next."</p>
   <p>    "My lady," the sla­ve bo­wed. He was a hard man, as we­re the ot­hers she had with her; fo­rest-trac­kers all, they we­re used to the ro­ug­hest of con­di­ti­ons. He was out­fit­ted for the fo­rest, in to­ugh can­vas, sturdy bo­ots and a wa­terp­ro­of, ho­oded tu­nic. She wo­re the sa­me, with mo­di­fi­ca­ti­ons-an ad­di­ti­onal wa­terp­ro­of clo­ak, and her clot­hing ma­de of ma­te­ri­als that we­re just as to­ugh, but sof­ter to the skin. From the lo­ok of it, Ael­mar­kin had ta­ken no such pre­ca­uti­ons, and she smi­led grimly as she eased her way out from un­der the co­ver of the bush and back down the ot­her si­de of the hill, whe­re anot­her of her sla­ves awa­ited her.</p>
   <p>    He led her si­lently down a tang­le of de­er-tra­ils; only the An­ces­tors knew how he was fin­ding his way, and she didn't worry abo­ut it. That was his job, and he'd be­en tra­ined very, very well for it. She did wish, ho­we­ver, that the ne­ed for ste­alth had not re­qu­ired the hor­ses be ti­ed up qu­ite so far from Ael­mar­kin's camp. The thing abo­ut de­er-tra­ils was that the de­er didn't ca­re a bit if the­re we­re branc­hes stretc­hed ac­ross the path, or ro­ots to trip up the un­wary.</p>
   <p>    It was dusk by the ti­me she and her es­cort ro­de in­to a camp that was, thanks to her go­od sen­se in pic­king the right sort of sla­ves for this job, in much bet­ter sta­te than Ael­mar­kin's. The­re was a very small fi­re bur­ning be­ne­ath a cle­ver shel­ter of branc­hes that not only shi­el­ded it from most of the om­nip­re­sent ra­in but dis­si­pa­ted the smo­ke ri­sing from it so the­re wo­uld be no plu­me abo­ve the tre­es to bet­ray the­ir pre­sen­ce.</p>
   <p>    Good men. She was glad that she had bo­ught them from Lord Kyndreth, on­ce she'd le­ar­ned they we­re not only fo­res­ters, but had be­en tra­ined to ser­ve as war-sco­uts. They we­re ef­fi­ci­ent, unobt­ru­si­ve, qu­i­et-they al­re­ady knew how to work to­get­her as a te­am, and they didn't ne­ed cons­tant su­per­vi­si­on.</p>
   <p>    And they al­re­ady knew the­ir re­ward co­uld be very gre­at in­de­ed if they ser­ved her well. She'd gi­ven them a tas­te of it. The­re was a ti­me for the lash, and a ti­me for the vel­vet glo­ve, and when you ne­eded so­me­one's ut­most ef­fort in a skill, the vel­vet glo­ve was the only sen­sib­le cho­ice.</p>
   <p>    Besides, they we­ren't bad lo­oking, any of them, alt­ho­ugh they we­re craggy and ro­ugh-hewn-and they we­re a ple­asant chan­ge from her usu­al pretty toys.</p>
   <p>    So des­pi­te be­ing chil­led and damp, she bes­to­wed pra­ise all aro­und and ma­de su­re Kar­tar was well-pro­vi­si­oned as well as well-fed be­fo­re he set off to jo­in his fel­low trac­ker to ke­ep watch over Ael­mar­kin's camp. Dusk lin­ge­red for a long ti­me out he­re, and Kar­tar had a cle­ar tra­il to fol­low. He'd be in pla­ce by dark.</p>
   <p>    In spi­te of her dis­li­ke for this who­le si­tu­ati­on, things we­re be­co­ming in­te­res­ting. De­fi­ni­tely in­te­res­ting. She smi­led aga­in as she ac­cep­ted a pla­te of slightly-char­red me­at from one of the sla­ves and re­ti­red with it in­to the pri­vacy of her tiny tent. She might ne­ver for­gi­ve Kyrti­an if it tur­ned out he had led her out he­re on so­me idi­otic wild-go­ose cha­se, but if he hadn't-</p>
   <p>    If he hadn't, this might pro­ve to be the best op­por­tu­nity for up­set­ting the ba­lan­ce of po­wer among the Gre­at Lords that had co­me along in a whi­le.</p>
   <p>    And the­re was al­ways one ot­her pos­si­bi­lity she co­uld pur­sue-one which, gi­ven the cir­cums­tan­ces, co­uld pro­vi­de a lot of sa­tis­fac­ti­on even if this was a wild-go­ose cha­se.</p>
   <p>    If Ael­mar­kin hadn't told her whe­re he was go­ing and what he was up to, he pro­bably hadn't told an­yo­ne el­se. Ex­cept pos­sibly Chey­nar, and then it wo­uldn't ha­ve be­en much. Ever­yo­ne knew the­se we­re dan­ge­ro­us fo­rests. Her fo­rest-trac­kers had be­en tra­ined for war. His hadn't. And no one knew that she was in the­se hills as well.</p>
   <p>    So if he and his men just-di­sap­pe­ared-no one wo­uld be surp­ri­sed, nor was it li­kely that an­yo­ne wo­uld co­me lo­oking for him on­ce Chey­nar re­por­ted whe­re he'd go­ne.</p>
   <p>    She wo­uldn't win her bet-but she wo­uldn't lo­se it, eit­her. And it just might be worth vi­ola­ting every law and com­pact the Gre­at Lords had sworn just to see his fa­ce when she slit his thro­at.</p>
   <p>    This was the dar­kest fo­rest Kyrti­an had ever had the mis­for­tu­ne of cam­ping in. He fo­und him­self won­de­ring as he kept half of his con­cent­ra­ti­on on the con­ver­sa­ti­on aro­und the fi­re, and the ot­her half on the so­unds out in the wo­ods be­yond the camp, if the over­cast ski­es he­re ever lif­ted. Su­rely they had to at so­me po­int… it co­uldn't ra­in all the ti­me. Co­uld it?</p>
   <p>    And yet, the­re hadn't be­en so much as an ho­ur sin­ce they'd en­te­red the pla­ce when it hadn't at le­ast mis­ted. And it was a go­od thing that he and his men we­ren't de­pen­ding on that old saw of fin­ding north by lo­oking for moss on a tree trunk, be­ca­use moss grew everyw­he­re, thick as a car­pet in most pla­ces. If ever the­re was a spot me­ant by na­tu­re for am­bus­hes, this was it. So far they'd ma­na­ged to avo­id any mo­re of tho­se in­vi­sib­le wha­te­ver-they-we­res, but the very na­tu­re of the glo­om-la­den lands­ca­pe had his who­le gro­up edgy.</p>
   <p>    The snap of a twig bro­ught Kyrti­an and ever­yo­ne in his camp to ins­tant alert­ness. The whist­le of a skylark ca­me out of the dark­ness, and they all re­la­xed aga­in. A mo­ment la­ter, Sha­na and a yo­ung ma­le wi­zard wal­ked in­to the circ­le of light cast by the fi­re, the om­nip­re­sent mist spark­ling li­ke gems on the ed­ges of the­ir ho­ods.</p>
   <p>    "I don't know how you do that-get­ting past my sent­ri­es," Kyrti­an comp­la­ined go­od-na­tu­redly. "I ho­pe no one el­se can."</p>
   <p>    "Only hu­mans that ha­ve the­ir spe­ci­al ma­gic, dra­gons, and Wi­zards," Sha­na told him, grin­ning, as she set­tled down on a bit of log that one of the men rol­led to the fi­re for her. "Spe­aking of which-this is my fos­ter-brot­her, Ke­man."</p>
   <p>    "I am ple­ased to ma­ke yo­ur ac­qu­a­in­tan­ce," Kyrti­an sa­id po­li­tely, but wa­rily. "So, you're anot­her wi­zard, then-"</p>
   <p>    "Ah, ac­tu­al­ly, I'm not," the yo­ung man sa­id dif­fi­dently, with a glan­ce at the El­ven­ba­ne. "Sha­na thinks it's ti­me you we­re- ah-"</p>
   <p>    "If you're go­ing to trust us, we ha­ve to gi­ve you a re­ason," Sha­na sa­id briskly. "I've al­re­ady tal­ked this over with the ot­her le­aders, and they think it's ti­me for you to be ent­rus­ted with the big­gest sec­ret we ha­ve."</p>
   <p>    "Which-would be what, exactly?" Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, wis­hing she wo­uld just get stra­ight to wha­te­ver she was go­ing to say.</p>
   <p>    "First, just in­dul­ge me and do wha­te­ver it is that you nor­mal­ly do to dis­pel an il­lu­si­on or a gla­mor. Ke­man isn't exactly what he se­ems," Sha­na sa­id, and the­re was a cer­ta­in-to­ne in her vo­ice that ma­de him lo­ok at her with sus­pi­ci­on for a mo­ment. Just what was she up to, any­way? Was this "fos­ter brot­her" of hers fully El­ven-or per­haps hu­man? No, if he was human, the­re wo­uld be no ne­ed for all this sec­recy and fid­dling abo­ut.</p>
   <p>    But it was ob­vi­o­us that he wasn't go­ing to get any furt­her in­for­ma­ti­on out of the wo­man un­less he did as she as­ked, so, with a sigh, he gat­he­red thre­ads of ma­gic and wo­ve them in­to a net, cas­ting it over the two of them, just for go­od me­asu­re. He might as well see if the El­ven­ba­ne her­self was un­der a gla­mor.</p>
   <p>    Nothing hap­pe­ned. The two of them re­ma­ined exactly as they had be­en when they wal­ked in­to the fi­re­light.</p>
   <p>    Now Kyrti­an was puz­zled. Had the ma­gic be­en co­un­te­red? It co­uldn't ha­ve be­en def­lec­ted; he'd ha­ve se­en that. Co­uld they ha­ve ab­sor­bed it, then ne­ga­ted it? But how? "Are you car­rying so­met­hing new that works li­ke iron?" he as­ked. "Or ha­ve you-"</p>
   <p>    He ne­ver got a chan­ce to fi­nish his qu­es­ti­on, be­ca­use in the next mo­ment, the yo­ung man who had be­en stan­ding at the fi­re­si­de, lo­oking al­to­get­her as nor­mal as it was pos­sib­le for a wi­zard to lo­ok, sud­denly be­gan to… chan­ge. He didn't writ­he, exactly, but he blur­red and twis­ted in a way that in­du­ced a re­al­ly vi­olent ca­se of diz­zi­ness and na­usea. It felt as if so­met­hing was wrenc­hing Kyrti­an's eyes out of the­ir soc­kets and stir­ring up his guts at the sa­me ti­me, and Kyrti­an clap­ped his hand over his mo­uth and tur­ned away. He wasn't alo­ne; the rest of his men we­re do­ing the sa­me thing, the­ir comp­le­xi­ons in var­ying sha­des of gre­en.</p>
   <p>    What in the na­me of-</p>
   <p>    As so­on as he tur­ned his eyes away his symptoms sub­si­ded, and he lo­oked up, gla­ring at Las­ha­na, angry ac­cu­sa­ti­ons on his lips.</p>
   <p>    Which di­ed, as he con­ti­nu­ed to lo­ok up-and up-and up- in­to the jewel-li­ke and surp­ri­singly mild eyes of a very lar­ge, sap­phi­re-blue dra­gon.</p>
   <p>    At le­ast, he tho­ught it was a dra­gon. He co­uldn't think of anyt­hing el­se it co­uld be. It was hu­ge, sca­led, win­ged, fan­ged and ta­lo­ned. The­re we­ren't many ot­her cre­atu­res that fit that desc­rip­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    As he sta­red, he he­ard the men be­hind him re­ac­ting to the pre­sen­ce of the cre­atu­re. One was pra­ying in the an­ci­ent lan­gu­age of the hu­mans, one was cur­sing with re­mar­kab­le flu­ency, and he dis­tinctly he­ard the thud of a third drop­ping to the gro­und, pre­su­mably ha­ving fa­in­ted de­ad away.</p>
   <p>    Not that Kyrti­an bla­med him in the le­ast.</p>
   <p>    "You can cast all the il­lu­si­on-bre­aking spells you li­ke, but dra­gons can lo­ok li­ke anyt­hing they ca­re to and you won't know it. The dra­gons are sha­pe-chan­gers, you see," he he­ard the El­ven­ba­ne say, qu­ite che­er­ful­ly, but it was as if he he­ard her in the far dis­tan­ce. His mind was still too in­vol­ved with the im­pos­si­bi­lity of what he had just wit­nes­sed, and the she­er pre­sen­ce of the dra­gon it­self. "That's our big­gest sec­ret, and that gi­ves us un­de­tec­tab­le spi­es among you El­ven­lords. The dra­gons can go anyw­he­re and be anyt­hing or any­body, and you can ne­ver tell that they're the­re, be­ca­use they're not ta­king on il­lu­si­ons, they're ta­king on the re­al form of wha­te­ver they imi­ta­te. They've be­en spying on yo­ur pe­op­le-oh, fo­re­ver. From the mo­ment the El­ven­lords ar­ri­ved he­re, the El­dest say."</p>
   <p>    "Oh," Kyrti­an sa­id, fa­intly. "I sup­po­se-dra­gons must ha­ve be­en in my camp, then?"</p>
   <p>    Lashana let out a pe­al of la­ugh­ter. "My go­od Lord Kyrti­an, dra­gons we­re gu­ar­ding yo­ur tent. And ne­it­her you nor yo­ur go­od Sar­ge­ant Gel had any no­ti­on!"</p>
   <p>    "Actually," the dra­gon sa­id, with a no­te of apo­logy in his de­ep vo­ice, "I was one of them. Sorry. Ha­te to eavesd­rop and all that, but we re­al­ly didn't ha­ve much cho­ice. We had to know what you we­re, you un­ders­tand. Sud­denly you we­re do­ing all sorts of ef­fi­ci­ent things aga­inst the Yo­ung Lords, and we cal­cu­la­ted that you'd be co­ming af­ter us, next."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian wasn't en­ti­rely cer­ta­in how the dra­gon was spe­aking; the vo­ice se­emed to rumb­le up out of the depths of that mas­si­ve tor­so, and the mo­uth ope­ned and clo­sed, but the dra­gon didn't ha­ve anyt­hing li­ke lips, and he co­uldn't fi­gu­re out how it co­uld sha­pe words with that mo­uth…</p>
   <p>    "At any ra­te, this is our big­gest sec­ret, and now you know it," Las­ha­na con­ti­nu­ed. "So-well, you can see that we trust you."</p>
   <p>    "Ah… yes." Ca­re­ful­ly, very ca­re­ful­ly, Kyrti­an felt blindly for the pi­ece of log he'd be­en sit­ting on and lo­we­red him­self down on­to it. "I… can see that."</p>
   <p>    The dra­gon lo­we­red his he­ad un­til his eyes we­re le­vel with Kyrtian's fa­ce. "You can do us as much harm, kno­wing this, as we co­uld ever do to you, you know," the cre­atu­re sa­id, qu­i­etly.</p>
   <p>    "Forgive me," Kyrti­an ma­na­ged, fi­nal­ly gat­he­ring so­me of his wits abo­ut him, "If at this mo­ment-with a mo­uth big eno­ugh to swal­low me who­le not an arm's-length away from me-I find that a lit­tle dif­fi­cult to be­li­eve."</p>
   <p>    The dra­gon sud­denly re­ared up, and for a mo­ment, Kyrti­an was cer­ta­in that they we­re all go­ing to be swal­lo­wed up-</p>
   <p>    But then an enor­mo­us, rumb­ling la­ugh star­ted so­mew­he­re de­ep in­si­de the dra­gon, bub­bled up thro­ugh the long, long thro­at, and emer­ged from the up­tur­ned sno­ut as a trum­pe­ting ho­ot.</p>
   <p>    It sho­uld ha­ve ter­ri­fi­ed him-and his men-furt­her still. It was a comp­le­tely ali­en so­und, so­met­hing that co­uld ha­ve me­ant the thing was abo­ut to at­tack them. But so­me­how, it wasn't frigh­te­ning at all, so­me­how, in the depths of Kyrti­an's mind whe­re the ba­sest of ins­tincts gib­be­red in ter­ror and tri­ed to cro­uch as small as pos­sib­le so as not to be no­ti­ced by this mons­ter, it trans­la­ted as exactly what it was-the la­ugh­ter of a fel­low cre­atu­re who me­ant no harm at all. And that pri­mi­ti­ve part of him stop­ped gib­be­ring, and re­la­xed…</p>
   <p>    "Look asi­de, Lord Kyrti­an," the dra­gon sa­id, when he'd fi­nal­ly do­ne la­ug­hing. "I think I'd best co­me-back down to yo­ur le­vel."</p>
   <p>    He didn't ne­ed ur­ging, not af­ter his pre­vi­o­us ex­pe­ri­en­ce.</p>
   <p>    When Ke­man lo­oked aga­in li­ke an or­di­nary wi­zard, po­or Res­so had be­en re­vi­ved, and they we­re all se­ated aro­und the fi­re, Kyrti­an con­temp­la­ted the wi­zard-dra­gon from ac­ross the fla­mes as Las­ha­na and the fo­res­ters dis­cus­sed which of se­ve­ral pos­sib­le ca­ves they ought to pe­net­ra­te first. He co­uldn't help him­self; he co­uldn't re­con­ci­le the ap­pa­rent si­ze of the wi­zard with the ob­vi­o­us si­ze of the dra­gon he'd be­co­me. The puz­zle ate at him; he co­uldn't exp­la­in it, co­uldn't ra­ti­ona­li­ze it, and when he co­uldn't find an exp­la­na­ti­on for so­met­hing, he had the bad ha­bit (and he knew it was a bad ha­bit) of wor­rying at it to the exc­lu­si­on of everyt­hing el­se.</p>
   <p>    Finally the dra­gon him­self le­ve­led a sta­re ac­ross the fla­mes and sa­id, "What, exactly, is bot­he­ring you, Lord Kyrti­an?" in a to­ne of ir­ri­ta­ti­on mi­xed with amu­se­ment.</p>
   <p>    "Where did it co­me from?" Kyrti­an blur­ted, as con­ver­sa­ti­on ce­ased among the ot­hers. "I me­an, you're no lar­ger than Res­so right now, and you're not exactly ha­ving that log split­ting un­der you from yo­ur we­ight-but when you we­re-" he wa­ved his hands wildly "-that wasn't air, that was mass-well, lo­ok at the imp­rints you left! So whe­re did it co­me from? And whe­re did it go?"</p>
   <p>    Keman shrug­ged. "Elsew­he­re, Kyrti­an," he sa­id. "That's all I can tell you. We call it, 'shif­ting in­to the Out.' We mo­ve the re­al bulk of our­sel­ves to and from the Out, but-well, we don't know what the Out is. It's he­re, but it's so­mew­he­re el­se-"</p>
   <p>    "But when you know what to lo­ok for, a dra­gon casts a sort of-sha­dow-when he's in anot­her form," Las­ha­na put in. "It's not the kind of sha­dow you get from light fal­ling on you, but it's the­re, and when you've le­ar­ned how to see it and lo­ok for it, you can al­ways tell whet­her so­met­hing is a dra­gon or not."</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian co­uld only sha­ke his he­ad, mo­re puz­zled by the exp­la­na­ti­on than by not ha­ving one. But at le­ast that ob­ses­si­ve part of his mind had it to turn in­si­de out and exa­mi­ne whi­le he set most of his at­ten­ti­on to work on mo­re im­por­tant things. "Ne­ver mind," he sa­id, af­ter a mo­ment. "What in the na­me of the An­ces­tors are tho­se-invi­sib­le hor­rors that lie in wa­it for you on de­er tra­ils? And what can we do abo­ut them?"</p>
   <p>    Lashana and Ke­man exc­han­ged a lo­ok and a nod, and the plan­ning mo­ved in­to mo­re prac­ti­cal sphe­res.</p>
   <p>    Caellach Gwa­in was be­si­de him­self with ra­ge.</p>
   <p>    He'd fol­lo­wed Las­ha­na to this be­nigh­ted fo­rest on­ce he'd scryed out her lo­ca­ti­on and on­ce she'd aban­do­ned it, trus­ting to dis­tan­ce and pre­oc­cu­pa­ti­on to ke­ep her from no­ti­cing the "no­ise" of his ar­ri­val. Of co­ur­se, just as he ap­por­ted in­to the spot, the wretc­hed tre­es de­li­ve­red a lo­ad of wa­ter from the­ir dis­tur­bed branc­hes, cre­ating the ef­fect of a lo­ca­li­zed down­po­ur for a mo­ment or two, which was cer­ta­inly eno­ugh to drench him from he­ad to toe. Sin­ce he hadn't ta­ken the pre­ca­uti­on of we­aring a wa­terp­ro­of ca­pe, ne­ver thin­king that Las­ha­na wo­uld drop her­self in­to the mid­dle of a ra­ins­torm, he was hardly pre­pa­red for such a re­cep­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    His tem­per wasn't imp­ro­ved when he fol­lo­wed the cle­ar tra­il that she and who­ever she'd bro­ught with her had left. It led thro­ugh un­derb­rush just thick eno­ugh to be a nu­isan­ce, catc­hing in his soggy ro­bes and snar­ling his ha­ir. And it was dark, pla­gue ta­ke it all! If he hadn't kind­led a ma­ge-light, he wo­uldn't be ab­le to see whe­re he was go­ing!</p>
   <p>    Fortunately, he'd be­en on the alert for the tho­ughts of ot­hers, be­ca­use he ma­na­ged to de­tect the sent­ri­es be­fo­re they got a glimp­se of his light, and do­use it. And he was ab­le to avo­id them the sa­me way, tho­ugh his com­mand of tho­ught-sen­sing wasn't the equ­al of so­me­one who'd was­ted his ti­me ho­ning it to a fi­ne pitch. Still-he knew hu­man tho­ughts when he sen­sed them. So what was Las­ha­na up to? Had she fo­und yet anot­her gro­up of wild hu­mans to bring to the new Ci­ta­del, using up mo­re pre­ci­o­us re­so­ur­ces that sho­uld ha­ve go­ne to sup­port Wi­zards and not use­less mo­uths?</p>
   <p>    He spot­ted a fi­re, then, and be­la­tedly ca­uti­on to­ok over. He wo­uld far rat­her ha­ve scryed out what was go­ing on, but that wo­uld ha­ve re­qu­ired light-so ins­te­ad, he crept on hands and kne­es, with every bo­ne cre­aking in pro­test, un­til he was clo­se eno­ugh to see most of the fi­gu­res the­re, if not he­ar what they we­re sa­ying.</p>
   <p>    Sure eno­ugh, it lo­oked li­ke anot­her pla­gu­ey lot of me­re hu­mans!</p>
   <p>    But then, the one that had his back to Ca­el­lach tur­ned his he­ad, and Ca­el­lach fro­ze.</p>
   <p>    An El­ven­lord!</p>
   <p>    And the­re, chat­ting away with him, just as bold as co­uld be-Las­ha­na and Ke­man.</p>
   <p>    He very ne­arly rus­hed out from be­ne­ath his co­ve­ring bush and ac­cos­ted them then and the­re. As it was, she­er ra­ge held him fro­zen in pla­ce.</p>
   <p>    How da­re she! Tra­itor! Un­na­tu­ral, ung­ra­te­ful wretc­hed girl!</p>
   <p>    He wan­ted to throt­tle her, the­re and then. He wan­ted to blast her in­to a hund­red tho­usand bits. Af­ter everyt­hing she had do­ne to the Wi­zards, who had ta­ken her in, ta­ught her, shel­te­red her-</p>
   <p>    He just sat and sho­ok for a long ti­me, whi­le she, ob­li­vi­o­us, chat­te­red on as if she was old fri­ends with them all.</p>
   <p>    He didn't know how long it was that he sat, en­com­pas­sed by an­ger so hot it bur­ned away every ves­ti­ge of tho­ught. But fi­nal­ly, it eb­bed, and when it did-</p>
   <p>    Unholy glee flo­oded in, rep­la­cing the an­ger with sa­va­ge joy.</p>
   <p>    He had her now. Fi­nal­ly, fi­nal­ly, he had her! Let her try to deny this! When the ot­hers he­ard abo­ut it, they'd throw her in­to a pri­son she co­uld ne­ver es­ca­pe from!</p>
   <p>    He had to get back, tho­ugh, be­fo­re he co­uld lay any char­ges. And to do that, he had to get far eno­ugh away from he­re that the no­ise of the trans­por­ta­ti­on spell wo­uldn't be no­ti­ced.</p>
   <p>    And he mustn't get ca­ught. Not now, not when vic­tory was so clo­se he co­uld tas­te it.</p>
   <p>    He ope­ned his mind as he ne­ver had be­fo­re, pa­ying ob­ses­si­ve at­ten­ti­on to the whe­re­abo­uts of all of the sentry-sla­ves. When he mo­ved, he did so only when he knew that they we­re now­he­re ne­ar, and the so­unds of his mo­ve­ment wo­uld not re­ach them. He li­te­ral­ly felt his way along the path that had bro­ught him he­re, mo­ving lo­ose twigs out of the way so that he wo­uldn't step on them and bet­ray him­self. At le­ast now the sod­den na­tu­re of this fo­rest wor­ked for him rat­her than aga­inst him; thick moss ap­pa­rently co­ve­red every sur­fa­ce, and the fal­len le­aves he en­co­un­te­red we­re too wet to crack­le.</p>
   <p>    When he was fi­nal­ly far eno­ugh away that he felt sa­fe in do­ing so, he kind­led a ma­ge-light on­ce aga­in, got to his fe­et, and sho­ved his way along the first cle­ar path he spot­ted. He didn't par­ti­cu­larly ca­re whe­re he was go­ing-and it re­al­ly didn't mat­ter. He co­uld get back to the Ci­ta­del from prac­ti­cal­ly anyw­he­re; what re­al­ly mat­te­red now was that he get away from he­re.</p>
   <p>    The furt­her he got, the brigh­ter he ma­de his light; at first, as the light it­self frigh­te­ned noc­tur­nal ani­mals out of his path, he was af­ra­id that the dis­tur­ban­ces they ma­de wo­uld bet­ray him, or draw in so­met­hing li­ke an ali­corn that co­uld be a re­al dan­ger to him. But the furt­her away he got, the less wild­li­fe he saw, un­til at last the­re didn't se­em to be anyt­hing at all along the path but him­self.</p>
   <p>    They must ha­ve hun­ted it all out on the way he­re, he tho­ught va­gu­ely, most of his at­ten­ti­on on what he was go­ing to say when he got back to the Ci­ta­del. He re­cal­led so­me va­gue ad­monitions by the stu­pid dra­gons that one sho­uldn't hunt an area out, but ap­pa­rently that El­ven­lord pa­id as lit­tle he­ed to such things as he wo­uld ha­ve. And now that the tra­il was wi­de and be­a­uti­ful­ly cle­ar, he was go­ing to get to a po­int whe­re he co­uld trans­port him­self back in a mat­ter of mo­ments, now-just as so­on as he got past that clus­ter of bus­hes-</p>
   <p>    The vi­olent sha­king of the bus­hes was the only war­ning he got. Then he was en­gul­fed in so­met­hing hor­rid, and slimy, and his ma­ge-light went out. The­re was a mo­ment of ab­so­lu­te surp­ri­se, fol­lo­wed by an eter­nity of hel­lish pa­in, and in the end, only… not­hing­ness.</p>
   <p>    And then the­re was no so­und at all on the tra­il, ex­cept the no­ises of so­met­hing fe­eding in the dark.</p>

   <p>    Keman and Sha­na elec­ted to re­ma­in with Kyrti­an and his men, but only af­ter mo­dif­ying the­ir ap­pe­aran­ce to that of or­di­nary hu­mans. That was a pre­ca­uti­onary me­asu­re, easy to ma­in­ta­in, but vi­tal just in ca­se so­me­one ca­me lo­oking for Kyrti­an-or de­ci­ded to scry for him.</p>
   <p>    Besides, as Ke­man po­in­ted out, they'd be­en in the­se wo­ods be­fo­re. They'd hel­ped res­cue a pen full of sla­ves from Lord Chey­nar by ta­king them in­to this fo­rest, and even if they didn't exactly know every tra­il and rock, at le­ast they knew eno­ugh abo­ut the dan­gers to ke­ep Kyrti­an's pe­op­le from wal­king in­to tro­ub­le. Or rat­her, mo­re tro­ub­le. Kyrti­an had al­re­ady had one nar­row es­ca­pe from the am­bush be­asts.</p>
   <p>    And they we­re both rat­her go­od at fin­ding things, Ke­man in par­ti­cu­lar. When Kyrti­an exp­la­ined in de­ta­il what he tho­ught he was lo­oking for-the pla­ce whe­re his fat­her had go­ne hun­ting an­ci­ent ar­ti­facts, pro­bably wit­hin a ca­ve-comp­lex-and the de­ta­ils he'd gle­aned from the an­ci­ent jo­ur­nals, they both vo­lunteered the­ir ser­vi­ces. Sha­na went with Kyrti­an and his pe­op­le, to act as a lo­oko­ut for ali­corns, am­bush be­asts, and ot­her un-ple­asant­ri­es, whi­le Ke­man went off on his own.</p>
   <p>    It didn't ta­ke Ke­man very long at all to co­me ha­ring back to the ma­in party with a find in his hands and a grin on his fa­ce.</p>
   <p>    "Where did you find that?" Kyrti­an exc­la­imed, se­izing the od­dly-sha­ped chunk of me­tal that Ke­man had fo­und as if it we­re ma­de of be­gem­med gold. It had pro­bably be­en flat, on­ce, with rol­led ed­ges on two si­des. Now it was twis­ted and crump­led, li­ke a pi­ece of pa­per that had be­en wad­ded up, then smo­ot­hed out aga­in.</p>
   <p>    "Up that way-" Ke­man po­in­ted. "You know dra­gons can tell whe­re ca­ves are-"</p>
   <p>    He co­uld tell im­me­di­ately by Kyrti­an's exp­res­si­on that, no, he didn 't know that, but he con­ti­nu­ed with the exp­la­na­ti­on any­way.</p>
   <p>    "-I've just be­en cru­ising at tre­etop le­vel, pro­bing for ca­verns. I fo­und a pla­ce whe­re the­re had be­en a big ent­ran­ce that led in­to a hu­ge comp­lex, but the­re'd be­en a rock-fall that bloc­ked the ent­ran­ce, and when I lan­ded to lo­ok it over, I fo­und that this was ca­ught in the rocks." He til­ted his he­ad to the si­de with cu­ri­osity. "What is it, any­way?"</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ven't the va­gu­est clue," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, tur­ning it over in his hands with every evi­den­ce of fas­ci­na­ti­on. "But fe­el it! Fe­el how light it is? Is it any me­tal that you re­cog­ni­ze?"</p>
   <p>    "Well, no," Ke­man ad­mit­ted. The light­ness, and the lack of cor­ro­si­on, had be­en what at­trac­ted him in the first pla­ce. The dull grey bit of deb­ris, twis­ted and dis­tor­ted, had blen­ded very well in­to the fal­len rocks, and only a dra­gon wo­uld ha­ve be­en ab­le to spot it at on­ce, by the dif­fe­rent "fe­el" as­so­ci­ated with it.</p>
   <p>    "And lo­ok at this-" Kyrti­an po­in­ted to a tiny li­ne of eng­ra­ved fi­gu­res, in­ci­sed de­eply eno­ugh that not even the mist col­lec­ting on the sur­fa­ce obs­cu­red them. "You see? That's an­ci­ent script-Elven script!"</p>
   <p>    Keman pe­ered at it. "What do­es it say?" he as­ked, du­bi­o­usly. He co­uldn't be­gin to gu­ess what an El­ven­lord wo­uld cho­ose to eng­ra­ve on a pi­ece of-so­met­hing that lo­oked li­ke not­hing more than a bit of shelf, but pro­bably wasn't. It co­uld be anyt­hing. A bit of a po­em? "To­uch this who da­res? "</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian chuck­led. "It says, 'Ke­ep this ed­ge up.' Not what you ex­pec­ted, is it?" But his eyes we­re afi­re with ex­ci­te­ment. "Ke-man, this is-must be-a pi­ece of one of the ar­ti­facts from the Cros­sing! We've fo­und the Gre­at Por­tal!"</p>
   <p>    "We ha­ve?" Ke­man rep­li­ed with surp­ri­se. He sho­ok wa­ter off his ho­od with a ges­tu­re of im­pa­ti­en­ce. "I didn't know we we­re lo­oking for it. I tho­ught we we­re lo­oking for yo­ur fat­her."</p>
   <p>    "My fat­her was lo­oking for the Gre­at Por­tal, and I'm su­re he fo­und it-but so­met­hing must ha­ve hap­pe­ned and he co­uldn't get back to us." The El­ven­lord's exp­res­si­on sud­denly dar­ke­ned. Kyrti­an didn't say what he tho­ught the "so­met­hing" was, and Ke­man de­ci­ded that he wasn't go­ing to ask. "How re­cent was that rock-fall?"</p>
   <p>    "There ha­ve be­en se­ve­ral, I think." Now Ke­man was on fir­mer gro­und; if the­re was one thing that a dra­gon knew, it was rocks and ca­ves. "I ma­na­ged to get this bit out from un­der the bot­tom la­yer, but it lo­oks to me as if the­re was one lar­ge fall qu­ite so­me ti­me ago, and se­ve­ral sin­ce then. The­re's still an ope­ning big eno­ugh for a per­son to squ­e­eze in­si­de, but the ope­ning used to be-well-big eno­ugh for my mot­her, much less me! I didn't find anyt­hing li­ke-well, bo­nes," he ad­ded has­tily, re­ali­zing only then that he might well be desc­ri­bing the pla­ce whe­re Kyrti­an's fat­her had di­ed. His ad­di­ti­on didn't re­as­su­re Kyrti­an in the le­ast; Kyrti­an's exp­res­si­on dar­ke­ned furt­her.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian han­ded the ar­ti­fact to Sha­na, who exa­mi­ned it cu­ri­o­usly, but pa­id mo­re at­ten­ti­on to the El­ven­lord than to the pi­ece of me­tal. It sud­denly se­emed very qu­i­et, in the­ir lit­tle camp un­der the tre­es. Qu­i­et eno­ugh to he­ar wa­ter drip­ping everyw­he­re, to he­ar the far off calls of bell-birds. His fa­ce sha­do­wed now, all ex­ci­te­ment go­ne, the El­ven­lord sta­red off in­to the tre­es for a mo­ment. "How far is this? Can we get the­re so­on?"</p>
   <p>    "Two days, I think, over the tra­ils," Ke­man told him, af­ter a mo­ment to try and ga­uge dis­tan­ces. "I co­uld fly you the­re, one at a ti­me-"</p>
   <p>    But both Sha­na and Kyrti­an sho­ok the­ir he­ads. "I don't want to di­vi­de the party," Kyrti­an sa­id first. "And Las­ha­na, I know that you can use ma­gic to bring us the­re, but-"</p>
   <p>    "But I'll fall on my no­se af­ter­wards," Sha­na sa­id bluntly. "And if you ne­ed me, I won't be ab­le to do anyt­hing. No, over­land it is." She sig­hed, then smi­led, and tri­ed to ma­ke light of the si­tu­ati­on. "Ah well. I ha­ven't got­ten ne­arly eno­ugh hard exer­ci­se la­tely, and you do ha­ve hor­ses to help. Ke­man and I will be the only ones who ha­ve to walk-"</p>
   <p>    Keman burst in­to la­ugh­ter, as she hit her he­ad with the he­el of her palm.</p>
   <p>    "I don't think you'll be wal­king, Sha­na," Ke­man told her. "If you'll just gi­ve me a chan­ce to 'chan­ge' in­to so­met­hing mo­re su­itab­le-"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian got the hint im­me­di­ately. It was only a mo­ment of work-as Kyrti­an has­tily aver­ted his eyes-and an "extra" hor­se sta­red at Sha­na moc­kingly.</p>
   <p>    "What co­lor wo­uld you li­ke, fos­ter-sis­ter?" he as­ked sha­ping the mo­uth and larynx a bit off the hor­se-form, so he co­uld talk pro­perly. "Ro­an? Bay? Black?" With each sug­ges­ti­on, he chan­ged his co­lor to match. "How abo­ut a ni­ce bucks­kin? Or spots? Stri­pes? Checks?" The chan­ges flas­hed ac­ross his hi­de in be­wil­de­ring suc­ces­si­on.</p>
   <p>    "Ew!" Sha­na wrink­led her no­se at the last. "Brown. Ple­ase. Brown will do very ni­cely."</p>
   <p>    "Not even ali­corn-whi­te with pretty blue eyes?" he te­ased, fa­ding out the checks in­to a uni­form brown. And, for go­od me­asu­re, ma­king the ha­ir much bet­ter at shed­ding wa­ter. By this po­int he had conc­lu­ded that he sho­uld ha­ve ta­ken to the gu­ise of a hor­se a lot so­oner-no ne­ed for ra­in-ca­pes and, in fact, the ra­in felt rat­her go­od! It cer­ta­inly kept the bi­ting fli­es away.</p>
   <p>    Their exc­han­ge had ligh­te­ned Kyrti­an's mo­od a lit­tle, but it was very cle­ar as he ga­ve his men the­ir new or­ders to mo­ve out that he was ten­se. Ke­man didn't ha­ve to ask why; it had be­en cle­ar when he'd told them of his mis­sing fat­her that he didn't ex­pect to find his pa­rent ali­ve. Af­ter the ini­ti­al burst of ex­ci­te­ment fa­ded, how co­uld you pos­sibly lo­ok for­ward to fin­ding a body-or what was left of one?</p>
   <p>    He hur­ri­ed them all in­to pac­king up the camp; it was in­teresting to Ke­man that even un­der the press of ur­gency, Kyrti­an's pe­op­le wor­ked ef­fi­ci­ently and wit­ho­ut fumb­ling. In far less ti­me than Ke­man wo­uld ha­ve tho­ught pos­sib­le gi­ven his ex­pe­ri­en­ce even with the Iron Pe­op­le, everyt­hing was pac­ked pro­perly, sto­wed on the hor­ses, and they we­re re­ady to le­ave.</p>
   <p>    The ot­hers lo­oked to Kyrti­an for or­ders; he ges­tu­red to Ke­man, who ob­vi­o­usly was the only one who knew whe­re they we­re go­ing, and Ke­man and Sha­na to­ok the le­ad. Kyrti­an ro­de be­hind them, and ever­yo­ne in his party ga­ve him a res­pect­ful dis­tan­ce. With a stony exp­res­si­on, and his mo­uth set in a grim li­ne, it was pretty cle­ar that he didn't want to talk to an­yo­ne, and it se­emed best to le­ave him alo­ne.</p>
   <p>    It was a very, very qu­i­et ri­de. No­ne of the men wan­ted to bre­ak the si­len­ce, and even Sha­na didn't talk. The ra­in star­ted up aga­in shortly af­ter they to­ok to the tra­il, obs­cu­ring the dis­tan­ce be­hind a ve­il of grey, but Ke­man wasn't wor­ri­ed. Dra­gons co­uldn't get lost; he knew whe­re he was, exactly in re­la­ti­ons­hip to whe­re the­ir go­al was. The only thing stan­ding bet­we­en them and that rock-co­ve­red ca­ve ent­ran­ce was the trif­ling mat­ter of se­ve­ral le­agu­es.</p>
   <p>    It wo­uld ha­ve be­en funny, if it hadn't be­en so im­por­tant that Tri­ana ke­ep the pre­sen­ce of her party sec­ret, not only from Ael-mar­kin, but from Kyrti­an as well. As it was, when ever­yo­ne el­se sud­denly pac­ked up for no ap­pa­rent re­ason and be­gan to mo­ve, Tri­ana's gro­up had to scramb­le to cle­an out the­ir camp and mo­ve de­eper in­to the fo­rest.</p>
   <p>    It was a ne­ar thing. Kyrti­an's party didn't ri­de in on top of whe­re Tri­ana's camp had be­en, but they ca­me clo­ser than Tri­ana li­ked, and Ael­mar­kin's bunch did just blun­der on thro­ugh. If his fo­res­ters had be­en half as go­od as Tri­ana's sla­ves, they'd ha­ve spot­ted the signs of re­cent oc­cu­pa­ti­on for cer­ta­in.</p>
   <p>    But af­ter that, it was a simp­le eno­ugh mat­ter to tra­il be­hind Ael­mar­kin. He was le­aving a tra­il as bro­ad as a high­way and ma­king no ef­fort to hi­de it-but in­te­res­tingly eno­ugh, Kyrti­an wasn't go­ing to any ef­fort to con­ce­al his tra­il eit­her.</p>
   <p>    He must ha­ve fo­und so­met­hing. That was the only pos­sib­le exp­la­na­ti­on. Tri­ana wis­hed she knew what it was.</p>
   <p>    Only when they pus­hed on past dark was she cer­ta­in that it co­uldn't be Wi­zards-be­ca­use Kyrti­an kind­led ma­ge-lights and sent them up abo­ve the­ir he­ads to il­lu­mi­na­te the tra­il. Her own sco­uts re­por­ted it-and when her gro­up was on the top of a hill, she co­uld of­ten catch a glimp­se of the lights flit­ting among the branc­hes of a val­ley be­low, li­ke im­pos­sibly hu­ge fi­ref­li­es in the dis­tan­ce.</p>
   <p>    He wo­uldn't ha­ve bet­ra­yed his pre­sen­ce this way if he tho­ught he'd fo­und signs of the Wi­zards he was sup­po­sed to be lo­oking for. At le­ast, she didn't think he wo­uld.</p>
   <p>    The tro­ub­le was, he co­uld use lights, but ne­it­her she nor Ael-mar­kin da­red.</p>
   <p>    That had her grit­ting her te­eth in frust­ra­ti­on, un­til it oc­cur­red to her that the­re was one thing, at le­ast, that she co­uld do. She co­uld ma­ke ma­ge-lights of a dif­fe­rent sort. Not po­wer­ful eno­ugh to light the­ir path, but tiny things that wo­uld mark whe­re Kyrti­an's hor­ses, and Ael­mar­kin's, had go­ne by fol­lo­wing the scent in the air. If the ot­hers saw them, they'd eit­her as­su­me they we­re or­di­nary fi­ref­li­es or we­re so­me bi­zar­re cre­atu­re na­ti­ve to the­se fo­rests.</p>
   <p>    It to­ok her the bet­ter part of an ho­ur to get the ma­gic right, but in the end it was worth it; the trick was to set the spell to se­ek "hor­se," but with the spe­ci­fic exc­lu­si­ons of the hor­ses she and her gro­up ro­de-other­wi­se, all the lit­tle mo­tes did was clus­ter aro­und her. So even if they we­re stumb­ling down the path in the dark­ness now, they had so­met­hing to fol­low. What a mi­se­rab­le ex­pe­ri­en­ce, tho­ugh-wet, cold, the end­less miz­zle in the fa­ce, and it se­emed as if the­re we­re en­ti­re tre­es just wa­iting un­til they pas­sed be­ne­ath to drop a lo­ad of wa­ter on the­ir he­ads. They didn't ha­ve to worry abo­ut mo­ving qu­i­etly, tho­ugh-the­re we­re so many frogs cal­ling in a do­zen dif­fe­rent to­nes thro­ug­ho­ut the wo­ods that they co­uld ha­ve blun­de­red abo­ut thras­hing thro­ugh the bus­hes and ne­ver be­en he­ard.</p>
   <p>    Presumably Ael­mar­kin ca­me up with so­met­hing that wor­ked equ­al­ly well, sin­ce they didn't run right in­to the back of his gro­up. Tri­ana was dre­ad­ful­ly af­ra­id for so­me ti­me that Kyrti­an was go­ing to ri­de all night, for he sho­wed no signs of wan­ting to halt. The ra­in po­ured on past dusk, and only slac­ke­ned to the usu­al mist long af­ter dark, but still Kyrti­an ro­ad on.</p>
   <p>    By this ti­me she was con­vin­ced that Kyrti­an had go­ne qu­ite mad, but her best fo­res­ter as­su­red her that no, not even so­me­one as dri­ven as Kyrti­an was go­ing to be fo­olish eno­ugh to press him­self and his men that hard. And the sla­ve was pro­ved right; af­ter what se­emed li­ke half the night, her fo­re­most sco­ut ca­me back with the in­tel­li­gen­ce that both Kyrti­an and Ael-mar­kin we­re set­tling in for the night, and with the pro­fo­un­dest re­li­ef, Tri­ana di­rec­ted her own men to do the sa­me.</p>
   <p>    But the mo­ment that the first thin light sho­wed among the tre­es, the sco­uts who watc­hed the camps ca­me back and ro­used them, and they we­re out of bed­rol­ls that had just got­ten com­for­tab­le and off aga­in in­to the fog of pre-dawn. Kyrti­an was pus­hing hard, and Tri­ana ne­eded to ma­ke a de­ci­si­on. She cal­led her best man to ri­de along­si­de her.</p>
   <p>    "Can we outf­lank my co­usin-get ahe­ad of him wit­ho­ut him re­ali­zing that we're out he­re?" she as­ked. Not for the first ti­me, she was glad she had bo­ught the­se men from Lord Kyndreth. Who­ever had tra­ined them had do­ne such a go­od job that she didn't ha­ve to gi­ve them exact inst­ruc­ti­ons-she had only to ask for what she wan­ted do­ne, and they wor­ked out a way to ac­comp­lish it if they had the skills. Un­for­tu­na­tely the­re was one thing that they did not ha­ve the skills for. They we­ren't very go­od co­oks. They didn't se­em to mind eating squ­ir­rel and ha­re that was half raw and half bur­ned, but she had be­gun eating the le­at­hery jo­ur­ney-bre­ad in pre­fe­ren­ce to the ga­me they pro­vi­ded.</p>
   <p>    The sla­ve pon­de­red her qu­es­ti­on, then nod­ded. "I be­li­eve so, my lady, but-" he lo­oked une­asy, and wi­ped a film of mo­is­tu­re from his fo­re­he­ad that wasn't from the mist. "-it isn't the fo­rest that's the prob­lem. It's what's in the fo­rest. We know of al-icorn herds at the very le­ast, and the out­ri­ders ha­ve se­en signs of ot­her things. Wor­se things, my Lady, than ali­corn stal­li­ons."</p>
   <p>    "Worse things?" She wrink­led her brow. "What sorts of signs?"</p>
   <p>    "One of them ca­me ac­ross signs that so­met­hing had kil­led and eaten se­ve­ral ali­corns in the past we­ek or so." He gri­ma­ced. "I wo­uld not ca­re to en­co­un­ter anyt­hing that co­uld do that."</p>
   <p>    "And I sup­po­se he didn't see it? Had no clue as to what it was?" If she knew what they ne­eded to gu­ard aga­inst, she co­uld per­form so­me spe­ci­fic ma­gics-ma­gic that wo­uld eit­her re­pul­se the cre­atu­res or at le­ast gi­ve war­ning of the­ir pre­sen­ce. But wit­ho­ut kno­wing what it was she was trying to ward off- she co­uld was­te her energy and skill sho­o­ing away spi­ders, only to ha­ve a gi­ant slug des­cend on them.</p>
   <p>    "Nothing we've ever se­en or he­ard of, my lady-the sco­ut didn't get ne­ar; he sa­id the pla­ce lo­oked li­ke an am­bush in the ma­king. From what he told me, the ali­corns we­re torn in pi­eces, and I wo­uldn't even ex­pect one of tho­se dra­gons we've he­ard abo­ut to do that." She ga­ve him a sus­pi­ci­o­us glan­ce, but he didn't lo­ok as if he was exag­ge­ra­ting.</p>
   <p>    Well, that did fit in with what she'd be­en war­ned abo­ut this pla­ce. Kyndreth him­self had be­en no­ne-too-eager to go lo­oking for pur­por­ted Wi­zards in the­se hills, and had jum­ped to ac­cept Kyrti­an's of­fer to track them down. She'd pro­bably lo­se so­me men in this. Now she was glad she'd bo­ught them out­right from Kyndreth ins­te­ad of bor­ro­wing them. When an ac­ci­dent hap­pe­ned to a bor­ro­wed sla­ve, it was ama­zing how the va­lue of that sla­ve sud­denly inc­re­ased…</p>
   <p>    "Do it," she or­de­red him. "Send the out­ri­ders ahe­ad, find us a cle­ar path so we can get aro­und Ael­mar­kin and run along­si­de Kyrti­an. You're sup­po­sed to be Lord Kyndreth's best, aren't you?"</p>
   <p>    He bo­wed. "Yes, my lady," he sa­id. No he­si­ta­ti­on, no ex­cu­ses, no obj­ec­ti­ons. Just obe­di­en­ce. Exactly what she had pa­id for.</p>
   <p>    Well, not all that she had pa­id for. She'd al­so in­ves­ted in ex­cel­len­ce; so far, the­se sla­ves had be­en most sa­tis­fac­tory, but now they had bet­ter well pro­ve that they co­uld go be­yond "sa­tis­fac­tory."</p>
   <p>    Or when she got back, she'd be ha­ving so­me words with Lord Kyndreth.</p>
   <p>    But right now, she had bet­ter ke­ep her own mind on the job at hand. If the­se sla­ves co­uldn't ri­se to the chal­len­ge, she might have to aban­don them to the­ir fa­te and nar­row her go­al to get­ting her own self out in­tact.</p>
   <p>    They'd just pa­used long eno­ugh to pass aro­und ra­ti­ons for lunch, eating in the sad­dle, be­fo­re the af­ter­no­on down­po­ur ar­ri­ved on sche­du­le. By night­fall, they sho­uld be at Ke­man's ca­ve-comp­lex. As ra­in drum­med on the ho­od of her ca­pe and a few cold drops slip­ped aro­und the col­lar and got down her neck, Sha­na was gra­te­ful that her "mo­unt" was Ke­man, and not a re­al hor­se. She co­uldn't ha­ve fal­len off if she'd wan­ted to, not even on the ste­ep tra­ils he was ta­king, and at the mo­ment, she ne­eded to be ab­le to con­cent­ra­te on hol­ding the men­tal li­ne of com­mu­ni­ca­ti­on with Lorryn as tightly as pos­sib­le. The­re was a lot of dis­tan­ce bet­we­en them-and so­met­hing unex­pec­ted had hap­pe­ned, so­met­hing that ma­de all the dis­com­fort she felt comp­le­tely ir­re­le­vant.</p>
   <p>    Caellach Gwa­in had va­nis­hed from the Ci­ta­del.</p>
   <p>    :… so when he didn 't turn up for bre­ak­fast, eit­her, Ha­la tho­ught it was mo­re than odd,: Lorryn told her.:He's pul­led sulks be­fo­re, usu­al­ly when he's ma­na­ged to squ­ir­rel away fo­od in his ro­om, but mis­sing three me­als in a row was ex­cep­ti­onal. The do­or was bol­ted from the in­si­de; it wasn't hard to get it open, not with a half do­zen Wi­zards wor­king on it-but he wasn 't the­re when we ope­ned it.:</p>
   <p>    Caellach Gwa­in go­ne! It was so temp­ting to al­low her­self to wal­low in she­er re­li­ef, but-Ca­el­lach Gwa­in va­nis­hed out of his own ro­om was a puz­zle that only pro­mi­sed mo­re tro­ub­le.</p>
   <p>    She wi­ped ra­in from her fa­ce and clo­sed her eyes, con­cent­ra­ting.:You don't sup­po­se he's le­ar­ned the trans­por­ta­ti­on ma­gic, do you?: she as­ked, ap­pre­hen­si­vely.</p>
   <p>    -.That's exactly what I'm af­ra­id has hap­pe­ned,: was the grim reply.</p>
   <p>    Well, that ma­de per­fect sen­se. You didn't ha­ve to at­tend les­sons to get the ad­van­ta­ge of them. The mi­se­rab­le old to­ad co­uld simply ha­ve sat in his ro­om with a scrying glass and le­ar­ned everyt­hing any of the ot­her Old Whi­ners was le­ar­ning.</p>
   <p>    :You've got a go­od re­ason, I'll bet.:</p>
   <p>    She felt Lorryn's nod.:His ro­om was full of things from the old Ci­ta­del-a go­od many of them not his pro­perty, so many of the Old Ones tell me. By the way, that's put him be­yond the pa­le, if that's any com­fort to you. Even the Old Whi­ners who we­re his most vo­cal sup­por­ters we­re wild with ra­ge when they fo­und the­ir pro­perty in his ro­om. The­re's no way he co­uld ha­ve known whe­re so­me of tho­se things we­re wit­ho­ut go­ing back in per­son, be­ca­use the­re we­re a lot of small, va­lu­ab­le trin­kets that we­re hid­den away in dra­wers and chests he 'd ne­ver se­en the in­si­de of: Her he­art sank.:So he co­uld be anyw­he­re.: If he knew the trans­por­ta­ti­on spell, all he had to do was be fa­mi­li­ar with a pla­ce to go the­re. She sup­po­sed it was even pos­sib­le to be­co­me that fa­mi­li­ar using simp­le scrying.</p>
   <p>    :The old Ci­ta­del, so­me new hi­de­away of his own, even out spying on you,: Lorryn rep­li­ed, and the­re was ap­pre­hen­si­on in his tho­ughts.:You know what wo­uld hap­pen if pe­op­le fo­und out whe­re you are right now, what you we­re do­ing, and who you we­re do­ing it with.:</p>
   <p>    Never mind that Lady Moth was cle­arly the Wi­zards' fri­end, that Lorryn's own mot­her and sis­ter we­re ful­lblo­ods. This was dif­fe­rent. This was con­sor­ting with the Gre­at Lords' cho­sen ge­ne­ral. She co­uld try to exp­la­in un­til her fa­ce was blue, but if Ca­el­lach Gwa­in bro­ke the news at an inop­por­tu­ne ti­me, well-:That's my worst fe­ar, be­ca­use the­re are so­me of the yo­ungs­ters who think that the­re was a se­cond burst of trans­por­ta­ti­on no­ise right af­ter you and Ke­man left.: She sen­sed Lorryn's worry, and she mo­re than ag­re­ed with it.</p>
   <p>    :Fire and Ra­in!: she swo­re ang­rily.:That wo­uld be just li­ke him, wo­uldn 't it!: Even thro­ugh her an­ger, she tri­ed to think if she'd de­tec­ted anyt­hing sin­ce she'd ar­ri­ved.:He might be he­re. He might not. If he ca­me in far eno­ugh from us, I wo­uldn't ha­ve he­ard the ar­ri­val.:</p>
   <p>    :Look, I'm go­ing to do two things, and the first is that I'm go­ing to turn his ro­om in­to an iron ca­ge,: Lorryn told her.:And when he tri­es to trans­port back in-he'll get a shock. Zed tri­ed it with a rock, and what hap­pens is that you bo­un­ce back to whe­re you ca­me from.:</p>
   <p>    :With a de­mon of a he­adac­he, I can only ho­pe,: she sa­id so­urly.:He'll try to go to anot­her part of the Ci­ta­del, of co­ur­se-:</p>
   <p>    -.Maybe, may­be not. Be­ca­use the next thing I'm go­ing to do is start plan­ting iron wed­ges all over the Ci­ta­del ex­cept in de­sig­na­ted 'ma­gic ro­oms,' and tho­se will be brand new ones that Fat­her Dra­gon is go­ing to car­ve out for us.: He so­un­ded-well, rat­her ple­ased with him­self for co­ming up with a plan so qu­ickly, and she didn't bla­me him.</p>
   <p>    :Zed can po­ur simp­le wed­ges for us easily eno­ugh, can't he?: she as­ked.</p>
   <p>    :With no prob­lem at all; he's al­re­ady po­uring them, the child­ren are plan­ting them, and Fat­her Dra­gon has the first ma­gic ro­om car­ved out. I've be­en wan­ting to do this for a whi­le, any­way. It's one mo­re de­fen­se aga­inst the El­ven­lords, even if it is a nu­isan­ce for us to con­fi­ne do­ing ma­gic to tho­se spe­ci­al ro­oms.: He sig­hed.:Still, it'll be worth it, and we can ha­ve the who­le Ci­ta­del pro­tec­ted by to­mor­row. Ca­el­lach Gwa­in will ha­ve no way of kno­wing whe­re the sa­fe ro­oms to trans­port to are or what they lo­ok li­ke. So to get back he­re, he 'II ha­ve to ap­port to so­mew­he­re he knows.:</p>
   <p>    Her an­ger fa­ded as she con­si­de­red that..7 don't think he's set fo­ot out­si­de the ca­ves mo­re than a do­zen ti­mes sin­ce we ar­ri­ved. The­re can't be that many pla­ces whe­re he can ap­port back.:</p>
   <p>    -.And I can ha­ve all of them watc­hed by pe­op­le we trust. That le­aves only the old Ci­ta­del for him.: Lorryn so­un­ded ab­so­lu­tely smug when he sa­id that, and she didn't bla­me him.</p>
   <p>    :He can go li­ve the­re and rot for all I ca­re,: she sa­id ma­li­ci­o­usly. May­be the Gre­at Lords will de­ci­de that our fic­ti­ti­o­us Wi­zards li­ve the­re. That wo­uld ser­ve him right, if they find him sit­ting the­re li­ke an old to­ad in a ho­le.:</p>
   <p>    .-Well, just ke­ep alert for any sign of him, lo­ve,: Lorryn ca­uti­oned.:He's a twisty old be­ast. I'm not su­re I can think of every way he co­uld think of to ca­use us harm.:</p>
   <p>    .7 will,: she pro­mi­sed, and ga­ve him a word­less, lo­ving fa­re­well that she ho­ped re­ma­ined un­ta­in­ted with her an­ger at Ca­el­lach Gwa­in.</p>
   <p>    "Well, that's not go­od," Ke­man mut­te­red up at her, sha­king the ra­in from his ma­ne. He had, of co­ur­se, be­en lis­te­ning in.</p>
   <p>    "No, it's not. Sho­uld we tell Kyrti­an?" She was of two minds on the su­bj­ect. It wasn't as if Kyrti­an didn't al­re­ady ha­ve eno­ugh on his hands-and it wasn't as if his men we­ren't per­fectly ca­pab­le of catc­hing one old man who was anyt­hing but wo­ods-wi­se if he was spying on them.</p>
   <p>    Unless, of co­ur­se, he was using the trans­por­ta­ti­on spell to get him away each ti­me it lo­oked as if he was go­ing to get ca­ught.</p>
   <p>    But she hadn't he­ard the dis­tinc­ti­ve "no­ise" as­so­ci­ated with that spell!</p>
   <p>    "I wo­uldn't," Ke­man rep­li­ed af­ter a mo­ment. "It's not his bu­si­ness. It's wi­zard bu­si­ness. Let Lorryn ta­ke ca­re of things at the Ci­ta­del; you and I will just ha­ve to be very vi­gi­lant from now on."</p>
   <p>    "I ho­pe an am­bush be­ast gets him," she grumb­led.</p>
   <p>    Keman sho­ok his he­ad. "I wo­uldn't wish that fa­te even on Ca­el­lach Gwa­in. And you sho­uldn't, eit­her."</p>
   <p>    "Well-maybe not an am­bush be­ast. But I wo­uldn't mind se­e­ing him tre­ed by an ali­corn," she re­len­ted.</p>
   <p>    "Nor wo­uld I, fos­ter sis­ter," Ke­man rep­li­ed. "May­be we'll ha­ve the pri­vi­le­ge. And may­be he'll just get in­to tro­ub­le he can't get out of, all on his own, wit­ho­ut our ill-wis­hing him. That wo­uld be best of all."</p>
   <p>    "I sup­po­se it wo­uld," she sig­hed, and left it at that.</p>

   <p>    Dusk-and Sha­na lo­oked up thro­ugh the glo­om and the driz­zle at the mo­un­ta­in of rub­ble mar­king the si­te that Ke­man swo­re hid a ma­j­or ca­ve-comp­lex.</p>
   <p>    Well, if it did, the ori­gi­nal ca­ve-mo­uth must ha­ve be­en big­ger than anyt­hing Sha­na had ever ima­gi­ned, much less se­en. It lo­oked from this pers­pec­ti­ve as if half the si­de of the mo­un­ta­in had co­me down over the ye­ars, and it wasn't a small mo­un­ta­in. Ste­ep, tho­ugh; very ste­ep, co­ve­red with tre­es and brush that clung to the slo­pe with ve­ge­ta­ti­ve stub­born­ness, and pro­bably kept the rest of the mo­un­ta­in from lo­sing its outer skin.</p>
   <p>    The most re­cent fall had be­en qu­ite re­cent in­de­ed, and had ad­ded bulk to the pi­le on the left-hand si­de. The­re we­re tre­es, lar­ge tre­es, crus­hed un­der all that rock, with the re­ma­ins of de­ad le­aves still clin­ging to the branc­hes.</p>
   <p>    Mage-lights ho­ve­red over the pi­le as Kyrti­an's men lo­oked on ap­pre­hen­si­vely. Ke­man-back to hu­man-form-and Kyrt-ian clim­bed the rock-pi­le to the sing­le ope­ning that Ke­man had dis­co­ve­red ne­ar the top of the mo­und.</p>
   <p>    "Is he go­ing to be sa­fe?" one of the men as­ked du­bi­o­usly, as Ke­man of­fe­red Kyrti­an a hand-up over a tricky bit. Sha­na was de­ad-cer­ta­in that he wasn't wor­ri­ed abo­ut Ke­man.</p>
   <p>    "Keman's a dra­gon," she re­min­ded him. "They don't know rock, they li­ve rock. Ke­man fe­els whe­re each peb­ble is rub­bing and might be lo­ose. He'll know if so­met­hing is go­ing to slip be­fo­re the rock knows."</p>
   <p>    "You'd bet­ter be right," Lynder mut­te­red darkly. "I climb-I exp­lo­re ca­ves all the ti­me-and I wo­uldn't go up the­re wit­ho­ut spen­ding we­eks chec­king my path."</p>
   <p>    "You're not a dra­gon," she re­tor­ted, and tur­ned her own attention to the ba­se of the pi­le. The­re, in a pla­ce whe­re rock had be­en mel­ted and re­for­med to sta­bi­li­ze the area (the in­dis­pu­tab­le mark of dra­gon sto­ne-sha­ping), was whe­re Ke­man had fo­und the stran­ge pi­ece of me­tal. Sha­na exa­mi­ned the spot on her hands and kne­es with her own lit­tle ma­ge-light, and in a few mo­ments, the­re was no do­ubt in her mind that what he had fo­und was not a ran­dom bit of so­met­hing that might ha­ve be­en drop­ped by a cu­ri­o­us El­ven­lord long ago. The­re was mo­re of the stuff un­der that ori­gi­nal rock-fall. As she bro­ught her pin­po­int light in clo­se to the gro­und, she saw a thin ed­ge of so­met­hing squ­as­hed along the bo­un­dary of rock-pi­le and dirt that didn't lo­ok anyt­hing li­ke the frac­tu­red ed­ge of a rock. What it did lo­ok li­ke was anot­her she­et of me­tal.</p>
   <p>    Just what was un­der that pi­le of rock?</p>
   <p>    Just what is in­si­de this ca­ve? That's what I sho­uld be as­king…</p>
   <p>    She lo­oked back up aga­in. At that mo­ment, Ke­man tur­ned and wa­ved back down at her. They must ha­ve fo­und the ent­ran­ce. A ma­ge-light left the for­ma­ti­on and swung pur­po­se­ful­ly to­wards the two fi­gu­res up on the pi­le, then va­nis­hed, se­emingly in­to the rocks. The­re was so­me ac­ti­vity up the­re, as the two bent over so­met­hing. A mo­ment la­ter, the first fi­gu­re fol­lo­wed the light in­to the tumb­led rocks. Ke­man re­ma­ined bent over whi­le Kyrti­an's men fid­ge­ted rest­les­sly, then even­tu­al­ly star­ted back down the pi­le. Cle­arly Kyrti­an had go­ne down in­si­de the ca­ve by ro­pe, and Ke­man had re­ma­ined just long eno­ugh to see that he was sa­fely down.</p>
   <p>    "Now what's Kyrti­an thin­king?" the man be­si­de Sha­na mur­mu­red, fret­ful­ly. "We ought to be ma­king camp, not clim­bing aro­und in ca­ves."</p>
   <p>    "Kyrtian's pro­bably se­e­ing if we can camp in the ca­ve," one of his fel­lows po­in­ted out. "It wo­uld be a lot dri­er, and we wo­uldn't ha­ve to worry abo­ut-Things."</p>
   <p>    "Unless, of co­ur­se, tho­se Things ha­ve be­en co­ming out of the ca­ve," Sha­na war­ned, darkly. The mo­re Kyrti­an had exp­la­ined what he ho­ped to find, the less she'd li­ked the idea of craw­ling aro­und in the­re. So far, every sign had po­in­ted to the conc­lu­si­on that Kyrti­an was right, and this was the si­te of his ra­ce's entry into this world. What if that Gre­at Por­tal hadn't qu­ite be­en clo­sed-or had be­en re­ope­ned? From what Lorryn had told her, Eve­lon was hel­lish at best; the­re was no tel­ling what kind of hor­rors li­ved back the­re. The am­bush be­asts and the ot­her we­ird things in this fo­rest co­uld be co­ming out of Eve­lon-or be­en sent by the El­ven­lords' ene­mi­es, the ones they had fled he­re to es­ca­pe.</p>
   <p>    Fire and Ra­in! If they we­re the lo­sers in the­ir fight, I don't want to me­et what the El­ven­lords we know tho­ught was so bad they wo­uld risk run­ning in­to an unk­nown world rat­her than fa­ce it or sur­ren­der to it.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian's men didn't lo­ok very happy with her ob­ser­va­ti­on, so she didn't sha­re any mo­re of her tho­ughts. Fo­re­war­ned was fo­re­ar­med, but no po­int in ma­king them too ner­vo­us.</p>
   <p>    Keman ca­me down the sli­de a gre­at de­al fas­ter than he had go­ne up; mo­re su­re-fo­oted than any go­at, sin­ce he ne­edn't tro­ub­le him­self abo­ut the sta­bi­lity of the sur­fa­ce he trod on. He lo­oked as gle­eful as only a dra­gon co­uld, with the pros­pect of a new set of ca­ves to exp­lo­re. "The outer­most ca­vern has a lot of things in it, but they all lo­ok li­ke per­so­nal be­lon­gings that pe­op­le drop­ped whi­le they we­re run­ning away. Kyrti­an wants to camp in the­re," he told them, as he le­apt down from the last bo­ul­der. "Right now, we ne­ed so­me ro­pes to get down in­si­de."</p>
   <p>    "And just how are we go­ing to get the hor­ses up that mess?" one of the men de­man­ded. "They won't go, and I don't bla­me them."</p>
   <p>    "Oh." Ke­man cle­arly hadn't tho­ught of that, and ob­vi­o­usly, ne­it­her had Kyrti­an. "I co­uld sta­bi­li­ze it, but that wo­uld ta­ke ti­me-"</p>
   <p>    "And then what are you go­ing to do? Lo­wer them on a ro­pe? Ho­bie and Lynder can go with my lord, and the rest of us will stay out he­re," the man rep­li­ed firmly. "They're the ones that go muc­king abo­ut in ho­les, not us. You just put so­me of tho­se ma­gics on our camp to ke­ep the hor­rors away, and we'll be fi­ne wa­iting in the open."</p>
   <p>    Keman lo­oked at Sha­na, who just shrug­ged. The­se we­ren't her men to com­mand. "Go see what Lord Kyrti­an has to say abo­ut that," was her only ad­vi­ce.</p>
   <p>    So back up the pi­le went Ke­man, and back down aga­in, just as qu­ickly. "He says it's all right, but camp away from the rock-fall area," he cal­led as he le­apt from rock to rock. "So we ne­ed to sco­ut a se­cu­re area-Ho­bie and Lynder, tho­ugh, he wants you to bring up the clim­bing ge­ar he as­ked for."</p>
   <p>    "What abo­ut the cam­ping stuff?" Lynder as­ked im­me­di­ately. "How are we go­ing to get that down?"</p>
   <p>    Keman just la­ug­hed.</p>
   <p>    "Leave that to Sha­na and me," he sa­id; so the two men Kyrti­an cal­led for gat­he­red up a pack api­ece, and se­ve­ral co­ils of ro­pe, and be­gan the climb whi­le Sha­na and Ke­man and the rest went to lo­ok for a go­od pla­ce for the ot­hers to set up.</p>
   <p>    They fo­und it so­on eno­ugh, an in­den­ta­ti­on in the si­de of the hill, too small to be cal­led a val­ley, too lar­ge for a ra­vi­ne. Mo­re of a poc­ket in the hil­lsi­de that Sha­na co­uld fen­ce off with ma­gic for them to ke­ep the hor­ses con­fi­ned and scre­en the camp from vi­ew.</p>
   <p>    That was easy eno­ugh for her to do; an il­lu­si­on of so­lid hil­lsi­de and ve­ge­ta­ti­on, la­ye­red on­to a bar­ri­er that wo­uld only let pe­op­le pass. She kept the ma­ge-lights go­ing whi­le they set up camp, then on­ce they had a fi­re and the­ir own lan­terns go­ing, dis­mis­sed all but one of her lights. Then she and Ke­man col­lec­ted all of the ge­ar they we­re go­ing to ne­ed in­si­de the ca­ve. He had ta­ken the form of so­met­hing rat­her grel-li­ke, with a bro­ad, flat back to carry a gre­at many packs, and fo­ur strong, lim­ber legs en­ding in claws.</p>
   <p>    It was a very go­od thing that he had ta­ken all the ge­ar, be­ca­use Sha­na had a hard eno­ugh ti­me get­ting her­self up that slo­pe. It was as much of a scramb­le as a climb, tes­ting each fo­ot­hold only to find her fe­et skid­ding as lo­ose scree dis­lod­ged, grab­bing des­pe­ra­tely for a hand­hold un­til she co­uld get her fe­et firmly plan­ted aga­in. For­tu­na­tely, on­ce they re­ac­hed the top, Ho­bie and Lynder we­re wa­iting with ro­pes set up to bring down everyt­hing a bit at a ti­me. Ke­man him­self car­ri­ed Sha­na, pick-a-back, with her arms wrap­ped aro­und his neck, legs wed­ged under the musc­les whe­re wings met sho­ul­der. He was in his own sha­pe, of co­ur­se, clim­bing down with the agi­lity of a fly on a wall, dis­da­ining the use of ro­pe. She kept her eyes shut; if anyt­hing, it was a lot fart­her to the flo­or of the ca­ve than it had be­en to the gro­und out­si­de, and the rock-fall had pi­led up in­to a much nas­ti­er bar­ri­er on this si­de.</p>
   <p>    Once they we­re down on firm so­il, tho­ugh, she ope­ned her eyes to ta­ke her first lo­ok aro­und.</p>
   <p>    Mage-lights up ne­ar the va­ul­ted top of the ca­ve im­par­ted a soft glow that was as go­od as day­light. The­re was rub­bish everyw­he­re, abo­ut half of it be­ing wo­od, le­aves, branc­hes, and ot­her det­ri­tus that had blown in or was­hed in be­fo­re the ca­ve was so to­tal­ly se­aled up. But the ot­her half of the lit­ter wasn't. It lo­oked, just as Ke­man's bri­ef desc­rip­ti­on had sug­ges­ted, as if a gre­at many pe­op­le had co­me thro­ugh he­re la­den down with per­so­nal be­lon­gings, and for one re­ason or anot­her, had simply drop­ped them or left them he­re.</p>
   <p>    Quite cle­arly, the mess had be­en po­ked at, dug thro­ugh, and nes­ted in by all man­ner of ani­mals over the co­ur­se of se­ve­ral cen­tu­ri­es. Anyt­hing of fab­ric or le­at­her had long sin­ce got­ten so clo­se to the po­int of di­sin­teg­ra­ti­on that all you had to do was po­ke it and it fell apart, le­aving only bits of me­tal and less-iden­ti­fi­ab­le subs­tan­ces that had be­en used as or­na­men­ta­ti­on or fas­te­nings. So­me of it was ar­mor; re­cog­ni­zab­le bre­astp­la­tes and gre­aves, helms and vamb­ra­ces po­ked up he­re and the­re among the wrec­ka­ge. The­re we­re bo­xes that fell to bits at a to­uch, re­ve­aling a tan­ta­li­zing glimp­se of what the­ir con­tents might ha­ve be­en be­fo­re tho­se, too, fell in­to pi­les of dust and frag­men­ted fla­kes. The­re we­re swords and kni­ves and axes, but al­so less re­cog­ni­zab­le obj­ects and so­me that Sha­na co­uldn't ma­ke out at all.</p>
   <p>    It wasn't so much the me­tal obj­ects them­sel­ves that we­re fas­ci­na­ting, it was the me­tals that they we­re ma­de of. Li­ving among the El­ven­lords as she had, Sha­na was fa­mi­li­ar with the ways in which they ma­de bron­ze, brass, cop­per, sil­ver, and gold ser­ve any num­ber of pur­po­ses-but the obj­ects she fo­und we­ren't ma­de of any of tho­se me­tals. Most we­re const­ruc­ted of the dull grey stuff that Ke­man had fo­und, very light and strong, but cle­arly not­hing fa­mi­li­ar. Ot­her obj­ects we­re ma­de of so­met­hing equ­al­ly light and thin, and lo­oked li­ke ce­ra­mic or glass, but wha­te­ver it had be­en it was brit­tle and shat­te­red when fle­xed. It co­uldn't al­ways ha­ve be­en that brit­tle; pre­su­mably age had ren­de­red it fri­ab­le.</p>
   <p>    This sad lit­ter lay among the le­aves and sticks that had blown or be­en car­ri­ed in over the ye­ars, the mo­unds of dirt, of dust and cob­webs, the bo­nes of lit­tle ani­mals who had li­ved and di­ed he­re or had be­en bro­ught in and eaten.</p>
   <p>    But the­re we­re ot­her bo­nes he­re as well that we­re not of ani­mals-and when Sha­na ac­ci­den­tal­ly kic­ked a hel­met and it rol­led and dis­gor­ged a skull, she de­ci­ded that she'd had eno­ugh of exp­lo­ring and hur­ri­ed back to the spot that Ho­bie and Lynder had cle­ared of deb­ris and we­re ma­king in­to a camp. Kyrti­an had al­re­ady gat­he­red a small pi­le of things the­re, and was go­ing thro­ugh them whi­le the ot­her two put to­get­her a fi­re and the ma­kings of a hot me­al. The­re was cer­ta­inly no shor­ta­ge of fu­el for the fi­re, any­way.</p>
   <p>    "It's a pity not­hing of the bo­oks sur­vi­ved," Kyrti­an sa­id, lo­oking up, as she ap­pro­ac­hed the fri­endly warmth of the fi­re. "They've all go­ne ut­terly to bits that not even Moth co­uld re­const­ruct."</p>
   <p>    "I don't think it's a pity at all," she re­tor­ted. "Kyrti­an, it lo­oks as if the­se pe­op­le we­re run­ning for the­ir li­ves, and so­met­hing ma­de su­re that not all of them got out of he­re. That Eve­lon of yo­ur an­ces­tors must ha­ve be­en wor­se than even you tho­ught, and I'd rat­her not know anyt­hing abo­ut it."</p>
   <p>    "They're yo­ur an­ces­tors, too, Las­ha­na," Kyrti­an po­in­ted out with surp­ri­sing gent­le­ness. "Many of them we­re ar­ro­gant and sel­fish cre­atu­res who, as so­on as they got away from tho­se who we­re exp­lo­iting them, tur­ned abo­ut and op­pres­sed ot­hers-but so­me we­re li­ke me, li­ke my fat­her, and li­ke yo­ur fri­end Valyn. And they knew a very gre­at de­al that we wo­uld find use­ful, if we co­uld re­dis­co­ver it."</p>
   <p>    "All that gre­at le­ar­ning do­esn't se­em to ha­ve do­ne them much go­od he­re," Lynder ob­ser­ved, lo­oking aro­und the ca­ve, and shud­de­ring. "Do El­ven­lords le­ave ghosts be­hind when they die?"</p>
   <p>    Shana knew exactly how he was fe­eling. She had spent a gre­at de­al of her li­fe in ca­ves, and nor­mal­ly she felt qu­ite com­for­tab­le in them, but this one had an at­mosp­he­re that she co­uld only desc­ri­be as "ha­un­ted." Every word they spo­ke whis­pe­red and ec­ho­ed in a way that was qu­ite un­ner­ving, with bits of the­ir own con­ver­sa­ti­on lin­ge­ring long past the ti­me when Sha­na wo­uld ha­ve ex­pec­ted the so­unds to die away.</p>
   <p>    And now that they we­re all gat­he­red in aro­und the fi­re, Kyrt-ian had thrif­tily can­ce­led his ma­ge-lights. She was used to the way that a fi­re ma­de mo­ving sha­dows on ca­ve-wal­ls, but he­re we­re sha­dows that mo­ved wit­hin the sha­dows, and pla­ces whe­re blots of dark­ness we­re the­re when she lo­oked, but go­ne when she lo­oked aga­in. As for the smell-under the usu­al damp "ca­ve" scent, the­re was a hint of so­met­hing me­tal­lic and harsh.</p>
   <p>    It was only the first in a se­ri­es of ca­ves, as Ke­man had desc­ri­bed, for in the wall op­po­si­te the rock-fall, a dark maw of a furt­her ent­ran­ce ga­ped. She gu­es­sed that this ca­vern had be­en wa­ter-car­ved at so­me po­int, but whe­re the wa­ter had go­ne was an­yo­ne's gu­ess. Per­haps it had sunk furt­her in­to the depths of the hills, and they wo­uld en­co­un­ter it as they got de­eper in­to the ca­ves. It was a half-do­me now, the rock-fall co­ve­ring what had be­en a vast ent­ran­ce; the "ce­iling" was a go­od three or fo­ur sto­ri­es abo­ve the­ir he­ads. Un­der all the deb­ris, the flo­or was of sand, which at le­ast had the vir­tue of be­ing dry and sof­ter than rock.</p>
   <p>    But this ca­ve was not what Kyrti­an had co­me to hunt, not re­al­ly. The re­lics he­re we­re not­hing mo­re than the sign that this pla­ce was what Kyrti­an's fat­her had be­en lo­oking for. The­re was no sign of the El­ven­lord him­self-unless so­me of tho­se bo­nes-</p>
   <p>    No, he wo­uld ha­ve fo­und so­met­hing to re­cog­ni­ze his fat­her by, I sho­uld think.</p>
   <p>    There was al­so no sign of his "Gre­at Por­tal," or anyt­hing li­ke it; no sign of the comp­lex de­vi­ces Kyrti­an had desc­ri­bed when he'd told Sha­na what he was lo­oking for. How long be­fo­re Kyrtian dec­re­ed that it was ti­me to mo­ve de­eper in­to the comp­lex? The only con­ces­si­on to "ma­king camp" so far was the fi­re and a few rocks as se­ats aro­und it.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian saw her glan­cing re­luc­tantly to­wards the open ent­ran­ce at the re­ar, and ca­ught her eye. "Wha­te­ver is in the­re has wa­ited for de­ca­des," he sa­id-sadly, she tho­ught. "It can wa­it anot­her night. We ro­de li­ke fo­ols to get he­re, we're ti­red and wet and cold. We'd be furt­her fo­ols to go clim­bing aro­und in an unk­nown ca­ve in this sta­te. Pe­op­le get them­sel­ves kil­led do­ing stu­pid things li­ke that."</p>
   <p>    Lynder let out his bre­ath; cle­arly he'd be­en hol­ding it the mo­ment Kyrti­an be­gan to spe­ak, dre­ading be­ing told they we­re go­ing to ha­ve to gat­her the­ir strength and be off aga­in on­ce they'd eaten. "Thank you for that, my Lord," he sa­id sto­utly. "You've pre­ven­ted me from ha­ving to say the sa­me thing. I was af­ra­id if I did, you'd be angry, and if I didn't, Sar­ge­ant Gel wo­uld ha­ve the hi­de off me when we got back."</p>
   <p>    "I wo­uld ho­pe I wo­uld ne­ver be the kind of le­ader to put you in that sort of un­te­nab­le po­si­ti­on, Lynder," Kyrti­an rep­li­ed, but a we­ary spark­le ca­me back in­to his eyes, at le­ast for a mo­ment. "Fo­od and sle­ep, my lads-and my lady-" he ad­ded, bo­wing to Sha­na. "That's what's cal­led for he­re. And per­haps a lit­tle nar­ra­ti­ve from yo­ur fri­end on what it was li­ke to eavesd­rop out­si­de my tent. I am cu­ri­o­us to he­ar abo­ut that."</p>
   <p>    Keman bo­wed in his turn. "The only dif­fe­ren­ce bet­we­en us and yo­ur usu­al gu­ards, Lord Kyrti­an, was that we ha­ve much shar­per he­aring-and one of us was a lady her­self."</p>
   <p>    "Oh re­al­ly?" Kyrti­an le­aned for­ward. "Ple­ase go on…"</p>
   <p>    Hours la­ter, the fi­re di­ed down to co­als. Ke­man had go­ne out to catch him­self so­met­hing of an ap­prop­ri­ate si­ze for a dra­gon's din­ner. Be­fo­re he left, Sha­na and Kyrti­an had both ta­ken the ti­me-com­pa­ring no­tes the whi­le-to fen­ce in the­ir lit­tle camp with pro­tec­ti­ve ma­gic. In­te­res­tingly eno­ugh, ne­it­her of them had cho­sen to use ma­gic-shi­elds. Ins­te­ad, they had both op­ted for so­met­hing that wo­uld trig­ger an alarm if cros­sed, cle­aring a circ­le that Ke­man co­uld easily see so that he wo­uldn't trig­ger the alarm by trip­ping it when he re­tur­ned. Af­ter all, he co­uld simply sha­pes­hift in­to a bo­ul­der, and not­hing wo­uld dis­turb his rest; he didn't ne­ed alarms to warn him of dan­ger, sin­ce dan­ger wo­uld pass by wit­ho­ut no­ti­cing him.</p>
   <p>    Despite tho­se pre­ca­uti­ons, des­pi­te be­ing we­ary, Sha­na was ha­ving a hard ti­me get­ting to sle­ep. If con­ver­sa­ti­ons had ec­ho­ed un­can­nily aro­und the walls, the lit­tle so­unds the ot­hers ma­de as they mo­ved or sig­hed or mumb­led in the­ir sle­ep we­re wor­se. So­me­one wo­uld co­ugh a lit­tle, or turn over-mo­ments la­ter the so­und ca­me back, much dis­tor­ted, in­to so­met­hing that so­un­ded li­ke a fo­ots­tep, or a whis­pe­red word. So­me­ti­mes mul­tip­le ec­ho­es ca­me back, a bre­ath, a mur­mur of not-qu­ite-intel­li­gib­le con­ver­sa­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    She didn't ac­tu­al­ly fall as­le­ep un­til af­ter Ke­man fi­nal­ly re­tur­ned. He en­te­red as a dra­gon-a thin, sna­ke-li­ke dra­gon, the only way he co­uld fit him­self in thro­ugh that tiny ope­ning. He re­ma­ined as a dra­gon, cur­led up just out­si­de the bo­un­dary. His so­lid pre­sen­ce, bul­king lar­ge so clo­se at hand, fi­nal­ly ma­de her fe­el sa­fe. And in that mo­ment, sle­ep ca­me.</p>
   <p>    Triana's pe­op­le had pitc­hed a sec­lu­ded camp at a disc­re­et dis­tan­ce from the si­te that was evi­dently Kyrti­an's go­al. Ra­in drip­ped ste­adily on the can­vas of her tent as she pli­ed the fo­res­ter with qu­es­ti­ons, a soft glow from a ma­ge-light sus­pen­ded abo­ve them shi­ning down on his fa­ce and high­ligh­ting ro­ugh-hewn fe­atu­res that Tri­ana had be­gun to ta­ke a li­king to. The rug­ged lo­oks of all of the­se men we­re be­gin­ning to grow on her; by com­pa­ri­son, her ca­re­ful­ly-sculp­ted and tra­ined sla­ve-toys, tho­ugh mo­re de­fi­ned and mus­cu­lar, ac­tu­al­ly se­emed rat­her bo­yish and im­ma­tu­re.</p>
   <p>    "So, fi­ve of them en­te­red, and the rest are-whe­re?" Tri­ana as­ked her sco­ut.</p>
   <p>    "Gracious Lady, I co­uldn't find them." He didn't shrug, but she won­de­red what his im­pas­si­ve exp­res­si­on hid. Pro­bably ner­vo­us­ness, fe­ar of her an­ger; he was de­fi­ni­tely swe­ating, just at his ha­ir­li­ne. "I sta­yed to watch, then re­ma­ined on­ce they had be­en in­si­de for so­me ti­me and dark­ness had fal­len. I clim­bed to the ent­ran­ce to ma­ke cer­ta­in that Lord Kyrti­an and the fo­ur who accompanied him in­ten­ded to set up camp the­re; they had ge­ar down the­re eno­ugh to do so, and such se­emed to be the­ir in­ten­ti­ons. When I went to lo­ok for the ot­hers, ho­we­ver, they co­uld not be fo­und."</p>
   <p>    "I can't be­li­eve he wo­uld ha­ve sent them back," she mu­sed alo­ud. "No, I'm su­re he must ha­ve cre­ated an il­lu­si­on to clo­ak the­ir camp-it is what I wo­uld ha­ve do­ne in his pla­ce. Or el­se they them­sel­ves are ta­king no chan­ces on the cre­atu­res lur­king in this fo­rest, and ha­ve hid­den the­ir camp…"</p>
   <p>    "It was qu­ite dark by that ti­me, my lady," he sa­id dif­fi­dently.</p>
   <p>    "And you cor­rectly re­mem­be­red yo­ur or­ders to ke­ep track of Kyrti­an, not his sla­ves." She nod­ded. "Did you ma­ke any ef­fort to see what was wit­hin the ca­ve it­self?"</p>
   <p>    He sho­ok his he­ad. "Lord Kyrti­an had ma­ge-lights all thro­ugh the pla­ce, but it is very lar­ge, and a hard climb down. The flo­or is lit­te­red with deb­ris, but I co­uld not tell you what it was at that dis­tan­ce. The usu­al trash one finds in a ca­ve, I sup­po­se."</p>
   <p>    So he had co­me stra­ight back he­re; that sho­wed a fi­ne ba­lan­ce bet­we­en obe­di­en­ce and go­od sen­se. She smi­led at him, and tho­ught that his ner­vo­us­ness eb­bed, a lit­tle. "You've do­ne well; I wo­uld rat­her that you ca­me back he­re to tell me what hap­pe­ned than was­te ti­me in trying to dis­co­ver the whe­re­abo­uts of a lot of men who will pro­bably do not­hing un­til the­ir mas­ter re­turns." She la­ug­hed, then, and her man re­la­xed a lit­tle furt­her. "As I ha­ve sa­id be­fo­re, what Kyrti­an can do, I can do. I ha­ve no ne­ed of you men in­si­de that ca­ve; I ha­ve no in­ten­ti­on of conf­ron­ting Lord Kyrti­an, I only wish to dis­co­ver what he is up to. I can do that be­ing ca­re­ful and using my own po­wers of il­lu­si­on to clo­ak my pre­sen­ce on­ce one of you has hel­ped me climb down. You, me­anw­hi­le, ha­ve ma­na­ged to outf­lank Ael­mar­kin and get us he­re only a lit­tle be­hind Lord Kyrti­an's men. I be­li­eve you de­ser­ve a bit of a ho­li­day."</p>
   <p>    Now the sla­ve un­bent en­ti­rely. "Thank you, my lady," was all he sa­id, but she saw the exp­res­si­on in his eyes chan­ge to one of wary gra­ti­tu­de, rat­her li­ke a som­ber, alert co­ur­sing-ho­und of­fe­red an unex­pec­ted tre­at. She of­fe­red him a cup of her wi­ne; he ac­cep­ted it with a pro­fo­und bow and drank it off at a gulp. A pity; it was a go­od vin­ta­ge, but li­kely he wo­uldn't know go­od from bad. Per­haps she wo­uld edu­ca­te him.</p>
   <p>    "I will go in­to the ca­ve to­mor­row to fol­low Kyrti­an. Be­fo­re I do, I wo­uld li­ke you to find a go­od, out-of-the-way pla­ce to camp that is un­li­kely to be stumb­led ac­ross by Ael­mar­kin's men. I'll clo­ak it with il­lu­si­on and you all can dis­port yo­ur­sel­ves as you will un­til I re­turn." His eyes ab­so­lu­tely lit, and she la­ug­hed. "And yes, this me­ans you may help yo­ur­sel­ves to any of the pro­vi­si­ons, the wi­ne inc­lu­ded. I don't ex­pect to ha­ve to spend much ti­me in that ho­le, and when I re­turn, our bu­si­ness will be to ma­ke all spe­ed back. Too many pro­vi­si­ons will only slow us down."</p>
   <p>    She wo­uld ta­ke the pre­ca­uti­on of chan­ging the wi­ne so that it ma­de an­yo­ne who drank it tran­qu­il rat­her than rowdy. She co­uld al­ways chan­ge it back when she re­tur­ned. Bet­ter that they la­ze a lit­tle whi­le she was go­ne; it wo­uld ru­in her plans en­ti­rely for Ael­mar­kin's pe­op­le to dis­co­ver hers be­ca­use they we­re ca­ro­using and sin­ging or figh­ting be­hind her clo­ak of il­lu­si­on.</p>
   <p>    If so­met­hing el­se ca­me ac­ross them and they we­re in­ca­pa­ci­ta­ted, well-the­re we­re ot­her ways she co­uld get ho­me. If they didn't ta­ke the pre­ca­uti­on of set­ting a so­ber sentry, they we­ren't worth the mo­ney she'd pa­id for them.</p>
   <p>    "Have anot­her cup," she sa­id, with a daz­zling smi­le, re­fil­ling his gob­let. "Then go and tell the ot­hers what I just told you. I'll want clim­bing ge­ar re­ady for me first thing when I wa­ke; you can see me sa­fely down, then re­turn he­re to the ot­hers to wa­it for my re­turn."</p>
   <p>    A few ho­urs past dawn, Ael­mar­kin sto­od lo­oking up at a vast pi­le of tumb­led rocks; the tra­il ap­pa­rently en­ded the­re, ac­cor­ding to his fo­res­ter. As usu­al, the ski­es drip­ped. He sho­ok ra­in out of his eyes with ir­ri­ta­ti­on; was the­re ne­ver a bre­ak from the wretc­hed stuff he­re?</p>
   <p>    And Kyrti­an, An­ces­tors cur­se him, had fo­und a way out of the wretc­hed stuff. "A ca­ve?" Ael­mar­kin sa­id inc­re­du­lo­usly. "The­re's a ca­ve up the­re? And Kyrti­an craw­led in the­re?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes, my Lord," the fo­res­ter sa­id in­to the gro­und at Aelmarkin's fe­et. "It is a very, very lar­ge ca­ve; the ope­ning is ne­ar to the top of it. I co­uld not tell how many of his men went in with him, but the ma­in tra­il ends he­re, and I can cle­arly see whe­re a num­ber of pe­op­le went up that slo­pe and en­te­red in­to a gap at the top. Wit­ho­ut light I can­not see what is in­si­de, but if they we­re still im­me­di­ately in­si­de it, I must sup­po­se they'd ha­ve lights of the­ir own, so I pre­su­me they've go­ne in de­eper."</p>
   <p>    "By the An­ces­tors." Ael­mar­kin be­gan to chuck­le. "Well, it's pretty cle­ar that, wha­te­ver is he­re, it's not Wi­zards. Un­less this is so­me for­got­ten ent­ran­ce in­to the­ir la­ir."</p>
   <p>    "Forgotten, my lord, or no lon­ger in use be­ca­use of the rock-fall," the sco­ut sa­id, he­ad still bent. "But I drop­ped a torch wit­hin, when I co­uld see no signs of Lord Kyrti­an or his men down be­low, and be­fo­re it gut­te­red out all I saw was lit­ter. It ap­pe­ars that if this pla­ce was ever in use as an ent­ran­ce, it has not be­en used so for a very long ti­me."</p>
   <p>    "That's go­od eno­ugh for me!" Ael­mar­kin rep­li­ed. He con­si­de­red the si­tu­ati­on. "I'll ta­ke you with me; the rest can camp he­re. We'll see if we can't dis­co­ver what Kyrti­an thinks he's up to."</p>
   <p>    "It will be very dif­fi­cult to con­ce­al our­sel­ves in a ca­ve, my lord," the man be­gan.</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin cut him off with a ges­tu­re; the wa­ter from Ael-mar­kin's sod­den sle­eve spat­te­red him from he­ad to toe, and Ael­mar­kin felt a bit of so­ur ple­asu­re as the sla­ve win­ced. "Not for a ma­ge, you fo­ol! Get wha­te­ver ge­ar we'll ne­ed-we're al­re­ady ho­urs be­hind him." He lo­oked aro­und at the rest of his sla­ves. "And you! Put up a pro­per camp this ti­me! When I get back, I ex­pect to see so­met­hing ot­her than a half-pitc­hed tent and a fi­re that won't start! And get mo­ving!"</p>
   <p>    He put a sting of war­ning in his vo­ice to re­mind them of the sting of his pu­nish­ments, pu­nish­ments that he had inf­lic­ted fre­qu­ently thro­ugh the­ir col­lars each ti­me they bumb­led a task. It got them go­ing, alt­ho­ugh slug­gishly.</p>
   <p>    Well, no mat­ter. In a few mo­ments, he was go­ing to be in­si­de a dry ca­ve. If they co­uldn't ma­na­ge to put a camp to­get­her properly by the ti­me he got back, on the way ho­me he'd start crip­pling them and le­aving them be­hind on the tra­il to at­tract the hor­rors that se­emed to stalk the­se fo­rests. That wo­uld gi­ve his de­ar co­usin so­met­hing to ha­ve to de­al with on his way back to ci­vi­li­za­ti­on. At the le­ast, Kyrti­an wo­uld be de­la­yed in re­tur­ning to his pat­ron, Lord Kyndreth.</p>
   <p>    And at the most-Ael­mar­kin wo­uld no lon­ger ha­ve anyt­hing stan­ding bet­we­en him­self and everyt­hing he wan­ted.</p>
   <p>    This must be that fab­led Por­tal to Eve­lon, with all of the things that had be­en left be­hind scat­te­red abo­ut. The Wi­zards, if they exis­ted at all, cer­ta­inly we­ren't he­re. Op­por­tu­nity wa­ited and Fa­te smi­led on Ael­mar­kin at last. And de­pen­ding on what he fo­und in that ca­ve-well, by the ti­me he re­tur­ned ho­me, Ael­mar­kin might even be ab­le to gi­ve Lord Kyndreth him­self a lit­tle he­althy com­pe­ti­ti­on for as­cen­dancy on the Gre­at Co­un­cil.</p>

   <p>    Triana lo­oked up at the dim, une­ven oval of grey light that mar­ked the ope­ning to the outer world, and ab­sently kic­ked so­met­hing dry and crack­ling from be­ne­ath her fe­et. The­re was no sign of her sla­ve, but she hadn't ex­pec­ted him to lin­ger on­ce she was sa­fely down. She won­de­red if she had surp­ri­sed her fo­res­ter by get­ting down in­to the ca­ve rat­her han­dily with not­hing mo­re in the way of help than one of the ro­pes that Kyrti­an's pe­op­le had left be­hind; she cer­ta­inly surp­ri­sed her­self.</p>
   <p>    Then aga­in, it was very in­te­res­ting what sorts of things one co­uld do with ma­gic when one was ter­ri­fi­ed out of one's wits. It had be­en a very long way down to the flo­or of the ca­ve from that tiny ent­ran­ce abo­ve; for­tu­na­tely Kyrti­an's own pe­op­le had left all the­ir ro­pes be­hind, re­ady to climb out when they re­tur­ned, so at le­ast she had had the com­fort of kno­wing her li­fe­li­ne was tes­ted and tri­ed.</p>
   <p>    Ah, but Kyrti­an had ne­ver be­en ta­ught the subt­le art of El­ven fe­ma­le ma­gic, and if he ca­me back he'd ha­ve the be­ne­fit of her pas­sa­ge. She'd had no no­ti­on she co­uld ma­ke a ro­pe stron­ger- or her­self bri­efly stron­ger as well. By the ti­me her fe­et to­uc­hed the flo­or of the ca­ve, she had im­par­ted the tran­si­tory strength of one of her fo­res­ters to her arms and legs-and she co­uld ha­ve used the ro­pe she dang­led from to lo­wer a hor­se and wa­gon wit­ho­ut wor­rying abo­ut it snap­ping.</p>
   <p>    So at a gu­ess, she ought to be ab­le to get her­self back up the tumb­le of rock wit­ho­ut mis­hap and no as­sis­tan­ce; it was ad­mit­tedly easi­er to climb when one had ma­gic to help.</p>
   <p>    It was temp­ting to think abo­ut blas­ting her way out with le­vin-bolts, tho­ugh; she'd be­en prac­ti­cing for ye­ars now in sec­ret and she was get­ting qu­ite pro­fi­ci­ent. It wo­uld me­an less exer­ti­on. Ho­we­ver, the­re we­re draw­backs as well-in the glimp­ses she'd got­ten of the ce­iling, she wasn't al­to­get­her su­re of how stab­le it was, and it wo­uldn't do her a gre­at de­al of go­od to bring the ce­iling down on her­self ins­te­ad of blas­ting her way out.</p>
   <p>    Not subt­le, my de­ar. Not yo­ur style.</p>
   <p>    Besides, un­less Kyrti­an ca­me to gri­ef in the­re, she didn't in­tend to le­ave any tra­ce of her own pas­sing, so she wo­uld pro­bably ha­ve to get out the hard way.</p>
   <p>    Meanwhile, in the gle­am of her ma­ge-light, the only sign that Kyrti­an had be­en he­re was a de­ad camp­fi­re and a cle­ared circ­le among the rub­bish lit­te­ring the flo­or. He must ha­ve go­ne off long be­fo­re she even wo­ke, and had got­ten a go­od de­al ahe­ad of her. So if she was to dis­co­ver what he was up to, she had bet­ter get mo­ving.</p>
   <p>    She pa­used long eno­ugh to re­co­ver her bre­ath and her po­wer-she'd be­en hot and swe­aty as well, but in the cold, dank ca­ve-air she'd co­oled down qu­ickly and was glad of the clo­ak she'd bro­ught with her, ti­ed in a bund­le abo­ut her wa­ist.</p>
   <p>    Now for a lit­tle ma­gic. She smi­led to her­self as she wo­ve power aro­und her; this was subt­le, and not so­met­hing a me­re ma­le wo­uld ever ap­pre­ci­ate. The il­lu­si­on she cast upon her­self was a rat­her cle­ver one; it wasn't pre­ci­sely in­vi­si­bi­lity, sin­ce that wasn't strictly pos­sib­le. Ins­te­ad, she clo­aked her­self in the ima­ge of what was be­hind her, so that an­yo­ne lo­oking at her wo­uld see only what her body or­di­na­rily wo­uld ha­ve obs­cu­red-a kind of ref­lec­ti­on, but not exactly. The il­lu­si­on wasn't per­fect; it co­uldn't be. An­yo­ne lo­oking clo­sely might well see a fa­int out­li­ne of her body, or no­ti­ce her sha­dow on the flo­or. That was why she wo­re a light clo­ak that co­ve­red her from he­ad to toe, for a bulky ir­re­gu­lar out­li­ne aga­inst the ro­ugh rock of the ca­ve was less li­kely to be no­ti­ced than one with arms, legs, and a he­ad.</p>
   <p>    She had a rat­her cle­ver de­vi­ce with her as well, a co­ne of mir­ror-fi­nis­hed me­tal with a hand­le at its po­int. She bro­ught her ma­ge-light down and co­axed it in­to the co­ne. Now she co­uld di­rect all of the light whe­re she cho­se wit­ho­ut half-blin­ding her­self, or set­ting the stu­pid thing to ho­ver abo­ve her he­ad. She cast the be­am of light ref­lec­ted out of the co­ne aro­und her­self, and used it to pick a path ac­ross the deb­ris to an ope­ning at the re­ar of this enor­mo­us ca­vern.</p>
   <p>    She be­gan to wish that the light wasn't sho­wing her way qu­ite so cle­arly. As the light pic­ked out this or that obj­ect amidst the sticks and le­aves and trash, she'd ha­ve had to ha­ve be­en blind not to spot the bits of ar­mor-and the bo­nes.</p>
   <p>    Bones which we­re not all the bo­nes of ani­mals, nor of hu­man sla­ves, even if the ar­mor co­uld ha­ve be­en mis­ta­ken for anyt­hing but el­ven-ma­de.</p>
   <p>    Her skin craw­led as the empty eye-soc­kets of an el­ven skull gla­red at her on the ed­ge of her circ­le of light. She had al­re­ady known that so­met­hing ter­rib­le had hap­pe­ned he­re, but it was one thing to know that in­tel­lec­tu­al­ly, and qu­ite anot­her to be conf­ron­ted with the evi­den­ce of ut­ter di­sas­ter.</p>
   <p>    A chill that had not­hing to do with the tem­pe­ra­tu­re of this pla­ce set­tled over her, and she re­sis­ted the ur­ge to flee back up that ro­pe in­to the open'. Wha­te­ver had hap­pe­ned he­re had oc­cur­red a very long ti­me ago, even by the stan­dards of the Elvenlords, and not­hing, not even ghosts, co­uld lin­ger for that long. But she fan­ci­ed she ca­ught a whiff of an­ci­ent de­ath, of bo­ne-dust and ter­ror, and she co­uldn't ke­ep her ima­gi­na­ti­on from pa­in­ting sce­nes that we­re not at all com­for­tab­le.</p>
   <p>    Nevertheless, as she pic­ked her way ac­ross the flo­or, she avo­ided lo­oking too clo­sely at anyt­hing lar­ge eno­ugh and whi­te eno­ugh to be bo­ne.</p>
   <p>    Were the­re whis­pers, out the­re in the dark? Was that a mo­ve­ment, not in the sha­dow, but of the sha­dow? She told her­self re­so­lu­tely that she wasn't af­ra­id, that only stu­pid sla­ves be­li­eved in spi­rits, but-</p>
   <p>    There we­re so­unds out the­re in the dark­ness, so­unds that co­uld be ec­ho­es, but co­uld be so­met­hing el­se as well. She co­uldn't even ima­gi­ne what co­uld ha­ve kil­led so many El­ves, so qu­ickly-and the sla­ves sa­id that the spi­rits of tho­se who di­ed vi­olently lin­ge­red, hun­ge­ring af­ter the li­fe they'd lost and eager to aven­ge the­ir de­aths on anyt­hing li­ving.</p>
   <p>    She fo­und her­self star­ting at every unex­pec­ted so­und, and lon­ged for the mo­ment when she re­ac­hed the far wall and the ent­ran­ce de­eper in­to the ca­ves.</p>
   <p>    She had as­su­med that on­ce she got to the ent­ran­ce in­to the next ca­ve she wo­uld find her path cle­ar. In fact, she fo­und not­hing of the kind.</p>
   <p>    What had be­en lit­ter on the flo­or of the ca­ve was a tang­led bloc­ka­ge he­re; so­me­one, Kyrti­an and his pe­op­le, she as­su­med, had cle­ared a path­way thro­ugh, but if the ar­ti­facts the­re had not al­re­ady be­en re­ady to fall apart at a to­uch, it co­uldn't ha­ve be­en do­ne in less than a we­ek. He­re the carts of the re­fu­ge­es had jam­med at the ent­ran­ce, and the­re we­re many, many mo­re bo­nes, eno­ugh so that it was no lon­ger in her ima­gi­na­ti­on that they im­par­ted the­ir own dry hint of an­cest­ral cor­rup­ti­on to the air. Big bo­nes, the­se, the bo­nes of dray-ani­mals long sin­ce for­got­ten, for they had pe­ris­hed along with the­ir mas­ters, tang­led in the shafts of di­sin­teg­ra­ting carts in at­ti­tu­des that sug­ges­ted a ti­de of un­re­aso­ning pa­nic had was­hed over them and sent them scat­te­ring be­fo­re it.</p>
   <p>    And mo­re el­ven bo­nes, this ti­me ones wit­ho­ut ar­mor. Wo­men? Old men?</p>
   <p>    A di­sin­teg­ra­ting wa­gon that had be­en la­den with small, slen­der cre­atu­res-it to­ok her a mo­ment to get past the dis­be­li­ef to un­ders­tand that this had be­en a wa­gon full of child­ren.</p>
   <p>    It was hard to ima­gi­ne. One sel­dom saw el­ven child­ren; they we­re usu­al­ly kept in nur­se­ri­es un­til they we­re con­si­de­red old eno­ugh to ming­le with the rest of so­ci­ety. She co­uld hardly ima­gi­ne so many in one pla­ce. What sort of spi­rit wo­uld a child le­ave be­hind? So­met­hing wispy and me­lanc­holy-or fe­ral and vi­ci­o­us?</p>
   <p>    Whatever had sent the El­ven­lords in­to flight had ter­ri­fi­ed the­ir be­asts as well. Tri­ana be­gan to fe­el a cer­ta­in re­li­ef that the few scraps of in­for­ma­ti­on she'd gle­aned had not be­en mo­re spe­ci­fic, that le­gend now pa­in­ted the Cros­sing as a mat­ter of tri­umph rat­her than the tra­gedy it had so cle­arly be­en. She didn't want to know the de­ta­ils now; the­re we­re al­re­ady too many de­ta­ils writ lar­ge in the bo­nes of tho­se who had not sur­vi­ved to be­co­me her an­ces­tors.</p>
   <p>    She re­ac­hed out her hand to ste­ady her­self, and wo­od went to dust at her to­uch, en­lar­ging the pas­sa­ge that Kyrti­an's pe­op­le had al­re­ady ma­de. Her very skin flinc­hed away from that dust, but it ro­se in clo­uds abo­ut her and dri­ed her mo­uth and thro­at, as if the de­ad them­sel­ves ro­se to ma­ke cla­ims on her…</p>
   <p>    Don't be such a su­pers­ti­ti­o­us idi­ot! she scol­ded her­self, but wit­ho­ut ef­fect. Her po­un­ding he­art, the blo­od rus­hing in her ears, her very skin we­re re­bels to her re­ason.</p>
   <p>    But she for­ced her­self past, and on­ce out of the jam-up, the way sud­denly cle­ared. No mo­re bo­nes; or at le­ast, no­ne that flas­hed whi­tely at her in the circ­le of her light. Just-things. Be­lon­gings, dis­car­ded, uni­den­ti­fi­ab­le. She co­uld co­pe with things. Es­pe­ci­al­ly things that went to atoms at a to­uch, col­lap­sing in on them­sel­ves and le­aving not­hing be­hind that cal­led up un­com­for­tably fa­mi­li­ar ima­ges in the mind.</p>
   <p>    The path that Kyrti­an's un­der­lings to­ok was pla­inly scri­bed in that lit­ter, a tra­il whe­re only bits of me­tal sho­ne dully in the dust. She pa­used a mo­ment to lis­ten, and tho­ught she ca­ught the fa­in­test of mur­murs from so­mew­he­re far ahe­ad; co­ve­red her light, but saw no glim­mers in the dis­tan­ce. Whe­re­ver he was, if that was, in­de­ed, the so­und of him and his pe­op­le, it was far ahe­ad of her. She hur­ri­ed on, sud­denly hungry for the sight of so­met­hing li­ving, even if it was an enemy. A li­ving enemy right now was pre­fe­rab­le to the whis­pers in the dark.</p>
   <p>    "This pla­ce ma­kes my skin crawl," Lynder mut­te­red to Sha­na. "I don't see how he can stand it." He was pa­le, freck­les she hadn't no­ti­ced be­fo­re stan­ding out cle­arly ac­ross his che­eks. She al­so hadn't no­ti­ced how yo­ung he was be­fo­re this; all of Kyrti­an's pe­op­le we­re so com­pe­tent and con­fi­dent that she'd ta­ken them all for ma­tu­re adults. Now she saw Lynder for the be­ard­less boy he ac­tu­al­ly was, newly jum­ped-up from a pa­ge, per­haps. Well, fe­ar did that to pe­op­le.</p>
   <p>    Shana didn't see how the­ir le­ader co­uld se­em so unaf­fec­ted by the pla­ce, eit­her. Kyrti­an had ma­ge-lights flo­ating si­lently over the­ir he­ads, set to avo­id col­li­si­on with the ce­iling but ot­her­wi­se ligh­ting up this se­ri­es of smal­ler ca­ves with pi­ti­less cla­rity. The tang­le of carts and be­asts at the mo­uth of this comp­lex had be­en the worst, of co­ur­se; Sha­na had be­en so temp­ted to flee scre­aming away and swarm right back up the ro­pe in­to the cle­an ra­in out­si­de.</p>
   <p>    And the cart full of what had be­en child­ren! No mat­ter what the El­ves had do­ne to her, to the Wi­zards, and es­pe­ci­al­ly to the­ir sla­ves-the tho­ught of that cart­lo­ad of child­ren dying tang­led up to­get­her in the dark-</p>
   <p>    It had ma­de her thro­at clo­se and her eyes sting, and she didn't ca­re that it had hap­pe­ned hund­reds of ye­ars ago.</p>
   <p>    They think I'm fe­ar­less, she had told her­self. And that had ma­de her clench her te­eth, thrust out her chin, and pre­tend that her who­le body wasn't flinc­hing away from the wrec­ka­ge, the bo­nes. She squ­ared her sho­ul­ders, and ten­sed to ke­ep her­self from shi­ve­ring. The­se we­re men she had to imp­ress; they we­ren't Wi­zards, they we­ren't sla­ves. She was a le­gend to them, and if they lost fa­ith in the le­gend-they wo­uld lo­se fa­ith in the ca­use. She ne­eded them; mo­re, pro­bably, than they ne­eded her. If all it to­ok to ke­ep the­ir fa­ith was to pre­tend to be ut­terly fe­ar­less, it was a small pri­ce to pay for that fa­ith.</p>
   <p>    But Kyrti­an had only di­rec­ted the en­lar­ge­ment of a pas­sa­ge al­re­ady the­re… a pas­sa­ge sho­wing the imp­rint of a sing­le pa­ir of nar­row fe­et in the dust.</p>
   <p>    His fat­her ma­de it; he must ha­ve. Kyrti­an knows thai. This is what he's be­en lo­oking for, and all he can see is tho­se fo­otp­rints le­ading us de­eper.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian had spent a long mo­ment stud­ying tho­se prints… then he had ta­ken the le­ad, fa­ce im­mo­bi­le and exp­res­si­on­less, as the rest had to stretch to ke­ep up with him.</p>
   <p>    "I've ne­ver se­en him li­ke this be­fo­re," Lynder con­ti­nu­ed, wi­ping swe­at from his fa­ce with his sle­eve, le­aving be­hind a smud­ge of the dust of the de­ad obs­cu­ring the freck­les scat­te­red ac­ross his che­eks. He shud­de­red.</p>
   <p>    "He's not thin­king abo­ut you-or abo­ut an­yo­ne," Ke­man sa­id slowly. "He's comp­le­tely in­si­de his own he­ad."</p>
   <p>    The three of them exc­han­ged glan­ces; she re­ad in Lynder's fa­ce that he at le­ast wo­uld rat­her not be privy to what was in Kyrti­an's he­ad just now. She rat­her ag­re­ed with him.</p>
   <p>    It was bad eno­ugh be­ing out he­re. The de­eper in­to this string of ca­ves they got, the mo­re the fe­eling of do­om-whet­her lin­ge­ring or im­pen­ding she co­uldn't say-incre­ased. She'd ne­ver be­en cla­ust­rop­ho­bic be­fo­re, but she felt the walls of the­se lit­tle ca­ves clo­sing in on her-or was it that they se­emed to pul­se and he­ave, slowly, as if they all tra­ve­led down the gul­let of so­me im­pos­sibly hu­ge, sle­eping mons­ter? If the walls cle­arly hadn 't be­en rock, the flo­or cle­arly the sa­me, it wo­uld ha­ve be­en all too easy to suc­cumb to the il­lu­si­on.</p>
   <p>    "Do you fe­el it?" Ke­man mur­mu­red, for her ears only. "That kind of dro­ne in the back of yo­ur bra­in? Li­ke the­re's so­met­hing just ba­rely awa­ke out the­re and we're to­uc­hing the ed­ge of its dre­ams? Or the­re's so­met­hing sin­ging a nasty dir­ge in its sle­ep?"</p>
   <p>    She nod­ded. She did; had, in fact, sin­ce they'd be­en he­re. It wasn't get­ting any stron­ger, and if Ke­man hadn't sa­id anyt­hing, she'd ha­ve put it down to ner­ves-but it was the­re, a so­und so deep it co­uld only be felt. She won­de­red what el­se Ke­man he­ard; he had the be­ne­fit of sen­ses that co­uld be en­han­ced wit­ho­ut any im­me­di­ate li­mit.</p>
   <p>    "There's not­hing ali­ve down he­re, eit­her," Ke­man con­ti­nu­ed, and shi­ve­red. "Not even sli­me."</p>
   <p>    Nothing ali­ve. Un­he­ard of. Ca­ves al­ways had the­ir own lit­tle com­mu­nity of cre­atu­res: in­sects, bats, mi­ce, and the fun­gi that the lit­tlest fed on be­fo­re they in turn be­ca­me the prey of the big­gest. Whe­re we­re they all?</p>
   <p>    And what dro­ve them away?</p>
   <p>    She co­uldn't see Kyrti­an's fa­ce from her pla­ce at the re­ar of the gro­up, but Lynder's was ble­ac­hed as whi­te as the bo­nes they'd left back the­re, and she fan­ci­ed her own was, as well. Li­fe le­ac­hed out of them with every step they to­ok de­eper in­to the maw of the mo­un­ta­in.</p>
   <p>    Shana sud­denly felt that they wo­uld ne­ver le­ave this pla­ce; that they wo­uld con­ti­nue to stumb­le along in Kyrti­an's wa­ke un­til they drop­ped in the­ir tracks and di­ed. That this was what had hap­pe­ned to Kyrti­an's fat­her-no ac­ci­dent, but the mo­un­ta­in suc­king the li­fe out of him as he plod­ded de­eper in­to its depths, lu­red by its pro­mi­se and thre­at un­til he stumb­led and co­uld not ri­se aga­in.</p>
   <p>    Then, wit­ho­ut war­ning, Kyrti­an stop­ped.</p>
   <p>    The ma­ge-lights un­der Kyrti­an's cont­rol shot past them out in­to so­me vast spa­ce ahe­ad, and they kept from blun­de­ring in­to him only by swer­ving to his right or left. Which bro­ught all of them to stand next to him at the ed­ge of an ab­rupt drop-off, sta­ring out in­to a ca­vern that co­uld ha­ve swal­lo­wed any ca­ve Sha­na had ever se­en wit­ho­ut a tra­ce. Her pul­se rac­ke­ted in her thro­at: how ne­arly she had go­ne over the ed­ge!</p>
   <p>    At le­ast, that was her ini­ti­al re­ac­ti­on. As she te­ete­red on the ed­ge and her eyes adj­us­ted, it be­ca­me cle­ar that the drop-off was not ne­arly as far as pa­nic had ma­de her think. She might ha­ve bro­ken an ank­le had she go­ne over, all un­war­ned, but no wor­se than that-the il­lu­si­on of a she­er pre­ci­pi­ce was just that, il­lu­si­on. Af­ter the ini­ti­al drop, a ste­ep slo­pe slan­ted away from them to the flo­or of this new ca­ve. It was what bul­ked he­re in ordered rows, off in the dis­tan­ce, that drew the eye and con­fu­sed the mind.</p>
   <p>    Objects. No. Const­ructs. Things of me­tal, ge­ars, whe­els, things that might be arms or legs or ne­it­her. Big as a ho­use, so­me of them. Row upon row of them, three ab­re­ast, le­ading back to the big­gest const­ruct of all, a hu­ge arch of so­me dull gre­en stuff that lo­oked de­ader than the bo­nes they pas­sed but felt ali­ve and full of bro­oding me­na­ce.</p>
   <p>    Over everyt­hing lay, not me­rely a film, but a thick shro­ud of dust, obs­cu­ring the shi­ne of me­tal, sof­te­ning ang­les in­to cur­ves. Thick as a blan­ket in so­me pla­ces; so thick that sec­ti­ons had ac­tu­al­ly bro­ken off and fal­len from the si­des.</p>
   <p>    "What-are-those?" Sha­na as­ked, her vo­ice high and stra­ined.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian only sho­ok his he­ad. "I don't know. The­re isn't an­yo­ne ali­ve who co­uld tell you. Oh, I know what they are col­lec­ti­vely, they're things the An­ces­tors ma­de to ser­ve them in all the ways that sla­ves do now. Ma­gic is what ma­de them work, but on­ce the Por­tal clo­sed, they wo­uldn't work any­mo­re and they we­re aban­do­ned. As to why they wo­uldn't work, I can't say."</p>
   <p>    "Serve them?" Lynder sa­id, puz­zle­ment in his vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian's to­ne was as dry as the dust lying over everyt­hing. "Of co­ur­se. You don't think our An­ces­tors ever put hand to to­ol them­sel­ves, do you? They cre­ated the­se things-to plow and dig, bu­ild and te­ar down-"</p>
   <p>    "And ma­ke war?" Ke­man as­ked, harshly.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian glan­ced at him, mo­uth set in a thin li­ne. But his to­ne was mild. "Ma­ke war?" he rep­li­ed, softly. "Oh yes. That, cer­ta­inly. Abo­ve all ot­her things. The An­ces­tors ma­de war among them­sel­ves, war of a sort that ma­kes everyt­hing we did to the Wi­zards se­em the me­rest ga­me."</p>
   <p>    Shana lo­oked away from Kyrti­an's fa­ce back to the rank upon rank of const­ruc­ti­ons, and shud­de­red. Un­der the dust, me­tal gle­amed with cru­el ef­fi­ci­ency. We­re tho­se bla­des? Was that a re­aper of corn-or of li­ves? A dig­ger of ditc­hes-or of gra­ves?</p>
   <p>    She de­ci­ded not to ask a qu­es­ti­on to which she did not want to know the ans­wer.</p>
   <p>    But Kyrti­an ma­de a strang­led lit­tle so­und, and ab­ruptly jum­ped down from the ed­ge of the ca­ve-mo­uth, lan­ding in a cro­uch only to sprint off to one si­de of the hu­ge ca­vern, whe­re the­re we­re a few of the mec­ha­nisms that we­re not in such or­de­red rows. With a muf­fled oath, Lynder fol­lo­wed, then the rest of them, tra­iling along be­hind.</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin cur­sed the men who lo­we­red him down every ti­me he col­li­ded with anot­her rock, las­hing them thro­ugh the­ir col­lars with the pu­nish­ment of pa­in. It was not eno­ugh to sa­tisfy him, but he da­red to do no mo­re; too much and they only be­ca­me clum­si­er. He'd as­su­med-fo­olishly, in ret­ros­pect-that they co­uld simply lo­wer him down com­for­tably to the bot­tom of the pla­ce. Ins­te­ad, he was ha­ving to prac­ti­cal­ly walk down the tumb­led slo­pe of rocks that was the mir­ror of the pi­le out­si­de; just as dif­fi­cult as be­ing ha­uled up that slo­pe, but mo­re pa­in­ful, sin­ce the idi­ots abo­ve kept dis­lod­ging rocks that fell on his he­ad and they kept lo­we­ring him in a se­ri­es of jerks. Each one endfcd in a col­li­si­on with mo­re rocks sin­ce each ti­me he was ca­ught off-gu­ard and off-ba­lan­ce.</p>
   <p>    Idiots! He wo­uld cer­ta­inly le­ave so­me of them be­hind as ba­it for the mons­ters in this be­nigh­ted pla­ce, and at that it was bet­ter than they de­ser­ved. He'd sus­pect they we­re do­ing this on pur­po­se ex­cept that his pu­nish­ments we­re wor­se than anyt­hing he was en­du­ring.</p>
   <p>    When he fi­nal­ly bum­ped down with a pa­in­ful thud on­to the flo­or of the ca­ve, he ga­ve them all a fi­nal re­min­der of his po­wer over them that ma­de them yelp. The ec­ho­es of fo­ur howls of pa­in re­ver­be­ra­ted long eno­ugh to gi­ve him a fle­eting mo­ment of sa­tis­fac­ti­on. He pic­ked him­self up out of the dust and kic­ked the trash he'd fal­len on out of his way ang­rily be­fo­re sen­ding his ma­ge-light up to il­lu­mi­na­te mo­re of the area.</p>
   <p>    No po­int in lo­oking up to gla­re at them. They we­re go­ne, of co­ur­se, Scut­tling back to the shel­ter of the­ir tents and the­ir fi­re, whe­re they wo­uld stay, pro­bably la­zing abo­ut and trying to find non-existent sup­pli­es of wi­ne among his be­lon­gings. He knew they wo­uldn't le­ave the camp; they we­re mo­re af­ra­id of the fo­rest than they we­re of him. Fo­res­ters they might be, but this wasn't the­ir fo­rest, and they we­re su­pers­ti­ti­o­usly ter­ri­fi­ed not only of the very re­al mons­ters among the tre­es, but the spi­rits they swo­re they'd he­ard in the night. They'd be wa­iting for him when he re­tur­ned, all right… not kno­wing that if his ho­pes we­re ful­fil­led, he wo­uldn't ne­ed them. He'd ha­ve po­wer eno­ugh to blast this pla­ce open or cre­ate a Ga­te ho­me. Or fly, if he cho­se. That wo­uld be no­vel; the­re we­re old le­gends of how the An­ces­tors flew, on the backs of me­tal-be­aked birds with ra­zor-tip­ped wings and scythes for ta­lons, how they wo­uld du­el in the air un­til blo­od fell li­ke warm ra­in on the fa­ces of tho­se be­low. Per­haps the­re we­re const­ructs li­ke that wa­iting he­re…</p>
   <p>    Well! He wasn't fin­ding them stan­ding abo­ut and kic­king trash. Nor was he dis­co­ve­ring just what Kyrti­an was up to if it wasn 't hun­ting re­lics of the An­ces­tors or the Wi­zards he was sup­po­sed to be pur­su­ing.</p>
   <p>    He tur­ned. It was cle­ar eno­ugh whe­re Kyrti­an had go­ne, the path thro­ugh the deb­ris was pla­in eno­ugh for a wo­man to pick out. It was al­so cle­ar that this ca­ve wasn't lit­te­red with just the trash that the wind had blown in. So-Kyrti­an had fo­und the pla­ce whe­re the Gre­at Por­tal had ma­de an ent­ran­ce in­to this world!</p>
   <p>    "By the An­ces­tors!" Ael­mar­kin sa­id alo­ud, and his own vo­ice re­pe­ated his as­to­nish­ment in ec­ho­es that whis­pe­red in the ca­ve as if a crowd mi­mic­ked his surp­ri­se.</p>
   <p>    A skull-an El­ven skull, by the high-arched fo­re­he­ad and the nar­row jaw-lay di­rectly in his path, gla­ring at him, as if da­ring him to pass.</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin sne­ered at it. What mat­ter a few bo­nes? Bo­nes we­re not­hing. Tho­se of the An­ces­tors that di­ed he­re we­ren't An­ces­tors at all, we­re they? They hadn't got­ten the­ir blo­od­li­nes any de­eper in this world than the flo­or of the ca­ve. What mat­ter that Ael­mar­kin's path led over tho­se bo­nes? That way lay his for­tu­ne, and he wasn't go­ing to let the bo­nes of a few de­ad fo­ols stop him.</p>
   <p>    "You," he told the skull, con­temp­tu­o­usly, "are a not­hing. A de­ad-end. You can't even ma­na­ge to block my way."</p>
   <p>    He bro­ught his bo­oted fo­ot down on the skull de­li­be­ra­tely, smas­hing it. It bro­ke with no mo­re ef­fort than dest­ro­ying an egg. His next step to­ok him past the fra­gi­le frag­ments, and he didn't lo­ok back.</p>
   <p>    The de­mi-bar­ri­ca­de at the tun­nel's mo­uth didn't stop him, eit­her; in fact; he to­ok a gre­at de­al of grim ple­asu­re in bul­lying past it, kic­king at the carts and the bo­nes of the le­gen­dary dray-lant­hans and se­e­ing them di­sin­teg­ra­te. Not as much ple­asu­re as he might ha­ve, sin­ce the wrec­ka­ge pretty much fell to bits at a to­uch, but eno­ugh.</p>
   <p>    Some fo­ols might find all this hor­rif­ying. All he felt was mo­re con­tempt for the we­ak­lings who had be­en so af­ra­id of pur­su­it-for of co­ur­se, it co­uld only ha­ve be­en pur­su­it that they fe­ared-that they al­lo­wed the­ir pa­nic to turn what co­uld ha­ve be­en an or­derly pro­ces­si­on in­to a ro­ut. And for what?</p>
   <p>    So the­ir bo­nes co­uld rot on the flo­or of a ca­ve be­fo­re they even saw the light of the­ir new world, that's what.</p>
   <p>    He won­de­red, as he pe­net­ra­ted furt­her in­to the ca­ve-comp­lex, if all of the le­gends of har­mony and co­ope­ra­ti­on we­re so much rot af­ter all. It was ob­vi­o­us from this de­ca­yed cha­os that the­re had be­en pa­nic, figh­ting, but the­re was no sign of wha­te­ver was the ca­use. Un­less, of co­ur­se, the An­ces­tors had bro­ught the ca­use with them…</p>
   <p>    What if they'd be­gun figh­ting amongst each ot­her for as­cen­dancy as so­on as they got sa­fely to the ot­her si­de?</p>
   <p>    That wo­uld cer­ta­inly exp­la­in the ro­ut-</p>
   <p>    In fact, such an exp­la­na­ti­on ma­de mo­re sen­se than the of­fi­ci­al ver­si­on of the Cros­sing.</p>
   <p>    Suppose, just sup­po­se, that not all of the An­ces­tors had gi­ven everyt­hing they had to the cre­ati­on of the Gre­at Por­tal? That was what he wo­uld ha­ve do­ne, co­me down to it. Now, sup­po­se that fac­ti­on-wit­hin-a-fac­ti­on had then tur­ned on the rest, when they we­re out of ma­gic, dep­le­ted, vul­ne­rab­le?</p>
   <p>    He grin­ned sa­va­gely, kic­king a bit of deb­ris out of the way. Of co­ur­se-that was what must ha­ve hap­pe­ned! It exp­la­ined all of this, and exp­la­ined why no one had ever co­me back he­re un­til the sec­ret of just whe­re the Por­tal was had be­en lost to me­mory. Af­ter all, tho­se cle­ver bas­tards who'd won wo­uldn't want to chan­ce co­ming upon a sur­vi­vor amid the wrec­ka­ge, or chan­ce on so­me­one un­co­ve­ring the re­al ver­si­on of what had hap­pe­ned! And be­si­des, things had be­en hard eno­ugh on tho­se who sur­vi­ved, cre­ating the­ir strong­holds, wa­iting to see what pe­rils lur­ked in this new world and trying to de­fend aga­inst wha­te­ver might co­me.</p>
   <p>    Then, of co­ur­se, the An­ces­tors had dis­co­ve­red the hu­mans, and re­ali­zed they didn't ne­ed const­ructs when they co­uld ha­ve sla­ves ins­te­ad, sla­ves that didn't ne­ed re­pa­irs, co­uld bre­ed the­ir own rep­la­ce­ments, and co­uld be cont­rol­led with a ba­re mi­ni­mum of ma­gic.</p>
   <p>    Proper con­ser­va­ti­on of re­so­ur­ces, that. It spo­ke well for the cle­ver­ness of the El­ven­lords who had sur­vi­ved to be­co­me his An­ces­tors. Cle­ver, cle­ver fel­lows in­de­ed; they wo­uld be pro­ud of him now, who had ret­ra­ced the­ir fo­ots­teps to re­dis­co­ver the sec­rets of the­ir po­wer and ta­ke what right­ful­ly be­lon­ged to him.</p>
   <p>    Of co­ur­se, that wo­uld only be the be­gin­ning. On­ce he had ta­ken Kyrti­an's es­ta­tes, he'd con­si­der his next mo­ves. The­re we­re, af­ter all, many pos­si­bi­li­ti­es for the fu­tu­re, and everyt­hing wo­uld de­pend on just what he le­ar­ned he­re. Only one thing was cer­ta­in; Ael­mar­kin, and not Kyrti­an, wo­uld be the one to ha­ve the be­ne­fit of wha­te­ver lay he­re.</p>
   <p>    And what was mo­re, Kyrti­an wo­uldn't be co­ming out of he­re at all if Ael­mar­kin had anyt­hing to say abo­ut it.</p>
   <p>    At le­ast, not ali­ve.</p>

   <p>    Lynder to­ok off at a run af­ter Kyrti­an, his fe­et slap­ping on the rock flo­or of the ca­ve and kic­king up puffs of dust, but Sha­na and Ke­man he­si­ta­ted, exc­han­ging first a glan­ce, then a gu­ar­ded tho­ught.</p>
   <p>    ;I ha­ve a fe­eling that so­met­hing's abo­ut to go hor­ribly wrong,: Sha­na be­gan, not at all he­si­tant to lo­ok li­ke a fo­ol- if in­de­ed she did-in front of her fos­ter-brot­her. Af­ter all, he'd se­en her do and say stu­pid things plenty of ti­mes in the past.</p>
   <p>    But Ke­man nod­ded, con­fir­ming her ap­pre­hen­si­ons-which, of co­ur­se, only ma­de them wor­se.:So do I. It's not just that hum. The­re's so­met­hing down he­re, as­le­ep may­be, and I don't want to dis­turb it.: He pa­used, and his eyes flic­ked to one si­de.:Fi­re and Ra­in! Lo­ok at the ma­ge-lights!:</p>
   <p>    Shana bit her lip, when she fol­lo­wed his di­rec­ti­on and re­ali­zed that Kyrti­an's ma­ge-lights we­re slowly pul­sing, wa­xing and wa­ning in strength ever so slightly and very slowly. Had Kyrti­an no­ti­ced? Wo­uld he?</p>
   <p>    :I think so­met­hing's dra­ining them a lit­tle at a ti­me,: Ke­man con­ti­nu­ed.:Then Kyrti­an inc­re­ases the po­wer to them witk­cut thin­king abo­ut it, and it all be­gins aga­in. And I don't think it wo­uld be a go­od idea to use any stron­ger ma­gic in he­re. It might… wa­ke so­met­hing up.:</p>
   <p>    Wake so­met­hing up… so he felt it too. The sen­se of pre­sen­ce was stron­ger now, alt­ho­ugh the dro­ning in the back of her mind was not.:We 'd bet­ter fol­low Kyrti­an, then,: she sa­id re­luc­tantly.</p>
   <p>    They fol­lo­wed his tracks in the dust ac­ross the flo­or of the ca­ve, pas­sing among the odd and ar­ti­cu­la­ted sha­pes of me­tal and glass and stran­ger subs­tan­ces. They lo­omed, the­se obj­ects.</p>
   <p>    They bul­ked abo­ve Sha­na's he­ad, exu­ding un­subt­le me­na­ce. Alt­ho­ugh how that was pos­sib­le wit­ho­ut pos­ses­sing eyes or fa­ces…</p>
   <p>    She felt her skin flinc­hing away from them, no­ting a few mo­ments la­ter that the const­ructs we­re not ar­ran­ged in qu­ite the or­derly fas­hi­on that they had first tho­ught.</p>
   <p>    Nor we­re they un­da­ma­ged.</p>
   <p>    Deep in the mid­dle of the pack, they pas­sed two tang­led to­get­her, as if they'd blun­de­red in­to each ot­her. Then ca­me one that had be­en smas­hed be­ne­ath a mas­si­ve rock, per­haps de­tac­hed from the ro­of of the ca­vern. Then anot­her, fal­len over on its si­de.</p>
   <p>    Then one that lo­oked-mel­ted? Yes, all down one si­de the const­ruct sag­ged, and the­re we­re pla­ces along the le­ading ed­ges whe­re the thing lo­oked li­ke but­ter that had be­gun to run, then har­de­ned aga­in.</p>
   <p>    A low mur­mur of vo­ices from the ot­her si­de of the thing ga­ve a clue to Kyrti­an's whe­re­abo­uts, but the­re was so­met­hing harsh and des­pe­ra­tely un­hap­py in that mur­mur that ma­de them both slow the­ir pa­ces and ed­ge, with gre­at ca­re, aro­und the cor­ner of it.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian sto­od fa­cing the rock wall of the ca­ve, every musc­le as ri­gid as the rock he fa­ced, and for a mo­ment, all that Sha­na co­uld un­ders­tand was that the rock lo­oked as if it had mel­ted li­ke but­ter in the sun, just as the me­tal of the const­ruct had.</p>
   <p>    Then, slowly, her mind en­com­pas­sed the sha­pe in the rock. In the rock, li­ke so­me obs­ce­ne bas-re­li­ef, li­ke a hap­less in­sect co­ated in wax and pre­ser­ved for all ti­me, li­ke a fancy pastry en­ro­bed in a thin gla­zed shell. Li­ke, most hor­ribly of all, li­ke so­met­hing ca­ught in an ice-storm, pre­ser­ved per­fectly be­ne­ath a thin she­ath of ice that rep­li­ca­ted every de­ta­il of the no-lon­ger-li­ving thing.</p>
   <p>    There was a man, an El­ven­lord, em­bed­ded in the sa­tiny-smo­oth, mel­ted and re-so­li­di­fi­ed rock. Not car­ved-not un­less the­re had be­en a sculp­tor wor­king he­re who was ut­terly mad. Not with the exp­res­si­on of ut­ter, blin­ding ter­ror that she saw on the su­bj­ect's vi­sa­ge.</p>
   <p>    Shana co­uld not see Lord Kyrti­an's fa­ce, and for that, she was pro­fo­undly glad. The elo­qu­ent li­ne of his back­bo­ne told her mo­re than eno­ugh-too much, truth be told.</p>
   <p>    Desperately un­hap­py? That was too ta­me. This was a man who sho­uld, by all rights, bre­ak in­to a howl of des­pa­ir at any mo­ment.</p>
   <p>    This co­uld only be Kyrti­an's fat­her. Bad eno­ugh to find bo­nes and only won­der at how he had pe­ris­hed-this was in­fi­ni­tely wor­se, the mo­ment of de­ath ca­ught and held on show for all ti­me.</p>
   <p>    She didn't know Kyrti­an well eno­ugh to of­fer com­fort, but he cle­arly ne­eded it at the mo­ment, and just as cle­arly wo­uld not ac­cept it from an­yo­ne stan­ding abo­ut him now. She co­uld hardly bla­me him; if she had be­en se­arc­hing for Ala­ra all the­se ye­ars only to find her li­ke this-</p>
   <p>    All of them sto­od in awk­ward si­len­ce, a si­len­ce that stretc­hed on and on un­til it be­ca­me unen­du­rab­le. Sha­na's ner­ves shri­eked un­der the stra­in of wa­iting, and lon­ged for so­me­one, an­yo­ne, to bre­ak it-so long as it wasn't her. Kyrti­an co­uld not pos­sibly be­ar this-no one co­uld!</p>
   <p>    But it was Kyrti­an him­self who fi­nal­ly did so, and with ut­terly unex­pec­ted words.</p>
   <p>    "Light the lan­terns," he sa­id, the words emer­ging as a strang­led cro­ak, but cle­ar eno­ugh for all that.</p>
   <p>    "M-m-my lord?" Lynder stam­me­red, wit­ho­ut comp­re­hen­si­on.</p>
   <p>    "Light the lan­terns. I'm go­ing to kill the ma­ge-lights. So­met­hing's fe­eding on them and I don't want to gi­ve it anyt­hing mo­re-"</p>
   <p>    He didn't fi­nish the sen­ten­ce, but with that in front of them, he didn't ha­ve to. Lynder and the ot­her has­te­ned to obey his or­der, bre­aking out the cand­les, the oil, and the lan­terns, and the mo­ment that the first wick was kind­led, Kyrti­an ex­tin­gu­is­hed his ma­ge-lights comp­le­tely.</p>
   <p>    This, of co­ur­se, left them hud­dling aro­und a lan­tern that in no way ga­ve a frac­ti­on of the light that the ma­ge-lights had, whi­le the ot­hers has­te­ned to light the rest of the wicks with a spill kind­led on the first. Sha­na was just glad that Kyrti­an had had the fo­re­sight to or­der lan­terns bro­ught in the first pla­ce-and that even in the midst of a gri­ef she co­uldn't even be­gin to un­ders­tand, he hadn't lost him­self to mo­ur­ning, mad­ness, or both.</p>
   <p>    She hur­ri­ed for­ward to help the ot­hers; the lamps we­re kept dry un­til ne­eded, so she fil­led them whi­le the ot­hers lit them and set the trans­pa­rent chim­neys in pla­ce to pro­tect them from drafts. When she lo­oked over at him, Kyrti­an still hadn't mo­ved, ex­cept to pla­ce one hand on the bre­ast of that ter­rib­le fi­gu­re in the wall.</p>
   <p>    She still co­uldn't see his fa­ce. She still didn't want to.</p>
   <p>    But she wis­hed with all her so­ul that he wo­uld we­ep.</p>
   <p>    Triana was surp­ri­sed when the glow of ma­ge-lights ahe­ad of her win­ked out.</p>
   <p>    She dim­med her own light in auto­ma­tic res­pon­se, lest it be no­ti­ced. Now the­re was ba­rely eno­ugh light co­ming from her lit­tle me­tal co­ne to let her see her way wit­ho­ut stumb­ling, and she used one hand on the ca­ve wall to ste­ady her­self as she crept along. Why had Kyrti­an do­used his lights?</p>
   <p>    Then, as a fa­int yel­low glow ca­me from the ope­ning ahe­ad of her, she un­ders­to­od that alt­ho­ugh he had do­used his lights, he wasn't in dark­ness. The light co­ming from ahe­ad was po­or and we­ak, and she won­de­red if so­me di­sas­ter had be­fal­len Kyrti­an, or his men, to ma­ke him lo­se cont­rol of his ma­ge-lights.</p>
   <p>    The fe­eling of un­fo­cu­sed hor­ror that had stal­ked her from the mo­ment that she en­te­red this pla­ce was­hed over her in re­do­ub­led strength. It was only by stop­ping long eno­ugh to ta­ke a few de­ep bre­aths and swal­low a sip of wa­ter from a flask at her belt to ease her fe­ar-dri­ed mo­uth that she for­ced her­self to go on. Wha­te­ver was out the­re hadn't de­vo­ured Kyrti­an yet, or whe­re wo­uld the light be co­ming from?</p>
   <p>    As her pul­se po­un­ded in her temp­les and her hands grew cold, she re­ac­hed the mo­uth of the next ca­ve, and as she ex­tin­gu­is­hed her own ma­ge-light lest it bet­ray her, at last she he­ard vo­ices. One of them was Kyrti­an's, with a harsh, gra­ting to­ne to it she'd ne­ver he­ard be­fo­re, but the low to­ne and the ec­ho­es ma­de it im­pos­sib­le to un­ders­tand what he and the ot­hers with him we­re sa­ying. Still, he was tal­king, and he wo­uldn't be do­ing that if so­met­hing had at­tac­ked him. She won­de­red wildly for a mo­ment if he was tal­king to so­met­hing that be­lon­ged he­re-</p>
   <p>    But no. That didn't ma­ke any sen­se. The­re had be­en no signs of li­fe he­re at all, not even bats, so what co­uld such a thing li­ve on? And the­re we­re no tracks in the dust ex­cept Kyrti­an's pe­op­le, so not­hing was go­ing in­to or out of this ca­ve-comp­lex.</p>
   <p>    In the flic­ke­ring and un­cer­ta­in light she ba­rely ma­de out the bulky sha­pes of hu­ge obj­ects the si­ze of gar­den sheds and lar­ger ran­ged in ut­terly still and si­lent ranks in front of her. Gre­at hul­king sha­pes-fro­zen in­to im­mo­bi­lity now, but so­me­how not de­ad; they cro­uc­hed, wa­iting, watc­hing. And at the ed­ge of her vi­si­on, the arch of the Gre­at Por­tal-for that was all that the so­aring arc of gre­enish-black at the re­ar of the ca­ve co­uld be-bro­oding over them all. Mo­ving sha­dows of men per­for­med an in­comp­re­hen­sib­le pan­to­mi­me aga­inst the right-hand wall, whe­re lan­terns must be. The­re was a whis­per of ac­rid scent to the air he­re, a fa­int tas­te of me­tal and the fla­vor of light­ning.</p>
   <p>    Everything ins­tinc­ti­ve in her scre­amed to go back, for­get what she saw and go, flee, now. This was not­hing li­ke what she had ex­pec­ted-the­re was so­met­hing hor­ribly wrong he­re, and if she sta­yed she'd find out what it was. All of tho­se things out the­re, sta­ring wit­ho­ut eyes, wa­iting for just the right trig­ger, the right ac­ti­on to set them free…</p>
   <p>    But… but if she left, she wo­uld le­ave empty-han­ded. Only Kyrti­an wo­uld know the sec­rets that lay he­re. And that was in­sup­por­tab­le.</p>
   <p>    Will tri­ump­hed over ins­tinct, and she for­ced her­self to go on. She de­ci­ded at that mo­ment to ap­pro­ach the pla­ce whe­re Kyrti­an and his pe­op­le we­re by ta­king the long way aro­und the ed­ge of the ca­vern, drop­ping down from the led­ge as si­lently as pos­sib­le, then ma­king her way aro­und the ca­vern with one hand outst­retc­hed aga­inst the rock wall to gu­ide her. She wo­uld pass by the Gre­at Por­tal, and that alo­ne might hold some use­ful in­for­ma­ti­on. And she wo­uldn't ha­ve to walk among tho­se-things.</p>
   <p>    The Gre­at Por­tal-it had enab­led the An­ces­tors to tra­vel from anot­her world. Per­haps it still held eno­ugh ma­gic to ta­ke her ho­me-after all, so­me of the ol­dest Por­tals co­uld be used to go anyw­he­re that one held a key, and she had the Pri­me Key to her own Por­tal in the form of the sig­net ring on her right hand. If that was true, then she wasn't trap­ped he­re; if anyt­hing went wrong, she co­uld es­ca­pe in a he­art­be­at!</p>
   <p>    That tho­ught, when it oc­cur­red to her, bro­ught a sud­den ease of her fe­ar that al­most ma­de her stag­ger, and she ca­ught her­self with one hand on the ca­vern wall. Re­li­ef suf­fu­sed her, ma­king her a lit­tle light­he­aded. The hul­king sha­pes of the An­ces­tors' chat­tels no lon­ger se­emed to sta­re at her with in­sen­sa­te me­na­ce. They we­re just-things. Old, de­ad things. No mat­ter what Kyrti­an had fo­und, or tho­ught he had fo­und, the­se re­lics co­uldn't thre­aten anyt­hing or an­yo­ne-if they ever had. Her ima­gi­na­ti­on had run away with her, and she was as bad as any nur­sery-bo­und child in co­nj­uring up night­ma­res for her­self.</p>
   <p>    Whatever had sla­ugh­te­red all tho­se pe­op­le back in the ma­in ca­ve co­uldn't ha­ve co­me from he­re, any­way. When the Por­tal clo­sed, the const­ructs had all di­ed. Ever­yo­ne knew that. It was in every ver­si­on of the Cros­sing that she had ever re­ad. That was why it had be­en so im­por­tant that the An­ces­tors find or cre­ate a so­ur­ce of sla­ve-la­bor, sin­ce they no lon­ger had the­ir const­ructs to do the­ir work for them.</p>
   <p>    With re­ne­wed con­fi­den­ce, and a pu­rely in­ter­nal la­ugh of scorn at her own fo­olish­ness, she con­ti­nu­ed on, fe­eling for each step as she to­ok it, sin­ce she co­uld no lon­ger see whe­re she was go­ing. And all the whi­le, she stra­ined her ears for so­me hint of what Kyrti­an was sa­ying, watc­hing the enor­mo­us sha­dows cast on the op­po­si­te wall by the wa­ve­ring light of his lamps mo­ving in a gi­gan­tic pup­pet-play.</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin do­used his ma­ge-light with a cur­se when he re­ali­zed that the fa­int glow ahe­ad of him must be ca­used by Kyrti­an's people in the next ca­ve. He'd fi­nal­ly ca­ught up with them- only to co­me pe­ri­lo­usly clo­se to blun­de­ring in­to them. He swo­re at him­self for be­ing so stu­pid-how co­uld he ha­ve let so­met­hing that simp­le catch him? He only ho­ped that no­ne of them we­re bright eno­ugh to ha­ve no­ti­ced his light be­hind them.</p>
   <p>    The ro­ugh circ­le of light ahe­ad se­emed aw­ful­ly dim-and very yel­low. Odd, that. Why wo­uld Kyrti­an go out of his way to cre­ate a yel­low light when the na­tu­ral blue-whi­te of ma­ge-lights was so much bet­ter and tru­er?</p>
   <p>    Then aga­in, it was Kyrti­an. It might be fi­re­light; he might ha­ve fo­und what he was lo­oking for and de­ci­ded to camp. It might be lamp­light, be­ca­use he wasn 't as go­od a ma­ge as Ael-mar­kin had tho­ught and he was run­ning out of energy to ke­ep the ma­ge-lights go­ing. He was per­fectly ca­pab­le of do­ing wit­ho­ut ma­ge-light al­to­get­her, for so­me ot­her pe­cu­li­ar re­ason of his own.</p>
   <p>    It was only when Ael­mar­kin ac­tu­al­ly re­ac­hed the mo­uth of the next ca­vern and only just sa­ved him­self from tumb­ling over the ed­ge that he un­ders­to­od that the lights we­re in­de­ed lan­terns, and that Kyrti­an had elec­ted to use them ins­te­ad of ma­ge-lights, and he cur­sed aga­in (but only in his he­ad) when that simp­le fact ca­me ne­ar to un­do­ing him.</p>
   <p>    It was a very ne­ar thing; one mo­ment, he was easing him­self along the ca­vern, and the next, his qu­es­ting fo­ot met empty air, and un­for­tu­na­tely, he had al­re­ady trus­ted so­me we­ight to it, not an­ti­ci­pa­ting that the­re wo­uld be a drop-off. Ael­mar­kin te­ete­red on the brink for a he­art-stop­ping mo­ment be­fo­re his fla­iling hand ca­ught the ed­ge of the wall and he was ab­le to ste­ady him­self.</p>
   <p>    He bur­ned the air with a flurry of men­tal cur­ses be­fo­re his he­art stop­ped ra­cing and he was ab­le to re­al­ly lo­ok at what lay be­low him. But then-oh then, his he­art ra­ced for an en­ti­rely dif­fe­rent re­ason!</p>
   <p>    There be­low him, ran­ked and wa­iting li­ke so many pla­cid, sle­eping bul­locks, we­re the an­ci­ent const­ructs that the An­ces­tors had bro­ught with them. Row upon row of them, wa­iting for the pro­per to­uch to bring them ali­ve and call them to ser­vi­ce.</p>
   <p>    His to­uch. Ne­ver do­ubt it. He co­uld hardly wa­it to get down among them! What ne­ed wo­uld he ha­ve of sla­ves or gla­di­ators or even ar­mi­es with the­se po­wer­ful cre­ati­ons at his com­mand?</p>
   <p>    His mo­uth go­ne sud­denly dry with an­ti­ci­pa­ti­on, he as­cer­ta­ined that the drop was now­he­re ne­ar as long as he'd tho­ught, and eased him­self bel­ly-down over the ed­ge. The rock scra­ped him even thro­ugh the to­ugh le­at­her of his hun­ting-tu­nic, but he hardly felt it in his has­te to get down among tho­se things out of anot­her world and ti­me.</p>
   <p>    Besides, he ne­eded to get un­der co­ver, in ca­se one of Kyrt-ian's sla­ves ca­me sno­oping. It wo­uld be a di­sas­ter to co­me this far and then be trip­ped up by one of Kyrti­an's wretc­hed sla­ves.</p>
   <p>    He felt bet­ter with the bulk of se­ve­ral of the things bet­we­en him­self and Kyrti­an's lamps. Sa­fe eno­ugh to kind­le a very, very dim hand-light of his own, one which co­uld be hid­den in his fist and used only, held clo­se to the me­tal si­des of the const­ructs, to see if he co­uld de­cip­her any of the an­ci­ent script. He ho­ped to find inst­ruc­ti­ons the­re-su­rely not ever­yo­ne who was as­ked to cont­rol the things in the past ac­tu­al­ly le­ar­ned how to do so be­fo­re at­temp­ting to ope­ra­te them! Fa­iling that, he ho­ped for la­bels, or so­me evo­ca­ti­ve na­me that wo­uld tell him what the things we­re used for.</p>
   <p>    But as he mo­ved si­lently from one hu­ge bulk to the next, brus­hing off a li­te­ral co­at of dust that fell to the gro­und in a she­et, he was di­sap­po­in­ted. Tho­ugh he lo­oked as high as he co­uld re­ach, inst­ruc­ti­ons the­re we­re no­ne; nor na­mes, eit­her- at le­ast not on the si­des that he exa­mi­ned. He didn't da­re mo­ve to the si­de fa­cing Kyrti­an's lamps; bad eno­ugh that he was a mo­ving sha­dow among un­mo­ving ones! The mur­mur of vo­ices sug­ges­ted that all of Kyrti­an's pe­op­le we­re still with him, but was by no me­ans a trust­worthy way of tel­ling for cer­ta­in.</p>
   <p>    He cur­sed the An­ces­tors now-how stu­pid co­uld one be, to neg­lect to le­ave inst­ruc­ti­ons for the uni­ni­ti­ated? Un­less tho­se inst­ruc­ti­ons had be­en in one of the bo­oks back in the ma­in ca­ve, bo­oks that crumb­led at a to­uch…</p>
   <p>    For a mo­ment, he des­pa­ired. But then ca­me a stro­ke of luck so inc­re­dib­le he hardly da­red be­li­eve it.</p>
   <p>    As he clo­sed his fist aro­und his hand-light in di­sap­po­int­ment at-aga­in-fin­ding not­hing, he ca­ught a fu­gi­ti­ve hint of glo­wing gre­en out of the co­mer of his eye.</p>
   <p>    He tur­ned, with pa­in­ful slow­ness, to his left, and for a mo­ment felt not­hing but a wash of di­sap­po­int­ment when the­re didn't se­em to be anyt­hing the­re ex­cept anot­her const­ruct, and this one ut­terly wit­ho­ut anyt­hing li­ke wri­ting on the si­de. It did ha­ve a set of bla­des and claws that sug­ges­ted war­li­ke in­ten­ti­ons, not that kno­wing its pur­po­se wo­uld do him any go­od un­less he co­uld get it mo­ving, which he ob­vi­o­usly co­uldn 't wit­ho­ut inst­ruc­ti­ons. But then as he sta­red, his eyes adj­us­ted, and he saw it.</p>
   <p>    A fa­int glow of gre­en, in the midst of the blank si­de of the const­ruct, exactly li­ke the glow of an ac­ti­va­ted Elf-sto­ne.</p>
   <p>    He sid­led up to the thing, sta­ying in the sha­dows, and qu­es­ted over it with a fin­ger. Only the glow and a subt­le chan­ge in tex­tu­re from me­tal to sto­ne in­for­med him that the thing was the­re at all! It had be­en in­set flush with the sur­fa­ce, and in the dim il­lu­mi­na­ti­on from the hand-light, he wo­uldn't ha­ve se­en it ex­cept for the glow. It was an Elf-sto­ne, or so­met­hing very li­ke one. And when he ope­ned his fist to bring his hand-light up to it-the hand-light dim­med, and the gre­en glow brigh­te­ned.</p>
   <p>    He co­uld ha­ve pum­me­led him­self for stu­pi­dity. Of co­ur­se! Why wo­uld you ne­ed inst­ruc­ti­ons to ma­na­ge one of the­se things? All you ne­eded was the Elf-sto­ne, both to po­wer it and to cont­rol it! And, of co­ur­se, that was why all of the things had col­lap­sed in­to iner­tia when the Gre­at Por­tal clo­sed! The ma­gic po­we­ring them that was a part of the Aet­her of Eve­lon ran out, and the El­ven­lords who'd bu­ilt and sus­ta­ined the Por­tal had not­hing left to supply them! Ut­ter simp­li­city, but, of co­ur­se, the Les­ser El­ven­lords who'd held back the­ir own po­wer eit­her hadn't known how the const­ructs wor­ked, or had be­en so busy eli­mi­na­ting the­ir dan­ge­ro­us ri­vals that they hadn't bot­he­red to try to le­arn to use the things!</p>
   <p>    Or per­haps they had be­en so af­ra­id of pur­su­it that they just aban­do­ned the bru­tes.</p>
   <p>    Or-well, it didn't mat­ter. The po­int was, they had be­en abandoned and they we­re the­re for the ta­king and now Ael-mar­kin knew how to ta­ke and use them!</p>
   <p>    It co­uldn't be any simp­ler. And it didn't mat­ter what this be­he­moth was ori­gi­nal­ly in­ten­ded to do, eit­her. It was big, it had to be bru­tal­ly strong, and it was cer­ta­inly bru­tal­ly he­avy. It co­uld kill Kyrti­an simply by step­ping on him.</p>
   <p>    Aelmarkin smot­he­red a howl of glee, and pla­ced the hand hol­ding his hand-light aga­inst the Elf-sto­ne em­bed­ded in the const­ruct's si­de. It suc­ked in the po­wer gre­edily. The hand-light va­nis­hed.</p>
   <p>    And then-Ael­mar­kin felt it wa­ke and-lo­ok for mo­re. And felt its fi­er­ce con­cent­ra­ti­on fo­cus on him.</p>
   <p>    He tri­ed to pull his hand away in a flash of alarm.</p>
   <p>    But by then, of co­ur­se, it was al­re­ady too la­te.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian had fi­nal­ly al­lo­wed Lynder and Ke­man to le­ad him to a se­at on a ne­arby outc­rop of rock. He felt-hol­low. And ex­ha­us­ted. As if he had wept for a ye­ar, alt­ho­ugh he was dry-eyed.</p>
   <p>    At le­ast mot­her isn 't he­re. That was all he co­uld think of. At le­ast she can't see-this. I don't think she co­uld be­ar it. I think she 'd go mad.</p>
   <p>    "No, don't try to chip-it out," he sa­id with dif­fi­culty in ans­wer to Lynder's qu­es­ti­on. "I don't ever want Lady Lydi­ell to see him. Not li­ke that, any­way. May­be we can find a way to co­ver him over-"</p>
   <p>    He shud­de­red, a spasm of a thing that left him swe­ating and sha­king. What must ha­ve hap­pe­ned? He must ha­ve so­me­how wa­ke­ned one of tho­se-things. May­be it fed off his ma­ge-lights, and he didn 't re­ali­ze what was hap­pe­ning. He must ha­ve be­en so ex­ci­ted-too ex­ci­ted to think cle­arly.</p>
   <p>    He bu­ri­ed his he­ad in his hands, shud­de­ring all over, in spasms he co­uldn't cont­rol. He wan­ted to howl, to ra­il at fa­te, and abo­ve all things, to we­ep. Why co­uldn't he we­ep?</p>
   <p>    Which one of the­se hulks had do­ne the de­ed? He wan­ted to know that, sud­denly, with a fi­er­ce an­ger that to­ok him and left him sha­king. That, abo­ve all, he had to find out! He'd find the thing and ta­ke it to bits with his ba­re hands, and grind the bits to dust and scat­ter the dust over the bar­ren de­sert, by the An­ces­tors, he wo­uld!</p>
   <p>    He sto­od up, still sha­king, and tur­ned to­wards them-just in ti­me to see one of them slowly ri­sing up from among its fel­lows, to­we­ring hig­her and hig­her, with so­met­hing doll-li­ke and scre­aming clenc­hed in one fe­ar­so­me claw.</p>

   <p>    Fear struck ti­nes of ice de­ep in­to his gut, but Kyrti­an had nots­pent all the­se ye­ars tra­ining for bat­tle in va­in. Be­fo­re the thing had fi­nis­hed stan­ding, he bar­ked an or­der, which, if his vo­ice crac­ked, was no­net­he­less lo­ud eno­ugh and aut­ho­ri­ta­ti­ve eno­ugh that ever­yo­ne re­ac­ted.</p>
   <p>    "Take co­ver!" he sho­uted, even whi­le he him­self was di­ving for shel­ter be­ne­ath the slo­ping front of the ne­arest const­ruct.</p>
   <p>    Even Lynder and Ho­bie, tho­ugh they had not ac­tu­al­ly fo­ught with Kyrti­an's tro­ops aga­inst the Yo­ung Lords, had tra­ined long and hard with all of Kyrti­an's men and re­ac­ted im­me­di­ately to his bar­ked or­der. By the ti­me the const­ruct had got­ten to its full he­ight, Kyrti­an, Lynder and Ho­bie we­re all out of its fi­eld of vi­si­on-or so he ho­ped-under a slo­pe of me­tal that cast a de­ep, black sha­dow.</p>
   <p>    And I only ho­pe this thing do­esn't de­ci­de to co­me ali­ve, too-he tho­ught, squ­e­ezing as far out of sight as he co­uld, tho­ugh his skin shrank from con­tact with the chill and slightly gre­asy me­tal.</p>
   <p>    When they had all tuc­ked in and go­ne im­mo­bi­le, he ris­ked a glan­ce at the wall and the half-circ­le of lan­terns. Sha­na and Ke-man we­re now­he­re in sight, but at le­ast they we­re now­he­re in his li­ne-of-sight. He had to ho­pe that if he co­uldn't see them, ne­it­her co­uld the const­ruct. If it "saw," that is. It might use ot­her sen­ses…</p>
   <p>    "Now what?" Lynder his­sed in­to Kyrti­an's ear. He so­un­ded as des­pe­ra­te as Kyrti­an felt.</p>
   <p>    "I'm thin­king!" he his­sed back. He wasn't wor­ri­ed abo­ut that thing he­aring them; the vic­tim it had in its claw was ma­king eno­ugh no­ise to co­ver just abo­ut anyt­hing. The scre­aming was hor­rib­le, but wor­se was the fe­eling that he knew the tor­tu­red vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    The vic­tim-An El­ven­lord; he'd se­en eno­ugh in that mo­ment of hor­ror to know it wasn't a hu­man. But who? Who co­uld ha­ve fol­lo­wed him he­re, and why? Not any of Lord Kyndreth's pe­op­le, sin­ce no­ne of them knew whe­re he was go­ing, pre­ci­sely, and su­rely no­ne of his own.</p>
   <p>    The vic­tim blub­be­red bet­we­en the scre­ams, in­co­he­rent in his ter­ror. It was sic­ke­ning to lis­ten to.</p>
   <p>    No, no­ne of them wo­uld ha­ve tra­iled af­ter me, simply be­ca­use no­ne of them co­uld ha­ve. They 're all to­tal­ly un­su­ited to tram­ping abo­ut in the wil­der­ness, thank the An­ces­tors.</p>
   <p>    As frigh­te­ning as the scre­ams was the si­len­ce be­ne­ath it. The const­ruct ma­de no so­und at all.</p>
   <p>    The only per­son li­kely to ha­ve fol­lo­wed him, and with the skills to do so, wo­uld ha­ve be­en Gel, and it cer­ta­inly wasn't Gel in that mons­ter's claw!</p>
   <p>    Yet the vo­ice was fa­mi­li­ar.</p>
   <p>    Who then? He stra­ined to ma­ke out anyt­hing in the scre­ams and bab­bling to gi­ve him a clue, as his mo­uth dri­ed with fe­ar and his in­si­des se­emed to turn to wa­ter. An enemy, then? But what enemy wo­uld ha­ve fol­lo­wed him on what was sup­po­sed to be a fa­irly dan­ge­ro­us mis­si­on to hunt out Wi­zards? An enemy lo­oking for so­met­hing to disc­re­dit him with-per­haps? An enemy plan­ning to find, or plant, so­met­hing to Kyrti­an's harm. Or even an enemy ho­ping to ar­ran­ge an "acci­dent" out he­re whe­re the­re wo­uld be no wit­nes­ses? That was so­met­hing that Ael­mar­kin-</p>
   <p>    Ancestors! he tho­ught, stun­ned, now he­aring what was fa­mi­li­ar in tho­se scre­ams and wa­ils ec­ho­ing ac­ross the ca­vern. It's Ael­mar­kin!</p>
   <p>    That Ael­mar­kin ha­ted him eno­ugh to try to disc­re­dit or mur­der him was no surp­ri­se, but that he'd ac­tu­al­ly da­re the wil­derness to do so was so­met­hing so out-of-cha­rac­ter that he co­uldn't be­ra­te him­self for not thin­king of it be­fo­re. His worst enemy-</p>
   <p>    Who has ma­na­ged to blun­der in­to this.</p>
   <p>    Fortunately, he did not ha­ve the ti­me to bat­tle his cons­ci­en­ce over whet­her or not to at­tempt a res­cue; the­re was a whi­ne, and a flash of light swe­eping ac­ross the ca­ve flo­or, and the scre­ams cut off with dre­ad­ful fi­na­lity. The three shel­te­ring be­ne­ath the still (thank­ful­ly!) li­fe­less const­ruct be­ca­me very qu­i­et, hardly da­ring to bre­at­he, as si­len­ce des­cen­ded with le­aden sud­den­ness.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian fo­ught down the ur­ge to bolt for the mo­uth of the ca­ve that had bro­ught them he­re. Who knew what sort of we­apons this thing had?</p>
   <p>    No ma­gic, Kyrti­an de­ci­ded. Es­pe­ci­al­ly not le­vin-bolts. If this mons­ter was what had be­en fe­eding on his ma­ge-lights and dra­ining them, what sort of po­wer wo­uld a le­vin-bolt gi­ve it? Or wor­se-what if anot­her of the const­ructs ab­sor­bed the po­wer and ca­me awa­ke? He was fa­irly cer­ta­in that this one wasn't the one that had got­ten his fat­her-tho­ugh his fat­her must cer­ta­inly ha­ve awa­ke­ned one or anot­her of the be­he­moths, pro­bably by using ma­ge-lights. This one was now a pro­ven kil­ler; they cer­ta­inly didn't ne­ed to awa­ken a se­cond!</p>
   <p>    So what co­uld he use aga­inst this mons­ter, if not ma­gic?</p>
   <p>    Not bows and ar­rows. Not swords. And we 've pre­ci­o­us lit­tle el­se.</p>
   <p>    There was a whir, a cre­aking of me­tal, and sud­denly so­met­hing li­ke an enor­mo­us up­tur­ned bowl at­tac­hed to three me­tal struts slam­med down on­to the sto­ne whe­re he and his men had just be­en, sen­ding up a clo­ud of dust. A se­cond fol­lo­wed the first, smas­hing one of the lan­terns.</p>
   <p>    A mo­ment la­ter, Ael­mar­kin's limp body drop­ped down be­si­de the se­cond disk. The­re was no mis­ta­ke, now that Kyrti­an co­uld see the ter­ror-twis­ted fe­atu­res. It was Ael­mar­kin, all right. And the­re was no do­ubt in his mind that his co­usin was qu­ite, qu­ite de­ad. Not when his back­bo­ne bent that far, or at that ang­le.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian fro­ze; al­most di­rectly abo­ve them, he he­ard that pe­cu­li­ar whi­ning aga­in. He co­uldn't see anyt­hing but tho­se two metal legs, but his ima­gi­na­ti­on pa­in­ted a pic­tu­re of the const­ruct so­me­how tur­ning the top part of it­self to pe­er down at the gro­und be­low, se­arc­hing for them. He felt li­ke a mo­use hi­ding in a log in a fi­eld, watc­hing the legs of a cat. Only he had no idea just what ar­ca­ne sen­ses this mons­ter was using to lo­ok for them.</p>
   <p>    And as if to re­in­for­ce that ima­gi­nary ima­ge, twin be­ams of light swept over the­ir hi­ding pla­ce and pas­sed over the flo­or whe­re they had all be­en stan­ding.</p>
   <p>    If I knew what its we­apons and its abi­li­ti­es we­re, I might ha­ve a bet­ter chan­ce of fi­gu­ring out what to do abo­ut it-</p>
   <p>    A sho­ut bro­ke the omi­no­us si­len­ce, ma­king all three of them start and clutch at each ot­her in in­vo­lun­tary re­ac­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "Hey!" Sha­na cal­led from so­mew­he­re to the right, her own vo­ice crac­king.</p>
   <p>    The whi­ne be­ca­me a whir; so­met­hing clac­ked ang­rily over­he­ad-and in me­re mo­ments, the thing had ta­ken two earth-sha­king stri­des that got it out of Kyrti­an's fi­eld of vi­si­on. He he­ard and felt each fo­ots­tep; it was bi­pe­dal, from the so­und. And it was de­fi­ni­tely af­ter Sha­na.</p>
   <p>    Shana! What are you do­ing?</p>
   <p>    It wasn't qu­i­et in the ca­ve any lon­ger. The const­ruct must not ha­ve be­en a very gra­ce­ful thing; it so­un­ded as if it was stumb­ling in­to or kic­king asi­de every obs­tac­le in its path in its ef­fort to get to the El­ven­ba­ne. Lynder win­ced with each crash; Ho­bie just sat as fro­zen as a frigh­te­ned spar­row.</p>
   <p>    Then it stop­ped. The whi­ning no­ise be­gan aga­in, and it so­un­ded frust­ra­ted. Kyrti­an held his bre­ath aga­in, and so did the ot­her two. If it he­ard them-</p>
   <p>    "Ho!"</p>
   <p>    It was Ke­man's vo­ice this ti­me, from anot­her part of the ca­ve. The const­ruct was away aga­in, blun­de­ring its way thro­ugh the li­fe­less forms of its fel­lows. It might be bi­pe­dal, but it ob­vi­o­usly wasn't uns­tab­le; he hadn't he­ard anyt­hing that so­un­ded li­ke a stumb­le or a mis­step yet.</p>
   <p>    What are they do­ing? Not kno­wing what they we­re up to was mad­de­ning! Not be­ing ab­le to see the mons­ter was wor­se!</p>
   <p>    "Should we try and get a lo­ok?" Lynder whis­pe­red in his ear.</p>
   <p>    "Not yet," he whis­pe­red back. Just then the cras­hing and thrashing abo­ut stop­ped, and the whi­ning re­com­men­ced, so­un­ding mo­re frust­ra­ted than be­fo­re. It co­uldn't find Ke­man any mo­re than it had be­en ab­le to find Sha­na. If ma­gic fe­eds it- co­uld I ma­ke it go dor­mant by dra­ining ma­gic po­wer out of it?</p>
   <p>    It was worth trying. The only tro­ub­le was, in or­der to dra­in so­met­hing, he had to ac­tu­al­ly be in physi­cal con­tact with it.</p>
   <p>    And just how am I go­ing to do that wit­ho­ut en­ding up li­ke Ael­mar­kin? He shud­de­red, and kept his eyes aver­ted from the re­ma­ins of his co­usin.</p>
   <p>    "Hey!" That was Sha­na aga­in, from yet anot­her part of the ca­ve. It so­un­ded as if she and Ke­man we­re wor­king to­get­her to lu­re the const­ruct away from whe­re he and Lynder and Ho-bie hid. Was that what they we­re trying to do? Get the thing away from the ca­ve-mo­uth so that the three of them co­uld es­ca­pe?</p>
   <p>    He co­uldn't deny that chan­ce to his men. And it wo­uld be thro­wing the bles­sing back in the­ir fa­ce to ha­ve them risk so much and not ta­ke the op­por­tu­nity. "Start wor­king yo­ur way back to the mo­uth of the ca­ve," he whis­pe­red un­der co­ver of the cras­hes and thuds. "But don't mo­ve un­less the const­ruct is mo­ving, too. Get out of the ca­ves al­to­get­her, then bring back the rest of the men, and any equ­ip­ment you think might help. I'll stay he­re and help Sha­na and Ke­man dist­ract the thing."</p>
   <p>    "But-" Lynder be­gan.</p>
   <p>    "That's an or­der," he his­sed fi­er­cely, and to en­for­ce it, to­ok a chan­ce and scut­tled from un­der the­ir shel­ter in­to the spa­ce be­ne­ath anot­her-he­ading in the op­po­si­te di­rec­ti­on of the ca­ve-mo­uth.</p>
   <p>    He slid un­der it just in ti­me; the no­ise stop­ped aga­in, and the whi­ning be­gan.</p>
   <p>    This wasn't whe­re he'd ha­ve go­ne by cho­ice; the thing was whe­eled, so­met­hing li­ke a hay-wa­in, but the cle­aran­ce bet­we­en the ca­ve flo­or and the thing's bot­tom wasn't mo­re than half that be­ne­ath a re­al wa­gon. He had ba­rely eno­ugh ro­om to hi­de, and he co­uldn't help ha­ving night­ma­re vi­si­ons of the thing wa­king up and de­ci­ding to squ­ash him by lo­we­ring it­self down on top of him. He was swe­ating and ice-cold at the sa­me ti­me, and figh­ting a pa­nic that thre­ate­ned to ke­ep him from thin­king at all. If anyt­hing, the vi­ew from un­der he­re was wor­se than the first shel­ter, and it se­emed to ta­ke fo­re­ver be­fo­re he he­ard Ke­man's ec­ho­ing "Ho!"</p>
   <p>    The const­ruct cras­hed off in pur­su­it, and Kyrti­an scramb­led out from un­der the "wa­in" to ta­ke shel­ter, not un­der, but be­hind yet anot­her be­he­moth. This ti­me he wan­ted to see what the thing lo­oked li­ke, what it was do­ing.</p>
   <p>    It lo­oked li­ke a box on two legs, with a pa­ir of blunt crab-li­ke pin­cers on arms at­tac­hed to eit­her si­de of the box. It wasn't very fast, and it wasn't at all gra­ce­ful, but it was po­wer­ful. So­me of tho­se cras­hes hadn't be­en be­ca­use it was plo­wing in­to obs­tac­les, it was be­ca­use it was pic­king them up with a pin­cer and tos­sing them asi­de if they we­re small eno­ugh.</p>
   <p>    Ancestors! I ho­pe tho­se two aren't anyw­he­re un­der what's be­ing drop­ped!</p>
   <p>    Two lights-we­re they ma­ge-lights?-at the front of the box pro­j­ec­ted the be­ams of light that he had se­en swe­eping the gro­und lo­oking for them. They swi­ve­led, lo­oking un­can­nily li­ke eyes, and the re­semb­lan­ce ma­de him shi­ver. His tu­nic clung damply to his back and his hands ac­hed whe­re he clutc­hed the si­des of his hi­ding-pla­ce.</p>
   <p>    It stop­ped and swept the gro­und aro­und it with tho­se light-be­ams. So-whe­re we­re the ot­her two, and why wasn't it ab­le to spot them?</p>
   <p>    He frow­ned, thin­king; Ke­man and Sha­na must be pop­ping up, sho­uting, and mo­ving off aga­in whi­le it blun­de­red its way to­wards them, but the thing must not ha­ve very go­od vi­si­on, or su­rely it wo­uld see them get­ting away. That was so­met­hing to ke­ep in mind.</p>
   <p>    "Hey!" ca­me the ex­pec­ted cry-and that was when Kyrti­an re­ali­zed that Sha­na and Ke­man we­re be­ing even mo­re cle­ver than he'd tho­ught. They we­ren't "pop­ping up" whe­re the const­ruct co­uld see them-inste­ad, a pi­ece of deb­ris went flying thro­ugh the air and lan­ded on top of anot­her const­ruct with a clat­ter-at so­me dis­tan­ce from whe­re the sho­uter was. The const­ruct's lightbeams snap­ped ac­ross the length of the ca­ve and fo­cu­sed on that. And whe­re the junk lan­ded was whe­re the const­ruct he­aded. No won­der it wasn't ab­le to find what it so fer­vently hun­ted!</p>
   <p>    He das­hed out of co­ver long eno­ugh to get a pi­ece of deb­ris him­self, la­bo­ring un­der the do­ub­le han­di­cap of not wan­ting to dist­ract the thing from its cur­rent hunt, and be­ing ca­re­ful not to go whe­re he might inad­ver­tently cast a sha­dow or mo­ve ac­ross the lan­tern-light. May­be it didn't ha­ve go­od vi­si­on-and may­be it did. This wasn't the ti­me to find out.</p>
   <p>    He kept one eye on the ca­ve-mo­uth. I can't start brin­ging it back over he­re un­til Lynder and Ho­bie are sa­fe thro­ugh…</p>
   <p>    "Ho!" A much, much big­ger pi­ece of deb­ris went flying. That was Ke­man, who must be very much stron­ger than Sha­na.</p>
   <p>    Well of co­ur­se-he's a dra­gon! Kyrti­an tho­ught of the im­men­sely-strong sha­pe Ke­man had ta­ken to bring Sha­na and the ge­ar down in­to the ca­ves. It wasn't much big­ger than a hu­man, but no hu­man co­uld ha­ve do­ne what Ke­man had.</p>
   <p>    The thing fas­te­ned its light-be­ams on the junk whi­le it was still in the air, and star­ted af­ter it.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian glan­ced over at the mo­uth of the ca­ve, just in ti­me to see twin sha­dows slip over the led­ge and in­to the dark ho­le that was the start of the­ir ro­ad to sa­fety.</p>
   <p>    Relief ma­de his mo­uth dry. At le­ast they we­re out of this.</p>
   <p>    That was the go­od news; the bad news was that the thing was mo­ving fas­ter, and mo­re su­rely, every ti­me it cros­sed the flo­or. Ins­te­ad of run­ning out of po­wer, it se­emed as if mo­ve­ment was per­mit­ting it to lo­osen up jo­ints long held im­mo­bi­le. It was a go­od thing he had de­ci­ded to jo­in this lit­tle ga­me. It lo­oked as if it was go­ing to ne­ed three pla­yers.</p>
   <p>    The const­ruct re­ac­hed the spot whe­re the deb­ris had lan­ded-but this ti­me it sto­od as if it was con­si­de­ring so­met­hing, then slowly mo­ved its lights along the path that the junk Ke­man had thrown had ta­ken-</p>
   <p>    Oh, An­ces­tors. The thing can think. It's fi­nal­ly fi­gu­red out that the deb­ris isn 't what it wants, and that so­me­one must ha­ve thrown it.</p>
   <p>    He drop­ped down out of sight, lo­oked has­tily aro­und, and pic­ked a pla­ce to hi­de. Far eno­ugh away-and ne­ar eno­ugh to reach. He ho­ped. "Ha!" he sho­uted with all his might, and flung his own pi­ece of junk.</p>
   <p>    He was al­re­ady run­ning flat-out for his hi­ding-pla­ce when the pi­ece left his hand. He do­ve and rol­led be­ne­ath the const­ruct and lay the­re with his mo­uth clam­ped aro­und his sle­eve to muf­fle his pan­ting as the fo­ots­teps cras­hed ne­arer and ne­arer…</p>
   <p>    "Ha!" Sha­na he­ard, and knew im­me­di­ately that it wasn't Ke-man. So Kyrti­an had de­ci­ded to get in­to the "ga­me." She spa­red a mo­ment to "fe­el" with her mind for Ho­bie and Lynder, and to her im­men­se re­li­ef sen­sed them in the vi­ci­nity of the ca­ve-mo­uth. And the­ir "pre­sen­ces" we­re re­ce­ding. Kyrti­an was no fo­ol, tho­ugh he might be bra­ve to the po­int of fo­ol­har­di­ness.</p>
   <p>    Still, she was glad of his aid, and glad­der still he'd got­ten the two we­akest mem­bers of the gro­up out of dan­ger.</p>
   <p>    :Keman-he's sent them for help!:</p>
   <p>    :Or at le­ast he's sent them away.: Ke­man rep­li­ed, as the const­ruct cras­hed its way ac­ross the flo­or.:I don't know how much help the rest of his men co­uld be… even if they get he­re be­fo­re this thing catc­hes one of us.:</p>
   <p>    Well, ne­it­her did she. But right now, that was se­cond on her list of con­cerns. The first was how to ke­ep her­self, and Ke­man, and Kyrti­an out of the claws of the mons­ter. Fe­ar se­emed to shar­pen all of her sen­ses, and ma­de her tho­ughts fas­ter. On­ce this was over-if she li­ved thro­ugh it-she'd col­lap­se. Now she was all cal­cu­la­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    :What is that thing, any­way?: May­be the way to fi­gu­ring out how to get rid of it lay in what it was sup­po­sed to do. The An­ces­tors ma­de the wretc­hed things as sla­ves-to do all the­ir work for them. Which was why when they fo­und this world full of hu­mans they hadn't ne­eded the things that had go­ne de­ad on them and pre­su­mably hadn't bot­he­red to ret­ri­eve them.</p>
   <p>    But the mons­ter was si­lent aga­in, and it was her turn to dist­ract it. She had her pi­ece of trash re­ady, a ni­ce light pi­ece of so­met­hing me­tal­lic that sho­uld ma­ke a lot of clat­ter. "Hey!" she yel­ped, and tos­sed it back­wards over her he­ad as she sped off in the op­po­si­te di­rec­ti­on, sco­oting un­der the plat­form of so­met­hing that va­gu­ely re­semb­led a hut with a porch.</p>
   <p>    The An­ces­tors ma­de them as sla­ves-What co­uld they pos­sibly ha­ve wan­ted with that thing? Two-leg­ged, pi­er­cing thro­ugh the glo­om of the ca­ve with lights, hu­ge pin­cers-</p>
   <p>    She crin­ged back in­to her shel­ter as tho­se twin be­ams of light swept a lit­tle too clo­se. The thing was get­ting fas­ter, and mo­re nimb­le. That was not go­od.</p>
   <p>    And this ti­me it hadn't go­ne for the pla­ce whe­re the trash had lan­ded, but for so­mew­he­re ne­arer the pla­ce whe­re she'd be­en stan­ding when she sho­uted. That was wor­se.</p>
   <p>    "Ho!" sho­uted Ke­man, and the thing whir­led and lurc­hed off.</p>
   <p>    What co­uld that mons­ter pos­sibly be go­od for? She duc­ked out of her shel­ter and to­ok a qu­ick lo­ok aro­und, just in ti­me to see it pick up anot­her hor­se-si­zed const­ruct and toss it asi­de, for all the world li­ke one of her far­mers, tos­sing asi­de a sto­ne or a brick that was in the way of the plow.</p>
   <p>    Her eyes wi­de­ned in­vo­lun­ta­rily as she ima­gi­ned the thing pic­king up-say-the lo­ad on a wa­gon, and mo­ving it to a barn.</p>
   <p>    Of co­ur­se… that's what it's for.</p>
   <p>    :Keman-that mons­ter-it's me­ant to mo­ve things.:</p>
   <p>    :Well, it's do­ing a go­od job of it!: Ke­man res­pon­ded acidly.:It al­most drop­ped that last bit it threw away right on top of me!:</p>
   <p>    :No, no, I'm tel­ling you what it's me­ant to do! That's the job it's me­ant for, to mo­ve things. That's what the An­ces­tors ma­de it­for!:</p>
   <p>    The thing stop­ped, and star­ted hun­ting for Ke­man, swe­eping its lights over the inc­re­asingly-cha­otic and inc­re­asingly-tang­led ranks of const­ructs.:So-what do­es a thing li­ke that ne­ed-to do its job?: ca­me Ke­man's reply.</p>
   <p>    "Ha!" sho­uted Kyrti­an, and the mons­ter was off aga­in. Sha­na no­ti­ced that Kyrti­an hadn't bot­he­red to toss any junk this ti­me. He must ha­ve se­en that the mons­ter wasn't fo­oled by it any­mo­re.</p>
   <p>    :A strong back, strong legs, strong arms. It's got to le­arn, I sup­po­se,: she ven­tu­red.</p>
   <p>    :Well, this one's le­ar­ning! It's fi­gu­ring out it sho­uldn't cha­se af­ter the de­coys we've be­en tos­sing. Don't bot­her thro­wing things. Just yell, and run,: he rep­li­ed.:What el­se, do you think?:</p>
   <p>    :Kyrtian's al­re­ady fi­gu­red out we aren't fo­oling it any­mo­re. Um. It wo­uld ne­ed go­od ba­lan­ce. Not easy to tip over, no mat­ter how he­avy the thing is it has to pick up-: she sug­ges­ted.</p>
   <p>    :So much for my idea of trip­ping it: The mons­ter was de­fi­ni­tely get­ting mo­re nimb­le as it mo­ved. The­re was less blun­de­ring in­to things now, mo­re pic­king them up and tos­sing them asi­de. Why was it cha­sing them if it was sup­po­sed to be a car­go-mo­ver? Co­uld the ene­mi­es of the An­ces­tors ha­ve so­met­hing to do with that, or had the thing just go­ne-well-crazy in all the cen­tu­ri­es of inac­ti­vity?</p>
   <p>    :You li­kely wo­uldn't want it to cut things up, so tho­se pin­cers must be blunt.: She was trying to think of anyt­hing use­ful.</p>
   <p>    :Yes. It didn't ha­ve to cut that El­ven­lord in half, only crush him,: ca­me the sar­do­nic reply..-Who­ever he was and wha­te­ver his bu­si­ness was.:</p>
   <p>    .¦Following Kyrti­an, at a gu­ess. May­be the Gre­at Lords didn 't trust him as much as he tho­ught they did.: She sho­ok her­self to get rid of the dist­rac­ting spe­cu­la­ti­ons. It was her turn. She got out of her shel­ter, pic­ked up a flat pi­ece of 'glass' and cho­se anot­her hi­ding pla­ce. May­be if she threw it in a dif­fe­rent way than just tos­sing it any­how, it might still dist­ract the mons­ter.</p>
   <p>    "Hey!" she scre­amed, sent the thing spin­ning off li­ke the sa­ucers that the child­ren pla­yed with, and das­hed for co­ver.</p>
   <p>    She re­ac­hed it just in ti­me, and was alar­med to see that this ti­me the const­ruct aimed for the cen­ter of the arc, not the pla­ce whe­re the glass lan­ded. Too clo­se!</p>
   <p>    :Keman! Can that thing re­ach be­hind it­self, do you think?:</p>
   <p>    She sen­sed Ke­man's he­ad pop­ping up ca­uti­o­usly, and got a bri­ef glimp­se of what he saw be­fo­re he do­ve back down in­to hi­ding..7 don't think it can!: he rep­li­ed with ex­ci­te­ment..7 don't think it can see be­hind it, eit­her!:</p>
   <p>    So. That was one we­ak­ness. No, two!</p>
   <p>    :Ifyou to­ok dra­gon-form-: she hardly da­red sug­gest it, and Ke­man wo­uld ne­ed ti­me to ta­ke the form-but in dra­gon-form Ke­man was just as big as the mons­ter was. Co­uld he be a match for it?</p>
   <p>    .7 co­uld le­ap on­to its back and ke­ep it oc­cu­pi­ed,: Ke­man replied firmly. -.Then you get to Kyrti­an, and both of you get in­to the tun­nel. I'll fol­low on­ce you're go­ne. I'll be right on yo­ur he­els.:</p>
   <p>    .But-: she pro­tes­ted-she hadn't in­ten­ded that at all!</p>
   <p>    :You might as well, sin­ce I'm go­ing to do what I want to any­way.: And he clo­sed his mind off to her.</p>
   <p>    Damn him! she tho­ught with a fla­re of an­ger-and sho­ok that off, too. No ti­me, the­re was no ti­me for anyt­hing now but ac­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    She sen­sed whe­re Kyrti­an was, and wa­ited.</p>
   <p>    "Ha!" the El­ven­lord sho­uted ho­ar­sely, and ma­de his mo­ve. She did the sa­me as so­on as the mons­ter was out of sight, plan­ning her run to end ne­ar his.</p>
   <p>    The mons­ter ca­me to a halt al­most di­rectly bet­we­en them, and she fro­ze, hol­ding her bre­ath. Light swept over her hi­ding-pla­ce. On­ce. Twi­ce.</p>
   <p>    Did it gu­ess? We­re dim sen­ses wa­king up, be­co­ming ke­ener as its mo­ve­ments grew su­rer? Ins­tinct shri­eked at her to shrink back, furt­her in­to hi­ding; sen­se told her to ke­ep ab­so­lu­tely still.</p>
   <p>    "Ho!" Ke­man sho­uted, and the thing lurc­hed off. Be­fo­re Kyrti­an had a chan­ce to mo­ve, Sha­na did, di­ving un­der the whe­eled ve­hic­le that con­ce­aled him.</p>
   <p>    She fo­und her­self no­se-to-no­se with the El­ven­lord, who­se whi­te fa­ce held an exp­res­si­on of ut­ter shock at se­e­ing her. "We ne­ed to get it to turn as so­on as it's on top of Ke­man," she whis­pe­red wit­ho­ut pre­amb­le. "He's go­ing to ta­ke dra­gon-form and jump on it from be­hind."</p>
   <p>    "And do what?" Kyrti­an as­ked, ag­hast.</p>
   <p>    "How sho­uld I know?" she snap­ped. "He's de­ci­ded that's what he's go­ing to do so we can get out the way yo­ur two men did. He says he's go­ing to fol­low-"</p>
   <p>    "Well I think I can dra­in that thing if he can get it im­mo­bi­li­zed-" Kyrti­an be­gan, and the cras­hing fo­ots­teps stop­ped.</p>
   <p>    Before Kyrti­an co­uld do anyt­hing, Sha­na rol­led out from un­der­ne­ath the const­ruct and sto­od up."Hey!" she scre­amed, wa­ving her arms this ti­me. "Hey! Stu­pid! Over he­re!"</p>

   <p>    Barking his el­bows on the sto­ne flo­or in his has­te to get out, Kyrti­an scramb­led from un­der the const­ruct just in ti­me to see the mons­ter turn to­wards them.</p>
   <p>    It was not an en­co­ura­ging sight. And it got ra­pidly wor­se.</p>
   <p>    Shana just sto­od the­re, wa­ving her arms at it, and the two bright spots-far too much li­ke gla­ring, angry eyes-on its squ­are, flat front pan­ned over the spa­ce bet­we­en them and pin­ned her in a circ­le of whi­te light.</p>
   <p>    His mo­uth went dry, and fe­ar ran down his back­bo­ne li­ke a trick­le of icy wa­ter. The thing emit­ted an angry whi­ne, and lurc­hed for­ward.</p>
   <p>    But be­fo­re it had ta­ken mo­re than a sing­le step, so­met­hing mo­ved in the dark­ness be­hind it, a sha­dowy form he ba­rely ma­de out aga­inst the gla­re, that wa­ve­red and sur­ged up­wards all in an ins­tant-and then lun­ged.</p>
   <p>    Keman!</p>
   <p>    Monster of flesh aga­inst mons­ter of me­tal. The dra­gon lan­ded squ­arely on the const­ruct's back, claws shri­eking aga­inst its si­des. The mons­ter's legs buck­led be­ne­ath the dra­gon's we­ight as Kyrti­an sta­red in fro­zen fas­ci­na­ti­on-</p>
   <p>    And that was all he had ti­me to see, as Sha­na grab­bed his wrist and wrenc­hed him aro­und, pul­ling at him. "Run!" she sho­uted, sho­wing her he­els as a go­od examp­le, and he didn't ne­ed a se­cond in­vi­ta­ti­on. The mons­ter might be en­cum­be­red, but it cer­ta­inly wasn't de­fe­ated, and be­hind them the so­unds of it thras­hing abo­ut and Ke­man's claws scrab­bling to ta­ke hold we­re pro­of eno­ugh of that.</p>
   <p>    Fear ga­ve him a new burst of energy. They sprin­ted ac­ross the ca­ve flo­or with Sha­na slightly in the le­ad-not be­ca­use Kyrti­an was pla­ying the gent­le­man, eit­her. The girl must ha­ve spent her child­ho­od scramb­ling ac­ross ro­ugh gro­und li­ke this; whe­re he stumb­led, she skim­med over obs­tac­les li­ke a frigh­te­ned de­er.</p>
   <p>    She must ha­ve a se­pa­ra­te set of eyes in her fe­et…</p>
   <p>    Behind them, cras­hes and earth-shud­de­ring im­pacts tes­ti­fi­ed that Ke­man was still in the fight. An­ces­tors bless you, dra­gon. But get yo­ur­self out of it as so­on as we're cle­ar!</p>
   <p>    She re­ac­hed the led­ge first and va­ul­ted up on­to it li­ke an ex­pert ac­ro­bat, tur­ning just in ti­me to of­fer her hand to help him scramb­le up be­si­de her. Her hand was hard and to­ugh, with surp­ri­sing strength in it.</p>
   <p>    Keman- A qu­ick glan­ce over his sho­ul­der sho­wed him that the dra­gon still clung te­na­ci­o­usly to the back of the const­ruct-mons­ter, and not­hing the mons­ter co­uld do was sha­king him off.</p>
   <p>    He grab­bed Sha­na's hand and ha­uled him­self up be­si­de her, tur­ning im­me­di­ately to fa­ce the fight, ho­ping that Ke­man had so­me­how got­ten cle­ver eno­ugh to out­wit the thing.</p>
   <p>    And his he­art le­apt. Alt­ho­ugh the mons­ter's "arms" fla­iled des­pe­ra­tely, it co­uldn't re­ach the dra­gon with them, and tho­se pin­cers we­re, next to its fe­et and we­ight, its best we­apons. Ke­man had his hind claws lod­ged firmly all over the thing's back half, and his fo­rec­laws clam­ped over the front ed­ge. Kyrti­an felt a smi­le as he saw what the dra­gon had do­ne-wi­sely, he was not ma­king any furt­her of­fen­si­ve mo­ves. Ins­te­ad, he was con­tent to let the mons­ter wre­ak furt­her da­ma­ge on it­self as it blun­de­red abo­ut, trying to dis­lod­ge him. Ke­man had his ta­il cur­led tightly bet­we­en his legs and out of harm's way, his wings fol­ded tightly ac­ross his back, and his legs all tuc­ked in so that the const­ruct co­uldn't scra­pe him off wit­ho­ut first scra­ping prot­ru­ding sec­ti­ons of it­self off as well.</p>
   <p>    The lights on the front swi­ve­led in­de­pen­dently as it tri­ed and fa­iled to il­lu­mi­na­te the dra­gon on its back. It threw it­self re­pe­atedly aga­inst the walls, and buc­ked li­ke a gre­en hor­se, but co­uldn't get rid of him. It hadn't yet tho­ught to roll over on its back-but may­be it co­uldn't. Ke­man was win­ning just by vir­tue of stic­king on it li­ke a burr.</p>
   <p>    In fact, it had ta­ken so­me vi­sib­le da­ma­ge, not only from the walls of the ca­ve, but from all of the ot­her const­ructs it had blundered in­to. The right leg had a sort of hitch in its mo­ve­ment, now, and the si­des we­re scar­red whe­re it had bas­hed its skin aga­inst the rock. Kyrti­an win­ced as it flung it­self intQ the wall of the ca­ve, cras­hing in­to anot­her const­ruct in the pro­cess, and won­de­red how Ke­man ma­na­ged to stay wed­ged on­to the thing. What ma­de the bat­tle all the mo­re un­can­ny was that asi­de from the crash of me­tal on rock and me­tal on me­tal, and an un­derl­ying, angry whir or hum, the en­ti­re bat­tle was ta­king pla­ce in si­len­ce. It felt as if one or both of them ought to be gi­ving ton­gue to ter­rib­le bat­tle-ro­ars.</p>
   <p>    He felt Sha­na ten­se up be­si­de him. Then, sud­denly, Ke­man ma­de a mo­ve.</p>
   <p>    While the mons­ter was still off-ba­lan­ce, he let go with his fo­rec­laws and stab­bed them down vi­ci­o­usly at the lights. He ca­ught them. With a grin­ding shri­ek as if the me­tal it­self scre­amed, he wrenc­hed first one, then the ot­her, off the front. Me­tal and wi­re snap­ped and to­re, and Ke­man tos­sed the lights asi­de, li­ke a cru­el boy pul­ling the legs off a be­et­le.</p>
   <p>    If the mons­ter was ever go­ing to disp­lay a vo­ice, it sho­uld ha­ve then-</p>
   <p>    The lights went out as they fell, le­aving only the lan­terns he and his men had lit as il­lu­mi­na­ti­on for the ca­ve, and hu­ge sha­dows sprang up be­hind the const­ruct and its dra­co­nic bur­den, writ­hing and twis­ting as the thing thras­hed and Ke­man to­ok a new po­si­ti­on on its back.</p>
   <p>    Now what-</p>
   <p>    "Run!" Sha­na sho­uted aga­in, and as he tur­ned to do so, he saw Ke­man fling him­self off the mons­ter's back at last, half run­ning, half flying, stra­ight for the ca­ve-mo­uth whe­re they sto­od.</p>
   <p>    That's what!</p>
   <p>    He didn't wa­it to see if the mons­ter was go­ing to fol­low, or if by ta­king its lights Ke­man had al­so blin­ded it. He ig­no­red his ac­hing si­de and put everyt­hing he had in­to a flat-out dash for the ma­in ca­ve. Wit­hin mo­ments, they we­re fle­e­ing thro­ugh the dark­ness, with not­hing mo­re than the grey light at the end of the se­ri­es of de­mi-ca­ves to tell them whe­re the­ir go­al was.</p>
   <p>    A scrab­bling no­ise be­hind him ma­de the ha­ir on the back of his neck stand stra­ight up, and so­mew­he­re de­ep in­si­de him he fo­und anot­her burst of spe­ed-</p>
   <p>    It was in­si­de the tun­nel.</p>
   <p>    It was clo­sing the gap bet­we­en them!</p>
   <p>    It was right on top of him!</p>
   <p>    Something grab­bed him, clo­sing aro­und his wa­ist and spin­ning him over on his si­de as it car­ri­ed him for­ward! Air rus­hed past him as his cap­tor pic­ked up spe­ed. He fla­iled at it with fists and he­els-</p>
   <p>    "Shto thai" sa­id a muf­fled and in­dig­nant vo­ice at the back of his neck. "Ish ee!"</p>
   <p>    Keman?</p>
   <p>    Teeth shrank away from him even as he re­ali­zed they we­re stic­king in­to him, and as Ke­man ran, his jaws for­med them­sel­ves aro­und Kyrti­an's body.</p>
   <p>    Keman ma­de gre­ater spe­ed than any smal­ler, two-leg­ged cre­atu­re pos­sibly co­uld; from his in­ver­ted po­si­ti­on in the dark­ness, Kyrti­an co­uldn't see much, but when he twis­ted his he­ad, the dim, ro­und light that rep­re­sen­ted the pla­ce whe­re the last set of small ca­ves met the ent­ran­ce ca­ve was get­ting big­ger. And it was do­ing so a lot fas­ter than it had when he was run­ning.</p>
   <p>    He co­uldn't tell whe­re Sha­na was, but Ke­man wo­uldn't ha­ve left her be­hind, so she must be with them. Pro­bably she'd be­en ab­le to catch hold of his neck on the run and va­ult her­self in­to pla­ce li­ke a trick-ri­der.</p>
   <p>    Behind-</p>
   <p>    A me­tal­lic crash that de­afe­ned him for a mo­ment and sho­ok small rocks lo­ose to ra­in down on­to the­ir he­ads pro­ved that the mons­ter wasn't blind-and was still co­ming for them. From be­hind ca­me the scra­pe and gro­an of pro­tes­ting me­tal, and mo­re cras­hes as the mons­ter for­ced it­self in­to the ope­ning.</p>
   <p>    Keman fo­und mo­re spe­ed so­mew­he­re; hot, me­tal­lic bre­ath pan­ted in and out over Kyrti­an's body, and Kyrti­an pul­led in his arms and legs and tuc­ked his he­ad in to ke­ep as much of him­self in­si­de Ke­man's mo­uth as he co­uld.</p>
   <p>    "Anks," Ke­man sa­id shortly.</p>
   <p>    The no­ise from be­hind wasn't fal­ling away. Eit­her the thing was still trying to fol­low them, or it had suc­ce­eded in get­ting in and was on the­ir he­els.</p>
   <p>    A vi­olent im­pact-a dust-storm-Ke­man burst thro­ugh what was left of the bar­ri­er of tang­led carts and bo­nes and re­lics, and out in­to the ma­in ca­ve-</p>
   <p>    And sud­denly tos­sed his he­ad up in a sle­wing, si­de­ways mo­ti­on, let­ting go of Kyrti­an as he did so.</p>
   <p>    "Aiiiiiiiii!"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian scre­amed as he flew thro­ugh the air, and scre­amed aga­in as so­met­hing snatc­hed him out of it as easily as a child catc­hes a ball, then slam­med him down on a bony, scaly sur­fa­ce that inexp­li­cably had a sad­dle on it.</p>
   <p>    He clutc­hed the le­at­her, da­zed, and even as his eyes to­ok in the imp­ro­bab­le sight of a dra­gon neck and he­ad stretc­hing away in front of him, stran­ge and ske­le­tal in the dim light, the dra­gon lurc­hed in­to a run.</p>
   <p>    Ancestors! Mo­re of them?</p>
   <p>    Ahead of him-Ke­man, with Sha­na clin­ging to his neck; he must not ha­ve pa­used for a sing­le stri­de as he tos­sed his bur­den of El­ven­lord to the ot­her. Ke­man scrab­bled up the rock-pi­le at the ent­ran­ce first, with no re­gard for ni­ce­ti­es, dis­lod­ging anyt­hing that was lo­ose in his has­te to get out. As they fol­lo­wed, lurc­hing and slip­ping whi­le rocks went tumb­ling be­ne­ath and aro­und them, Kyrti­an duc­ked as mo­re rocks sho­we­red down on them, and the dra­gon he ro­de cup­ped its wings for­ward to def­lect so­me of the fal­ling deb­ris from him. His he­art po­un­ded, and his fin­gers we­re clam­ped so tightly to the sad­dle that they hurt, and all the whi­le he he­ard the scre­ech of pro­tes­ting me­tal ec­ho­ing be­hind them, co­ming, co­ming-</p>
   <p>    Then they we­re at the top, mi­ra­cu­lo­usly wi­de­ned-then out-</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian gas­ped ins­te­ad of scre­amed, as the dra­gon threw it­self in­to empty spa­ce.</p>
   <p>    It gli­ded he­avily down the slo­pe, wings wi­de-spre­ad aro­und him, and skid­ded in­to an ab­rupt lan­ding at the bot­tom.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian wasn't re­ady for that. He lost his grip, and tumb­led awkwardly over the dra­gon's sho­ul­der and down to the gro­und. The dra­gon spun aro­und on its hind legs, nimb­le as a go­at, and ra­ced back up the slo­pe to jo­in the ot­hers, three of them, who we­re all clus­te­red aro­und the ope­ning.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian lo­oked for Sha­na-and fo­und her in the emb­ra­ce of anot­her wi­zard, sha­king li­ke a le­af, and whis­pe­ring what so­un­ded li­ke a na­me. The wi­zard, who lo­oked va­gu­ely fa­mi­li­ar, stro­ked her ha­ir com­for­tingly, but spo­ke stra­ight to Kyrti­an.</p>
   <p>    "I ho­pe you don't want to get back in the­re. Ever. The dra­gons are se­aling the ent­ran­ce."</p>
   <p>    Shana re­la­xed aga­inst the sup­port of Lorryn's sho­ul­der and crad­led the wi­nes­kin in both hands; she didn't usu­al­ly drink much wi­ne but af­ter to­day-</p>
   <p>    If an­yo­ne de­ser­ves a drink, I do.</p>
   <p>    She had ne­ver be­en so glad to see an­yo­ne in her li­fe as Lor-ryn-in fact, she hadn't re­ali­zed that the ot­her dra­gons we­re the­re un­til they we­re all out of the ca­ves.</p>
   <p>    Keman, Ala­ra, Do­ra, and Ka­la­ma­dea had se­aled the ent­ran­ce past anyt­hing ot­her than anot­her dra­gon get­ting thro­ugh. They'd bro­ught down half the mo­un­ta­in, it se­emed, then fu­sed the rocks to­get­her un­til they we­re ex­ha­us­ted and limp, the­ir bright co­lors go­ne pa­le, the­ir sca­les dull. The work had be­en ur­gent eno­ugh; they'd only just bro­ught the rocks down when so­met­hing be­gan at­tac­king the pi­le from in­si­de the mo­un­ta­in, audib­le even down be­low. That was when they'd be­gun fu­sing the rocks to­get­her, and the mo­ment that the mons­ter cont­ri­van­ce en­co­un­te­red the fu­sed sec­ti­on, the bloc­ka­ge was ob­vi­o­us even to an idi­ot-or a const­ruct-for it be­gan bas­hing so­met­hing-itself? its claws?-aga­inst the rock-fall. But if it in­ten­ded to lo­osen tho­se rocks, it was go­ing to me­et with fa­ilu­re.</p>
   <p>    The dra­gons wor­ked the pi­le from the top down, cre­ating a plug of rock that was not go­ing to mo­ve. The only way to get out now was to blow out the top of the mo­un­ta­in, or tun­nel out at anot­her pla­ce.</p>
   <p>    There was no way-they ho­ped-that the const­ruct was go­ing to get at them now.</p>
   <p>    The so­und of bat­te­ring still ca­me from wit­hin the pi­le, but it was we­aker now, and slo­wer. May­be-ho­pe­ful­ly-it was run­ning out of ma­gi­cal energy, and wo­uld re­lap­se in­to its qu­i­es­cent sta­te.</p>
   <p>    Whatever; we're not go­ing to wa­it aro­und he­re to find out.</p>
   <p>    She to­ok anot­her pull on the wi­nes­kin, and clo­sed her eyes. Lorryn. Oh, thank you, Lorryn. Thank you for thin­king, for be­ing he­re. It was per­haps at that mo­ment that she re­al­ly, truly re­ali­zed how much she ca­red for him.</p>
   <p>    Lorryn had just fi­nis­hed exp­la­ining the si­tu­ati­on with Ca­el-lach Gwa­in to Lord Kyrti­an-who, at this po­int, was stun­ned and bat­te­red eno­ugh to ac­cept just abo­ut anyt­hing. He just nod­ded-at all the sa­li­ent po­ints, so at le­ast he was lis­te­ning- and to­ok it all in as if the af­fa­irs of Wi­zards we­re every­day things to him.</p>
   <p>    Huh. Then aga­in, af­ter the po­li­tics of the Gre­at Lords, our lit­tle qu­ar­rels pro­bably se­em small be­ans.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian's men had ban­da­ged the­ir scra­pes and bru­ises, ap­pli­ed re­me­di­es in­si­de and out, and sup­pli­ed all of them with fo­od and drink. Inc­lu­ding the dra­gons. Bless them, they'd go­ne out and drag­ged back three de­ad de­er-a small me­al by dra-co­nic stan­dards, af­ter all that exer­ti­on, but eno­ugh to help re­vi­ve them. The fi­re they'd bu­ilt was im­men­sely com­for­ting, and for on­ce, it wasn't ra­ining.</p>
   <p>    "… so af­ter we ma­de su­re he co­uldn 't co­me stra­ight back to the Ci­ta­del, we wa­ited. When he didn't co­me back at all, I fi­nal­ly de­ci­ded that he'd eit­her fol­lo­wed you, or he'd fi­nal­ly let his ar­ro­gan­ce ta­ke him in­to a si­tu­ati­on he co­uldn't get out of,". Lorryn sa­id.</p>
   <p>    "And go­od rid­dan­ce to bad rub­bish, if you ask me," Ke­man grumb­led un­der his bre­ath. He-and the ot­hers-we­re too bo­ne-we­ary to shift; they'd cur­led them­sel­ves aro­und the ent­ran­ce to the camp, ma­king a for­mi­dab­le bar­ri­er bet­we­en the camp and anyt­hing that might even con­si­der go­ing af­ter what was in­si­de it. Kyrti­an's men we­re still wi­de-eyed and a lit­tle nervous abo­ut be­ing sur­ro­un­ded by dra­gons, but we­re hand­ling it all re­mar­kably well. Ke­man was flank-to-flank with Do­ra; the sight of two yo­ung dra­gons be­ing as af­fec­ti­ona­te as any two yo­ung lo­vers se­emed to go a long way to re­as­su­ring Kyrt-ian's men.</p>
   <p>    I sup­po­se it ma­kes them se­em mo­re hu­man…</p>
   <p>    "Keman has be­en tal­king with me, at night," Do­ra sa­id, and the ba­re skin aro­und her eyes and mo­uth flus­hed a de­li­ca­te pink. Sha­na saw two of Kyrti­an's men exc­han­ge a kno­wing lo­ok, and hid a smi­le. When hu­mans who'd ne­ver se­en dra­gons be­fo­re this co­uld re­cog­ni­ze a shy blush on the fa­ce of one, things wo­uld be all right. "We can spe­ak over gre­ater dis­tan­ces, mind-to-mind, than you can. And-we miss each ot­her when we're apart." She eyed Sha­na with gu­ilt. "I'm sorry Ke­man didn't men­ti­on it be­fo­re, but-we didn't want you to fe­el badly be­ca­use we co­uld talk and you and Lorryn co­uldn't."</p>
   <p>    "Of co­ur­se," Kyrti­an sa­id, with a slow smi­le. "I can cer­ta­inly un­ders­tand that." He pas­sed his wi­nes­kin to one of his men, and set­tled back aga­inst the bulk of Ke­man as com­for­tably as if he used a dra­gon as a back­rest every day.</p>
   <p>    Dora flus­hed aga­in. "So I knew whe­re you we­re, ge­ne­ral­ly. And, of co­ur­se, Lorryn had al­re­ady be­en to the pla­ce whe­re Sha­na and Ke­man trans­por­ted to in the first pla­ce and he knew how to get the­re him­self."</p>
   <p>    I sho­uld ha­ve known the lo­ve­birds we­re chat­ting ins­te­ad of sle­eping, she tho­ught-with a lit­tle envy. It wo­uld ha­ve be­en a lot ni­cer if she'd be­en ab­le to do that with Lorryn wit­ho­ut the aid of Ke­man. On the who­le tho­ugh, it was a dam­ned go­od thing they had be­en bil­ling and co­o­ing every night. If they hadn't be­en, she might not be he­re right now.</p>
   <p>    "So when Do­ra told me that you had fo­und the ca­ve and when Ca­el­lach Gwa­in didn't co­me back, I de­ci­ded it was mo­re im­por­tant to get out he­re and see if we co­uld find him be­fo­re he fo­und you," Lorryn sa­id with a shrug when Sha­na til­ted her he­ad up to gi­ve him a me­asu­ring sta­re.</p>
   <p>    "You sup­po­sed he'd be­en ab­le to fol­low us, then?" she as­ked.</p>
   <p>    "I co­uldn't ta­ke the chan­ce that he hadn't," Lorryn rep­li­ed. "I figured that brin­ging three dra­gons along wo­uld ma­ke cer­ta­in he didn't try anyt­hing if-or when-we ca­ught him."</p>
   <p>    "I knew they we­re co­ming of co­ur­se," Ke­man put in. "But all they we­re sup­po­sed to do was to lo­ok for the Old Whi­ner. They we­ren't go­ing to butt the­ir sno­uts in on us, why sho­uld they? The­re was no re­ason to. When we got back, you'd ha­ve just fo­und out they'd ca­ught the wretch, so I didn't see any re­ason to bot­her you with it."</p>
   <p>    "You left me in char­ge to de­al with Ca­el­lach," Lorryn told Sha­na, me­eting her ga­ze frankly, and she ga­ve his hand a lit­tle squ­e­eze. "Wit­ho­ut Ca­el­lach, the­re was no one to or­ga­ni­ze dis­con­tent. Frankly, kno­wing whe­re he was and ke­eping him from ma­king cons­pi­ra­ci­es out of half-truths was mo­re im­por­tant than my be­ing di­rectly in com­mand for a day or so."</p>
   <p>    She nod­ded, and smi­led. How co­uld she not ag­ree with him when he was ob­vi­o­usly every bit as com­pe­tent as she was? She left him in char­ge; that me­ant to be in char­ge and ma­ke de­ci­si­ons wit­ho­ut con­sul­ting her if the­re was no ne­ed to. It wo­uld be pretty ab­surd to be angry with him for do­ing just that.</p>
   <p>    But she co­uld tell him all that la­ter, when they we­re alo­ne. For now it was eno­ugh to know that she didn't ha­ve to be "the El­ven­ba­ne" alo­ne any­mo­re…</p>
   <p>    "We trans­por­ted in this mor­ning and flew he­re, but we ne­ver, ever ex­pec­ted you to wa­ke up a mons­ter! And let me tell you," Lorryn conc­lu­ded, "tho­se last few mo­ments when that thing at­tac­ked you and we we­re still in the air we­re the worst in my li­fe."</p>
   <p>    "They we­ren't any joy for us, I can tell you," Ke­man grumb­led.</p>
   <p>    "So that was why you went ahe­ad and at­tac­ked the thing!" Sha­na exc­la­imed.</p>
   <p>    "You su­rely didn't think I'd be stu­pid eno­ugh to do that wit­ho­ut be­ing pretty su­re I knew what I was do­ing, did you?" Ke­man rep­li­ed in­dig­nantly. "I think I did all right wit­ho­ut the­ir help, thank you. We didn't even re­al­ly ne­ed them to get out of the ca­ve, and I know I co­uld ha­ve at le­ast bloc­ked the ent­ran­ce eno­ugh by myself to hold that mons­ter, long eno­ugh for us all to trans­port out of he­re, any­way! I'll ad­mit I was glad to see them, and it ma­de get­ting that thing bot­tled up easi­er, but we three we­re per­fectly ab­le to de­al with it on our own."</p>
   <p>    "You might ha­ve at le­ast told me that the­re was help co­ming," Sha­na po­in­ted out-re­aso­nably, she tho­ught, but Ke­man only snor­ted, and for a mo­ment, she was ir­ri­ta­ted.</p>
   <p>    "I didn't exactly ha­ve ti­me to dis­cuss it with you!" he sa­id, lo­oking just as ir­ri­ta­ted as she was. "And we we­ren't in any tro­ub­le, any­way!"</p>
   <p>    She de­ci­ded not to qu­ar­rel with him-but this new at­ti­tu­de on his part was so­met­hing she hadn't ex­pec­ted. Not from Ke­man the gent­le, Ke­man her lit­tle brot­her-</p>
   <p>    Keman the not-so-lit­tle-anymo­re…</p>
   <p>    She'd ha­ve to ta­ke that in­to her cal­cu­la­ti­ons from now on. Ma­les, she tho­ught. He was so much mo­re re­aso­nab­le when he was still a dra­gon­ling! It had to be all of the co­ur­ting and co­o­ing with Do­ra, she fi­nal­ly de­ci­ded.</p>
   <p>    He wasn't a "kid" any­mo­re and it lo­oked as if he was go­ing to be li­ke every ot­her ado­les­cent ma­le and start pro­ving it.</p>
   <p>    Now he'd be­ha­ve li­ke most of the ot­her yo­ung ma­le dra­gons she knew. Wi­zard ma­les and hu­man ma­les, for that mat­ter. Next thing, he'd be flying mock-com­bats and do­ing ac­ro­ba­tics for Do­ra's ad­mi­ra­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Lorryn must ha­ve gu­es­sed at her tho­ughts-or may­be she was thin­king them a lit­tle too lo­udly.:No wor­ri­es,: he sa­id, squ­e­ezing her hand.:He'll get over it. And I as­su­re you, I'm past it.:</p>
   <p>    :Thank the An­ces­tors!: she rep­li­ed, her hu­mor co­ming back..7 think I'd send you to the Iron Pe­op­le to get it be­aten out of you if you we­ren 't!:</p>
   <p>    "All I can say is that I'm glad you ca­me," Kyrti­an sa­id fer­vently, with a gra­te­ful slap to Ke­man's flank. "Wha­te­ver is in the­re can re­ma­in in the­re fo­re­ver, so far as I'm con­cer­ned." He shud­de­red, and sa­id not­hing mo­re, but Sha­na co­uld only won­der if he wo­uld fe­el that way so­me ti­me in the fu­tu­re. Af­ter all, his fat­her-or what was left of his fat­her-was still in the­re.</p>
   <p>    Well, it wo­uldn't be her prob­lem. He was fo­re­war­ned now, and if he de­ci­ded he had to go back, he knew he'd bet­ter co­me with plenty of help.</p>
   <p>    And, be­ing wit­ho­ut a lady fri­end to imp­ress, he just might act in a sen­sib­le man­ner, un­li­ke cer­ta­in yo­ung dra­gons.</p>
   <p>    She coc­ked her ear to lis­ten for a mo­ment to things out­si­de the camp. The so­unds from in­si­de the mo­un­ta­in we­re de­fi­ni­tely we­aker. "Did you find any sign of Ca­el­lach?" she as­ked, be­la­tedly re­cal­ling that this was why the­ir res­cu­ers had co­me in the first pla­ce.</p>
   <p>    "We fo­und whe­re he'd trans­por­ted in-so he did ma­na­ge to le­arn the spell-and then we fo­und am­bush-be­ast tracks on top of his," Lorryn sa­id grimly. "We didn't bot­her to fol­low them back to the den; the­re was eno­ugh blo­od to pretty much gu­aran­tee that Ca­el­lach must ha­ve be­en the be­ast's din­ner."</p>
   <p>    Her mo­uth for­med in­to a so­und­less "O" but she co­uldn't think of what el­se to say. Lorryn wa­ited for a mo­ment, then con­ti­nu­ed. "My tho­ught is to just let him va­nish. If the ot­her Old Whi­ners mink he's go­ne off to the old Ci­ta­del or so­mew­he­re el­se to li­ve in lu­xury with the­ir be­lon­gings and with lu­xury go­ods lif­ted from the El­ven­lords, they're not go­ing to ma­ke a martyr out of him."</p>
   <p>    "Whereas, if they fo­und out his own stu­pi­dity kil­led him-?" she co­un­te­red. "Wo­uldn't that dest­roy his cre­dit with them?"</p>
   <p>    "Then so­me­one might try and ma­ke it lo­ok as if you ar­ran­ged for his de­ath," Lorryn rep­li­ed, with a gri­ma­ce. The fi­re fla­red up for a mo­ment and ga­ve them all a lo­ok of rapt con­cent­ra­ti­on. "It'd only be our word for what re­al­ly hap­pe­ned."</p>
   <p>    "A suf­fi­ci­ently cle­ver fel­low co­uld even ma­ke him out to be a martyr if they did be­li­eve that an am­bush be­ast kil­led him," Kyrti­an sa­id unex­pec­tedly. "After all, he was the last sup­por­ter of the Old Ways, and he was trying to get in­for­ma­ti­on that wo­uld show the ot­hers that you and yo­ur New Ways we­re fo­men­ting tre­ac­hery to yo­ur own kind. It wasn't stu­pi­dity that kil­led him, it was a wil­ling­ness to sac­ri­fi­ce him­self to pro­ve the truth."</p>
   <p>    Shana sta­red at him for a mo­ment, as­to­nis­hed.</p>
   <p>    Where did he get that? It's pos­sib­le-it's even li­kely-but I wo­uldn't ha­ve tho­ught of it!</p>
   <p>    Even Lorryn lo­oked surp­ri­sed. "I'm glad you're on our si­de," Lorryn ma­na­ged, af­ter a mo­ment. "If you can think of things li­ke that-"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian shrug­ged, his eyes ble­ak in the fi­re­light. "I didn't al­ways think this way," he po­in­ted out. "I sup­po­se I can thank my la­te co­usin Ael­mar­kin for my edu­ca­ti­on-and my loss of in­no­cen­ce." Then he smi­led, and he lo­oked mo­re li­ke him­self aga­in.</p>
   <p>    "Well, yo­ur co­usin got exactly what he de­ser­ved," Ke­man sa­id.</p>
   <p>    But Kyrti­an shrug­ged. "Much as I'm glad I won't ha­ve to worry abo­ut him any lon­ger, I wo­uldn't wish the de­ath he got on an­yo­ne."</p>
   <p>    Shana comp­res­sed her lips; she wasn't fe­eling that ge­ne­ro­us. Es­pe­ci­al­ly when-now that she ca­me to think abo­ut it-it was en­ti­rely pos­sib­le that it had be­en Ael­mar­kin who wo­ke that blas­ted const­ruct. "I do­ubt he wo­uld ha­ve sa­id the sa­me of you," she sa­id brus­qu­ely.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian sig­hed, and lo­oked we­ary and pen­si­ve. "You're pro­bably right. No, you are right. But it wo­uld ma­ke me mo­re li­ke him to think that way, so I won't." His jaw fir­med. "I re­fu­se to des­cend to his le­vel. So I'll for­gi­ve him."</p>
   <p>    "Now that he isn't he­re to ma­ke any mo­re tro­ub­le for you, eh?" Ke­man sa­id shrewdly.</p>
   <p>    "His men are shi­ve­ring with fe­ar in an ill-ma­de camp, out that way," Fat­her Dra­gon put in, unex­pec­tedly. "Shall we res­cue them, do you think?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes!" sa­id Kyrti­an and Lorryn.</p>
   <p>    "No!" sa­id Sha­na and Ke­man at the sa­me mo­ment. All fo­ur exc­han­ged glan­ces, and it was Sha­na who bro­ke the de­ad­lock.</p>
   <p>    "All right," she sa­id grud­gingly. "I sup­po­se we can ro­und them up and ta­ke them back to the new Ci­ta­del when you've left, Kyrti­an. Zed can pro­bably find a use for them."</p>
   <p>    "We'll le­ave the way we ca­me," sa­id Kyrti­an, with a sigh.</p>
   <p>    "Having fo­und not­hing but empty ca­ves. We ha­ve a lar­ger plan to think of."</p>
   <p>    "Indeed," Ka­la­ma­dea rumb­led, and it se­emed to Sha­na that he spo­ke for all of them. "And now-rest We ha­ve a gre­at de­al of work ahe­ad of us."</p>
   <p>    Indeed we do, she tho­ught, as Lorryn hel­ped her to her fe­et, and led her to the tent that two of Kyrti­an's men had va­ca­ted for them.</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian stretc­hed, fe­eling every sing­le scra­pe, bru­ise, and pul­led musc­le. But just as much as he lon­ged for ho­me and a hot bath, he dre­aded fa­cing his mot­her with the news he had.</p>
   <p>    Absently, to dist­ract him­self from his own glo­omy tho­ughts, he pat­ted Ke­mah's si­de. "I don't sup­po­se I co­uld talk you and yo­ur lady-fri­end in­to tur­ning up in a few days, co­uld I?" he as­ked. "I'd lo­ve for mot­her to see you for her­self."</p>
   <p>    And it wo­uld do her go­od to dist­ract her from my-bad news. Oh, of co­ur­se, she had be­en as­su­ming all the­se ye­ars that his fat­her was de­ad-but it was one thing to as­su­me, and anot­her to know. When you as­su­med, the­re co­uld al­ways be that lit­tle ho­pe lur­king in the back of yo­ur he­art that you co­uldn't qu­ite gi­ve up…</p>
   <p>    He knew he was ne­ver go­ing to ac­tu­al­ly tell her what he had fo­und. It wo­uld be eno­ugh to tell her that he'd fo­und his fat­her's re­ma­ins and not get any mo­re ela­bo­ra­te than that.</p>
   <p>    And tell her that, yes, he did find the Gre­at Por­tal just as he 'd al­ways ex­pec­ted, but that he was kil­led in an ac­ci­dent. That it lo­oked as if he was ta­ken comp­le­tely by surp­ri­se. That wo­uld le­ave her with the com­for­tab­le imp­res­si­on that he'd ne­ver known what was go­ing to hap­pen to him.</p>
   <p>    Keman la­ug­hed. "Of co­ur­se you co­uld! In fact, I think I will ask Lorryn and Sha­na if Do­ra and I can be the Wi­zards' li­a­isons with you. They don't ne­ed us par­ti­cu­larly to spy on the Gre­at Lords, and the ad­van­ta­ge of ha­ving us with you rat­her than Wi­zards is that we won't dis­gu­ise our true na­tu­re with il­lu­si­on. We can po­se as a Les­ser Lord and his Lady. Sho­uld you ha­ve any mo­re vi­sits from-say-Lord Kyndreth, no mat­ter how many il­lu­si­on-dis­pel­ling ma­gics he casts, we'll pass his test."</p>
   <p>    "I hadn't tho­ught of that!" Kyrti­an sa­id, in we­ary surp­ri­se, fe­eling a re­ne­wed stir­ring of ple­asu­re. "Con­si­der the in­vi­ta­ti­on ten­de­red, then. That wo­uld sol­ve any num­ber of prob­lems."</p>
   <p>    Dora nud­ged him with her sno­ut af­fec­ti­ona­tely. "I think that wo­uld be lo­vely, my Lord," she rep­li­ed. "I don't sup­po­se you ha­ve any ca­ves on yo­ur pro­perty, do you?"</p>
   <p>    Kyrtian rep­res­sed the auto­ma­tic shud­der; af­ter what he'd just be­en thro­ugh, he ne­ver, ever wan­ted to go un­derg­ro­und aga­in-</p>
   <p>    But he lo­oked over at Lynder, who grin­ned she­epishly, and ans­we­red for him. "Qu­ite a few, mi-ah-yo­ur-"</p>
   <p>    "Just Do­ra," the fe­ma­le dra­gon sa­id, in a kindly to­ne of vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    "Ah." Lynder rub­bed the si­de of his no­se with his hand, self-cons­ci­o­usly. "Do­ra, then. Yes, Ho­bie and I ha­ve fo­und qu­ite a few. Li­mes­to­ne ca­ves, wa­ter-car­ved, with lots of for­ma­ti­ons."</p>
   <p>    "Lovely!" the fe­ma­le dra­gon sa­id with ent­hu­si­asm. "Lord Kyrti­an, you wo­uldn't mind if we to­ok over one, wo­uld you?"</p>
   <p>    "We," is it? he tho­ught, hol­ding back a chuck­le at the way Ke­man's exp­res­si­on chan­ged from start­le­ment to ple­asu­re. No won­der the yo­ung cock is star­ting to strut! Might be a very go­od thing for all of them to se­pa­ra­te this yo­ung fel­low from the rest of his pe­ers, so he's less temp­ted to act-well, li­ke a yo­ung cock. With the cur­rent sta­te of things… best to get him set­tled. The next ti­me the­re was a si­tu­ati­on in­vol­ving yo­ung Ke­man, the ur­ge to try and pro­ve him­self co­uld ha­ve so­me se­ri­o­us con­se­qu­en­ces.</p>
   <p>    "I wo­uld con­si­der it an ho­nor," he sa­id, to both the­ir sa­tis­fac­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "Shana's so used to de­pen­ding on me, you know, and I think it wo­uld be bet­ter for her if she got out of that ha­bit and star­ted-well-de­pen­ding on Lorryn ins­te­ad," Ke­man sa­id in a slightly pat­ro­ni­zing un­der­to­ne, with a glan­ce at the now-occupied tent. "I prac­ti­cal­ly ra­ised her-with Mot­her's help, of co­ur­se, but I did most of it."</p>
   <p>    That con­cept ma­de his he­ad swim for a mo­ment! "Ah- re­al­ly?" he as­ked.</p>
   <p>    Keman chuck­led. "I had all sorts of pets. So far as the ot­hers of our La­ir we­re con­cer­ned, she was just one mo­re! Un­til she star­ted tal­king and ac­ting li­ke a per­son, of co­ur­se."</p>
   <p>    It ma­de Kyrti­an's he­ad swim a lit­tle mo­re. "In the very ne­ar fu­tu­re-when you're set­tled on my es­ta­te and we ha­ve the ti­me-you are go­ing to ha­ve to tell me all abo­ut that," he sa­id, as firmly as he co­uld.</p>
   <p>    He was not go­ing to di­sa­bu­se the yo­ung dra­gon of his no­ti­on that Las­ha­na "de­pen­ded" on him. He did fe­el a pang of je­alo­usy tho­ugh, over that yo­ung Wi­zard, Lorryn…</p>
   <p>    No, he cor­rec­ted him­self. Not je­alo­usy. Envy.</p>
   <p>    It wasn't that he wan­ted Sha­na-she was a hand­so­me yo­ung wo­man, but not, well, not the type he was at­trac­ted to, re­al­ly. Ex­cept, per­haps, for tho­se cha­rac­te­ris­tics of mind and spi­rit that he ad­mi­red. No, what he wan­ted was the kind of re­la­ti­ons­hip that she and Lorryn so cle­arly sha­red. What his mot­her and fat­her had on­ce had to­get­her.</p>
   <p>    Ancestors. Won't that be a surp­ri­se for Mot­her. But he didn't think he'd gi­ve her free re­in to go hunt him up a wi­fe. Not at the mo­ment. The­re we­re a lot of dif­fi­cult days ahe­ad of them; they we­re all go­ing to ha­ve a gre­at many mo­re im­por­tant things to oc­cupy the­ir ti­me.</p>
   <p>    Like how to sur­vi­ve, for one thing.</p>
   <p>    He was un­der no il­lu­si­on that with Ael­mar­kin go­ne, all of his tro­ub­les we­re abo­ut to va­nish. Qu­ite the cont­rary. He was now in­to the mo­rass of the po­li­tics of the Gre­at Lords, he had the Yo­ung Lords to worry abo­ut and-</p>
   <p>    And I'm tech­ni­cal­ly a tra­itor. I'm cons­pi­ring with the Wi­zards to cre­ate a sla­ve re­bel­li­on.</p>
   <p>    All that, in ad­di­ti­on to trying to ke­ep his own pe­op­le sa­fe. If he tho­ught abo­ut it too long, it se­emed im­pos­sib­le, and he be­gan to do­ubt he'd even ma­na­ge that last, and in so­me ways most im­por­tant task, much less all the rest.</p>
   <p>    But he wasn't alo­ne in this, now. For on­ce, it didn't all de­pend on him and his paltry skills. We'll be do­ing it to­get­her, dra­gons and El­ven­lords, Wi­zards and hu­mans wor­king to­get­her. At last.</p>
   <p>    And with that for­mi­dab­le com­bi­na­ti­on-he had to be­li­eve the­re was no prob­lem that they co­uld not ul­ti­ma­tely de­fe­at.</p>

    <p><strong>EPILOGUE </strong></p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Triana had ne­ver be­en par­ti­cu­larly af­ra­id be­fo­re she'd en­te­red the­se ca­ves. She'd only tho­ught she'd en­co­un­te­red ter­ror be­fo­re the const­ruct ca­me ali­ve.</p>
   <p>    But the mo­ment that the thing aro­se out of the rest, li­ke so­me ter­rif­ying me­tal in­sect with a scre­aming Ael­mar­kin in its claws, she knew true and pa­raly­zing hor­ror.</p>
   <p>    By then she had be­en be­si­de the Gre­at Por­tal, and as the thing blun­de­red back and forth ac­ross the ca­ve in pur­su­it of Kyrti­an and his pe­op­le, she shrank in­to the shel­ter of one of its cur­ved si­des, pra­ying that it wo­uldn't see her, wo­uldn't blun­der in­to her. That was all she co­uld ma­na­ge; her kne­es scar­cely held her up, and she co­uldn't ha­ve run if she wan­ted to. She was drenc­hed in a cold, cold swe­at; every ti­me the thing ca­me anyw­he­re ne­ar she held her bre­ath un­til she ne­arly pas­sed out, lest it he­ar her bre­at­hing.</p>
   <p>    She was su­re she was go­ing to die. For the first ti­me in her li­fe, she sta­red mor­ta­lity in the fa­ce, and re­ali­zed that she co­uldn't be­ar it…</p>
   <p>    She co­uldn't be­ar it. In a mo­ment, she was go­ing to fa­int, or scre­am and bet­ray her­self. She tremb­led and swe­ated, and clenc­hed her fists un­til her long na­ils bit in­to her palms and ma­de them ble­ed.</p>
   <p>    One mo­ment, the­re was the me­tal mons­ter. Then the me­tal one-was at­tac­ked by a dra­gon.</p>
   <p>    It was im­pos­sib­le. It was too much. She clutc­hed at the Por­tal si­de, and tur­ned her fa­ce in­to it and re­fu­sed to lo­ok. It didn't mat­ter which one of them won-the sur­vi­vor wo­uld find her and kill her-she'd die li­ke Ael­mar­kin, scre­aming in ter­ror and pa­in; she didn't stand a chan­ce-</p>
   <p>    She fo­ught down the scre­am that thre­ate­ned to es­ca­pe-te­ars scorc­hed her fa­ce and her thro­at ac­hed with the ne­ed to shri­ek and shri­ek, but if she did, she'd die then and the­re, and she wan­ted to li­ve…</p>
   <p>    Something snap­ped in­si­de her. Her mo­uth ope­ned, but not­hing ca­me out. She felt her­self start to col­lap­se, then black­ness swo­oped down on her li­ke a dra­gon, and to­ok her sen­ses.</p>
   <p>    When she wo­ke, the ca­ve was qu­i­et, and she lay spraw­led at the fo­ot of the Gre­at Por­tal. The ca­ve was still il­lu­mi­na­ted by the un­cer­ta­in yel­low light of Kyrti­an's lan­terns, or what was left of them.</p>
   <p>    Suddenly, she did not want to know if Kyrti­an had met the sa­me fa­te as Ael­mar­kin. It was one thing to see me­re hu­man sla­ves die; it was anot­her thing en­ti­rely to know, to see the hand of de­ath cut down anot­her El­ven­lord.</p>
   <p>    No. The ca­ves we­re not en­ti­rely qu­i­et… in the far, far dis­tan­ce, out in the ent­ran­ce ca­ve, per­haps, so­met­hing bat­te­red mo­no­to­no­usly at the sto­ne. Sin­ce the "so­met­hing" so­un­ded li­ke me­tal, it must ha­ve be­en the me­tal mons­ter that sur­vi­ved.</p>
   <p>    So it was bet­we­en her and the only way out.</p>
   <p>    For a mo­ment, she tho­ught she was go­ing to fa­int aga­in, but as her hands clo­sed con­vul­si­vely and her na­ils bit in­to her palm, so did the band of the he­avy sig­net ring she wo­re-The ring. The ring! It was her Por­tal key-and she lay in the big­gest Por­tal of them all!</p>
   <p>    Shaking in every limb, she got to her fe­et so­me­how, and dis­mis­sed the il­lu­si­on she wo­re. If this was go­ing to work, she wo­uld ne­ed every mor­sel of po­wer.</p>
   <p>    She fa­ced the Gre­at Por­tal, clo­sed her eyes, and slowly, ca­re­ful­ly, be­gan to we­ave the li­nes of energy that wo­uld open a long-dor­mant Por­tal li­ke this one. It was go­ing to ta­ke a lot- this one had be­en ma­de by the con­cer­ted ef­fort of do­zens of ma­ges, and she was only one.</p>
   <p>    But she al­so didn't ha­ve any cho­ice if she wan­ted to li­ve.</p>
   <p>    Bit by bit, slug­gishly, the Por­tal be­gan to res­pond. The li­nes of po­wer oozed in­to pla­ce rat­her than snap­ping crisply in­to the­ir po­si­ti­ons. The pat­terns for­med, but oh! so slowly!</p>
   <p>    And then, with no war­ning at all-the Por­tal snap­ped to full and vib­rant li­fe!</p>
   <p>    Startled, Tri­ana ope­ned her eyes.</p>
   <p>    The shim­me­ring cur­ta­in of po­wer wit­hin the glo­wing gre­en arch shi­ve­red.</p>
   <p>Parted.</p>
   <p>    And an en­ti­rely new hor­ror step­ped thro­ugh.</p>
   <p>    Like so­me un­sanc­ti­fi­ed mel­ding of Elf and rep­ti­le, the thing sto­od twi­ce as tall as she. It was long-lim­bed, sex­less, and en­ti­rely na­ked, co­ve­red in its own blue-gre­en sca­les. It had a ta­il that las­hed back and forth rest­les­sly, a ha­ir­less he­ad, legs that bent the wrong way at the kne­es, a lip­less mo­uth full of po­in­ted te­eth, and-most hor­rib­le of all-eyes she wo­uld ha­ve re­cog­ni­zed on any El­ven­lord. And it saw her the ins­tant it wal­ked thro­ugh the Por­tal.</p>
   <p>    Before she co­uld mo­ve, it had cle­ared the dis­tan­ce bet­we­en them in a sing­le le­ap, and se­ized her.</p>
   <p>    Its strong, sca­led fin­gers clo­sed aro­und her wa­ist, in a grip unb­re­akab­le as me­tal cab­les. Now she scre­amed, shri­eked and fo­ught, but she might as well ha­ve be­en figh­ting the me­tal mons­ter. It had no exp­res­si­on what­so­ever on the flat pla­te that was its fa­ce.</p>
   <p>    It even smel­led li­ke a sna­ke, musty and gre­en, and the smell ma­de her even mo­re fran­tic, so­me­how, trig­ge­ring fe­ars so ata­vis­tic that she to­re off na­ils and bit li­ke an ani­mal trying to get free of it. Her en­ti­re body felt afi­re; not­hing exis­ted for her but the over­po­we­ring ne­ed to es­ca­pe-</p>
   <p>    All for na­ught. The thing ne­ver even win­ced. It was im­pos­sibly strong and ut­terly imp­la­cab­le; the mo­ment that she ti­red, it flung her over its sho­ul­der.</p>
   <p>    Reduced now to mind­less pa­nic, she re­ne­wed her fight, but her shri­eks ma­de no imp­res­si­on on it, and she might as well ha­ve be­en figh­ting with the sto­ne of the ca­ve.</p>
   <p>    It car­ri­ed her to the Por­tal, which shim­me­red with ac­ti­vity. She scre­amed as they ap­pro­ac­hed the shi­ve­ring cur­ta­in of light.</p>
   <p>    They to­uc­hed it. And pas­sed thro­ugh it.</p>
   <p>    And the Por­tal clo­sed be­hind them aga­in.</p>
   <p>    Lord Kyndreth ste­ep­led his fin­gers to­get­her and sta­red at his son Gil­dor, who had just bro­ught him news that was-well- pe­cu­li­ar. He wasn't cer­ta­in what to ma­ke of it. He was even less cer­ta­in what to do abo­ut it.</p>
   <p>    He had yo­ung Kyrti­an's re­port on his desk, a writ­ten copy of what Kyrti­an had told him via the te­le­son, and alt­ho­ugh he co­uld find no fa­ult in it, it had left him fe­eling va­gu­ely un­sa­tis­fi­ed. Gran­ted, ever­yo­ne knew what the fo­rest bor­de­ring Chey-nar's es­ta­te was dan­ge­ro­us, full of ali­corns and the An­ces­tors only knew what sorts of wor­se things. And the­re was no re­al re­ason why Kyrti­an sho­uld ha­ve ac­tu­al­ly fo­und the pur­por­ted den of halfb­lo­ods in the­re. Af­ter all, they'd be­en hi­ding for cen­tu­ri­es with no one sus­pec­ting the­ir pre­sen­ce, so why sho­uld one yo­ung El­ven­lord find them now?</p>
   <p>    But-the re­port felt in­comp­le­te. As if Kyrti­an was hi­ding so­met­hing from him, alt­ho­ugh he co­uld not even be­gin to gu­ess what that "so­met­hing" was.</p>
   <p>    And now-Gil­dor, po­or dul­lard that he was, wal­ked in­to the study with the as­to­nis­hing news that Lady Tri­ana and Ael-mar­kin we­re mis­sing. That they had left the­ir es­ta­tes with cam­ping ge­ar and a tra­in of sla­ves that inc­lu­ded (in Tri­ana's ca­se, at le­ast) sla­ves tra­ined as fo­res­ters. And now, both we­re mis­sing, the­ir es­ta­tes in con­fu­sed di­sar­ray, the­ir sla­ves left with no or­ders, un­cer­ta­in of what they sho­uld do now. Gil­dor and his fri­ends had tur­ned up at Ael­mar­kin's es­ta­te for a plan­ned event-one at which Lady Tri­ana was al­so sup­po­sed to ap­pe­ar- to find that both we­re go­ne, va­nis­hed.</p>
   <p>    "Thank you, Gil­dor," Kyndreth told his son, with the gra­vity due to a ma­j­or pi­ece of in­tel­li­gen­ce. "Thank you very much. Wo­uld you ca­re to in­vi­te all of tho­se fri­ends of yo­urs who we­re di­sap­po­in­ted of the­ir amu­se­ment he­re? I will be happy to en­ter­ta­in them for a we­ek, if you li­ke."</p>
   <p>    As he'd ex­pec­ted, Gil­dor's dull fa­ce brigh­te­ned at the pros­pect; Kyndreth sum­mo­ned his ste­ward and sent his son off with the les­ser Lord to or­ga­ni­ze the en­ter­ta­in­ment. That is, Lord Be­lath wo­uld or­ga­ni­ze the en­ter­ta­in­ment, and Gil­dor wo­uld sum­mon his fri­ends… it wo­uld be a gre­at dis­rup­ti­on to Kyn-dreth's work, in fact, he might ha­ve to re­ti­re to the hun­ting-lod­ge or the old Do­wa­ger-Ho­use whi­le the yo­ung ro­is­te­rers rom­ped thro­ugh his halls. But that wo­uld be a small pri­ce to pay if Gil­dor con­ti­nu­ed to bring him tid­bits li­ke this one.</p>
   <p>    Was this what Kyrti­an was hi­ding?</p>
   <p>    That didn't fit with his re­ading of the yo­ung Lord. Kyrti­an was not li­kely to con­ce­al the fact that his co­usin had co­me to gri­ef, and even less li­kely to ha­ve mur­de­red Ael­mar­kin him­self. Kyndreth co­uld re­adily see why Ael­mar­kin wo­uld fol­low Kyrti­an in­to the wil­der­ness-Ael­mar­kin wo­uld be per­fectly happy to en­gi­ne­er an "acci­dent" out the­re. But if, in the co­ur­se of trying to set up such an ac­ci­dent, it was Ael­mar­kin who pe­ris­hed, and Kyrti­an fo­und out abo­ut it, why wo­uld Kyrti­an hi­de it?</p>
   <p>    Why wo­uld he want to? If Ael­mar­kin we­re ho­ist upon his own pe­tard of tre­ac­hery, Kyrti­an sho­uld be only too ple­ased to trum­pet the fact to all the world.</p>
   <p>    And as for Tri­ana va­nis­hing at the sa­me ti­me-well, the only thing that Lord Kyndreth co­uld ima­gi­ne was that for so­me re­ason she had go­ne cha­sing af­ter Kyrti­an as well. Alt­ho­ugh he co­uld not ima­gi­ne why.</p>
   <p>    Kyndreth gro­und his te­eth, fe­eling frust­ra­ti­on well up in­si­de him. This was an en­ti­rely new ex­pe­ri­en­ce for him-and he didn't li­ke it. Al­ways, al­ways, from the ti­me he first ca­me to po­wer and to­ok his Co­un­cil se­at, he had known who was do­ing what, and why. Es­pe­ci­al­ly why. And now things we­re hap­pe­ning that he had not be­en told of, had not an­ti­ci­pa­ted, and worst of all, he had no re­al no­ti­on of the mo­ti­va­ti­ons that lay be­hind the­se in­ci­dents.</p>
   <p>    Motivations-what in the world co­uld ha­ve bro­ught Ael­mar­kin out in­to the wil­der­ness be­si­des hat­red for Kyrti­an? Or, for that mat­ter, Lady Tri­ana? What co­uld the two pos­sibly ha­ve in com­mon?</p>
   <p>    He clo­sed his eyes for a mo­ment, emp­ti­ed his mind, and vi­olently sup­pres­sed the emo­ti­ons that ca­me wel­ling up in the wa­ke of that frust­ra­ti­on. Emo­ti­on was not use­ful. He ne­eded lo­gic and re­ason-and abo­ve all, plan­ning.</p>
   <p>    And on­ce he cle­ared his mind of emo­ti­on, so­met­hing el­se oc­cur­red to him at long last. The one thing that Tri­ana and Ael­mar­kin did ha­ve in com­mon was the gro­up that they as­so­ci­ated with so­ci­al­ly-the yo­un­ger sons, and so­me few yo­un­ger da­ugh­ters. Un­til the Yo­ung Lords' Re­volt, that had inc­lu­ded-the re­bel­li­o­us Yo­ung Lords.</p>
   <p>    What if, rat­her than tra­iling af­ter Kyrti­an, Ael­mar­kin and Tri-ana had go­ne-qu­ite co­in­ci­den­tal­ly-into the sa­me area, in­ten­ding to me­et with the fu­gi­ti­ves?</p>
   <p>    What if Ael­mar­kin and Tri­ana had be­en the spi­es wit­hin the ranks of the Old Lords for the yo­ungs­ters?</p>
   <p>    If that was the ca­se-no won­der Ael­mar­kin had be­en so in­tent on fos­te­ring the imp­res­si­on his co­usin Kyrti­an was dotty! And no won­der he'd be­en so disg­runt­led when Kyrti­an was pla­ced in char­ge of the army!</p>
   <p>    It was only a the­ory-co­uld by no me­ans be pro­ved-but it wo­uldn't hurt to ke­ep the the­ory in re­ser­ve. It might be use­ful.</p>
   <p>    Meanwhile, he sho­uld be the one to spre­ad the news to the rest of the Co­un­cil, if at all pos­sib­le. How many ot­her Co­un­cil mem­bers had of­fsp­ring li­kely to be in­vi­ted to that abor­ted party? Not many-and no­ne we­re li­kely to ha­ve men­ti­oned the di­sap­pe­aran­ces yet.</p>
   <p>    Good. He might be swim­ming in a sea of un­cer­ta­in­ti­es, but he co­uld ma­ke so­met­hing out of this yet.</p>
   <p>    He stra­igh­te­ned his back, cal­led for strong wi­ne, and be­gan to plan what he wo­uld tell the Co­un­cil. And as he did so, he felt a fa­int smi­le cross his lips.</p>
   <p>    At the very le­ast, he wo­uld ga­in so­met­hing. Tri­ana had so­me an­ci­ent co­usin or ot­her who wo­uld swiftly cla­im her es­ta­te, but Ael­mar­kin's ne­arest re­la­ti­on was Kyrti­an… and Kyrti­an was un­li­kely to want Ael­mar­kin's tiny hol­ding or his bu­si­ness of bre­eding ple­asu­re-sla­ves. When an es­ta­te went unc­la­imed, it tra­di­ti­onal­ly went to the He­ad of the Co­un­cil.</p>
   <p>    Which was, of co­ur­se, Lord Kyndreth.</p>
   <p>    And if the­re was any qu­es­ti­on of whet­her or not it sho­uld be con­fis­ca­ted, well, Kyndreth co­uld bring up that the­ory, bran­ding Ael­mar­kin as a tra­itor, and over­tur­ning all pos­sib­le obj­ec­ti­ons to con­fis­ca­ting the pro­perty.</p>
   <p>    Kyndreth nod­ded to him­self, fe­eling firm gro­und be­ne­ath his fe­et aga­in. Go­od eno­ugh. He knew whe­re he was now. He wo­uld call the Co­un­cil Me­eting, an­no­un­ce the di­sap­pe­aran­ces, and see who re­ac­ted, and how. That wo­uld tell him a gre­at de­al-and in the me­an­ti­me, he wo­uld send his ste­wards in to ta­ke cont­rol of Ael­mar­kin's pos­ses­si­ons.</p>
   <p>    He to­ok a long bre­ath, and ke­yed the te­le­son. Sha­ke the tree, and see what fru­it fell-and how far.</p>
   <p>    And wha­te­ver hap­pe­ned, to ma­ke cer­ta­in that it pro­fi­ted him.</p>
   <p>    "Well, Ans­ter," he be­gan, when Lord Ans­ter's ser­vant had sum­mo­ned him to the te­le­son-scre­en, "it se­ems we ha­ve a mystery on our hands…"</p>
