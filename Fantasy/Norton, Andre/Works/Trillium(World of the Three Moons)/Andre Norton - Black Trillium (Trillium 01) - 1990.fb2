   <p>    The king­dom of Ru­wen­da is at­tac­ked by ne­igh­bo­ring La­bor­nok, who­se king has long be­en je­alo­us of its we­alth and pros­pe­rity. Ru­wen­da's ru­lers are bru­tal­ly sla­in, but the­ir da­ugh­ters-the three Pe­tals of the Li­ving Tril­li­um, prop­he­si­ed to sa­ve the­ir co­untry in a ti­me of pe­ril-flee to the Arc­hi­ma­ge Bi­nah, who di­rects them to the­ir ma­gic ta­lis­mans. Each ac­com­pa­ni­ed by a child­ho­od com­pa­ni­on, Od­dlings of the area's abo­ri­gi­nal ra­ces, the girls must con­qu­er the­ir we­ak­nes­ses: the el­dest, her in­tel­lec­tu­al ar­ro­gan­ce; the mid­dle sis­ter, her ten­dency to act be­fo­re thin­king; the yo­un­gest, her gre­at ti­mi­dity. The­ir ene­mi­es pur­sue them, led by a sor­ce­rer se­eking an­ci­ent sec­rets hid­den in the aban­do­ned ci­ti­es.</p>

   <p>    <emphasis>From the Pe­nin­su­lar Chro­nic­le</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Of Lam­pi­ar, La­te Sa­vant of La­bor­nok</emphasis></p>
   <p>    In the Eighth Hund­red af­ter tho­se of Ru­wen­da ca­me to ru­le over the swamp wil­der­ness cal­led the Mazy Mi­re (tho­ugh not comp­le­tely, for they ne­ver mas­te­red the int­rac­tab­le Od­dlings), le­gend and his­tory both awo­ke to re­cord one of tho­se gre­at chan­ges which now and then al­ter the very ba­lan­ce of the world.</p>
   <p>    The ci­vi­li­zed na­ti­ons of the Pe­nin­su­la -most es­pe­ci­al­ly we of ne­igh­bo­ring La­bor­nok - lo­oked upon the wet­land pla­te­au of Ru­wen­da as a frust­ra­ting and ve­xing back­wa­ter, se­eming to exist me­rely as a thorn in the flesh of mo­re ener­ge­tic and prog­res­si­ve pe­op­les. In truth, Ru­wen­da was not at all a pro­perly or­ga­ni­zed king­dom, owing to its fa­ilu­re to es­tab­lish su­ze­ra­inty over the pe­cu­li­ar abo­ri­gi­nes dwel­ling wit­hin its cla­imed bor­ders. Ins­te­ad, the Ru­wen­di­an kings comp­la­isantly al­lo­wed law­less enc­la­ves of the­se so-cal­led Od­dlings to per­sist, off­ti­mes to the det­ri­ment of the­ir le­gi­ti­ma­te su­bj­ects and the ge­ne­ral pe­ace and go­od or­der of the re­alm.</p>
   <p>    Of the­se abo­ri­gi­nal tri­bes, the bog-trot­ting lit­tle Nysso­mu and the clo­sely re­la­ted but mo­re alo­of Uis­gu (qu­ite non­hu­man and the­re­fo­re cle­arly de­sig­ned by Na­tu­re to ser­ve the­ir bet­ters) we­re de­alt with by both the crown and the merc­hant class of Ru­wen­da as pu­ta­ti­ve equ­als, alt­ho­ugh no vows of fe­alty we­re ever de­man­ded of them. In­de­ed, cer­ta­in gro­ups of Nysso­mu we­re fre­qu­ent vi­si­tors to the fa­med Ru­wen­da Ci­ta­del, and a few of the un­co­uth be­ings we­re ac­tu­al­ly ac­cep­ted as up­per ser­vants of the ro­yal co­urt!</p>
   <p>    Two ot­her Od­dling tri­bes, the mo­un­ta­in-lo­ving Vis­pi and the half-ci­vi­li­zed Wyvi­lo of the so­ut­hern ra­in­fo­rests, we­re in­hos­pi­tab­le to hu­man­kind but de­ig­ned to tra­de with Ru­wen­di­an merc­hants on a re­gu­lar ba­sis. On the ot­her hand, the sha­dowy Glis­mak, who­se jung­le ha­unts bor­de­red tho­se of the Wyvi­lo, we­re at this ti­me sel­dom en­co­un­te­red by hu­mans. They we­re vi­ci­o­us sa­va­ges who de­ligh­ted in the mas­sac­re of the­ir Od­dling ne­igh­bors. The last and lar­gest tri­be of Od­dlings, the abo­mi­nab­le Skri­tek, al­so cal­led the Drow­ners, li­ved in most parts of the swamp, but we­re par­ti­cu­larly nu­me­ro­us in the vast and no­iso­me marsh­lands so­uth of Ru­wen­da Ci­ta­del, as well as the Thorny Hell si­tu­ated in the north-cent­ral re­gi­on. The­se fi­ends of the Mazy Mi­re we­re no­to­ri­o­us way­la­yers of ca­ra­vans and at­tac­kers of iso­la­ted hu­man ma­nors and ho­mes­te­ads, eit­her drow­ning the­ir vic­tims or tor­tu­ring them with uns­pe­akab­le bru­ta­lity be­fo­re con­sig­ning them to de­ath in the qu­ick-mi­res. Yet king fol­lo­wed king on the thro­ne of Ru­wen­da, ma­king no at­tempt to cle­ar the land of that me­na­ce.</p>
   <p>    It was of­ten whis­pe­red that the wet­land rot had we­ake­ned both the minds and bo­di­es of the hu­man Ru­wen­di­ans. The­ir ru­lers we­re a hap­py-go-lucky lot, ut­ter stran­gers to pro­per fe­udal dis­cip­li­ne. When the scho­larly but obs­ti­na­te Kra­in III as­cen­ded the thro­ne, his ma­ni­fest short­sigh­ted­ness in de­aling with his ne­igh­bor na­ti­ons ma­de it cle­ar that the ti­me was ap­pro­ac­hing when mo­re en­ligh­te­ned and prog­res­si­ve met­hods wo­uld ha­ve to be ap­pli­ed to a fes­te­ring si­tu­ati­on, over which our own gre­at king­dom of La­bor­nok had ste­wed for ye­ars.</p>
   <p>    The un­for­tu­na­te fact was that La­bor­nok ne­eded what the­se feck­less and inef­fi­ci­ent ne­igh­bors had to of­fer in tra­de. Our wo­od­lands ha­ving long sin­ce be­en cut down and con­ver­ted in­to farm­land, we we­re de­pen­dent upon the Ru­wen­di­an ra­in­fo­rests not only for ship tim­ber to sus­ta­in our thri­ving ma­ri­ti­me com­mer­ce, but al­so for fi­ne wo­ods to en­han­ce and fur­nish the sta­tely bu­il­dings at De­ror­gu­ila. Al­so, by a he­art­less cap­ri­ce of na­tu­re, the La­bor­no­ki slo­pes of the im­pe­net­rab­le Oho­gan Mo­un­ta­ins we­re vir­tu­al­ly bar­ren of use­ful mi­ne­rals; whi­le the Ru­wen­di­an si­de of the ran­ge con­ta­ined lo­des of gold and pla­ti­num, as well as many kinds of va­lu­ab­le gems­to­nes, which we­re sco­ured out by the tor­rents and de­po­si­ted he­re and the­re in the mo­un­ta­ins. The pre­ci­o­us me­tals and crystals we­re hap­ha­zardly gat­he­red by the Vis­pi Od­dlings, who tra­ded them to the Uis­gu; and even­tu­al­ly they pas­sed in­to the hands of the hu­man Ru­wen­di­ans. Ot­her tra­de go­ods of the per­ver­se lit­tle king­dom inc­lu­ded va­lu­ab­le me­di­ci­nal swamp herbs and kitc­hen spi­ces, wor­rarn pelts and fe­dok skins, and cer­ta­in cu­ri­o­us an­ci­ent ar­ti­facts which the Od­dlings pro­cu­red from ru­ined ci­ti­es de­ep in the most inac­ces­sib­le re­ac­hes of the Mi­res.</p>
   <p>    Even in the best of ti­mes, com­mer­ce bet­we­en La­bor­nok and Ru­wen­da was a frust­ra­ting - oc­ca­si­onal­ly pe­ri­lo­us - bu­si­ness. Mo­re than a few of our glo­ri­o­us kings, cham­ping on the re­gal mus­tac­hes in fury over so­me pi­ece of Ru­wen­di­an in­so­len­ce, had de­man­ded that our ge­ne­rals de­vi­se a sche­me for con­qu­ering the smal­ler na­ti­on. But it is dif­fi­cult to in­va­de a co­untry to which the­re is only one do­or - the ste­ep and nar­row Vis­pir Pass thro­ugh the Oho­gans, gu­ar­ded by well-pla­ced Ru­wen­di­an forts. Tho­se La­bor­no­ki kings of me­lanc­holy me­mory who ma­de the at­tempt did not re­turn ali­ve.</p>
   <p>    Surviving mem­bers of the­ir de­fe­ated ar­mi­es told ta­les of de­mo­nic fre­ezing fogs, whirl­winds from which in­hu­man eyes se­emed to gla­re, un­se­aso­nab­le mo­un­ta­in storms with snow, sle­et, and ha­il, monst­ro­us rock sli­des, ful­mi­na­ting mur­ra­ins that struck down the war-fro­ni­als, and ot­her ca­la­mi­ti­es that had as­sa­iled them. It se­emed al­most as tho­ugh su­per­na­tu­ral for­ces we­re ar­ra­yed in op­po­si­ti­on to the in­va­si­ons. But even if the gu­ard­posts in the pass co­uld ha­ve be­en ta­ken, the sod­den mo­rass be­yond pre­sen­ted an even mo­re for­mi­dab­le obs­tac­le to an in­va­ding for­ce.</p>
   <p>    As every La­bor­no­ki Mas­ter-Tra­der knew only too well.</p>
   <p>    This auda­ci­o­us and free-whe­eling gu­ild of merc­hants, which pas­sed its franc­hi­se and cer­ta­in li­fe-pro­tec­ting in­can­ta­ti­ons from fat­her to son, inc­lu­ded the only ci­ti­zens of our king­dom who knew the sec­ret ro­ute in­to the he­art of Ru­wen­da. It was sus­pec­ted by mo­re than one La­bor­no­ki ge­ne­ral, in­fu­ri­ated and frust­ra­ted in fu­ti­le at­tempts to pry co­he­rent di­rec­ti­ons or even a use­ful map out of the un­co­ope­ra­ti­ve Mas­ters, that dark ma­gic had be­en evo­ked to lock the­ir lips du­ring qu­es­ti­oning. Even­tu­al­ly, ho­we­ver, the ro­ute wo­uld be re­ve­aled thro­ugh the craft of the mighty sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus, abo­ut whom mo­re anon. But in ear­li­er days the Mas­ters kept the­ir sec­ret well, and enj­oyed not only a pros­pe­ro­us mo­no­poly but al­so a si­zab­le me­asu­re of po­li­ti­cal po­wer.</p>
   <p>    A typi­cal ca­ra­van led by fo­ur Mas­ter-Tra­ders was small, con­sis­ting of no mo­re than twenty vo­lum­ni­al drawn wa­gons and per­haps fifty men. Af­ter gi­ving the hill-fort com­man­ders cer­ta­in pas­swords, the Mas­ters wo­uld le­ad the wa­gon-tra­in in­to the Mi­re along an un­mar­ked and tre­ac­he­ro­us ele­va­ted ro­ad­way. Only a few iso­la­ted pla­ces bet­we­en the mo­un­ta­ino­us bor­der­lands and the Ru­wen­da Ci­ta­del two hund­red le­agu­es hen­ce we­re bles­sed with so­lid, un­qu­akab­le land. The lar­gest dry re­gi­on, lying east of the Tra­de Ro­ad, was the Dylex Co­untry, whe­re pol­ders or di­ked and dra­ined fi­elds con­ta­ined well-cul­ti­va­ted farms, pas­tu­res, and scat­te­red towns­hips. Virk, the lar­gest of the­se, en­ga­ged in the simp­le re­fi­ning of mi­ne­rals bro­ught in by the Uis­gu or Nysso­mu Od­dlings and was a se­con­dary cen­ter of the Ru­wen­da gem and pre­ci­o­us me­tal tra­de. By far the gre­ater por­ti­on of this com­mer­ce, ho­we­ver, to­ok pla­ce at the Ci­ta­del, the ca­pi­tal of Ru­wen­da, which perc­hed upon a si­zab­le rock do­me upth­rust in the midst of the Mazy Mi­re.</p>
   <p>    Once at the Ci­ta­del, Mas­ter-Tra­ders pa­id the ro­yal ro­ad-tax. (They al­so pa­id a cap­ri­ci­o­usly va­ri­ab­le who­le­sa­le go­ods tax upon de­par­tu­re, one of the gre­at so­re po­ints in Ru­wen­di­an-La­bor­no­ki re­la­ti­ons.) Then they we­re free to sell the­ir own merc­han­di­se in the gre­at Ci­ta­del Mar­ket, af­ter which they might pro­ce­ed to com­mo­dity exc­han­ges de­aling in mi­ne­rals or tim­ber. The lat­ter was ob­ta­ined by Ru­wen­di­an agents from the fo­rest-dwel­ling Wyvi­lo Od­dlings. Mas­ters in se­arch of mo­re exo­tic tra­de go­ods wo­uld tra­vel so­me one hund­red le­agu­es furt­her, via Ru­wen­di­an punt or flat­bo­at, up the slug­gish Lo­wer Mu­tar Ri­ver to its conf­lu­en­ce with the Vis­par, whe­re lay the ru­ined city of Tre­vis­ta - and in its pla­zas, the fa­bu­lo­us tra­ding fa­irs of the swamp Od­dlings. The­se fa­irs we­re held only du­ring the dry se­asons, sin­ce the mon­so­ons ro­aring up from the So­ut­hern Sea ot­her­wi­se ma­de pas­sa­ge of the bog­land wa­ter­co­ur­ses im­pos­sib­le. Only the Od­dlings ven­tu­red abo­ut the Mazy Mi­re then, by ways they knew and met­hods they had per­fec­ted many hund­reds ago.</p>
   <p>    Trevista re­ma­ins one of the gre­at myste­ri­es of our Pe­nin­su­la. It is of uni­ma­gi­nab­le age, and bre­ath­ta­kingly be­a­uti­ful even in its pre­sent sta­te of ne­ar-to­tal di­la­pi­da­ti­on. The laby­rint­hi­ne ca­nals, crumb­ling brid­ges, and ma­j­es­tic ru­ined bu­il­dings are overg­rown with a pro­fu­si­on of ex­qu­isi­te jung­le flo­wers. Eno­ugh of the ori­gi­nal ur­ban de­sign re­ma­ins to de­monst­ra­te that Tre­vis­ta's bu­il­ders pos­ses­sed a sop­his­ti­ca­ti­on and a tech­ni­cal ex­per­ti­se far abo­ve that of the most ad­van­ced Pe­nin­su­lar ci­vi­li­za­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    There is spe­cu­la­ti­on by tho­se in­te­res­ted in such mat­ters that most of Ru­wen­da was on­ce a hu­ge gla­ci­er-fed la­ke dot­ted with is­lands that are now me­re ele­va­ti­ons in the swamp. Many of the­se are known to be crow­ned by si­mi­lar ru­ins. Even the Od­dlings are unab­le to ac­co­unt for the an­ci­ent ci­ti­es, sa­ying only that they we­re bu­ilt by the Va­nis­hed Ones, and exis­ted when the­ir an­ces­tors ca­me in­to the swamp co­untry. Ru­wen­da Ci­ta­del it­self, a ve­ri­tab­le mo­un­ta­in of int­ri­ca­te sto­ne walls, bas­ti­ons, ke­eps, to­wers, and in­ter­con­nec­ted bu­il­dings, al­so da­tes from re­mo­te an­ti­qu­ity and is sa­id to ha­ve be­en the se­at of wha­te­ver pri­mor­di­al ru­lers the Pe­nin­su­la then bo­wed to.</p>
   <p>    The mo­re iso­la­ted ru­ins, ac­ces­sib­le only to the abo­ri­gi­nes, we­re the so­ur­ce of the most co­ve­ted tra­de items -anti­que art-obj­ects and myste­ri­o­us small mec­ha­nisms which bro­ught very high pri­ces, not only from col­lec­tors in La­bor­nok, but al­so from wo­uld-be stu­dents of oc­cult know­led­ge in the fart­hest re­ac­hes of the known world. This tra­de, for re­asons that will be­co­me pla­in, lan­gu­is­hed af­ter Crown Prin­ce Volt­rik be­ca­me he­ir to the thro­ne of La­bor­nok and set in mo­ti­on events that wo­uld bring abo­ut the long-awa­ited con­qu­est of our pes­ti­len­ti­al lit­tle so­ut­hern ne­igh­bor.</p>
   <p>    Voltrik was for­ced to wa­it a long ti­me for his crown, sin­ce his unc­le, King Spo­ri­kar, li­ved well over his one hund­red al­lot­ted ye­ars. Du­ring this ti­me of wa­iting, Volt­rik di­ver­ted him­self by plan­ning the ac­qu­isi­ti­on of yet anot­her crown, and al­so tra­ve­led wi­dely. From one such ex­pe­di­ti­on to the lands north of Rak­tum he re­tur­ned with a new com­pa­ni­on who was to pro­vi­de him with the key to Ru­wen­da - the sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus.</p>
   <p>    Voltrik was then in his eight-and-thir­ti­eth ye­ar, a man of for­mi­dab­le physi­cal pre­sen­ce, black-be­ar­ded and gra­ni­ti­cal­ly hand­so­me, with a tem­per as unp­re­dic­tab­le and shoc­king as a thun­derc­lap. His first wi­fe, the be­lo­ved Prin­cess Jane­el, di­ed gi­ving birth to Volt­rik's only son, An­tar. His se­cond wi­fe, Shon­da, pe­ris­hed un­der sus­pi­ci­o­us cir­cums­tan­ces whi­le on a lot­hok hunt, ha­ving fa­iled to con­ce­ive af­ter ten ye­ars of mar­ri­age. The fri­vo­lo­us Prin­cess Na­ri­ce, his third wi­fe, suf­fe­red the pe­nalty for high tre­ason af­ter at­temp­ting to run away with an equ­er­ry. She and her pa­ra­mo­ur we­re tumb­led to­get­her in a lar­ge sack of thorn-fle­ece, and then burnt ali­ve.</p>
   <p>    The sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus be­ca­me Volt­rik's chi­ef ad­vi­ser and be­fo­re long com­man­ded res­pect and fe­ar thro­ug­ho­ut all La­bor­nok. It was he who ur­ged the Crown Prin­ce to bi­de his ti­me be­fo­re ta­king a fo­urth bri­de, and pos­sess his so­ul in pa­ti­en­ce if he wis­hed to see his gre­at am­bi­ti­ons ful­fil­led.</p>
   <p>    (Prudently, the ma­gi­ci­an did not disc­lo­se to the im­pe­tu­o­us Prin­ce that he wo­uld ha­ve to wa­it anot­her se­ven­te­en ye­ars for the dod­de­ring King Spo­ri­kar to die.)</p>
   <p>    In the me­an­ti­me, Oro­gas­tus es­tab­lis­hed a strong­hold high on the nort­hern slo­pe of the Oho­gan Mo­un­ta­ins on the flank of Mo­unt Brom, whe­re he set abo­ut to per­fect his ma­gi­cal arts. All unu­su­al an­ti­que ar­ti­facts pro­cu­red by the Mas­ter-Tra­ders of La­bor­nok from the swamp Od­dlings now ca­me di­rectly in­to his hands, for a vi­si­on had hin­ted to him that enor­mo­us po­wer might be tap­ped thro­ugh cer­ta­in of the cu­ri­o­us de­vi­ces. Oro­gas­tus la­ter to­ok as as­sis­tants three si­nis­ter in­di­vi­du­als who we­re known as his Vo­ices. They ser­ved as the sor­ce­rer's acoly­tes and agents, and we­re fe­ared very ne­arly as much as the­ir mas­ter.</p>
   <p>    On the op­po­si­te slo­pe of the ice-crow­ned Oho­gan Mo­un­ta­ins, in the Ru­wen­di­an fo­ot­hil­ls whe­re the Ri­ver Not­har's pre­ci­pi­to­us des­cent eased and the wa­ter­co­ur­se bro­ade­ned, lay the ho­me of anot­her oc­cult prac­ti­ti­oner. She was the Arc­hi­ma­ge Bi­nah, al­so cal­led the Whi­te Lady, who had li­ved for un­told ye­ars in the ru­ins of Noth, one of the an­ci­ent ci­ti­es of the Va­nis­hed Ones. She was lit­tle mo­re than a le­gend to the hu­man po­pu­la­ti­on of Ru­wen­da, who­se com­mon pe­op­le ne­ver saw her. Yet they per­sis­tently in­vo­ked her na­me in ti­mes of tro­ub­le, and had re­ve­red her as the gu­ar­di­an of the­ir land from ti­me im­me­mo­ri­al.</p>
   <p>    Only the Od­dlings and the Ru­wen­di­an ro­yalty knew the truth that lay be­hind the le­gend: It was Bi­nah?s be­ne­vo­lent enc­hant­ment, not the dif­fi­cult ter­ra­in, the hu­man for­ti­fi­ca­ti­ons, inc­le­ment we­at­her, nor na­tu­ral di­sas­ters, that had kept the Mazy Mi­re sa­fe from wo­uld-be des­po­ilers. But the we­ight of ye­ars bows down the wi­el­ders of ma­gic even as it do­es tho­se who do not exer­ci­se the po­wers. Du­ring the re­ign of Kra­in III the un­de­tec­ted sa­fe­gu­ards Bi­nah had set up aro­und Ru­wen­da be­ca­me inc­re­asingly mo­re dif­fi­cult for her to ma­in­ta­in. And as her fa­cul­ti­es wa­ned, tho­se of the evil Oro­gas­tus be­ca­me stron­ger and stron­ger.</p>
   <p>    There ca­me a ti­me when Qu­e­en Ka­lant­he of Ru­wen­da was fi­nal­ly bro­ught to child­bed af­ter many ye­ars of bar­ren­ness, and all was not go­ing well. King Kra­in knelt be­si­de his stric­ken wi­fe and cal­led upon po­wers long ne­ar for­got­ten, which he had not na­med sin­ce child­ho­od. Out of the night-murk which hung thick and stag­nant over the gre­at swamp ca­me a bird so im­men­se that, with its wings spre­ad, it co­uld ha­ve co­ve­red most of the Ci­ta­del's High To­wer ro­of. Be­yond a do­ubt it was one of the awe­so­me lam­mer­ge­i­ers that ha­un­ted the most inac­ces­sib­le crags of the Oho­gan Ran­ge. From its back the Arc­hi­ma­ge Bi­nah dis­mo­un­ted, and tho­se on gu­ard and tho­se in ser­vi­ce in the halls we­re awest­ruck and fell to the­ir kne­es at the sight of her. In ap­pe­aran­ce she se­emed to be only an aged wo­man, clad in a sil­ver-bor­de­red whi­te clo­ak that chan­ged with mo­ve­ment to that pa­le blue so­me­ti­mes se­en in snow sha­dows; but the­re was so­met­hing abo­ut her that mu­ted all qu­es­ti­on, and it was unt­hin­kab­le that an­yo­ne sho­uld try to stop or hin­der her as she hur­ri­ed to the bed­si­de of the Qu­e­en.</p>
   <p>    Those who sto­od clo­se to the suf­fe­ring lady now wept and sig­hed and pra­yed alo­ud, for it was pla­in that Ka­lant­he was unab­le to bring forth the new li­fe that strug­gled for exis­ten­ce wit­hin her, and was nigh un­to de­ath. Her be­a­uti­ful rus­set ha­ir was dar­ke­ned and plas­te­red to her he­ad by the swe­at of her or­de­al, and she grip­ped King Kra­in's hand as one drow­ning might cling to a ro­pe.</p>
   <p>    Drawing ne­ar, the Arc­hi­ma­ge sa­id: "Be at pe­ace. All will yet be well. Ka­lant­he, de­ar da­ugh­ter, lo­ok at me."</p>
   <p>    The Qu­e­en's eyes ope­ned wi­de and her mo­aning ce­ased. Po­or Kra­in did not want to le­ave his wi­fe's si­de, but a sing­le ges­tu­re from the Arc­hi­ma­ge fil­led him with sud­den ho­pe and he step­ped back, mo­ti­oning the co­ur­ti­ers and the Qu­e­en's wo­men to ma­ke ro­om for the vi­si­tor.</p>
   <p>    The ro­yal mid­wi­fe, who was an Od­dling na­med Im­mu, sto­od by hol­ding a gob­let con­ta­ining a po­ti­on of herbs, which she had not be­en ab­le to get the Qu­e­en to swal­low. The Arc­hi­ma­ge Bi­nah bec­ko­ned the lit­tle non­hu­man fe­ma­le to co­me for­ward and ra­ise the cup, and then the­re was re­ve­aled a gre­at won­der. All who we­re in the ro­om, even the dying Qu­e­en, ut­te­red cri­es of ama­ze­ment, for Bi­nah held over the gob­let a Black Tril­li­um plant - ro­ot, le­aves, and a sing­le tri­par­ti­te blos­som-a fab­led swamp­herb so ra­re that not even the pa­la­ce Od­dlings co­uld say whe­re or if it still grew. Yet this sa­me plant was the bad­ge of the Ru­wen­di­an ro­yal ho­use, and among the most pre­ci­o­us of the crown jewels we­re cer­ta­in pi­eces of ho­ney-amber, which had em­bed­ded in them mi­nu­te fos­sil spe­ci­mens of the blo­om, no lar­ger than the he­ad of a pin.</p>
   <p>    But this flo­wer was not small. It was fully as wi­de as the palm of the Arc­hi­ma­ge's hand and of a rich black de­eper than silk vel­vet. Bi­nah pluc­ked the tril­li­um blos­som and drop­ped it in­to the cup, but the plant she hid away be­ne­ath her clo­ak. She wa­ited for the co­un­ting of ten bre­aths whi­le the flo­wer dis­sol­ved, then to­ok the cup of ti­sa­ne from the Od­dling mid­wi­fe and sig­na­led to the King.</p>
   <p>    Krain rus­hed for­ward, ra­ised his de­ar lady in his arms, and sup­por­ted her whi­le she sip­ped at the drink and then drank ste­adily un­til the gob­let was empty.</p>
   <p>    The Qu­e­en now lay back upon her pil­lows. Sud­denly she ut­te­red a mighty cry- not of pa­in but rat­her of tri­umph - and the mid­wi­fe Im­mu sa­id: "She is gi­ving birth!"</p>
   <p>    Three Prin­ces­ses, one ba­be fol­lo­wing swiftly upon anot­her, ap­pe­ared. And this was a gre­at pro­digy sin­ce mul­tip­le births are un­com­mon among the hu­man aris­toc­racy.</p>
   <p>    The ba­bes cri­ed lus­tily, and alt­ho­ugh small we­re per­fect in form, each dif­fe­ring slightly in fe­atu­re and co­lo­ring from the ot­her. As each Prin­cess was wel­co­med in­to the wa­iting birth-cloth the Arc­hi­ma­ge spo­ke a na­me and la­id upon the small bre­ast a stran­gely wro­ught gol­den pen­dant in­la­id with ho­ney-amber, con­ta­ining a bud of the Black Tril­li­um flo­wer.</p>
   <p>    "Haramis," she sa­id to the first child, in the to­ne of one wel­co­ming a be­lo­ved fri­end or fos­ter­ling; and "Ka­di­ya" she ha­iled the se­cond; whi­le "Ani­gel" gre­eted the third.</p>
   <p>    Then she lo­oked be­yond the in­fants to the King and Qu­e­en, who both we­re sta­ring at her in won­der, and spo­ke with such a no­te of fo­re­bo­ding in her vo­ice as to imp­ress her words de­eply upon the me­mo­ri­es of all who he­ard them.</p>
   <p>    "Years co­me and go with spe­ed. That which is lofty may fall, that which is che­ris­hed may be lost, that which is hid­den must, in ti­me, be re­ve­aled. And yet I tell you that all will be well. My day sli­des now in­to eve­ning, alt­ho­ugh I shall do what I must and can un­til the co­ming of full night. The­se three Pe­tals of the Li­ving Tril­li­um, child­ren of yo­ur ho­use, Kra­in and Ka­lant­he, ha­ve a fe­ar­so­me des­tiny awa­iting them and ter­rib­le tasks, but the ti­me for that is not yet."</p>
   <p>    Before the King and Qu­e­en co­uld ask the me­aning of her war­ning, the Arc­hi­ma­ge Bi­nah tur­ned and went swiftly from the ro­om. The how­ling ba­bes and the ne­ces­sary du­ti­es at­ten­ding the Qu­e­en's de­li­ve­ran­ce fully oc­cu­pi­ed the ro­yal wo­men and the mid­wi­fe Im­mu, whi­le the King went forth to an­no­un­ce the joy­ful news and proc­la­im a ti­me of ce­leb­ra­ti­on. The ma­gi­cal tril­li­um amu­lets we­re hung on fi­ne gol­den cha­ins, and the Prin­ces­ses wo­re them wa­king or sle­eping.</p>
   <p>    As the Arc­hi­ma­ge had sa­id, ti­me pas­ses; and with it tre­ads al­so a me­asu­re of for­get­ful­ness. The three Prin­ces­ses grew up to be strong and be­a­uti­ful girls, who he­ard of­ten from the­ir nur­ses and the­ir pa­rents the story of that stran­ge sce­ne at­ten­ding the­ir birth. Ho­we­ver, to the girls it be­gan to se­em mo­re and mo­re to be a fan­ci­ful ta­le, es­pe­ci­al­ly the ba­le­ful war­ning, for the­re was not­hing to dis­turb the com­fort of the­ir days as they ma­tu­red, and li­ke most yo­ung pe­op­le they we­re much mo­re in­te­res­ted in the pre­sent than the past.</p>
   <p>    Princess Ha­ra­mis was her scho­larly fat­her's fa­vo­ri­te. Whi­le she was yet a small child, she cra­ved such know­led­ge as is to be fo­und in bo­oks, pes­te­ring the ro­yal scri­bes and sa­ges with qu­es­ti­ons un­be­co­ming to ro­yal fe­ma­les. She al­so fo­und ma­gic in mu­sic, es­pe­ci­al­ly that drawn from the flu­te and the strings of the la­du-wo­od harp. She spent much of her ti­me with the Od­dling Uzun, who was a fa­mo­us sin­ger of songs and ra­con­te­ur. He co­uld chan­ge the most me­lanc­holy mo­od in­to one of go­od che­er thro­ugh his jol­ly ta­le-spin­ning and wi­se co­un­sel.</p>
   <p>    Princess Ka­di­ya early pro­ved to be a lo­ver of ani­mals and birds, es­pe­ci­al­ly the qu­e­er cre­atu­res of the de­ep swamp. Her pas­si­on was to li­ve un­der the open sky and exp­lo­re the wil­der re­ac­hes of the re­alm, and for her gu­ide and te­ac­her in mat­ters of na­tu­ral his­tory she tur­ned to the Od­dling Jagun, who was the ro­yal Mas­ter of Ani­mals and chi­ef hunts­man of the Ci­ta­del.</p>
   <p>    Princess Ani­gel, as da­inty and de­li­ca­te as one of the flo­wers she lo­ved so much, was a shy child, alt­ho­ugh much gi­ven to la­ugh­ter, and had a ten­der he­art that went out to any sick or suf­fe­ring thing. She was a spe­ci­al de­light to Qu­e­en Ka­lant­he, ta­king ple­asu­re in do­mes­tic and ce­re­mo­ni­al du­ti­es that her sis­ters scor­ned. Her clo­sest fri­end was that sa­me Im­mu who had be­en the ro­yal mid­wi­fe and her nur­se, who now ser­ved as the Ci­ta­del apot­he­cary, bre­wing not only po­ti­ons and simp­les but al­so swe­et per­fu­mes, con­fec­ti­onary es­sen­ces, and very go­od be­er.</p>
   <p>    The ti­me ca­me when the three Prin­ces­ses we­re of mar­ri­age­ab­le age, Ru­wen­da ha­ving pros­pe­red for se­ven­te­en ye­ars at the ex­pen­se of La­bor­nok. At the be­hest of the sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus, Crown Prin­ce Volt­rik su­ed for the hand of Ha­ra­mis, the he­iress. To his fury he was re­j­ec­ted, King Kra­in ha­ving de­ci­ded that, fa­iling a ma­le he­ir, he wo­uld on the next Fe­ast of the Three Mo­ons bet­roth his el­dest da­ugh­ter to the se­cond son of King Fi­ode­lon of Var. This Prin­ce, na­med Fi­oma­kai, wo­uld then sha­re the Ru­wen­di­an thro­ne as co-mo­narch with Ha­ra­mis. The na­ti­on of Var, lying to the so­uth of the Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest on the fer­ti­le pla­in of the Gre­at Mu­tar, had very lit­tle com­mer­ci­al or dip­lo­ma­tic in­ter­co­ur­se with Ru­wen­da. (It was, ho­we­ver, a no­tab­le ma­ri­ti­me tra­de ri­val of La­bor­nok!) But if the sa­va­ge Glis­mak Od­dlings co­uld ever be sub­du­ed and the Gre­at Mu­tar sub­se­qu­ently ope­ned to the mer­can­ti­le ves­sels of Var, La­bor­nok might very well find the luc­ra­ti­ve Ru­wen­di­an tra­de cut out from un­der it…</p>
   <p>    At this cri­ti­cal junc­ti­on in Pe­nin­su­lar his­tory, old King Spo­ri­kar fi­nal­ly clo­sed his eyes to the world and Volt­rik be­ca­me King of La­bor­nok. At the ur­ging of Oro­gas­tus, his newly ap­po­in­ted Grand Mi­nis­ter of Sta­te, Volt­rik sum­mo­ned his grown son Crown Prin­ce An­tar and the La­bor­no­ki com­man­der-in-chi­ef Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil. He told them to pre­pa­re for the im­me­di­ate in­va­si­on of Ru­wen­da.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter One</strong></p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Once aga­in, from down in the outer ward of the be­le­agu­ered Ci­ta­del, a bla­zing blue-whi­te light daz­zled the eyes of the watc­hing ro­yal fa­mily, and tho­se of the co­ur­ti­ers and the Oat­hed Com­pa­ni­ons gat­he­red with them on a bal­cony at the mid-le­vel of the gre­at ke­ep. An at­ten­dant clap of thun­der hit the­ir ears a split se­cond la­ter.</p>
   <p>    King Kra­in ut­te­red a gro­an of des­pa­ir. "By the Whi­te Lady, this ti­me the­re can be no do­ubt! The sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus has in­de­ed cal­led down light­ning from a cle­ar sky, and this stro­ke has bre­ac­hed the wall of the in­ner ward!"</p>
   <p>    Labornoki fo­ot sol­di­ery ca­me sur­ging by the hund­reds thro­ugh the bro­ad, newly ma­de gap. They we­re clo­sely fol­lo­wed by mo­un­ted knights led by the bru­tal Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil. The char­ging at­tac­kers flat­te­ned the va­li­ant Ci­ta­del de­fen­ders as easily as the hur­ri­ca­ne blasts marshg­rass. Mo­ments la­ter the­re was a third blin­ding ma­gi­cal flash, and then a fo­urth, and af­ter each one enemy hor­des po­ured thro­ugh fresh bre­aks in the for­ti­fi­ca­ti­ons.</p>
   <p>    "It is the end," sa­id the King. "If that an­ci­ent ram­part with its mul­tip­le bas­ti­ons can be pi­er­ced by the un­can­ny bolts of Oro­gas­tus, then the­re is no way the gre­at ke­ep it­self can long re­ma­in se­cu­re."</p>
   <p>    He tur­ned to one of the Oat­hed Com­pa­ni­ons. "Lord So­to­la­in, bring my ar­mor. And you, Lord Ma­no­pa­ro, I char­ge with the sa­fety of our de­ar Qu­e­en and Prin­ces­ses. Ta­ke them to the in­ner­most strong­hold of the ke­ep, whe­re you and yo­ur knights must de­fend them to the last drop of yo­ur blo­od. The rest of you, pre­pa­re to en­ga­ge the foe at my si­de."</p>
   <p>    Queen Ka­lant­he simply nod­ded; but Prin­cess Ani­gel bro­ke out in pi­te­o­us we­eping, and so did the la­di­es-in-wa­iting. Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis sto­od li­ke a frow­ning ima­ge of marb­le, only her gre­at blue eyes and shi­ning black tres­ses re­li­eving the pal­lor of her skin and the whi­te gown and clo­ak she wo­re. Prin­cess Ka­di­ya, dres­sed in her man­nish gre­en le­at­her hun­ting kit, uns­he­at­hed her dag­ger and bran­dis­hed it.</p>
   <p>    "Sire -de­ar Fat­her! -let me fight and fall at yo­ur si­de! Rat­her this than I co­wer away with sni­ve­ling wo­men whi­le the flat­lan­der bas­tards con­qu­er Ru­wen­da!"</p>
   <p>    The Qu­e­en and the nob­les gas­ped, and Prin­cess Ani­gel and the la­di­es left off the­ir be­wa­iling in as­to­nish­ment.</p>
   <p>    Princess Ha­ra­mis only smi­led coldly. "I think, Sis­ter, that you put rash stock in yo­ur pro­wess as a figh­ter. The­se are not lar­val raf­fins fle­e­ing yo­ur toy spe­ar in a hunt, but ar­med stal­warts of King Volt­rik shi­el­ded by the enc­hant­ment of a black-he­ar­ted sor­ce­rer."</p>
   <p>    "It is sa­id by the Od­dlings," Ka­di­ya re­tor­ted, "that a wo­man of the ro­yal ho­use of Ru­wen­da shall bring abo­ut the fall of La­bor­nok by sla­ying its wic­ked king!"</p>
   <p>    "And you ha­ve no­mi­na­ted yo­ur­self as our sa­vi­or?" Ha­ra­mis ut­te­red a bit­ter la­ugh, and then te­ars sprang in­to her eyes, spark­ling li­ke a fres­het bat­hing blue gla­ci­er ice. She cri­ed: "Le­ave be, silly one! Spa­re us yo­ur fo­olish pos­tu­ring. Can't you see how you dist­ress our Mot­her?"</p>
   <p>    The Qu­e­en drew her­self up pro­udly. She, li­ke Ani­gel, wo­re the tra­di­ti­onal Ru­wen­di­an co­urt day-dress of una­dor­ned sa­tin, with its lat­ti­ce-smoc­ked sle­eves and bo­di­ce. The girl's dress was a soft ro­se-co­lor; but that mor­ning the Qu­e­en had bid her hand­ma­idens ti­re her in a gown and ca­pe as crim­son as blo­od.</p>
   <p>    Kalanthe sa­id: "My he­art is fil­led with sor­row and fe­ar for all of us, but I know my duty. Ka­di­ya, put not yo­ur fa­ith in Od­dling prop­he­ci­es. Our Nysso­mu ser­vants ha­ve fled the Ci­ta­del for the sa­fety of the Mazy Mi­re, le­aving us to fa­ce the foe. As to yo­ur war­ri­or pre­ten­si­ons…" She be­gan to co­ugh, for bil­lows of smo­ke we­re ri­sing up the wall as ot­her ma­gi­cal de­vi­ces of the in­va­ders cast fi­re­bal­ls that ig­ni­ted the wo­oden bu­il­dings of the in­ner ward. "You must re­ma­in with us, as be­fits yo­ur rank and sta­ti­on."</p>
   <p>    "Then I will be <emphasis>yo­ur</emphasis> de­fen­der," cri­ed Prin­cess Ka­di­ya, "and that of my sis­ters. For if the Od­dling prop­hecy is known to King Volt­rik, then he da­re not le­ave one of us ro­yal wo­men ali­ve! I in­tend to sell my li­fe de­arly, and I will jo­in Lord Ma­no­pa­ro and the Oat­hed Com­pa­ni­ons shi­el­ding you, and die with them if fa­te dec­re­es."</p>
   <p>    "Oh, Ka­di, you can't!" sob­bed the Prin­cess Ani­gel. "We must hi­de and pray for the Whi­te Lady to res­cue us!"</p>
   <p>    "The Whi­te Lady is a myth!" Ka­di­ya sa­id. "We can only sa­ve our­sel­ves."</p>
   <p>    "She is no myth," Ani­gel mur­mu­red, so softly that her vo­ice was al­most drow­ned in the cla­mor of the figh­ting go­ing on twenty ells be­ne­ath.</p>
   <p>    "Perhaps not," Ha­ra­mis con­ce­ded, "but it se­ems that she has ab­di­ca­ted her gu­ar­di­ans­hip of this un­hap­py co­untry. How el­se co­uld the La­bor­no­ki host ha­ve cros­sed the pass, tra­ver­sed the Mi­re, and fal­len upon the Ci­ta­del with im­pu­nity?"</p>
   <p>    "My da­ugh­ters, be si­lent!" sa­id the King. "The enemy will at­tack the ke­ep at any ti­me, and I must so­on le­ave you."</p>
   <p>    He ba­de them all withd­raw from the open bal­cony in­to the cham­ber be­yond, which had be­en fur­nis­hed as a so­lar for the ro­yal wo­men. The bright sil­ken cus­hi­ons and gil­ded cha­irs had be­en kic­ked asi­de by ma­iled fe­et, and a ta­pestry fra­me lay sadly over­tur­ned ne­ar the cold he­arth, to­get­her with aban­do­ned bo­oks and a dul­ci­mer with its pa­in­ted so­un­ding-bo­ard all crac­ked. The King now ad­dres­sed him­self to his se­cond da­ugh­ter, spe­aking with gre­at stern­ness.</p>
   <p>    "Kadiya, you do ill to dis­may yo­ur mot­her and sis­ters with fo­ol­hardy be­ha­vi­or and talk of Od­dling non­sen­se. Wo­uld King Volt­rik ha­ve as­ked for Ha­ra­mis's hand if he ga­ve cre­den­ce to this fa­iry­ta­le abo­ut fe­ma­le war­ri­ors? It is my duty as lord of this re­alm to de­fend it or pe­rish in the trying. But it is yo­ur duty to li­ve and com­fort yo­ur mot­her and sis­ters. And be as­su­red that yo­ur bur­den is ligh­ter than that of our po­or Ha­ra­mis, who will no do­ubt in the end ha­ve to sub­mit to Volt­rik af­ter all."</p>
   <p>    At that all of the la­di­es-in-wa­iting burst in­to fresh wa­ils, and the knights be­gan to sho­ut, and the­re was such a tu­mult of we­eping and cri­es of "Nay, ne­ver!" that they scar­cely he­ard the new fu­sil­la­de of smal­ler oc­cult exp­lo­si­ons out­si­de, and the clash of arms, and the scre­ams of the wo­un­ded and dying.</p>
   <p>    "Quiet! Qu­i­et, all of you!" cri­ed King Kra­in.</p>
   <p>    But they wo­uld not, for he was not a mo­narch who ru­led ab­so­lu­tely, thro­ugh for­ce of cha­rac­ter, but rat­her one who had al­ways en­co­ura­ged his su­bj­ects to tre­at him as a fat­her and ad­vi­ser.</p>
   <p>    For fo­ur hund­reds, ever sin­ce the fa­iled in­va­si­on of La­bor­nok's King Pri­bi­nik the Fo­ol­hardy, the na­ti­on had be­en at pe­ace. Cri­me and do­mes­tic stri­fe had be­en al­most no­ne­xis­tent in Ru­wen­da - ex­cept for the oc­ca­si­onal thi­ef or ho­mi­ci­dal mad­man, and the se­aso­nal dep­re­da­ti­ons of the abo­mi­nab­le Skri­tek, which ga­ve an ex­cu­se for knightly qu­ests. Du­ring the ex­ten­ded pe­ace­ti­me mi­li­tary sci­en­ce had lan­gu­is­hed and the Oat­hed Com­pa­ni­ons for­got all they had ever known of stra­tegy or tac­tics. The Kings of Ru­wen­da let the­ir su­bj­ects do al­most as they ple­ased, pro­vi­ded that jus­ti­ce and tran­qu­ility ge­ne­ral­ly pre­va­iled and the usu­al re­ve­nu­es po­ured in­to the ro­yal tre­asury. Tra­di­ti­onal­ly, Ru­wen­da had no stan­ding army. The Oat­hed Com­pa­ni­ons we­re the de­sig­na­ted en­for­ce­ment arm of the thro­ne, and the hill forts we­re man­ned by ro­ta­ting cad­res of free ci­ti­zens from the Dylex Co­untry, who we­re ex­cu­sed from ta­xes the­reby. Ru­wen­di­an lords and la­di­es of the ma­nor go­ver­ned the­ir tiny fi­ef­doms with a light hand, fol­lo­wing the examp­le of the thro­ne, and ever­yo­ne had pros­pe­red ex­cept the lazy, who did not de­ser­ve to.</p>
   <p>    Isolated lit­tle Ru­wen­da had se­emed to be the hap­pi­est land in the en­ti­re Pe­nin­su­la, if not in the known world… un­til the ma­gic spells of Oro­gas­tus un­loc­ked the Vis­pir Pass to co­ve­to­us La­bor­nok and tra­ced out the sec­ret ro­ute that King Volt­rik's army had fol­lo­wed thro­ugh the Mazy Mi­re to the Ci­ta­del.</p>
   <p>    Ten days was all it had ta­ken. No­ne of the ma­gi­cal storms or fog-phan­toms or ot­her di­sas­ters that had de­fe­ated King Pri­bi­nik pla­gu­ed Volt­rik. In fact, the abo­mi­nab­le Skri­tek them­sel­ves we­re ru­mo­red to ha­ve al­li­ed with him! Un­der the aegis of the sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus, La­bor­no­ki for­ces had qu­ickly re­du­ced the hill forts to rub­ble, sac­ked the ne­arby Dylex towns­hips and sent the­ir in­ha­bi­tants fle­e­ing to the re­mo­te eas­tern co­un­ti­es, and co­me al­most wit­ho­ut hind­ran­ce to the outer bul­warks of the an­ci­ent Ci­ta­del it­self. So­on it wo­uld fall to Volt­rik, and the king­dom with it.</p>
   <p>    As the be­le­agu­ered Ru­wen­di­an ro­yalty and the­ir co­ur­ti­ers wrang­led and wept, the­re sud­denly ca­me anot­her tre­men­do­us flash of light and an ear-split­ting de­to­na­ti­on. The thick walls of the ke­ep sho­ok li­ke a wat­tle hut be­fo­re the win­ter mon­so­on. For an ins­tant shoc­ked si­len­ce pre­va­iled wit­hin and wit­ho­ut the Ci­ta­del. Then from be­low aro­se a ro­ar from ten tho­usand thro­ats and a tri­ump­hant so­un­ding of bug­le horns. It was pla­in that the ga­te of the hu­ge cent­ral struc­tu­re it­self had be­en blas­ted open and the in­va­ders we­re rus­hing in­si­de.</p>
   <p>    Now Lord So­to­la­in ca­me with the King's ar­mor and qu­ickly hel­ped him to har­ness, and Kra­in sig­hed as he hef­ted the he­avy sword of his gre­at-gre­at-gre­at-grand­si­re Ka­ra­bor­lo, which he and his Com­pa­ni­ons knew he wo­uld wi­eld bra­vely but ineptly. Ne­it­her the mag­ni­fi­cent su­it of shi­ning ste­el in­set with sap­phi­res nor the crow­ned bat­tle-hel­met with its ef­figy of a pla­ti­num lam­mer­ge­i­er co­uld ma­ke King Kra­in mo­re than he was - a mild-tem­pe­red mid­dle-aged man, gre­at of he­art and mind but ho­pe­les­sly un­fit to be a war­ri­or.</p>
   <p>    When his helm had be­en la­ced on he ma­de his fi­nal fa­re­well to his fa­mily. "I ha­ve be­en a scho­lar and not a figh­ter, and this I do not reg­ret. For long ge­ne­ra­ti­ons our be­lo­ved land has known only pe­ace. We ha­ve be­en pro­tec­ted - or so we we­re ta­ught to be­li­eve - by the Arc­hi­ma­ge Bi­nah: she who is cal­led the Whi­te Lady, the Lady of the Flo­wer, the Gu­ar­di­an, the Ke­eper of the Black Tril­li­um. Num­bers of us stan­ding he­re on this day of mis­for­tu­ne saw her and he­ard her as she wro­ught mar­ve­lo­usly at the birth of our trip­let Prin­ces­ses. The Arc­hi­ma­ge told us that all wo­uld be well, but she al­so spo­ke myste­ri­o­usly of a par­ti­cu­lar des­tiny and dre­ad­ful tasks awa­iting the ro­yal da­ugh­ters. We did not un­ders­tand her words, and most of us - even I myself- all but lost the me­mory of them. But let us pon­der them now, for they may gi­ve us a me­asu­re of ho­pe. Frankly, I do not know whe­re el­se to lo­ok for it."</p>
   <p>    He ope­ned his me­tal-clad arms and gently emb­ra­ced and kis­sed the Qu­e­en. Then ca­me Ha­ra­mis, who­se fa­ce alo­ne was still uns­ta­ined by te­ars, and Ka­di­ya, sub­mis­si­ve at last, and gol­den-ha­ired Ani­gel who co­uld not le­ave off from sob­bing.</p>
   <p>    After bid­ding go­odb­ye to his fri­ends, he on­ce aga­in most so­lemnly char­ged the ve­ne­rab­le Lord Ma­no­pa­ro and the fo­ur knights with him, who smo­te the­ir ar­mo­red bo­soms in a ges­tu­re of fe­alty and drew the­ir swords. Then the King tur­ned away. With his high­born squ­ire Bar­ni­po be­aring the ro­yal shi­eld ahe­ad of him, he stro­de thro­ugh the so­lar do­or with most of the Oat­hed Com­pa­ni­ons fol­lo­wing af­ter. It was ti­me for him to ful­fill his own des­tiny, and not a one of tho­se left in the ro­om do­ub­ted what it wo­uld be.</p>
   <p>    As night fell on that day of con­qu­est, the fi­res of the Ci­ta­del dwind­led and mer­ged the­ir smo­ke with the mi­as­ma ri­sing from the Mi­re. The knoll on which the Ru­wen­di­an ca­pi­tal sto­od se­emed to be an is­land in a sea of tur­bu­lent clo­ud. La­bor­no­ki knights un­der Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil, who had emer­ged vic­to­ri­o­us from the last stand of the Oat­hed Com­pa­ni­ons, bro­ught the van­qu­is­hed King Kra­in and his squ­ire Bar­ni­po be­fo­re King Volt­rik, Crown Prin­ce An­tar, and the sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus. A few sco­re ot­her nob­le Ru­wen­di­an cap­ti­ves we­re the­re in the thro­ne ro­om, he­avily fet­te­red and well gu­ar­ded, in or­der to wit­ness the ca­pi­tu­la­ti­on of the­ir na­ti­on. The ban­ner of La­bor­nok, scar­let with three gol­den cros­sed swords, hung on the wall be­hind the thro­ne, whe­re Volt­rik now sat.</p>
   <p>    Krain was now ne­ar de­ath, ble­eding he­avily from de­ep wo­unds in the right arm and gro­in, and had to be sup­por­ted by two of Ha­mil's knights as he was led for­ward and for­ced to his kne­es at the fe­et of King Volt­rik. One of his cap­tors flung down Kra­in's bat­te­red azu­re shi­eld with its Black Tril­li­um de­vi­ce all but ob­li­te­ra­ted, and the ot­her knight cast atop it the King's bro­ken sword. Ha­mil him­self to­re off Kra­in's hel­met, re­mo­ved the pla­ti­num ro­yal co­ro­net set with sap­phi­res and am­ber, and held it high for all to see. The squ­ire Bar­ni­po, un­hurt and un­bo­und, tremb­led be­hind his li­ege in the grip of Lord Osor­kon, Ha­mil's se­cond-in-com­mand, a gi­gan­tic knight we­aring gory black ar­mor.</p>
   <p>    "Well met, Ro­yal Brot­her," Volt­rik sa­id to Kra­in. His fang-edged hel­met vi­sor was open and he se­emed to smi­le at the de­fe­ated Ru­wen­di­an mo­narch from wit­hin the open jaws of so­me fan­tas­tic, be­j­ewe­led sa­uri­an. Volt­rik's cha­sed and or­na­men­ted ar­mor of gold-pla­ted ste­el sho­ne bril­li­antly in the torch­light, and he lo­un­ged akim­bo on the thro­ne of Ru­wen­da with one leg cros­sed ja­un­tily over the ot­her. "And do you now sub­mit to me?"</p>
   <p>    "It se­ems I ha­ve lit­tle cho­ice." Kra­in's vo­ice was a husky whis­per.</p>
   <p>    "Do you sub­mit wit­ho­ut con­di­ti­on," Volt­rik de­man­ded, thrus­ting the Ru­wen­di­an co­ro­net be­ne­ath the stric­ken ru­ler's no­se, "kno­wing that only by swe­aring thus will the nob­le and com­mon in­ha­bi­tants of yo­ur van­qu­is­hed Ci­ta­del be spa­red de­ath?"</p>
   <p>    "I will sur­ren­der… if you spa­re al­so the li­ves of my Qu­e­en and three da­ugh­ters."</p>
   <p>    "That," sa­id the sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus, in to­nes as imp­la­cab­le as the stro­kes of a de­ath-gong, "can­not be. They must die, as you must. And as part of yo­ur sub­mis­si­on you shall tell us whe­re in this gre­at war­ren of crumb­ling ma­sonry they ha­ve sec­re­ted them­sel­ves."</p>
   <p>    "Never," Kra­in sa­id.</p>
   <p>    Now Crown Prin­ce An­tar ven­tu­red to step forth and conf­ront his ro­yal fat­her. "But su­rely, Si­re, we do not ma­ke war on help­less wo­men!"</p>
   <p>    "They must die," Oro­gas­tus re­pe­ated flatly. And King Volt­rik nod­ded as­sent.</p>
   <p>    "Your wi­zard fe­ars them be­ca­use of the ri­di­cu­lo­us Od­dling prop­hecy!" Kra­in exc­la­imed. "But it is ar­rant non­sen­se, Volt­rik - a nur­sery ta­le! Only a few months ago, you wo­uld ha­ve ta­ken my el­dest da­ugh­ter Ha­ra­mis as yo­ur bri­de - "</p>
   <p>    "But you scor­ned an al­li­an­ce with La­bor­nok," Volt­rik sa­id su­avely, rol­ling the co­ro­net aro­und and aro­und one fin­ger as ca­su­al­ly as an emb­ro­idery ho­op. "And you rep­li­ed to my gra­ci­o­us su­it in words of ha­ughty dis­da­in."</p>
   <p>    "Tact ne­ver be­ing a long su­it of you snotty Ru­wen­di­ans," Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil inj­ec­ted, grin­ning. "And now may you cho­ke on the in­so­lent fru­it you ha­ve so long cul­ti­va­ted."</p>
   <p>    The gat­he­ring of La­bor­no­ki knights and nob­les ro­ared with la­ugh­ter un­til King Volt­rik lif­ted one hand. "I put my trust in the mighty Oro­gas­tus, who is my Grand Mi­nis­ter of Sta­te as well as the Co­urt Sor­ce­rer. And it is he who has fo­re­se­en di­sas­ter to my ho­use at the hands of a ro­yal Ru­wen­di­an wo­man, not so­me sli­me-skin­ned Od­dling ta­le-tel­ler. So yo­ur wi­fe and da­ugh­ters must die, Brot­her Kra­in, as must you. But if you sub­mit to me humbly and turn them over to me, then yo­ur pas­sing and that of yo­ur wo­men­folk shall be mer­ci­ful, with a sing­le sword stro­ke, and tho­se of yo­ur pe­op­le who swe­ar fi­de­lity to La­bor­nok shall be spa­red."</p>
   <p>    Krain lif­ted his bru­ised chin. "I will not sub­mit, and I will not de­li­ver my wo­men in­to yo­ur hands."</p>
   <p>    Voltrik held high the co­ro­net, and then crus­hed it to a twis­ted mass bet­we­en me­tal-ga­unt­le­ted hands and drop­ped it in front of the kne­eling Kra­in. "Do you know yo­ur fa­mily's fa­te if you do not sur­ren­der to me? And that of yo­ur knights he­re gat­he­red in cha­ins?"</p>
   <p>    King Kra­in did not ans­wer.</p>
   <p>    Voltrik's craggy brow dar­ke­ned with an­ger and his fin­gers drum­med im­pa­ti­ently on one shi­ning gol­den cu­is­se. When the King of Ru­wen­da re­ma­ined stub­bornly si­lent, Volt­rik com­man­ded: "Bring in fo­ur char­gers!"</p>
   <p>    One of the La­bor­no­ki cap­ta­ins has­te­ned to obey.</p>
   <p>    A shoc­ked mur­mur ca­me from the pri­so­ners, and the squ­ire Bar­ni­po blanc­hed in sud­den fe­ar and twis­ted in the grip of his cap­tor.</p>
   <p>    "Ho!" Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil la­ug­hed. "This whi­te-li­ve­red yo­uth knows full well what man­ner of de­ath the moc­kers of La­bor­nok may ex­pect. See how uns­ta­ined his ar­mor is - a co­ward, be­yond a do­ubt. It wo­uld be a sa­lu­tary thing if <emphasis>he</emphasis> we­re to be the first to par­ti­ci­pa­te in this small de­monst­ra­ti­on of Yo­ur Ma­j­esty's just pu­nish­ment."</p>
   <p>    "No! No!" shri­eked Bar­ni­po. "God and the Lords of the Air ha­ve mercy on me!" He strug­gled fran­ti­cal­ly un­til the black-armo­red Lord Osor­kon smo­te him in the fa­ce with his clo­sed ba­re fist, whe­re­upon the boy sub­si­ded we­eping and gro­aning.</p>
   <p>    At that mo­ment, the La­bor­no­ki cap­ta­in and fo­ur host­lers re­tur­ned to the spa­ci­o­us thro­ne ro­om le­ading fo­ur gre­at war-fro­ni­als, still sad­dled and ca­pa­ri­so­ned. The ani­mals' eyes rol­led fu­ri­o­usly red, and they tos­sed the­ir gil­ded ant­lers and snor­ted and pran­ced, and the­ir me­tal-shod clo­ven ho­oves rang on the marb­le flo­or.</p>
   <p>    "No!" Bar­ni­po scre­amed.</p>
   <p>    "Yes," sa­id King Volt­rik qu­i­etly. His eyes met tho­se of Kra­in. "I will show you, Ro­yal Brot­her, just what fa­te awa­its you and yo­urs if you con­ti­nue to defy me." And to the cap­ta­in: "Ta­ke the cra­ven, and tie one of his limbs to the pom­mel of each sad­dle, and then whip the be­asts apart un­til he is well and truly qu­ar­te­red."</p>
   <p>    Barnipo let out a howl of des­pa­ir and writ­hed in Osor­kon's arms, whi­le the Ru­wen­di­an knights bel­lo­wed cur­ses upon the he­ad of Volt­rik un­til they we­re si­len­ced by the prick of dag­gers at the­ir thro­ats.</p>
   <p>    King Kra­in sa­id, "Let the po­or lad be, and inf­lict this de­ath rat­her upon me."</p>
   <p>    The sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus sa­id: "We will let the boy go free, and vo­uch­sa­fe to you an ho­no­rab­le de­ath rat­her than the ig­no­miny of ren­ding, if you will re­ve­al to us the hi­ding pla­ce of yo­ur wo­men."</p>
   <p>    "No," sa­id Kra­in.</p>
   <p>    "Sire?" Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil as­ked of Volt­rik.</p>
   <p>    The La­bor­no­ki King clim­bed to his fe­et. His red-vi­olet clo­ak bil­lo­wed abo­ut him and ref­lec­ted ga­rishly on his gol­den ar­mor. "Kra­in of Ru­wen­da, you ha­ve cho­sen yo­ur own de­ath. Lash him tightly to the be­asts."</p>
   <p>    "Sire! Si­re!" wept the boy. "Let it be me! For­gi­ve my co­war­di­ce!"</p>
   <p>    "I for­gi­ve you with all my he­art, Bar­ni," Kra­in sa­id.</p>
   <p>    The lac­keys to­ok the King, strip­ped him of his ar­mor, and la­id him su­pi­ne out in the mid­dle of the wi­de thro­ne ro­om flo­or. When they be­gan to tie him with raw­hi­de thongs, blo­od flo­wed from his re­ope­ned wo­unds and so­on lay in a po­ol be­ne­ath him. Thro­ug­ho­ut all this, in spi­te of the sho­uts of the fu­ri­o­us Ru­wen­di­an cap­ti­ves and the pe­ni­tent blub­be­ring of the squ­ire Bar­ni­po, Kra­in's co­un­te­nan­ce re­ma­ined un­per­tur­bed. When everyt­hing was re­ady, the fo­ur gre­at an­ti­lo­pi­ne char­gers ram­ping and squ­e­aling with ex­ci­te­ment so that it to­ok three men to hold each of them in pla­ce, the cap­ta­in sto­od at at­ten­ti­on and awa­ited Volt­rik's com­mand.</p>
   <p>    But now Oro­gas­tus whis­pe­red so­met­hing to his King, who nod­ded and then bec­ko­ned Lord Osor­kon to bring the fa­in­ting squ­ire clo­se to the thro­ne.</p>
   <p>    "Boy," the sor­ce­rer sa­id, fi­xing the ter­ri­fi­ed Bar­ni­po with his pe­net­ra­ting ga­ze, "you ha­ve it in yo­ur po­wer to sa­ve yo­ur Li­ege Lord from this hi­de­o­us de­ath. And to sa­ve yo­ur own skin and that of the ot­her cap­ti­ves as well."</p>
   <p>    Barnipo co­uld ba­rely mo­uth a reply. "I, my Lord?"</p>
   <p>    "You," sa­id Oro­gas­tus.</p>
   <p>    Of all the in­va­ders, the sor­ce­rer alo­ne was unar­mo­red, we­aring simp­le ro­bes of whi­te co­ve­red with a black cow­led clo­ak. A pla­ti­num cha­in hung abo­ut his neck, and from it was sus­pen­ded a he­avy me­dal­li­on eng­ra­ved with a many-ra­yed star. He now pus­hed his ho­od back to disc­lo­se fe­atu­res that we­re co­mely and un­li­ned, even tho­ugh his long ha­ir was as whi­te as snow. His fa­ce se­emed be­nign as he ad­dres­sed the squ­ire.</p>
   <p>    "Listen ca­re­ful­ly to me, boy. Do as I say and you may yet sa­ve the li­ves of the Qu­e­en and the three Prin­ces­ses. I con­fess that I am much ama­zed at the co­ura­ge shown by King Kra­in, and I de­em it me­et that my gra­ci­o­us so­ve­re­ign sho­uld wed yo­ur Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis af­ter all, sin­ce the da­ugh­ter must in­he­rit the vir­tue of the fat­her and pass it on to her sons."</p>
   <p>    "Really, my Lord?" A wild ho­pe lit the squ­ire's fa­ce.</p>
   <p>    "Really. And so that Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis may ac­cept the bet­rot­hal in go­od he­art, I ha­ve ad­vi­sed His Ma­j­esty to spa­re the li­ves of all the ro­yal Ru­wen­di­an wo­men. The only thing you ha­ve to do to bring abo­ut this for­tu­na­te re­so­lu­ti­on is to tell us whe­re they are con­ce­aled."</p>
   <p>    The boy's eyes dar­ted from sor­ce­rer to King and he he­si­ta­ted. "You will al­so spa­re my li­fe?"</p>
   <p>    "By my crown," sa­id Volt­rik, to­uc­hing the co­ro­net atop his fe­ar­so­me hel­met, "you will li­ve. But do not tarry, for the fro­ni­als grow rest­less."</p>
   <p>    "And our King?"</p>
   <p>    "He must die," Oro­gas­tus told him, "for that is our law. But you can en­su­re that his pas­sing is swift and pa­in­less. If you but spe­ak."</p>
   <p>    Tears po­ured down the boy's che­eks. "So say you on yo­ur ho­nor?"</p>
   <p>    "I swe­ar it by the Lords of the Air," Oro­gas­tus sa­id.</p>
   <p>    Barnipo to­ok a de­ep bre­ath. "Then… they are hid in a sec­ret strong­hold on the cha­pel flo­or of the gre­at ke­ep, re­ac­hed thro­ugh a hid­den pas­sa­ge wit­hin the cho­ir-loft, which opens by pres­sing the cent­ral boss of the gre­at tril­li­um car­ved on the wall. Lord Ma­no­pa­ro and fo­ur Oat­hed Com­pa­ni­ons gu­ard them."</p>
   <p>    The sor­ce­rer's de­ep eyes gle­amed. "Ah!"</p>
   <p>    And King Volt­rik and Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil ec­ho­ed: "Ah."</p>
   <p>    "You swo­re not to hurt them!" The boy's te­ary fa­ce flus­hed and his lip tremb­led. "By the Lords of the Air-"</p>
   <p>    "A for­mi­dab­le oath," Oro­gas­tus sa­id nonc­ha­lantly, "for tho­se who be­li­eve in such fan­ci­es."</p>
   <p>    "But you al­so swo­re!" Bar­ni­po tur­ned fran­ti­cal­ly to the King.</p>
   <p>    "To spa­re yo­ur des­pi­cab­le li­fe," Volt­rik sa­id, "and I will, so that you may ser­ve as a cess-pit drud­ge for the rest of yo­ur mi­se­rab­le days." And he cuf­fed the hor­ri­fi­ed boy smartly with his me­tal ga­unt­let, so that he crump­led and fell off the da­is and lay as one de­ad.</p>
   <p>    "My King," Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil sa­id, "I will ta­ke a for­ce and se­ek out the ro­yal bitch and her three whelps."</p>
   <p>    "No," sa­id Volt­rik. "My son and I will le­ad the se­arch party. You will de­al with the Ru­wen­di­an scum gat­he­red he­re… and with the­ir worth­less le­ader."</p>
   <p>    Beckoning to Prin­ce An­tar, Volt­rik stro­de off the da­is. He cal­led to them a gro­up of twenty knights, and they set off for the gre­at spi­ral sta­ir­ca­se that led up to the cha­pel.</p>
   <p>    Hamil, ma­iled fists res­ting on ma­iled hips, sur­ve­yed the thro­ne ro­om with its mob of La­bor­no­ki and the­ir wretc­hed pri­so­ners ran­ged abo­ut the pe­ri­me­ter. In the cen­ter of the hall King Kra­in still lay ti­ed to the shying war-fro­ni­als.</p>
   <p>    "Disposing of pri­so­ners in cha­ins is dull stuff," Ha­mil re­mar­ked to Osor­kon, "and it has be­en a we­ar­ying day. Let us first ha­ve so­me en­ter­ta­in­ment." Then he sho­uted, "Host­lers! Use yo­ur whips!"</p>
   <p>    In the hor­ror that fol­lo­wed, Bar­ni­po ma­de a qu­ick re­co­very from his sham fa­int, scut­tled away un­se­en, and ra­ced up a back sta­ir­way to warn the Qu­e­en and Prin­ces­ses of the­ir pe­ril.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Barni had run so fast that his bre­ath fa­iled. The­re was in his si­de a pa­in as di­re as a kni­fe-wo­und, and his he­ad ac­hed so much from the blow King Volt­rik had de­alt that he had be­gun to see two of everyt­hing. Now as he stag­ge­red up the cram­ped lit­tle sta­ir­ca­se to the cho­ir-loft he he­ard afar off the me­asu­red clank of ar­mo­red fe­et and an enemy vo­ice sho­uting: This way!</p>
   <p>    The cha­pel was al­most pitch-black, lit only by a few vo­ti­ve lamps, and the sta­ir­ca­se un­ligh­ted at all. This chan­ged in an ins­tant as King Volt­rik and his torch­be­aring knights rus­hed in thro­ugh the cent­ral por­tal and crow­ded in­to the ves­ti­bu­le.</p>
   <p>    Seized with pa­nic, the squ­ire trip­ped and fell ne­ar the sta­ir­way top, stri­king his swol­len he­ad. All his strength eb­bed away and it se­emed he wo­uld fa­il his duty yet aga­in. "Whi­te Lady!" he sob­bed alo­ud. "Help me. Help our po­or Qu­e­en and Prin­ces­ses."</p>
   <p>    Sweet air fil­led his con­ges­ted lungs and his vi­si­on cle­ared. The­re was still so­re pa­in in his he­ad, but he co­uld mo­ve aga­in. Mo­re li­ke a scramb­ling many-leg­ged wor­ram than a man, he craw­led up the rest of the sta­irs and ac­ross the splin­tery flo­or­bo­ards to the wall be­hind the ranks of cho­ir sto­ols. It was of dres­sed sto­ne, with a car­ved and pa­in­ted pa­nel of the Ro­yal Se­al of Ru­wen­da, an azu­re fi­eld ha­ving a gre­at he­ral­dic Black Tril­li­um with a gol­den boss at the cen­ter.</p>
   <p>    Barni craw­led to it and pres­sed the boss with both hands. At on­ce the sto­ne squ­are swung in­ward, ma­king a small do­or­way thro­ugh which a man co­uld squ­e­eze with dif­fi­culty. No so­oner had he en­te­red and swung the pa­nel clo­sed, than the grey­be­ar­ded Lord Ma­no­pa­ro and two ot­her Ru­wen­di­an knights, Kor­ban and We­de­ral, ca­me out in­to the cram­ped sec­ret pas­sa­ge­way from a ligh­ted in­ner sanc­tum, we­apons ba­red.</p>
   <p>    "Hold, hold, it's only me!" the squ­ire cro­aked, ri­sing to his kne­es.</p>
   <p>    "By the Flo­wer! Yo­ung Bar­ni!" Ma­no­pa­ro she­at­hed his sword and drew the drag­gled boy to his fe­et. "Now then, my lad - "</p>
   <p>    "Quickly! If you wo­uld sa­ve the la­di­es, bolt fast the outer do­or and bre­ak its ope­ning mec­ha­nism so that the foe may not en­ter!"</p>
   <p>    Uttering cur­ses, Kor­ban and We­de­ral has­te­ned to sho­ot ho­me fo­ur gre­at ste­el sli­ding bolts and chop up the sec­ret pa­nel's wo­oden mac­hi­nery with the­ir swords. No so­oner had they ac­comp­lis­hed this, than a mighty bat­te­ring com­men­ced from the out­si­de, ac­com­pa­ni­ed by mar­ti­al sho­uts. And then, even mo­re omi­no­usly, the po­un­ding stop­ped.</p>
   <p>    "They ha­ve go­ne to get a ram," We­de­ral sa­id.</p>
   <p>    "More li­kely the sor­ce­rer!" snap­ped Ma­no­pa­ro. "Back in­si­de the strong­hold."</p>
   <p>    They drag­ged the squ­ire with them to the sec­ret cham­ber, which was abo­ut se­ven ells squ­are and equ­ip­ped for a si­ege, ha­ving a mas­si­ve do­or of he­avy gon­da-wo­od strap­ped with iron, bar­red by three sto­ut ba­ulks of tim­ber. The walls we­re co­ve­red with an­ci­ent ta­pest­ri­es and the flo­or with thick car­pets and sle­eping mats. The­re we­re no win­dows, only two emb­ra­su­res high up, so nar­row that a fin­ger wo­uld ba­rely pass thro­ugh the slot. The ro­om had a small tab­le and one sto­ol, upon which Qu­e­en Ka­lant­he sat, gu­ar­ded by a fo­urth knight, Lord Jalin­do. A tiny fi­rep­la­ce hardly lar­ger than a bra­zi­er was flan­ked by chests of fo­ods­tuf­fs and kegs of wi­ne and wa­ter. A stan­ding cand­les­tick of bat­te­red sil­ver-gilt and ot­her cand­les in a wall scon­ce ga­ve fit­ful light.</p>
   <p>    Lord Ma­no­pa­ro ma­de obe­isan­ce to the Qu­e­en, who sat pa­le and calm with her three da­ugh­ters hud­dled aga­inst her skirts. She had put on her gre­at pla­ti­num Crown of Sta­te, bla­zing with eme­ralds and ru­bi­es, sur­mo­un­ted by a glit­te­ring di­amond sun­burst cen­te­red with a drop of am­ber as lar­ge as an egg. At the am­ber's he­art was a fos­sil Black Tril­li­um the si­ze of a thumb­na­il.</p>
   <p>    "My Qu­e­en, the foe ha­ve fo­und us." Ma­no­pa­ro in­di­ca­ted the dro­oping Bar­ni­po. "This squ­ire ga­ve war­ning and we ha­ve ma­de shift to block the way as well as may be. But they are su­re to bring up the sor­ce­rer to bre­ak the do­ors with his black ma­gic and ma­ke an end of us."</p>
   <p>    Little Prin­cess Ani­gel ga­ve a ren­ding shri­ek of ter­ror, and wo­uld ha­ve fal­len in­to hyste­rics had not her sis­ter Ka­di­ya slap­ped her smartly and ad­mo­nis­hed her to be still. Ha­ra­mis to­ok the sob­bing girl in­to her arms whi­le the Qu­e­en qu­es­ti­oned Bar­ni.</p>
   <p>    "What of my ro­yal hus­band? "</p>
   <p>    The squ­ire drop­ped to his kne­es, te­ars co­ur­sing down his dirty che­eks. "Oh, my Lady, he is de­ad and our po­or Ru­wen­da lost."</p>
   <p>    The fo­ur knights gro­aned and the ro­yal da­ugh­ters cri­ed out in hor­ror. Qu­e­en Ka­lant­he only inc­li­ned her he­ad and as­ked, "How did my Lord fall?"</p>
   <p>    "Alas!" cri­ed the boy. "God and the Lords of the Air for­gi­ve me, for it was all my fa­ult." And he con­ti­nu­ed on in this man­ner re­vi­ling him­self un­til Lord Jalin­do la­id a hand on his sho­ul­der.</p>
   <p>    "Come now. You are not yet fif­te­en ye­ars old, and no one of us can be­li­eve that such a yo­ung­ling cont­ri­ves the de­ath of kings. Tell us pla­inly what hap­pe­ned."</p>
   <p>    So Bar­ni did. And when he re­la­ted the man­ner of sha­me­ful de­ath that King Kra­in had suf­fe­red, the Prin­cess Ani­gel fa­in­ted de­ad away in­to the arms of her sis­ter Ha­ra­mis, and Prin­cess Ka­di­ya exc­la­imed in a bro­ken vo­ice, "They shall pay!" But the Qu­e­en sat still, sta­ring at the bar­red do­or op­po­si­te, hol­ding in her lap the swe­aty and blo­ods­ta­ined he­ad of the King's squ­ire, who wept as tho­ugh his he­art wo­uld bre­ak.</p>
   <p>    "It is not yo­ur fa­ult, po­or Bar­ni," she so­ot­hed him. "The fo­ul Oro­gas­tus de­ce­ived you. No one holds you to bla­me. The bla­me be upon the sor­ce­rer and King Volt­rik, and upon that mons­ter Ha­mil, who ga­ve the or­der that to­re my be­lo­ved asun­der."</p>
   <p>    "They shall pay," Ka­di­ya whis­pe­red, but no one ex­cept Ha­ra­mis he­ard.</p>
   <p>    Suddenly the­re was a gre­at de­to­na­ti­on. The knights drew the­ir swords and ar­ran­ged them­sel­ves in a li­ne bet­we­en the wo­men and the do­or. The Qu­e­en le­apt to her fe­et, let­ting the squ­ire sli­de to the car­pe­ted flo­or.</p>
   <p>    "A wo­man of our ho­use," Ka­lant­he sa­id, her eyes alight with re­so­lu­ti­on. "That is what the di­abo­li­cal Volt­rik fe­ars! So the prop­hecy is not me­rely an Od­dling ta­le af­ter all, sin­ce the La­bor­no­ki so­oth­sa­yer him­self con­firms it!"</p>
   <p>    She fa­ced her da­ugh­ters. Ani­gel had re­co­ve­red her­self, and the three pa­irs of eyes we­re fi­xed on the­ir mot­her. "The fall of La­bor­nok shall be com­pas­sed by a wo­man of our ho­use. You will li­ve, da­ugh­ters - and pro­ve the prop­hecy true."</p>
   <p>    Now the foe was smas­hing with blud­ge­ons and axes at the very do­or of the sanc­tum, Oro­gas­tus not be­ing ab­le to use his ma­gi­cal dest­ruc­ti­ve bolts in such a con­fi­ned spa­ce for fe­ar of top­pling the walls. Qu­e­en Ka­lant­he pul­led asi­de one of the han­ging ta­pest­ri­es, which we­re ma­de of an an­ti­que fab­ric, still to be fo­und he­re and the­re in the Ci­ta­del, that had out­las­ted tho­se who had bu­ilt the gre­at pi­le and awed the hu­mans who had cal­led the pla­ce ho­me for eight hund­reds. The cloth was grey, and as the Qu­e­en thrust it asi­de it tur­ned blue, and on it or in it sha­dows mo­ved, and yet one co­uld ne­ver see just what tho­se sha­dows we­re.</p>
   <p>    Behind this wond­ro­us dra­pery lay a ho­mely ne­ces­sity, the strong­hold gar­de­ro­be, a tiny clo­set just lar­ge eno­ugh for a sing­le oc­cu­pant. Ka­lant­he flung open its small do­or and com­man­ded: "Da­ugh­ters, in­si­de!"</p>
   <p>    Haramis mo­ved qu­ickly, drag­ging with her Ani­gel, who­se fra­gi­le body aga­in sho­ok with sobs. The fit was very tight for two, and Ka­di­ya drew her dag­ger and sa­id: "No mat­ter: I will re­ma­in with you, Mot­her-"</p>
   <p>    "Inside!" the Qu­e­en com­man­ded, in a ter­rib­le vo­ice no­ne of the girls had ever he­ard be­fo­re. Ka­di­ya ga­ped at her, then has­te­ned to push and cram the ot­her two wit­hin un­til the­re was ro­om for her, but only ba­rely, and the do­or to the gar­de­ro­be wo­uld not shut tightly.</p>
   <p>    "One last thing," the Qu­e­en sa­id, and she to­ok off her gre­at Crown and pas­sed it to the wa­iting hands of Ha­ra­mis. "And now pray, my dar­lings, and may we me­et aga­in in a hap­pi­er world."</p>
   <p>    She let the dusty ta­pestry fall. The­re re­ma­ined a small gap bet­we­en the han­gings thro­ugh which the three Prin­ces­ses saw what hap­pe­ned next.</p>
   <p>    The gon­da wo­od do­or was now in splin­ters from the blows of La­bor­no­ki bat­tle­axes. They he­wed at the do­orf­ra­me it­self un­til the hin­ges hol­ding the me­tal strap­ping ga­ve way, and the tim­ber bars col­lap­sed, and then the fi­nal me­lee be­gan.</p>
   <p>    Prince An­tar, we­aring blue-ena­me­led ar­mor and a win­ged hel­met, was among the first to pe­net­ra­te the bro­ken do­or. He en­ga­ged Lord Ma­no­pa­ro, the two of them smi­ting one anot­her with two-han­ded swords that rang li­ke bells with the for­ce of the blows. Ot­her knights of La­bor­nok rus­hed in­to the ro­om and had at the ot­her fo­ur Oat­hed Com­pa­ni­ons, whi­le King Volt­rik and Oro­gas­tus sto­od asi­de. The Qu­e­en had withd­rawn to the front of the he­arth, as far as pos­sib­le from the pla­ce whe­re her da­ugh­ters we­re con­ce­aled, and the hid­den girls saw her cle­arly, as well as the pitc­hed bat­tle ta­king pla­ce in the ro­om.</p>
   <p>    Lord Ma­no­pa­ro ga­ve a mighty thrust at the win­ged helm of Prin­ce An­tar. Its la­ces bro­ke, and it fell from the Prin­ce's he­ad. His fa­ce, stran­gely, was not con­tor­ted with bat­tle-lust but rat­her full of an­gu­ish. Ne­vert­he­less, An­tar la­id abo­ut with skill and gre­at strength, and at a for­tu­ito­us mo­ment ca­ught Lord Ma­no­pa­ro di­sen­ga­ged and lif­ted his hu­ge sword abo­ve his he­ad and struck down­ward, using such for­ce that the Ru­wen­di­an's he­ad, hel­met and all, was clo­ven in two.</p>
   <p>    Then Kor­ban and We­de­ral we­re mor­tal­ly wo­un­ded and di­sar­med, and only Lord Jalin­do still fo­ught on un­til he was overw­hel­med by the press of La­bor­no­ki. When the last Oat­hed Com­pa­ni­on fell, the vic­tors be­gan to hack him and his fal­len fel­lows to dol­lops.</p>
   <p>    Oh, the hor­ror! Prin­cess Ka­di­ya's eyes bur­ned and she snar­led in si­lent, help­less fury, as might a vo­ice­less lot­hok kit ta­ken for ta­ming from the bre­ast of its sla­in dam. The bar­ba­ro­us wretc­hes we­re ac­tu­al­ly enj­oying them­sel­ves as they dis­mem­be­red the fal­len Ru­wen­di­ans and ma­de mock of the­ir dying cri­es. Ka­di­ya was overw­hel­med by the ne­ed to burst forth from the hi­ding pla­ce and ta­ke re­ven­ge. Grip­ping her bla­de, crus­hed bet­we­en her sis­ters, her every musc­le ten­sed in re­adi­ness-</p>
   <p>    "Stay!" his­sed Ha­ra­mis. "By the Flo­wer, stay whe­re you are! Wo­uld you kill us all?"</p>
   <p>    Anigel had pul­led her tril­li­um amu­let on its cha­in from her bo­di­ce and now pres­sed it to her lips. "Pray to the Whi­te Lady, gu­ar­di­an of our land!"</p>
   <p>    "Pray that tho­se de­vi­lish bru­tes won't find us," mut­te­red Ha­ra­mis, hol­ding her own amu­let.</p>
   <p>    "Pray that so­me­one will co­me to sa­ve us," Ani­gel ur­ged.</p>
   <p>    Shivering with fe­ar and ra­ge, Ka­di­ya ne­vert­he­less felt her grip on the dag­ger hand­le ease. Al­most wit­ho­ut vo­li­ti­on her hand sto­le to the neck ope­ning of her do­ub­let. The amu­let was the­re un­der her sil­ken shirt, warm aga­inst her po­un­ding he­art.</p>
   <p>    "I pray that I will be the one," she whis­pe­red, "the one to ma­ke Volt­rik and An­tar and Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil and the sor­ce­rer pay with the­ir blo­od for the de­eds of this day!"</p>
   <p>    "Pray al­so for self-cont­rol," sa­id Ha­ra­mis, "or el­se yo­ur fo­ol­hardy bra­very may yet do­om us all. And ce­ase yo­ur wrig­gling, pla­gue ta­ke you, lest we tumb­le out at Volt­rik's fe­et!"</p>
   <p>    "Hush, hush! They will he­ar," Ani­gel ple­aded. The dre­ad­ful chop­ping and the la­ugh­ter of the evil knights had ce­ased, and King Volt­rik him­self was spe­aking.</p>
   <p>    Against her will, Ka­di­ya si­lently ut­te­red a plea for self-mas­tery. The an­ger still bur­ned wit­hin her, but slowly the emo­ti­on was co­ve­red, as one banks the co­als of a camp­fi­re so that the fla­mes may be sum­mo­ned aga­in in­to li­fe when the pro­per ho­ur co­mes.</p>
   <p>    "Look!" Ani­gel whis­pe­red, her vo­ice al­most ina­udib­le for ter­ror. "Our Mot­her!"</p>
   <p>    King Volt­rik had be­en ad­dres­sing the Qu­e­en, evi­dently qu­es­ti­oning her abo­ut the whe­re­abo­uts of the Prin­ces­ses. It was clo­se and smoky in the strong­hold, with the cand­les in the wall scon­ce gut­te­ring and a few of the flo­or mats as­mo­ul­der, ha­ving be­en burnt when the big stan­ding cand­les­tick was up­set. The King had un­hel­med and re­mo­ved his ga­unt­lets, and from the fi­er­ce scowl that dar­ke­ned his co­un­te­nan­ce it was evi­dent that Qu­e­en Ka­lant­he had de­fi­ed him.</p>
   <p>    She sto­od stra­ight, with the dis­he­ve­led squ­ire Bar­ni­po cro­uc­hed at her fe­et in a da­ze, and sa­id: "Ne­ver will I tell you whe­re my da­ugh­ters are."</p>
   <p>    "Orogastus, for­ce her!" bel­lo­wed Volt­rik. "Or spy out the ro­yal brats with yo­ur far­se­e­ing eye!"</p>
   <p>    "I can­not for­ce her will, my King," the sor­ce­rer rep­li­ed. "She is be­yond fe­ar. And I can­not descry the hid­den ones, no mo­re than I co­uld do so down in the thro­ne ro­om. This an­ci­ent Ci­ta­del must be per­va­ded with so­me ar­ca­ne enc­hant­ment that blocks my se­eking Sight. I own a ma­gi­cal de­vi­ce that wo­uld ac­comp­lish the task no mat­ter what obs­tac­les in­ter­ve­ned, but it is bulky and of a gre­at we­ight, and it can­not be re­mo­ved from my ey­rie on Mo­unt Brom."</p>
   <p>    "Then we shall ha­ve to use ot­her me­ans to un­lock the lady's ton­gue." King Volt­rik ca­me slowly to­ward the Qu­e­en with sword drawn, and to­ok hold of her right wrist.</p>
   <p>    "Enough of this, ro­yal bitch! You will tell me qu­ickly whe­re the girls are, or I will stri­ke yo­ur hand from yo­ur arm. And do you still fa­il to spe­ak, then I will stri­ke off the ot­her hand, and pro­ce­ed to yo­ur fe­et, and then yo­ur limbs lit­tle by lit­tle un­til you gi­ve ans­wer, for thus do­es La­bor­nok re­pay in­so­len­ce in its ene­mi­es."</p>
   <p>    "Sire!" exc­la­imed Prin­ce An­tar, his fa­ce ag­hast. "She is a qu­e­en, and that pu­nish­ment is one for re­bel­li­o­us sla­ves -"</p>
   <p>    "Silence!" thun­de­red Volt­rik. The­re was a mur­mu­ring among the Ot­her men, but this di­ed away as the King ra­ised his sword arm. "Will you spe­ak, wo­man?"</p>
   <p>    Then a thing hap­pe­ned so swiftly that the watc­hing knights and the Prin­ce co­uld not grasp it, but the Prin­ces­ses saw cle­arly. The fa­in­ting squ­ire Bar­ni­po was ener­gi­zed and sprang at King Volt­rik li­ke a ma­ra­uding fe­dok at­tac­king its farm­yard prey. Ha­ving no bla­de, he sank his te­eth in­to the King's left hand, that which grip­ped the Qu­e­en.</p>
   <p>    Voltrik ut­te­red a ro­ar of pa­in and drew back with the boy still han­ging on­to him. The King la­id abo­ut every which way with his gre­at sword, and by mi­sad­ven­tu­re slas­hed the Qu­e­en in the thro­at, and she fell with her li­fe's blo­od po­uring forth on the he­arth. All of the La­bor­no­ki knights be­gan to yell and to thrust at the still-clin­ging yo­uth - but gin­gerly, lest the fla­iling mo­narch al­so by chan­ce stri­ke them. The squ­ire Bar­ni­po was pi­er­ced by a do­zen bla­des and fell away at last, la­ug­hing in his pa­in, un­til the King him­self smo­te off the bra­ve boy's he­ad.</p>
   <p>    Then Volt­rik ga­ve vent to black fury, cur­sing <emphasis>so</emphasis> vi­lely that even his hench­men flinc­hed, for Qu­e­en Ka­lant­he was al­so de­ad, be­yond co­er­ci­on, and the three Prin­ces­ses still at lar­ge.</p>
   <p>    "What are we to do?" Prin­ce An­tar as­ked.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus sa­id: "They can­not ha­ve go­ne far. It is cer­ta­in that they must ha­ve be­en with the­ir mot­her up un­til the ti­me that this low­born whelp" - and he kic­ked the squ­ire's body - "went by so­me short­cut from the thro­ne ro­om and ga­ve war­ning. We must mo­unt a se­arch of the en­ti­re ke­ep."</p>
   <p>    Calming him­self, Volt­rik sa­id: "Oro­gas­tus spe­aks truly. You, Mi­lo­tis, will ta­ke char­ge of the­se knights and be­gin se­arc­hing the cha­pel and its en­vi­rons im­me­di­ately. Be alert for sec­ret pas­sa­ges and 'twe­en-wall sta­ir­ways! Af­ter that, se­arch the High To­wer abo­ve. An­tar and Oro­gas­tus, co­me with me. We'll ro­ust out the rest of our fel­lows and ran­sack this pi­le from the hig­hest pa­ra­pet to the lo­west dun­ge­on."</p>
   <p>    Then the King be­gan to mut­ter ma­le­dic­ti­ons upon the so­ul of Bar­ni­po, who had ta­ken a fa­ir chunk of flesh from the he­el of his hand, which now was ex­ce­edingly pa­in­ful. Oro­gas­tus un­der­to­ok to bind the wo­und, sa­ying that Volt­rik wo­uld ha­ve to ta­ke gre­at ca­re, hu­man bi­tes be­ing li­kely to carry dan­ge­ro­us in­fec­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "May the mem­ber put­refy," Ka­di­ya whis­pe­red fe­ro­ci­o­usly, "and the po­iso­ned blo­od as­cend in­to Volt­rik's al­re­ady rot­ten he­art!"</p>
   <p>    "And may the Lords of the Air carry po­or Bar­ni in­to hig­hest he­aven," Ha­ra­mis bre­at­hed, "for by his bra­ve ac­ti­on, he spa­red our Mot­her tor­tu­re, and ga­ined us ti­me to sa­ve our li­ves."</p>
   <p>    The King, his son, and the sor­ce­rer went off; and af­ter a short se­arch of the blind pas­sa­ge out­si­de the strong­hold, Sir Mi­lo­tis and his men al­so withd­rew to be­gin the­ir scru­tiny of the cho­ir loft. They ban­ged abo­ut and sho­uted and over­tur­ned fur­ni­tu­re for so­me mi­nu­tes, and then tro­oped down the sta­irs to exa­mi­ne the cha­pel.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya sa­id: "I think it's sa­fe to co­me out."</p>
   <p>    So they did, all stiff-jo­in­ted and tremb­ling, cre­eping from the gar­de­ro­be in­to the aw­ful shamb­les of the cham­ber. The full re­ality of the­ir si­tu­ati­on now struck them li­ke a splash of icy wa­ter. Ani­gel clung to Ha­ra­mis's hand and bit her lo­wer lip un­til a trick­le of blo­od sto­le down her chin. Ka­di­ya step­ped over the tang­led bo­di­es to the fal­len Qu­e­en.</p>
   <p>    "She se­ems at pe­ace," the girl mar­ve­led. "Her eyes are clo­sed and her as­pect gent­le." She to­ok a black silk clo­ak that so­me­one had drop­ped and wo­uld ha­ve co­ve­red her mot­her's body; but Ha­ra­mis sa­id:</p>
   <p>    "Fool! What if one of them sho­uld co­me back and dis­co­ver it?"</p>
   <p>    Chagrined, Ka­di­ya ad­mit­ted: "You are wi­ser than I, Sis­ter."</p>
   <p>    "Give the clo­ak to me," Ha­ra­mis sa­id, "so that I may wrap the Crown. I will carry it with me - alt­ho­ugh the­re is small chan­ce I shall ever we­ar it."</p>
   <p>    Anigel let out a smot­he­red squ­e­ak of fe­ar. Her sap­phi­re eyes we­re enor­mo­us as she po­in­ted wit­ho­ut words to one cor­ner of the ro­om ath­wart the do­or.</p>
   <p>    There we­re no bo­di­es the­re, and yet a pi­le of cus­hi­ons was mo­ving.</p>
   <p>    "Stand back," Ka­di­ya or­de­red, dra­wing her dag­ger and ad­van­cing. One by one, she pluc­ked up the pil­lows with her bla­de's po­int and threw them asi­de, un­til the­re was re­ve­aled the car­pet, pus­hed up li­ke a tent and ri­sing hig­her by the mo­ment.</p>
   <p>    "By the Flo­wer, a trap­do­or!" Ha­ra­mis sa­id. "Qu­ick, Ka­di, draw asi­de the rug."</p>
   <p>    "Oh, be­wa­re," Ani­gel cri­ed. "Per­haps it is the foe!"</p>
   <p>    "Foe foe foe in­de­ed!" sa­id a crabby lit­tle vo­ice. "Mo­ve li­vely, girl, or el­se they'll cut off our es­ca­pe."</p>
   <p>    The three Prin­ces­ses gas­ped, and when Ka­di­ya got the trap un­co­ve­red the­re in its mo­uth sto­od a fe­ma­le cre­atu­re of short sta­tu­re, ne­atly dres­sed in a fus­ti­an ro­be, a gre­en pla­it-work shawl, and a le­at­her ap­ron. Her sal­low fa­ce was bro­ad, as was her mo­uth, and her be­a­uti­ful gol­den eyes bul­ged in­hu­manly abo­ve two tiny slit­ted nost­rils. Nar­row po­in­ted ears tip­ped with sil­very ba­ub­les thrust up from the folds of her lawn he­ad­dress. Her hands we­re bro­adly two-fin­ge­red with op­po­sing thumbs, sta­ined and scar­red from many ye­ars of mi­xing stran­ge con­coc­ti­ons.</p>
   <p>    "Immu!" cri­ed Ani­gel in a trans­port of joy and re­li­ef. "De­arest Im­mu, you've co­me to sa­ve us af­ter all. We tho­ught you'd fled with the rest of the Od­dlings -"</p>
   <p>    "Fled fled fled! What rub­bish!" Im­mu clim­bed up in­to the cham­ber, then po­in­ted dra­ma­ti­cal­ly in­to the ho­le. "Get you down the lad­der, for I'll ha­ve to cont­ri­ve a way to co­ver the trap­do­or be­hind us."</p>
   <p>    Haramis and Ani­gel kil­ted up the­ir long skirts and went awk­wardly, whi­le Ka­di­ya scramb­led down agi­le as a tree-vart. In the ro­ugh va­ul­ted pas­sa­ge be­low was anot­her surp­ri­se.</p>
   <p>    "Uzun!" Ha­ra­mis exc­la­imed. "And Jagun, too!"</p>
   <p>    Two ot­her small fi­gu­res sto­od wa­iting, car­rying gre­en-glo­wing lan­terns in which lu­mi­no­us swamp-worms we­re enc­lo­sed. They we­re ma­les of the sa­me Nysso­mu ra­ce as Im­mu. Jagun wo­re a fe­dok-skin hun­ter's cap and brown le­at­hers cut very si­mi­larly to tho­se of Ka­di­ya, whi­le the mu­si­ci­an Uzun had on his usu­al emb­ro­ide­red ma­ro­on vel­vet smock. His gold bro­ca­de be­ret was bes­mirc­hed with sticky black lin­git web­bing from the sec­ret pas­sa­ge.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya emb­ra­ced her small men­tor. "You didn't de­sert us, Jagun!"</p>
   <p>    "Desert? De­sert? " The Mas­ter of Ani­mals was in­dig­nant. "We simply hid, which was the pru­dent thing to do. Only you hu­mans are fo­olish eno­ugh to stand still li­ke silly to­gars mes­me­ri­zed in the mo­on­light, watc­hing de­ath march down the ca­use­way right in­to yo­ur front do­or!"</p>
   <p>    "Honor de­man­ded our de­fen­se of the Ci­ta­del," sa­id Ka­di­ya hotly.</p>
   <p>    "Well, see what yo­ur ho­nor's bo­ught you," sa­id Uzun the mu­si­ci­an. "If only you had go­ne away in­to the Mazy Mi­re, to our pe­op­le at Tre­vis­ta, we co­uld ha­ve ta­ken you in."</p>
   <p>    "And then what?" Ka­di­ya de­man­ded.</p>
   <p>    "Then…" The Mas­ter of Ani­mals shrug­ged his nar­row sho­ul­ders. "You might ha­ve li­ved with us."</p>
   <p>    "But this is our ho­me," Ani­gel pro­tes­ted gently.</p>
   <p>    "And now it's <emphasis>the­irs</emphasis>," sa­id Im­mu, her vo­ice brus­que. She had fi­nis­hed her ca­mo­uf­la­ging and ca­me qu­ickly down the lad­der, pic­king up her own lan­tern. "And they're bo­und and de­ter­mi­ned to slay you. Us as well, if they catch us."</p>
   <p>    "But you ca­me any­way to sa­ve us," Ani­gel sa­id softly. She had hold of the tril­li­um amu­let. "The Whi­te Lady ans­we­red our pra­yers."</p>
   <p>    "That is so." Uzun sketc­hed a mystic three-lo­bed sign abo­ve his he­ad in re­ve­ren­ce. "My own mas­tery of do­mes­tic ma­gic is puny, as you know, de­ar Prin­ces­ses. I am much mo­re ac­comp­lis­hed on the harp and fip­ple flu­te! But yes­ter­day I did the wa­ter-scry, se­eking to dis­co­ver that which wo­uld tell us three Nysso­mu whet­her our des­tiny lay with hu­man­kind whom we ha­ve ser­ved so long or with our own pe­op­le. And the Arc­hi­ma­ge spo­ke."</p>
   <p>    Haramis sa­id: "Archi­ma­ge! That's one of the na­mes of the Whi­te Lady."</p>
   <p>    "Lady lady lady!" scol­ded Im­mu. "Hush, child, and let Uzun exp­la­in, for we must be away at on­ce."</p>
   <p>    Haramis lo­we­red her he­ad. "Say on, fri­end Uzun."</p>
   <p>    "The Whi­te Lady is ac­tu­al­ly na­med Bi­nah. Arc­hi­ma­ge is her tit­le, for she is an enc­hant­ress, the most mighty in all our Pe­nin­su­la."</p>
   <p>    "Or was," sa­id Jagun glo­omily. "She is dying, be­ing of a vast age, and her fa­iling po­wers co­uld not co­un­ter­va­il tho­se of the ter­rib­le Oro­gas­tus."</p>
   <p>    "She ba­de us bring you to her," Uzun sa­id.</p>
   <p>    "Why?" as­ked Ka­di­ya, rat­her tartly. "If she is dying, she can be of scant help, and it is hardly a ti­me for sick vi­sits."</p>
   <p>    To which Ha­ra­mis ap­pen­ded, "We wo­uld do bet­ter, it se­ems to me, to go to Tre­vis­ta. The­re we can wa­it out the Win­ter Ra­ins, which will be he­re in a few we­eks. Per­haps la­ter we can dis­gu­ise our­sel­ves and jo­in a ca­ra­van, and even­tu­al­ly ma­ke our way to the co­ast and ta­ke ship to Var. The­re King Fi­ode­lon will su­rely gi­ve us sanc­tu­ary."</p>
   <p>    Uzun spo­ke with simp­le dig­nity. "As to that co­ur­se of ac­ti­on, I know not. The Arc­hi­ma­ge char­ged us to bring you to her -just as she char­ged the three of us, many long ye­ars ago, to ser­ve in this hu­man cast­le aga­inst a day of gre­at ne­ed for all Folk dwel­ling in the Mazy Mi­re."</p>
   <p>    "Which day is <emphasis>to­day</emphasis>," Im­mu sa­id, "or I'm a ring­ta­iled vo­lum­ni­al!"</p>
   <p>    She clam­ped her wi­de lips shut and coc­ked her he­ad, lis­te­ning in­tently, her long, sen­si­ti­ve ears swi­ve­ling abo­ut so that the or­na­ments win­ked in the li­ving lamp­light. "They le­ave the cha­pel," she sa­id at length. "But ot­her se­arc­hers will be swar­ming abo­ut the ke­ep at King Volt­rik's com­mand. Even tho­se three lac­keys of the sor­ce­rer, who are cal­led his Vo­ices and who con­sort with the Skri­tek! It's ti­me to le­ave."</p>
   <p>    "Haramis, El­dest Da­ugh­ter of the King, you will co­me with me," Uzun sa­id. " Jagun and Im­mu will ta­ke yo­ur sis­ters by anot­her way. This was com­man­ded by the Arc­hi­ma­ge."</p>
   <p>    For a mo­ment it se­emed Ha­ra­mis wo­uld re­fu­se. Aban­don her sis­ters? Her hand went to her bre­ast and her fin­gers clo­sed abo­ut the amu­let that had ne­ver left her af­ter the ho­ur of her birth.</p>
   <p>    "But I can­not le­ave them! I am the el­dest, and he­ir to the thro­ne, res­pon­sib­le for them. And when mat­ters de­man­ded, it has al­ways be­en I who de­ci­ded for us all."</p>
   <p>    "Hara, do as he says," Ani­gel ur­ged. "Trust the Whi­te Lady."</p>
   <p>    "I li­ke this not, Sis­ters," sa­id Ka­di­ya. Her tan­ned brow was cre­ased and her ha­ir, rus­set li­ke that of the Qu­e­en, was all awry, es­ca­ping from what had be­en ne­atly co­iled bra­ids. "If we stay to­get­her, my bla­de of­fers us all so­me me­asu­re of pro­tec­ti­on. Gladly I wo­uld lay down my li­fe-"</p>
   <p>    "Life li­fe li­fe!" Im­mu was to­tal­ly exas­pe­ra­ted. "Why are you al­ways so hot­he­aded? And why must Ha­ra­mis ma­ke the de­ci­si­ons? Ani­gel is not strong­min­ded li­ke you two, and yet she shows the gre­atest wis­dom! Tell them, Uzun! Tell them the ot­her words of the Arc­hi­ma­ge."</p>
   <p>    "I for­bo­re," the mu­si­ci­an ad­mit­ted she­epishly, "wan­ting not to dis­may you. The Arc­hi­ma­ge Bi­nah bids you co­me to her be­ca­use you are un­re­ady to pur­sue yo­ur gre­at des­tiny. In­de­ed, you do not even re­cog­ni­ze it yet."</p>
   <p>    Haramis and Ka­di­ya brid­led at this, but Uzun went on. "You three, Pe­tals of the Li­ving Tril­li­um, ha­ve it wit­hin you to sa­ve this land from the op­pres­si­ve ru­le of King Volt­rik and Oro­gas­tus, but only if yo­ur flaws and we­ak­nes­ses are men­ded can you suc­ce­ed. The Arc­hi­ma­ge will tell you how this may be do­ne when you co­me to her."</p>
   <p>    Anigel to­ok the hands of her two sis­ters. "Ha­ra… Ka­di… ple­ase!"</p>
   <p>    Kadiya ve­iled her fi­er­ce brown eyes and slowly nod­ded. A mo­ment la­ter Ha­ra­mis sa­id: "Very well."</p>
   <p>    "By the Flo­wer, it's abo­ut ti­me!" Im­mu exc­la­imed. She con­ti­nu­ed: "Ha­ra­mis, you must fol­low Uzun. Ani­gel and Ka­di­ya, co­me with Jagun and me."</p>
   <p>    So sa­ying, the Od­dling wo­man pul­led Ani­gel off down the nar­row dusty pas­sa­ge, and the hunts­man fol­lo­wed af­ter, sho­o­ing Ka­di­ya ahe­ad of him as a farm­wi­fe herds her to­gars. In a mo­ment the light of the­ir li­ving torc­hes was lost in thick dark­ness.</p>
   <p>    "And we two must fa­re forth to­get­her," Ha­ra­mis sa­id to the mu­si­ci­an. "Old fri­end, I ho­pe the Whi­te Lady has strengt­he­ned yo­ur puny ma­gic, for yo­ur flu­te dit­ti­es, ex­cel­lent as they are, will not long fend off the war­ri­ors of La­bor­nok or the­ir storm-bec­ko­ning sor­ce­rer."</p>
   <p>    "I, too, am af­ra­id, Prin­cess," Uzun ad­mit­ted. "But I put my trust in the Arc­hi­ma­ge, as you must. And she has or­de­red that you be ta­ken to the top of the High To­wer of the gre­at ke­ep."</p>
   <p>    Dismay pa­led the girl's fa­ce. With its fra­ming blue-black ha­ir, it was spect­ral in the glo­om. "We shall be trap­ped up the­re! The se­arc­hers will su­rely dis­co­ver us! Oh, why didn't I lis­ten to Ka­di?"</p>
   <p>    "Come," Uzun in­sis­ted, and went hur­rying off with the lan­tern, and Ha­ra­mis had no cho­ice but to fol­low.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Kadiya, Ani­gel, and the two Od­dlings fled thro­ugh dark and nar­row spa­ces bet­we­en the sto­ne walls of the Ci­ta­del ke­ep, so­me­ti­mes pas­sing ot­her sec­ret do­ors, the­ir mac­hi­nery fur­red with the dust of ages. At length, af­ter they had des­cen­ded a ste­ep sta­ir­way, they ca­me to a pas­sa­ge whe­re the­re was a pe­ep­ho­le gi­ving on­to the thro­ne ro­om.</p>
   <p>    Jagun spi­ed thro­ugh this in­to the now si­lent and li­fe­less cham­ber. Then Im­mu lo­oked, and then Prin­cess Ka­di­ya, who ut­te­red a low cry of gri­ef and struck her small fists aga­inst the sto­ne wall whi­le she wept, not ut­te­ring a so­und.</p>
   <p>    They beg­ged Prin­cess Ani­gel not to lo­ok, fe­aring that the ap­pal­ling sight wo­uld stri­ke her sen­se­less, but she wo­uld not mo­ve from the spot un­til Jagun step­ped asi­de. She put her eye to the ho­le in the wall and saw from abo­ve the mu­ti­la­ted re­ma­ins of the cap­ti­ve Oat­hed Com­pa­ni­ons and King Kra­in, and to the ama­ze­ment of the ot­hers she ne­it­her crin­ged nor cri­ed, but only clo­sed her eyes and held tight to her tril­li­um amu­let.</p>
   <p>    After a mo­ment she sig­hed rag­gedly and as­ked: "Immu, you are old and wi­se. Tell me why the La­bor­no­ki did this, when our Fat­her and his knights we­re al­re­ady in the­ir po­wer and sur­ren­de­red?"</p>
   <p>    "It is a hard thing for such as you to un­ders­tand, child. You are gent­le and lo­ving yo­ur­self, and you ha­ve known only lo­ve and gent­le­ness thro­ug­ho­ut yo­ur li­fe. But the­re are tho­se to whom cru­elty vo­uch­sa­fes a dark thrill, a rus­hing sen­se of po­wer. Small-so­uled and fe­ar­ful them­sel­ves, sur­ro­un­ded by ot­hers who wo­uld wre­ak cru­elty on them and fin­ding scant hap­pi­ness in li­fe, they fall prey to the ba­sest of all lusts - that which finds ple­asu­re in dest­ruc­ti­on and in the pa­in of ot­hers. The cru­el one fe­els him­self exal­ted abo­ve all by his ac­ti­on. He fe­els mo­re ali­ve be­ca­use of the de­ath of ot­hers. He de­fi­es the Cre­ator by ren­ding cre­ati­on. He scorns lo­ve and emb­ra­ces ha­te, be­ca­use it alo­ne en­kind­les his cold and stag­nant so­ul. The­re is no pity, no stric­ken cons­ci­en­ce, no re­mor­se in the wan­tonly vi­ci­o­us. The­re is only a hun­ger for mo­re and mo­re cru­elty, be­ca­use the­se per­sons can ne­ver be sa­ted. Gent­le folk may not sa­fely res­pond to them gently, be­ca­use evil­do­ers do not know what lo­ve is, mis­ta­king it for we­ak­ness. For this re­ason you, who are a gent­le and lo­ving Prin­cess, must find a ster­ner way of de­aling with such ones."</p>
   <p>    "Oh, I co­uld not," Ani­gel sa­id, tremb­ling. "Ne­ver co­uld I - not even af­ter vi­ewing this ter­rib­le sight!"</p>
   <p>    Princess Ka­di­ya flung her arms aro­und her sis­ter. "Ne­ver mind, Ani de­ar. <emphasis>I'll</emphasis> see that the bru­tes get what's co­ming to them."</p>
   <p>    Then Jagun ma­de them mo­ve on, and they wal­ked and wal­ked, al­ways mo­ving de­eper in­to the Ci­ta­del's lo­wer le­vels, un­til fi­nal­ly the sec­ret way en­ded in a wall of mo­dern brick that for­med a de­ad end.</p>
   <p>    Anigel be­gan to whim­per in a pa­nic, but Im­mu hus­hed her whi­le Jagun held his lamp clo­se and ma­de fin­ger play on the wall, first in this di­rec­ti­on and then in that. Sud­denly a sec­ti­on of brick­work shif­ted, and torch­light sho­ne thro­ugh, and the girls ca­ught a fa­mi­li­ar malty smell and knew whe­re they must be. They hur­ri­ed bet­we­en ranks of bar­rels and big cop­per ves­sels with be­er pud­dled be­ne­ath, for this was the Ci­ta­del bre­wery that Im­mu su­per­vi­sed, alt­ho­ugh all the wor­kers had fled and the fi­res had go­ne out, and the hu­ge vat of wort was un­ten­ded.</p>
   <p>    Immu led them now, and they en­te­red the gra­in sto­re, whe­re the two Od­dlings and the girls had to shift a lar­ge pi­le of sacks. In back of it was a mo­ul­de­ring wo­oden do­or that yi­el­ded with lo­ud and re­luc­tant cre­akings when Jagun pri­zed it open with a fi­re po­ker. The do­or led to a pre­ci­pi­to­us sta­ir­way hewn from li­ving rock, wet and slip­pery from wa­ter that drip­ped from cracks over­he­ad. They des­cen­ded, the walls glis­te­ning as the wan lan­tern light ref­lec­ted off oc­ca­si­onal flows of gre­asy mud.</p>
   <p>    "This way le­ads to the ut­ter­most depths of the Ci­ta­del," Jagun sa­id, "to dun­ge­ons and oub­li­et­tes and cis­terns and dra­ins that ha­ve ne­ver be­fo­re be­en se­en by Ru­wen­di­an eyes, bu­ilt by the Va­nis­hed Ones."</p>
   <p>    There had be­en a few web-bu­il­ding lin­gits in the up­per pas­sa­ges, tiny harm­less cre­atu­res that fed on ho­use­hold bugs. But at the bot­tom of the sta­irs they ca­me in­to a low ro­ofed cham­ber hung with drip­ping mud sta­lac­ti­tes, and among the­se we­re much lar­ger lin­gits, with bo­di­es the si­ze of la­du fru­it and nasty te­eth. The cre­atu­res had spun clumsy sticky nets as big as black beds­he­ets, and Jagun and Ka­di­ya drew the­ir bla­des and hac­ked thro­ugh tho­se that im­pe­ded the­ir pas­sa­ge. Ani­gel shrank back in lo­at­hing when Im­mu kic­ked asi­de the in­dig­nant disp­la­ced spin­ners, which che­eped and squ­e­aked and tri­ed to bi­te thro­ugh the sho­es and bo­ots of the int­ru­ders.</p>
   <p>    Once past this obs­tac­le, they des­cen­ded anot­her flight of ro­ughly car­ved sta­irs, and the smell of ta­in­ted wa­ter grew of­fen­si­vely strong. They ca­me to a rus­ted ga­te that sto­od half open. Be­yond it was anot­her por­tal ga­ping wi­de, and on the walls empty torch-hol­ders and pegs hol­ding bunc­hes of keys so at­tac­ked by ver­dig­ris that they crumb­led to gre­enish clots when Ka­di­ya ven­tu­red to to­uch them. The flo­or was co­ve­red with po­ols of wa­ter, and as they hur­ri­ed down a cor­ri­dor, be­co­ming mo­re mud-splas­hed by the mo­ment, the glo­om ligh­te­ned and a yel­lo­wish ra­di­an­ce sho­ne forth.</p>
   <p>    They en­te­red a lar­ge arc­hed ro­om and the girls exc­la­imed alo­ud, for the pla­ce was a kind of pri­son ward, with rot­ting cells all aro­und it, and the flo­or and ce­iling and walls we­re stre­aked with slip­pery glo­wing mat­ter. Sha­pe­less lit­tle cre­atu­res slit­he­red lan­gu­idly abo­ut, le­aving shi­ning tra­ils be­hind them.</p>
   <p>    "They are the sli­me dawd­lers," Jagun sa­id. "Such al­so dwell in the re­mo­te re­ac­hes of the Misty Mi­re."</p>
   <p>    "Ugh!" cri­ed Ani­gel. And she po­in­ted in hor­ror to one cell whe­re the do­or had fal­len from its de­ca­yed fra­me, and wit­hin lay a ske­le­ton still cha­ined to the wall by rus­ted fet­ters. The eye soc­kets glo­wed, for sli­me dawd­lers had ma­de the­ir dwel­ling in­si­de it.</p>
   <p>    "What a na­use­ating pla­ce. Lo­ok! The­re are rus­ted inst­ru­ments of tor­tu­re in that cor­ner. And the­se hor­rid slimy things -. They lurk in every no­ok and cranny. See, this old buc­ket is craw­ling with them. Oh! The­re is one clim­bing up my shoe!" She tri­ed in va­in to scra­pe the clin­ging thing off aga­inst a sto­ne plinth, shud­de­ring all the whi­le with ab­hor­ren­ce, and then burst in­to help­less te­ars.</p>
   <p>    Immu went to her dar­ling's res­cue, ske­we­ring the slug ex­pertly with the dag­ger she wo­re she­at­hed be­hind her ap­ron, and flip­ping it away. She drew out a dry kerc­hi­ef and wi­ped Ani­gel's muddy and te­ar-sta­ined fa­ce, mur­mu­ring words of so­la­ce.</p>
   <p>    "How much fart­her must we go?" Ka­di­ya de­man­ded of Jagun. "My po­or sis­ter's co­urt slip­pers gi­ve scant pro­tec­ti­on from the wet, and her gown and light clo­ak are so­aked thro­ugh. She will catch her de­ath."</p>
   <p>    "There will be warm, dry clot­hing wa­iting," Jagun sa­id, "but we shall get wet­ter still be­fo­re qu­it­ting this pla­ce - <emphasis>hark</emphasis>!"</p>
   <p>    They all sto­od stock still. Jagun snatc­hed off his hun­ter's cap to gi­ve his gre­at ears full play. His fa­ce be­ca­me a mask, the skin drawn tightly over the bo­nes, the eyes li­ke re­ful­gent glo­bes of am­ber, the wi­de lips par­ted a lit­tle to show tho­se fang­li­ke fo­re­te­eth that hu­mans usu­al­ly did not no­ti­ce, re­min­ders that even the pe­ace­ful Nysso­mu had be­en in the­ir ti­me hun­ters who went equ­ip­ped with mo­re than blow­pi­pes and spe­ars.</p>
   <p>    The girls he­ard not­hing but the tink­le of drip­ping wa­ter; but Jagun sa­id: "They ha­ve fol­lo­wed us! Do­ubt­less they dis­co­ve­red our tracks in the bre­wery. Qu­ickly!"</p>
   <p>    He das­hed to a low ope­ning on the ot­her si­de of the dun­ge­on, which pro­ved to be the entry to anot­her ste­ep sta­ir­ca­se. It had a kind of ra­iling at Od­dling wa­ist he­ight, and a go­od thing, for the steps we­re fi­en­dishly slip­pery. The girls held on for the­ir li­ves as they all went hurt­ling down­ward, not no­ti­cing that they left be­hind them fa­int lu­mi­no­us fo­otp­rints that be­ca­me less and less bright as they des­cen­ded.</p>
   <p>    The wildly swin­ging lan­terns of the Od­dlings re­ve­aled not­hing of what lay ahe­ad un­til they re­ac­hed the very bot­tom. The­re they fo­und them­sel­ves in a dark ca­ver­no­us cham­ber, ank­le-de­ep in mud and wa­ter. The pla­ce was crow­ded with stran­ge, rus­ting mac­hi­nery and bro­ken pi­pes thic­ker than tree-trunks, which har­bo­red mo­re of the glo­wing sli­me dawd­lers as well as lar­ger flying cre­atu­res that to­ok fright at the­ir pre­sen­ce and skit­te­red off ho­oting in­to the dark­ness. Jagun led them to a cir­cu­lar pa­ved plat­form in the cham­ber's cen­ter. In the mid­dle of it was a ro­und black ho­le abo­ut two ells in width, circ­led by a low sto­ne curb.</p>
   <p>    Now, from abo­ve ca­me fa­intly the so­und of ar­mor clan­king, and hu­man vo­ices. Ani­gel cri­ed out in ter­ror. Jagun pe­ered in­to the well-li­ke ope­ning and then pic­ked up a sto­ne that lay ne­arby and cast it in. A long mo­ment la­ter the­re was a fa­int splash.</p>
   <p>    "Good!" he exc­la­imed. "I fe­ared that, it be­ing still the dry se­ason, the gre­at cis­tern wo­uld ha­ve dra­ined. But all is well and our es­ca­pe ro­ute is at hand." He bec­ko­ned to Ka­di­ya. "<emphasis>Co­me</emphasis>, my bra­ve kit! The cis­tern is the an­ci­ent wa­ter sto­ra­ge cham­ber of the Ci­ta­del, bu­ilt long ages be­fo­re the edi­fi­ce at­ta­ined its pre­sent si­ze. It is fed by a con­du­it le­ading to the Mu­tar Ri­ver north of Ci­ta­del Knoll. The Arc­hi­ma­ge has com­man­ded my brot­her Ra­pa­hun to bring a punt to the con­du­it's sec­ret mo­uth. All we ha­ve to do is jump."</p>
   <p>    "Jump?" Ka­di­ya re­pe­ated inc­re­du­lo­usly.</p>
   <p>    Jagun tuc­ked his lan­tern in­to his belt-wal­let. A wet­ting wo­uld not harm it at all. "I'll go first, and as­sist each of you as you splash down."</p>
   <p>    "But I can't swim!" Ani­gel wa­iled.</p>
   <p>    "The rest of us can, swe­eting," sa­id Im­mu en­co­ura­gingly. "We'll hold you up."</p>
   <p>    The no­ise of the ap­pro­ac­hing La­bor­no­ki for­ce was be­co­ming lo­uder.</p>
   <p>    "No ti­me to was­te," Jagun sa­id. "I'm off!"</p>
   <p>    With a che­ery wa­ve, he step­ped over the ed­ge and va­nis­hed. The­re was a dis­tant splash, and a hol­low call: "Jump! It's qu­ite all right!"</p>
   <p>    Kadiya to­ok a de­ep bre­ath. "May the Lords of the Air grant me co­ura­ge!"</p>
   <p>    She to­ok hold of her tril­li­um amu­let, ap­pro­ac­hed the well's lip, and jum­ped be­fo­re her ri­sing pa­nic co­uld fre­eze her musc­les.</p>
   <p>    She fell.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>White Lady, help! Oh, let me land softly</emphasis>…</p>
   <p>    She flo­ated.</p>
   <p>    "What is this?" Ka­di­ya's fe­ar tur­ned to stu­pe­fac­ti­on. She still grip­ped the amu­let. A light bre­eze, se­eming to blow up­ward in the dark­ness, told her that she drif­ted slowly in­to the depths. Down, down, down - and then she slip­ped in­to co­ol wa­ter as easily as a kni­fe in­to an oiled she­ath. She fo­und her­self af­lo­at. Jagun's strong non­hu­man hand to­wed her along un­til she bum­ped squ­ared sto­nes.</p>
   <p>    "There is a nar­row walk­way," the Od­dling sa­id. "Climb up and I will pass the lan­tern."</p>
   <p>    But she did not climb. Be­mu­sed, clin­ging to the led­ge in the dark, wa­ter drip­ping in­to her eyes, she whis­pe­red: "Jagun… old fri­end… I did not fall but waf­ted thro­ugh the air li­ke a win­ged sa­lith se­ed!"</p>
   <p>    "What say you, girl? " The Od­dling's vo­ice, usu­al­ly kind and dif­fi­dent, had shar­pe­ned.</p>
   <p>    "I clas­ped tight my tril­li­um amu­let, and pra­yed that I wo­uld land soft, and it hap­pe­ned. The very Lords of the Air bo­re me up."</p>
   <p>    "Triune God! This can­not be!"</p>
   <p>    "I did flo­at, I tell you! And lan­ded easily in the wa­ter."</p>
   <p>    Suddenly the­re was light, as Jagun ha­uled out his lan­tern and set it on the cis­tern led­ge. Ka­di­ya saw the lit­tle be­ing in the black wa­ter be­si­de her, his gre­at eyes bul­ging, his fa­ce wor­king, torn bet­we­en cons­ter­na­ti­on and an­xi­ety.</p>
   <p>    "The prop­hecy -but the­re is no ti­me for this!" he gro­aned. "The mystery must wa­it upon our sa­fe de­li­ve­ran­ce." He lif­ted his he­ad and cal­led out to Prin­cess Ani­gel to jump, his words ec­ho­ing in the vast hol­low dark.</p>
   <p>    Up in the well-cham­ber, Ani­gel he­ard and ap­pro­ac­hed the lip of the ho­le, with Im­mu en­co­ura­ging her.</p>
   <p>    "Jump!" the fa­ra­way vo­ice ur­ged. "Jump, da­ugh­ter of the King. Fe­ar not!"</p>
   <p>    And then ca­me Ka­di­ya's vo­ice, stran­gely exul­tant. "Jump, Ani! Hold fast to yo­ur amu­let and pray that you will fall slowly, and it will hap­pen! The tril­li­um amu­let is ma­gi­cal, and we can com­mand it!"</p>
   <p>    "What's this?" Im­mu le­aned over the ed­ge. "Prin­cess Ka­di­ya! Did this re­al­ly hap­pen?"</p>
   <p>    "It did, it did, de­ar Im­mu! And to think we ne­ver sus­pec­ted' Jump, Ani, and trust the Whi­te Lady's gift!"</p>
   <p>    Anigel grit­ted her te­eth, clutc­hed the pen­dant, and be­gan to tremb­le so vi­olently that Im­mu fe­ared she wo­uld fall in a fit. "I can­not jump! I'm af­ra­id! What if the ma­gic won't work for me?"</p>
   <p>    Orange fla­me­light now flic­ke­red dimly from the sta­ir­well. The clas­hing of ar­mor and arms ming­led with the so­und of men cur­sing the sli­me-dawd­lers. So­me­one cri­ed: "Prin­ce An­tar! This way! Fol­low the glo­wing fo­otp­rints down the sta­irs!"</p>
   <p>    "You must jump," Im­mu ple­aded. "De­arest Ani, they will so­on be upon us. He­re, let me ta­ke one hand, and do you hold yo­ur amu­let with the ot­her, and we will step off to­get­her."</p>
   <p>    But the girl le­apt back from the brink, eyes wi­de. "No! No!"</p>
   <p>    Jagun's vo­ice ro­se hol­lowly from the depths. "What are you wa­iting for, silly wo­men? Hurry! The knights da­re not fol­low, for they wo­uld sink from the we­ight of the­ir iron. Jump! Jump!"</p>
   <p>    "The Prin­cess is af­ra­id, and I can­not aban­don her," Im­mu cal­led.</p>
   <p>    "Then pull her, lack­wit!" Jagun scre­ec­hed.</p>
   <p>    Immu tur­ned to the co­we­ring Prin­cess, lan­tern high, but the girl drew back, sha­king her he­ad wildly, eyes now rol­ling and mo­uth wi­de in a gri­ma­ce of fe­ar-mad­ness. The lit­tle Od­dling fe­ma­le to­ok hold of Ani­gel's wrist and pul­led, but the girl fo­ught back. Both of them slip­ped and fell off the plat­form in­to the shal­low muck, whe­re they how­led and thras­hed abo­ut li­ke Skri­tek wor­rying the­ir prey.</p>
   <p>    It was thus that Prin­ce An­tar and his men fo­und and la­id hold of them.</p>
   <p>    Sodden and we­eping, Ani­gel and Im­mu we­re for­ced to the­ir fe­et. They sto­od with han­ging he­ads amidst the twel­ve ar­med men, who held high the­ir smo­king torc­hes and ma­de ru­de jests. But Prin­ce An­tar, his fa­ce ta­ut, sa­id: "Whe­re are the ot­hers?"</p>
   <p>    Immu stuck out her long pre­hen­si­le ton­gue at him. One of the knights drew his sword and wo­uld ha­ve sla­in her on the spot, but the Prin­ce cri­ed: "Hold, Ri­nu­tar!" The man step­ped back, grumb­ling.</p>
   <p>    Gently, the Prin­ce to­ok bed­rag­gled Ani­gel and lo­oked in­to her fa­ce. It was wit­ho­ut exp­res­si­on, the eyes tur­ned dull and de­ad. "Lady," sa­id he, "ha­ve they.go­ne in­to yon well?"</p>
   <p>    Anigel sa­id softly: "Yes. They ha­ve es­ca­ped. So kill us, but re­mem­ber that my sis­ter Ka­di­ya now pos­ses­ses gre­at ma­gic, and will one day wre­ak ven­ge­an­ce for the fo­ul de­eds you ha­ve do­ne to­day."</p>
   <p>    The as­semb­led knights exc­la­imed at this, and threw qu­es­ti­ons at the girl, but she wo­uld say no mo­re.</p>
   <p>    "Shall I put them to de­ath, my Prin­ce?" as­ked Sir Ri­nu­tar.</p>
   <p>    "Nay. They will ha­ve to be qu­es­ti­oned, so that we know what man­ner of enc­hant­ment - if any - op­po­ses our ru­le of Ru­wen­da."</p>
   <p>    "Just let me ha­ve the Od­dling slut," Ri­nu­tar sa­id eagerly, she­at­hing his sword and dra­wing a glit­te­ring po­ni­ard, "If I only toy with her a bit be­fo­re the eyes of the Prin­cess, she shall so­on tell us all that we want to know."</p>
   <p>    "Oh, no! Ple­ase, no…" Ani­gel's vo­ice tra­iled off in­to a mo­an, and she fell sen­se­less in­to the muddy wa­ter.</p>
   <p>    Prince An­tar bent to lift her, and as he held her fra­il body in his arms and lo­oked down upon her, pal­lid in the flic­ke­ring torch­light, he tho­ught that he had ne­ver se­en so be­a­uti­ful a wo­man, for all her sad and bes­mirc­hed sta­te. He was re­li­eved that he wo­uld now not be ob­li­ged to con­do­ne the tor­tu­re of the Od­dling hag, much less slay the lo­vely, help­less cre­atu­re who­se he­ad lay aga­inst his ar­mo­red bre­ast.</p>
   <p>    "We can do not­hing mo­re he­re," the Prin­ce sa­id. "It is pla­in that the ot­hers ha­ve elu­ded us, and that it is im­pos­sib­le for us to fol­low. We must aban­don this pur­su­it and ta­ke the­se pri­so­ners to my Ro­yal Fat­her. Let the­ir dis­po­si­ti­on be up to him."</p>
   <p>    The knights con­cur­red with ent­hu­si­asm, for the eeri­ness of the Ci­ta­del bo­wels had all but un­man­ned them. An­tar com­man­ded his mars­hal Sir Owa­non to bind Im­mu and carry her ac­ross his sho­ul­der, and he him­self did li­ke­wi­se with Prin­cess Ani­gel. Then they be­gan the long slow climb up­ward.</p>

   <p>    Haramis ran, fol­lo­wing the pat­te­ring, une­ven steps of the Od­dling co­urt mu­si­ci­an, and her he­ad­long flight told her things abo­ut her co­ura­ge - or lack of it - that she had ne­ver sus­pec­ted.</p>
   <p>    They tra­ve­led up­ward thro­ugh sec­ret pas­sa­ges and sta­ir­ways that be­ca­me ever mo­re cram­ped and cho­ked with dust and web­bing, pla­ces whe­re Uzun as­su­red her no fo­ot but the­irs had trod sin­ce the first Ru­wen­di­ans to­ok over the an­ci­ent Ci­ta­del. Fi­nal­ly the hid­den way en­ded, and they we­re for­ced in­to the open to fa­ce the bro­ad sto­ne spi­ral sta­ir­ca­se of the ke­ep's High To­wer, which was Ru­wen­di­an-ma­de. The wall fix­tu­res, wro­ught iron bas­kets that held tubs of oil with wicks, had be­en ligh­ted, and it was cle­ar that La­bor­no­ki se­arc­hers we­re al­re­ady ab­ro­ad in the to­wer.</p>
   <p>    Haramis and Uzun to­iled up­ward flo­or af­ter flo­or, past the enor­mo­us ro­yal lib­rary, whe­re Ha­ra­mis had spent many long happy days in study, her gre­atest ple­asu­re. The lib­rary le­vels we­re de­ser­ted, but Ha­ra­mis gas­ped with in­dig­na­ti­on at the sight of top­pled shel­ves and pre­ci­o­us vo­lu­mes left in ran­dom he­aps on the flo­or. Still, not­hing se­emed to be ma­li­ci­o­usly dest­ro­yed. <emphasis>No do­ubt Oro­gas­tus has gi­ven or­ders to pre­ser­ve this</emphasis>, she tho­ught. <emphasis>I cer­ta­inly wo­uld, in his pla­ce</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    In spi­te of her­self she felt a grud­ging ad­mi­ra­ti­on for the enemy sor­ce­rer, a man who had le­ar­ned to com­mand the light­ning, who had tra­ced out the con­vo­lu­ted path­way thro­ugh the Mazy Mi­re with his cla­ir­vo­yant eye. It was only thro­ugh the po­wer of Oro­gas­tus that Ru­wen­da had fal­len, and Ha­ra­mis res­pec­ted com­pe­ten­ce, even when it was tur­ned aga­inst her and hers. She was cu­ri­o­us abo­ut him; even as she fol­lo­wed Uzun up­ward, she won­de­red abo­ut the­ir enemy. <emphasis>What sort of man can he be, if he is a man at all</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    Haramis and Uzun ca­uti­o­usly mo­ved past the open iron ga­te of the an­tec­ham­ber to the to­wer's fif­te­enth flo­or, whe­re the crown jewels we­re kept. The Prin­cess fal­te­red when she he­ard the so­und of se­arc­hers wit­hin the clo­sed do­ors of the strong­ro­om, but no one ap­pe­ared to chal­len­ge them. They con­ti­nu­ed clim­bing past the next loc­ked and bar­red le­vel, whe­re cut and un­cut gems and fresh-min­ted spe­cie we­re sto­red, to the se­ven­te­enth flo­or, a kind of for­ti­fi­ed work­ro­om, whe­re da­ma­ged pre­ci­o­us ar­tic­les we­re re­pa­ired or mel­ted down. The­re we­re only two mo­re le­vels, Ha­ra­mis knew, bet­we­en them and the ro­of: first a small ar­mory, then the dor­mi­tory for gu­ards and cer­ta­in ot­her to­wer wor­kers.</p>
   <p>    Uzun pa­used to rest. He to­ok off his be­ret, mop­ped his swe­ating, li­ned fo­re­he­ad, and strug­gled to catch his bre­ath, whi­le Ha­ra­mis re­gar­ded him with con­cern. The Od­dling mu­si­ci­an had be­en her fri­end from early child­ho­od, and she was fond of him and trus­ted him, even tho­ugh he was not hu­man. The Nysso­mu, of all the abo­ri­gi­nes, in ex­ter­nal ap­pe­aran­ce most re­semb­led hu­mans, but the­ir blo­od was a qu­e­er dusky red, and the­ir bo­nes we­re oddly sha­ped wit­hin, and the­ir he­arts be­at on the ot­her si­de of the bre­ast. All of them cla­imed to ha­ve the Sight, and it was cer­ta­in that at ti­mes they co­uld spe­ak to one anot­her from a dis­tan­ce, com­mu­ni­ca­ting by me­ans of the spe­ech wit­ho­ut words. But most Ru­wen­di­ans be­li­eved them to be in­fe­ri­or be­ings for all that, lac­king in cul­tu­re and ba­rely ci­vi­li­zed, even tho­ugh they le­ar­ned hu­man ways qu­ickly eno­ugh and so­me­ti­mes even ex­cel­led hu­mans at the­ir own arts and crafts. As a small child, Ha­ra­mis had tho­ught for a ti­me that the Nysso­mu Od­dlings be­lon­ged to her Fat­her the King, as the ani­mals did. But her Fat­her had exp­la­ined to her that the lit­tle abo­ri­gi­nes we­re free, and had so­uls, and must be tre­ated as true pe­op­le…</p>
   <p>    When Uzun had res­ted, they re­su­med the­ir ste­althy climb. As they ap­pro­ac­hed the last sec­ti­on of sta­irs, Uzun ma­de Ha­ra­mis hang back whi­le he went to spy that all was cle­ar ahe­ad. She was be­co­ming inc­re­asingly an­xi­o­us abo­ut what wo­uld hap­pen when they re­ac­hed the to­wer's bat­tle­ments. As Uzun pe­eked over the ed­ge of the top-flo­or lan­ding, Ha­ra­mis frow­ned and drew her clo­ak tightly abo­ut her. A cold wind whist­led thro­ugh the ung­la­zed emb­ra­su­res and flat­te­ned the fla­mes of the bla­zing wall cres­sets.</p>
   <p>    Haramis was dis­ma­yed when Uzun fa­iled to bec­kon her on. He crept back down with one wi­de, clip­ped ta­lon pres­sed to his lips. Alarm sho­ne in his hu­ge yel­low eyes. When he re­ac­hed her si­de, he whis­pe­red: "A sing­le knight on gu­ard, Prin­cess. No do­ubt ot­hers are se­arc­hing the rest of this le­vel."</p>
   <p>    "I knew it!" Ha­ra­mis whis­pe­red. "We are trap­ped up he­re, with enemy sol­di­ers abo­ve and be­low us! Yo­ur Whi­te Lady's plan has fa­iled."</p>
   <p>    "Hush, hush," the Od­dling ple­aded. "I think the­re may be a way past, but it will de­mand that you be bra­ve, and mo­ve qu­ickly. Can you tie up yo­ur gown? "</p>
   <p>    She nod­ded grimly, drop­ped her clo­ak, and set the Crown ca­re­ful­ly on top of it. Then she kil­ted her skirts thro­ugh her jewe­led belt un­til they hung blo­used to her kne­es. She wrap­ped the Crown in her clo­ak, ti­ed the cor­ners to­get­her, and slung the bund­le over her sho­ul­der. She lo­oked to Uzun. "And now?"</p>
   <p>    "The pa­ra­pet is re­ac­hed by a lad­der ne­ar to the sta­irs, per­haps fo­ur ells from whe­re the gu­ard stands. He has be­en wo­un­ded in one arm and it is bo­und up, but his sword-arm is qu­ite who­le. He is very li­kely fa­ti­gu­ed and sick of the fu­ti­le se­arc­hing, which has dep­ri­ved him of the an­ti­ci­pa­ted joys of lo­oting, fe­as­ting, and drin­king."</p>
   <p>    "And vi­ola­ting the Ci­ta­del wo­men," Ha­ra­mis ad­ded. "Such will do­ubt­less now be my fa­te, be­fo­re they slit my thro­at and cast my body in­to the ces­spit."</p>
   <p>    Uzun lo­oked at her rep­ro­ach­ful­ly. "Prin­cess, you will be har­med only over my de­ad body. Trust in the Whi­te Lady and lis­ten to my plan, I beg of you."</p>
   <p>    Haramis pla­yed ner­vo­usly with the tril­li­um amu­let, run­ning one thumb over and over the smo­oth am­ber that en­ca­sed the small black flo­wer bud. <emphasis>I don't do­ubt yo­ur de­di­ca­ti­on</emphasis>, she tho­ught, <emphasis>but "over yo­ur de­ad body" may not be dif­fi­cult for ar­med sol­di­ers to ac­hi­eve</emphasis>. Not wan­ting to hurt the lit­tle Od­dling's fe­elings, she sa­id me­rely: "I am lis­te­ning, Uzun."</p>
   <p>    "I shall spring sud­denly up from the sta­ir­well and dart to­ward the knight, pre­ten­ding to be sca­red out of my wits."</p>
   <p>    "If you are as frigh­te­ned as I am, that sho­uld pre­sent no dif­fi­culty."</p>
   <p>    "I shall ca­per and gib­ber and roll my eyes in and out on the­ir stalks." She knew that what he was sa­ying was a re­al sac­ri­fi­ce; she had not se­en him ext­ru­de his eyes sin­ce she was a very small child, when he had so­me­ti­mes do­ne it to amu­se her or her sis­ters. Ho­we­ver, she had le­ar­ned be­fo­re she was six or so that no adult Nysso­mu wo­uld show such a lack of cont­rol un­less he was vir­tu­al­ly be­si­de him­self.</p>
   <p>    "I shall dist­ract the vil­la­in," Uzun con­ti­nu­ed. "Me­anw­hi­le, you must climb up the lad­der and open the up­per trap. I shall fol­low, and to­get­her we'll overth­row the lad­der and slam shut the trap­do­or and bar it aga­inst him."</p>
   <p>    "And then? Even if we can hold off the sol­di­ers - and as­su­ming the­ir sor­ce­rer do­esn't blast us with one of his dam­nab­le light­ning bolts - the top of the to­wer is no pla­ce for a si­ege. We co­uld, of co­ur­se, die he­ro­ical­ly of star­va­ti­on and thirst, but that will hardly help Ru­wen­da!"</p>
   <p>    "I don't know what hap­pens then!" Uzun snap­ped. "I only fol­low the Whi­te Lady's com­mands! Oh, Prin­cess, can you not le­ave off yo­ur in­ces­sant qu­es­ti­oning? Mo­re knights may ap­pe­ar at any mi­nu­te! Just gi­ve me a mo­ment to se­ize this man's at­ten­ti­on, and then fol­low qu­ickly."</p>
   <p>    He hop­ped up the steps and in­to the gu­ards' an­te­ro­om.</p>
   <p>    Haramis he­ard the sol­di­er cur­se, and then ca­me the rin­ging swish of a drawn sword. But Uzun was cack­ling li­ke an in­sa­ne thing, his fo­ots­teps dan­cing over the bo­ards, and the knight's filthy lan­gu­age chan­ged to a start­led guf­faw. Ten­sing, Ha­ra­mis lo­oked over the top step and saw the nor­mal­ly sta­id mu­si­ci­an ca­vor­ting abo­ut, long po­in­ted ears co­mi­cal­ly af­lap li­ke the wings of a night-ca­ro­ler drunk on fer­men­ted fru­it. His eyes pop­ped in and out of the­ir soc­kets on stalks, and his lol­ling ton­gue co­iled and un­co­iled whi­le the­ir ow­ner ho­oted ri­di­cu­lo­usly up and down the mu­si­cal sca­le.</p>
   <p>    The knight do­ub­led over with la­ugh­ter, lo­we­ring his sword, and in a flash Ha­ra­mis scramb­led up the lad­der and flung open the ce­iling-trap.</p>
   <p>    "Uzun! Co­me up! Hurry!" She knelt on the ro­of and grip­ped the he­avy lad­der just as the Od­dling stre­aked over to it and be­gan clam­be­ring up the rungs. The bam­bo­oz­led knight cri­ed out an alarm and stumb­led to­ward the lad­der wa­ving his sword at Uzun. Ha­ra­mis grab­bed Uzun's wrist and ha­uled him up be­si­de her. The sword, aimed at his ank­le, be­ca­me em­bed­ded in the lad­der's rung. To­get­her they ga­ve a mighty he­ave and thrust the lad­der away, whi­le the knight was still clum­sily trying to pull his sword from the wo­od.</p>
   <p>    Entangled and un­ba­lan­ced, the ar­mo­red form fell with an ear split­ting crash. Sho­uts ca­me from wit­hin the dor­mi­tory, and as Uzun slam­med shut the trap­do­or and bar­red it, mo­re knights of La­bor­nok rus­hed forth to in­ves­ti­ga­te.</p>
   <p>    There was a strong wind up on the High To­wer ro­of; re­do­lent of the mars­hes, it to­re at the low-lying fog that hid the Mazy Mi­re and the lo­wer re­ac­hes of the Ci­ta­del. The blo­od-co­lo­red La­bor­no­ki ban­ner snap­ped from the tall flags­taff at the si­de of the to­wer fa­cing the ri­ver. Di­rectly be­low, so­me fi­res still bur­ned among the bu­il­dings of the in­ner ward, flic­ke­ring eerily be­ne­ath the mist. The de­ep blue sky was bright with stars, and in the west the Trip­le Mo­ons mo­ved to­ward the­ir co­nj­unc­ti­on, which wo­uld oc­cur at full pha­se, fo­ur we­eks hen­ce.</p>
   <p>    Fear and in­dig­na­ti­on over her plight now suf­fu­sed the Prin­cess with a bur­ning an­ger. They we­re in a cul-de-sac with no exit. Knights we­re smas­hing on the trap­do­or with swords and bat­tle­axes, and so­on it wo­uld gi­ve way. But she wo­uld not let the La­bor­no­ki ta­ke her ali­ve! Bet­ter to le­ap from the to­wer's bat­tle­ments -</p>
   <p>    The trap­do­or bro­ke open and a knight who­se hel­met was a gro­tes­que iron mask ha­uled him­self up, who­oping in tri­umph.</p>
   <p>    Haramis sto­od with Uzun at the very brink of the pa­ra­pet, clutc­hing her amu­let as she had when ter­ri­fi­ed by night­ma­res as a child. But this night­ma­re was re­al.</p>
   <p>    "Lords of the Air, pro­tect us!"</p>
   <p>    Uzun cri­ed: "Whi­te Lady! Be thou at her aid!"</p>
   <p>    Three ar­mo­red men bo­un­ded to­ward them with we­apons ra­ised. But at the sa­me mo­ment the­re was a gre­at blast of wind, and the stars we­re blot­ted out by two hu­ge dark forms swo­oping down. They ga­ve vo­ice li­ke monst­ro­us bra­zen trum­pets, and one sto­oped and drop­ped stra­ight at the thun­derst­ruck ar­mo­red trio.</p>
   <p>    "Lammergeiers!" one of the knights yel­ped. "Be­wa­re!" But an ins­tant la­ter, a gi­gan­tic wing bow­led the three men over li­ke dolls and swept them over the ed­ge of the pa­ra­pet. The­ir vo­ices blen­ded in one scre­am, which las­ted for se­ve­ral se­conds be­fo­re stop­ping ab­ruptly. The­ir com­pa­ni­ons, who we­re just emer­ging from the trap­do­or, dod­ged back down to sa­fety. The­re was a clan­ging and a smas­hing and yells of pa­in and fury as se­ve­ral pre­su­mably fell from the lad­der. Ot­hers of the La­bor­no­ki kept the­ir fo­oting and watc­hed, alt­ho­ugh no­ne da­red to ven­tu­re out.</p>
   <p>    Later they wo­uld tell King Volt­rik and the sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus what they had se­en: two gi­gan­tic cre­atu­res with whi­te bo­di­es and wings ban­ded black and whi­te, so­aring down to land on the High To­wer ro­of, the­ir ta­lons stri­king sparks from the sto­nes, and the­ir eyes and to­ot­hed be­aks glis­te­ning in the dim mo­on­light. Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis mo­un­ted one, and the Od­dling mu­si­ci­an Uzun clam­be­red on­to the back of the ot­her. Then the gre­at lam­mer­ge­i­ers spre­ad the­ir wings and to­ok flight, be­aring the fu­gi­ti­ves away to the north­west, to­ward the dis­tant ram­part of the Oho­gan Mo­un­ta­ins.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    The ig­no­mi­ni­o­us ret­re­at ad­ded fu­el to Ka­di­ya's an­ger. She tho­ught of them be­ing dis­co­ve­red cre­eping on hands and kne­es along the nar­row, slip­pery led­ge of the con­du­it. Sin­ce it had be­en di­su­sed for co­unt­less hund­reds, the Ru­wen­di­ans ha­ving bu­ilt a new wa­ter supply system when they to­ok over the an­ci­ent ci­ta­del, this way was not only fal­ling to pi­eces but was ne­arly cho­ked with no­iso­me and rot­ting deb­ris. Jagun had slung the lan­tern abo­ut his neck, but ti­me af­ter ti­me he was for­ced to pa­use and pass the light back to Ka­di­ya un­til he had bro­ken away a mass of de­ad branc­hes or pa­wed up a soggy hays­tack of marsh grass. In so­me pla­ces the ma­sonry had crumb­led ut­terly, so that they wa­ded, swam, and wor­ked the­ir way aro­und obs­tac­les. The kne­es of Ka­di­ya's le­at­her trews we­re so­on worn thro­ugh, the skin be­ne­ath scra­ped raw. Un­der her bre­ath she mut­te­red words she had he­ard in the stab­les but ne­ver be­fo­re vo­iced alo­ud.</p>
   <p>    "Is the ri­ver far?" she de­man­ded at last, nur­sing hands torn pa­in­ful­ly by thorn ferns she had ta­ken an equ­al part in cle­aring away.</p>
   <p>    "Not far. If it we­re day we co­uld see the light ahe­ad, for the­se ac­cur­sed ferns can­not grow in to­tal dark­ness. Ta­ke spe­ci­al ca­re now, for this is an ex­cel­lent lur­king pla­ce for gra­do­liks or wa­ter-worms."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya spat out a lump of fo­ul tas­ting mud and felt, ri­sing to fla­me wit­hin her, that an­ger which had be­en born at the first alarm.</p>
   <p>    "May the ever­las­ting mud sink them all! May the vi­pers of Vi­born la­ce them thro­at and wrist - "</p>
   <p>    "Save yo­ur bre­ath, King's Da­ugh­ter. Do­ubt­less in ti­me the spi­rits will pro­vi­de fa­tes for yo­ur ene­mi­es even you may find ade­qu­ate."</p>
   <p>    "No fa­te sa­ve that I de­al myself!" she fla­red back.</p>
   <p>    His hand grab­bed her wrist in a hold Ka­di­ya knew of old to be a war­ning. She swal­lo­wed and was still.</p>
   <p>    Now they wa­ded, slip­ped and slid over qu­aking mud, net­ted by a web of small ri­ver­lets, un­til they at last fo­und a ti­me-rus­ted grill and wor­ked the­ir way aro­und it whe­re part of the sto­ne which had anc­ho­red it had fal­len away. Abo­ve was open sky at last. On­ce aga­in Jagun ca­uti­oned her with outst­retc­hed hand.</p>
   <p>    He mo­ved a lit­tle fart­her from her, his he­ad high. Ap­pa­rently he was lis­te­ning in­tently, as well as using his hun­ter's sen­se of smell to test the sa­fely of that small stretch of for­got­ten was­te­land.</p>
   <p>    "The La­bor­no­ki must ha­ve es­tab­lis­hed an out­post not far from he­re."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya lo­oked up over her sho­ul­der, ha­ving to stra­in her he­ad at an ang­le to see bet­ter. Fi­re abo­ve, lo­oping fla­mes. The­re was lit­tle eno­ugh wit­hin the Ci­ta­del to fu­el that vic­tory bla­ze un­less tho­se who had ri­ven its de­fen­ses had rip­ped old han­gings from the walls, smas­hed all the fur­nis­hings. Dis­tant sho­uts, shrill scre­ams, aga­inst which Ka­di­ya tri­ed to ste­el her­self- stri­ving to shut out of her mind what must be hap­pe­ning the­re.</p>
   <p>    "May I li­ve to gi­ve you new mo­uths to la­ugh with stra­ight ac­ross yo­ur filthy thro­ats!" Her la­ce­ra­ted hand cros­sed her bre­ast to se­ek her belt kni­fe, to­uc­hed the amu­let which had slip­ped out thro­ugh a te­ar in her shirt.</p>
   <p>    If the po­wer of this had be­en ab­le to waft her down in­to the cis­tern… well, it might ha­ve even mo­re to of­fer. She clutc­hed the am­ber in one hand so tightly that she might be trying to for­ce it in­to her wo­un­ded flesh.</p>
   <p>    Will-will and strength - and what words she co­uld sum­mon:</p>
   <p>    "Lords of the Air, all ye who hold by the God Tri­une, may thy po­wer be lent to mi­ne, thy will to mi­ne for this, that the­se be bro­ught to de­ath even as they ha­ve sla­in tho­se who call upon you. Pay blo­od pri­ce, ye of the up­per ways, grant me blo­od pri­ce!"</p>
   <p>    With the amu­let grip­ped as tightly as she wo­uld ha­ve held a sword, Ka­di­ya po­in­ted to the light of the ho­lo­ca­ust be­hind her.</p>
   <p>    Her ans­wer was a tor­tu­red scre­am out of the night, a ho­ar­se call for anot­her keg.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya's lips tigh­te­ned aga­inst her te­eth. "It do­es not work!" Al­most she ma­de to fling the amu­let from her, but her fin­gers we­re so loc­ked that she co­uld not lo­ose them.</p>
   <p>    "No," Jagun ans­we­red qu­i­etly, as he might spe­ak to so­ot­he an im­pa­ti­ent child.</p>
   <p>    "But I used my will! I did so mo­re strongly than when I went in­to the well." She ope­ned her fin­gers one by one to sur­vey what she held. "Or do­es it work for me alo­ne? Will it carry me to the Whi­te Lady? Or both of us-?"</p>
   <p>    Jagun watc­hed her pa­ti­ently. "One can only try, King's Da­ugh­ter."</p>
   <p>    Again Ka­di­ya's fin­gers imp­ri­so­ned the amu­let.</p>
   <p>    "By what po­wer li­ves wit­hin you -bring us now to she who ma­de you -the Arc­hi­ma­ge!"</p>
   <p>    The night held fast abo­ut them.</p>
   <p>    "Carry me, then, if the­re be any vir­tue wit­hin you, sor­ce­ress's gift!"</p>
   <p>    No ans­wer.</p>
   <p>    "So! Did I then dre­am it all?" Ka­di­ya as­ked of the night. "Was I so be­reft of my sen­ses, Jagun?"</p>
   <p>    "Little one, I can­not ans­wer you truly, it was too dark wit­hin. Per­haps I mis­to­ok the ti­me of yo­ur jump. I am no de­aler in old wis­dom."</p>
   <p>    She drop­ped the pen­dant, to let it dang­le on its cha­in. "Ma­gic se­ems to ha­ve de­ser­ted us, Jagun - if it ever to­uc­hed us at all. Well, at le­ast that flat­land scum can­not ho­pe to tra­ce us thro­ugh the Mazy Mi­re."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya had be­en many ti­mes in the swamps - but only along well-mar­ked Od­dling ro­utes. The­re we­re ot­her sec­ret ones, so­me be­ing the je­alo­usly gu­ar­ded know­led­ge of sing­le-fa­mily clans. It was a po­int of ho­nor not to re­mem­ber any gu­idan­ces if one was not of the Kin. Now she bent her he­ad clo­ser to the hunc­hed sha­dow of Jagun to ask grimly:</p>
   <p>    "Those pla­ins-craw­lers da­re not fol­low us the­re, is that not so?"</p>
   <p>    Half con­ce­aled by bus­hes, the Od­dling was gro­ping in the wa­ter ne­ar a tumb­le of rocks.</p>
   <p>    "Their sor­ce­rer has cal­led the Skri­tek. Al­so Pel­lan has jo­ined them."</p>
   <p>    "Pellan!" That one of the merc­hants' gu­ides - lo­red al­most from birth in the mat­ter of hid­den tra­ils-wo­uld bet­ray them se­emed ut­terly im­pos­sib­le. But be­fo­re yes­ter­day she wo­uld ha­ve sworn that it was im­pos­sib­le that Ka­di­ya of the Ho­use of Kra­in wo­uld ha­ve bel­li­ed li­ke a sna­ke ac­ross suc­king mud.</p>
   <p>    "Voltrik holds that which so­me find it dif­fi­cult to re­fu­se." Jagun's vo­ice was cold and hard. He stra­igh­te­ned up, brin­ging out of the mud a sto­ut ro­pe which en­ded in de­ep wa­ter. On this he pul­led with ca­re. "The La­bor­no­ki King has po­wer which rests on we­alth. And we­alth co­mes from the ef­forts of men. What king grubs in the mo­un­ta­in for pre­ci­o­us ores, lays hand to axe to down tre­es, bes­pe­aks stran­ge and ra­re finds from the swamp pe­op­le? It is tho­se of Pel­lan's kin who gat­her the­se ric­hes. Volt­rik ta­kes a mighty sha­re, yes. But he can grant the le­avings to tho­se who ser­ve him, and even tho­se le­avings will ma­ke many men rich. Co­me, Far­se­er." He used now the na­me she had be­en so pro­ud to ga­in half a ye­ar ear­li­er - a swamp-gi­ven na­me that bro­ught with it res­pect. "Far­se­er, the­re is yet a long way to go."</p>
   <p>    She was not re­al­ly lis­te­ning, still sha­ken at the tho­ught of Pel­lan's tre­ac­hery. Why, she knew him - smi­ling, ple­asant, he had even gu­ided her to one of the stran­ge ru­ins.</p>
   <p>    "Did Pel­lan truly act for ga­in as you say, Jagun? Or out of fe­ar? He has kin wit­hin the flat­lands. We ha­ve se­en this mur­de­ro­us King and what he wo­uld do to tho­se who cross him. Fe­ar is migh­ti­er per­haps than ma­gic. Did not Ani­gel sur­ren­der to fe­ar?"</p>
   <p>    "Judge not so qu­ickly, King's Da­ugh­ter. Yo­ur sis­ter ma­de no wil­ling sur­ren­der. Fe­ar can be­co­me so gre­at as to gi­ve birth to mad­ness. In that the­re is no gu­ilt."</p>
   <p>    "Only we­ak­ness," Ka­di­ya mut­te­red.</p>
   <p>    "Weakness you may tas­te of al­so, and even you may know gre­at fe­ar. Spe­ak not aga­inst any one who­se bur­den you ha­ve not we­ig­hed yo­ur­self."</p>
   <p>    Jagun ga­ve a jerk to the ro­pe and the­re gli­ded out of the swamp mist a sto­ut punt stoc­ked with po­les and a scul­ling oar, as well as a lar­ge bund­le well wrap­ped aga­inst the damp.</p>
   <p>    "Blessings be upon my brot­her!" Jagun sa­id. "He has fol­lo­wed very well the Arc­hi­ma­ge's inst­ruc­ti­ons. Now we ha­ve our way of tra­vel, fo­od, and clot­hing al­so."</p>
   <p>    The punt was big eno­ugh for fo­ur pas­sen­gers, and Ka­di­ya re­ali­zed with a stab of sor­row that Ani­gel and Im­mu had be­en me­ant to tra­vel with them. But su­rely they we­re now help­less wit­hin enemy hands. And Ha­ra­mis? Ka­di­ya had no way of kno­wing. This night she sto­od alo­ne, and on her wo­uld do­ubt­less fall the bur­den of re­sis­tan­ce aga­inst the in­va­ders.</p>
   <p>    They em­bar­ked and Jagun mo­un­ted the scul­ling oar at the stern.</p>
   <p>    Their craft be­gan to mo­ve up the slug­gish stre­am which skir­ted the nort­he­as­tern part of the Ci­ta­del. For a mo­ment the mists par­ted and Ka­di­ya ca­ught a glimp­se of the mighty cast­le-crow­ned rock and a star or two abo­ve it.</p>
   <p>    Her ho­me -in the hands of the enemy! And whe­re we­re her sis­ters? They might be al­re­ady de­ad - or wor­se.</p>
   <p>    NO! Her hands went to her he­ad as if she co­uld re­ach in­si­de and pull out the pic­tu­res for­ming the­re. She must not think of that - she must not!</p>
   <p>    "Where do we go?" The­re we­re many kinds of re­sis­tan­ce pos­sib­le. Whi­le ven­ge­an­ce wo­uld cer­ta­inly be hers, she co­uld not bring down King Volt­rik alo­ne. Ha­ra­mis, Ani­gel - if they li­ved - might they jo­in with her?</p>
   <p>    She had not spo­ken tho­se na­mes alo­ud, yet Jagun ans­we­red, and not for the first ti­me she was start­led, for now he sa­id:</p>
   <p>    "For yo­ur sis­ters are ro­ads wa­iting al­so. It is only our own way we must ke­ep in mind now."</p>
   <p>    "Where do we go?" she de­man­ded aga­in.</p>
   <p>    "You must ans­wer that, Far­se­er."</p>
   <p>    "How?" She had set­tled in­to the punt, glan­cing back on­ce mo­re at the Ci­ta­del. The fi­re the­re was dying. Still she felt that the swamp se­emed un­na­tu­ral­ly warm. She lo­oked down. Un­der her mud-sme­ared, rent bo­di­ce the­re was a pa­le spot of light. She clap­ped a hand to it - the amu­let!</p>
   <p>    Kadiya drew it forth. It se­emed to mo­ve on her gri­med palm. A spark of light po­in­ted skyward as if from so­me stran­ge cand­le. Her bre­ath ca­me rag­gedly. Per­haps af­ter all it still held ma­gic! But ma­gic cer­ta­inly did not work ac­cor­ding to her own will, she had al­re­ady pro­ven that. Ste­el in the hand was mo­re cer­ta­in.</p>
   <p>    Voltrik's so­oth­sa­yer Oro­gas­tus -he de­alt in ma­gic which obe­yed him. He co­uld even com­mand his own King, tre­ating him as tho­ugh he we­re but a to­ol and a toy.</p>
   <p>    Tool and toy! That might be the story of her own birth, and the Arc­hi­ma­ge's gift-gi­ving! Per­haps ma­gic was li­ke all el­se -it grew old, rus­ted, brit­tle, bro­ken when it was cal­led upon too la­te.</p>
   <p>    Under Jagun's stir­ring the punt ma­de a sharp turn, car­rying them in a new di­rec­ti­on. She saw the spark mo­ve as might the ne­ed­le of a com­pass.</p>
   <p>    "Jagun, this is a gu­ide!"</p>
   <p>    "What is?" as­ked the Od­dling, we­ari­ness in his vo­ice. He had drawn clo­ser to the bank and anc­ho­red them with a sto­ne-we­igh­ted ro­pe. Now he was tug­ging at the wrap­pings of the bund­le.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya held out her hand and told him ex­ci­tedly of the chan­ge in the spark of light.</p>
   <p>    "So -then it po­ints the way to the Arc­hi­ma­ge's dwel­ling at Noth. That is go­od, for I knew of few tra­ils thit­her. No­ne of the Nysso­mu hunt the­re. That co­untry, the Gol­den­mi­re, is Uis­gu ter­ri­tory."</p>
   <p>    From the wrap­ping he had sha­ken out tu­nics and bre­eks wo­ven from aro­ma­tic grass by his pe­op­le. The­re we­re al­so ho­od­ca­pes of fe­dok skin, which co­uld turn asi­de a tor­rent, and wo­od-so­led san­dals. Af­ter the clot­hing ca­me two stop­pe­red jars which he ope­ned, and the scent of the well-crus­hed and cre­amed herbs wit­hin fo­ught aga­inst the swamp odors.</p>
   <p>    "You can wash and dry yo­ur le­at­hers la­ter, if they can be re­pa­ired. But now you must be of the swamp."</p>
   <p>    She skin­ned out of her gar­ments, which we­re in­de­ed torn, and red­res­sed, ta­king the cre­am from the jar to ano­int her skin and even plas­ter thro­ugh her tang­led ha­ir. The in­sect li­fe of the swamp co­uld ma­ke li­fe a tor­tu­re for any wit­ho­ut such pro­tec­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    One mo­re pre­ca­uti­on Jagun pro­du­ced, this ti­me from a lo­op on his belt. It was a hun­ter's trick Ka­di­ya had se­en be­fo­re. Bet­we­en his fin­gers he held a pi­pe which was hardly mo­re than a re­ed in thick­ness. This he put to his lips. The so­und he pro­du­ced was very thin and wit­ho­ut a tu­ne, but he was ans­we­red.</p>
   <p>    Passage along any wa­ter­way of the Mi­re co­uld bring a bet­ra­ying si­len­ce which wo­uld alert any trac­ker. Ka­di­ya had not be­en truly awa­re of the qu­i­et abo­ut them un­til Jagun's pi­ping un­le­as­hed the nor­mal so­unds of li­fe. Now she he­ard the buzz of in­sects, small gul­ping and pe­eping so­unds, and the de­epth­ro­ated call of a gul­bard on the hunt, so clo­se that she co­uld see its soft grey-gre­en body lur­king just at the sur­fa­ce of the murky wa­ter. Ahe­ad, all was dark­ness.</p>
   <p>    They scul­led up the bro­ad Mu­tar slowly, sta­ying far out from the in­ha­bi­ted so­ut­hern sho­re. Jagun was es­pe­ci­al­ly ca­uti­o­us as they pas­sed the wharfs of Ru­wen­da Mar­ket at the Knoll's wes­tern ed­ge, whe­re the ri­ver swung away at last from its skir­ting of the high gro­und and en­te­red the Black­mi­re. This den­sely fo­res­ted re­gi­on ex­ten­ded over many squ­are le­agu­es bet­we­en the Ci­ta­del and the ru­ins of Tre­vis­ta, and re­ce­ived its na­me from the sun­less as­pect of the swamp­land, whe­re tall, in­tert­wi­ned tre­es we­re ma­ted by le­afy vi­nes and ot­her growth in­to a den­se ca­nopy, so that the sur­fa­ce was ne­arly al­ways in sha­dow.</p>
   <p>    After a whi­le the ri­ver bro­ke up in­to bra­ided wa­ter­co­ur­ses wit­ho­ut a cle­arly de­fi­ned ma­inst­re­am. The­re we­re tho­usands of swampy is­lands and mud­bars wit­ho­ut num­ber in this part of the Black­mi­re, so that an or­di­nary hu­man tra­ve­ler wo­uld ha­ve be­co­me ho­pe­les­sly lost trying to find the way in bro­ad day­light - much less at night, in in­ter­mit­tent patc­hes of mist. But Jagun scul­led con­fi­dently on­ward.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya hud­dled in the bow, nib­bling now and then at a pi­ece of adop ro­ot, the tu­ber which ma­de up much of the­ir fo­od sto­res. The­se se­emed to suck all the mo­is­tu­re from the mo­uth and left a bit­ter af­ter­tas­te but she knew them for the tra­vel ra­ti­on of the Od­dlings. To gnaw at one was to re­mem­ber her first ven­tu­re in­to the de­ep swamp with Jagun.</p>
   <p>    She had de­ligh­ted so in the stran­ge ani­mals and plants he had bro­ught to show her that she had pes­te­red him to let her vi­sit the Mazy Mi­re. Her fat­her had very re­luc­tantly gi­ven his per­mis­si­on and for a who­le day she had tra­ve­led thro­ugh a gre­en glo­aming ali­ve with myste­ri­o­us cre­atu­res and plants. That ven­tu­re had chan­ged her who­le li­fe. Ka­di­ya had sworn then to le­arn the ways of the swamp and tho­se dwel­ling wit­hin.</p>
   <p>    However, she had ne­ver go­ne whe­re the amu­let spark now po­in­ted - to­ward the re­mo­test and most sec­ret lands. Ahe­ad, the co­untry of the fri­endly Nysso­mu and the shyer Uis­gu mer­ged with that of the abo­mi­nab­le Skri­tek.</p>
   <p>    Skritek! The­ir very ap­pe­aran­ce was a hor­ror out of so­me night­ma­re. Tho­ugh they stro­de two-leg­ged, the skulls atop the­ir si­newy, mot­tled bo­di­es bo­re no re­semb­lan­ce to eit­her hu­man or Od­dling. Flat­te­ned, the fo­re­part elon­ga­ted in­to a sno­ut which split to show gre­enish fangs, dag­ger sharp, the he­ad of a Skri­tek se­emed de­sig­ned by na­tu­re to rend and kill.</p>
   <p>    Their eyes we­re bul­bo­us, as we­re tho­se of all the swamp Folk, set high on the­ir he­ads and so­mew­hat to the si­de so they had a wi­de ran­ge of vi­si­on. Un­li­ke the Od­dlings', ho­we­ver, tho­se eyes we­re not gol­den but a vi­vid oran­ge, scar­let stre­aked. The gre­en-blue of the­ir bo­di­es blen­ded easily with the Mi­re ve­ge­ta­ti­on ex­cept for tho­se eyes; and so they usu­al­ly awa­ited the­ir prey al­most sub­mer­ged in the swamp, dra­ped with wa­ter fern, and pul­led the­ir vic­tims un­der. Thus we­re they spo­ken of in the swamp­land as the Drow­ners.</p>
   <p>    Most knew them only thro­ugh tra­ve­lers' ta­les, which we­re grisly eno­ugh. In the­ir own co­untry, which bor­de­red on the fart­hest known Od­dling ter­ri­tory, the Skri­tek we­re sa­id to walk boldly, car­rying spe­ars and kni­ves on oc­ca­si­on, alt­ho­ugh the­ir stron­gest ar­ma­ment was the­ir own fangs and the ta­lons on the­ir three-fin­ge­red hands. The­ir pas­sa­ge was no­ise­less but the cho­king musky odor of the­ir bo­di­es bet­ra­yed them. They we­re known to roll in mud wal­lows in­to which they tos­sed ill-smel­ling herbs to mask the­ir stench. In the­ir own ter­ri­tory they at­tac­ked wit­ho­ut war­ning, fren­zi­ed by blo­od lust, eit­her te­aring the­ir vic­tims apart and de­vo­uring them - so­me­ti­mes still li­ving - or car­rying them away to tor­tu­re them to de­ath.</p>
   <p>    "You spo­ke of the Skri­tek." Ka­di­ya had wrap­ped her arms aro­und her­self, chil­led now. "By what kind of po­wer co­uld tho­se mons­ters be ma­de to obey any will sa­ve the­ir own?"</p>
   <p>    Jagun ans­we­red: "By the will of that one who­se sha­dow over­re­ac­hes even that of the King he is sup­po­sed to ser­ve - Oro­gas­tus. Do not down-say him as a so­oth­sa­yer, a pur­ve­yor of petty tric­kery. He is not one who fol­lows fa­irs to re­ad the fu­tu­re by cas­ting co­lo­red sands. The­re are tho­se born with unu­su­al ta­lents, King's Da­ugh­ter, and most do not mi­su­se the­ir gifts. Ho­we­ver, the­re are so­me adepts who tre­ad a dar­ker path in the­ir se­arch for stran­ge know­led­ge, and such will spend a li­fe­ti­me se­arc­hing for that which gi­ves them po­wer-that po­wer which is not of hand or sword, but rat­her of tho­ught and will - over ot­hers. The­re are many sto­ri­es of Oro­gas­tus which ha­ve co­me even to our ears he­re in the Mi­re. One can per­haps dis­co­unt a half or two-thirds of such ru­mors -but what re­ma­ins is di­re eno­ugh! Li­ke calls to li­ke - it may be that the Skri­tek re­cog­ni­ze in this King's wi­zard a for­ce akin to what mo­ves them. Per­haps, as yet, they are not his cre­atu­res; but the­ir pre­sent al­li­an­ce rests on a very old law: if yo­ur enemy is al­so mi­ne, then un­til he is de­ad we shall walk a com­mon path."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya sig­hed. "Jagun, you ha­ve long be­en my te­ac­her and still you know much mo­re that I must le­arn. I am so­me­ti­mes hardly mo­re than that child you hu­mo­red when you first bro­ught me in­to this co­untry. Yo­ur pe­op­le na­med me Far­se­er, but that is me­re flat­tery. Yes, I may see so­me things well, but in ot­her ways I am blind!"</p>
   <p>    "To know that one is blind is to be­gin to see," Jagun rep­li­ed qu­i­etly.</p>
   <p>    He was ste­ering them to­ward one of the lar­ger hum­mocks. Over the­ir he­ads the patc­hes of sky we­re gre­ying. Dawn was not far off. "Pe­ril not only thre­atens the body, it al­so stri­kes aga­inst the spi­rit."</p>
   <p>    "I do not un­ders­tand."</p>
   <p>    "Persons, even tho­se you on­ce lo­ved and trus­ted, might want to use you as a to­ol, even as I use this oar to ste­er by."</p>
   <p>    "Use me?" Ka­di­ya was inc­re­du­lo­us. "If they tri­ed they wo­uld fa­ce my ste­el!"</p>
   <p>    "Fight, al­ways fight," the Od­dling's vo­ice was gent­le moc­kery. "My lit­tle Far­se­er, you ha­ve spi­ed a tree-vart on a branch a hund­red ells away, but ha­ve you ever tri­ed to see the in­ner, not the outer? Se­e­ing one's own self is the har­dest of all. Now, day co­mes and with it we shall camp. Pull asi­de tho­se branc­hes, so."</p>
   <p>    As she obe­yed, he sent the punt ne­atly in­to an in­den­ta­ti­on of the hum­mock to­ward which he had gu­ided them. But even on sho­re, and with fa­ti­gue we­ig­hing her down, Ka­di­ya was not to be de­ni­ed her ans­wers:</p>
   <p>    "You shall te­ach me wis­dom," she sta­ted, with a no­te of com­mand.</p>
   <p>    "Not I," he told her som­berly.</p>
   <p>    "That you will le­ave for the Arc­hi­ma­ge?" She ma­de a chal­len­ge of it.</p>
   <p>    "Nor she. Un­ders­tand: only ex­pe­ri­en­ce te­ac­hes wis­dom. Each of us must le­arn it in our own way and in our own ti­me."</p>
   <p>    Before she co­uld think of an ans­wer to ma­ke he lo­oked abo­ut him. "This is go­od so­lid earth." He stam­ped on the so­il with one fo­ot. "We can camp sa­fely he­re un­til dark. We shall even be ab­le to bu­ild a fi­re. A pel­rik bro­iled, or a ka­ru­wok -will that not be bet­ter than adop ro­ots?"</p>
   <p>    "We will tra­vel by night?" Now Ka­di­ya wis­hed mostly for a nest of rib­bon grass -and the­re was in­de­ed so­me gro­wing in sight -in which she co­uld curl up and sle­ep.</p>
   <p>    "That will be sa­fest un­til we pass the Up­per Mu­tar Ri­ver. Per­haps - if Volt­rik is cle­ver eno­ugh - he will ap­pro­ach the Nysso­mu as a fri­end, or un­der the mask of one. Most of us Folk know very lit­tle con­cer­ning tho­se of yo­ur blo­od, Far­se­er. To so­me of us you hu­mans se­em to be all of one kin, and sin­ce we ha­ve long trus­ted you Ru­wen­di­ans it may be that smo­oth words from the La­bor­no­ki will ke­ep us from the truth un­til too la­te."</p>
   <p>    "We can warn yo­ur pe­op­le." Ka­di­ya hal­ted in her ener­ge­tic pul­ling of the grass. "Per­haps ot­her de­fe­ated Ru­wen­di­ans will es­ca­pe by ri­ver- su­rely the Nysso­mu at Tre­vis­ta wo­uld help such who flee."</p>
   <p>    Jagun had ta­ken out his po­uch of ne­ed­le-sharp blow-gun darts and was ins­pec­ting each with ca­re.</p>
   <p>    "Farseer, we da­re not be se­en by any along the Mu­tar. We ha­ve but a short ti­me be­fo­re the Win­ter Ra­ins, when no one can tra­vel."</p>
   <p>    Now he lo­oked up and his gol­den eyes we­re web­bed with dark ve­ins ra­ised by fa­ti­gue. Be­ads of slimy swe­at had wor­ked thro­ugh the in­sect-re­pel­lent pas­te on his fa­ce and hands. "You must re­ach Noth. It li­es in the very fo­ot­hil­ls of the Oho­gan Mo­un­ta­ins mo­re than a hund­red le­agu­es to the north. On­ce we cross the Skri­tek co­untry, we en­ter the Gol­den­mi­re wil­der­ness. We will then ne­ed the help of the Uis­gu."</p>
   <p>    Jagun smo­ot­hed a small spa­ce of gro­und with the si­de of his hand and then be­gan to draw upon it.</p>
   <p>    "This," he ma­de an in­den­ta­ti­on with one na­il, "is whe­re we are now. He­re" - he drew with na­il tip north­ward - "li­es Noth, whe­re we must go-"</p>
   <p>    She had he­ard ta­les of Noth. Thro­ug­ho­ut the swamp the­re we­re many ru­ins on sturdy outc­rops of earth such as the small one they now sha­red. So­me of tho­se rem­nants of an ear­li­er ti­me had not be­en so ill-tre­ated by age as crumb­ling Tre­vis­ta, but we­re sa­id to be as so­und as the Ci­ta­del. Gre­at tre­asu­re was ru­mo­red to be hid­den in so­me ru­ined ci­ti­es. Now and then the­re ap­pe­ared at the mar­ket in Tre­vis­ta pe­cu­li­ar trin­kets and myste­ri­o­us ar­ti­facts which the vi­si­ting merc­hants eagerly bar­ga­ined for. Many we­re bro­ught in by the shy Uis­gu clans who al­lo­wed the­ir bol­der kin, the Nysso­mu, to sell on the­ir be­half. Ka­di­ya had he­ard of hu­man ad­ven­tu­rers who had ven­tu­red north and west se­eking for­got­ten is­lands and what tre­asu­re they might hold. Men ne­ar cra­zed by hards­hips had re­tur­ned to the Ci­ta­del, and one had bab­bled of a city gre­ater than ru­ined Tre­vis­ta stan­ding loc­ked and si­lent, its walls un­man­ned and no way to be fo­und wit­hin. And that was Noth, or so he had sa­id.</p>
   <p>    There might be only wra­iths to gu­ard that lost city, but all Ru­wen­da knew that Noth was the hold of the Arc­hi­ma­ge. So­me sa­id that she was of an el­der ra­ce, out of a past when city-crow­ned is­lands dot­ted a gre­at la­ke. By the his­tory of Ka­di­ya's own pe­op­le, the Arc­hi­ma­ge had al­ways be­en. If not the sa­me wo­man al­ways, then one who was twin, and twin, and twin…</p>
   <p>    Jagun di­sap­pe­ared and was back be­fo­re she had fi­nis­hed a se­cond nest of grass for his bed pla­ce. He swung a pel­rik by its bro­ad flat ta­il and Ka­di­ya pro­ved her worth as a tra­ve­ler in hun­ting out dry twigs and bro­ken branc­hes to bu­ild a ne­at pi­le of sticks re­ady for a spark from Jagun's fi­res­hell. He skin­ned and cle­aned his catch and qu­ar­te­red it with his hun­ter's long kni­fe, spit­ting the raw me­at on sticks ne­ar eno­ugh to the fi­re to ro­ast.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya fo­und her­self nod­ding, even tho­ugh the smell of the co­oking me­at set her mo­uth wa­te­ring. She co­uld not re­mem­ber when she had be­en so ti­red - not re­ali­zing that the hor­rors just be­hind her had had the­ir part in dra­ining her strength.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Princess Ani­gel did not re­co­ver her wits un­til her cap­tors had at­ta­ined the bre­wery. The­re the La­bor­no­ki knights res­ted, sin­ce they we­re worn out from the long climb out of the Ci­ta­del's lo­wer le­vels, which had fol­lo­wed upon a day's bat­tle. Sir Ri­nu­tar pro­po­sed to Prin­ce An­tar that they catch the­ir bre­ath and samp­le the Ru­wen­di­an li­qu­or, bar­rels of which sto­od abo­ut on every hand.</p>
   <p>    "Well spo­ken, Rin," sa­id Sir Owa­non, "for this Od­dling cro­ne is a go­od de­al he­avi­er than she lo­oks, and my back is nigh bro­ken." He drop­ped Im­mu on­to a he­ap of gra­in sacks. She gro­aned but kept her gre­at eyes tightly clo­sed.</p>
   <p>    Prince An­tar ca­uti­oned them. "A bri­ef ref­resh­ment only, then. King Volt­rik and the sor­ce­rer will be an­ge­red if we de­lay long in brin­ging the­se pri­so­ners for qu­es­ti­oning. If a one of you drinks to ex­cess, I shall see that the drun­ken ras­cal is se­ve­rely pu­nis­hed."</p>
   <p>    He set the Prin­cess Ani­gel down with gre­at gent­le­ness, and smo­ot­hed her ha­ir be­fo­re jo­ining his com­pa­ni­ons at a freshly bro­ac­hed bar­rel. Be­er flo­wed mer­rily from the bung­ho­le in­to wa­iting can­ni­kins and then po­ured on­to the flo­or.</p>
   <p>    "The cra­vens of Ru­wen­da brew a fa­irish batch of suds," sa­id Sir Ri­nu­tar, wi­ping his mus­tac­hes af­ter ta­king a long pull. "In fact, it's bet­ter than ours by a long sight." He drank aga­in, dra­ining the mug, and went for a re­fill be­fo­re that bar­rel emp­ti­ed.</p>
   <p>    "Small won­der," whis­pe­red Im­mu, "for ours is aged and eight per­cent, whi­le the La­bor­no­ki brew is na­ught but in­fant's pid­dle."</p>
   <p>    "This is in­de­ed ex­cel­lent stuff," sa­id anot­her knight, Sir Pe­na­pat. Why can we not ob­ta­in such back ho­me in De­ror­gu­ila?"</p>
   <p>    "The bre­wers in De­ror­gu­ila Town are ever comp­la­ining abo­ut the an­tics of be­er-witc­hes," sa­id Sir Owa­non, "bla­ming such­li­ke evil da­mes for so­uring the brew or ot­her­wi­se ma­king it so of­ten stran­ge to tas­te. I he­ard they burnt a be­er-witch at the sta­ke just be­fo­re the army marc­hed. She was ta­ken as she lur­ked abo­ut the ket­tle­ho­use, whe­re she was cle­arly up to misc­hi­ef. Wo­men know not­hing of bre­wing."</p>
   <p>    "Lothok dung!" snap­ped Im­mu. Her vo­ice was muf­fled, for they had thrown her on her sto­mach, but this ti­me her cap­tors he­ard.</p>
   <p>    "Well, flay me ali­ve and na­il my hi­de to the wall," Sir Owa­non la­ug­hed. "My la­te bur­den spe­aks! And sa­ucily, too."</p>
   <p>    "Give her a go­od kick," Ri­nu­tar sug­ges­ted.</p>
   <p>    Princess Ani­gel strug­gled up, with her hands ti­ed be­hind her as Im­mu's we­re, and cri­ed: "Hold off, you ruf­fi­an, and for sha­me! For if you think our be­er is go­od, you ha­ve Im­mu to thank for it, sin­ce she is the brew-mist­ress of this Ci­ta­del."</p>
   <p>    "She li­es," grow­led Sir Ri­nu­tar. "What scrawny Od­dling hag co­uld un­ders­tand such myste­ri­es?" He ges­tu­red at the gre­at cop­per co­okers, the ma­ze of tu­bing, the comp­lex system of tro­ughs that de­li­ve­red mal­ted gra­in to the mash tun and then trans­fer­red the cla­ri­fi­ed wort to the hu­ge brew-ket­tle. The­re we­re cat­walks abo­ut the rims of the­se ves­sels, whe­re the wor­kers co­uld stir and stra­in and ot­her­wi­se ins­pect the li­qu­ors.</p>
   <p>    "I un­ders­tand bre­wing very well." Im­mu, li­ke the Prin­cess, had tur­ned over. Her vo­ice was co­ol and con­fi­dent. "And only a jel­ly-bra­in wo­uld bla­me so­ured be­er on ima­gi­nary be­er-witc­hes. Such hap­pens most ti­mes be­ca­use the ket­tles and fer­men­ting ves­sels and tu­bing are not sco­ured out pro­perly, and fe­tid growths form the­re­in and ta­int the li­qu­or."</p>
   <p>    "Say you true?" Prin­ce An­tar was in­te­res­ted. "Per­haps we sho­uld let you li­ve, and see if you co­uld te­ach our La­bor­no­ki bre­wers to co­me up with bet­ter drink."</p>
   <p>    "A go­od idea," Sir Owa­non sa­id, but ot­hers sho­uted him down, and they be­gan then to qu­ar­rel, stri­king the bungs from ot­her bar­rels and re­fil­ling the­ir can­ni­kins as they emp­ti­ed.</p>
   <p>    Then they we­re di­ver­ted, for clat­te­ring down the steps ca­me Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil, le­ading anot­her for­ce of knights. They we­re al­so fa­ti­gu­ed to the bo­ne, and gre­eted the­ir com­ra­des' dis­co­very with gre­at ent­hu­si­asm.</p>
   <p>    Hamil ca­me to An­tar, who only sip­ped at his brew, and cong­ra­tu­la­ted him upon his cap­tu­re of Prin­cess Ani­gel. Then the Ge­ne­ral to­ok his Lord asi­de and spo­ke in a low vo­ice, but Ani­gel and Im­mu he­ard it cle­arly.</p>
   <p>    "There has be­en a di­re and por­ten­to­us hap­pe­ning, my Prin­ce. Mi­lo­tis and his men we­re se­arc­hing the up­per re­ac­hes of the High To­wer when they chan­ced upon Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis and an Od­dling com­pa­ni­on. They pur­su­ed them to the pa­ra­pet, whe­re­upon Ha­ra­mis sto­od upon the very brink of the bat­tle­ment, held tight to an amu­let aro­und her neck, and cal­led upon the Lords of the Air."</p>
   <p>    "So wo­uld I ha­ve al­so," the Prin­ce sa­id wryly, "in her po­si­ti­on."</p>
   <p>    "But two monst­ro­us lam­mer­ge­i­ers ca­me," Ha­mil sa­id, "and bo­re the two away on the­ir backs!"</p>
   <p>    The Prin­ce ut­te­red an oath. "Mi­lo­tis saw this pro­digy with his own eyes?"</p>
   <p>    "He did. I com­mu­ni­ca­ted the news to the mighty Oro­gas­tus, who was stric­ken with fury. Mi­lo­tis and all his men we­re put to de­ath by or­der of the King."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­ce mut­te­red, "Mad­ness. Mi­lo­tis was a worthy cap­ta­in, and how co­uld he be ex­pec­ted to co­un­ter ma­gic? That is Oro­gas­tus's bu­si­ness. And I won­der if he will de­mand my own sla­ugh­ter, sin­ce I sna­red but one Prin­cess, whi­le the ot­her got away." He desc­ri­bed Ka­di­ya's es­ca­pe thro­ugh the cis­tern, and Ani­gel's sta­te­ment that her sis­ter now was in pos­ses­si­on of gre­at ma­gic.</p>
   <p>    General Ha­mil ca­me to stand over the two cap­ti­ve wo­men, a ter­rib­le fi­gu­re in blo­od-red ar­mor or­na­men­ted with gold. On his red-ena­me­led hel­met we­re mo­un­ted gol­den ant­lers, and the vi­sor was ma­de in the form of a vo­lum­ni­al's skull.</p>
   <p>    "Princess Ani­gel," he de­man­ded, "is it true that yo­ur sis­ters ha­ve ma­gic?"</p>
   <p>    But the ter­ri­fi­ed girl only burst in­to te­ars, and thras­hed abo­ut pi­te­o­usly whi­le Im­mu sa­id: "Now lo­ok what you've do­ne, you gre­at lum­mox! By the Flo­wer, I know not why the lam­mer­ge­i­ers ca­me, but you can be su­re no ma­gic was in­vol­ved. Are the three Prin­ces­ses not trip­lets? Wo­uld not all three pos­sess ma­gic if two of them did? Yet he­re li­es po­or Ani­gel in yo­ur po­wer." She be­gan to spe­ak softly to the girl, but in an ur­gent man­ner.</p>
   <p>    "The Od­dling granny ma­kes go­od sen­se,' sa­id the Prin­ce, frow­ning. "But we had bet­ter le­ave all this to Oro­gas­tus." He lif­ted his vo­ice. "Com­pa­ni­ons, we must qu­it this pla­ce now and re­turn to the thro­ne ro­om with our cap­ti­ves."</p>
   <p>    Immu left off whis­pe­ring to the dist­ra­ught Prin­cess and ad­dres­sed Prin­ce An­tar in whe­ed­ling to­nes. "My Lord, ha­ve pity on this do­omed ma­iden. Be­fo­re you carry on, un­tie her bri­efly and per­mit her to re­li­eve her­self be­hind yon pi­le of sacks, lest she hu­mi­li­ate her­self and so­il you."</p>
   <p>    Anigel hung her he­ad in sha­me, and Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil chort­led and ma­de a cru­de re­mark. But the Prin­ce knelt and un­did Ani­gel's bonds. She than­ked him with a wo­eful co­un­te­nan­ce and beg­ged that he al­so re­le­ase her ser­ving-wo­man, to help with her gar­ments.</p>
   <p>    "That I will, but the two of you be qu­ick," sa­id An­tar. He ma­de cer­ta­in that the­re was no exit from the cor­ner be­hind the sacks, then let the wo­men go.</p>
   <p>    "There is anot­her mat­ter I wo­uld men­ti­on," Ha­mil sa­id. "The King's hand is much inf­la­med af­ter his be­ing bit­ten by the ro­gue squ­ire. He is in a fo­ul tem­per from the pa­in, and both the ro­yal physi­ci­an and the sor­ce­rer's Gre­en Vo­ice say that he must ta­ke to bed with a strong herb po­ul­ti­ce over it, and drink hot in­fu­si­ons and rest, lest the wo­und fes­ter and blo­od po­iso­ning set in."</p>
   <p>    "The wi­zard him­self can do not­hing?"</p>
   <p>    "Evidently not, alt­ho­ugh he did pro­no­un­ce an in­can­ta­ti­on over the po­ul­ti­ce-pot. He con­curs with the di­ag­no­sis of his mi­ni­on and the le­ech that the King must rest, and so the se­arch for the two elo­ped Prin­ces­ses will fall upon us."</p>
   <p>    "The men are ex­ha­us­ted. They must ha­ve se­ve­ral days to re­co­ver be­fo­re an in­ten­si­ve se­arch can be mo­un­ted. The ti­me can be used to se­ek out in­for­ma­ti­on - es­pe­ci­al­ly from the Od­dlings. The abo­ri­gi­nes of the swamp wo­uld know whe­re the Prin­ces­ses ha­ve go­ne if any do."</p>
   <p>    Hamil nod­ded. "All Od­dlings ha­ve fled the Ci­ta­del, but we can go to Tre­vis­ta, that ru­ined an­ci­ent city whe­re they ha­ve the­ir fa­ir. The turn­co­at ri­ver­man Pel­lan, who com­mands a fle­et of flat­bo­ats car­rying merc­hants to Tre­vis­ta, will co­ope­ra­te fully. And the­re are tho­se among the Mas­ter-Merc­hants of La­bor­nok who may ad­vi­se us what pres­su­res to put upon the lit­tle bog-trot­ters to ga­in the­ir help."</p>
   <p>    "I will spe­ak to my Ro­yal Fat­her, and see that all is put in or­der. Per­haps you and I and this Pel­lan can go at day­light to Tre­vis­ta with a small for­ce, whi­le the rest of the army bri­efly ta­kes its ease. We our­sel­ves can nap on the ri­ver."</p>
   <p>    "A splen­did sug­ges­ti­on, my Prin­ce."</p>
   <p>    Antar now frow­ned and cast an eye abo­ut. "The wo­men - whe­re are they?"</p>
   <p>    Hamil stro­de at on­ce to pe­er be­hind the pi­led sacks. "Go­ne! By the Sac­red Bo­wels of Zo­to, they are go­ne! But whe­re?"</p>
   <p>    He be­gan sho­uting or­ders to the ot­hers, and the knights ra­ced abo­ut, se­arc­hing every cranny of the gre­at bre­wery, even tho­ugh the­re se­emed no way that Im­mu and Ani­gel co­uld ha­ve pas­sed Prin­ce An­tar and Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil.</p>
   <p>    Then, when they we­re ma­king such a din that no man co­uld he­ar the ot­her, Prin­ce An­tar saw the clod­dish knight Ri­nu­tar go stom­ping ac­ross one of the cat­walks that circ­led a gre­at wo­oden fer­men­ta­ti­on vat. Sud­denly Ri­nu­tar be­gan to stag­ger abo­ut and push at the air, and howl words that no one co­uld un­ders­tand, and he over­ba­lan­ced and fell in­to the fo­am-top­ped, strong-smel­ling li­qu­or with a gre­at splash.</p>
   <p>    Every man fell si­lent from as­to­nish­ment, and then they be­gan ro­aring with la­ugh­ter. So­me went to fish the splut­te­ring Ri­nu­tar out. His fa­ce was as black with fury as his ar­mor was whi­te with suds, and when they had ha­uled him up he scre­amed:</p>
   <p>    "Who pus­hed me?"</p>
   <p>    "Drunken nums­kull," the Prin­ce sa­id, dis­gus­ted. "No one pus­hed you. You simply lost yo­ur fo­oting."</p>
   <p>    "Nay," Ri­nu­tar cont­ra­dic­ted sto­utly. "I was pus­hed -and mo­re than that, I he­ard a vo­ice say: 'Ta­ke a go­od long drink' as I fell."</p>
   <p>    Many knights gre­eted this pro­tes­ta­ti­on with skep­ti­cal guf­faws, but Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil's brow dar­ke­ned. He bel­lo­wed: "Si­len­ce, ever­yo­ne!"</p>
   <p>    Every mo­uth clam­ped shut. In the sud­den stil­lness that fol­lo­wed one co­uld he­ar drip­ping be­er, and men bre­at­hing he­avily from exer­ti­on… and the qu­ick pat­ter of fo­ots­teps on the cat­walk, and then on the open sta­ir­way le­ading down to the tap­ping ro­om whe­re the bar­rels we­re fil­led.</p>
   <p>    "Magic!" Ha­mil how­led. "Ma­gic at work! They ha­ve go­ne in­vi­sib­le! Down to the lo­wer le­vel, all! And go softly, damn you, and lis­ten!"</p>
   <p>    Anigel, clutc­hing her amu­let, whis­pe­red an­xi­o­usly to Im­mu. "We will be fo­und. We are le­aving wet fo­otp­rints!"</p>
   <p>    "This way," his­sed her in­vi­sib­le com­pa­ni­on. "To the dumb-wa­iter that ho­ists the bar­rels to the kitc­hen le­vel."</p>
   <p>    They ran to the lift, which was co­un­ter­we­igh­ted and wo­uld carry them up with the simp­le re­le­ase of a le­ver. Ani­gel clim­bed on, but Im­mu sa­id: "Wa­it one mi­nu­te, Prin­cess." Her wet fo­otp­rints tur­ned back and ap­pro­ac­hed a gre­at stack of empty kegs wa­iting in ser­ri­ed ranks to be fil­led.</p>
   <p>    As the knights led by the La­bor­no­ki Ge­ne­ral das­hed down the sta­ir­way, the pi­le of bar­rels be­gan to te­eter at the end ne­arest the dumb­wa­iter. One bar­rel nud­ged anot­her, and be­fo­re the knights knew what was hap­pe­ning the who­le stack col­lap­sed with a rumb­ling crash. Lar­ge kegs and small rol­led abo­ut, trip­ping up the men and shat­te­ring as the knights stam­ped fu­ti­lely upon them with ma­iled fe­et. But the way to the dumb-wa­iter was bloc­ked comp­le­tely.</p>
   <p>    Princess Ani­gel let lo­ose of her amu­let for a mo­ment from la­ug­hing, and so the La­bor­no­ki saw the two fu­gi­ti­ves cle­arly as they as­cen­ded out of sight.</p>
   <p>    "I pra­yed yo­ur idea wo­uld work," Ani­gel sa­id, "but I was still so­re af­ra­id."</p>
   <p>    Immu smi­led in the dim­ness of the Ci­ta­del Ga­te­ho­use, whe­re they had pa­used to rest, hid­den in a de­ser­ted sentry ki­osk. "But you did not do­ubt and that was the im­por­tant thing. He­aring that yo­ur sis­ter Ha­ra­mis al­so es­ca­ped with the aid of her amu­let, you had con­fi­den­ce at last that yo­urs wo­uld res­pond to yo­ur com­mand, and ren­der us in­vi­sib­le. And it did. So now all we ha­ve to do is walk away!"</p>
   <p>    Anigel sag­ged back aga­inst the flimsy wall. "Go­od fri­end, ha­ve mercy and let me stay he­re a lit­tle, for if we con­ti­nue on now, I will su­rely col­lap­se."</p>
   <p>    "Lie easy, swe­eting." Im­mu to­ok off her shawl and tuc­ked it aro­und the girl's sho­ul­ders. "We are sa­fe for a whi­le. The­re is no hue and cry out he­re."</p>
   <p>    The La­bor­no­ki be­li­eved that the Prin­cess and Im­mu we­re still in­si­de the cent­ral ke­ep, and so Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil had bar­red all its do­ors. But Im­mu had known of a sec­ret exit from the kitc­hens, whe­re lazy scul­li­ons had be­en wont to slip away from the­ir du­ti­es. This led to the ward out­si­de the ke­ep, and the two wo­men had cros­sed it swiftly, in­vi­sib­le, dod­ging knots of La­bor­no­ki sol­di­ers do­zing aro­und the­ir watch­fi­res.</p>
   <p>    Although Ani­gel was ex­ha­us­ted, she felt that she da­re not clo­se her eyes, fe­aring that sle­ep wo­uld can­cel the be­ne­fi­cent ma­gic that had bro­ught them sa­fely to the sentry ki­osk.</p>
   <p>    "I still can scar­ce be­li­eve that we truly be­ca­me in­vi­sib­le," she whis­pe­red. "The ta­lis­man wo­uld not sa­ve me at the rim of the cis­tern… why did it act la­ter?"</p>
   <p>    "At the cis­tern, you we­re wit­ho­ut ho­pe and mad with fe­ar. In the bre­wery, mo­re use­ful emo­ti­ons inc­li­ned you to fol­low my co­un­sel."</p>
   <p>    "It's true that I was angry the­re," the Prin­cess sa­id slowly. "I des­pi­sed myself for the co­war­di­ce that had ca­used us both to be cap­tu­red. And I was mor­ti­fi­ed by the un­dig­ni­fi­ed stra­ta­gem that you used to ma­ke the vil­la­ins lo­ose our bonds - "</p>
   <p>    Immu chuck­led. "Yo­ur an­ger cla­ri­fi­ed yo­ur mind, ba­nis­hing the fe­ar that pa­raly­zed yo­ur will. You fi­nal­ly be­li­eved me when I ba­de you call upon yo­ur amu­let's ma­gic. An­ger is a much mo­re use­ful emo­ti­on than fe­ar. You must le­arn to ma­ke mo­re use of it, swe­eting. In the sta­te you now find yo­ur­self, me­ek­ness and da­inty man­ners will do you lit­tle go­od."</p>
   <p>    "And ma­gic will?" Ani­gel spo­ke we­arily.</p>
   <p>    "That re­ma­ins to be se­en."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess was lost in tho­ught for se­ve­ral mi­nu­tes, then as­ked: "Do… do yo­ur pe­op­le ma­ke com­mon use of ma­gic, then?"</p>
   <p>    "Oh, no. It is a spe­ci­al thing, not to be in­vo­ked lightly. So­me­ti­mes it is the­re and so­me­ti­mes not, no mat­ter how des­pe­ra­tely one wis­hes for its help. For yo­ur po­or Mot­her and Fat­her, the­re was no ma­gi­cal as­sis­tan­ce - "</p>
   <p>    "And that was cru­el! It ma­kes no go­od sen­se that the King and Qu­e­en of Ru­wen­da pe­rish and the co­untry be con­qu­ered whi­le ma­gic shi­elds me and my sis­ters!"</p>
   <p>    "Peace, child, pe­ace. Ma­gic is a mystery, li­ke so much of li­fe. It can be wi­el­ded for go­od or evil, and we do not al­ways know which is which, any mo­re than we re­al­ly un­ders­tand what ma­gic is."</p>
   <p>    Anigel sig­hed. "Per­haps the Arc­hi­ma­ge will tell us."</p>
   <p>    She hud­dled down clo­se to her old nur­se and fi­nal­ly her eyes clo­sed; but the Prin­cess still held tightly to the tril­li­um am­ber even when she was so­und as­le­ep.</p>
   <p>    They had not res­ted mo­re than two ho­urs when they he­ard bug­le-horns so­un­ding, and the sol­di­ers sle­eping abo­ut the Ga­te­ho­use be­gan to awa­ke snar­ling and grow­ling. It was ne­arly dawn. The men we­re in an evil mo­od be­ca­use lo­oting of the Ci­ta­del had be­en for­bid­den. They bu­ilt up the­ir fi­res aga­inst the chill, pre­pa­red scanty bre­ak­fasts from fi­eld ra­ti­ons, and re­li­eved them­sel­ves most of­fen­si­vely in any pla­ce at all.</p>
   <p>    "Don't lo­ok out­si­de, Prin­cess," Im­mu sa­id. "The cul­tu­re­less bump­kins!"</p>
   <p>    "Oh, Im­mu, I don't ca­re abo­ut that. What wor­ri­es me is what we are to do next. How will we ever get to the ho­me of:he Arc­hi­ma­ge?"</p>
   <p>    "Jagun had our es­ca­pe all plan­ned, and his brot­her bro­ught a bo­at. But do­ubt­less Jagun and Ka­di­ya ha­ve em­bar­ked in the punt long ago, gi­ving us up for lost." Im­mu's brow fur­ro­wed in tho­ught. "We shall ha­ve to find anot­her way to get up the Mu­tar. If we can re­ach Tre­vis­ta, my Folk will help us con­tact the Uis­gu, in who­se lands the ru­ins of Noth lie."</p>
   <p>    "But Tre­vis­ta is so far away, with the Black­mi­re lying bet­we­en it and the Ci­ta­del!"</p>
   <p>    Outside the­re was a flo­urish of trum­pets. Im­mu pe­ered thro­ugh a crack in the do­or to see what was hap­pe­ning. A knight-com­man­der and his es­cort ca­me can­te­ring in­to the fo­re­co­urt of the in­ner ward, and pul­led up not a do­zen ells from the gu­ard ki­osk. The­re a ser­ge­ant-qu­ar­ter­mas­ter was su­per­vi­sing the dist­ri­bu­ti­on of sup­pli­es from a tra­in of co­ve­red wa­gons. The knight sa­id: "The com­pany will mo­ve out in one ho­ur. We shall march ac­ross the Knoll to Ru­wen­da Mar­ket on the wes­tern si­de, and the­re bo­ard flat­bo­ats for Tre­vis­ta. Be su­re to bring ade­qu­ate fo­od and ma­te­ri­el, and fod­der for the be­asts."</p>
   <p>    The ser­ge­ant sa­lu­ted and the knight whe­eled his war-fro­ni­al abo­ut and clat­te­red away with his es­cort thro­ugh the Ga­te­ho­use and in­to the outer ward.</p>
   <p>    Immu la­ug­hed softly. "Our prob­lem is sol­ved. The fo­emen them­sel­ves will carry us to Tre­vis­ta, all una­wa­res! Are you hungry, my child?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes, Im­mu. And very ti­red."</p>
   <p>    "You can­not ren­der us in­vi­sib­le whi­le you sle­ep, but I think we will be ab­le to find a su­itab­le pla­ce of con­ce­al­ment af­ter we ha­ve had our bre­ak­fast." She exp­la­ined her plan, and the eyes of Prin­cess Ani­gel be­gan to dan­ce, and she hug­ged the Od­dling wo­man. Then Ani­gel clas­ped her amu­let and ma­de them di­sap­pe­ar, and they star­ted off to find a su­itab­le wa­gon.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    High over the fog­bo­und Mazy Mi­re the lam­mer­ge­i­ers flew, car­rying Ha­ra­mis and Uzun to­ward the ru­ins of Moth.</p>
   <p>    When her thud­ding he­art slo­wed, and her sen­ses told her that what she ex­pe­ri­en­ced was in­de­ed re­al and not so­me fan­tas­tic dre­am, Ha­ra­mis to­ok stock of her si­tu­ati­on. She was un­har­med, and the ap­pe­aran­ce of the po­wer­ful cre­atu­re had sa­ved her from al­most cer­ta­in de­ath. Was this the ma­gic of the Arc­hi­ma­ge? Did the Whi­te Lady re­ta­in so­me po­wer, even tho­ugh her ma­gic had not be­en suf­fi­ci­ent to stand aga­inst Oro­gas­tus and pre­vent the in­va­si­on of Ru­wen­da?</p>
   <p>    The lam­mer­ge­i­er's enor­mo­us wings be­at strongly and re­gu­larly, ma­king a fa­int thrum­ming so­und as they stro­ked the air. Its whi­te-plu­med back was as wi­de and as soft as a bed qu­il­ted in down. Ha­ra­mis sank so de­eply in­to the hol­low be­hind the bird's gre­at black-stre­aked neck that it was hardly ne­ces­sary to cling tightly to the plu­ma­ge. When they had be­en aloft for ne­arly an ho­ur, the lam­mer­ge­i­er's cres­ted he­ad tur­ned to re­gard its stran­ge bur­den, but the dark eyes we­re mild and the to­ot­hed be­ak of­fe­red no thre­at.</p>
   <p>    Not kno­wing whet­her it un­ders­to­od, she sa­id to it: "My thanks for res­cu­ing me and my com­pa­ni­on."</p>
   <p>    There might ha­ve be­en a mi­nis­cu­le nod, or per­haps not. The cre­atu­re lo­oked upon her no mo­re, but flew ste­adily on­ward. Ha­ra­mis wa­ved to Uzun, but they co­uld not con­ver­se, sin­ce the two lam­mer­ge­i­ers we­re too far apart.</p>
   <p>    The world be­low was a pa­le clo­ud deck and in the cle­ar night sky abo­ve, fa­mi­li­ar cons­tel­la­ti­ons glit­te­red: the Drawn Bow, the Ket­tle, the La­du Tree, the Gre­at Worm, the Nort­hern Crown.</p>
   <p>    Crown…</p>
   <p>    She still had, knot­ted and slung over one sho­ul­der, the bund­led black clo­ak with her Mot­her's blo­od on the folds. She di­ves­ted her­self of it, unk­not­ted the fab­ric, and ga­zed upon the Qu­e­en's Crown of Sta­te with its fi­ni­al of tril­li­um am­ber un­til gri­ef blur­red her vi­si­on. <emphasis>At le­ast Volt­rik do­es not ha­ve you</emphasis>, she tho­ught grimly, <emphasis>nor shall he whi­le I li­ve! He kil­led my pa­rents, but I will li­ve, and Ru­wen­da will be mi­ne</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    She fo­ught back te­ars, af­ra­id that if she star­ted crying she wo­uld not be ab­le to stop. <emphasis>I am Qu­e­en of Ru­wen­da now, and it is my duty to sa­fe­gu­ard the co­untry and it?s pe­op­le, and to marry and ra­ise my child­ren to con­ti­nue the task when I am go­ne</emphasis>. Her thro­at was tight, and it was dif­fi­cult for her to bre­at­he, but she was de­ter­mi­ned. She was al­so, ho­we­ver, af­ra­id. <emphasis>I al­ways knew that I wo­uld be Qu­e­en one day-but I ne­ver ex­pec­ted it to be so so­on</emphasis>… <emphasis>or un­der this cir­cums­tan­ces! I ho­pe the Whi­te Lady can help me; I cer­ta­inly am go­ing to ne­ed help from so­mew­he­re</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    Was the­re truly ma­gic in the stran­ge fos­si­li­zed blos­soms en­ca­sed in the Crown and her amu­let, or had it only be­en go­od luck that had bro­ught the Arc­hi­ma­ge's lam­mer­ge­i­ers to the res­cue in the nick of ti­me?</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>I shall ex­pe­ri­ment</emphasis>, she tho­ught. And she to­ok hold of the amu­let on its neck-cha­in, clo­sed her eyes, and sa­id, "Trans­port me ins­tantly to the dwel­ling of the Whi­te Lady!"</p>
   <p>    But not­hing hap­pe­ned, and the lam­mer­ge­i­er flew on se­re­nely.</p>
   <p>    She tri­ed a simp­ler re­qu­est: "Bring me a sa­vory pasty, for I am dying of hun­ger."</p>
   <p>    Again the­re was not­hing, and her sto­mach cont­rac­ted pa­in­ful­ly.</p>
   <p>    So much for ma­gic. Ah, well. What did it mat­ter?</p>
   <p>    A pro­fo­und dep­res­si­on en­ve­lo­ped her. The­re was no king­dom for her to ru­le and no ro­yal spo­use to sit at her si­de. Ha­ra­mis tri­ed to be glad, to se­ek the com­pen­sa­ti­ons of her pre­sent pre­di­ca­ment. She had al­ways ha­ted the pomp and ce­re­mony of co­urt li­fe, the end­less me­etings with mi­nis­ters that her Fat­her had pa­ti­ently en­du­red, the te­di­o­us ban­qu­ets and en­ter­ta­in­ments her Mot­her had su­per­vi­sed, al­ways sur­ro­un­ded by her twit­te­ring la­di­es. The­re had be­en a de­eper si­de to Qu­e­en Ka­lant­he as well, for she had writ­ten po­etry and ta­ken a ke­en in­te­rest in the af­fa­irs of the less for­tu­na­te in Ru­wen­da, al­ways se­eking to imp­ro­ve the­ir lot wit­ho­ut stif­ling the­ir ini­ti­ati­ve. But qu­e­ens­hip was a job that Ha­ra­mis had dre­aded. Du­ti­ful, she had ac­cep­ted it as her na­tu­ral lot. But now her ob­li­ga­ti­on had be­en, at the very le­ast, al­te­red so­mew­hat…</p>
   <p>    She snug­gled down in­to the cus­hi­ony hol­low, let­ting the wind sing abo­ve her, and awa­ited sle­ep's re­le­ase. The bund­led Crown she ti­ed to her jewe­led gird­le so that it might not be lost. The Arc­hi­ma­ge wo­uld know what to do with it.</p>
   <p>    And what to do with her.</p>
   <p>    Who was this wo­man, re­al­ly? That she was re­al and not a le­gend, Ha­ra­mis no lon­ger do­ub­ted. The fa­bu­lo­us events at her birth must al­so now be co­un­ted as re­al, and the omi­no­us spe­ech of the Arc­hi­ma­ge as well. If this Whi­te Lady was truly nigh un­to de­ath, how wo­uld she be ab­le to gi­ve aid and ad­vi­ce? And why had she sa­id so long ago that <emphasis>all wo­uld be well</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    These tho­ughts circ­led diz­zily in her mind, and she mul­led over a sco­re of ways whe­reby Ru­wen­da might yet be sa­ved -and she ri­ding tri­ump­hant at the he­ad of a Ru­wen­di­an host, ha­ving her­self ef­fec­tu­ated the vic­tory. But the­se we­re not­hing but fo­olish fan­ta­si­es. She was se­ven­te­en, cle­ver and bo­ok-le­ar­ned be­yond a do­ubt, but hardly a war-le­ader. If this Arc­hi­ma­ge had cho­sen her as an inst­ru­ment of des­tiny, she must be se­ni­le in­de­ed…</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>I shall ha­ve to be on my gu­ard</emphasis>, Ha­ra­mis tho­ught. <emphasis>Who know?s what fo­ol­hardy sche­mes the old wo­man may ur­ge upon me? But I shall be wary, and form my own de­ci­si­ons. I am Qu­e­en now and the res­pon­si­bi­lity is mi­ne, no mat­ter who ad­vi­ses me. I must not me­ekly sub­mit to anot­her?s will</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    Trillium or no tril­li­um.</p>
   <p>    When she wo­ke it was dawn, and the two lam­mer­ge­i­ers still flew on. The Oho­gan ran­ge now thrust up to fill fully half of the sky, for­bid­ding fangs of gra­ni­te and ba­salt, en­ti­rely snowc­lad abo­ve the tree-li­ne. Rosy sun­light ga­ve the gla­ci­ers and ice­fi­elds a fal­se soft­ness. Ha­ra­mis lo­oked on them with a sin­king he­art. What if the Arc­hi­ma­ge told her that her des­tiny lay up the­re?</p>
   <p>    The mist was bur­ning off the marsh­land be­low as the sun grew stron­ger, and the land was chan­ging from jung­le in­to a vast un­du­la­ting sea of tall grass, yel­lo­wish in co­lor, un­li­ke any part of the Mazy Mi­re she had ever se­en be­fo­re. Only ra­re patc­hes of dry land bro­ke the mo­no­to­no­us wet pla­in. The­se slight ele­va­ti­ons had hard­wo­od tre­es, shrubs, and ot­her gre­en ve­ge­ta­ti­on upon them - and, she sup­po­sed, the sec­ret ha­bi­ta­ti­ons of the Uis­gu, tho­se di­mi­nu­ti­ve kin to the Nysso­mu who dwelt in the nort­hern re­ac­hes of the Mazy Mi­re.</p>
   <p>    There we­re abo­ri­gi­nes in the mo­un­ta­ins al­so, she knew, cal­led Vis­pi; but hu­mans had no con­tact with them. Furt­her east, whe­re the ran­ge was cleft by the Vis­pir Pass, the men who had sto­od gu­ard cla­imed that the elu­si­ve Vis­pi emer­ged on mo­on­lit nights to dan­ce on the new-fal­len snow. And the­re we­re hor­ror sto­ri­es of the mo­un­ta­in Od­dlings as well. They we­re cal­led the de­mons of the fro­zen mist, and the­ir eyes gla­red from the icy whirl­wind, and it was sa­id that tho­se who lo­oked upon them di­ed. Ne­vert­he­less, no one do­ub­ted that the Vis­pi we­re re­al folk and not su­per­na­tu­ral, for they tra­ded gems­to­nes and pre­ci­o­us me­tals to the Uis­gu. The­se even­tu­al­ly ma­de the­ir way to hu­man mar­kets via the Nysso­mu, and the Vis­pi de­man­ded in re­turn cer­ta­in fo­ods­tuf­fs, sturdy do­mes­tic ani­mals such as fro­ni­als and vo­lum­ni­als, wo­ven fab­rics, and a few ot­her tra­de items. But what the be­ings re­al­ly lo­oked li­ke, no hu­man be­ing co­uld tell - ex­cept per­haps tho­se luck­less an­ci­ent ar­mi­es of La­bor­nok who had da­red the Vis­pir Pass ages ago and (if the old sto­ri­es we­re to be be­li­eved) pe­ris­hed at the hands of the­se mi­ni­ons of the Gu­ar­di­an Whi­te Lady.</p>
   <p>    Sunlight ref­lec­ted mir­ror­li­ke from the Gol­den­mi­re po­ols and small ri­vers as the day ad­van­ced. Ha­ra­mis spi­ed now and then thin twis­ting wa­ter-tra­ils, which she pre­su­med we­re the tho­ro­ugh­fa­res of the Uis­gu. Then, af­ter mo­re ho­urs du­ring which they fol­lo­wed the co­ur­se of a so­mew­hat lar­ger ri­ver north­ward, the ter­ra­in ro­se and the Gol­den­mi­re ca­me to an end in fo­ot­hil­ls thinly fo­res­ted with stran­ge tre­es, in­ters­per­sed with flo­wer-dec­ked high­land bogs. The lam­mer­ge­i­ers be­gan to circ­le ro­und and ro­und, des­cen­ding.</p>
   <p>    There we­re ru­ins down the­re, be­si­de the ri­ver, all overg­rown with cre­epers and with tre­es perc­hed boldly on tumb­le­down walls and po­king up thro­ugh bro­ken cu­po­las. Un­li­ke her sis­ter Ka­di­ya, Ha­ra­mis had no wish to exp­lo­re such si­tes. Only the pe­cu­li­ar ar­ti­facts they con­ta­ined in­te­res­ted her. She had ow­ned a few - a small fe­atu­re­less box that pla­yed a dif­fe­rent et­he­re­al tu­ne when set on each of its se­ve­ral si­des, a wri­ting inst­ru­ment that se­emed ne­ver to run dry of ink, and a we­ird bra­ce­let of so­me unk­nown hard, whi­te subs­tan­ce that was not bo­ne, nor wo­od, nor any mi­ne­ral the sa­ges of Ru­wen­da knew. The Va­nis­hed Ones had cer­ta­inly had so­me po­wer, but the­ir sec­rets had be­en lost long ago. If, ho­we­ver, the Arc­hi­ma­ge did truly sha­re in the an­ci­ent wis­dom, then Ha­ra­mis might still ha­ve so­me fa­int chan­ce of ful­fil­ling her birth-prop­hecy.</p>
   <p>    She clutc­hed the amu­let auto­ma­ti­cal­ly, pra­ying: "But de­ar God and Lords of the Air, let me not be de­ce­ived! Abo­ve all, let me not be en­co­ura­ged to rash be­ha­vi­or, then fa­il. I co­uld not be­ar to fa­il!"</p>
   <p>    They we­re flo­ating slowly, in a long shal­low gli­de, ap­pro­ac­hing a small sto­ne struc­tu­re, to­wer­li­ke in sha­pe, that was al­most bu­ri­ed in thick gre­enery. The win­ged cre­atu­res to­uc­hed down softly on a kind of na­tu­ral lawn all dot­ted with bright wildf­lo­wers that spre­ad out be­fo­re a lo­we­red drawb­rid­ge. The­re we­re al­so wa­ter-blos­soms of vi­vid blue gro­wing in the mo­at, and a swe­et frag­ran­ce in the air.</p>
   <p>    Haramis slid from the lam­mer­ge­i­er's back and curt­se­yed low to it. "My fer­vent thanks to you, mas­ter of the sky, for ha­ving bro­ught me and my go­od ser­vant to this sa­fe ha­ven."</p>
   <p>    When she lif­ted her he­ad, the two lam­mer­ge­i­ers had al­re­ady ta­ken wing. They both ut­te­red cla­ri­on cri­es be­fo­re di­sap­pe­aring be­yond the tre­es.</p>
   <p>    Uzun sto­od be­si­de her. He was a sadly co­mi­cal sight, his be­ret lost, his long silky ha­ir all snar­led from the wind, and his on­ce dap­per ma­ro­on vel­vet smock sta­ined and rump­led. But his grin was in­do­mi­tab­le.</p>
   <p>    "Here we are," he chir­ped. "Let us en­ter, for our ar­ri­val has be­en an­no­un­ced by the lam­mer­ge­i­ers."</p>
   <p>    Slowly, they wal­ked ac­ross the me­adow to the drawb­rid­ge. The bu­il­ding was shro­uded in moss and girt abo­ut with tiny lacy ferns, each hewn sto­ne sof­te­ned in out­li­ne by flo­wers sprin­ging forth from the crumb­ling mor­tar. Plants grew on the brid­ge plan­king as well. The Prin­cess step­ped gin­gerly for fe­ar of rot, but the span se­emed sturdy eno­ugh. The­re we­re no re­ta­iners abo­ut to gi­ve wel­co­me, no sign that any per­son in­ha­bi­ted the overg­rown pi­le at all. But Uzun stro­de for­ward con­fi­dently, and Ha­ra­mis fol­lo­wed, mar­ve­ling at stran­gely car­ved pil­lars and wall-pa­nels, and or­na­te flo­or mo­sa­ics ba­rely vi­sib­le thro­ugh the mos­ses and lic­hens un­der­fo­ot. They pas­sed a splas­hing fo­un­ta­in, and went thro­ugh arch­ways hung with drip­ping strands of vi­nes, in­to tang­led gar­dens glo­ri­o­us with flo­wers of many co­lors.</p>
   <p>    They stop­ped at last in front of a wo­oden do­or of po­lis­hed black wo­od with no moss upon it, but ha­ving hin­ges and fit­tings and a gre­at ring-latch of what ap­pe­ared to be so­lid gold. In the cen­ter was a car­ved or­na­ment fas­hi­oned from the sa­me wo­od, all fimb­ri­ate with shi­ning pla­ti­num; and it had the ima­ge of a Black Tril­li­um.</p>
   <p>    "This is the cham­ber of the Arc­hi­ma­ge Bi­nah her­self," Uzun sa­id. "But only you may en­ter." He bo­wed to Ha­ra­mis, and step­ped back.</p>
   <p>    She he­si­ta­ted. "But-you must ac­com­pany me!"</p>
   <p>    "Nay, my Prin­cess. I will wa­it for you."</p>
   <p>    Haramis drew her­self up. "Very well." For­cing her hand not to tremb­le, she to­ok hold of the gol­den ring and pul­led. The tall do­or swung open easily, and she step­ped in­si­de.</p>
   <p>    The ro­om was dim and warm, wit­ho­ut win­dows. The­re we­re many pi­eces of fur­ni­tu­re half vi­sib­le in it - cup­bo­ards and pres­ses and bo­oks­hel­ves and tab­les strewn with stran­ge imp­le­ments, pad­ded sto­ols and set­tles, and a hu­ge bed with dark han­gings. At one wall was a he­arth with a small pe­at fi­re bur­ning, and be­fo­re it sto­od a hand­so­me tab­le with a sing­le pla­ce-set­ting of crystal, and a gol­den kni­fe and spo­on. Co­ve­red gol­den dis­hes ste­amed and ga­ve forth a de­li­ci­o­us smell. A fla­gon of ho­ney-wi­ne sto­od by, and a be­a­uti­ful lamp with a sha­de of le­aded opa­les­cent glass cast light over all. The­re we­re two car­ved cha­irs, one be­fo­re the fo­od and anot­her op­po­si­te, be­fo­re which on the tab­le sat a pla­inly wro­ught small cas­ket of pla­ti­num, very den­ted and bat­te­red and dul­led from long use.</p>
   <p>    "Welcome, my child," sa­id a soft but re­so­nant vo­ice. "I ha­ve be­en wa­iting for you."</p>
   <p>    Haramis star­ted, and lo­oked abo­ut, and saw a pa­le sha­pe mo­ve in the gre­at bed. "My Lady?" she sa­id, curt­se­ying al­most auto­ma­ti­cal­ly.</p>
   <p>    "Come and as­sist me, and I will sit with you whi­le you di­ne."</p>
   <p>    Wondering, Ha­ra­mis as­ked, "Are you the Arc­hi­ma­ge Bi­nah?"</p>
   <p>    "I am she. Do not be af­ra­id. I am the one who sto­od by at yo­ur birth and who sum­mo­ned you he­re. I ha­ve long awa­ited yo­ur co­ming and that of yo­ur sis­ters, and I gi­ve thanks that you ha­ve ar­ri­ved sa­fely."</p>
   <p>    Haramis sto­od stock-still. "Ka­di­ya and Ani­gel - they are ali­ve?"</p>
   <p>    "They are. Do not worry abo­ut them now, for they must fol­low the­ir own paths and you yo­urs. Co­me. Help me to en­ro­be."</p>
   <p>    Haramis co­uld not mo­ve. A gre­at fe­ar had ta­ken hold of her. She knew now that, li­ke it or not, she was go­ing to ha­ve to em­bark on so­me ter­rib­le ad­ven­tu­re.</p>
   <p>    In the bed lay a wo­man with be­a­uti­ful flo­wing whi­te ha­ir, who sat up slowly and bec­ko­ned to the girl. Her fa­ce was smo­oth and un­li­ned, and only her eyes, dark-sha­do­wed and set so de­ep in the skull that the­ir co­lor was un­gu­es­sab­le, bet­ra­yed her gre­at age. Her ga­ze ens­na­red Ha­ra­mis and drew her for­ward with ir­re­sis­tib­le po­wer. Ha­ra­mis set down the Crown bund­le on the flo­or and wal­ked in ter­ror to the bed. But then she was sud­denly set free, and the pa­nic left her, and it se­emed that the per­son sit­ting the­re was only a po­or sick old wo­man ne­eding help.</p>
   <p>    Haramis as­sis­ted the Arc­hi­ma­ge to don a long whi­te ro­be that shim­me­red blue in its fol­dings, and put fur slip­pers on her long, slen­der fe­et. When the wo­man sto­od up, Ha­ra­mis saw that she was very tall. Her fi­gu­re was not sto­oped, but erect and sup­ple, and she mo­ved slowly to the tab­le be­fo­re the fi­re and sat down.</p>
   <p>    "Please be se­ated al­so, my child, and eat. You must be fa­mis­hed af­ter yo­ur or­de­al at the Ci­ta­del and yo­ur jo­ur­ney he­re."</p>
   <p>    "My com­pa­ni­on, the mu­si­ci­an Uzun - " Ha­ra­mis be­gan.</p>
   <p>    "He is be­ing at­ten­ded to by my own ste­ward, Da­ma­to­le, and will not want for rest and ref­resh­ment."</p>
   <p>    "I thank you," Ha­ra­mis sa­id, "for I owe my li­fe to him, and I wo­uld not ha­ve him suf­fer for his de­vo­ti­on to me."</p>
   <p>    Then she fell upon the fo­od with the fi­er­ce ap­pe­ti­te of the yo­ung and he­althy, for she had not eaten sin­ce the pre­vi­o­us mor­ning. The­re was a ro­ast fowl, and cre­amy so­up with pun­gent herbs, and a dish of ba­ked do­run tu­bers all crus­ted with brown al­ga-che­ese, and a bit­ter-cress sa­lad, and a tart­let full of so­me plump, unk­nown fru­it that was tangy on her pa­la­te af­ter the he­avy re­past - of which Ha­ra­mis de­vo­ured the last crumb.</p>
   <p>    Then she sig­hed, and sat back sip­ping at the ex­qu­isi­te wi­ne. The Arc­hi­ma­ge smi­led, and Ha­ra­mis la­ug­hed ru­eful­ly and sa­id: "I did not even think to wash my hands be­fo­re di­ning. And I gob­bled yo­ur de­li­ci­o­us me­al li­ke an ill-bred serf. For this lack of go­od man­ners, I beg yo­ur par­don, Lady Bi­nah. I wo­uld cle­ar the tab­le and cle­an up the dis­hes in amends, but I con­fess I do not know how such scul­lery mat­ters are ma­na­ged."</p>
   <p>    "Here in Noth," sa­id the Arc­hi­ma­ge, "one for­tu­na­tely ne­ed not bot­her with tri­vi­ali­ti­es." She ges­tu­red, whe­re­upon the tab­le was cle­ar of all ex­cept the wi­ne-fla­gon, Ha­ra­mis"s gob­let, and the myste­ri­o­us pla­ti­num cas­ket.</p>
   <p>    "So you are a sor­ce­ress in­de­ed," mur­mu­red the girl.</p>
   <p>    "Such tricks re­qu­ire only small skill," Bi­nah ad­mit­ted. "It is the lar­ger enc­hant­ments that are now be­yond my wa­ning po­wers."</p>
   <p>    "Since yo­ur lam­mer­ge­i­ers bro­ught me he­re, I sup­po­se you know what has hap­pe­ned."</p>
   <p>    "The gre­at flyers are not mi­ne," the sor­ce­ress cor­rec­ted. "They are free cre­atu­res, be­lon­ging only to them­sel­ves. It is true that I ba­de them bring you, for they may cho­ose to obey cer­ta­in of the­ir fri­ends. As to yo­ur qu­es­ti­on -yes, I do know what has hap­pe­ned. I ha­ve se­en it all, and wept for my im­po­ten­ce to pre­vent it."</p>
   <p>    Haramis pre­ser­ved a ne­ut­ral exp­res­si­on. "Yo­ur mas­tery of ma­gic is then in­suf­fi­ci­ent to de­li­ver Ru­wen­da from the mur­de­rer Volt­rik and his co­nj­urer Oro­gas­tus?"</p>
   <p>    "Even so. I warn you not to un­de­res­ti­ma­te Oro­gas­tus, my child. He is no com­mon tricks­ter as are the ma­gi­ci­ans of yo­ur li­mi­ted ac­qu­a­in­tan­ce. He is a man of pro­fo­und ac­comp­lish­ment who not only com­mands the storm but holds the key to many ot­her fe­ar­so­me enc­hant­ments. He se­eks po­wer whe­re­ver he can find it and use it as he wills for his own pur­po­ses. He now trans­cends me in all po­wers sa­ve that of far­ga­zing; for this he re­qu­ires the ice-mir­ror hid­den de­ep in his mo­un­ta­in la­ir."</p>
   <p>    "Then you can­not help me to bring down Ru­wen­da's ene­mi­es?"</p>
   <p>    "I did not say that. But the res­to­ra­ti­on of Ru­wen­da is a thre­efold task re­qu­iring the co­ope­ra­ti­on of all three of the Tril­li­um's Pe­tals - "</p>
   <p>    "You me­an my sis­ters?" Ha­ra­mis's vo­ice was hor­ri­fi­ed and inc­re­du­lo­us. "I don't think we may de­pend on them for very much const­ruc­ti­ve aid. I had to rest­ra­in Ka­di­ya from rus­hing out to at­tack our Mot­her's mur­de­rers with her belt-kni­fe! And Ani­gel do­es not­hing but hud­dle in a cor­ner and we­ep."</p>
   <p>    "Nevertheless, my Sight as­su­res me that all three of you must ac­comp­lish yo­ur fo­re­or­da­ined tasks, mas­te­ring yo­ur own sel­ves abo­ve all, be­fo­re Ru­wen­da may cast off the yo­ke of La­bor­nok. And if any one of you fa­ils, all fa­il."</p>
   <p>    "But that's not fa­ir!" Ha­ra­mis pro­tes­ted.</p>
   <p>    "No." The Arc­hi­ma­ge spo­ke gently. "That is only how it is."</p>
   <p>    Disgruntled, Ha­ra­mis fin­ge­red her tril­li­um amu­let. "I had tho­ught that the­se to­kens of ours, which you ga­ve us, we­re ma­gi­cal. But when I put this one to the test, it fa­iled."</p>
   <p>    "They can only as­sist you in ti­mes of mor­tal dan­ger, and the­ir po­wers are li­mi­ted."</p>
   <p>    "So I dis­co­ve­red," Ha­ra­mis sig­hed. "Well, my first pra­yer was well-answe­red, and my se­cond and third we­re not so ur­gent as I then tho­ught. Is this amu­let to ha­ve a ro­le in the tasks you will as­sign me?"</p>
   <p>    "That I do not know. You must find out its sec­rets, just as you must le­arn the sec­ret wit­hin you and con­qu­er the flaws and we­ak­nes­ses that wo­uld def­lect you from yo­ur des­tiny. But this I do know: when yo­ur pre­li­mi­nary work is ac­comp­lis­hed, then you will be gi­ven a sign. A new ta­lis­man, the Three-Win­ged Circ­le, will co­me to you. Then you will know that the fi­nal strug­gle for Ru­wen­da and for yo­ur own so­ul is at hand."</p>
   <p>    "And my sis­ters?"</p>
   <p>    "They will ha­ve the­ir own work. And, if they suc­ce­ed, the­ir own ta­lis­mans. The Three Pe­tals of the Tril­li­um will then call out to one anot­her and uni­te, and from this will co­me the re­so­lu­ti­on - the res­to­ra­ti­on of the lost ba­lan­ce of the world."</p>
   <p>    Haramis slum­ped in her cha­ir. "This task. Must I be­gin it at on­ce? I am so we­ary. And I me­an you no dis­res­pect, but what you say is hard to be­li­eve. I did not even be­li­eve in yo­ur exis­ten­ce - "</p>
   <p>    "What you be­li­eve, even at this mo­ment, do­es not mat­ter, for you are worn down from sor­row and fe­ar. You must pray for strength and co­ura­ge, and abo­ve all you must le­arn to trust yo­ur­self and the Tri­une Po­wer that lo­ves and gu­ides us all."</p>
   <p>    Haramis ut­te­red an iro­nic small la­ugh. "I am in so­re ne­ed of mo­re conc­re­te help."</p>
   <p>    "The abo­ri­gi­nes will help you on yo­ur qu­est as they are ab­le - the Folk of the swamp, the fo­rest, and the mo­un­ta­ins. They re­ve­re the Black Tril­li­um, as do the hu­man in­ha­bi­tants of Ru­wen­da."</p>
   <p>    "Am I to ta­ke Uzun with me? He is el­derly -"</p>
   <p>    "He will ac­com­pany you part way on the long jo­ur­ney you must now un­der­ta­ke. It is <emphasis>our</emphasis> des­tiny to help you ac­hi­eve yo­urs. But the gre­atest chal­len­ges you must fa­ce alo­ne."</p>
   <p>    Haramis was lost in int­ros­pec­ti­on, sta­ring at the pe­at fla­mes bur­ning low in the he­arth, and fin­ge­ring her amu­let. "Can you tell me the na­tu­re of this so­ul-per­fec­ting qu­est?"</p>
   <p>    "No. But you will know it."</p>
   <p>    She cri­ed out, "Can you do anyt­hing to help me, asi­de from this sup­per and yo­ur ad­vi­ce and go­od wis­hes?"</p>
   <p>    "That I can."</p>
   <p>    The Arc­hi­ma­ge ope­ned the pla­ti­num cas­ket and re­ac­hed in­si­de with both hands. Lif­ting, she ro­se to her fe­et, and in so­me mi­ra­cu­lo­us man­ner she bro­ught out a gre­at gre­en gro­wing plant, much lar­ger than co­uld ha­ve fit in­si­de the cas­ket by any nor­mal me­ans. It was a tril­li­um ne­arly as tall as Ha­ra­mis her­self, ba­re-ro­oted, with spre­ading glossy le­aves, and se­ed­pods, and a myri­ad of night-black blos­soms each as lar­ge as an outst­retc­hed hand. This the Arc­hi­ma­ge set upon the tab­le.</p>
   <p>    Haramis cri­ed out in as­to­nish­ment. "How be­a­uti­ful! And it is ali­ve, not a tiny fos­sil en­tom­bed in am­ber!"</p>
   <p>    "It is the last li­ving Black Tril­li­um plant in the known world."</p>
   <p>    "And thro­ugh it we three shall con­qu­er King Volt­rik and Oro­gas­tus! I know this is true, Bi­nah! I know it!" Ha­ra­mis sprang to her fe­et, all we­ari­ness fal­len away, drin­king in the sight of the wond­ro­us plant who­se flo­wers we­re the co­lor of her ha­ir.</p>
   <p>    The enc­hant­ress stretc­hed out her hand and pluc­ked so­met­hing from be­ne­ath one of the gre­at le­aves. This she pres­sed in­to Ha­ra­mis's palm and clo­sed the girl's fin­gers abo­ut it. Then she lif­ted the plant, so­me­how put it aga­in in­to the small pla­ti­num cas­ket, and lo­we­red the lid.</p>
   <p>    Haramis blin­ked as tho­ugh a bright light had be­en ex­tin­gu­is­hed, along with the cer­ta­inty she had just felt. "But… is that all?"</p>
   <p>    The Arc­hi­ma­ge to­ok her by the arm and led her to the outer do­or. "What I ha­ve gi­ven you will set you on yo­ur way. I shall ke­ep the Crown of Ru­wen­da sa­fe he­re for you. No enemy shall ever to­uch it. Only re­mem­ber that Oro­gas­tus, not King Volt­rik, is yo­ur true enemy. But he li­ves by the laws of ma­gic, which dec­la­re that for every strength the­re must be a cor­res­pon­ding vul­ne­ra­bi­lity or we­ak­ness. If you can find his we­ak­ness and van­qu­ish yo­ur own, you will tri­umph. I can tell you no mo­re. Now you must go. When you ac­hi­eve yo­ur go­al of the Three-Win­ged Circ­le, re­turn to me."</p>
   <p>    "But what is the Three-Win­ged Circ­le?" Ha­ra­mis as­ked an­xi­o­usly.</p>
   <p>    "You will know it when you find it," Bi­nah as­su­red her. "Fa­re­well."</p>
   <p>    Suddenly Ha­ra­mis sto­od aga­in on the flo­wer-strewn gre­ens­ward be­fo­re the mossy to­wer, and Uzun was be­si­de her, dres­sed in fresh new clot­hes. She lo­oked down and saw that her own dirty and wil­ted whi­te gown and clo­ak had di­sap­pe­ared, and she now wo­re a su­it of whi­te wo­ol trim­med with al­bi­no fe­dok-fur, over which lay the amu­let on its cha­in, and a fur-li­ned clo­ak, and strong whi­te-le­at­her bo­ots. On the gro­und lay two knap­sacks, and two sto­ut wal­king sticks with iron-shod po­ints.</p>
   <p>    "I am re­ady, Prin­cess," Uzun sa­id. He grin­ned up at her, and his ro­und che­eks we­re as rosy as ri­pe clo­ud­ber­ri­es. "The Whi­te Lady has even gi­ven me a new fip­ple flu­te, so that I can che­er our jo­ur­ney with mu­sic!"</p>
   <p>    "But which way are we to go?" Ha­ra­mis clenc­hed her hands in ve­xa­ti­on. Then she was re­min­ded that the Arc­hi­ma­ge had put so­met­hing in her hand. She un­cur­led her fin­gers, and in her palm lay a pod of the Black Tril­li­um, dry and shiny. Unt­hin­king, she crac­ked it open. In­si­de we­re rows of win­ged se­eds. Aga­in wit­ho­ut cons­ci­o­us tho­ught she pluc­ked one se­ed forth and cast it in­to the air. To her surp­ri­se, ins­te­ad of drif­ting off on the wind, it flo­ated north­ward, to­ward the mo­un­ta­ins.</p>
   <p>    The way se­emed a track­less high bog­land. But then Ha­ra­mis lo­oked mo­re clo­sely, fol­lo­wing the flo­ating se­ed, and saw a fa­int path, such as might ha­ve be­en ma­de by a small ani­mal mo­ving thro­ugh the grass tufts and sed­ges.</p>
   <p>    "So," sa­id she. "I sup­po­se this is as go­od a gu­ide as we may ex­pect. Shall we start?"</p>
   <p>    Her eye fi­xed on the tiny flo­ating speck of whi­te, she ho­is­ted her pack, to­ok up the stick, and led the way in­to the bog, Uzun fol­lo­wing at her he­els.</p>

   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    It was mid-after­no­on when the lo­oko­ut on the le­ading flat-bo­at sang out: "Tre­vis­ta in vi­ew!"</p>
   <p>    The tra­de-gu­ide Pel­lan, who was the skip­per in char­ge of the imp­ro­vi­sed La­bor­no­ki flo­til­la, ra­ised a small gol­den horn to his lips and blew a three-no­te call. Im­me­di­ately the ro­wers in all fo­ur­te­en of the bo­ats lif­ted the­ir swe­eps, and crews in the bow and stern of each craft drop­ped anc­hors in­to the shal­low muddy wa­ter. Pel­lan so­un­ded anot­her mo­re comp­lex horn-call and ga­ve or­ders for the swe­ating ri­ver­men to ta­ke the­ir ease.</p>
   <p>    A bel­low of fury aro­se from the fo­re­deck, and a gra­vel­ly vo­ice sho­uted Pel­lan's na­me, emb­ro­ide­red with co­lor­ful obs­ce­ni­ti­es. In spi­te of the fact that the jo­ur­ney up-ri­ver from the Ci­ta­del had be­en comp­le­ted in re­cord ti­me, Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil had still dis­co­ve­red so­met­hing fresh to comp­la­in abo­ut.</p>
   <p>    Sighing, the skip­per ma­de his way from the til­ler-ho­use in the stern-she­ets ac­ross the smelly af­ter­deck. Un­li­ke the ot­her bo­ats in the tra­in, this one did not carry supply wa­gons or draft ani­mals. But the mo­unts of the high no­bi­lity we­re tet­he­red back he­re (God only kno­wing what use the con­qu­erors ho­ped to ma­ke of them in the track­less swamps aro­und Tre­vis­ta), to­get­her with the­ir fe­ed and tack, le­at­her sacks full of arms and ar­mor, and a gang of twenty or thirty host­lers, sol­di­ers, and as­sor­ted lac­keys who lo­un­ged abo­ut gamb­ling, sno­ozing, or tra­ding bit­ter jests with the oars­men.</p>
   <p>    Pellan pa­used at the lit­tle mids­hips deck­ho­use that ho­used the gal­ley and his own small ac­com­mo­da­ti­on - the lat­ter com­man­de­ered by the sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus and his two ma­le­vo­lent at­ten­dants -to or­der the mes­smen to ser­ve a si­zab­le ra­ti­on of wi­ne to the ex­ha­us­ted ro­wers and a to­ken drink to the La­bor­no­ki com­mo­ners to fo­res­tall grumb­ling.</p>
   <p>    Then he slip­ped past a knot of ser­ge­ants, who glo­we­red at him be­ca­use the flo­til­la's halt had dep­ri­ved them of the co­oling bre­eze of pas­sa­ge, and ar­ri­ved at last on the fo­re­deck. An aw­ning had be­en erec­ted the­re to sha­de the pri­vi­le­ged pas­sen­gers, who inc­lu­ded Prin­ce An­tar's knightly party, Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil and the hand­ful of ran­king of­fi­cers he had bro­ught on the re­con­no­ite­ring ex­pe­di­ti­on, and the Mas­ter-Tra­der Ed­zar, newly dub­bed of­fi­ci­al spo­kes­man to the Tre­vis­ta abo­ri­gi­nes on be­half of the oc­cup­ying for­ces of La­bor­nok.</p>
   <p>    Most of the yo­un­ger knights we­re han­ging over the ra­ils, pe­ering in­to the dis­tan­ce in a va­in at­tempt to catch a glimp­se of the fa­bu­lo­us Od­dling city. Wit­ho­ut the­ir flam­bo­yant ena­me­led ar­mor they we­re a ro­ugh and tat­ty-lo­oking crew, dres­sed in rusty, swe­at-sta­ined smocks and trews. The nob­les and high of­fi­cers we­re si­mi­larly at­ti­red in a simp­le style of und­ress, dis­tin­gu­is­hed from the knights' only for be­ing fa­irly cle­an. The sto­ut Mas­ter-Tra­der, on the ot­her hand, was as ela­bo­ra­tely gar­bed as a co­ur­ti­er at a ro­yal audi­en­ce, we­aring his gu­ild's gold-embro­ide­red gre­en ta­bard over a ga­uzy ro­be of cad­mi­um-oran­ge. His en­semb­le was top­ped off by an ext­ra­or­di­nary bro­ad-brim­med hat wo­ven of a gre­en le­afy ma­te­ri­al and de­co­ra­ted with a band of li­ving flo­wers.</p>
   <p>    "Why ha­ve we stop­ped?" Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil de­man­ded ru­dely of Pel­lan. "If that's Tre­vis­ta up ahe­ad the­re, then sha­ke yo­ur lazy ta­il and get a mo­ve on! You we­re told we wan­ted to get the­re as qu­ickly as pos­sib­le."</p>
   <p>    The flo­til­la had co­me to a stands­till out in the mid­dle of the Lo­wer Mu­tar, which was so bro­ad at this po­int that the Black­mi­re banks we­re ne­arly a le­ague away on eit­her si­de. Pel­lan ga­ve a neg­li­gent sa­lu­te to the scow­ling of­fi­cer. "We must fol­low the Mas­ter-Tra­ders' Pro­to­cols, my Ge­ne­ral, and wa­it for our Nysso­mu es­cort in­to Tre­vis­ta."</p>
   <p>    "Traders?!" exc­la­imed the La­bor­no­ki com­man­der-in-chi­ef. "We're not a pack of ped­dlers, we're con­qu­erors -and we fol­low no Pro­to­cols but our own! Up anc­hor, you slug­wit, and mo­ve on!"</p>
   <p>    "Sir, that wo­uld be most un­wi­se. I co­uldn't ta­ke res­pon­si­bi­lity for what might hap­pen." The Ru­wen­di­an turn­co­at had a fa­ce as brown and to­ugh as the old le­at­her gar­ments he wo­re. His jowls we­re scratchy with whi­te stub­ble from the­ir three-day jo­ur­ney upst­re­am, and his exp­res­si­on ver­ged on the in­so­lent. "The­se wild Od­dlings are a to­uchy lot. No tel­ling what they'd do if we just bar­ged in­to Tre­vis­ta on our own -"</p>
   <p>    "Ruwenda is ours and we do as we ple­ase!" Ha­mil ro­ared. He drew his sword. "Now get a mo­ve on, or I'll ven­ti­la­te yo­ur gul­let!"</p>
   <p>    Pellan, un­per­tur­bed by the thre­at, tur­ned to the La­bor­no­ki Mas­ter-Tra­der, who had be­en re­ga­ling the Ge­ne­ral and his cro­ni­es with sto­ri­es of the fa­bu­lo­us hid­den ci­ti­es of the Va­nis­hed Ones. "You talk to him, Mas­ter Ed­zar. He just do­esn't se­em to un­ders­tand the si­tu­ati­on-" The bo­at­man's vo­ice bro­ke off in a scre­ech as Ha­mil grip­ped a hand­ful of his griz­zled ha­ir and ra­ised his sword.</p>
   <p>    "General! Hold, I say!"</p>
   <p>    Prince An­tar, who had suf­fe­red from a mo­od of de­j­ec­ti­on thro­ug­ho­ut most of the jo­ur­ney and was sit­ting by him­self up in the bows, pus­hed thro­ugh the crowd of knights, who we­re wa­iting ho­pe­ful­ly for blo­ods­hed, and conf­ron­ted the burly old sol­di­er. Grud­gingly, Ha­mil let the skip­per go. Pel­lan scut­tled out of re­ach and the Mas­ter-Tra­der step­ped for­ward to bow to the Prin­ce.</p>
   <p>    "Do let me exp­la­in, High Lord. I as­su­re you that our new ally Pel­lan has only the best in­te­rests of La­bor­nok at he­art."</p>
   <p>    "He'd bet­ter," Ha­mil mut­te­red, "or he'll find him­self at the bot­tom of the Mu­tar with swamp-worms nib­bling on his fa­mily jewels."</p>
   <p>    Most of the knights la­ug­hed, but the Prin­ce sa­id, "Say on, Mas­ter Ed­zar."</p>
   <p>    "Yonder li­es Tre­vis­ta." The Mas­ter-Tra­der ges­tu­red di­rectly upst­re­am to­ward a mass of low hil­locks, dis­tant blobs of gre­en with de­ep purp­le sha­dows that shim­me­red in the he­at-ha­ze and fil­led the ma­in chan­nel of the Mu­tar from one si­de to the ot­her. "It li­es on that gro­up of is­lands, at the conf­lu­en­ce of the Vis­par Ri­ver and the Up­per Mu­tar. But the pla­ce is not the kind of city that we La­bor­no­ki are fa­mi­li­ar with - nor even the Ru­wen­di­ans - and the so-cal­led Tre­vis­ta Fa­ir is not an event that al­ways ta­kes pla­ce in the sa­me lo­ca­ti­on. Rat­her, it mo­ves abo­ut Tre­vis­ta as the mo­od stri­kes the lo­cal Nysso­mu, so that not even tra­der-gu­ides such as our worthy fri­end Pel­lan may say for cer­ta­in whe­re it may be fo­und this day."</p>
   <p>    Osorkon, Ha­mil's gar­gan­tu­an de­puty, ga­ve a de­ri­si­ve snort. "A city on an is­land - and you can't track down a wretc­hed Od­dling mar­ket even if it do­es skip abo­ut li­ke a spring­fish on hot mud."</p>
   <p>    "Trevista do­es not lie on one is­land, Lord Osor­kon." Ed­zar's hand swept the ho­ri­zon. "It is on all of them."</p>
   <p>    The com­pany gas­ped.</p>
   <p>    "It is -or was -the crow­ning arc­hi­tec­tu­ral glory of the Va­nis­hed Ones. Be­si­de it, the im­men­sity of Ru­wen­da Ci­ta­del is but a cru­de strong­hold, a re­fu­ge aga­inst wha­te­ver di­sas­ter ul­ti­ma­tely bro­ught down the an­ci­ent ra­ce. Every one of tho­se hund­reds of is­lands is crow­ded with ru­ins, and bet­we­en them is an int­ri­ca­te ma­ze of ca­nals with walls sunk de­ep in­to the ri­ver­bed. The­re are wa­ter­ga­tes, hu­ge brid­ges, crumb­ling dock­yards - every man­ner of ri­pa­ri­an struc­tu­re, to say not­hing of de­re­lict pub­lic bu­il­dings, gor­ge­o­us de­ca­yed dwel­lings, and gre­at pla­zas and ar­ca­des all cho­ked with den­se jung­le growth in pla­ces whe­re the Nysso­mu ha­ve for­bor­ne to in­ter­fe­re."</p>
   <p>    "How much of the city is in­ha­bi­ted by the abo­ri­gi­nes?" the Prin­ce as­ked.</p>
   <p>    "No one knows, High Lord. The wild­ling Nysso­mu dis­da­in so­ci­al con­tact with hu­ma­nity. We tra­ders are led to the fa­ir lo­ca­ti­on, and the­re the in­di­vi­du­al Od­dlings prof­fer such go­ods as they think will in­te­rest us." Avo­iding Ha­mil's gla­re, he ad­ded: "If this flo­til­la we­re to pe­net­ra­te Tre­vis­ta wit­ho­ut per­mis­si­on -you will no­ti­ce that I do <emphasis>not</emphasis> say unan­no­un­ced, be­ca­use they al­ways know when we are co­ming - it is li­kely that not a sing­le Nysso­mu wo­uld con­des­cend to show its fa­ce. We wo­uld find the pla­ce de­ser­ted. As for in­va­ding Tre­vis­ta with a vi­ew to con­qu­est, such a ven­tu­re wo­uld be fu­ti­le. The va­lue of that vast as­semb­la­ge of ru­ins li­es only in its tra­de­go­ods, and for tho­se we must cul­ti­va­te the go­od will of the Od­dlings."</p>
   <p>    "Well spo­ken, Mas­ter Ed­zar." The Prin­ce cast a me­aning­ful lo­ok at the Ge­ne­ral. "And if we do ga­in the­ir con­fi­den­ce - as­su­ring them that tra­de will con­ti­nue wit­ho­ut a bre­ak un­der La­bor­nok's ru­le of Ru­wen­da-do you be­li­eve that they will co­ope­ra­te?"</p>
   <p>    "One can ho­pe so, High Lord."</p>
   <p>    "We're damn well go­ing to es­tab­lish a Tre­vis­ta gar­ri­son!" Ha­mil dec­la­red. "That was King Volt­rik's or­der. And tho­se lit­tle swamp-stom­pers had bet­ter not col­lu­de in any tre­ason with the fu­gi­ti­ve Prin­ces­ses if they know what's go­od for them!"</p>
   <p>    "It's cle­ar," sa­id the Prin­ce qu­i­etly, "that Nysso­mu lo­yal­ti­es are stron­ger for the Prin­ces­ses than for us. We shall ha­ve to lo­ca­te the girls by subt­lety rat­her than by a cru­de show of for­ce." His ga­ze swept the as­semb­led knights, fi­nal­ly co­ming to rest on the fa­ce of Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil. "Is that cle­ar?"</p>
   <p>    "Perfectly," Ha­mil rumb­led, ad­ding a be­la­ted, "my Prin­ce."</p>
   <p>    "Wherry from Tre­vis­ta in vi­ew!" the lo­oko­ut sang.</p>
   <p>    Most of the knights rus­hed back to the ra­ils to watch the ap­pro­ach of the stran­ge lit­tle craft. It was not pro­pel­led by oars or a sa­il, yet ca­me to­ward the flat­bo­at tra­in at a high ra­te of spe­ed, le­aving a gle­aming V-sha­ped wa­ke on the slug­gish wa­ter. It se­emed to carry a sing­le oc­cu­pant and it was la­vishly de­co­ra­ted with flo­wers from stem to stern.</p>
   <p>    "What in the world pro­vi­des its mo­ti­ve po­wer?" as­ked the ama­zed Sir Owa­non.</p>
   <p>    Pellan, well out of Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil's re­ach and with his dig­nity res­to­red, rep­li­ed: "It is ha­uled along by a pa­ir of ri­mo­riks, aqu­atic cre­atu­res re­semb­ling lar­ge pel­riks. Un­for­tu­na­tely, the be­asts re­sist do­mes­ti­ca­ti­on by hu­mans. Even among the Nysso­mu, not too many ha­ve the knack of dri­ving them, for this is a trick they must le­arn from the­ir un­so­ci­ab­le co­usins, the Uis­gu. Mem­bers of this lat­ter tri­be co­me re­gu­larly to Tre­vis­ta, brin­ging tra­de items from the nort­hern re­ac­hes of the Mi­re."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­ce to­ok Ed­zar by the sho­ul­der and led him apart from the ot­hers, to­ward the mids­hips deck­ho­use. "Expla­in to me what you me­ant by our flo­til­la not be­ing unan­no­un­ced. Do you me­an to say that the Tre­vis­ta Od­dlings ha­ve be­en ab­le to ke­ep track of our vo­ya­ging, in spi­te of the do­ub­le-ti­me pa­ce we ma­in­ta­ined co­ming up-ri­ver?"</p>
   <p>    The Mas­ter-Tra­der shrug­ged. "High Lord, they spe­ak to one anot­her at a dis­tan­ce, using spe­ech wit­ho­ut words, even as the Lord Oro­gas­tus bes­pe­aks his at­ten­dant Vo­ices."</p>
   <p>    The do­or to Pel­lan's ca­bin ope­ned so ab­ruptly that both the Prin­ce and the Mas­ter star­ted. The tall, black-and-whi­te-clad sor­ce­rer him­self sto­od the­re, ho­oded so that the up­per part of his fa­ce was in de­ep sha­dow. Be­hind him we­re two ot­her ca­ped and cow­led fi­gu­res, the acoly­tes known as Vo­ices, a stocky one dres­sed in red and a tall rangy one we­aring blue.</p>
   <p>    "That is cor­rect," Oro­gas­tus in­to­ned. "The non­hu­mans emp­loy a cru­de form of te­le­pathy, and on oc­ca­si­on are even ab­le to descry events at a dis­tan­ce thro­ugh the Sight -altho­ugh the­ir com­mand of both po­wers is gre­atly in­fe­ri­or to my own."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­ce or­de­red the Mas­ter-Tra­der to le­ave them; and when the man was go­ne he sa­id coldly to Oro­gas­tus: "Grand Mi­nis­ter, you ne­ver spo­ke of this to me be­fo­re."</p>
   <p>    "There was no ne­ed. The mat­ter was of no con­se­qu­en­ce du­ring the in­va­si­on, and we ne­ver in­ten­ded to wa­ge war on the abo­ri­gi­nes. On the cont­rary… We will be ma­king very go­od use of the cre­atu­res."</p>
   <p>    "Then you ha­ve a plan for ga­ining an al­li­an­ce with the­se small Od­dlings, as we did with the Skri­tek? My Ro­yal Fat­her hin­ted as much to me du­ring the march to the Ci­ta­del." An­tar spo­ke stiffly, his man­ner com­bi­ning de­fe­ren­ce and re­sent­ment. Even tho­ugh he was six-and-twenty ye­ars of age, ne­it­her the King nor his myste­ri­o­us Grand Mi­nis­ter of Sta­te had se­en fit to con­fi­de any of the­ir long-ran­ge plans to him.</p>
   <p>    "With cer­ta­in of the tri­bes, when the ti­me is ri­pe, we will en­ter in­to po­li­ti­cal al­li­an­ce." Oro­gas­tus wa­ved his hand in a dis­mis­si­ve ges­tu­re. "Not with the­se paltry Nysso­mu, ho­we­ver. They are only use­ful to us for the herbs, spi­ces, and ot­her pro­ducts of the swamp that they sell. They ha­ve long sin­ce gle­aned the most in­te­res­ting an­ti­que ar­ti­facts from Tre­vis­ta it­self and from the ne­arer aban­do­ned ci­ti­es, and be­ca­use of the­ir clo­se ti­es to the fal­len Ru­wen­di­ans I do not trust them to exert them­sel­ves in sup­plying us with fresh qu­an­ti­ti­es of the an­ci­ent de­vi­ces. Ho­we­ver, one way or anot­her I in­tend to ha­ve Od­dlings lo­yal to us comb the mo­re re­mo­te parts of the Mazy Mi­re, whe­re I know that the­re are hid­den cer­ta­in ext­ra­or­di­nary ma­gi­cal mac­hi­nes of the Va­nis­hed Ones. The­se, pro­perly uti­li­zed, will enab­le La­bor­nok to ex­tend its ru­le not only ac­ross the en­ti­re Pe­nin­su­la -but even­tu­al­ly thro­ug­ho­ut the known world."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­ce felt his he­art cont­ract. So this was why King Volt­rik had ap­po­in­ted this ups­tart his Grand Mi­nis­ter, aga­inst the ad­vi­ce of his mo­re con­ser­va­ti­ve co­un­se­lors! Was the sor­ce­rer me­rely pla­ying upon Volt­rik's cre­du­lity, or might the mad sche­me ha­ve a ba­sis in fact?</p>
   <p>    Antar's fa­ce sho­wed to­le­rant skep­ti­cism. "So say you? La­bor­nok one day ru­le the world -? No won­der you we­re so de­ter­mi­ned that we sho­uld dec­la­re war on Ru­wen­da! But this, too, is news to me. What is the na­tu­re of this por­ten­to­us gad­getry you se­ek, and how do you ha­ve know­led­ge of it?"</p>
   <p>    "We will dis­cuss this anot­her ti­me, my Prin­ce. The bo­at from Tre­vis­ta is al­most upon us, and yo­ur re­qu­est in­vol­ves mat­ters of the hig­hest ro­yal po­licy that must be enun­ci­ated by the King him­self."</p>
   <p>    A si­bi­lant whis­per ca­me from the crim­son-ro­bed mi­ni­on be­hind the sor­ce­rer, and Oro­gas­tus nod­ded.</p>
   <p>    "The Red Vo­ice re­minds me to in­form you that yo­ur Ro­yal Fat­her's con­di­ti­on has so­mew­hat wor­se­ned. My Gre­en Vo­ice in at­ten­dan­ce at his bed­si­de bes­po­ke the news to us just a short ti­me ago. King Volt­rik suf­fers from fe­ver, and his wo­un­ded hand has be­co­me aff­lic­ted with no­xi­o­us hu­mors. I ha­ve di­rec­ted my Gre­en Vo­ice to ad­mi­nis­ter the most po­tent re­medy at my com­mand, the Gol­den Pas­til­le. This sho­uld bring re­li­ef to our King wit­hin two or three days."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­ce frow­ned. "Why was not this mi­rac­le pill gi­ven ear­li­er?"</p>
   <p>    "It is a me­di­ca­ti­on of the Va­nis­hed Ones, my Prin­ce, in very short supply and su­ited only to the tre­at­ment of li­fe-thre­ate­ning ail­ments. I had ho­ped that King Volt­rik's wo­und wo­uld res­pond to the usu­al mi­nist­ra­ti­ons of the ro­yal physi­ci­an. Sin­ce it has not, the mo­re dras­tic the­rapy of the Gol­den Pas­til­le is in­di­ca­ted."</p>
   <p>    "And this will cer­ta­inly cu­re him?"</p>
   <p>    The sor­ce­rer he­si­ta­ted. "I ha­ve ne­ver known it to fa­il. But I ha­ve da­red to use it only fi­ve ti­mes be­fo­re -thri­ce upon myself, on­ce upon the Blue Vo­ice, and on­ce upon the la­te Prin­cess Shon­da, yo­ur fat­her's se­cond wi­fe, when a thorn-wo­und in her fo­ot be­ca­me mor­ti­fi­ed. Yo­ur Ro­yal Fat­her's inj­ury is, un­for­tu­na­tely, of a pe­cu­li­arly dan­ge­ro­us sort. This is why I fars­pe­ak my at­ten­ding acoly­te at fre­qu­ent in­ter­vals and al­so ke­ep a clo­se watch upon our King by me­ans of the Sight."</p>
   <p>    Prince An­tar's fa­ce was som­ber, lost in tho­ught. "I will re­mem­ber my Ro­yal Fat­her in my pra­yers… And <emphasis>you</emphasis> sho­uld al­so most fer­vently com­mend our King to wha­te­ver exo­tic gods you ack­now­led­ge, sor­ce­rer. For if Volt­rik sho­uld die, the gri­ef of La­bor­nok will be pro­fo­und. And who knows what bra­ve plans may then be con­fo­un­ded?"</p>
   <p>    Antar tur­ned ab­ruptly, and went away.</p>
   <p>    The Red Vo­ice whis­pe­red: "That one will be less pli­ab­le than his fat­her, Al­mighty Mas­ter."</p>
   <p>    The lanky Blue Vo­ice, who sto­od clo­se be­hind the right sho­ul­der of the enc­han­ter, mur­mu­red: "It wo­uld be our ple­asu­re to ar­ran­ge for his re­con­ci­li­ati­on."</p>
   <p>    "No," sa­id Oro­gas­tus firmly. "Not yet. But yo­ur ze­al ple­ases me. And when the ap­prop­ri­ate mo­ment do­es ar­ri­ve you shall be as­sig­ned the task of mo­dif­ying the prin­cely at­ti­tu­de, and be richly re­war­ded for yo­ur suc­ces­sful ef­forts."</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    The flo­wer-be­dec­ked Nysso­mu wherry, pro­ce­eding at a mo­re sta­tely pa­ce, con­duc­ted the flo­til­la to Tre­vis­ta's outer­most is­land, which was evi­dently the des­ti­na­ti­on of cho­ice. The blo­od-red ban­ner of La­bor­nok was now held high in the bows of the le­ading flat­bo­at by Lord Osor­kon, and the knights and the tro­ops abo­ard the ot­her thir­te­en bo­ats car­rying the supply wa­gons had don­ned the­ir ar­mor and ca­pes to pre­sent an im­po­sing ap­pe­aran­ce when they en­te­red the city.</p>
   <p>    "A pity we won't be go­ing to the in­ner is­lands this ti­me," Mas­ter-Tra­der Ed­zar re­mar­ked che­er­ful­ly. "The­re are so­me spec­ta­cu­lar brid­ges and a re­mar­kab­le ru­in of an ast­ro­no­mi­cal ob­ser­va­tory in the­re, with cu­ri­o­us pe­des­tals re­ma­ining whe­re so­me sort of ar­ca­ne equ­ip­ment on­ce sto­od. Ho­we­ver, I think you'll find that this outer is­land is rat­her in­te­res­ting, and the im­por­tant thing isn't sight-se­e­ing, af­ter all, but a sa­tis­fac­tory ini­ti­al me­eting with the Dis­cer­ner Fro­lo­tu and her as­so­ci­ates."</p>
   <p>    "This Dis­cer­ner is the fe­ma­le ru­ler of Tre­vis­ta that you spo­ke of ear­li­er?" Prin­ce An­tar in­qu­ired. He and his men and the army of­fi­cers we­re al­so at­ti­red in the­ir ar­mor now, and An­tar wo­re a co­ro­net on his win­ged blue hel­met.</p>
   <p>    "The Dis­cer­ner do­esn't ru­le, my Prin­ce, she only spe­aks on be­half of her pe­op­le and acts as a li­a­ison bet­we­en the Mas­ter-Tra­ders and the Nysso­mu. But she is the clo­sest thing to a cent­ral aut­ho­rity that the city has - and just abo­ut im­pos­sib­le to ho­od­wink. It's sa­id she can re­ad minds."</p>
   <p>    "And is this true?" Oro­gas­tus as­ked, step­ping for­ward with his two as­sis­tants to jo­in the ot­hers on the fo­re­deck.</p>
   <p>    The Mas­ter cle­ared his thro­at ner­vo­usly. "I can't say for cer­ta­in, my Lord. In my own ex­pe­ri­en­ce, she has shown un­can­ny in­sight in­to one's <emphasis>dis­po­si­ti­on.</emphasis>- if you ta­ke my me­aning."</p>
   <p>    "You me­an," An­tar sta­ted, cut­ting off a res­pon­se by the sor­ce­rer, "that this Dis­cer­ner knows a true-spe­aker from a li­ar."</p>
   <p>    "Almost cer­ta­inly. And -uh -this will pre­sent dif­fi­cul­ti­es in our ne­go­ti­ati­ons. Es­pe­ci­al­ly as re­gards the se­arch for the Prin­ces­ses. We will ha­ve to be tact­ful-"</p>
   <p>    "Damn yo­ur tact!" Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil exp­lo­ded. "If the Od­dlings re­fu­se to help us in our se­arch, then we'll ta­ke hos­ta­ges and for­ce them. Per­haps this Dis­cer­ner her­self wo­uld li­ke a tas­te of Lord Osor­kon's fa­mo­us hos­pi­ta­lity!"</p>
   <p>    Hamil's de­puty, who was on­ce aga­in clad in fe­ar­so­me black-pa­in­ted pla­te, ga­ve a sar­do­nic la­ugh. "It wo­uld be my pri­vi­le­ge."</p>
   <p>    Edzar shrug­ged. "If you to­ok Dis­cer­ner Fro­lo­tu pri­so­ner, the Nysso­mu wo­uld simply ap­po­int anot­her Dis­cer­ner. And it's very li­kely that the who­le tri­be wo­uld va­nish li­ke the mist at no­on­ti­de, and our tra­de with them wo­uld be ter­mi­na­ted. As I ha­ve tri­ed to exp­la­in, my Ge­ne­ral, our op­ti­ons in de­aling with the­se pe­cu­li­ar cre­atu­res are li­mi­ted."</p>
   <p>    Hamil swung abo­ut to ad­dress the sor­ce­rer. "Then you must use yo­ur ma­gic to co­er­ce them!"</p>
   <p>    "We will see," Oro­gas­tus rep­li­ed smo­othly.</p>
   <p>    "Since I am in com­mand of this ex­pe­di­ti­on," Prin­ce An­tar sa­id, "let it be un­ders­to­od that I will be the only one to ne­go­ti­ate with this Dis­cer­ner, La­bor­nok's in­va­si­on of Ru­wen­da was un­der­ta­ken for one prin­ci­pal re­ason: to red­ress our longs­tan­ding tra­de gri­evan­ces and en­su­re a ste­ady supply of vi­tal com­mo­di­ti­es such as mi­ne­rals and tim­ber. I spe­ak for my Ro­yal Fat­her when I say that <emphasis>not­hing</emphasis> must je­opar­di­ze that tra­de. Not the Grand Mi­nis­ter of Sta­te's co­ve­ting of myste­ri­o­us an­ci­ent gimc­racks - and most es­pe­ci­al­ly not our Ge­ne­ral's sing­le­min­ded pur­su­it of the three luck­less girls. You will obey me in this!"</p>
   <p>    "Certainly, my Prin­ce," sa­id Oro­gas­tus, smi­ling.</p>
   <p>    Hamil's eyes dar­ted back and forth bet­we­en An­tar, who­se cad­re of twenty fully ar­med knights had unobt­ru­si­vely mo­ved in to stand by him, and the sor­ce­rer with his enig­ma­tic at­ten­ding Vo­ices. Fi­nal­ly he sa­id: "I am a sol­di­er who fol­lows the or­ders of my King, and it is true that he has set you, my Prin­ce, in aut­ho­rity over this ex­pe­di­ti­on. The­re­fo­re I will do as you say - un­less King Volt­rik him­self sho­uld com­mand ot­her­wi­se."</p>
   <p>    Antar sig­hed. "That will suf­fi­ce." He re­la­xed vi­sibly and so did all his knights, and then ever­yo­ne hur­ri­edly re­tur­ned to the ra­ils so as not to miss the first clo­se vi­ew of Tre­vis­ta.</p>
   <p>    The wherry with its lo­ne Nysso­mu pi­lot led the pro­ces­si­on in­to a chan­nel that se­emed not­hing mo­re than an ope­ning in­to thick jung­le. Gi­gan­tic tre­es of an un­fa­mi­li­ar spe­ci­es, with sub­si­di­ary trunks li­ke flying but­tres­ses, so­ared up se­ve­ral hund­red ells high. They for­med an eme­rald ce­iling abo­ve tang­led un­derg­rowth that se­emed even mo­re rankly im­pe­net­rab­le than any part of the Mi­re that the in­va­ders had al­re­ady tra­ver­sed. At the ed­ge of the chan­nel we­re mas­ses of stran­ge plants with va­ri­co­lo­red red-and-gre­en le­aves the si­ze of do­ors, the­ir mid­ribs and ve­ins all stud­ded with gol­den spi­nes. Vi­nes as thick as cab­les, be­aring swags of purp­le, whi­te, and pink flo­wers, hung from the ove­rarc­hing tree but­tres­ses and tra­iled lan­gu­idly in the dark wa­ter. The muggy air was full of lush frag­ran­ces and the less ple­asant smell of de­cay. Birds, in­sects, and ot­her fo­rest cre­atu­res set up a shri­eking ca­cop­hony just as so­on as the bo­ats en­te­red the chan­nel, and this las­ted un­til the abo­ri­gi­ne in the wherry clim­bed to his fe­et and ut­te­red a shrill, warb­ling cry.</p>
   <p>    Suddenly si­len­ce pre­va­iled, ex­cept for the slow dip­ping of the oars. The Mas­ter-Tra­der Ed­zar po­in­ted word­les­sly ahe­ad as the flo­til­la swung slowly aro­und a bend.</p>
   <p>    At first the men of La­bor­nok co­uld dis­cern not­hing but a con­ti­nu­ing ex­pan­se of gre­enery. But then, as if the­ir eyes be­ca­me ac­cus­to­med to a new man­ner of se­e­ing, mo­nu­men­tal sha­pes be­gan to lo­om up on every hand, all but bu­ri­ed in the ram­pant ve­ge­ta­ti­on. The­re we­re dwel­lings - pa­la­ces, rat­her - that ma­de the man­si­ons of De­ror­gu­ila se­em li­ke pe­asant huts. They sto­od sho­ul­der to sho­ul­der along the wa­ter, splen­did even in de­so­la­ti­on, and the­ir fo­un­da­ti­ons for­med the walls of a gre­at ca­nal fifty ells wi­de. The knights and sol­di­ers gaw­ked and yel­ped li­ke ex­ci­ted child­ren as they flo­ated past one won­der af­ter anot­her.</p>
   <p>    Examples of mag­ni­fi­cent sto­ne­work and car­ving we­re everyw­he­re. Many of the an­ci­ent edi­fi­ces we­re or­na­men­ted with mo­sa­ic fa­ca­des as brightly co­lo­red as the ri­oto­us tro­pi­cal flo­wers. So­me had stac­ked set­back gar­dens. Ot­hers fe­atu­red the re­ma­ins of ex­qu­isi­tely de­sig­ned por­ti­cos, or open gal­le­ri­es with flu­ted pil­lars par­ti­al­ly fal­len down, or crumb­ling esp­la­na­des ra­iled off by richly car­ved ba­lust­ra­des. Rem­nants of myste­ri­o­us sta­tu­ary and hu­ge, bro­ken urns we­re al­most con­ce­aled by ver­dant shro­uds. Tre­es and shrubs had thrust up and buck­led the mul­ti­co­lo­red ex­pan­ses of pa­ve­ment that had on­ce be­en open pla­zas. But no one wo­uld da­re say that the jung­le had rec­la­imed Tre­vis­ta: the an­ci­ent met­ro­po­lis still exu­ded an aura of po­wer and sop­his­ti­ca­ted be­a­uty that the pas­sing of ages had scar­cely di­mi­nis­hed.</p>
   <p>    Now the gu­iding wherry led the bo­ats from the ar­te­ri­al ca­nal in­to a si­de chan­nel, and al­most im­me­di­ately the ve­ge­ta­ti­on mas­king the ru­ins be­gan to chan­ge in cha­rac­ter. Most of the co­los­sal struc­tu­res still ap­pe­ared to be as overg­rown as ever; but so­me of the stre­ets and byways bet­we­en them had be­en cle­ared. The flo­til­la drew clo­se to a bro­ad pub­lic squ­are with an ope­ra­ting fo­un­ta­in at its cen­ter, which lay on the right bank. A gre­at flight of shal­low steps flan­ked by pil­lar­li­ke lamp-stan­dards led from the pla­za to the wa­ter's ed­ge. At the he­ad of the sta­irs wa­ited a com­pact gro­up of so­me two do­zen Nysso­mu. The­re we­re no ot­her na­ti­ve pe­op­le in sight.</p>
   <p>    "But, whe­re is the fa­ir?" Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil de­man­ded. "By Zo­to's Holy Guts -the Od­dlings ha­ve run away af­ter all!"</p>
   <p>    The Mas­ter-Tra­der win­ced and his­sed, "Softly, ple­ase, my Ge­ne­ral! The Dis­cer­ner Fro­lo­tu and her tri­bal de­le­ga­ti­on may ta­ke of­fen­se."</p>
   <p>    "Spy them out, wi­zard!" Ha­mil per­sis­ted. "Are the sli­me-skin­ned lit­tle mud-lo­vers lur­king in am­bush?"</p>
   <p>    "Be qu­i­et, you fo­ol," Oro­gas­tus re­tor­ted. With a curt ges­tu­re he sum­mo­ned the two Vo­ices, who fell to the­ir kne­es, si­de by si­de on the flat­bo­at deck fa­cing the pla­za. Both Ha­mil and Prin­ce An­tar had se­en the sor­ce­rer uti­li­ze his mi­ni­ons in the Sight be­fo­re; but the knights and of­fi­cers and the Mas­ter-Tra­der watc­hed cu­ri­o­usly as Oro­gas­tus to­ok up a po­si­ti­on be­hind the pa­ir, un­ce­re­mo­ni­o­usly yan­ked down the blue and red ho­ods, and res­ted his hands on the two sha­ven he­ads.</p>
   <p>    The sor­ce­rer's own he­ad was ba­re, and his snowy ha­ir se­emed to glow in the gre­en glo­aming of the tro­pi­cal af­ter­no­on. Slowly he clo­sed his eyes. Tho­se who we­re watc­hing clo­sely saw the eye-soc­kets of the sub­mis­si­ve Vo­ices se­em to turn ab­ruptly in­to black, empty pits. The­re we­re low cur­ses and gasps of ama­ze­ment from the knights that tra­iled off in­to stun­ned si­len­ce as Oro­gas­tus's eye­lids re­ope­ned to re­ve­al two small stars bla­zing be­ne­ath his dark brows. He lif­ted his hands in­to the air and tur­ned his en­ti­re body abo­ut slowly, ap­pa­rently scan­ning the en­ti­re re­gi­on sur­ro­un­ding the squ­are as well as the overg­rown clus­ter of do­med struc­tu­res on the op­po­si­te si­de of the ca­nal.</p>
   <p>    Then his eyes clo­sed. The two ri­gid acoly­tes ga­ve con­vul­si­ve jerks and gro­aned, and the­ir own eyes rol­led nor­mal­ly in the­ir he­ads aga­in be­fo­re they slum­ped down un­cons­ci­o­us. The fa­ce of the sor­ce­rer al­so re­ga­ined its usu­al as­pect be­fo­re he drew up his sha­do­wing ho­od.</p>
   <p>    "There are ne­arly fo­ur hund­red Nysso­mu con­ce­aled in the bu­il­dings ac­ross the ca­nal," sa­id Oro­gas­tus calmly. "They are watc­hing us, and ha­ve ne­it­her hos­ti­le in­tent nor fe­ar. I re­com­mend that we land and pro­ce­ed with the me­eting. The­re is no dan­ger."</p>
   <p>    Casually, he bent down and to­ok hold of the no­ses of his inert as­so­ci­ates. The two flo­wed to the­ir fe­et as tho­ugh drif­ting up thro­ugh wa­ter and sto­od with he­ads lol­ling, mo­uths open, and eyes still tightly shut. Oro­gas­tus tur­ned and he­aded for Pel­lan's ca­bin, bec­ko­ning, and the se­mi­co­ma­to­se Red Vo­ice and Blue Vo­ice shuf­fled af­ter him.</p>
   <p>    "The two en­sor­cel­led flun­ki­es will re­co­ver af­ter res­ting," Prin­ce An­tar told his awe-struck men curtly. "Now pull yo­ur­sel­ves to­get­her, and for God's sa­ke hold yo­ur shi­elds high and form a de­cent ho­nor gu­ard when we di­sem­bark."</p>
   <p>    The wherry had al­re­ady pul­led up to the lan­ding sta­ge, which was easily lar­ge eno­ugh to ac­com­mo­da­te all fo­ur­te­en of the big flat­bo­ats at on­ce. A few Nysso­mu trud­ged down the steps to help tie up, and Pel­lan ste­ered the le­ading bo­at to the very cen­ter of the sta­irs, cal­led for up-oars, and bro­ught them smartly to dock.</p>
   <p>    Preceded by the Mas­ter-Tra­der, Lord Osor­kon be­aring the La­bor­no­ki ban­ner, and Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil with his fo­ur aides, Prin­ce An­tar marc­hed down the gangp­lank on­to the qu­ay and wa­ited, twenty knights ran­ged be­hind him with shi­elds on the­ir arms and pen­no­ned lan­ces at pa­ra­de rest. The com­mon sol­di­ers and the­ir ser­ge­ants li­ned the ra­ils of the flat­bo­ats, cros­sbows and ot­her we­apons por­ted.</p>
   <p>    "Greetings to the Nysso­mu pe­op­le of Tre­vis­ta!" Mas­ter Ed­zar exc­la­imed so­lemnly, using the ton­gue that all na­ti­ons of the Pe­nin­su­la spo­ke. He re­pe­ated the sa­lu­ta­ti­on in the Nysso­mu lan­gu­age, and con­ti­nu­ed to trans­la­te thro­ug­ho­ut the rest of the spe­ech.</p>
   <p>    "The gre­at na­ti­on of La­bor­nok, which has tra­ded pe­ace­ful­ly with the Nysso­mu pe­op­le of Tre­vis­ta for over fo­ur hund­reds by me­ans of Ru­wen­di­an in­ter­me­di­ari­es, now dec­la­res that its com­mer­ce will be con­duc­ted fre­ely and di­rectly, no lon­ger thro­ugh ve­nal mid­dle­men, and both the Nysso­mu and La­bor­nok will pro­fit by the chan­ge!… Fol­lo­wing many a gra­ve in­sult to La­bor­nok de­li­ve­red by ar­ro­gant and gre­edy Ru­wen­di­an of­fi­ci­als, the pa­ti­en­ce of our gre­at King Volt­rik was stra­ined be­yond en­du­ran­ce… He led a mighty La­bor­no­ki host so­uth­ward and wre­aked just ven­ge­an­ce upon the cra­ven Ru­wen­di­ans, who sur­ren­de­red to him wit­ho­ut con­di­ti­on three days ago… Now Ru­wen­da and La­bor­nok will be uni­ted in­to one gre­at na­ti­on. Tra­de ca­ra­vans will con­ti­nue to co­me to Tre­vis­ta, just as be­fo­re. The Nysso­mu may re­j­o­ice to­get­her with La­bor­nok, sin­ce the lif­ting of the unj­ust bur­den of Ru­wen­di­an ta­xa­ti­on from the­ir com­mer­ci­al in­ter­co­ur­se will al­low both pe­op­les to thri­ve, and pe­ace and pros­pe­rity will pre­va­il amongst all per­sons of go­od will!"</p>
   <p>    The Mas­ter-Tra­der threw his arms open wi­de. Bug­lers on each of the flat­bo­ats bra­yed a fan­fa­re in uni­son. All of the Nysso­mu blin­ked the­ir hu­ge yel­low eyes, but ot­her­wi­se ma­de no mo­ve. Ed­zar cle­ared his thro­at and re­su­med:</p>
   <p>    "Good King Volt­rik sends you his be­lo­ved son Crown Prin­ce An­tar, be­aring the aut­ho­rity of the La­bor­no­ki thro­ne. Over the next few days the Prin­ce will dis­cuss with you the new re­la­ti­ons­hip bet­we­en our pe­op­les, which will be clo­ser and mo­re ami­cab­le than ever be­fo­re!… And now Prin­ce An­tar de­si­res to con­vey his fe­li­ci­ta­ti­ons to the worthy Dis­cer­ner of Tre­vis­ta."</p>
   <p>    The Mas­ter-Tra­der step­ped asi­de and ma­de a de­ep obe­isan­ce to the Prin­ce, who ca­me for­ward. For a mo­ment, the tight lit­tle gro­up of abo­ri­gi­nes at the he­ad of the sta­irs sto­od im­mo­bi­le. Then one of them des­cen­ded and ap­pro­ac­hed An­tar. Her ro­be was of wo­ven dri­ed gras­ses with a de­ep col­lar and cuffs of li­ving sky-blue flo­wers. A wre­ath of si­mi­lar flo­wers crow­ned her he­ad and she car­ri­ed a simp­le gre­en re­ed which she po­in­ted wit­ho­ut ce­re­mony at the dis­con­cer­ted Prin­ce.</p>
   <p>    "Antar of La­bor­nok," she sa­id, using the hu­man lan­gu­age. Her vo­ice was mu­si­cal and far-car­rying. "This one is Fro­lo­tu, cho­sen Dis­cer­ner by our pe­op­le. It is our cus­tom to be stra­ight­for­ward with hu­mans and this one will do you the ho­nor of ad­dres­sing you wit­ho­ut ar­ti­fi­ce. We ha­ve lis­te­ned to yo­ur tra­der's fi­ne spe­ech and scru­ti­ni­zed its con­tent, se­pa­ra­ting truth from fal­se­ho­od. Now this one asks yo­ur per­mis­si­on to qu­es­ti­on you."</p>
   <p>    The re­ed po­in­ted un­wa­ve­ringly at the Prin­ce's he­art and he fo­und that he was swe­ating he­avily in­si­de his hand­so­me su­it of ena­me­led pa­ra­de ar­mor. "You may ask yo­ur qu­es­ti­ons," he sa­id in a low vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    "Does La­bor­nok me­an to do harm to the Nysso­mu?"</p>
   <p>    "I dec­la­re that we will do you no harm."</p>
   <p>    "Will yo­ur tra­ders con­ti­nue to gi­ve us a fa­ir pri­ce for our go­ods?"</p>
   <p>    "I dec­la­re that they will."</p>
   <p>    "What el­se, be­si­des the re­sump­ti­on of tra­de, do you ask of the Tre­vis­ta Nysso­mu?"</p>
   <p>    "We-we wish to ha­ve a small set­tle­ment he­re, as a ba­se for exp­lo­ring the in­te­ri­or of the Mazy Mi­re."</p>
   <p>    "You wish to qu­ar­ter ar­med tro­ops he­re."</p>
   <p>    "Yes. This is my Ro­yal Fat­her's com­mand, so that fu­gi­ti­ve Ru­wen­di­ans who are ene­mi­es of the new re­gi­me may not dis­rupt com­mer­ce."</p>
   <p>    The Dis­cer­ner's enor­mo­us eyes sho­ne with sad­ness, but she con­ti­nu­ed to spe­ak wit­ho­ut emo­ti­on and the re­ed ne­ver tremb­led. "Tho­se that you call yo­ur ene­mi­es ha­ve long be­en our fri­ends. You ha­ve con­qu­ered them by me­ans of black sor­cery and an overw­hel­ming for­ce of arms. You ha­ve cru­el­ly exe­cu­ted the King and Qu­e­en of Ru­wen­da and the­ir nob­le co­hort who­se only fa­ult was de­fen­ding the­ir co­untry aga­inst yo­ur in­va­si­on. You now pur­sue the Three Pe­tals of the Li­ving Tril­li­um, the Prin­ces­ses of Ru­wen­da, and wo­uld put them al­so to de­ath."</p>
   <p>    "Yes," sa­id the Prin­ce. "But the­se hu­man mat­ters ha­ve not­hing to do with you. We do not se­ek yo­ur help in the se­arch for the Prin­ces­ses. If you hin­der us, you may ex­pect our an­ger. If you le­ave be, I tell you that no ci­ti­zen of La­bor­nok will of­fer you harm nor in­sult. We will pay for the ac­com­mo­da­ti­on and pro­vi­si­oning of the gar­ri­son he­re, and re­su­me nor­mal tra­de as so­on as it is pos­sib­le to do so."</p>
   <p>    The Dis­cer­ner sketc­hed a three-lo­bed pat­tern in the air abo­ut the Prin­ce. Then she sto­od si­lent for a mo­ment be­fo­re sa­ying: "Antar of La­bor­nok, you ha­ve spo­ken the truth to this one. The Nysso­mu of Tre­vis­ta ag­ree to re­open the fa­ir and de­al with yo­ur Mas­ter-Tra­ders in our usu­al fas­hi­on. The fa­ir will be held upon anot­her is­land, the lo­ca­ti­on of which will be vo­uch­sa­fed to you in go­od ti­me."</p>
   <p>    "Thank you," sa­id the Prin­ce.</p>
   <p>    "We will per­mit you to set up yo­ur gar­ri­son he­re, in the area of this squ­are, which is cal­led Lu­sa­gi­ra. You may use the bu­il­dings sur­ro­un­ding it as you cho­ose, and a mar­ket will con­ve­ne da­ily abo­ut the fo­un­ta­in whe­re fo­ods­tuf­fs and cer­ta­in ot­her go­ods may be purc­ha­sed from us at just pri­ces."</p>
   <p>    "Again I thank you."</p>
   <p>    The lit­tle be­ing out­li­ned rest­ric­ti­ons that wo­uld be pla­ced upon the gar­ri­son: the sol­di­ers might tra­vel the ca­nals of Tre­vis­ta fre­ely, but we­re for­bid­den to land un­less in­vi­ted by the Nysso­mu. The re­gi­on di­rectly ac­ross the ca­nal from Lu­sa­gi­ra Squ­are, whe­re num­bers of Nysso­mu had ma­de ho­mes among the ru­ins, was comp­le­tely off-li­mits to hu­mans un­less the Dis­cer­ner her­self dec­la­red an ex­cep­ti­on. On the ot­her hand, the lo­cal abo­ri­gi­nes we­re to ha­ve free ac­cess to the squ­are du­ring day­light, alt­ho­ugh the hu­mans co­uld clo­se off the bu­il­dings to them.</p>
   <p>    "All the­se things are ag­re­e­ab­le to us," An­tar sa­id. "And now, sin­ce the sun is sin­king, we ask yo­ur per­mis­si­on to land our men and set up a tem­po­rary en­camp­ment be­fo­re night­fall."</p>
   <p>    "All may di­sem­bark" - Fro­lo­tu swung the re­ed in an arc to the Prin­ce's right, in­di­ca­ting three fi­gu­res still on bo­ard the le­ading flat-bo­at-"except <emphasis>him</emphasis>."</p>
   <p>    Antar and his com­pa­ni­ons tur­ned to see Oro­gas­tus, who sto­od with his Vo­ices ne­ar the mids­hips ca­bin. The sor­ce­rer ga­ve a moc­king bow of ack­now­ledg­ment to the Dis­cer­ner.</p>
   <p>    She con­ti­nu­ed: "He must le­ave this pla­ce to­mor­row, and not re­turn, or el­se everyt­hing that the Nysso­mu ha­ve ag­re­ed to will be vo­ided." Te­ars be­gan to trick­le down her che­eks even tho­ugh her exp­res­si­on was still stony.</p>
   <p>    Antar sig­hed. Mist was ri­sing from the ca­nal and he was wretc­hedly un­com­for­tab­le in the sticky ar­mor and fa­mis­hed as well. "I ag­ree to this al­so, Dis­cer­ner Fro­lo­tu. Is the­re anyt­hing furt­her?"</p>
   <p>    The gre­en re­ed was lo­we­red, and the flo­wer-crow­ned fi­gu­re's aura of po­wer and ir­re­sis­tib­le in­teg­rity se­emed to dra­in away pal­pably, le­aving only a we­eping in­hu­man lit­tle fe­ma­le who­se for­ti­tu­de fi­nal­ly ne­ared the bre­aking po­int. She sa­id:</p>
   <p>    "We ha­ve not­hing el­se to say to each ot­her, Prin­ce. This is a ti­me of mo­ur­ning and all Nysso­mu he­arts are he­avy. Ne­vert­he­less my pe­op­le will bring fresh fru­it and me­at for yo­ur ex­pe­di­ti­on's ref­resh­ment. This is our free gift, to­get­her with the use of the bu­il­dings. Per­haps we will me­et aga­in at the Fe­ast of the Three Mo­ons… if the Lords of the Air grant that we both li­ve so long."</p>
   <p>    She went back up the sta­irs li­ke a per­son ex­ha­us­ted af­ter run­ning a long ra­ce. Then she and the rest of the Nysso­mu wal­ked slowly ac­ross the bro­ad squ­are in­to an overg­rown pas­sa­ge­way bet­we­en two bro­ken bu­il­dings, and di­sap­pe­ared in­to the de­epe­ning sha­dows.</p>
   <p>    Much la­ter that night, when the men we­re qu­ar­te­red in the­ir tents and the camp­fi­res bur­ned low, An­tar ca­me out of his own pa­vi­li­on and wal­ked rest­les­sly along the qu­ay. The night-no­ises we­re lo­ud and ir­ri­ta­ting and no bre­eze mo­ved the hu­mid air. Ac­ross the chan­nel dim lit­tle lights of many dif­fe­rent co­lors bob­bed abo­ut in the Od­dling set­tle­ment. A sickly gre­enish ra­di­an­ce sho­ne from the win­dow of the flat­bo­at ca­bin whe­re Oro­gas­tus and his mi­ni­ons we­re se­qu­es­te­red, and the Prin­ce co­uld he­ar a so­und of chan­ting from the­re, ba­rely audib­le over the din of the noc­tur­nal jung­le cre­atu­res. With a gri­ma­ce, An­tar tur­ned away from that part of the lan­ding and went down the string of de­ser­ted bo­ats to the very last one, whe­re a sing­le sol­di­er sto­od gu­ard on the fo­re­deck with a lan­tern at his fe­et.</p>
   <p>    Identifying him­self, the Prin­ce ca­me abo­ard. "All qu­i­et on the ca­nal, my man?"</p>
   <p>    "Aye, Lord." The fel­low ga­ve a nod to­ward the twink­ling lights on the ot­her si­de of the wa­ter. "The Od­di­es are mo­vin' abo­ut over yon­der. Now and then so­met­hin' or ot­her mo­ves in front of the­ir lights. And so­me big cre­etur with glo­win' eye­bal­ls ca­me swim­min' by a ti­me ago, and ca­ught and ate so­met­hin' that squ­e­aled pi­ti­ful. Ot­her 'n that, all's well."</p>
   <p>    Antar wan­de­red to the bow ra­il and lo­oked ac­ross the black wa­ter. "What think you of the­se Od­dlings? Are they a kind of in­tel­li­gent ani­mal, as our sa­ges ha­ve al­ways ta­ught, or are they true per­sons?"</p>
   <p>    The sol­di­er haw­ked and spat. "By the­ir out­lan­dish lo­oks, I'd jud­ge them cre­eturs. But the slip­pery one that spo­ke got her way with you crafty eno­ugh, Lord."</p>
   <p>    "True," ad­mit­ted the Prin­ce, with a ru­eful chuck­le.</p>
   <p>    "And I ne­ver he­ard of any cre­etur co­uld we­ep for sor­row over de­ad fri­ends."</p>
   <p>    Antar for­bo­re to com­ment on that. "We­re you cho­sen to re­ma­in he­re with the gar­ri­son?"</p>
   <p>    "No. I'll be re­tur­nin' to the Ci­ta­del in the mor­nin' with the wi­zard."</p>
   <p>    "And glad of it?"</p>
   <p>    "I'd be most glad to set my ho­ofi­es on the ro­ad back to De­ror­gu­ila, Lord. I'm a pla­ins­man and I don't much fancy the swamp co­untry, and the­se big old hulks o' de­ad bu­il­dings gi­ve me the qu­ive­rin' cre­eps."</p>
   <p>    Antar la­ug­hed he­ar­tily. "Me, too."</p>
   <p>    He strol­led over to one of the now emp­ti­ed supply wa­gons that the bo­at car­ri­ed. The­re wo­uld be scant ne­ed for whe­eled ve­hic­les at the gar­ri­son. The tho­ro­ugh­fa­res aro­und abo­ut Lu­sa­gi­ra Squ­are de­ad-ended in jung­le not a qu­ar­ter le­ague away. The Prin­ce idly kic­ked one of the wa­gon-whe­els, and then bent down to pluck at a bit of cloth ca­ught on a na­il of the ta­il­ga­te. The fab­ric shim­me­red stran­gely in the lan­tern light.</p>
   <p>    It was a torn pi­ece of ex­pen­si­ve ro­se-co­lo­red silk, so­iled with dri­ed mud. As he stu­di­ed it he felt an eerie con­vic­ti­on in­si­nu­ate it­self in­to his mind: he had se­en - and to­uc­hed - this ma­te­ri­al be­fo­re.</p>
   <p>    Held in his arms a hu­man form clad in it.</p>
   <p>    It was hers, from her dress.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Here</emphasis>? Im­pos­sib­le! The­re was no way that the Prin­cess Ani­gel co­uld ha­ve sec­re­ted her­self on bo­ard the flat­bo­at and da­red to ac­com­pany the ones who had vo­wed to kill her. No way she co­uld ha­ve avo­ided the far­se­e­ing eye of Oro­gas­tus -</p>
   <p>    But the sor­ce­rer had ad­mit­ted that his ma­gic was unab­le to spy out the hi­ding pla­ce of the Prin­ces­ses. She co­uld ha­ve sta­yed con­ce­aled, sin­ce the un­lo­ading of the wa­gons had not be­en comp­le­ted un­til full dark. And then… all eve­ning long, the punts of the lo­cal Od­dlings had shut­tled back and forth ac­ross the ca­nal, brin­ging fo­od and drink to the­ir un­wel­co­me gu­ests.</p>
   <p>    So she co­uld be at lar­ge in Tre­vis­ta, the be­a­uti­ful gol­den-ha­ired yo­ung wo­man who­se very exis­ten­ce thre­ate­ned his fat­her's thro­ne. She co­uld be in the Nysso­mu set­tle­ment ac­ross the wa­ter at this very mo­ment.</p>
   <p>    What in God's na­me was he to do?</p>
   <p>    Antar stra­igh­te­ned. He tuc­ked the scrap of sa­tin away in­to his belt, sa­id go­od­night to the sol­di­er, and wal­ked back up the lan­ding sta­ge. The qu­e­asy gre­en light still sho­ne in the sor­ce­rer's ca­bin, pul­sa­ting rhythmi­cal­ly to the so­und of the chan­ting. The Prin­ce stop­ped, fin­ge­ring the pi­ece of cloth.</p>
   <p>    He sto­oped, pic­ked up a small sto­ne, and knot­ted the sa­tin tightly abo­ut it. Then he flung the lit­tle mis­si­le out in­to midst­re­am with all his strength, and went off to bed.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Kadiya sat up, bits of grass clin­ging to her sticky skin and ha­ir. She was gas­ping as one who had run a pu­nis­hing ra­ce to col­lap­se at the end of it. She lo­oked abo­ut her, sha­ken and da­zed, unab­le for a mo­ment or two to un­ders­tand whe­re she was or what had hap­pe­ned. The­re was the muck-fu­eled warmth of the swamp, small splotc­hes of sun­light on the short lengths of wa­ter she co­uld catch sight of thro­ugh the rank gro­wing brush. In spi­te of the he­at she shi­ve­red and hun­ke­red in upon her­self. <emphasis>It</emphasis> was still the­re -</p>
   <p>    She for­ced her­self to bre­at­he mo­re slowly, to sha­ke out of the da­ze which had held her. What <emphasis>wad</emphasis> it? Not­hing she co­uld set na­me to. Yet she felt as if she we­re held un­der so­me gre­at eye, ent­rap­ped and help­less. She had to try twi­ce be­fo­re she co­uld cro­ak out:</p>
   <p>    "Jagun!"</p>
   <p>    There was a stir not too far away. The Od­dling hun­ter had so bu­ri­ed him­self in the grass of his own nest that his ari­sing ma­de him lo­ok as if he we­re emer­ging from the gro­und it­self.</p>
   <p>    His eyes we­re nar­ro­wed aga­inst the light but his long kni­fe was ba­red in his hand.</p>
   <p>    "Someone" -her vo­ice sho­ok so that she was as­ha­med of her own sta­te and ma­de an ef­fort at cont­rol -"so­me­one is se­eking us."</p>
   <p>    Jagun was on his fe­et, shuf­fling free of the nest grass. His slit­ted nost­rils fla­red as he ra­ised his he­ad to sniff as might a hun­ted ani­mal. Very slowly he pi­vo­ted, tes­ting the air in each di­rec­ti­on. She, too, shif­ted abo­ut. "Far­se­er" they cal­led her be­ca­use of her sharp sight, but now she no­ti­ced not­hing but the swamp as it had al­ways be­en. Yet so­me­how (and this was mo­re alar­ming than any vi­sib­le foe) she was cer­ta­in that the watc­her was not ne­ar them now…</p>
   <p>    Magic? Of what kind? Used by whom?</p>
   <p>    "There is not­hing sa­ve that which is na­tu­ral he­re," Jagun sa­id slowly, and now he was sta­ring at her. "You ha­ve be­en dre­aming, King's Da­ugh­ter. Rest: what gu­ards one can set in the swamp are pre­sent - Not­hing can co­me upon us that I shall not know." He yaw­ned.</p>
   <p>    She sub­si­ded back in­to the roll of grass, her hand clas­ped abo­ut her amu­let. With all her might she lis­te­ned. The­re was plenty of swamp li­fe ab­ro­ad, and no­ne of that se­emed to ha­ve re­ason for fe­ar. She tri­ed to sort out so­und from so­und to iden­tify each. Just as the night swar­med with one set of hun­ters so did ot­hers go abo­ut the­ir work by day.</p>
   <p>    But the one that had so­ught her had pas­sed her by, frust­ra­ted.</p>
   <p>    Softly she spo­ke: "Jagun, I no lon­ger fe­el that so­me­one is se­eking us." She shif­ted her hand so that the amu­let might be wit­hin his ran­ge of vi­si­on. "My tril­li­um-amber has shi­el­ded us -per­haps from the ma­gi­cal Sight of Oro­gas­tus!"</p>
   <p>    Jagun sto­od up, cas­ting the grass asi­de. "Far­se­er, I do not un­ders­tand such as that." He ges­tu­red to the amu­let. "But this I fe­el, we shall not wa­it for night to mo­ve on."</p>
   <p>    "Skritek?" Ka­di­ya lo­oked to­ward tho­se parts of the sur­ro­un­ding swamp she co­uld see from whe­re she now sat. She let the amu­let drop, to swing by its cha­in as she drew her dag­ger.</p>
   <p>    He sho­ok his he­ad. "Skri­tek, I wo­uld know. This - I can only gu­ess."</p>
   <p>    His ve­he­men­ce imp­res­sed her and a fe­eling of help­les­sness was co­ming back.</p>
   <p>    "Orogastus has fol­lo­wers of his own." Jagun was al­re­ady busy tram­ping the soft so­il over the re­ma­ins of the­ir fi­re. "They are cal­led 'Vo­ices,' ha­ving sur­ren­de­red the­ir full will to his so as to be­co­me only ex­ten­si­ons of him­self. It might very well be that he has sent such per­sons to cru­ise the swamp with wha­te­ver ar­med for­ce go­es to se­cu­re Tre­vis­ta-"</p>
   <p>    "And fol­lows me! But what do the­se Vo­ices do, Jagun? Can they so dis­gu­ise them­sel­ves that you who know the swamp well can­not se­arch them out?"</p>
   <p>    "Farseer, do you re­mem­ber how at the last tra­de fa­ir the­re was that one Ust­rel, of whom pe­op­le as­ked qu­es­ti­ons con­cer­ning things which tro­ub­led them?"</p>
   <p>    Yes, cer­ta­inly she re­cal­led the old wo­man who was so la­med that she ne­eded two staffs to aid her in wal­king. And Ka­di­ya had watc­hed her squ­at be­fo­re a wi­de, curl-edged dro­go le­af in­to which she had sha­ken so­me drops of wa­ter. The­re had be­en anot­her fe­ma­le Od­dling cro­uc­hing on the ot­her si­de of that le­af, wa­iting ten­sely to he­ar the mut­te­ring of the an­ci­ent se­eress, but the di­alect the lat­ter used had be­en one Ka­di­ya did not know.</p>
   <p>    "You sa­id she co­uld re­ad fa­te in the wa­ter drops," Ka­di­ya sa­id now, "but su­rely that was me­rely a pi­ece of tric­kery. Such is im­pos­sib­le - "</p>
   <p>    "Not qu­ite, Far­se­er. Each of us dif­fers one from the ot­her, not only as to our bo­di­es but al­so our minds, in what we are ab­le to le­arn easily and what we can­not grasp wit­ho­ut gre­at la­bor, if at all. Are you li­ke un­to eit­her of yo­ur sis­ters, King's Da­ugh­ter? I am a hun­ter of be­asts, a tra­iner of such upon oc­ca­si­on. This is my ta­lent. I do not set car­ven wo­od pi­eces cun­ningly to­get­her, nor do I brew herbs, nor work with the gle­anings from ru­ins. Tho­se are ot­her crafts and arts.</p>
   <p>    "Thus it is al­so with crafts of the mind. Yes, the­re are tho­se who can cast the­ir Sight dis­tant, and they can re­ad, if fle­etingly and fal­te­ringly, what hap­pens to anot­her far away. Ust­rel can­not al­ways do it, and sel­dom very cle­arly. But the­re ha­ve be­en ti­mes when she has fo­re­se­en the truth and had her far­se­e­ing pro­ven so. Oro­gas­tus is a man of gre­at know­led­ge, most of it un­me­asu­red by any of us. If his Vo­ices are well ta­ught and they be­gin with so­me ta­lent, then it co­uld be that he uses them to ex­tend his own sen­ses."</p>
   <p>    "Then they are se­arc­hing for us and will con­ti­nue to do so! What is yo­ur craft of wa­ter-tra­iling aga­inst that?" Ka­di­ya shi­ve­red. Ste­el aga­inst ste­el she co­uld un­ders­tand, even the cru­el­ti­es of the in­va­ders; but that they co­uld com­mand such po­wers was da­un­ting in­de­ed.</p>
   <p>    Jagun sho­ok his he­ad slowly. "It is not an easy thing to do and it ta­kes ti­me and pre­pa­ra­ti­on. Al­so it is ex­ha­us­ting for the se­er. It may be that the­re is a Vo­ice with a se­arch parry on the ri­ver be­hind us. But the mo­re dis­tan­ce we put bet­we­en us and the Ci­ta­del, the less easy we shall be to find."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya crad­led the glo­wing am­ber amu­let in her hand. "Do­es ma­gic call to ma­gic?" Al­most she was re­ady to drop what might be such an ill-ome­ned thing in­to the wa­ter.</p>
   <p>    "Farseer, yo­ur amu­let is of the Light, the Arc­hi­ma­ge's own gift. I do not be­li­eve that it wo­uld play you fal­se. Ho­we­ver, I wo­uld be away from he­re. We must ta­ke a ro­ute which go­es aro­und Tre­vis­ta. The La­bor­no­ki will ke­ep to the ri­ver. Ne­it­her Pel­lan, nor the Skri­tek, if they ha­ve such with them, know this Black­mi­re co­untry away from the ma­j­or tra­ils."</p>
   <p>    Though she had be­en to Tre­vis­ta se­ve­ral ti­mes and pri­ded her­self on an ex­cel­lent me­mory for land­marks, Ka­di­ya was to­tal­ly be­wil­de­red as Jagun's punt car­ri­ed them on thro­ugh twis­ting wa­ter­ways whi­le the af­ter­no­on wa­ned. They skir­ted an is­let whe­re bro­ken walls thrust up from the un­derg­rowth, pla­inly one of the ru­in si­tes. The swamp ve­ge­ta­ti­on he­re con­sis­ted of banks of re­eds and to­ugh grass, fleshy stem­med vi­nes, and lo­oming tre­es. The­re we­re a few spots of co­lor, puff-pe­ta­led flo­wers which had a most unp­le­asant lo­ok and which Ka­di­ya re­cog­ni­zed as the ba­it for plants which fed upon un­wary in­sects.</p>
   <p>    The spark in the amu­let con­ti­nu­ed to glow, le­ading them on. They did not stop for fo­od but che­wed on the tu­bers, and so­me­ti­mes ate fru­it that Jagun pic­ked. Out of the night ro­se mo­re is­les crow­ned by ru­ins, and aro­und them dan­ced po­ints of filmy light born of the marsh­lands.</p>
   <p>    The grey of dawn was sho­wing aga­in when they swung asi­de to sli­de thro­ugh an in­let Ka­di­ya wo­uld ha­ve tho­ught too nar­row to al­low them pas­sa­ge, in­to an open spa­ce which lo­oked mo­re po­ol than ri­ver. Ka­di­ya's legs we­re cram­ped and she won­de­red if she co­uld stand erect. Jagun was al­so ti­ring. He scul­led the punt slowly along the ed­ge of the po­ol to whe­re a tree, its ro­ots un­der­cut du­ring one of the mon­so­on flo­ods, thrust out from the bank. On the ot­her si­de sto­nes sto­od abo­ve the wa­ter for­ming a li­ne that led back in­to the jung­le-li­ke tang­le be­yond.</p>
   <p>    When they we­re as­ho­re Jagun pul­led the punt clo­ser to the tre­es and dra­ped over it so­me bunc­hes of re­eds. Ka­di­ya's legs and back we­re very pa­in­ful, but she sto­oped and ca­ught up the lar­ger of the two hun­ters' bags. If she we­re so worn out, how must Jagun fe­el?</p>
   <p>    He ma­de no mo­ve to chop a way for them with his kni­fe, but ins­te­ad tur­ned and twis­ted to avo­id the thic­kest of the ve­ge­ta­ti­on. In­sects aro­se abo­ut them in a clo­ud, and then Jagun did chop fi­er­cely down­ward. Bet­we­en him and Ka­di­ya the­re lay a thick obj­ect that might ha­ve be­en a vi­ne; but it had no le­aves and it thres­hed back and forth, whi­le from the se­ve­red end drip­ped a yel­lo­wish stuff with the un­he­althy lo­ok of disc­har­ge from an in­fec­ted wo­und. The­re aro­se on the air a swe­etish odor of put­rid de­cay. A tang­le-fo­ot! The ot­her end had snap­ped back in­to a dusky ca­vern of thick growth, and Ka­di­ya to­ok a wi­de stri­de to avo­id the car­ni­vo­ro­us plant that had co­me se­eking them.</p>
   <p>    Although the bus­hes grew high he­re, the tre­es had thin­ned out. Ka­di­ya and Jagun ca­me in­to the light of mor­ning in a pla­ce whe­re sto­od the re­ma­ins of a num­ber of shat­te­red pil­lars set in a circ­le upon a pa­ve­ment of dull black-grey sto­ne. Ka­di­ya ut­te­red an exc­la­ma­ti­on. The open patch was de­ser­ted, but in the very mid­dle smo­ul­de­red a fi­re, and a wan­de­ring bre­eze bro­ught from it a stench as well as puffs of gre­asy smo­ke. The­re had fal­len ac­ross the pi­eces of fi­re­wo­od a thic­ker and lon­ger po­le now char­red ne­arly thro­ugh in the mid­dle. Ho­we­ver, it was what was mo­un­ted on the end po­in­ting to­ward the new­co­mers that bro­ught a gasp from Ka­di­ya.</p>
   <p>    Fastened to the blac­ke­ned and scorc­hed wo­od was a skull.</p>
   <p>    "Jagun!"</p>
   <p>    His hand went up in a ges­tu­re of com­mand as he le­aned for­ward to ins­pect it mo­re clo­sely. The bo­ne was yel­lo­wed and sme­ared with sli­me, crac­ked as if it had be­en drag­ged thro­ugh so­me of the most muck-fil­led ways of the Mi­re.</p>
   <p>    "Skritek!" the hun­ter bre­at­hed.</p>
   <p>    The swamp was dank and warm even tho­ugh the sun was not fully up, but in that mo­ment Ka­di­ya felt a chill which ro­ug­he­ned her skin as if she sto­od full fa­ce to a storm wind.</p>
   <p>    "A warn." Jagun wal­ked aro­und the fi­re as he might aro­und a trap. "But he­re?"</p>
   <p>    Kadiya lo­oked abo­ut her une­asily. "Do the Skri­tek co­me so clo­se then to Tre­vis­ta or - she drew a de­ep bre­ath - do they war he­re?"</p>
   <p>    It se­emed as if Jagun had not he­ard her. He po­un­ced sud­denly and pic­ked up what lo­oked to be a bra­ided fi­ber string, the kind used to la­ce on wa­ter-skim­mers. Ta­king go­od hold of eit­her end he snap­ped it ta­ut.</p>
   <p>    "Uisgu!" He threw back his he­ad, and from de­ep in his thro­at so­un­ded the call of qu­es­ting ma­de by the ar­mo­red ho­riks which la­ired on such is­lets. Three ti­mes he cal­led so, and then ad­ded, af­ter a mo­ment of si­len­ce, anot­her tril­ling so­und, high and thin, which Ka­di­ya had ne­ver he­ard be­fo­re.</p>
   <p>    Slowly he pi­vo­ted whe­re he sto­od, his body ten­se as if every cell of it was now en­ga­ged in lis­te­ning for an ans­wer.</p>
   <p>    It ca­me in a sing­le ho­rik's call. Then out of the thick brush sur­ro­un­ding the circ­le of pil­lars the­re craw­led anot­her Od­dling. Un­li­ke Jagun he did not we­ar the fi­nely wo­ven clot­hing of the Nysso­mu, only a short, kilt-li­ke gar­ment of gol­den yel­low with a fe­at­hery ed­ging of grass he­ads. A kni­fe hilt, cord-wrap­ped in red, sho­wed abo­ve the belt which sup­por­ted his kilt. He held a blow­pi­pe in one hand.</p>
   <p>    Around his prot­ru­ding eyes had be­en pa­in­ted rings of red-brown which en­lar­ged the eyes them­sel­ves, and on his fur­red chest we­re three circ­les in­ter­loc­ked at a cen­ter po­int.</p>
   <p>    He lo­oked at Ka­di­ya and mo­ved away from her to­ward the hun­ter. When he spo­ke, his words we­re stran­gely ac­cen­ted so that she, used only to the Nysso­mu tra­de talk and so­me phra­ses of ce­re­mony Jagun had ca­re­ful­ly ta­ught her, co­uld only ma­ke out one word in three or fo­ur.</p>
   <p>    " - co­me - set po­le - kill Un­vis - kill." With that word he held up his blow­pi­pe and sho­ok it fi­er­cely. "Tho­se ot­hers - " Then he la­unc­hed in­to an im­pas­si­oned spe­ech which Ka­di­ya co­uld not fol­low at all. When he was do­ne he sto­od pan­ting and the­re we­re flecks of spit­tle at the cor­ners of his wi­de mo­uth.</p>
   <p>    Jagun lo­oked to Ka­di­ya. "Yes­ter­day the Skri­tek we­re he­re. They cap­tu­red one of Usos's clan whom they bro­ught he­re. Then they set up one of the­ir bo­un­dary po­les, sla­ying the clan sis­ter to se­al what they did in blo­od."</p>
   <p>    Jagun tur­ned back to the Uis­gu and spo­ke aga­in. The ot­her rep­li­ed in very li­mi­ted words.</p>
   <p>    "They went on - to­ward Tre­vis­ta," Jagun sa­id. "I ha­ve told Usos of the tro­ub­le which fa­ces us all now. He and his clan tra­ders we­re go­ing to Tre­vis­ta with so­me finds. They will spre­ad the war­ning as they now re­turn."</p>
   <p>    The Uis­gu then di­sap­pe­ared so qu­ickly that Ka­di­ya sto­od blin­king. "Co­uld we not go with them?"</p>
   <p>    Jagun ga­ve a small grim so­und which might ha­ve be­en a la­ugh. "The Uis­gu tra­vel with no­ne but the­ir kin, Far­se­er. It has al­ways be­en so. Of the sa­me blo­od we are." He nod­ded. "But to them we are very far kin in­de­ed. Ne­ver ha­ve we car­ri­ed war to them, or they to us. Long ago, in the very be­gin­ning, when the Va­nis­hed Ones ru­led, it was set so. We are Nysso­mu and they are Uis­gu and so it has al­ways be­en. Usos will ta­ke my war­ning, but he wo­uld not al­low our com­pany."</p>
   <p>    "And yet you are not ene­mi­es," Ka­di­ya mu­sed.</p>
   <p>    "King's Da­ugh­ter, in the old days, we of the Nysso­mu we­re, so our le­gends tell us, spe­akers for the Va­nis­hed Ones. Now we are ser­vants of the Lady of Noth, who com­man­ded us to bef­ri­end the hu­mans who ca­me to li­ve in the Mazy Mi­re. But the Uis­gu ha­ve al­ways fe­ared yo­ur pe­op­le. Only a few very da­ring clans­men will tra­de with us, that we may in turn tra­de with you."</p>
   <p>    "They will dis­co­ver that the La­bor­no­ki are not of our kind," Ka­di­ya bro­ke out. "Jagun, I be­li­eve that Volt­rik will try to set his he­el as firmly upon the Mi­res as he has upon the Ci­ta­del. Can the Uis­gu hi­de so well that the Skri­tek can­not sniff them out?"</p>
   <p>    Jagun shrug­ged. "Far­se­er, who can say? But now we must rest, and sin­ce this is a pla­ce de­fi­led we must se­arch out anot­her camp."</p>
   <p>    That they did, fart­her along the sho­re of the po­ol. The­re we­re no re­ma­ins of the Va­nis­hed Ones he­re and Jagun sa­id they must sha­re sentry du­ti­es. Ka­di­ya in­sis­ted that she ta­ke the first watch sin­ce the hun­ter had had the we­aring la­bor of brin­ging the punt in­to this hid­den har­bor.</p>
   <p>    Jagun im­me­di­ately cur­led up on a small mo­und of le­aves he ra­ked to­get­her and fell as­le­ep. But Ka­di­ya sat cross-leg­ged, set­ting her­self grimly to the task of watc­hing. Tho­ugh she lac­ked most of the ke­en sen­ses the Od­dlings pos­ses­sed, be­ing unab­le to pick out of the air scents which we­re over­bor­ne by the usu­al swamp odors, and she co­uld not wit­ho­ut dif­fi­culty na­me the so­unds, still she was so­mew­hat swamp-wi­se.</p>
   <p>    Several ti­mes she aro­se to her fe­et to prowl aro­und the camp­si­te. She scratc­hed at her scalp, over­la­den with the in­sect re­pel­ling gre­ase, and tri­ed to comb her fin­gers thro­ugh her badly tang­led ha­ir. At this mo­ment she co­uld well envy the Nysso­mu the­ir ge­ne­ral ha­ir­les­sness and the Uis­gu the­ir sle­ek co­ve­ring of fur.</p>
   <p>    On her se­cond ro­und of the camp she ca­ught sight of a brigh­ter gre­en down be­ne­ath one of the bus­hes, and in a mo­ment had in her hand a sto­ut-ro­oted plant she did know. A scramb­le of pul­ling bro­ught out fi­ve mo­re and she cle­aned and di­vi­ded the­ir ro­ots ca­re­ful­ly, pla­cing half of them asi­de for Jagun. Then she be­gan to eat. Un­li­ke the wo­ody tu­bers of the­ir spar­se ra­ti­ons, the­se we­re full of ju­ice and had a cle­an, pun­gent tas­te. They we­re cal­led ma­fun, and they had even ap­pe­ared on the tab­le at the Ci­ta­del, whe­re they we­re es­te­emed as a de­li­cacy, alt­ho­ugh they co­uld not be rep­lan­ted from the wild in­to any pol­der fi­eld.</p>
   <p>    As she che­wed, Ka­di­ya tho­ught of the Va­nis­hed Ones. She had he­ard, ever sin­ce she co­uld re­mem­ber, de­ba­tes and gu­es­ses con­cer­ning them. They we­re sup­po­sed to ha­ve ru­led this land co­unt­less ages ago. That they had had vast po­wers all thin­king men ad­mit­ted. Po­wers? She swal­lo­wed the last of the swe­et pulp in her mo­uth. Ma­gic was po­wer! Was the Arc­hi­ma­ge re­al­ly one of the Va­nis­hed Ones? Had she li­ved many hund­reds, watc­hing her land chan­ge, Noth slowly ero­ding abo­ut her? And who was Oro­gas­tus? Had he so­me con­nec­ti­on to the Va­nis­hed Ones as well?</p>
   <p>    Kadiya be­gan to won­der how lar­ge was this world of hers. What lay be­yond the Pe­nin­su­la? The La­bor­no­ki pla­ins in the north led to the sea, and to the so­uth we­re the vast wo­od­lands of Var; but few ot­her co­unt­ri­es had she stu­di­ed, and now she en­vi­ed Ha­ra­mis, who had spent ti­me in the Ci­ta­del lib­rary whi­le she, Ka­di­ya, scor­ned bo­oks in fa­vor of an ac­ti­ve, out­do­or li­fe.</p>
   <p>    Had the Va­nis­hed Ones me­rely withd­rawn from Ru­wen­da, to re­es­tab­lish the­ir ru­le el­sew­he­re? Oro­gas­tus was sa­id to ha­ve co­me from a dis­tant land, bro­ught back by Volt­rik du­ring his wa­iting ye­ars. Might the sor­ce­rer al­so be a Va­nis­hed One? The­re was not­hing, ho­we­ver, eit­her in le­gends or in the bits of in­for­ma­ti­on she had pic­ked up from the Od­dlings, to sug­gest that the Va­nis­hed Ones had be­en wor­kers of evil. Cer­ta­inly the Arc­hi­ma­ge had ne­ver tri­ed to do­mi­na­te eit­her the Od­dlings or the Ru­wen­di­ans.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya lif­ted her tril­li­um-amber amu­let. Its glow was ste­ady, re­as­su­ring, per­haps even pro­tec­ti­ve. And its spark still fa­ith­ful­ly po­in­ted the way to Noth… whe­re per­haps her qu­es­ti­ons wo­uld be ans­we­red.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    The Black Tril­li­um se­eds led Ha­ra­mis and the mu­si­ci­an Uzun on and on over the high­land bogs of the Oho­gan fo­ot­hil­ls. The se­eds did not flo­at too fast for them to fol­low. If eit­her of them stumb­led, or be­ca­me mo­men­ta­rily en­mi­red, or even had to stop for so­me ne­ces­sary re­ason, the se­ed-of-the-day wo­uld wa­it -appa­rently be­cal­med by a di­mi­nis­hing of the wind, or ca­ught upon so­me obst­ruc­ti­on - only to fly free aga­in when they we­re in a po­si­ti­on to march on. It al­so de­ter­mi­ned when and whe­re they wo­uld stop at night, drop­ping to earth each eve­ning in what Ha­ra­mis sup­po­sed it con­si­de­red a su­itab­le camp­si­te. <emphasis>Or per­haps</emphasis>, she tho­ught, <emphasis>the se­eds are cho­osing pla­ces for them­sel­ves to grow. If I sur­vi­ve, and re­turn he­re next ye­ar, will I find tril­lim plants, spa­ced a day?s march apart along the­ir ro­ute</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    But the se­eds wo­uld not let her dawd­le, eit­her, and af­ter se­ve­ral days' jo­ur­ne­ying west­ward over the he­ath, Ha­ra­mis was be­gin­ning al­most to de­test the fluffy flying things. The­re we­re ti­mes when a stran­ge plant or an int­ri­gu­ing, un­fa­mi­li­ar cre­atu­re ca­ught her eye and she wo­uld ha­ve li­ked to pa­use and study them; but the se­ed-of-the-day wo­uld sa­il on, and she and Uzun wo­uld be const­ra­ined to fol­low.</p>
   <p>    Once, on the­ir se­cond day out from Noth, she had da­red to defy the ma­gi­cal gu­ide. The tra­il that they fol­lo­wed thro­ugh the high bog­land led them past a patch of the lar­gest, most ju­icy, most swe­etly fer­men­ted clo­ud­ber­ri­es that Ha­ra­mis had ever tas­ted in her li­fe, and she in­sis­ted upon ig­no­ring the se­ed-gu­ide and stop­ping to fe­ast upon them. The se­ed had flo­ated on out of sight. But when Ha­ra­mis pluc­ked anot­her from the pod and cast it free to gu­ide them, it drif­ted to the gro­und and re­fu­sed to fly even when she bre­at­hed upon it.</p>
   <p>    In a pa­nic, she tri­ed anot­her se­ed. This one to­ok off with such ce­le­rity that she al­most had to run to ke­ep up with it, and po­or old Uzun stag­ge­red and tot­te­red and mo­aned fol­lo­wing af­ter. Alt­ho­ugh he spo­ke no word of re­bu­ke, Ha­ra­mis knew full well that she was to bla­me for his mi­sery.</p>
   <p>    She to­ok hold of her amu­let and whis­pe­red with bre­ath­less as­pe­rity: "I was wrong! I sho­uld not ha­ve ig­no­red the se­ed! Ha­ve pity upon Uzun, if not upon me! Slow down! Ple­ase!"</p>
   <p>    And the se­ed did, adj­us­ting its flight at on­ce to a mo­re com­for­tab­le pa­ce.</p>
   <p>    But Ha­ra­mis re­ma­ined re­sent­ful. Co­uld not the Arc­hi­ma­ge ha­ve gi­ven her a mo­re se­emly way of pur­su­ing this qu­est? Was she a ba­be or a dim-wit­ted ani­mal, ne­eding to be hur­ri­ed on in such an inf­le­xib­le man­ner? The qu­ests she had re­ad of in le­gends we­re car­ri­ed out in an at­mosp­he­re of dig­nity and no­bi­lity. But she, it se­emed, wo­uld ful­fill her gre­at des­tiny trud­ging up hill and down va­le af­ter a silly bit of fluff, gar­ne­ring blis­ters on her bog-so­aked fe­et, gnat-bi­tes on her neck, and an inc­re­asing dis­tas­te for the who­le­so­me but bo­ring ra­ti­ons the Arc­hi­ma­ge had se­en fit to inc­lu­de in the­ir packs.</p>
   <p>    The fo­od was not over la­vish in qu­an­tity, eit­her.</p>
   <p>    On the­ir fifth day of tra­vel, when they re­ac­hed a lar­ge ri­ver that Uzun tho­ught might be the Up­per Vis­par, it oc­cur­red to Ha­ra­mis for the first ti­me that they wo­uld so­on run out of pro­vi­si­ons if they con­ti­nu­ed to gob­ble them he­ed­les­sly. The co­untry­si­de lo­oked comp­le­tely de­ser­ted, and Uzun se­emed to think that ne­it­her his own Nysso­mu tri­be nor the Uis­gu wo­uld li­ve so far north, be­yond the bor­ders of the Mazy Mi­re. The pi­ed­mont was a no-man's-land, se­pa­ra­ting the swamp from the mo­un­ta­in ter­ri­tory of the Vis­pi.</p>
   <p>    Haramis sat on a rock over­lo­oking the rus­hing tor­rent. It was ne­arly sun­down, and the se­ed they had fol­lo­wed that day had fal­len, sig­na­ling that the two might ma­ke camp. Uzun was gat­he­ring fi­re­wo­od and get­ting re­ady to pre­pa­re the­ir me­al, a task which he un­der­to­ok each eve­ning and mor­ning, in­sis­ting upon ser­ving the Prin­cess with as much de­fe­ren­ce as tho­ugh she we­re still at ho­me in the Ci­ta­del.</p>
   <p>    "Uzun," she cal­led, and the lit­tle mu­si­ci­an hur­ri­ed to her, smi­ling. "Do you think the­re wo­uld be fish in this ri­ver?"</p>
   <p>    "I sho­uld cer­ta­inly think so, my Prin­cess. Gar­su for su­re, and do­ubt­less ot­her kinds that I know not the na­mes of."</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ve fo­und in my pack so­me string and three ho­oks. Wo­uld you ta­ke them and catch me a ni­ce fish for sup­per? I am so we­ari­ed of the me­al­ca­kes and dri­ed me­at. Be­si­des, our sup­pli­es of fo­od are dwind­ling, and I do­ubt we can co­unt on fin­ding any Folk in this god­for­sa­ken re­gi­on to gi­ve us mo­re."</p>
   <p>    Uzun's fa­ce fell. "But it lacks only an ho­ur or so un­til night­fall, Prin­cess. If I spend the ti­me fis­hing, how will I ha­ve ti­me to fetch wo­od or co­ok?" He grin­ned apo­lo­ge­ti­cal­ly. "And I am lo­ath to con­fess it, but I ha­ve ne­ver fis­hed in my li­fe, and wo­uld pro­bably ma­ke a botch of it."</p>
   <p>    Haramis la­ug­hed. "How dif­fi­cult can it be, if even the lit­tle child­ren of the Ci­ta­del fre­ehol­ders do it? I ha­ve a won­der­ful idea! I shall fish, and ins­te­ad of co­oking our dre­ary ra­ti­ons, you shall gat­her ber­ri­es, and so­me of that ni­ce-lo­oking bit­terc­ress that we spi­ed gro­wing be­si­de the bog-po­ol a short way back along the tra­il. And if you cast abo­ut, the­re are cer­ta­in to be mush­ro­oms - and we shall fe­ast to­night!"</p>
   <p>    As al­ways, Uzun ag­re­ed to her de­mands. Af­ter bu­il­ding a go­od wo­od­pi­le, he trot­ted off to se­cu­re the ot­her edib­les, le­aving Ha­ra­mis alo­ne.</p>
   <p>    Fishing was easy, the Prin­cess told her­self. One got a po­le, and ti­ed to it a li­ne, and on the end of that the ho­ok, and on the ho­ok so­me ba­it-</p>
   <p>    Ooh. The ba­it must ne­eds be im­pa­led. And whe­re did one find ba­it, any­how?</p>
   <p>    She po­ked abo­ut among the drift­wo­od on the ri­ver­bank and fo­und a most sa­tis­fac­tory po­le, and be­ne­ath a rot­ten log ca­me upon so­me wrig­gling grubs that glo­wed dimly in the ad­van­cing twi­light. Ste­eling her­self (she did retch on­ce, but for­tu­na­tely Uzun was too far away to he­ar), she ma­na­ged to thre­ad one of the vi­le lit­tle cre­atu­res on­to the ho­ok, af­ter two we­re crus­hed in her tremb­ling fin­gers.</p>
   <p>    Then she cle­aned off her bes­li­med hands, fo­und a spot whe­re the ri­ver ran de­ep, and cast her lu­re. Li­ne and ba­it drif­ted swiftly downst­re­am in­to a pot­her of whi­te­wa­ter and rocks, and Ha­ra­mis ha­uled it back to the po­ol, only to see it flo­at away aga­in.</p>
   <p>    Very well. The prob­lem was one any in­tel­li­gent per­son co­uld sol­ve.</p>
   <p>    And co­me to think of it, she did re­call the fre­ehol­der urc­hins using flo­ats and we­ights to cont­rol the pla­ce­ment of the lu­re.</p>
   <p>    She pul­led the li­ne in. Of co­ur­se the wretc­hed grub was go­ne and anot­her had to be put on. Just abo­ve the ho­ok, she ti­ed a small rock, and an ell or so abo­ve this on the li­ne, ti­ed a pi­ece of dry wo­od for a flo­at. When she mo­ved to a bet­ter po­si­ti­on and cast this rig in­to the wa­ter, it lan­ded most sa­tis­fac­to­rily in the po­ol and sta­yed the­re. Ha­ra­mis sig­hed, sat down on the bank, and wa­ited.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>I will ha­ve to do this from now on</emphasis>, she tho­ught. <emphasis>I ha­ve be­en a per­fect dolt, al­lo­wing po­or Uzun to wa­it upon me hand and fo­ot, as tho­ugh we we­re on a pic­nic in the Ci­ta­del me­adows. It is qu­ite evi­dent that we shall ha­ve to li­ve off the land from now on and con­ser­ve what few tra­ve­ling ra­ti­ons re­ma­in for emer­gen­ci­es. The Lords of the Air only know how long this qu­est will last</emphasis>-<emphasis>or whe­re it will ta­ke us</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    Haramis let her eyes mo­ve upst­re­am, over the he­ath with its spar­se tre­es and he­avy brush. The tiny tra­il tur­ned he­re at the ri­ver and con­ti­nu­ed north­ward along the bank. Be­yond a do­ubt the imp­la­cab­le se­eds wo­uld fol­low it, ta­king them in­to the mo­un­ta­ins.</p>
   <p>    The mo­un­ta­ins…</p>
   <p>    They lo­omed be­yond the dark fo­ot­hil­ls, snow-crow­ned and ter­rib­le, the land of the myste­ri­o­us Vis­pi. Was her ta­lis­man hid­den up the­re? If it was, how co­uld two in­no­cents in the wilds such as she and Uzun ho­pe to find it? To say not­hing of re­tur­ning with it to Noth, as the Whi­te Lady had com­man­ded.</p>
   <p>    The Whi­te Lady, who was sick, dying, pos­sibly even de­ran­ged.</p>
   <p>    All they co­uld do was fol­low the se­eds - or­di­nary tiny brown things, each with a tuft of whi­te silky thre­ads, se­eming to ha­ve not­hing of ma­gic abo­ut them at all, ex­cept the pur­po­se­ful na­tu­re of the­ir co­ur­se thro­ugh the air.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>She gi­ves them im­pe­tus</emphasis>, Ha­ra­mis tho­ught. <emphasis>She knows whe­re we are, and whe­re we must go, and she dri­ves the se­eds on­ward whi­le, we fol­low. And she did not tell me whe­re I must go, be­ca­use she knew I wo­uld then be too frigh­te­ned and dis­he­ar­te­ned even to be­gin the jo­ur­ney</emphasis>…</p>
   <p>    "Princess! I ha­ve bro­ught ber­ri­es and cress and a plet­ho­ra of most de­li­ci­o­us-lo­oking mush­ro­oms-"</p>
   <p>    Haramis star­ted in surp­ri­se. Lost in her tho­ughts, she had not he­ard Uzun ap­pro­ach. Then the fish­po­le ga­ve a gre­at jerk and ne­arly le­apt from her hands. She got a grip on it, and so­met­hing pul­led so strongly that she was drag­ged to the lip of the ri­ver­bank.</p>
   <p>    She cri­ed: "Uzun! Help me! A fish!" And then so­met­hing gre­en and sil­ver sprang from the wa­ter, and fell back in with a gre­at splash. The Od­dling mu­si­ci­an drop­ped his gle­anings and ca­me run­ning to help, gab­bling with ex­ci­te­ment. The two of them wrest­led and shri­eked and al­most drop­ped the po­le, whi­le the fish fo­ught so strongly that they we­re ne­arly re­ady to sur­ren­der.</p>
   <p>    But Ha­ra­mis yel­led: "No! You shall not get away, you are our din­ner!" And with that, the cre­atu­re's strug­glings ce­ased, and they drew it on­to sho­re. It was a shi­ning gar­su as long as Ha­ra­mis's leg.</p>
   <p>    "Perhaps you did not ne­ed the ho­ok, Prin­cess," Uzun te­ased, "if you can com­mand din­ner from the wa­ter."</p>
   <p>    "I ho­pe it was me­rely co­in­ci­den­ce," Ha­ra­mis la­ug­hed. "I sho­uld ha­te to think that our din­ner was an in­tel­li­gent cre­atu­re ca­pab­le of un­ders­tan­ding hu­man spe­ech -or, wor­se yet, an enc­han­ted prin­ce!"</p>
   <p>    "Like in the old bal­lads?" Uzun sa­id. "I sho­uldn't think it li­kely. It's a per­fectly or­di­nary gar­su, and it will be de­li­ci­o­us -and the­re will be plenty left for bre­ak­fast and lunch al­so. Oh, well do­ne, my Prin­cess. Well do­ne!"</p>
   <p>    They grin­ned at one anot­her. And then Ha­ra­mis sta­red at the big fish, and her joy tur­ned to dis­com­fi­tu­re, and she sa­id: "Uzun? Do - do you know what must be do­ne next? To - pre­pa­re it?"</p>
   <p>    Stricken, with mo­uth aga­pe, Uzun sho­ok his he­ad.</p>
   <p>    Haramis sig­hed. "Ne­ver mind. Tri­al and er­ror is sup­po­sed to be an ef­fec­ti­ve met­hod of le­ar­ning."</p>
   <p>    Uzun lo­oked du­bi­o­us. "Pra­ying for di­vi­ne ins­pi­ra­ti­on co­uldn't hurt eit­her."</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Anigel had an ext­ra­or­di­nary dre­am, and in it so­met­hing hap­pe­ned that had ne­ver hap­pe­ned in all the his­tory of Pe­nin­su­lar hu­man­kind: the Ra­ins did not co­me.</p>
   <p>    Instead of the fa­mi­li­ar storms that rol­led up from the So­ut­hern Sea and drenc­hed Zi­no­ra and Var and Ru­wen­da and La­bor­nok and Rak­tum and the Is­lands of En­gi for two se­asons each ye­ar, the­re we­re unen­ding months when the sun gla­red down from a clo­ud­less sky and a hot wind blew day and night, scorc­hing the small na­ti­ons with its pi­ti­less, de­adly blast. The en­ti­re Pe­nin­su­la was de­vas­ta­ted; but Ru­wen­da, ha­ving no se­aco­ast, suf­fe­red most of all.</p>
   <p>    From her bed­ro­om win­dow in the Ci­ta­del she watc­hed the mighty Mu­tar dwind­le to a trick­le, and li­ke­wi­se the Skro­kar Ri­ver, the Vir­kar, and the Bo­no­rar. And this ca­used La­ke Wum, which the ri­vers fed, to dry up comp­le­tely, so that the­re was no way to flo­at the hu­ge logs from the Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest to the tim­ber yards. Ri­ver com­mer­ce be­ca­me im­pos­sib­le; the Dylex farms we­re dro­ught-stri­ken; and monst­ro­us star­ving Skri­tek ram­pa­ged from one end of Ru­wen­da to the ot­her.</p>
   <p>    Her pa­rents King Kra­in and Qu­e­en Ka­lant­he ca­me to her, to­get­her with the ru­lers of the ot­her fi­ve na­ti­ons, and beg­ged her to do so­met­hing to bring back the Ra­ins. She told them she did not know how, and they went away in des­pa­ir.</p>
   <p>    In the dre­am her sis­ter Ka­di­ya ca­me to tell her that the muck so­il of the Ru­wen­da wet­lands had all dri­ed out. Flo­we­ring plants and gras­ses tur­ned se­re and bo­re ne­it­her blos­som nor fru­it. Ju­icy fun­gi wit­he­red, nut­ri­ti­o­us gre­en lic­hens shri­ve­led away, and jung­le tre­es drop­ped the­ir le­aves.</p>
   <p>    "Pray!" Ka­di­ya ur­ged her, and she did, clas­ping the Black Tril­li­um amu­let in fe­ve­red hands. But the hot wind only blew mo­re strongly aro­und the Ci­ta­del, and Ka­di stor­med away ang­rily. In the dre­am she saw the bo­di­es of pat­he­tic de­ad cre­atu­res lying abo­ut everyw­he­re, pi­les of skin and bo­nes. And it was her fa­ult.</p>
   <p>    Her sis­ter Ha­ra­mis ca­me to warn her that the pe­op­le wo­uld die next: all of the hu­mans li­ving in the Pe­nin­su­la and the abo­ri­gi­nes of the Mi­re and mo­un­ta­ins as well. The dre­am-sis­ter po­in­ted out the win­dow to­ward the north, whe­re both the Whi­te Lady and the Black Sor­ce­rer we­re sa­id to li­ve. Only tho­se two wo­uld sur­vi­ve, Ha­ra­mis war­ned, if Ani­gel did not bring the Ra­in.</p>
   <p>    Death wo­uld co­me from that way-not in the form of a dry hot wind but as a gre­at storm of fi­re born of the fi­nal conf­lict bet­we­en the Arc­hi­ma­ge Bi­nah and Oro­gas­tus. The fi­re wo­uld con­su­me the known world un­less she, lit­tle help­less Ani­gel, stop­ped it.</p>
   <p>    "But I can't!" she mo­aned, ter­ror-stric­ken to the depths of her so­ul. "I've tri­ed, but I don't know how! My he­art is so­re pa­ined, and I'm so hor­ribly af­ra­id, and-<emphasis>I just can't</emphasis>!"</p>
   <p>    In the dre­am, the Pe­nin­su­lar Kings and Qu­e­ens and her fat­her Kra­in and mot­her Ka­lant­he and bra­ve Ka­di­ya and cle­ver Ha­ra­mis lo­oked at her with con­temp­tu­o­us pity. Then they left her loc­ked alo­ne in her ro­om, in disg­ra­ce. She po­un­ded on the do­or, sob­bing, but no one ca­me. Then she lo­oked aga­in out of the win­dow, and saw a wall of fla­mes that stretc­hed from ho­ri­zon to ho­ri­zon and le­apt hig­her than the Ci­ta­del's High To­wer.</p>
   <p>    It ro­ared stra­ight to­ward her whi­le she scre­amed and scre­amed…</p>
   <p>    "Wake up! Don't cry, swe­eting, it's all right!"</p>
   <p>    The fla­mes we­re black-stre­aked ver­mi­li­on li­li­es, dan­cing as she thras­hed wildly in a net ham­mock hung from the­ir vi­nes. She was in a cor­ner of a ro­om bu­ilt of squ­ared and car­ved sto­nes, all girt abo­ut with flo­we­ring plants. Im­mu had hold of her, rest­ra­ining her lest she fall from the ham­mock.</p>
   <p>    "A dre­am - it was only a dre­am," the old abo­ri­gi­nal wo­man cro­oned. "You're sa­fe sa­fe sa­fe, my dar­ling. He­re with fri­ends in Tre­vis­ta."</p>
   <p>    Anigel's fren­zi­ed cri­es stop­ped fi­nal­ly, and she clim­bed out of the ham­mock still all at­remb­le, and sat on a block of sto­ne whi­le Im­mu spon­ged her fa­ce and com­bed her ha­ir and la­ced her in­to the rosy sa­tin gown. In a low vo­ice, the Prin­cess sa­id, "I wo­uld li­ke to tell you abo­ut my dre­am. In fact, I <emphasis>must</emphasis> tell you."</p>
   <p>    Immu in­sis­ted on brin­ging so­met­hing to eat first, even tho­ugh Ani­gel had no ap­pe­ti­te. And she ad­ded: "I will al­so bring along my best fri­end who­se dwel­ling this is. If this dre­am of yo­urs is im­por­tant, then she is the one to in­terp­ret it, not I."</p>
   <p>    Immu va­nis­hed thro­ugh a do­or­way dra­ped with fi­la­men­to­us lic­hen that ma­de a fa­irly opa­que cur­ta­in. Ani­gel drew a de­ep bre­ath, gras­ped her amu­let, and told her­self to be calm. Im­me­di­ately, she felt bet­ter. She lo­oked abo­ut the cham­ber. Alt­ho­ugh it was open to the sky, the­re we­re eno­ugh sto­ut le­afy vi­nes la­ced over­he­ad to pro­vi­de sha­de -and the sus­pen­si­on for two ham­mocks. Al­most the en­ti­re wall be­hind the han­ging nets was ali­ve with the glo­ri­o­us oran­ge li­li­es; and when she lo­oked at them mo­re ca­re­ful­ly, she dis­co­ve­red that the blos­soms we­re in­sec­ti­vo­ro­us. What a cle­ver way to in­su­re bug-free slum­ber!…</p>
   <p>    On the pre­vi­o­us night, un­cer­ta­in that the tril­li­um amu­let wo­uld still ren­der them in­vi­sib­le, she and Im­mu had emer­ged from the­ir hi­ding pla­ce on the un­der­si­de of the wa­gon-bed only af­ter all the sol­di­ers on bo­ard the flat­bo­at had go­ne as­ho­re. The two fu­gi­ti­ves had crept down to the ed­ge of the ca­nal be­low the qu­ay steps, whe­re Im­mu had emp­lo­yed her spe­ech wit­ho­ut words to no­tify kins­men on the ot­her si­de of the wa­ter of the­ir pre­sen­ce and ne­ed.</p>
   <p>    In ti­me, a fle­et of Nysso­mu craft had flo­ated ac­ross to the La­bor­no­ki camp with the pro­vi­si­ons pro­mi­sed by the Dis­cer­ner. Two of the na­ti­ve bo­at­men we­re Im­mu's co­usins, Sit­hun and Tre­zi­lun. They fo­und Ani­gel and Im­mu with no dif­fi­culty at all, and in­sis­ted jovi­al­ly that the wo­men we­re cer­ta­inly <emphasis>not</emphasis> in­vi­sib­le. This had con­fir­med Ani­gel's sus­pi­ci­ons. Whi­le they we­re on the ri­ver, she had spe­cu­la­ted that the amu­let might only act pro­tec­ti­vely when the Prin­cess-we­arer was in the most de­adly dan­ger. The am­ber had re­fu­sed to pro­vi­de any com­forts for them when Ani­gel be­so­ught it du­ring the frigh­te­ning three-day trip from the Ci­ta­del to Tre­vis­ta.</p>
   <p>    "Well, you're sa­fe eno­ugh now," Tre­zi­lun had re­as­su­red them, as he hel­ped them in­to the punt. It was a du­go­ut so­me se­ven ells long with ups­wept po­in­ted ends upon which glow-worm lan­terns hung. The gun-Wa­les we­re fes­to­oned with flo­wers and both co­usins wo­re cha­ins of blos­soms aro­und the­ir necks and tuc­ked in­to the wispy ha­ir bet­we­en the­ir ups­tan­ding ears.</p>
   <p>    All thro­ug­ho­ut the bri­ef trip ac­ross the ca­nal, Ani­gel cro­uc­hed on the damp flo­or of the bo­at, fe­ar­ful that so­me enemy wo­uld spy her af­ter all and so­und the alarm. She knew very well that Oro­gas­tus and his two tha­uma­tur­gi­cal un­der­lings we­re on bo­ard the first flat­bo­at. What if the sor­ce­rer sho­uld co­me out on deck and see her with his own eyes?</p>
   <p>    But not­hing of the sort had hap­pe­ned. They lan­ded sa­fely at the Nysso­mu set­tle­ment, which was cal­led Ka­ro­na­gi­ra, and the co­usins con­duc­ted them down pa­ved stre­ets only par­ti­al­ly cle­ared of enc­ro­ac­hing ve­ge­ta­ti­on, so that they se­emed to be wal­king thro­ugh a vast dar­ke­ned tro­pi­cal con­ser­va­tory. The­re we­re ot­her small fi­gu­res mo­ving abo­ut with will-o'-the-wisp lights, but no­ne ven­tu­red ne­ar the new­co­mers. No il­lu­mi­na­ti­on at all ca­me from the an­ci­ent struc­tu­res that lo­omed ghostly in the mo­on­light, so be­a­uti­ful­ly ador­ned with night-blo­oming plants that Ani­gel at first tho­ught that the ef­fect was ar­ti­fi­ci­al. The Tre­vis­ta Nysso­mu we­re simply be­sot­ted with flo­wers! They wo­re them, they dra­ped the­ir punts with them, they li­ved in the midst of them.</p>
   <p>    Sithun and Tre­zi­lun left the­ir pas­sen­gers at a mo­dest-si­zed sto­ne dwel­ling with a gar­den-ve­ran­dah over­lo­oking the ca­nal. The­re was ap­pa­rently no one at ho­me, but this had not bot­he­red Im­mu. Alt­ho­ugh she her­self co­uld see qu­ite well in the fil­te­red mo­on­light, she had bor­ro­wed Sit­hun's lan­tern so that the Prin­cess wo­uld not be frigh­te­ned by the stran­ge ho­use. Lo­ca­ting the gu­est bed­ro­om, she had bust­led the ex­ha­us­ted girl off to sle­ep…</p>
   <p>    "And now yo­ur re­al ad­ven­tu­re be­gins," sa­id a soft vo­ice be­hind Ani­gel.</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess jum­ped and ga­ve a lit­tle cry. Then she la­ug­hed when she tur­ned aro­und and saw the spe­aker was anot­her Nysso­mu wo­man, even mo­re ve­ne­rab­le than Im­mu, who­se wo­ven-grass ro­be was stud­ded all over with sa­ucer-si­zed whi­te blos­soms, the­ir stems fas­te­ned in pla­ce with thorns. She wo­re two gre­at pom­pons of the sa­me flo­wers at the si­des of her he­ad. But aro­und her neck was not a gar­land but a pla­ti­num cha­in, and at the end of it was an obj­ect li­ke a small, or­na­te hand lens.</p>
   <p>    The Od­dling wo­man ra­ised the glass and pe­ered thro­ugh it at Ani­gel, who saw one yel­low eye gro­tes­qu­ely mag­ni­fi­ed. "So you are the girl who dre­ams im­por­tant dre­ams."</p>
   <p>    That vo­ice was very fa­mi­li­ar. Ani­gel had lis­te­ned to it yes­ter­day whi­le still hid­den on the flat­bo­at. "And you are the Dis­cer­ner Fro­lo­tu! I did not re­cog­ni­ze you dif­fe­rently at­ti­red."</p>
   <p>    "To hu­mans," the wo­man sa­id gently, "we Nysso­mu tend to lo­ok all ali­ke."</p>
   <p>    "I beg yo­ur par­don if I ha­ve of­fen­ded you, Dis­cer­ner. And I thank you for shel­te­ring us."</p>
   <p>    "But you did not sle­ep pe­ace­ful­ly."</p>
   <p>    "I had the most ghastly dre­am," the Prin­cess sa­id. "The worst night­ma­re of my li­fe. Will you lis­ten to me tell of it, and per­haps exp­la­in it to me?"</p>
   <p>    Frolutu's two fang­li­ke lo­wer front te­eth glis­te­ned as she smi­led. "We'll see if that's pos­sib­le. Let us go on­to the ter­ra­ce, whe­re Im­mu is la­ying out yo­ur me­al."</p>
   <p>    Anigel he­si­ta­ted. "I thank you, but I am not re­al­ly very hungry. And if we go out­si­de we will be wit­hin vi­ew of any who tra­vel the ca­nal. What if the sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus or his mi­ni­ons sho­uld see me - "</p>
   <p>    "We are de­ep wit­hin the is­lands," the Dis­cer­ner sa­id. "You are sa­fe eno­ugh for a whi­le. Sit down he­re and eat and tell this one the dre­am."</p>
   <p>    When the Prin­cess saw the fo­od that Im­mu had pre­pa­red and set upon a gra­ce­ful tab­le of car­ved sto­ne, she ne­arly burst in­to te­ars. Du­ring the three days of the­ir upst­re­am jo­ur­ney from the Ci­ta­del she had sub­sis­ted upon the ra­ti­ons Im­mu had car­ri­ed: aw­ful dri­ed ro­ots, sickly swe­et mist­ber­ry le­at­her, and not­hing but wa­ter to drink. The amu­let had ig­no­red her ple­as for so­met­hing mo­re edib­le. He­re in Tre­vis­ta she had ex­pec­ted to be ser­ved un­pa­la­tab­le Nysso­mu dis­hes that wo­uld furt­her aff­ront her de­li­ca­te di­ges­ti­on - but the­re was a surp­ri­se.</p>
   <p>    "Oh, Im­mu! <emphasis>Re­al fo­od</emphasis>!"</p>
   <p>    The croc­kery and tab­le­wa­re we­re stran­ge, but the me­al it­self was her fa­mi­li­ar Ci­ta­del bre­ak­fast: lit­tle ri­ce hot­ca­kes driz­zled with wa­ter-bee ho­ney, a curd-ome­let fil­led with fresh mush­ro­oms, spicy bro­iled sa­usa­ges, la­du ju­ice, and a ste­aming pot of dar­ci tea. The­re we­re lar­ge dis­hes of everyt­hing, and the Prin­cess de­vo­ured it li­ke a star­ving thing, which of co­ur­se she was, bab­bling her gra­ti­tu­de with her mo­uth full whi­le Im­mu pre­ten­ded to be aff­ron­ted.</p>
   <p>    "Real fo­od, in­de­ed! Silly spo­iled girl. And I sup­po­se you think the Nysso­mu sub­sist on ro­ots and ber­ri­es and swamp­wa­ter all of the ti­me!"</p>
   <p>    Anigel was abas­hed. "I fe­ar I ne­ver tho­ught at all abo­ut what the wild Od­dlings eat. Im­mu, I'm sony. I sho­uld ha­ve ta­ken an in­te­rest, as Ka­di­ya did -"</p>
   <p>    "Never mind, lo­ve." The Dis­cer­ner Fro­lo­tu was pe­ering at her aga­in thro­ugh her lens and smi­ling. "Both Im­mu and this one know that the­re is no ma­li­ce in yo­ur he­art, only the he­ed­les­sness of yo­uth."</p>
   <p>    "But whe­re did you <emphasis>get</emphasis> this fo­od?" Ani­gel as­ked.</p>
   <p>    "Questions qu­es­ti­ons qu­es­ti­ons!" Im­mu snap­ped. "From the nob­les' com­mis­sary over in Lu­sa­gi­ra Squ­are, if you must know. I had Sit­hun and Tre­zi­lun ste­al a fa­irish amo­unt, kno­wing how you suf­fe­red whilst eating our tra­il ra­ti­ons on the ri­ver. It will last for a lit­tle whi­le on the jo­ur­ney to Noth. But in ti­me you will ha­ve to mas­ter yo­ur ten­der sto­mach's pre­fe­ren­ces and ac­cept what the co­untry pro­vi­des."</p>
   <p>    "I ex­pect I will," the Prin­cess sa­id, bet­we­en gulps of tea. "When I get hungry eno­ugh! But tell me - ha­ve you re­al­ly fo­und a way for us to tra­vel to the ho­me of the Arc­hi­ma­ge?"</p>
   <p>    "Thanks to Fro­lo­tu. She has fri­ends among the Uis­gu who ha­ve ag­re­ed to ta­ke you in a ri­mo­rik-drawn punt."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess sprang up from her se­at, knelt at the Dis­cer­ner's fe­et, and kis­sed both her wrink­led ta­lo­ned hands. "Thank you, de­ar Lady! I thank you with all my he­art, and I will find so­me way to re­ward you."</p>
   <p>    The old wo­man tut-tut­ted as she di­sen­ga­ged her­self. "Child, this one's re­ward will be yo­ur ful­fil­lment of yo­ur des­tiny."</p>
   <p>    "You-you know so­met­hing of it?"</p>
   <p>    "This one knows the prop­he­ci­es con­cer­ning the Three Pe­tals of the Li­ving Tril­li­um who will de­li­ver our be­lo­ved Mazy Mi­re from mor­tal dan­ger. And it se­ems that you are one of the de­sig­na­ted."</p>
   <p>    Anigel flus­hed and tur­ned away. "I wish it we­re not so. I am very much af­ra­id - not bra­ve or cle­ver li­ke my sis­ters. And my dre­am told me that I wo­uld fa­il."</p>
   <p>    Frolotu la­ug­hed. "Oh, it did, did it? Sup­po­se you fi­nish yo­ur tea and tell us this dre­am."</p>
   <p>    All three sat down at the tab­le, and Ani­gel desc­ri­bed her night­ma­re in de­ta­il whi­le the Dis­cer­ner to­yed with the lens and oc­ca­si­onal­ly scru­ti­ni­zed the girl thro­ugh it. Ani­gel was too shy to ask what the de­vi­ce re­ve­aled, or why it was used ins­te­ad of the po­in­ting re­ed that had hel­ped Fro­lo­tu re­ad the he­art of Prin­ce An­tar.</p>
   <p>    "This one will tell you why!" the surp­ri­sing old wo­man sa­id. "The lens is a de­vi­ce of the Va­nis­hed Ones. It ser­ves to fo­cus tho­ughts upon the mind of anot­her. But it te­ac­hes its user al­so, and af­ter a ti­me one ne­ed not al­ways use it. If the wic­ked enc­han­ter had se­en it yes­ter­day, he wo­uld ha­ve ta­ken it no mat­ter how Prin­ce An­tar at­temp­ted to for­bid him. And so this one used the re­ed, which no hu­man wo­uld va­lue."</p>
   <p>    "You use the lens now, ho­we­ver," Ani­gel sa­id.</p>
   <p>    "Yes, child. In the mor­ning, the fa­cul­ti­es of the el­derly are at low ebb and we ne­ed all the help we can get… But fi­nish tel­ling of yo­ur dre­am."</p>
   <p>    Anigel re­la­ted everyt­hing to the last de­ta­il, and the re­li­ving was so dist­res­sing that she tur­ned as wan as the ter­ra­ce sto­ne­work and co­uld ba­rely fi­nish spe­aking. At the end the Dis­cer­ner sat back with her gre­at eyes clo­sed and her wi­de lips mumb­ling si­lent words.</p>
   <p>    Anigel wa­ited, full of dre­ad. All aro­und the flo­wer-ban­ked ter­ra­ce, birds and in­sects sang, and sil­ver fis­hes le­aped out in the ca­nal. Then Fro­lo­tu's eye­lids ope­ned with an audib­le pop.</p>
   <p>    "Do you know what the dre­am me­ans?" Ani­gel as­ked ti­midly.</p>
   <p>    "Of co­ur­se! Now, the usu­al thing for a sa­ge to do when qu­eri­ed abo­ut things li­ke this is to de­mand that the dre­amer her­self analy­ze the dre­am. Or el­se the wi­se one must ut­ter so­me me­aly-mo­ut­hed clic­he to the ef­fect that un­ders­tan­ding will co­me to you all in go­od ti­me. But this one will not trif­le with you, girl! Yo­ur path will be dif­fi­cult eno­ugh, and the kin­dest thing to do is tell you pla­in: yo­ur dre­am me­ans that you are a co­ward, and you wo­uld li­ke to shirk yo­ur hard duty."</p>
   <p>    "But I <emphasis>knew</emphasis> that!" the Prin­cess wa­iled.</p>
   <p>    "Hush, now, hush. Lis­ten to the exp­la­na­ti­on. Dre­ams are so­me­ti­mes vo­uch­sa­fed by the Lords of the Air - but this sort of thing is very un­com­mon. Most dre­ams ac­tu­al­ly co­me from de­ep wit­hin our sec­ret self. And a dis­tur­bing, im­por­tant dre­am li­ke this one me­ans that <emphasis>yo­ur</emphasis> sec­ret self-the most im­por­tant part of you, that which is clo­sest to ref­lec­ting the ima­ge of God - is full of an­xi­ety abo­ut the way that you are be­ha­ving. It is both war­ning you and ur­ging you to do bet­ter: to be true to the nob­le ins­tincts that prompt you, and to over­co­me sel­fish­ness and co­war­di­ce."</p>
   <p>    "But I don't know how!"</p>
   <p>    "You will be told," the Dis­cer­ner sa­id softly. "You ha­ve al­re­ady star­ted on yo­ur path. This one has se­en it all thro­ugh the glass. What is ne­ces­sary is that you <emphasis>get on with it</emphasis>-one day af­ter anot­her, de­ter­mi­ned and trus­ting."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess lo­oked do­ubt­ful. "But that se­ems too simp­le."</p>
   <p>    Both Fro­lo­tu and Im­mu la­ug­hed long and mer­rily. At first Ani­gel was hurt, then angry, and fi­nal­ly she had to la­ugh with them.</p>
   <p>    "You ha­ve es­ca­ped de­ath thro­ugh many mi­rac­les and with the help of go­od fri­ends." Fro­lo­tu's fa­ce had be­co­me gra­ve. "The next steps you must ta­ke are cle­arly set out for you. You must go re­so­lu­tely, whet­her you are af­ra­id or not. The­re is no sha­me in fe­ar, Prin­cess. We can­not help it. But so­me­ti­mes we are so­lemnly ob­li­ged to carry on in spi­te of it."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess lo­oked down in her lap, whe­re her hands we­re tightly clenc­hed. "I - I will try."</p>
   <p>    "Good." Fro­lo­tu aro­se from her se­at. "The Uis­gu bo­at that we ha­ve sum­mo­ned will be he­re this eve­ning. Un­til then, you must re­ma­in se­qu­es­te­red. That fo­ul sor­ce­rer has left one of his mi­ni­ons be­hind at the gar­ri­son-we as­su­me to be­gin the se­arch for you and yo­ur sis­ter Prin­ces­ses. But you will be off to Noth be­fo­re mo­on­ri­se. If all go­es well, you sho­uld re­ach the abo­de of the Whi­te Lady in abo­ut fo­ur days."</p>
   <p>    Anigel was down­cast at the tho­ught of re­su­ming her jo­ur­ney so so­on. But when she spo­ke her vo­ice held a to­uch of he­althy irony. "It wo­uld be very con­so­ling to be ab­le to ha­ve a go­od cry right now, mo­ur­ning my de­ad and fe­eling very sorry for myself. I co­uld not we­ep on the bo­at be­ca­use the so­und might ha­ve bet­ra­yed us. And now it se­ems the­re is no ti­me for it. Well, per­haps this is anot­her pur­po­se of dre­ams. I can bawl my eyes out in that sha­dow­land, and co­wer and re­fu­se des­tiny night af­ter night, and it is no sin nor we­ak­ness. But when I am awa­ke I will do my best to simply… get on with it!"</p>
   <p>    "That's my girl," cro­wed Im­mu.</p>
   <p>    The Dis­cer­ner smi­led her ap­pro­val. "Yo­ur sec­ret self wis­hes to help you. By conf­ron­ting yo­ur night­ma­res he­ad-on, you will su­rely le­arn to fe­ar them less."</p>
   <p>    A tra­ce of the old pa­nic mo­men­ta­rily re­sur­fa­ced on Ani­gel's fa­ce. She ap­pe­aled to her old fri­end. "But you will stand by me all the way, Im­mu, won't you? If I we­re alo­ne - I don't think-"</p>
   <p>    "I will lo­ve and ser­ve you all my days," Im­mu sa­id. She re­ac­hed out to the girl be­si­de her and emb­ra­ced her and kis­sed her che­ek. "I am co­ming along with you to Noth, of co­ur­se, and I will ac­com­pany you whe­re­ver the Whi­te Lady sends you. But the­re will co­me a ti­me, as it co­mes for all of us, when you must stand fast by yo­ur­self."</p>
   <p>    Anigel bu­ri­ed her fa­ce in her old nur­se's sho­ul­der. "Not too so­on. Ple­ase, not too so­on."</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Thirteen</strong></p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Kadiya awo­ke in­to twi­light and the smell of bro­iling fish which im­me­di­ately ro­used in her a hun­ger she fo­und ne­ar to pa­in. It se­emed that Jagun had da­red a small fi­re.and was ten­ding a num­ber of gar­su, the lon­gest hardly the length of her hand.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya crept thro­ugh the thick brush which gu­ar­ded the­ir camp and ca­me to the wa­ter, whe­re she used le­aves to scrub her fa­ce and her hands. She lon­ged for the warm po­ol of wa­ter back in the Ci­ta­del whe­re she and her sis­ters had spor­ted and le­ar­ned to swim, for the hand­ful of swe­et-scen­ted crystals from the so­uth which one co­uld strew on the wa­ter un­til one's body res­ted in a scen­ted froth. Sto­utly wo­ven as the Od­dling clot­hing was, hers sho­wed rents, and the gre­ase with which she was for­ced to sme­ar her­self now smelt ran­cid. Her lank ha­ir she co­uld only twist back and anc­hor with a sto­ut length of re­ed.</p>
   <p>    She ca­me back to camp and Jagun was qu­ick to hand her one of the spit­ted gar­su which she ate with her fin­gers, lic­king them qu­ickly when the he­at and gre­ase ma­de them smart.</p>
   <p>    Jagun was si­lent as she ate. Nor was he mo­re com­mu­ni­ca­ti­ve as they era­sed, as best they co­uld, the signs of the­ir oc­cu­pancy and re­tur­ned to the punt, pul­ling it back in­to open wa­ter. Ka­di­ya per­su­aded him that she sho­uld ta­ke a hand in the­ir vo­ya­ging and he put asi­de the scull for a po­le, gi­ving her its twin.</p>
   <p>    This exer­ci­se was not new to the girl, but she fo­und it to­ok her a me­asu­re of ti­me to fall in­to the pat­tern which matc­hed Jagun's ef­forts. She fo­und that on­ce she had cap­tu­red the pro­per rhythm the­re was so­met­hing al­most hypno­tic abo­ut it. Plun­ge the po­le, exert her strength, plun­ge aga­in. She was in the bow and she glan­ced fre­qu­ently at the spark ri­ding in her amu­let.</p>
   <p>    They res­ted from ti­me to ti­me. On­ce they pa­used to pull from the wa­ter the ro­ots of cer­ta­in li­li­es. The hu­ge blos­soms we­re still only buds so that the ro­ots co­uld be eaten with im­pu­nity. Tho­se, with what was left of the gar­su, for­med the­ir mid­night me­al.</p>
   <p>    This had be­en an eve­ning of si­len­ce. Ka­di­ya felt a cons­tant une­ase. Even the hypno­tic swing of the po­les co­uld not ke­ep her from fe­aring so­me in­vi­sib­le, vo­ice­less at­tack. Among his own pe­op­le Jagun ran­ked very high in tra­ilc­raft, and she co­uld be su­re that he wo­uld be ins­tantly ali­ve to any na­tu­ral thre­at. But tho­se we­re at­tacks from the outer world, whi­le this thing that she fe­ared ca­me from the in­ner which she had not even re­ali­zed exis­ted un­til its first ma­ni­fes­ta­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "Jagun." She kept her vo­ice very low, hardly hig­her than the buzz of the many in­sects abo­ut them. "What still li­es be­fo­re us?" How she wis­hed now that she had pa­id mo­re at­ten­ti­on to that lar­ge mu­ral map which had co­ve­red, in very fa­ded co­lors, the wall of the Ci­ta­del co­un­cil cham­ber.</p>
   <p>    "We he­ad in­to the Gol­den­mi­re," he sa­id. "Be­fo­re that we to­uch at Vu­ren­ha."</p>
   <p>    "Your own clan pla­ce."</p>
   <p>    "Yes. I am of the outer clans. Be­yond that li­es what only a few of the An­ces­tors ha­ve ever se­en. I can­not say what we will find the­re. We shall ha­ve to de­pend wholly on that which you we­ar."</p>
   <p>    "Uisgu co­untry?" she pres­sed.</p>
   <p>    "Some of it, yes, but al­so the dark pla­ces whe­re the Drow­ners set up the­ir land po­les. Of that we ha­ve ta­les in plenty, how much truth is in them we do not know. But we must cross that co­untry to re­ach Noth, for if we go by the lon­ger way we may be trac­ked by tho­se who fol­low us."</p>
   <p>    "You ha­ve be­en to Noth, Jagun?"</p>
   <p>    "Once. It was when you we­re a ba­be. It is la­id upon us who are hun­ters, that when we be­li­eve we are well skil­led in our craft, we shall pre­sent our­sel­ves to the Lady, that she may grant us the full fre­edom of the Mi­res. It was then that she inst­ruc­ted me to co­me to yo­ur Fat­her's co­urt, to ser­ve as hun­ter and awa­it the day of ne­ed she prop­he­si­ed, that day which has so re­cently pas­sed. Al­so it is la­id upon us that any new dis­co­very we may ma­ke of the Va­nis­hed Ones we re­port to her."</p>
   <p>    "New dis­co­ve­ri­es?" Ka­di­ya was int­ri­gu­ed. "Are the­re new dis­co­ve­ri­es still to be ma­de then, Jagun? So many hund­reds ha­ve pas­sed sin­ce yo­ur pe­op­le be­gan to jo­ur­ney the Mi­res. What mo­re might the­re be to find?"</p>
   <p>    For a mo­ment Jagun did not ans­wer her. When he did the­re was a re­luc­tant no­te in his vo­ice. "Far­se­er, the Va­nis­hed Ones had sec­rets be­yond any we can gu­ess. It is al­so true that any an­ci­ent ar­ti­fact which is un­li­ke tho­se dis­co­ve­red be­fo­re must be ta­ken to the Whi­te Lady of Noth. So­me she ke­eps, and we know such things are dan­ge­ro­us and that the­ir sec­rets are part of her gu­ar­di­ans­hip."</p>
   <p>    It was pla­in to Ka­di­ya that he in­ten­ded to say no mo­re on that su­bj­ect. But su­rely if he had se­en the Arc­hi­ma­ge he co­uld fur­nish her with so­me scraps of know­led­ge which wo­uld pre­pa­re her for her own me­eting.</p>
   <p>    "What is she li­ke, Jagun? I know that she is mighty in ma­gic, but how do­es that ma­ke her dif­fe­rent from ot­hers? They ha­ve sa­id that Oro­gas­tus is one who has a body li­ke any ot­her man but that he is of kingly ap­pe­aran­ce and ab­le to turn such eyes upon a per­son that one can deny him not­hing. But then the enemy al­ways grows the gre­ater in ta­les. If Oro­gas­tus is truly mo­re than any man-then what is the Arc­hi­ma­ge?"</p>
   <p>    "King's Da­ugh­ter, she is the Lady, the Gu­ar­di­an. Li­fe she knows and de­ath, but with ne­it­her is she her­self con­cer­ned. For li­fe and de­ath are the com­mon lot of all. She has be­en ever the sa­me sin­ce my pe­op­le first lo­oked upon her. She ra­ises no hand to stop de­ath and she bec­kons forth no new li­fe. Ins­te­ad she holds the ba­lan­ce true and we de­al with ti­me's pas­sa­ge af­ter our na­tu­re. Only she holds the Mi­res aga­inst in­va­si­on, and now the ba­lan­ce has be­en over-we­igh­ted and must be set stra­ight aga­in. A thing, King's Da­ugh­ter, for which you we­re born."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya had thrust her po­le de­ep. Now she did not withd­raw it, but half tur­ned in the punt to fa­ce Jagun.</p>
   <p>    "I was born?" Her vo­ice sca­led up.</p>
   <p>    "You three we­re born, Far­se­er. Ti­me pas­ses, and even the har­dest sto­ne must yi­eld in the end to flo­wing ye­ars. She of Noth lo­oks for­ward in ti­me. Thus when she se­es clo­uds gat­her it is her duty to pre­pa­re aga­inst the co­ming of the Win­ter Ra­ins. Be­fo­re the day of yo­ur birth.</p>
   <p>    King's Da­ugh­ter, cer­ta­in of my pe­op­le and cer­ta­in of the Uis­gu, we­re sum­mo­ned to Noth. They we­re war­ned that the­re was Dark­ness gro­wing and that she who had sto­od bet­we­en us and all ma­ni­fes­ta­ti­ons of that in the past was not this ti­me ab­le to sum­mon up a wall of strength. Ho­we­ver, she pro­mi­sed us this: the­re wo­uld be tho­se who wo­uld fol­low af­ter and re­es­tab­lish the ba­lan­ce."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya bit her lip. On­ce mo­re her in­ner an­ger bla­zed up from the co­als she ca­re­ful­ly no­uris­hed.</p>
   <p>    "A war­ning - she co­uld ha­ve gi­ven a war­ning!"</p>
   <p>    "Farseer, this is the first ti­me in the me­mory of the his­tory songs of my pe­op­le that the Whi­te Lady of Noth has fa­ced one of si­mi­lar po­wers. He may be even gre­ater than she had hit­her­to know­led­ge of. You wish to ta­ke blo­od pri­ce of Volt­rik for yo­ur kin… per­haps that is but a small thing in com­pa­ri­son with that which you will ha­ve to cla­im be­fo­re the end."</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ve no ma­gic - " she be­gan.</p>
   <p>    "Look you to tho­se re­eds." Jagun nod­ded to the­ir right. "One such you can pull, and, with not much ef­fort, you may snap it. Three you pull, twist well to­get­her, and you ha­ve a cord which will ent­rap a har­fut. One you are, three you are…"</p>
   <p>    Kadiya ga­ve an im­pa­ti­ent he­ave to her po­le. "Ha­ra­mis, Ani­gel, and I are to be yo­ur ro­pe?" She la­ug­hed. "I fe­ar you can do lit­tle skil­lful hun­ting with such a sna­re as that!"</p>
   <p>    Magic -she had no ma­gic, and cer­ta­inly Ani­gel had ne­ver in her soft li­fe sho­wed any de­si­re to play with for­got­ten lo­re. Ma­gic! She did not want to think of that as a we­apon. Let her me­et Volt­rik with true ste­el in her hands. She did not know how or when that wo­uld oc­cur, but she be­li­eved that it wo­uld. And she wo­uld not de­pend upon any du­bi­o­us ma­gic to do then what must be do­ne!</p>
   <p>    Sometimes du­ring that long night of jo­ur­ne­ying she co­uld not hold un­der tho­se tho­ughts. But al­ways she for­ced her at­ten­ti­on back to what lay abo­ut them. Twi­ce they stop­ped by the shel­ter of so­me hum­mock to rest and eat. She rub­bed her ac­hing arms and sho­ul­ders but she re­fu­sed to ut­ter any comp­la­int: in fact she and Jagun had very few words bet­we­en them.</p>
   <p>    Once the­re ca­me a harsh, night-shat­te­ring scre­am. Ka­di­ya, tho­ugh she had ne­ver he­ard its li­ke be­fo­re, held ste­ady. They we­re res­ting un­der the dro­oping limbs of a wa­ter-wyde tree and so scre­ened and ens­ha­do­wed. Abo­ve them the Trip­le Mo­ons gle­amed, and ac­ross the sky flew a black-win­ged sha­pe which ma­de the girl draw a de­ep bre­ath in awe. The thing pla­inly was lar­ger than the punt be­ne­ath her fe­et and its wingsp­re­ad for a mo­ment blot­ted out the stars. What it co­uld be she had no idea; she had ne­ver even he­ard its li­ke desc­ri­bed be­fo­re.</p>
   <p>    It scre­ec­hed aga­in and then was go­ne. Yet Jagun ma­de no mo­ve to ven­tu­re out of the­ir hi­ding pla­ce. The girl he­ard him ut­ter a very low hiss, and he whis­pe­red: "The vo­or - and it hunts!" All the une­ase of one who must fa­ce a vastly mo­re po­wer­ful foe was in the hun­ter's vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    "The vo­or?"</p>
   <p>    "It co­uld not ha­ve flown he­re from cho­ice, for it is a cre­atu­re of the he­art of the unk­nown." He spo­ke as if he tal­ked to him­self. "What brings it to this co­untry? Su­rely the­re must be a fe­ar­so­me stir­ring over all the world."</p>
   <p>    At length they be­gan the­ir ad­van­ce on­ce mo­re, this ti­me at a les­ser pa­ce. Ka­di­ya to­ok all the ca­re she co­uld to be as qu­i­et as pos­sib­le. On­ce mo­re they he­ard that ear-tor­tu­ring cry, but it so­un­ded fart­her to the north, in the di­rec­ti­on of the­ir tra­vel.</p>
   <p>    They ma­de camp as the sun aro­se. At first Ka­di­ya wo­uld ha­ve ste­ered away from the hig­her land to­ward which Jagun ur­ged them, for the­re was go­od evi­den­ce that it con­ta­ined mo­re ru­ins and she co­uld not for­get what they had fo­und in the last such pla­ce. But Jagun was emp­ha­tic,</p>
   <p>    He po­in­ted to so­me swirls in the dark wa­ter. "Sucb­ri - and su­rely a nes­ting of them. They do not al­low them­sel­ves to be fo­und ne­ar any pla­ce whe­re the­re has be­en a camp."</p>
   <p>    They lan­ded on the is­land and Jagun di­sap­pe­ared, blow­pi­pe in hand. The girl gat­he­red pi­eces of the drift­wo­od car­ri­ed by the ri­ver in the ra­iny se­ason, and with ca­re set up, re­ady for the ligh­ting, such a fi­re as wo­uld be the le­ast vi­sib­le. As she sat qu­i­etly then to wa­it, she ope­ned all her sen­ses to what lay abo­ut her. The odors of the swamp com­ming­led. She smel­led the scent of flo­wers, a bre­ath of de­cay and rot­ten­ness, even tra­ces of ani­mal musk. Tho­ugh she was no hol­der of the gift Jagun and ot­her hun­ters pos­ses­sed in its en­ti­rety, Ka­di­ya set her­self now to try to se­pa­ra­te one of tho­se wisps of odor from anot­her and to re­cog­ni­ze and clas­sify each as best she co­uld.</p>
   <p>    Also she lis­te­ned. The­re was li­fe all abo­ut her, awa­king in­to mo­re stri­dent so­und as the sun aro­se. She re­cog­ni­zed the click-clat­ter of a nas-be­et­le, and mo­re dis­tantly the half sle­epy chir­ping of birds. The­re was such abun­dant li­fe in the swamp and she and her kind we­re only int­ru­ders he­re. It wo­uld ta­ke mo­re li­fe­ti­mes than we­re ac­cor­ded to tho­se of her blo­od to be ab­le to clas­sify and know the swamp li­fe even a small bit.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya to­ok up the amu­let and held it in­to the first ray of sun­light which re­ac­hed the camp. The small bud wit­hin was tight clo­sed - alt­ho­ugh the spark of light sho­wed at its very tip. Black, the flo­wer was truly black as no ot­her was known to be. It was the bad­ge of her ho­use - tho­ugh the re­ason for that was so­met­hing even the ol­dest of le­gends did not tell.</p>
   <p>    Though she had not he­ard him co­ming Jagun was sud­denly the­re. He had a pa­ir of ka­ra­woks, wa­ter still drip­ping from the­ir open mo­uths. His blow­pi­pe was in his hand, and he lo­oked, not to­ward her, but over his sho­ul­der to his back tra­il.</p>
   <p>    She co­uld ha­ve co­un­ted to ten whi­le he sto­od the­re. Then the ten­se li­ne of his sho­ul­ders re­la­xed a lit­tle. On­ce mo­re his ga­ze went from right to left as far as his he­ad co­uld turn whi­le he sta­red back the way he had co­me. At last he drop­ped down with a sigh. His skin had gre­yed du­ring the gru­eling ef­forts of the­ir flight. He had drop­ped the ka­ra­woks wit­ho­ut a glan­ce as if the fact he had do­ne so well with his hun­ting no lon­ger me­ant anyt­hing.</p>
   <p>    Instead, af­ter res­ting his blow­pi­pe over one knee, Jagun lo­osed from his belt a lar­ge mis­sha­pen bund­le bo­und up in a le­af. This he un­rol­led qu­ickly. With a gasp Ka­di­ya drew back. The stench was so gre­at it se­emed as if wha­te­ver ca­used it had be­en hur­led stra­ight in­to her fa­ce. The thing was a lump of what lo­oked li­ke gre­en-yel­low so­li­di­fi­ed jel­ly.</p>
   <p>    "Skritek-spawn." Jagun let the thing lie, wi­ping his hand vi­go­ro­usly on a wad of grass. "It is a very yo­ung one, but de­adly eno­ugh."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya simply sta­red. That the Skri­tek them­sel­ves had ven­tu­red this far so­uth to set up a warn po­le was be­yond all re­ason. That they wo­uld ha­ve a we­ave-hi­ve ne­ar he­re- Su­rely this co­uld not hap­pen!</p>
   <p>    "There was a vo­or pla­ce of fe­eding," Jagun con­ti­nu­ed. "It had fed - on this."</p>
   <p>    "How far do­es such a one fly?" she as­ked.</p>
   <p>    "Bearing a full-si­zed spawn? Not far from the ne­arest known Skri­tek hol­dings-"</p>
   <p>    Kadiya con­si­de­red the thre­at be­hind that. "The Skri­tek are then mo­ving so­uth?"</p>
   <p>    Jagun pic­ked up the un­rol­led le­af, ta­king ca­re not to to­uch what it held. He went away from the­ir camp, dug a ho­le with a stick, and cram­med the ma­lo­do­ro­us frag­ment in, pres­sing down dirt over it.</p>
   <p>    There was a grim no­te in his vo­ice as he re­tur­ned. "We ha­ve many ro­utes wit­hin the Mi­res, and most we know well. But no one can co­ver all this co­untry. The­re are pla­ces of qu­aking mud which swal­low all in­va­ders, past which we can­not go. What li­es be­yond - " He shrug­ged.</p>
   <p>    They ate and then Ka­di­ya aga­in to­ok the first watch whi­le Jagun res­ted. She fo­und it har­der than ever to stay awa­ke, even when she set her tho­ughts on what might be the re­sult of a de­li­be­ra­te chan­ge of Skri­tek ter­ri­tory. And she lap­sed al­most im­me­di­ately in­to the de­ep sle­ep of one who has pus­hed her body to the li­mit when Jagun to­ok her pla­ce.</p>
   <p>    It was in the la­te af­ter­no­on when he ro­used her. He had be­en hun­ting aga­in, and this ti­me he had not only so­me of the swe­et lily ro­ots but gar­su fish, the very sight of which ma­de her mo­uth wa­ter. They ate slowly, sa­vo­ring each bi­te, and then left the re­fu­ge, fol­lo­wing al­ways the pro­mi­se of the amu­let's light.</p>
   <p>    That night they ca­ught no sight of the vo­or, nor any tra­ce that mo­re exis­ted along the­ir path than the ve­ge­ta­ti­on and usu­al in­ha­bi­tants of the Mi­res. But now they we­re at last clo­se to the Gol­den­mi­re, clo­se eno­ugh to glimp­se patc­hes of the bril­li­antly co­lo­red flo­we­ring re­eds which ga­ve the dist­rict its na­me.</p>
   <p>    When dawn war­ned them of the ne­ed for shel­ter they we­re ab­le to rest in a pla­ce very dif­fe­rent from the ro­ugh camps they had ma­de along the way. For a ho­oting cry rang out, which bro­ught an eager ans­wer from Jagun.</p>
   <p>    The bank of the gre­at shal­low ri­ver was now cleft by the mo­uth of a smal­ler stre­am. Jagun sent the­ir craft stra­ight in­to the ope­ning. Now on eit­her bank of the cre­ek ap­pe­ared Od­dlings Ka­di­ya tho­ught to be Nysso­mu by the­ir wo­ven gar­ments. But when they cal­led out to Jagun it was not in tra­de ton­gue, and she co­uld only un­ders­tand a word or two. Jagun no­sed the punt clo­ser to the left bank. One of the Folk step­ped ca­re­ful­ly in­to it, ta­king the po­le from Ka­di­ya and ges­tu­ring her to sit, as with po­wer­ful sur­ges he sent the small craft for­ward.</p>
   <p>    Thus she ca­me to Vu­ren­ha, the only true Nysso­mu vil­la­ge she had ever se­en. Tho­se who had tra­ding con­cerns in Tre­vis­ta li­ved in the ru­ins the­re. But he­re was no sign of any ot­her his­tory than that of the­ir own kind. The­ir ho­uses we­re set on pi­les in a wi­de ex­pan­se of wa­ter. Each sto­od at the cen­ter of a plat­form ra­ised abo­ut fi­ve ells abo­ve the sur­fa­ce, nuz­zled on two si­des by a num­ber of punts si­mi­lar to that which had bro­ught her he­re.</p>
   <p>    Vines, with the­ir ro­ots in pots, we­re evenly spa­ced abo­ut the si­des of each long ho­use, and the­ir growth had go­ne up the walls of the bu­il­dings un­til the le­aves ap­pe­ared to be spro­uting from the struc­tu­res them­sel­ves. The vi­nes we­re now sho­wing he­avy pods of yel­low, sha­ding to scar­let, which we­ig­hed them down. Tho­se Ka­di­ya re­cog­ni­zed as the raw ma­te­ri­als from which a sus­ta­ining and tasty be­ve­ra­ge was ma­de. Along the sho­res of the small la­ke on which the vil­la­ge had be­en erec­ted we­re crop plots, as well as pens for two of the fo­od ani­mals Nysso­mu ra­ised-woth and qu­bar - both lar­ger than the­ir wild co­usins in the Mi­res.</p>
   <p>    Their punt was sent to the si­de of one of the ho­uses. The­re we­re fi­gu­res out­si­de all the dwel­lings now, but the fo­ur awa­iting the­ir ar­ri­val we­re ol­der and two of them we­re wo­men, the­ir fa­ces pa­in­ted with small iri­des­cent pat­terns and the­ir grass ro­bes frin­ged with small shells or bits of glit­te­ring ma­te­ri­al which might ha­ve co­me from the ru­ins. The tal­lest and most imp­res­si­ve ap­pe­aring of the wo­men now step­ped for­ward to bid them wel­co­me.</p>
   <p>    "Greeting, First of the Ho­use." Jagun spo­ke slowly and this ti­me Ka­di­ya was ab­le to un­ders­tand every word. "May Tho­se We Do Not Na­me bring ho­nor and go­od li­fe to all the clan and to this kin­hold."</p>
   <p>    The Nysso­mu inc­li­ned her he­ad with the sa­me gra­ce Ka­di­ya had se­en her Mot­her use upon a for­mal oc­ca­si­on of me­eting an of­fi­ci­al em­bas­sy.</p>
   <p>    "This one of­fers ro­of co­ver, Hun­ter," she sa­id.</p>
   <p>    Then Jagun int­ro­du­ced Ka­di­ya: "First, this one is King's Da­ugh­ter out of the Gre­at Pla­ce. The­re has co­me much evil in­to our land. She has be­en sum­mo­ned by the Whi­te Lady of Noth that co­un­cil may be ta­ken."</p>
   <p>    The Nysso­mu ma­le who had po­led the punt put out his hand and bro­ught Ka­di­ya up on­to the plat­form to fa­ce the wo­man whom Jagun had gre­eted with such res­pect. Co­ur­tesy and cus­tom the girl had be­en dril­led in, but one ne­eded a for­mal ro­be in which to ma­ke a pro­per curt­sey. Ins­te­ad she has­tily imp­ro­vi­sed with the ges­tu­re she had se­en used by one of the Od­dling wo­men of Tre­vis­ta to anot­her. Pla­cing the palms of her hands to­get­her, she inc­li­ned her he­ad for­ward.</p>
   <p>    "I, Ka­di­ya, da­ugh­ter of King Kra­in, do wish all well in this kin­hold."</p>
   <p>    To her re­li­ef the wo­man rep­li­ed with a ges­tu­re Ka­di­ya did know - hol­ding out her own hand palm up. Ka­di­ya qu­ickly fit­ted her palm to it.</p>
   <p>    "Be at rest, King's Da­ugh­ter," the wo­man sa­id, with that wi­de­ning of the lips which was an Od­dling smi­le. Then she was qu­ickly so­ber aga­in. "True, the­re is de­ath ab­ro­ad, and all pra­ise to Tho­se We Do Not Na­me that you ha­ve co­me sa­fe to us. Tho­se who drown walk our land." She he­si­ta­ted be­fo­re she con­ti­nu­ed. "The­re is much which is dark-born ab­ro­ad. But to this kin­hold be free, King's Da­ugh­ter, and let us gi­ve gu­est aid."</p>
   <p>    The in­te­ri­or of the Nysso­mu ho­use was di­vi­ded in­to a se­ri­es of pa­ired ro­oms ope­ning off a hal­lway, and it ap­pe­ared to Ka­di­ya that each of the­se had be­en as­sig­ned to so­me spe­ci­al fa­mily or gro­up. The­re we­re no men to be se­en he­re, but by each do­or sto­od one or mo­re wo­men, all of whom bo­wed the­ir he­ads as Ka­di­ya and her hos­tess pas­sed. Then they ca­me to a do­or at hall's end and she did in­de­ed dis­co­ver that lu­xury, tho­ugh it might not be of the sa­me kind she was used to, was not unk­nown he­re.</p>
   <p>    She fo­und a car­ven tub (which by the lo­ok of it might ha­ve be­en bro­ught out of so­me ru­in) awa­iting her, fil­led with cle­ar wa­ter on which flo­ated vi­olet-blue pe­tals which she re­cog­ni­zed as one of the tra­de wa­res out of Tre­vis­ta. Crus­hed bet­we­en the hands and rub­bed ac­ross the skin the­se not only re­le­ased a las­ting frag­ran­ce but al­so lat­he­red in­to a cle­an­ser. Hap­pily, Ka­di­ya shed her clot­hes and got in­to the tub. She scrub­bed her­self with per­fu­med pe­tals and cle­an­sed her tang­led, gre­ase-plas­te­red ha­ir. Oh, how she re­lis­hed be­ing cle­an aga­in!</p>
   <p>    Her hos­tess had se­ated her­self on a bench ac­ross the ro­om, and one by one six ot­her Nysso­mu fe­ma­les, as imp­res­si­vely man­ne­red and dres­sed as she, ca­me in to jo­in her. So­me­how, Ka­di­ya did not find the­ir pre­sen­ce dis­con­cer­ting. The­re was in this pla­ce a fe­eling of calm and pe­ace which was li­ke a so­ot­hing balm of herbs la­id upon the raw wo­und of her im­me­di­ate past.</p>
   <p>    A yo­un­ger fe­ma­le bro­ught forth a long ro­be of very fi­nely wo­ven grass for Ka­di­ya to slip in­to. Her hos­tess aro­se then and ges­tu­red to a cus­hi­oned sto­ol. When Ka­di­ya se­ated her­self anot­her of the yo­ung wo­men bro­ught a tray on which dri­ed cor­fer rinds, fan­ci­ful­ly car­ved, we­re set out.</p>
   <p>    When all had be­en ser­ved and they held the­ir cups, the hos­tess til­ted hers a frac­ti­on so a drop or two drip­ped to the flo­or. The ot­hers fol­lo­wed her examp­le, as did Ka­di­ya, trying to be alert to any po­int of eti­qu­et­te which might bring the ap­pro­val of the­se pe­op­le. Many ti­mes at the Ci­ta­del she had be­en im­pa­ti­ent of ce­re­mony, so­me­ti­mes inat­ten­ti­ve eno­ugh to earn a re­bu­ke from her Mot­her; but now she re­ali­zed that she must in­de­ed fol­low any ges­tu­re which wo­uld ple­ase the Nysso­mu.</p>
   <p>    Her hos­tess to­ok a small sip from her cup and then held it out. Ka­di­ya qu­ickly fol­lo­wed her examp­le and they exc­han­ged cups which, aga­in fol­lo­wing her hos­tess's examp­le, Ka­di­ya emp­ti­ed. A warm fe­eling of re­la­xa­ti­on flo­wed thro­ugh her body.</p>
   <p>    "There is evil," her hos­tess bro­ke the si­len­ce. "Tho­se blo­od-eaters walk ab­ro­ad, and with them anot­her who is not of our co­untry and who can be­wil­der tho­ughts. We ha­ve had mes­sa­ges from down-ri­ver. Many of our pe­op­le ha­ve co­me out of Tre­vis­ta, for that pla­ce is now held by de­alers in de­ath. We ha­ve sent a mes­sa­ge to the Whi­te Lady of Noth. But as yet the­re has be­en no ans­wer…"</p>
   <p>    "First of the Ho­use," Ka­di­ya le­aned for­ward on her sto­ol, "tho­se who ha­ve in­va­ded Tre­vis­ta are ones who ha­ve lit­tle know­led­ge of the Mi­res. But they are or­de­red by an evil one le­ar­ned in the stran­ge arts, and one of his ser­vants tra­vels with the Skri­tek. Ho­we­ver, I do not be­li­eve that sol­di­ers used to the pla­ins of La­bor­nok can fight wit­hin Mi­re co­untry. Yo­ur pe­op­le who know all its twists and turns can su­rely go up aga­inst them and free this part of the land -"</p>
   <p>    But her hos­tess was sha­king her he­ad slowly. "King's Da­ugh­ter, it is not our cus­tom to wa­ge bat­tles aga­inst tho­se who co­me in­to our co­untry. We ha­ve our own de­fen­ses but we do not carry de­ath to ot­hers."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya bit her lip. So cle­arly had she se­en the chan­ce to harry the enemy for­ce, using the­se Nysso­mu who co­uld turn every trick and ter­ror of the co­untry­si­de aga­inst the enemy if only they wo­uld! De­ep in her an­ger gna­wed on­ce mo­re. But what co­uld she do? Im­pa­ti­en­ce had dri­ven her so many ti­mes in the past in­to so­me folly; but this ti­me the­re must be no mis­ta­kes ma­de if she co­uld help it.</p>
   <p>    She fin­ge­red her amu­let.</p>
   <p>    "The Lady of Noth," she sa­id ca­re­ful­ly, "has sum­mo­ned me. She has long be­en the Gu­ar­di­an of this land. Per­haps she will ha­ve an ans­wer."</p>
   <p>    The Nysso­mu wo­man nod­ded ap­pro­vingly. "That is right, King's Da­ugh­ter. Gre­ater than any ot­her li­ving she is, and mist­ress of many stran­ge po­wers. We shall gi­ve you what aid we can to re­ach her."</p>
   <p>    And with that Ka­di­ya had to be con­tent.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Fourteen</strong></p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    The me­lody pla­yed by the fip­ple flu­te was "The Rosy Sun­set Po­ol," one of Ha­ra­mis's fa­vo­ri­tes, a sad and so­aring bal­lad of a lo­nely ri­ver­man far from his ho­me and lo­ved ones. When the last sil­very no­te di­ed away in ec­ho­es among the fros­ted crags, the Prin­cess sa­id, "That was be­a­uti­ful in­de­ed, old fri­end."</p>
   <p>    "I wish I co­uld ha­ve pla­yed on," Uzun sa­id apo­lo­ge­ti­cal­ly, "but I am ha­ving dif­fi­culty mo­ving my fin­gers qu­ickly." He hud­dled mo­re de­eply in­to his fur-li­ned mant­le and ex­ten­ded his wet bo­ots clo­ser to the lit­tle camp­fi­re of twis­ted sticks. Night was fast ap­pro­ac­hing, brin­ging with it a cold wind from the gla­ci­ers abo­ve that cut ex­po­sed skin li­ke a kni­fe.</p>
   <p>    "Never mind, Uzun. I think if you had pla­yed lon­ger, I wo­uld ha­ve wept for me­lanc­holy. The ri­ver­man in the song at le­ast had the ho­pe of re­tur­ning to his fa­mily and ho­me­land, but for me the­re is no ho­me, and tho­se I lo­ved are de­ad."</p>
   <p>    "Mayhap not yo­ur sis­ters, my Prin­cess."</p>
   <p>    She lo­oked ac­ross the ble­ak, rocky slo­pe, be­yond the tor­rent of the Vis­par Ri­ver that they had fol­lo­wed hig­her and hig­her in­to the Oho­gan Ran­ge. Abo­ve sha­do­wed rid­ges, the ma­j­es­tic bulk of Mo­unt Ro­to­lo was tin­ged ruddy aga­inst the clo­ud-stre­aked eve­ning sky by the sun's af­terg­low.</p>
   <p>    "I pray that Ka­di­ya and Ani­gel still li­ve," Ha­ra­mis sa­id, "but you know as well as I that Ka­di­ya was pre­pa­ring to die bra­vely aga­inst overw­hel­ming odds when we par­ted. As for Ani­gel, I sho­uld not be surp­ri­sed to le­arn that she pe­ris­hed of fright!" She blin­ked back sud­den te­ars. "Po­or lit­tle idi­ots!" She for­ced her tho­ughts has­tily back to her cur­rent prob­lems. "And we may jo­in them so­on, if the­se wretc­hed tril­li­um se­eds le­ad us much hig­her in­to the mo­un­ta­ins. The­re is now al­most no wo­od for fi­res, no mo­re edib­le ro­ots or ber­ri­es. The­re are no fish in the ri­ver sin­ce it be­gan to run whi­te, and the wa­ter tas­tes odd. What is that pow­dery stuff in it, do you know?"</p>
   <p>    "It tas­tes li­ke rock to me," Uzun sa­id. "At any ra­te, if it we­re po­iso­no­us…"</p>
   <p>    "-we wo­uld be de­ad al­re­ady," Ha­ra­mis ag­re­ed. "But I still don't li­ke it. And I worry abo­ut you, Uzun; you sho­uld not be up he­re in the cold. It can­not be go­od for you; yo­ur body was not me­ant to dwell he­re."</p>
   <p>    "I'm per­fectly well!" Uzun pro­tes­ted. "All I ne­ed is to be war­med up a bit and ha­ve my bo­ots dri­ed out."</p>
   <p>    "But they'll be so­aked thro­ugh all over aga­in, on­ce we set out slog­ging thro­ugh patc­hes of wet snow to­mor­row," Ha­ra­mis po­in­ted out. "My blo­od runs war­mer than yo­urs, Uzun, and I can be­ar it. But you are Nysso­mu, born to dwell in the warmth of the Mi­re. I ha­ve se­en yo­ur fa­ce grow mo­re and mo­re grey with pa­in all thro­ug­ho­ut this day, and yo­ur steps are slo­wer."</p>
   <p>    "I am hol­ding you back," he mur­mu­red mi­se­rably.</p>
   <p>    "That's not im­por­tant, I am in no hurry to fre­eze to de­ath, God knows! But I think it un­li­kely that you will get bet­ter: Mo­re li­kely you will be­co­me wor­se as it gets col­der."</p>
   <p>    She ro­se from her pla­ce be­si­de the fi­re, yan­ked off her fur-li­ned mit­tens, and be­gan to re­mo­ve his wet bo­ots. "We must get the­se off, they will ne­ver dry whi­le on yo­ur fe­et."</p>
   <p>    "No, no - I must ser­ve <emphasis>you</emphasis>! Ne­ver you ser­ve <emphasis>me</emphasis>!"</p>
   <p>    "Be si­lent," she com­man­ded, with mock stern­ness. When she had strip­ped off his bo­ots and soggy felt li­ners and the in­ner wad­ding of grass -insu­la­ting when dry, but re­du­ced now to a use­less mess that clung to his ta­lo­ned to­es - she pul­led her warm mit­tens on­to his fe­et li­ke slip­pers. Then she set out his fo­ot­ge­ar ca­re­ful­ly so that the fi­re's me­ager he­at wo­uld pe­net­ra­te them, and ga­ve him a drink from the small, so­ot-blac­ke­ned crock that they used to brew dar­ci tea.</p>
   <p>    The el­derly Od­dling ut­te­red a de­ep sigh. "That fe­els so much bet­ter. But you sho­uld not ha­ve de­me­aned yo­ur­self-"</p>
   <p>    She pres­sed one fin­ger to his lips, si­len­cing him. "Now lis­ten to me, Uzun. I ha­ve tho­ught on this mat­ter most ca­re­ful­ly, and I ha­ve ma­de up my mind. My wish is that you now turn back, ha­ving ac­com­pa­ni­ed me as far as you are ab­le, whi­le I con­ti­nue on alo­ne."</p>
   <p>    "No! No!" he cri­ed, spil­ling tea in his agi­ta­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "Did I not say my mind is ma­de up?" she sa­id. "We know that we ha­ve ne­arly re­ac­hed that part of the mo­un­ta­ins whe­re no li­ving thing- sa­ve per­haps the fab­led Eyes in the Whirl­wind - can long sur­vi­ve. Our fo­od is ne­arly go­ne and the­re is no chan­ce of get­ting mo­re. So­on not even the dwarf tre­es will be ab­le to grow, and the­re will be no fi­re­wo­od. If I am a per­son of high des­tiny, as the Whi­te Lady sa­id, then we can as­su­me that the Lords of the Air will shel­ter and sus­ta­in me so­me­how or ot­her as I fol­low the tril­li­um se­eds. But you, my de­ar fri­end, must turn back. The qu­est is mi­ne, and I must ful­fill it alo­ne. The Arc­hi­ma­ge told me that. Did she not tell you al­so that you must le­ave me be­fo­re the end of my jo­ur­ney?"</p>
   <p>    Uzun bo­wed his he­ad wit­ho­ut spe­aking. He wi­ped his stre­aming eyes on his sle­eve, then sip­ped slowly from the­ir com­mu­nal tea crock.</p>
   <p>    "If you turn back now," Ha­ra­mis con­ti­nu­ed, "you can be out of the snow­fi­elds wit­hin half a day. Anot­her day will see you in the fer­ti­le por­ti­on of the Vis­par Ri­ver, whe­re gar­su and ot­her fish abo­und, and the­re are plenty of ri­pe and no­uris­hing ber­ri­es, and the nights are frost-free. You can fol­low the ri­ver so­uth­ward un­til you en­co­un­ter fri­endly Uis­gu, and they will be­ar you in the­ir bo­ats to Tre­vis­ta and yo­ur kin."</p>
   <p>    "But how can I le­ave you all alo­ne? The Tri­une knows that I am a wretc­hed out­do­ors­man, but you - for­gi­ve me, Prin­cess! -you are even less com­pe­tent to sur­vi­ve in this wil­der­ness than I!"</p>
   <p>    "I ne­ed no spe­ci­al sur­vi­val skills now. The­re are no mo­re fish to gut, no mo­re bog-varts to sna­re, no mo­re wild plant-fo­ods to se­arch out or pre­pa­re. The fo­od that re­ma­ins in my pack will ke­ep me from star­ving for a lit­tle whi­le, and I know eno­ugh to let the se­di­ment set­tle from the ri­ver wa­ter be­fo­re drin­king it. I can climb rocks with fa­ir agi­lity-I've cer­ta­inly had eno­ugh prac­ti­ce la­tely-and the se­eds will un­do­ub­tedly find me dry dens to bed down in for a few mo­re days, at le­ast, un­til the en­ti­re lands­ca­pe is co­ve­red with de­ep snow. If I ha­ve not co­me to my go­al by then…" She shrug­ged. "Well, per­haps the Eyes in the Whirl­wind will ta­ke pity on me and ta­ke me to one of the fab­led gre­en val­leys of the high Oho­gans, whe­re the Vis­pi are sa­id to dwell among hot springs, and flo­wers blo­om whi­le the bliz­zards pass harm­less over­he­ad."</p>
   <p>    Uzun sa­id in a low, tho­ught­ful vo­ice: "Truly, I did won­der whet­her the Whi­te Lady had set us on the path to so­me such pla­ce."</p>
   <p>    "What do you know of the Vis­pi?"</p>
   <p>    "They ne­ver co­me out of the mo­un­ta­ins. They tra­de pre­ci­o­us me­tals and gems­to­nes to the Uis­gu, and the­se are pas­sed to the Nysso­mu, and then­ce ma­ke the­ir way to hu­man­kind, eit­her at the Tre­vis­ta Fa­ir, or at the smal­ler mar­kets of the Dylex vil­la­ges. They ta­ke in tra­de ma­inly do­mes­tic ani­mals -espe­ci­al­ly the mo­re rug­ged kind of vo­lum­ni­al, to­gars, and nunc­hiks with furry co­ats. They al­so cra­ve salt and all kinds of swe­ets - wa­ter-bee ho­ney is the ma­ins­tay of Uis­gu tra­de with them - and a few ot­her pro­ducts."</p>
   <p>    "What do they lo­ok li­ke?"</p>
   <p>    "No Nysso­mu has se­en one and li­ved, for the­ir lands are for­bid­den to swamp Folk."</p>
   <p>    "Since you wo­uld ob­vi­o­usly fre­eze to de­ath be­fo­re you re­ac­hed them," Ha­ra­mis mut­te­red, "that ma­kes sen­se."</p>
   <p>    Uzun con­ti­nu­ed: "The gras­sland Folk, the Uis­gu, say that Vis­pi are tal­ler than men but mo­re slen­der. They <emphasis>are</emphasis> of the Folk, for they be­ar the­ir yo­ung in a fi­nis­hed sta­te of body, rat­her than as ra­ve­no­us lar­vae, as the wretc­hed Skri­tek do. The Eyes in the Whirl­wind, tho­se gu­ar­di­ans of the mo­un­ta­in pas­ses that on­ce hel­ped ke­ep our land sa­fe from in­va­si­on-they are sa­id to be­long to the Vis­pi, and to ser­ve the Whi­te Lady."</p>
   <p>    Haramis sa­id: "So­me of our hill-fort gu­ards told ta­les of Vis­pi dan­cing on new­fal­len snow. They we­re sa­id to be be­a­uti­ful."</p>
   <p>    "They are al­so sa­id to be the ol­dest of Folk. But no one re­al­ly knows. Our ta­le-tel­lers say that they li­ve in de­ep val­leys in the flanks of Mo­unt Ro­to­lo, Mo­unt Gid­ris, and Mo­unt Brom. The­re, hot springs and ste­aming ri­vers are sup­po­sed to flow, mo­de­ra­ting the ter­rib­le cold and bar­re­ness, so that plants may grow. And the­re are ice-ca­ves ro­und abo­ut the Vis­pi lands that slowly thaw, gi­ving forth jewels and nug­gets of gold and pla­ti­num as well as ba­ser sto­nes, and the­se are was­hed down­hill by the mo­un­ta­in tor­rents. So­me of tho­se ice-ca­ves are sa­id to ha­ve be­lon­ged to the Va­nis­hed Ones, and very ra­rely, one of the­ir an­ci­ent de­vi­ces will be of­fe­red by the Vis­pi in tra­de."</p>
   <p>    "How fas­ci­na­ting," Ha­ra­mis mur­mu­red. She prod­ded the fi­re with the iron-shod tip of her wal­king-staff, mo­ving un­bur­ned por­ti­ons of twigs on­to the scanty pi­le of glo­wing co­als. For many mi­nu­tes she was si­lent. Then she sa­id sud­denly, "Uzun, will you try to scry for me?"</p>
   <p>    "For yo­ur sis­ters?"</p>
   <p>    "No, not them. The Vis­pi."</p>
   <p>    He gas­ped. "I - I can but try. If they are truly Folk, they don?t ha­ve auras, as ot­her na­tu­ral be­ings do."</p>
   <p>    She po­in­ted word­les­sly at the tea-crock, which still had a fin­ger­width of dark li­qu­id re­ma­ining in its bot­tom. Uzun nod­ded and to­ok it up. He swir­led the tea in the bowl, ca­using it to ro­ta­te fas­ter and fas­ter whi­le he sta­red in­to the small vor­tex. Then his body stif­fe­ned, and his ga­ze be­ca­me fi­xed and un­fo­cu­sed, and be­ads of oily swe­at ma­de his fo­re­he­ad shi­ne.</p>
   <p>    Haramis wa­ited. The rosy glow that had suf­fu­sed the snowy pe­aks fa­ded to grey. The sky, which had be­en clo­ud­less thro­ug­ho­ut the days of the­ir jo­ur­ne­ying, now sho­wed a few long pe­arly stre­amers of cir­rus re­ac­hing forth from the so­uth, the har­bin­gers of the win­ter mon­so­on. So­me ye­ars the storms ca­me early. If this sho­uld hap­pen, she was cer­ta­inly do­omed…</p>
   <p>    "Movis," Uzun whis­pe­red.</p>
   <p>    Startled, Ha­ra­mis grip­ped his sho­ul­der. "Ha­ve you se­en so­met­hing?"</p>
   <p>    "Movis," he re­pe­ated. His gre­at gol­den eyes lo­oked in­to hers as he ca­me to him­self and slowly set down the tea-crock. "The na­me of the­ir gre­at set­tle­ment is Mo­vis, and it li­es abo­ve us and to the west."</p>
   <p>    "Did you scry it cle­arly?" she de­man­ded, her fa­ce alight with ex­ci­te­ment. "How far from he­re is it?"</p>
   <p>    "I can't tell that, I only know that it is the­re, so­mew­he­re in that di­rec­ti­on. The Vis­pi are ab­le to hi­de it comp­le­tely from se­arc­hers if they wish, but I bes­po­ke yo­ur na­me, and they gran­ted me a mo­men­tary vi­ew of Mo­vis… and sa­id that they awa­it you."</p>
   <p>    Haramis felt her he­art po­un­ding. Her ba­re hand went in­to her tu­nic and to­ok hold of the warm am­ber amu­let nest­ling aga­inst her skin. Mo­vis! A re­al pla­ce, not so­me fe­ver-dre­am of the dying Arc­hi­ma­ge! It was not, af­ter all, a fo­ol's cha­se the win­ged se­eds led her on, but a true qu­est. Or so she co­uld ho­pe…</p>
   <p>    To Uzun, she sa­id: "You ha­ve ser­ved me well. This scrying of yo­urs gi­ves me re­ne­wed con­fi­den­ce, whe­re be­fo­re I had only un­cer­ta­inty. I con­fess to you, Uzun, I had be­gun to fe­ar that the Whi­te Lady was only a sick and de­lu­ded witch, sen­ding me to cer­ta­in de­ath."</p>
   <p>    "Movis is not clo­se by," the lit­tle mu­si­ci­an sa­id, worry cre­asing his brow. "It is su­rely se­ve­ral mo­re days' jo­ur­ney away, over the most rug­ged sort of ter­ra­in."</p>
   <p>    "My se­eds will gu­ide me," she told him, smi­ling. "I will find the pla­ce, ne­ver fe­ar, and the Vis­pi li­ving the­re will su­rely help me on my qu­est for the Three Win­ged Circ­le."</p>
   <p>    "They se­emed to bes­pe­ak me with go­od will," Uzun ad­mit­ted. He wrig­gled his fe­et, still en­ve­lo­ped in Ha­ra­mis's furry mit­tens, and the con­cern eb­bed slowly from his fa­ce. "Per­haps everyt­hing will be all right, af­ter all." He yaw­ned, then has­tily beg­ged the Prin­cess's par­don.</p>
   <p>    She only la­ug­hed. "You are right, be­yond a do­ubt. And whi­le I shall miss yo­ur de­ar fa­ce and yo­ur mu­sic, you will ser­ve me best by tur­ning back. You can be­gin to turn this jo­ur­ney in­to a bal­lad, to be sung when I am Qu­e­en in Ru­wen­da. In­de­ed, from the way you spe­ak at ti­mes, you ap­pe­ar to be wor­king on it al­re­ady."</p>
   <p>    "Very well," Uzun sig­hed. "I shall turn back. You will cer­ta­inly tra­vel much fas­ter wit­ho­ut me. I can le­ave you with a ligh­ter he­art, ho­ping that the Vis­pi ha­ve be­en com­man­ded by the Arc­hi­ma­ge to as­sist you. And as I tra­vel so­uth, I will now and aga­in try to scry you out, and thus re­as­su­re myself of yo­ur sa­fety."</p>
   <p>    "Of co­ur­se you shall," Ha­ra­mis sa­id. She to­ok up his bo­ots and felt socks, which we­re now ne­arly dry. "Tuck the­se in the bot­tom of yo­ur sle­ep-sack and they will fi­nish drying whi­le you rest."</p>
   <p>    She hel­ped him to slip in­to the downy bag, and he cur­led up with his back aga­inst a lar­ge rock on the op­po­si­te si­de of the fi­re. Even be­fo­re Ha­ra­mis had la­id out her own sle­ep sack and drunk up the dregs of the tea, he was as­le­ep and sno­ring.</p>
   <p>    She ti­di­ed up the camp­si­te, then went slowly down to the stre­am. Ho­arf­rost was al­re­ady for­ming on the ba­re rocks, and patc­hes of snow among the sharp crags glim­me­red in the twi­light. She half-fil­led the­ir lar­gest wa­ters­kin, flinc­hing at the icy to­uch of the ri­ver. By mor­ning, af­ter fre­ezing and tha­wing, the grey mud sus­pen­ded wit­hin the wa­ter wo­uld set­tle, and the wa­ter wo­uld be fit to drink.</p>
   <p>    At her fe­et, so­met­hing twink­led, and she saw it was a tiny po­ol ref­lec­ting a sing­le star. A per­fect scrying ves­sel…</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Could I per­form such ma­gic myself? For that mat­ter, is scrying truly ma­gic or is it a men­tal skill, li­ke the spe­ech wit­ho­ut words the Od­dlings use? I won­der if I can scry my sis­ters… I know that they may well be de­ad, but I don't fe­el that they are. Of co­ur­se, even if I can't see them, it pro­ved not­hing. Sup­po­se the Arc­hi­ma­ge set so­me bar­ri­er abo­ut the three of us</emphasis>-<emphasis>a sort of con­ce­aling spell</emphasis>-<emphasis>to frust­ra­te La­bor­no­ki adepts such as Oro­gas­tus who wo­uld se­ek us out in or­der to kill us? But per­haps if I se­arc­hed for my sis­ters, who­se des­tiny is sa­id to be lin­ked with mi­ne, the bar­ri­er wo­uld not stop me… It can't hurt to try</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    She knelt abo­ve the lit­tle po­ol, ca­re­ful not to blot out the light of the star, and sa­id a bri­ef pra­yer. Then she swept all tho­ught from her mind, let her only re­ality be the fa­int sil­ver spark on the wa­ter, and the ima­gi­ned fa­ce of her sis­ter Ka­di­ya.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Kadi… Ka­di… Do you li­ve? Let me see you!</emphasis></p>
   <p>    A smi­le. A rich scent of per­fu­med wa­ter, so­ap bub­bles, rus­set ha­ir af­lo­at -</p>
   <p>    Then not­hing.</p>
   <p>    Haramis sat back on her he­els. For a mo­ment, for the me­rest flic­ker of a se­cond, she had se­emed to grasp cer­ta­in elu­si­ve ima­ges. But the­re was no true vi­si­on of Ka­di, only tho­se scraps of sen­sa­ti­on, ha­ving no so­ur­ce, su­rely, sa­ve her own ima­gi­na­ti­on, over-shar­pe­ned by fa­ti­gue.</p>
   <p>    She sig­hed. Well, she had not ex­pec­ted to suc­ce­ed. Scrying was an Od­dling ta­lent, not one hu­mans pos­ses­sed. She was a per­fect idi­ot to squ­at he­re half-fre­ezing be­si­de a mo­un­ta­in ri­ver when she co­uld be nest­led in her sle­ep-sack, whe­re such fan­ci­es be­lon­ged. Sig­hing, she trud­ged up­hill to bed.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    The Uis­gu bo­at sped along by the light of the Trip­le Mo­ons, and Ani­gel awo­ke with a smot­he­red gasp. She had had the dre­am of dro­ught and fi­re aga­in, for the fo­urth night run­ning, and her body was clammy and stiff with ter­ror be­ne­ath the plant-down sle­ep-sack that Im­mu had tuc­ked aro­und her. Damn the dre­am! It was so stu­pid to li­ve that pa­in­ful un­re­ality over and over. She to­ok hold of the tril­li­um amu­let on the cha­in aro­und her neck. It felt warm aga­inst her icy palm as she as­ked why her sec­ret self had sent the wretc­hed night­ma­re yet aga­in. She knew what it me­ant! She had fa­ced her short­co­mings and pro­mi­sed to be bra­ve, hadn't she? Why did the phan­toms per­sist in tor­men­ting her? It wasn't fa­ir!</p>
   <p>    Screwing up her de­ter­mi­na­ti­on, she pus­hed the fe­ar­ful dre­am-me­mo­ri­es asi­de and con­cent­ra­ted on the he­re and now.</p>
   <p>    She was mo­ving along in a wa­terc­raft that was po­in­ted at both ends and abo­ut the sa­me length as the Nysso­mu punts; but ins­te­ad of be­ing car­ved from a ka­la-log it was fas­hi­oned from long bund­les of re­eds, tightly pla­ited to­get­her li­ke a gre­at bas­ket and co­ated in­si­de with so­me hard subs­tan­ce. The two ri­mo­riks that ha­uled the Uis­gu bo­at we­re stre­am­li­ned fur­red cre­atu­res lar­ger than a man, with sle­ek he­ads, enor­mo­us black eyes, and web­bed paws with for­mi­dab­le claws. The­ir bo­di­es we­re dap­ple-gre­en and the­ir only vo­ice was a hiss. They did not li­ke hu­mans and had ba­red the­ir tusks when Ani­gel tri­ed to ma­ke fri­ends with them. The cre­atu­res we­re hitc­hed to the bo­at by me­ans of a do­ub­le har­ness at­tac­hed to the stem, and the Uis­gu dri­vers, who­se na­mes we­re Lebb and Ti­rebb, cont­rol­led the­ir aqu­atic ste­eds by me­ans of re­ins run­ning thro­ugh rings on each si­de of the bow. Ani­gel was ob­li­ged to ri­de and sle­ep on a lit­tle pal­let in the bo­at's nar­row stern, so as not to up­set the ri­mo­riks with her hu­man aura. They stop­ped every six ho­urs or so to exc­han­ge the­ir ti­red be­asts for fresh ones at a Uis­gu vil­la­ge and al­low the two dri­vers to spell one anot­her.</p>
   <p>    The stran­ge co­untry of the Gol­den­mi­re, which they had tra­ve­led thro­ugh for the past three days, was bla­zing hot du­ring the day­ti­me. Very few na­ti­ve ani­mals we­re in evi­den­ce ex­cept for den­se flocks of birds, ga­uzy-win­ged fli­es - so­me with a wings­pan of half an ell - and myri­ads of fish. The sharp-edged gras­ses of­ten grew to twi­ce Ani­gel's he­ight and we­re crow­ned by fe­at­hery gol­den-yel­low flo­wer pa­nic­les.</p>
   <p>    At first the­ir bo­at fol­lo­wed a con­vo­lu­ted nar­row chan­nel thro­ugh a very den­se re­gi­on of the gla­de north of Tre­vis­ta, twis­ting and tur­ning every which way un­til Ani­gel lost all sen­se of di­rec­ti­on. On the­ir se­cond day of tra­vel they pas­sed in­to co­untry whe­re the grass was shor­ter and the wa­ter­ways less dis­tinct. The ri­mo­riks then simply swam stra­ight ahe­ad thro­ugh the track­less sub­mer­ged pra­irie, and the bo­at swis­hed along over the grass as tho­ugh it we­re on a gre­ased ro­ad­way, hardly to­uc­hing the wa­ter.</p>
   <p>    Their stop­ping pla­ces we­re al­ways small ele­va­ted is­lands thickly overg­rown with hard­wo­od tre­es and shrubs la­den with all sorts of flo­wers and fru­its. The­re the shy Uis­gu had the­ir small vil­la­ges, whe­re they sub­sis­ted upon raw fish, the abun­dant wild pro­du­ce, and a "sac­red" brown be­ve­ra­ge na­med mi­ton, the na­tu­re of which Im­mu re­fu­sed to exp­la­in at the sa­me ti­me that she for­ba­de Ani­gel to samp­le it. Un­li­ke the Nysso­mu, the Uis­gu did not use fi­re. They dwelt in grass huts wo­ven in the sa­me mas­si­ve bas­ketry style as the­ir bo­ats, mo­un­ted on stilts for sa­fety's sa­ke du­ring the mon­so­on-se­ason flo­ods. The Folk we­re much smal­ler than the­ir Nysso­mu kin, and wo­re not­hing ex­cept for gol­den jewelry set with gems, which they ob­ta­ined in tra­de from the Vis­pi of the nort­hern mo­un­ta­ins, and a short, kilt li­ke gar­ment. Aro­und the­ir prot­ru­ding eyes we­re pa­in­ted co­lo­red rings, and the ba­re chests of the ma­les we­re ador­ned with a pa­in­ted de­sign of three circ­les in­ter­loc­ked at a cen­ter po­int. The­ir bo­di­es we­re mostly co­ve­red in short ha­ir, lub­ri­ca­ted with a he­avy oil ha­ving a po­wer­ful musky smell. Ani­gel hardly no­ti­ced the odor now; but when she had first met the two Uis­gu bo­at­men, Lebb and Ti­rebb, back at the ho­me of the Dis­cer­ner, she had had to cont­rol her re­vul­si­on at the­ir slimy hand-sha­ke. No won­der cer­ta­in cru­de Ru­wen­di­ans re­fer­red to the lit­tle Od­dlings as Slip­pery De­vils! The bo­at­men and Im­mu co­uld ba­rely un­ders­tand one anot­her's di­alect, but the­re was not much ne­ed for con­ver­sa­ti­on. The two Uis­gu knew very well whe­re the ru­ined city of Noth lay, and they had pro­mi­sed Fro­lo­tu to con­duct the Prin­cess and Im­mu the­re as qu­ickly as pos­sib­le.</p>
   <p>    After dark, when the stars abo­ve the pra­irie we­re unobs­cu­red by mist and se­emed twi­ce as bright as nor­mal, the Gol­den­mi­re had an orc­hest­ra of night-so­unds comp­le­tely dif­fe­rent from tho­se of the Lo­wer Mu­tar or Tre­vis­ta. No lar­ge ani­mals how­led or ro­ared out he­re in the vast tre­eless re­gi­on; ins­te­ad, the swamp no­ises we­re per­cus­si­ve and synco­pa­ted, li­ke hund­reds of tiny drums, all with dif­fe­rent pitc­hes, pla­ying an ever chan­ging me­lody ac­com­pan­ying the hiss of the bo­at thro­ugh the sea of grass. The so­und was hypno­tic, and Ani­gel felt her­self do­zing off aga­in.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>No dre­ams, no dre­ams</emphasis>, she beg­ged fe­ebly, let­ting ob­li­vi­on cla­im her. And when she awo­ke the bo­at had stop­ped, and she felt gre­atly ref­res­hed, and it was dawn.</p>
   <p>    Three pe­cu­li­ar lit­tle fa­ces we­re sta­ring at her over the gun­wa­le, the­ir exp­res­si­ons both fas­ci­na­ted and hor­ri­fi­ed. They had a fa­mi­li­al re­semb­lan­ce to the Nysso­mu, but the­ir ups­tan­ding ears we­re pro­por­ti­onal­ly lar­ger, as we­re the­ir sharp te­eth, and the­ir he­ads and necks and che­eks we­re co­ve­red with slick, oily fur. The eyes of one we­re rin­ged with yel­low pa­int; the ot­hers wo­re eye-pa­int of pink and och­re.</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess ga­ve a squ­e­ak of surp­ri­se and the three fa­ces drop­ped down out of sight.</p>
   <p>    "Oh, I'm sorry," she sa­id softly. "Don't be af­ra­id, lit­tle Uis­gu. I know that I lo­ok ugly and gi­gan­tic to you, but I won't hurt you."</p>
   <p>    First one he­ad re­ap­pe­ared, and then the ot­her two. They we­re no lar­ger than the he­ads of hu­man ba­bi­es. The Uis­gu child­ren con­ver­sed among them­sel­ves in an agi­ta­ted twit­ter, ob­vi­o­usly ar­gu­ing abo­ut the na­tu­re of the mons­ter they had fo­und as­le­ep in a bo­at on the­ir be­ach.</p>
   <p>    "It's qu­ite all right," Ani­gel re­as­su­red them. She held up the tril­li­um amu­let on its cha­in - and sud­denly everyt­hing se­emed to be exp­la­ined.</p>
   <p>    The three yo­ung Uis­gu ut­te­red a joyo­us trill and sho­wed the­ir di­mi­nu­ti­ve fangs in wi­de grins. They craw­led up on­to the gun­wa­le and wo­uld ha­ve clim­bed right in­to the bo­at with her, but she la­ug­hed and told them: "No, no. Ple­ase sit the­re whi­le I get dres­sed. Then you can ta­ke me to yo­ur vil­la­ge. I sup­po­se Im­mu and Lebb and Ti­rebb ha­ve go­ne the­re al­re­ady to ar­ran­ge for fresh ri­mo­riks, le­aving me he­re to slug-abed!"</p>
   <p>    She pus­hed asi­de the sle­ep sack and sat up, slip­ping a soft, wo­ven-grass ro­be over her shift. She had worn Fro­lo­tu's gift of abo­ri­gi­nal clot­hing with re­luc­tan­ce at first; but the pa­le gre­en ro­be pro­ved to be much co­oler than her torn, dirty co­urt dress, and its long bell-sle­eves and amp­le ho­od pro­tec­ted her from the po­wer­ful sun of the open gras­sland. She had al­so dis­car­ded her ru­ined slip­pers in fa­vor of calf high bus­kins with sturdy san­dals strap­ped over them. The tra­ve­ling out­fit was comp­le­ted by a bra­ided fi­ber belt ha­ving a lar­ge le­at­her wal­let hung from it, in which the Prin­cess car­ri­ed her hand­kerc­hi­ef, comb, kni­fe, and a few ot­her ne­ces­si­ti­es.</p>
   <p>    One of the juve­ni­le Uis­gu had va­nis­hed from its perch on the ra­il. It now re­ap­pe­ared, gig­gling, and han­ded her a string of waxy whi­te flo­wers that exu­ded a spicy per­fu­me. Ani­gel than­ked the lit­tle cre­atu­re, for­med the flo­wers in­to a gar­land, and set the gift on her ha­ir. Then she clam­be­red out of the bo­at and fol­lo­wed the trio down a nar­row path.</p>
   <p>    The vil­la­ge was only a short dis­tan­ce away, and con­sis­ted of fi­ve huts on stilts and the usu­al open-air shel­ter bu­ilt at gro­und le­vel, whe­re the Uis­gu cus­to­ma­rily gat­he­red to so­ci­ali­ze, con­fer, and pre­pa­re and eat me­als du­ring the dry se­ason. Im­mu and the bo­at­men Lebb and Ti­rebb we­re be­ing ser­ved bre­ak­fast from the com­mu­nity pot. The vil­la­ge he­ad­man wel­co­med Ani­gel with a kindly but in­comp­re­hen­sib­le spe­ech and or­de­red that she be gi­ven fo­od al­so.</p>
   <p>    By now she was used to the chop­ped raw fish, which had be­en ma­ri­na­ted in aci­dic fru­it ju­ice un­til it was whi­te, flaky, and very si­mi­lar in tex­tu­re to the co­oked kind. She al­so to­ok sli­ces of me­lon and a hand­ful of rich-fla­vo­red blok-nuts, but fol­lo­wed Im­mu's le­ad in po­li­tely dec­li­ning the sac­red mi­ton drink.</p>
   <p>    "These pe­op­le say that Noth is now only a few ho­urs away," Im­mu told the Prin­cess. "The sub­mer­ged part of the Gol­den­mi­re that the ri­mo­riks can swim thro­ugh co­mes to an end a few le­agu­es be­yond the vil­la­ge, whe­re the wa­ter be­co­mes very shal­low. We shall ha­ve to cut over to the Ri­ver Not­har, slightly to the east, and fol­low it for a ways in or­der to re­ach the ho­me of the Arc­hi­ma­ge. The Uis­gu do not usu­al­ly da­re to ap­pro­ach her dwel­ling wit­ho­ut in­vi­ta­ti­on, but I ha­ve exp­la­ined to them who you are and why the Whi­te Lady has sum­mo­ned you."</p>
   <p>    The he­ad­man, who was dis­tin­gu­is­hed from the ot­her eight adult ma­les of the vil­la­ge by the or­na­te­ness of his gol­den col­lar and bra­ce­lets, his kilt of glit­te­ring fish-sca­les, and the trip­le rings of whi­te pa­int aro­und his eyes, ap­pro­ac­hed the Prin­cess when she had fi­nis­hed eating and ha­ran­gu­ed her at so­me length in his own lan­gu­age. Ani­gel tri­ed not to flinch as his ta­lo­ned fin­gers lif­ted the tril­li­um amu­let that hung at her thro­at and disp­la­yed it to his pe­op­le.</p>
   <p>    The lit­tle band of Uis­gu ut­te­red a low, mar­ve­ling cry that was cut short by the chat­te­ring of the three child­ren, who we­re no do­ubt in­for­ming the­ir el­ders that they had re­cog­ni­zed Ani­gel al­re­ady.</p>
   <p>    "These Uis­gu who li­ve in the wes­tern part of the Mazy Mi­re ke­ep in clo­se men­tal con­tact with the­ir fel­lows," Im­mu sa­id to the Prin­cess in a low vo­ice. "This he­ad­man says that you are not the only Pe­tal of the Tril­li­um en ro­ute to Noth. The­re is anot­her - be­yond a do­ubt yo­ur sis­ter Ka­di­ya-who has sur­vi­ved the pe­rils of the Black­mi­re. She and her com­pa­ni­on - this must be Jagun - ha­ve re­ac­hed a Nysso­mu vil­la­ge ne­ar the conf­lu­en­ce of the Not­har Ri­ver and the Up­per Mu­tar."</p>
   <p>    "How won­der­ful!" Ani­gel exc­la­imed. "We can wa­it at Noth for her to ar­ri­ve!"</p>
   <p>    Immu's exp­res­si­on was du­bi­o­us. "That is for the Arc­hi­ma­ge to de­ci­de."</p>
   <p>    The he­ad­man spo­ke aga­in, this ti­me ges­tu­ring to­ward the nort­hern sky and frow­ning, then wi­ping the palms of his hands on his ha­iry flanks in an in­di­ca­ti­on of ext­re­me di­sap­pro­val.</p>
   <p>    "By the Flo­wer!" Im­mu mut­te­red. "He says that a <emphasis>third</emphasis> per­son we­aring the tril­li­um amu­let set out from Noth over a we­ek ago, mo­ving north­ward in­to the fo­ot­hil­ls and then as­cen­ding in­to the snow­fi­elds of the high Oho­gan Mo­un­ta­ins. He says that this per­son is - is very un­wi­se to en­ter this ter­ri­tory, which the Vis­pi ha­ve dec­la­red for­bid­den to all ot­her ra­ces upon pa­in of de­ath."</p>
   <p>    "He can only be spe­aking of Ha­ra­mis!" Ani­gel exc­la­imed. "And she wo­uld only go whe­re the Whi­te Lady sent her! But how co­uld she - "</p>
   <p>    "Hush," Im­mu war­ned her. "Say no mo­re." She ga­ve a small spe­ech of thanks to the vil­la­gers, then in­di­ca­ted to Lebb and Ti­rebb that it was ti­me for them to be off. A pa­ir of fresh ri­mo­riks had al­re­ady be­en har­nes­sed up.</p>
   <p>    The he­ad­man po­li­tely bar­red the­ir way. Gi­ving a curt or­der, he re­ce­ived from one of the Uis­gu fe­ma­les a small stop­pe­red drin­king go­urd that had be­en sta­ined a bright red and enc­lo­sed in a knot­ted car­rying net. This he so­lemnly pre­sen­ted to Ani­gel.</p>
   <p>    "Is it mi­ton?" the Prin­cess whis­pe­red to Im­mu.</p>
   <p>    "Yes. And this ti­me you will ha­ve to ta­ke it, for it is a spe­ci­al gift that they ra­rely ma­ke to non-Uis­gu - much less to hu­mans. Thanks be to the Lords of the Air that they do not de­mand that you drink it down…"</p>
   <p>    Anigel bo­wed her he­ad and than­ked the Folk in her own ton­gue. They se­emed to un­ders­tand. One wi­ze­ned lit­tle Od­dling granny trot­ted af­ter them as they wal­ked back to the bo­at, pat­ting Ani­gel's sho­ul­der and po­in­ting aga­in and aga­in to the go­urd with an en­co­ura­ging smi­le.</p>
   <p>    "Miton!" she sa­id. "Mi­ton! Mi­ton ka po­ru ti!"</p>
   <p>    They clim­bed in­to the bo­at, the Uis­gu dri­vers at the bow, Im­mu and Ani­gel in the­ir usu­al pla­ces in the stern. As they drew away from the is­land the vil­la­gers on sho­re ra­ised the­ir hands in fa­re­well. The squ­e­aky vo­ice of the mat­ron sho­uted one last ti­me: "Mi­ton ka po­ru ti!"</p>
   <p>    "What do her words me­an?" Ani­gel as­ked Im­mu. She held the go­urd in her lap, exa­mi­ning the cu­ri­o­us knots of the mesh that enc­lo­sed it.</p>
   <p>    "She says, 'Mi­ton gi­ves strength and co­ura­ge,' " Im­mu trans­la­ted re­luc­tantly. "This is why they call it a sac­red drink."</p>
   <p>    "But that's won­der­ful!" the Prin­cess exc­la­imed in re­li­ef. "I'll ha­ve so­me right now, for I con­fess that the pros­pect of me­eting the Whi­te Lady at last sca­res me wit­less."</p>
   <p>    Immu tur­ned away. As if spe­aking to her­self, she sa­id: "The­re is bet­we­en the ri­mo­riks and the Uis­gu a stran­ge symbi­osis whe­reby each aids and che­ris­hes the ot­her. The pe­op­le and the be­asts are fri­ends of the he­art, not mas­ters and do­mes­tic ani­mals. The ri­mo­riks are strong and co­ura­ge­o­us, whi­le the we­aker Uis­gu ha­ve gre­ater in­tel­li­gen­ce. The­ir bon­ding is con­ti­nu­al­ly re­in­for­ced by me­ans of the mi­ton, which both drink… and in it is ming­led the blo­od of both spe­ci­es."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess sat as if tur­ned to sto­ne. One hand had go­ne ins­tinc­ti­vely to her amu­let.</p>
   <p>    "I can­not say," Im­mu conc­lu­ded, "whet­her this drink gi­ves co­ura­ge or not. My pe­op­le, the Nysso­mu, ge­ne­ral­ly vi­ew it with dre­ad. Tho­se few of us who ha­ve da­red to ta­ke it -the ri­mo­rik dri­vers among us - be­co­me a bre­ed apart. Cer­ta­inly the­re is so­me strong ma­gic in it, but you wo­uld be wi­se to turn this gift over to the Arc­hi­ma­ge, or at le­ast con­sult her abo­ut its po­ten­ti­al."</p>
   <p>    "I -I will," sa­id the girl. She sat for a long ti­me wit­ho­ut spe­aking, sta­ring now at the scar­let go­urd and then at the lands­ca­pe ahe­ad, whe­re mo­un­ta­ins had be­gun to lo­om aga­inst the nort­hern ho­ri­zon.</p>
   <p>    After ne­arly an ho­ur had pas­sed, Ani­gel tur­ned to Im­mu and smi­led. "Only the Lords of the Air know whet­her this mi­ton drink ac­tu­al­ly stif­fens the back­bo­ne of one who drinks it. But a stran­ge thing has hap­pe­ned… By simply sit­ting her and hol­ding it, I ha­ve over­co­me my fe­ar of me­eting the Whi­te Lady. And that is ma­gic eno­ugh for now."</p>
   <p>    The ru­ins of Noth, alt­ho­ugh ex­ten­si­ve, had much less gran­de­ur than Tre­vis­ta's, and Ani­gel was so­mew­hat di­sap­po­in­ted. The Uis­gu bo­at bro­ught them thro­ugh an area of de­re­lict and overg­rown sto­ne bu­il­dings to a la­go­on all clog­ged with rank-smel­ling yel­low pur­se-flo­wers, stuf­fed to the sta­mens with put­ref­ying in­sect prey. They lan­ded at a surp­ri­singly tidy lit­tle dock. The slo­ping sho­re be­hind it was an ex­pan­se of short-clip­ped grass and ci­vi­li­zed flo­wer gar­dens that had be­en car­ved out of lu­xu­ri­ant jung­le growth. Long-nec­ked do­mes­ti­ca­ted to­gars wad­dled abo­ut, just as they wo­uld ha­ve do­ne in a fre­ehol­der's farm­yard on the Knoll, now and then nib­bling at the grass or so­me tid­bit. A few do­zen ells up­hill, at the he­ad of rus­tic flags­to­ne steps, sto­od a cot­ta­ge un­li­ke any that Ani­gel had ever se­en be­fo­re.</p>
   <p>    Its ro­of was a thick mo­und of dri­ed grass and its walls we­re whi­te-pa­in­ted plas­ter with the dark wo­oden fra­ming-be­ams vi­sib­le. The­re was a sto­ne chim­ney from which a small plu­me of smo­ke cur­led. The win­dows had lo­zen­ge-sha­ped le­aded pa­nes, and bo­xes at the sills hol­ding flo­wers, and the­re we­re wo­oden shut­ters that co­uld be clo­sed over the glass du­ring stormy we­at­her. The front do­or was cut right ac­ross the mid­dle - and only the bot­tom half was shut. Be­si­de it was a wic­ker bench with a small stri­ped furry ani­mal as­le­ep on it and a spin­ning whe­el with a bas­ket of fle­ece and a bowl full of yarn balls. The to­tal ef­fect was so char­ming and unth­re­ate­ning af­ter the som­ber ru­ins of the lost city that Ani­gel won­de­red out lo­ud if they had co­me to the right pla­ce.</p>
   <p>    Immu qu­es­ti­oned the Uis­gu Lebb and Ti­rebb, who we­re in an un­com­mon hurry to let off the­ir pas­sen­gers and ret­re­at. The two lit­tle be­ings nod­ded vi­go­ro­usly and po­in­ted to the ho­use. One tos­sed out the tra­ve­ling packs of Im­mu and the Prin­cess, and the ot­her so­un­ded the his­sing whist­le that sig­na­led the ri­mo­riks to swim off.</p>
   <p>    "Well!" Im­mu watc­hed the bo­at spe­ed away with evi­dent cons­ter­na­ti­on. "What do you think of <emphasis>that</emphasis>!"</p>
   <p>    Anigel was al­re­ady on her way up the gar­den steps. She cal­led out: "Co­me qu­ickly! You won't be­li­eve what I've fo­und gro­wing up he­re!"</p>
   <p>    "Come co­me co­me," Im­mu grumb­led, fol­lo­wing on her short legs. The­re we­re se­ve­ral small tre­es la­den with sphe­ri­cal oran­ge fru­it bet­we­en the wa­ter and the ho­use, and they had con­ce­aled anot­her plant that Ani­gel now sto­od con­temp­la­ting with awed ad­mi­ra­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    It was a Black Tril­li­um plant two ells tall, co­ve­red with hu­ge blos­soms.</p>
   <p>    Immu fell to her kne­es and burst in­to te­ars. "It's true! We've fo­und her! Oh, thanks be to the Lords of the Air!" The Prin­cess knelt to com­fort her fri­end; but a mo­ment la­ter both of them gas­ped with shock and clung to each ot­her when a sha­dowy fi­gu­re sud­denly ap­pe­ared, stan­ding bet­we­en them and the bril­li­ant mid­day sun.</p>
   <p>    "Lady?" Im­mu ven­tu­red, her vo­ice qu­ave­ring.</p>
   <p>    The fi­gu­re mo­ved, and light fell on the fa­ce of an aged wo­man, a fa­ce so se­amed and crump­led and worn that the fe­atu­res we­re ne­arly ob­li­te­ra­ted, ex­cept for fil­med blue eyes sunk de­ep in dark soc­kets. She wo­re pla­in gar­ments of whi­te ho­mes­pun, and a ve­il of emb­ro­ide­red lawn co­ve­red her strag­gling whi­te ha­ir. The hand she ex­ten­ded was ema­ci­ated, with swol­len jo­ints and pro­mi­nent ve­ins, and she wo­re a sing­le gre­at ring of pla­ti­num fi­lig­ree set with am­ber, and in the glo­wing sto­ne was a fos­sil tril­li­um.</p>
   <p>    "I am the Arc­hi­ma­ge Bi­nah," she sa­id. "Wel­co­me."</p>
   <p>    Anigel stumb­led to her fe­et, le­aving Im­mu sit­ting pa­raly­zed on the gro­und. So­met­hing bur­ned at her bre­ast and she drew forth her amu­let on its cha­in. Its am­ber was ag­low, pul­sing with her he­art­be­at, and the bud wit­hin had chan­ged: it was par­ti­al­ly un­fur­led.</p>
   <p>    The old wo­man smi­led and tur­ned, ges­tu­ring for Ani­gel to fol­low. The Arc­hi­ma­ge wal­ked with a pa­in­ful, sto­oped shuf­fle, sup­por­ting her­self with a sil­very staff. The Prin­cess fol­lo­wed wit­ho­ut a tra­ce of fe­ar. How co­uld an­yo­ne be af­ra­id of this po­or, dying Whi­te Lady?</p>
   <p>    "Oh, you wo­uld be surp­ri­sed," the Arc­hi­ma­ge res­pon­ded, chuck­ling with a so­und li­ke dry le­aves rust­ling over sto­nes. "But you shall not fe­ar me, de­ar child. I am yo­ur god­mot­her who lo­ves you. You must trust me."</p>
   <p>    "I do," Ani­gel sa­id.</p>
   <p>    The Arc­hi­ma­ge pa­used at the tall tril­li­um plant. "It is the only one of its kind that still grows in our land, and alt­ho­ugh it se­ems strong, it is dying, li­ke me."</p>
   <p>    Anigel cri­ed out in dis­may. But the old wo­man lif­ted one fin­ger to her lips. "Anot­her kind of Tril­li­um will ta­ke its pla­ce, if God wills. Do you know what I spe­ak of, da­ugh­ter?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes," the girl ad­mit­ted. "But I am a we­ak­ling, and I may con­fo­und yo­ur gre­at sche­me if-"</p>
   <p>    "Be still," Bi­nah ad­mo­nis­hed. "Such fa­tu­o­us spe­cu­la­ti­on may call forth the very fa­ilu­re it ra­ils aga­inst! You must cul­ti­va­te se­re­nity, lit­tle lo­ve, for that is the gar­ment of true ro­yalty. See how se­re­ne the­se flo­wers are, ac­cep­ting no­urish­ment from le­af and ro­ot, tur­ning the­ir fa­ces al­ways to­ward the sun, che­ris­hing se­eds de­ep wit­hin the­ir he­arts. And they will die se­re­ne, sin­ce ot­her­wi­se the­ir se­eds may not be set free."</p>
   <p>    Anigel sho­ok her he­ad in perp­le­xity. "Ple­ase, Lady… I'm sorry if I se­em slow-wit­ted. It is then my des­tiny to die for my co­untry?"</p>
   <p>    "I don't know," the Arc­hi­ma­ge sa­id. "I do know that you must do an im­por­tant work which will be re­ve­aled to you. And you will al­so re­ce­ive a sign: a ta­lis­man sig­na­ling that the fi­nal strug­gle for Ru­wen­da, and for yo­ur own so­ul, is abo­ut to be­gin. Yo­ur sis­ter Ha­ra­mis has al­re­ady set forth on her qu­est. Yo­ur sis­ter Ka­di­ya will go in se­arch of her des­tiny shortly. Each will find her own ta­lis­man and in ti­me the Three Pe­tals of the Li­ving Tril­li­um will co­me on­ce aga­in to­get­her. Be­yond this, whe­re the fi­na­li­za­ti­on li­es, I can­not see."</p>
   <p>    Anigel had tur­ned pa­le as chalk, but she sto­od calmly, still ke­eping a tight hold of her tril­li­um amu­let. "Will this gift, then, that you ga­ve me at birth, gu­ide me on my qu­est?"</p>
   <p>    "It will, and this al­so." The Arc­hi­ma­ge bro­ke one of the lar­ge le­aves from the gre­at tril­li­um plant and held it out, po­in­ting to its sur­fa­ce with her ot­her hand. "This le­af be­ars the very imp­ress of our land. Lo­ok clo­sely! Its ve­ins and ribs ma­ke a map of Ru­wen­da. He­re at the tip is Noth, and the gol­den ve­in twis­ting down from it is the wa­ter­co­ur­se you must fol­low to lo­ca­te yo­ur ta­lis­man. First down the Not­har, then down the Up­per Mu­tar in­to the Lo­wer."</p>
   <p>    Anigel was stud­ying the le­af with puz­zled in­te­rest. "But the gol­den ve­in con­ti­nu­es on to the very le­af-stem! Lo­ok - he­re is whe­re the Mu­tar cur­ves aro­und the Ci­ta­del, and this mar­king must be La­ke Wum, and be­yond that is the Gre­at Mu­tar that flows thro­ugh the co­untry of the Wyvi­lo and the sa­va­ge Glis­mak!" Fe­ar le­apt in­to the girl's eyes. "Must I go <emphasis>the­re</emphasis>? To the dark Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest?"</p>
   <p>    "So it se­ems," the Arc­hi­ma­ge sa­id. "I did not know myself un­til the le­af was pluc­ked." She sho­ok her he­ad. "Such a long way to go! My po­or lit­tle lo­ve… but it is all downst­re­am, so you will tra­vel mo­re swiftly than you did be­fo­re."</p>
   <p>    "And the work I must do - "</p>
   <p>    "Will be re­ve­aled." The old wo­man's fa­ce twis­ted mo­men­ta­rily with pa­in and she tot­te­red as she sto­od. Im­mu, who had be­en stan­ding back res­pect­ful­ly, dar­ted for­ward and to­ok hold of one of the Whi­te Lady's arms. Ani­gel to­ok the ot­her, and to­get­her they hel­ped the Arc­hi­ma­ge in­to her cot­ta­ge, se­ated her in a gre­at cus­hi­oned cha­ir, and bro­ught her a cup of wa­ter.</p>
   <p>    "Don't be con­cer­ned, my de­ars," the old wo­man sa­id. "I shan't die on you yet. My work is not do­ne. I am only very, very ti­red."</p>
   <p>    Anigel he­si­ta­ted, then ope­ned her belt-wal­let and to­ok out the small scar­let go­urd of mi­ton. "I was gi­ven this by the Uis­gu. It is sa­id to bes­tow strength and co­ura­ge - "</p>
   <p>    "The gift was for you," Bi­nah sa­id we­arily. "Ke­ep it, but use it only when it be­co­mes ne­ces­sary."</p>
   <p>    "When will that be?" Ani­gel as­ked. But Bi­nah's eyes had clo­sed, and her he­ad had sunk on­to her bre­ast, and she bre­at­hed slowly and no­isily.</p>
   <p>    "Can you at le­ast tell me whe­re my ta­lis­man can be fo­und?" Ani­gel ple­aded.</p>
   <p>    "At… the end of the stem." The vo­ice was ba­rely audib­le.</p>
   <p>    "But you ha­ven't told me what the ta­lis­man is!" Ani­gel cri­ed in des­pe­ra­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    The Arc­hi­ma­ge sig­hed.</p>
   <p>    "Please!" The girl was al­most in te­ars. "Only tell me what it is that I se­ek!"</p>
   <p>    "The Three-He­aded Mons­ter," Bi­nah whis­pe­red. And then she was so­und as­le­ep.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    The Gre­en Vo­ice pa­used at the do­or of the ro­yal bedc­ham­ber, and with an apo­lo­ge­tic gri­ma­ce ope­ned the po­uch at his belt. He to­ok out three cu­ri­o­usly wro­ught masks de­sig­ned to co­ver the lo­wer fa­ce - two co­lo­red gre­en and blue for him­self and his col­le­ague, and one mo­re or­na­te and co­lo­red sil­ver-and-black for his mas­ter.</p>
   <p>    "We sho­uld don the­se be­fo­re pre­sen­ting our­sel­ves to King Volt­rik," the Gre­en Vo­ice exp­la­ined. "The nec­ro­sis of the ro­yal flesh has prog­res­sed to such a po­int that the stench ex­ce­eds that of the fo­ulest ces­spit, so that strong men pu­ke and we­ak­lings may fa­int de­ad away. Aro­ma­tic herbs I ha­ve pac­ked wit­hin the masks will grant us sur­ce­ase from the no­xi­o­us ex­ha­la­ti­ons for a half-ho­ur or so. Will this be suf­fi­ci­ent for yo­ur pur­po­ses, Gre­at Lord? "</p>
   <p>    Orogastus nod­ded. His eyes we­re ste­ely abo­ve the mask, and if he dre­aded the cru­ci­al task that lay ahe­ad of him he ga­ve no sig­nal that his te­le­pat­hic mi­ni­ons co­uld per­ce­ive.</p>
   <p>    The ro­yal physi­ci­an - drun­ken, sob­bing, and fe­ar­ful of lo­sing his he­ad - had re­luc­tantly de­li­ve­red his di­ag­no­sis to the Gre­en Vo­ice whi­le the sor­ce­rer and his party we­re still half a day up-ri­ver from the Ci­ta­del: In spi­te of the ad­mi­nist­ra­ti­on of the ma­gi­cal Gol­den Pas­til­le, the mor­ti­fi­ca­ti­on of Volt­rik's hand had prog­res­sed to a po­int whe­re the King was cle­arly in dan­ger of dying, and the physi­ci­an had lac­ked the co­ura­ge to un­der­ta­ke the only tre­at­ment that might sa­ve him.</p>
   <p>    When this di­re news was trans­mit­ted to Oro­gas­tus, he had had the oars­men flog­ged, spe­eding the bo­at ho­me in fi­ve ho­urs, at the cost of half a do­zen hu­man li­ves. Now the sor­ce­rer him­self must ne­eds try to de­li­ver the King, who­se de­ath wo­uld me­an the ru­in of all his am­bi­ti­ons.</p>
   <p>    "Open the do­or," Oro­gas­tus com­man­ded.</p>
   <p>    The Gre­en Vo­ice bo­wed and comp­li­ed.</p>
   <p>    The bedc­ham­ber that had on­ce be­en te­nan­ted by King Kra­in had be­en has­tily re­fur­bis­hed in La­bor­no­ki crim­son for its new oc­cu­pant. It was now very dark, the only il­lu­mi­na­ti­on co­ming from the glo­wing co­als in the fi­rep­la­ce and a sing­le cand­le on a tab­le, which al­so held a ba­sin, wo­und-wrap­pings, and ot­her me­di­cal imp­le­ments and po­ti­ons with which the ro­yal physi­ci­an had fu­ti­lely at­temp­ted to tre­at the King's in­fec­ted hand. The hu­ge bed sto­od in the cen­ter of the ro­om on a plat­form, sur­ro­un­ded by empty cha­irs. Its han­gings we­re drawn back.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus ga­ve swift or­ders in a low vo­ice. "Gre­en Vo­ice, bring the two stan­ding can­de­lab­ra clo­se to the bed and light them, then cle­ar the tab­le and po­si­ti­on it at the bed­si­de ne­arest the King's in­fir­mity. Blu­eVo­ice, pre­pa­re the ma­gi­cal de­vi­ce. I think we ha­ve ba­rely ar­ri­ved in, ti­me.</p>
   <p>    A form stir­red wit­hin the she­ets, gro­aning, "Who is the­re? Is it you aga­in, dam­ned le­ech, co­me to tor­ment me with yo­ur in­com­pe­tent fumb­ling? Get out! Let me at le­ast die in pe­ace!"</p>
   <p>    "It is I, my King," Oro­gas­tus sa­id. "And you shall not die." He lif­ted the King's left arm most ca­re­ful­ly, but still the mo­narch ut­te­red an ago­ni­zed scre­am.</p>
   <p>    "Whoreson! Let me be! Yo­ur mi­ra­cu­lo­us pill hel­ped me for but a sing­le day, and then my suf­fe­rings grew wor­se than be­fo­re. Ah, Zo­to ha­ve mercy-it is <emphasis>the­ir</emphasis> do­ing! The Prin­ces­ses! They ha­ve cur­sed me from afar! It is the­ir re­ven­ge that tor­tu­res and do­oms me."</p>
   <p>    "He is de­li­ri­o­us," Oro­gas­tus sa­id. From a poc­ket de­ep wit­hin his ro­be he to­ok a small box car­ved from gre­en ma­lac­hi­te and ope­ned it. It held six tiny sphe­res that sho­ne gol­den and trans­pa­rent in the cand­le light.</p>
   <p>    "Only half the ori­gi­nal num­ber left," the sor­ce­rer mu­sed. He ext­rac­ted one and ca­re­ful­ly put the ot­hers away. Then he to­ok up a gob­let of wa­ter and pre­va­iled upon King Volt­rik to swal­low the Gol­den Pas­til­le. When he had do­ne so, the mo­narch ut­te­red a gusty ex­ha­la­ti­on and se­emed to re­lax.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus now slit the vo­lu­mi­no­us ban­da­ges abo­ut the King's hand with a small sharp kni­fe. Po­si­ti­oning the ex­ten­ded arm on the tab­le, he unw­rap­ped it, ex­po­sing the wo­und. The en­ti­re limb felt hot to the to­uch, and stre­aks of red ex­ten­ded from the wrist to the arm­pit. The hand it­self was hi­de­o­usly swol­len, with the fin­ger-tips blu­ish-black, and the flesh slo­ug­hing away in the area of the bi­te and exu­ding a to­we­ring stench that not even the her­bal masks co­uld in­hi­bit. The sor­ce­rer ga­ve the Blue Vo­ice the ban­da­ges to be burnt and spo­ke swift inst­ruc­ti­ons to his ot­her as­sis­tant, who had un­pac­ked a le­at­her bag and la­id its con­tents on the tab­le. Now Oro­gas­tus ga­ve the limb over to the Gre­en Vo­ice and sto­od clo­se to the King's he­ad. Volt­rik was ga­unt, flus­hed, and rhe­umy-eyed, his on­ce im­ma­cu­la­te be­ard strag­gling and filth-clot­ted.</p>
   <p>    "What are you do­ing?" the mo­narch cri­ed, star­ting up from the damp pil­lows. "Let lo­ose my arm, you tre­aso­no­us wor­rams! I know who you are! You've be­en sent by the three Ru­wen­di­an witc­hes to fi­nish me off!"</p>
   <p>    "Look in­to my eyes," Oro­gas­tus com­man­ded. "Lo­ok and find res­pi­te from yo­ur suf­fe­ring." The mas­ked enc­han­ter to­ok the King's swe­at-drenc­hed he­ad in both hands and tur­ned it so that the­ir two ga­zes com­ming­led. Volt­rik mo­aned, then ga­ve vent to a gre­at sigh and fell back on­to the bedc­lot­hes, be­reft of cons­ci­o­us­ness.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus re­tur­ned to the tab­le and to­ok up a sin­gu­lar de­vi­ce. It was cu­bi­cal ex­cept for a sno­ut­li­ke prot­ru­si­on on one si­de, and co­lo­red a shim­me­ring sil­very blue. On its top we­re ranks of black and red wart-li­ke exc­res­cen­ces with myste­ri­o­us symbols be­ne­ath them, and an in­set mi­ni­atu­re fra­me with grey blank­ness ins­te­ad of a pic­tu­re. When the sor­ce­rer's fin­gers mo­ved over the warts, pres­sing now this one and now that, the blank­ness wit­hin the lit­tle fra­me tur­ned bright, and mo­ving li­nes of co­lo­red hi­eroglyp­hics ap­pe­ared on it. The at­ten­ding Vo­ice gas­ped in awe. One of the red warts glo­wed, then tur­ned gold.</p>
   <p>    "Hold the arm per­fectly still, thus," Oro­gas­tus com­man­ded. "Sing the Chant of He­aling but avert yo­ur eyes, for this mac­hi­ne of the Va­nis­hed Ones can blind a man who lo­oks unp­ro­tec­ted upon its work.</p>
   <p>    The sor­ce­rer po­si­ti­oned the de­vi­ce a hands­pan be­low the el­bow of the wo­un­ded arm as the three Vo­ices be­gan to chant in uni­son. Then he to­ok up a stran­ge vi­sor and put it on, and all be­ing in re­adi­ness, he pres­sed the lar­gest of the mac­hi­ne's warts. A daz­zling be­am of blue-whi­te light no thic­ker than a fla­xen thre­ad sprang forth from the pro-tra­ding noz­zle, and Oro­gas­tus ma­ni­pu­la­ted the de­vi­ce slowly so that the ray tran­sec­ted the ro­yal limb, mo­ving in a de­ep V-sha­pe.</p>
   <p>    There was a sharp siz­zling so­und and a gre­at puff of smo­ke. When the be­am win­ked out, Volt­rik's lo­wer arm was se­ve­red and the­re was a nar­row char­red gro­ove in a cor­res­pon­ding V-sha­pe bur­ned in­to the wo­oden tab­le­top. The Chant of He­aling ca­me to an end.</p>
   <p>    "It is do­ne." Oro­gas­tus re­mo­ved the vi­sor and ins­pec­ted the stump. The lar­ge blo­od ves­sels we­re ca­ute­ri­zed, but the flesh was red and glis­te­ning sur­ro­un­ding the two whi­te bo­nes wit­hin.</p>
   <p>    "Good. The mor­tal put­re­fac­ti­on had not re­ac­hed in­to the arm it­self. Now the Gol­den Pas­til­le may wre­ak its he­aling wit­ho­ut ha­ving to con­tend aga­inst a re­ser­vo­ir of de­adly po­ison wit­hin the do­omed hand."</p>
   <p>    He pres­sed a wart and all of the glo­wing are­as on the de­vi­ce went dark. "Blue Vo­ice, wrap the de­ad mem­ber and burn it, ta­king ca­re lest it be­fo­ul you. Then re­pack my de­vi­ce most ca­re­ful­ly. Gre­en Vo­ice, wi­pe well the tab­le and the un­da­ma­ged skin of the arm with strong brandy-spi­rit. Spon­ge al­so the King's fo­re­he­ad and temp­les, and bring fresh li­nen and a cle­an bed­ro­be for him from the press over yon­der. Scorch new ban­da­ges at the fi­re and then rew­rap the stump lo­osely. It must still pur­ge it­self of cer­ta­in no­xi­o­us flu­ids be­fo­re it is sewn. La­ter I will gi­ve you and that cre­ti­no­us physi­ci­an furt­her inst­ruc­ti­ons con­cer­ning ca­re of the stump that are to be fol­lo­wed scru­pu­lo­usly."</p>
   <p>    "The le­ech is to be spa­red, Gre­at Lord?" Gre­en was mildly surp­ri­sed.</p>
   <p>    "Unless you wish to spo­on gru­el, chan­ge dres­sings, and empty the ro­yal cham­ber-pot yo­ur­self, fo­ol! Now at­tend to the King."</p>
   <p>    While the two Vo­ices mi­nis­te­red to Volt­rik, Oro­gas­tus went to the do­ub­le win­dow of the bedc­ham­ber, threw back the he­avy red cur­ta­in, and ope­ned the ca­se­ment wi­de. Out­si­de the sun sho­ne brightly and the­re was a light bre­eze from the north. With the rot­ten flesh con­sig­ned to the fla­mes and the stink fi­nal­ly aba­ted, Oro­gas­tus to­ok off his mask. His hand­so­me fe­atu­res we­re pinc­hed and pa­le and his lips tight-pres­sed to a grim li­ne. It had be­en a ne­ar thing, but the King wo­uld re­co­ver ra­pidly now with ca­re­ful nur­sing and ap­prop­ri­ate re­as­su­ran­ces. On­ce aga­in the sor­ce­rer ap­pro­ac­hed the ro­yal bed­si­de.</p>
   <p>    "Voltrik -he­ar me!" Oro­gas­tus spo­ke in a low, com­pel­ling to­ne.</p>
   <p>    The King mur­mu­red, "I he­ar you."</p>
   <p>    "You ha­ve ho­ve­red at the thres­hold of de­ath, my Li­ege, but I sa­ved you when all ot­hers had des­pa­ired. You will li­ve. The­re will yet be so­me suf­fe­ring to be en­du­red, but wit­hin a few we­eks you will be strong aga­in. I, Oro­gas­tus, pled­ge this most so­lemnly."</p>
   <p>    "Thank you," whis­pe­red the King. His eyes we­re clo­sed and his hec­tic flush had re­ce­ded. "You ha­ve re­mo­ved the hand?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes, Si­re."</p>
   <p>    The King sig­hed. "So be it. At le­ast it is not the sword hand lost, thanks be to Zo­to the Com­pas­si­ona­te - and you." He gro­aned a lit­tle as the Vo­ices en­ro­bed him in a cle­an gar­ment and put fresh pil­lows be­ne­ath his he­ad and the newly ban­da­ged arm. The sor­ce­rer him­self drew up the co­ver­let over the ro­yal bre­ast, whe­re­upon the King ope­ned his eyes and spo­ke in a vo­ice that was we­ak but ne­arly nor­mal in timb­re.</p>
   <p>    "Send yo­ur ser­vants away. I wish to spe­ak to you of vi­tal mat­ters."</p>
   <p>    Orogastus ad­dres­sed his un­der­lings: "I will le­ave for my to­wer on Mo­unt Brom wit­hin the ho­ur. See to it that my es­cort is he­avily ar­med and mo­un­ted upon the swif­test and stron­gest fro­ni­als."</p>
   <p>    "Yes, Al­mighty Mas­ter." The Vo­ices went out and clo­sed the do­or.</p>
   <p>    "You are le­aving?…" The King was dis­ma­yed.</p>
   <p>    "My Vo­ices will see that you are well ca­red for. I must go back to La­bor­nok in or­der to con­sult the ice-mir­ror at my mo­un­ta­in strong­hold. Only thro­ugh this po­wer­ful de­vi­ce will I be ab­le to spy out the whe­re­abo­uts of yo­ur ene­mi­es."</p>
   <p>    The King sig­hed gus­tily. "That it was I wis­hed to spe­ak of. The­re was no news of the three fu­gi­ti­ve girls in Tre­vis­ta?"</p>
   <p>    "None. The fe­ma­le le­ader of the abo­ri­gi­nes re­fu­sed po­int-blank to co­ope­ra­te with any se­arch. If we at­tempt to co­er­ce the swamp Folk in this mat­ter, she says that all tra­de bet­we­en them and us will be abo­lis­hed."</p>
   <p>    The King cur­sed pa­in­ful­ly. "We must find tho­se Prin­ces­ses!"</p>
   <p>    "My acoly­tes and I exer­ted our oc­cult po­wers to the ut­most, scan­ning not only the Od­dling city, but al­so the fart­hest re­ac­hes of Ru­wen­da. Our ef­forts we­re in va­in. So­me po­wer­ful enc­hant­ment balks my Sight, even when it is amp­li­fi­ed by men­tal co­nj­unc­ti­on. The three Prin­ces­ses are sa­id to we­ar amu­lets con­ta­ining buds of the Black Tril­li­um. Per­haps the­se shi­eld them. This herb is lin­ked to Bi­nah, the gu­ar­di­an witch of Ru­wen­da, and it is li­kely that she has chan­ne­led all of her re­ma­ining me­ager po­tency thro­ugh it to de­fend her wards."</p>
   <p>    "Your mir­ror will be ab­le to squ­elch this-this ob­fus­ca­ti­on?"</p>
   <p>    "Beyond a do­ubt. It is em­po­we­red by the ma­gic of the Va­nis­hed Ones. No enc­hant­ment in the known world can con­fu­te its far­se­e­ing eye. It can see for fi­ve tho­usand le­agu­es -to the very wes­tern bo­un­dary of the con­ti­nent, whe­re the fe­at­he­red bar­ba­ri­ans dwell. Ha­ve no fe­ar, my King. I will lo­ca­te the Prin­ces­ses, no mat­ter whe­re they ha­ve hid­den."</p>
   <p>    "So you track the she-de­vils down. What then? They co­uld skip away long be­fo­re you re­tur­ned to Ru­wen­da to gi­ve cha­se."</p>
   <p>    Orogastus la­ug­hed. "My King, le­ave it all to me. The Red Vo­ice has re­ma­ined in Tre­vis­ta, awa­iting or­ders with the gar­ri­son tro­ops. When I ha­ve fo­und the girls, I will bes­pe­ak the­ir hi­ding pla­ces to each of my as­sis­tants and we will send out se­arch par­ti­es at on­ce. The Vo­ices will gu­ide them, and I will cons­tantly trans­mit news of the Prin­ces­ses' mo­ve­ments un­til at last yo­ur ene­mi­es are ta­ken and de­alt with as they de­ser­ve."</p>
   <p>    "Good. Go­od." The King was si­lent for a few mo­ments. Then he sa­id: "The girls re­al­ly did ca­use my wo­und to mor­tify, didn't they?"</p>
   <p>    "Such things can hap­pen be­ca­use of ma­gic, but al­so from the nor­mal co­ur­se of events. At any ra­te, Si­re, you will so­on be well. Un­for­tu­na­tely, the ma­lady you suf­fe­red is one that can­not be cu­red ex­cept by the most dras­tic in­ter­ven­ti­on."</p>
   <p>    The King had clo­sed his eyes aga­in. A wry smi­le pla­yed abo­ut his dis­co­lo­red lips. "But you in­ter­ve­ned in ti­me. And so my de­ar son An­tar will ha­ve to con­tent him­self wit­ho­ut the crown that was so ne­arly wit­hin his grasp."</p>
   <p>    The sor­ce­rer's vo­ice was ne­ut­ral. "The Crown Prin­ce com­por­ted him­self with dig­nity and ho­nor in Tre­vis­ta and sends his pra­yers for yo­ur re­co­very."</p>
   <p>    "Hmmph! Yo­ur Gre­en Vo­ice pas­sed on his brot­hers' vi­si­on of An­tar's me­eting with the Od­dling Dis­cer­ner. The dam­ned boy ca­ved in be­fo­re her li­ke a wed­ding ca­ke in a mon­so­on!" The ro­yal eye­lids flic­ked open. "What do you think, sor­ce­rer? Is my son lo­yal?"</p>
   <p>    "We will find out, my King. Sin­ce Prin­ce An­tar will cer­ta­inly cap­ta­in one of the se­arch-par­ti­es we send in pur­su­it of the three Prin­ces­ses."</p>

   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Haramis awo­ke the next mor­ning with the sun in her eyes and the know­led­ge that so­met­hing was very wrong. It to­ok her a mo­ment to gat­her her wits eno­ugh to re­ali­ze that what dis­tur­bed her was the si­len­ce. Uzun al­ways ro­se be­fo­re she did, so that she ge­ne­ral­ly wo­ke to the so­unds of him mo­ving aro­und the camp, hum­ming to him­self. But now it was full day, the winds we­re still, the birds we­re si­lent, and the­re was no so­und from Uzun, not so much as a sno­re.</p>
   <p>    Haramis tur­ned her he­ad to lo­ok at her fri­end's sle­ep-sack, still nest­led aga­inst the bo­ul­der whe­re he had pla­ced it the night be­fo­re. Jud­ging by its sha­pe, he was still in it. Ha­ra­mis pul­led her­self re­luc­tantly out of her own sack, no­ting that the tem­pe­ra­tu­re was much lo­wer than it had be­en the pre­vi­o­us night, in spi­te of the bright sun­light. She squ­in­ted in­to the clo­ud­less sky and be­la­tedly re­ali­zed that the pat­tern of clo­uds she had se­en the day be­fo­re had in­di­ca­ted the im­mi­nent ar­ri­val of a cold spell.</p>
   <p>    Crawling over to whe­re Uzun lay, she pul­led back the top of his sle­ep-sack to un­co­ver his fa­ce. It was per­fectly still and exp­res­si­on­less, and Ha­ra­mis was con­vin­ced she was lo­oking at a corp­se.</p>
   <p>    "Lords of the Air," she whis­pe­red in hor­ror. "I sho­uld ha­ve sent him back yes­ter­day - no, days ago!"</p>
   <p>    She grab­bed the lit­tle Od­dling by the sho­ul­ders and sho­ok him vi­olently. "Ple­ase, Uzun, wa­ke up! Don't be de­ad! Ple­ase!"</p>
   <p>    His body flop­ped lo­osely in her grasp, and what re­ma­ined of the ra­ti­onal part of her mind re­mem­be­red that bo­di­es stif­fe­ned in de­ath. Per­haps he was ali­ve af­ter all…</p>
   <p>    She la­id him down gently, pul­led off her left mit­ten, and held her palm just abo­ve his mo­uth. It se­emed fo­re­ver be­fo­re she felt his bre­ath flow aga­inst her hand and even lon­ger be­fo­re the next bre­ath. He was ali­ve, but she had to get him so­mep­la­ce war­mer, and that so­on.</p>
   <p>    She tuc­ked his sle­ep-sack back aro­und him, re­tur­ned to her own, and pul­led on her bo­ots. Then she set her pack and wal­king-staff aga­inst the rock next to Uzun's sle­ep-sack, and cast anot­her an­xi­o­us glan­ce at the sky. She was fa­irly cer­ta­in it wasn't go­ing to snow to­day, and with luck she'd be back he­re to­night. Her pack sho­uld re­ma­in un­dis­tur­bed; the­re we­re no ani­mals in this area li­kely to be at­trac­ted to it.</p>
   <p>    She sho­ul­de­red Uzun's pack, and pic­ked him up, still bund­led. Sha­king as much snow as pos­sib­le off the sle­ep-sack, she ma­ne­uve­red him in­to her own. The ext­ra la­yer of in­su­la­ti­on might help, even if it was un­wi­eldy to carry such a bulky bund­le. For­tu­na­tely Uzun was not he­avy, and the path was down­hill.</p>
   <p>    Haramis set off at the best pa­ce she co­uld ma­na­ge, which was fa­irly qu­ick, es­pe­ci­al­ly in the spots whe­re she slip­ped and slid, clutc­hing Uzun to her bre­ast un­til she co­uld dig in her he­els eno­ugh to stop them. By mid-mor­ning they we­re out of the snow­fi­elds, and by mid­day they we­re back at the pla­ce whe­re they had cam­ped the pre­vi­o­us night.</p>
   <p>    It was an al­co­ve in the rocks, dry, shel­te­red from wind, and cur­rently flo­oded with the no­on­day sun. Even the rock walls we­re warm to the to­uch. Ha­ra­mis set Uzun down aga­inst the back wall and went to sca­ven­ge for fi­re­wo­od. He had be­en the one to gat­her wo­od when they had be­en he­re be­fo­re, but she re­mem­be­red in which di­rec­ti­on he had lo­oked and that it hadn't ta­ken him long to find it.</p>
   <p>    When she re­tur­ned, she chec­ked Uzun's con­di­ti­on aga­in. He was still un­cons­ci­o­us, but his bre­at­hing se­emed to be a bit fas­ter, which she to­ok to be a go­od sign. She bu­ilt the fi­re as clo­se to him as she da­red, he­ated so­me wa­ter, and ma­de tea. Uzun was still as­le­ep when the tea was re­ady; but the smell of it re­min­ded her that she hadn't eaten or drunk anyt­hing that day, so she sip­ped so­me of it and ate a lit­tle of the fo­od from Uzun's pack. <emphasis>He won't ne­ed as much on his trip so­uth. He'll be in are­as whe­re fo­od can be ob­ta­ined</emphasis>. Then, fe­eling mo­re ali­ve her­self, she to­ok the bowl of tea over to Uzun, prop­ped him up, and ca­re­ful­ly drip­ped a small amo­unt of it bet­we­en his lips.</p>
   <p>    To her im­men­se re­li­ef, he ro­used slightly at the to­uch of warm li­qu­id. "Gently, Uzun," she mur­mu­red. "Swal­low."</p>
   <p>    He did, and she co­axed him to ta­ke a few mo­re mo­uth­fuls be­fo­re he fe­ebly pus­hed it away, mur­mu­ring: "Too ti­red."</p>
   <p>    "I'm ti­red, too," Ha­ra­mis ag­re­ed, re­ali­zing that it was true. She was ex­ha­us­ted. She drank off the rest of the tea, le­aned her back aga­inst the sto­ne wall, and crad­led Uzun in her lap. Per­haps ke­eping him clo­se to her body wo­uld help; she was warm-blo­oded and sho­uld ra­di­ate at le­ast so­me he­at. And the sun shi­ning on her felt so go­od. She clo­sed her eyes and til­ted her fa­ce to­ward the light…</p>
   <p>    "Princess!" The bund­le in her lap was squ­ir­ming fran­ti­cal­ly. "What are we do­ing sit­ting he­re? Su­rely the se­ed hasn't stop­ped us this early…" Uzun's he­ad whip­ped back and forth as its ow­ner tri­ed to ori­ent him­self. "Whe­re are we? What hap­pe­ned?"</p>
   <p>    Haramis sho­ok her he­ad, strug­gling to cle­ar her tho­ughts. She al­most ne­ver slept du­ring the day­ti­me - cer­ta­inly ne­ver when she wasn't sick - and she felt groggy, as if she had be­en drug­ged or po­iso­ned. "Tea," she mut­te­red. "I ne­ed tea." Her hand fumb­led at her si­de and fo­und the bowl, and she star­ted to push her­self to her fe­et.</p>
   <p>    Uzun wrig­gled out of the two sle­ep-sacks. "I'll get it." He to­ok the bowl from her, ad­ded mo­re wo­od to the fi­re, and put mo­re wa­ter on to bo­il. To Ha­ra­mis's sle­epy eyes, he ap­pe­ared comp­le­tely re­co­ve­red. Co­uld Od­dlings be fro­zen then, and tha­wed out aga­in with no ill ef­fects? It se­emed inc­re­dib­le. But at le­ast Uzun sho­uld be ab­le to re­turn alo­ne now.</p>
   <p>    He bro­ught her the tea, and she sip­ped it slowly, fe­eling her di­sor­de­red wits start to fall back in­to pla­ce. She drank half the bowl, then han­ded the rest to Uzun to fi­nish.</p>
   <p>    "Uzun," she be­gan, eager to sha­re with him the in­sight she had ac­hi­eved du­ring her over­bur­de­ned trek down the mo­un­ta­in, "I re­al­ly be­li­eve that we ha­ve spent too much of our li­ves in the lib­rary and the mu­sic ro­om. We've be­en ac­ting li­ke a co­up­le of idi­ot he­ro­es on a qu­est - as if we we­re des­ti­ned to suc­ce­ed and the­re­fo­re had no ne­ed to use our bra­ins and com­mon sen­se. The Whi­te Lady sa­id I wo­uld ha­ve to part with you be­fo­re I fi­nis­hed my qu­est, but she cer­ta­inly ne­ver sa­id that I sho­uld do so by drag­ging you in­to cold we­at­her yo­ur body co­uldn't hand­le and al­lo­wing you to fre­eze to de­ath."</p>
   <p>    The Od­dling lo­oked at the­ir sur­ro­un­dings ca­re­ful­ly. "I know this pla­ce. But this isn't whe­re we stop­ped last night, is it?"</p>
   <p>    "No, it's not," Ha­ra­mis rep­li­ed. "This is our camp of two nights ago. I wo­ke up this mor­ning to find you fro­zen al­most to de­ath - in fact, I tho­ught at first that you <emphasis>we­re</emphasis> de­ad! Yo­ur skin was as cold as the air, and yo­ur bre­at­hing was so slow it to­ok me qu­ite a whi­le to be su­re you we­re still ali­ve." She shud­de­red at the me­mory. "So I bund­led you up in both our sle­ep-sacks and car­ri­ed you back down he­re in the ho­pe that you wo­uld thaw out and sur­vi­ve." She drew a de­ep bre­ath. "Thank the Tri­une God, it wor­ked. You are all right, aren't you?" she ad­ded an­xi­o­usly.</p>
   <p>    Uzun ap­pe­ared a bit sha­ken by her ac­co­unt, but af­ter a mo­ment's tho­ught he nod­ded. "I fe­el well eno­ugh," he sa­id. "I'm still a bit chilly, but it's not­hing se­ri­o­us. I'll be well eno­ugh to go on la­ter."</p>
   <p>    "Good," Ha­ra­mis sa­id. "Now that you are out of the snow­fi­elds, you sho­uld be ab­le to re­turn to Tre­vis­ta on yo­ur own, whi­le I con­ti­nue my jo­ur­ney." She rum­ma­ged in his pack for the fis­hing ge­ar. "For now, just get back in the sle­ep-sacks and rest. I'm go­ing to see if I can catch a fish or two for sup­per. If I can get eno­ugh, we'll both ha­ve fo­od for to­mor­row as well."</p>
   <p>    "But, my Prin­cess," Uzun pro­tes­ted, "you will lo­se at le­ast two days of tra­vel ti­me. And you may run out of se­eds to gu­ide you."</p>
   <p>    "The two days are al­re­ady lost, old fri­end," Ha­ra­mis sig­hed; "even if I star­ted back up im­me­di­ately, I wo­uld not be ab­le to re­ach last night's camp­si­te un­til ne­arly dawn - as­su­ming I co­uld mo­ve at the sa­me pa­ce by mo­on­light as by day­light, which I very much do­ubt. But I won't ne­ed anot­her se­ed for to­mor­row -I was ca­re­ful to no­ti­ce land­marks as I ca­me down­hill, so that I can ret­ra­ce my steps una­ided. And it do­esn't lo­ok as tho­ugh it will snow to­night, which me­ans that I will ha­ve my old tracks to fol­low. So don't worry abo­ut me, just stay by the fi­re and rest. By the Tri­une God, Uzun, you ne­arly di­ed!"</p>
   <p>    "Do you think I wo­uld not re­j­o­ice to die in yo­ur ser­vi­ce?" Uzun as­ked in of­fen­ded to­nes.</p>
   <p>    "I am qu­ite su­re you won?t," Ha­ra­mis snap­ped crossly. "That's pre­ci­sely what I me­an abo­ut ha­ving our he­ads ec­ho­ing with old bal­lads. I as­su­re you that when one is slog­ging thro­ugh the snow car­rying a child­ho­od fri­end who may very well die be­ca­use you we­re too stu­pid to no­ti­ce he was get­ting sick from the cold, one's tho­ughts are not oc­cu­pi­ed in fin­ding rhyming co­up­lets for a song of his he­ro­ic de­ath. I was stu­pid not to no­ti­ce how sick you we­re get­ting, and <emphasis>you</emphasis> we­re stu­pid not to tell me. Yo­ur fre­ezing to de­ath wo­uldn't help Ru­wen­da in the sligh­test, and wo­uld ha­ve left me dist­rac­ted with gri­ef and gu­ilt. The loss of two days' tra­vel is a small pri­ce to pay for yo­ur li­fe. May­be," she con­ti­nu­ed tho­ught­ful­ly, "may­be a qu­e­en do­es so­me­ti­mes ha­ve to sac­ri­fi­ce the li­fe of one of her pe­op­le, but by the Lords of the Air, if I ha­ve to do that, I'm go­ing to ha­ve a go­od re­ason!"</p>
   <p>    "Would you deny me the chan­ce to be fa­ith­ful un­to de­ath?" Uzun's vo­ice was hurt.</p>
   <p>    "Not at all," Ha­ra­mis as­su­red him. "I simply do not fe­el that <emphasis>now</emphasis> is the ap­prop­ri­ate ti­me for you to die in my ser­vi­ce. Af­ter all, if you die now, who is go­ing to be my chi­ef mu­si­ci­an when I ha­ve my thro­ne back - and who will te­ach my child­ren to play the fip­ple flu­te?"</p>
   <p>    Uzun's fa­ce brigh­te­ned con­si­de­rably at that. "Very well, my Prin­cess, it shall be as you de­si­re. I shall re­turn to my ho­me­land and awa­it yo­ur re­turn to the thro­ne and my re­turn to yo­ur ser­vi­ce."</p>
   <p>    "I, too, lo­ok for­ward to that day," Ha­ra­mis sa­id smi­ling as she tuc­ked the se­cond sle­ep-sack mo­re tightly aro­und him. "Sle­ep now, my fri­end." Uzun's eye­lids flut­te­red clo­sed, and Ha­ra­mis mo­ved her hand over his fo­re­he­ad. His skin was de­fi­ni­tely war­mer now; he was go­ing to be all right. Blin­king back te­ars of re­li­ef, she went to the ri­ver in se­arch of fish.</p>
   <p>    "Princess, wa­ke up!" Uzun was sha­king her sho­ul­der ur­gently. "The­re will be snow to­day, so you ne­ed to get star­ted as so­on as pos­sib­le."</p>
   <p>    Haramis ope­ned her eyes. Su­re eno­ugh, the sky was obs­cu­red by he­avy pew­ter-grey clo­uds ob­vi­o­usly just wa­iting for the right mo­ment to start dum­ping snow all over the lands­ca­pe. She gro­aned, drag­ging her­self to a sit­ting po­si­ti­on. She was still ti­red from her exer­ti­ons of the pre­vi­o­us day. Car­rying Uzun had re­qu­ired musc­les she had not be­en using be­fo­re. Now her arms ac­hed down the­ir en­ti­re in­ner length.</p>
   <p>    Uzun bust­led abo­ut the fi­re, pre­pa­ring tea, and bro­ught it to her. "Prin­cess," he as­ked, lo­oking abo­ut them, "whe­re is yo­ur back­pack?"</p>
   <p>    Haramis has­tily drank her por­ti­on of tea. "I left it at the camp­si­te yes­ter­day - I had best get back up the­re to ret­ri­eve it be­fo­re it gets bu­ri­ed!" She got up, has­tily rol­led up her sle­ep-sack, and ti­ed it aro­und her wa­ist. "And you had bet­ter get out of he­re qu­ickly, too, Uzun; you don't want to be ca­ught in the snow!"</p>
   <p>    "Very true," Uzun ag­re­ed, sho­ving a lar­ge chunk of jo­ur­ney bre­ad in­to her hand. "Eat this on yo­ur way, and may the Lords of the Air go with you."</p>
   <p>    "And with you, my fri­end." Ha­ra­mis hug­ged her old fri­end tightly, re­luc­tant to part with him, then re­le­ased him and star­ted up the path. <emphasis>At le­ast I don't ha­ve to ke­ep watc­hing a flo­ating se­ed, so I can pay mo­re at­ten­ti­on to whe­re I'm put­ting my fe­et</emphasis>, she tho­ught. <emphasis>Now if the snow wo­uld stop</emphasis>…</p>
   <p>    She went up the mo­un­ta­in at a go­od spe­ed, sin­ce she was mo­re lightly bur­de­ned than the last ti­me she had ma­de this climb and knew exactly whe­re she was go­ing. By the ti­me the snow star­ted fal­ling she had al­re­ady go­ne half­way; and when she re­ac­hed the rock whe­re she and Uzun had cam­ped two nights be­fo­re, her pack was bu­ri­ed un­der only a hands­pan of snow.</p>
   <p>    She dug it out, ate so­me mo­re jo­ur­ney bre­ad, and hol­lo­wed out a sle­eping spa­ce in the lee of the rock. It was get­ting very dark, but with the snow fal­ling she did not think she co­uld ke­ep a fi­re lit, so she craw­led in­to her sle­ep-sack, pul­ling her pack in with her, and wa­ited for sle­ep to co­me.</p>
   <p>    But her ner­ves, which had be­en sho­uting <emphasis>hurry, hurry, hurry</emphasis> at her all day, we­re not so easily qu­i­eted. Ha­ra­mis had ne­ver felt so be­reft and alo­ne in her li­fe, and she sud­denly re­ali­zed that this was the first ti­me she ever <emphasis>had</emphasis> be­en alo­ne. Be­fo­re the in­va­si­on, she had al­ways had her pa­rents, her sis­ters, Uzun, and the rest of the in­ha­bi­tants of the Ci­ta­del. Sin­ce then Uzun had be­en with her, ex­cept for the ho­urs she had spent with the Arc­hi­ma­ge. And whi­le at ti­mes du­ring her li­fe at ho­me she had wis­hed for mo­re pri­vacy, now that she had all the pri­vacy an­yo­ne co­uld pos­sibly de­si­re she wasn't at all su­re she li­ked it.</p>
   <p>    In ad­di­ti­on to her lo­ne­li­ness, the­re we­re ot­her things tro­ub­ling her. Chi­ef among the­se was Uzun. She pra­yed to the Lords of the Air that he wo­uld ma­ke his way sa­fely out of the mo­un­ta­ins, but now that she had ti­me to think abo­ut the si­tu­ati­on and not­hing el­se to do but think, se­ve­ral qu­es­ti­ons oc­cur­red to her. Why had Uzun not told her he co­uldn't go on be­fo­re he ne­arly fro­ze to de­ath? Why hadn't the Arch-ima­ge war­ned her to le­ave Uzun be­hind be­fo­re she en­te­red the snow-fi­elds, ins­te­ad of simply sa­ying that the el­derly mu­si­ci­an wo­uld be le­aving her be­fo­re she fo­und her ta­lis­man? For all the help eit­her of them had be­en, Uzun might ha­ve di­ed!</p>
   <p>    Of co­ur­se, the fa­ult lay as much with her as with them; her judg­ment had be­en equ­al­ly bad, but they we­re ol­der. Sho­uldn't they ha­ve known bet­ter than she?</p>
   <p>    I <emphasis>am Qu­e­en of Ru­wen­da</emphasis>, she tho­ught so­berly, <emphasis>and the res­pon­si­bi­lity is mi­ne, but I still ne­ed co­un­sel I can trust</emphasis>-<emphasis>and how much can I trust eit­her of them? Uzun do­esn't se­em any mo­re awa­re of his li­mi­ta­ti­ons than Ka­di­ya is of hers, or if he is, he won't ad­mit them wit­ho­ut a strug­gle. As for the Arc­hi­ma­ge, did she not re­ali­ze how sus­cep­tib­le Uzun wo­uld be to cold, or did she me­rely not think him im­por­tant eno­ugh to worry abo­ut</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    Even her be­lo­ved pa­rents, she be­la­tedly re­ali­zed, had hardly be­en mas­ters of worldly wis­dom and dip­lo­macy. La­bor­nok's co­ve­to­us in­te­rest in Ru­wen­da had be­en well-known in the Ru­wen­di­an co­urt; and whi­le Ha­ra­mis cer­ta­inly did not want to marry Volt­rik, her pa­rents co­uld at le­ast ha­ve pre­ten­ded to ne­go­ti­ate, or exp­res­sed con­cern abo­ut the gre­at disc­re­pancy in age bet­we­en Ha­ra­mis and Volt­rik and sug­ges­ted a uni­on with Volt­rik's son ins­te­ad. What was his na­me? Oh yes, Prin­ce An­tar. And if Ru­wen­da wan­ted an al­li­an­ce with Var, an idea which cer­ta­inly had me­rit, Ha­ra­mis was not the only ro­yal da­ugh­ter. Ha­ra­mis had tro­ub­le vi­su­ali­zing Ka­di­ya as an­yo­ne's wi­fe, but Ani­gel wo­uld ma­ke a splen­did bri­de for a dip­lo­ma­tic al­li­an­ce. She was so gent­le and yi­el­ding that she co­uld get along with an­yo­ne. <emphasis>And if I can think of all this off the top of my he­ad</emphasis>, Ha­ra­mis tho­ught, <emphasis>what we­re my pa­rents and the­ir ad­vi­sers do­ing? Trus­ting in the Whi­te Lady</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Obviously</emphasis>, she de­ci­ded, <emphasis>it is ne­ces­sary to con­si­der pe­op­le's ca­pa­bi­li­ti­es as well as the­ir in­ten­ti­ons when one ta­kes co­un­sel of them or de­pends on them for aid</emphasis>. So who, if an­yo­ne, re­ma­ined who co­uld help her now? Still pon­de­ring that qu­es­ti­on, Ha­ra­mis fell as­le­ep.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Eighteen</strong></p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Princess Ani­gel had ne­arly swo­oned when the Whi­te Lady re­ve­aled the na­tu­re of the ta­lis­man she must se­ek. A Three He­aded Mons­ter! Such a pros­pect wo­uld ha­ve da­un­ted even bold Ka­di­ya or the con­fi­dent Ha­ra­mis. That she sho­uld be ex­pec­ted to find and sub­due such a thing was la­ug­hab­le. No, im­pos­sib­le!</p>
   <p>    She sa­id as much to Im­mu, spe­aking thro­ugh a storm of fu­ri­o­us we­eping (for the Arc­hi­ma­ge had fal­len as­le­ep and co­uld not be wa­ke­ned), but the Nysso­mu wo­man only co­un­se­led pa­ti­en­ce.</p>
   <p>    "There are many kinds of mons­ters," Im­mu sa­id, "and not all are li­ke the Skri­tek, with glo­wing eyes and ren­ding fangs and claws, for the word has many me­anings. Un­til you be­hold yo­ur monst­ro­us ta­lis­man with yo­ur own eyes, Prin­cess, you had bet­ter re­ser­ve judg­ment upon whet­her or not to be af­ra­id of it."</p>
   <p>    Immu's go­od sen­se ga­ve the Prin­cess a cer­ta­in grim com­fort. Sin­ce the Whi­te Lady slept on ob­li­vi­o­us, the two gu­ests ma­de them­sel­ves at ho­me in her cot­ta­ge, ref­res­hing them­sel­ves, co­oking a fi­ne din­ner from the well-stoc­ked lar­der, and fi­nal­ly go­ing to sle­ep on the flo­or in front of the fi­re, one on eit­her si­de of the Lady's cha­ir, in ca­se she sho­uld ne­ed help du­ring the night.</p>
   <p>    In the mor­ning, the Arc­hi­ma­ge was go­ne.</p>
   <p>    So was the cot­ta­ge, the ne­at yard with the lawn-clip­ping to­gars, the Black Tril­li­um plant and the lit­tle orc­hard, even the flight of sto­ne steps and the dock whe­re they had lan­ded.</p>
   <p>    Anigel and Im­mu lay in the­ir plant-down sacks on a jung­le slo­pe be­ne­ath the hu­ge le­aves of a brud­dok, the plant cal­led by the Nysso­mu the "tra­ve­ler's fri­end" be­ca­use of its shel­te­ring fo­li­age and swe­et, ju­icy fru­it. The only in­di­ca­ti­on that they we­re not in the midst of a wil­der­ness was a glimp­se of the ru­ins of Noth, vi­sib­le be­hind the tre­es ac­ross the ri­ver from the lit­tle la­go­on, on the sho­re of which the cot­ta­ge had on­ce sto­od.</p>
   <p>    Anigel bro­ke in­to exc­la­ma­ti­ons of dis­may and wept at the shoc­king dis­co­very. For a mo­ment she even won­de­red whet­her the­ir me­eting with the Arc­hi­ma­ge yes­ter­day had all be­en a dre­am. But then she fo­und be­ne­ath her sle­ep-sack a lar­ge gre­en le­af with a gol­den ve­in tra­cing a win­ding path from tip to stem; and Im­mu, in­ves­ti­ga­ting down ne­ar the ed­ge of the wa­ter, ga­ve a sud­den cry:</p>
   <p>    "Look lo­ok lo­ok! The Whi­te Lady left us a pre­sent!"</p>
   <p>    Still snif­fling, Ani­gel craw­led from her co­vers and ca­me to the la­go­on­si­de. The­re among the tall re­eds and put­rid yel­low wa­ter-flo­wers was a bo­at. It was not a Uis­gu craft ma­de of re­eds, such as had car­ri­ed them to Noth, but the lar­ger Nysso­mu mo­del car­ved from a ka­la trunk that com­monly pli­ed the wa­ters aro­und the Ci­ta­del. Only one thing was dif­fe­rent abo­ut this bo­at -in ad­di­ti­on to the usu­al swe­eps and row­locks (which we­re de­mo­un­ted and strap­ped to the in­si­de of the hull) it had at the stem a sto­ut fit­ting to which a pa­ir of tra­ces we­re snap­ped, and at the bow twin rings, thro­ugh which two le­at­her straps ca­me and res­ted on the for­ward thwart. The lengths of le­at­her led from the bo­at down in­to the murky wa­ter.</p>
   <p>    Anigel stu­di­ed this ar­ran­ge­ment for a mo­ment, won­de­ring. "You don't sup­po­se - " And then she ga­ve a shri­ek as two lar­ge he­ads clot­hed in dap­ple-gre­en fur ro­se out of the wa­ter, sle­ek and fi­er­ce, with big black eyes, brist­ling whis­kers, and fan­ged mo­uths open in a hos­ti­le hiss.</p>
   <p>    "Rimoriks!" sa­id Im­mu. "Oh, de­ar…"</p>
   <p>    "But -but the­re are no Uis­gu to dri­ve them," the Prin­cess fal­te­red.</p>
   <p>    "And yet it se­ems that the Arc­hi­ma­ge in­tends for us to use this very ef­fi­ci­ent me­ans of trans­port."</p>
   <p>    Anigel bit her lip. She co­uld not lo­ok Im­mu in the eye. "Do you think that you co­uld ma­na­ge?"</p>
   <p>    "No, Prin­cess Ani­gel," the Od­dling wo­man sa­id, so­lemnly. "The be­asts work only in fri­ends­hip, with tho­se who drink the sac­red mi­ton."</p>
   <p>    Trembling, Ani­gel tur­ned to the two wa­ter-cre­atu­res. "Did the Arc­hi­ma­ge send you to help us?" she as­ked them.</p>
   <p>    The only res­pon­se was a vi­ci­o­us hiss. The ri­mo­riks sur­ged up and down in the wa­ter im­pa­ti­ently, re­ve­aling the har­ness that at­tac­hed them to the bo­at, which roc­ked wildly in the wa­ves they ma­de and tug­ged at the mo­oring li­ne that had be­en ti­ed to a rock on the sho­re.</p>
   <p>    Anigel clo­sed her eyes. "Immu, can you not drink the mi­ton?"</p>
   <p>    "No, child." The old nur­se's vo­ice was gent­le. "It was a gift to you from the Uis­gu… and now we know why." Le­aving the girl stan­ding the­re, Im­mu went back up the slo­pe and gat­he­red the­ir things, to­get­her with so­me of the brud­dok fru­it to eke out the tra­il ra­ti­ons that wo­uld be the­ir bre­ak­fast. When she re­tur­ned she put the packs in­to the bo­at and held out the scar­let mi­ton go­urd to the Prin­cess.</p>
   <p>    Anigel to­ok it. Her eyes we­re gla­zed and her che­eks still damp with te­ars. She re­mo­ved the stop­per and lif­ted the small net­ted con­ta­iner so that the ri­mo­riks co­uld see it. "I must drink - is that it?"</p>
   <p>    The gre­at wa­ter-be­asts clo­sed the­ir mo­uths and sank back in­to the la­go­on so that only the­ir no­ses and dark sus­pi­ci­o­us eyes we­re abo­ve the wa­ves. They watc­hed Ani­gel, mo­ti­on­less.</p>
   <p>    One of her hands gro­ped for the tril­li­um amu­let. The ot­her lif­ted the blo­od-drink to her pa­le lips. She to­ok a small sip -</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>You see, Brot­her, how the hu­man fe­ma­le fe­ars you.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>She fe­ars the mi­ton even mo­re, and yet she has drunk of it. Hu­man! Do you he­ar us? Do you wish to be our fri­end?</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Yes," whis­pe­red Ani­gel.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Then dip two fin­gers in­to the mi­ton, wa­de in­to the wa­ter, and sha­re the drink with us.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Dazed, she obe­yed, tuc­king her grass ro­be up in­to her belt. The warm mud of the la­go­on bot­tom oozed up bet­we­en her ba­re to­es as she wal­ked out to whe­re the wa­ter re­ac­hed her kne­es. She ex­ten­ded her hand with brow­nish li­qu­id drip­ping from the fin­gers.</p>
   <p>    The two gre­at gre­en-spot­ted ani­mals gli­ded up to her, res­ting on the­ir fo­re­limbs in the shal­lows and ope­ning wi­de the­ir glit­te­ring jaws. Whip­li­ke ton­gu­es with po­in­ted ends un­co­iled, or­gans that co­uld pi­er­ce the sca­led bo­di­es of fish as easily as a jave­lin. Ani­gel se­emed to see her­self from afar, as tho­ugh she we­re a spec­ta­tor at a fan­tas­tic dra­ma, and the girl in the wa­ter and the ri­mo­riks we­re me­re play-actors. First one fin­ger, then the ot­her to­uc­hed the ter­rib­le ton­gu­es. And as the ri­mo­riks swal­lo­wed the­ir fa­ces se­emed to chan­ge, ra­di­ating kind­ness ins­te­ad of sa­va­gery, and she no lon­ger fe­ared them.</p>
   <p>    Anigel res­top­pe­red the go­urd and put it in­to her belt-wal­let, whe­re the Black Tril­li­um le­af al­so lay sa­fe. She felt dizzy. The co­lors of the marsh­land fo­li­age, of the al­gae-clot­hed la­go­on wa­ter, even the car­ved wo­oden sur­fa­ces of the bo­at se­emed shar­pe­ned and mo­re vi­vid. She smel­led subt­le scents that had go­ne un­no­ti­ced be­fo­re, and he­ard such a mul­ti­tu­de of stran­ge and ove­ramp­li­fi­ed so­unds that for a mo­ment the­re was pa­in in her ears. Her very skin se­emed to crawl, shrin­king from the light to­uch of the bre­eze and the sud­denly scratchy and op­pres­si­ve fe­el of her gar­ments. Her sub­mer­ged legs, on the ot­her hand, felt ca­res­sed by the cur­rents of the wa­ter, and the mud was vel­vety and so­ot­hing aga­inst her fe­et.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>The mi­ton will chan­ge you.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>The mi­ton will ma­ke you ap­pre­hen­si­ve at first, bur­de­ning yo­ur fe­eb­le hu­man sen­ses. But this ma­la­ise will pass. You will fe­el strong and bra­ve, li­ke us.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Yes… I fe­el bet­ter al­re­ady."</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>This is go­od. This me­ant that we can in­de­ed be fri­ends with a hu­man. You will sha­re yo­ur in­tel­li­gen­ce with us, and you will par­ta­ke of our auda­city and strength.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "You call me in­tel­li­gent. I ha­ve ne­ver tho­ught of myself thus. But I will do my best to be so if you will only lend me bra­very, for wit­ho­ut it no amo­unt of cle­ver­ness will enab­le me to ful­fill my qu­est."</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>The Whi­te Lady ba­de us help you. We will do what we can.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Do you ha­ve na­mes?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>You co­uld not say them. Call us fri­ends.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "What-what do we do next?"</p>
   <p>    In her mind, Ani­gel he­ard the two ri­mo­riks la­ugh. But it was go­od old crotc­hety Im­mu who rep­li­ed.</p>
   <p>    "Do do do! And you are sup­po­sed to be the cle­ver one -? What a joke! The Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest is over three hund­red le­agu­es away, and we can­not even be­gin yo­ur qu­est un­til we get the­re. Sup­po­se you get in­to the punt, silly girl, and ta­ke up the re­ins, and get us star­ted on our way!"</p>
   <p>    The ri­mo­riks se­emed to know exactly what ro­ute to fol­low, ta­king the­ir cue from Ani­gel's study of the Black Tril­li­um le­af. They sped down the Ri­ver Not­har with reck­less aban­don, sin­ce the­re was no chan­ce that the La­bor­no­ki enemy was ab­ro­ad on its wa­ters. Of Ani­gel's sis­ter Prin­cess Ka­di­ya the­re was no tra­ce, ne­it­her co­uld the ri­mo­riks tell what had be­co­me of her. When the punt mo­ved in­to the bro­ader Up­per Mu­tar, Ani­gel inst­ruc­ted the be­asts to slow down and prog­ress mo­re ste­alt­hily, ke­eping clo­se to the banks so that the­re was less chan­ce of any enemy exp­lo­rers spot­ting them. Su­re eno­ugh, they saw half a do­zen punts full of La­bor­no­ki sco­uts prow­ling abo­ut in the wa­ters abo­ve Tre­vis­ta. But the enemy went abo­ut its bu­si­ness wit­ho­ut no­ti­cing them, even tho­ugh one of the La­bor­no­ki bo­ats pas­sed less than twenty ells away.</p>
   <p>    Each eve­ning, they wo­uld find a sa­fe stop­ping pla­ce. Ani­gel wo­uld un­har­ness the be­asts, stan­ding in shal­low wa­ter, and they wo­uld slip away to hunt. So­me of the fish and ot­her wa­ter-cre­atu­res that the ri­mo­riks ca­ught wo­uld be bro­ught back and sha­red with the­ir new fri­end, and in the mor­ning the wo­men wo­uld find a bre­ak­fast catch lying ne­ar the camp. But be­fo­re Ani­gel co­uld har­ness the ri­mo­riks aga­in, she wo­uld ha­ve to drink of the mi­ton, then sha­re it with the ani­mals.</p>
   <p>    On the fo­urth mor­ning of the down-ri­ver jo­ur­ney, the Prin­cess awo­ke in the hus­hed dark­ness be­fo­re dawn, when the night-cre­atu­res fell si­lent at last and tho­se who went abo­ut in day­light we­re not yet stir­ring. A he­avy fog en­ve­lo­ped the­ir tiny camp­si­te on an is­let on the outs­kirts of Tre­vis­ta, and all the fo­li­age drip­ped. It had be­en a stray drop of wa­ter, fal­ling from the over­tur­ned punt that was the­ir imp­ro­vi­sed shel­ter, that had awa­ke­ned Ani­gel.</p>
   <p>    Her sle­ep had aga­in be­en free from dre­ams.</p>
   <p>    She lay the­re in her down sle­ep sack, he­aring only the ir­re­gu­lar pat­ter of the drip­ping dew and Im­mu's gent­le sno­res, hol­ding tight her warm amu­let. No dre­ams of dro­ught and fi­re. No­ne sin­ce the night she and Im­mu had fal­len as­le­ep on the flo­or of the Whi­te lady's enc­han­ted cot­ta­ge. How stran­ge that she had not no­ti­ced it be­fo­re…</p>
   <p>    Am I re­al­ly cu­red of the co­war­di­ce? she as­ked her­self. No, that co­uld not be. She knew that she was still des­pe­ra­tely af­ra­id - af­ra­id of be­ing cap­tu­red by the La­bor­no­ki sol­di­ers and kil­led, af­ra­id of the track­less Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest and the fi­er­ce, un­fa­mi­li­ar abo­ri­gi­nes in­ha­bi­ting it, af­ra­id most of all of the dre­ad­ful ta­lis­man she so­ught, the Three He­aded Mons­ter.</p>
   <p>    And yet the night­ma­re was go­ne-the war­ning from her sec­ret self.</p>
   <p>    What did it me­an? She tho­ught of as­king Im­mu, but the Od­dling wo­man was sle­eping so­undly, mur­mu­ring so­me­ti­mes in her own lan­gu­age, and the Prin­cess had not the he­art to wa­ke her. Still won­de­ring, Ani­gel drif­ted back to sle­ep.</p>
   <p>    In the Lo­wer Mu­tar the­re we­re many flat­bo­ats lo­aded with tro­ops and sup­pli­es go­ing up and down the ri­ver. It se­emed as tho­ugh the con­qu­erors had com­man­de­ered the en­ti­re Ru­wen­di­an tra­de-fle­et - for what pur­po­se Ani­gel and Im­mu co­uld not gu­ess. They had a nar­row es­ca­pe one af­ter­no­on when, spe­eding aro­und a bend, they met a La­bor­no­ki flat­bo­at tra­in de­ad ahe­ad, co­ming at them on a col­li­si­on co­ur­se. Ani­gel clutc­hed her amu­let and tri­ed to ma­ke them in­vi­sib­le, but the charm re­fu­sed to work. Be­fo­re she co­uld pa­nic, ho­we­ver, the ri­mo­riks ab­ruptly chan­ged co­ur­se, stre­aking off at a right ang­le and con­ce­aling them be­hind a gre­at flo­ating snag. The men of La­bor­nok, half blin­ded by the wes­te­ring sun, sa­iled he­ed­les­sly on.</p>
   <p>    As the punt ap­pro­ac­hed mo­re po­pu­lo­us re­gi­ons abo­ve the Ci­ta­del, the Prin­cess di­rec­ted the ri­mo­riks to swim thro­ugh the most obs­cu­re si­de-chan­nels and back­wa­ters that they co­uld find, to ke­ep them out of the enemy's sight. The­ir go­od luck be­gan to se­em al­most su­per­na­tu­ral. They did not tra­vel as fast as they had from Tre­vis­ta to Noth, sin­ce they co­uld not chan­ge ani­mals as the Uis­gu dri­vers Lebb and Ti­rebb had do­ne; but they ma­na­ged a go­od ra­te of spe­ed ne­vert­he­less, and we­re spa­red from many a na­tu­ral dan­ger to bo­aters, such as the gi­ant flesh-eating mi­lin­gal-fish in­fes­ting the Black­mi­re sec­ti­on of the Lo­wer Mu­tar, be­ca­use of the for­mi­dab­le na­tu­re of the ri­mo­riks. Most ot­her wa­ter-cre­atu­res ga­ve the big gre­en-fur­red car­ni­vo­res a wi­de berth.</p>
   <p>    The first ge­nu­ine di­sas­ter thre­ate­ned on a day when they we­re en­cam­ped a few le­agu­es abo­ve the Ci­ta­del, awa­iting night­fall so as to pass the Knoll mo­re sa­fely in the dark. Ani­gel dis­co­ve­red that the red go­urd of mi­ton was empty. Its stop­per had co­me lo­ose, and the pre­ci­o­us li­qu­id had dra­ined away.</p>
   <p>    "This is aw­ful!" the Prin­cess cri­ed. "That this sho­uld hap­pen he­re, at the most dan­ge­ro­us part of the ri­ver, whe­re the enemy sol­di­ers are everyw­he­re! Wit­ho­ut the mi­ton, the ri­mo­riks will not even al­low us to get in­to the bo­at. You re­call the one mor­ning when I for­got the ri­tu­al - they ba­red the­ir te­eth at me as tho­ugh I we­re a per­fect stran­ger! Oh, Im­mu, what are we go­ing to do? If the ri­mo­riks don't help us, we'll ne­ver be ab­le to re­ach the Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest."</p>
   <p>    Immu sa­id: "The­re is only one pos­sib­le co­ur­se of ac­ti­on. You must ma­ke mo­re mi­ton."</p>
   <p>    "But how?" the girl fret­ted. And then her blue eyes went wi­de with the re­ali­za­ti­on of what wo­uld ha­ve to be do­ne. "But I can't do it!" she mo­aned. "Not even to myself-much less to <emphasis>them</emphasis>."</p>
   <p>    "I can help draw yo­ur own blo­od," Im­mu sa­id. "The pro­cess is not even pa­in­ful, be­yond the first prick. But you will ha­ve to co­pe with yo­ur fi­ne sharp-to­ot­hed fri­ends yo­ur­self. They wo­uld swal­low me in one gulp if I ca­me at them with my bla­de."</p>
   <p>    After an in­ter­lu­de of squ­e­amish he­si­ta­ti­on, the Prin­cess fi­nal­ly sub­mit­ted. Im­mu to­ok cer­ta­in thick le­aves and squ­e­ezed a ju­ice from them, then pi­er­ced a ve­in on the girl's wrist with her sharp lit­tle dag­ger. Ani­gel ma­de not a so­und. The le­af-li­qu­or, drip­ped upon the small wo­und, in­hi­bi­ted the blo­od's clot­ting and a con­ca­ve dro­go le­af was so­on fil­led. When this was do­ne and the Prin­cess's blo­od po­ured in­to the go­urd, Im­mu was­hed the punc­tu­re with pu­re dew-wa­ter and bo­und it up tightly af­ter pres­sing a me­di­ci­nal blue flo­wer to it.</p>
   <p>    "There!" The Od­dling ti­ed a ne­at knot to the wrist ban­da­ge of grass. "But how you will ble­ed the ri­mo­riks, I ha­ve no idea."</p>
   <p>    "I will ask them," Ani­gel sa­id. And the cre­atu­res told her:</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Bring a duh-le­af in­to the bo­at.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    The gre­at ani­mals we­re un­har­nes­sed, pad­dling aro­und the stern of the par­ti­al­ly be­ac­hed punt. When Ani­gel craw­led in­to the end that was af­lo­at, they drew ne­ar. One af­ter the ot­her, they re­ared up, nip­ped the ed­ges of the­ir bec­la­wed front flip­pers, and let blo­od flow in­to the dro­go le­af. When it was fil­led one of the ri­mo­riks swam off and re­tur­ned with a red-flo­we­red swamp­herb, which it had rip­ped up ro­ots and all.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Grab a tu­ber of this plant and mix it with the blo­od. Thus is mi­ton ma­de. The swamp Folk cus­to­ma­rily stra­in the li­qu­id, but this is not re­al­ly ne­ces­sary.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Thank you, my fri­ends," Ani­gel sa­id.</p>
   <p>    She fol­lo­wed the­ir inst­ruc­ti­ons, and when she had fi­nis­hed the go­urd was full of the brown, salty-swe­et-tas­ting sac­red drink. The Prin­cess was so used to it by now that she tho­ught no ill of the drin­king, and the sub­se­qu­ent he­igh­te­ning of her sen­ses had be­gun to se­em so nor­mal to her that she did not fe­el that she was truly awa­ke in the mor­ning un­til she and the ri­mo­riks had com­mu­ned.</p>
   <p>    Much la­ter, du­ring the night-shro­uded small ho­urs of the next day, when they had ne­arly comp­le­ted the pe­ri­lo­us skir­ting of the Ci­ta­del Knoll and we­re ra­cing thro­ugh a back­wa­ter bor­de­ring the Gre­en­mi­re,</p>
   <p>    Anigel tho­ught to ask Im­mu whet­her or not the mi­ton had chan­ged her per­so­na­lity-as it was sa­id to chan­ge that of the Nysso­mu who drank it.</p>
   <p>    Immu sa­id: "You are the sa­me de­ar per­son I ha­ve al­ways lo­ved - alt­ho­ugh per­haps mo­re ma­tu­re and worldly-wi­se from our tra­vels, and much less da­inty abo­ut yo­ur fo­od, and not ne­arly so ho­ity-to­ity abo­ut whe­re you lay yo­ur he­ad at night or re­li­eve yo­ur body's ne­eds. You ha­ve al­so tur­ned in­to a de­mon bo­at-dri­ver. Whet­her yo­ur own pe­op­le wo­uld co­unt all this an imp­ro­ve­ment, I can­not say."</p>
   <p>    Anigel spo­ke over her sho­ul­der. "Sin­ce le­aving Noth, I ha­ve not had the night­ma­res. Do you think this me­ans I've grown bra­ve, Im­mu?"</p>
   <p>    "Either bra­ve or mad­cap," the old wo­man sa­id gro­uc­hily. She was hol­ding on for de­ar li­fe as the punt zip­ped in and out of a den­se gro­ve of ka­las north of the Gre­at Ca­use­way. For on­ce the­re was no night-mist, and the Trip­le Mo­ons glim­me­red thro­ugh the moss-hung branc­hes. "Just lo­ok at you, Prin­cess, grip­ping the re­ins li­ke a ve­te­ran vo­lum­ni­al-skin­ner as we char­ge thro­ugh the dark­ness fas­ter than ma­ra­uding Skri­tek! You ha­ve co­me a long way from the ti­mes when you tho­ught yo­ur­self da­ring to at­tempt a new step on the dan­ce flo­or or an un­fa­mi­li­ar emb­ro­idery stitch."</p>
   <p>    "And yet I still fe­el fe­ar, Im­mu."</p>
   <p>    "Of co­ur­se you do. So do I -for go­od re­ason! If you don't slow tho­se wretc­hed cre­atu­res down, we may end up wrap­ped aro­und a tree with the night-warb­lers gig­gling over our bro­ken bo­nes."</p>
   <p>    Anigel re­ined in the ri­mo­riks a lit­tle. "They see in the dark. The­re is no re­al dan­ger he­re. It li­es not far ahe­ad, tho­ugh. I - I fe­el it."</p>
   <p>    "That may be true."</p>
   <p>    "Do you sup­po­se my sis­ters al­so are se­arc­hing for the­ir own fe­ar­so­me ta­lis­mans?"</p>
   <p>    "Probably."</p>
   <p>    "The Whi­te Lady is cru­el to se­pa­ra­te us!" Ani­gel cri­ed out sud­denly. "We we­re born to­get­her. We ha­ve li­ved our who­le li­ves to­get­her. It wo­uld ha­ve be­en so much easi­er if she had let us sha­re our qu­ests. Had let us help one anot­her!"</p>
   <p>    "No do­ubt," mut­te­red the Nysso­mu wo­man we­arily. Her he­ad dro­oped and her long ears lay blas­ted flat by the spe­ed-wind aga­inst the dirty lawn of her old co­urt he­ad­dress, which she per­sis­ted in we­aring. "But you ha­ve not lac­ked for fa­ith­ful ser­vants."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess bit off the fresh comp­la­int that ho­ve­red on her lips. She <emphasis>had</emphasis> be­en hel­ped by many abo­ri­gi­nes, to say not­hing of the ri­mo­riks. But her most cons­tant hel­per and com­pa­ni­on had be­en Im­mu her­self- and how much true ap­pre­ci­ati­on had Ani­gel shown her de­ar old nur­se sin­ce they set out on this ter­rib­le jo­ur­ney? She had ta­ken Im­mu for gran­ted, ne­ver thin­king of how frigh­te­ned and we­ary the old wo­man must be. And now they had both be­en awa­ke for that who­le day and most of the night, Im­mu ha­ving re­fu­sed the Prin­cess's sug­ges­ti­on that she nap du­ring the night tra­vel. Ani­gel was still char­ged with energy and ex­ci­te­ment, eager to con­ti­nue on, and the ri­mo­riks, sen­sing her ur­gency, we­re wil­ling. But Im­mu was pla­inly ex­ha­us­ted…</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Find us a sa­fe stop­ping pla­ce</emphasis>, she told the ani­mals.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Yes, fri­end</emphasis>, they sa­id. And the punt slo­wed, tur­ned asi­de, and gli­ded thro­ugh a thick cur­ta­in of night-flo­we­ring vi­nes. Ahe­ad was a high, dry hum­mock. As the bo­at scra­ped bot­tom, Im­mu snor­ted. Her he­ad flew up and her eyes pop­ped open.</p>
   <p>    "Wake up, Im­mu," Ani­gel sa­id softly. "It's bed­ti­me."</p>

   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    They we­re be­ing tre­ated, Ka­di­ya knew, as ho­no­red gu­ests, and that por­ti­on of her which was ro­oted in pa­ti­en­ce, small tho­ugh it was, told her that this was per­haps all she might ex­pect. Still, on the se­cond day af­ter the­ir ar­ri­val at the Nysso­mu vil­la­ge, she ma­de one last at­tempt to win figh­ting aid from tho­se who hos­ted her. Af­ter all, it was not only her ne­ed to gat­her al­li­es that mat­te­red; the­se vil­la­gers sho­uld al­so pre­pa­re for the worst - the pro­bab­le ar­ri­val of the La­bor­no­ki in­va­ders.</p>
   <p>    She as­ked for anot­her me­eting with the First of the Ho­use, stri­ving to set a re­in on her usu­al he­ad­long de­mand for what she be­li­eved was ne­ces­sary.</p>
   <p>    "Lady," she scho­oled her vo­ice in­to a low and le­vel to­ne, "the­se hu­mans who now co­me in­to yo­ur land are not as we Ru­wen­di­ans. Let me tell you stra­ightly of the­ir de­eds."</p>
   <p>    Her hands, which had be­en lying lo­osely in her lap, sud­denly clutc­hed each ot­her in a pu­nis­hing grip. She had to swal­low twi­ce be­fo­re she la­unc­hed in­to the ter­rib­le ac­co­unt of her Fat­her's de­ath. At the pic­tu­re her words sum­mo­ned up she for­ced na­usea to be­co­me an­ger.</p>
   <p>    It was dif­fi­cult to re­ad subt­le exp­res­si­on on any Od­dling fa­ce. Ka­di­ya watc­hed very ca­re­ful­ly for any sign that the First was mo­ved by what she told baldly in all its hor­ror.</p>
   <p>    "Thus they tre­ated our pe­op­le they to­ok af­ter ho­nest bat­tle," she conc­lu­ded. "Lady, they hold yo­ur pe­op­le in even gre­ater con­tempt - what do you think they wo­uld do he­re, we­re they to ta­ke yo­ur vil­la­ge? The Mi­res hold yo­ur sec­rets and ha­ve be­en yo­ur walls of de­fen­se. But the­se La­bor­no­ki bring with them a sor­ce­rer aga­inst who­se will the Arc­hi­ma­ge's pro­tec­ti­on co­uld not stand. To fight with ho­nest ste­el, sword to sword, is one thing. To stri­ve aga­inst black ma­gic with no pro­per we­apon is to fa­ce de­fe­at be­fo­re the bat­tle­horns so­und. This is yo­ur land, and one wholly unk­nown to the in­va­ders. They se­em to ha­ve al­re­ady alig­ned with the Skri­tek-who­se evil na­tu­re they cer­ta­inly sha­re. But that can be co­un­te­red by yo­ur know­led­ge of the swamp it­self. I say to you - even if yo­ur cus­toms do not al­low you to ta­ke up our ca­use, lo­ok to yo­ur own!"</p>
   <p>    The First sat for a mo­ment in si­len­ce be­fo­re she ans­we­red, and for that sa­me mo­ment Ka­di­ya knew a fa­int stir of ho­pe. Per­haps the sen­se of what she had told this Nysso­mu wo­man wo­uld pre­va­il af­ter all. Let Ha­mil ta­ke Tre­vis­ta; let him sum­mon the Skri­tek; but if the Nysso­mu aro­se and used the land it­self as a we­apon, su­rely the­re was a chan­ce…</p>
   <p>    But when the First of the Ho­use spo­ke, her words we­re for­mal, hol­ding no warmth. "King's Da­ugh­ter, it is true that yo­ur pe­op­le and we of the Mi­res ha­ve de­alt easily to­get­her thro­ugh many ye­ars. The­re is no re­cord of any such hor­rors bet­we­en us as tho­se you ha­ve told me. Sin­ce the­se sla­in are yo­ur kin, it is cer­ta­inly true you will lo­ok for any help you can gat­her to aven­ge them. But fri­ends tho­ugh we be, the­re is for us an ol­der ser­vi­ce, an old al­le­gi­an­ce that rests with the Lady of Noth. She has sum­mo­ned you and yo­ur sis­ters. It can well be that she has al­re­ady so­me plan of ac­ti­on. Be su­re, ho­we­ver, that we are well war­ned. Be­fo­re yo­ur pe­op­le ca­me hit­her the Mi­res knew war…"</p>
   <p>    She was sta­ring be­yond Ka­di­ya's sho­ul­der as if she re­cog­ni­zed the­re so­met­hing of im­por­tan­ce. "The­re was long ago a har­ves­ting of li­ves be­yond all ac­co­un­ting. How think you did this land be­co­me as it is: bro­ken, in many parts, de­so­la­te, and fil­led with such pe­rils that we ha­ve not ven­tu­red along cer­ta­in paths for many hund­reds? That war was not ours, but we we­re born of it-and when tho­se who fo­ught it we­re go­ne, we we­re new­borns with a stran­ge world be­fo­re us which we had to ma­ke our own. Then we to­ok oath that such a war wo­uld not co­me aga­in thro­ugh any of us Nysso­mu. To the Lady of Noth we owe our li­ves. With her we ha­ve long kept pe­ace. If we are at­tac­ked we fight, but we carry no war to ot­hers. You will find yo­ur ans­wers at Noth, King's Da­ugh­ter."</p>
   <p>    So it was that only Ka­di­ya and Jagun set forth aga­in on the­ir jo­ur­ney, and the fart­her they went the stran­ger and mo­re thre­ate­ning be­ca­me the land. Most of the swamp growth in the Black­mi­re fo­rest had be­en va­ri­o­us sha­des of gre­en, sa­ve for the flo­wers. He­re in the Gol­den­mi­re grew the tall re­ed-grass with yel­low pa­nic­les which ga­ve its na­me to this sec­ti­on of the swamp. He­re, too, the­re we­re is­lets ri­sing from the gre­en-scum­med wa­ter on which the­re we­re clumps of lar­ge fleshy-le­aved plants, un­li­ke any el­sew­he­re. The­se we­re yel­low-whi­te with stre­aks of red ac­ross them. Se­eming to hold the ap­pe­aran­ce of in­fec­ted, un­he­aled wo­unds, they exu­ded a stench which ap­pe­ared to at­tract in­sects. The fart­her Jagun and the Prin­cess po­led the­ir way along, the mo­re ma­lig­nant be­ca­me the­se outc­rop­pings of ve­ge­ta­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    She he­ard a hiss of bre­ath from Jagun and ba­lan­ced her­self in the punt whi­le the hun­ter mo­ved with ca­re. Mo­ving to­ward them along the sho­re of an is­let ca­me what se­emed to be one of the unw­ho­le­so­me le­aves. At the vil­la­ge, Jagun had ad­ded to his equ­ip­ment a short-haf­ted spe­ar. Now his arm swung out and the bla­de ca­ught un­der the ed­ge of the wan­de­ring le­af, flip­ping it up in­to the air and back to the muddy earth it had just left. As it aro­se the girl co­uld see frin­ge-li­ke fe­et mo­ving, va­inly hun­ting purc­ha­se. Then the cre­atu­re slam­med aga­inst a mossy pi­ece of wo­od and ins­tantly cur­led abo­ut it.</p>
   <p>    "Snafi," Jagun sa­id ter­sely. "We must watch for them he­re. The­ir cla­wed fe­et inj­ect po­ison in­to the skin and on­ce they ha­ve ta­ken hold they can­not be pul­led off."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya was glad that on le­aving the Nysso­mu vil­la­ge Jagun had de­ci­ded that they we­re far eno­ugh away from the known tra­il to tra­vel by day. This part of the Mi­re must be a se­ri­es of vi­ci­o­us traps of one kind or anot­her.</p>
   <p>    Against her bre­ast the amu­let lay warm and was a ste­ad­fast gu­ide. Ac­cor­ding to its spark they we­re still bo­und in the right di­rec­ti­on. Ka­di­ya kept to the rhythm of the po­les, fit­ting her swing to Jagun's for ho­ur aga­inst ho­ur, tho­ugh they did halt at in­ter­vals to rest.</p>
   <p>    If she fa­ced dan­ger, Ka­di­ya tho­ught, what had Ha­ra­mis fo­und to fight aga­inst? And Ani­gel… Had her yo­un­ger sis­ter be­en ta­ken? So­me­how she felt mo­re and mo­re strongly that both of her sis­ters had es­ca­ped from the Ci­ta­del, we­re not help­less prey for King Volt­rik.</p>
   <p>    The sky had ste­adily clo­uded over du­ring the af­ter­no­on and it was ne­ar twi­light when Jagun twis­ted a to­ugh clump of grass to anc­hor the­ir craft. Al­re­ady tho­se qu­e­er lights which we­re born of the swamp ga­ses we­re vi­sib­le. This eve­ning, they did not try to di­sem­bark from the punt but ate ra­ti­ons they had bro­ught with them. And then Jagun sa­id:</p>
   <p>    "Sleep."</p>
   <p>    Sleep! How co­uld an­yo­ne sle­ep he­re; in the dark, not kno­wing what me­na­ce might co­me from eit­her sho­re? But in spi­te of her­self she fo­und that her eyes we­re clo­sing…</p>
   <p>    What fol­lo­wed se­emed mo­re vi­si­on than dre­am. Ka­di­ya saw a city - not Tre­vis­ta, but one far yo­un­ger, its arc­hi­tec­tu­re ligh­ter in spi­rit. Ho­we­ver, no sent­ri­es wal­ked its walls, nor pas­sed thro­ugh the open ga­te which ap­pe­ared just be­fo­re her. Was this Noth? She lon­ged to en­ter it - it bec­ko­ned, cal­led. It was a pro­mi­se.</p>
   <p>    Then the vi­si­on was lost in a de­eper dre­am of which she re­mem­be­red not­hing on wa­king. She ro­used at dawn, to dis­co­ver Jagun al­re­ady as­tir, dig­ging in­to one of the­ir fo­od bags. A short ti­me la­ter, they re­su­med the­ir jo­ur­ney to the Arc­hi­ma­ge's ho­me, and in early af­ter­no­on they ca­ught the­ir first glimp­se of it.</p>
   <p>    No such city as Ka­di­ya had dre­amt of ro­se be­fo­re them as they ap­pro­ac­hed the­ir go­al. They saw only a sing­le mo­no­lit­hic to­wer, ri­sing high abo­ve the gol­den-plu­med grass. Ka­di­ya sta­red up at it as Jagun ne­go­ti­ated the fi­nal twists of the wa­ter­way, and at length the­ir bo­at gra­ted, not aga­inst anot­her mud bank, but on the ed­ge of an area of sto­ne blocks.</p>
   <p>    "This is Noth," Jagun sa­id. "From he­re, only you who ha­ve be­en sum­mo­ned may go. I shall awa­it you."</p>
   <p>    The pa­ve­ment was not much wi­der than the punt which had bro­ught them he­re. Be­yond sto­od the to­wer. It co­uld ha­ve be­en car­ved from a sing­le mo­un­ta­in-si­zed block of gra­ni­te, as tall as one of the gre­at ro­yal tre­es of the so­ut­hern fo­rests. The hu­ge do­or sto­od open.</p>
   <p>    Although the light did not re­ach far wit­hin that ca­ver­no­us do­or­way, the­re was not­hing abo­ut the to­wer which out­wardly thre­ate­ned. Still, Ka­di­ya felt li­ke a child abo­ut to ans­wer for so­me act of di­so­be­di­en­ce as she stro­de re­so­lu­tely for­ward, re­fu­sing to bet­ray her une­ase.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>"Welcome, Ka­di­ya."</emphasis></p>
   <p>    The vo­ice did not ec­ho down that nar­row hall, nor did it so­und ot­her than a usu­al gre­eting. Still, she wal­ked on with one hand at kni­fe hilt and the ot­her pres­sed over the amu­let, which throb­bed warmly aga­inst her flesh in a he­art-even be­at. Then she en­te­red the cham­ber be­yond.</p>
   <p>    There sto­od a high-bac­ked cha­ir of pre­sen­ce, such as her Mot­her and Fat­her had used at ti­mes of ce­re­mony. In it the Lady who ru­led Noth (and per­haps el­sew­he­re al­so) sat, her long-fin­ge­red hands smo­ot­hing back and forth ac­ross her kne­es the ed­ge of a clo­ak which was the black of a stormy night, thick in its folds. Yet the­re ran ac­ross it ru­nes of sil­ver which ca­me and went as do the rip­ples on a po­ol in­to which one casts a peb­ble or two.</p>
   <p>    Judging by her si­ze, she was cer­ta­inly not of Od­dling blo­od. In fact, stan­ding she might ha­ve over­top­ped Ka­di­ya by se­ve­ral hands' he­ight. Her fa­ce was ne­it­her yo­ung nor old, re­mo­ved from the to­uch of age, but her eyes sho­wed both we­ari­ness and de­ter­mi­ned will.</p>
   <p>    "Kadiya!" She inc­li­ned her he­ad, but not in any warmth of wel­co­me.</p>
   <p>    The an­ger which Ka­di­ya held wit­hin her ne­arly bro­ke its bonds. She wan­ted to hurl both her ire and her hurt at this un­to­uc­hed stran­ger, to de­mand from her own lips why her ma­gic had fa­iled. Co­uld she not ha­ve in so­me way rest­ra­ined the ene­mi­es of Ru­wen­da? Was this pro­ud Lady of Noth so much less than Oro­gas­tus? Her ma­gic cer­ta­inly had fa­iled when it was ne­eded the most! The girl was ab­le only with ef­fort to for­be­ar vo­icing tho­se harsh tho­ughts. Ins­te­ad she inc­li­ned her he­ad, stre­aked as it was with swamp gre­ase.</p>
   <p>    "Lady."</p>
   <p>    She had no chan­ce, she sen­sed, for eit­her ac­cu­sa­ti­on or rep­ro­ach. The­re was that he­re which held her emo­ti­onal­ly pri­so­ner, no less than her body wo­uld be had cha­ins wrap­ped abo­ut her wrists at the ent­ran­ce to the to­wer.</p>
   <p>    "There co­mes an end to everyt­hing," the co­lor­less vo­ice con­ti­nu­ed. The ne­ar trans­pa­rent hands had ce­ased the­ir smo­ot­hing of the mant­le. "Ti­me is of our ma­king, so it va­ri­es. What is the pas­sing of a ye­ar to one of the mo­un­ta­ins? What is sun­ri­se to sun­set for the draf­fer-fly, which li­ves for a sing­le of our co­un­ted days? To each of us - plant, bird, in­sect, sto­ne, pro­ud man and wo­man - ti­me brings an end. Thus, for tho­se of us who still fo­re­see a pur­po­se, the­re is much to be do­ne in what se­ems the nar­ro­west of me­asu­res."</p>
   <p>    For the first ti­me her eyes no lon­ger loc­ked with Ka­di­ya's but mo­ved, as if she we­re lo­oking abo­ut her in surp­ri­se, fin­ding mis­sing what sho­uld be the­re, or el­se se­e­ing that which had no pla­ce. "I ha­ve held wards­hip he­re. Yes, he­re I ha­ve gu­ar­ded that which is of the Light. On­ce the­re was a gre­at spre­ad of wa­ter, gra­ced by is­lands, each of which was a gem of be­a­uty. And the­re we­re tho­se who dwelt the­re. By them" -her hands ca­me to­get­her as if to sug­gest a ro­of of pro­tec­ti­on - "I was cal­led upon for a gre­at task, for evil ca­me, and chan­ge, and I la­bo­red to ra­ise strong wards."</p>
   <p>    She sig­hed. "That ti­me of tro­ub­le and sor­row pas­sed. Then tho­se you call Od­dlings ven­tu­red out, and to them, tho­ugh they we­re not of my pe­op­le, I re­ma­ined Gu­ar­di­an. Ti­me be­ca­me he­avi­er and he­avi­er, chip­ped away at what had be­en. Last of all ar­ri­ved tho­se of yo­ur blo­od. I se­arc­hed the­ir minds and he­arts and fo­und they we­re worthy of the Way of the Light and my day was not yet do­ne…"</p>
   <p>    "And then ca­me Volt­rik, who is of the pat­tern of the Skri­tek!" bla­zed Ka­di­ya. "Whe­re then was yo­ur Gu­ar­di­ans­hip?"</p>
   <p>    "There ro­se on­ce mo­re the Dark Po­wers," the Arc­hi­ma­ge cor­rec­ted her. "Aga­inst such my kind must al­ways con­tend. With the­se in­va­ders was one well le­ar­ned in the Ol­dest Lo­re." She bo­wed her he­ad a frac­ti­on. "This ti­me may be his. Only one de­fen­se co­uld I ra­ise when I fo­re­saw the de­sign. You are one of the three, and each of you holds a ta­lent unt­ra­ined, a gift un­re­cog­ni­zed. It will be you who bring down the Dark Po­wers in the end - if you can pay the pri­ce of ti­me."</p>
   <p>    "And what pri­ce is that?" Ka­di­ya's chin was high. She still fo­ught aga­inst gi­ving any out­ward sign that the Arc­hi­ma­ge might be­li­eve her to be ove­ra­wed.</p>
   <p>    "That you find yo­ur ta­lis­man… and use it in ti­me."</p>
   <p>    "Talisman?" Ka­di­ya held out the amu­let, tho­ugh she did not ta­ke its cha­in from abo­ut her neck. "But this I ha­ve al­re­ady - and from yo­ur own hand, Lady, if the story is true."</p>
   <p>    "No, that has be­en but yo­ur gu­ide hit­her. You must use yo­ur own strength - and wit - to find the ta­lis­man that will gi­ve you po­wer. Ste­el has ever be­en yo­ur cho­ice: that is di­rect and qu­ick, but many ti­mes the most pe­ri­lo­us ro­ute to suc­cess. The­re are ot­her ways of win­ning bat­tles."</p>
   <p>    The Arc­hi­ma­ge aro­se from her thro­ne, stan­ding stra­ight and tall. Her mo­ve­ments we­re not const­ra­ined by old age, but rat­her the de­ter­mi­ned ones of a per­son who has a task to do and wo­uld get it do­ne. Ka­di­ya fo­und her­self lag­ging a step be­hind, and lengt­he­ned stri­de so that they ca­me out of the to­wer of Noth to­get­her.</p>
   <p>    Now the Arc­hi­ma­ge threw back the folds of her clo­ak. In the light of day the sil­ver rip­pled ac­ross the folds. She was hol­ding a plant, tho­ugh from whe­re she had pluc­ked it Ka­di­ya co­uld not gu­ess. By the flo­wer at its tip it was the fab­led Black Tril­li­um. Swiftly the Arc­hi­ma­ge bro­ke the stem half­way down, three fin­gers' length abo­ve the ha­ir-li­ke fi­la­ments of the ro­ots.</p>
   <p>    "This now will be yo­ur gu­ide - and with it you shall se­ek the Three-Lo­bed Bur­ning Eye."</p>
   <p>    She tos­sed the stem for­ward to­ward the wa­ter whe­re the punt id­led and Jagun lay as if as­le­ep. Ka­di­ya watc­hed it fall stra­ight, bre­ak wa­ter as might a well-aimed ar­row. But what was a Three-Lo­bed Bur­ning Eye? The Arc­hi­ma­ge must exp­la­in! Ka­di­ya was ti­red of trac­king thro­ugh the Mi­res, fol­lo­wing a ma­gi­cal gle­am to the ho­me of an in­com­pe­tent enc­hant­ress. She ne­eded mo­re in­for­ma­ti­on if she we­re to pur­sue her qu­est…</p>
   <p>    Kadiya sud­denly sto­od alo­ne on the pa­ve­ment. The­re was no lon­ger an­yo­ne be­si­de her and she had a strong fe­eling that if she we­re to go stor­ming back in­to the to­wer and se­arch it from top to bot­tom, she wo­uld not find its mist­ress.</p>
   <p>    Reluctantly and ang­rily she went to the punt. Jagun had ro­used and was sit­ting up, but Ka­di­ya lo­oked to the open wa­ter be­yond. The­re she saw, among the murky rip­ples which the swa­ying of the craft had aro­used, a fi­la­ment of light. Gre­en it was, but no sha­de of gre­en that she had ever se­en in the swamp: this was cle­arer, ligh­ter, glis­te­ning li­ke a gem, and yet the very fo­re­po­int of it was black, to be se­en only in the light ref­lec­ted by its length. When she got in­to the bo­at and re­ac­hed for a po­le that rod of gre­en and sab­le mo­ved. Not with the dar­ting swift­ness of so­met­hing ali­ve, but slowly, so that it wo­uld match the spe­ed of the­ir po­ling.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya ut­te­red a gre­at sigh. "We ha­ve a new gu­ide, Jagun, and a new qu­est. Let us be on our way."</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    The mo­un­ta­in wind ro­ared down the de­fi­le, al­re­ady car­rying a few sharp gra­ins of sle­et. The la­te af­ter­no­on sky still had are­as of blue, alt­ho­ugh clo­uds had be­en mas­sing all day in the so­uth abo­ve the hig­hest pin­nac­les of the Oho­gans - Mo­unt Brom, Mo­unt Gid­ris, and Mo­unt Ro­to­lo. The­re wo­uld su­rely be a storm be­fo­re night, one of the har­bin­gers of the win­ter mon­so­ons that we­re due in only two we­eks.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus was uns­pe­akably we­ary af­ter his eight-day jo­ur­ney from the Ru­wen­da Ci­ta­del. He had left his ar­med es­cort in the low­lands of La­bor­nok and now, all alo­ne, he ap­pro­ac­hed his sanc­tum high on Mo­unt Brom. Hud­dled de­ep wit­hin his fur clo­ak, he bes­po­ke his we­ary mo­unt and the two pack-fro­ni­als that tra­iled be­hind.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Onward! Ahe­ad is a warm barn, and rich madh to eat, and wa­ter to drink. See-I show it to you!… Fol­low the path! Climb strongly! We will catch Sight of it on­ce this switch­back ro­unds the outc­rop­ping yon­der. The­re! The­re! Hurry!</emphasis></p>
   <p>    The three fro­ni­als lif­ted the­ir he­ads, and the gil­ded tips of the­ir ant­lers gle­amed in the dying suns­hi­ne. The­ir nost­rils fla­red, for thanks to the sor­ce­rer's art they al­re­ady smel­led the fo­od that awa­ited them in the strong­hold at the he­ad of the ste­ep tra­il.</p>
   <p>    A shi­ning whi­te to­wer with black cre­ne­la­ti­ons and or­na­te black tra­cery abo­ut the win­dowf­ra­mes was in sight now, tuc­ked aga­inst a flank of Mo­unt Brom. The re­vi­ta­li­zed ani­mals bro­ke in­to a trot and then in­to a rol­ling can­ter. With the­ir leg ten­dons clic­king and the­ir ta­ils high in an­ti­ci­pa­ti­on they ra­ced up the last few hund­red ells and skid­ded to a stop, snor­ting and blo­wing, at the pre­ci­pi­ce that was the tra­il's end. Be­low yaw­ned a sharp cleft in the mo­un­ta­in­si­de ne­arly a le­ague in depth and per­haps fifty ells wi­de, ha­ving a thun­de­ring gla­ci­er-fed tor­rent in its depths. The sor­ce­rer's strong­hold lay on the op­po­si­te si­de of the gulf, and se­emed to be comp­le­tely inac­ces­sib­le. The sky was now comp­le­tely over­cast and it had be­co­me very cold.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus to­ok a small sil­ver pi­pe from his belt-wal­let and blew a high, thin no­te that was al­most lost in the how­ling of the wind. At on­ce the dark win­dows of the to­wer sprang alight, and light al­so sho­ne from the ope­ning do­or of the dis­tant ga­te­ho­use. The­re was a rumb­ling so­und. In the cliff wall di­rectly be­ne­ath the ga­te a squ­are ope­ning ap­pe­ared, and from it was ext­ru­ded a nar­row brid­ge with an un­der­si­de most stran­gely fra­med, which thrust out as the rumb­ling con­ti­nu­ed and even­tu­al­ly clo­sed the gap bet­we­en the tra­il and the to­wer.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus dis­mo­un­ted and blind­fol­ded the three fro­ni­als. Then he led them on fo­ot ac­ross the slen­der junc­tu­re, which had only a low ra­iling and was scar­cely a pa­ce in width, whi­le the ri­sing wind to­re at his fur mant­le and ca­used the struc­tu­re be­ne­ath his fe­et to tremb­le vi­olently. A fal­se step by the man or the ani­mals wo­uld ha­ve sent them all tumb­ling to the­ir de­aths. But Oro­gas­tus exer­ted his ma­gi­cal po­wers to ste­ady the brid­ge, and bes­po­ke the fro­ni­als in re­as­su­ran­ce. They fol­lo­wed him re­adily even when the first swirls of snow be­gan to fly, and they all ca­me sa­fely in­to the ga­te­ho­use at last. The sor­ce­rer then bar­red the do­or and pres­sed a de­vi­ce on the wall that ca­used the ma­gi­cal brid­ge to va­nish back in­si­de the mo­un­ta­in.</p>
   <p>    Home!</p>
   <p>    He threw off the he­avy furs with a sho­ut of re­li­ef. The fro­ni­als squ­e­aled and ram­ped a bit, and he la­ug­hed as he re­mo­ved the­ir blin­ders, un­sad­dled his mo­unt, and to­ok off the lo­ads from the pack-ani­mals. Then he led the fa­ith­ful cre­atu­res down a cor­ri­dor ligh­ted by pe­cu­li­ar lamps that sho­ne wit­ho­ut fla­mes, in­to a stab­le car­ved from li­ving rock that was ne­vert­he­less dry and equ­ip­ped with all things ne­ces­sary for the com­fort of the fro­ni­als. His grumb­ling as he fed and bed­ded them was go­od-hu­mo­red. Nor­mal­ly such work wo­uld be do­ne by his three de­di­ca­ted acoly­tes; but they we­re back in Ru­wen­da Ci­ta­del, ten­ding King Volt­rik and awa­iting his or­ders, and so the Mas­ter wo­uld ha­ve to ca­ter both for the be­asts and for him­self. He knew how to ma­na­ge the ho­mely du­ti­es full well, for the three Vo­ices had be­en rec­ru­ited only ten ye­ars sin­ce. Be­fo­re that Oro­gas­tus had te­nan­ted this ela­bo­ra­te la­ir, bu­ilt on his di­rec­ti­on by Volt­rik's crafts­men, all alo­ne.</p>
   <p>    Now, as he clim­bed the win­ding sto­ne sta­ir­way to his apart­ments in mid-to­wer, he felt glad that no ot­hers we­re he­re. The past ten we­eks had be­en the most ar­du­o­us and stres­sful of his li­fe -first with the old King's de­ath and Volt­rik's ac­ces­si­on, then with the pre­pa­ra­ti­ons for the in­va­si­on and the march in­to Ru­wen­da. The vic­tory it­self had be­en pa­ra­do­xi­cal­ly easy; only the fre­akish wo­un­ding of King Volt­rik and the es­ca­pe of the three Prin­ces­ses had mar­red the sor­ce­rer's grand sche­me.</p>
   <p>    Well, the Vo­ices had as­su­red him that Volt­rik was on the mend at last, and if all went well, the girls' hi­ding pla­ces wo­uld shortly be sec­ret no lon­ger. He wo­uld ta­ke ca­re of that bu­si­ness im­me­di­ately, post­po­ning his own hu­man ne­eds un­til he had con­sul­ted the ice-mir­ror.</p>
   <p>    He ca­me in­to his ro­oms and left the bund­les of sup­pli­es ne­ar the he­arth of the di­ning-cham­ber, pa­using only long eno­ugh to light the pre-la­id fi­re with his ma­gi­cal spar­ker. Then he hur­ri­ed in­to his bed­ro­om to chan­ge from his so­iled tra­ve­ling garb in­to the sil­ver-and-black vest­ments and he­ad­ge­ar that he wo­re for the most so­lemn in­can­ta­ti­ons.</p>
   <p>    He did not want to ta­ke the ti­me to bat­he, but he spon­ged off the worst of the gri­me and beg­ged par­don of the Dark Po­wers-then chuck­led as the tho­ught struck him that They might ac­tu­al­ly pre­fer him to com­mu­ne with them in a grimy sta­te. The fi­ne me­tal­lic mesh of the ce­re­mo­ni­al ro­be was shoc­kingly cold upon his ba­re skin, and he win­ced whi­le don­ning it and for­got to say the ap­prop­ri­ate pra­yers. His sil­ver-gla­ce le­at­her ga­unt­lets and the dra­ma­tic star-burst he­ad­pi­ece with its half-mask we­re war­mer, but he esc­he­wed his usu­al ri­tu­al san­dals and slip­ped his fe­et in­to fur-li­ned bo­ots be­fo­re he­ading for the tun­nel that led de­ep in­to the mo­un­ta­in to the Ca­vern of Black Ice.</p>
   <p>    His bre­ath was vi­sib­le in the cold, hu­mid air of the rock tu­be. He wal­ked briskly along the lamp­lit shaft, pra­ying that the ice-mir­ror wo­uld grant him his bo­on promptly, wit­ho­ut bal­king. One ne­ver knew with the mar­ve­lo­us de­vi­ces of the Va­nis­hed Ones. Even if the pro­per ri­tu­als we­re ob­ser­ved and po­wer­ful enab­ling spells chan­ted, the ma­gic co­uld be cap­ri­ci­o­us. But ple­ase -not to­night, when he was so we­ary and hungry and cold!</p>
   <p>    He ca­me to the mas­si­ve do­or, frost-co­ve­red even in the war­mest we­at­her, bra­ced him­self, and ut­te­red the first in­can­ta­ti­on. He as­ked par­don of the Va­nis­hed Ones for dis­tur­bing the­ir an­ci­ent tran­qu­il­lity, but ad­mo­nis­hed them sternly in the na­me of the Dark Po­wers to ser­ve him. Then he ope­ned the do­or.</p>
   <p>    The Ca­vern of Black Ice was as al­ways. As he had fo­und it -sum­mo­ned to it! -when he first ar­ri­ved in La­bor­nok with then Crown Prin­ce Volt­rik. (Only la­ter had Oro­gas­tus com­man­ded the strong­hold to be bu­ilt, to shi­eld the Ca­vern and pro­vi­de re­ady ac­cess to its won­ders.) It was a lar­ge va­ul­ted cham­ber hewn cru­dely from the qu­artz-ve­ined gra­ni­te of Mo­unt Brom, ha­ving int­ru­si­ons of black ice he­re and the­re in the walls. The flo­or was pa­ved with stran­ge black ti­les li­ke glossy ob­si­di­an, and the sa­me ma­te­ri­al - it­self clo­sely re­semb­ling the ice - had be­en used to const­ruct a myri­ad of in­set nic­hes and tiny ro­oms, all fit­ted with do­ors. In the­se he had ori­gi­nal­ly fo­und the fan­tas­tic de­vi­ces that had se­du­ced him from the mo­re abst­ract ma­gic he had le­ar­ned from Bon­da­nus, whi­le pa­ra­do­xi­cal­ly gu­aran­te­e­ing his inf­lu­en­ce over the King­dom of La­bor­nok. Many of the com­part­ments we­re equ­ip­ped with ar­ca­ne locks that he had be­en unab­le to open. Ot­hers - inc­lu­ding the ro­om of the ice-mir­ror - had yi­el­ded the­ir sec­rets wil­lingly.</p>
   <p>    He ra­ised his sil­ver-glo­ved hands and in­to­ned alo­ud: "O Dark Po­wers! On­ce aga­in I thank you for yo­ur gre­at gifts. Let me use them wit­ho­ut co­ming to harm." Then he slid open a nar­row ob­si­di­an do­or and en­te­red the mir­ror-ro­om.</p>
   <p>    It was only a few pa­ces de­ep. Most of the in­ner wall was a lumpy mass of thick ho­arf­rost, which ef­fec­ti­vely hid wha­te­ver myste­ri­o­us de­vi­ces flan­ked the cir­cu­lar mir­ror it­self. Tremb­ling from cold and ap­pre­hen­si­on - for he knew that if the mir­ror re­fu­sed to res­pond, his gre­at sche­me for world-do­mi­ni­on was very li­kely un­do­ne - he spo­ke the spell:</p>
   <p>    "O mighty mir­ror of ice! Far­se­e­ing eye of the Va­nis­hed Ones! Awa­ken and res­pond to my re­qu­est!"</p>
   <p>    He wa­ited.</p>
   <p>    At first, the grey, glassy sur­fa­ce only ref­lec­ted his own ima­ge: a tall ro­bust man dra­ped in flu­id sil­ver and black, crow­ned with a star-burst di­adem and with a sil­ver mask hi­ding his up­per fa­ce. Then the­re was a dim glow wit­hin the mir­ror's he­art… and a vo­ice. It was fa­int, raspy li­ke that of a dying man, and its ac­cents we­re not hu­man.</p>
   <p>    "Responding. Re­qu­est, ple­ase."</p>
   <p>    Orogastus sto­od stark still. In spi­te of the fact that he was half-fre­ezing, pers­pi­ra­ti­on rol­led down his fo­re­he­ad be­hind the sil­ver mask and in­to his eyes. This was the most cri­ti­cal mo­ment. If he po­sed the re­qu­est in­cor­rectly, the aff­ron­ted mir­ror wo­uld wink out and re­ma­in dor­mant for at le­ast two days whi­le it "re­co­ve­red" from the in­sult. Men­tal­ly, he of­fe­red a fresh pra­yer to the Dark Po­wers. Then he sa­id in a ne­ut­ral to­ne: "Vi­ew three per­sons. Lo­ca­te pre­sent po­si­ti­on of the three per­sons on map."</p>
   <p>    The mir­ror brigh­te­ned. A ma­elst­rom of sil­very-blue sha­dow ma­te­ri­ali­zed in the cen­ter of its disk. It sa­id: "Re­qu­est va­li­da­ted. Na­mes of three per­sons."</p>
   <p>    "Princess Ani­gel of Ru­wen­da. Prin­cess Ka­di­ya of Ru­wen­da. Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis of Ru­wen­da." As he spo­ke, he was ca­re­ful to form a men­tal pic­tu­re of each girl.</p>
   <p>    "Scanning," sa­id the mir­ror. And Oro­gas­tus ne­arly fa­in­ted with re­li­ef. It was go­ing to work -</p>
   <p>    The mir­ror sa­id: "Su­bj­ect One: Prin­cess Ani­gel of Ru­wen­da. Lo­ca­ti­on: Sa fo­ur­te­en two, Lo se­venty-one ten on Grid Oma." It spo­ke the usu­al in­comp­re­hen­sib­le gib­be­rish; but this was im­me­di­ately fol­lo­wed by a be­a­uti­ful map-di­ag­ram sho­wing a blin­king light on the Mu­tar Ri­ver be­low the Ci­ta­del, just a few le­agu­es abo­ve La­ke Wum.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus rest­ra­ined him­self he­ro­ical­ly. A fal­se word or mo­ve­ment co­uld throw the mir­ror off ir­ret­ri­evably. The sor­ce­rer con­cent­ra­ted upon me­mo­ri­zing the in­di­ca­ted lo­ca­ti­on. A mo­ment la­ter the map win­ked out and the mir­ror sho­wed ins­te­ad a full-co­lor port­ra­it of the girl, all in mo­ti­on as tho­ugh she we­re ali­ve in­si­de the grey ice. Ani­gel was se­ated in the bow of a punt, hol­ding two straps that ap­pe­ared to be re­ins. The craft was be­ing to­wed thro­ugh wa­ter at a high ra­te of spe­ed. Be­hind the Prin­cess sat an Od­dling wo­man, who glan­ced back over her sho­ul­der at a red sun­set and then sa­id cle­arly: "We'd best put in for the night, swe­eting. The­re sho­uld be plenty of­fish for the ri­mo­riks in the la­go­on over the­re."</p>
   <p>    And then the pic­tu­re di­sap­pe­ared.</p>
   <p>    "Subject Two: Prin­cess Ka­di­ya of Ru­wen­da," sa­id the mir­ror softly. "Lo­ca­ti­on Mo twenty-ni­ne fo­ur, Vi ni­nety-fi­ve fi­ve on Grid Oma." The blin­king light pla­ced the fu­gi­ti­ve just west of the Skri­tek-infes­ted jung­le known as the Thorny Hell.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus stif­led an exc­la­ma­ti­on, then lo­oked on in fas­ci­na­ti­on as the mir­ror sho­wed the se­cond of the trip­let girls kne­eling on a mud bank in de­ep twi­light, at­temp­ting to kind­le a camp­fi­re of vi­ne-bark, and in the backg­ro­und a sing­le Od­dling was ta­king so­met­hing from a na­ti­ve bo­at.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya sa­id: "I've puf­fed till I'm blue, Jagun, but I can't get this per­ver­se stuff to light. You'd bet­ter try."</p>
   <p>    The pic­tu­re di­sap­pe­ared.</p>
   <p>    "Subject Three: Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis of Ru­wen­da. Lo­ca­ti­on: Pa forty-two three, No six­te­en eight on Grid Oma." The in­di­ca­tor light on the map blin­ked in a most ext­ra­or­di­nary po­si­ti­on - high on the slo­pe of Mo­unt Ro­to­lo, the se­cond-lof­ti­est pe­ak in the Oho­gans, ne­ar the he­ad­wa­ters of the Vis­par Ri­ver and only a le­ague or two away from the sec­ret set­tle­ment of the Vis­pi Od­dlings.</p>
   <p>    The sor­ce­rer held his bre­ath as the fi­nal pic­tu­re ap­pe­ared on the mir­ror. It was very obs­cu­re, a purp­lish dusky sce­ne that he fi­nal­ly re­cog­ni­zed as a snow-ca­ve in­te­ri­or over­lo­oking the slo­pe of a twi­lit gla­ci­er. A sha­dow de­tac­hed it­self from dark­ness and be­ca­me the sil­ho­u­et­te of a yo­ung wo­man wrap­ped in a whi­te clo­ak, ga­zing out­si­de.</p>
   <p>    Haramis sa­id: "Will I li­ve thro­ugh the night? They are out the­re, wa­iting for me -the Eyes in the Whirl­wind -and the tril­li­um se­eds that led me to this pla­ce of icy de­ath are all go­ne sa­ve one. It is the end. I ha­ve no mo­re fo­od and the snows are be­co­ming so de­ep I can no lon­ger pro­ce­ed. Un­less the Vis­pi them­sel­ves ta­ke pity on me and co­me to my res­cue, I shall ha­ve fa­iled in my qu­est for the Three-Win­ged Circ­le."</p>
   <p>    The pic­tu­re va­nis­hed.</p>
   <p>    Then ca­me the ine­vi­tab­le fa­te­ful words from the ma­gi­cal de­vi­ce: "Bah­kup Po­wer tem­po­ra­rily ex­ha­us­ted. Hi­atus for rec­har­ge." And the ice-mir­ror's light and vo­ice di­ed.</p>
   <p>    "Thanks be to all the Dark Po­wers-Ay see Lyne, In­tur­nal Ba­ta­ree, and Bah­kup," Oro­gas­tus in­to­ned, ma­king a de­ep obe­isan­ce, "and to the Gre­at System ope­ra­ted the­reby, fo­re­ver and ever, so let it be."</p>
   <p>    Then he withd­rew, wal­king humbly back­ward, clo­sed the ob­si­di­an do­or to the mir­ror-ro­om, and fled to his own apart­ments.</p>
   <p>    Much la­ter, af­ter he had eaten and so­aked in the tub, Oro­gas­tus con­sul­ted the an­ci­ent <emphasis>Bo­ok, of Pe­nin­su­lar Prop­he­ci­es</emphasis> whi­le se­ated in front of the che­er­ful fi­re in his study, sip­ping a mel­low brandy. Out­si­de, a snows­torm how­led among the to­wer bat­tle­ments.</p>
   <p>    The Three-Win­ged Circ­le…</p>
   <p>    Yes, it was men­ti­oned he­re, to­get­her with two ot­her obs­cu­re symbols-the Three-Lo­bed Bur­ning Eye and the Three-He­aded Mons­ter. The re­fe­ren­ce was unc­le­ar, but it se­emed that the three we­re des­ti­ned to co­me to­get­her, and the­reby pre­ci­pi­ta­te so­me cli­mac­tic event.</p>
   <p>    "Might it be," the sor­ce­rer mu­sed, "that the ot­her two Prin­ces­ses al­so se­ek the­ir ta­lis­mans, even as Ha­ra­mis se­eks hers? And ha­ving fo­und them and be­co­me re­uni­ted, might the girls <emphasis>then</emphasis> be so po­ten­ti­ali­zed as to overth­row La­bor­nok?"</p>
   <p>    He sta­red in­to the fla­mes for so­me ti­me be­fo­re de­ci­ding what to do. The ne­ed to dis­po­se of Ka­di­ya and Ani­gel was stra­ight­for­ward eno­ugh; but Crown Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis was qu­ite anot­her mat­ter…</p>
   <p>    He stra­igh­te­ned in his cha­ir, clo­sed his eyes, and pla­ced his fin­ger­tips on his temp­les. "My Vo­ices!" he in­to­ned. "He­ar me!"</p>
   <p>    In his mind three sha­pes to­ok form, blurs of red, blue, and gre­en that as­su­med the as­pect of his three ho­oded mi­ni­ons. They had no eyes but the­ir exp­res­si­ons we­re full of eager­ness.</p>
   <p>    "Master! Ha­ve you suc­ce­eded?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes. Be alert for the Sen­ding! He­re is the pre­sent po­si­ti­on of Prin­cess Ani­gel… and he­re is Ka­di­ya."</p>
   <p>    "We ha­ve re­ce­ived yo­ur Sen­ding, Al­mighty Mas­ter. And the Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis?"</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ve fo­und her al­so. But lis­ten! Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil is to set out with at le­ast half of the army in pur­su­it of Ka­di­ya, who has go­ne in­to a very dan­ge­ro­us re­gi­on. The Red Vo­ice is to me­et and ac­com­pany Ha­mil, and con­sult with me every ot­her day un­til she is ta­ken."</p>
   <p>    "I will obey," sa­id the Red Vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    "The se­arch for Prin­cess Ani­gel," Oro­gas­tus con­ti­nu­ed, "is to be con­duc­ted by Prin­ce An­tar and his knightly co­hort. The Blue Vo­ice will ac­com­pany him."</p>
   <p>    "The Prin­ce and his party re­tur­ned to the Ci­ta­del from Tre­vis­ta fo­ur days ago," the Blue Vo­ice sa­id. "It sho­uld be easy for us to find Ani­gel if she is as clo­se by as you say."</p>
   <p>    "Nothing is easy whe­re the Arc­hi­ma­ge Bi­nah is con­cer­ned," Oro­gas­tus ad­mo­nis­hed him sharply. "Ke­ep in mind that the girls are gu­ar­ded by the last of her ma­gic. And sho­uld they be suc­ces­sful in fin­ding cer­ta­in po­wer­ful new ta­lis­mans cal­led the Three-Lo­bed Bur­ning Eye and the Three-He­aded Mons­ter, the­ir ma­gic will cer­ta­inly be gre­atly en­han­ced. It is im­pe­ra­ti­ve that the Prin­ces­ses be cap­tu­red and kil­led, and the ta­lis­mans be sa­ved for me."</p>
   <p>    "We un­ders­tand," sa­id the Vo­ices.</p>
   <p>    "There are furt­her inst­ruc­ti­ons for the Blue Vo­ice," the sor­ce­rer ad­ded, "con­cer­ning Prin­ce An­tar."</p>
   <p>    "I be­li­eve I al­re­ady know yo­ur mind, Mas­ter." Blue ut­te­red a mirth­less chuck­le. "It wo­uld be sad if the Prin­ce we­re to pe­rish thro­ugh mi­sad­ven­tu­re af­ter ha­ving do­ne his duty."</p>
   <p>    "There must be no hint of yo­ur in­vol­ve­ment," Oro­gas­tus war­ned.</p>
   <p>    The Gre­en Vo­ice then sa­id: "And shall I jo­in the for­ce that will pur­sue the Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis, Mas­ter?"</p>
   <p>    "No. You will re­ma­in with King Volt­rik, ta­king ca­re that he re­co­vers fully, re­as­su­ring him when I trans­mit to you re­ports of prog­ress."</p>
   <p>    "But Ha­ra­mis - "</p>
   <p>    "I in­tend," Oro­gas­tus sa­id, "to ta­ke ca­re of the Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis myself."</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Twenty-One</strong></p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Haramis cast forth the fi­nal Black Tril­li­um se­ed on a mor­ning that saw the slo­pes of Mo­unt Ro­to­lo en-ve­lo­ped in pe­arly mist. When she wo­ke, it had se­emed stran­gely war­mer. The walls of the tiny ca­ve whe­re she had slept-surp­ri­singly so­undly-glis­te­ned with mel­ting snow. Her fur-li­ned mant­le, which she had wrap­ped aro­und her sle­ep-sack, had be­en comp­le­tely so­aked, ma­king it at le­ast twi­ce as he­avy as usu­al and qu­ite use­less, sin­ce she had no way of drying it. Using her small kni­fe, the Prin­cess had then cut the wa­ter-re­pel­lent sle­ep-sack along one si­de and ac­ross the bot­tom, fas­hi­oning a kind of ca­pe that was stiff but we­at­herp­ro­of. Af­ter a bre­ak­fast of cold wa­ter, she had fre­ed the last se­ed and stumb­led out of the ca­ve to fol­low it thro­ugh ank­le-de­ep wet snow.</p>
   <p>    It flo­ated lan­gu­idly, adj­us­ting its flight to her slow steps, drif­ting not an arm's length be­fo­re her. She co­uld see not­hing be­yond that dis­tan­ce, so thick was the mist, and she tram­ped along le­aning he­avily upon her iron-shod stick. She re­ali­zed dimly that she was be­co­ming inc­re­asingly giddy from the thin air, but this did not se­em im­por­tant to her. Everyt­hing was far off and hazy. She hardly ca­red whe­re she pla­ced her fe­et, so long as the flo­ating se­ed sta­yed wit­hin vi­ew.</p>
   <p>    Many ti­mes she stumb­led and fell, her whi­te wo­ol su­it and bo­ots and mit­tens be­co­ming mo­re and mo­re sod­den. Mo­is­tu­re crept in­to the ex­po­sed plant-down li­ning of her sack-ca­pe as well, and be­fo­re long it was ac­hingly he­avy. The next ti­me Ha­ra­mis fell, she left the thing be­hind. The air was now so warm that she did not ne­ed it.</p>
   <p>    The se­ed. The win­ged se­ed. It was all she saw, all her fog­ged mind co­uld con­cent­ra­te upon. She went on and on, clim­bing ever hig­her. So­me­ti­mes the snow was knee-de­ep and so­me­ti­mes mo­re shal­low; but it was al­ways he­avy and wet, clin­ging to her bo­ots so that her legs se­emed ma­de of le­ad.</p>
   <p>    It must ha­ve be­en three or fo­ur ho­urs be­fo­re the we­at­her suf­fe­red an omi­no­us chan­ge. Ha­ra­mis was too da­zed to ta­ke no­te of the fact that the mist had lost its pe­arly co­lor and tur­ned to an inc­re­asingly glo­omy grey, nor did she no­ti­ce as the air grew ste­adily chil­li­er. Her hands and fe­et had lost all fe­eling, but this was as unim­por­tant to her as the dull pa­in in her empty sto­mach.</p>
   <p>    And then it be­gan to snow.</p>
   <p>    She hal­ted, unab­le at first to re­ali­ze what was hap­pe­ning. Se­eds? Was the world ali­ve with flo­ating fluffy tril­li­um se­eds? And which was her own ma­gi­cal gu­ide? That one -? No…</p>
   <p>    The mist was thin­ning as the snow inc­re­ased and Ha­ra­mis co­uld see on­ce aga­in the re­aring cliffs and crags of the mo­un­ta­in she clim­bed. The wind ro­se, blo­wing snowf­la­kes in­to her fa­ce. She be­ca­me awa­re of ha­ving lost her stick. The gu­iding se­ed? It was go­ne.</p>
   <p>    Gone as all the ot­hers -but not at day's end, ha­ving first led her to a sa­fe shel­ter, but he­re, ne­ar the crest of a kni­fe-sharp rocky rid­ge that the wind had blas­ted cle­ar of snow­pack. The last Black Tril­li­um se­ed, blown away; and so she ca­me to the qu­est's end…</p>
   <p>    Flying snow stung her fa­ce, bro­ught te­ars to her un­fo­cu­sed eyes and ca­used her che­eks and no­se to ting­le, then grow numb. A mor­tal let­hargy crept over her and it se­emed that the most de­si­rab­le thing in the world wo­uld be to sle­ep. Why strug­gle furt­her? Each bre­ath was a sword­cut. Her he­art thud­ded as tho­ugh it wo­uld bre­ak her ribs. Her hands and fe­et we­re fro­zen.</p>
   <p>    I <emphasis>will go to the top of the rid­ge</emphasis>, she told her­self. <emphasis>Just twenty mo­re steps. And the­re I will lo­ok out on my king­dom for the last ti­me</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    The wind tri­ed to fo­il her. Li­ke so­me hu­ge, re­sent­ful cre­atu­re, it how­led and pus­hed and se­emed al­most a wall for­bid­ding furt­her prog­ress. She cro­uc­hed, lif­ted one fo­ot and then the ot­her, thrust her body for­ward, le­aned in­to the wind with all her fa­ding strength.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Father! Mot­her! So­on I co­me to you, ha­ving fa­iled. I wan­ted so much for the dre­am to be re­al, for the mad qu­est to ha­ve a ma­gi­cal ful­fil­lment, to be­li­eve that the po­or old Arc­hi­ma­ge knew my des­tiny. But it se­ems that he did­not know, and so the­re was no ma­gic af­ter all. I sus­pec­ted as much.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Wind.</p>
   <p>    Snow.</p>
   <p>    Cold.</p>
   <p>    And her body still mo­ving, al­most be­yond pa­in now. With her te­eth, she pul­led off one fro­zen mit­ten and let it drop; then thrust the icy ba­re hand in­si­de her snow-crus­ted over­tu­nic to to­uch the tril­li­um amu­let one fi­nal ti­me, beg­ging for a last mo­di­cum of physi­cal strength.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Let me only ma­ke it to the top of the rid­ge</emphasis>. Fi­ve mo­re steps, the most ar­du­o­us, most ter­rib­le ac­ti­ons she had ever ac­comp­lis­hed… <emphasis>God, help the one who trus­ted Thee</emphasis>… one mo­re step…</p>
   <p>    Done!</p>
   <p>    At the rid­ge-crest was a rocky pa­ra­pet only lightly co­ve­red with snow. As she stra­igh­te­ned up, the wind's blast se­emed to aba­te, the bliz­zard no lon­ger las­hing her. Back the way she had co­me, the air was still ro­iled with tem­pes­tu­o­us grey; but ahe­ad the­re was blue sky and a daz­zling pa­no­ra­ma of snow-clad pe­aks ex­ten­ding far in­to the west. The ste­ep front of the rid­ge fell away at her fe­et in­to an abyss that se­emed to plun­ge to in­fi­nity be­fo­re its depths we­re lost in ha­ze.</p>
   <p>    "Here I am," she whis­pe­red, and diz­zi­ness over­ca­me her, and she swa­yed and ne­arly lost cons­ci­o­us­ness. But her hand grip­ping the amu­let was no lon­ger wit­ho­ut sen­sa­ti­on, but felt a gro­wing, pa­in­ful warmth; and rat­her than suc­cumb to wel­co­me de­ath, she for­ced her eyes to open one fi­nal ti­me.</p>
   <p>    On the rid­ge, not a sto­ne's-throw to her right, a gre­at snowy whirl­wind spun, all spark­ling in the sun li­ke di­amond-dust.</p>
   <p>    Haramis drop­ped to her kne­es and sta­red at it, comp­le­tely help­less. It swa­yed and swir­led and grew in­to a gi­gan­tic flu­id whi­te co­ne that spun on its po­int. And wit­hin the whirl­wind the­re we­re Eyes.</p>
   <p>    Eyes gre­en as ice. Sco­res of them. Lo­oking at her.</p>
   <p>    "I se­ek the Three-Win­ged Circ­le," she whis­pe­red.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>We are to gu­ard it for you, co­me to me­et you.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "I gre­et you," sa­id Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis, with dig­nity. Then she fell for­ward in­to a pro­fo­und and wel­co­me black­ness.</p>
   <p>    There fol­lo­wed a ti­me fil­led with busy dre­aming, du­ring which she suf­fe­red gre­at pa­in and then fo­und a de­ep and so­ot­hing re­le­ase. The Eyes in the Whirl­wind in­ha­bi­ted her dre­ams, only so­me­ti­mes they we­re fe­ar­so­me and so­me­ti­mes gent­le, be­lon­ging to tall and gra­ce­ful be­ings clad in pa­le-tin­ted flo­wing gar­ments and ador­ned with ext­ra­or­di­nary qu­an­ti­ti­es of jewels, who whis­pe­red to her and mi­nis­te­red to her and ad­mo­nis­hed her to do this thing or that, whi­le she obe­yed li­ke a tiny child.</p>
   <p>    She as­ked them who they we­re, and they told her that they we­re the First Folk, who had be­en ke­epers of the gre­at Scept­re of Po­wer of the Va­nis­hed Ones from ti­me out of mind.</p>
   <p>    She as­ked them if this Scept­re was the ta­lis­man she so­ught, and they sa­id: <emphasis>In a man­ner yes, and in anot­her man­ner, no. For in dark ages past the Thre­efold was sun­de­red and its mem­bers scat­te­red so as to pre­vent it fal­ling in­to the hands of evil</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    Dreaming still, the Prin­cess as­ked the Eyes if they we­re in truth the ke­epers of the Three-Win­ged Circ­le, her own ta­lis­man.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Yes, for this por­ti­on of the Thre­efold we kept sa­fe in an ice-ca­ve. The ot­her two parts we­re sent far away by the Whi­te Lady, to be ca­red for by ot­hers un­til the ti­me when her po­wers sho­uld fa­de, and the Scept­re wo­uld be ne­eded to res­to­re the gre­at ba­lan­ce of the world.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Harmis sa­id: "My sis­ters se­ek two ot­her ta­lis­mans."</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>And so do­es the evil one of yo­ur age, who even now lo­oks upon you, ho­ping you will suc­ce­ed in yo­ur qu­est…</emphasis></p>
   <p>    It se­emed to Ha­ra­mis that one pa­ir of watc­hing Eyes chan­ged from ice-gre­en in­to star-whi­te, bla­zing; and she saw the be­a­uti­ful fa­ce of a man smi­ling at her, and she as­ked: "Is this he?"</p>
   <p>    And they sa­id, <emphasis>Yes</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    In the dre­am this man re­ac­hed out to her, and she re­tur­ned his smi­le; and he sa­id: "I am not what they say I am. Be not de­ce­ived. The­se lit­tle ones un­ders­tand only a part of the gre­at who­le. Re­ser­ve judg­ment un­til you can know me truly and ma­ke up yo­ur own mind."</p>
   <p>    Haramis wo­ke in a nar­row bed with ga­uzy han­gings all abo­ut, and she mar­ve­led that she was so warm, un­til she re­ali­zed that he­at ema­na­ted from the mat­tress be­ne­ath her.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>The hypo­ca­ust warms the ba­se of the bed and the flo­ors</emphasis>, sa­id a soft vo­ice. <emphasis>Thro­ugh its flu­es ste­am co­mes from the hot springs , and in this man­ner so we he­at our ho­mes</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    The bed-dra­pes par­ted, and Ha­ra­mis saw an abo­ri­gi­nal wo­man of a ra­ce he­re­to­fo­re unk­nown to her. Her fa­ce was nar­ro­wer than that of the fa­mi­li­ar Nysso­mu, and her mo­uth and no­se mo­re hu­man. Her hu­ge eyes - gre­en rat­her than gol­den - and the ears that emer­ged from a wavy mass of pla­ti­num ha­ir, mar­ked her as of the Folk. She had hands with three di­gits al­so; but the ta­lons we­re ves­ti­gi­al, and very much re­semb­led fin­ger­na­ils - sa­ve for the­ir thick­ness, and an ap­pa­rently na­tu­ral ten­dency to co­me to a po­int.</p>
   <p>    When she smi­led at Ha­ra­mis, her te­eth we­re not fang­li­ke, but we­re small and even. The Prin­cess re­cal­led the me­lo­di­o­us timb­re of the Vis­pi wo­man's vo­ice from her dre­aming; it was so­me mi­nu­tes be­fo­re she re­ali­zed that the wo­man's lips did not mo­ve when she spo­ke.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>But of co­ur­se not</emphasis>, ca­me the che­er­ful ack­now­ledg­ment. <emphasis>You wo­uld not un­ders­tand our lan­gu­age, so we use the spe­ech wit­ho­ut words! My na­me is Ma­gi­ra, and I gre­et you, Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis of the Tril­li­um. Now co­me out of bed and let me help you to dress, for you are qu­ite re­co­ve­red and our pe­op­le wo­uld me­et with you be­fo­re you con­ti­nue on yo­ur qu­est</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    "But you can un­ders­tand me…" The Prin­cess still had not fully re­co­ve­red her wits, and she was not yet cer­ta­in what was dre­am and what re­ality. Ma­gi­ra's talk of "con­ti­nu­ing on her qu­est" was mo­re than a lit­tle da­un­ting.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>As you spe­ak, so yo­ur mind re­pe­ats yo­ur tho­ughts, Prin­cess. We Vis­pi ha­ve no tro­ub­le un­ders­tan­ding you… Do­es this gown me­et with yo­ur ap­pro­val? I think you will find it very com­for­tab­le, and the black fur ed­ging matc­hes yo­ur ha­ir.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Yes, thank you. The dress is lo­vely."</p>
   <p>    Haramis let Ma­gi­ra at­ti­re her in a flo­wing ro­be of pa­le blue fab­ric, li­ke vel­vet only not so he­avy, trim­med with soft black fur. At the neck and sle­eve-edges and hem we­re wi­de emb­ro­ide­red sil­ver bands all in­set with sap­phi­res and mo­ons­to­nes. She put on bo­ots of sil­very le­at­her, and a sil­ver belt with a han­ging pur­se all be­aded with se­ed-gems, and let the Vis­pi wo­man bra­id her ha­ir in­to two thick pla­its and tie them with blue rib­bon.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Our Vis­pi blo­od flows warm and so we re­qu­ire gar­ments much ligh­ter than hu­man­kind must we­ar he­re. Ta­ke this clo­ak al­so, and glo­ves, and I will le­ad you to the Town Hall of Mo­vis , which is not far from this ho­use.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Obediently, Ha­ra­mis slip­ped on the be­j­ewe­led glo­ves whi­le Ma­gi­ra dra­ped a splen­did clo­ak of ming­led black and whi­te furs abo­ut her sho­ul­ders and drew up its ho­od. The Prin­cess then fol­lo­wed the Vis­pi wo­man out of the bedc­ham­ber, and down a flight of sto­ne sta­irs with nar­row, gla­zed win­dows, and in­to a ves­ti­bu­le; and then­ce out­do­ors.</p>
   <p>    "So this is Mo­vis!"</p>
   <p>    Haramis stop­ped in the por­ti­co and ga­zed abo­ut at the city which she had tho­ught only a le­gend. The air had a gol­den lu­mi­nes­cen­ce and it was ob­vi­o­usly ne­ar sun­set. The Prin­cess had a vi­ew of se­ve­ral hund­red fi­nely ma­de sto­ne ho­uses, many of imp­res­si­ve si­ze, and a num­ber of ot­her bu­il­dings, con­si­de­rably lar­ger, clus­te­red abo­ut a cent­ral pla­za.</p>
   <p>    Plumes of va­por ro­se up on every si­de - not only from the sla­te ro­ofs of the dwel­lings, but al­so from gra­tes in the cob­bles­to­ne stre­ets and from boxy small struc­tu­res stan­ding in every do­or­yard and fo­re­co­urt. Lit­tle tre­es and ne­at gar­dens sur­ro­un­ded each ho­me, but no pe­op­le or ot­her li­ving cre­atu­res we­re vi­sib­le. The sce­ne was oddly lit, sha­dow­less, for no true suns­hi­ne re­ac­hed the val­ley flo­or. A la­yer of bright clo­ud, li­ke a gol­den ce­iling sup­por­ted by the hund­reds of pil­lars of whi­te ste­am, over­lay all of the Va­le of Mo­vis. The lo­wer slo­pes we­re gre­en and ter­ra­ced; the hig­her we­re snow-co­ve­red. From a gre­at gla­ci­er po­ured a wa­ter­fall li­ke a long whi­te scarf.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>The pe­op­le ha­ve pre­pa­red a fes­ti­ve eve­ning me­al for you, and they are awa­iting yo­ur ar­ri­val</emphasis>, Ma­gi­ra sa­id.</p>
   <p>    "That so­unds lo­vely," Ha­ra­mis sa­id, mo­ving qu­ickly to ke­ep up with the long-leg­ged Vis­pi wo­man, who now gli­ded swiftly down the twis­ting stre­ets, her ga­uzy gar­ments af­lo­at abo­ut her li­ke pa­le ban­ners stre­aming in a wind. "I se­em to be very hungry; per­haps it's the air he­re."</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>You slept for fi­ve days, Prin­cess.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Oh!" sa­id Ha­ra­mis.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>During that ti­me our ca­re­gi­vers at­ten­ded you and he­aled yo­ur fro­zen flesh, and yo­ur ot­her inj­uri­es. Do­ubt­less you we­re awa­re of the­ir mi­nist­ra­ti­ons in yo­ur dre­ams.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Yes. And I dre­amt of anot­her, too."</p>
   <p>    Magira slo­wed, tur­ned her eme­rald ga­ze upon the Prin­cess, and her tho­ught-to­ne was une­asy. <emphasis>We know that the evil one bes­po­ke you. He can scry yo­ur pre­sen­ce only thro­ugh his ice-mir­ror, and that not cons­tantly, but only at in­ter­vals of two days or mo­re, sin­ce you are shi­el­ded by yo­ur amu­let from the na­tu­ral mind-obser­va­ti­an of ill-wis­hers -</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "But he co­uld still bes­pe­ak me in dre­ams?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Knowing you we­re he­re, he co­uld. If you had be­en awa­ke, you ne­ed not ha­ve lis­te­ned, of co­ur­se.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Haramis for­bo­re to talk of Oro­gas­tus furt­her, yi­el­ding to a most cu­ri­o­us fe­eling that the sor­ce­rer evo­ked wit­hin her mind. Ins­te­ad, she sa­id to Ma­gi­ra: "Tell me, are yo­ur pe­op­le self-suf­fi­ci­ent in this val­ley?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>We grow such fo­od crops as can pros­per in. the low light, and we ke­ep do­mes­tic ani­mals as well</emphasis>-<emphasis>to­gars and nunc­hiks wit­hin the town, and the lar­ger vo­lum­ni­als and a few fro­ni­als out­si­de, pas­tu­ring them in the dry se­ason, shel­te­ring them in ca­ves du­ring the ra­ins and snows. In the ca­verns, nut­ri­ti­o­us lu­mi­no­us lic­hens and fun­gi grow, and you wo­uld find the night­ti­me ap­pe­aran­ce of our li­ves­tock droll, for the­ir win­ter di­et ma­kes the­ir te­eth and ant­lers and ho­oves glow in the dark</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    "These are the ani­mals that you ob­ta­in in tra­de?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Yes, for they bre­ed slowly in the mo­un­ta­ins.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Haramis lif­ted one glo­ve, and the gems sewn upon it gle­amed. "You tra­de jewels and pre­ci­o­us me­tals only?"</p>
   <p>    Magira la­ug­hed. <emphasis>They are qu­ite eno­ugh, Prin­cess, for all ra­ces of the Folk cra­ve such or­na­ments. In ear­li­er ye­ars, our tra­ding net­work spre­ad from the Oho­gans to the Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest , with the re­ti­ring lit­tle Uis­gu ever ac­ting as our mid­dle­men with ot­her ra­ces of Folk. Sin­ce the ad­vent of Ru­wen­di­an hu­man­kind, the tra­de-pat­tern has al­te­red, with hu­mans now sup­plying mo­re ani­mals and swe­ets than the Folk alo­ne ever co­uld. And so the Vis­pi ha­ve pros­pe­red</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    "But still you for­bid ot­hers to en­ter yo­ur land."</p>
   <p>    Magira ga­ve a de­li­ca­te shrug. <emphasis>The hot-spring val­leys are few and far bet­we­en, and the li­ving pre­ca­ri­o­usly ba­lan­ced. We First Folk we­re ma­de for this cli­ma­te when it co­ve­red most of the world. As it shrank with the pas­sing ages, we di­mi­nis­hed in num­bers, alt­ho­ugh we did suc­ce­ed in re­ta­ining our cul­tu­re. In ti­me, ot­her ra­ces of Folk, di­ver­ging from us, jo­ined the abo­mi­nab­le Fo­un­da­ti­on Stock in what is now cal­led the Mazy Mi­re. But the high mo­un­ta­ins are ours, and we pro­tect them with fe­ar­so­me il­lu­si­ons such as the Eyes in the Whirl­wind. And sin­ce we are Pe­op­le of the Tril­li­um, and obe­di­ent to the com­mand of the Whi­te Lady, we gu­ard al­so the Vis­pir Pass bet­we­en Ru­wen­da and La­bor­nok</emphasis> -</p>
   <p>    Haramis hal­ted and conf­ron­ted her com­pa­ni­on, spe­aking rep­ro­ach­ful­ly. "Then whe­re we­re you when King Volt­rik's army in­va­ded us?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Alas… the Lady did not alert us in ti­me to yo­ur enemy's ap­pro­ach, and when the Vis­pi pass-gu­ar­di­ans ca­me, the­ir il­lu­si­ons we­re pe­net­ra­ted by the po­wer of the sor­ce­rer. He ba­de the La­bor­no­ki sol­di­ers ig­no­re the phan­tasms and stri­ke at the flesh-and-blo­od per­sons pro­j­ec­ting them. The in­va­ders slew all the Vis­pi gu­ar­di­ans of our vil­la­ges ne­arest the pass</emphasis> -<emphasis>so­me three hund­red so­uls</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    "I am sorry," the Prin­cess sa­id sin­ce­rely. "I did not know. Very lit­tle news of the in­va­si­on ca­me to us at the Ci­ta­del, for the in­va­ders marc­hed with fa­tal swift­ness, overw­hel­ming our pe­op­le be­fo­re they knew what was hap­pe­ning. Even now I know not what be­fell our pe­op­le of the Dylex co­untry, or the outl­ying ma­nors of the so­uth…"</p>
   <p>    They had fi­nal­ly re­ac­hed a very lar­ge bu­il­ding with win­dows alight in the dusk and the so­und of mu­sic co­ming fa­intly thro­ugh the walls. When Ma­gi­ra threw open the do­ors, Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis was as­to­un­ded at the gre­at crowd of Folk gat­he­red the­re­in: many hund­reds, so­me se­ated at ro­und tab­les, ot­hers dan­cing to a sta­tely tu­ne in a cent­ral open spa­ce.</p>
   <p>    At the far end of the Town Hall was a bro­ad da­is at which richly at­ti­red Vis­pi sat. Abo­ve them on the wall was a ban­ner car­rying a gre­at Black Tril­li­um out­li­ned in glit­te­ring di­amonds. The fe­ma­le ci­ti­zens of Mo­vis we­re dres­sed much as Ma­gi­ra, in pas­tel flo­wing gowns and a pro­fu­si­on of jewels. The ma­les mostly wo­re ro­bes of de­epest mid­night blue, with un­der­tu­nics and high bo­ots of whi­te. The­ir gem-stud­ded belts, col­lars, and bra­ce­lets flas­hed li­ke ra­in­bow fi­re in the light of tho­usands of small cres­set-lamps sus­pen­ded from the high ce­iling.</p>
   <p>    A gre­at cla­mor went up as Ma­gi­ra es­cor­ted her gu­est to the dig­ni­ta­ri­es at the da­is. Ha­ra­mis felt her vi­si­on dim and her mind re­el, and might ha­ve stag­ge­red had Ma­gi­ra not ta­ken hold of her. The men­tal and vo­cal sho­uting! She had ne­ver known anyt­hing li­ke this. She felt as­sa­iled both in­si­de and out­si­de her body, and even tho­ugh she knew the ag­gres­sors we­re fri­endly, she felt overw­hel­med.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Stop</emphasis>! Her mind ga­ve an in­vo­lun­tary cry.</p>
   <p>    Consternation.</p>
   <p>    Silence, tan­gibly pe­ni­tent.</p>
   <p>    Trembling with re­li­ef, she sa­id: "Thank you. I ap­pre­ci­ate yo­ur wel­co­me, but I fe­ar I ha­ve not yet be­co­me ac­cus­to­med to yo­ur man­ner of exp­res­sing it."</p>
   <p>    A ma­le of most ve­ne­rab­le ap­pe­aran­ce, who­se eyes we­re not gre­en but dull whi­te, ro­se from his pla­ce at the he­ad of the tab­le and ad­dres­sed Ha­ra­mis. She knew he was blind; she knew al­so that he saw her.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Dear Prin­cess, for­gi­ve us! We wo­uld not ha­ve aff­righ­ted you de­li­be­ra­tely. Our joy at yo­ur ap­pe­aran­ce car­ri­ed us away. I gre­et you in the na­me of all Vis­pi. I am Ca­rim­po­le, Har­ke­ner of Mov'u. We ha­ve long awa­ited you. It was known to us that the flying se­eds wo­uld draw you to our town… if you we­re strong eno­ugh to fol­low them. All thro­ug­ho­ut yo­ur jo­ur­ney, from the ti­me you left Noth, we watc­hed you. We saw you suf­fer hards­hip and fa­ti­gue and dis­co­ura­ge­ment. We saw you co­me in­to the snowy high co­untry whe­re all of yo­ur gre­at in­tel­li­gen­ce was use­less and only wil­lpo­wer and physi­cal en­du­ran­ce wo­uld sus­ta­in you.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>And then it se­emed that you we­re we­ake­ning and wo­uld fa­il, as tho­se who spend much ti­me in thin­king of­ten do, scor­ning the body that se­ems unab­le to sus­ta­in the bur­ning spi­rit it ho­uses. We pra­yed for you in yo­ur ext­re­mity, at did the Whi­te Lady, and from us you drew fresh strength, per­haps, and for­ced the body to ser­ve the mind, ful­fil­ling yo­ur or­de­al. You re­ac­hed our in­ner­most bor­der</emphasis>-<emphasis>at which ti­me we we­re per­mit­ted to ta­ke you in</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    Haramis he­ard a gre­at mur­mu­ring of minds all abo­ut her, to­uc­hing gently, wis­hing well. Her vo­ice was ba­rely audib­le: "You-you we­re for­bid­den to help me ear­li­er?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Yes. For you, the jo­ur­ne­ying it­self was cru­ci­al. It was an es­sen­ti­al part of yo­ur qu­est.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "And now -ha­ve I re­ac­hed the end of it? You ha­ve the Three-Win­ged Circ­le and will gi­ve it to me?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>On the mor­row we will be­gin to te­ach you how to com­mand the gre­at birds you hu­mans call lam­mer­ge­i­ers. Yo­ur ta­lis­man li­es so­me le­agu­es from he­re, in an ice-ca­ve high on Mo­unt Gid­ris . A lam­mer­ge­i­er will ta­ke you to the ca­ve. As to yo­ur qu­est's comp­le­ti­on, I can­not say. Me­rely ha­ving the Three- Win­ged Circ­le, in hand is not­hing. It must be em­po­we­red. We do not know how this is to be ac­com­p­lis­hed.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "I was told by the Arc­hi­ma­ge to re­turn to her with the ta­lis­man af­ter I ha­ve mas­te­red myself. But she al­so told me that my des­tiny is lin­ked with that of my two sis­ters, and that all three of us must suc­ce­ed, or no­ne will. Am I then to as­sist Ka­di­ya and Ani­gel?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Haramis of the Tril­li­um, we can­not toy. I think you will ha­ve to de­ci­de this for yo­ur­self.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "I am the el­dest sis­ter, and I ha­ve al­ways ta­ken res­pon­si­bi­lity for the ot­hers. The­re is al­so a cer­ta­in prop­hecy among the swamp Folk that says that a wo­man of Ru­wen­da will bring down the thro­ne of La­bor­nok. It se­ems that this wo­man must be me, for the Crown of Ru­wen­da is right­ful­ly mi­ne, and mi­ne is the ob­li­ga­ti­on to li­be­ra­te our van­qu­is­hed land."</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>The gre­at bird will carry you whe­re­ver you de­si­re. But we can­not ad­vi­se you furt­her. Now that you are re­co­ve­red from yo­ur hurts, we can only ce­leb­ra­te yo­ur co­ming and spe­ed yo­ur go­ing. But for now, will you sit he­re at tab­le with us? For fi­ve days you ha­ve ta­ken not­hing but li­qu­ids, and we ha­ve tri­ed to pre­pa­re dis­hes that will ple­ase yo­ur hu­man pa­la­te.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "I thank you," Ha­ra­mis sa­id, "and I will gladly jo­in you."</p>
   <p>    The Har­ke­ner clap­ped his hands. <emphasis>Then let the fes­ti­ve me­ats and past­ri­es be bro­ught forth, and ho­ne­yed fru­it and mul­led wi­ne! And let the­re be mo­re mu­sic and mo­re dan­cing and mer­ri­ment, for our Prin­cess ne­ars her go­al and the world is bro­ught that much clo­ser to re­ga­ining its lost ba­lan­ce… Pra­ise be to the Whi­te Lady, and to the Lord, of the Air, and to the Tri­une over all!</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Cheers fil­led the Town Hall, and si­de do­ors flew open to ad­mit a tra­in of co­oks and hel­pers be­aring he­avy plat­ters and ste­aming bowls. The mu­si­ci­ans be­gan to play aga­in, whi­le the pe­op­le all hur­ri­ed to se­ats at the ot­her tab­les.</p>
   <p>    Princess Ha­ra­mis pul­led off her glo­ves and un­fas­te­ned her ca­pe, and sank gra­te­ful­ly in­to the pla­ce in­di­ca­ted by the Har­ke­ner Ca­rim­po­le. Ma­gi­ra sat be­si­de her. Mo­men­ta­rily Ha­ra­mis felt light­he­aded aga­in, and clo­sed her eyes; and it se­emed that she co­uld see right thro­ugh the walls of the hall. The clo­uds had lo­we­red with on­co­ming night, and snowf­la­kes we­re sif­ting down from them. But the­se mel­ted when they re­ac­hed the warm air just abo­ve the ro­of­tops, and tur­ned to ra­in that fell upon the vil­la­ge of the Vis­pi, softly at first, then with inc­re­asing vi­gor, rap­ping aga­inst the win­dow­pa­nes as if de­man­ding ent­ran­ce. Ming­led with the­ir pat­te­ring was the fa­int vo­ice of a man cal­ling her na­me.</p>
   <p>    Haramis ope­ned her eyes aga­in to the bright­ness and jol­lity all aro­und her. She he­ard not­hing but the con­vi­vi­al Vis­pi and the­ir mu­sic - rin­ging oddly, half in her ears and half in her mind.</p>
   <p>    Someone han­ded her a crystal gob­let of spark­ling wi­ne. She drank de­eply of it, and tri­ed to smi­le.</p>

   <p>    Shut out, the sor­ce­rer was amu­sed rat­her than an­ge­red. "Enj­oy yo­ur­self then with yo­ur Vis­pi fri­ends, Ha­ra­mis! But I will call you aga­in and aga­in, and the ti­me will co­me when you must ans­wer."</p>
   <p>    Secure in his la­ir on Mo­unt Brom, with the early snows­torm still ra­ging, Oro­gas­tus be­gan to se­arch thro­ugh his lib­rary, se­eking furt­her clu­es to the na­tu­re of the three myste­ri­o­us ta­lis­mans.</p>
   <p>    The <emphasis>Bo­ok of Pe­nin­su­lar Prop­he­ci­es</emphasis> was his prin­ci­pal so­ur­ce, as al­ways. In one entry it na­med the ta­lis­mans and hin­ted that they wo­uld re­uni­te and pre­ci­pi­ta­te so­me wond­ro­us event. In anot­her prop­hecy, one he knew of old (and had ma­de cer­ta­in that King Volt­rik knew it al­so), the Three Pe­tals of the Li­ving Tril­li­um we­re de­sig­na­ted qu­ite baldly as the "extin­gu­is­hers" of the La­bor­no­ki thro­ne; but not­hing in the bo­ok hin­ted at a link bet­we­en the Prin­ces­ses and the ta­lis­mans. Set­ting that an­ci­ent vo­lu­me asi­de, he un­der­to­ok a se­arch thro­ugh his lar­ge col­lec­ti­on of tha­uma­tur­gi­cal and mysti­cal re­fe­ren­ces.</p>
   <p>    There was not­hing to be fo­und in the many bo­oks from La­bor­nok, and he had no bet­ter luck ro­oting among the smal­ler num­ber of vo­lu­mes from Var and Rak­tum. The most an­ci­ent so­ur­ce of all, the in­cu­na­bu­lar <emphasis>Cyclo­pe­dia of Dark Po­wers</emphasis> he had bro­ught from his own dis­tant ho­me­land of Tu­za­men, ma­de tan­ta­li­zing bri­ef men­ti­on of the su­bj­ect. Un­der the he­ading "Thre­efold Ta­lis­man" he fo­und but a sing­le sen­ten­ce: "A de­vi­ce of gre­at po­tency, sup­po­sed to ha­ve be­en ent­rus­ted to the Vis­pi by the Va­nis­hed Ones from ti­me out of mind."</p>
   <p>    Yes! But what was it in­ten­ded to <emphasis>do</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    He con­ti­nu­ed his se­arch, lo­oking to non­ma­gi­cal bo­oks. And fi­nal­ly, in a slen­der, lin­git-nib­bled tre­ati­se of abo­ri­gi­nal stu­di­es from the is­land prin­ci­pa­lity of En­gi (of all pla­ces) he hap­pe­ned upon a re­fe­ren­ce to "the gre­at Thre­efold Scept­re of Po­wer which the Vis­pi ra­ce, most an­ci­ent of the­ir kind, sa­fe­gu­ar­ded un­til it sho­uld be re­qu­ired in the ful­lness of ti­me." The re­ap­pe­aran­ce of this cryptic obj­ect was or­da­ined by the Va­nis­hed Ones, the bo­ok aver­red; exactly what it was in­ten­ded to ac­comp­lish, no hu­man knew, but it wo­uld sha­ke the fo­un­da­ti­ons of the world.</p>
   <p>    "So we ha­ve three ta­lis­mans and three girls se­eking them," the sor­ce­rer sa­id to him­self, clo­sing the last bo­ok and ri­sing from the lib­rary tab­le.</p>
   <p>    Hands clas­ped be­hind this back, he mo­ved to the win­dow and sta­red out at the bliz­zard. It was not comp­le­tely un­se­aso­nab­le, the mon­so­ons be­ing due in ten days, and so it co­uld not cle­arly be at­tri­bu­ted to ma­gic - spe­ci­fi­cal­ly to the misc­hi­ef-mon­ge­ring Vis­pi who we­re such gre­at fri­ends of the Arc­hi­ma­ge Bi­nah, and who we­re, ac­cor­ding to ta­le-tel­lers, ab­le to exert a cer­ta­in cont­rol over the we­at­her. Ne­vert­he­less, this snows­torm un­der­li­ned the ur­gency of his re­se­arc­hes, the ne­ces­sity of van­qu­is­hing the Prin­ces­ses be­fo­re he was trap­ped up he­re in the mo­un­ta­ins by the gre­at win­ter tem­pests.</p>
   <p>    "Three ta­lis­mans, for­merly to­get­her in the form of a Scept­re and ent­rus­ted to the Vis­pi, but evi­dently now se­pa­ra­ted and scat­te­red abo­ut Ru­wen­da. And the so-cal­led Three Pe­tals of the Li­ving Tril­li­um, the Prin­ces­ses, who in brin­ging the ta­lis­mans back to­get­her may em­po­wer so­me gre­at Three-in-One…"</p>
   <p>    A mad­de­ning sen­se of in­de­ci­si­on gna­wed at the sor­ce­rer's mind. It was ob­vi­o­us that mo­re than the me­re sur­vi­val of La­bor­nok and its King was at sta­ke he­re: his own gre­at am­bi­ti­on, for­so­oth! Wo­uld it not be bet­ter to per­mit the Prin­ces­ses to li­ve un­til they ful­fil­led the­ir qu­ests, thus in­su­ring that all three ta­lis­mans pas­sed in­to his own hands? Or was his first ins­tinct the cor­rect one-that the girls sho­uld be pre­ven­ted at any cost from suc­ce­eding, sin­ce they alo­ne co­uld po­ten­ti­ate the ma­gi­cal Three-in-One?</p>
   <p>    More in­for­ma­ti­on! He ne­eded mo­re in­for­ma­ti­on be­fo­re the fi­nal de­ci­si­on co­uld be ma­de.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus whir­led abo­ut and stro­de to the fi­rep­la­ce, whe­re the fi­re pa­in­ted his whi­te ha­ir with lu­rid glints. He stif­fe­ned, arms thrown wi­de, clo­sed his eyes mo­men­ta­rily and spo­ke the spell. When his lids re­ope­ned, bla­zing stars sprang up be­hind his pu­pils and ca­used the fla­mes to pa­le.</p>
   <p>    Then Oro­gas­tus bes­po­ke his Gre­en Vo­ice at Ru­wen­da Ci­ta­del, com­man­ding him to be­gin a se­arch of the gre­at lib­rary the­re, gle­aning wha­te­ver know­led­ge of the ta­lis­mans, the Li­ving Tril­li­um, or the Thre­efold Scept­re of the Vis­pi might be fo­und. The Vo­ice was to en­list the most in­tel­li­gent as­sis­tants he co­uld find among the La­bor­no­ki host.</p>
   <p>    "But ta­ke no Ru­wen­di­ans in­to yo­ur con­fi­den­ce in this mat­ter," the sor­ce­rer war­ned, "and swe­ar yo­ur fel­low-se­arc­hers to sec­recy by strong oaths, on pa­in of the ro­yal disp­le­asu­re."</p>
   <p>    "I shall obey, Al­mighty Mas­ter."</p>
   <p>    "Now tell me how fa­res King Volt­rik."</p>
   <p>    "He con­ti­nu­es to mend," sa­id the Gre­en Vo­ice. "The go­od news that you had re­ac­hed yo­ur to­wer and scri­ed the three Prin­ces­ses in yo­ur ice-mir­ror che­ered him ex­ce­edingly. He cong­ra­tu­la­tes you and exp­res­ses the ro­yal ap­pro­ba­ti­on and his per­so­nal go­od wis­hes, and lo­oks for­ward to yo­ur con­ti­nu­ing ze­al in di­rec­ting the se­arch for the fu­gi­ti­ves. King Volt­rik com­man­ded that we carry him to the win­dow of his ro­om so that he co­uld gi­ve his be­ni­son to the two se­arch-par­ti­es as they sal­li­ed forth, and on that day ate his first full me­al."</p>
   <p>    "Very go­od, And now re­port to me con­cer­ning the oc­cu­pa­ti­on and pa­ci­fi­ca­ti­on."</p>
   <p>    "The Ci­ta­del and its en­vi­rons are very qu­i­et. The non­com­ba­tant mid­dlec­lass Ru­wen­di­ans and Ci­ta­del Knoll fre­ehol­ders ha­ve pled­ged fe­alty to La­bor­nok, al­be­it grud­gingly. The­re is no or­ga­ni­zed re­sis­tan­ce to our ru­le. Most of the sur­vi­ving nob­les in the so­ut­hern re­alm ha­ve fled in­to the swamp, but they po­se no se­ri­o­us thre­at. The un­bur­ned Dylex vil­la­ges are all fully gar­ri­so­ned now ex­cept for the re­mo­te enc­la­ves of Prok and Goyk, and the or­derly har­vest and pro­ces­sing of fo­ods­tuf­fs has re­su­med. The­re may be so­me shor­ta­ges among the lo­cals du­ring the ra­iny se­ason, but our army of oc­cu­pa­ti­on will be well-fed."</p>
   <p>    "Satisfactory. And the ex­port tra­de?"</p>
   <p>    "The Tre­vis­ta mar­ket has re­ope­ned. Tra­de in me­di­ci­nes, spi­ces, es­sen­ces, and dyes is abo­ut one-qu­ar­ter of the pre-war ra­te. The Mas­ter-Tra­ders ex­pect things to pick up next se­ason. The tim­ber-tra­de is ef­fec­ti­vely stal­led un­til the Ra­ins end. Tass Town, whe­re fo­rest pro­ducts are gat­he­red, was un­to­uc­hed by figh­ting, and its crafts­men sur­ren­de­red blo­od­les­sly, but the­re ha­ve be­en de­lays in get­ting them back to work. Lar­ge amo­unts of lum­ber and raw logs ha­ve pi­led up at the hol­ding yards at Tass Town and at the nort­hern end of the la­ke, ne­ar the Gre­at Ca­use­way. All that is ne­eded to res­to­re tra­de is a re­sump­ti­on of ca­ra­van mo­ve­ment from La­bor­nok and this will be ac­comp­lis­hed du­ring the spring dry se­ason."</p>
   <p>    Orogastus sig­hed. "Very go­od. I am ple­ased with you, my Vo­ice. You will he­ar from me aga­in in two days."</p>
   <p>    "As you will, Al­mighty Mas­ter." The vi­si­on of the Gre­en Vo­ice fa­ded.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus now let his far­se­e­ing eye ro­ve bri­efly west­ward, whe­re he spi­ed Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil's gre­at flo­til­la of ri­ver­bo­ats swe­eping upst­re­am to­ward Tre­vis­ta. The sor­ce­rer did not exert him­self bes­pe­aking the Red Vo­ice. Ti­me eno­ugh for that when the for­ce wo­uld ha­ve tra­ve­led as far as the Thorny Hell. By then he wo­uld ha­ve con­fir­med Prin­cess Ka­di­ya's tra­vel-ro­ute by me­ans of his every-other-day scru­tiny of the ice-mir­ror, and wor­ked out the stra­tegy for ta­king her.</p>
   <p>    The Blue Vo­ice had al­re­ady re­por­ted that the first day of se­arc­hing by Prin­ce An­tar's for­ce had fa­iled to find any tra­ce of Prin­cess Ani­gel. This was no gre­at surp­ri­se to Oro­gas­tus. His re­fe­ren­ce bo­oks had re­ve­aled to him the unu­su­al na­tu­re of her trans­por­ta­ti­on - cle­arly a no­velty ar­ran­ged by the Arc­hi­ma­ge Bi­nah her­self. With the po­wer­ful ri­mo­riks ha­uling her wo­oden punt, Ani­gel had un­do­ub­tedly put a go­od dis­tan­ce bet­we­en her­self and the enemy con­cent­ra­ti­on at Ci­ta­del Knoll. Now that the two-day in­ter­val of rest re­qu­ired by the ice-mir­ror had pas­sed, it wo­uld be pos­sib­le to scry out her new po­si­ti­on, and per­haps de­du­ce whe­re she was he­ading in se­arch of her ta­lis­man.</p>
   <p>    Enrobing and mas­king him­self, the sor­ce­rer ca­me aga­in to the Ca­vern of Black Ice and ad­dres­sed the won­der­ful de­vi­ce:</p>
   <p>    "O po­wer­ful to­ol of the Va­nis­hed Ones, ans­wer my re­qu­est!"</p>
   <p>    The grey­ness lit slowly - so slowly! -li­ke a cand­le with the wick cut dan­ge­ro­usly short. The vo­ice was a ro­ugh whis­per.</p>
   <p>    "Responding… re­qu­est… ple­ase."</p>
   <p>    Curse it! The il­lu­mi­na­ti­on was flic­ke­ring. Per­haps he sho­uld ha­ve let it rest lon­ger af­ter that first rat­her ex­ten­si­ve qu­er­ying. Well, the­re was no help for it now. He wo­uld ask af­ter Ani­gel, and let the ot­her two Prin­ces­ses go for the pre­sent. They we­re still inac­ces­sib­le af­ter all, whi­le the­re was a go­od chan­ce that Ani­gel was wit­hin Prin­ce An­tar's grasp.</p>
   <p>    "View one per­son for as long as the Dark Po­wers per­mit," Oro­gas­tus in­to­ned. "Lo­ca­te pre­sent po­si­ti­on of this per­son on map."</p>
   <p>    "Request… va­li­da­ted. Na­me of per­son." The eery vo­ice strengt­he­ned and the ma­elst­rom wit­hin the icy mir­ror as­su­med an al­most nor­mal as­pect.</p>
   <p>    "Princess Ani­gel of Ru­wen­da." Oro­gas­tus vi­su­ali­zed the girl, then held his bre­ath.</p>
   <p>    Scanning.</p>
   <p>    The map ima­ge for­med. It was not so bright or cle­ar as last ti­me, but it wo­uld do. Ani­gel was on La­ke Wum, clo­se to the wes­tern Gre­en-mi­re sho­re and abo­ut half­way down. She had to be he­ading for Tass Town at the fo­ot of the la­ke. The­re was no ot­her pla­ce to go. But, what a sin­gu­lar des­ti­na­ti­on!</p>
   <p>    "Princess Ani­gel of Ru­wen­da. Lo­ca­ti­on: Sa fifty-one two, La twenty-two fo­ur on Grid Oma."</p>
   <p>    Then ca­me the pic­tu­re, its co­lors dull but cle­ar. The ri­mo­rik-drawn punt mo­ved at only mo­de­ra­te spe­ed thro­ugh the thick Gre­en­mi­re shrub­bery of the wes­tern la­kes­ho­re, whe­re small ar­bo­re­al blo­od­suc­kers, slimy flat things the si­ze of co­ins, be­de­vi­led the Prin­cess and Im­mu by drop­ping from the fo­li­age in­to the bo­at.</p>
   <p>    "If you think the­se suc­kers are bad," Im­mu's mir­ror-ima­ge sa­id to the dis­gus­ted girl, "just wa­it un­til we get in­to the Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest!"</p>
   <p>    "Aha!" Oro­gas­tus cri­ed out exul­tantly. "Now I ha­ve you!"</p>
   <p>    The ice-mir­ror im­me­di­ately rep­ro­ved him: "Bad com­mand. Use de­bug to re­vi­ew yo­ur prog­ram. Hi­atus for rec­har­ge."</p>
   <p>    And it fell in­to a sulk and the ima­ge di­ed.</p>
   <p>    But the sor­ce­rer's ela­ti­on was un­da­un­ted. He had the cru­ci­al clue that wo­uld enab­le him to plot Ani­gel's cap­tu­re, and his vo­ice rang from one end of the fri­gid ca­vern to the ot­her as he ga­ve thanks to the Dark Po­wers.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    The stran­ge lit­tle swim­ming ro­ot led Ka­di­ya and Jagun only a short way back down the Ri­ver Not­har, and then it tur­ned off to the left to as­cend a na­me­less tri­bu­tary. They we­re now he­ading to­ward for­bid­den ter­ri­tory in­de­ed: the tre­ac­he­ro­us wil­der­ness cal­led the Thorny Hell.</p>
   <p>    To ke­ep in sight of the­ir fra­il gu­ide they had to stay in what open wa­ter the­re was. So­me­ti­mes that be­ca­me so shal­low that they both wa­ded on fo­ot, drag­ging the punt with them. Aga­in they ne­eded to cross patc­hes of open wa­ter whe­re Jagun fell back on his tra­ilc­raft and he­aped over the punt a mass of ro­ugh-cut re­ed, so they wo­uld ap­pe­ar to be a drift of soggy growth.</p>
   <p>    Twice that first day Ka­di­ya lay belly flat, pe­ering thro­ugh the ro­ugh thatc­hing of the punt, Jagun stretc­hed with her as they lo­oked upon small gro­ups of Skri­tek. Ka­di­ya pul­led up her wrist to se­al her mo­uth, for her sto­mach now re­bel­led. Much had be­en told of the hi­de­o­us cre­atu­res she spi­ed upon but no­ne of her ima­gi­nings we­re as bad as what she now saw.</p>
   <p>    The first pack se­emed to be hun­ting afo­ot, and the­re we­re yo­ung among them. He­re in the­ir own ter­ri­tory they did not al­ways re­sort to drow­ning, but wal­ked boldly in se­arch of prey. They had split apart, one sec­ti­on mo­ving ahe­ad to ta­ke a stand on one of the rub­ble mo­unts whi­le the re­ma­in­der ca­me to­ward them, stam­ping three-to­ed fe­et, be­ating the growth with the butts of cru­de spe­ars and clubs. Cre­atu­res bro­ke from hi­ding, le­apt, or scut­tled, or tri­ed to fly, whi­le the Skri­tek ahe­ad ma­de su­re of plen­ti­ful cap­tu­res. Nor did they wa­it to carry this prey to any camp but ate at on­ce, so­me of the­ir catch still ali­ve, qu­ar­re­ling over por­ti­ons. Watc­hing, Ka­di­ya swal­lo­wed sickly, so­ur bi­le in her mo­uth. But she ma­de her­self lo­ok. For she had le­ar­ned one thing from Jagun: know well the ha­bits of yo­ur enemy, his go­ings and co­mings, his fo­od, his sle­ep, all that is his com­mon cus­tom, le­arn and re­mem­ber.</p>
   <p>    While they hid from the fi­ends of the Mi­re, the­ir swim­ming gu­ide ap­pe­ared -by so­me ins­tinct, if one might de­em it that-to se­ek sa­fely, lin­ge­ring ne­ar the dro­oping ed­ge of the thatch which co­ve­red them.</p>
   <p>    The se­cond parry of Skri­tek which they en­co­un­te­red pas­sed la­ter, ne­ar sun­down. This ti­me the­re we­re no cro­aking cri­es, no stri­king at the mass of ve­ge­ta­ti­on. They wal­ked easily, se­eming to thre­ad so­me tra­il Ka­di­ya co­uld not see from her po­si­ti­on. And with the­se was anot­her! A hu­man be­ing. The girl gas­ped and Jagun nud­ged her sharply.</p>
   <p>    It was cer­ta­inly a hu­man ma­le wal­king the tra­il with Skri­tek, but he was no pri­so­ner. He was dres­sed all in red, but with the fab­ric all mud­di­ed from the swamp. His he­ad was co­ve­red by a ho­od which ex­ten­ded down to his mo­uth in the front, mas­king half his fa­ce. He wo­re a sword and car­ri­ed a short spe­ar. He spo­ke with his monst­ro­us com­pa­ni­ons in so gut­tu­ral a se­ri­es of no­ises that Ka­di­ya won­de­red how he co­uld pro­du­ce them, ap­pa­rently dis­pu­ting with one of the Drown-ers-po­in­ting in one di­rec­ti­on whi­le the Skri­tek wan­ted to pro­ce­ed in anot­her. And he won that small clash of wills.</p>
   <p>    In all his­tory, in the gat­he­red le­gends, the lo­re of Nysso­mu and Uis­gu, pol­der and Ci­ta­del, ne­ver had the­re be­en any tru­ce bet­we­en the Skri­tek and anot­her ra­ce. Now Jagun was pro­ven cor­rect: so­me­how Volt­rik or Oro­gas­tus had en­lis­ted the­se og­res in­to the­ir ser­vi­ce. Ho­we­ver, the­ir re­pu­ta­ti­on for tre­ac­hery was well set. It was a bra­ve man who wal­ked with them, even if he ser­ved a blo­ody ca­use. His con­fi­den­ce hin­ted that it was cer­ta­inly mo­re than for­ce of arms or per­su­asi­on of words which was his pro­tec­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>That must be one of the Vo­ices</emphasis>! Ka­di­ya shi­ve­red. Her hand was flat aga­inst her bre­ast over the amu­let. <emphasis>Hi­de us</emphasis>, she beg­ged it word­les­sly. <emphasis>Pro­tect us.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    As to what - or whom - that parry hun­ted, Ka­di­ya had lit­tle do­ubt. She did not know whe­re Ha­ra­mis or Ani­gel had go­ne, but she was he­re. This band of Skri­tek snif­fing out tra­ils, com­pa­ni­oned by one of Oro­gas­tus's ser­vants, we­re in­tent upon fin­ding her. That the sor­ce­rer's acoly­te had not be­en sud­denly awa­re of her was as­to­un­ding. Cer­ta­inly Oro­gas­tus must ha­ve so­me met­hod of se­arch ot­her than eye or ear. She co­uld hardly be­li­eve it when the bru­tes pas­sed wit­ho­ut any alarm be­ing ra­ised. But the Black Tril­li­um's ma­gic was not easily over­co­me.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya squ­ir­med a lit­tle for­ward and lo­oked in­to the wa­ter. The ro­ot-gu­ide res­ted the­re as qu­i­etly as if it lay upon a tab­le. She drew forth her amu­let. It gle­amed with po­tency and the gre­en light un­der­wa­ter se­emed to pul­sa­te in sympathy, qu­ive­ring in­to li­fe. Tho­ugh it had be­en ori­gi­nal­ly po­in­ted to­ward that sho­re along which the tra­il led, now it shif­ted co­ur­se un­til it was pa­ral­lel with the op­po­si­te bank. Ka­di­ya saw Jagun re­ach for the scul­ling oar and felt the skiff ans­wer.</p>
   <p>    They hug­ged the sho­re­li­ne, al­ways alert to any mo­ve­ment, pa­using now and then as Jagun used no­se and ear to jud­ge what lay abo­ut. The­re was only the usu­al hum of in­sects, the pe­eping of mud-dwel­lers, the na­tu­ral so­unds of day.</p>
   <p>    Any con­fi­den­ce which that might ha­ve gi­ven them was sharply dis­pel­led. They ca­me not only to the end of the wi­der la­ne of wa­ter but al­so to a bar­ri­er of what ap­pe­ared to be an is­let stan­ding well abo­ve the wa­ter. In­to a grim land the ro­ot-gu­ide po­in­ted stra­ight ahe­ad. A few fe­et abo­ve them we­re tang­led the black, rot­ting ske­le­tons of tre­es which ga­ve sup­port to a net­work of what lo­oked li­ke vi­nes. The gro­und of­fe­red bed­ding to dis­ten­ded ball-sha­ped growths of red­dish blue.</p>
   <p>    Jagun po­in­ted to the ne­arest of the­se. "Tho­se are kil­lers no­uris­hed by the fo­ul­ness of this so­il. Avo­id them as you wo­uld a po­iso­ned kni­fe, King's Da­ugh­ter."</p>
   <p>    Here was ut­ter si­len­ce, a land which co­uld not or wo­uld not sup­port any form of li­fe ex­cept evil. Still the ro­ot that was the­ir gu­ide did not vary di­rec­ti­on. It was stra­ight ahe­ad that they must go.</p>
   <p>    A put­rid odor ma­de Ka­di­ya gag. She did not ne­ed Jagun's to­uch as war­ning. The­re was mo­ve­ment among the de­ad tre­es, a swis­hing so­und - and a fe­ma­le Skri­tek ca­me in­to vi­ew.</p>
   <p>    She did not march with any alert pur­po­se, but rat­her drag­ged her­self along, le­aning on a staff, swa­ying from si­de to si­de. She was not sle­ek or slim of body. Ins­te­ad her gre­enish flesh was blo­ated, the pa­unch prot­ru­ding so that the cre­atu­re was pla­inly top-he­avy. On­ce she clutc­hed out at the cro­oked limb of a de­ad tree and that crumb­led to dust, so she went to her kne­es. No strug­gle co­uld bring her up­right aga­in and she craw­led un­til she re­ac­hed a mo­re subs­tan­ti­al tree to pull her­self up.</p>
   <p>    Her body twis­ted. Her open mo­uth vo­iced a harsh cry. From be­ne­ath the over­hang of that hu­ge belly the­re prot­ru­ded a whi­te obj­ect that wrig­gled as if it had a li­fe of its own, fell to the gro­und, and hum­ped away. This was fol­lo­wed by a se­cond, a third, un­til Ka­di­ya co­uld co­unt ten fat, whi­tish worm­li­ke spawn, per­haps as big as a hu­man baby's he­ad.</p>
   <p>    The mot­her Skri­tek col­lap­sed aga­inst the tree she had emb­ra­ced and the yo­ung, which had be­en pla­inly qu­es­ting for so­met­hing, tur­ned ne­arly as one to swarm over her who had gi­ven them birth. They we­re pla­inly-fe­eding.</p>
   <p>    Jagun crept up be­si­de the girl. "The new­born spawn are ra­ve­no­us." His vo­ice was the fa­in­test of whis­pers. "And that luck­less dam had no me­at wa­iting to ap­pe­ase her bro­od."</p>
   <p>    Already two or three of the lo­ath­so­me yo­ung had left the car­cass of the fe­ma­le Skri­tek. Two ca­me hum­ping for­ward. As far as the girl co­uld see they had no sign of re­al he­ads, alt­ho­ugh they car­ri­ed the front ends of the­ir bo­di­es a lit­tle hig­her. The­se wa­ved abo­ut in the air and then cen­te­red on the di­rec­ti­on of the punt. They be­gan to crawl to­ward the wa­ter.</p>
   <p>    Jagun mo­ved qu­ickly. His blow­pi­pe was re­ady and the first dart thud­ded de­eply in­to the body of the le­ading lar­va. It was fol­lo­wed by a se­cond which as easily pic­ked off its com­pa­ni­on. The spawn be­at the fo­re­parts of the­ir bo­di­es upon the gro­und and then we­re still.</p>
   <p>    Jagun hitc­hed his hun­ter's bag to­ward him and wor­ked out of it a much fol­ded strip of so­me subs­tan­ce as fi­ne and trans­pa­rently wo­ven as a fes­ti­val ve­il. He split this in two and han­ded half to Ka­di­ya, ges­tu­ring that she was to fol­low his examp­le in its use, twi­ning the length abo­ut the he­ad so it co­ve­red eyes, no­se, and mo­uth. He tes­ted the knot the girl had ti­ed to fas­ten hers be­fo­re he went ahe­ad.</p>
   <p>    More of the lar­val Skri­tek we­re tur­ning to­ward the punt, the­ir fo­re ends lif­ted as if fol­lo­wing the scent of prey. This ti­me Jagun aimed not at them, but at the red­dish-blue bul­bo­us growths sprin­ging from the so­il aro­und them. The first ball his dart en­te­red exp­lo­ded as if so­me for­ce had be­en imp­ri­so­ned un­der its rind. Out­ward shot a clo­ud of blue dust, which was jo­ined by anot­her and anot­her clo­ud un­til the­re was a drift of spo­res ac­ross the sho­re as thick as a fog. Jagun pus­hed the punt back to mid-wa­ter and kept it the­re un­til the clo­ud bro­ke in­to wisps and set­tled. Whe­re the Skri­tek spawn had craw­led the­re we­re now lumps of slimy jel­ly slowly sin­king in­to the gro­und.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya re­ac­hed in­to the wa­ter and ca­ught up the stem of the tril­li­um. It tug­ged, stra­ight-po­in­ting in her hand. Then it slip­ped from her hold and flew thro­ugh the air as if she had thrown it. The­re was no es­ca­ping the fact that it now lay on that evil­ly spot­ted sho­re whe­re the Skri­tek mot­her's de­ad body lay, and that it po­in­ted in­land. The Prin­cess lo­oked to Jagun. He shrug­ged.</p>
   <p>    Then he spo­ke, his words muf­fled by the imp­ro­vi­sed mask he still wo­re. "The­re li­es the Thorny Hell it­self, Far­se­er. It wo­uld se­em that we ha­ve no cho­ice but to en­ter in."</p>
   <p>    That she had no cho­ice was evi­dent. Twist or turn as she might, she co­uld not le­ave the path the Arc­hi­ma­ge's ma­gic had de­sig­na­ted for her. She craw­led stiffly on­to the bank. The ro­ot of the tril­li­um slid ste­adily for­ward, tho­ugh it ma­de a wi­de swing abo­ut the ro­und po­iso­no­us growths.</p>
   <p>    "What li­es ahe­ad?" de­man­ded Ka­di­ya as she sho­ul­de­red the se­cond hun­ter's bag.</p>
   <p>    Jagun sho­ok his he­ad. "Unknown land, King's Da­ugh­ter. If for­tu­ne fa­vors us we may re­ach the hol­dings of the Uis­gu."</p>
   <p>    She step­ped ca­re­ful­ly aro­und one of the yel­low balls, ta­king go­od ca­re not to lo­ok at the tree whe­re lay the Skri­tek dam's half-pic­ked bo­nes.</p>
   <p>    "Fortune?" The Prin­cess ga­ve a bit­ter lit­tle la­ugh. "No one holds the go­od will of that for long."</p>
   <p>    They ca­me to a we­ed-li­ned chan­nel with gre­en-scum­med wa­ter. One of the de­ad tre­es had fal­len to span it and the­re we­re prints in the mud sho­wing that it ser­ved as a brid­ge. Ka­di­ya sto­oped to pick up the tril­li­um-ro­ot, fe­aring that it might gli­de on in­to the wa­ter­way and be lost. It was stiff and stra­ight in her hand. From its tip sprang an ema­na­ti­on li­ke a thre­ad of black fla­me; and alt­ho­ugh the­re was no bre­eze, it po­in­ted ahe­ad in the di­rec­ti­on they we­re to go: in­to a wil­der­ness of to­we­ring thorn-ferns twi­ce the he­ight of a man.</p>
   <p>    They tra­ve­led on for ho­urs. Then fi­nal­ly Jagun sa­id: "We will stop he­re for the night."</p>
   <p>    The area which the ro­ot-gu­ide had bro­ught them to sto­od so­mew­hat abo­ve the le­vel of the rest of the gro­und. It was ba­re of the thorn-ferns and the­re we­re no­ne of the po­iso­no­us balls to be se­en. Ro­ugh grass with sword-sharp ed­ges sur­ro­un­ded them as they ca­me upon a gre­at ir­re­gu­lar mo­und. Tho­ugh they had se­en very few evi­den­ces of ru­ins sin­ce they had left Noth, it was pla­in that in­tel­li­gen­ce and not na­tu­re had sha­ped this outc­rop. Ka­di­ya clutc­hed a small shrub to help pull her­self up and lo­osed a clod of ro­ots and earth. She lo­oked upon what se­emed to be dres­sed sto­ne. It was not the dark gra­ni­te which was the com­mon const­ruc­ti­on ma­te­ri­al of the ru­ins she knew, but a mi­ne­ral much smo­ot­her, so slick she won­de­red that the sod had fo­und ro­ot the­re at all. And it had a pe­cu­li­ar she­en un­der the set­ting sun.</p>
   <p>    "What is this?" She cal­led Jagun's at­ten­ti­on to it. It co­uld be that the ro­ot-gu­ide had led them to an ar­ti­fact so hu­ge that she co­uld not be­gin to gu­ess its me­aning or use. As she cla­wed away mo­re earth to un­co­ver it, it be­ca­me ob­vi­o­us that the ru­in was cer­ta­inly not ma­de of sto­ne. The sur­fa­ce was sle­ek un­der her muddy fin­ger­tips.</p>
   <p>    Jagun lo­oked at her dis­co­very and then hur­ri­edly aver­ted his eyes. "It is of the Va­nis­hed Ones." He ma­de a small ges­tu­re in the air and sta­red in­tently at the tril­li­um-ro­ot Ka­di­ya car­ri­ed. Its black fla­me, which had in­di­ca­ted the­ir ro­ute, still held as­lant for a mo­ment; and then it stra­igh­te­ned and fla­red with a gre­en ha­lo.</p>
   <p>    Suddenly Ka­di­ya felt that the ac­hing bur­den of do­ubt which had held her for so long was ligh­te­ned. She pul­led her­self up to the top of the mo­und and fo­und that she was ba­lan­ced on the rim of what might be a gi­ant bowl. The si­des slo­ped down­ward ab­ruptly, and ap­pa­rently fre­qu­ent sli­des ca­used by storms had cle­ared sod and det­ri­tus from stretc­hes of the sur­fa­ce, which as far as she co­uld see was ne­it­her pit­ted nor ero­ded.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya was ama­zed, and sud­denly she la­ug­hed.</p>
   <p>    "Hunter, this land holds many surp­ri­ses. Per­haps for­tu­ne smi­les af­ter all for I fe­el - " She flung her arms wi­de and drew a gre­at bre­ath of air. The Va­nis­hed Ones se­emed to ap­pro­ve her pre­sen­ce he­re, even wel­co­me her. She re­j­o­iced in a ligh­ter he­art. He­re all the dark­ness and ter­rors that had op­pres­sed her ap­pe­ared small and far away. She felt no mo­re of the fa­ti­gue of her jo­ur­ney, only a ri­sing ex­ci­te­ment and a be­li­ef that wha­te­ver lay be­fo­re them wo­uld in­de­ed work to her pur­po­se.</p>

   <p>    Prince An­tar set out in pur­su­it of Prin­cess Ani­gel with an ex­pe­di­ti­onary for­ce of twenty knights and sixty sol­di­ers, and al­so the sor­ce­rer's Blue Vo­ice, who wo­uld ke­ep the Prin­ce ap­pri­sed of the girl's po­si­ti­on thro­ugh con­tacts with his far­se­e­ing mas­ter. The men of La­bor­nok tra­ve­led from the Ci­ta­del in three lar­ge flat­bo­ats equ­ip­ped with auxi­li­ary punts. The fro­ni­al mo­unts be­lon­ging to the knights we­re left be­hind by prin­cely or­der, which oc­ca­si­oned gre­at grumb­ling by Sir Ri­nu­tar and Sir Ka­ron and the­ir cro­ni­es, even tho­ugh they co­uld not say how and whe­re they ho­ped to ri­de the gre­at ste­eds in the track­less Mazy Mi­re. The flat­bo­ats each had three crews of oars­men to row do­ub­le-ti­me in se­qu­en­ti­al shifts, and the big bo­ats fa­irly flew along the calm wa­ters of the Lo­wer Mu­tar and La­ke Wum.</p>
   <p>    Following Oro­gas­tus's tri­ump­hant se­cond scry, the se­arch-par­ry was aug­men­ted by the Mas­ter-Tra­der Ed­zar, who was as ex­pe­ri­en­ced in de­aling with the tim­ber-pur­ve­ying Wyvi­lo abo­ri­gi­nes of the Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest as he was with the Nysso­mu of Tre­vis­ta. Thro­ugh the in­ter­me­di­ary Blue Vo­ice, Ed­zar had con­fer­red with the sor­ce­rer and de­vi­sed a plan that he dec­la­red to be fo­olp­ro­of.</p>
   <p>    Now the La­bor­no­ki for­ce was fast ap­pro­ac­hing Tass Town, the only si­zab­le hu­man set­tle­ment on the la­ke. The tim­ber-tra­ding cen­ter of Ru­wen­da was a rat­her shabby ag­glo­me­ra­ti­on of docks, wa­re­ho­uses, and shan­ti­es si­tu­ated on an is­land, sur­ro­un­ded on all si­des by flo­ating bo­oms which for­med gre­at pens that enc­lo­sed the raw logs. The Mas­ter-Tra­der Ed­zar exp­la­ined to the knights that many of the­se wo­uld be trans­por­ted to hol­ding yards at the up­per end of the la­ke by for­ming them in­to rafts and sa­iling them north du­ring the ra­iny se­ason, when the pre­va­iling winds we­re fa­vo­rab­le. The mo­re va­lu­ab­le cut lum­ber and pe­eled spars we­re lo­aded on flat­bo­ats and trans­ship­ped at any ti­me of the ye­ar to the nort­hern yards, when­ce they we­re car­ted away via the Tra­de Ro­ute du­ring the dry se­asons.</p>
   <p>    Riding on the for­ward deck of the flags­hip with the aw­ning sha­ding them from the bla­zing la­ke sun, the Prin­ce's men we­re bo­red with vo­ya­ging and the ge­ni­al tra­der's lec­tu­re - the­re be­ing lit­tle el­se to do but drink and watch the sce­nery - and eager to be­gin the­ir hunt aga­in.</p>
   <p>    Their first se­arch for Prin­cess Ani­gel in the Mazy Mi­re ne­ar Ci­ta­del Knoll and the Gre­at Ca­use­way had be­en a ne­ar-fi­as­co. The men we­re che­va­li­ers, not sa­ilors, and had no know­led­ge of how to di­rect a se­arch on wa­ter. The for­ce of twenty auxi­li­ary punts, each be­aring a knight-com­man­der, three men-at-arms, and three oars­men, had mil­led abo­ut the Mi­re every which way un­der the or­ders of the­ir inex­pe­ri­en­ced cap­ta­ins. The­re had be­en squ­ab­bles over who sho­uld se­arch the ne­ar are­as and who the far, who the cle­ar chan­nels and who the den­se thic­kets craw­ling with ve­no­mo­us wa­ter-worms, stin­ging ver­min, and vo­ra­ci­o­us mi­lin­gal-fish.</p>
   <p>    Several ho­urs we­re was­ted cris­scros­sing the sa­me easy ter­ri­tory and le­aving ot­her pla­ces un­to­uc­hed, un­til the skip­per of the flags­hip had tact­ful­ly sug­ges­ted to Prin­ce An­tar that the wa­ter­men, rat­her than the knights, sho­uld di­rect the mo­ve­ments of the bo­ats, with a lar­ge re­ward of­fe­red to the crew that sho­uld first lo­ca­te the Prin­cess. An ef­fi­ci­ent se­arch was then con­duc­ted, which un­for­tu­na­tely ca­me to na­ught. Prin­ce An­tar did not se­em at all de­j­ec­ted by the­ir lack of suc­cess.</p>
   <p>    Now, as the se­arch party ap­pro­ac­hed the sce­ne of mo­re pro­mi­sing ac­ti­on, An­tar be­ca­me mo­ro­se and edgy, so that the ro­ugh-hewn Su Ri­nu­tar whis­pe­red to a few of his in­ti­ma­tes that the Prin­ce se­emed not to subsc­ri­be who­le­he­ar­tedly to the­ir qu­est. His re­marks we­re over­he­ard by the bluff and lo­yal Sir Pe­na­pat, who to­ok gre­at ex­cep­ti­on to them and thre­ate­ned to bre­ak Ri­nu­tar's he­ad.</p>
   <p>    An un­se­emly fra­cas was avo­ided only by the in­ter­ven­ti­on of An­tar him­self, who res­to­red or­der with the help of his mars­hal, Sir Owa­non. The Prin­ce then ret­re­ated to his so­li­tary po­si­ti­on in the bows of the flags­hip whe­re no­ne da­red to dis­turb him, and re­ma­ined the­re un­til they we­re abo­ut to dock.</p>
   <p>    At this ti­me, the Prin­ce cal­led upon the Mas­ter-Tra­der Ed­zar to bring out his maps on­ce aga­in and re­ca­pi­tu­la­te his sche­me for the en­ti­re knightly party, so that the­re wo­uld be no mi­sun­ders­tan­dings when they di­sem­bar­ked. Ed­zar still wo­re his gold-embro­ide­red gre­en ta­bard, but he had exc­han­ged his oran­ge ro­be for a vi­vid purp­le one, and his le­af hat for anot­her, even bro­ader of brim, wo­ven int­ri­ca­tely of long co­ni­fer ne­ed­les and ban­ded with lar­ge ce­ri­se flo­wers.</p>
   <p>    "As you can see, my Lords," he be­gan, "three lar­ge ri­vers, inc­lu­ding the Lo­wer Mu­tar, fe­ed in­to La­ke Wum. But the­re is just one out­let, the Gre­at Mu­tar, which flows in­to the Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest and is the only cor­ri­dor in­to that how­ling wil­der­ness. If the mighty Oro­gas­tus has in­terp­re­ted his vi­si­on cor­rectly, then Prin­cess Ani­gel is he­ading for the fo­rest, and to get the­re, she must pass <emphasis>he­re</emphasis>."</p>
   <p>    His fin­ger in­di­ca­ted La­ke Wum 's so­ut­hern outf­low, which on the map was la­be­led TASS FALLS.</p>
   <p>    The lanky, sa­tur­ni­ne Blue Vo­ice now in­si­nu­ated him­self for­ward. He usu­al­ly kept to the flat­bo­at skip­per's ca­bin, be­ing shy of sun­light as a slug; but the­ir ne­ar ap­pro­ach to Tass Town had bro­ught him on deck.</p>
   <p>    "My worthy Mas­ter-Tra­der, the ice-mir­ror of my Al­mighty Mas­ter not only se­es, but al­so he­ars. The far­sen­sing lasts but a mi­nu­te. Ne­vert­he­less, on his se­cond scrying, my Mas­ter cle­arly he­ard the Prin­cess Ani­gel's ser­vant re­mark abo­ut the­ir im­pen­ding jo­ur­ney in­to the Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­ce scow­led at the map. "If we miss her at the falls, we'll ha­ve to cha­se her down the Gre­at Mu­tar. It's less than a fort­night to the ra­iny se­ason… and what in Zo­to's Na­me are we go­ing to use down the­re for bo­ats?"</p>
   <p>    Edzar sa­id: "It sho­uld be pos­sib­le for us to lo­wer our own punts via the log-lift. Ho­we­ver, the Wyvi­lo ha­ve the­ir own much fas­ter ri­verc­raft mo­ored be­low the falls. In the nor­mal co­ur­se of events, hu­mans do not ri­de in them. Ru­wen­di­an hu­mans, that is. But if we find it ne­ces­sary to pur­sue the Prin­cess down the Gre­at Mu­tar we might - er-try to con­vin­ce the Wyvi­lo to trans­port us."</p>
   <p>    Sir Ri­nu­tar ga­ve a wic­ked chuck­le. "Now, how co­uld they pos­sibly re­fu­se to help a fi­ne lot of lads li­ke our­sel­ves?"</p>
   <p>    He had be­en shar­pe­ning his sword, which he now swept up in a gent­le arc, brin­ging the po­int to be­ar on the Mas­ter-Tra­der's bul­bo­us no­se. Ed­zar splut­te­red and the knights la­ug­hed.</p>
   <p>    The Blue Vo­ice sa­id: "I am em­po­we­red to de­monst­ra­te cer­ta­in ma­gic to the fo­rest Od­dlings, sho­uld they be re­luc­tant to as­sist us. Bet­we­en my sort of per­su­asi­on and Sir Ri­nu­tar's, we sho­uld ex­pe­ri­en­ce no gre­at dif­fi­culty se­cu­ring ad­di­ti­onal trans­port, sho­uld that con­tin­gency ari­se… Of co­ur­se, if Mas­ter Ed­zar's plan suc­ce­eds, we will ta­ke Prin­cess Ani­gel he­re at the falls."</p>
   <p>    Sir Owa­non, who was Prin­ce An­tar's clo­se fri­end as well as his se­cond-in-com­mand, was a yo­un­ger man with a hu­mo­ro­us, in­tel­li­gent fa­ce. He now lif­ted an ad­mo­ni­tory fin­ger. "Hark! Is that the cas­ca­de it­self I he­ar?"</p>
   <p>    "It is in­de­ed, my Lord," the tra­der rep­li­ed. " Tass Falls are qu­ite im­pas­sab­le to ri­verc­raft. They are mo­re than sixty ells high and spew a gre­at vo­lu­me of wa­ter, even in the dry se­ason. Be­low them, the Gre­at Mu­tar flows wi­de and slow to the sea. Wyvi­lo log­gers ha­ve no tro­ub­le brin­ging the­ir tim­ber upst­re­am to the falls. It is a droll sight to see the stran­ge in­hu­man be­ings perc­hed in a long li­ne atop a flo­ating log of he­ro­ic pro­por­ti­ons, po­ling it upst­re­am whi­le sin­ging the­ir bar­ba­ric ant­hems."</p>
   <p>    "And no do­ubt plan­ning in­ge­ni­o­us ways to sli­ce up the li­ver of the next un­lucky hu­man they me­et," draw­led Sir Ka­ron. Most of the ot­her knights la­ug­hed grimly.</p>
   <p>    "No, no, my lords," Ed­zar pro­tes­ted. "For all the­ir hor­ri­fic ap­pe­aran­ce, the Wyvi­lo are - er - re­la­ti­vely ci­vi­li­zed. You are thin­king of the­ir co­usins the Glis­mak, who li­ve furt­her so­uth. <emphasis>They</emphasis> are the ones with can­ni­ba­lis­tic ten­den­ci­es - "</p>
   <p>    "Stones of Zo­to!" so­me­body exc­la­imed. "We must fight man-eaters?"</p>
   <p>    "You can hold our clo­aks, Sto­la­fat, if the pros­pect fre­ezes yo­ur guts," je­ered Ri­nu­tar.</p>
   <p>    "Enough of this," Prin­ce An­tar bro­ke in. "Mas­ter Ed­zar, show us aga­in this so-cal­led fo­olp­ro­of plan of yo­urs." And to his men: "Pay at­ten­ti­on and ce­ase this bic­ke­ring!"</p>
   <p>    Edzar flo­uris­hed the map and resp­re­ad it, bec­ko­ning all to co­me clo­ser. "See he­re. Tass Town on its is­land li­es ne­ar the la­ke's eas­tern sho­re. The eas­tern chan­nel is comp­le­tely bloc­ked with log bo­oms. To the west are fe­wer bo­oms, for the­re ari­se the rocks cal­led the Fangs of Mu­nj­uno, thro­ugh which swift cur­rents po­ur be­fo­re sur­ging over the rim of the cas­ca­de. The wes­tern la­kes­ho­re at this po­int is she­er rock and qu­ite im­pas­sab­le, whi­le on the eas­tern sho­re is thick jung­le, pe­net­ra­ted only by the skid-ro­ad that le­ads from the gre­at log-lift at the pre­ci­pi­ce ed­ge to the co­ve op­po­si­te Tass Town whe­re the wo­od is put in­to the wa­ter. This eas­tern ro­ad is the pla­ce whe­re we must set up our am­bush."</p>
   <p>    Edzar po­in­ted first to the map, then to the eas­tern sho­re, which lay ac­ross from the­ir doc­king pla­ce, be­yond a gre­at laby­rinth of flo­ating tim­ber. The Prin­ce and his men co­uld see num­bers of ske­le­tal wa­gons par­ked on the skid-ro­ad, ha­ving whe­els tal­ler than a man; but the­re se­emed to be no pe­op­le or draft-ani­mals mo­ving abo­ut over the­re, and in­de­ed the sho­re lo­oked de­ser­ted.</p>
   <p>    "The war bro­ught most com­mer­ce in Tass Town to a halt," Ed­zar exp­la­ined. "The Ru­wen­di­an wor­kers who nor­mal­ly staff the lum­ber mill be­low the falls, the gre­at lift, and the skid-ro­ad ha­ve not yet re­tur­ned to work. Lord Zon­til, one of Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil's most trus­ted aides, has be­en char­ged with set­ting up a gar­ri­son he­re. He ex­pects to ha­ve the si­tu­ati­on well in hand by the end of the Ra­ins. All the logs that you see now in the wa­ter will be sent to the nort­hern end of the la­ke by that ti­me. And by the spring dry se­ason, tim­ber pro­duc­ti­on sho­uld be back to nor­mal."</p>
   <p>    "Cease bo­ring us with yo­ur mer­can­ti­le tri­via, tra­der!" Sir Ri­nu­tar slap­ped the map im­pa­ti­ently. "Do you gu­aran­tee that the fu­gi­ti­ve wench can get to the Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest by no ot­her ro­ute than this - this skid-ro­ad?"</p>
   <p>    Edzar drew him­self up in of­fen­ded dig­nity. "I do. The­re is a vast uns­ca­lab­le es­carp­ment along this bor­der of the Ru­wen­da tab­le­land. Un­told ages ago a nar­row fo­ot­path was cut by the Od­dlings in the cliff east of the falls. The gre­at log-lift and the lum­ber mill be­low, that is po­we­red by the fal­ling wa­ter, we­re bu­ilt by the first hu­mans in­ha­bi­ting Ru­wen­da, uti­li­zing fo­un­da­ti­ons that are sa­id to ha­ve be­en left by the Va­nis­hed Ones. The­re is no way from La­ke Wum to the Gre­at Mu­tar Ri­ver sa­ve the lift and the fo­ot­path. The Prin­cess must ta­ke the skid-ro­ad to at­ta­in eit­her one."</p>
   <p>    The three flat­bo­ats of the se­arch for­ce we­re now be­ing ti­ed up at the ma­in Tass Town dock, which al­so se­emed cons­pi­cu­o­usly de­vo­id of ac­ti­vity. Well-armed sol­di­ers of La­bor­nok sto­od gu­ard all along the qu­ay­si­de as glum-lo­oking Ru­wen­di­ans hand­led the li­nes and pul­led the gangp­lanks in­to pla­ce. A La­bor­no­ki nob­le­man in ela­bo­ra­te ar­mor, at-ten­ded by se­ve­ral of­fi­cers, wa­ited im­pa­ti­ently for the doc­king ma­ne­uvers to be comp­le­ted so that he co­uld gre­et the Prin­ce.</p>
   <p>    But An­tar was bent over the map, gi­ving inst­ruc­ti­ons. "This is the way we shall dep­loy, then. We will di­vi­de our for­ce in­to three com­pa­ni­es - Owa­non to le­ad the first, Do­da­bi­lik the se­cond, and Ri­nu­tar the third - to be sta­ti­oned at the skid-ro­ad lan­ding, mid­way down the ro­ad whe­re the fo­ot­path cuts off, and at the top of the log-lift."</p>
   <p>    "You do not in­tend to com­mand a com­pany yo­ur­self, my Prin­ce?" Sir Ri­nu­tar's to­ne was ta­in­ted with the sligh­test arch­ness.</p>
   <p>    "No," sa­id An­tar coldly. "The Blue Vo­ice and I will co­or­di­na­te the ac­ti­on from a po­int of van­ta­ge. He is ab­le to far­see for short dis­tan­ces. Pe­na­pat will al­so re­ma­in with us, sin­ce his fo­ot is not yet he­aled from the wa­ter-worm bi­te, to hand­le the sig­nal­men and mes­sen­gers who will trans­mit my or­ders. We must ma­ke ab­so­lu­tely cer­ta­in" - the Prin­ce's ga­ze met that of the ho­ve­ring Blue Vo­ice - "that Prin­cess Ani­gel do­es not slip thro­ugh our fin­gers aga­in."</p>
   <p>    It was just af­ter no­on of the­ir third day on La­ke Wum, and the so­und of Tass Falls rumb­led in the air li­ke fa­ra­way thun­der, its brink lost in spark­ling mist. Ani­gel and Im­mu had ap­pro­ac­hed Tass Town 's is­land with gre­at ca­re, and the­ir bo­at now lay con­ce­aled be­ne­ath a we­eping tree that grew from a cleft in a gre­at pre­ci­pi­ce along the wes­tern sho­re.</p>
   <p>    All abo­ut the­ir hi­ding pla­ce hu­ge rocks ro­se from the wa­ter. Bet­we­en them and the is­land less than two hund­red ells away, the fi­ve po­in­ted Fangs of Mu­nj­uno mar­ked the po­int of no re­turn abo­ve the falls. A small bo­at co­uld bre­ast the cur­rent north of the rocks and sa­fely re­ach the log bo­oms and the op­po­si­te sho­re; but to pass so­uth of the Fangs me­ant be­ing trap­ped in swif­ter wa­ters and swept over the ca­ta­ract.</p>
   <p>    "What we must do," Im­mu sa­id, la­ying out a fru­gal lunch in the gre­en sha­de, "is wa­it un­til night­fall, then cross over abo­ve the Fangs. The­re is a ro­ad on the sho­re over the­re that runs less than half a le­ague. We fol­low it to a ste­ep path that le­ads down to the Ru­wen­di­an saw­mill at the fo­ot of the falls, and ste­al anot­her bo­at the­re."</p>
   <p>    "But the ri­mo­riks-!" Ani­gel cri­ed.</p>
   <p>    "But but but! We let the go­od cre­atu­res go free, back to the­ir ho­me wa­ters. Did you think you co­uld ke­ep them as pets fo­re­ver?"</p>
   <p>    Anigel hung her he­ad. "I did not think at all."</p>
   <p>    Immu pat­ted her sho­ul­der. "Ne­ver mind. The Gre­at Mu­tar is very shal­low, asi­de from the ma­in chan­nel. We can ma­ke a log raft and po­le downst­re­am if ne­ed be - and at le­ast one of yo­ur gre­at fe­ars will be left be­hind. The tro­ops of La­bor­nok will ne­ver think to lo­ok for us in the Tas­sa­le­yo. With luck, the Wyvi­lo will res­pect yo­ur tril­li­um amu­let just as the Uis­gu did, and they will help you on yo­ur qu­est."</p>
   <p>    Anigel lo­oked up du­bi­o­usly from munc­hing her dri­ed ro­ots. "Do you re­al­ly think so? I ha­ve he­ard that they are very hos­ti­le to hu­man­kind, and fe­ar­so­me to lo­ok upon as well."</p>
   <p>    "They're not the kind of Folk you wo­uld in­vi­te to a grand ball at the Ci­ta­del," Im­mu con­ce­ded. "So­me Nysso­mu say that ae­ons ago mem­bers of our ra­ce we­re sto­len away by the Skri­tek and for­ced to con­sort with them, and from the ma­ting aro­se both the Wyvi­lo and the­ir mo­re pri­mi­ti­ve ne­igh­bors, the Glis­mak."</p>
   <p>    "What do they lo­ok li­ke?" Ani­gel as­ked, lic­king her fin­gers.</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ve ne­ver se­en one, but they are sa­id to com­bi­ne Skri­tek fe­atu­res with tho­se of Nysso­mu or Uis­gu."</p>
   <p>    "Ugh!" sa­id the Prin­cess.</p>
   <p>    "Whatever the­ir as­pect," Im­mu con­ti­nu­ed rep­ro­vingly, "the Wyvi­lo are al­so su­bj­ects of the Whi­te Lady who re­ve­re the Black Tril­li­um, and so we may ho­pe they will re­ce­ive us kindly."</p>
   <p>    "These Glis­mak-they are unf­ri­endly to hu­mans?"</p>
   <p>    Immu sig­hed. "Li­ke the Skri­tek, tho­se fi­ends of the Mazy Mi­re, the Glis­mak ha­te all be­ings sa­ve them­sel­ves. We must pray that yo­ur ta­lis­man - "</p>
   <p>    "Look!" cri­ed Ani­gel, po­in­ting ac­ross the wa­ter. "Oh, lo­ok! A who­le fle­et of punts co­ming out from be­hind the is­land-<emphasis>and the le­ader be­ars the ban­ner of La­bor­nok</emphasis>!"</p>
   <p>    Immu sha­ded her eyes and pe­ered in­to the shim­me­ring gla­re. The air was wind­less and it was very hot. "Are you su­re?"</p>
   <p>    "Oh, I am. The mi­ton shar­pens all sen­ses." She shrank back, ter­ror blanc­hing her fa­ce. "It's a se­arch-party co­me lo­oking for me, and they are he­ading for the eas­tern sho­re."</p>
   <p>    "By the Flo­wer!" Im­mu grow­led. "They ha­ve cut us off. If we had only ar­ri­ved so­oner."</p>
   <p>    "They must not ta­ke me! Is the­re no ot­her way down?"</p>
   <p>    Immu scre­wed her fa­ce in­to a scowl as she tho­ught. "Down down down. I know only the one way." But then her exp­res­si­on chan­ged, and she se­ized the girl by the sho­ul­der with one small ta­lo­ned hand, whi­le the ot­her po­in­ted over the si­de of the bo­at. "But <emphasis>they</emphasis> might know anot­her."</p>
   <p>    "The ri­mo­riks?" Ani­gel whis­pe­red.</p>
   <p>    "Try them," Im­mu snap­ped.</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess le­aned over the gun­wa­le. The tra­ces of the har­ness that the wa­ter-cre­atu­res wo­re had be­en gre­atly lengt­he­ned for la­ke tra­vel, and the wa­ter he­re was de­ep. The ri­mo­riks we­re out of sight, se­eking co­ol­ness.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>My fri­ends. I ha­ve a most Im­por­tant thing to ask you.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    First one dark sha­pe ap­pe­ared, then anot­her. The two sle­ek gre­en-spot­ted he­ads lif­ted out of the wa­ter with hardly a rip­ple and the ani­mals ba­red the­ir fangs in a man­ner that Ani­gel had on­ce tho­ught fe­ro­ci­o­us, but now knew to be the­ir fas­hi­on of smi­ling.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Human fri­end, ask yo­ur qu­es­ti­on.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Do you know whe­re we are now?</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Certainly. On the brink of the Gre­at Whi­te Fal­ling Wa­ter. Do you ha­ve any ot­her qu­es­ti­ons?</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Is the­re a way down? In­to the Gre­at Mu­tar Ri­ver ?</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Yes. The­re is a way from the Wi­de Flat Wa­ter in­to the Wa­ter Flo­wing to the Sea.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Immu!" the Prin­cess cri­ed. "They say the­re is a way!"</p>
   <p>    "Ask them if they can ta­ke us." Im­mu's vo­ice was stra­ined, harsh.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Can you ta­ke us down the­re in the bo­at?</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>If you wish it.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>There are evil hu­mans on ot­her bo­ats ro­und abo­ut the is­land over the­re. Can you ta­ke us so that they can't catch us?</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Oh, yes. Do you wish to go now? If so, we must first sha­re mi­ton.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "They say yes!" Ani­gel exc­la­imed, ra­di­ant with joy. "They want to know if we'd li­ke to go now! Oh, it's won­der­ful. What sho­uld I tell them, Im­mu?"</p>
   <p>    The Od­dling wo­man's gre­at yel­low eyes blin­ked slowly. Her ga­ze was fi­xed on that of the hu­man whom she lo­ved, se­e­ing the on­ce de­li­ca­te skin now sun­bur­ned and in­sect-bit­ten, the ha­ir that used to be com­pa­red to spun gold now tur­ned to frowsy straw, the blue eyes, on­ce brim­ming with fe­ar, now eagerly ag­lit­ter…</p>
   <p>    "My swe­et child, of co­ur­se you must tell them to ta­ke us." Ha­ving spo­ken, Im­mu calmly set abo­ut re­pac­king the fo­od, then ti­ed the­ir two packs by the cords to one of the punt thwarts.</p>
   <p>    Anigel had ta­ken the mi­ton go­urd from her belt-wal­let. Sip­ping first, she then sha­red the li­qu­id with the ri­mo­riks. "Now we are re­ady. Ta­ke yo­ur pla­ce, Im­mu."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess re­tur­ned to the dri­ver's thwart in the bows of the punt and to­ok up the re­ins, wrap­ping the le­at­her straps on­ce abo­ut each well-cal­lo­used hand to ke­ep a go­od grip. Her mind cal­led out:</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>My fri­ends, let's go!</emphasis></p>
   <p>    The two po­wer­ful be­asts sub­mer­ged, thrust for­ward with the­ir cla­wed flip­pers, and ha­uled the long slim bo­at out of its hi­ding pla­ce and in­to the open la­ke. Tra­cing a long cur­ved path, swim­ming with all the­ir pro­di­gi­o­us strength, they tur­ned so­uth - he­ading stra­ight thro­ugh the Fangs of Mu­nj­uno to­ward the brink of the hu­ge wa­ter­fall.</p>
   <p>    Leaning on the sto­ne ra­il, Prin­ce An­tar watc­hed his knights and the men-at-arms di­sem­bark from the punts and be­gin to spre­ad out along the skid-ro­ad. He and the Blue Vo­ice and the lim­ping Sir Pe­na­pat had ta­ken up a po­si­ti­on in the lof­ti­est struc­tu­re of Tass Town, a light­ho­use abo­ut fif­te­en ells high on the wes­tern si­de of the small is­land set­tle­ment.</p>
   <p>    The Prin­ce and the knight strip­ped to tu­nic and bus­kins be­ca­use of the he­at, and sur­ve­yed the sce­ne from the outer pa­ra­pet of the light­ho­use, whi­le the skinny Blue Vo­ice was not only ro­bed but ho­oded, se­ated upon a sto­ol next to the gre­at un­lit lamp whi­le his far­se­e­ing mind's eye fol­lo­wed the dep­loy­ment of the for­ces on sho­re.</p>
   <p>    "I wo­uldn't li­ke to li­ve he­re," Pe­na­pat sa­id.</p>
   <p>    "Why not, Pe­ni?" An­tar was idly scan­ning the ro­ofs be­low, from which only a few thre­ads of smo­ke aro­se. Lord Zon­til had told him that most of the po­pu­la­ti­on sa­ve for the log-raft sa­ilors aban­do­ned Tass Town du­ring the ra­iny se­asons. The war had simply star­ted the exo­dus so­oner.</p>
   <p>    "Too no­isy," the big man sta­ted. "The wa­ter­fall. Hurts my te­eth."</p>
   <p>    "Your <emphasis>te­eth</emphasis> -"</p>
   <p>    "Can't you fe­el it? A so­und that's so de­ep it's hardly a no­ise at all. It co­mes up thro­ugh the rock and ma­kes the who­le light­ho­use sha­ke, and my body too, and hurts my te­eth."</p>
   <p>    Antar be­gan to la­ugh - and then he sud­denly cut short, ha­ving ca­ught a glimp­se of so­met­hing out on the wa­ter. "My God!" he bre­at­hed. "Pe­ni, will you lo­ok out the­re? Do you see what I see?"</p>
   <p>    "A lit­tle bo­at," Pe­na­pat af­fir­med. The big man's exp­res­si­on was swe­etly qu­iz­zi­cal. "It sho­uldn't be go­ing be­yond tho­se rocks. The tra­der sa­id the­re's a strong cur­rent out the­re, that'll ta­ke you over the falls."</p>
   <p>    "Blue!" ro­ared the Prin­ce. "Get out he­re, qu­ickly!"</p>
   <p>    The Blue Vo­ice ro­se with evi­dent re­luc­tan­ce, only to be drag­ged un­ce­re­mo­ni­o­usly to the light­ho­use ra­il by An­tar, who po­in­ted out the vag­rant punt.</p>
   <p>    "That bo­at! Who's in it?" An­tar de­man­ded.</p>
   <p>    The Blue Vo­ice pur­sed his lips. "You ro­used me from my tran­ce, Prin­ce. That's a most dan­ge­ro­us thing to do - "</p>
   <p>    Antar's hand, which was very strong, tigh­te­ned on the scrawny blue-clad bi­cep. "The bo­at, you wor­ram-scat! Qu­ickly!"</p>
   <p>    The cla­ir­vo­yant's eye-soc­kets we­re ab­ruptly black and empty. His thin lips tremb­led. "My Lord - I-<emphasis>I can't tell who ri­des wit­hin</emphasis>."</p>
   <p>    "Anigel!" the Prin­ce cri­ed. "It's the Prin­cess!"</p>
   <p>    The punt, mo­ving with as­to­nis­hing spe­ed, was now well be­yond the Fangs. The­re we­re two small fi­gu­res in it, one far for­ward and stiffly up­right, the ot­her hud­dled amids­hips. A light bre­eze had sprung up, waf­ting away the mist that cur­ta­ined the lip of the ca­ta­ract. It co­uld now be se­en cle­arly from the light­ho­use, a ne­arly stra­ight li­ne of blue-black, frin­ged at the fa­tal ed­ge with whi­te. Be­yond it was a vo­id of sky and dis­tant, ha­ze-shro­uded tre­es.</p>
   <p>    As An­tar watc­hed, the ra­cing punt se­emed for a mo­ment to be pre­ce­ded by two dark forms arc­hing thro­ugh the spu­me at the brink. Then the slen­der ves­sel ho­ve­red for an ins­tant, its front half in thin air, its stern still sup­por­ted by wa­ter, be­fo­re it til­ted and slid out of sight.</p>

   <p>    The lam­mer­ge­i­er flew ti­re­les­sly over the pe­aks and ice­fi­elds of the high Oho­gans, so high that Har-amis fo­und the cle­ar thin air dif­fi­cult to bre­at­he. She be­ca­me drowsy not long af­ter the hu­ge bird left Mo­vis, and was con­tent to snug­gle down wit­hin her thick fur clo­ak, shel­te­red de­ep in the fe­at­he­red hol­low bet­we­en the lam­mer­ge­i­er's wings, and sle­ep.</p>
   <p>    She was una­wa­re of the­ir pas­sa­ge over Mo­unt Ro­to­lo and the slow ap­pro­ach to to­we­ring Mo­unt Gid­ris, which was ensh­ro­uded in thick clo­uds. The lam­mer­ge­i­er bre­as­ted strong winds for ho­ur af­ter ho­ur, but by night­fall it still had not re­ac­hed its go­al.</p>
   <p>    Haramis wo­ke when it be­gan to des­cend thro­ugh thickly fal­ling snow. As the Vis­pi had ta­ught her, she first bro­ught to mind a cle­ar pic­tu­re of the cre­atu­re's stri­king black-and-whi­te cres­ted vi­sa­ge, with the glit­te­ring eyes li­ke po­lis­hed jet and a gre­at be­ak ed­ged with sharp te­eth. Then her mind spo­ke its na­me: <emphasis>Hi­lu­ro</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>I he­ar, Ha­ra­mis.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    She he­ard its reply in a pla­ce in her mind that Ma­gi­ra had pa­ti­ently ta­ught her to use. Ha­ra­mis had fo­und le­ar­ning the spe­ech wit­ho­ut words a stran­ge ex­pe­ri­en­ce; her first at­tempts had be­en comp­le­te fa­ilu­res. Then, al­most by ac­ci­dent, she had ma­na­ged to bes­pe­ak Ma­gi­ra. Af­ter se­ve­ral mo­re se­mi-acci­den­tal suc­ces­ses, she had wor­ked out what she was do­ing, and af­ter that the pro­cess was simp­le, al­most auto­ma­tic. One simply ren­de­red this part of the mind "open" af­ter first cal­ling out men­tal­ly to the de­si­red per­son. Af­ter Ha­ra­mis had le­ar­ned to bes­pe­ak re­li­ably, Ma­gi­ra int­ro­du­ced her to the lam­mer­ge­i­er who wo­uld be­co­me both mo­unt and com­pa­ni­on in the next sta­ge of her qu­est.</p>
   <p>    The gre­at bird had gli­ded down and lan­ded on the sla­te ro­of at Ma­gi­ra's sum­mo­ning. Its wings­pan was as wi­de as the ho­use, and its gi­gan­tic black-ta­lo­ned fe­et co­uld ha­ve se­ized a full-grown man in ar­mor with the ease of a night-ca­ro­ler snatc­hing a tree-vart. But for all its fe­ro­ci­o­us de­me­ano­ur, the co­los­sal flyer had gre­eted Ma­gi­ra with gre­at­he­ar­ted af­fec­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>I tell you now one of the gre­at sec­rets of the mo­un­ta­in Folk</emphasis>, Ma­gi­ra had sa­id to the Prin­cess, stro­king the lo­we­red he­ad of the bird. <emphasis>You know that we we­re ma­de for lands all girt abo­ut with ice and snow</emphasis>-<emphasis>but so we­re the­se gre­at cre­atu­res. When the Va­nis­hed Ones re­fas­hi­oned the abo­mi­nab­le flesh of the Fo­un­da­ti­on Stock in­to the First Folk, they en­gen­de­red at the sa­me ti­me the vo­or, which you hu­mans call lam­mer­ge­i­ers, from a les­ser sort of bird. Folk and vo­or we­re thus new­born upon the world to­get­her, sin­ce the Va­nis­hed Ones knew we Vis­pi wo­uld ne­ed hel­pers in or­der to mo­ve abo­ut over a world loc­ked fast in ice. Our towns are few and wi­dely se­pa­ra­ted, but with the help of our gre­at fri­ends, we jo­ur­ney over the long dis­tan­ces in sa­fety. As you shall, in ful­fil­ling yo­ur qu­est</emphasis>…</p>
   <p>    The lam­mer­ge­i­er, lan­ding with con­fi­den­ce in spi­te of the blo­wing snow, pec­ked with its gre­at be­ak at the whi­te fro­zen cliff-fa­ce, whe­re­upon the ice crac­ked and re­ve­aled a dark ope­ning.</p>
   <p>    "Is this the pla­ce whe­re my Three-Win­ged Circ­le is hid­den?" Ha­ra­mis as­ked.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>No. This is shel­ter for the night. We both ne­ed fo­od and rest, and you will be sa­fe he­re whi­le I hunt. I shall re­turn so­on</emphasis>. Hi­lu­ro lof­ted back in­to the sky.</p>
   <p>    Haramis drew out her Black Tril­li­um amu­let from her bo­di­ce. It glo­wed li­ke a lan­tern, cas­ting light ahe­ad as she step­ped over bro­ken bits of ice in­to the ca­vern.</p>
   <p>    It was a hu­ge pla­ce, mostly dry, alt­ho­ugh the wind swept flur­ri­es of snow in af­ter her. Se­ve­ral tumb­led blocks of dark sto­ne all shot thro­ugh with thick ve­ins of whi­te qu­artz ming­led with anot­her ma­te­ri­al ref­lec­ted back the amu­let's warm glow. Ha­ra­mis re­ali­zed she was lo­oking at a lo­de of gold.</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess left her pack and wan­de­red for so­me ti­me by the light of her amu­let, fin­ding outc­rop­pings of gold everyw­he­re, and so­me­ti­mes gre­at nug­gets lying on the flo­or.</p>
   <p>    But it was far at the back of the ca­vern that she ma­de her most in­te­res­ting dis­co­very.</p>
   <p>    Within a ro­ugh al­co­ve, the amu­let's gol­den light had flic­ke­red on so­met­hing very dark and shiny, and when she ap­pro­ac­hed she fo­und a wall of per­fectly smo­oth black ice, in which she saw her­self, hol­ding the glo­wing amu­let.</p>
   <p>    An ice mir­ror…</p>
   <p>    And was it not so­me such thing that the sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus was ru­mo­red to use for scrying?</p>
   <p>    She as­ked the qu­es­ti­on of her ima­ge wit­hin the dark ice, a tall and be­a­uti­ful yo­ung wo­man who­se pa­le fa­ce, fra­med in black ha­ir, was ha­lo­ed in the whi­te fur of her mant­le's ho­od. The glo­wing amu­let at her thro­at had a ref­lec­ti­ve ra­di­an­ce that drew back her eyes whe­ne­ver she wo­uld lo­ok away.</p>
   <p>    She sta­red at the amu­let's gol­den glow, and it se­emed that her vi­si­on swam, and the ima­ge of her­self be­ca­me that of anot­her: a man, at­ti­red in stran­ge ro­bes and crow­ned with a he­ad­pi­ece li­ke a gre­at sil­ver star. He smi­led at her and held out his hand, of­fe­ring to show her his sec­rets, to sha­re his know­led­ge, his ma­gic…</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Haramis</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Orogastus," she whis­pe­red, pet­ri­fi­ed with sud­den re­cog­ni­ti­on. He se­emed to re­ach out to her, thro­ugh the mir­ror of black ice -</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Haramis!</emphasis></p>
   <p>    The men­tal call was in­hu­man, fa­mi­li­ar, ur­gent.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Hiluro?</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Haramis, co­me back. Now!</emphasis></p>
   <p>    She saw her own fa­ce aga­in ref­lec­ted in the she­et of ice. Chil­led to the bo­ne, she tur­ned and hur­ri­ed back to re­as­su­re Hi­lu­ro, who­se cal­ling of her na­me by the spe­ech wit­ho­ut words still re­so­un­ded in her he­ad, dri­ving away all ot­her tho­ughts.</p>

   <p>    Jagun ma­de no at­tempt to start a fi­re. Ins­te­ad he sto­od with his hands han­ging by his si­de. He might ha­ve be­en one who had co­me to the end of a tra­il to find not­hing but a wall over which the­re was no clim­bing. Ka­di­ya watc­hed him une­asily. This was a Jagun she had ne­ver se­en be­fo­re.</p>
   <p>    She was abo­ut to ask him what was the mat­ter when he tur­ned qu­ickly and cla­wed and fo­ught his way up to her, to the top of that bowl-li­ke ope­ning. Slowly he pa­ced aro­und the bro­ad rim, but he did not lo­ok down at the path his fe­et fol­lo­wed; ins­te­ad his he­ad was up, tur­ning slowly from si­de to si­de, his ten­se body exp­res­sing the ne­ed to he­ar, to see, to know. When he comp­le­ted the circ­le he ca­me back to her and she as­ked:</p>
   <p>    "What is it, Jagun?"</p>
   <p>    For a mo­ment she tho­ught he wo­uld not ans­wer. The he ra­ised his he­ad to fa­ce her squ­arely.</p>
   <p>    "Farseer, for us all the­re are hid­den things. This is a stran­ge land, as much so to me as to you. But I think we co­me now to an even stran­ger one."</p>
   <p>    "There is so­met­hing to be fe­ared?" she de­man­ded.</p>
   <p>    "I do not know." Now he drew his bag to him and rum­ma­ged qu­ickly in it, brin­ging out fo­od - so­me dry ca­kes and two small smo­ked fish so brit­tle that they bro­ke when to­uc­hed. Aga­in Ka­di­ya won­de­red over the lack of fi­re but so­me ca­uti­on kept her from as­king. Tho­ugh night in this wa­ter-log­ged co­untry was apt to be dank she did not fe­el that chill now. Rat­her it was as if the bowl still held abo­ut them a lit­tle of the sun's he­at.</p>
   <p>    The full bur­den of the day set­tled upon her. Alt­ho­ugh tho­ught abo­ut the lar­vae and tho­se po­iso­no­us balls they had pas­sed flit­ted thro­ugh the sud­den des­cent of fa­ti­gue, she co­uld not ra­ise energy to sug­gest gu­ard duty. The sen­sa­ti­on of sa­fety which had clo­sed abo­ut her when she had first clim­bed up he­re was li­ke a warm ro­be pro­mi­sing sle­ep wit­ho­ut fe­ar.</p>
   <p>    Did she sle­ep or did she wa­ke? She co­uld not ha­ve truth­ful­ly sworn to eit­her. As the night dar­ke­ned and drifts of mist flo­ated over the­ir he­ads from one si­de of the bowl to the ot­her, she lay qu­i­etly.</p>
   <p>    Their ro­ot-gu­ide she had set up by her he­ad, butt in drift of so­il, black tip up. The­re was no fla­me from that. Ho­we­ver, it was not comp­le­tely dark af­ter all. She was first awa­re of a shim­mer which she co­uld catch only in the cor­ners of her eyes. If she shif­ted qu­ickly to vi­ew it, it di­sap­pe­ared, or se­emed to mo­ve eno­ugh out of sight to re­ma­in only a sug­ges­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    So it went for a ti­me. Then tho­se shim­mers ro­oted them­sel­ves. They we­re at le­ast as tall as Jagun, thin pil­lars in which swir­led fa­int co­lors, so pal­lid that one hue might hardly be dis­tin­gu­is­hed from anot­her.</p>
   <p>    At first they only sto­od still, not in any pat­tern Ka­di­ya co­uld dis­cern; then they wa­ve­red and flo­ated free. She co­uld not un­ders­tand why they mo­ved so, but she was su­re they we­re we­aving an int­ri­ca­te pat­tern whe­re­of she and Jagun we­re the he­art. Yet no fe­ar stir­red in her. Fi­nal­ly she did not see the pil­lars any­mo­re, ex­cept as a whir­ling mist which spun slowly abo­ut the op­po­si­te slo­pe of the bowl.</p>
   <p>    The mist glo­wed, and wit­hin it she saw a be­a­uti­ful city-the sa­me city she had dre­amt of be­fo­re re­ac­hing Noth! It se­emed al­so that she had on­ce known that city and fo­und hap­pi­ness and con­tent­ment the­re, and she wan­ted not­hing mo­re than to go se­eking it.</p>
   <p>    Somewhere the­re was sin­ging, a mu­sic dif­fe­rent from any that a Ru­wen­di­an bard co­uld draw from a harp, ra­ising in Ka­di­ya a new lon­ging. And then the vi­si­on di­sap­pe­ared.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya sat up, sud­denly chil­led, her hands go­ing to her amu­let. That fe­eling of be­ing gu­ar­ded and com­for­ted was go­ne. Ins­te­ad she had a sud­den vi­vid men­tal glimp­se of the di­se­ased land thro­ugh which they had co­me to this pla­ce… and then she re­ali­zed that it was early mor­ning.</p>
   <p>    There was mo­ve­ment ne­arby. Jagun sto­od re­ady for the tra­il, bec­ko­ning to her, that stran­ge ble­ak lo­ok still on his fa­ce. Ka­di­ya aro­se, to­ok up the ro­ot, sho­ul­de­red her bag, and pre­pa­red to set off on­ce aga­in. The two way­fa­rers lo­oked down and away from the gre­at mo­und which enc­lo­sed the bowl. Swamp mist swir­led abo­ut, and the­re se­emed to be no sign of a ri­sing sun to burn it away. In Ka­di­ya's hand the tril­li­um-ro­ot ca­me to li­fe, slip­ped easily thro­ugh her fin­gers and star­ted to gli­de down­hill on the slo­pe op­po­si­te that which they had yes­ter­day clim­bed.</p>
   <p>    "We go." Jagun's vo­ice held as lit­tle exp­res­si­on as his fa­ce and he sa­id not­hing of fo­od - rat­her po­in­ted on to­ward mo­re of the tall thorn-ferns and the bul­bo­us hor­rors which had ta­ken ro­ot among them. They trud­ged on, slo­wing as they wo­ve a zig-zag path to avo­id the po­iso­no­us balls.</p>
   <p>    After a ti­me they ca­me to an open spa­ce car­pe­ted with a furry yel­low scum. The­re we­re no tre­es he­re, only a se­ri­es of co­lum­nar pro­j­ec­ti­ons, al­most li­ke mi­ni­atu­re clay to­wers, le­ading out in­to what lo­oked li­ke a cle­ared and le­ve­led fi­eld stretc­hing ahe­ad of them. But Jagun war­ned her that it was a qu­ick­mi­re. A sing­le mis­step he­re and one wo­uld be swal­lo­wed fo­re­ver.</p>
   <p>    Jagun del­ved in­to his hun­ter's bag and drew out a pac­ket. Fre­ed of its ti­es, it pro­ved to be fo­ur dish-li­ke ovals. On­ce re­le­ased from the­ir fas­te­nings the ovals ope­ned, to­ok on thick­ness in the hu­mid air, and be­ca­me bo­at-sha­ped le­aves cur­ling up abo­ut the­ir outer ed­ges. Skim­mers, the hun­ters cal­led them.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya had used the­se be­fo­re, al­ways ca­uti­o­usly, and only when she was with Jagun. Se­ating her­self on a ro­un­ded outc­rop she ma­de fast the las­hings of the skim­mers aro­und her ank­les. She stam­ped to test the tight­ness of the cor­ding be­fo­re she star­ted ca­re­ful­ly af­ter Jagun, ma­king su­re she fol­lo­wed his path. The ro­ot-gu­ide had al­re­ady slip­ped out ahe­ad of him upon that tre­ac­he­ro­us gro­und. Un­der her fe­et Ka­di­ya was awa­re of the gi­ve in the sur­fa­ce, and the­ir pa­ce was now swift. Al­ways flan­king them we­re the lumpy co­lumns, tal­ler than eit­her she or Jagun.</p>
   <p>    The mist swir­led so thickly now that she ca­ught only a very hazy glimp­se of the sho­re of the Thorny Hell from which they had set out. So­me­ti­mes even the stubby pil­lars we­re ne­arly blot­ted out. As they went on, she be­ca­me awa­re that the fo­oting be­ca­me ste­adily mo­re se­cu­re. Then sud­denly a lar­ge ve­il of mist ho­ve­red as if it had be­en ca­ught on so­met­hing, and then fre­ed it­self, and drif­ted away.</p>
   <p>    The last of the pil­lars was re­ve­aled. Only it was not a pil­lar. Chunks of mud as hard as if ba­ked had sca­led away, and what sto­od the­re was un­mis­ta­kenly a fi­gu­re - tho­ugh cer­ta­inly no monst­ro­us one.</p>
   <p>    It had be­en ma­de to rep­re­sent no Od­dling. The pro­por­ti­ons we­re as hu­man as her own, alt­ho­ugh the ima­ge was mas­cu­li­ne. Sa­ve for an ela­bo­ra­te crown-helm and three scar­ves or belts the sta­tue wo­re no clot­hing. The belts we­re drawn one over each sho­ul­der, cros­sing on the bre­ast and en­ding in a wi­de wa­ist belt latc­hed to­get­her. The body it­self was of an ivory sha­de and pos­ses­sed a she­en as if highly po­lis­hed. Scar­ves and belt we­re co­ve­red by small fla­kes or sca­les, gre­en, gold, blue, sha­ded from the pa­lest to the dar­kest in each hue.</p>
   <p>    It was what was grip­ped in the ima­ge's outst­retc­hed hands which drew and held the­ir eyes.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya had se­en gre­at sa­va­gery in the days just past. But the se­ve­red he­ad that the fi­gu­re held was so fo­re­ign to the fe­eling that the rest of the sta­tue aro­used that it start­led and sic­ke­ned her. For that was the he­ad of no Skri­tek nor Od­dling. In spi­te of the fact that it was ut­terly ha­ir­less and the ro­un­ded skull bul­ged over­much, it might ha­ve be­en the he­ad of a man of her own kind!</p>
   <p>    She mo­ved a lit­tle away, the bet­ter to see the fa­ce of the sta­tue, ex­pec­ting so­me­how to wit­ness the­re a fi­er­ce co­un­te­nan­ce such as the La­bor­no­ki had worn when they dab­bled in hor­rors at the Ci­ta­del.</p>
   <p>    But the fa­ce overs­ha­do­wed by the ela­bo­ra­te helm was calm, full of strength and se­re­nity. The ima­ge might ha­ve be­en fas­hi­oned as a di­re war­ning, or a mo­nu­ment to so­me vic­tory; but the lon­ger Ka­di­ya lo­oked at tho­se eyes-which sta­red to her right, as the he­ad was slightly tur­ned - the mo­re she was su­re that what she saw sig­ni­fi­ed so­me an­ci­ent jus­ti­ce, in­ten­ded to stand as a war­ning for all ti­me.</p>
   <p>    The eyes them­sel­ves we­re not blank car­ving. Ins­te­ad the hol­lows we­re in­set with dark sto­nes and in each, even as in the he­art of the Black Tril­li­um flo­wer, the­re was a hint of gold.</p>
   <p>    "The sin­do­na!" Jagun sprang back a lit­tle from the sta­tue. "This is the For­bid­den Way!" He wo­re an exp­res­si­on of awe which held mo­re than a tin­ge of fe­ar.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya's eyes did not le­ave tho­se of the fi­gu­re. "Who?"</p>
   <p>    Jagun did not ans­wer her. Ins­te­ad he sto­oped and ca­ught up one of the shards of ba­ked mud which had pla­inly be­en scra­ped from the fi­gu­re.</p>
   <p>    "This was do­ne not long ago. But -not by the Skri­tek. They wo­uld not lay claw to this! Then who?"</p>
   <p>    "Please, what do­es this sta­tue rep­re­sent?" Ka­di­ya ra­ised her vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    Jagun blin­ked. "Sen­ti­nels of the Va­nis­hed Ones - they who co­uld com­mand the earth and wa­ter…" His words tra­iled off as he ca­ught Ka­di­ya's arm.</p>
   <p>    "Look!"</p>
   <p>    Resting on a ne­arby chunk of the hard mud lay the tril­li­um-ro­ot. Its small cand­le was af­la­me, po­in­ting not in the di­rec­ti­on they had be­en tra­ve­ling but that in which the fi­gu­re was lo­oking. Jagun sank the butt of his spe­ar in­to the yel­low muck. It pe­net­ra­ted for abo­ut a fin­ger's length and then met re­sis­tan­ce, tho­ugh the sur­fa­ce lo­oked no dif­fe­rent from the mo­rass they had trans­ver­sed so ca­re­ful­ly. Ka­di­ya watc­hed as the hun­ter mo­ved on, tap­ping the end of the spe­ar be­fo­re him. The ro­ot wa­ve­red back and forth as if it wan­ted to ta­ke the path Jagun fol­lo­wed, but wo­uld not le­ave Ka­di­ya be­hind.</p>
   <p>    Magic - all ma­gic! Her old im­pa­ti­en­ce fla­red. But so far the gu­ide had not pla­yed them fal­se. Tho­ugh she in­wardly shrank, the Prin­cess stro­de be­hind the hun­ter in this new di­rec­ti­on. The skim­mer-le­aves sank a frac­ti­on un­der her we­ight but no mo­re, and the ro­ot ra­ced ahe­ad as might a ho­und un­le­as­hed.</p>
   <p>    At length the yel­low mo­rass was bro­ken he­re and the­re by what might on­ce ha­ve be­en pa­ve­ment. They ca­me thro­ugh the last of the thin­ning mist to a pla­ce co­ve­red with cle­an, co­ar­se turf such as grew in the pol­ders to the nort­he­ast. The­re was a strag­gle of ot­her ve­ge­ta­ti­on and Ka­di­ya ga­ined smar­ting thorn scratc­hes as she to­ok the tril­li­um-ro­ot in­to her hand.</p>
   <p>    Her back and legs ac­hed with a ste­ady pa­in, for she had un­cons­ci­o­usly ten­sed her body thro­ugh all the­ir jo­ur­ney over the mo­rass. Now she stumb­led twi­ce and then went to her kne­es. Jagun was be­si­de her at on­ce, wa­ter-bot­tle in hand. Ka­di­ya gul­ped gra­te­ful­ly and then sank down to rest among the tus­socks of grass. In less than a mi­nu­te she was as­le­ep.</p>
   <p>    Light shi­ning in her eyes awo­ke her and she sta­red up at the open sky, be­wil­de­red. She had dre­amt she was in her own cham­ber in the la­di­es' to­wer of the Ci­ta­del. But the­re was no car­ven ro­of abo­ve her. She sat up and gro­aned at the stif­fness in her back.</p>
   <p>    Trees sur­ro­un­ded the tur­fed area whe­re she lay. The­ir smo­oth trunks we­re gre­enish bron­ze and the­ir gre­en-edged, blu­ish le­aves rust­led at the tug of a bre­eze. She was alo­ne, tho­ugh Jagun's pack lay in sight. A bla­bat bird perc­hed on an arc­hed stem of bramb­le, snatc­hing at a bright red berry. It pa­id no at­ten­ti­on as Ka­di­ya got to her fe­et and stretc­hed. The tril­li­um-ro­ot was plan­ted stem-up ne­ar whe­re her he­ad had la­in and it was qu­ive­ring.</p>
   <p>    "Na… na… na…"</p>
   <p>    That so­und the girl re­cog­ni­zed at on­ce. The Nysso­mu we­re ne­ver lo­ud or free of spe­ech, but they so­me­ti­mes vo­iced a cro­on of con­tent. Jagun ro­un­ded a big bramb­le bush, car­rying in one hand a vi­ne from which hung so­me oval scar­let fru­it, swol­len ne­ar to the burs­ting po­int with ri­pe­ness.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya ne­arly swal­lo­wed the first fru­it who­le, and had a se­cond re­ady to eat be­fo­re she was ab­le to ask a qu­es­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "Where are we?"</p>
   <p>    Jagun was ca­re­ful­ly pe­eling mo­re of his spo­il, a long length of swe­et-ca­ne. He shrug­ged, in­di­ca­ting that he did not know. The girl was so used to cre­di­ting him with all Mi­re know­led­ge that she co­uld not be­li­eve they we­re lost. He che­wed a bit of ca­ne co­re and then spit out the pith which had be­en dra­ined of its su­gary ju­ice.</p>
   <p>    "We are be­yond all tra­ils I know, Far­se­er. I know only that the­re is sto­ne un­der this." He thum­ped the turf with the end of the ca­ne. "And that," he nod­ded to the ups­tan­ding ro­ot-gu­ide, "has bro­ught us he­re."</p>
   <p>    "More ru­ins."</p>
   <p>    Laying asi­de his pi­ece of ca­ne, Jagun ca­re­ful­ly used his kni­fe, le­ve­ring up a patch of sod. Be­ne­ath was in­de­ed a dark-sta­ined sto­ne sur­fa­ce. "A ro­ad­way. That is what this is." He ges­tu­red ahe­ad, whe­re the­re was an ope­ning in the tre­es.</p>
   <p>    "A ro­ad ma­de by the sin­do­na?"</p>
   <p>    Jagun lo­oked away from her. Ins­te­ad he sta­red at the ho­le he had dug as if the un­co­ve­ring had be­en a mis­ta­ke.</p>
   <p>    He spo­ke he­si­ta­tingly with pa­uses bet­we­en his words, as if the in-for­ma­ti­on ca­me from him un­wil­lingly. "The Va­nis­hed Ones -and with them, the­ir sen­ti­nels, the sin­do­na - on­ce ru­led the wa­ter and the is­les. We we­re of the­ir ma­king, fas­hi­oned by the­ir minds and the­ir hands. The Dark Po­wers aro­se and the­re was de­ath in the land. But be­fo­re the an­ci­ent ones left they cal­led us forth and told us that we we­re free. Only cer­ta­in oaths they as­ked of us…"</p>
   <p>    Jagun lo­oked down at the kni­fe in his hands, tur­ning it over and over.</p>
   <p>    "The sin­do­na re­ma­in to watch over what was left by the Va­nis­hed Ones. The­re we­re cer­ta­in things -and cer­ta­in know­led­ge which they co­uld not ta­ke away with them, nor we­re they ab­le to dest­roy it. This ro­ad­way" - he wa­ved to the rows of clay-co­ve­red sen­ti­nels - "le­ads to one such gu­ar­ded pla­ce."</p>
   <p>    He drop­ped the sod he had dug up back in­to its ho­le. "King's Da­ugh­ter, yo­ur Fat­her had Oat­hed Com­pa­ni­ons who ser­ved him even un­to de­ath. Tho­ugh we Folk owe al­le­gi­an­ce el­sew­he­re, our oaths bind us as fast. But Far­se­er, I ha­ve now bro­ken that vow! Yon­der, thro­ugh tho­se tre­es, li­es the For­bid­den Way. Last night I sent forth the Gre­at Call. The­re was no ans­wer. I co­uld not link with any sco­ut of the Folk. We ha­ve co­me past the bar­ri­er set up for my own ra­ce. That go­es" - he po­in­ted to the ro­ot with his kni­fe - "and you must fol­low. I do not know if I will be ab­le to ac­com­pany you. I tho­ught we we­re go­ing to the Uis­gu, but ins­te­ad we are he­re. And so­me­one un­co­ve­red the Cap­ta­in of the Sent­ri­es - La­ma­ril, the gre­at one not even the Skri­tek wo­uld da­re to front… No, I had no ans­wer to my call. But yon­der" - aga­in he wa­ved the ba­red ste­el, and even un­der the fa­int sun it ga­ve off an omi­no­us glint - "the­re was a fi­re in the night. Off in tho­se tre­es, along the For­bid­den Way."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya was start­led. "I slept…"</p>
   <p>    For the first ti­me Jagun lo­oked less grim. "Far­se­er, you slept part of a day, and all the night which fol­lo­wed. This is the se­cond day."</p>
   <p>    She frow­ned. "You sho­uld ha­ve awa­ke­ned me."</p>
   <p>    "Not so. What li­es be­fo­re us I do not know, sa­ve per­haps it may be gre­ater pe­ril than we ha­ve yet fa­ced. Any hun­ter wo­uld cho­ose fron­ting a Skri­tek over tra­ve­ling the For­bid­den Way. You ne­ed to fa­ce the fu­tu­re with all pos­sib­le strength of mind and body, and so I let you sle­ep."</p>
   <p>    "This fi­re you saw…"</p>
   <p>    Jagun lo­oked grim. "The fi­res our pe­op­le use are small. What I saw was gre­at. To fe­ed it must ha­ve be­en a task for many hands."</p>
   <p>    "Voltrik's men?"</p>
   <p>    "If so they awa­it whe­re that," he ges­tu­red to the ro­ot, "wo­uld le­ad us." The two of them wal­ked on in si­len­ce, but it was cle­ar that Jagun was be­co­ming mo­re and mo­re agi­ta­ted.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya was al­so un­ner­ved. She was al­most re­ady to snap the lit­tle gu­ide in two. Only she co­uld not dest­roy it. She was ens­na­red by the Arc­hi­ma­ge's ma­gic and her qu­est for the ta­lis­man, the myste­ri­o­us Three-Lo­bed Bur­ning Eye, and she co­uld not ga­in­say it.</p>
   <p>    Suddenly Jagun ga­ve a lo­ud cry and re­ac­hed for his hun­ter's bag. From it he snatc­hed a gol­den arm­let in­set with red sto­nes. Only twi­ce had Ka­di­ya se­en such a thing be­fo­re: first when he had co­me to the Ci­ta­del to re­ce­ive for­mal gre­eting from her Fat­her; and aga­in at a sing-chant of his pe­op­le when he had worn a si­mi­lar thing on his up­per arm. He must ha­ve ob­ta­ined the sac­red obj­ect at the Nysso­mu vil­la­ge.</p>
   <p>    Now he tur­ned it aro­und in his hands, gro­aning as his fin­gers ca­res­sed its smo­oth sur­fa­ce. Then he gras­ped the arm­let tightly, the stra­ining musc­les of his sho­ul­ders bet­ra­ying the ef­fort he ma­de, his fa­ce a mask of dre­ad.</p>
   <p>    The arm­let snap­ped. Jagun hur­led the pi­eces from him. An eerie warb­ling so­und is­su­ed from his lips. That, too, she had he­ard, al­ways when one of his own clan had di­ed and the raft be­aring the body had be­en po­led away to the sec­ret pla­ce of in­ter­ment.</p>
   <p>    "Jagun?" she ven­tu­red.</p>
   <p>    His fa­ce had stif­fe­ned.</p>
   <p>    Never had she vi­ewed such cold­ness in his exp­res­si­on.</p>
   <p>    "Jagun is de­ad," he told her to­ne­les­sly. "This one is no lon­ger na­med. I am oath bre­aker, cas­toff of Kin, one who can­not Spe­ak and to whom no­ne will Spe­ak aga­in. We go to bre­ak the for­bid­den si­len­ce. The Lady of Noth has the right to wring the li­fe from us."</p>
   <p>    "When we fol­low her own gu­ide?" Ka­di­ya de­man­ded hotly. Did he hold <emphasis>her</emphasis> at fa­ult when it was cer­ta­inly no­ne of her do­ing? Aga­inst her bre­ast the amu­let he­ated. "I am go­ing on!" she cri­ed. But an ins­tant la­ter she stumb­led and ca­ught her ba­lan­ce with an ef­fort. The fe­eling that flo­oded thro­ugh her was so ali­en that she tri­ed to scre­am and fo­und she co­uld not ma­ke a so­und. For that sing­le mo­ment she had a sen­sa­ti­on of such overw­hel­ming fe­ar that it sho­ok her who­le body.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Fear of what</emphasis>? she de­man­ded of her­self. She ca­ught at a ne­arby bush to ste­ady her­self. As ever, fe­ar awo­ke ra­ge in her.</p>
   <p>    Dagger out, she tur­ned aro­und. Ne­ar her Jagun lay on the turf which co­ve­red the an­ci­ent ro­ad­way. His thin fin­gers cla­wed fe­ebly at his chest and he was bre­at­hing in short flut­te­ring gasps.</p>
   <p>    "Jagun!" Ka­di­ya went to her kne­es be­si­de him. His mo­uth ope­ned and a trick­le of mo­is­tu­re oozed from one cor­ner.</p>
   <p>    "Back!" His vo­ice was only a thre­ad of so­und. He threw out his arms in a fran­tic ges­tu­re and stro­ve to pull him­self up­right. "Ta­ke me… back!"</p>
   <p>    Kadiya she­at­hed her dag­ger and to­ok him by the sho­ul­ders. Exer­ting her full strength she pul­led him a full fifty ells along the turf, back from that an­ci­ent ro­ad­way which the ro­ot-gu­ide ur­ged her to fol­low.</p>
   <p>    The ro­ot had hal­ted, but it wa­ve­red as if bec­ko­ning her on. Her own fe­ar was now go­ne as if a do­or had be­en shut. She ca­ught at her amu­let. It was bla­zing with co­lor and warmth, but not as if it we­re gi­ving forth a thre­at. Ins­te­ad, it se­emed to en­co­ura­ge her.</p>
   <p>    Wind aro­se, co­ming at them thro­ugh the tre­es. Jagun co­ug­hed and le­ve­red him­self up to a sit­ting po­si­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "A bar­ri­er- " the hun­ter whe­ezed. "I can­not go that Way." His he­ad dro­oped for­ward. The­re was a blank­ness now on his fa­ce. He fa­ced so­met­hing which was be­yond his po­wer to fight and he had no we­apon left.</p>
   <p>    "Farseer- " The­re was pa­in in his vo­ice. "It is for­bid­den- only you can go on alo­ne. But I swe­ar that if the­re is a way I may co­me to you, I shall dis­co­ver it!"</p>
   <p>    "I - " Now it was her lips which had fro­zen. "Jagun-ta­ke ca­re."</p>
   <p>    His hand went up in a ges­tu­re of re­as­su­ran­ce and en­co­ura­ge­ment. Then he tur­ned and crept away, and af­ter a ti­me got to his fe­et and wa­ved to her. She gu­es­sed that he wo­uld in­de­ed ran­ge wi­de to dis­co­ver whet­her the­re was a way past that which held them apart.</p>
   <p>    There was mo­ve­ment in the grass. The ro­ot was switc­hing back and forth as if exp­res­sing exas­pe­ra­ti­on, bec­ko­ning her on to ac­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    She sho­ul­de­red Jagun's bag and un­wil­lingly and with a lag­ging step she fol­lo­wed her ro­ot-gu­ide for­ward in­to the tre­es. The­re was a na­use­ating whiff of so­met­hing in the wind which now blew ste­adily at her, a stench which was ne­it­her li­ke that of the Skri­tek, nor the bog. Twi­ce she lo­oked back ho­ping to catch sight of Jagun, but he was not to be se­en.</p>
   <p>    However, the­re was so­met­hing ahe­ad, a dull gle­am at the fo­ot of one of the tre­es. She sto­oped to pick up an ar­row, well ma­de, with a shaft and fe­at­he­ring the co­lor of dri­ed blo­od. She had se­en such be­fo­re, yes… and du­ring the si­ege had hel­ped to gat­her all which had not hit marks or shat­te­red aga­inst walls, to rep­le­nish the stocks of arc­hers at the Ci­ta­del. This ar­row was not of the swamp but of the int­ru­ders! How had it co­me he­re? And why did it lay so ba­lan­ced - as if, li­ke her ro­ot, it was a gu­ide?</p>
   <p>    She ne­arly threw it from her and then tho­ught mo­re cle­arly. It to­ok but a mo­ment to rep­la­ce it, with the po­int set in the op­po­si­te di­rec­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    How had the La­bor­no­ki be­en ab­le to pass the bar­ri­er which had de­fe­ated Jagun? Her amu­let must ha­ve be­en the key for her-but Ha­mil's men, what did they carry ex­cept the ste­el they had al­re­ady so fo­ul­ly blo­odi­ed? Was this mo­re of Oro­gas­tus's dark ma­gic?</p>
   <p>    Within a co­up­le of stri­des she ca­me upon the imp­res­si­on of a bo­ot in a wet patch of earth. And be­yond that -Ka­di­ya fo­ught down the ri­se of bi­le in her thro­at as she saw a de­ad Skri­tek lying to one si­de as if the body had be­en kic­ked out of the way. The cre­atu­re bo­re no wo­und that she co­uld see, and the­re was no pud­dling of blo­od.</p>
   <p>    She tur­ned de­ter­mi­nedly away and con­ti­nu­ed on, co­un­ting steps un­der her bre­ath, trying very hard to ke­ep her at­ten­ti­on alert to all which lay abo­ut her. Then a new no­xi­o­us odor fo­uled the air. She lo­oked to the right. An Od­dling, its thick body pelt re­ve­aling it to be Uis­gu, was bo­und to a tree. This ti­me the­re was evi­den­ce of how de­ath had co­me and it had not be­en easy.</p>
   <p>    Not far be­yond the first Uis­gu vic­tim, the­re was furt­her dis­tur­ban­ce of the gro­und, and the smell of fi­re was strong. Bus­hes we­re torn from the gro­und, and the turf was scuf­fed up. The­re she fo­und anot­her tor­tu­red Od­dling. She co­uld not ma­ke her­self lo­ok clo­sely, un­til the­re ca­me a thin cry, and she was for­ced to go to the Uis­gu. A cro­oked hand stro­ve to ri­se, an eye lo­oked at her from a bro­ken fa­ce.</p>
   <p>    Once mo­re Ka­di­ya cal­led upon the bra­ce of an­ger.</p>
   <p>    "Who did this thing?" She he­si­ta­ted - how co­uld she ease such ter­rib­le hurts? She had not­hing…</p>
   <p>    The hand mo­ved. It wo­uld se­em that the wo­un­ded mo­uth co­uld no lon­ger sha­pe words. The Uis­gu ma­de a gre­ater ef­fort: a small ges­tu­re to­ward her kni­fe.</p>
   <p>    At last she was ab­le to gu­ess the na­tu­re of his plea. Ka­di­ya's he­art ra­ced. She had al­ways be­en fas­ci­na­ted by we­apons, and had on­ce or twi­ce in­dul­ged in swordp­lay when she co­uld get the Mas­ter-at-Arms in­to a go­od mo­od. Jagun had al­so ta­ught her Od­dling kni­fe-tricks - but this she was not pre­pa­red for.</p>
   <p>    Once mo­re that fa­int cry, the small ges­tu­re…</p>
   <p>    Kadiya set her mo­uth firmly and to­ok her dag­ger hilt in both hands. So­met­hing el­se ca­me to mind, words she had he­ard Jagun say when he had fo­und a stra­yed fro­ni­al so ent­rap­ped in a suck-vi­se it co­uld not be fre­ed.</p>
   <p>    "Go sa­fely be­yond…" She bro­ught down her bla­de and felt it en­ter li­ving flesh. Then she swal­lo­wed and swal­lo­wed aga­in.</p>
   <p>    Getting to her fe­et the girl stumb­led on, wan­ting to be away, free. Yet when she glan­ced down she saw the ro­ot-gu­ide still sli­ding ahe­ad. That she went in­to dan­ger she co­uld gu­ess, and her pre­pa­ra­ti­on for it was as wo­eful­ly small as had be­en tho­se of the Ci­ta­del gar­ri­son when the in­va­ders had stor­med in upon them.</p>
   <p>    She be­ca­me awa­re of mist gat­he­ring bet­we­en the tre­es ahe­ad, ed­ging out now and then in­to a ton­gue of fog. The ro­ot bo­re ste­adily on­ward. She was start­led when the tip of the tril­li­um-ro­ot lif­ted, bla­zed gre­en, and then spun to the left, now po­in­ting bet­we­en two of the lar­gest tre­es she had yet co­me upon.</p>
   <p>    There was a thin, high-pitc­hed whist­le. Ka­di­ya ins­tinc­ti­vely le­aped to one si­de as so­met­hing struck the trunk of the tree just ahe­ad of her. A spi­ral of thick and oily smo­ke aro­se, and she threw her­self belly down and thrust her way, in spi­te of the pa­in, in­to the shel­ter of a gre­at bramb­le-bush.</p>
   <p>    Again ca­me the whist­ling cry, fol­lo­wed by what might ha­ve be­en a muf­fled ans­wer. Ka­di­ya was ca­ught fa­ce down on the gro­und by Jagun's bag, which had snag­ged on a bramb­le. Aro­used to a frenzy, she fo­ught to free her­self. Smo­ke blew in­to her fa­ce and she cho­ked and then co­ug­hed wit­ho­ut re­li­ef. But that de­ep-lun­ged co­ug­hing sa­ved her. The bramb­les ga­ve away as she strug­gled and she fell for­ward in­to what se­emed li­ke a dark ho­le. Her out flung hand scra­ped aga­inst sto­ne, not bark or branc­hes.</p>
   <p>    As the hun­ting cry so­un­ded for the third ti­me be­hind her, she wor­med for­ward in­to the dark. In her pa­nic, one part of her tho­ught she might be pus­hing in­to a trap, yet she con­ti­nu­ed to crawl ahe­ad.</p>
   <p>    Any mo­ment she ex­pec­ted her pur­su­ers to catch up, to se­ize her by the ank­les and pull her out of this ho­le as a sucb­ri co­uld be jer­ked from its shell by a skil­led hand. So­me­how she ma­na­ged to ke­ep go­ing un­til her out­re­ac­hing hands met only emp­ti­ness and she plun­ged down and down…</p>
   <p>    Water clo­sed abo­ut her and with it light. But this was not the tur­bid murky li­qu­id of the swamp po­ols. It was crystal cle­ar, ex­cept ne­arest her own body whe­re swir­led the muck and so­il she had pic­ked up du­ring her crawl. Tho­ugh Jagun's bag pul­led her down she re­fu­sed to rid her­self of it. Rat­her she kic­ked and fo­ught her way to the sur­fa­ce. A gle­am of gre­en ca­ught her eye. So she had not lost her gu­ide! The ro­ot was swim­ming be­fo­re her.</p>
   <p>    There was a wall abo­ut this po­ol, over which she splas­hed and strug­gled in­to the air. She crept on hands and kne­es over a pa­ve­ment of me­tal­lic blue mo­sa­ic. The­re was no growth of we­ed, not­hing to sully the po­ol and the lim­pid wa­ter it held. Be­fo­re her was a flight of sta­irs, on eit­her si­de of which sto­od ranks of sta­tu­es.</p>
   <p>    She got to her fe­et. The ut­ter si­len­ce of this new pla­ce struck her first. On­ce she had pul­led her­self out of the wa­ter and her own splas­hing ce­ased, the smo­oth sur­fa­ce of the po­ol was un­dis­tur­bed.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya ven­tu­red to lo­ok up the flight of sta­irs. The­re was not a hint of gre­enery to be se­en - only the rows of sta­tu­es that Jagun had na­med sin­do­na. The light which ap­pe­ared to po­ur in­to this pla­ce struck an eye-tor­men­ting glit­ter from the or­na­men­ta­ti­on on the mo­ti­on­less fi­gu­res. Not all the sin­do­na who se­emed to re­gard her so calmly we­re ma­le, yet they we­re clad ali­ke. And the­re was abo­ut them such a fe­eling of li­fe that she wo­uld not ha­ve be­en surp­ri­sed had they mo­ved and spo­ke - per­haps to re­fu­se her ent­ran­ce, per­haps to bid her wel­co­me.</p>
   <p>    She lo­oked down at her bru­ised and scratc­hed body, the tat­te­red Nysso­mu gar­ments which had not sur­vi­ved too well her bat­tle with the wil­der­ness. Stran­gely, she felt re­ne­wed, stron­ger. She wan­ted to press on to see this pla­ce, of which no le­gend or tra­ve­ler's ta­le had ever spo­ken.</p>
   <p>    At the top of the sta­ir­way Ka­di­ya pa­used be­fo­re one of the fi­gu­res. It was tal­ler than she - per­haps li­fe-si­ze for the ra­ce who­se hands had mo­de­led it. She lo­oked up in­to the fa­ce be­ne­ath the sha­dow of the helm.</p>
   <p>    "Who are you?" Her words so­un­ded ab­rupt, too de­man­ding for this pla­ce of si­len­ce and be­a­uty. And how co­uld she ex­pect any ans­wer from the si­lent sen­ti­nel?</p>
   <p>    Of co­ur­se the­re co­uld be no ans­wer. Ne­vert­he­less she was awa­re of an odd so­und, as if a de­ade­ning cur­ta­in had be­en pul­led asi­de. The­re ca­me a crystal to­ne as if small bells chi­med. Birds twit­te­red, and a bre­eze wo­ve a bre­ath of scent abo­ut her which ba­nis­hed the last of that cho­king hor­ror which had dri­ven her in­to co­ver.</p>
   <p>    She lo­oked furt­her. He­re was anot­her flight of sta­irs even wi­der, but wit­ho­ut the gu­ar­di­an fi­gu­res, and it led up and out in­to such a stretch of park­land that no one born in the swamps en­circ­ling Ru­wen­da might ha­ve ima­gi­ned. It was a pla­ce of rich and pa­ra­do­xi­cal growth. Un­fa­mi­li­ar kinds of ri­pe fru­it hung be­si­de the very blos­soms from which they de­ve­lo­ped. Abo­ve was an azu­re sky. So enc­han­ted did the gar­den se­em, so enw­rap­ped in ma­gic that Ka­di­ya da­red not ven­tu­re in­to it. On the top step of the se­cond sta­ir­way lay the ro­ot-gu­ide, the gre­en ha­lo at its po­int spark­ling as if it had be­en fas­hi­oned from an eme­rald.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya blin­ked, and blin­ked aga­in. She was no lon­ger alo­ne.</p>
   <p>    The one co­ming ac­ross the gar­den to me­et her was pla­inly one of the sta­tue pe­op­le, even tho­ugh helm and mi­li­tary belts had be­en exc­han­ged for a ga­uzy ro­be.</p>
   <p>    Woman - truly? Ka­di­ya co­uld not ha­ve sa­id. But she knew that he­re was one to whom even the Arc­hi­ma­ge wo­uld ma­ke obe­isan­ce. Prin­cess Ka­di­ya sank to her kne­es.</p>
   <p>    "Daughter of the Thre­efold, what ha­ve yo­ur pe­op­le do­ne that the gre­at ba­lan­ce of the world no lon­ger holds firm? That de­ath and pa­in ha­ve co­me in­to this -the last strong­hold?"</p>
   <p>    Kadiya co­uld not be­li­eve that she was ac­tu­al­ly be­ing ac­cu­sed-it was only that this be­ing wan­ted the truth. Slowly, Ka­di­ya aro­se.</p>
   <p>    "Firstly" - she stro­ve to gi­ve her words the sa­me easi­ness that the ot­her's held -"I am the da­ugh­ter of King Kra­in of Ru­wen­da. Tho­se of La­bor­nok, un­der Volt­rik, using tre­ac­hery and for­ce of arms, and abo­ve all, the ta­lents of an evil sor­ce­rer, ha­ve la­id was­te my co­untry. By the aid of the Nysso­mu hun­ter Jagun I es­ca­ped from the Ci­ta­del at its fall. Then I went to the Arc­hi­ma­ge who ru­les at Noth, and this was gi­ven to me." She pic­ked up the ro­ot and held it out. "On me she set al­so a so­lemn task - that I must se­arch for a cer­ta­in ta­lis­man. It has be­en fo­re­told that only thro­ugh a wo­man of our ho­use may jus­ti­ce be wro­ught for Ru­wen­da. The Arc­hi­ma­ge na­med me and my sis­ters Pe­tals of the Li­ving Tril­li­um. The­re are three of us - alt­ho­ugh I am not su­re now that the ot­hers still li­ve. And this small tril­li­um-ro­ot has led me he­re."</p>
   <p>    "The Arc­hi­ma­ge of Noth," the ro­bed one sa­id slowly. "It has be­en long ye­ars sin­ce she sent one he­re to the Pla­ce of Know­led­ge. But if she do­es, we can well be­li­eve that the­re are sha­dows ab­ro­ad in the land. By the an­ci­ent ways li­fe must he­re be so - " The stran­ger held out one hand ho­ri­zon­tal­ly and set the ot­her un­der it ver­ti­cal­ly. "De­aling with the Dark Po­wers up­sets the ba­lan­ce. On­ce be­fo­re this hap­pe­ned, and the­re was a mighty bat­tle and a ren­ding of the earth. Dry land be­ca­me wa­ter, wa­ter be­ca­me land, and the Con­qu­ering Ice for­med a shro­ud over all."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya as­ked: "How did tho­se of blo­od find the ro­ad to this pla­ce, and pass the bar­ri­er which holds back the Nysso­mu?"</p>
   <p>    "King's Da­ugh­ter, on­ce the smal­lest ope­ning is ma­de in a wall, it may spre­ad to a tumb­le of sto­ne. This sor­ce­rer you ha­ve spo­ken of as yo­ur enemy re­ac­hes high and has le­ar­ned much. He has gi­ven cer­ta­in pro­tec­ti­on to his fol­lo­wers which ha­ve pro­ven keys for the un­loc­king of our an­ci­ent ga­tes. King's Da­ugh­ter"-the wo­man po­in­ted to the ro­ot still in Ka­di­ya's hand - "fi­nish out yo­ur jo­ur­ney he­re. If the Arc­hi­ma­ge of Noth has cho­sen you, then you will in­de­ed go in­to bat­tle. Whet­her you stand alo­ne or not, that will al­so co­me from yo­ur own ac­ti­ons."</p>
   <p>    "There is no sa­fety he­re in the Pla­ce of Know­led­ge?"</p>
   <p>    "Not from what has co­me - for ha­ve I not be­en sum­mo­ned by the thre­at of the Dark Po­wers?" Her he­ad went up as if she lis­te­ned. "So! They do not ha­ve qu­ite as much po­wer as they think. The sec­ret way which led you he­re is clo­sed and they must now cast back and forth blindly with the­ir Skri­tek. The old pro­tec­ti­on holds af­ter all."</p>
   <p>    "What do they se­ek?"</p>
   <p>    "That which they de­em tre­asu­re, King's Da­ugh­ter. But what the tro­ops of La­bor­nok and the Skri­tek are gre­edy for is not what mo­ves the­ir mas­ter. He se­eks what is for­bid­den and his fol­lo­wers are gre­atly we­ari­ed. They wo­uld re­turn to the Ci­ta­del wit­ho­ut that which wo­uld ap­pe­ase him."</p>
   <p>    "And what abo­ut the ta­lis­man that I se­ek?" Ka­di­ya cri­ed. She drop­ped the tril­li­um-ro­ot and it did not mo­ve; its co­lor had fa­ded. "Whe­re is the Three Lo­bed Bur­ning Eye that the Arc­hi­ma­ge com­man­ded me to find?"</p>
   <p>    "Look wit­hin you, King's Da­ugh­ter - open wi­de yo­ur he­art and mind."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya sta­red. "I ha­ve no ma­gi­cal ta­lis­man! I ha­ve no army! I ha­ve not even a sword - "</p>
   <p>    "All the­se exist, King's Da­ugh­ter." The­re was a chill in that ans­wer. "Lo­ok wit­hin yo­ur­self and you shall see!"</p>
   <p>    And she was go­ne.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya sank down on­to her kne­es. Not­hing in that wond­ro­us gar­den char­med her now. She was spent, lost. Only the shri­ve­led-lo­oking ro­ot of the Black Tril­li­um was left to her.</p>
   <p>    Magic! She po­un­ded both fists aga­inst the pa­ve­ment un­til the pa­in of her bru­ised flesh bro­ke thro­ugh the con­su­ming ra­ge. Lo­ok wit­hin her, lo­ok wit­hin her! Wit­hin was fury! Le­aning for­ward she snatc­hed up the stem which had moc­ked her and led her to this use­less pla­ce and stro­ve to shred it bet­we­en her fin­gers. But it re­sis­ted.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>One of three.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Out of now­he­re ca­me the phra­se which rang in her he­ad. Ka­di­ya lo­oked up qu­ickly. Had that sen­ti­nel-wo­man re­tur­ned? No, only the silly gar­den lay be­fo­re her and the worth­less ro­ot-gu­ide.</p>
   <p>    With all her for­ce the girl threw the ro­ot from her. It flew thro­ugh the air with the pre­ci­si­on of one of Jagun's darts, tur­ning but on­ce in flight so that it lan­ded, ro­ot end down, upon a patch of open earth in front of her. The­re it sto­od up­ward, qu­ive­ring a lit­tle. Ka­di­ya scramb­led up, thin­king to fi­nal­ly crush it. But she held back. Be­fo­re her eyes it was gro­wing thic­ker, tal­ler, wi­der. Won­de­ring, Ka­di­ya cro­uc­hed be­fo­re it, watc­hing. Two smal­ler stems spro­uted from ne­ar the top and stra­igh­te­ned in­to bars. Be­low them the stem en­lar­ged even mo­re, for­ming a thick dark cylin­der. At the very tip it bud­ded-or so it se­emed, for the­re three sphe­res grew, clo­sely co­nj­o­ined.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya watc­hed, ama­zed, hardly da­ring to be­li­eve what she now saw. The­re was mo­ve­ment in each of tho­se sphe­res, a split­ting of the­ir black co­ve­ring. What was re­ve­aled we­re -</p>
   <p>    Three eyes.</p>
   <p>    One was an eye of the Folk, yel­low-gre­en. One was gle­aming brown - and Ka­di­ya had only to lo­ok in­to a mir­ror to see its li­ke in her own he­ad. The third was sil­very blue, with its pu­pil enor­mo­usly wi­de, and in the depths a spark of gol­den fi­re.</p>
   <p>    Her amu­let bur­ned at her bre­ast.</p>
   <p>    Before she co­uld put hand to it the tril­li­um am­ber sprang up as tho­ugh it we­re a thing ali­ve, and the gol­den cha­in abo­ut her neck bro­ke, and the amu­let flew to­ward the Three-Lo­bed Eye and be­ca­me fi­xed at the pla­ce of the sphe­res' junc­tu­re.</p>
   <p>    Even as tho­se three eyes had ope­ned, so they clo­sed aga­in, le­aving three fe­atu­re­less black glo­bes be­hind. The girl to­ok hold of the stem just be­low the­ir swell and abo­ve the out­thrust le­aves, then with a cer­ta­inty that this is what must be do­ne, she pul­led.</p>
   <p>    What she drew forth from the earth was not the ro­ot end of the bro­ken plant, but a gle­aming sword! And one who­se hilt fit­ted so well in­to her hand that it might ha­ve be­en for­ged for her alo­ne. Ka­di­ya fin­ge­red the three sphe­res on the pom­mel.</p>
   <p>    "The Three-Lo­bed Bur­ning Eye." She was over­co­me with de­light. But then she no­ted that the bright we­apon was dul­led at the ed­ges and lac­king a po­int! "Lords of the Air, what man­ner of sword is this? How can I use such a thing aga­inst my ene­mi­es?"</p>
   <p>    A soft vo­ice, hardly mo­re than a bre­ath in her ear, sa­id: <emphasis>Le­arn</emphasis>.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Seven</strong></p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    What are you do­ing?" Ani­gel shri­eked to the ra­cing ri­mo­riks. "We can­not go this way-we will be kil­led!"</p>
   <p>    But the ani­mals ma­de no reply and only swam fas­ter, so that the bo­at fa­irly to­re thro­ugh the wa­ter and it was all the Prin­cess co­uld do to bra­ce her fe­et aga­inst the bow-wo­od and hang on­to the re­ins. Her mind re­fu­sed to ac­cept that the­se ani­mal fri­ends, the­se lo­yal cre­atu­res who had bro­ught her so far, we­re now pul­ling the punt with her and Im­mu in it stra­ight to­ward the brink of Tass Falls.</p>
   <p>    Anigel saw the drop-off co­ming clo­ser and clo­ser. She was in­ca­pab­le of ut­te­ring a so­und now, unab­le to form one sing­le co­he­rent tho­ught that she might ha­ve flung at the minds of the ri­mo­riks to turn them asi­de from the­ir su­ici­dal folly. Even the tril­li­um amu­let was out of re­ach, sin­ce the re­ins wo­und aro­und her hands we­re so ta­ut that she fe­ared her arms might be yan­ked from the­ir soc­kets. She tho­ught not at all of Im­mu, so con­vin­ced was she that her own de­ath was ap­pro­ac­hing.</p>
   <p>    The so­und of the wa­ter­fall grew to a ro­ar. Air-bor­ne drop­lets of wa­ter thrown up by the cas­ca­de so­aked her clot­hing and her ha­ir. Her eyes we­re loc­ked on the ap­pro­ac­hing rim, whe­re the flo­wing wa­ter chan­ged from the ne­ar-black of the de­ep la­ke in­to a glo­ri­o­us med­ley of blue, aqu­ama­ri­ne, gre­en - and fi­nal­ly whi­te. As the punt fi­nal­ly ne­ared the brink it slo­wed ab­ruptly. Ani­gel un­wo­und the re­ins from her hands, threw them down, and grip­ped the gun­wa­les. She gas­ped as two gre­at dark bo­di­es le­apt up, thro­wing a sho­wer of di­amond-bright spray, and then plun­ged out of sight.</p>
   <p>    The bow of the punt whe­re she sat thrust out in­to mid-air. For an ins­tant she was ab­le to lo­ok down, be­yond the tu­mult of whi­te­ness that was the fa­ce of the cas­ca­de, and see a gre­at azu­re po­ol with tiny bu­il­dings on the left hand sho­re. From the po­ol flo­wed a wi­de, many-chan­ne­led wa­ter­co­ur­se that sho­ne li­ke a sil­ver bra­id in the high sun­light, win­ding away thro­ugh the dark gre­en ex­pan­se of the Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest un­til it was lost in purp­le ha­ze.</p>
   <p>    She saw this pic­tu­re with her ke­en eyes, and her mind se­emed to he­ar Im­mu and the two ri­mo­riks say: <emphasis>Trust!</emphasis></p>
   <p>    And then the punt tip­ped for­ward, and the­re was flying spray all aro­und her and a hund­red cir­cu­lar ra­in­bows, and she be­gan to fall thro­ugh a ter­rib­le cras­hing whi­te world that so­on fa­ded in­to blank not­hing­ness.</p>
   <p>    In the new dre­am her Mot­her, Qu­e­en Ka­lant­he, was wal­king swiftly along a path in an un­fa­mi­li­ar lands­ca­pe that Ani­gel so­me­how re­cog­ni­zed as a dry land fo­rest, we­aring her co­ro­na­ti­on ro­bes and the awe­so­me Crown of Sta­te. Ani­gel was a long dis­tan­ce be­hind, run­ning to catch up with the Qu­e­en, crying out for her Mot­her to wa­it - but Ka­lant­he co­uld not he­ar. The­re was not­hing el­se to do but run fas­ter, and Ani­gel did this with her he­art thud­ding in her bre­ast and her lungs bur­ning and her legs hur­ting so badly that she wo­uld ha­ve cri­ed out at each step ex­cept for lack of bre­ath. She sho­uld ha­ve gi­ven up, thrown her­self to the gro­und in des­pa­ir, and let the Qu­e­en hurry away; but ins­te­ad she for­ced her­self to go on.</p>
   <p>    And then the mi­rac­le: the Qu­e­en stop­ped, and tur­ned, and wa­ited smi­ling whi­le the girl stag­ge­red up with the last of her strength and col­lap­sed in­to her Mot­her's arms, we­eping with hap­pi­ness.</p>
   <p>    "Dear lit­tle da­ugh­ter," Ka­lant­he sa­id. "I was so af­ra­id you wo­uldn't co­me eit­her. Yo­ur sis­ters ha­ve go­ne on ot­her ro­ads, you know. But all will be well now, just as so­on as we get you re­ady."</p>
   <p>    Then, ama­zingly, the dre­am-Qu­e­en led Ani­gel to a ne­arby bro­ok, ope­ned a vel­vet po­uch, and to­ok out so­ap and a soft cloth and an ivory comb. "We must cle­an you up," Ka­lant­he sa­id, "and dress yo­ur ha­ir, and find you rich ro­bes to we­ar so yo­ur su­bj­ects will re­cog­ni­ze you."</p>
   <p>    The wash-cloth rub­bed away at the dirt on Ani­gel's fa­ce. Rub­bed har­der and har­der un­til the flesh stung and the Prin­cess cri­ed out -</p>
   <p>    And wo­ke up.</p>
   <p>    She was lying on soft gro­und he­avily car­pe­ted with moss, ne­ar a ri­ver­bank. A tiny cre­atu­re with stri­ped yel­low fur, a po­in­ted fa­ce, and big black eyes was lic­king her che­ek with its ro­ugh ton­gue. When she ut­te­red a cry of surp­ri­se, the lit­tle thing squ­e­aked in alarm and scut­tled away in­to the den­se un­derg­rowth. An un­fa­mi­li­ar whi­te bird was sin­ging on the lo­west branch of the tree she lay un­der, its comp­lex song thre­ading li­ke a bright rib­bon thro­ugh the so­und of dis­tant thun­der. The ri­ver a few ells away had nu­me­ro­us small chan­nels flo­wing and in­ter­ming­ling on eit­her si­de of a bro­ad, twis­ting ma­inst­re­am, and the­re we­re mudf­lats and low-lying is­lands everyw­he­re.</p>
   <p>    I'm ali­ve!</p>
   <p>    The re­ali­za­ti­on ca­me to her slowly, and she mo­ved each arm and leg in turn, and her fin­gers, and then slowly sat up. Her wo­ven-grass gar­ment was in tat­ters, as was the worn li­nen shift be­ne­ath. Her fe­et we­re still shod in the Dis­cer­ner's sto­ut le­at­her san­dals, but her bus­kins we­re mostly torn to shreds. She still had her belt with its wal­let at­tac­hed, and the tril­li­um amu­let hung abo­ut her neck. Her skin was ca­ked with mud but qu­ite dry, which me­ant that she must ha­ve be­en lying on the bank for so­me ti­me. She had no me­mory of how she had got the­re.</p>
   <p>    Walking ca­re­ful­ly over de­ca­ying drift­wo­od, she went down to the ri­ver­si­de. From the wa­ter's ed­ge she had a cle­ar vi­ew upst­re­am. Along the en­ti­re nort­hern ho­ri­zon was a high gre­en ram­part, re­aring up out of the fo­rest and clo­ven in two by a sil­very swatch - the wa­ter­fall. It lo­oked li­ke it was at le­ast a le­ague away. The gre­at blue po­ol at its ba­se was not vi­sib­le, nor we­re the bu­il­dings she had glimp­sed mo­men­ta­rily be­fo­re plun­ging over the brink. The­re was only the bro­ad, shal­low ri­ver, its flow dis­sec­ted in­to sco­res of bra­ided chan­nels, and the den­se fo­rest on eit­her bank, which had vi­vid blue-gre­en fo­li­age very dif­fe­rent in hue and tex­tu­re from the jung­le wo­od­lands of the Mazy Mi­re. Even the smell was dif­fe­rent-shar­per, mo­re re­si­no­us, with oc­ca­si­onal whiffs of un­fa­mi­li­ar flo­wer-frag­ran­ce.</p>
   <p>    "I'm ali­ve," she sa­id, won­de­ringly. Then she flung out her scratc­hed and mud-sme­ared ba­re arms and cri­ed: "Ali­ve!"</p>
   <p>    In that sa­me ins­tant, gu­ilt smo­te her. Im­mu! Whe­re was Im­mu? And her two lo­yal ri­mo­rik fri­ends? She pe­ered up and down the ri­ver­bank, but saw only long-leg­ged ver­mi­li­on birds with spe­ar li­ke be­aks, dab­bling in the shal­lows. For a mo­ment pa­nic thre­ate­ned to overw­helm her. She was ali­ve, yes; but all alo­ne in the Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest with no no­ti­on of what to do next.</p>
   <p>    Should she call out? What if the La­bor­no­ki se­arc­hers had fol­lo­wed her and we­re lur­king so­mew­he­re, lis­te­ning? The­re was no pla­ce she co­uld go, no path along the bank, only the small cle­aring with its de­ca­ying drift­wo­od, sur­ro­un­ded by den­se shrub­bery, and furt­her in­land the mas­si­ve trunks of so­aring tre­es.</p>
   <p>    Were Im­mu and the ani­mals de­ad?</p>
   <p>    A ter­rib­le tho­ught struck her. She re­cal­led Im­mu's stran­ge, al­most re­sig­ned at­ti­tu­de as she re­pac­ked the­ir lunch things back on the la­ke. Im­mu had ti­ed the packs to the thwart! She had ne­ver do­ne that be­fo­re. Had she known what aw­ful es­ca­pe ro­ute the ri­mo­riks wo­uld ta­ke?</p>
   <p>    "Did she stay with me out of lo­ve," Ani­gel as­ked her­self in a whis­per, "ho­ping that I wo­uld sur­vi­ve the plun­ge, sin­ce I had be­en gi­ven ri­mo­rik-strength by the mi­ton -but kno­wing that she wo­uld su­rely die?" She felt her he­art cont­ract. Oh, Im­mu. De­ar old fri­end.</p>
   <p>    But she mustn't start blub­be­ring use­les­sly! It was ti­me to get on with it… Why not ta­ke so­me of the sac­red drink to bu­ild up strength, then try aga­in to sum­mon the ri­mo­riks.</p>
   <p>    She fo­und a moss-co­ve­red rock in the sha­de, ope­ned her wal­let, and to­ok out the scar­let go­urd with its net co­ve­ring. Re­mo­ving the stop­per and lif­ting it to her lips, she clo­sed her eyes and ut­te­red an uns­po­ken pra­yer. Then her mind cal­led: <emphasis>Fri­ends</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    There was a sud­den splash.</p>
   <p>    She ope­ned her eyes and saw two sle­ek he­ads out in the ma­in ri­ver chan­nel a sto­ne's throw away. Ri­sing, she wa­ited for them to ha­ul them­sel­ves over the sho­als and ri­vu­lets, the­ir glossy pelts get­ting mo­re muddy with each awk­ward sho­ve of the­ir flip­pers. Fi­nal­ly the pa­ir of ri­mo­riks re­ac­hed her and res­ted in the shal­lows, re­gar­ding her so­lemnly with hu­ge black eyes.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Human fri­end, we ha­ve se­arc­hed for yo­ur fri­end of the swamp Folk.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Immu… did you find her?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>No. We went a long way, lo­oking. But the Wa­ter That Flows to the Sea is wi­de and has many back­wa­ters whe­re yo­ur fri­end's body might ha­ve be­en was­hed.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Anigel's eyes stung and she pres­sed a knuck­le to her lips to stif­le a cry. "Her body!… You do not think she sur­vi­ved the falls?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>We se­arc­hed. We did not find her. Now it is ti­me to go on. Yo­ur hu­man ene­mi­es are co­ming down the Gre­at Vi­ne That Ta­kes Tre­es to the Sky. They will catch you if we do not ta­ke you away.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Anigel un­ders­to­od at on­ce that the La­bor­no­ki we­re des­cen­ding via the log-lift in­to the Gre­at Mu­tar Val­ley. For a mo­ment she was temp­ted to com­mand the ri­mo­riks to re­su­me the­ir se­arch for Im­mu; but in her mind's eye she se­emed to see her go­od old Od­dling nur­se sha­king one ta­lo­ned fin­ger and scol­ding her. Was Im­mu's sac­ri­fi­ce go­ing to be was­ted? She had not di­ed on a whim, to com­fort an or­di­nary girl. Her gre­at ges­tu­re was in­ten­ded to show her lo­ving sup­port for a Prin­cess on a qu­est, who must not shrink from fa­cing the worst tra­ge­di­es or dan­gers. Im­mu had go­ne bra­vely to her de­ath. It was up to Ani­gel to press on, now that she was so clo­se to her ta­lis­man.</p>
   <p>    "Did you find the punt?" she as­ked the ri­mo­riks.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Your bo­at?s smas­hed in­to small pi­eces. We fo­und yo­ur fri­end?s pack, but not yo­urs. We ha­ve ta­ken a bo­at be­lon­ging to the fo­rest Folk. It is hid­den over he­re.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    They wad­dled and wal­lo­wed downst­re­am for a do­zen ells be­fo­re tur­ning in­to the de­eper wa­ter of a nar­row cre­ek. The­re was not­hing for Ani­gel to do but wa­de in­to the ri­ver and fol­low them. The bot­tom-mud was as soft and te­na­ci­o­us as glue, and she da­red not stop mo­ving lest she sink down and be­co­me trap­ped. Splas­hing along fran­ti­cal­ly, she ca­ught up with the ri­mo­riks as they no­sed a fa­irly lar­ge, oddly ma­de wa­terc­raft out of the cre­ek mo­uth in­to wa­ist-de­ep wa­ter.</p>
   <p>    It was per­haps twi­ce as long as the wo­oden punt had be­en, but nar­ro­wer in the be­am. Its whi­te fra­me lo­oked li­ke it was ma­de of soft bo­ne or ivory-wo­od, las­hed to­get­her with dri­ed si­news. The hull was trans­lu­cent, hard but re­si­li­ent, al­most li­ke dull, fle­xib­le glass. Pi­eces of this stran­ge ma­te­ri­al we­re stitc­hed to­get­her in ni­cely sewn patch­work and the se­ams sme­ared with so­me shiny, wa­terp­ro­of re­sin. The craft ro­de high in the wa­ter and must ha­ve be­en of neg­li­gib­le we­ight.</p>
   <p>    Anigel flop­ped in. Im­mu's sod­den pack lay on the bot­tom. "The­re are no re­ins, fri­ends. And you se­em to ha­ve lost yo­ur har­nes­ses. How am I go­ing to dri­ve?"</p>
   <p>    They grin­ned at her. <emphasis>This bo­at ne­ed not be pul­led. It flo­ats as easily as a dry se­ed­pod. We will swim along on eit­her si­de, pus­hing, and you shall tell us which way to go</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess set­tled her­self and ope­ned her belt-wal­let. From it she to­ok the un­wil­ted le­af of the Black Tril­li­um. For the first ti­me, she no­ti­ced that the up­per por­ti­ons of the gol­den ve­in, tho­se rep­re­sen­ting the part of her jo­ur­ney al­re­ady comp­le­ted, we­re be­gin­ning to fa­de to brown. Be­low a lar­ge tan spot that rep­re­sen­ted La­ke Wum, the gol­den ve­in twis­ted and tur­ned over a dis­tan­ce abo­ut as long as Ani­gel's lit­tle fin­ger be­fo­re en­te­ring the very short, sharply bent stem.</p>
   <p>    "There is so­me dis­tan­ce to go yet," she told the ani­mals, "but it se­ems to be en­ti­rely on the Gre­at Mu­tar Ri­ver. I sup­po­se we must simply tra­vel on as fast as we can, ke­eping ahe­ad of the enemy sol­di­ers, un­til I re­ce­ive so­me ma­gi­cal sign."</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Do you wish us to ta­ke you to the fo­rest Folk of the Ri­ver?</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Why-" Ani­gel he­si­ta­ted. "I ne­ver tho­ught of that. Per­haps you had bet­ter. Tho­se wo­uld be the Wyvi­lo, I sup­po­se. Do they ha­ve vil­la­ges? "</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>There is one pla­ce only whe­re they li­ve. We will ta­ke you the­re.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Very well," sa­id the Prin­cess.</p>
   <p>    Growling and wo­ofing with the ef­fort of mo­ving out of the­ir ele­ment, the ri­mo­riks nud­ged and sho­ved the bo­at over one mudf­lat af­ter anot­her, sli­ding it along thro­ugh sub­si­di­ary stre­am­lets whe­ne­ver they co­uld, un­til it fi­nal­ly re­ac­hed the ma­in chan­nel. The­re the big cre­atu­res rol­led abo­ut in the dark cle­an wa­ter for a few mi­nu­tes in evi­dent re­li­ef be­fo­re set­tling in on eit­her si­de and be­gin­ning the jo­ur­ney down-ri­ver. Wit­ho­ut any ur­ging from Ani­gel, they pro­pel­led the craft ra­pidly along.</p>
   <p>    She gu­es­sed that it must be la­te af­ter­no­on. Ope­ning Im­mu's drenc­hed pack, the girl la­id out her nur­se's sle­ep-sack and a few pi­eces of ext­ra clot­hing to dry. For­tu­na­tely, Ani­gel was a small per­son, so she wo­uld be ab­le to use the things. The­re was a soft, wi­de-brim­med grass hat, a lit­tle le­at­her ra­inc­lo­ak, and an ext­ra pa­ir of bus­kins to we­ar un­der her san­dals. The supply of tra­il-ra­ti­on ro­ots was now run­ning very low and Ani­gel ca­re­ful­ly set out the re­ma­ining ones to redry in the hot sun. The fru­it le­at­her had be­en eaten up long ago, and they had be­en li­ving mostly upon wild fru­it and nuts, aug­men­ted with the sha­red prey of the ri­mo­riks. She wo­uld ha­ve to be very ca­re­ful abo­ut samp­ling unk­nown plant-fo­od. So many of the most temp­ting-lo­oking things had be­en de­sig­na­ted de­adly po­ison by Im­mu. Thanks be to the Lords of the Air and Im­mu's irons­hell fi­re-ma­king kit (which wo­uld be ser­vi­ce­ab­le aga­in on­ce the damp tin­der dri­ed out), she wo­uld be ab­le to bro­il her fish ins­te­ad of eating them raw. The rest of Ani­gel's tre­asury con­sis­ted of her own small kni­fe and the ot­her items in her wal­let: a comb, a hand­kerc­hi­ef that she rin­sed out each day, a small cup, and a sli­ver of so­ap.</p>
   <p>    "My ric­hes, my ro­yal ro­bes, and my sump­tu­o­us fo­ods," she dec­la­red, sur­ve­ying the po­or col­lec­ti­on of things la­id out on the bot­tom of the bo­at. "And two fa­ith­ful re­ta­iners to stand by me. What mo­re co­uld any prin­cess ask?" Sig­hing, she fo­und a cle­ar spa­ce in the bot­tom of the bo­at and lay down with the hat sha­ding her fa­ce. <emphasis>My fri­ends, I think I am go­ing to sle­ep</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    They sa­id: <emphasis>It is a go­od thing for you to do</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    Freed from the cho­re of dri­ving for the first ti­me sin­ce they had left Noth, Ani­gel fell in­to a dre­am­less do­ze, too we­ary even to mo­urn Im­mu. She wo­ke ho­urs la­ter, when the ri­mo­riks be­ac­hed them on a small, nar­row is­land whe­re the grass grew in soft, cle­an sand ins­te­ad of mud. The eve­ning was very warm, but the is­land was swept by a co­ol bre­eze that kept the stin­ging in­sects at bay. The bed of the Gre­at Mu­tar had wi­de­ned as they tra­ve­led downst­re­am and now was al­most too wi­de to see ac­ross. The fo­rest on both si­des was ne­arly lost in the de­epe­ning ha­ze. From far away ca­me a trum­pe­ting so­und, the cry of so­me lar­ge ani­mal. But Ani­gel was con­fi­dent that her fri­ends had cho­sen a sa­fe pla­ce for her to spend the night.</p>
   <p>    One small brud­dok shrub grew on the­ir is­land. She drow­sily cong­ra­tu­la­ted the ri­mo­riks for ha­ving fo­und it. They ba­red the­ir fangs bri­efly and swam away to hunt. The Prin­cess ate a few of the swe­et, ju­icy fru­its, ma­de a nest of the sle­ep-sack be­ne­ath the "tra­ve­ler's fri­end," and bur­ro­wed in­to it.</p>
   <p>    Once aga­in, her sle­ep was wit­ho­ut dre­ams.</p>
   <p>    Prince An­tar's for­ce spent all of the next day se­arc­hing the gre­at po­ol at the fo­ot of Tass Falls, but had no luck fin­ding the bo­di­es of Prin­cess Ani­gel or her com­pa­ni­on. The re­ma­ins of her wo­oden punt we­re fo­und was­hed up ne­ar the de­ser­ted saw­mill, and the con­sen­sus among the knights was that no one co­uld ha­ve sur­vi­ved the trip over the cas­ca­de. The­ir opi­ni­on co­un­ted for na­ught, ho­we­ver. The de­ci­si­on whet­her to call off the hunt res­ted with the sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus. The Blue Vo­ice wo­uld con­fer te­le­pat­hi­cal­ly with his mas­ter on the mor­row, when fresh in­tel­li­gen­ce wo­uld ha­ve be­en vo­uch­sa­fed by the all-se­e­ing ice-mir­ror. The se­arch-party ma­de camp at the po­ol's ed­ge -knights, men-at-arms, and the flat­bo­at crews who had be­en pres­sed in­to ser­vi­ce for the body-se­arch. Sit­ting aro­und the­ir bon­fi­res that eve­ning (the si­nis­ter cho­rus of noc­tur­nal ho­ots and ro­ars ema­na­ting from the fo­rest be­hind the mill in­su­red that no one stra­yed far), the La­bor­no­ki com­mo­ners we­re in a mo­od of sup­pres­sed che­er­ful­ness. With the Prin­cess su­rely de­ad, they lo­oked for­ward to re­tur­ning to the ci­vi­li­zed com­forts of the Ci­ta­del. Most of the knights felt di­sap­po­in­ted, che­ated of the­ir chan­ce for glory. It se­emed un­li­kely that the for­ce wo­uld go any furt­her down the Gre­at Mu­tar, se­arc­hing for the myste­ri­o­us ta­lis­man that the sor­ce­rer had set his he­art on.</p>
   <p>    Contrary to ex­pec­ta­ti­ons, only three Wyvi­lo bo­ats had be­en fo­und at the lo­wer lan­ding, and the­re we­re no abo­ri­gi­nes in evi­den­ce to ser­ve as gu­ides. The Mas­ter-Tra­der Ed­zar fe­ared that the fo­rest Od­dlings had ret­re­ated to the­ir lar­ge vil­la­ge, cal­led Let, when the La­bor­nok in­va­si­on bro­ught a halt to the tim­ber tra­de. The­re was small ho­pe they wo­uld co­me back up-ri­ver be­fo­re the next dry se­ason.</p>
   <p>    Prince An­tar se­qu­es­te­red him­self in his pa­vi­li­on that night, re­fu­sing even the kindly over­tu­res of Sir Owa­non and his ot­her lo­yal fri­ends. His gri­ef at the ap­pa­rent de­ath of the Prin­cess was an open sec­ret, the simp­le Sir Pe­na­pat ha­ving blab­bed to all he­arers how dist­ra­ught An­tar had be­en when the punt was swept over the falls.</p>
   <p>    The fol­lo­wing mor­ning, the Blue Vo­ice was aler­ted men­tal­ly by Oro­gas­tus and ret­re­ated to his own small tent for a long te­le­pat­hic con­fe­ren­ce. An­tar was left to co­ol his he­els me­anw­hi­le, and with Sir Owa­non to­ok the op­por­tu­nity to study mo­re clo­sely the wa­ter-po­we­red mill, and the lift mec­ha­nism that had trans­por­ted them all down the es­carp­ment.</p>
   <p>    "The ele­va­ting de­vi­ce is most cun­ningly ma­de," the Prin­ce re­mar­ked, cra­ning his neck for a bet­ter lo­ok at the wo­ven-ste­el ho­ist cab­les. "All one ne­ed do is lo­ad a sing­le gi­ant log, or a batch of lum­ber, on­to the plat­form. The hu­ge co­un­ter­we­ight and the system of pul­leys in­su­re that the draft ani­mals at the top are ab­le to lift the he­avi­est lo­ad wit­ho­ut a gre­at exer­ti­on of energy."</p>
   <p>    "Ingenious, the­se Ru­wen­di­ans," Owa­non sa­id. "Still, we ha­ve si­mi­lar mac­hi­nes in the ship­yards at De­ror­gu­ila, even if they be not so lar­ge."</p>
   <p>    Antar sa­id in a low vo­ice: "Lar­ge tho­ugh it is, the lift can hardly hand­le the gre­at flat­bo­ats that bro­ught us down the la­ke, even if we co­uld wrest­le the things along the skid-ro­ad. We co­uld lo­wer the punts, cer­ta­inly. But they wo­uld be ina­de­qu­ate to trans­port our en­ti­re for­ce and its ne­ces­sary sup­pli­es down the Gre­at Mu­tar."</p>
   <p>    Owanon nod­ded ag­re­ement. "Effec­ti­vely, our ex­pe­di­ti­on is stal­led."</p>
   <p>    "This is what I ha­ve inst­ruc­ted the Blue Vo­ice to tell the sor­ce­rer. I ha­ve no in­ten­ti­on of le­ading a blind se­arch in­to the Tas­sa­le­yo for this ma­gi­cal ta­lis­man he co­vets so gre­edily. Yet I wo­uld not put it past him to press such an ad­ven­tu­re upon us. I will de­pend upon you and Do­da­bi­lik to sup­port me when I dec­li­ne to ta­ke our for­ce any furt­her."</p>
   <p>    "This go­es wit­ho­ut sa­ying, my Prin­ce."</p>
   <p>    Antar's fa­ce was gra­ve wit­hin the open vi­sor of his blue-ena­me­led helm. "I fe­ar the sor­ce­rer will use this ex­pe­di­ti­on's fa­ilu­re to furt­her di­mi­nish me in my Ro­yal Fat­her's eyes. The in­si­di­o­us spell mon­ger knew full well that I ha­ve no sto­mach for this har­rying of help­less wo­men. And the­re was al­so my bre­ak­down at the light­ho­use yes­ter­day…"</p>
   <p>    Owanon was tact­ful­ly si­lent.</p>
   <p>    The Prin­ce eyed his fri­end with an exp­res­si­on that was both sad and self-moc­king. "Do all of them know that I had fal­len in lo­ve with her, Owan?"</p>
   <p>    "Aye, my Prin­ce. But the bet­ter men think no­ne the less of you for it. One can­not help the inc­li­na­ti­ons of the he­art. And you ha­ve car­ri­ed out King Volt­rik's com­mands me­ti­cu­lo­usly. No true-spo­ken man can say that you shir­ked yo­ur duty."</p>
   <p>    "Orogastus can," the Prin­ce re­tor­ted bit­terly. "He has al­ways ha­ted and en­vi­ed me, con­vin­cing the King that I am too im­ma­tu­re to grasp gre­at mat­ters of sta­te. This dam­nab­le in­va­si­on… the monst­ro­us cru­elty with which we tre­ated the van­qu­is­hed Ru­wen­di­ans… all the sor­ce­rer's do­ing! He has tur­ned my fat­her in­to his cre­atu­re, pla­ying upon his fe­ars and en­co­ura­ging his ba­sest ins­tincts."</p>
   <p>    Again Owa­non for­bo­re to spe­ak.</p>
   <p>    "King Volt­rik was not al­ways a cru­el man," the Prin­ce sa­id. "When I was a small boy and my de­ar step­mot­her Shon­da yet li­ved, he was a nob­le Crown Prin­ce, a lo­ving hus­band and fat­her, and a man of san­gu­ine and kindly spi­rit. It was only af­ter the co­ming of Oro­gas­tus that his so­ul be­ca­me en­ve­no­med. Fat­her had to wa­it too long for his thro­ne, and the luck­less Shon­da was bar­ren, and the sor­ce­rer en­co­ura­ged and abet­ted every wic­ked and ext­ra­va­gant am­bi­ti­on that sto­le in­to Fat­her's mind. Even the cont­ri­ving of Shon­da's de­ath."</p>
   <p>    Owanon sa­id gently, "The­se sad mat­ters are com­mon know­led­ge, my Prin­ce. But yo­ur fat­her bro­oks no cri­ti­cism of Oro­gas­tus - and he is King."</p>
   <p>    "Yes," sig­hed An­tar. "Only so­me­ti­mes, when I re­mem­ber the aw­ful sce­ne when he rip­ped the re­gal di­adem from the brow of the dying King Spo­ri­kar, and his ter­rib­le glee an­ti­ci­pa­ting the blo­ods­hed that our in­va­si­on of Ru­wen­da wo­uld oc­ca­si­on, I fe­ar that the sor­ce­rer has dri­ven him mad. But to sug­gest this wo­uld be high tre­ason, of co­ur­se."</p>
   <p>    Owanon's fa­ce was som­ber. "You wo­uld not be alo­ne in yo­ur be­li­ef. The­re we­re many in our army who tho­ught the in­va­si­on of Ru­wen­da un­wi­se. But I fe­ar the­se mat­ters must wor­sen be­fo­re they can be bet­te­red." At that mo­ment he spi­ed a man run­ning to­ward them, and ca­uti­oned the Prin­ce to si­len­ce.</p>
   <p>    It was Ri­nu­tar rus­hing up, his ar­mor clan­king and his fa­ce alight with a ma­li­ci­o­us grin. "My Prin­ce! Ama­zing news! The Lord Oro­gas­tus has de­ter­mi­ned that Prin­cess Ani­gel yet li­ves. She is on her way down the Gre­at Mu­tar. You are com­man­ded to fol­low her, but only with yo­ur body of knights and a ser­vant for each. And he­re is the stran­gest part! The sor­ce­rer no lon­ger com­mands that the girl be hin­de­red from her qu­est and kil­led. On the cont­rary - she is to be gi­ven free re­in! And only af­ter she has se­cu­red her ma­gi­cal ta­lis­man are we to se­ize her and put her to de­ath."</p>
   <p>    Antar sta­red at the knight thun­derst­ruck. "She li­ves," he whis­pe­red.</p>
   <p>    "So says the ice-mir­ror." Ri­nu­tar's smirk was in­so­lent. "I had a fe­eling you'd be ple­ased… at be­ing gi­ven anot­her chan­ce at her."</p>

   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    The lam­mer­ge­i­er sa­id to Ha­ra­mis, <emphasis>The­re is the ca­ve you se­ek</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    On this mor­ning, the storm ha­ving blown away, the fresh-whi­te­ned so­ut­hern fa­ce of Mo­unt Gid­ris was so daz­zling bright that Ha­ra­mis was al­most blin­ded. Even sha­ding her eyes with her glo­ved hand, she co­uld not see the pla­ce Hi­lu­ro po­in­ted out. But the gre­at bird spi­ra­led down, down, down, and what had be­en a fe­atu­re­less gla­re be­ca­me a vast bowl just be­ne­ath the mo­un­ta­in's sum­mit, from which a co­los­sal gla­ci­er flo­wed.</p>
   <p>    The ri­ver of ice po­ured over a ste­ep pre­ci­pi­ce be­fo­re be­gin­ning its gent­ler des­cent to­ward the Ru­wen­di­an ba­sin, frac­tu­ring in­to a mass of ti­ta­nic ice-blocks that we­re par­ti­al­ly bu­ri­ed in new snow. The cracks and chasms of the ice­fall glo­wed with a hund­red va­ri­ed sha­des of blue… but in the midst of the tumb­le sho­ne an unex­pec­ted gol­den gle­am.</p>
   <p>    As the gre­at bird flew clo­ser, Ha­ra­mis saw that this was an upth­rust spi­re of rock, milky in co­lor but flec­ked with gold. What had se­emed a fra­gi­le ne­ed­le vi­ewed from afar so­on be­ca­me an outc­rop­ping so­me eighty ells high and fi­ve ells in width, ap­pa­rently for­med of whi­te qu­artz with spark­ling inc­lu­si­ons of pre­ci­o­us me­tals. The gla­ci­er had so ab­ra­ded it over the ages that it re­semb­led a slen­der to­wer ma­king a va­li­ant ef­fort to re­ma­in abo­ve a cha­otic, fro­zen sea. Half­way up the spi­re was an ope­ning, with a nar­row rock shelf just be­low it.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>I can only ho­ver whi­le you alight</emphasis>, Hi­lu­ro told Ha­ra­mis. <emphasis>The led­ge is too nar­row for me</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    The hu­ge black-and-whi­te bird des­cen­ded. The mo­uth of the ca­ve was twi­ce the he­ight of the Prin­cess, but se­emed smal­ler be­ca­use of the dang­ling icic­les that frin­ged it li­ke di­amond fangs. Al­most all of the small led­ge was slip­pery ice, in which gold nug­gets and chunks of whi­te rock we­re em­bed­ded.</p>
   <p>    Haramis to­uc­hed her amu­let, of­fe­red a word­less pra­yer, and clas­ped Hi­lu­ro's fe­at­hery neck. Her hands just met, and she loc­ked her fin­gers tightly to­get­her. She hung blind, her fur clo­ak bil­lo­wing and the to­es of her bo­ots po­in­ting down. And she he­ard not only the shrill pi­ping so­und of air rus­hing thro­ugh wing-plu­ma­ge, but al­so a thun­de­ro­us growl, and along with it a de­ep, eerie en­semb­le of mu­si­cal no­tes, as if so­me gi­ant's fid­dle we­re be­ing bo­wed.</p>
   <p>    Her fe­et to­uc­hed a firm sur­fa­ce. She re­la­xed, sank slowly with hands still hol­ding the bird's neck, then let go. Ope­ning her eyes, she saw the hu­ge form sho­oting skyward whi­le she res­ted pre­ca­ri­o­usly on her kne­es at the ent­ran­ce to her go­al: a ca­ve of glit­te­ring ice with its ent­ran­ce gold-fra­med.</p>
   <p>    Or so it se­emed.</p>
   <p>    Overcome with awe, Ha­ra­mis lo­oked abo­ut her. The rock-spi­re in the midst of the gla­ci­er vib­ra­ted li­ke a tu­ning-fork to the cons­tant scra­ping flow of the ice, which fil­led the air with an im­men­se mu­si­cal so­und. How many tho­usands of ye­ars had the ice gro­und away at this hard, gold-ve­ined qu­artz mass be­fo­re di­mi­nis­hing it to its pre­sent slen­der­ness? Se­en from clo­se by, the rock to­wer lo­oked inc­re­dibly fra­gi­le. The ca­ve's mo­uth, bor­de­red with lar­ge amorp­ho­us lumps of gold, was par­ti­al­ly bar­red by icic­les that we­re be­gin­ning to melt in the bril­li­ant sun­light.</p>
   <p>    Haramis clim­bed to her fe­et, slip­ped ca­uti­o­usly thro­ugh the drip­ping tusks of ice, and ca­me in­to the in­te­ri­or cham­ber, who­se walls and ce­iling we­re stre­aked with flows of black ice.</p>
   <p>    A pa­le glim­mer be­hind the ice-she­et at the back of the ca­ve at­trac­ted her at­ten­ti­on. She mo­ved to­ward it, on re­ali­zing that the tril­li­um amu­let she wo­re was warm aga­inst her bre­ast, as if it we­re cal­ling to so­met­hing. Was the glim­me­ring obj­ect the ta­lis­man des­ti­ned for her?</p>
   <p>    She mo­ved clo­ser to the gre­at dark mass of ice and to wha­te­ver it was that glo­wed be­ne­ath it. She still co­uld not see it cle­arly, but her amu­let con­ti­nu­ed to grow war­mer aga­inst her skin. Might her ta­lis­man it­self be trap­ped in the ice? If so, how co­uld she get it out?</p>
   <p>    She mo­ved still clo­ser to the myste­ri­o­us gle­am. Her tril­li­um-amber was now so hot that it was bur­ning her bre­ast. She pul­led off her glo­ves, ho­oked a fin­ger aro­und the amu­let's cha­in, and pul­led it from un­der her tu­nic. The flo­wer flas­hed as if it we­re afi­re, and the amu­let was so hot she co­uld ba­rely to­uch it. She slid the cha­in ca­re­ful­ly over her he­ad and held it so the am­ber dang­led in front of her fa­ce. Ins­te­ad of han­ging at the end of the cha­in, ho­we­ver, the amu­let pul­led away from her, drawn to the glow in the wall. The bla­zing light from the em­bed­ded tril­li­um tur­ned an en­ti­re sec­ti­on of the wall bright gold. The gla­re was pa­in­ful, fil­ling her eyes with a lar­ge gold spot en­circ­led by a bright blue co­ro­na.</p>
   <p>    The amu­let drag­ged her se­ve­ral steps clo­ser to the wall. Now it ga­ve off such ext­re­me he­at that Ha­ra­mis tur­ned her he­ad away from it. Out of the cor­ner of her eye, out­si­de of the area whe­re the light blin­ded her, she co­uld see wa­ter flo­wing in a thin stre­am down the wall. The amu­let was ac­tu­al­ly mel­ting the ice!</p>
   <p>    Suddenly the­re was a flash of sil­ver amid the gold as so­met­hing mel­ted free and slid to the flo­or. The amu­let's glow fa­ded and it co­oled ra­pidly, fal­ling back aga­inst her clot­hing. Ha­ra­mis bent qu­ickly to grasp wha­te­ver had be­en fre­ed be­fo­re it co­uld ref­re­eze in­to the pud­dle on the ca­ve flo­or. Be­fo­re she co­uld fo­cus her eyes on it she felt its we­ight in her hand.</p>
   <p>    She wa­ited pa­ti­ently for her vi­si­on to cle­ar. Her eyes hurt, and she fo­ught the im­pul­se to rub them. But even thro­ugh the pa­in, de­ep wit­hin her he­art a tre­men­do­us sen­se of <emphasis>rig­h­t­ness</emphasis> blo­omed. For an ins­tant, she un­ders­to­od the pat­tern of the world and her pla­ce in it. She knew all, had po­wer over all, com­man­ded all. She had be­co­me what she al­ways knew she co­uld be…</p>
   <p>    … but for a mo­ment only. And then the trans­cen­dent fe­eling was go­ne.</p>
   <p>    She sto­od in the ice-ca­ve, now lit only in­di­rectly by the sun­light out­si­de, and re­ali­zed that she co­uld see nor­mal­ly aga­in. She held a wand ma­de of sil­ver me­tal, abo­ut half the length of her fo­re­arm. At one end was a small ring to ac­com­mo­da­te the cha­in, and at the ot­her, a kind of ho­op, much lar­ger, that she co­uld ha­ve pas­sed both her clo­sed fists thro­ugh. At the circ­let's top was a pro­j­ec­ti­on that she at first to­ok to be a flo­wer ma­de of the sa­me whi­te me­tal; but when she lo­oked mo­re clo­sely, she saw that what she had mis­ta­ken for pe­tals we­re ins­te­ad three small wings, up­right.</p>
   <p>    The Three-Win­ged Circ­le.</p>
   <p>    Her ta­lis­man. At last.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Then you will know that the fi­nal strug­gle for Ru­wen­da, and for yo­ur own so­ul, is at hand.</emphasis>..</p>
   <p>    The words of the Arc­hi­ma­ge se­emed to ec­ho in the gold-and-crystal ca­ve, and Ha­ra­mis ga­ve a gre­at start, crying: "Who's the­re?"</p>
   <p>    But im­me­di­ately she knew that she was still alo­ne, and her mind har­ked back to the fe­eling of inc­re­dib­le po­wer that had suf­fu­sed her when the ta­lis­man was first fre­ed from its icy imp­ri­son­ment.</p>
   <p>    The amu­let and ta­lis­man both fla­red to light si­mul­ta­ne­o­usly. Ref­le­xi­vely Ha­ra­mis drop­ped them both and bro­ught both hands up to shi­eld her eyes. But even thro­ugh the palms of her hands she co­uld see glo­wing ra­di­an­ce. She kept her hands in pla­ce un­til the light fa­ded, then slowly lo­we­red them. Her vi­si­on was a lit­tle blurry, but this ti­me she was not comp­le­tely blin­ded. She knelt qu­ickly to lo­ok for the amu­let and ta­lis­man, ho­ping they hadn't de­ci­ded to fre­eze them­sel­ves in­to the flo­or. <emphasis>Do they think I'm un­worthy of them</emphasis>? she won­de­red an­xi­o­usly.</p>
   <p>    To her vast re­li­ef they lay lo­ose on the sur­fa­ce of the ice. But now they had fu­sed to­get­her, with her tril­li­um amu­let nest­led wit­hin the wings of the wand.</p>
   <p>    It was a so­ur­ce of po­wer. Of ma­gic…</p>
   <p>    Yes - <emphasis>this</emphasis> was ma­gic!</p>
   <p>    "And how will I le­arn to use this po­wer?" Her ga­ze was fi­xed upon the three wings. "The Whi­te Lady sa­id that the­re we­re two ot­her ta­lis­mans for my sis­ters, and if all three of us suc­ce­eded in our qu­est, then the re­so­lu­ti­on wo­uld co­me. But that do­esn't tell me much."</p>
   <p>    Within the sil­very ring be­ne­ath the wings, pe­ar­les­cent va­pors se­emed to flow. Al­most dre­amily, Ha­ra­mis fo­und her­self com­man­ding the ta­lis­man: "Show me if my sis­ters ha­ve suc­ce­eded!"</p>
   <p>    And she saw Ka­di­ya.</p>
   <p>    Her sis­ter sto­od in the midst of a gre­at crowd of Od­dlings - Uis­gu, jud­ging from the­ir small sta­tu­re -hol­ding up in one hand a shi­ning thing li­ke a Sword of Mercy, a bla­de lac­king a po­int, with a pom­mel re­semb­ling three co­nj­o­ined black fru­its. The Folk we­re che­ering her.</p>
   <p>    "Yes," Ha­ra­mis mur­mu­red, "you we­re li­kely to win thro­ugh. But po­or lit­tle Ani­gel… Whe­re are you, ti­mid one?"</p>
   <p>    The Circ­le was wi­ped cle­ar of Ka­di­ya's ima­ge. In its pla­ce, anot­her for­med, at first un­re­cog­ni­zab­le - but then Ha­ra­mis gas­ped.</p>
   <p>    Anigel! Gol­den ha­ir stre­aming, fa­ce no lon­ger plump-che­eked and swe­etly pa­le but le­an, flus­hed, exul­tant. Sap­phi­re eyes nar­ro­wed and flic­ke­ring from si­de to si­de with a ke­en alert­ness Ha­ra­mis ne­ver wo­uld ha­ve tho­ught pos­sib­le. Ani, dres­sed in muddy rags, sit­ting in an exo­tic bo­at that fa­irly flas­hed down so­me wi­de ri­ver, le­aving a whi­te wa­ke be­hind it. Ani, ti­mid lit­tle Ani, smi­ling grimly whi­le so­me fi­er­ce-lo­oking wa­ter-cre­atu­res pus­hed the bo­at along at bre­ak­neck spe­ed…</p>
   <p>    "Impossible!" Ha­ra­mis exc­la­imed.</p>
   <p>    And the vi­si­on win­ked out.</p>
   <p>    Haramis sta­red at the empty Three-Win­ged Circ­le. "Are the­se true vi­si­ons? Is the ta­lis­man so easy to com­mand?"</p>
   <p>    A third vi­si­on: the Arc­hi­ma­ge, lying in bed, dis­tinctly we­aker than when Ha­ra­mis had se­en her in per­son, her eyes clo­sed and her skin wa­xen. Alt­ho­ugh the cre­ased and sun­ken lips did not mo­ve, Ha­ra­mis se­emed to he­ar her spe­ak:</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>All three of you. must ac­comp­lish yo­ur fo­re­or­da­ined tasks, mas­te­ring yo­ur own sel­ves abo­ve all, be­fo­re Ru­wen­da may cast off the yo­ke of La­bor­nok and the ba­lan­ce of the world be res­to­red. And if one fa­ils, all fa­il.</emphasis>..</p>
   <p>    "But that do­esn't ma­ke sen­se!" Ha­ra­mis pro­tes­ted. "I am Qu­e­en of Ru­wen­da; the duty is mi­ne. And the prop­hecy of yo­ur own Folk says that <emphasis>a</emphasis> wo­man will bring down King Volt­rik - not three of them!"</p>
   <p>    The dying Arc­hi­ma­ge ope­ned her fat­hom­less eyes. Still her lips we­re un­mo­ving.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>But I told you al­so that Volt­rik was not yo­ur gre­atest enemy</emphasis>… The vi­si­on of the Arc­hi­ma­ge di­sap­pe­ared.</p>
   <p>    Something flic­ke­red in the icy mir­ror of the wall whe­re the ta­lis­man had be­en. Ha­ra­mis lo­oked up and saw the smi­ling fa­ce of a whi­te-ha­ired man.</p>
   <p>    His age was un­gu­es­sab­le; the pas­sing of ye­ars had left no tra­ce upon his fi­ne fe­atu­res. He wo­re ro­bes of black and sil­ver, and sat at a tab­le on which se­ve­ral stran­ge de­vi­ces res­ted, with a gre­at bo­ok and a tab­let half-co­ve­red with wri­ting. He held a stylus in one strong hand and a half-eaten rosy la­du-fru­it in the ot­her. It was this last ho­mely thing - hardly to be ex­pec­ted of a de­vil in hu­man form - that ma­de Ha­ra­mis be­gin to re­turn his smi­le.</p>
   <p>    "Princess Ha­ra­mis." His vo­ice was as cle­ar as tho­ugh he sto­od be­si­de her. "Wel­co­me to our com­pany."</p>
   <p>    "And what com­pany is that?" she re­tor­ted, tigh­te­ning her lips. "That of La­bor­no­ki mur­de­rers? Un­li­ke you, Oro­gas­tus, I am par­ti­cu­lar abo­ut the com­pany I ke­ep!"</p>
   <p>    The sor­ce­rer la­ug­hed and put down pen and fru­it. "You ha­ve a ra­re spi­rit, Lady. I must ad­mit that King Volt­rik and Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil and the­ir ilk are not the com­pa­ni­ons I wo­uld ha­ve cho­sen - had it not be­en that I had no cho­ice."</p>
   <p>    "No cho­ice?" Ha­ra­mis as­ked skep­ti­cal­ly.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus con­ti­nu­ed with per­fect ami­abi­lity. "The com­pany I wel­co­med you to was that of ma­gic-wi­el­ders. I con­fess that our num­ber is so­mew­hat re­du­ced in the­se lat­ter days, con­sis­ting of only you, me, and Bi­nah - she whom you call the Arc­hi­ma­ge. And I fe­ar that so­on only you and I will re­ma­in."</p>
   <p>    "Are you plan­ning to kill the Whi­te Lady, now that she is too we­ak to de­fend her­self?" Ha­ra­mis spo­ke coldly.</p>
   <p>    "My de­ar child - of co­ur­se not! I am no wan­ton kil­ler. No, what stalks Bi­nah is old age and de­ath." He lo­oked sad­de­ned and pen­si­ve. "I fe­ar it co­mes to all of us in ti­me. So­me thirty ye­ars ago, the­re we­re left in the world only two per­sons of po­wer: my men­tor, Bon­da­nus, and Bi­nah. Bon­da­nus pas­sed his po­wer on to me. Bi­nah, aga­inst all lo­gic, wo­uld di­lu­te hers by be­qu­e­at­hing it to three of you."</p>
   <p>    "In or­der to sa­ve Ru­wen­da!" Ha­ra­mis cri­ed.</p>
   <p>    "Ruwenda…" The sor­ce­rer sho­ok his he­ad in gent­le moc­kery. "Yo­ur ta­lis­man has the po­ten­ti­al to do so much mo­re than res­cue Ru­wen­da! Bi­nah's vi­si­on, li­ke her li­fe, is dim­ming. She truly do­es not know what po­wer the Thre­efold Ta­lis­man can com­mand! But you, Ha­ra­mis, ha­ve cen­tu­ri­es ahe­ad of you in which to study and use it."</p>
   <p>    "Centuries?" Ha­ra­mis blin­ked. This had ne­ver oc­cur­red to her. <emphasis>Do­es using ma­gic pro­long li­fe-and by that much</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    "Centuries," Oro­gas­tus re­pe­ated firmly. "Always as­su­ming, of co­ur­se, that you don't ac­ci­den­tal­ly kill yo­ur­self with it." He ges­tu­red to the ta­lis­man she held.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Idiot</emphasis>! Ha­ra­mis told her­self. <emphasis>You wo­uld sit the­re hol­ding it in pla­in sight. Ap­pa­rently he re­cog­ni­zed it. But how? How much do­es he re­al­ly know abo­ut it? The Arc­hi­ma­ge se­ems unab­le to te­ach me, and I don't ha­ve ti­me to dis­co­ver its use by tri­al and er­ror</emphasis>-<emphasis>not if I want to sa­ve my king­dom and my sis­ters</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    "The Three-Win­ged Circ­le." Oro­gas­tus was smi­ling. "I am happy that you fo­und it. I ha­ve se­ve­ral bo­oks that spe­ak of it, and I ha­ve al­ways wis­hed to see it."</p>
   <p>    "You ha­ve bo­oks abo­ut it?" Ha­ra­mis as­ked. <emphasis>May­be he'd go away and le­ave me to study his lib­rary</emphasis>! "What do they say?"</p>
   <p>    "Quite a lot. Too much, I fe­ar, for me to exp­la­in to you now-you wo­uld be an icic­le be­fo­re I had told you a sixth of it." He ges­tu­red at her sur­ro­un­dings. "You ha­ve be­en so eng­ros­sed in our de­light­ful con­ver­sa­ti­on that you ha­ve ig­no­red the pas­sa­ge of ti­me."</p>
   <p>    Haramis lo­oked qu­ickly aro­und her. He was qu­ite right; the sun was low in the sky, and the ca­ve was get­ting dark and cold. She lo­oked back at the mir­ror. Oro­gas­tus's clot­hing ap­pe­ared light­we­ight, and the­re was plenty of light aro­und him.</p>
   <p>    He bec­ko­ned to her. "Co­me to my ho­me, Ha­ra­mis, to my mo­un­ta­in to­wer. Let me te­ach you to use the ta­lis­man. It wo­uld be ple­asant to ha­ve com­pany he­re. Mo­unt Brom is rat­her out of the way, and I sel­dom ha­ve vi­si­tors."</p>
   <p>    "You don't want my com­pany," Ha­ra­mis sa­id, lo­oking him stra­ight in the eyes. "You just want the ta­lis­man."</p>
   <p>    To her surp­ri­se, Oro­gas­tus ac­tu­al­ly la­ug­hed, and se­emed to me­an it. "I for­get how new this is to you. No one can ta­ke yo­ur ta­lis­man away. It is bon­ded to you, and for one who wo­uld try to ta­ke it the­re is only de­ath. But you know next to not­hing abo­ut the ta­lis­man's use. You scry with it!" He la­ug­hed. "The me­rest Od­dling co­nj­urer can do the sa­me with a le­af-full of wa­ter… No, Ha­ra­mis, you don't un­ders­tand. But I will te­ach you. I ha­ve a gre­at lib­rary and so many ma­gi­cal de­vi­ces of the Va­nis­hed Ones that they defy num­be­ring. I ask only the joy of sha­ring my know­led­ge with you. You are re­pu­ted to be qu­ite a scho­lar - do you not know the joy that co­mes from the pur­su­it of know­led­ge? The ex­qu­isi­te sa­tis­fac­ti­on when what was unc­le­ar sud­denly falls in­to a lo­gi­cal de­sign and you comp­re­hend it?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes." Ha­ra­mis fo­und her­self nod­ding in ag­re­ement. "I do know what you me­an."</p>
   <p>    "Then co­me to Mo­unt Brom," Oro­gas­tus in­vi­ted. "With the ta­lis­man you can sum­mon yo­ur lam­mer­ge­i­er to carry you to my to­wer - and be he­re in ti­me for sup­per."</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>So he do­esn't know Hi­tu­ro is he­re</emphasis>, Ha­ra­mis tho­ught. <emphasis>At le­ast he is not om­nis­ci­ent</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus's fa­ce grew gra­ve. "I swe­ar by the po­wers we sha­re that I will not se­ek to wrest the ta­lis­man from you by for­ce, nor ca­use any harm to co­me to yo­ur per­son. May my po­wers le­ave me fo­re­ver if I pro­ve fal­se to this oath." He la­id his hand over his he­art.</p>
   <p>    "So be it," Ha­ra­mis mur­mu­red auto­ma­ti­cal­ly, the for­mu­la fa­mi­li­ar to her from ye­ars of wit­nes­sing oaths. The ice-mir­ror went dark.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Well, now what</emphasis>? she won­de­red. <emphasis>Do I go to him, go to the Arc­hi­ma­ge, stay he­re, or wan­der off so­mew­he­re and see what I can do on my own</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    Neither of the last two al­ter­na­ti­ves was in the le­ast ap­pe­aling. Al­so, the Arc­hi­ma­ge had not exactly or­de­red her to re­turn im­me­di­ately. "When you ac­hi­eve yo­ur go­al of the Three-Win­ged Circ­le, re­turn to me," was what Bi­nah had sa­id. Had she me­ant simply the physi­cal pos­ses­si­on of the ta­lis­man, or was the abi­lity to use it part of ac­hi­eving the go­al?</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Since Bi­nah did not com­mand me to re­turn when she bes­po­ke me just now, per­haps she in­tends for me to mas­ter the ta­lis­man's use-and per­haps now is the ti­me I sho­uld conf­ront Oro­gas­tus.</emphasis>..</p>
   <p>    While the sor­ce­rer was un­do­ub­tedly dan­ge­ro­us, at le­ast the­re wo­uld be warmth and fo­od at his to­wer. <emphasis>The Arc­hi­ma­ge did tell me that I sho­uld le­arn his we­ak­nes­ses</emphasis>, Ha­ra­mis tho­ught. <emphasis>Pre­su­mably it is part of my des­tiny</emphasis> - <emphasis>and it will be a ni­ce chan­ge to ha­ve my des­tiny ta­king pla­ce in com­for­tab­le sur­ro­un­dings</emphasis>!… <emphasis>And if I do run in­to tro­ub­le at Mo­unt Brom , I can al­ways ask Hi­lu­ro to carry me away</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    She sud­denly be­ca­me awa­re of an inc­re­ased vib­ra­ti­on of the rock spi­re and so­unds co­ming from out­si­de the ca­ve. The thun­de­ring bass-no­tes of the grin­ding gla­ci­er blen­ded with the cla­ri­on-cri­es of the lam­mer­ge­i­er scre­ec­hing a war­ning.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Haramis! Co­me out! Dan­ger! Gre­at dan­ger!</emphasis></p>
   <p>    She thre­aded the small ring of the ta­lis­man on­to her neck-cha­in, tuc­ked the wand in­to the bo­di­ce of her dress, and step­ped over to the ca­ve ent­ran­ce. The icic­les had all bro­ken off from the to­wer's shud­de­ring, and the cham­ber wit­hin the spi­re ab­ruptly be­gan to pitch and rock li­ke a bo­at on a choppy ri­ver. Ha­ra­mis lif­ted her arms. A fa­mi­li­ar black-and-whi­te form roc­ke­ted down out of the sun and so­met­hing clo­sed abo­ut her body, snatc­hing her off the icy led­ge. She saw a bri­ef flash of gold, a clas­hing col­lap­se of ra­in­bow prisms, and a whe­eling sky, vi­olet-blue, be­hind a gre­at cres­ted he­ad.</p>
   <p>    Then the lam­mer­ge­i­er went in­to a slow gli­de, lif­ted its claw, and ca­re­ful­ly held her whi­le she clim­bed in­to the soft hol­low bet­we­en its outsp­re­ad wings. Ha­ra­mis ris­ked a qu­ick glan­ce at the pla­ce whe­re the qu­artz spi­re had be­en. Now only rock slightly less whi­te than ice mar­red the gla­ci­er's sur­fa­ce, and only a few bits of gold glin­ted in the set­ting sun.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Nine</strong></p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    There pas­sed a night, and Ka­di­ya slept bet­we­en the sin­do­na at the he­ad of the sta­irs. She had ma­de free with the bo­unty of the gar­den for fo­od, but she had a fe­eling that to lin­ger the­re was wrong. The li­ving sen­ti­nel had not co­me aga­in. Ka­di­ya did not ex­pect her as she lay, one hand tightly grip­ping her amu­let. It was not true sle­ep in­to which she drif­ted, awo­ke, and drif­ted aga­in.</p>
   <p>    That the in­va­ders had so­me­how ga­ined a way in­to this for­bid­den land she had al­re­ady fo­und pro­of. And the­re was Jagun-wo­uld he fall cap­ti­ve to so­me sco­uting party and end as had the po­or rem­nant of a Uis­gu who had be­so­ught her mercy?</p>
   <p>    Where sho­uld she go now? Ret­ra­ce her path - fa­ce tho­se who had hun­ted her he­re and might still wa­it to pull her down? That was she­er stu­pi­dity. Yet she had no gu­ide, and to wan­der out in­to that stran­ge gar­den wo­uld do her lit­tle go­od. To her right ran a lofty wall; she wo­uld fol­low it.</p>
   <p>    Jagun's hun­ter's bag, which had got­ten hard usa­ge, she had emp­ti­ed and dri­ed last night. She had had to dis­card so­me of the small pac­kets in it, for by the ti­me she had fis­hed the bag out of the po­ol they we­re tho­ro­ughly so­aked. She had gat­he­red edib­le tu­bers from the gar­den, wo­ven a lop­si­ded net of grass to carry fru­it, and re­fil­led the wa­ter bot­tle. The­re was not­hing mo­re to ke­ep her he­re, yet Ka­di­ya tur­ned on­ce mo­re to lo­ok in­to the gar­den. For­bid­den it might be, yet the­re was so­met­hing he­re that re­ac­hed out to her-that had se­emed to wel­co­me her even in spi­te of the chilly de­me­anor of the sen­ti­nel.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya sig­hed and sho­ul­de­red her bag. For her ta­lis­man she had de­vi­sed a tem­po­rary she­ath and slung it ac­ross one sho­ul­der, and its ste­ady we­ight the­re con­ti­nu­ed to re­as­su­re her that at le­ast she had ful­fil­led a part of her qu­est. One sword-when an army was what she truly ne­eded!</p>
   <p>    She wal­ked for so­me ways along the high wall; and then it en­ded at a mighty ga­te­way, and she saw wit­hin a bro­ad stretch of park, and be­yond that a gle­aming city. Awed, she en­te­red the ga­te and ap­pro­ac­hed the pla­ce. Gre­enery half-smot­he­red the si­lent ho­uses, and grass and vi­nes car­pe­ted the stre­ets. Yet be­ne­ath that as­sa­ult of ve­ge­ta­ti­on the­re was no sign of de­cay. The walls which sho­wed thro­ugh the shaggy dra­pery we­re not ma­de of sto­ne, she was cer­ta­in, but rat­her of that sa­me pe­cu­li­ar subs­tan­ce that had for­med the bowl in which she and Jagun had spent the night.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya sud­denly re­ali­zed she was se­e­ing the city of her dre­am. Mo­re walls ro­se be­yond, enc­lo­sing it. She ca­me in­to a wi­de ave­nue and wal­ked on, mar­ve­ling. The bu­il­dings on eit­her si­de we­re well pro­por­ti­oned, and abo­ut the­ir do­or­ways and win­dows we­re in­de­cip­he­rab­le pat­terns in high re­li­ef. The ave­nue even­tu­al­ly led her to a ga­te ne­arly as tall as a three-story bu­il­ding. It sto­od aj­ar, and Ka­di­ya wal­ked out in­to a far dif­fe­rent world whe­re on­ce aga­in the swamp ru­led - tho­ugh the much worn re­ma­ins of a ro­ad led off in­to it. What ti­me had not to­uc­hed wit­hin the city walls had be­en con­qu­ered he­re.</p>
   <p>    Luckily that ero­ded path had not be­en to­tal­ly ob­li­te­ra­ted. She ca­ught glimp­ses of the omi­no­us yel­low scum on eit­her si­de of the ro­ad­way, but fo­oting upon it ap­pe­ared subs­tan­ti­al eno­ugh. She stop­ped to cut a sturdy branch from a bush and use it to test the gro­und be­fo­re she trus­ted her we­ight to it.</p>
   <p>    She had co­me well out in­to the Mi­re when she tur­ned to lo­ok back- and then sho­ok her he­ad, unab­le to be­li­eve her eyes. What lay be­hind her now we­re bro­ken ru­ins. Even the wall was tumb­le­down and overg­rown by ram­pant jung­le growth. Il­lu­si­on!</p>
   <p>    But <emphasis>which</emphasis> was the il­lu­si­on then - the myste­ri­o­us gar­den and the dre­am-city, or this? Had everyt­hing that had hap­pe­ned to her be­en enc­hant­ment? Yet, the­re was the we­ight of the ta­lis­man on her sho­ul­der, and she ra­ised her hand to fe­el the knobs of the Three-Lo­bed Bur­ning Eye.</p>
   <p>    She wal­ked on for what might ha­ve be­en se­ve­ral ho­urs, se­e­ing not­hing unu­su­al and he­aring only the nor­mal so­unds of the swamp. Jud­ging by the light of the sun, which al­ways se­emed to be in a ha­ze he­re, it was mid­day or a lit­tle la­ter. The­re we­re thic­kets of thorn-fern and high bramb­les ahe­ad.</p>
   <p>    And then she he­ard it - the dis­tinc­ti­ve chirp of a ras be­et­le, vo­iced three ti­mes in a fa­mi­li­ar rhythm. Jagun! It must be!</p>
   <p>    There was a slight mo­ve­ment in the bus­hes, and then she saw the fa­ce of her de­ar old fri­end grin­ning out at her. A dark spot of bru­ise puf­fed aro­und one eye. That he had had no easy ti­me of it was cle­ar, for he wo­re a mass of pul­ped le­aves ti­ed with re­ed strings abo­ut his up­per arm ne­ar the sho­ul­der po­int, and he mo­ved awk­wardly.</p>
   <p>    Nor did he was­te any ti­me on gre­etings:</p>
   <p>    "They are he­re - the Skri­tek and sol­di­ers."</p>
   <p>    She tho­ught of tho­se pat­he­tic fi­gu­res she had se­en along the ot­her ro­ad - and al­so of the dis­tant bon­fi­re, and the ar­row that had mar­ked a ro­ute… for so­me­one. "I ha­ve se­en signs that the enemy is ne­ar at hand."</p>
   <p>    Jagun's fa­ce was a mask, and his at­ten­ti­on was not re­al­ly on her, but on his own tho­ughts. "The Fe­ast of the Three Mo­ons ne­ars," he whis­pe­red, "and the dark­ness gat­hers! But so­on the­re will be fi­re ap­lenty, and it will be qu­enc­hed only by blo­od…"</p>
   <p>    The Fe­ast of the Three Mo­ons. They had al­ways ce­leb­ra­ted it at the Ci­ta­del with fe­as­ting, and stran­ge old songs had be­en sung by the bards, and a raft lo­osed on the ri­ver la­den down with flo­wers and ligh­ted by three-pron­ged cand­les. It was a ti­me when the thre­at of an­ci­ent evil was dri­ven away by the will of all. And when the three orbs sho­ne high in the sky, clo­se to­get­her in mystic co­nj­unc­ti­on, the pe­op­le re­j­o­iced be­ne­ath the­ir be­ne­vo­lent ra­di­an­ce, and sang. But what did Jagun me­an? Might he ha­ve fo­re­se­en so­me gre­at bat­tle up­co­ming at the ti­me of the an­ci­ent ce­leb­ra­ti­on? A bat­tle in which she might wi­eld her ta­lis­man to the li­be­ra­ti­on of Ru­wen­da?</p>
   <p>    Before Ka­di­ya co­uld qu­es­ti­on him furt­her, Jagun sa­id: "The Skri­tek-and with them the sor­ce­rer's Vo­ice and a party of hu­man sol­di­ers- ha­ve fal­len upon a Uis­gu vil­la­ge. Fi­re they used, and ma­gic sum­mo­ned out of the air. The Folk they still hold cap­ti­ve will so­on be me­at for the Skri­tek."</p>
   <p>    "They se­ek me!" Ka­di­ya cri­ed. "This is why they harry the po­or Uis­gu!"</p>
   <p>    "Your cap­tu­re wo­uld be a gre­at tri­umph. But mo­re than that draws them." He nod­ded back to­ward whe­re the city of the gar­den lay hid­den by il­lu­si­on. "You ha­ve be­en the­re. And ha­ve you al­so ful­fil­led yo­ur qu­est?"</p>
   <p>    Wordless, Ka­di­ya to­ok the ta­lis­man from be­hind her back and held it up for him to see.</p>
   <p>    Though she had known Jagun sin­ce she had first be­gun wal­king, she had ne­ver se­en such an exp­res­si­on of joy and exal­ta­ti­on upon his fa­ce. He half put out his hand as if to to­uch the we­apon, but then held back. The black lo­bes at the hilt re­ma­ined clo­sed, dull, but the bla­de drew what we­ak sun­light the­re was to it.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya held the sword clo­ser to him. Te­ars we­re po­uring down his che­eks. He fell to his kne­es be­fo­re her. "The ta­lis­man! Oh, Far-se­er…you ha­ve fo­und it!"</p>
   <p>    "There is a cus­tom of my pe­op­le," she sa­id slowly, "that a sword with a bro­ken po­int stands for mercy." She sho­ok her he­ad. "To so­me I will not of­fer mercy. But to you -" She he­si­ta­ted and then the sword gently to­uc­hed Jagun on the he­ad, and from so­me pla­ce she did not un­ders­tand the­re ca­me words of ab­so­lu­ti­on:</p>
   <p>    "My de­ar fri­end, be of go­od he­art. Ta­ke back yo­ur own na­me! We­ar aga­in the sac­red arm­let of the Nysso­mu. You ha­ve bro­ken no oath - you ha­ve only fol­lo­wed the co­ur­se of things as they had to be. Be­ar no so­ul bur­den from this ti­me."</p>
   <p>    Then Jagun did what Ka­di­ya had ne­ver se­en be­fo­re. When he had first co­me to the Ci­ta­del and spo­ken to her Fat­her King Kra­in, he had sa­lu­ted the mo­narch with both hands high in the man­ner she had se­en him gre­et the First of the Ho­use in the vil­la­ge whe­re they had sta­yed. But now his who­le body inc­li­ned for­ward un­til his arms and fo­re­he­ad to­uc­hed the earth.</p>
   <p>    "All ser­vi­ce to you, Light Be­arer, Ho­pe Car­ri­er, Pro­tec­tor and De­fen­der-he­art-kin of the Va­nis­hed Ones!"</p>
   <p>    Bemused, she held up the ta­lis­man. It was as if a far off ec­ho re­ver­be­ra­ted his words. Yet so­met­hing in her shrank, wan­ted not­hing mo­re than to thrust the ma­gi­cal bla­de back in­to the gro­und, to re­turn it to what it had be­en-the ro­ot of the Black Tril­li­um.</p>
   <p>    "Jagun, I do not know what you me­an-"</p>
   <p>    He clim­bed to his fe­et and lo­oked her eye to eye, the sturdy Mas­ter of Ani­mals and ro­yal hunts­man of old. "Lady of the Eyes, le­ar­ning shall be yo­urs. And no­ne will be cal­led whe­re they we­re not me­ant to ser­ve."</p>
   <p>    "I do not know how to use this ta­lis­man," she pro­tes­ted. Ne­ver held she felt so at a loss. Even the ra­ge which had al­ways gi­ven her strength be­fo­re was now mis­sing.</p>
   <p>    "That know­led­ge, too, will co­me. Now you must be­gin the true work you we­re des­ti­ned for."</p>
   <p>    She to­ok a de­ep bre­ath, then re­tur­ned the ta­lis­man to its imp­ro­vi­sed she­ath. "Very well. The­se be­le­agu­ered Uis­gu," she sa­id now, briskly. "Whe­re are they?"</p>
   <p>    "Near the Up­per Mu­tar. I he­ard them send out the Call, but it will be too long be­fo­re they can be ans­we­red by ot­her Folk. The Skri­tek" - his lips flat­te­ned, sho­wing the sharply po­in­ted small fangs so un­li­ke her own te­eth - "are not easily kept un­der cont­rol. They must be re­war­ded by blo­od… and flesh."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya swal­lo­wed. But she as­ked, re­so­lu­tely: "Is the­re so­me way that we can aid the cap­ti­ve Uis­gu?"</p>
   <p>    "Farseer, I wo­uld say such a de­ed is im­pos­sib­le. But to you the For­bid­den Way was ope­ned, and you be­ar that which is thre­efold. We shall see."</p>
   <p>    "Then let us be off," she sa­id.</p>
   <p>    They no lon­ger fol­lo­wed the ro­ad but to­ok to a tor­tu­o­us path thro­ugh the bro­ken lands of the Thorny Hell. When eve­ning was ne­ar they so­ught a camp­si­te, sin­ce they co­uld not fol­low the tra­il thro­ugh the night on land. But be­fo­re they co­uld bed down, a fa­mi­li­ar and ter­rif­ying stench ca­me fa­intly to them on the bre­eze. The Skri­tek we­re ne­arby!</p>
   <p>    Jagun had them both rub down with wads of ac­rid-smel­ling le­aves that wo­uld mask the­ir scent. Then he drop­ped belly down whi­le the girl fol­lo­wed his examp­le, and the two of them slit­he­red thro­ugh the un­derb­rush. Mo­ments la­ter they cro­uc­hed sho­ul­der to sho­ul­der, hid­den be­hind the trunk­li­ke stems of the gi­ant ferns, to lo­ok out on an open area.</p>
   <p>    It was a camp of sorts. A hand­ful of men in rusty ar­mor we­re gat­he­red the­re, La­bor­no­ki sol­di­ers. Bet­we­en them and whe­re Ka­di­ya and Jagun cro­uc­hed in hi­ding spe­ars had be­en dri­ven in­to the gro­und and ro­ped to­get­her by twis­ted vi­nes to form a pen. A pen fil­led with cap­ti­ves. No­ne we­re ma­les. Abo­ut a do­zen abo­ri­gi­nal wo­men sat or lay in small gro­ups wit­hin the ca­ge. Two had child­ren in the­ir arms. The­re was abo­ut them such an air of mi­sery and fe­ar that Ka­di­ya felt her he­art cont­ract. Her hand so­ught the ta­lis­man-sword and she ste­alt­hily drew it.</p>
   <p>    There ca­me a fa­int wa­il, and one of the wo­men clap­ped her hand over the mo­uth of a child. Fo­ur Skri­tek sto­od gu­ard at the cor­ners of the pen. One flung up his long-jawed he­ad and bel­lo­wed, then to­ok aim with his spe­ar at the Uis­gu wo­man hol­ding the crying child.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya lo­we­red the sword, alt­ho­ugh she still kept her left hand on its hilt whi­le her right went to her kni­fe-scab­bard. The­re was a way of thro­wing her dag­ger she had le­ar­ned only last se­ason by watc­hing a per­for­mer at a fa­ir, and she had ma­de it her own by much prac­ti­ce. She was su­re she co­uld hit the thro­at of the ne­arest Skri­tek gu­ard! Oh, if she had only three or fo­ur arc­hers at her back!</p>
   <p>    But she did not… and per­for­ce cont­rol­led her­self. The ot­her Skri­tek la­ug­hed, and se­emed to ur­ge the­ir fel­low to fling his spe­ar at the crin­ging mot­her and child.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya to­ok hold of Jagun's arm. Co­uld they not do <emphasis>so­met­hing</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    He ope­ned his own left hand for an ins­tant. On his palm res­ted a gre­en lump which he held with the gre­atest ca­re. It was an awo­rik, a stran­ge fun­gus, hard to find but a go­od fri­end to any pur­su­ed by one of the lar­ge pre­da­tors of the swamp.</p>
   <p>    But the enemy mo­ved first. Two hu­man sol­di­ers ca­me out of the thorn-ferns, drag­ging a Uis­gu ma­le bet­we­en them. The Skri­tek me­na­cing the mot­her he­si­ta­ted, then lo­we­red his spe­ar.</p>
   <p>    While the at­ten­ti­on of the in­va­ders was cen­te­red on the new cap­ti­ve, Jagun drew out his blow­gun. Ri­sing to one knee, he flung the awo­rik with all his might, aiming at a pla­ce bet­we­en the hu­man sol­di­ers and the pri­so­ner pen. The brit­tle fun­gus shat­te­red as it hit the gro­und, and from its shell flew a myri­ad of whir­ling spo­re-car­ri­ers, each one sharp-edged as a ra­zor for all its bu­oyancy. Ins­tantly, all of the cap­ti­ve Uis­gu drop­ped to the gro­und, shi­el­ding the­ir gre­at eyes. But the Skri­tek and the La­bor­no­ki we­re ta­ken by surp­ri­se. Tho­se who we­re not blin­ded at on­ce fell in­to a frenzy as the tiny awo­rik bla­des slas­hed the vul­ne­rab­le parts of the­ir flesh be­fo­re fi­nal­ly set­tling to the gro­und.</p>
   <p>    Jagun al­re­ady had his blow­gun re­ady and Ka­di­ya he­ard the hiss of the first po­iso­ned dart even if she did not sight its swift pas­sa­ge. One Skri­tek fell. With her ta­lis­man in one hand and her dag­ger re­ady in the ot­her, the Prin­cess le­aped to her fe­et. The Skri­tek ne­arest her stag­ge­red sight­less, wa­ving his spe­ar. The girl sent the dag­ger in the whir­ling throw she had prac­ti­ced so long. It struck the soft thro­at of the mons­ter and he cras­hed to the gro­und, thras­hing in his de­ath-thro­es. Mo­re po­iso­ned darts from Jagun's pi­pe dow­ned the ot­her two Skri­tek. A blo­ody-fa­ced sol­di­er ca­me at them with a short-sword, but Ka­di­ya was re­ady for him, her ta­lis­man-sword up­ra­ised as if she we­re a tra­ined Oat­hed Com­pa­ni­on. She swung and felt the jar thro­ug­ho­ut her body as the ta­lis­man crus­hed the man's vo­ice-box. He fell, strang­ling in his own blo­od. She sto­od stun­ned for a mo­ment, unab­le to be­li­eve that she had be­en so ab­le to use the ma­gi­cal sword.</p>
   <p>    There was a din of scre­ams and cri­es. Jagun's darts we­re ta­king a toll of the re­ma­ining La­bor­no­ki sol­di­ers. Dying Skri­tek ro­ared and fla­iled the­ir gre­at limbs, go­uging the earth with the­ir ta­lons. Ka­di­ya ra­ised the sword a se­cond ti­me and bro­ught its dull ed­ge down on the net­ting of ro­pe which for­med the wall of the pen. The vi­ne par­ted as if mel­ted, not cut.</p>
   <p>    "Out!" she scre­amed to the fe­ma­les in­si­de, most of whom we­re al­re­ady on the­ir fe­et. Ka­di­ya po­in­ted with the sword. "Run! In­to the thorn-ferns!"</p>
   <p>    They fled, Ka­di­ya at the­ir he­els re­ady for any at­tack from ot­her Skri­tek or sol­di­ers. Jagun fol­lo­wed, ha­ving ret­ri­eved the Prin­cess's dag­ger from the flesh of the mons­ter she had sla­in.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya and the Uis­gu ca­me to a gre­at ri­ver, un­do­ub­tedly the Up­per Mu­tar, whe­re a raft flo­ated be­si­de a lar­ge bar­ge such as tra­ders used. The­re we­re fo­ur sol­di­ers the­re, slightly be­wil­de­red by the cla­mor they he­ard in the dis­tan­ce, and a sing­le Skri­tek just ri­sing out of the wa­ter with his jaws clo­sed upon a writ­hing fish.</p>
   <p>    "Jagun!" Ka­di­ya to­ok in the­ir pe­ril in a se­cond. They ne­eded the hun­ter with his po­iso­ned darts. She was no match for what fa­ced them. But Jagun had lag­ged be­hind, ma­king cer­ta­in they we­re not fol­lo­wed.</p>
   <p>    The La­bor­no­ki sol­di­ers, swords drawn, we­re mo­ving to ring her ro­und. Scre­ams of ter­ror ca­me from the fe­ma­le Od­dlings as the hu­ge Skri­tek splas­hed to­ward them.</p>
   <p>    The girl felt a sud­den warmth aga­inst her hand, so much that she shif­ted her grip from the hilt of the ta­lis­man-sword to the po­int­less and dul­led bla­de, brin­ging it up be­fo­re her. The three eyes on the pom­mel we­re open, re­gar­ding the ne­arest of the swords­men mo­ving in on her.</p>
   <p>    He ga­ve a ho­ar­se cry and stag­ge­red back, drop­ping his we­apon and hol­ding his hands to his own eyes. Ka­di­ya did not know what had hap­pe­ned, she co­uld only gu­ess. She tur­ned the ta­lis­man to­ward anot­her sol­di­er. This one scre­amed and blun­de­red in­to his blin­ded fel­low, who im­me­di­ately whir­led and cut at his third com­ra­de, stri­king a mor­tal blow. Ka­di­ya tur­ned the sword to the last man. But he had se­en what had hap­pe­ned to the ot­hers and he duc­ked, thro­wing him­self for­ward to tack­le her. Then he twis­ted and scre­amed. From the back of his neck prot­ru­ded one of Jagun's po­iso­ned darts. A tre­men­do­us splash ca­me from the ri­ver as the Skri­tek was struck by anot­her dart. As Jagun ran up, the two sur­vi­ving sight­less sol­di­ers con­ti­nu­ed to hack at each ot­her as if they had go­ne mad. Jagun sho­uted for them all to climb on­to the raft. He sli­ced its mo­oring ro­pe with Ka­di­ya's dag­ger and tos­sed the bla­de on bo­ard. Two of the Uis­gu wo­men had pic­ked up swords, and ot­hers re­adi­ed the raft's po­les.</p>
   <p>    "Quickly!" Jagun sho­uted. "Mo­re Skri­tek are co­ming! Cast off!" Ka­di­ya has­te­ned to help the wo­un­ded climb abo­ard. The po­les dug in and the raft res­pon­ded. One of the wo­men star­ted a dro­ning chant of the ri­ver pe­op­le, and the ones at the po­les res­pon­ded with ac­ce­le­ra­ted swings. Then the po­wer­ful cur­rent to­ok them.</p>
   <p>    "Jagun!" the Prin­cess scre­amed. But he only sho­ok his he­ad, and then tur­ned to conf­ront fi­ve how­ling Skri­tek that burst out of the ferns. Help­less, the girl watc­hed him lift his blow­pi­pe aga­inst the char­ging mons­ters… and then the raft flo­ated aro­und a bend in the ri­ver, and Jagun's bra­ve lit­tle fi­gu­re was lost to sight.</p>
   <p>    The only we­apons they had we­re the two swords, Ka­di­ya's dag­ger, and the ta­lis­man. The Uis­gu fe­ma­les did not even we­ar much in the way of clot­hing sa­ve the­ir own bed­rag­gled fur. The­re we­re ele­ven of them all told, and the two tiny child­ren. Fo­ur of the abo­ri­gi­nes wo­re le­af ban­da­ges mat­ted with blo­ods­ta­ins, whi­le many of the ot­hers nur­sed cuts from the awo­rik spo­re-ca­ses or bru­ises de­alt by the­ir for­mer cap­tors.</p>
   <p>    "Lady?"</p>
   <p>    Kadiya had be­en mo­ur­ning Jagun, but now she lif­ted her he­ad. One of the Uis­gu wo­men had se­ated her­self ne­arby.</p>
   <p>    "I am Nes­sak of De­za­ras, on­ce First of the Ho­use and Spe­aker of the Law. The­se" - one outf­lung arm in­di­ca­ted the ot­hers - "are al­so of the vil­la­ge of De­za­ras. Mis­for­tu­ne ca­me upon us as we jo­ur­ne­yed. Our men the hu­man sol­di­ers ga­ve to the Skri­tek and we we­re ma­de to watch. The­se in­va­ders se­ek sec­rets, Gre­at Lady, which we ha­ve no know­led­ge of. For it is oath-bo­und upon us that we must not go in­to the for­bid­den pla­ce of the Va­nis­hed Ones - this pla­ce which has ever and ever be­en clo­sed. When we co­uld not spe­ak of what we do not know, the hu­man who led the ot­hers, one dres­sed all in red, or­de­red that we be held for the co­ming of mo­re hu­mans who walk with Skri­tek and se­ek to ra­ise Dark aga­inst Light. This man went away down the ri­ver shortly be­fo­re you ca­me and res­cu­ed us… Now we are yo­ur ser­vants fo­re­ver, Lady, and we thank you for our de­li­ve­ran­ce. Will you tell us who you are and when­ce you co­me?"</p>
   <p>    "I am da­ugh­ter to King Kra­in who was - and my na­me is Ka­di­ya. The­se wor­kers of evil ha­ve ta­ken our land. My Fat­her di­ed of the­ir cru­elty, as did all tho­se who fol­lo­wed him. My Mot­her al­so."</p>
   <p>    She ca­ught her bre­ath for a mo­ment, lo­oking dull-eyed down at the ta­lis­man. If she had only had it when the La­bor­no­ki in­va­ded the Ci­ta­del! It had in so­me way de­fe­ated tho­se sol­di­ers -what might it ha­ve wro­ught upon King Volt­rik him­self?</p>
   <p>    "There was a prop­hecy," the Prin­cess con­ti­nu­ed, stro­king the clo­sed eyes of the pom­mel, "that the de­fe­at of the­se evil­do­ers wo­uld co­me thro­ugh a wo­man of my ho­use. My two sis­ters and I jo­ur­ne­yed forth, com­man­ded by the Arc­hi­ma­ge Bi­nah, she whom you call the Whi­te Lady, in se­arch of that which wo­uld aven­ge our kin."</p>
   <p>    For the first ti­me in what se­emed li­ke days, she tho­ught of Ani­gel and of Ha­ra­mis. How had they fa­red? We­re both de­ad, and she the only one left to de­mand de­ath pri­ce for the­ir ho­use?</p>
   <p>    "Anigel… Ha­ra­mis…" She spo­ke the­ir na­mes alo­ud as if she cal­led to them.</p>
   <p>    Under her hand the­re was mo­ve­ment. She snatc­hed her palm from the pom­mel of the sword. Two of the eyes we­re ope­ning! Eyes? No, not this ti­me. Ins­te­ad she saw two tiny pic­tu­res -vi­si­ons! The­re was Ha­ra­mis, in her hand a Black Tril­li­um full ope­ned. And Ani­gel next, cup­ping in her palms a si­mi­lar one. Ka­di­ya had no do­ubt now that her sis­ters did li­ve, and that so­mew­he­re they awa­ited her and the ho­ur of the­ir mu­tu­al tri­al. Even as she was as­su­red of that the eye­lids clo­sed and she lo­oked on­ce mo­re on the blank sphe­res of the pom­mel. Ka­di­ya sig­hed.</p>
   <p>    "Lady," the Uis­gu wo­man sa­id gra­vely, "it is pla­in that you are the Light Be­arer, the Ho­pe Car­ri­er - the Lady of the Eyes who is kin to the Va­nis­hed Ones."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya sho­ok her he­ad ve­he­mently. "No, Spe­aker of the Law, I cla­im no kins­hip with the gre­at ones of old, alt­ho­ugh this" - she drew her hand down the ta­lis­man -"might well ha­ve co­me from out of the­ir far ti­me. I do not know how I can be­ar light or carry ho­pe. All I am su­re of is that I must bring down King Volt­rik and his sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus, even if I must do so alo­ne."</p>
   <p>    "Lady," Nes­sak sa­id softly, "you do not stand alo­ne. Tho­se wic­ked ones who to­ok us bro­ke the gre­at oath and met the­ir pu­nish­ment. You ha­ve be­en in­to the Pla­ce of Know­led­ge and pas­sed harm­less be­fo­re the gu­ar­di­an sin­do­na. You ha­ve be­en sent to <emphasis>IM</emphasis>. You are the Lady of the Eyes -the one long awa­ited. So shall the Uis­gu ri­se to yo­ur aid, tho­ugh war has ever be­en for­bid­den us. Dark­ness walks the land, the gre­at ba­lan­ce has be­en dest­ro­yed, and from the strug­gle en­su­ing no one stands apart! On­ce we re­ach De­za­ras the Call will go forth and the Folk of the Uis­gu ra­ce will march be­si­de you."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya ca­ught her bre­ath. What she had sug­ges­ted to Jagun, what she had be­en told co­uld ne­ver hap­pen now wo­uld co­me to pass.

   <p>    The ri­mo­riks swam down the ri­ver pus­hing Ani­gel in the bo­at for three mo­re days. So­me­ti­mes the ma­in chan­nel twis­ted ne­ar the fo­res­ted bank, and the Prin­cess ga­zed with awe at the stran­ge tre­es. So­me we­re very tall, with branc­hes that lo­oped and cur­ved up­ward li­ke a dan­cer's si­nu­o­us arms. So­me had qu­a­intly cor­ru­ga­ted trunks, as if tho­usands of rings we­re pi­led one upon anot­her, and slan­ted off-cen­ter this way and that in a man­ner that se­emed to defy gra­vity. The­re we­re mas­si­ve, squ­at tre­es li­ke gar­gan­tu­an tu­bers, bro­ad at the gro­und and po­in­ted at the top, spro­uting a lu­dic­ro­us crown of tiny branc­hes with le­aves that ne­ver ce­ased to tremb­le. The­re we­re gro­ves of splen­did gon­da-tre­es, highly va­lu­ed for const­ruc­ti­on, lar­ger than any that grew in the Mazy Mi­re. The­ir hu­ge co­lum­nar trunks we­re each wi­der than the gre­at ma­in ga­te of the Ci­ta­del, for­ming hus­hed gre­en ar­ca­des lit by slan­ting gol­den sun­be­ams. The­re we­re flo­we­ring tre­es so pac­ked with vi­vid scar­let and oran­ge blos­soms that they se­emed afi­re. The­re we­re hul­king, shab­by-le­afed tre­es with gnar­led limbs and ga­ping ho­les in the­ir trunks, which har­bo­red no­isy co­lo­ni­es of night-ca­ro­lers. The va­ri­ety of tre­es was so gre­at that Ani­gel's mind was fi­nal­ly overw­hel­med by them, and she was glad when the ri­ver's ma­inst­re­am car­ri­ed them far away from the banks.</p>
   <p>    It was ob­vi­o­us that du­ring the Ra­ins the wi­de, ne­arly empty bed of the Gre­at Mu­tar ran brim-full in flo­od. The furt­her downst­re­am they tra­ve­led, the mo­re gre­at stacks of drift­wo­od lit­te­red the chan­nel, the dry ble­ac­hed branc­hes of­ten brightly clot­hed in ske­ins of flo­we­ring vi­nes. Hu­ge flocks of birds in­ha­bi­ted the bot­tom­land, fe­eding on the mudf­lats and in the shal­lows, and ri­sing in­to the air squ­aw­king and shri­eking when the bo­at sped thro­ugh the­ir midst. The­re we­re oc­ca­si­onal ani­mals to be se­en - fat gray qu­ad­ru­peds with ga­ping mo­uths that fed on aqu­atic plants in the slo­ughs, lit­he fish-eating car­ni­vo­res re­semb­ling gi­ant pel­riks, that the ri­mo­riks gre­eted as com­ra­des, and al­ways num­bers of the harm­less lit­tle yel­low-stri­ped cre­atu­res that had awa­ke­ned Ani­gel to the Tas­sa­le­yo, that swar­med abo­ut the sho­re ve­ge­ta­ti­on and al­so li­ved on the ri­ver is­lands.</p>
   <p>    But no pe­op­le.</p>
   <p>    Anigel qu­es­ti­oned her fri­ends abo­ut this. They told her that the Wyvi­lo had, for long ye­ars now, li­ved in only one lar­ge vil­la­ge. They so­ught sa­fety in num­bers, rat­her li­ke cer­ta­in fish or birds, sin­ce they we­re end­les­sly pre­yed upon by the­ir Glis­mak co­usins who li­ved downst­re­am and in the depths of the in­ner fo­rest.</p>
   <p>    Long ago, the ri­mo­riks sa­id, the Wyvi­lo had had no per­ma­nent abo­de and li­ved in small fa­mily gro­ups. They had rat­her easily avo­ided the­ir clum­si­er Glis­mak fo­es by ne­ver sle­eping twi­ce in the sa­me pla­ce. But af­ter the Wyvi­lo be­gan tra­ding with hu­man­kind they ac­cu­mu­la­ted many things and we­re no lon­ger ab­le to wan­der. They be­ca­me mo­re and mo­re rich as the­ir li­ves we­re mo­re en­dan­ge­red by the en­vi­o­us Glis­mak.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>But they will not go back to the­ir old ways. Such a pass wo­uld be worst to them than de­ath. We can­not un­ders­tand this.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "But I do," sa­id the Prin­cess to the ri­mo­riks. "Hu­mans ha­ve had a si­mi­lar his­tory. The­re is that wit­hin cer­ta­in pe­op­le that dri­ves them al­ways to do bet­ter, to le­arn mo­re, to stri­ve har­der, to climb hig­her. Not all pe­op­le are this way, but the ur­ge is easily pas­sed from pa­rent to child. It is not a bad thing. It is a gre­at mystery that the mo­ti­ve-po­wer of the world dri­ves li­ving things - es­pe­ci­al­ly thin­king per­sons - ever to grow mo­re comp­lex-when one wo­uld think they wo­uld ti­re of pres­sing on and fall back in­to simp­li­city, as a fi­re falls in­to as­hes. The very old among us do grow ti­red. But the­re al­ways se­em to be new yo­ung ones eager to dri­ve furt­her on, to li­ve bet­ter and bet­ter."</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Humans and Folk are then akin.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "I - I sup­po­se we are. But I do not know for cer­ta­in. The abo­ri­gi­nes-the pe­op­le you call Folk - are sa­id by our wi­se ones to be­long truly to this world. We hu­mans do not."</p>
   <p>    The ri­mo­riks la­ug­hed. <emphasis>Oh, yes you do</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    Anigel chi­ded them. "I am no scho­lar, but I ha­ve be­en ta­ught this by the fi­nest te­ac­hers. My sis­ter Ha­ra­mis, who is very cle­ver, as­su­res me that it is true. And it is a be­li­ef not only of Ru­wen­di­ans, but of ot­her hu­man na­ti­ons as well."</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Humans wal­ked this world be­fo­re the swamp Folk, be­fo­re the mo­un­ta­in Folk, be­fo­re the fa­irest Folk. Only the gre­at Brow­ners wal­ked the world ear­li­er.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Anigel was skep­ti­cal. "How do you know? You are only ani­mals!"</p>
   <p>    But the ri­mo­riks only la­ug­hed aga­in, and wo­uld not spe­ak of the mat­ter furt­her, and a few mo­ments la­ter Ani­gel ca­ught her first glimp­se of the Wyvi­lo set­tle­ment, and she co­uld not be bot­he­red thin­king furt­her abo­ut myste­ri­es.</p>
   <p>    The Wyvi­lo ob­vi­o­usly knew that she was co­ming.</p>
   <p>    A fle­et of mo­re than thirty of the slen­der, trans­lu­cent ca­no­es put out from the sho­re and ca­me spe­eding to­ward her. Each craft car­ri­ed a co­up­le of do­zen abo­ri­gi­nal pad­dlers, with a coxs­wa­in stan­ding pro­udly in the bow, ges­tu­ring to di­rect his crew.</p>
   <p>    "I think we had bet­ter stop," Ani­gel told the ri­mo­riks une­asily. "By the Flo­wer, the­re are a lot of them! Will you-will you po­ke yo­ur he­ads out of the wa­ter and lo­ok pro­tec­ti­ve?"</p>
   <p>    Two splas­hes res­pon­ded, and the big ani­mals grin­ned at her, then tur­ned the­ir eyes to the ap­pro­ac­hing fle­et.</p>
   <p>    The Wyvi­lo vil­la­ge was spre­ad out over a lar­ge cle­ared area that the Prin­cess la­ter le­ar­ned was an is­land sur­ro­un­ded by ar­ti­fi­ci­al­ly de­epe­ned chan­nels. The sho­re­li­ne brist­led with small docks, at which we­re ti­ed many mo­re of the light­we­ight, gle­aming ves­sels. (The ri­mo­riks had told her that the ca­noe-ma­king ma­te­ri­al ca­me from the swim-blad­der of a gi­gan­tic ri­ver fish.) The ho­uses, all on stilts, we­re be­a­uti­ful­ly const­ruc­ted of pe­eled logs, with sha­ke ro­ofs, shut­ters, and every kind of bal­cony and sur­ro­un­ding deck-the lat­ter crow­ded with spec­ta­tors. Most of the dwel­lings we­re con­nec­ted by rat­her ric­kety-lo­oking aeri­al walk­ways.</p>
   <p>    A por­ti­on of the vil­la­ge that lay fart­hest downst­re­am had evi­dently be­en struck by fi­re re­cently. Blac­ke­ned struc­tu­res we­re in the pro­cess of be­ing torn down and new bu­il­ding fra­mes we­re ri­sing from the ru­ins. Stran­gely eno­ugh, the Wyvi­lo had no tre­es at all in the­ir vil­la­ge; but the­re we­re mas­ses of shrub­bery and gar­den plots down on the gro­und, and many of the mossy sha­ke ro­ofs had flo­wers gro­wing on them.</p>
   <p>    When the le­ading Wyvi­lo bo­at was abo­ut ten ells away from Ani­gel's mo­ti­on­less craft, it ha­uled up short. The ot­hers stop­ped be­si­de it, for­ming a so­lid li­ne of bo­ats jam-pac­ked with ga­ping Od­dlings, who we­re very dif­fe­rent in physi­cal ap­pe­aran­ce from tho­se that the Prin­cess had se­en be­fo­re.</p>
   <p>    They we­re tal­ler than the Nysso­mu and Uis­gu swamp-dwel­lers of the north, abo­ut the si­ze of strap­ping adult hu­mans. The­ir he­ads we­re elon­ga­ted, not ro­un­ded, and the­ir no­ses re­semb­led small sno­uts. Wyvi­lo eyes we­re mo­re fa­mi­li­arly abo­ri­gi­nal, be­ing lar­ge and yel­low; but they had ver­ti­cal pu­pils - such as Ani­gel knew the Skri­tek al­so had. The open mo­uths of the gaw­king Wyvi­lo re­ve­aled for­mi­dab­le te­eth. The­ir skin was par­ti­al­ly ha­iry and par­ti­al­ly co­ve­red with der­mal pla­tes that re­semb­led shiny brown sca­les. The fo­rest Folk wo­re gor­ge­o­usly pa­in­ted lo­inc­loths and we­re hung abo­ut with a pro­fu­si­on of neck­la­ces, bra­ce­lets, sto­mac­hers, ank­lets, and ot­her jewelry - so­me of it gold or pla­ti­num, in­set with glit­te­ring gems­to­nes. Strung blue-glass tra­de be­ads se­emed to be as fas­hi­onab­le as pre­ci­o­us me­tal, and Ani­gel saw one abo­ri­gi­ne spor­ting the or­na­te ste­el cu­irass of a Ru­wen­di­an knight, and anot­her we­aring a pol­der lady's frin­ged shawl abo­ut his mas­si­ve sho­ul­ders.</p>
   <p>    She had calmly com­bed her ha­ir whi­le the fle­et ap­pro­ac­hed, and put on Im­mu's le­at­her ca­pe to co­ver her shabby at­ti­re. Now she sto­od up ca­re­ful­ly in the bo­at, flan­ked by the ri­mo­riks, and ra­ised both hands. The ca­pe fell back to re­ve­al the tril­li­um amu­let gle­aming on her bre­ast.</p>
   <p>    The mob of flo­ating Wyvi­lo vo­iced a low cry. Ta­lons po­in­ted, and tho­se in the sterns of the bo­ats crow­ded and stretc­hed to get a bet­ter lo­ok, mut­te­ring and exc­la­iming in the­ir gut­tu­ral lan­gu­age.</p>
   <p>    "I co­me he­re as a fri­end," Ani­gel sa­id. "I se­ek a ma­gi­cal ta­lis­man cal­led the Three-He­aded Mons­ter."</p>
   <p>    All of a sud­den the fo­rest Folk fell si­lent. Aga­in the­ir mo­uths ga­ped and the­ir gol­den eyes bul­ged.</p>
   <p>    Anigel wa­ited, then fi­nal­ly sa­id: "Is the­re one among you who can spe­ak to me?"</p>
   <p>    One of the most ela­bo­ra­tely or­na­men­ted of the coxs­wa­ins ma­de an ab­rupt ges­tu­re. His bo­at no­sed out of the ranks and ap­pro­ac­hed that of the Prin­cess.</p>
   <p>    "This one spe­aks," he dec­la­imed in the ton­gue of the Pe­nin­su­la. His vo­ice was thick and al­most unin­tel­li­gib­le, and his brown-fur­red brow knit in a fi­er­ce scowl. He wo­re a col­lar of be­aten gold set with mul­ti­co­lo­red gems, a fi­ne Ru­wen­di­an hat of cre­amy bro­ca­de with a bro­och of bril­li­ants and swe­eping red plu­mes, and a bro­ca­de lo­inc­loth to match. "This one is Sas­stu-Cha, Spe­aker of Let," he cro­aked. "Who are you? And why do you se­ek the fa­vor of the Wyvi­lo?"</p>
   <p>    "I am Prin­cess Ani­gel of Ru­wen­da. You may know that my co­untry has be­en se­ized by hu­man ene­mi­es from the north." She lif­ted the tril­li­um amu­let as she con­ti­nu­ed to spe­ak. "The Gu­ar­di­an of our land, the Whi­te Lady, sent me to se­ek a ta­lis­man. It will free my pe­op­le from the sla­ve-cha­ins of the con­qu­erors. Ha­ve you he­ard of this Three He­aded Mons­ter?"</p>
   <p>    The Spe­aker he­si­ta­ted. "We know of one such. But it is no ta­lis­man. It li­es down the ri­ver one-half day's jo­ur­ney, then se­ve­ral mo­re ho­urs' tra­vel up Ko­vu­ko Stre­am - in Glis­mak co­untry."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess drew in her bre­ath sharply, which bro­ught a smi­le to the Wyvi­lo's fa­ce.</p>
   <p>    "Can you fur­nish me with a gu­ide who will ta­ke me the­re?" she as­ked.</p>
   <p>    "No."</p>
   <p>    Anigel bran­dis­hed her amu­let. "I de­mand it of you! By the Flo­wer!"</p>
   <p>    The crowd of Wyvi­lo ut­te­red a gre­at, sig­hing cry.</p>
   <p>    Desperately, she pul­led the Black Tril­li­um le­af from the wal­let at her wa­ist and flo­uris­hed it. The Folk cri­ed out even lo­uder, and this ti­me the­ir to­ne was cle­arly fe­ar­ful.</p>
   <p>    "But I must go the­re! Help me," Ani­gel ple­aded.</p>
   <p>    "If you go up the Ko­vu­ko, you will su­rely pe­rish," Sas­stu-Cha sa­id. "The tre­es of that pla­ce are as vo­ra­ci­o­us as the Glis­mak them­sel­ves. No­ne of our pe­op­le da­re ta­ke you the­re. Even if it we­re not a pla­ce for­bid­den by the Sky God, we co­uld not go. Fo­ur suns ago the Glis­mak at­tac­ked Let and bur­ned many of our ho­uses. As the dry se­ason ends, they al­ways do, kno­wing we are ric­hest in bo­oty from our tra­de with the hu­mans. They will re­turn so­on and at­tack aga­in. All Wyvi­lo must stay and de­fend our ho­me. Not even the holy Black Tril­li­um can sway us from this duty."</p>
   <p>    Anigel drew her­self up and to­ok a de­ep bre­ath. "Very well. Then I and my ri­mo­rik fri­ends will go by our­sel­ves. Will you at le­ast gi­ve me ca­re­ful di­rec­ti­ons, so that I may qu­ickly find this Ko­vu­ko Stre­am?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes, wil­lingly. And al­so fo­od, and fresh hu­man clot­hing, if you wish it."</p>
   <p>    "That wo­uld be most wel­co­me. The­re is al­so one ot­her bo­on I wo­uld beg. Fol­lo­wing af­ter me are ot­her hu­mans, my ene­mi­es. I beg that you do not tell them whe­re I ha­ve go­ne."</p>
   <p>    "We will not," sa­id Sas­stu-Cha. He swept his arm up in a ges­tu­re to his pad­dlers. "Now this one asks you to fol­low, Prin­cess Ani­gel of Ru­wen­da. Ac­cept for to­night the pre­ca­ri­o­us hos­pi­ta­lity of Let, then go on yo­ur way. And if you find yo­ur ma­gi­cal li­be­ra­ting ta­lis­man, think not only of yo­ur own im­pe­ri­led ho­me, but gi­ve so­me small tho­ught to ours as well."</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    The Uis­gu we­re highly sen­si­ti­ve to the swamp en­vi­ron­ment, which ma­de them cons­ci­o­us of the smal­lest chan­ge in the li­fe abo­ut them. It was twi­light when tho­se at the po­les (they had chan­ged many ti­mes du­ring the­ir jo­ur­ney downst­re­am) sud­denly stop­ped. Ka­di­ya saw them draw to­get­her, spe­aking, in whis­pers, the­ir own di­alect.</p>
   <p>    Nessak, who had the tra­de ton­gue, ca­me to Ka­di­ya's si­de.</p>
   <p>    "Lady, the­re are mo­re of the enemy be­fo­re us. The gre­ater part ha­ve cam­ped at the ri­ver bend. We must so­me­how find a way aro­und them or be ta­ken aga­in for the­ir evil ple­asu­re."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya nod­ded. She wo­uld ha­ve to de­pend upon the­ir land and wa­ter skills as she had upon Jagun's.</p>
   <p>    Jagun… he re­ma­ined a pa­in­ful me­mory. In spi­te of all the­ir ho­pes he had not re­ap­pe­ared along the Mu­tar, nor had the Uis­gu wo­men re­por­ted pic­king up any Call from him. But the Prin­cess con­ti­nu­ed to flinch away from the tho­ught that he was de­ad.</p>
   <p>    "There is a way for us to pass aro­und our fo­es?" Ka­di­ya as­ked.</p>
   <p>    The mists we­re ri­sing aga­in, drif­ting to ve­il first this part and then that of the ri­ver and the banks. They had en­co­un­te­red no furt­her sign of ru­ins sin­ce they had es­ca­ped.</p>
   <p>    Nessak slowly sho­ok her he­ad. "Lady, the wic­ked hu­mans ha­ve with them Skri­tek, but it is al­so true that they are much we­ari­ed and the­re are mo­re dan­gers he­re­abo­uts. This is hun­ting ter­ri­tory for the lo­om. Thus - " she ma­de a small mo­ti­on with her hand, "after night­fall we must go in­to hi­ding from mo­re than men and Drow­ners."</p>
   <p>    Loom! Ka­di­ya had he­ard of tho­se sa­va­ge night-flyers from early child­ho­od. They we­re what nur­ses used to frigh­ten any of the­ir char­ges who lin­ge­red in the open af­ter sun­down. But sin­ce they had fled in­to this land Jagun had not men­ti­oned them. She had se­en well tan­ned squ­ares of the­ir le­at­hery wings on sa­le in Tre­vis­ta se­asons back, but only on­ce and then they had be­en so­met­hing of a cu­ri­osity. Now she lo­oked up in­to the ste­adily dar­ke­ning sky. Lo­om we­re blo­od­suc­kers that co­uld latch on­to a man or ani­mal and suck it dry, with ta­lons to claw the li­fe out of any prey clo­se eno­ugh to be cap­tu­red.</p>
   <p>    "Lady!" One of the Uis­gu who had be­en at the fo­re of the raft cal­led softly. "Lo­ok the­re!"</p>
   <p>    The ri­ver had ma­de se­ve­ral bends, even split in­to mo­re than one chan­nel sin­ce they had ta­ken flight. Now it ap­pe­ared to be stra­igh­te­ning out aga­in ahe­ad and the­re was a glow on the left-hand bank, one which cer­ta­inly was not born from any swamp-growth but from a fi­re or ot­her fi­xed light. At the sa­me ti­me they he­ard the no­tes of what co­uld only be a bat­tle-trum­pet sum­mo­ning an in­gat­he­ring, and then the sho­uts of men and a dro­ning so­und.</p>
   <p>    The Uis­gu wo­men sent the­ir craft to the op­po­si­te sho­re with hasty po­le work.</p>
   <p>    "The fo­emen are at­tac­ked!" Nes­sak's vo­ice ro­se abo­ve her for­mer soft spe­ech. "May­be the lo­om, Lady."</p>
   <p>    "If they are such fo­ols as to light the way for tho­se pre­da­tors," com­men­ted Ka­di­ya, "then cer­ta­inly they are simp­le as ba­bes in this pla­ce. The Skri­tek sho­uld ha­ve gi­ven them war­ning - "</p>
   <p>    Nessak ma­de a so­und which was ne­ar bit­ter la­ugh­ter. "Lady, the­se men from afar will not lis­ten to the gab­ble of the Drow­ners. They wo­uld think a war­ning from a swamp-dwel­ler ne­ed not be ta­ken se­ri­o­usly. The­re is no go­od sen­se among them, only the ne­ed for the shed­ding of blo­od to sa­tisfy the­ir mas­ters."</p>
   <p>    "If the lo­om at­tack them now," Ka­di­ya sa­id, thin­king fu­ri­o­usly, "can we not slip by them?"</p>
   <p>    Nessak con­si­de­red. "Such might gi­ve us a chan­ce, Lady. We can but try it…"</p>
   <p>    They to­uc­hed the sho­re on the left bank. Ka­di­ya and se­ve­ral of the ot­hers gras­ped swiftly at re­eds the­re and cut qu­an­ti­ti­es, thro­wing the bund­les back to the rest who we­re busy wor­king to ma­ke the raft ap­pe­ar one of the flo­ating mas­ses of deb­ris which we­re of­ten to be se­en drif­ting down-ri­ver. The only bar­ri­er aga­inst such a plan was the si­ze of the craft they we­re trying to dis­gu­ise. Such flo­ating is­lets we­re usu­al­ly less than a qu­ar­ter the si­ze of the log plat­form on which they had ta­ken re­fu­ge.</p>
   <p>    Having ma­de the only pre­pa­ra­ti­ons they co­uld, two of the po­lers pres­sed them back in­to the cur­rent, which was la­zi­er he­re, so they drif­ted along at a ner­ve-tor­tu­ring slow­ness. The fi­re in the enemy camp bla­zed ever brigh­ter. On the raft the Uis­gu lay flat, re­eds pul­led over them, but watc­hed the ot­her sho­re with an­xi­o­us eyes.</p>
   <p>    It ap­pe­ared the in­va­ders had le­ar­ned a lit­tle so­met­hing du­ring the­ir ear­li­er bat­tles with the lo­om for a num­ber of men wa­ved torc­hes, each torch­man be­ing flan­ked by a fel­low with wa­iting spe­ar or sword. Se­ve­ral of the be­asts we­re down strug­gling on the gro­und. A Skri­tek be­at in the he­ad of one and a man who wo­re a red­de­ning ban­da­ge abo­ut one leg he­aved a light sword as if it we­re a hun­ting kni­fe to pin anot­her vi­olently be­ating wing to the earth.</p>
   <p>    There was not­hing pro­ud and self con­fi­dent abo­ut the be­aring of the­se La­bor­no­ki sol­di­ers now. The­ir ar­mor was rus­ted, the­ir hel­met-plu­mes drag­gled, and the­ir clot­hing filthy. A num­ber wo­re ban­da­ges, whi­le the fa­ces and ba­re skin of ne­ar all of them we­re puf­fed and red­de­ned by nu­me­ro­us stings of in­sects. Un­der one tree which had a ru­de shel­ter bra­ced abo­ut its trunk we­re at le­ast fo­ur who lay mo­ti­on­less.</p>
   <p>    It was very evi­dent that the camp, lar­ge as it was - for this was no band of sco­uts-was comp­le­tely un­der con­cer­ted at­tack. Ka­di­ya re­ac­hed out with her po­le and dro­ve its end in­to the left bank, exer­ting her strength to ur­ge the craft for­ward fas­ter. Ot­hers of the Uis­gu wo­men fol­lo­wed her examp­le. But the raft mo­ved on very slowly.</p>
   <p>    It wo­uld se­em that the lo­om we­re fin­ding the­ir bat­tle mo­re pe­ri­lo­us than they had co­un­ted on. The swarm she­ered swiftly away when one of the­ir num­ber ca­ught fi­re from a well aimed torch. The bur­ning thing scre­ec­hed, and then drop­ped on its at­tac­kers de­ter­mi­ned upon re­ta­li­ati­on. The ta­lons on one wing ho­oked a man's jaw, scra­ping off his helm. He ga­ve a last cry of ter­ror as the lo­om do­ve he­ad­long to the gro­und, bur­ying its hu­man prey un­der its own bur­ning body.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya felt that they had mo­re than a chan­ce of slip­ping past un­de­tec­ted now. No­ne of the bat­tlers we­re clo­se to the ri­ver and, even tho­ugh bon­fi­re and torch il­lu­mi­na­ted the sur­fa­ce of the dark wa­ter, no­ne of the La­bor­no­ki or Skri­tek ap­pe­ared to lo­ok in the­ir di­rec­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    But she knew ho­pe too so­on. The raft sud­denly shud­de­red un­der them and was car­ri­ed to­ward the right sho­re. Ka­di­ya strug­gled with her po­le aga­inst what she first tho­ught was so­me trick of the cur­rent. Then, hardly mo­re than an arm's dis­tan­ce away, the ca­mo­uf­la­ge co­ve­ring the logs he­aved. She he­ard a Uis­gu scre­am as a gre­at sca­led arm aro­se from the wa­ter to paw at the stac­ked re­eds.</p>
   <p>    At the sa­me ti­me her po­le was jer­ked from her hands, and she let go just in ti­me to sa­ve her­self from be­ing pul­led over­bo­ard. The raft was now mo­ving ste­adily to­ward the sce­ne of the bat­tle.</p>
   <p>    "Drowners!" Nes­sak gas­ped. "Under­ne­ath - they are pul­ling us!"</p>
   <p>    There was no way to mars­hal a de­fen­se aga­inst cre­atu­res so used to the wa­ter that they co­uld lurk for a long ti­me un­se­en be­low its sur­fa­ce. Nor did they da­re try to le­ap over­bo­ard and swim for it, sin­ce the­ir ene­mi­es wo­uld only swiftly pull them un­der.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya gu­es­sed what had hap­pe­ned. Most of the canny swamp de­vils had ta­ken to the wa­ter at the co­ming of the lo­om at­tack, le­aving the men to do bat­tle. The­re must be a go­odly num­ber of them now in the ri­ver, jud­ging by the spe­ed the raft was now ma­king to­ward the sho­re.</p>
   <p>    The cha­os in the camp was les­se­ning. The­re we­re mo­re lo­oru down, and now the com­pany of vi­ci­o­us flyers had she­ered off be­fo­re ma­king a fresh at­tack.</p>
   <p>    And then, as Ka­di­ya watc­hed, in­to the full light of the fi­re the­re ca­me a fi­gu­re ro­bed in red, a ho­od pul­led up and over his fa­ce. This co­uld only be the Vo­ice of Oro­gas­tus, who had so­ught her so long. In one hand he car­ri­ed a rod, and this he ra­ised ver­ti­cal­ly, ram­ming the lo­wer end in­to the gro­und. A sol­di­er ran for­ward and hel­ped to ste­ady the staff. On the up­per end, well abo­ve the le­vel of the bon­fi­re, was a cir­cu­lar pla­te. Now the Vo­ice step­ped back, and from his hand the­re shot a be­am of light which struck the pla­te. The­re was a small exp­lo­si­on. Oran­ge-yel­low fla­mes spur­ted from the pla­te's rim, and it be­gan to spin, ma­king an ear-split­ting ke­ening so­und. The swarm of flyers ut­te­red squ­awks of fe­ar. In a body, they lof­ted high in­to the night sky, and a mo­ment la­ter had di­sap­pe­ared. The whir­ling fi­re­work bla­zed and shri­eked on for a few mi­nu­tes mo­re, then sub­si­ded in­to a sho­wer of sparks and di­ed.</p>
   <p>    The man in red stro­de down to­ward the sho­re­li­ne to stand watc­hing the in­co­ming raft. Ka­di­ya he­ard no call from him but im­me­di­ately se­ve­ral men we­aring the torn clo­aks and tar­nis­hed in­sig­nia of of­fi­cers ca­me to jo­in him.</p>
   <p>    There we­re or­ders sho­uted and tro­ops ca­me run­ning from the re­cent sce­ne of bat­tle. Ka­di­ya saw a rag­ged hand­ful of arc­hers with ar­rows at the re­ady. But an of­fi­cer in a full su­it of ela­bo­ra­te blo­od-red ar­mor threw up his arm and they did not fi­re. No­ne of the Uis­gu fe­ma­les had ri­sen out of hi­ding, but Ka­di­ya had no do­ubt that tho­se as­ho­re we­re qu­ite awa­re of them. Clam­be­ring out of the ri­ver now and set­ting the big raft to roc­king, the Skri­tek grin­ned in tri­umph, the­ir lar­ge eyes re­tur­ning the red gle­am of fi­re and torch.</p>
   <p>    The of­fi­cer, whom Ka­di­ya now re­cog­ni­zed to be Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil, tur­ned to the Red Vo­ice and spo­ke. Stra­ight­way the acoly­te of Oro­gas­tus sho­uted in tra­de ton­gue:</p>
   <p>    "Ashore, swamp scum! Or shall the­se al­li­es be al­lo­wed to ta­ke what they wish?" He ma­de a small ges­tu­re to the wa­iting Skri­tek.</p>
   <p>    The re­eds shif­ted as the Uis­gu wo­men craw­led out. But Ka­di­ya did not fol­low at on­ce. She grip­ped her ta­lis­man. Su­rely the­re might be just a chan­ce… Skri­tek se­ized the Uis­gu and hur­led them as­ho­re. Ho­we­ver, the Vo­ice had no eyes for the­ir cap­tu­re. He sta­red at the pla­ce whe­re Ka­di­ya still lay hid­den, frow­ning. The ta­lis­man se­emed to be shi­el­ding her in so­me way.</p>
   <p>    The Vo­ice sa­id so­met­hing to Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil and the of­fi­cer tur­ned. One of the Uis­gu wo­men who car­ri­ed a child had stumb­led and fal­len at his fe­et when the Skri­tek had thrown them as­ho­re. Ha­mil sto­oped and ca­ught the scre­aming child by one arm, jer­king it out of its mot­her's lo­ose­ned grasp, and tos­sed it to one of the Skri­tek. The mons­ter ro­ared with de­light and ca­ught the pri­ze easily out of the air.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya burst out of the co­ve­ring of rus­hes, ta­lis­man in hand. "No!" she scre­amed.</p>
   <p>    "Take her!" sho­uted Ha­mil.</p>
   <p>    Before she co­uld mo­ve, the ta­lons of a Skri­tek who had clim­bed up from the ri­ver clo­sed upon her, twis­ting her arms be­hind her back pa­in­ful­ly, and she was drag­ged off the raft on­to the sho­re. The ta­lis­man had fal­len in the mud; but when anot­her Skri­tek sto­oped to pick it up he yel­ped and pul­led back, whi­le aro­und the now-glo­wing pom­mel the­re aro­se curls of smo­ke.</p>
   <p>    Thrust be­fo­re the Ge­ne­ral and the Vo­ice, Ka­di­ya sto­od ten­se with im­po­tent ra­ge. Ha­mil's helm was open, and he bo­re very lit­tle re­semb­lan­ce to the splen­did man she had se­en at the Ci­ta­del. His bristly be­ar­ded jaws and che­eks we­re lum­ped with bi­tes, so­me of which we­re badly swol­len. One be­si­de his left eye had pul­led down the lid so that he co­uld hardly see out of it. But he was smi­ling and now he la­ug­hed.</p>
   <p>    "Well, Vo­ice," he spo­ke to his com­pa­ni­on. "Now he­re is so­met­hing that can ma­ke all this dam­ned muck-tre­ading worth it. The Prin­cess Ka­di­ya! We ha­ve in­de­ed be­en fa­vo­red this night!"</p>
   <p>    A hand shot out and na­ils cut cru­el­ly in­to her che­eks as he cup­ped her fa­ce and held it hig­her.</p>
   <p>    "Swamp vart," he sa­id with re­al ple­asu­re. "Far from yo­ur silks and pret­ti­es now, aren't you? It did not ta­ke long to re­du­ce you to a mud-run­ner-soft me­at li­ke all yo­ur kind!" He let go his hold and slap­ped her fa­ce, a blow so sharp and he­avy that te­ars ca­me wil­ly-nil­ly.</p>
   <p>    Hamil snor­ted. "We­ep yo­ur eyes out, girl. The­re is no mercy for any of yo­ur ho­use." He lo­oked to the Red Vo­ice and ad­ded scorn­ful­ly: "So the wo­men of Kra­in's blo­od are to bring gre­at La­bor­nok down?" His he­avy hand fell aga­in, this ti­me on her sho­ul­der, and he bro­ught her abo­ut to fa­ce the mi­ni­on of Oro­gas­tus. "This -this is what yo­ur gre­at lord se­es as de­ath to us? What a joke!"</p>
   <p>    The Vo­ice was not lo­oking at Ka­di­ya, rat­her at the ta­lis­man, which lay a short dis­tan­ce away. He sto­oped to ta­ke it and then drew back, scow­ling.</p>
   <p>    "What frights you, Vo­ice?" Ha­mil was jovi­al. "It is the ta­lis­man! The ma­gi­cal gimc­rack so co­ve­ted by yo­ur mas­ter. Ta­ke it, man. What are you wa­iting for?"</p>
   <p>    The Red Vo­ice stif­fe­ned. He se­emed to grow tal­ler, mo­re mas­si­ve. From the eye­ho­les of his mask daz­zling whi­te be­ams sho­ne, so that even Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil jo­ined his men as they all exc­la­imed in fe­ar.</p>
   <p>    "Hamil!" As if bor­ne on the night wind ca­me a new vo­ice Ka­di­ya had he­ard be­fo­re. It was the acoly­te spe­aking, but the to­nes we­re tho­se of Oro­gas­tus. "You ha­ve do­ne well, bet­ter than you know. But you must ta­ke gre­at ca­re. That lying be­fo­re you is bon­ded to yo­ur pri­so­ner. Ne­it­her you, nor any ot­her who has not the old know­led­ge, can hand­le it -only she. My Red Vo­ice, obey me! Ma­ke Prin­cess Ka­di­ya carry the ta­lis­man back to the Ci­ta­del, but be su­re she can­not use it."</p>
   <p>    The Red Vo­ice slum­ped. His eyes we­re dark aga­in, and he whis­pe­red: "Yes, Mas­ter."</p>
   <p>    Hamil spat, lo­udly and no­isily, the spit­tle stri­king the mud just be­yond the pom­mel. "So she and that stick are ma­gi­cal­ly bon­ded. Well, Vo­ice, how do you sol­ve this prob­lem? It is pla­inly of yo­ur mas­ter's kind of war­fa­re."</p>
   <p>    The sor­ce­rer's acoly­te pro­du­ced a length of cord, not wo­ven from any fi­ber but oddly mot­tled in co­lor as if it had be­en the skin of so­me small swamp-worm. As Ka­di­ya watc­hed, he fas­hi­oned a small no­ose at one end of it. This he pro­ce­eded to roll bet­we­en thumb and fo­re­fin­ger mut­te­ring to him­self. Then, with the ca­re of a fis­her­man abo­ut to en­ti­ce so­me wary pond dwel­ler, he lo­we­red the lo­op and, with gre­at pa­ti­en­ce, wor­ked it over the pom­mel of the ta­lis­man, gi­ving it a stiff jerk when he had it in pla­ce. Ha­ving ma­de su­re that his no­ose was se­cu­re, he lif­ted the sna­kes­kin and so drew the po­int­less sword en­ti­rely free of the gro­und. As he sto­od dang­ling it be­fo­re him, Ha­mil re­ac­hed forth ca­re­les­sly to to­uch it, only to ha­ve the Vo­ice pull back.</p>
   <p>    "Lord Ge­ne­ral, this be truly bon­ded. Lay hand fully upon it and it may ha­ve you ent­rap­ped."</p>
   <p>    The Ge­ne­ral snor­ted.</p>
   <p>    "You he­ard the or­ders of my Mas­ter," the Vo­ice went on. "This is a thing of gre­at po­wer he wis­hes to pos­sess, and sin­ce it is bon­ded to Prin­cess Ka­di­ya, he wis­hes her al­so."</p>
   <p>    Hamil eyed the girl tho­ught­ful­ly. "But what if she cont­ri­ves so­me­how to use the dam­ned thing?"</p>
   <p>    Through the eye­ho­les of his mask the Vo­ice was re­gar­ding Ka­di­ya in­tently. "Lord Ge­ne­ral, we do not know what this girl can do. But my Mas­ter has gi­ven me a de­vi­ce to sub­due her."</p>
   <p>    At the end of the spot­ted skin which held it, the sword swa­yed hypno­ti­cal­ly back and forth. The Red Vo­ice re­ac­hed in­to his ro­be with his ot­her hand, bro­ught out a small whi­te obj­ect, and to­uc­hed it to Ka­di­ya's fo­re­he­ad.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya cri­ed out, and then her vo­ice di­ed away. It was as if the bi­ting cold of ice struck her, fre­ezing her very bo­ne-mar­row. The cold spre­ad thro­ugh her body from he­ad to fo­ot. She tri­ed to mo­ve, but her body did not res­pond.</p>
   <p>    The Vo­ice nod­ded. "Just so. For a spa­ce, Lord Ge­ne­ral, she will be harm­less - tho­ugh this will not hold fo­re­ver. The de­vi­ce works but on­ce, and I ha­ve but one of them with me. The­re is anot­her way that we shall co­er­ce this girl. That which is bon­ded can be re­le­ased -by wil­ling. But such bre­aking of anot­her's re­sol­ve will ta­ke ti­me. We must see that this ta­lis­man go­es with her un­til we are in a po­si­ti­on to ac­cept it fre­ely from her."</p>
   <p>    "Accept fre­ely?" Ha­mil sta­red and then la­ug­hed, "Oh, that can be ar­ran­ged, oh, yes, it can!"</p>
   <p>    There was a vol­ley of or­ders. Ka­di­ya was trus­sed li­ke an inert ba­le of go­ods, with her ta­lis­man las­hed to her back. Then po­les we­re run thro­ugh the ro­pes, and two sol­di­ers bo­re her off li­ke the trophy of a hunt.</p>
   <p>    The Uis­gu from the raft had be­en on­ce mo­re her­ded to­get­her and we­re bo­und up, the­ir necks no­osed one to the next in a li­ne. Ho­we­ver, it wo­uld se­em that the­ir cap­tors had no in­ten­ti­on of go­ing fart­her that night. Per­haps to le­ave the­ir fi­re wo­uld ap­pe­ar folly af­ter they had be­aten off one lo­om at­tack. The­re we­re a co­up­le of strong-ro­oted tre­es gro­wing among the ferns, and to tho­se the neck ro­pes of the cap­ti­ves we­re ma­de fast. Skri­tek squ­at­ted ne­arby, grun­ting among them­sel­ves, eye­ing the pri­so­ners gre­edily.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya's tho­ughts mo­ved slug­gishly. She had a qu­e­er men­tal pic­tu­re of one pus­hing step by step thro­ugh a gre­at bank of snow. She con­si­de­red Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil. He was a fit and re­ady to­ol for King Volt­rik. From him the­re flo­wed a sen­se of evil, not of une­arthly dark­ness such as the Vo­ice and his mas­ter pro­j­ec­ted, but rat­her a bru­ta­lity which was wor­se in a way be­ca­use it was fully hu­man. Ne­vert­he­less, it se­emed mo­re li­kely that she might inf­lu­en­ce <emphasis>him</emphasis> than the sor­ce­rer's pup­pet…</p>
   <p>    She tri­ed to use an­ger, as she had so of­ten be­fo­re, to aro­use her­self out of the de­adly cold. But she was trap­ped. The­re was no warmth eit­her from the ta­lis­man to which she had be­en so ca­re­ful­ly bo­und. She clo­sed her eyes and wil­led her­self to think cle­arly, but her con­ge­aled ner­ves se­emed only to ur­ge sur­ren­der.</p>
   <p>    Then she was awa­re of a rust­ling be­si­de her, and that for so­me ti­me she had not he­ard the grun­ting of the Skri­tek. She ope­ned her eyes as bre­ath fo­ul with the fu­mes of brandy puf­fed aga­inst her che­ek. Then the­re ca­me a clam­ping down of a hand, harsh and hard, ac­ross her lips, and strong fin­gers tang­led in her ha­ir.</p>
   <p>    "Princess!" It was a ta­in­ted whis­per. "What of the tre­asu­re you ha­ve se­en in the swamp ru­ins? Whe­re is that bel­da­me of the an­ci­ent le­gends who plays with ma­gic, who is sa­id to ha­ve gat­he­red the most po­wer­ful to­ols of the Va­nis­hed Ones? Oro­gas­tus thinks to gat­her all in­to his own hands. Ah, much I know of that! Mo­re than Volt­rik, who may be de­ad by now, along with that stu­pid boy, his son. But the sor­ce­rer is far away in his to­wer, and this Vo­ice of his but a we­ak­ling and a fo­ol when he is not pos­ses­sed by his mas­ter's spi­rit. Tell me the sec­rets you ha­ve le­ar­ned! Buy a cle­an de­ath, King's Da­ugh­ter. If you ga­in one you buy it of me, and me only."</p>
   <p>    Hamil! This man was pla­ying so­me ga­me of his own…</p>
   <p>    The hand un­co­ve­red her mo­uth but the fin­gers re­ma­ined pa­in­ful­ly twis­ted in her ha­ir. Oddly eno­ugh, the bru­tal Ge­ne­ral's thre­ats ap­pe­ared to ha­ve bro­ken thro­ugh so­me of the icy sor­cery which held her im­po­tent. So the­re was no lon­ger a me­eting of com­mon pur­po­se among the enemy. How co­uld she turn this to ac­co­unt? It was so dif­fi­cult to think cle­arly.</p>
   <p>    "Would you rat­her fa­ce the Skri­tek, then, mud-craw­ler? Well, we can ma­ke a pretty show in the mor­ning for you. One you can watch."</p>
   <p>    His grip on her lo­ose­ned and she was ab­ruptly alo­ne. For a big man he co­uld mo­ve si­lently eno­ugh, tho­ugh she had be­en cast down on the gro­und not far from his tent. And then she saw anot­her sha­dow mo­ving, one that did not ap­pro­ach clo­sely. But she he­ard a si­bi­lant whis­per:</p>
   <p>    "So! Ha­mil be­li­eves that he is a match for the Mas­ter! As if the­re was ever any ne­ed for him, or King Volt­rik, or Prin­ce An­tar, on­ce this land was over­run. What you carry, girl, that is what mat­ters! Oro­gas­tus wo­uld be wil­ling to let you ta­ke yo­ur blo­od pay­ment from the La­bor­no­ki King if you wo­uld me­et him with truth."</p>
   <p>    The Red Vo­ice crept ne­arer. Then his hand was on her sho­ul­der, very clo­se to the pom­mel of the ta­lis­man. "See, I will play you fa­ir. I can free you from the spell that fre­ezes you. We can be far from he­re be­fo­re that mor­ning Ha­mil pra­tes abo­ut if only you will bond the ta­lis­man to me."</p>
   <p>    Exerting all her strength, she ma­na­ged to gasp: "I am no fo­ol, fa­ith­ful ser­vant of a fo­ul mas­ter!"</p>
   <p>    "Foul? Ah, no, Prin­cess. You will find Oro­gas­tus a most ple­asing fri­end. Al­re­ady yo­ur de­ar sis­ter Ha­ra­mis is his cup-ma­te and le­arns from him such wond­ro­us craft as yo­ur Arc­hi­ma­ge ne­ver even dre­amed might exist. She has a tas­te and a ta­lent for such things, has the Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis, and al­re­ady she se­es mat­ters thro­ugh the Mas­ter's eyes. You can jo­in her. My Mas­ter will not ga­in­say you if you bring King Volt­rik and Ha­mil down. They ha­ve be­gun to we­ary him. You can be a qu­e­en, if you wish - a ru­ler of two lands, and yo­ur sis­ter will ha­ve a tha­uma­tur­gi­cal thro­ne to re­ach the stars."</p>
   <p>    There was a po­iso­no­us re­aso­ning in what he sa­id. That Oro­gas­tus might be ti­red of his La­bor­no­ki al­li­es co­uld be un­ders­to­od. That he be­li­eved he co­uld use her, a ro­yal Prin­cess, to ru­le both Ru­wen­da and La­bor­nok -yes, that, too, was pla­usib­le. Of co­ur­se, he must be lying abo­ut Ha­ra­mis sub­mit­ting to Oro­gas­tus. Still, she might tem­po­ri­ze.</p>
   <p>    "I… I can­not gi­ve anyt­hing… when I am so bo­und," Ka­di­ya po­in­ted out.</p>
   <p>    The so­und that ca­me from the Vo­ice was ne­arly a snic­ker. "Prin­cess, you can com­mand yo­ur ta­lis­man even if you are bo­und. Re­le­ase by word and tho­ught what you carry and I shall spe­edily re­le­ase <emphasis>you</emphasis>."</p>
   <p>    Of co­ur­se she did not be­li­eve him. But the­re was so lit­tle ti­me to think and her tho­ughts still se­emed sul­lenly slow… Then she re­mem­be­red - re­mem­be­red a bla­de which had grown from a ro­ot. She might carry a ma­gi­cal sword, but it was ro­oted in so­met­hing el­se - and that this fol­lo­wer of Oro­gas­tus did not know.</p>
   <p>    "I grant you… per­mis­si­on to draw it." She fo­und words co­ming to her ton­gue which had not be­en in her mind a mo­ment ear­li­er. "Plant the blunt end of the bla­de in the gro­und."</p>
   <p>    She co­uld he­ar his qu­ic­ke­ned bre­at­hing. That he trus­ted her was a won­der, but one she had no ti­me to con­si­der now. She felt the ta­lis­man sli­de out from bet­we­en her sho­ul­ders. The­re was no gle­am to it now; it re­ma­ined qu­ite dull. The Red Vo­ice was on his fe­et. She saw him put the bla­de in­to the so­il un­til it sto­od up­right even as she had as­ked.</p>
   <p>    Then - the­re was a ra­di­an­ce, the bla­de thin­ned, be­ca­me as slen­der as a stem, but the three lo­bes re­ma­ined the sa­me. She he­ard her own vo­ice in a fi­er­ce whis­per:</p>
   <p>    "Be, O li­ving ta­lis­man, O ro­ots­tock of the Black Tril­li­um, the emb­lem and strength of our ho­use, as you ha­ve al­ways be­en!"</p>
   <p>    At her or­der the sphe­res ope­ned. The three eyes we­re ali­ve. They tur­ned on the Vo­ice, who had stif­fe­ned. For an ins­tant his own eyes gle­amed star-bright as the dis­tant sor­ce­rer so­ught to in­va­de him. But Oro­gas­tus was not qu­ick eno­ugh.</p>
   <p>    One eye of the ta­lis­man shot forth whi­te light, and to that was jo­ined a gre­en be­am from the Od­dling eye, and a shaft of gold from the hu­man.</p>
   <p>    And the Vo­ice bur­ned.</p>
   <p>    He writ­hed as the ma­gi­cal ra­di­an­ce en­ve­lo­ped him. A co­lumn of tri­co­lo­red fla­me ent­wi­ned abo­ut his body se­aling him in. He had not even ti­me to scre­am. And then the fi­re was go­ne as sud­denly as it had co­me and cin­ders lay he­aped on the gro­und, gi­ving off wisps of smo­ke.</p>
   <p>    In the pla­ce of the Three-Lo­bed Bur­ning Eye sto­od the ta­lis­man, li­fe­less and dull.</p>

   <p>    Never had Prin­ce An­tar spent such wretc­hed days and nights as tho­se on the Gre­at Mu­tar. The un­re­len­ting sun ro­as­ted him and his ar­mo­red com­pa­ni­ons li­ke ho­li­day to­gars. They had ta­ken only the se­ven lar­gest of the­ir wo­oden punts (de­eming tho­se of the Wyvi­lo too fra­gi­le and tippy), and the­se we­re cram­ped and crow­ded when lo­aded with the re­du­ced for­ce of forty-three men and the ne­ces­sary sup­pli­es.</p>
   <p>    In the­ir inex­pe­ri­en­ce the La­bor­no­ki al­most al­ways cho­se stop­ping pla­ces on the ma­in banks of the ri­ver that we­re too hot and too muddy, and in­fes­ted with slimy blo­od­suc­kers, bi­ting gnats, and small yel­low-stri­ped ver­min that gna­wed ho­les in the supply sacks. The me­als pre­pa­red by ama­te­ur sol­di­er-co­oks we­re usu­al­ly eit­her bur­ned or raw. Two men al­re­ady suf­fe­red the blo­ody flux from snac­king on po­iso­no­us fru­it. Be­reft of the­ir com­for­tab­le pa­vi­li­ons and fol­ding beds, which we­re too lar­ge to fit in the punts, the knights had to sle­ep on the gro­und as the com­mon sol­di­ers did, co­ve­red only by the­ir ca­pes.</p>
   <p>    And fi­nal­ly, when the un­kempt for­ce re­ac­hed the at­trac­ti­ve Wyvi­lo set­tle­ment of Let, which lo­oked by then as in­vi­ting to them as De­ror­gu­ila Pa­la­ce, the ac­cur­sed Od­dlings re­fu­sed them per­mis­si­on to land.</p>
   <p>    Meeting the La­bor­no­ki in midst­re­am, the Wyvi­lo we­re to­tal­ly unimp­res­sed by the Prin­ce's of­fer to re­ward them hand­so­mely for the­ir tro­ub­le. The Spe­aker dec­la­red that the vil­la­ge had no ti­me for gu­ests. It ex­pec­ted to be be­si­eged by its Glis­mak fo­es at any ti­me. The hu­mans must mo­ve on. Ne­it­her gu­ides nor fo­od sup­pli­es we­re ava­ilab­le.</p>
   <p>    Sir Ri­nu­tar to­ok it upon him­self to re­vi­le the as­semb­led flo­til­la of fo­rest Folk and the­ir Spe­aker ro­undly. He thre­ate­ned them with the tha­uma­tur­gi­cal fury of the mighty Oro­gas­tus, this sa­me to be de­li­ve­red via the Blue Vo­ice if the Wyvi­lo did not ac­ce­de at on­ce to La­bor­nok's de­mands.</p>
   <p>    Rinutar's fri­end Sir Ka­ron, not wis­hing to be bes­ted in de­fi­an­ce of the in­so­lent pri­mi­ti­ves, sur­ged to his fe­et in his punt, drew his sword, and chal­len­ged Spe­aker Sas­stu-Cha to sing­le com­bat. At this po­int, the ap­pa­rently unar­med abo­ri­gi­nes whip­ped out small ca­ta­pults and bom­bar­ded the se­ven La­bor­no­ki bo­ats with a bar­ra­ge of smartly flung flints­to­nes.</p>
   <p>    The Prin­ce and most of the knights in the­ir ar­mor we­re hardly hurt (altho­ugh the luck­less Sir Pe­na­pat nar­rowly mis­sed ha­ving his eye put out); but the twenty-one sol­di­ers, ha­ving be­en pres­sed in­to ser­vi­ce as re­luc­tant oars­men and shuc­king most of the­ir ar­mor be­ca­use of the he­at and const­ra­ints of ro­wing, sus­ta­ined many a bru­ise and la­ce­ra­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Sir Ka­ron was start­led in­to over­ba­lan­cing when the as­sa­ult com­men­ced, and his mas­si­ve flo­un­de­rings ca­used his punt to roll over with a tre­men­do­us splash. Still wa­ving his sword, the iron-clad stal­wart va­nis­hed in­to the depths of the Gre­at Mu­tar, ne­ver to be se­en aga­in, as did his knightly com­pa­ni­on in the punt, Sir Bid­rik. The Blue Vo­ice, who had al­so be­en a pas­sen­ger in the cap­si­zed craft, pop­ped to the sur­fa­ce of the wa­ter with re­mar­kab­le bu­oyancy for one so skinny, and struck out for the Prin­ce's bo­at, in­to which he was drag­ged by Sir Owa­non. The three de­can­ted sol­di­er-oars­men thras­hed abo­ut pat­he­ti­cal­ly cal­ling for help, sin­ce they co­uld not swim and the­ir bo­at had drif­ted off down the ri­ver out of re­ach. Even­tu­al­ly they we­re ha­uled sa­fely abo­ard ot­her punts by the­ir ma­tes.</p>
   <p>    The Wyvi­lo had watc­hed this spec­tac­le phleg­ma­ti­cal­ly, slings­hots at the re­ady.</p>
   <p>    "Go away," Spe­aker Sas­stu-Cha com­man­ded on­ce aga­in. "We will not harm you furt­her if you le­ave at on­ce."</p>
   <p>    Prince An­tar spo­ke in a whis­per to the drip­ping Blue Vo­ice: "Can you ma­gic yon Od­dlings and for­ce our will upon them?"</p>
   <p>    "Nay, High Lord." The Vo­ice was calmly wrin­ging his skirts over the si­de. "The inst­ru­ments of enc­hant­ment I might ha­ve used are, li­ke the la­te Lords Ka­ron and Bid­rik, now res­ting on the flo­or of the Gre­at Mu­tar."</p>
   <p>    "Very well," sig­hed the Prin­ce. And he cal­led to the oars­men: "Row on!"</p>
   <p>    Thus ig­no­mi­ni­o­usly did the se­arch-party con­ti­nue down the ri­ver, un­til it was ne­arly dark and the Prin­ce de­emed that they had go­ne a sa­fe dis­tan­ce from Let. Then they put in at an in­vi­ting small co­ve, hard by the ma­in chan­nel and smo­othly san­ded, and ma­de camp by fi­re­light.</p>
   <p>    There we­re se­ven sol­di­ers so badly bat­te­red that they we­re use­less for figh­ting or ar­du­o­us ro­wing. The­se we­re ex­cu­sed from furt­her duty. "To­mor­row," Prin­ce An­tar told them, "you men, and two ot­hers mo­re ab­le-bo­di­ed from among the wo­un­ded, will ta­ke one of the punts and ma­ke yo­ur way back to Tass Town. Tell the bo­at skip­pers and the Mas­ter-Tra­der that they are to awa­it our re­turn upon pa­in of de­ath - even sho­uld we not ha­ve re­tur­ned by the start of the ra­iny se­ason."</p>
   <p>    There was much mur­mu­ring among the knights and the ot­her men at this, but the Prin­ce pa­id no at­ten­ti­on. He then sum­mo­ned the Blue Vo­ice. "Call upon yo­ur dark mas­ter to scry for us Prin­cess Ani­gel, so that we may know whe­re to be­ta­ke our­sel­ves on the mor­row. Tell Oro­gas­tus al­so to in­form my fat­her King Volt­rik that I con­ti­nue to fol­low his or­ders fa­ith­ful­ly, and tho­se of his Grand Mi­nis­ter of Sta­te."</p>
   <p>    With that, the Prin­ce tram­ped off down the mo­on­lit sho­re by him­self. The ot­her men went abo­ut the­ir bu­si­ness sunk in me­lanc­holy, ex­cep­ting the Blue Vo­ice, who re­ti­red to a gro­ve of we­eping wydel-tre­es at the mar­gin of the strand, knelt down, and pas­sed in­to a tran­ce.</p>
   <p>    "Almighty Mas­ter, he­ar me!"</p>
   <p>    "I, Oro­gas­tus, he­ar you, my Vo­ice."</p>
   <p>    "Alas, my Lord, our ex­pe­di­ti­on has suf­fe­red a gra­ve set­back at the Wyvi­lo vil­la­ge of Let. The Od­dlings ca­ught us una­wa­res with a sho­wer of mis­si­les, up­set­ting the bo­at in which I ro­de. All of the ma­gi­cal equ­ip­ment was lost, and the knights Ka­ron and Bid­rik sank from the we­ight of the­ir ar­mor and drow­ned. Al­so, se­ven men-at-arms we­re so badly ban­ged abo­ut that they must re­ti­re back to Tass Town in the ca­re of two ot­hers less se­ri­o­usly inj­ured, and Sir Pe­na­pat has a black eye the si­ze of a la­du-fru­it from be­ing smo­te with a flying rock."</p>
   <p>    Orogastus di­ges­ted this news. "The Prin­ce and the ot­her se­ven­te­en knights are yet ha­le?"</p>
   <p>    "Aye, Gre­at Lord. And twel­ve sol­di­ers - alt­ho­ugh most are bru­ised and full of comp­la­ints."</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ve scri­ed the Prin­cess Ani­gel. She is en­cam­ped at the mo­uth of a small stre­am down-ri­ver from you and in­tends to go up this wa­ter­way to­mor­row, tra­ve­ling on fo­ot when she can no lon­ger use her bo­at. It will ta­ke yo­ur party abo­ut fi­ve ho­urs to re­ach the stre­am if both the men and knights row do­ub­le-ti­me. You will or­der Prin­ce An­tar to de­part at dawn and pur­sue Ani­gel with all spe­ed - but see that she go­es uns­cat­hed un­til she se­cu­res the ta­lis­man, which must now be very clo­se by."</p>
   <p>    "I will trans­mit yo­ur com­mands to the Prin­ce, Mas­ter."</p>
   <p>    "Tell the Prin­ce al­so the go­od news that his Ro­yal Fat­her is very ne­ar full re­co­ve­red. Furt­her­mo­re, Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil has Prin­cess Ka­di­ya in cus­tody and will shortly ta­ke char­ge of her ta­lis­man, the Three-Lo­bed Bur­ning Eye."</p>
   <p>    "Master…" the Vo­ice fal­te­red. "This eve­ning, as we ma­de our lan­ding, I felt a sud­den bra­ins­torm. It-it se­emed as tho­ugh my Red Brot­her, who ac­com­pa­ni­es Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil, had met with mis­for­tu­ne."</p>
   <p>    "My Blue Vo­ice, you must be bra­ve. Yo­ur brot­her has pe­ris­hed in my ser­vi­ce."</p>
   <p>    "Oh, woe!"</p>
   <p>    "The Dark Po­wers will re­ce­ive his li­fe-ener­gi­es and glo­rify them. And you two Vo­ices who re­ma­in shall sha­re an even gre­ater earthly re­ward when my gre­at am­bi­ti­on is ful­fil­led… But re­call now the ot­her mat­ter, con­cer­ning Prin­ce An­tar, that you must yet carry out."</p>
   <p>    "I wa­it only for the ap­prop­ri­ate mo­ment, Al­mighty Mas­ter. The do­ughty Sir Ri­nu­tar, a man af­ter yo­ur own he­art, will be ta­ken in­to our con­fi­den­ce af­ter the de­ed is do­ne. He will su­rely le­ad our parry back sa­fely on­ce the ta­lis­man is se­cu­red."</p>
   <p>    The sor­ce­rer's men­tal spe­ech now lost all tin­ge of sympathy and be­ca­me char­ged with a dre­ad­ful re­so­lu­ti­on. "It is of the ut­most im­por­tan­ce, my Vo­ice, that Ani­gel's ta­lis­man be not lost."</p>
   <p>    "Great Lord, I un­ders­tand."</p>
   <p>    "Kadiya's ta­lis­man is all but se­cu­red. That of Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis will so­on be mi­ne - per­haps even be­fo­re this night is over! But the­se two are fully em­po­we­red only by the third, the one you must bring to me."</p>
   <p>    "On my li­fe," the Blue Vo­ice vo­wed, "I will pla­ce it at yo­ur fe­et. And if all go­es well, Prin­ce An­tar will not see to­mor­row's sun set."</p>
   <p>    "I am ple­ased. Fa­re­well, my Blue Vo­ice."</p>
   <p>    The enc­han­ter's mi­ni­on ma­de his way back in­to the camp, whe­re one co­ok-of-the-eve­ning was pre­pa­ring a stew of dri­ed me­at and ve­ge­tab­les gar­nis­hed with fat­back, whi­le anot­her at­temp­ted to ba­ke lo­aves in a so­oty ref­lec­tor oven. The smells we­re not en­co­ura­ging.</p>
   <p>    The Blue Vo­ice ap­pro­ac­hed the Prin­ce boldly. An­tar's pre­oc­cu­pa­ti­on va­nis­hed and he lo­oked al­most eager. "You ha­ve news?"</p>
   <p>    "Aye, High Lord. The fu­gi­ti­ve Prin­cess is only abo­ut eight ho­urs ahe­ad of us. She ne­ars the go­al of her qu­es­ting, and per­haps to­mor­row or the next day will see her ta­ken." The Vo­ice went on to tell of the King's re­co­very, and how the sor­ce­rer had ne­arly se­cu­red the ot­her two ta­lis­mans. He did not men­ti­on his fel­low-acoly­te's de­ath. The Prin­ce lis­te­ned with half an ear, then wal­ked away wit­ho­ut anot­her word to sha­re the po­or sup­per with his men.</p>
   <p>    That night a gre­at thun­ders­torm struck the Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest, the first ge­nu­ine pre­cur­sor of the ra­iny se­ason which wo­uld of­fi­ci­al­ly be­gin in six days, af­ter the Fe­ast of the Three Mo­ons. The men of La­bor­nok we­re ro­used by the thun­der, and has­te­ned to turn over the­ir bo­ats and ta­ke re­fu­ge un­der them. But on­ce aga­in the­ir lack of wil­der­ness ex­pe­ri­en­ce bet­ra­yed them. The sandy flat that had se­emed so ple­asant ear­li­er was now inun­da­ted as the Gre­at Mu­tar ro­se in bri­ef flo­od. Cur­sing and gro­aning, the parry had to right the punts and climb in­to them, then pad­dle in­to an adj­acent thic­ket, now al­so un­der­wa­ter, and tie up the­re for the rest of the night. They do­zed fit­ful­ly be­ne­ath the­ir stre­aming ca­pes as the storm ra­ged on, ba­iling out the punts as ra­in­wa­ter ac­cu­mu­la­ted.</p>
   <p>    Prince An­tar was as so­aked and mi­se­rab­le as the lo­west sol­di­er. Yet he tho­ught not of his own dis­com­fort, but rat­her sat sle­ep­less as he wor­ri­ed how Prin­cess Ani­gel fa­red thro­ug­ho­ut that end­less, blus­tery night.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Friend</emphasis>, they cal­led to her. <emphasis>Fri­end, awa­ken. It is first light. You as­ked us to call you. Awa­ken</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    Inside the hol­low tree, Ani­gel stretc­hed and yaw­ned. She lay on dry, cle­an wo­od-dust, the pro­duct of the car­pen­ter-worms that still wor­ked in­dust­ri­o­usly aro­und and abo­ve her to re­du­ce the de­ad fo­rest gi­ant to a mo­und of hu­mus. Her ha­ir, sle­ep-sack, and the hand­so­me new clot­hing that the Wyvi­lo had gi­ven her we­re pow­de­red with the stuff; but it was a small pri­ce to pay for snug shel­ter du­ring the storm.</p>
   <p>    She had dre­amed aga­in, but the me­mory fa­ded with the ri­mo­riks' call. She had ba­de the ani­mals ro­use her early, kno­wing that she must be ne­aring the obj­ect of her qu­est. Last night, awa­ke­ned mo­men­ta­rily by the cras­hing thun­der, she had se­en her tril­li­um amu­let glo­wing li­ke fi­re; the small flo­we­ret wit­hin was very ne­arly full open.</p>
   <p>    She ran the comb thro­ugh her ha­ir to dis­lod­ge the worst of the dust and to­ok out the mi­ton go­urd from her wal­let. The Black Tril­li­um le­af wrap­ped aro­und it no lon­ger se­emed so fresh and gre­en; its up­per por­ti­on was wit­he­ring whe­re the ve­in had tur­ned brown, and only the ba­se was mo­ist and ali­ve. The gol­den tra­ce that had gu­ided her from Noth now ex­ten­ded only thro­ugh the short, bent stem.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>We ha­ve fo­od for you, fri­end. Co­me out and see.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Gathering her things, she stop­ped and squ­e­ezed out of the hol­low tree. The two ri­mo­riks we­re the­re be­si­de the punt, which was drawn up part­way on the bank of the stre­am. A fat wi­nju-fish lay on the moss. Rags of mist sto­le in and out of the sur­ro­un­ding tre­es, and the un­derg­rowth of gre­at ferns and shrub­bery drip­ped even tho­ugh the ra­in had stop­ped. The sky se­emed cle­ar and the whi­te birds we­re sin­ging the­ir wel­co­me to the dawn. The cre­ek, she no­ti­ced, ran much ful­ler than when they had en­te­red it last night. That was for­tu­ito­us: it me­ant that she wo­uld be ab­le to tra­vel fart­her up-stre­am in her bo­at.</p>
   <p>    "Thank you, my fri­ends," Ani­gel sa­id, "but I think I will eat only this Wyvi­lo pas­tie and so­me of the­se ber­ri­es for bre­ak­fast. It wo­uld be hard for me to start a fi­re in this damp­ness, and I wo­uld li­ke to be qu­ickly on my way."</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>That wo­uld be a go­od thing</emphasis>, sa­id one ri­mo­rik.</p>
   <p>    The se­cond one sa­id: <emphasis>It is known to us that yo­ur ene­mi­es are fast ap­pro­ac­hing on the Wa­ter That Flows to the Sea. Our com­ra­des tell us that the hu­mans are very wet and very angry, and mo­re eager than ever to catch you</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    Anigel sig­hed. "For so­me stran­ge re­ason, I find it hard to fret over them now. I am no lon­ger even af­ra­id of the Three-He­aded Mons­ter! But I don't think this has anyt­hing to do with bra­very. I am only sick of this qu­est and an­xi­o­us to bring it to an end. When I ha­ve the ta­lis­man… well, per­haps <emphasis>then</emphasis> I will worry abo­ut how to sa­ve myself from the foe and re­turn to my sis­ters."</p>
   <p>    The cre­atu­res to­ok hold of the punt's stern in the­ir strong jaws and pul­led it in­to the wa­ter.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Share mi­ton with us, and we will be on our way.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    She per­for­med the ri­tu­al, then clim­bed in­to the bo­at. They be­gan to mo­ve up the stre­am that the Wyvi­lo cal­led the Ko­vu­ko, and slowly the sun clim­bed hig­her and the den­se fo­li­age of the Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest be­gan to ste­am. It grew so sultry that Ani­gel shed most of her clot­hing, sa­ve for the new shift she wo­re un­der her hun­ter's tu­nic and Im­mu's bro­ad-brim­med hat.</p>
   <p>    It had surp­ri­sed her that the fo­rest Folk's ho­mes we­re so richly fur­nis­hed with hu­man lu­xu­ri­es. The mo­dest Nysso­mu of Tre­vis­ta had ho­use­hold go­ods and gar­ments mostly of the­ir own ma­nu­fac­tu­re; but the pla­ces she vi­si­ted bri­efly in Let had be­en cram­med with all man­ner of Ru­wen­di­an and La­bor­no­ki things - iron ket­tles and sil­ver spo­ons, fancy oil-lamps and gilt can­de­lab­ras, ex­pen­si­ve le­at­her fur­ni­tu­re, se­ed-pop­pers and to­as­ting forks, ta­pest­ri­es and pa­in­tings, plush toy ani­mals, rugs, harps and man­do­lins and bag­pi­pes, sa­tin cus­hi­ons, por­ce­la­in and fancy glas­swa­re, pla­ying cards, ga­me bo­ards, and every sort of de­co­ra­ti­ve trin­ket or knick­knack that the Dylex craf­ters had ever in­ven­ted. Spe­aker Sas­stu-Cha and his wi­fe had even ow­ned a cop­per hip­bath, of which they we­re inor­di­na­tely pro­ud. Ani­gel had so­aked in it and was­hed with per­fu­med so­ap. The fresh clot­hing she wo­re ca­me from the Spe­aker's su­ba­dult child­ren, who we­re fad­dishly fond of cer­ta­in kinds of hu­man garb.</p>
   <p>    Once she be­ca­me used to the­ir for­bid­ding fa­ces and rat­her grumpy man­ne­risms, Ani­gel qu­ite li­ked the Wyvi­lo. They we­re a forth­right pe­op­le who wor­ked very hard du­ring the dry se­ason and fo­ught ne­ver-ending bat­tles with the­ir po­orer Glis­mak co­usins du­ring the Ra­ins. The Spe­aker con­fi­ded to her sadly that the hu­man tra­ders had pla­ced an em­bar­go upon one kind of go­ods only: no we­aponry was ever tra­ded for Wyvi­lo fo­rest pro­ducts.</p>
   <p>    "Both Ru­wen­di­ans and La­bor­no­ki hold fast to this po­licy in the­ir own self-inte­rest," Sas­stu-Cha had told her. "For if we had mo­dern we­apons - swords and lan­ce­he­ads of ste­el, and po­wer­ful cros­sbows - we wo­uld be ab­le to de­fe­at the Glis­mak on­ce and for all, and ex­tend our sway down the en­ti­re Gre­at Mu­tar in­to the land of Var, and sell our tim­ber to the agents of King Fi­ode­lon mo­re easily and pro­fi­tably."</p>
   <p>    Anigel had not known what to say. "It do­es not se­em fa­ir to deny yo­ur pe­op­le the me­ans to de­fend them­sel­ves. On the ot­her hand, my lit­tle co­untry lays cla­im to the nort­hern Tas­sa­le­yo and de­pends upon its tim­ber-exports to sup­port its eco­nomy. Su­rely the­re must be a way to comp­ro­mi­se, so that both Wyvi­lo and Ru­wen­di­ans can li­ve sa­fely and pros­pe­ro­usly."</p>
   <p>    "If the­re is, only you Ru­wen­di­ans can find it."</p>
   <p>    "But we no lon­ger ru­le. You know that La­bor­nok has crus­hed us!"</p>
   <p>    "Are you so su­re? What of this ta­lis­man you se­ek? Is it not to pro­vi­de yo­ur sal­va­ti­on?"</p>
   <p>    "The Three He­aded Mons­ter?" Ani­gel ga­ve a sad lit­tle la­ugh. "Do you re­al­ly think I can ta­me such a thing and send it aga­inst our foe?"</p>
   <p>    "No," the Spe­aker had sa­id. "Not if yo­ur qu­est ends with the Three He­aded Mons­ter we know."</p>
   <p>    He re­fu­sed flatly to desc­ri­be this thing furt­her. But be­fo­re Ani­gel de­par­ted from Let, he told her: "So­on it will be the Fe­ast of the Three Mo­ons. You can see, when they ri­se in the night sky, that the orbs are dra­wing clo­ser and clo­ser to each ot­her, in the kind of co­nj­unc­ti­on that only oc­curs on­ce in a tho­usand li­fe­ti­mes. If it hap­pens that this ye­ar the mo­ons co­nj­o­in, then a gre­at won­der work will cer­ta­inly ta­ke pla­ce. And it co­uld con­cern you, O Pe­tal of the Li­ving Tril­li­um…"</p>
   <p>    Anigel's bo­at mo­ved up Ko­vu­ko Stre­am and the fo­rest on eit­her si­de chan­ged cha­rac­ter, be­co­ming dryer and less cho­ked with un­derg­rowth. Many of the lofty co­lum­nar tre­es grew he­re; but the­re we­re ot­hers as well, of a most unu­su­al as­pect. They we­re abo­ut three ti­mes the he­ight of a hu­man be­ing, her­ba­ce­o­us rat­her than wo­ody. At the­ir ba­se was an open ro­set­te of thick le­aves, so­me in­di­vi­du­al tre­es ha­ving le­aves co­lo­red purp­lish gre­en, whi­le ot­hers had le­aves swir­led with pat­terns of va­ri­ega­ted gre­en-gold. From the cen­ter of the ro­set­te grew a sto­ut fleshy trunk stud­ded with short branc­hes, each one of which had smal­ler le­aves, to­get­her with bril­li­ant flo­wers of lus­ci­o­us pink or ma­gen­ta, and pen­du­lo­us clus­ters of fru­it ha­ving a most de­lec­tab­le smell. Atop the trunk was anot­her clus­ter of lar­ger le­aves cur­ving up­ward, for­ming a kind of cha­li­ce. The as­pect of the tre­es was exo­tic but very ap­pe­aling. They se­emed al­most li­ke gi­gan­tic gob­lets with ela­bo­ra­tely be­j­ewe­led stems.</p>
   <p>    Charmed, Ani­gel pro­po­sed stop­ping and gat­he­ring so­me of this stran­ge tree's fru­it.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Nay, fri­end. It wo­uld be yo­ur last me­al.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Oh! Are the fru­its po­ison?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>They are de­li­ci­o­us. But the tree uses them to ba­it its trap.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    With a shi­ver of fe­ar, Ani­gel re­cal­led cer­ta­in words of Spe­aker Sas­stu-Cha: "The tre­es of that pla­ce are as vo­ra­ci­o­us as the Glis­mak them­sel­ves…"</p>
   <p>    "They-they wo­uld <emphasis>eat</emphasis> me?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Or us, fri­end. Or any cre­atu­re fo­olish eno­ugh to to­uch the temp­ting of­fe­rings that dang­le from the­ir trunks.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    They mo­ved on up the stre­am, which now be­gan to nar­row ra­pidly and be­co­me mo­re cho­ked with rocks. The­re we­re fe­wer and fe­wer of the co­lum­nar "nor­mal" tre­es now, and mo­re of the gob­lets, to­get­her with many ot­her spe­ci­es of si­nis­ter ap­pe­aran­ce. The land on eit­her si­de of the stre­am ro­se, and they en­te­red a wi­de, hu­mid can­yon. Stran­gely, no birds sang nor did Ani­gel see any ani­mals. The fo­rest was very qu­i­et ex­cept for the tumb­ling wa­ters of the cre­ek and one far-dis­tant scre­am that she he­ard, which then stop­ped ab­ruptly.</p>
   <p>    When the sun was ne­arly over­he­ad, the two ri­mo­riks drew the punt up be­low a patch of whi­te­wa­ter thick with bo­ul­ders. For mo­re than an ho­ur now they had pus­hed the bo­at slowly from be­hind, squ­ir­ming and hum­ping thro­ugh wa­ter that was no lon­ger de­ep eno­ugh to swim in, whi­le the banks grew ste­eper and the co­untry mo­re rocky. Now the two gre­en-dap­pled cre­atu­res tur­ned the­ir gre­at dark eyes upon the Prin­cess and spo­ke the men­tal words she had an­ti­ci­pa­ted with dre­ad:</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Friend, we can ta­ke you no fur­t­her.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Yes, I see. The wa­ter abo­ve the ra­pids is much too shal­low."</p>
   <p>    Slowly, she put her hun­ting garb back on. The fri­endly Wyvi­lo yo­uths had gi­ven her blue bo­ots, a knee-length tu­nic of blue le­at­her, and an or­na­te belt that she had ho­oked her wal­let to. The la­ce trim­ming of her new shift sho­wed at the sle­eves and hem of the tu­nic in a way no re­al hun­ter wo­uld ha­ve to­le­ra­ted, but she did not ca­re; she had so lon­ged to fe­el so­met­hing soft and cle­an next to her skin. Chec­king her sup­pli­es, she de­ci­ded to le­ave Im­mu's ra­in­ca­pe be­hind. Her garb was now we­at­herp­ro­of eno­ugh if it sho­uld storm aga­in, and she no lon­ger ca­red whet­her hands or fa­ce got wet.</p>
   <p>    She strap­ped on her pack, set­tled Im­mu's grass hat, and as an af­tert­ho­ught ar­ran­ged her small dag­ger whe­re it co­uld easily be pul­led out. Then she sa­id to the ri­mo­riks:</p>
   <p>    "My de­ar fri­ends, what will you do now? Yo­ur ho­me is so far away that I do not see how you can ever re­turn. And this is my do­ing. Is it pos­sib­le for you to ma­ke a li­fe for yo­ur­sel­ves in this fo­rest?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>There are no­ne of our kind he­re. Only dis­tant re­la­ti­ves. But that do­es not mat­ter. We will wa­it he­re for you, with the bo­at, un­til you ha­ve ful­fil­led yo­ur qu­est. Then we will all re­turn to­get­her to our own co­untry.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Tears blur­red Ani­gel's vi­si­on. Stumb­ling a lit­tle, she step­ped in­to the cre­ek to kiss the top of each wet, glossy he­ad. Then they all three sha­red mi­ton.</p>
   <p>    Again, away in the dis­tan­ce but ec­ho­ing now aga­inst the can­yon walls, the­re so­un­ded an ago­ni­zed scre­am. Ani­gel pre­ten­ded not to he­ar it as she re­set­tled her pack. A fa­int tra­il be­gin­ning abo­ve the ra­pids pa­ral­le­led the cre­ek on one bank and led up-stre­am. With a last wa­ve to her fri­ends, she set off alo­ne in­to the fo­rest.</p>

   <p>    It was the most fright­ful he­adac­he Ha­ra­mis had ever had in all her li­fe, and she mo­aned as she sat up in the gre­at bed, and clas­ped her throb­bing skull with both hands. She cur­sed her­self for a fo­ol, trying to re­mem­ber exactly what had hap­pe­ned on the pre­vi­o­us night. But pa­in and na­usea de­fe­ated her.</p>
   <p>    Had he cast a spell upon her, sap­ping her wil­lpo­wer, de­ce­iving and ens­na­ring her?</p>
   <p>    "I wal­ked in­to his trap li­ke a ga­uze­wing flying in­to a lin­git-web! I was as reck­less as Ka­di­ya ever co­uld be, and even sil­li­er than Ani­gel! Oh, my he­ad hurts."</p>
   <p>    Blearily, she pe­ered abo­ut her pri­son.</p>
   <p>    One wall of the cham­ber was cut sto­ne hung with ta­pest­ri­es, and the­re we­re two small gla­zed win­dows thro­ugh which she co­uld see grey day­light and snow thickly fal­ling. New cand­les in gilt scon­ces lit the ot­her walls of rich wo­od wa­ins­co­ting, hung with pa­in­tings of stran­ge lands­ca­pes. The­re was a brisk fi­re in a fi­rep­la­ce fra­med in co­lo­red ti­les and ha­ving cu­ri­o­usly wro­ught an­di­rons. But she was surp­ri­sed to fe­el warm air al­so co­ming from a small gril­le in the wall next to the bed.</p>
   <p>    She saw the do­or. It was of he­avy gon­da-wo­od, car­ved in a pat­tern of stars, and had iron bands and hin­ges and a mas­si­ve lock-pla­te.</p>
   <p>    Locked in. Trap­ped.</p>
   <p>    How?</p>
   <p>    The ca­no­pi­ed bed with its downy com­for­ter, soft she­ets, and bro­ca­de han­gings…</p>
   <p>    She re­mem­be­red Oro­gas­tus le­ading her to it when her sen­ses had be­gun to fa­il, af­ter they had sat long to­get­her by the fi­re con­ver­sing and sip­ping cup af­ter cup of warm brandy. He had la­ug­hed as he clo­sed the do­or, and the click of the lock had fol­lo­wed, and for so­me stran­ge re­ason she had burst in­to te­ars. Then diz­zi­ness had overw­hel­med her as she sat on the bed's ed­ge, and with her last strength she had pul­led off her outer gar­ments and ret­re­ated in­to black­ness.</p>
   <p>    Poison. Had he tri­ed to po­ison her, to ste­al -</p>
   <p>    She lif­ted one sha­king hand. But the ta­lis­man still hung sa­fe bet­we­en her bre­asts, sus­pen­ded by its gol­den cha­in. The wand. The Three-Win­ged Circ­le.</p>
   <p>    "Thank the Lords of the Air - "</p>
   <p>    There was a knock at the do­or.</p>
   <p>    "Go away," she mo­aned. "Can you not let me pe­rish in pe­ace?"</p>
   <p>    "Haramis, you are not dying," Oro­gas­tus sa­id calmly. "Open the do­or."</p>
   <p>    "You ha­ve loc­ked me in yo­ur­self, vil­la­in!"</p>
   <p>    "Look on the tab­le in front of the fi­re, Ha­ra­mis."</p>
   <p>    Slowly, to pre­vent her po­un­ding he­ad from bre­aking in­to pi­eces, she ro­se and slid out from un­der the co­vers. The­re we­re black fur slip­pers on the rug be­si­de the bed, and a dres­sing-gown of he­avy qu­il­ted black vel­vet lay ne­atly fol­ded on a ne­arby bench. Ha­ving ma­na­ged to put the­se on, Ha­ra­mis tot­te­red over to the fi­re.</p>
   <p>    A gra­ce­ful lit­tle tab­le and a cha­ir up­hols­te­red in red le­at­her sto­od the­re. On the tab­le was a bas­ket of bre­ad-rol­ls and a sil­ver-gilt stand with crystal pots of jam. The­re was al­so a tall sil­ver ewer, ste­aming spi­cily from its spo­ut. And lying on a fol­ded nap­kin of fi­ne li­nen was a big brass key.</p>
   <p>    "Please let me in," the sor­ce­rer sa­id. "It gri­eves me that you are suf­fe­ring. I swe­ar that I me­an you no harm."</p>
   <p>    Was he lying? Did she ca­re? Wha­te­ver he did to her, she co­uldn't fe­el much wor­se than she did al­re­ady.</p>
   <p>    She pic­ked up the key, stag­ge­red to the do­or, and af­ter so­me fumb­ling ma­na­ged to turn the key in the lock.</p>
   <p>    He tur­ned the latch-ring and en­te­red, tall and dres­sed all in whi­te. She felt one strong arm sup­port her and le­ad her to the cha­ir in front of the fi­re. She col­lap­sed in­to it.</p>
   <p>    "You co­uld ha­ve ope­ned the do­or qu­ite easily yo­ur­self," she mumb­led, ac­cu­sing. "Don't deny it! You wo­uld not even ha­ve had to blast it with yo­ur light­nings. What lock co­uld rest­ra­in a sor­ce­rer? You or one of yo­ur at­ten­dant de­mons must ha­ve be­en in the ro­om al­re­ady, for the fi­re is lit and the tab­le la­id!"</p>
   <p>    He was po­uring so­me of the hot li­qu­id in­to the cup. It was dar­ci tea, and the smell of it ra­ised her spi­rits the me­rest bit.</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ve no at­ten­dants in this pla­ce. And I was not in the ro­om, alt­ho­ugh I did ca­use the fi­re to burn and the fo­od to ap­pe­ar. That was what I wo­uld call ne­ces­sary ma­gic." His de­ep vo­ice was che­er­ful. "I ad­mit I co­uld ha­ve for­ced the lock, but that is hardly the way to tre­at a gu­est. Now drink yo­ur tea and eat yo­ur bre­ak­fast. I as­su­re you that you will fe­el bet­ter af­ter that. Then, if you fe­el you can for­gi­ve me, co­me aga­in to my lib­rary in the ma­in to­wer and we will re­su­me our in­ter­rup­ted con­ver­sa­ti­on of last night."</p>
   <p>    She re­gar­ded him with de­ep une­asi­ness. "And if I dec­li­ne to ac­cept yo­ur hos­pi­ta­lity any lon­ger?"</p>
   <p>    He bo­wed his he­ad, con­ce­aling his fa­ce. "Yo­ur lam­mer­ge­i­er sle­eps on the top of this tur­ret. It wo­uld co­me if you cal­led. In the cham­ber ac­ross the cor­ri­dor the­re is a bal­cony - co­ve­red with snow and ice, but with plenty of ro­om for you to mo­unt and fly off to whe­re­ver you cho­ose… if that is re­al­ly what you want to do."</p>
   <p>    He went out the open do­or and clo­sed it softly be­hind him.</p>
   <p>    Haramis got up from the tab­le and went to one of the win­dows. In spi­te of the blo­wing snow, she co­uld see the dark chasm that split the flank of Mo­unt Brom and iso­la­ted the to­wer of Oro­gas­tus from the pas­sab­le re­gi­on op­po­si­te. How had <emphasis>he</emphasis> got­ten he­re from the Ci­ta­del? Su­rely he co­uld not fly! And what <emphasis>had</emphasis> they tal­ked of last night?</p>
   <p>    Haramis re­mem­be­red cle­arly co­ming to the to­wer yes­ter­day eve­ning, and Oro­gas­tus stan­ding in the open do­or­way of the ga­te­ho­use, sil­ho­u­et­ted aga­inst the light, wel­co­ming her as a gu­est long ex­pec­ted. He had be­en po­li­te but not pre­sump­tu­o­us, se­eming no sor­ce­rer at all but only the well-bred lord of a rat­her un­con­ven­ti­onal ma­nor ho­use.</p>
   <p>    His ha­ir was the bright whi­te of sum­mer clo­uds, worn long to fra­me a co­un­te­nan­ce ma­tu­re but un­li­ned. The eyes that had bla­zed li­ke ba­le­ful stars in her dre­ams and fan­ci­es now se­emed to be the co­lor of very de­ep wa­ter. He wo­re a lo­osely bel­ted ru­nic, nar­row trews, and soft sho­es - all spot­les­sly whi­te. Aro­und his neck was a pla­ti­num cha­in with a lar­ge me­dal­li­on be­aring the emb­lem of a many-ra­yed star.</p>
   <p>    He had pla­yed the gra­ci­o­us host, sho­wing her thro­ugh cer­ta­in parts of the to­wer such as the so­lar, the mu­sic ro­om (this had surp­ri­sed her), the gre­at lib­rary, and fi­nal­ly his per­so­nal study. The­re, a crack­ling fi­re had ba­nis­hed any tho­ught of the snows­torm how­ling out­si­de. The flo­or was co­ve­red with fur rugs, and a cand­le­lit tab­le was set for two.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus had co­oked her a simp­le sup­per with his own hands. And then they had sat to­get­her on the rug be­fo­re the fi­re, drin­king brandy…</p>
   <p>    "What did I tell him? "she as­ked her­self. But she co­uld not re­mem­ber.</p>
   <p>    She ate one bre­ad-roll, slowly, and fi­nis­hed most of the tea.</p>
   <p>    A small do­or she had not no­ti­ced ear­li­er led to an adj­acent bath-cham­ber, cle­verly fit­ted and sump­tu­o­usly de­sig­ned. Fla­me­less lights wit­hin crystal shells flas­hed on as she step­ped in­to the ro­om. Both walls and flo­or we­re ti­led in pa­le gre­en and warm to the to­uch -he­ated by a cent­ral hypo­ca­ust, she sup­po­sed. The­re was a tall gold-fra­med mir­ror and a dres­sing tab­le with gol­den combs and brus­hes, a lar­ge col­lec­ti­on of ot­her ex­qu­isi­tely ma­de to­ilet­ri­es, and lit­tle pots of cos­me­tics, bot­tles of frag­rant es­sen­ces to per­fu­me the wa­ter, and body pow­der with a down puff. Hot and cold wa­ter ca­me of it­self from gilt spi­gots and po­ured in­to a gre­ens­to­ne tub al­most lar­ge eno­ugh to swim in. The wa­ter shut it­self off when the tub was full. The­re we­re stacks of soft to­wels re­ady. Ins­te­ad of a gar­de­ro­be the­re was a wa­ter clo­set, an exo­tic lu­xury she had he­ard of, but ne­ver se­en.</p>
   <p>    Haramis sank hap­pily in­to the warm wa­ter. But even in the wa­ter, she kept the ta­lis­man se­cu­re on its cha­in aro­und her neck.</p>
   <p>    She went to Oro­gas­tus la­ter, dres­sed in the ri­ding clot­hes the Vis­pi had gi­ven her and with her black ha­ir han­ging in a sing­le bra­id down her back. She fo­und him in the lib­rary, po­ring over a gre­at bo­ok, ma­king no­tes on a stran­ge glo­wing tab­let with a stylus. When she ap­pro­ac­hed, he la­id a frin­ged le­at­her bo­ok­mark on the pa­ge and clo­sed the vo­lu­me. The tab­let he to­uc­hed with a fin­ger at one cor­ner; it dim­med, and the wri­ting upon it di­sap­pe­ared.</p>
   <p>    "Do not let me in­ter­rupt," she sa­id ci­vil­ly. "If you wish to re­ad on, it wo­uld gi­ve me ple­asu­re to exa­mi­ne so­me of yo­ur ra­re bo­oks mo­re clo­sely."</p>
   <p>    "Your scho­larly inc­li­na­ti­on is fa­med thro­ug­ho­ut the pe­nin­su­la, Lady. It was one re­ason why my ro­yal mas­ter, King Volt­rik, pro­po­sed mar­ri­age to you."</p>
   <p>    She ut­te­red a small la­ugh. "One re­ason, for­so­oth!" She bent, ca­su­al­ly, to exa­mi­ne the tab­let. "What is this? I saw you insc­ri­be words upon it, and yet the tab­let is now blank."</p>
   <p>    His exp­res­si­on was ne­ut­ral. "It is a de­vi­ce of the Va­nis­hed Ones, and all such are ma­gic."</p>
   <p>    "I am not so su­re of that," she sa­id slowly. <emphasis>It do­esn't fe­et ma­gi­cal</emphasis>, she tho­ught. Oro­gas­tus was lo­oking at her sus­pi­ci­o­usly, so she has­tily chan­ged the su­bj­ect. "You told me you ha­ve many of the­ir things."</p>
   <p>    "Yes."</p>
   <p>    She pic­ked up the tab­let idly. "How do­es this work?"</p>
   <p>    "Another ti­me," he sa­id ple­asantly, and tri­ed to ta­ke it from her. But Ha­ra­mis kept a firm hold on it, pul­ling back, and it slip­ped from his fin­gers and struck lightly aga­inst the ta­lis­man han­ging at her bre­ast. A spark crack­led from the wand to the tab­let, and the tab­let's glow va­nis­hed ab­ruptly.</p>
   <p>    Haramis has­tily set it down. <emphasis>Oh, no</emphasis>, she tho­ught une­asily. <emphasis>I didn't me­an to bre­ak it, but will he be­li­eve that</emphasis>-<emphasis>or ca­re</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    Orogastus se­emed to be cont­rol­ling him­self with gre­at dif­fi­culty. Ha­ra­mis ed­ged ner­vo­usly back­ward, away from him, and tuc­ked the Three-Win­ged Circ­le away in­to her bo­di­ce.</p>
   <p>    He pic­ked up the tab­let and pres­sed his fin­ger­tip to it in se­ve­ral pla­ces, but the glow did not re­turn. "It's de­ad," he sa­id bet­we­en clenc­hed te­eth, lif­ting his eyes to gla­re at her.</p>
   <p>    Haramis, who had be­en con­si­de­ring an apo­logy for the da­ma­ge she had inad­ver­tently do­ne, lost her tem­per at that. Her eyes glit­te­red, and her vo­ice shar­pe­ned. "De­ad?" she snap­ped. "That de­vi­ce was ne­ver ali­ve! My pa­rents are de­ad -and at yo­ur ins­ti­ga­ti­on!"</p>
   <p>    He was si­lent.</p>
   <p>    She whir­led away from him and went to the gre­at lib­rary win­dow. The mad dan­cing of the wind-dri­ven snow ref­lec­ted the tur­mo­il that had sud­denly bro­ken out in her mind. Sin­ce the fall of the Ci­ta­del she had not had much le­isu­re to re­mem­ber the events of that day, and they we­re cer­ta­inly so­met­hing she had pre­fer­red not to think abo­ut. But now, sud­denly, the me­mo­ri­es flo­oded back: the squ­ire's ac­co­unt of her fat­her's mur­der, the sight of her mot­her, ble­eding to de­ath… Te­ars stre­amed down Ha­ra­mis's che­eks.</p>
   <p>    "Haramis."</p>
   <p>    She cut him off. "What an idi­ot I ha­ve be­en! You lu­red me he­re with yo­ur black arts, and be­ca­use I am yo­ung and a fo­ol, you we­re ab­le to lull my fe­ars and ma­ke me for­get who you re­al­ly are. And who I am!"</p>
   <p>    He had co­me up be­hind her, and now he la­id a hand on her sho­ul­der and tur­ned her abo­ut. He spo­ke softly, al­most sadly, and the­re we­re tiny sil­very ref­lec­ti­ons from the bliz­zard de­ep in his eyes.</p>
   <p>    "Do you not al­so re­mem­ber that I kis­sed the palm of yo­ur hand, and told you how I had lo­ved you ever sin­ce the wretc­hed Volt­rik sho­wed me yo­ur port­ra­it? And do you not re­mem­ber my tel­ling you how I re­cog­ni­zed you as the one des­ti­ned to sha­re po­wer with me?"</p>
   <p>    "You are the enemy of the Arc­hi­ma­ge who has pro­tec­ted our king­dom so long aga­inst its ene­mi­es. Deny it if you da­re! You are the one res­pon­sib­le for dest­ro­ying the gre­at ba­lan­ce of the world, the one who wors­hips the Dark Po­wers! You wo­uld ste­al my ta­lis­man, and tho­se of my sis­ters - "</p>
   <p>    He kis­sed her.</p>
   <p>    For a mo­ment she sto­od ri­gid in his arms. But his lips we­re swe­et, and warmth from them flo­wed thro­ugh her body. She felt dizzy, as if everyt­hing we­re whir­ling madly abo­ut and he was the only so­lid thing in the ro­om. Her arms en­circ­led him and she clung to him. The ta­lis­man aga­inst her bre­ast war­med with the sur­ging and un­fa­mi­li­ar ener­gi­es, pas­sing first from him in­to her, and then back and forth in mo­un­ting in­ten­sity un­til her lips and body se­emed they wo­uld burst in­to fla­me.</p>
   <p>    In her mind, she he­ard his vo­ice. <emphasis>We are both wi­el­ders of ma­gic, Ha­ra­mis-born to com­mand the stars! They ha­ve li­ed to you, who say I am evil</emphasis>. I<emphasis>am not. I se­ek wis­dom, truth, and the po­wer and joy that go­es with them. Only lis­ten to me! Let me exp­la­in why yo­ur po­or pa­rents di­ed, why I ha­ve suf­fe­red King Volt­rik to carry out this con­qu­est, why you and yo­ur sis­ters we­re pur­su­ed. Let me show you the true im­por­tan­ce of the three ta­lis­mans and the Thre­efold Scept­re of Po­wer! And then ma­ke up yo­ur own mind… yo­ur mind so akin to my own. I ha­ve cal­led out to you over the le­agu­es and drawn you to me. You ca­me fre­ely! You know you did! You know I lo­ve you. Now da­re to lo­ve me in re­turn! Now, Ha­ra­mis. Now</emphasis>…</p>
   <p>    Haramis stir­red. She lif­ted her he­ad, and gently di­sen­ga­ged her­self from his arms. Her body felt stran­ge, her mind be­wil­de­red. "What ha­ve you do­ne to me?"</p>
   <p>    "Haramis, you lo­ve me. Yo­ur body tells me so even as yo­ur he­art tri­es to deny it-"</p>
   <p>    "No! No…"</p>
   <p>    But she was clin­ging to him aga­in. "I am cold. So cold."</p>
   <p>    The flying snow las­hed at the win­dow, se­eking to pe­net­ra­te the glass, to re­ach her, to co­ver her with its pris­ti­ne whi­te­ness and qu­ench the last dwind­ling em­bers that had awa­ke­ned and bla­zed wit­hin her. She saw the Whi­te Lady, dying in so­li­tary pa­in. She saw her­self ref­lec­ted in a mir­ror of black ice.</p>
   <p>    She saw him.</p>
   <p>    "Let us go to yo­ur study," she whis­pe­red at last. "It's much war­mer the­re. I will lis­ten to what you ha­ve to say."</p>
   <p>    But that night, alo­ne in her cham­ber, she re­mem­be­red her pa­rents and cri­ed her­self to sle­ep.</p>

   <p>    Anigel wal­ked slowly but ste­adily, go­ing gra­du­al­ly up­hill along­si­de the dwind­ling wa­ter­co­ur­se. It struck her af­ter a ti­me that she was mo­ving thro­ugh the very kind of stran­ge wo­od­land she had dre­amed of af­ter go­ing over Tass Falls. And-yes! -she had dre­amed the sa­me dre­am aga­in last night, only for­got­ten it: the fo­rest whe­re her Mot­her the Qu­e­en, we­aring her Crown of Sta­te and all the ro­yal re­ga­lia, wal­ked far ahe­ad and she,</p>
   <p>    Anigel, ran af­ter, trying with all of her strength to catch up.</p>
   <p>    Today in re­al li­fe, the­re was no Qu­e­en. Her po­or Mot­her was de­ad. And the Crown was with Ha­ra­mis, he­iress to the thro­ne - if she still li­ved.</p>
   <p>    Anigel's he­art po­un­ded now with exer­ti­on as the tra­il be­ca­me ste­eper. Thank God the ter­rib­le gob­let-tre­es no lon­ger grew so thickly! But a new kind now be­ca­me com­monp­la­ce, ha­ving a most hor­rid ap­pe­aran­ce, that she was ca­re­ful not to to­uch or even co­me clo­se to. The­se tre­es we­re tall and ro­bust, crow­ned by a he­avy he­ad of wiry gre­en fo­li­age. All up and down the­ir smo­oth trunks we­re ovo­id ope­nings ne­arly an ell in length, li­ke ver­ti­cal mo­uths. The­se we­re stud­ded with po­lis­hed gre­en spi­kes all aro­und the ed­ges, li­ke te­eth, and cons­tantly ope­ned and clo­sed from si­de to si­de as tho­ugh the tree we­re bre­at­hing. The mo­ve­ment was ac­com­pa­ni­ed by a soft so­und li­ke the mur­mu­ring of a bre­eze or dis­cor­dant, chil­ling mu­sic. She knew at on­ce that the­se tre­es we­re car­ni­vo­res, even wor­se than the gob­lets. The­ir yaw­ning dark mo­uths so­ught prey: they only ope­ned and clo­sed and sang as she pas­sed. The tre­es sen­sed her. Wan­ted her.</p>
   <p>    "Lords of the Air, what aw­ful things!" Ani­gel to­ok hold of her amu­let as fe­ar grip­ped her on­ce aga­in. And then a new and ter­rib­le re­ali­za­ti­on ca­me ste­aling over her and she be­gan to shud­der, unab­le to ta­ke anot­her step for­ward, and felt the flesh crawl on her ba­re arms.</p>
   <p>    Where was the path?</p>
   <p>    It had di­sap­pe­ared.</p>
   <p>    Only pris­ti­ne ve­ge­ta­ti­on lay be­ne­ath her fe­et. How long had she be­en wal­king off the tra­il? She had no idea. She had only tho­ught of fol­lo­wing the cre­ek. She sto­od pa­raly­zed with fright, sur­ro­un­ded by the monst­ro­us tre­es, not kno­wing which way to turn.</p>
   <p>    "White Lady!" she cri­ed im­pul­si­vely alo­ud. "Help me!"</p>
   <p>    The amu­let in­si­de her clenc­hed fist had be­co­me very warm. When she let it fall free at last, the ho­ney-amber glo­wed brightly even in the bro­ad day­light. The ter­rib­le fan­ged tre­es hum­med and mo­aned all aro­und her, ne­arly drow­ning out the braw­ling lit­tle bro­ok.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>The le­af. Cut the le­af,</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "What? What did you say?" She swung abo­ut, se­eking the one who had spo­ken. But the­re was no one. "Lady - is that you?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>The Black Tril­li­um le­af. Cast it from you. Let it le­ad.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Her hands sho­ok so that she co­uld hardly open the wal­let. Clo­uds had co­me over the sun, brin­ging a glo­omy dusk to the can­yon. She felt as tho­ugh she we­re fre­ezing. The le­af-</p>
   <p>    It crack­led as she drew it forth. The en­ti­re bro­ad bla­de was dry now, dun-co­lo­red ins­te­ad of gre­en. Only at the very tip of the stem re­ma­ined a tiny fleck of gold that glit­te­red even in the de­epe­ning sha­dows.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Cast it forth</emphasis> -</p>
   <p>    Rising on tip­toe, she threw the le­af in­to the air. The­re was no wind, and yet it so­ared slowly away, le­ading her up the cre­ek bank. As tho­ugh she we­re sle­ep­wal­king, she fol­lo­wed. The le­af drif­ted along fas­ter. She be­gan to run. Up­hill. The way ever ste­eper. The un­derg­rowth thic­ker, dar­ker. The­re was only that dan­cing bit of gold on brown, waf­ting ahe­ad, dra­wing her on -</p>
   <p>    She ca­me in­to a cle­aring. It was the can­yon's he­ad, all fra­med in moss-grown rock. The stre­am had its so­ur­ce in a wispy lit­tle trick­le of wa­ter that fell from a tre­men­do­us he­ight, blan­ke­ting the cle­aring in thin mist.</p>
   <p>    And be­si­de the wa­ter­fall grew a tree.</p>
   <p>    It was the most im­men­se li­ving thing she had ever se­en. Be­si­de it, the ot­her fo­rest gi­ants we­re in­sig­ni­fi­cant. Me­re straws. Thirty men co­uld ha­ve sto­od sho­ul­der to sho­ul­der in front of this tree wit­ho­ut gi­ving the me­asu­re of its trunk. It was of the sa­me spe­ci­es as the thorn-ma­wed car­ni­vo­res back along the tra­il, but its mighty bo­le had only a sing­le ope­ning in bet­we­en the but­tres­ses of two ro­ots, and this was of the sa­me si­ze as that of its les­ser kin. Prin­cess Ani­gel sto­od be­fo­re it ut­terly ama­zed, for­get­ting her fe­ar. Her ga­ze lif­ted and she saw that its he­ight ex­ce­eded that of the cliff from which the wa­ter fell.</p>
   <p>    And ins­te­ad of one le­afy he­ad, the tree had three.</p>
   <p>    She ap­pro­ac­hed it, se­e­ing the fan­ged mo­uth cons­tantly open and clo­se, open and clo­se, fas­ter and fas­ter. Its bre­ath was a soft ro­ar of a no­te so de­ep that it might ha­ve es­ca­ped ears less ke­en than hers. And in­si­de the mo­uth was not dark­ness, as in the mo­uths of the smal­ler tre­es, but a rich gol­den glow that was twin to the co­lor of her own amu­let.</p>
   <p>    The Three-He­aded Mons­ter held her ta­lis­man.</p>
   <p>    And its bre­ath ca­me fas­ter and fas­ter be­ca­use it was af­ra­id.</p>
   <p>    "Of me," sa­id Prin­cess Ani­gel. "Afra­id of me!"</p>
   <p>    It was part of the won­der that she knew exactly what to do. At the fo­ot of the lit­tle cas­ca­de lay pi­les of de­ad wo­od, the re­ma­ins of tre­es that had be­en swept over du­ring the se­ason of flo­oding. She to­ok up a so­und bil­let, abo­ut as long as her arm but thic­ker, and wal­ked di­rectly to the ga­ping mo­uth bet­we­en the ro­ots.</p>
   <p>    The glow from the ca­vity in­ten­si­fi­ed and her amu­let bla­zed. Calmly, she held the small log in both hands, ho­ri­zon­tal in front of her. She stu­di­ed the rhythm of the ope­ning and clo­sing for a mo­ment, then with one qu­ick mo­ve­ment thrust her arms in­to the thorny jaws.</p>
   <p>    The mo­uth be­gan to en­gulf the wo­od. And co­uld not. The log was wed­ged aga­inst the ca­vity walls, prop­ping them open.</p>
   <p>    The tree ro­ared.</p>
   <p>    But Ani­gel knew that it was vo­icing fe­ar, not fury. She had let go of the wo­oden bil­let, and now the tree exer­ted its gre­at strength to crush the fo­re­ign thing. The log buck­led and be­gan to splin­ter, but for a mo­ment mo­re the mo­uth was prop­ped open -</p>
   <p>    Quite long eno­ugh for Ani­gel to le­an for­ward over the brist­ling te­eth, snatch the thing that lay wit­hin, and le­ap back out of re­ach be­fo­re the log bro­ke with a gre­at crack and the mo­uth snap­ped tightly shut and re­ma­ined so, the ed­ges of the bark pur­sed in­to a knot hardly as bro­ad as her two fists.</p>
   <p>    Anigel held a co­ro­net, a C-sha­ped open ti­ara of bril­li­ant sil­very me­tal, ha­ving six small cusps and three lar­ger. It was stran­gely and be­a­uti­ful­ly wro­ught with ro­ca­il­le-work scrol­ling, shells and flo­wers, and wit­hin each of the three lar­ger po­ints was a styli­zed gro­tes­que vi­sa­ge. One of the mons­ter-fa­ces had an ope­ning be­ne­ath it - and she knew what fit the­re.</p>
   <p>    Withdrawing to the stre­am­si­de, she sat upon a rock, to­ok off her hat, un­fas­te­ned the cha­in of her tril­li­um amu­let, and slip­ped the gold-fra­med bit of am­ber off. It went per­fectly in­to the ho­le at the front of the co­ro­net, and when it was in pla­ce it co­uld not be re­mo­ved. The fos­sil flo­wer wit­hin the amu­let was now comp­le­tely open ex­cept for a slight cur­ling of the pe­tal ed­ges.</p>
   <p>    Anigel put the co­ro­net on, and went back to stand be­fo­re the tree.</p>
   <p>    It was si­lent, and its mo­uth re­ma­ined tightly clo­sed.</p>
   <p>    "Now the ta­lis­man is mi­ne," Ani­gel told it. "You gu­ar­ded the tre­asu­re well, but I am the one for whom it was in­ten­ded. You do not ha­ve to be af­ra­id. I will le­ave you he­re in pe­ace."</p>
   <p>    She tur­ned away. Stran­gely, her eyes had fil­led with te­ars. She felt a new he­avy we­ight in the pit of her sto­mach and a sen­se that so­met­hing el­se -so­met­hing ter­rib­le -impen­ded. She tho­ught: I ha­ve my ta­lis­man-but it is only one of three. What of my sis­ters?</p>
   <p>    Instantly, the tree and the cle­aring and the wa­ter­fall di­sap­pe­ared.</p>
   <p>    She saw in a flash anot­her pla­ce, a sce­ne de­ep in a swamp overg­rown with hu­ge thorn-ferns. Ka­di­ya!</p>
   <p>    Her sis­ter was cro­uc­hing, te­ar-sta­ined and scre­aming de­fi­an­ce, in the midst of a crowd of ar­med men, knights of La­bor­nok. She wo­re no tril­li­um amu­let, but she held clo­se aga­inst her he­art so­met­hing li­ke a sword, with a pom­mel that glo­wed with a throb­bing am­ber light. And in the backg­ro­und sto­od a tall hi­de­o­us be­ing with gla­ring oran­ge eyes and blo­ods­ta­ined te­eth.</p>
   <p>    Before Ani­gel co­uld draw a bre­ath to cry out at the aw­ful sight the pic­tu­re was go­ne. She saw ins­te­ad a cozy to­wer ro­om in so­me ke­ep, with rich han­gings and fur rugs upon the flo­or and a tab­le spil­ling over with stacks of an­ci­ent bo­oks. A hand­so­me man with snow-whi­te ha­ir we­aring a ro­be of black and sil­ver sat on cus­hi­ons be­fo­re a fi­re, with a lo­vely yo­ung dark ha­ired wo­man be­si­de him.</p>
   <p>    He kis­sed the palm of her left hand. In the ot­her she held a wand of bright me­tal, top­ped by an open sil­very circ­le, with three fol­ded wings sur­mo­un­ting it. And the wo­man was Ha­ra­mis…</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>No! No!</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Anigel to­re the co­ro­net from her brow and das­hed it on­to the mossy fo­rest flo­or.</p>
   <p>    No - the vi­si­ons li­ed. Bra­ve Ka­di­ya in the hands of La­bor­no­ki, thre­ate­ned by Skri­tek? Wi­se Ha­ra­mis con­sor­ting with the fo­ul sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus? Ne­ver! Ne­ver!</p>
   <p>    If the­se two we­re in­de­ed lost then who was the wo­man prop­he­si­ed who wo­uld overth­row La­bor­nok and res­to­re Ru­wen­da? Her­self? How ri­di­cu­lo­us! What a joke! What a cru­el, cru­el joke…</p>
   <p>    She flung her­self on the gro­und and sob­bed as tho­ugh her he­art wo­uld bre­ak, crin­ging away from the dis­car­ded co­ro­net as tho­ugh it we­re truly as lo­ath­so­me as its na­me. So this was her ta­lis­man! The end of her long qu­est, the ful­fil­lment of the Whi­te Lady's so­lemn com­mand! The ta­lis­man was a li­ar - a spin­ner of night­ma­res wor­se than any her own cra­ven self co­uld ever con­coct. It was not­hing but a Mons­ter.</p>
   <p>    … But in her dre­am, Qu­e­en Ka­lant­he had sa­id that her sis­ters had go­ne on ot­her ro­ads. It was she, Ani­gel, who was be­ing was­hed and re­adi­ed for-what?</p>
   <p>    Gradually her sob­bing eased, her bre­at­hing slo­wed and be­ca­me mo­re re­gu­lar, and she fell fast as­le­ep.</p>
   <p>    She wo­ke sud­denly an ho­ur la­ter. Had the­re be­en a so­und? Per­haps one of tho­se myste­ri­o­us scre­ams? She was un­su­re. At any ra­te, she felt much bet­ter. She bat­hed her fa­ce in the stre­am­let, was­hed her hands, and ate a bit. Then she pic­ked up the co­ro­net and stu­di­ed it for a long ti­me. The three gro­tes­que fa­ces on it se­emed to be smi­ling slyly.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>It is a sign</emphasis>, she de­ci­ded, <emphasis>and a to­ol. I know one thing it can do; co­nj­ure vi­si­ons. But whet­her tho­se vi­si­ons are the em­bo­di­ment of my own fe­ars or true things I can­not tell. But I am go­ing to find out</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    She put it firmly on her he­ad, and Im­mu's hat over it, and star­ted back the way she had co­me.</p>
   <p>    "My Prin­ce, the punts can go no furt­her."</p>
   <p>    The ser­ge­ant who had be­en po­ling the le­ad-bo­at up Ko­vu­ko Stre­am cal­led out the un­wel­co­me news, whe­re­upon the strag­gling string of over­lo­aded craft all gat­he­red to­get­her in a rocky po­ol be­low a stretch of ro­ugh wa­ter whe­re the cre­ek ran hardly calf-de­ep.</p>
   <p>    Antar, his knights, and the Blue Vo­ice gat­he­red in one gro­up to con­fer, whi­le the ex­ha­us­ted sol­di­er-bo­at­men ref­res­hed them­sel­ves by slos­hing abo­ut in the stre­am, munc­hing so­me of the­ir me­ager ra­ti­ons, and lying in the sha­de of the pe­cu­li­ar gob­let-tre­es. No­ne of the La­bor­no­ki knew the true na­tu­re of the gob­lets; but they had le­ar­ned well the les­son of avo­iding unk­nown fru­its, and so left the of­fe­rings of the tre­es un­mo­les­ted.</p>
   <p>    "From he­re we must walk," An­tar sa­id. "Sin­ce the he­at is so op­pres­si­ve, I sug­gest that we doff all ar­mor sa­ve for our hel­mets, bre­astp­la­tes, and back­pi­eces - "</p>
   <p>    "My Prin­ce!" the ser­ge­ant sho­uted from the op­po­si­te si­de of the stre­am. "I think I ha­ve fo­und tra­ces of the fu­gi­ti­ve!"</p>
   <p>    They all went splas­hing over, and the­re be­ne­ath the gre­at dro­oping fronds of a patch of fod­der­fern they fo­und one of the oddly ma­de Wyvi­lo bo­ats. In its bot­tom was fol­ded ne­atly a small le­at­her ra­in­ca­pe of Nysso­mu de­sign.</p>
   <p>    "This ca­pe is of the style worn at Tre­vis­ta," the ser­ge­ant sa­id. "I re­mem­ber well the stam­ped de­co­ra­ti­on abo­ut the ho­od. Such we­re of­fe­red for sa­le in the mar­ket of Lu­sa­gi­ra Squ­are. It may be­long to the Prin­cess."</p>
   <p>    The Blue Vo­ice pus­hed for­ward thro­ugh the crowd of knights. "Gi­ve it to me. I will su­bj­ect it to a test."</p>
   <p>    With the gar­ment held tightly in his bony hands, he threw back his sha­ven he­ad and clo­sed his eyes. "Dark Po­wers, he­ar me! Re­ve­al to thy sup­pli­ant who has worn this ca­pe." He lif­ted the thing to his nost­rils and bre­at­hed of it, and then in­to­ned in a very dif­fe­rent vo­ice: "It has be­en worn by Im­mu, ser­vant to the ro­yal fa­mily of Ru­wen­da, and Ani­gel, Prin­cess of Ru­wen­da."</p>
   <p>    "Zoto's stri­pes!" cri­ed the de­ligh­ted Sir Ri­nu­tar. "A true sign of the wench at last! I had be­gun to think we pur­su­ed a phan­tom."</p>
   <p>    The Blue Vo­ice ope­ned his eyes, res­to­red his ho­od, and tos­sed the ca­pe back in­to the trans­lu­cent ca­noe. "The Prin­cess had it clo­se to her not mo­re than two ho­urs ago. We must be ne­arly upon her. It be­ho­oves us to mo­ve on and was­te no mo­re ti­me."</p>
   <p>    "Very well," sa­id the Prin­ce. "Ser­ge­ant, as­semb­le yo­ur men. And you, my com­pa­ni­ons, pre­pa­re to - "</p>
   <p>    A scre­am ca­me from the gro­ve of gob­let-tre­es ac­ross the cre­ek. With an oath, the Prin­ce whir­led abo­ut. He saw a sing­le sol­di­er co­me run­ning down to the sho­re, yel­ling and cur­sing. The ser­ge­ant hur­ri­ed to see what had be­fal­len, fol­lo­wed by the nob­le party.</p>
   <p>    "It ate po­or old Go­mi!" the wild-eyed fel­low dec­la­red. "Swal­lo­wed him slick as fog­ber­ry jam!"</p>
   <p>    Everyone be­gan to sho­ut at on­ce, but the ser­ge­ant cal­led for two of his sol­di­ers to ta­ke up the­ir we­apons, and sa­id to the Prin­ce, "Let me go and in­ves­ti­ga­te."</p>
   <p>    He re­tur­ned in a few mo­ments sto­ne-fa­ced and re­por­ted: "It was one of the stran­ge cup-sha­ped tre­es, my Prin­ce. The man-at-arms Gom­la­dik ven­tu­red to re­li­eve him­self aga­inst its trunk, and ac­cor­ding to the wit­ness fo­ur slen­der arms li­ke gre­at worms is­su­ed from the tree's open crown, la­id hold of him, and ho­is­ted him aloft."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­ce and the knights now ac­com­pa­ni­ed the ser­ge­ant de­eper in­to the gro­ve, whe­re the gob­let-tre­es sto­od in­no­cu­o­us as a disp­lay in a bi­zar­re jewe­ler's shop. But one tree was gu­ar­ded by two sol­di­ers, and its up­per le­aves had now clo­sed in upon them­sel­ves, gi­ving the ap­pe­aran­ce of a lar­ge ball. From the in­ters­ti­ces of this oozed red blo­od and bo­dily flu­ids, which flo­wed down the trunk and pud­dled wit­hin the ot­her le­aves spla­yed on the gro­und.</p>
   <p>    They all re­gar­ded the sight with hor­ror and re­vul­si­on; but be­fo­re anot­her word co­uld be sa­id mo­re sho­uting bro­ke out among the men left at the cre­ek si­de.</p>
   <p>    "To arms! To arms! Hos­ti­le na­ti­ves ap­pro­ach!"</p>
   <p>    The de­vo­ured Gom­la­dik was for­got­ten. An­tar, Sir Owa­non, and the ser­ge­ant led the ra­ce back to the wa­ter, sho­uting or­ders. In mo­ments, sol­di­ers we­re man­hand­ling the wo­oden punts out of the stre­am as fast as they co­uld and pi­ling them up to form an imp­ro­vi­sed bar­ri­ca­de. Knights clap­ped on the­ir helms and drew the­ir swords whi­le the sol­di­ers ar­mo­red them­sel­ves as best they co­uld and re­adi­ed the­ir cros­sbows. Sacks of sup­pli­es, dis­car­ded clot­hing, and odd bits of equ­ip­ment lit­te­red the bank and even drif­ted slowly downst­re­am.</p>
   <p>    And it was at on­ce very qu­i­et.</p>
   <p>    "Blue Vo­ice," whis­pe­red the Prin­ce from be­hind his over­tur­ned bo­at. "Ha­ve you far­se­en the foe?"</p>
   <p>    "A mo­ment… a mo­ment." The sor­ce­rer's mi­ni­on lay ne­ar the bar­ri­ca­de's end, squ­as­hed bet­we­en Sir Ri­nu­tar and a sol­di­er, in an at­ti­tu­de un­con­ge­ni­al to tran­cing. He pul­led him­self to­get­her, his eye-soc­kets se­emed to empty, and he fro­ze. "Yes, I see them! Ac­ross the stre­am, lur­king among the kil­ler-tre­es. The­re are twenty… forty… Dark Po­wers for­fend, so many I can scar­cely co­unt! And they be not Wyvi­lo, my Prin­ce. The­se na­ti­ves are lar­ger and al­to­get­her mo­re ter­rib­le in as­pect -be­yond do­ubt, the can­ni­bal Glis­mak!"</p>
   <p>    "Enough," An­tar sa­id. And to the ot­hers: "My men, ha­ve co­ura­ge. They are Od­dling sa­va­ges, for all the­ir fe­ar­so­me lo­ok, and in­fe­ri­or to us. We can yet win the day."</p>
   <p>    "Look," Owa­non sa­id qu­i­etly. "The first of them."</p>
   <p>    Six be­ings sto­le thro­ugh the ferny un­derg­rowth and sto­od po­ised on the op­po­si­te bank not ten ells dis­tant. They we­re less hu­ma­no­id than the Wyvi­lo and tal­ler than men, and car­ri­ed long spe­ars po­in­ted with flint. They wo­re no clot­hing, but a few had jewe­led or­na­ments and all wo­re belts, from which sto­ne ma­ces and ot­her imp­le­ments of war hung. The­ir he­ads we­re muz­zled and the­ir te­eth, es­pe­ci­al­ly the two prot­ru­ding tusks in front, very lar­ge and sharp. De­ep set eyes of a bur­ning red we­re ar­mo­red abo­ut the or­bits with shi­ning skin pla­tes; the­se pla­tes al­so co­ve­red the­ir he­ads and ex­ten­ded down the­ir sho­ul­ders, backs, and up­per arms, and we­re a na­tu­ral part of the­ir bo­di­es. The three-di­git hands and fe­et had both webs and for­mi­dab­le claws. Only a few scat­te­red pla­tes gu­ar­ded the­ir bel­li­es, and the­se and most of the limbs and fa­ce we­re clot­hed in thick rusty-red fur. Scanty fur al­so grew aro­und the mar­gins of the pla­tes, which we­re, in each in­di­vi­du­al, of a slightly dif­fe­rent co­lor and pat­ter­ning. In truth, the Glis­mak had a sa­va­ge be­a­uty abo­ut them - as well as an air of sup­re­me con­fi­den­ce.</p>
   <p>    One of the six step­ped for­ward and be­gan a cro­aking ha­ran­gue, wa­ving his spe­ar. When he fi­nis­hed, he tos­sed the we­apon with all his strength and the sto­ne bla­de sank de­eply in­to the to­ugh wo­od of the Prin­ce's du­go­ut. The ot­her fi­ve Glis­mak coc­ked the­ir arms.</p>
   <p>    "Cross bow­men," An­tar sa­id, "mis­si­les away."</p>
   <p>    A ha­il of iron qu­ar­rels shot ac­ross the stre­am. Fi­ve of the Glis­mak fell, scre­aming hi­de­o­usly. The sixth ut­te­red a trum­pe­ting howl, which was ans­we­red by hund­reds mo­re, and ca­me bo­un­ding over the wa­ter. His fel­lows po­ured from the gob­let-fo­rest be­hind, who­oping and scre­ec­hing, flin­ging the­ir spe­ars and bran­dis­hing the­ir ot­her we­apons.</p>
   <p>    Within se­conds the small for­ce of La­bor­no­ki was en­gul­fed by the hor­de. The cros­sbows be­ca­me use­less at clo­se hand and sol­di­ers fo­ught with short-swords or dag­gers, whi­le the knights la­id abo­ut with the­ir gre­at two-han­ded swords, hac­king and he­wing un­til the she­er press of Glis­mak bo­di­es top­pled them.</p>
   <p>    The ser­ge­ant ma­na­ged to gut two of the mons­ters be­fo­re a third ca­me up be­hind him with open jaws and de­li­ve­red a fa­tal bi­te to his neck. The few sol­di­ers who we­re not overw­hel­med in the first mi­nu­tes ran for the­ir li­ves, only to be cha­sed down by the long-leg­ged bru­tes, who cla­wed the­ir flesh from the­ir bo­nes. The fal­len we­re im­me­di­ately rent limb from limb and in the midst of bat­tle a di­abo­li­cal fe­ast be­gan. Eerie Glis­mak howls drow­ned out the dying cri­es of the sol­di­ers.</p>
   <p>    By then Prin­ce An­tar and all of his knights we­re dow­ned. But stran­gely eno­ugh the fi­ends did not mang­le them nor strip off the­ir ar­mor, but rat­her to­ok away the­ir swords and trus­sed them hand and fo­ot with raw­hi­de cords, and pic­king them up li­ke dolls tos­sed them clan­king and cur­sing in­to a gre­at blo­ods­ta­ined pi­le.</p>
   <p>    Several sco­re of the vic­to­ri­o­us Glis­mak now be­gan to dan­ce and chant abo­ut the he­ap of help­less hu­mans, who sub­si­ded in­to ho­pe­les­sness and be­gan to say the­ir fi­nal pra­yers. Ot­hers of the man eaters set abo­ut to gat­her dry drift­wo­od from along the cre­ek, which they ma­de in­to a gre­at stack, to­get­her with the La­bor­no­ki punts, and pre­pa­red to set it alight. It was evi­dent that the next co­ur­se of the Glis­mak fe­ast was to be co­oked.</p>
   <p>    "God ha­ve mercy upon us all," mo­aned Prin­ce An­tar, who lay at the top of the tang­led mass of pri­so­ners, "and may he damn the sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus, who sent us to this ig­nob­le de­ath, to the de­epest of the ten pits of hell."</p>
   <p>    The chan­ting and the how­ling of the Glis­mak ab­ruptly bro­ke off.</p>
   <p>    The dan­cing stop­ped. Tho­se of the mob who we­re still fi­nis­hing off tid­bits of raw flesh de­sis­ted from the­ir gru­eso­me fe­eding and sto­od as­to­nis­hed. Every sa­va­ge wit­ho­ut ex­cep­ti­on now was mo­ti­on­less, open-mo­ut­hed, sta­ring at so­met­hing that se­emed to be ap­pro­ac­hing from upst­re­am. An­tar wrig­gled his fet­te­red body abo­ut and fi­nal­ly ga­ined a po­si­ti­on in which he co­uld see for him­self who was co­ming.</p>
   <p>    A wo­man.</p>
   <p>    She sto­od on the small cre­ek si­de path, a do­zen ells from the pi­le of knights and wit­hin arm's re­ach of the ne­arest Glis­mak. She wo­re a hun­ting out­fit of sky-blue le­at­her and had a pack on her back, and in one hand car­ri­ed a bro­ad-brim­med grass hat and in the ot­her a sap­ling cut for a wal­king-stick. Her ha­ir was gol­den and fell be­low her sho­ul­ders in shim­me­ring wa­ves. Res­ting upon her he­ad was a stran­gely wro­ught co­ro­net of shi­ning whi­te me­tal, with tril­li­um am­ber in­set at the front.</p>
   <p>    Her fa­ce was a mask of hor­ror and out­ra­ge and te­ars we­re trick­ling down her che­eks.</p>
   <p>    Prince An­tar's he­art tur­ned over in his bre­ast. He knew that fa­ce, and it was the most be­a­uti­ful he had ever se­en and the only one he had ever lo­ved. It was Prin­cess Ani­gel her­self co­me by misc­han­ce in­to the sce­ne of sla­ugh­ter, and su­rely the fi­ends wo­uld fall upon her next-</p>
   <p>    But they did not. They shrank back as she wal­ked in­to the­ir blo­ods­ta­ined midst, and so­me ut­te­red low grunts and even whim­pers. She lo­oked upon the hu­man bo­nes and torn rem­nants of clot­hing and the he­ap of bo­und ar­mo­red knights who now lay fro­zen in the­ir con­temp­la­ti­on of her auda­city and pe­ril.</p>
   <p>    "What ha­ve you <emphasis>do­ne</emphasis>?" she de­man­ded of the Glis­mak. Te­ars still sho­ne on her fa­ce, but her vo­ice was ste­ady.</p>
   <p>    There we­re scat­te­red growls, and an une­asy his­sing.</p>
   <p>    One in­di­vi­du­al ca­me forth from among tho­se who had dan­ced. He was tal­ler than the rest, and his belt had gol­den studs, and a gold she­ath enc­lo­sed his flint dag­ger. The sca­les of his body we­re richly ador­ned with pa­in­ted de­signs of gre­en and yel­low and scar­let.</p>
   <p>    The Glis­mak chi­ef­ta­in po­in­ted at Ani­gel's co­ro­net with one blo­ody claw and ro­ared a chal­len­ging phra­se in his own lan­gu­age.</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ve a right to we­ar it," the Prin­cess sa­id unf­linc­hingly. She drop­ped the hat and wi­ped the te­ars from her eyes with the back of one hand. "And I say you ha­ve do­ne a wic­ked thing. The­se men we­re my ene­mi­es, not yo­urs. They did you no harm and yet you mas­sac­red them and ate the­ir flesh li­ke be­asts! But you are not be­asts, you are per­sons me­ant to ser­ve the Tri­une God and one anot­her, and what you did was evil."</p>
   <p>    The Glis­mak chi­ef­ta­in ut­te­red a ter­rib­le so­und that co­uld only be la­ugh­ter. And then he lif­ted cla­wed hands, ope­ned his mo­uth so that his kni­fe-li­ke te­eth sho­ne in the glo­omy la­te af­ter­no­on light, and ad­van­ced upon the help­less girl.</p>
   <p>    Anigel po­in­ted her wal­king-stick at him and sa­id calmly, "Lords of the Air, de­fend me."</p>
   <p>    From out of the over­cast and lo­uring sky ca­me a blue bolt of light­ning. It blin­ded the cap­ti­ve knights and its thun­der pa­ined the­ir ears so gre­atly that they ne­arly lost cons­ci­o­us­ness. When they re­ga­ined the­ir wits they saw the Prin­cess stan­ding wi­de-eyed, and the Glis­mak chi­ef­ta­in blas­ted to a smo­king cin­der.</p>
   <p>    The en­ti­re hor­de of can­ni­bal Od­dlings fell on the­ir fa­ces from fe­ar and awe.</p>
   <p>    "Go away!" Ani­gel sa­id in a high, cle­ar vo­ice. "Go away, and don't co­me back."</p>
   <p>    A fi­er­ce he­ad or two lif­ted from the gro­und. The Glis­mak he­si­ta­ted - and then they we­re up and run­ning, the en­ti­re mob of them, how­ling at the top of the­ir lungs, and a few still grow­ling de­fi­an­ce. They cros­sed the stre­am and ra­ced in­to the fo­rest, and we­re lost from sight, and the Prin­cess lo­oked down upon the fu­ming car­cass at her fe­et with both as­to­nish­ment and fe­ar.</p>
   <p>    Now An­tar cri­ed out: "Prin­cess Ani­gel! We he­re yet li­ve. Will you set us free?"</p>
   <p>    She snap­ped out of her re­ve­rie and ca­me run­ning, and with her small dag­ger cut the raw­hi­de thongs. The knights sor­ted them­sel­ves out, and the un­hurt among them hel­ped the wo­un­ded unst­rap the­ir ar­mor and go down to the wa­ter. Prin­ce An­tar, when he had do­ne what he co­uld, went to Ani­gel and lo­we­red him­self to his kne­es be­fo­re her.</p>
   <p>    "Princess, I ha­ve no sword to sur­ren­der to you. So I, An­tar, Crown Prin­ce of La­bor­nok, sur­ren­der my body and so­ul. I can­not be yo­ur enemy. You are nob­le and go­od and tho­se who com­man­ded me to pur­sue you and put you to de­ath are evil. If you wo­uld blast me to de­ath as you did yon bru­tish wretch, then that is only the pu­nish­ment I de­ser­ve. But if you will spa­re me I will ser­ve you fa­ith­ful­ly as yo­ur sla­ve, for the rest of my days."</p>
   <p>    "And I," sa­id Sir Owa­non, co­ming for­ward and al­so kne­eling.</p>
   <p>    "And I," gro­aned Sir Pe­na­pat, who was ha­ving his wo­unds was­hed.</p>
   <p>    This knight and that ec­ho­ed the­se two, and the ones who we­re ab­le-bo­di­ed ca­me to kne­el, un­til only Sir Ri­nu­tar and two of his hench­men, On­bo­gar and Tu­rat, sto­od back.</p>
   <p>    Suddenly the mass of ferns that had con­ce­aled Ani­gel's bo­at par­ted, and the­re sit­ting con­ce­aled in the craft was no­ne ot­her than the Blue Vo­ice, who clim­bed out, wa­ded the stre­am, and ap­pro­ac­hed the Prin­cess with an ing­ra­ti­ating smi­le.</p>
   <p>    "Great and po­wer­ful Lady," qu­oth he, ma­king a pro­fo­und bow, "I am sla­ve to anot­her Mas­ter who has bo­und me un­til eter­nity. But I vow to you on his ho­nor to ser­ve and fol­low you as well as I may, and I pla­ce my po­or po­wers at yo­ur com­mand if you will con­des­cend to ac­cept me."</p>
   <p>    As the Blue Vo­ice spo­ke he tur­ned to Ri­nu­tar and the­ir eyes met for an ins­tant. "And per­haps the­se three bra­ve knights, who shrink from res­cin­ding the­ir oaths of fe­alty to La­bor­nok, will jo­in me as I pled­ge a tru­ce to you. We are hu­mans to­get­her, be­le­agu­ered in a stran­ge land, and we sho­uld not be at odds whi­le so ter­rib­le an enemy thre­atens all us.</p>
   <p>    "Aye," Ri­nu­tar grow­led. "I will pled­ge a tru­ce, as will my men."</p>
   <p>    Anigel ga­zed upon the Blue Vo­ice for a mo­ment uns­pe­aking, and al­so stu­di­ed the three. Then she sa­id: "Very well. Ri­se, Prin­ce - and al­so you men who now de­em me yo­ur Lady. In a few ho­urs it will be night­fall. We ha­ve not­hing mo­re to fe­ar from the Glis­mak, but ne­vert­he­less we can­not camp in this pla­ce of di­sas­ter. I will con­fer with the Prin­ce and de­ci­de what we are to do. Me­anw­hi­le, you must gat­her up what we­apons and sup­pli­es you can, and re­mo­ve yo­ur punts from the bon­fi­re stack. But do not te­ar the wo­od­pi­le apart. Rat­her pla­ce on it the sad re­ma­ins of yo­ur com­ra­des, and be­fo­re we qu­it this spot we will fi­re it to the­ir ho­nor."</p>
   <p>    Murmurs of ap­pro­val met her words. She bec­ko­ned for Prin­ce An­tar to fol­low her as she wal­ked a ways down the bank of the stre­am, and when they we­re be­yond ears­hot of the ot­hers sa­id:</p>
   <p>    "The tall man in blue is not to be trus­ted."</p>
   <p>    "I know. He is a Vo­ice of the abo­mi­nab­le sor­ce­rer, Oro­gas­tus. We shall ha­ve to ke­ep clo­se eye on him as we ma­ke our way back… You do in­tend to re­turn to Ru­wen­da, do you not, my Lady?"</p>
   <p>    "In ti­me," sa­id she. Her blue eyes we­re so­lemn and the pu­pils wi­de in the sha­dow. "But first I ha­ve anot­her duty. The Glis­mak hor­de will su­rely go now to the Wyvi­lo set­tle­ment of Let and at­tack it. They we­re on the­ir way when they en­co­un­te­red you. We must hurry the­re as fast as pos­sib­le to warn the fo­rest Folk, and do what we can to help them."</p>
   <p>    "Aye!" sa­id the Prin­ce in ad­mi­ra­ti­on. "We knights shall gu­ard you with our bla­des whi­le you call down thun­der­bolts to slay the de­vi­lish Glis­mak!"</p>
   <p>    Anigel drew back from him with a gasp of hor­ror. "No!"</p>
   <p>    "But how then shall we sa­ve the Wyvi­lo, Lady? We are six­te­en men -twenty if you co­unt the three unp­led­ged and the sor­ce­rer's lac­key - and so­me of us are wo­un­ded. The Glis­mak must num­ber in the hund­reds. Do you sup­po­se we can co­un­ter such a vast army of sa­va­ges wit­ho­ut yo­ur ma­gi­cal as­sis­tan­ce?"</p>
   <p>    "I did not know the ta­lis­man wo­uld kill," she whis­pe­red. And the­re was ter­ror in her eyes. "I did not know…"</p>
   <p>    Antar to­ok her hand. The te­ars we­re star­ting aga­in. He lif­ted her cal­lo­used, scratc­hed fin­gers to his lips. "Don't worry. Per­haps you can try the po­wers of the thing as we tra­vel, and find gent­ler me­ans of de­fen­se."</p>
   <p>    She drew away im­pa­ti­ently, aga­in thin­king only of the task ahe­ad. "We shall rest to­night, then press on to­mor­row even un­til night, so that we re­ach Let ahe­ad of the Glis­mak."</p>
   <p>    "Travel at night?" An­tar was nonp­lus­sed. "Lady, we ama­te­ur bo­at­men can­not pos­sibly na­vi­ga­te the Gre­at Mu­tar by the light of the Trip­le Mo­ons - and it may well storm aga­in."</p>
   <p>    A tiny smi­le cur­ved Ani­gel's lips. "We shall ha­ve the ser­vi­ces of ex­cel­lent gu­ides."</p>
   <p>    She went down to the stre­am bank, still smi­ling, and cal­led: <emphasis>Fri­ends</emphasis>!</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Thirty-Five</strong></p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Hamil ca­me stri­ding up to Ka­di­ya, two of his tro­opers flan­king them with torc­hes. His hand aga­in grip­ped her ha­ir, and pul­led her to her kne­es.</p>
   <p>    He was la­ug­hing and she he­ard ot­her vo­ices jo­in him. "Now you are sho­wing the pro­per spi­rit, Kra­in's da­ugh­ter: humbly - on yo­ur kne­es. What ga­me has be­en pla­yed he­re?"</p>
   <p>    His eyes dar­ted abo­ut-to the stra­ight-stan­ding sword and then to that odi­o­us blac­ke­ned pi­le. One char­red, ske­le­tal hand se­emed to po­int to the obj­ect of po­wer its ow­ner had co­ve­ted.</p>
   <p>    There was a long mo­ment of si­len­ce and then Ha­mil la­ug­hed aga­in, but less as­su­redly. Se­ve­ral sco­re ar­med men now had gat­he­red, but all ca­re­ful­ly avo­ided the thing lying on the gro­und.</p>
   <p>    "So, it lo­oks as if the Vo­ice told the truth and yet did not be­li­eve it him­self! Was that the way of it, slut?" The Ge­ne­ral sho­ok Ka­di­ya back and forth by that tor­men­ting hold on her ha­ir. "He stro­ve to ta­ke the ta­lis­man and it was bon­ded to you, and thus it slew him."</p>
   <p>    He lo­ose­ned his hold on her and ran a fin­ger back and forth along his lo­wer lip. Ka­di­ya had he­ard eno­ugh of the Ge­ne­ral to know that he, bru­te as he had pro­ved him­self to be, was al­so wily and ke­ener-wit­ted than he lo­oked.</p>
   <p>    Some of the men fell away from the ed­ge of the circ­le abo­ut them, gi­ving way to anot­her of­fi­cer, a hu­ge man. His rag­ged clo­ak had on­ce be­en as or­na­te as Ha­mil's but he went wit­ho­ut a hel­met and the­re was a dirty ban­da­ge abo­ut his he­ad, a brist­le of grey stub­ble on che­eks and chin.</p>
   <p>    "What now, my Ge­ne­ral?" The­re was a sharp­ness in his vo­ice which ar­gu­ed that they might be fel­lows in a fight but no shi­eld brot­hers.</p>
   <p>    Hamil had no chan­ce to ans­wer be­fo­re a vo­ice from so­mew­he­re among the ranks cri­ed:</p>
   <p>    "Lash the witch to the sword, and in­to the bog with her!"</p>
   <p>    There was an ans­we­ring hum of as­sent to that. Then anot­her tro­oper ga­ve dif­fe­rent ad­vi­ce:</p>
   <p>    "Turn the Skri­tek on her!"</p>
   <p>    To that the­re was even fir­mer ag­re­ement. The gat­he­ring of men had mo­ved fart­her away from Ka­di­ya, the ed­ges of the crowd mel­ting in­to the dark whe­re the torch and fi­re­light did not easily re­ach. It wo­uld se­em that the im­port of that blas­ted body was ma­king it­self stron­ger and mo­re wi­dely felt.</p>
   <p>    Hamil swept the as­semb­la­ge with a gla­re which ap­pa­rently his men knew only too well, for the mur­mur ce­ased as if a do­or had be­en sud­denly slam­med shut. Then he tur­ned to the big of­fi­cer.</p>
   <p>    "What now, Osor­kon? Why, we obey or­ders. Al­ways we obey or­ders! We ca­me to find this." Aga­in his grip on Ka­di­ya's ha­ir ca­ught her tight eno­ugh to ma­ke her sway back and forth. "Well, we ha­ve fo­und it. We ha­ve so­met­hing el­se, too -" He po­in­ted to the ta­lis­man. "If King Volt­rik re­wards well tho­se who bring one of the­se ro­yal wenc­hes to him, what kind of gift will he bes­tow upon tho­se who pro­du­ce a tre­asu­re our Grand Mi­nis­ter of Sta­te migh­tily wis­hes to own?"</p>
   <p>    "A <emphasis>tre­asu­re</emphasis>," Osor­kon ac­cen­ted the word strongly, "which has al­re­ady dis­po­sed of one who knows far mo­re than any of us abo­ut its dan­gers."</p>
   <p>    "Yes." Ha­mil's ton­gue tip ran ac­ross his fleshy lips. He drag­ged Ka­di­ya up from her kne­es so he had not so far to lo­ok down to me­et her eyes squ­arely. "I think you will be mo­re truth­ful with us now. The­re are ways we know well how to hand­le tho­se who are all co­ura­ge and ze­al, so that in the end they are only too glad to do our will even if that me­ans sla­ying one very ne­ar to the­ir he­art." He snap­ped his fin­gers and aga­in the crowd of men ope­ned as one of the Skri­tek slo­uc­hed for­ward in ans­wer.</p>
   <p>    "Pellan!" Ha­mil ma­de an or­der of that na­me. From the back rows of the tro­ops tot­te­red a ske­le­tal fi­gu­re. Ka­di­ya, who had se­en the merc­hant-gu­ide in the days of his well-fed and ho­no­red li­fe among his fel­lows, co­uld not re­cog­ni­ze him at first. It was a hu­man wreck who fell to his kne­es rat­her than ma­ke for­mal obe­isan­ce, and lo­oked up to the Ge­ne­ral with a fa­ce li­ke one be­lon­ging to the de­ad.</p>
   <p>    Hamil le­aned for­ward to ga­ze in­tently at the ta­lis­man. Now he nod­ded as if he had be­en ans­we­red with just what he wan­ted to he­ar. "It is still the­re…"In spi­te of the trans­for­ma­ti­on the sword had un­der­go­ne, the sna­kes­kin twist the Vo­ice had pro­du­ced for its hand­ling was still sa­fely lo­oped abo­ut it.</p>
   <p>    "Pellan, tell this stu­pid bru­te to ta­ke that sword up, and put it back on the girl's back, using only the cord."</p>
   <p>    The man gul­ped as if he fo­und it dif­fi­cult to spe­ak. Then he vo­iced a stre­am of gut­tu­rals. The Skri­tek lo­oked at him, at the sword, then at Ha­mil. Fan­ged jaws ope­ned and the cre­atu­re ma­de an ans­wer in his own grumb­ling spe­ech.</p>
   <p>    Pellan's fa­ce was whi­te be­ne­ath the gri­me of swamp tra­vel. Ka­di­ya saw that his hands we­re sha­king, and that he put them has­tily to­get­her in a tight grip.</p>
   <p>    "Well?" de­man­ded Ha­mil, af­ter a long mo­ment of si­len­ce.</p>
   <p>    "Lord Ge­ne­ral - he will not to­uch that." The gu­ide nod­ded to­ward the sword. "He says it is of the Va­nis­hed Ones and holds the­ir for­ce."</p>
   <p>    "So?" Ha­mil's exp­res­si­on did not chan­ge. He ca­ught the lo­op of sna­kes­kin, jer­king the bla­de free from the gro­und. Then he whe­eled slowly, as if to ma­ke very su­re that all men gat­he­red the­re we­re per­fectly awa­re of what he was do­ing.</p>
   <p>    "The Va­nis­hed Ones," he com­men­ted. "We ha­ve he­ard a gre­at de­al abo­ut the­se Va­nis­hed Ones sin­ce we star­ted plo­wing thro­ugh this bog. See you, all of you! Ne­ed one we­aring the emb­lem of gre­at La­bor­nok be fe­ar­ful of le­gends?"</p>
   <p>    Osorkon co­ug­hed. "And what of him?" He po­in­ted to the char­red re­ma­ins. "It wo­uld se­em that so­me le­gends hold le­gi­ti­ma­te war­nings."</p>
   <p>    Hamil did not even blink, but Ka­di­ya was very su­re at that mo­ment that the Ge­ne­ral held no li­king for his im­me­di­ate su­bor­di­na­te. Thro­ugh wit­nes­sing the slow ind­ra­wing of the sol­di­ers, she was al­so awa­re that the­ir Ge­ne­ral's ges­tu­re had ba­nis­hed so­me of the­ir fe­ar-inspi­red awe.</p>
   <p>    "That one," Ha­mil nod­ded to the cin­ders, "was one who pla­yed with such ma­gi­cal toys. Per­haps tho­se of his mas­ter are sa­fe eno­ugh, but this thing he­re is of a dif­fe­rent so­ur­ce. A man who hand­les cer­ta­in we­apons wit­ho­ut hurt grows ca­re­less. I think this Vo­ice to­ok too much on him­self."</p>
   <p>    The Ge­ne­ral was back at Ka­di­ya's si­de now. His he­avy paw on her sho­ul­der spun her aro­und so that she might ha­ve fal­len aga­in. But she was ab­le to ke­ep her fe­et as she felt the sword slip­ped slowly back among the ro­pes that bo­und her.</p>
   <p>    Hamil had al­re­ady tur­ned away. He bec­ko­ned to a tro­oper who sto­od im­me­di­ately by the ne­arest torch­man. Le­ve­ling his hand, he po­in­ted to the Skri­tek who had re­fu­sed his or­der.</p>
   <p>    "That one we do not ne­ed," he com­men­ted.</p>
   <p>    The Skri­tek ro­ared and cro­uc­hed. An axe with a wic­ked do­ub­le he­ad ap­pe­ared in one sca­led fist. The cre­atu­re's de­fi­ant cry was ans­we­red by se­ve­ral ot­hers of his kind.</p>
   <p>    The sol­di­er Ha­mil had sum­mo­ned to­ok a le­ap for­ward, his sword up and re­ady. It ap­pe­ared that this was not the first ti­me the La­bor­no­ki had fa­ced one of the­ir unp­le­asant al­li­es in com­bat.</p>
   <p>    As the axe left the claws of the Skri­tek, it mo­ved with such for­ce and spe­ed that it was but a blur in the un­cer­ta­in light. But the sol­di­er had al­re­ady la­unc­hed him­self for­ward, not to me­et the we­apon but in a figh­ting stan­ce. At the sa­me ti­me his sword flas­hed, and the­re was a spurt of dark blo­od. The Skri­tek threw up his he­ad with an ear-split­ting bel­low, his left leg half hewn from his body. The fo­re­arms with the­ir sharp ta­lons out. One paw, per­haps mo­re by luck than in­ten­ti­on, ca­ught in the ma­il on the sol­di­er's sho­ul­der and drag­ged him down. It did not ne­ed his sho­ut of pa­in and ter­ror to bring his com­ra­des' ste­el out, nor we­re the ot­her Skri­tek long in jo­ining the fight.</p>
   <p>    Labornoki sol­di­ers and Skri­tek fo­ught and di­ed as the bat­tle whir­led aro­und the bon­fi­re. One of the torch­men dro­ve off a mons­ter wit­hin claw's ran­ge of Ha­mil him­self by thrus­ting the fi­ery end of the torch he held in­to the cre­atu­re's half-open jaws. The me­lee was fi­er­ce whi­le it las­ted, but that was not long, for the mob of Skri­tek fa­ded away in­to the swamp night, le­aving three of the­ir own num­ber de­ad, two still li­ving. Fo­ur sol­di­ers lay un­mo­ving, and a num­ber of ot­hers nur­sed blo­ody gas­hes and the li­ke.</p>
   <p>    Osorkon had re­ac­hed out at the be­gin­ning of the emb­ro­il­ment, ca­ught Ka­di­ya, and drag­ged her back to­ward Ha­mil's tent, which half col­lap­sed as a guy ro­pe ga­ve way. He him­self ma­de no at­tempt to jo­in in the fight but sto­od watc­hing. When it was over he stu­di­ed Ha­mil with a bro­oding lo­ok. Ho­we­ver, he wa­ited to spe­ak un­til the Ge­ne­ral, wi­ping blo­od from his sword with a hand­ful of le­aves, ca­me clo­se eno­ugh so that per­haps only Ka­di­ya was al­so ab­le to he­ar.</p>
   <p>    "Our al­li­es must truly ha­ve se­cond tho­ughts on the mat­ter of ser­vi­ce," Osor­kon ob­ser­ved dryly. "You had that two-ton­gu­ed pack-vart" - he nod­ded at Pel­lan, who had cro­uc­hed in­to a ball as clo­se to wha­te­ver shel­ter the tent might of­fer-"play gu­ide to the last po­int on the ri­ver he knew three or fo­ur days back. Sin­ce then, we ha­ve be­en gu­ided by the mons­ters." Now he nod­ded to­ward the ge­ne­ral area whe­re the Uis­gu wo­men lay ro­ped clo­sely to­get­her. "All aro­und us the swamp bo­ils, nor ha­ve we had any word from our ad­van­ce sco­uting party for two days. I say, let us turn back now that we ha­ve ac­hi­eved our go­al and you ha­ve the girl and that which she car­ri­es."</p>
   <p>    Hamil scow­led. "The­re may be mo­re tre­asu­re to be fo­und."</p>
   <p>    "And what if the Od­dlings ri­se? We ha­ve ta­ken Uis­gu pri­so­ners and our hand­ling of them has be­en eno­ugh to turn all of the­ir blo­od aga­inst us. And now we ha­ve an­ta­go­ni­zed the Skri­tek. If we must de­pend for gu­ides on tho­se who ha­ve go­od re­ason to ha­te us, we are fo­ols."</p>
   <p>    "Oddlings - slimy de­vils! Ha­ve any sho­wed them­sel­ves wil­ling to ta­ke up arms? No! They are puny co­wards, spi­rit­less as barn­yard to­gars. The Uis­gu ri­se -? Im­pos­sib­le! They can't and won't fight. Is that not so, worm?" Ha­mil prod­ded Pel­lan with his bo­ot toe. "Did you not tell us from the be­gin­ning that the­se swamp-sul­kers are cra­vens?"</p>
   <p>    Pellan ra­ised his he­ad, and al­so his skinny arm as if trying to ward off a blow. "It was al­ways true be­fo­re, Lord Ge­ne­ral. The Skri­tek they will fight, but only if the fi­ends of the Mazy Mi­re at­tack them. Bet­we­en them­sel­ves the­re is no qu­ar­re­ling, nor ha­ve they ever ra­ised we­apon aga­inst any of us hu­mans who en­te­red the swamp. I ha­ve he­ard that an an­ci­ent oath was la­id upon them for­bid­ding war­fa­re, and they are pled­ged to it."</p>
   <p>    Hamil snor­ted. "This girl has ma­na­ged to find her way abo­ut the Thorny Hell, and the Uis­gu ha­ve hel­ped her or she wo­uld not ha­ve be­en ab­le to re­ach this po­int. With her and tho­se"- he ges­tu­red to the ot­her pri­so­ners - "with us, the Uis­gu will not im­pe­de us."</p>
   <p>    The next mor­ning they bro­ke camp and marc­hed up­ri­ver, fol­lo­wing a fa­int tra­il. Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil did not spe­ak aga­in to Ka­di­ya, alt­ho­ugh he kept her clo­se by as he lis­te­ned to re­ports bro­ught in by flan­kers and sco­uts. Thus she first le­ar­ned in truth that the La­bor­no­ki for­ce did not tra­vel alo­ne. So­met­hing -or so­me­one - skul­ked along with them, alt­ho­ugh the men we­re ne­ver ab­le to get a go­od lo­ok at it. We­re they be­ing fol­lo­wed by swamp-dwel­lers who had at last ari­sen to aven­ge the mur­der of the­ir pe­op­le? Da­red she ho­pe for so much?</p>
   <p>    Kadiya ro­used from her sta­te of fro­zen let­hargy to he­ar a badly bit­ten and mud-sta­ined sol­di­er say:</p>
   <p>    "Gam's. I'd swe­ar by Zo­to's Shi­eld to that! Just his he­ad ag­rin­nin' from a po­le plan­ted by a fern patch. No sign of them mons­ters eit­her. Just so­me blurry lit­tle fo­otp­rints sho­wing in the mud -an' this."</p>
   <p>    He held out what Ka­di­ya re­cog­ni­zed as a dart - lon­ger than any she had se­en the Nysso­mu use. Still, the shaft was pa­in­ted with two tiny bands, one blue and the ot­her yel­low, and tho­se she <emphasis>had</emphasis> se­en be­fo­re. Jagun! Or at le­ast his hunt sign.</p>
   <p>    "Gam," Ha­mil re­pe­ated. His mud-ca­ked fin­ger­na­ils gra­ted ac­ross the stub­ble of be­ard on his jaw. "I saw him ta­ke on the West­lin­ger pi­ra­tes - two of them with one blow. Well, I am su­re he did not die che­aply. Was he do­ne in by the Skri­tek?"</p>
   <p>    "That dart is not Skri­tek." Osor­kon had ta­ken the thing from the sco­ut. "They don't do work as fi­ne as this."</p>
   <p>    "What has our lady Prin­cess he­re to say?" Ha­mil in­qu­ired of Ka­di­ya. Her be­arers had res­ted her bo­und body on the tra­il. "Do you ha­ve so­me ot­her fri­end wa­iting to ta­ke a hand in our af­fa­irs?" He po­ised his hand to slap her.</p>
   <p>    She co­uld ans­wer him with part truth. "I… ha­ve not se­en the li­ke… of that be­fo­re."</p>
   <p>    Osorkon did not gi­ve the Ge­ne­ral any ti­me to for­ce anot­her ans­wer out of her.</p>
   <p>    "She may ser­ve as ba­it, if they do ha­ve ot­her we­apons to use. Don't was­te ti­me ma­uling her he­re. Let us get on to so­me so­lid land if a fight thre­atens. We can't put up any show of for­ce flo­un­de­ring aro­und in this de­mon-cur­sed mud."</p>
   <p>    Suddenly, a re­so­un­ding ro­ar ca­me from ahe­ad. Ha­mil's sword was in his hand ins­tantly and the sol­di­ers be­hind bunc­hed abo­ut the­ir com­man­der.</p>
   <p>    "Skritek!" the sco­ut yel­led. "And from the so­und of 'em, they've got so­me po­or de­vil on the run!"</p>
   <p>    "Move along!" Ha­mil or­de­red. "Clo­se up! The­re's hig­her gro­und ahe­ad and we ne­ed firm fo­oting."</p>
   <p>    Once mo­re the cry of the Skri­tek so­un­ded. Ka­di­ya's ears buz­zed and she was ne­ar un­cons­ci­o­us from the jo­un­cing as her be­arers ran along. Her arms had lost all fe­eling from the bin­dings. Even if she we­re free and had ta­lis­man in hand, she was not su­re she wo­uld be ab­le to use it. Ho­we­ver, be­hind the pa­in, the help­les­sness - and yes, the fe­ar, she still held grimly to the old co­re of an­ger. The­re must be so­me way she co­uld stri­ke back! If only the ma­gic pa­raly­sis wo­uld we­ar off…</p>
   <p>    They ra­ced ahe­ad, de­pen­ding on flan­kers for war­ning. The land now be­ca­me dry and fa­irly open ex­cept for so­me low-gro­wing ve­ge­ta­ti­on, but at the sa­me ti­me it had the di­re lo­ok of that stretch of co­untry Ka­di­ya had cros­sed with Jagun ear­li­er. He­re and the­re grew net­works of fat gre­yish gro­und-vi­nes, with le­aves which lo­oked hardly mo­re than shri­ve­led buds and which we­re sur­ro­un­ded by clo­uds of in­sects. Crus­hed un­der­fo­ot, the vi­nes ga­ve off a put­rid smell.</p>
   <p>    And then they ca­me upon a bu­il­ding.</p>
   <p>    It was not of sto­ne - but rat­her of that sa­me sle­ek ma­te­ri­al which had for­med the bowl-li­ke cam­ping pla­ce she had sha­red with Jagun and the pla­ce whe­re she had ac­qu­ired her ta­lis­man. One wall was pi­er­ced by a do­or­way, and re­ces­sed on eit­her si­de was a tall sta­tue in the form of tho­se sa­me sent­ri­es which gu­ar­ded the For­bid­den Way. Each sin­do­na held a sword. Ka­di­ya blin­ked smar­ting eyes. The swords - they we­re po­int­less li­ke the one she now bo­re on her back. The we­apons we­re outst­retc­hed and cros­sed to for­bid ent­ran­ce.</p>
   <p>    Hamil hal­ted to eye what lay be­fo­re them. The­re was an eager no­te in his vo­ice. "By Zo­to-the very thing I ho­ped to find! A strong­hold of the Va­nis­hed Ones, and pro­bably full of tre­asu­re! Cap­ta­in Los­kar, you go and gi­ve a tick­le to tho­se." He nod­ded to the sta­tu­es. "The rest of you men get re­ady with yo­ur ar­rows!"</p>
   <p>    It pro­ved the me­asu­re of Ha­mil's po­wer over his tro­ops, in spi­te of all the re­cent di­sas­ters, that he was promptly obe­yed. A yo­ung of­fi­cer ra­ised his own sword so that it to­uc­hed that po­int whe­re the po­int­less bla­des of the sen­ti­nels cros­sed. The me­tal re­bo­un­ded with a harsh clang. Los­kar's we­apon flew out of his hand and he ga­ve an ago­ni­zed howl and ca­ught at his sword arm, fal­ling to his kne­es.</p>
   <p>    "Arrows -insi­de!" Ha­mil snap­ped.</p>
   <p>    The whist­ling of the La­bor­no­ki war-bolts, me­ant to af­right as well as kill, was lo­ud. In­to the ope­ning be­hind the two sen­ti­nels they sped. It was dark in the­re, with no hint of what lay be­yond. Ne­it­her was the­re any ans­wer to the at­tack Ha­mil had or­de­red. He cal­led to the men who car­ri­ed Ka­di­ya: "Wu­nit! Vor! Push her be­ne­ath the sta­tu­es' swords!"</p>
   <p>    The sol­di­ers slung her, car­rying po­les and all, thro­ugh the do­or­way. When the sen­ti­nels re­ma­ined mo­ti­on­less, Wu­nit and a do­zen men duc­ked down and fol­lo­wed af­ter.</p>
   <p>    "It's sa­fe, my Ge­ne­ral!" Wu­nit cal­led. "We ne­ed torc­hes!"</p>
   <p>    Brands we­re qu­ickly kind­led and pas­sed thro­ugh. The in­te­ri­or of the bu­il­ding was fe­atu­re­less ex­cept for a sing­le in­ner do­or at the end of a nar­row hal­lway. Abo­ve it was car­ved a gre­at tril­li­um.</p>
   <p>    "Wait - I'm co­ming myself," Ha­mil sa­id. Grab­bing a torch, he sto­oped and en­te­red.</p>
   <p>    Immediately, all the torc­hes of the La­bor­no­ki went out. The­re we­re mas­cu­li­ne scre­ams, so­unds of flo­un­de­ring bo­di­es, and then ut­ter si­len­ce.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya lay fa­ce down, unab­le to help her­self. No day­light pe­net­ra­ted this pla­ce. The dark of the open outer do­or might ha­ve be­en a cur­ta­in, alt­ho­ugh she had felt no­ne such as she fell thro­ugh. She drew a gas­ping bre­ath. Oddly eno­ugh that pa­raly­sis which had grip­ped her so strongly now se­emed to be re­ce­ding. She thras­hed abo­ut li­ke a lan­ded fish, trying to ri­se. The black­ness aro­und her was thick and comp­le­te, but she was awa­re of a les­se­ning of that fe­ar which had wal­ked with her sin­ce she had be­en ta­ken cap­ti­ve.</p>
   <p>    The girl wrig­gled vi­olently. Sud­denly her arms we­re free at her si­des, and the ta­lis­man lay lo­ose un­der her body. She to­re the re­ma­ining ro­pe from her legs. The sur­fa­ce un­der her felt cle­ar of any dust or drift from the outer world. Ins­te­ad it was slip­pery and now slan­ted down­ward at an ever-incre­asing ang­le. She be­gan to sli­de, as she used her num­bed arms to le­ver her­self up­right. Fas­ter and fas­ter she fell, and then she cras­hed, still hol­ding the ta­lis­man, in­to an un­se­en bar­ri­er, only to con­ti­nue her sli­de in a new di­rec­ti­on and crash aga­in. Half-cons­ci­o­us, she clung to the ma­gi­cal sword… un­til she struck one last bar­ri­er, flew thro­ugh the air, and lan­ded sen­se­less on a le­vel sur­fa­ce.</p>
   <p>    The toe of a bo­ot ca­ught her in the si­de and wo­ke her.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya blin­ked and blin­ked aga­in. Dark­ness no lon­ger loc­ked her in. She was in a lar­ge ro­om, lit dimly by no dis­cer­nib­le so­ur­ce of il­lu­mi­na­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "She's a to­ugh one, Ge­ne­ral."</p>
   <p>    Three men sto­od in a clo­se tri­ang­le abo­ut her. One was Ha­mil, the ot­her two Wu­nit and Vor. The ot­her tro­ops sto­od sul­lenly be­hind them. Ka­di­ya saw that the La­bor­no­ki we­re bru­ised and trying not to show fe­ar.</p>
   <p>    She lif­ted her he­ad. Tho­ugh her arms we­re strong aga­in, her hand was not qu­ite ab­le to re­ach the hilt of the ta­lis­man which lay partly be­ne­ath her.</p>
   <p>    "Do you think she knows the way out of he­re, sir?" Vor as­ked.</p>
   <p>    "That may well be," Ha­mil rep­li­ed. At any ra­te we can use her to test for mo­re dam­ned man-traps as we lo­ok the pla­ce over. Get her mo­ving."</p>
   <p>    No one to­uc­hed her. She to­ok hold of the ta­lis­man and clim­bed slowly to her fe­et, her he­ad ac­hing from the bat­te­ring it had re­ce­ived. Dully, she won­de­red why they had not tri­ed to ta­ke the sword from her, and then she re­mem­be­red that they had go­od re­ason to fe­ar to­uc­hing that eerie we­apon.</p>
   <p>    The grey light sho­ne upon a kind of in­do­or co­urt­yard. Be­fo­re them was a fo­un­ta­in flo­wing with wa­ter. On the ot­her si­de of the fo­un­ta­in was a sta­ir­ca­se le­ading up. She wal­ked over to it, but dark­ness hung abo­ve and Ka­di­ya co­uld not see whe­re the sta­irs led.</p>
   <p>    On each step was a fo­otp­rint glo­wing red.</p>
   <p>    Hamil sho­wed no he­si­ta­ti­on. "Onward!" he com­man­ded. He set fo­ot squ­arely on the first print, then be­gan to tremb­le vi­olently li­ke one aff­lic­ted with marsh fe­ver. Whi­te-fa­ced, he stag­ge­red back, drew his sword, and bran­dis­hed it at Ka­di­ya.</p>
   <p>    "Magic!" he cro­aked. "Let <emphasis>her</emphasis> le­ad the way." He pul­led Ka­di­ya be­fo­re him so it was her fo­ot that to­uc­hed the print on the next sta­ir.</p>
   <p>    By the tril­li­um, she was go­ing to scre­am! The­re shot thro­ugh her a sen­sa­ti­on li­ke a blast of fla­me. Then the ta­lis­man she held ec­ho­ed the fe­eling of bur­ning he­at, but she co­uld not throw it from her. She he­ard an as­to­un­ded cry from Ha­mil. She had re­ac­hed the fifth step, be­yond his re­ach, and the glo­wing fo­otp­rint awa­iting her the­re ab­ruptly va­nis­hed. What she pla­ced fo­ot upon was a circ­le of sil­ver cen­te­red by a Black Tril­li­um. Ha­mil did not ex­pect the sud­den mo­ve that fol­lo­wed. She was free, comp­le­tely re­co­ve­red from her inj­uri­es and the enc­hant­ment, and each step be­fo­re her was mar­ked with the sa­me en­he­ar­te­ning symbol. As her fo­ot fell qu­ickly upon each in turn new strength bu­ilt wit­hin her.</p>
   <p>    Anger bo­iled up. Let her but turn and she co­uld kill them all! No, that was the res­pon­se of a fo­ol. Ar­med men watc­hed her, so­me ar­med with bows and ar­rows. She had only this ta­lis­man of which she was still un­su­re.</p>
   <p>    A mo­ment la­ter she had re­ac­hed a long ro­om at the he­ad of the sta­irs. Each wall he­re was cros­sed and rec­ros­sed by a net­ting of red light. The cham­ber was cen­te­red by a sing­le block of the stran­ge pa­le bu­il­ding ma­te­ri­al, and the­re only did anot­her co­lor show. For, ri­sing as if from a bed of well ten­ded earth, sto­od a car­ven ima­ge of a tall plant ma­de of sil­very me­tal. A tril­li­um plant. The stalk en­ded in a sing­le lar­ge tightly clo­sed bud.</p>
   <p>    Hamil had fol­lo­wed wa­rily, his men be­hind him. Now he stam­ped for­ward to lo­ok up at the plant, one hand on sword hilt. He might be in the he­art of enemy ter­ri­tory with his army whit­tled away, yet the­re was not­hing in his stan­ce to sug­gest that he did not fully be­li­eve in him­self and his own po­wer. He gla­red at Ka­di­ya, who sto­od fa­cing him re­so­lu­tely with the ta­lis­man grip­ped in one hand. "We will go no fart­her," she sa­id calmly.</p>
   <p>    The Ge­ne­ral glan­ced back over his sho­ul­der. He did not spe­ak, but Wu­nit and Vor mo­ved in qu­ickly on eit­her si­de of him, swords drawn.</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ve he­ard," Ha­mil's vo­ice was low and char­ged with hat­red, "that blo­od is po­wer. This is cer­ta­inly a pla­ce of po­wer." He ga­ve an or­der: "Dri­ve her over to that al­tar!"</p>
   <p>    They har­ri­ed her with the­ir bla­des, for­cing her back aga­inst the sto­ne from which the Flo­wer sprang.</p>
   <p>    "I," Ha­mil's vo­ice rang lo­ud now, "am a man of blo­od. I ha­ve le­ar­ned to pay with blo­od for what I want. When you die, Prin­cess, you will no lon­ger be bon­ded to that ma­gi­cal ta­lis­man. Oro­gas­tus no lon­ger has po­wer he­re. I do! And I in­tend to hew off that hand of yo­urs that holds the ta­lis­man, and when yo­ur li­fe's blo­od is dra­ined, ta­ke it for my own."</p>
   <p>    His sword swung up. Over her lo­omed the gi­ant Flo­wer. To Ka­di­ya's sight it se­emed to qu­iver and burst in­to blo­om. Was it a flo­wer or so­met­hing el­se - such as the sen­ti­nel? She co­uld not be su­re, for aro­und it a daz­zling gre­en glow ra­di­ated.</p>
   <p>    The trun­ca­ted sword length of her ta­lis­man bla­zed a vi­vid gre­en al­so, sha­ring the po­tency of the Flo­wer.</p>
   <p>    From the pul­sing of the light abo­ut her she was su­re so­me chan­ge had co­me in on the al­tar. For Wu­nit and Vor and the sol­di­ers fled back down the sta­irs, the­ir fa­ces fe­ar-stric­ken and ghastly.</p>
   <p>    Hamil was dusky with ra­ge. He char­ged at her. By no know­led­ge she had ever pos­ses­sed be­fo­re, her ta­lis­man ans­we­red, bloc­king the Ge­ne­ral's own bla­de. It se­emed to her that ti­me mo­ved oddly -first as fast as a whirl­wind, and then as if le­aden we­ights hob­bled both of them. Each ti­me he thrust, she par­ri­ed. He was thri­ce her bulk, but he co­uld not be­at her down, nor thrust past the in­vin­cib­le gu­ard of her ta­lis­man.</p>
   <p>    He how­led, thro­wing back his he­ad and gi­ving vo­ice li­ke an ani­mal. Then, to her comp­le­te as­to­nish­ment, he tur­ned to run he­avily down the sta­irs.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya ste­adi­ed her­self at the al­tar. Abo­ve her, a hu­ge Black Tril­li­um blo­omed on a sil­ver stalk. She da­red now to lo­ok up. She ra­ised the ta­lis­man and the three eyes on the pom­mel ope­ned, fa­cing three gre­ater ones at the cen­ter of the al­tar flo­wer.</p>
   <p>    Now it was as if a win­dow in the stran­ge ro­om had be­en flung open to the full day's sun. The eyes bla­zed. They se­emed to re­ach de­ep in­to her so­ul.</p>
   <p>    She her­self was no lon­ger of any im­por­tan­ce. The­re was no mo­re Ka­di­ya of Ru­wen­da… only the Lady of the Eyes.</p>
   <p>    And then all the glory va­nis­hed. What had be­en a pil­lar of light on the al­tar fla­red and was go­ne. The­re was no Black Tril­li­um. The ro­om was empty ex­cept for her, and her now-dul­led ta­lis­man.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya tur­ned to walk to the sta­ir­way. The wall co­lors we­re fa­ding, all was a dusty grey. She went down the steps and fo­und an open do­or, and he­ard the sho­uts of men and of ot­hers, and the rin­ging of we­aponry out­si­de. As one to­tal­ly re­ne­wed in spi­rit and body she le­apt for­ward in­to what was a full bat­tle.</p>
   <p>    Labornoki we­re fal­ling with po­iso­ned darts stuck in­to any ex­po­sed part, of the­ir bo­di­es. Now from the brush erup­ted hund­reds of Uis­gu, nimbly dod­ging ar­rows with cu­ri­o­us half-hop­ping, half-dan­cing steps. The­re we­re Skri­tek, too, la­ying abo­ut at the Od­dlings. Ha­mil, his tat­te­red clo­ak of of­fi­ce shorn from his sho­ul­ders, was en­ga­ged with three di­mi­nu­ti­ve Uis­gu, wi­el­ding spe­ars. The Ge­ne­ral aimed a swe­eping sword-cut to cut down Od­dlings, but Ka­di­ya sprang for­ward, ba­rely cle­aring anot­her body, to fa­ce him.</p>
   <p>    Always af­ter­ward she wo­uld swe­ar that so­me spi­rit had pos­ses­sed her. She ne­arly drop­ped the ta­lis­man, but with both hands she gras­ped the dull, trun­ca­ted bla­de and swung the hilt up just as Ha­mil was abo­ut to stri­ke her down.</p>
   <p>    "<emphasis>To</emphasis> what you ha­ve ma­de yo­ur­self," she fo­und bre­ath to sho­ut, "re­turn, man of blo­od!"</p>
   <p>    Hamil twis­ted. He drop­ped his sword to ra­ise both hands to his thro­at. His eyes we­re af­la­me, fla­me lap­ped from bet­we­en his lips, ran down his body. From him ca­me such a cry of tor­ment as ma­de Ka­di­ya shud­der. The Three-Lo­bed Bur­ning Eye lo­oked upon him with all its po­wer, and he fell he­avily to the gro­und. Li­ke the Vo­ice be­fo­re him, what re­ma­ined of Ha­mil was only as­hes.</p>
   <p>    From the ta­lis­man pom­mel the­re now lic­ked anot­her gre­at ton­gue of fla­me, which split in­to stre­ams and me­na­ced the Skri­tek. They bro­ke away to fol­low the fle­e­ing La­bor­no­ki sol­di­ers. The fla­me va­nis­hed.</p>
   <p>    "Lady of the Eyes…"</p>
   <p>    Kadiya lo­oked to­ward the mass of jubi­lant Od­dling war­ri­ors. "Jagun!" That na­me se­emed to co­me from so­me ot­her far off me­mory, part of anot­her ti­me. "You're sa­fe!"</p>
   <p>    But anot­her vo­ice al­so spo­ke now, one that si­len­ced even the mo­ans of the wo­un­ded.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>"Daughter!"</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Kadiya tur­ned back to the sin­do­na at the do­or. Abo­ve the­ir nob­le he­ads was a circ­ling of sil­ver, and wit­hin it a fa­mi­li­ar fa­ce, smi­ling.</p>
   <p>    "White Lady! Ha­ve - ha­ve I do­ne what I sho­uld?"</p>
   <p>    "Not yet."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya drew a bre­ath which was clo­se to a sob. "What, then? Must I carry this" - she held out the ta­lis­man - "to the fi­nish? "</p>
   <p>    "That is so," the calm vo­ice rep­li­ed.</p>
   <p>    "I am what I ha­ve be­en fas­hi­oned for…" In part that was a plea.</p>
   <p>    "That, too, is so."</p>
   <p>    She still had so much to le­arn!</p>
   <p>    "What li­es ahe­ad?"</p>
   <p>    There ca­me no ans­wer. The vi­si­on fa­ded, and Ka­di­ya sto­od with te­ars run­ning down her scratc­hed and wo­un­ded fa­ce. She had be­en al­lo­wed a glimp­se of so­met­hing be­yond her un­ders­tan­ding, that she must even now hun­ger for; but now all she co­uld do was carry on. She tur­ned then to fa­ce the bat­tle­fi­eld. The Uis­gu sto­od the­re with Jagun smi­ling among them. They ra­ised the­ir small hands in sa­lu­te. They had for­sa­ken the old ways; they had gat­he­red clan and tri­be to a sing­le pur­po­se. It must be her will and ca­use to uni­te them.</p>

   <p>    After he had be­en int­ro­du­ced to the ri­mo­riks and ac­qu­a­in­ted with the­ir abi­li­ti­es, Prin­ce An­tar de­ci­ded that the party wo­uld tra­vel fas­test by ta­king only two wo­oden punts, Ani­gel's trans­lu­cent Wyvi­lo ca­noe, and a mi­ni­mum of sup­pli­es. Be­fo­re an­yo­ne was al­lo­wed to sle­ep, a new set of har­nes­ses and tra­ces for the ri­mo­riks was bra­ided from cut-up le­at­her mi­li­tary clo­aks, and ho­les we­re bo­red in the ves­sels to link them to­get­her. Af­ter only fi­ve ho­urs' sle­ep the party was off.</p>
   <p>    Since the ri­mo­riks knew exactly whe­re they we­re go­ing, the­re was no ne­ed for re­ins. They pul­led the three bo­ats hitc­hed in li­ne whi­le still in the nar­row stre­am, and re­ac­hed the Gre­at Mu­tar in only three ho­urs. On­ce in the big ri­ver, the ani­mals we­re ab­le to pull mo­re strongly ab­re­ast whi­le the knights al­so ro­wed. Prin­cess Ani­gel's light­we­ight ca­noe tra­iled the wo­oden punts in which the men ha­uled away; and with her ro­de Prin­ce An­tar, the badly wo­un­ded Sir Pe­na­pat, and the Blue Vo­ice, who had pro­ved to be a ho­pe­les­sly inef­fi­ci­ent pad­dler - per­haps bung­ling his stro­kes on pur­po­se. Ha­ving the sor­ce­rer's acoly­te in the­ir bo­at at le­ast ga­ve Ani­gel and An­tar the op­por­tu­nity to ke­ep an eye on him. He be­ha­ved in an exemp­lary fas­hi­on, spon­ging Sir Pe­na­pat's fe­ve­rish brow in the bo­at's stern whi­le the Prin­ce and Prin­cess con­ver­sed in low to­nes for ho­ur af­ter ho­ur in the bows.</p>
   <p>    The ri­mo­riks ha­uled the hu­mans along so swiftly that they fo­und them­sel­ves ap­pro­ac­hing the vil­la­ge of Let just as night fell on that sa­me day, only ba­rely ahe­ad of a se­cond gre­at ra­ins­torm.</p>
   <p>    But not ahe­ad of the Glis­mak.</p>
   <p>    "Lords of the Air - no!" cri­ed Ani­gel, as she ca­ught sight of to­we­ring clo­uds of smo­ke ri­sing aga­inst a som­ber sun­set. The bo­ats we­re still mo­ving along at such a ra­te that she da­red not stand.</p>
   <p>    "Use yo­ur far­sight to scan the sce­ne, Vo­ice!" the Prin­ce com­man­ded. "Tell us what has hap­pe­ned."</p>
   <p>    Anigel had go­ne very pa­le and when she spo­ke it was ne­arly in a whis­per. "Wa­it -let <emphasis>me</emphasis> try."</p>
   <p>    The Blue Vo­ice gaw­ked at her in as­to­nish­ment as she clo­sed her eyes and sat still as a sto­ne. But her lo­vely fa­ce ac­qu­ired not­hing of the re­pel­lent empty-eyed lo­ok that ac­com­pa­ni­ed the tran­ce of Oro­gas­tus's symbi­onts. Af­ter a few mi­nu­tes, she sa­id:</p>
   <p>    "The Glis­mak at­tac­ked the vil­la­ge from the land­ward si­de abo­ut an ho­ur ago. I can­not tell if it is the sa­me hor­de that fell upon yo­ur men. The­re se­em to be at le­ast three ti­mes as many Od­dlings as we saw up the Ko­vu­ko… They ha­ve set many bu­il­dings on fi­re… I see Spe­aker Sas­stu-Cha and I will try to bes­pe­ak him…"</p>
   <p>    The Prin­ce and the Blue Vo­ice wa­ited. Sir Pe­na­pat sa­id eagerly: "If it is to be a bat­tle, you may co­unt on me to do my part! Even one-eyed, one-leg­ged, and one-armed I can out­fight any of the rest of the lads! You know me, my Prin­ce."</p>
   <p>    "Indeed I do, Pe­ni." His co­un­te­nan­ce was sor­row­ful. "But I fe­ar the­re is lit­tle any of us will be ab­le to do if the sa­va­ges ha­ve al­re­ady over­run Let."</p>
   <p>    Princess Ani­gel's eyes ope­ned. "The Spe­aker thanks us for our kindly in­ten­ti­ons," she sa­id dully, "but the figh­ting is now hand-to-hand, and ne­arly a third of the ho­mes are on fi­re. He is abo­ut to ca­pi­tu­la­te, as is the­ir usu­al cus­tom when overw­hel­med, and pay a lar­ge in­dem­nity of go­ods to the in­va­ders, who will then withd­raw for so­me we­eks."</p>
   <p>    "But, Prin­cess," the Blue Vo­ice pro­tes­ted with a fi­ne air of rep­ro­ach. "You ha­ve it in yo­ur po­wer to sa­ve them. If only you wo­uld."</p>
   <p>    "Silence, you mis­be­got­ten ras­cal!" his­sed the Prin­ce. "How da­re you ad­dress the Lady in that pre­sump­tu­o­us way?"</p>
   <p>    Anigel sta­red at the Blue Vo­ice, eyes wi­de, and her lip ca­ught bet­we­en her small whi­te te­eth, re­gar­ding him as tho­ugh he we­re a ve­no­mo­us swamp-worm that had just slit­he­red in­to the bo­at. But an ins­tant la­ter she sa­id:</p>
   <p>    "He is right. I co­uld sa­ve the po­or Wyvi­lo, if I but had the co­ura­ge to call down kil­ling for­ce thro­ugh my ta­lis­man. If I co­uld co­nj­ure up cold-blo­odedly the sa­me ha­te and re­vul­si­on and de­si­re for ob­li­te­ra­ti­on that I inad­ver­tently fo­cu­sed upon the Glis­mak le­ader at the sce­ne of the mas­sac­re."</p>
   <p>    "Then do it," the Blue Vo­ice ur­ged, "and sa­ve yo­ur fri­ends!"</p>
   <p>    "I -I da­re not." She be­gan to we­ep.</p>
   <p>    The Blue Vo­ice shrug­ged and smi­led. "They are only Od­dlings."</p>
   <p>    "They are ra­ti­onal cre­atu­res who do not know any bet­ter!" she cri­ed. "The Glis­mak are li­ke wic­ked child­ren and must be pu­nis­hed and ta­ught to do bet­ter -but how can the de­ad le­arn les­sons?"</p>
   <p>    "While you ca­vil and shed fo­olish te­ars, yo­ur fri­ends die."</p>
   <p>    "I can't help it!"</p>
   <p>    "Oh, but you can."</p>
   <p>    She scre­amed at the top of her lungs: "I can't! I don't know how and my he­art is so­re pa­ined, and I'm so hor­ribly af­ra­id and I just can't - "</p>
   <p>    She bit off her words as tho­ugh she had spo­ken the most ap­pal­ling blasp­hemy, and lo­oked so frigh­te­ned and des­pa­iring that An­tar was ne­ar to smi­ting the whe­ed­ling Blue Vo­ice with his lar­ge fist. But be­fo­re the Prin­ce co­uld act her fa­ce chan­ged yet aga­in, li­ke a flip­ped pa­ge in a pic­tu­re bo­ok, and she cal­med and sa­id:</p>
   <p>    "Prince An­tar, if I go, will you go with me?"</p>
   <p>    "To Let? <emphasis>Now</emphasis>?" But se­e­ing that she was de­adly se­ri­o­us he drew him­self to­get­her and sa­id: "Swe­et Lady, I will ac­com­pany you to the trap­do­ors of hell if you but ask it."</p>
   <p>    Anigel nod­ded. In a stran­ge, soft vo­ice she sa­id: "My fri­ends, stop."</p>
   <p>    The tra­in of three bo­ats slo­wed, ca­me to a halt, and be­gan to wal­low in the choppy wa­ter, for the­re was a ga­le of wind fol­lo­wing them and the sky be­hind was pi­led with black and purp­le thun­der­he­ads. They co­uld he­ar fa­int rumb­lings now. Half a le­ague ahe­ad and on the­ir right Let sent up a fo­rest of so­oty co­lumns that spre­ad out when they re­ac­hed a cer­ta­in he­ight to form a black ro­of abo­ve the vil­la­ge.</p>
   <p>    "Sir Owa­non!" Ani­gel cal­led out to the Prin­ce's mars­hal, who ro­de in the le­ading punt. "Cut the tra­ces con­nec­ting yo­ur bo­at to the ri­mo­riks!"</p>
   <p>    As he has­te­ned to obey, she her­self se­ve­red the li­ne jo­ining her bo­at to the punt ahe­ad. <emphasis>My fri­ends, swim back to my bo­at so that I may re­hitch you</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>We are co­ming.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Prince An­tar and the ot­hers still had not gras­ped what she was abo­ut to do, but as she con­ti­nu­ed to gi­ve com­mands her in­tent be­ca­me cle­ar. "You men! Pad­dle back to us and ta­ke Sir Pe­na­pat and the Blue Vo­ice abo­ard. You in the stern of Sir Owa­non's bo­at -cut yo­ur­self free of the se­cond punt. Bring me both con­nec­ting li­nes."</p>
   <p>    They le­apt to fol­low her or­ders, whi­le she her­self to­ok the se­ve­red tra­ces from the mo­uths of her ri­mo­riks, and with her small kni­fe po­ked ho­les in the to­ugh up­per hull on eit­her si­de of the ca­noe's stem, pas­sed the le­at­hers thro­ugh, and ti­ed a lar­ge knot in them. The ot­her two li­nes she fas­te­ned to each ani­mal, imp­ro­vi­sing re­ins.</p>
   <p>    The ri­mo­riks sa­id: <emphasis>Sha­re mi­ton, and we are re­ady</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    From her belt-wal­let she to­ok the scar­let go­urd, and swal­lo­wed de­eply. The ani­mals lic­ked her fin­gers as the Prin­ce lo­oked on in ama­ze­ment.</p>
   <p>    Sir Pe­na­pat had be­en trans­fer­red to the ot­her bo­at, but the Blue Vo­ice still re­ma­ined firmly ens­con­ced in his pla­ce in the stern of Ani­gel's Wyvi­lo ca­noe. Now he fen­ded off the two wo­oden punts with the knights in them, so that the three craft drif­ted qu­ickly apart in the wind.</p>
   <p>    "I will re­ma­in with you al­so, Prin­cess!" the Vo­ice sho­uted. "I can be of help!"</p>
   <p>    Prince An­tar cri­ed, "Get out of the bo­at, you ill-ome­ned kna­ve!" He tur­ned abo­ut and be­gan to lurch stern­ward to­ward the acoly­te, mo­ving so vi­olently that the light­we­ight craft roc­ked ne­arly to the gun­wa­les.</p>
   <p>    But it was al­re­ady too la­te. Prin­cess Ani­gel sig­na­led the ri­mo­riks and they sur­ged for­ward. "You men ma­ke for the op­po­si­te sho­re!" she cal­led to Sir Owa­non. "You must not be on the ri­ver when the storm stri­kes. If we do not co­me to­mor­row, then sa­ve yo­ur­sel­ves as you can. Fa­re­well!"</p>
   <p>    The pa­le ca­noe roc­ke­ted for­ward with Ani­gel dri­ving, and so­on the two punts we­re lost to sight.</p>
   <p>    Antar had be­en thrown in­to the bot­tom of the bo­at by the­ir ab­rupt start. For a whi­le he simply clung to a thwart, fe­ar­ful that they wo­uld flip over at any mo­ment, and he in his ar­mor wo­uld sink li­ke a sto­ne. But they only zip­ped and splas­hed thro­ugh the chop li­ke a low-la­unc­hed ar­row, tra­ve­ling fas­ter than he wo­uld ha­ve tho­ught pos­sib­le.</p>
   <p>    The Blue Vo­ice was with them to stay, cro­uc­hed in as small an area as pos­sib­le, with his ho­od pul­led down over his fa­ce. An­tar co­uld hardly cast him over­bo­ard. Mut­te­ring to him­self, the Prin­ce set­tled down so­mew­hat mo­re com­for­tably, but he was in a black mo­od. The Prin­cess pa­id no at­ten­ti­on what­so­ever to eit­her man.</p>
   <p>    Now it ca­me to pass that Prin­ce An­tar be­ca­me chag­ri­ned at the way that the lo­vely Ani­gel had or­de­red him and ever­yo­ne el­se abo­ut - not that he fal­te­red for an ins­tant in his de­vo­ti­on to the Prin­cess; he was as de­ter­mi­ned as ever to die for her sa­ke. But she who had se­emed so pat­he­tic in the Ci­ta­del dun­ge­on, so be­a­uti­ful and do­omed go­ing over the ca­ta­ract, so li­ke a god­dess as she smo­te the Glis­mak, so yo­ung and vul­ne­rab­le as she bat­tled her in­ner de­vils a few mi­nu­tes ear­li­er, was now the very ima­ge of an aven­ging war­ri­or-qu­e­en as she ur­ged the ri­mo­riks on­ward. And so­met­hing de­ep wit­hin An­tar lo­oked as­kan­ce at this chan­ge and even fe­ared it.</p>
   <p>    Her eyes we­re tightly shut, and the Prin­ce do­ub­ted not that she stu­di­ed vi­si­ons of the car­na­ge go­ing on in Let, and bes­po­ke the Wyvi­lo that she was spe­eding to help them.</p>
   <p>    And yet how lo­vely she was! How gra­ce­ful, even in her man­nish garb, with her ha­ir flying and the ma­gi­cal co­ro­net firm set on her brow. She sto­od aga­inst the dar­ke­ning sky, whe­re the fi­res bur­ning in the vil­la­ge now pa­in­ted the clo­ud-bel­li­es with flic­ke­ring crim­son, and Prin­ce An­tar's blo­od qu­ic­ke­ned wit­hin him and he de­si­red not­hing mo­re than to die for lo­ve of her.</p>
   <p>    What was to be­co­me of Prin­cess Ani­gel - and of him? He had re­bel­led aga­inst his fat­her, de­no­un­ced La­bor­nok, and cast his lot with his be­lo­ved, who was vo­wed to li­be­ra­te her co­untry. But was such a thing pos­sib­le, even with the aid of the ma­gi­cal ta­lis­man? Oro­gas­tus co­uld com­mand the light­ning, too, and the Blue Vo­ice had as­su­red the Prin­ce that the sor­ce­rer now had in his pos­ses­si­on the ta­lis­man of one ro­yal sis­ter, and wo­uld so­on ha­ve the ot­her as well.</p>
   <p>    Anigel wo­uld want to re­turn to the Ci­ta­del. But su­rely such a co­ur­se wo­uld be fu­ti­le. Over half of the La­bor­no­ki in­va­si­on for­ce of ten tho­usand men was still en­cam­ped the­re, and the rest of the army, which had ac­com­pa­ni­ed Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil on his pur­su­it of Prin­cess Ka­di­ya, wo­uld so­on be re­tur­ning from the swamp. What chan­ce had Ani­gel, even with her new po­wers, aga­inst the full might of La­bor­nok and the Dark Po­wers of Oro­gas­tus?</p>
   <p>    King Volt­rik was now re­co­ve­red, and mo­re de­ter­mi­ned than ever that the three Prin­ces­ses sho­uld die. No do­ubt he wo­uld co­unt the de­fec­ti­on of the son he des­pi­sed as a small thing. Cer­ta­inly the dam­ned wi­zard wo­uld be de­ligh­ted! Oro­gas­tus might even pre­va­il upon the de­ran­ged mo­narch to ta­ke him as his he­ir. Per­haps that had be­en the vil­la­in's sche­me all along!</p>
   <p>    With far­se­e­ing Oro­gas­tus in po­wer and La­bor­nok set­ting out to con­qu­er the rest of the Pe­nin­su­la, wo­uld he and Ani­gel be sa­fe anyw­he­re? Or wo­uld they two and the hand­ful of fa­ith­ful com­pa­ni­ons be for­ced to flee to so­me far-dis­tant land whe­re -</p>
   <p>    A mo­ve­ment.</p>
   <p>    Antar snap­ped out of his brown study and tur­ned abo­ut, only to see that the Blue Vo­ice had left his pla­ce and was cre­eping for­ward to­ward him.</p>
   <p>    "What do you want?" the Prin­ce de­man­ded tru­cu­lently. The ga­le to­re his words from his lips.</p>
   <p>    "Only to spe­ak for a mo­ment, my Prin­ce. I ha­ve just now con­fer­red te­le­pat­hi­cal­ly with my Al­mighty Mas­ter, and he has as­ked me to pass on to you a mes­sa­ge of the gre­atest ur­gency."</p>
   <p>    "I ca­re na­ught for yo­ur fo­ul co­nj­urer's la­test fal­se­ho­ods. Get you back whe­re you we­re… Get back, I say!"</p>
   <p>    But the Blue Vo­ice ca­me on ste­adily, his ske­le­tal fa­ce split with a smi­le of such bla­tant in­sin­ce­rity that the Prin­ce was first in­fu­ri­ated and then alar­med. But be­fo­re he co­uld re­act and draw his sword, the mi­ni­on was upon him, sprin­ging li­ke a lot­hok upon its prey in ca­re­less dis­re­gard for the Prin­ce's su­it of azu­re ar­mor.</p>
   <p>    In one hand he bo­re a long, slen­der po­ni­ard, and he thrust it up­ward at the gor­get of sli­ding pla­tes that gu­ar­ded An­tar's neck. The sharp ste­el slid wit­hin, and had the Prin­ce not swa­yed to one si­de he wo­uld ha­ve had his thro­at cut. But as it hap­pe­ned the mi­se­ri­cord sli­ced only in­to the skin at the si­de of the neck be­fo­re the Prin­ce's me­tal ga­unt­let gras­ped the at­tac­ker's hand, and the bla­de was withd­rawn. The two men be­gan to thrash wildly in the bot­tom of the bo­at.</p>
   <p>    Princess Ani­gel pul­led up the ri­mo­riks at on­ce. She watc­hed An­tar and the Blue Vo­ice strug­gling, and she clung to the gun­wa­les of the rol­ling and pitc­hing craft unab­le to mo­ve for fe­ar of ca­using them to fo­un­der. Nor co­uld she call light­ning down upon the Vo­ice wit­ho­ut sin­king them all. She was at a loss and co­uld only in­vo­ke the Whi­te Lady. But no help se­emed forth­co­ming.</p>
   <p>    The Blue Vo­ice was inc­re­dibly strong, par­ta­king in so­me way of his de­mo­nic mas­ter's Dark Po­wers. He had cont­ri­ved to get on top of the now su­pi­ne ar­mo­red man, one knee on eit­her si­de of An­tar's body, and clutc­hed his long dag­ger in both bony hands, brin­ging the po­int clo­ser and clo­ser to the Prin­ce's fa­ce in its open hel­met. An­tar grip­ped the wrists of the enc­han­ter's acoly­te, but even his gre­at strength was not suf­fi­ci­ent to halt the po­ni­ard's ste­ady des­cent to­ward his eyes.</p>
   <p>    Anigel to­re the co­ro­net from her he­ad and scre­amed: "Don't! Oh, don't kill him! I will gi­ve you the ta­lis­man!"</p>
   <p>    The Blue Vo­ice lif­ted his sha­ven he­ad. A long scratch ex­ten­ded from one ear to the mid­dle of his brow and blo­od flow ma­de of his ga­unt fa­ce a gory mask. His bur­ning eyes met tho­se of the Prin­cess and he spo­ke thro­ugh grit­ted te­eth, the dag­ger not a fin­ger's bre­adth abo­ve An­tar's right eye.</p>
   <p>    "Put the co­ro­net upon my he­ad!" The Vo­ice was that of the sor­ce­rer Oro­gas­tus.</p>
   <p>    "No!" scre­amed Prin­ce An­tar. "He will then kill us both!"</p>
   <p>    But Ani­gel was le­aning for­ward, the co­ro­net in her hands, and the bo­at wal­lo­wed from si­de to si­de, and the first squ­all of peb­ble-hard ra­ind­rops pel­ted the three of them and mo­men­ta­rily flat­te­ned the sur­ging wa­ters.</p>
   <p>    And on eit­her si­de of the bo­at ro­se the two ri­mo­riks.</p>
   <p>    Their sle­ek bo­di­es ca­me up al­most slowly, and the­ir gre­at jaws we­re wi­de open, so hu­ge they co­uld en­com­pass a man's he­ad. The­ir long bar­bed ton­gu­es un­co­iled li­ke whips. With the de­li­cacy that they had ex­hi­bi­ted ta­king mi­ton from the soft fin­gers of the Prin­cess, the­se ton­gu­es now cur­led abo­ut the lo­wer arms of the Blue Vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    The man shri­eked. He was held fast. Ani­gel fell back, still hol­ding the co­ro­net. An­tar re­le­ased his grip upon the Vo­ice's wrists at the sa­me ti­me that the ani­mals be­gan to swim to­ward the stern, the­ir gre­at bo­di­es still half out of the wa­ter.</p>
   <p>    The sor­ce­rer's acoly­te, still scre­ec­hing his lungs out, was drag­ged over the Prin­ce, then ho­ist furt­her in­to the air to cle­ar the length of the bo­at. He di­sap­pe­ared in­to the black wa­ter off the stern with a gre­at splash, and the ri­mo­riks so­un­ded af­ter him. The ra­in held tem­po­ra­rily in abe­yan­ce.</p>
   <p>    Moments la­ter the two gre­at grin­ning he­ads pop­ped up at the bow, ne­ar to Prin­cess Ani­gel. A small shred of blue cloth hung from one ani­mal's to­oth.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Oh, fri­ends!…</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Take up the re­ins. A gre­at storm is ne­arly upon us. It will sink yo­ur bo­at if we do not ta­ke you qu­ickly to land.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Are you hurt?" the Prin­cess as­ked An­tar in gre­at an­xi­ety. "I see blo­od upon yo­ur bre­astp­la­te."</p>
   <p>    "It is only a scratch. On­ce aga­in you ha­ve sa­ved my li­fe, de­arest Lady, and -"</p>
   <p>    "To Let, then!" Ani­gel cri­ed, sha­king the re­ins. And they we­re off in a clo­ud of spu­me, with the dis­com­fi­ted Prin­ce aga­in han­ging on for his very li­fe.</p>

   <p>    <emphasis>W</emphasis>hen the Blue Vo­ice pe­ris­hed, Oro­gas­tus ut­te­red a mighty gro­an, and ca­me out of his tran­ce bat­hed in swe­at, and sank back in­to the gre­at cha­ir in his study from which he had sur­ve­yed the tac­tic's fa­ilu­re.</p>
   <p>    "It is my fa­ult! Mi­ne only the bla­me! And now the­re are two ta­lis­mans out of my re­ach."</p>
   <p>    And if his re­se­arc­hes we­re cor­rect abo­ut the Fe­ast of the Three Mo­ons, then only three days and fo­ur nights re­ma­ined in which he might sal­va­ge his gre­at sche­me…</p>
   <p>    Because he had be­en bes­po­ken by his Blue Vo­ice, Oro­gas­tus was ab­le to watch with his mind's eye the strug­gle bet­we­en the Vo­ice and Prin­ce An­tar. The bo­at ap­pe­ared to be dri­ven by a per­son in­vi­sib­le, ho­we­ver, sin­ce the Prin­cess was still shi­el­ded from the sor­ce­rer's pre­ter­na­tu­ral Sight by the amu­let now in­set wit­hin her ta­lis­man co­ro­net.</p>
   <p>    The Blue Vo­ice had wan­ted to post­po­ne his at­tack upon the Prin­ce un­til they re­ac­hed dry land; but it had se­emed to the sor­ce­rer that a bet­ter chan­ce of suc­cess ob­ta­ined if An­tar we­re me­na­ced out in the stormy wa­ter, with no fri­endly Wyvi­lo or lo­yal knights abo­ut to gi­ve war­ning or co­me to the Prin­ce's as­sis­tan­ce. Oro­gas­tus did not tell his as­sis­tant that if the worst hap­pe­ned and the ca­noe was up­set in the ri­ver, An­tar wo­uld ha­ve pe­ris­hed to­get­her with the Blue Vo­ice, be­ing he­avily we­igh­ted by his ar­mor-whi­le the ri­mo­riks wo­uld su­rely ha­ve res­cu­ed Ani­gel and her ta­lis­man.</p>
   <p>    But now Oro­gas­tus's agent was de­ad and Prin­ce An­tar still li­ved, be­sot­ted with the Prin­cess and qu­ite ca­pab­le of dra­wing un­cer­ta­in num­bers of La­bor­no­ki to his new ca­use. Ali­ve, he re­ma­ined a stumb­ling block of no me­an pro­por­ti­on to the sor­ce­rer's own am­bi­ti­ons.</p>
   <p>    Thinking fu­ri­o­usly, Oro­gas­tus ro­se from his cha­ir and prow­led abo­ut his study. The snow had stop­ped and the dam­ned Trip­le Mo­ons tur­ned the fast­ness of Mo­unt Brom in­to a sce­ne of bre­ath­ta­king sil­very be­a­uty.</p>
   <p>    Princess Ha­ra­mis had re­ti­red. The­ir con­ver­sa­ti­on this day had be­en most sa­tis­fac­tory. She now se­emed to ac­cept his ver­si­on of the La­bor­no­ki in­va­si­on, which thrust res­pon­si­bi­lity for the at­ro­ci­ti­es upon King Volt­rik and Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil, with him­self as only a re­luc­tant con­fe­de­ra­te. Al­most everyt­hing he had ma­na­ged to exp­la­in away or jus­tify. For­tu­na­tely, Ha­ra­mis had not tho­ught to scry Prin­cess Ka­di­ya du­ring that sis­ter's conf­ron­ta­ti­on with the la­te Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil. Oro­gas­tus jud­ged that any scrying of eit­her sis­ter that Ha­ra­mis might now at­tempt wo­uld be un­li­kely to harm his ca­use.</p>
   <p>    Because whet­her she ad­mit­ted it or not, Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis was in lo­ve with him.</p>
   <p>    This emo­ti­on the sor­ce­rer was most di­sinc­li­ned to scru­ti­ni­ze. Of co­ur­se it was im­pos­sib­le that he him­self wo­uld fall in lo­ve with her!… And yet so­me snic­ke­ring small de­mon de­ep wit­hin his so­ul war­ned him to be on gu­ard. He had not li­ed to Ha­ra­mis when he told her he had be­en ce­li­ba­te. He wo­uld ha­ve to ta­ke gre­at ca­re. His mind was in­vul­ne­rab­le to her, but his body cer­ta­inly was not; when they two had set each ot­her afi­re, the bri­ef joy had ex­ce­eded anyt­hing he had ever known be­fo­re.</p>
   <p>    And it had frigh­te­ned him to the co­re of his be­ing.</p>
   <p>    Sexual lo­ve was tra­di­ti­onal­ly for­bid­den to the wi­el­ders of ma­gic - and for go­od re­ason. It dist­rac­ted one from gre­at go­als, blin­ded obj­ec­ti­vity, sap­ped the will, and dra­ined away ener­gi­es that must be ho­ar­ded and con­cent­ra­ted if one wo­uld be­co­me truly po­wer­ful…</p>
   <p>    But he ne­eded her! And not only for the ta­lis­man she ow­ned. She was the ma­gi­cal part­ner he had se­arc­hed for thro­ugh long ye­ars, in­fi­ni­tely su­pe­ri­or to the to­ad­ying Vo­ices. She held the key to the Scept­re of Po­wer that even the Va­nis­hed Ones had fe­ared.</p>
   <p>    And so he wo­uld use Ha­ra­mis, sha­re with her, even ta­ke ple­asu­re in her. But he must ever be on gu­ard not to lo­ve her.</p>
   <p>    Tomorrow he wo­uld daz­zle the Prin­cess with mo­re an­ci­ent de­vi­ces, then wring her com­pas­si­on by tel­ling her mo­re of his li­fe-story. If she still did not suc­cumb, as was pos­sib­le in such a strong-min­ded yo­ung wo­man, then wo­uld co­me the de­li­ca­te lo­ose­ning of the sna­re - so that it co­uld be tigh­te­ned aga­in on­ce and for all, at the crow­ning mo­ment…</p>
   <p>    Orogastus left off his pa­cing and his fa­ce re­la­xed in­to a smi­le. He re­tur­ned aga­in to his cha­ir and, sit­ting, pas­sed in­to a star-eyed tran­ce and bes­po­ke his sing­le re­ma­ining acoly­te at Ru­wen­da Ci­ta­del.</p>
   <p>    "My Gre­en Vo­ice!"</p>
   <p>    "I he­ar, Al­mighty Mas­ter."</p>
   <p>    "Have you fo­und aught new among the bo­oks in the Ci­ta­del lib­rary?"</p>
   <p>    "A num­ber of re­fe­ren­ces that may be of im­port, Mas­ter. An an­ci­ent his­tory of Ru­wen­da spe­aks of a be­li­ef among the early hu­man set­tlers that they li­ved in the 'Age of the Tril­li­um.' And this first age's en­ding and the be­gin­ning of the new wo­uld be sig­na­led by a no­tab­le di­sas­ter, and events wo­uld cul­mi­na­te on a Fe­ast of the Three Mo­ons when the Sky Tril­li­um wo­uld ma­ni­fest it­self… One pre­su­mes so­me kind of unu­su­al ast­ro­no­mi­cal event is be­ing desc­ri­bed."</p>
   <p>    "No do­ubt. That is most in­te­res­ting, and con­firms one of my own the­ori­es. Go on."</p>
   <p>    "In a bo­ok pur­por­ting to desc­ri­be the ma­gi­cal prac­ti­ces of the Uis­gu was gi­ven a ro­ugh trans­la­ti­on of a cer­ta­in chant. I will qu­ote it:</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>One, two, three: three in one.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>One the Crown of the Mis­be­got­ten, wis­dom-gift, tho­ug­ht-mag­ni­fi­er.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Two the Sword of the Eyes, de­aling jus­ti­ce and mercy.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Three the Wand of the Wings, key and uni­fi­er.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Three, two, one: one in three.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Come, Tril­li­um. Co­me, Al­mighty.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Apparently, the Uis­gu sing the chant at the­ir own Trip­le Mo­on Fes­ti­val each ye­ar wit­ho­ut kno­wing its exact sig­ni­fi­can­ce."</p>
   <p>    "I can gu­ess its sig­ni­fi­can­ce," Oro­gas­tus sa­id ter­sely. "Aga­in, you ha­ve fo­und ma­te­ri­al that helps to con­firm my own re­se­arc­hes. Well do­ne! And is the­re mo­re?"</p>
   <p>    "Master, one last fin­ding. Of - of ina­us­pi­ci­o­us por­tent."</p>
   <p>    "Say on."</p>
   <p>    "It con­cerns the so-cal­led Thre­efold Scept­re of Po­wer, which we ha­ve ag­re­ed is the com­bi­na­ti­on of the ta­lis­mans. In a mo­ul­de­ring chest we chan­ced so­me days ago to find a scroll that was ne­ar il­le­gib­le. Only to­day was the vel­lum ca­re­ful­ly ste­amed open. I re­ali­zed at on­ce that the do­cu­ment was writ­ten in Tu­za­me­ni, the lan­gu­age of yo­ur own land."</p>
   <p>    "That is most unu­su­al. Hardly any Folk of the Pe­nin­su­la even know of my co­untry's exis­ten­ce. Go on."</p>
   <p>    "Most of the scroll is in­de­cip­he­rab­le. But a por­ti­on men­ti­oning a so-cal­led 'Gre­at Scept­re' can be re­ad. It says: The Gre­at Scept­re that was bro­ken and hid­den by the Ones Go­ne Away will re­ap­pe­ar and sha­ke the ro­ots of the world, ma­king the old new and ca­using a gre­at star to fall.' "</p>
   <p>    "I see." Oro­gas­tus did not spe­ak for so­me mo­ments. Then he sa­id, al­most lightly, "The­re are mil­li­ons of stars in the sky, my Vo­ice."</p>
   <p>    "Yes, Al­mighty Mas­ter."</p>
   <p>    "How has King Volt­rik re­ac­ted to news of Prin­ce An­tar's per­fidy?"</p>
   <p>    "He fell in­to a ra­ge when he he­ard that his son had pled­ged his sword and he­art to Prin­cess Ani­gel. But in spi­te of yo­ur wis­hes, he wo­uld not ag­ree to di­sown the Prin­ce im­me­di­ately. An­tar is po­pu­lar among the com­mon sol­di­ers be­ca­use of his go­od na­tu­re and physi­cal pro­wess, and he has nu­me­ro­us nob­le ad­he­rents among the re­la­ti­ves of his la­te mot­her. His Ma­j­esty wants to post­po­ne the di­sin­he­ri­tan­ce and de­po­si­ti­on of the Prin­ce un­til the re­turn to the Ci­ta­del of Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil's for­ce, which will inc­re­ase the num­ber of men lo­yal to the thro­ne."</p>
   <p>    "Our King is ac­ting wi­sely in so do­ing." And Oro­gas­tus ad­ded to him­self, <emphasis>Mo­re wi­se than I, and I am spa­red ma­king anot­her gre­at blun­der! Dark Po­wers, what has got­ten in­to me, that I sho­uld mis­cal­cu­la­te so grossly</emphasis>? But the Po­wers dec­li­ned to en­ligh­ten him; and he sa­id to the Vo­ice: "I fe­ar you will now ha­ve to gi­ve the King mo­re bad news. Ha­mil is de­ad. His army is mostly in­tact, ho­we­ver, and now un­der the com­mand of Lord Osor­kon. You ne­ed gi­ve Volt­rik no de­ta­ils - say that the si­tu­ati­on is as yet unc­le­ar - but the mis­si­on of cap­tu­ring Prin­cess Ka­di­ya and her ta­lis­man has un­for­tu­na­tely fa­iled, even as that mo­un­ted aga­inst Prin­cess Ani­gel."</p>
   <p>    "Master-!"</p>
   <p>    "And both my Red Vo­ice and my Blue Vo­ice are de­ad."</p>
   <p>    "May one ask how my breth­ren and the Lord Ge­ne­ral pe­ris­hed?"</p>
   <p>    "You may tell King Volt­rik that both the Red Vo­ice and Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil di­ed du­ring a bung­led at­tempt at for­cing Ka­di­ya to sur­ren­der her ta­lis­man. The de­vi­ce was ma­gi­cal­ly bon­ded to her, and it slew the pa­ir when they tri­ed to ta­ke hold of it. You must tell the King that Prin­cess Ka­di­ya es­ca­ped, but say that she fled in­to the de­ep swamp and will be no lon­ger a thre­at to La­bor­nok."</p>
   <p>    "And shall I al­so tell His Ma­j­esty the fa­te of the Blue Vo­ice?"</p>
   <p>    "Say not­hing. For yo­ur own in­for­ma­ti­on, the Blue Vo­ice at­temp­ted to over­co­me Prin­ce An­tar whi­le the two we­re on a bo­at. The Vo­ice fa­iled and was drow­ned."</p>
   <p>    "Alas! Blue was the bra­vest of us, and Red the shrew­dest ma­ni­pu­la­tor-"</p>
   <p>    "But you are the most in­tel­li­gent, my Gre­en Vo­ice, and to you re­ma­ins the most tick­lish of tasks: ke­eping King Volt­rik from do­ing anyt­hing ir­re­me­di­ably fo­olish un­til I can re­turn to the Ci­ta­del. Lord Osor­kon is le­ading his for­ce back at do­ub­le-ti­me. With the ri­ver flo­wing fas­ter from storms al­re­ady ta­king pla­ce in the mo­un­ta­ins, his bo­ats sho­uld ar­ri­ve wit­hin three days. You may tell the King that."</p>
   <p>    "The mon­so­on winds ha­ve al­re­ady bro­ught the first ra­ins to the Ci­ta­del re­gi­on as well, Mas­ter. So­on the land-tra­ils and wa­ter­ways thro­ugh this wretc­hed king­dom will be nigh im­pas­sab­le. Be­ca­use of a cer­ta­in rest­les­sness among Ru­wen­di­ans in the outl­ying re­gi­ons, King Volt­rik has de­ci­ded that his en­ti­re for­ce will re­ma­in he­re du­ring the ra­iny se­ason. He and his staff ha­ve al­re­ady wor­ked out plans to qu­ar­ter half of the army in va­ri­o­us Ru­wen­di­an ma­nors and vil­la­ges, and the ot­her half on Ci­ta­del Knoll."</p>
   <p>    "That is wi­se." <emphasis>And anot­her con­tin­gency I sho­uld ha­ve fo­re­se­en myself, and ad­vi­sed the King on</emphasis>! "I wish you to con­ti­nue, my Vo­ice, to dep­lo­re Prin­ce An­tar's tre­ac­hery to the King at every op­por­tu­nity. Ur­ge His Ma­j­esty to di­sown the Prin­ce as so­on as the lo­yal of­fi­cers ar­ri­ve. I ne­ed not stress the po­int that if anyt­hing sho­uld hap­pen to Volt­rik, my own plans wo­uld.be in the de­epest je­opardy."</p>
   <p>    "I ap­pre­ci­ate that, Mas­ter. I will do my best to co­un­sel the King. But he grows inc­re­asingly une­asy with the ap­pro­ach of the Three Mo­ons Fe­ast. Cer­ta­in Ru­wen­di­an ser­vants in the Ci­ta­del ha­ve slyly ma­de known to His Ma­j­esty the di­re prop­he­ci­es con­cer­ning this event. He wo­uld li­ke to re­turn to La­bor­nok-"</p>
   <p>    "He must not le­ave the Ci­ta­del! He wo­uld be ca­ught on the Tra­de Ro­ute by the Ra­ins!"</p>
   <p>    "Master, I ha­ve told him this. But even so, he thinks this Ci­ta­del is a pla­ce of ill-omen, be­ing so an­ci­ent and so per­va­ded with Ru­wen­di­an ma­gic-"</p>
   <p>    "Nonsense! Re­as­su­re him. He knows that my own Dark Po­wers, tho­se that bro­ught him vic­tory, are su­pe­ri­or! And I will be with him myself be­fo­re the Trip­le Mo­ons co­nj­o­in."</p>
   <p>    "Master! But how? It is an eight-day jo­ur­ney from yo­ur to­wer to the Ci­ta­del even du­ring fa­ir we­at­her."</p>
   <p>    "Never mind how I shall do it. Only ex­pect me be­fo­re this Mo­on Fe­ast, and tell King Volt­rik that I am co­ming, and that all will yet be well."</p>
   <p>    "Almighty Mas­ter, I will re­as­su­re him, and ma­ke light of the do­le­ful hap­pe­nings, and he will gre­et you and be eager to fol­low yo­ur co­un­sel."</p>
   <p>    "Excellent. Fa­re­well, my Gre­en Vo­ice."</p>
   <p>    "Master, fa­re­well."</p>
   <p>    When the vi­si­on of his acoly­te fa­ded, the sor­ce­rer sat with his he­ad in his hands for so­me ti­me. Then he ca­me to him­self, a grim exp­res­si­on har­de­ning his fe­atu­res.</p>
   <p>    "Everything <emphasis>will</emphasis> be well. First I shall con­sult the ice-mir­ror to descry Prin­cess Ka­di­ya, and then I shall ma­ke su­re of Ha­ra­mis."</p>
   <p>    On the next eve­ning, upon re­tur­ning to her cham­ber af­ter ha­ving sup­ped with Oro­gas­tus, Ha­ra­mis fo­und a gift awa­iting her - a lar­ge flat pac­ka­ge wrap­ped in black cloth and ti­ed with a sil­ver cord, to­get­her with a no­te from him:</p>
   <p>    My De­arest One:</p>
   <p>    Tomorrow I wo­uld show you my most pre­ci­o­us pos­ses­si­on, the ice-mir­ror with which I can scru­ti­ni­ze the fart­hest re­ac­hes of the world. I ha­ve sho­wed it to no ot­her hu­man be­ing. In or­der not to of­fend the Dark Po­wers who ca­use the mir­ror to ope­ra­te, I ask you to ac­com­pany me at­ti­red in the vest­ments wit­hin this pac­ka­ge, which I myself ha­ve ma­de es­pe­ci­al­ly for you, da­ring to ho­pe that you ha­ve co­me to sha­re my own de­light in the­se oc­cult myste­ri­es, as well as so­me small re­gard for the one who wo­uld lay them at yo­ur fe­et, in com­pany with his own he­art.</p>
   <p>    If I pre­su­me, de­arest Prin­cess, and you wo­uld rat­her le­ave he­re early on the mor­row, then for­gi­ve the bold­ness of this no­te and ex­cu­se the fo­olish one who has be­en alo­ne so long, wa­iting for you, ne­ver kno­wing lo­ve un­til now.</p>
   <p>    I am ever thi­ne, with the most pro­fo­und res­pect,</p>
   <p><strong>OROGASTUS</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Haramis was une­asy at the let­ter's overly in­ti­ma­te to­ne. <emphasis>Do­es he think that I am be­witc­hed by him, re­ady to hand him my he­art on a plat­ter? Am I a pe­asant girl, to be­co­me the sla­ve of the first man who to­uc­hes me? Or do­es he think me daz­zled by all the an­ci­ent de­vi­ces he has col­lec­ted</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    Haramis con­si­de­red the things he had so far shown her.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Who knows what tho­se mac­hi­nes might be ca­pab­le of? They did not lo­ok at all li­ke toys to me… and that one he par­ti­cu­larly fan­ci­ed, with the lo­ok of a cros­sbow-stock abo­ut it, had a dis­tinctly si­nis­ter aura.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>On the ot­her hand, per­haps he is not qu­ite the vil­la­in I be­li­eved him to be. Po­or man - what a hor­rib­le chil­d­ho­od.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Of co­ur­se his sup­port of King Volt­rik's in­va­si­on is inex­cu­sab­le. But I sup­po­se he co­uld not ha­ve di­rectly op­po­sed the mo­narch's mad­ness wit­ho­ut be­ing dri­ven away from La­bor­nok. And he knew that his des­tiny lay not in his own dis­tant ho­me­land but he­re, in the­se very mo­un­ta­ins, whe­re the Ca­vern of Black Ice cal­led out to him and sur­ren­de­red to him its tre­asu­res.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Had I be­en in his po­si­ti­on</emphasis>, she won­de­red, <emphasis>what wo­uld I ha­ve do­ne? Wo­uld I ha­ve be­en ab­le to com­port myself mo­re cle­verly and et­hi­cal­ly? Wo­uld I ha­ve dec­li­ned to be­co­me the Co­urt Sor­ce­rer of a cor­rupt ru­ler, if it me­ant ig­no­ring the sum­mons of my gre­ater des­tiny</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    She ope­ned the pac­ka­ge and be­gan to exa­mi­ne the vest­ments that we­re al­le­ged to ma­ke one ac­cep­tab­le to the Dark Po­wers. On­ce she had se­en them, she co­uld not re­sist put­ting them on, just to see how she wo­uld lo­ok.</p>
   <p>    There was an un­der­ro­be of so­me fur-li­ned black ma­te­ri­al, and matc­hing bo­ots. Over this went a ro­be of sil­very mesh with pa­nels of a gle­aming black, very cold to the to­uch. The­re was al­so a black clo­ak, li­ned in sil­ver, with an or­na­te clasp and the star mo­tif on the back. Fi­nal­ly she to­ok up a most awe­so­me he­ad­pi­ece that she he­si­ta­ted long mi­nu­tes be­fo­re don­ning. This was a sil­ver mask that fit­ted clo­sely to the front of her he­ad and be­ne­ath her chin, le­aving the lo­wer fa­ce un­co­ve­red. Aro­und its pe­ri­me­ter, be­gin­ning just abo­ve her sho­ul­ders, we­re sharp-po­in­ted rays, very tall at the crown, that ha­lo­ed her he­ad with a gre­at shi­ning star, le­aving her long black ha­ir fal­ling free be­hind. The mask was not me­tal, but so­me sof­ter ma­te­ri­al re­semb­ling sil­ve­red le­at­her. The­re we­re al­so matc­hing glo­ves with long cuffs.</p>
   <p>    Fully dres­sed at last in the­se gar­ments, Ha­ra­mis felt an ur­gent de­si­re to te­ar the things off, flee from the ro­om, and cry out for her lam­mer­ge­i­er to carry her away. Her ta­lis­man, which hung at her bre­ast as al­ways, had be­co­me cold as ice and the am­ber wit­ho­ut lus­ter.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>What am I do­ing</emphasis>? she as­ked her­self. <emphasis>This garb fe­els stran­ge. The de­vi­ces he has shown me thus far are not ma­gic</emphasis>-<emphasis>I am su­re of that</emphasis>-<emphasis>but the­re is so­met­hing abo­ut this clot­hing</emphasis>… <emphasis>Do the Dark Po­wers he spe­aks of truly exist? He ob­vi­o­usly be­li­eves in them, and, wha­te­ver they may be</emphasis>, so­met­hing <emphasis>gi­ves him abi­li­ti­es be­yond tho­se of or­di­nary men. He might very well be ab­le to ru­le the world, in ti­me, as is his am­bi­ti­on</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Is this why I am so stran­gely at­trac­ted to him? He do­es pos­sess po­wer, wha­te­ver its so­ur­ce, but what kind of po­wer? Is it anyt­hing I can le­arn and use?</emphasis></p>
   <p>    A spasm of dre­ad shot thro­ugh her. She lif­ted the Three-Win­ged Circ­le, fi­xed her eyes on the area wit­hin the Circ­le, and sa­id: "Whi­te Lady! Ans­wer me!"</p>
   <p>    For a long ti­me, not­hing hap­pe­ned. Then she tho­ught to ta­ke off the sil­very ga­unt­lets, whe­re­upon the wand war­med in her ba­re hands and the tril­li­um am­ber pul­sed with a dim glow when she cal­led. Slowly the pe­arly mist gat­he­red wit­hin the Circ­le, and in it the ra­va­ged fa­ce of the Arc­hi­ma­ge ap­pe­ared, res­ting upon a pil­low. She lo­oked up, ob­vi­o­usly in pa­in. Her eyes, dark slits with te­ars slowly trick­ling from them, re­gar­ded Ha­ra­mis clad in the gar­ments Oro­gas­tus had gi­ven her.</p>
   <p>    "So so­on?" The vo­ice was fa­int as a zephyr rip­pling a fi­eld of flo­wers. "Has he won you over so easily?… But no. I mi­sj­ud­ge you, de­ar child. I see that you ha­ve not cho­sen his way as yet."</p>
   <p>    "Of co­ur­se I ha­ven't!" Ha­ra­mis's an­xi­ety over the Whi­te Lady's ap­pe­aran­ce fa­ded in­to ir­ri­ta­ti­on. The old wo­man's to­ne had be­en that of an adult chi­ding a mis­be­ha­ving child. Ha­ra­mis had not cal­led the Arc­hi­ma­ge be­ca­use of gu­ilt. She had do­ne not­hing wrong, nor was she as­ha­med!</p>
   <p>    "I ca­me he­re be­ca­use I was in­vi­ted," the Prin­cess sa­id, with co­ol co­ur­tesy, "and be­ca­use I won­de­red whet­her an­yo­ne at all knew the truth abo­ut Oro­gas­tus. I ca­me to see for myself what he was - and to se­arch out his we­ak­nes­ses, as you yo­ur­self ba­de me!"</p>
   <p>    "It is true that such know­led­ge may pro­ve use­ful," the Arc­hi­ma­ge sa­id gently, "but is it wi­se to re­ma­in un­der his ro­of?"</p>
   <p>    "I am in no dan­ger he­re," Ha­ra­mis bro­ke in he­ed­les­sly. "My lam­mer­ge­i­er is free to carry me off at any ti­me. Oro­gas­tus can­not ste­al my ta­lis­man. He tre­ats me with co­ur­tesy-"</p>
   <p>    "More than co­ur­tesy."</p>
   <p>    Haramis flus­hed be­hind the sil­very mask. "Yes," she ad­mit­ted.</p>
   <p>    "I can see that you are int­ri­gu­ed, Ha­ra­mis, fas­ci­na­ted both by the man and by his po­wer. And you think you know a gre­at sec­ret abo­ut the de­vi­ces of the Va­nis­hed Ones that Oro­gas­tus do­es not sus­pect -a sec­ret that will ma­ke him vul­ne­rab­le."</p>
   <p>    "Yes," Ha­ra­mis sa­id. "That is, af­ter all, why I ca­me he­re, to se­arch for know­led­ge. The­re is a gre­at de­al to be le­ar­ned he­re. And the mo­re I le­arn, the mo­re qu­es­ti­ons ari­se abo­ut Ru­wen­da and its ma­gic. But I am le­ar­ning, and all will co­me right. I am cer­ta­in of it."</p>
   <p>    "Yes, all will co­me right… But you must co­me to me so­on and he­ar <emphasis>my</emphasis> vi­si­on. It dif­fers gre­atly from that of Oro­gas­tus, and to so­me pe­op­le it wo­uld se­em less glo­ri­o­us. But you must ma­ke up yo­ur own mind. Bet­we­en my path and that of Oro­gas­tus and his ilk, the­re is a gre­at gulf. You sho­uld know both ways be­fo­re ma­king yo­ur cho­ice."</p>
   <p>    "Yes," Ha­ra­mis ag­re­ed. "I shall co­me to you so­on."</p>
   <p>    "Do not wa­it too long."</p>
   <p>    The aged fa­ce fa­ded. The Circ­le was empty.</p>
   <p>    Haramis let the ta­lis­man fall on its cha­in. Then she went to the tall mir­ror in the bath cham­ber, and lo­oked upon the un­fa­mi­li­ar fi­gu­re ref­lec­ted the­re. Black and sil­ver. The eyes un­re­adab­le, the fi­gu­re tall and im­po­sing. And, yes, frigh­te­ning.</p>
   <p>    She tur­ned away from the mir­ror and be­gan to ta­ke off the dark vest­ments. But she knew she wo­uld put them on aga­in to­mor­row, and go with him to the Ca­vern of Black Ice.</p>

   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Having be­en war­ned thro­ugh the spe­ech wit­ho­ut words of the bo­at's im­mi­nent ar­ri­val, Spe­aker Sas­stu-Cha and a de­le­ga­ti­on of vil­la­ge el­ders met Prin­cess Ani­gel and Prin­ce An­tar at the ri­ver­si­de lan­ding, not too far dis­tant from the sce­ne of figh­ting. The Wyvi­lo led the two hu­mans in­to the shel­ter of a ne­arby sto­re­ho­use, sin­ce the ra­in was now co­ming down in tor­rents.</p>
   <p>    "It will put out the ho­use fi­res," the Spe­aker of Let re­mar­ked, "but the Glis­mak war­ri­ors will not be de­ter­red. We ha­ve al­re­ady re­ce­ived a de­pu­ta­ti­on of them de­man­ding the ran­som. And we ag­re­ed to pay. This one fe­ars, Prin­cess Ani­gel, that you ha­ve co­me too la­te."</p>
   <p>    She did not spe­ak, only sat down we­arily on a ba­le of go­ods, still we­aring Im­mu's hat and her ra­in­ca­pe which she had as­su­med when they lan­ded. Sin­ce she was ap­pa­rently ir­re­so­lu­te, the Prin­ce step­ped for­ward.</p>
   <p>    "You may re­mem­ber me. I am An­tar, Crown Prin­ce of La­bor­nok, whom you har­ri­ed from yo­ur town a few days ago. I am now the ser­vant of this gre­at Lady, who twi­ce sa­ved my li­fe, and so are tho­se of my men who yet li­ve. We ha­ve co­me he­re at gre­at risk to our li­ves in or­der to help you. Be­fo­re you sur­ren­der to yo­ur fo­es, you might let us exp­la­in what man­ner of as­sis­tan­ce we are pre­pa­red to of­fer."</p>
   <p>    "Say on," sa­id Sas­stu-Cha, in his de­ep, in­hu­man vo­ice. "But you sho­uld know that the in­va­ding Glis­mak num­ber over a tho­usand, and so­me one-third of our figh­ters ha­ve be­en cap­tu­red, and so­me ha­ve al­re­ady be­en eaten, and we can fight no mo­re this night."</p>
   <p>    "That sho­uld not be ne­ces­sary," sa­id the Prin­ce. He to­ok Ani­gel by the hand and gently ba­de her ri­se. Then he un­ti­ed the ra­in­ca­pe and re­mo­ved it, and to­ok off her hat.</p>
   <p>    At the sight of the ta­lis­man the Wyvi­lo we­re all dum­fo­un­ded, and one griz­zled el­der burst in­to oily te­ars.</p>
   <p>    "The Three-He­aded Mons­ter!" he exc­la­imed, al­so spe­aking the hu­man lan­gu­age. "Pra­ise be to the Flo­wer, she has ta­ken it from the tree!"</p>
   <p>    "And thro­ugh it," the Prin­ce ad­ded, "sla­in the le­ader of a mighty Glis­mak hor­de and ro­uted its war­ri­ors, thro­ugh cal­ling down light­ning from the sky."</p>
   <p>    Sasstu-Cha as­ked Ani­gel: "Is this true?"</p>
   <p>    "It is," sa­id she. A new light had co­me in­to her eyes and new strength in­to her ti­red body. The tril­li­um am­ber glo­wed in the whi­te me­tal of the co­ro­net and the open black flo­wer wit­hin was pla­in to see.</p>
   <p>    "You will blast the flesh-eating fi­ends to char­co­al?" as­ked the te­ar-sta­ined olds­ter eagerly.</p>
   <p>    "Take me to the Glis­mak," Ani­gel sa­id, "and you shall see what I will do."</p>
   <p>    At anot­her qu­ay on the far si­de of the vil­la­ge, whe­re a nar­row chan­nel se­pa­ra­ted Let from the ma­in­land, an enor­mo­us fle­et of cru­dely ma­de Glis­mak ca­no­es had as­semb­led to ac­cept the bo­oty. By the ti­me Ani­gel ar­ri­ved, mo­un­ta­ins of fo­od sacks and he­aps of ot­her ric­hes had be­en gat­he­red to­get­her by the de­fe­ated vil­la­gers, and we­re be­ing ins­pec­ted by the Glis­mak chi­ef, Hak-Sa-Omu, and his un­der­lings.</p>
   <p>    A hund­red or so of the Glis­mak host we­re gat­he­red on the pi­er, he­avily ar­med and smir­king with blo­ods­ta­ined fangs, ob­li­vi­o­us to the po­uring ra­in. A few of the vic­tors prow­led the still-smo­king al­leys in the vi­ci­nity, se­eking the scorc­hed bo­di­es that they cla­imed as the right­ful spo­ils of war. Ot­hers man­ned the ca­no­es, whi­le the vast ma­j­ority of the Glis­mak army had reg­ro­uped on the ma­in­land, awa­iting the di­vi­ding of the lo­ot.</p>
   <p>    Speaker Sas­stu-Cha ad­dres­sed the Glis­mak chi­ef in the abo­ri­gi­nal di­alect. The­re was a bri­ef spell of wrang­ling, and then Ani­gel was led for­ward. She re­mo­ved her hat. The am­ber in her co­ro­net lit up the ra­in-las­hed dock­si­de li­ke a sig­nal be­acon, and at the sight of the ta­lis­man all of the Glis­mak vo­iced a de­afe­ning howl of de­fi­an­ce.</p>
   <p>    "Be si­lent!" Ani­gel com­man­ded. And the fi­er­ce Folk sub­si­ded.</p>
   <p>    Then she be­gan to ad­dress them in her own lan­gu­age, but An­tar do­ub­ted not that her words we­re in­tel­li­gib­le to all of tho­se as­semb­led. She sa­id:</p>
   <p>    "You know who I am. Yo­ur breth­ren of the Ko­vu­ko Val­ley ha­ve bes­po­ken you over the le­agu­es, tel­ling what I ha­ve do­ne. The ta­lis­man is mi­ne, and sin­ce you are all Pe­op­le of the Flo­wer you know that I must be one of the Three Pe­tals of the Li­ving Tril­li­um. I am in­de­ed. And I in­tend to bring pe­ace to all this land."</p>
   <p>    Her words we­re drow­ned by a gre­at cho­rus of ro­ars and his­ses, but she lif­ted her arm and a mighty bolt of light­ning slas­hed ac­ross the sky abo­ve, and the si­mul­ta­ne­o­us blast of thun­der stun­ned all the Glis­mak to si­len­ce.</p>
   <p>    "You Glis­mak are po­or. Yo­ur Wyvi­lo co­usins are rich. You rob and kill them be­ca­use you ha­ve do­ne so from ti­me im­me­mo­ri­al, and you al­so eat the­ir flesh be­ca­use this is the cus­tom han­ded down from yo­ur cru­el an­ces­tors. But I tell you that you will do so no lon­ger! A new day has co­me. The old ways are en­ded and will not co­me aga­in…"</p>
   <p>    Watching and lis­te­ning to her, An­tar felt a sud­den thrill of ter­ror. Be­fo­re his very eyes, the slen­der, lo­vely yo­ung girl was chan­ging. She grew tal­ler mo­ment by mo­ment. Her gar­ments mel­ted away and she was clot­hed in a ro­be of bright light­nings, red and blue and daz­zling whi­te. Her sta­tu­re ex­ce­eded the he­ight of the ne­arby wa­re­ho­uses; she to­we­red in­to the stormy sky, arms stretc­hed wi­de, her ha­ir on fi­re, the am­ber at her brow as in­can­des­cent as a small sun, her vo­ice li­ke the so­un­ding of a tho­usand trum­pets.</p>
   <p>    "I will ha­ve pe­ace bet­we­en the Glis­mak and Wyvi­lo! Pe­ace bet­we­en yo­ur ra­ce and hu­man­kind! Go­od things will be sha­red. The child­ren of the Glis­mak will not ma­ke a pro­fes­si­on of war as the­ir fat­hers did, but will le­arn to work. No per­son will kill anot­her un­der pa­in of my wrath, nor will you eat one anot­her's flesh!"</p>
   <p>    As the ap­pa­ri­ti­on had grown, the Glis­mak cri­ed out mo­re and mo­re, and now they we­re aff­righ­ted to the pits of the­ir sa­va­ge so­uls. Tho­se in the bo­ats co­ve­red the­ir eyes and co­we­red, and tho­se on the dock and on the op­po­si­te sho­re fell on the­ir fa­ces, gro­ve­ling. Only the chi­ef, Hak-Sa-Omu, still sto­od up­right, his gla­ring eyes star­ting out of the­ir soc­kets and his gre­at jaws aga­pe.</p>
   <p>    "The go­ods on this dock will not be ta­ken!" Ani­gel dec­la­red. "The Glis­mak will withd­raw empty-han­ded and re­ma­in in the­ir ho­me pla­ces un­til the dry se­ason, pon­de­ring my words. If any Glis­mak for­ce da­res to emer­ge and ma­ke war, we will po­ur our wrath upon it" - three gre­at thun­derc­laps ham­me­red the air in qu­ick suc­ces­si­on - "and the di­so­be­di­ent war­ri­ors will not li­ve to see the go­od things that will be gi­ven to tho­se Glis­mak who obey my com­mands!"</p>
   <p>    The to­we­ring gi­an­tess now had three he­ads. And each one was crow­ned with the tril­li­um.</p>
   <p>    "We spe­ak now to Hak-Sa-Omu, chi­ef of the Glis­mak! Do you he­ar, wretc­hed one?"</p>
   <p>    The le­ader ut­te­red a small whim­pe­ring phra­se. Prin­ce An­tar co­uld see that he was sha­king from his pla­ted he­ad to his ta­lo­ned fe­et.</p>
   <p>    "Will you ta­ke yo­ur pe­op­le away and do as I ha­ve com­man­ded?"</p>
   <p>    The fe­eb­le reply co­uld only ha­ve be­en af­fir­ma­ti­ve.</p>
   <p>    "Will you wa­it in pe­ace for me to co­me aga­in?"</p>
   <p>    Again af­fir­ma­ti­ve.</p>
   <p>    "Then go!"</p>
   <p>    There was a fi­nal de­to­na­ti­on that blin­ded and de­afe­ned all the spec­ta­tors, and then the ap­pa­ri­ti­on was go­ne and so was Ani­gel.</p>
   <p>    Hak-Sa-Omu ut­te­red a qu­ick word, and he and every one of his Folk re­ma­ining in Let went scramb­ling pell-mell in­to the ca­no­es, which set out with fran­tic has­te for the sho­re. The Glis­mak then aban­do­ned the­ir bo­ats and scur­ri­ed away in­to the night.</p>
   <p>    Out from be­hind a stack of fi­ne fur­ni­tu­re ca­me small Prin­cess Ani­gel, dres­sed aga­in in her hun­ting garb and with her wet blon­de ha­ir strag­gling down her che­eks. She smi­led up at the Wyvi­lo el­ders and the Prin­ce, who ha­iled her.</p>
   <p>    "Powerful Lady," the Spe­aker exc­la­imed, bo­wing pro­fo­undly, "you ha­ve in­de­ed sa­ved us as you sa­id you wo­uld! For­gi­ve this lowly one for do­ub­ting you."</p>
   <p>    "You did it!" An­tar cri­ed. "And wit­ho­ut kil­ling a one of them!"</p>
   <p>    "I was stu­pid not to ha­ve tho­ught of the way so­oner," she sa­id calmly. "The Glis­mak are li­ke child­ren. You do not ar­gue and at­tempt to use swe­et re­ason with child­ren, es­pe­ci­al­ly when they are in a wil­lful and mur­de­ro­us mo­od. Un­for­tu­na­tely, all you can re­al­ly do un­der such cir­cums­tan­ces is frigh­ten them in­to be­ha­ving. Then la­ter, they can be re­aso­ned with and edu­ca­ted."</p>
   <p>    "It is so." Sas­stu-Cha nod­ded his he­ad. "Any pa­rent knows it."</p>
   <p>    "I co­uld not ha­ve kil­led them," Ani­gel ad­mit­ted in a much lo­wer vo­ice, so that only An­tar and the Spe­aker co­uld he­ar. "But it was not ne­ces­sary. It se­ems that all kinds of tho­ughts can be ma­de ma­ni­fest thro­ugh the ta­lis­man. And so as the Glis­mak fled, I told them that they wo­uld be my pe­op­le and I wo­uld lo­ve them."</p>
   <p>    "So will we al­so be yo­urs," sa­id the Spe­aker. "And this one dec­la­res to you, con­qu­ering Prin­cess, that we are now yo­ur deb­tors, and our ho­nor de­mands that we re­pay you for the unp­re­ce­den­ted thing you ha­ve ac­comp­lis­hed he­re to­night."</p>
   <p>    All of the ot­her Wyvi­lo stan­ding abo­ut jo­ined the­ir vo­ices to that of the Spe­aker, for even the ones who did not know the lan­gu­age of the Prin­cess so­me­how un­ders­to­od what had be­en sa­id.</p>
   <p>    Anigel lo­we­red her eyes for a mo­ment. The ra­in still fell, but not hard, and to the so­uth­west the sky sho­wed stars. The­re wo­uld still be a few cle­ar days be­fo­re the Fe­ast of the Three Mo­ons.</p>
   <p>    "Dear fri­ends," the Prin­cess sa­id. "Yo­ur Glis­mak fo­es we­re grow­nup child­ren. But I now must fa­ce ene­mi­es who are fully ma­tu­re - not only in the ways of war but al­so in the spin­ning of evil enc­hant­ments. They wo­uld not flinch be­fo­re my silly hor­ror-show, nor be mo­ved by my pro­fes­si­on of lo­ve. I was sent on my qu­est by the Whi­te Lady, whom we all re­ve­re. Long ago, at the ti­me of my birth and that of my two sis­ters, she sa­id that we three Pe­tals of the Li­ving Tril­li­um fa­ced a ter­rib­le des­tiny. But she al­so sa­id that all wo­uld be well. Thro­ug­ho­ut most of my qu­est I co­uld not be­li­eve that this last was pos­sib­le. But now I am wil­ling to trust."</p>
   <p>    She to­ok one of An­tar's hands and drew him clo­se to her.</p>
   <p>    "Here is La­bor­nok's next right­ful King. He is a go­od man. In Ru­wen­da Ci­ta­del is his wic­ked fat­her, Volt­rik. I shall set out for the Ci­ta­del at dawn to­mor­row, and the­re I will cast King Volt­rik down from the Ru­wen­di­an thro­ne he se­ized. Sas­stu-Cha, if you and yo­ur pe­op­le wo­uld truly re­pay me, then ac­com­pany and de­fend me as I re­ga­in my king­dom."</p>
   <p>    "We ha­ve so­me fi­ve hund­red sur­vi­ving war­ri­ors, Prin­cess, and they will go whe­re you bid them. Our war-chi­ef, Lum­mo­mu-Ko, was slightly wo­un­ded and rests in hos­pi­tal. But he will be eager to pled­ge him­self to you to­mor­row. Anyt­hing that you de­si­re of us, you may ha­ve."</p>
   <p>    Anigel sa­id: "Prin­ce An­tar will be in com­mand of tho­se who fol­low me. I thank you and yo­ur pe­op­le with all my he­art for ral­lying to my ca­use. But I must warn you that my ene­mi­es are po­wer­ful-"</p>
   <p>    "So is the ta­lis­man you we­ar," sa­id Sas­stu-Cha.</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess sig­hed. She to­ok the co­ro­net off her he­ad, ope­ned the front of her tu­nic, and slid the lit­tle ti­ara in­si­de. "For the rest of this night, I will let it rest. And so must I, for I am we­ary be­yond tel­ling."</p>
   <p>    "You and yo­ur Prin­ce must ac­cept my hos­pi­ta­lity," the Spe­aker sa­id at on­ce. And the ot­her Wyvi­lo el­ders smi­led and bo­wed, and with many a ges­tu­re and word ur­ged Ani­gel and An­tar to co­me along. So they went off down the stre­et of blac­ke­ned, ste­aming ru­ins in­to the un­to­uc­hed part of the vil­la­ge, and af­ter a whi­le the clo­uds pas­sed on and the Three Mo­ons sho­ne down and we­re ref­lec­ted on the qu­i­et ri­ver.</p>
   <p>    As she und­res­sed and lay down to sle­ep in the ro­om of the Spe­aker's ol­dest child, who had gi­ven up her bed joy­ful­ly to the sa­vi­or of Let, Ani­gel co­uld not es­ca­pe the fe­eling that so­me­one was watc­hing her. Ari­sing, she lo­oked out the win­dows, in­to the clo­set, and even un­der the bed, but no one was the­re.</p>
   <p>    And then she saw the ta­lis­man's light throb­bing be­ne­ath the clot­hes she had pi­led on top of it.</p>
   <p>    Reluctantly, she to­ok the co­ro­net up. She did not want to put it on. Had she not do­ne eno­ugh for one day? What if anot­her dre­ad­ful vi­si­on sho­uld co­me to her, spo­iling the sle­ep she ne­eded so des­pe­ra­tely?</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Put it on.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "Oh - oh, <emphasis>lot­hok-dung</emphasis>!" the Prin­cess cri­ed pe­tu­lantly. Sit­ting on the ed­ge of the be­a­uti­ful Ru­wen­di­an-style bed, she pla­ced the co­ro­net lightly on her ha­ir.</p>
   <p>    "Kadi!" she cri­ed. And she ne­arly fa­in­ted with hap­pi­ness, for the­re in the vi­si­on was her sis­ter, her eyes dan­cing and a gre­at smi­le upon her dirty fa­ce. She sat by a camp­fi­re with lar­ge num­bers of grin­ning Uis­gu gat­he­red ro­und, and in her lap was a glo­wing thing li­ke a blunt sword with a pom­mel of three dark balls co­nj­o­ined, and at the­ir cen­ter was the shi­ning am­ber of a tril­li­um amu­let.</p>
   <p>    "Well, it's abo­ut ti­me you res­pon­ded to me!" Ka­di­ya sa­id with so­me ir­ri­ta­ti­on. "You've be­en so in­vol­ved with yo­ur­self that you pa­id no at­ten­ti­on wha­te­ver to my bes­pe­aking. And I ne­ver tho­ught to he­ar such words from yo­ur mo­uth, eit­her."</p>
   <p>    "Kadi, Ka­di!" Ani­gel was la­ug­hing and we­eping at the sa­me ti­me. "You are ali­ve and sa­fe!"</p>
   <p>    Her sis­ter flo­uris­hed the glo­wing thing. "Thanks to the Three-Lo­bed Bur­ning Eye, my ta­lis­man."</p>
   <p>    "I saw you -" Ani­gel he­si­ta­ted. "My own ta­lis­man vo­uch­sa­fed me a vi­si­on sho­wing you the cap­ti­ve of Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya's fa­ce be­ca­me so­ber. "They to­ok me, a band of sco­uts of Ha­mil's for­ce, not long af­ter I se­cu­red my ta­lis­man. I had yet lit­tle idea of what this" - she held up the sword - "was ca­pab­le of do­ing. The Red Vo­ice of Oro­gas­tus le­ar­ned first, to his de­ath. Af­ter that no one da­red try to ta­ke it away, but Ha­mil ho­ped to for­ce me to gi­ve it up. The­re we­re Uis­gu wo­men un­der his po­wer he co­uld use to co­er­ce me."</p>
   <p>    "Oh, Ka­di -how monst­ro­us!"</p>
   <p>    Kadiya was frow­ning now. "The­re is not­hing mer­ci­ful abo­ut the war we fight now, Sis­ter mi­ne. Ha­ve you not yet le­ar­ned that for yo­ur­self? The­re is po­wer in this." She glan­ced at the po­int­less sword she held. "But po­wer is a bur­den - one must use it spa­ringly, Ani­gel, and only with a cle­an mind. Even an­ger can ser­ve, but it must be cont­rol­led: that is a part of wis­dom which I ha­ve ga­ined."</p>
   <p>    "Then yo­ur ta­lis­man," Ani­gel whis­pe­red, "chan­ged you, as mi­ne chan­ged me from a whim­pe­ring cra­ven…"</p>
   <p>    "My ta­lis­man ga­ve me po­wer which I must le­arn to tem­per with jus­ti­ce. Ha­mil, and tho­se of the Skri­tek who sto­od to be his monst­ro­us we­apons - they we­re jud­ged and shall not walk the­se ways aga­in. For even a sword of mercy such as I now be­ar can de­al de­ath."</p>
   <p>    "I -I al­so used my ta­lis­man to kill," sa­id Ani­gel hal­tingly. "But only on­ce, and then by ac­ci­dent. I co­uld not pos­sibly do it aga­in."</p>
   <p>    "I co­uld," Prin­cess Ka­di­ya sa­id very qu­i­etly, "if it aga­in be­ca­me ne­ces­sary. And it may. The­re is still a rem­nant of Ha­mil's for­ce he­ading back to­ward the Ci­ta­del. But me­anw­hi­le, the Uis­gu and the Nysso­mu gat­her. The­re is a small army which grows ho­urly. To me they ha­ve tur­ned for le­aders­hip. May the ta­lis­man grant that I ser­ve them as well as they wo­uld ser­ve us."</p>
   <p>    "Would they help us to re­ga­in our king­dom?"</p>
   <p>    "They say that they will. The Uis­gu se­em so ti­mid and fra­il when you me­et them at the Tre­vis­ta Fa­ir - but they are re­al­ly bra­ve lit­tle things, and stron­ger than they ap­pe­ar. They can tra­vel very spe­edily in bo­ats pul­led by a kind of gi­ant pel­rik -"</p>
   <p>    Anigel la­ug­hed. "I know. I ha­ve be­co­me a blo­od-sis­ter to such cre­atu­res myself and dri­ven the­ir bo­ats."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya smi­led. "So I saw. And to­mor­row you will set out with yo­ur own army to­ward the Ci­ta­del. And yo­ur prin­cely swe­et­he­art is yo­ur new ge­ne­ral!"</p>
   <p>    Anigel flus­hed, and sa­id crossly: "He is not my swe­et­he­art! But he is a nob­le and lo­yal man, and he has dec­la­red him­self my sla­ve fo­re­ver."</p>
   <p>    To this Ka­di­ya sa­id not­hing, but only smi­led.</p>
   <p>    Anigel now had tho­ught of a mo­re im­por­tant mat­ter. "Ka­di, be­si­des my sight of you cap­tu­red, I had anot­her aw­ful vi­si­on. My ta­lis­man sho­wed me Ha­ra­mis with Oro­gas­tus, and she se­emed to be be­witc­hed by him!"</p>
   <p>    Kadiya be­ca­me de­adly se­ri­o­us. "The­re is mo­re than enc­hant­ment at work bet­we­en tho­se two… Ani, I en­vi­si­oned Ha­ra­mis myself, and I gre­atly fe­ar that our sis­ter has fal­len in lo­ve with the fo­ul sor­ce­rer. Or per­haps fal­len in lo­ve with the po­wer he has of­fe­red to sha­re with her."</p>
   <p>    "It's not pos­sib­le!"</p>
   <p>    "Yes, it is," Ka­di­ya sta­ted, her fa­ce grim. "I bes­po­ke the Whi­te Lady thro­ugh my ta­lis­man to­night. The Arc­hi­ma­ge is very clo­se to de­ath and wis­hes Ha­ra­mis to at­tend her, but Ha­ra­mis is de­ter­mi­ned to re­ma­in with the enc­han­ter. I tri­ed to bes­pe­ak Ha­ra, but she did not ans­wer me. You might try to re­ach her, but do not be surp­ri­sed if she will not talk to you, eit­her. Per­sons who are de­eply in lo­ve ha­ve ro­om in the­ir minds only for one per­son."</p>
   <p>    "This is dre­ad­ful. The po­or Whi­te Lady! And our sis­ter. If she has be­en se­du­ced by Oro­gas­tus, then her ta­lis­man may be un­der his cont­rol! What can we do?"</p>
   <p>    "Nothing at all. The Arc­hi­ma­ge has ac­comp­lis­hed the task she set for her­self. We three ha­ve our ta­lis­mans. Still, we are free spi­rits, you and I and Ha­ra­mis, and must ma­ke our own cho­ices."</p>
   <p>    In a vo­ice tremb­ling with fo­re­bo­ding, Ani­gel sa­id: "You -you know that all three ta­lis­mans must co­me to­get­her if they are to work the­ir gre­at ma­gic pro­perly. And the­re is a po­ten­ti­al in them for evil as well as go­od."</p>
   <p>    "Yes. So I le­ar­ned from one I met on my qu­est-a ser­vant of the Va­nis­hed Ones, I be­li­eve."</p>
   <p>    "Vanished Ones? But how - "</p>
   <p>    "It is a long story that will ha­ve to wa­it. Rest now, my bra­ve lit­tle Sis­ter, and so will I. We will me­et so­on at the Ci­ta­del."</p>
   <p>    After the vi­si­on of Ka­di­ya fa­ded, Ani­gel tri­ed to bes­pe­ak Ha­ra­mis. She saw a vi­si­on of her sis­ter as­le­ep; but as Ka­di­ya had pre­dic­ted, Ha­ra­mis did not he­ar the men­tal call, be­ing to­tal­ly rapt in a dre­am of Oro­gas­tus.</p>
   <p>    Anigel re­mo­ved her co­ro­net. Its light had dim­med. "I shall ne­ver be ab­le to sle­ep," she sa­id to her­self. But then she tho­ught to to­uch the sil­very ti­ara and ask it to grant her rest, and a mo­ment la­ter fell softly in­to slum­ber.</p>
   <p>    In the mor­ning, she and An­tar and a gre­at fle­et of Wyvi­lo war­ri­ors went to fetch the gro­up of knights en­cam­ped ac­ross the ri­ver. Then they sped up the Gre­at Mu­tar to Tass Falls, whe­re they dis­co­ve­red that the rest of the La­bor­no­ki for­ce had aban­do­ned the­ir camp, ig­no­ring the Prin­ce's ear­li­er or­der.</p>
   <p>    A third gre­at storm was thre­ate­ning as Ani­gel and An­tar and the­ir pe­op­le pa­used at the fo­ot of the cas­ca­de and dis­cus­sed what they wo­uld do. The Prin­cess used her ta­lis­man to sum­mon a vi­si­on of Tass Town, and the pla­ce was ne­arly de­ser­ted. All of the La­bor­no­ki flat­bo­ats of the Prin­ce's se­arch-party, as well as tho­se of the gar­ri­son, had de­par­ted for the Ci­ta­del in an­ti­ci­pa­ti­on of the ap­pro­ac­hing mon­so­on. The­re wo­uld be no fo­emen wa­iting at the top of the wa­ter­fall; but the­re wo­uld be no lar­ge wa­terc­raft ca­pab­le of trans­por­ting Ani­gel's Wyvi­lo army to the Ci­ta­del up the­re, eit­her.</p>
   <p>    "We will as­cend on the log-lift," Prin­ce An­tar sa­id. "It will easily carry the Wyvi­lo ca­no­es if we ma­ke many trips. At the top, we will ha­ve to wa­it un­til the big tem­pest sub­si­des and then pad­dle up La­ke Wum to the mo­uth of the Lo­wer Mu­tar -"</p>
   <p>    "No, Prin­ce." The Wyvi­lo war-chi­ef na­med Lum­mo­mu-Ko step­ped for­ward. "The­re is a much bet­ter way to tra­vel up the la­ke. And we will not ha­ve to awa­it the end of the storm." He told An­tar what was in his mind.</p>
   <p>    Even tho­ugh he was a man of sto­ut he­art, the Prin­ce blanc­hed.</p>
   <p>    "Such a thing is pos­sib­le?" Prin­cess Ani­gel as­ked, ove­ra­wed.</p>
   <p>    "Even hu­mans ha­ve do­ne it," Lum­mo­mu-Ko sa­id lof­tily. "The­re is a cer­ta­in pe­ril, of co­ur­se. But if we win thro­ugh we co­uld be at Ru­wen­da Ci­ta­del in only a few ho­urs."</p>
   <p>    "Then we will do it," the Prin­cess de­ci­ded.</p>
   <p>    The first ra­ind­rops be­gan to pat­ter down on the lit­tle army. The Wyvi­lo to­ok no no­ti­ce. They we­re equ­al­ly at ease in sun or sho­wer.</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess cal­led out to the knights: "My hu­man fri­ends, pack up yo­ur ar­mor for now, sin­ce you will not ne­ed it for so­me ti­me, and then we will be on our way. We will go to the vi­ci­nity of the Ci­ta­del and sec­re­te our­sel­ves in the Mi­re ne­arby. From the­re we will sum­mon all the fu­gi­ti­ve no­bi­lity and com­mon pe­op­le of Ru­wen­da who fled in­to the swamp to jo­in us in re­ta­king our co­untry. My sis­ter Prin­cess Ka­di­ya is li­ke­wi­se spe­eding to the Ci­ta­del to­get­her with a lar­ge army of Uis­gu figh­ters. If God wills, we will be re­ady to en­ga­ge the foe on the Fe­ast of Three Mo­ons."</p>
   <p>    Anigel put on Im­mu's bro­ad-brim­med hat to ke­ep the mo­un­ting ra­in out of her eyes, and then was the first to mo­unt the log-lift.</p>
   <p>    Later on that sa­me day, a pat­he­tic, star­ving cre­atu­re pad­dled in­to storm­bo­und Let on a ric­kety re­ed raft and then fell in­to a swo­on. The pe­op­le of the vil­la­ge re­cog­ni­zed her as be­ing of the Folk, and hen­ce Kin, and ag­re­ed that she must be gi­ven aid. When she ca­me to her sen­ses the fol­lo­wing day and as­ked af­ter Prin­cess Ani­gel, the Wyvi­lo we­re as­to­nis­hed.</p>
   <p>    "The gre­at Lady is rus­hing on her way to her own Ci­ta­del," sa­id the fo­rest Folk, "with her ma­gi­cal ta­lis­man on her brow and an army of our pe­op­le at her com­mand. Our war­ri­ors ha­ve bes­po­ken to us that they ri­de up the la­ke on the wings of the tem­pest, bor­ne on lar­ge log rafts with sa­ils wi­desp­re­ad to run with the wind… But why might a wretch such as you ask af­ter her?"</p>
   <p>    "Wretch wretch wretch!" sho­uted Im­mu. "Be­ca­use she ne­eds me, that's why!"</p>
   <p>    And she ma­de such an outcry and com­mo­ti­on that they ag­re­ed at last to let her ta­ke a ca­noe when the storm aba­ted, with three strong Wyvi­lo yo­uths to pad­dle. And thus Im­mu went off in pur­su­it of her Prin­cess.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Orogastus and Ha­ra­mis went to­get­her to the Ca­vern of Black Ice. She was eager to le­arn whet­her his va­un­ted ice-mir­ror was truly ma­gi­cal, or only anot­her an­ci­ent de­vi­ce, as she sus­pec­ted.</p>
   <p>    Outside the frost-co­ve­red do­or, as he was abo­ut to de­li­ver his in­can­ta­ti­on to the Dark Po­wers, he chan­ced to lo­ok down upon her, and saw her bright blue eyes shi­ning wi­de in the sil­ver-mas­ked fa­ce, her lips softly par­ted in a smi­le of an­ti­ci­pa­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus tho­ught that she had ne­ver se­emed so be­a­uti­ful or ex­ci­ting as she did now, star-crow­ned and dres­sed in the sa­me sil­ver and black that symbo­li­zed his own com­mit­ment to the Dark Po­wers. He co­uld not help him­self, but to­ok her fa­ce in his glo­ved hands and kis­sed her mo­uth.</p>
   <p>    In ti­me the­ir lips re­luc­tantly par­ted. The sor­ce­rer sig­hed. "I ho­pe that the Po­wers will not be angry. But the sight of you, so lo­vely and myste­ri­o­us and so clo­se to me… Oh, Ha­ra­mis, stay with me!" he ple­aded, his arms tigh­te­ning abo­ut her. "I know that the Whi­te Lady has cal­led you. But she wo­uld ta­ke you from me, tell you the sa­me old half-truths and unt­ruths, try to bend yo­ur will to hers -"</p>
   <p>    "Except for her help, I wo­uld not ha­ve be­en born," Ha­ra­mis re­min­ded him. "I must he­ar her dying words. She ga­ve me my Black Tril­li­um, sent me on my qu­est. I am su­re that she gu­ided and gu­ar­ded me when I wo­uld ha­ve pe­ris­hed in the high mo­un­ta­ins. I can­not ig­no­re her plea. If you ha­ve spo­ken the truth, you ha­ve not­hing to fe­ar from my go­ing."</p>
   <p>    "She ke­eps the Crown of Ru­wen­da from you!"</p>
   <p>    "No. She ke­eps <emphasis>it for</emphasis> me. And with or wit­ho­ut it, I <emphasis>am</emphasis> Qu­e­en of Ru­wen­da-no mat­ter who­se sol­di­ers oc­cupy the Ci­ta­del!" She lo­oked chal­len­gingly stra­ight in­to his eyes.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus sig­hed. "Why do we tarry out he­re in the chill? The ice-mir­ror awa­its."</p>
   <p>    He be­gan his so­lemn in­vo­ca­ti­on of the Dark Po­wers, be­se­ec­hing de­iti­es that Ha­ra­mis strongly sus­pec­ted to be no­ne­xis­tent to lo­ok kindly upon each of them. Po­or de­lu­ded man! But she did not smi­le. Let them se­em ma­gi­cal to him, whi­le she con­ti­nu­ed to we­igh his sin­ce­rity. She was be­co­ming inc­re­asingly con­vin­ced that many of the ext­ra­or­di­nary-po­wers wi­el­ded by Oro­gas­tus had not­hing what­so­ever to do with ma­gic. But even so, he did use the­se po­wers. <emphasis>Can they be co­un­te­red by my ma­gic</emphasis>? she won­de­red, re­mem­be­ring his "ma­gic" tab­let. <emphasis>Qu­ite pos­sibly they can, but I had best not ex­pe­ri­ment on his pre­ci­o­us ice-mir­ror</emphasis>-<emphasis>he wo­uld su­rely kill me at on­ce if I da­ma­ged that. No, I shall watch, and le­arn</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    Haramis did not ha­ve to fe­ign awe when he led her in­to the cham­ber of the gre­at ice-mir­ror and sum­mo­ned its re­si­dent de­mon. Oro­gas­tus had pro­po­sed that they use the mir­ror to scry her two sis­ters, and she had ag­re­ed at on­ce, fe­eling gu­ilty at ha­ving neg­lec­ted to lo­ok for them her­self, thro­ugh her ta­lis­man. But ha­ving do­ne it that first day and se­en them sa­fe, she had for­got­ten Ani­gel and Ka­di­ya in her own pre­oc­cu­pa­ti­ons, which se­emed so much mo­re mo­men­to­us…</p>
   <p>    Now, ha­ving be­en ca­uti­oned to ke­ep si­len­ce, she wa­ited as Oro­gas­tus in­to­ned his re­qu­est and the mir­ror (which she co­uld see cle­arly was so­me sort of mac­hi­ne, and not even in the best wor­king or­der) res­pon­ded with gib­be­rish and pro­du­ced first a map and then an ama­zing fully co­lo­red ima­ge of Ka­di­ya, fol­lo­wed by a si­mi­lar ma­ni­fes­ta­ti­on fe­atu­ring Ani­gel. Both sis­ters we­re vo­ya­ging on the wa­ter, in he­avy ra­in, and ne­it­her spo­ke, alt­ho­ugh the mir­ror ga­ve forth the na­tu­ral so­unds that ac­com­pa­ni­ed each vi­si­on.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya tra­ve­led with a ve­ri­tab­le army of Uis­gu Od­dlings and ro­de in a na­ti­ve ves­sel cle­verly fas­hi­oned of re­eds. The map-plot of the mir­ror sho­wed that this Uis­gu flo­til­la was in the Up­per Mu­tar just abo­ve Tre­vis­ta. The gre­at ri­ver flo­wed tur­bu­lently and was la­den with up­ro­oted tre­es and ot­her flo­od deb­ris; but ne­it­her this nor the ste­ady down­po­ur se­emed to in­con­ve­ni­en­ce Ka­di­ya or her small com­pa­ni­ons. So­me of the Uis­gu wo­re ar­mor of gol­den sca­les, as did the Prin­cess, and all of the Od­dlings car­ri­ed pri­mi­ti­ve we­apons. But Ka­di­ya had not even her lit­tle dag­ger any­mo­re, but bo­re only her ta­lis­man, that stran­ge thing li­ke a po­int­less Sword of Mercy.</p>
   <p>    The vi­si­on of Ani­gel was mo­re alar­ming. The mir­ror sho­wed a mas­si­ve raft bu­ilt from gre­at logs las­hed to­get­her with sto­ut ro­pes. It was equ­ip­ped with a stubby mast and a bro­ad squ­are sa­il, which ca­ught the wind-blast and sent the big craft char­ging and cras­hing thro­ugh mo­un­ta­ino­us wa­ves. The­re was a tiny ca­bin, lit­tle mo­re than an open box, in which Ani­gel cro­uc­hed qu­ite calmly, drenc­hed to the skin, her ta­lis­man co­ro­net clam­ped on her he­ad. Cru­de ra­ilings we­re fi­xed aro­und the pe­ri­me­ter of the raft, and many knot­ted ro­pes fas­te­ned to the­se and to the mast ga­ve hand-holds to the nu­me­ro­us pas­sen­gers. So­me of them we­re pro­ne and bed­rag­gled hu­mans, whi­le ot­hers we­re Od­dlings of a pe­cu­li­ar and for­mi­dab­le ap­pe­aran­ce, tall in sta­tu­re, who ac­tu­al­ly se­emed to be enj­oying the­ir wild ri­de.</p>
   <p>    Haramis was ca­re­ful to say not­hing un­til the mir­ror went de­ad, alt­ho­ugh her mind te­emed with qu­es­ti­ons. It was cle­ar from the maps that both of her sis­ters we­re en ro­ute to the Ci­ta­del, and both had fo­und and we­re using the­ir ta­lis­mans. Had the Whi­te Lady gi­ven them spe­ci­al inst­ruc­ti­ons, or we­re they ac­ting on the­ir own? Co­uld they pos­sibly be in­ten­ding to at­tack King Volt­rik's he­avily ar­med tro­ops with the­ir mobs of abo­ri­gi­nes? Did the­ir ta­lis­mans ma­ke them think such a lu­na­tic co­ur­se of ac­ti­on might <emphasis>suc­ce­ed</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    It al­most se­emed that Oro­gas­tus co­uld re­ad her mind. "Yo­ur sis­ters," he sa­id, af­ter the ice-mir­ror had win­ked out, "ha­ve both used the­ir ta­lis­mans to kill."</p>
   <p>    Dumb with shock, Ha­ra­mis co­uld only sta­re at him. He led her from the mir­ror-cham­ber thro­ugh the ca­vern and out in­to the tun­nel that led back to his to­wer.</p>
   <p>    "Kadiya and Ani­gel mis­ta­kenly think that they will be ab­le to li­be­ra­te Ru­wen­da using the ta­lis­mans as ma­gi­cal we­apons-with help from the­ir Od­dling fri­ends and from Prin­ce An­tar, who has de­no­un­ced his fat­her and pled­ged him­self to the ca­use of Prin­cess Ani­gel. She sa­ved his li­fe back in the Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest, and he is now ho­pe­les­sly smit­ten with her. Of co­ur­se, ne­it­her of yo­ur sis­ters has the fa­in­test chan­ce of suc­cess aga­inst Volt­rik. They do not yet fully un­ders­tand the wor­kings of the­ir ta­lis­mans nor the­ir li­mi­ta­ti­ons. They un­do­ub­tedly think they ha­ve only to wa­ve the­ir ta­lis­mans at the Ci­ta­del, and all the­ir ene­mi­es will fall down de­ad… But this will not oc­cur. Volt­rik is pro­tec­ted by my own strong ma­gic, un­der the com­mand of my Gre­en Vo­ice."</p>
   <p>    "Oh, the silly fo­ols!" gro­aned Ha­ra­mis. "I can­not be­li­eve that the Arc­hi­ma­ge has or­de­red them to at­tack the Ci­ta­del. They are do­ing this on the­ir own!"</p>
   <p>    "The ta­lis­mans that Ka­di­ya and Ani­gel hold we­re not in­ten­ded to be used alo­ne. My re­se­arc­hes ha­ve ma­de this very cle­ar. The Va­nis­hed Ones used the three de­vi­ces as one, in a gre­at Scept­re of Po­wer, to es­tab­lish so­me myste­ri­o­us gre­at ba­lan­ce of the world. It is yo­ur duty, Ha­ra­mis, to bring to­get­her on­ce aga­in the Three in One. Wi­el­ding it, you alo­ne can ru­le over a world re­born in­to pe­ace and pros­pe­rity."</p>
   <p>    "I? Ru­le the world?" She la­ug­hed. Her mind had fro­zen at his words, re­j­ec­ting them even as he spo­ke. She as­ked her­self what might be the gre­at sche­me that the Whi­te Lady had held back and was now pre­pa­red to re­ve­al. I <emphasis>shall go to the Arc­hi­ma­ge as so­on as I can</emphasis>, she de­ci­ded.</p>
   <p>    As they hur­ri­ed along, she glan­ced si­de­long at Oro­gas­tus thro­ugh the eye­ho­les of the sil­ver mask, and saw that his mo­uth was tight-lip­ped. He had not spo­ken fri­vo­lo­usly. He be­li­eved what he had told her, and she had best ta­ke it se­ri­o­usly. She wo­uld ha­ve to go to the Arc­hi­ma­ge at on­ce and de­mand an exp­la­na­ti­on of this Scept­re of Po­wer. But what of her sis­ters? If he did not know al­re­ady, Volt­rik wo­uld so­on le­arn from the sor­ce­rer of the­ir ad­van­ce upon the Ci­ta­del. He wo­uld send his army - and do­ubt­less the Gre­en Vo­ice al­so - to me­et them.</p>
   <p>    "Orogastus," she as­ked, "co­uld you ke­ep Volt­rik from sen­ding tro­ops af­ter my po­or sis­ters? Let <emphasis>me</emphasis> con­vin­ce the two of them to turn away!"</p>
   <p>    "If they withd­raw at on­ce in­to the depths of the swamp, they will be in no im­me­di­ate dan­ger. Volt­rik's sol­di­ers wo­uld be hard-pres­sed to fight an of­fen­si­ve war or even mo­unt an ef­fec­ti­ve pur­su­it du­ring the ra­iny se­ason. But do you think yo­ur sis­ters will lis­ten to you?"</p>
   <p>    "They al­ways did be­fo­re. But now, ha­ving the­ir ta­lis­mans…" Ha­ra­mis's vo­ice tra­iled away in­to si­lent an­xi­ety.</p>
   <p>    "I can or­der my Gre­en Vo­ice not to smi­te yo­ur sis­ters with my light­nings, or ot­her oc­cult we­aponry. But the­re is no way that I can stop King Volt­rik from de­aling with them or the­ir Od­dling rab­ble as he cho­oses. The­ir ta­lis­mans will not pro­tect them. If I we­re the­re at the Ci­ta­del, I might pre­va­il upon Volt­rik. From he­re, wor­king only thro­ugh my Vo­ice, I can­not."</p>
   <p>    They ca­me to the tun­nel's end and en­te­red the to­wer, whe­re wel­co­me he­at en­ve­lo­ped them. Ha­ra­mis stop­ped in­si­de the small fo­yer and to­ok Oro­gas­tus by the hands.</p>
   <p>    "There is yet ti­me. For both of us, and for my sis­ters. I do not know what plans you now ha­ve. I do not <emphasis>want</emphasis> to know, un­til I ha­ve fi­nal­ly ma­de up my mind abo­ut us. But - if I fly at on­ce to the Arc­hi­ma­ge and then de­ci­de, will you me­et me at the Ci­ta­del to re­ce­ive my ans­wer? And whi­le you are wa­iting for me, will you pre­vent Volt­rik from sen­ding his army out aga­inst Ani­gel and Ka­di­ya? I can ma­ke them turn back! I know I can! But I must first le­arn the in­ten­ti­ons of the Arc­hi­ma­ge-"</p>
   <p>    "Let <emphasis>me</emphasis> gu­ide you! I al­re­ady ha­ve a plan - "</p>
   <p>    "No!" She to­ok off the star-mask, and sto­od the­re pa­le and tremb­ling, and she was un­ben­ding this ti­me as he emb­ra­ced her and kis­sed the top of her he­ad.</p>
   <p>    "My de­arest one, you will do as you must do," he told her. "But the­re is one se­ri­o­us flaw in yo­ur stra­tegy. I ha­ve no way to go qu­ickly to the Ci­ta­del. Un­li­ke you, I can­not com­mand the lam­mer­ge­i­ers."</p>
   <p>    "I will ask Hi­lu­ro to sum­mon one of his fel­lows to carry you the­re."</p>
   <p>    His hands tigh­te­ned abo­ut her. "You wo­uld do this? Trust me so far?"</p>
   <p>    The fa­ce she lif­ted to him was wet with te­ars. "You are a man who has long gu­ar­ded his sec­ret he­art. Per­haps you ha­ve bu­ilt such strong ram­parts abo­ut it that you are no lon­ger su­re what li­es wit­hin… I think that you are not cer­ta­in which way to ta­ke. Li­ke me, you will ha­ve to ma­ke a cho­ice."</p>
   <p>    "Yes," he ad­mit­ted. His arms fell away, and he did not me­et her eyes.</p>
   <p>    "The lam­mer­ge­i­er will co­me for you," she sa­id. "We will me­et at the Ci­ta­del, just be­fo­re the Fe­ast of the Three Mo­ons. Ex­pect me."</p>
   <p>    And then she was go­ne, le­aving him stan­ding alo­ne, and her sil­ver star-mask lay on the flo­or lo­oking up at him with empty eyes.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    When the wild vo­ya­ge of the log rafts up La­ke Wum en­ded la­te on the sa­me day that it had be­gun, the Wyvi­lo ste­ered the fle­et of un­ga­inly craft in­to the Gre­en­mi­re fo­rest is­lands of the Lo­wer Mu­tar del­ta, still un­der co­ver of the storm.</p>
   <p>    There the Nysso­mu met them with a hund­red punts, and gre­eted Prin­cess Ani­gel with much de­fe­ren­ce. The lit­tle swamp Folk fer­ri­ed her and the knights and the Wyvi­lo war­ri­ors via sec­ret back­wa­ters to a lar­ge hum­mock unk­nown to hu­mans. This pla­ce, which wo­uld be­co­me the sta­ging area for Ani­gel's army, was lo­ca­ted a few le­agu­es away from a ma­nor on the Ri­ver Skro­kar that had be­lon­ged to the la­te Lord Ma­no­pa­ro of the Oat­hed Com­pa­ni­ons. The cast­le of the ma­nor had be­en se­ized and oc­cu­pi­ed by La­bor­no­ki tro­ops; but the out­bu­il­dings and do­wer ho­use still shel­te­red Ma­no­pa­ro's lar­ge fa­mily and most of his ser­vants and do­mes­tic re­ta­iners.</p>
   <p>    The mist­ress of the ma­nor, Lady El­li­nis, had be­en ad­vi­sed by the lo­cal Nysso­mu of Ani­gel's co­ming. The Lady was bro­ught out to the iso­la­ted hum­mock long af­ter night­fall, and she gre­eted the Prin­cess with te­ars and gu­ar­ded ent­hu­si­asm.</p>
   <p>    Lady El­li­nis was a grey-ha­ired da­me who­se fi­ne fa­ce was now de­eply li­ned with be­re­ave­ment. In ad­di­ti­on to her hus­band, two of her sons had al­so pe­ris­hed in the fu­ti­le de­fen­se of the Ci­ta­del. She sat with Ani­gel in­si­de a shel­ter that the Wyvi­lo had set up in a drip­ping gro­ve of gon­das, and the two of them dis­cus­sed the Prin­cess's plan for be­si­eging the Ci­ta­del to­get­her with her sis­ter Ka­di­ya and the lat­ter's for­ce of Uis­gu.</p>
   <p>    "That you wo­uld da­re such a thing so so­on af­ter the con­qu­est ama­zes me," El­li­nis sa­id. "And per­haps it is true that Volt­rik's for­ces are not yet comp­le­tely ent­renc­hed, and his army is di­vi­ded, and they are on un­fa­mi­li­ar gro­und with the ra­iny se­ason upon them. But still -! You two girls are so yo­ung! Ut­terly inex­pe­ri­en­ced in war­fa­re! And even if our scat­te­red nob­les and fre­ehol­ders rally to you as you ho­pe, yo­ur army is yet com­po­sed mostly of Od­dlings. My dar­ling Prin­cess Ani­gel, I wish not­hing mo­re in the world than yo­ur suc­cess. But the La­bor­no­ki are har­de­ned figh­ting men, and the odds are gre­atly aga­inst you."</p>
   <p>    Anigel only to­uc­hed her co­ro­net, whe­re the tril­li­um am­ber glo­wed. "I know not why I am con­vin­ced that vic­tory will be ours, but I am. Per­haps this ta­lis­man is the thing that gi­ves me the con­fi­den­ce to at­tempt such an auda­ci­o­us en­de­avor. All I can tell you, de­ar El­li­nis, is that I felt im­pel­led to co­me he­re now, with the Three Mo­ons con­ver­ging, and en­ga­ge the La­bor­no­ki who hold the Ci­ta­del. My sis­ter Ka­di­ya is of li­ke mind."</p>
   <p>    Lady El­li­nis drew her he­avy clo­ak mo­re clo­sely abo­ut her. A small bra­zi­er bur­ned in the shel­ter and on it Ani­gel was bre­wing dar­ci tea aga­inst the pe­net­ra­ting damp­ness. El­li­nis sa­id: "I was as­to­un­ded when a Nysso­mu ca­me sec­retly to me and in­for­med me that you we­re sa­iling up La­ke Wum. Of co­ur­se, the Od­dlings can bes­pe­ak each ot­her wit­ho­ut words, and I sup­po­se they will ha­ve pas­sed the news all over the Mazy Mi­re by now…"</p>
   <p>    "To all the Folk-yes," Ani­gel ag­re­ed so­lemnly. "My Wyvi­lo al­li­es ha­ve ne­ver, up un­til now, had much de­alings with the­ir Nysso­mu or Uis­gu co­usins. But the con­qu­est of our co­untry by La­bor­nok was a di­sas­ter not only to Ru­wen­di­an hu­mans, but al­so to the abo­ri­gi­nes who dwell among us. And so the Wyvi­lo ha­ve put asi­de the­ir an­ci­ent cus­toms, and even the pe­ace­ab­le Nysso­mu are wil­ling to jo­in us and do what they can."</p>
   <p>    Outside, whe­re the ra­in had stop­ped and night-mists now hung thick, the Wyvi­lo we­re bu­sily const­ruc­ting mo­re brush-and-bam­boo shel­ters for them­sel­ves and for ot­hers who we­re ex­pec­ted to ar­ri­ve at the hum­mock la­ter. Li­ke all Folk, they co­uld see re­adily in the dark and went abo­ut the­ir work as ef­fi­ci­ently as tho­ugh it we­re bro­ad day­light.</p>
   <p>    Catching sight of a tall Wyvi­lo axe­man, Lady El­li­nis shi­ve­red. "I ha­ve ne­ver se­en Tas­sa­le­yo Fo­rest Od­dlings be­fo­re, and I con­fess that the­ir mi­en is rat­her frigh­te­ning. They are not as dre­ad­ful-lo­oking as the Skri­tek, of co­ur­se, and they se­em fa­irly ci­vi­li­zed. Ne­vert­he­less, I won­der that you are ab­le to put such trust in them."</p>
   <p>    Anigel smi­led. "The­ir fa­ces are ter­rif­ying, but at he­art they are nob­le and re­ve­re the Black Tril­li­um just as the­ir smal­ler kin do. Thanks to the Wyvi­lo, we we­re ab­le to send word via the Nysso­mu to the scat­te­red bands of free Ru­wen­di­ans, who are has­te­ning he­re from all di­rec­ti­ons to jo­in my army."</p>
   <p>    "My own pe­op­le and my three sur­vi­ving sons are yo­urs to com­mand," El­li­nis sa­id, "and you are wel­co­me to what sto­res of fo­od we we­re ab­le to hi­de from the enemy. But the­re are at le­ast fi­ve hund­red Od­dlings he­re al­re­ady, and you say that you ex­pect three or fo­ur ti­mes that num­ber of hu­mans and Nysso­mu to gat­her he­re wit­hin the next two days. I fe­ar that we will not ha­ve vic­tu­als eno­ugh to fe­ed such a throng for mo­re than a few days."</p>
   <p>    "We will not be he­re for very long. If we are not vic­to­ri­o­us du­ring the Fe­ast of the Three Mo­ons, we will ha­ve to withd­raw," Ani­gel con­fes­sed. "But we <emphasis>will</emphasis> win out. I know it!"</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess was on her fe­et, stern-fa­ced and still dres­sed in the blue hun­ting kit that the Wyvi­lo had gi­ven her. Lady El­li­nis mar­ve­led at how gre­atly the girl had chan­ged from the gig­gling lit­tle per­son she had se­en at a ro­yal ball scar­cely fi­ve we­eks ear­li­er, be­fo­re the in­va­si­on. That Ani­gel had be­en a shy or­na­men­tal with hardly a tho­ught in her pretty he­ad that did not in­vol­ve co­urt gos­sip or the la­test fas­hi­ons. This new yo­ung wo­man was frigh­te­ning in her de­di­ca­ti­on, and El­li­nis hardly knew what to ma­ke of her. But the Prin­cess po­ured tea for her gu­est wit­ho­ut a tra­ce of her old fligh­ti­ness, as gra­ci­o­us and con­fi­dent as tho­ugh the so­oty crock we­re a sil­ver pot, and the damp and drafty shel­ter the Qu­e­en's so­lar in the Ci­ta­del. Gra­du­al­ly El­li­nis lost her mis­gi­vings and be­gan to think that the im­pos­sib­le ven­tu­re might not be ut­terly ho­pe­less af­ter all.</p>
   <p>    "This Prin­ce An­tar." The ol­der wo­man lo­we­red her vo­ice to a whis­per. "It was cle­ar to me when you int­ro­du­ced us that the yo­ung man is de­eply in lo­ve with you. Ne­vert­he­less, I fe­el it is my duty to ca­uti­on you abo­ut pla­cing too much re­li­an­ce upon him."</p>
   <p>    Anigel nod­ded and sat down aga­in, her fa­ce wit­ho­ut exp­res­si­on. "He has pled­ged fe­alty to me, and so ha­ve most of his men. But the­re are three of his knights who with­held the­ir troth, and the­se the ot­hers watch clo­sely and exc­lu­de from our co­un­cils of war."</p>
   <p>    "But An­tar and his knights are La­bor­no­ki, af­ter all!"</p>
   <p>    "Dear El­li­nis, I am no lon­ger as simp­le and gul­lib­le as I on­ce was, and it is true that Prin­ce An­tar must still pro­ve his lo­yalty to me. You say he lo­ves me and this may al­so be true. But I ha­ve only a fond res­pect for him, and even that is yet wary."</p>
   <p>    "Good!" sa­id El­li­nis stur­dily.</p>
   <p>    "But I must trust An­tar in so­me mat­ters, sin­ce I know not­hing of figh­ting. If we are to suc­ce­ed, we will do so un­der his ge­ne­rals­hip. I know not what li­es de­ep in his he­art, but I am con­vin­ced that he is a go­od man, and one who dep­lo­res the cru­elty of his fat­her, King Volt­rik. He has told me that the­re are many ot­hers among his pe­op­le who fe­el as he do­es, and it may be that we will, thro­ugh him, di­vi­de our foe's lo­yalty."</p>
   <p>    "I shall pray that you are right."</p>
   <p>    They spo­ke for a whi­le lon­ger, and then it was ti­me for El­li­nis to go. The Lady kis­sed Ani­gel, which the Prin­cess qu­ite ex­pec­ted; but Ani­gel was qu­ite ta­ken aback when El­li­nis al­so bo­wed de­eply to her be­fo­re go­ing away with her ser­vant and her Nysso­mu gu­ide.</p>
   <p>    To An­tar, who had co­me in when El­li­nis was ta­king her le­ave, the Prin­cess re­mar­ked: "She ne­ver sho­wed me such de­fe­ren­ce be­fo­re. In fact, be­ing a wo­man of se­ri­o­us bent, she ra­rely pa­id much at­ten­ti­on to me at all!"</p>
   <p>    "The mo­re fo­ol she," sa­id the Prin­ce, smi­ling. "But I ha­ve co­me to tell you that our camp is gro­wing apa­ce, and the­re is now ade­qu­ate shel­ter sho­uld the ra­in com­men­ce aga­in." His fa­ce so­be­red. "The Wyvi­lo war-chi­ef Lum­mo­mu-Ko fe­els that the Nysso­mu, even tho­ugh wil­ling, will ma­ke po­or war­ri­ors. They are so small, and the only we­apon most of them can use with fa­ci­lity is the blow­gun. In a fron­tal as­sa­ult, they wo­uld be use­less. We can only uti­li­ze them in skir­mis­hes and ir­re­gu­lar ac­ti­ons."</p>
   <p>    "Then plan to do so," Ani­gel sa­id se­re­nely. "Do you ha­ve any es­ti­ma­tes on the num­ber of hu­mans who might fol­low us?"</p>
   <p>    "With luck, se­ven or eight hund­red free Ru­wen­di­ans might be ab­le to jo­in us he­re or re­ach the ri­ver be­low the Ci­ta­del by the Fe­ast of the Three Mo­ons. The­se will be mostly knights and sol­di­ers who es­ca­ped in­to the Mi­re when the Ci­ta­del fell, to­get­her with so­me lords and men-at-arms from outl­ying ma­nors so­uth of he­re who ne­ver en­ga­ged us - I me­an, ne­ver en­ga­ged yo­ur ene­mi­es - du­ring the la­te in­va­si­on."</p>
   <p>    "Very go­od. Now if only the Co­unt of Goyk and the ot­her free lords of the far Dylex can ar­ri­ve in ti­me - " She bro­ke off, sud­denly tur­ning away, her fa­ce dar­ke­ned with chag­rin.</p>
   <p>    Antar, who had ne­ver he­ard of the Co­unt of Goyk and knew not­hing of that worthy's pla­ce in Ani­gel's plan, at that mo­ment re­ali­zed that she still fe­ared to con­fi­de in him comp­le­tely. He drop­ped slowly to his kne­es.</p>
   <p>    "My Lady, if you com­mand me, I shall say not­hing of this Co­unt to my lo­yal com­pa­ni­ons. I be­se­ech you to ha­ve fa­ith in us - but if you can­not, per­haps it wo­uld be best if you pla­ced me and my knights un­der ar­rest. Then you wo­uld be fre­ed of any an­xi­eti­es our pre­sen­ce might en­gen­der."</p>
   <p>    "I do trust <emphasis>you</emphasis>," Ani­gel sa­id un­hap­pily, "and most of yo­ur knights as well. It is Sir Ri­nu­tar and his cro­ni­es Tu­rat and On­bo­gar whom I fe­el might bet­ray us. I know they ha­ve pled­ged a tru­ce, but I fe­ar it was a gra­ve mis­ta­ke to bring them he­re to this sec­ret camp. We sho­uld ha­ve left them on the la­kes­ho­re, as Lum­mo­mu-Ko ad­vi­sed."</p>
   <p>    The Prin­ce bo­wed his he­ad. "Per­haps. But ma­ro­oned in the midst of the storm, in a swamp full of unk­nown pe­rils… they wo­uld su­rely ha­ve pe­ris­hed be­fo­re fin­ding the­ir way to a La­bor­no­ki gar­ri­son. As you yo­ur­self ag­re­ed."</p>
   <p>    "I wo­uld not ha­ve them die! But ne­it­her can I let them bet­ray us to King Volt­rik."</p>
   <p>    Kneeling yet, he to­ok hold of her hand. It was icy cold. "Be of go­od che­er. The three wo­uld be lost in mi­nu­tes if they at­temp­ted to le­ave this hum­mock and ran­ge out in­to the Mi­re, and the­re is no one he­re who wo­uld aid them to es­ca­pe. My fif­te­en true com­pa­ni­ons and I will see to them. Ha­ve no fe­ar."</p>
   <p>    She sig­hed and tur­ned her eyes back to him. "I sup­po­se you are right. I am ta­ut-drawn as a bowst­ring, an­xi­o­us abo­ut what will be­fall us in the next three days. The Co­unt of Goyk that I inad­ver­tently spo­ke of-he holds the most dis­tant fi­ef­dom of Ru­wen­da, far to the nort­he­ast of the Dylex, in the fo­ot­hil­ls of the Oho­gans. Ne­it­her he nor the Co­unt of Prok nor the ot­her lords of the eas­tern ma­nors we­re ever sub­du­ed by you La­bor­no­ki."</p>
   <p>    "I know. It was to be our first pri­ority af­ter the Win­ter Ra­ins. To pa­cify that co­untry and al­so the so­uth."</p>
   <p>    "When the Wyvi­lo ag­re­ed to help me, I as­ked them if they wo­uld use the­ir spe­ech wit­ho­ut words to dis­co­ver what hu­mans we­re un­con­qu­ered. Thro­ugh the Nysso­mu I then ma­de con­tact with tho­se who fled the Ci­ta­del, and al­so cer­ta­in nob­les of the gar­ri­so­ned ma­nors, such as Lady El­li­nis, and a few free ma­nors of the so­uth. This you al­re­ady know. But my Wyvi­lo fri­ends al­so bes­po­ke the Vis­pi, the abo­ri­gi­nes of the high mo­un­ta­ins. And the Vis­pi told us of the co­un­ti­es of Goyk and Prok be­ing yet free."</p>
   <p>    He nod­ded. "I see. And then of co­ur­se the mo­un­ta­in Od­dlings cal­led upon tho­se lords to co­me to yo­ur aid."</p>
   <p>    "The Co­unt of Goyk is a hard­he­aded man, and he is al­so my Gre­at-uncle Pa­lun­do. At first he wo­uld not be­li­eve what in­hu­man Folk told him - that my sis­ter Ka­di­ya and I we­re re­ady to at­tack the Ci­ta­del. But I myself bes­po­ke the Vis­pi, im­par­ting to them cer­ta­in ho­mely sec­rets that only mem­bers of the ro­yal fa­mily know, and at last Unc­le Pa­lun­do was con­vin­ced. When we and the Wyvi­lo qu­it the vil­la­ge of Let, two tho­usand ar­med knights and men from both Goyk and Prok set off from the­ir re­mo­te enc­la­ves in fast ri­ver­bo­ats. They had a long way to co­me - but the wa­ter­ways are al­re­ady in flo­od and yes­ter­day they sa­fely skir­ted the cast­le of Bo­nor, abo­ut sixty le­agu­es west of he­re. If all go­es well, they will ar­ri­ve in ti­me to help us."</p>
   <p>    Antar's eyes we­re shi­ning. "Bet­ter and bet­ter! Oh, my Lady, I can­not tell you how you ha­ve lif­ted my he­art! No lon­ger do­es our po­si­ti­on se­em so for­lorn. We are still out­num­be­red, but at le­ast we will ha­ve gre­ater num­bers of ex­pe­ri­en­ced hu­man figh­ters on our si­de!" And he kis­sed her hand in a trans­port of joy.</p>
   <p>    Anigel stif­fe­ned. Then, se­e­ing his dis­may, she smi­led upon him.</p>
   <p>    "Is my to­uch then so re­pul­si­ve?" he as­ked sadly.</p>
   <p>    "No. By no me­ans. I was only - surp­ri­sed. The­re are so many things on my mind, you see."</p>
   <p>    She lo­oked so small and be­mu­sed, this yo­ung wo­man crow­ned with ma­gic, perc­hed un­com­for­tably on a mossy rock with her fa­ce lit only by the bra­zi­er, that his he­art was ig­ni­ted from pity and lo­ve and he ro­se to his fe­et and tur­ned away so that she sho­uld not see the te­ars that had sprung to his eyes.</p>
   <p>    "Yes, my Lady. You ha­ve much to think on. Too much for a per­son of such ten­der ye­ars and gre­at sen­si­ti­vity-"</p>
   <p>    "I'll ma­na­ge," Ani­gel sa­id, rat­her briskly.</p>
   <p>    He tur­ned back to her. "Now I ha­ve of­fen­ded you. I apo­lo­gi­ze most humbly."</p>
   <p>    "And I ac­cept." For an ins­tant, the­ir eyes met. Then she lo­oked away and se­emed abst­rac­ted aga­in, and the rap­port that had se­emed to spring mo­men­ta­rily to li­fe di­ed abor­ning.</p>
   <p>    Had he re­al­ly se­en it? Or was it only wish­ful thin­king? He wo­uld ha­ve cri­ed out to her that very mi­nu­te, pro­fes­sing his ado­ra­ti­on - but she had her eyes blindly fi­xed on one wall of the tent and se­emed lost in a dre­am, one fin­ger lif­ted to her sil­very co­ro­net.</p>
   <p>    "I bid you go­od­night, then," he sa­id.</p>
   <p>    But Ani­gel did not reply. She was lis­te­ning to a vi­si­on of her sis­ter Ka­di­ya that had just sprung in­to her mind.</p>
   <p>    "Haramis sa­id <emphasis>what</emphasis>?"</p>
   <p>    "Ani, she told me to turn back. Or­de­red me! As tho­ugh I we­re still a na­ughty child re­fu­sing to co­me in from pla­ying in the stab­les!"</p>
   <p>    "Did she gi­ve a re­ason?"</p>
   <p>    "She is af­ra­id that Volt­rik knows we are on our way, and that he will send tro­ops out to en­ga­ge us. But that's ri­di­cu­lo­us! The Nysso­mu wo­uld know at on­ce if any lar­ge body of La­bor­no­ki left the Ci­ta­del. They wo­uld gi­ve war­ning, and we co­uld easily hi­de away in the slo­ughs and back­wa­ters of the Mi­re whe­re no flat­lan­der wo­uld ha­ve a ho­pe of catc­hing us. Of co­ur­se I told her that. But she got all in a swi­vel, and star­ted swe­aring upon her amu­let and ta­lis­man that I was flo­ating to my do­om and su­re to ru­in so­me gre­at sche­me. When I as­ked if the sche­me was hers or one of Oro­gas­tus, she be­ca­me all huffy."</p>
   <p>    "Can she ha­ve fal­len un­der his dark spell, Ka­di?"</p>
   <p>    "Who can say… Has she bes­po­ken you with the sa­me li­ne of tosh?"</p>
   <p>    "Nay. But I ha­ve be­en so busy and dist­rac­ted this day that I scar­ce had ti­me to draw a qu­i­et bre­ath."</p>
   <p>    "If she do­es try to bes­pe­ak you -don't ans­wer!"</p>
   <p>    "Kadi!"</p>
   <p>    "I me­an what I say. And tell Ha­ra not­hing mo­re of our plans. She has go­ne to the Arc­hi­ma­ge at last, sup­po­sedly to he­ar the Whi­te Lady's ver­si­on of our des­tiny and the pur­po­se of our ta­lis­mans. Per­haps our lo­ve-sick sis­ter will re­co­ver her wits in Noth. But I shall not co­unt on it. Bes­pe­ak her not aga­in. She must know not­hing of our plans un­til we all three me­et in per­son and ha­ve this out."</p>
   <p>    "Well… I sup­po­se that is the sen­sib­le thing."</p>
   <p>    "She al­so told me that the sor­ce­rer will ar­ri­ve at the Ci­ta­del to­mor­row."</p>
   <p>    "What -? But he was the­re with Ka­ra, in the mo­un­ta­ins!"</p>
   <p>    "She is len­ding him one of her ma­gic birds as a ste­ed. When I re­monst­ra­ted with her - ac­tu­al­ly, I cal­led her a be­sot­ted muck-for-bra­ins - she in­sis­ted she was ac­ting in our best in­te­rests."</p>
   <p>    "Now we shall ha­ve his enc­hant­ment to con­tend aga­inst, as well as the ar­med might of La­bor­nok! Oh, Ka­di…"</p>
   <p>    "Now, don't lo­se he­art. Ka­ra se­ems to be­li­eve that Oro­gas­tus has very lit­tle re­al ma­gic at all. Ac­cor­ding to her, his tha­uma­turgy may be ba­sed upon not­hing mo­re nor less than so­me fa­bu­lo­us mac­hi­nery of the Va­nis­hed Ones! The bolts of light­ning, the go­uts of fla­me and ha­il of ste­el pel­lets that dest­ro­yed the hill-forts, the ear-burs­ting hor­ror that aff­lic­ted the Dylex towns­hips, even the pa­nic that se­ized the war-fro­ni­als of our knights -all so­me sort of mec­ha­ni­cal tric­kery and not re­al ma­gic at all!… If Ha­ra is tel­ling true."</p>
   <p>    "Kadi, I just don't un­ders­tand this. The­re <emphasis>must</emphasis> be ma­gic! Our Black Tril­li­ums… our ta­lis­mans… the Arc­hi­ma­ge her­self! Ma­gic per­va­des the en­ti­re world!"</p>
   <p>    "Never mind, Ani. The only im­por­tant thing to re­mem­ber is that our sis­ter must not be al­lo­wed to stop us. So gi­ve no he­ed to her lu­na­tic ad­mo­ni­ti­ons. I am still well ahe­ad of Osor­kon and his army, I ha­ve mo­re than three tho­usand Uis­gu fol­lo­wing me, and I ha­ve wor­ked out a plan for pe­net­ra­ting the Ci­ta­del and avo­iding a pitc­hed bat­tle out­si­de on the Knoll, whe­re we wo­uld su­rely be cut down by Volt­rik's ca­valry."</p>
   <p>    "Oh! Tell me!"</p>
   <p>    "And ha­ve you blab it to that wit­ling An­tar? Nay! You'll le­arn of it when our ar­mi­es me­et on the Eve of Three Mo­ons."</p>
   <p>    "You mi­sj­ud­ge me, and al­so An­tar-"</p>
   <p>    "I ho­pe so. And I ho­pe I mi­sj­ud­ge our sis­ter as well! Me­anw­hi­le, ta­ke gre­at ca­re and me­et me in this pla­ce that I show you… When we con­fer, we will ar­ran­ge for King Volt­rik and Oro­gas­tus to jo­in us at a very spe­ci­al ce­leb­ra­ti­on of the Mo­on Fe­ast!"</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Day was daw­ning ra­pidly when Hi­lu­ro be­gan his des­cent to­ward Noth. Ha­ra­mis had cri­ed her­self to sle­ep, then dre­amed a con­ver­sa­ti­on with a scan­da­li­zed Ka­di­ya, exp­res­sing di­sap­pro­val of her de­alings with Oro­gas­tus. No do­ubt Ka­di­ya wo­uld ha­ve tri­ed to stab him and be­en struck down with light­ning for her pa­ins - how da­re she call Ha­ra­mis's con­duct reck­less! Now Ha­ra­mis felt hor­ribly ble­ary-eyed as the gro­wing light wo­ke her. She was stiff in every musc­le, but her po­si­ti­on on the bird's back did not en­co­ura­ge much mo­ve­ment, so she lo­oked for­ward to lan­ding.</p>
   <p>    As the bird circ­led over the small sto­ne to­wer whe­re the Arc­hi­ma­ge li­ved, Ha­ra­mis lo­oked down in be­wil­der­ment. The last ti­me she had se­en the pla­ce it had be­en co­ve­red in gre­enery and sur­ro­un­ded by a lawn dot­ted with wildf­lo­wers. Now only a few ske­le­tal branc­hes clung to the to­wer, and what re­ma­ined of the lawn was brown and scat­te­red with spiky we­eds. The mo­at was low, and the lit­tle wa­ter that re­ma­ined in it was co­ve­red with a fo­ul-smel­ling scum.</p>
   <p>    "What has hap­pe­ned he­re?" Ha­ra­mis as­ked alo­ud. Hi­lu­ro twitc­hed, and for a mo­ment she tho­ught he was abo­ut to ans­wer her, but he re­ma­ined si­lent.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Could King Volt­rik's sol­di­ers ha­ve co­me this far</emphasis>? she won­de­red. <emphasis>No, the­re wo­uld be a dif­fe­rent kind of dest­ruc­ti­on if they had. They wo­uld ha­ve bur­ned and torn down, but this lo­oks as tho­ugh everyt­hing simply did. But the­re is no na­tu­ral re­ason for everyt­hing to dry up li­ke this, not at this ti­me of ye­ar</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    She tho­ught of the gre­at num­ber of gar­de­ners for­merly emp­lo­yed at the Ci­ta­del. Per­haps with the Arc­hi­ma­ge dying, her few ser­vants - and Ha­ra­mis had he­ard her men­ti­on only one, her ste­ward - hadn't had ti­me to ta­ke ca­re of the plants. <emphasis>But even so, it wo­uldn't lo­ok li­ke this</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    The lam­mer­ge­i­er lan­ded at the end of the drawb­rid­ge, and Ha­ra­mis clim­bed off his back, her mind busy spe­cu­la­ting on what she might find wit­hin. Was the Arc­hi­ma­ge al­re­ady de­ad? <emphasis>She was still strong eno­ugh to spe­ak to me last night</emphasis>, Ha­ra­mis tho­ught.</p>
   <p>    A fe­eling of ur­gency pos­ses­sed her, and she hur­ri­ed ac­ross the drawb­rid­ge, along a mo­sa­ic flo­or al­most co­ve­red with de­ad moss, past the now dry fo­un­ta­in, and ac­ross the gar­den, now bar­ren gro­und with de­ad flo­wers strewn abo­ut, the­ir ro­ots still clin­ging to the earth which no lon­ger no­uris­hed them. When she ca­me to the black wo­oden do­or which led to the Arc­hi­ma­ge's cham­ber she was not surp­ri­sed to find it stan­ding aj­ar.</p>
   <p>    The ro­om was stif­ling hot, and an Od­dling - a Nysso­mu she had ne­ver se­en be­fo­re - cro­uc­hed by the fi­re ad­ding mo­re pe­at. He lo­oked up as her sha­dow, cast by the sun ri­sing be­hind her, fell ac­ross him. "Lady Ha­ra­mis," he sa­id. "Wel­co­me to Noth -she sa­id you wo­uld be he­re in ti­me." He nod­ded to­ward the bed.</p>
   <p>    "Greetings… You must be Da­ma­to­le," Ha­ra­mis sa­id. The Arc­hi­ma­ge had men­ti­oned his na­me only on­ce du­ring the­ir last me­eting, but Ha­ra­mis had be­en ta­ught all her li­fe to re­mem­ber the na­me, fa­ce, and sa­li­ent cha­rac­te­ris­tics of ever­yo­ne she met or he­ard of. Her pa­rents had con­si­de­red it an im­por­tant part of ro­yal tra­ining.</p>
   <p>    "Yes, my lady." The lit­tle ste­ward bo­wed to her. "It is my ho­nor to ser­ve the Lady Bi­nah - and you. She sle­eps now, but she sho­uld wa­ke so­on. Wo­uld you ca­re for so­me tea?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes," Ha­ra­mis sa­id gra­te­ful­ly, "I wo­uld in­de­ed. Thank you, Da­ma­to­le." The Od­dling hur­ri­ed from the ro­om, and Ha­ra­mis pic­ked up one of the pad­ded sto­ols and qu­i­etly mo­ved it to the si­de of the Arc­hi­ma­ge's bed. Sit­ting on it, she stu­di­ed the sle­eping wo­man.</p>
   <p>    Binah lo­oked even less well than she had in the scrying bowl, her flesh parc­hed and sin­king down abo­ut the bo­nes of her fa­ce. She wo­ke just as Da­ma­to­le ca­me in with the tea. "Ha­ra­mis," she sa­id slowly. "You ca­me."</p>
   <p>    "Of co­ur­se I ca­me," Ha­ra­mis sa­id. "You cal­led me. Be­si­des, I ne­ed mo­re in­for­ma­ti­on on how to use the ta­lis­mans. Un­for­tu­na­tely, fin­ding my Three-Win­ged Circ­le did not auto­ma­ti­cal­ly te­ach me how to use it.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus's lib­rary had so­me in­for­ma­ti­on on them - inc­lu­ding a bo­ok that sa­id the three of them sho­uld be jo­ined to­get­her to form a scept­re - "</p>
   <p>    "Not yet," the Arc­hi­ma­ge in­ter­rup­ted her. "You are not yet re­ady to cont­rol that po­wer. That re­qu­ires mo­re wis­dom than you ha­ve - much mo­re."</p>
   <p>    "Where am I sup­po­sed to le­arn this gre­at wis­dom? " Ha­ra­mis snap­ped im­pa­ti­ently. "Grub­bing aro­und in the swamp whi­le Volt­rik's army plun­ders my king­dom? Or am I to find it in my sis­ters-who use the­ir ta­lis­mans to kill?"</p>
   <p>    The Arc­hi­ma­ge lo­oked sor­row­ful. "They do not yet pos­sess wis­dom eit­her," she sig­hed, her vo­ice tra­iling off in­to si­len­ce. It was se­ve­ral mo­ments be­fo­re she spo­ke aga­in, and her qu­es­ti­on was un­wel­co­me. "Why did you stay so long with Oro­gas­tus?"</p>
   <p>    Haramis frow­ned, trying to find the right words to exp­la­in. "I was trying to le­arn what he was li­ke-you yo­ur­self bid me find out his we­ak­nes­ses. It's odd; he se­ems to think that the de­vi­ces of the Va­nis­hed Ones are ma­gi­cal - he ac­tu­al­ly sa­id as much! He was very up­set when I bro­ke one of them - he sa­id it was de­ad. But mac­hi­nes aren't ali­ve, are they?"</p>
   <p>    "No," the Lady rep­li­ed. "And do you think his de­vi­ces are ma­gi­cal?"</p>
   <p>    "No," Ha­ra­mis sa­id. "I can­not exp­la­in it pre­ci­sely, but they don't <emphasis>fe­el</emphasis> ma­gi­cal. But, ma­gic or mac­hi­ne, they gi­ve him po­wer, and that po­wer, wha­te­ver it is, can be used to do gre­at harm. And whi­le that po­wer exists, I want to know how it works!"</p>
   <p>    "So you went to Oro­gas­tus to le­arn the use of po­wer? Was that wi­se?"</p>
   <p>    "What is wi­se?" Ha­ra­mis re­tor­ted bit­terly. "You lie he­re in bed whi­le my ho­me is in­va­ded and my pa­rents hor­ribly mur­de­red and hund­reds of Vis­pi are sla­ugh­te­red be­ca­use you sum­mo­ned them too la­te aga­inst a foe they co­uld not withs­tand. Is that wis­dom? If so, what go­od is it?"</p>
   <p>    "I know that you are con­fu­sed and in pa­in, Ha­ra­mis," the Lady sa­id gently, "but you must le­arn to lo­ok be­yond the mo­ment and see the lar­ger pat­tern."</p>
   <p>    "That," Ha­ra­mis re­tor­ted, "is <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> what Oro­gas­tus sa­id. As if my pa­rents we­re not­hing, and the­ir de­aths didn't mat­ter…" She fo­und her­self crying aga­in, hurt and angry and be­reft. <emphasis>And now you'll die, too</emphasis>, she tho­ught des­pa­iringly, <emphasis>and I'll be alo­ne with my king­dom oc­cu­pi­ed by enemy sol­di­ers, my sis­ters who knows whe­re, and King Volt­rik trying to kill me and them. And I don't know what to do and no­body el­se se­ems to know eit­her</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    "I ha­ve watc­hed over Ru­wen­da for a long ti­me," Bi­nah sa­id softly, "far lon­ger than you re­ali­ze. I ha­ve lo­ved the land and its Folk and I ha­ve gu­ar­ded them and hel­ped them to grow as they sho­uld. It is a gre­at work, and the­re is much joy in it. But now my ti­me is en­ding, and yo­urs is be­gin­ning." She tur­ned her he­ad to me­et Ha­ra­mis's eyes. "You sa­id that Oro­gas­tus in­vi­ted you to co­me to him. Tell me, Ha­ra­mis, why did he in­vi­te you, and not yo­ur sis­ters?"</p>
   <p>    Haramis ga­zed back at her, start­led. "I don't know - I ne­ver tho­ught to ask that."</p>
   <p>    "And now that you know the qu­es­ti­on, what is the ans­wer?"</p>
   <p>    Haramis frow­ned, trying to re­mem­ber exactly how Oro­gas­tus had wor­ded his in­vi­ta­ti­on, as well as what he had as­ked of her whi­le she was with him. "I think he's lo­nely," she sa­id slowly. "He spo­ke of my re­pu­ta­ti­on for le­ar­ning and of his de­si­re to sha­re his know­led­ge with me… I think he's lo­oking for so­me­one el­se li­ke him, so­me­one el­se who can use ma­gic and think the way he do­es, so­me­one who can un­ders­tand what he talks abo­ut."</p>
   <p>    "And are you li­ke him?" the Arc­hi­ma­ge as­ked qu­i­etly.</p>
   <p>    "In so­me ways I am," Ha­ra­mis ad­mit­ted. "I don't want to blast an­yo­ne with light­ning, or in­va­de so­me­one el­se's land, or kill pe­op­le - but I can un­ders­tand the de­si­re to se­arch for know­led­ge, to try to ma­ke sen­se of the world…"</p>
   <p>    "… to see the pat­tern of li­fe aro­und you?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes," Ha­ra­mis sa­id, "exactly."</p>
   <p>    "And when you ha­ve this know­led­ge, what do you do with it?"</p>
   <p>    "What do you me­an?" Ha­ra­mis as­ked.</p>
   <p>    "Would you use know­led­ge to hurt and dest­roy, to ma­ni­pu­la­te and bend ot­hers to yo­ur will?"</p>
   <p>    "Of co­ur­se not!" Ha­ra­mis rep­li­ed in­dig­nantly. "That's wrong. Pe­op­le are sup­po­sed to be free to ma­ke the­ir own cho­ices, not used as pup­pets for the amu­se­ment of tho­se stron­ger or mo­re in­tel­li­gent than they are. But why sho­uld I ha­ve to <emphasis>do</emphasis> anyt­hing with know­led­ge? Why can't I simply study and le­arn and re­j­o­ice in the know­led­ge and vi­si­on I ac­hi­eve? Why sho­uld I ha­ve to use it?"</p>
   <p>    "Because you are what you are, and it shows. I can see it, Oro­gas­tus can see it, and any ot­her with a know­led­ge of ma­gic can see it." The Arc­hi­ma­ge's vo­ice grew in­ten­se. "Ha­ra­mis, you un­ders­tand words. Most pe­op­le ne­ver re­ali­ze that words are im­por­tant, that they mat­ter, that to say a thing is to gi­ve it at le­ast a sha­dow of exis­ten­ce - and to na­me it truly is to gi­ve it li­fe. You he­ar, you lis­ten, and you re­mem­ber, and that is a ra­re gift. Wit­ho­ut it, you wo­uld ne­ver un­ders­tand ma­gic, most of it wo­uld li­te­ral­ly be in­con­ce­ivab­le to you. Ka­di­ya pos­ses­ses gre­at ar­dor and de­ter­mi­na­ti­on, and Ani­gel has com­pas­si­on and a lo­ving he­art, but the­se gifts, whi­le they are gre­at in the­ir own right, are not what is re­qu­ired for the full use of ma­gic. Yo­ur pas­si­on is know­led­ge, Ha­ra­mis, and that, com­bi­ned with the ro­yal blo­od of Ru­wen­da, will ma­ke you a ma­gi­ci­an. If you try not to use yo­ur abi­li­ti­es, you - and they-will be used by pe­op­le li­ke Oro­gas­tus."</p>
   <p>    "Is that why I fe­el li­ke a pawn in so­me ga­me you and Oro­gas­tus are pla­ying?" Ha­ra­mis de­man­ded.</p>
   <p>    The Arc­hi­ma­ge's eyes bur­ned in her fa­ce, as if all the li­fe in the old wo­man we­re con­ta­ined in them. "You fe­el li­ke a pawn be­ca­use you ha­ve be­en one, Ha­ra­mis. But you are re­ac­hing the last squ­are, whe­re you can cho­ose what to be­co­me."</p>
   <p>    "A qu­e­en, of co­ur­se," Ha­ra­mis sa­id in surp­ri­se. "Wasn't that cho­ice ma­de for me long ago?"</p>
   <p>    "No," the Arc­hi­ma­ge sa­id softly, al­most in a whis­per, "that cho­ice is not ma­de un­til <emphasis>you</emphasis> cho­ose it. The im­por­tant thing is for the world to be bro­ught back in­to ba­lan­ce, which can only be do­ne if you and yo­ur sis­ters can find yo­ur own ba­lan­ce. The Crown may not be yo­ur des­tiny."</p>
   <p>    "What do you me­an?" Ha­ra­mis as­ked in hor­ror. "Will we lo­se the king­dom to Volt­rik? Will I be kil­led? Or has so­met­hing hap­pe­ned to the Crown? I left it with you for sa­fe­ke­eping-did I do wrong in that? "</p>
   <p>    "By no me­ans." The Arc­hi­ma­ge's vo­ice was fe­eb­le, but still audib­le. "The Crown is he­re, and sa­fe." She tur­ned her he­ad to­ward the fi­re. "Da­ma­to­le."</p>
   <p>    Haramis wo­uld not ha­ve tho­ught the Od­dling co­uld he­ar that whis­per, but he hur­ri­ed to Bi­nah's si­de. "The ti­me has co­me," the old wo­man whis­pe­red. He nod­ded, cros­sed to one of the cup­bo­ards on the far wall, to­ok out a whi­te bund­le, and bro­ught it to the Arc­hi­ma­ge. She slowly re­ac­hed out a hand, gras­ped a fold of the cloth, and ex­ten­ded it to Ha­ra­mis. As the bund­le star­ted to sli­de off the bed Ha­ra­mis gras­ped at it. It fell open ac­ross her arms, and she saw in surp­ri­se that it was the Arc­hi­ma­ge's clo­ak.</p>
   <p>    "Put it on, Ha­ra­mis," Bi­nah com­man­ded in a whis­per. "It is yo­urs now.</p>
   <p>    "Do you me­an I am to be Arc­hi­ma­ge?" Ha­ra­mis as­ked in surp­ri­se. <emphasis>I don't want this task</emphasis>, she tho­ught in dis­may. <emphasis>It's dif­fi­cult eno­ugh to be Qu­e­en</emphasis>-<emphasis>and at le­ast I am tra­ined for that! But to be the new Ar­c­hi­ma­ge</emphasis> - <emphasis>the can't ask</emphasis> that <emphasis>of me</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    "You ha­ve the abi­lity," Bi­nah whis­pe­red, "but it must be yo­ur cho­ice. I gi­ve you my bles­sing and my lo­ve, and one fi­nal war­ning. Re­mem­ber that the li­ne bet­we­en self con­fi­den­ce and over-con­fi­den­ce is nar­row and easily cros­sed. Gu­ard yo­ur­self al­ways. Cho­ose wi­sely." Then her bre­ath rat­tled in her thro­at and she lay still.</p>
   <p>    Haramis sta­red at her body in shock. <emphasis>This can't be hap­pe­ning</emphasis>, she tho­ught. <emphasis>I'm dre­aming. I'm in my bed in Oro­gas­tus's to­wer and I'm ha­ving a night­ma­re, I've be­en re­ading too many bo­oks of ma­gic, I-</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Haramis be­ca­me awa­re that Da­ma­to­le was spe­aking to her. "Whi­te Lady?"</p>
   <p>    She tur­ned slowly to lo­ok at him. "What is it, Da­ma­to­le?"</p>
   <p>    "What are yo­ur com­mands, Lady?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Commands? He thinks I'm the new Arc­hi­ma­ge. Why, oh why, did I ever get out of bed this mor­ning</emphasis> -<emphasis>yes­ter­day mor­ning</emphasis> - <emphasis>whe­ne­ver it was</emphasis>? She sho­uld tell him so­met­hing; af­ter all, he was only trying to do <emphasis>his</emphasis> job. Un­for­tu­na­tely, not­hing ca­me to mind.</p>
   <p>    "Let me get you so­me wa­ter to wash with and bring bre­ak­fast," he sug­ges­ted. "You must be hungry."</p>
   <p>    Hungry. Yes, now that he men­ti­oned it, she was hungry.</p>
   <p>    "Thank you, Da­ma­to­le," Ha­ra­mis sa­id blankly, "that wo­uld be very ni­ce."</p>
   <p>    Damatole ser­ved her a simp­le me­al, then led her away to a small cham­ber whe­re the­re was a cot. She lay down and slept, and when she wo­ke it was af­ter­no­on, and the­re was a me­al set on a small tab­le next to the cot. Ha­ra­mis ate every bi­te, and then went in se­arch of Da­ma­to­le. She fo­und him in the Arc­hi­ma­ge's cham­ber, but she was surp­ri­sed to see that the bed was empty. "Ha­ve you bu­ri­ed her body al­re­ady, Da­ma­to­le?" she as­ked. "I wo­uld ha­ve hel­ped - "</p>
   <p>    "There is no body," he rep­li­ed. "Do you not re­mem­ber?… No, I see you do not. The flesh that on­ce enc­lo­sed Bi­nah's spi­rit has go­ne to dust, as will this pla­ce, on­ce you le­ave it."</p>
   <p>    Haramis lo­oked mo­re clo­sely at the bed. Yes, the­re was dust on the pil­low whe­re Bi­nah's he­ad had be­en. "Whe­re is the Crown of Ru­wen­da?"</p>
   <p>    Damatole ope­ned the cup­bo­ard in the far wall and to­ok out a bund­le, wrap­ped in whi­te fab­ric, which he han­ded to Ha­ra­mis. When she unw­rap­ped it, she saw with re­li­ef that the Crown was who­le and un­da­ma­ged. <emphasis>Wo­uld it turn to dust if it sta­yed he­re when I left</emphasis>? she won­de­red.</p>
   <p>    "I shall get you a bag to carry it in," Da­ma­to­le of­fe­red, hur­rying out of the ro­om wit­ho­ut wa­iting for her res­pon­se.</p>
   <p>    Haramis tri­ed to think of what she sho­uld do next, but when Da­ma­to­le re­tur­ned with a le­at­her sack, she had not yet de­ci­ded. Sin­ce he ob­vi­o­usly ex­pec­ted her to le­ave, ho­we­ver, she sum­mo­ned the lam­mer­ge­i­er. Then it oc­cur­red to her that she was not the only one with no ho­me. "Da­ma­to­le, do you ha­ve a pla­ce to go?"</p>
   <p>    He nod­ded. "My kin will fetch me away. It is ar­ran­ged. The­re is only one last thing." He pic­ked up the Arc­hi­ma­ge's clo­ak, which was still lying on the sto­ol whe­re Ha­ra­mis had left it, and put it in­to the bag with the Crown.</p>
   <p>    "Why ha­ve you gi­ven me this?" she as­ked as they left the bu­il­ding to­get­her, fe­aring she al­re­ady knew the ans­wer.</p>
   <p>    "Because it is yo­urs, Whi­te Lady," he rep­li­ed. "And now I bid you fa­re­well."</p>
   <p>    A ri­sing wind blew her ha­ir back from her fa­ce. She lo­oked up at the thic­ke­ning clo­uds and won­de­red if it wo­uld ra­in to­mor­row, on the Eve of the Three Mo­ons.</p>
   <p>    Hiluro drop­ped out of the clo­uds and lan­ded be­si­de her. <emphasis>Whe­re wo­uld you go, Whi­te Lady</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    "Do not call me that," Ha­ra­mis sa­id in a low vo­ice. "Not yet." She mo­un­ted the lam­mer­ge­i­er, hol­ding tightly to the bag with the Crown and clo­ak, and Hi­lu­ro ro­se in­to the thre­ate­ning sky.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Forty-Two</strong></p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    King Volt­rik and the Gre­en Vo­ice wa­ited on the pa­ra­pet of the Ci­ta­del's High To­wer, and the dark clo­uds se­emed to bil­low only a few ells abo­ve the­ir he­ads, hi­ding the flag of La­bor­nok on its staff. Be­low, the ex­ten­si­ve fort­ress and its out­bu­il­dings and co­urt­yards we­re pe­cu­li­arly si­lent, even tho­ugh it was mid-after­no­on and a ti­me when the sur­vi­ving Ru­wen­di­an ser­vi­tors and fre­emen we­re usu­al­ly hard at work. But on this day only the ste­ady clang of a blacks­mith's ham­mer bro­ke the stil­lness, tol­ling li­ke so­me dis­cor­dant bell of evil omen. King Volt­rik shud­de­red.</p>
   <p>    "Is it the wretc­hed fe­ast up­co­ming to­mor­row," he as­ked the Gre­en Vo­ice, "that has ca­used the con­qu­ered ones to shirk the­ir du­ti­es? Full half of the usu­al Ci­ta­del staff cla­imed to­day to be stric­ken with ague and co­uld not le­ave the­ir beds - and tho­se who are at work skulk abo­ut list­les­sly and se­em ba­rely ab­le to carry on."</p>
   <p>    "Something is in the air," the Vo­ice ad­mit­ted. "Cer­ta­inly the­re is bo­und to be anot­her gre­at storm so­on."</p>
   <p>    "That's not what I me­ant," Volt­rik snar­led. "So­met­hing nasty is bre­wing, and I think you know what it is, and you are af­ra­id to tell me!"</p>
   <p>    The Gre­en Vo­ice lo­we­red his ho­oded he­ad in sub­mis­si­on. "My Al­mighty Mas­ter will so­on ar­ri­ve, Gre­at King, and he will put yo­ur mind at rest and ans­wer all qu­es­ti­ons."</p>
   <p>    The King ut­te­red a guf­faw of hu­mor­less la­ugh­ter and ab­ruptly tur­ned away from the acoly­te, to ga­ze out upon the ex­pan­se of land that lay to the north. The pe­cu­li­ar light ma­de the lush gre­en of the jung­le se­em es­pe­ci­al­ly in­ten­se, and the mi­re-smel­ls we­re al­so much stron­ger than usu­al.</p>
   <p>    "If my mind is to be eased," Volt­rik grow­led, "then why has the sor­ce­rer com­man­ded you to ha­ve all but a hand­ful of our tro­ops fall back to the Ci­ta­del and alert them­sel­ves for bat­tle?"</p>
   <p>    "A me­re pre­ca­uti­on - "</p>
   <p>    "Liar! Both of you! Con­ni­ving tra­itors!" The mo­narch swung aro­und and to­ok the Gre­en Vo­ice by his sho­ul­der. Even one-han­ded, he was ab­le to sha­ke Oro­gas­tus's as­sis­tant un­til his te­eth rat­tled. "They're co­ming for me - the three Prin­cess-Witc­hes! That's it, isn't it? I co­uld ha­ve be­en sa­fely away from he­re, back in De­ror­gu­ila, but you and Oro­gas­tus as­su­red me that all wo­uld be well - that the witc­hes we­re cap­tu­red and the­ir ta­lis­mans ta­ken. But you li­ed! And now they're co­ming for me, just as the prop­hecy sa­id!"</p>
   <p>    "Nay, Gre­at King - "</p>
   <p>    "I'm trap­ped he­re!" Volt­rik how­led. "Zo­to ha­ve mercy on me! The army ha­tes my guts be­ca­use they're go­ing to ha­ve to stay in this hel­lho­le thro­ugh the Ra­ins, and the knights are bo­red out of the­ir minds from inac­ti­on and drunk or wenc­hing most of the ti­me, and the­re is no one left to ser­ve me but cra­vens and fo­ols and tra­ito­ro­us tricks­ters plot­ting to ta­ke my king­dom on­ce the Ru­wen­di­an de­mon-trul­ls ha­ve fi­nis­hed me off!"</p>
   <p>    The Gre­en Vo­ice drop­ped to his kne­es and clas­ped his hands in sup­pli­ca­ti­on. "Not so, not so! My Mas­ter will exp­la­in all when he ar­ri­ves."</p>
   <p>    "If he do­es!" Volt­rik bel­lo­wed. He drew his short-sword and used the flat of it to mash the Vo­ice's no­se pa­in­ful­ly aga­inst his fa­ce. "And if he do­es not, then yo­ur sha­ven, flap-eared he­ad will ta­ke le­ave of its body, and I will hie me out of this sump of ini­qu­ity at dawn to­mor­row! Bet­ter to risk the pe­rils of the Ra­ins than lo­iter he­re li­ke a stu­pid nunc­hik in a sla­ugh­ter-pen."</p>
   <p>    A gre­at blow of the King's fo­ot sent the kne­eling mi­ni­on spraw­ling to the pa­ve­ment.</p>
   <p>    And the­re so­un­ded a cry li­ke a bra­zen trum­pet.</p>
   <p>    Startled, Volt­rik flung his ga­ze in all di­rec­ti­ons but the cor­rect one, so that he le­apt with surp­ri­se when a gi­gan­tic black-and-whi­te bird burst forth from the clo­uds, ut­te­red anot­her call, and gli­ded to a lan­ding on the pa­ra­pet.</p>
   <p>    From bet­we­en its still-exten­ded wings, Oro­gas­tus lo­oked down at the thun­derst­ruck King and bo­wed his he­ad slightly.</p>
   <p>    "Greetings to you, my Li­ege," he sa­id calmly. "I am he­re as I pro­mi­sed, and pre­pa­red to de­li­ver yo­ur ene­mi­es to you, as I pro­mi­sed al­so."</p>
   <p>    "Zoto's Te­eth! It's one of tho­se things that ser­ve the Arc­hi­ma­ge! And now it ser­ves <emphasis>you</emphasis> -?"</p>
   <p>    Orogastus slid from the lam­mer­ge­i­er's back. He than­ked it bri­efly, to which it me­rely rol­led its eyes and then as­cen­ded in­to the dark clo­uds with a sing­le flap of its wings.</p>
   <p>    "The Arc­hi­ma­ge," sa­id the sor­ce­rer with un­con­ce­aled sa­tis­fac­ti­on, "is de­ad. And her suc­ces­sor is no­ne ot­her than the Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis, who on­ce spur­ned yo­ur pro­po­sed bet­rot­hal, and who is now un­der my po­wer - alt­ho­ugh she still do­es not re­ali­ze it."</p>
   <p>    "By the Ten Hells!" Volt­rik she­at­hed his sword, gri­ma­cing with re­li­ef. "And the ot­her two ro­yal sluts?"</p>
   <p>    Orogastus wal­ked to the to­wer's nort­hern­most pa­ra­pet and sat on the sto­ne co­ping with his he­ad lo­we­red and his fa­ce con­ce­aled by the ho­od of his black clo­ak. Swiftly, using the spe­ech wit­ho­ut words, he ga­ve or­ders to his acoly­te. The Gre­en Vo­ice scramb­led to his fe­et and di­sap­pe­ared down the trap­do­or lad­der.</p>
   <p>    Then the sor­ce­rer drew back his ho­od and smi­led upon Volt­rik with all of the old charm and com­pel­ling self-pos­ses­si­on that had be­witc­hed a brash prin­ce so­me eigh­te­en ye­ars ear­li­er.</p>
   <p>    "The ot­her Prin­ces­ses are in­de­ed co­ming," Oro­gas­tus sa­id. "Ka­di­ya le­ads an un­dis­cip­li­ned rab­ble of swamp-dwar­ves ar­med with blow­guns and sto­ne spe­ars. Ani­gel's ter­rib­le host con­sists of a few hund­red ugly-fa­ced fo­rest Od­dlings, so­me fa­int-he­ar­ted Nysso­mu, a tro­op of grubby Ru­wen­di­an par­ti­sans… and yo­ur son, the tra­itor, with his cad­re of gnat-bit­ten turn­co­ats."</p>
   <p>    "But the Prin­ces­ses ha­ve the­ir ta­lis­mans!"</p>
   <p>    Orogastus nod­ded. "But they do not know how to use them pro­perly. They no do­ubt think that all they ne­ed to do is to com­mand our dest­ruc­ti­on. But I vow to you on my im­mor­tal so­ul that this is not the man­ner in which the ma­gi­cal inst­ru­ments func­ti­on. They are subt­le we­apons, and the Prin­ces­ses are im­ma­tu­re girls, with mo­re spi­rit than bra­ins, who do not un­ders­tand such things."</p>
   <p>    Voltrik sat be­si­de the sor­ce­rer, a scowl den­ting his brow, and che­wed on his mus­tac­hes. He ges­tu­red out at the Mi­re. "We can't go out the­re af­ter them. Not with the Ra­ins star­ting. We'd ne­ver hunt them down in the swamp, not even with the help of tho­se abo­mi­nab­le Drow­ners."</p>
   <p>    "No," Oro­gas­tus ad­mit­ted. "And for that very re­ason they ha­ve be­en en­co­ura­ged to co­me he­re to the Ci­ta­del, whe­re our su­pe­ri­or for­ces and my po­wer­ful enc­hant­ments will ma­ke an end of them on­ce and for all!"</p>
   <p>    Voltrik brigh­te­ned. "You will blast them with yo­ur light­ning? De­vas­ta­te them with the sor­cery you used in the con­qu­est?"</p>
   <p>    "I will lay the he­ads of Prin­cess Ka­di­ya and Prin­cess Ani­gel at yo­ur fe­et. Ha­ra­mis, who is my cre­atu­re, will ser­ve you body and so­ul."</p>
   <p>    Voltrik gig­gled ner­vo­usly. "I wo­uldn't mind that… if you can ma­gick her in­to sub­mis­si­on, that is. I al­ways fan­ci­ed tall wenc­hes, and I'll ha­ve to bre­ed mo­re sons so­me­how…"</p>
   <p>    "There <emphasis>will</emphasis> be a bat­tle, Si­re." Oro­gas­tus spo­ke al­most with in­dif­fe­ren­ce. "It will ta­ke pla­ce wit­hin two days, un­do­ub­tedly at the Fe­ast of the Three Mo­ons."</p>
   <p>    Voltrik was on his fe­et aga­in, eyes ag­le­am and vo­ice over­lo­ud. "Go­od! Damn it all, that's what we ne­ed to get our blo­od mo­ving aga­in! Sit­ting he­re for a month, half the ti­me sick un­to de­ath, has tur­ned my he­art as stag­nant as this ac­cur­sed swamp! Do you ha­ve the stra­tegy for the fight wor­ked out?"</p>
   <p>    "Most as­su­redly, my Li­ege." Oro­gas­tus now aro­se al­so. "And this ti­me, the­re is no do­ubt what­so­ever that we will win. My gre­at po­wers are ho­ned, and I am eager to de­fend you. The army he­re in the Ci­ta­del is re­ady, and Lord Osor­kon will so­on ar­ri­ve with an ad­di­ti­onal fi­ve tho­usand men… And lest you fret abo­ut the al­le­ged po­wer of the Prin­ces­ses and the­ir ta­lis­mans, the­re is al­so <emphasis>this.</emphasis>"</p>
   <p>    From be­ne­ath his clo­ak the sor­ce­rer to­ok a bag, and out from this ret­ri­eved a wo­oden box car­ved with skulls and ot­her symbols of de­ath. He ope­ned the box to re­ve­al a dull gre­en sphe­re abo­ut the si­ze of a small la­du-fru­it, set wit­hin a nest of pad­ded black vel­vet.</p>
   <p>    "This is a we­apon mo­re de­adly than all my ot­hers put to­get­her. It was the se­cond par­ting-gift to me of my la­te Mas­ter Bon­da­nus -"</p>
   <p>    "He who ga­ve you the Gol­den Pas­til­les?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes. They we­re a gift of li­fe - but this brings only de­ath of the most exc­ru­ci­ating kind. It is only to be used as a last re­sort, for its ba­ne will aff­lict ever­yo­ne, fri­end or foe, who stands at gro­und le­vel wit­hin a ra­di­us of a tho­usand ells. If its use sho­uld be re­qu­ired - if the­re is no ot­her way in which to kill the Prin­ces­ses - then I myself shall wi­eld it."</p>
   <p>    King Volt­rik had pa­led, and co­uld not ta­ke his eyes from the thing. "What is it cal­led, and how do­es it work?"</p>
   <p>    "It is known as the Do­om­ful Eff­lu­vi­um, and it is a we­apon ol­der than the Va­nis­hed Ones, used aga­inst them by the an­ces­tors of my Mas­ter, in the­ir gre­at strug­gle for the do­mi­na­ti­on of the world. The sphe­re is of glass. Das­hing it to the sto­nes re­le­ases de­adly va­pors that bring de­ath if a sing­le bre­ath of it be ta­ken. I am pre­pa­red to use it to as­su­re our vic­tory - even tho­ugh it will kill many of our own men as well as our ene­mi­es. You ne­ed not fe­ar it yo­ur­self, Si­re, as long as you re­ma­in on the up­per le­vels of the ke­ep. Its he­avy va­pors can­not ri­se far abo­ve a man's he­ight."</p>
   <p>    Orogastus clo­sed the box and put it away. "Undo­ub­tedly, it will not be ne­eded. I show it to you only to pro­ve that the­re is no way that the­se Prin­ces­ses can win out. We are in­vin­cib­le."</p>
   <p>    The eyes that the sor­ce­rer now tur­ned upon the grey-fa­ced mo­narch se­emed to be­co­me as bril­li­ant as stars, and his soft vo­ice com­pel­led trust and dro­ve away all fe­ar. "You do be­li­eve me, do you not, my King?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes," Volt­rik rep­li­ed in a tre­mu­lo­us whis­per. "Yes."</p>
   <p>    Knowing that her for­ces wo­uld now ha­ve to tra­vel from the­ir sec­ret camp on the Ri­ver Skro­kar to Ka­di­ya's hi­de­o­ut so­me fif­te­en le­agu­es away in the track­less Mi­re just north of the Ci­ta­del, Prin­cess Ani­gel had be­se­ec­hed her ta­lis­man to con­ce­al them from the enemy's ma­gi­cal sight. And lo! The day-mist had thic­ke­ned to an opa­que mi­as­ma that blin­ded the hu­mans but bot­he­red the Od­dlings not at all.</p>
   <p>    The Prin­cess de­emed this the ans­wer to her pra­yer, and her for­ce set out. The fle­et of Nysso­mu punts car­ri­ed the en­ti­re host sa­fely past Cast­le Ma­no­pa­ro, to the conf­lu­en­ce of the Skro­kar and the Mu­tar. Then­ce they pro­ce­eded up the gre­at ri­ver it­self, sta­ying in the back­wa­ters along the nort­hern sho­re un­til they had tur­ned off to the right in­to a clog­ged and twis­ting lit­tle chan­nel. This led Ani­gel to her sis­ter's sta­ging area, whe­re they ar­ri­ved at night­fall.</p>
   <p>    The pla­ce was anot­her lar­ge hum­mock, but lit only by ghostly lan­terns car­rying tiny gre­en-glo­wing swamp-worms. A Uis­gu chi­ef­ta­in with gre­at circ­les of red pa­int abo­ut his eyes and a full su­it of gol­den fish-sca­le ma­il met Ani­gel's bo­at at the hum­mock sho­re, sa­ying he wo­uld con­duct her, Prin­ce An­tar, and the ot­her La­bor­no­ki knights to the pla­ce whe­re Ka­di­ya wa­ited.</p>
   <p>    In the wan lan­tern light they di­sem­bar­ked, and fol­lo­wed a path to a simp­le le­at­her tent whe­re Ka­di­ya and her Uis­gu bat­tle-le­aders we­re po­ring over a dra­wing of the Ci­ta­del ke­ep spre­ad out upon a cru­de tab­le.</p>
   <p>    There we­re fe­ma­les the­re, for le­aders­hip was equ­al. But no long skirts lo­aded with fi­ne emb­ro­idery we­re to be se­en. One and all they wo­re wo­ven grass bre­ec­hes, and tu­nics over­la­id with shells and to­ugh sca­les, from sho­ul­der to thigh, not un­li­ke cha­in ma­il. They wo­re helms al­so, so­me fas­hi­oned of me­tal fo­und in the ru­ins. Ka­di­ya's ha­ir was bra­ided and co­iled un­der hers. Sa­ve for her he­ight, she might ha­ve be­en one of the ge­ne­ral com­pany.</p>
   <p>    When the gol­den-ha­ired Ani­gel ca­ught sight of her ol­der sis­ter, she for­got everyt­hing el­se, and burst in­to te­ars of glad­ness, rus­hing to­ward the ot­her with open arms.</p>
   <p>    But Ka­di­ya re­tur­ned the emb­ra­ce only he­si­tantly, and her dark eyes ne­ver left the fa­ce of An­tar, who had re­ma­ined at the ent­ran­ce to the shel­ter, to­get­her with his men. The Prin­ce lo­oked from Ani­gel to her sis­ter and the­re was the be­gin­ning of a frown on his fa­ce.</p>
   <p>    "What is wrong?" Ani­gel exc­la­imed in dis­may; "We-we are to­get­her on­ce mo­re, ali­ve!"</p>
   <p>    "Yes, I li­ve," Ka­di­ya re­tur­ned sto­lidly. "But who are the­se who co­me with you, Sis­ter? What pact ha­ve you ma­de with them? Trust can­not be ro­oted in the spil­ling of kin-blo­od." She sta­red po­in­tedly at the Prin­ce. "Ha­ve you for­got­ten so easily who­se ste­el slas­hed our world apart?"</p>
   <p>    Anigel ga­ve a cry as de­so­la­te as if Ka­di­ya had drawn a we­apon aga­inst her. "Antar is not to be fe­ared or mist­rus­ted, I will pled­ge my li­fe on it! My very ta­lis­man!" And she lif­ted from her he­ad the sil­very co­ro­net, who­se tril­li­um am­ber had be­gun to pul­sa­te bril­li­antly as she ap­pro­ac­hed her sis­ter, and held it out.</p>
   <p>    "Your High­ness." The Prin­ce lo­oked to Ka­di­ya stra­ightly. "What must we swe­ar by that will ma­ke you ac­cept the truth?"</p>
   <p>    Slowly, Ka­di­ya drew from its she­ath her own ta­lis­man. She re­ver­sed it and held it pom­mel up, so that it fa­ced both Ani­gel and An­tar. The three eyes ope­ned, and the watc­hing men mut­te­red in cons­ter­na­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    "Sister, turn abo­ut," Ka­di­ya com­man­ded, "and let both our ta­lis­mans pass judg­ment."</p>
   <p>    With a stric­ken co­un­te­nan­ce, Ani­gel did as she was bid.</p>
   <p>    "O Lords of the Air, gre­at ser­vants of God," Ka­di­ya in­to­ned, "re­ve­al to us which of the­se knights will grant us lo­ving ser­vi­ce, and which wo­uld do us harm, and do un­to the lat­ter as they wo­uld do to us."</p>
   <p>    There was a so­und­less blast of blue-whi­te light. Prin­ce An­tar and his fif­te­en lo­yal com­pa­ni­ons tot­te­red in the­ir ar­mor, the­ir mo­uths wi­de in shock; but on the wet earth lay two ot­her knights, un­mo­ving.</p>
   <p>    After the spa­ce of a few he­art­be­ats, Sir Owa­non bent over them. Sha­king his he­ad, he sa­id: "Onbo­gar and Tu­rat. Both sto­ne de­ad."</p>
   <p>    Anigel cri­ed out for hor­ror. But Prin­ce An­tar as­ked the ot­hers: "And whe­re is Ri­nu­tar?"</p>
   <p>    He was not among them; nor had an­yo­ne se­en him sin­ce le­aving the bo­at in which they had ap­pro­ac­hed Ka­di­ya's camp. An­tar wo­uld ha­ve sent his men se­arc­hing, but Prin­cess Ani­gel ba­de them stay.</p>
   <p>    "I will find him," she sa­id qu­i­etly. And she put her ta­lis­man back upon her he­ad, and her eyes se­emed to lo­ok thro­ugh all the ot­hers, in the di­rec­ti­on of the Ci­ta­del. "He is mid-ri­ver. In a sto­len punt."</p>
   <p>    "Smite him!" cri­ed bluff Sir Pe­na­pat. "He will ra­ise the alarm!"</p>
   <p>    "There is no ne­ed for that," sa­id a new vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    This ti­me it was Ka­di­ya and Ani­gel who sto­od stock-still and ga­ping; for Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis had pus­hed her way thro­ugh the crowd of ar­mo­red men to conf­ront her sis­ters. She wo­re the whi­te clo­ak of the Arc­hi­ma­ge, and car­ri­ed the Crown of Sta­te, unw­rap­ped, in one arm.</p>
   <p>    "Haramis!" her sis­ters exc­la­imed in uni­son.</p>
   <p>    "Kadiya! Ani­gel!" Ha­ra­mis emb­ra­ced her sis­ters, then sa­id: "Yes, it is I. You may as well let Ri­nu­tar go. King Volt­rik and Oro­gas­tus al­re­ady know that you are he­re, and that you in­tend to at­tack be­fo­re mo­on­ri­se to­mor­row, when the fe­ast be­gins."</p>
   <p>    All of them, Uis­gu and La­bor­no­ki, Ka­di­ya and Ani­gel, even sturdy lit­tle Jagun, be­gan to spe­ak at on­ce.</p>
   <p>    Haramis lif­ted her ta­lis­man. The tril­li­um am­ber set wit­hin the wand throb­bed with gol­den light, as did the am­ber of the ot­her ta­lis­mans. Si­len­ce fell.</p>
   <p>    Haramis sa­id: "Sis­ters, I know what num­bers of fol­lo­wers you ha­ve bro­ught to this en­camp­ment." She tri­ed not to let her inc­re­du­lity show in her vo­ice; they de­ser­ved her co­ur­tesy. "I ha­ve se­en many mo­re bo­ats full of Uis­gu ap­pro­ac­hing this pla­ce, as well as a lar­ge fle­et of he­avily ar­med Ru­wen­di­ans co­ming in from the free nort­he­ast. But if you at­tack the Ci­ta­del, all of the­se lo­yal fri­ends will die, for this ven­tu­re is fo­re­do­omed."</p>
   <p>    "Who told you so?" Ka­di­ya de­man­ded hotly. "Yo­ur de­arly be­lo­ved sor­ce­rer?"</p>
   <p>    Haramis flus­hed. She hardly de­ser­ved that; tho­ugh per­haps Ka­di­ya co­uld not be bla­med for thin­king so. She lo­oked Ka­di­ya stra­ight in the eye. "Wha­te­ver you may think has hap­pe­ned bet­we­en Oro­gas­tus and me, it is not I who ha­ve bro­ught the enemy to our co­un­cils." She lo­oked squ­arely at Ani­gel, stan­ding clo­se to Prin­ce An­tar. Ani­gel flus­hed, but sa­id not­hing. "As for do­om - I am not blind, I can see it for myself. Yo­ur abo­ri­gi­nes are only lightly ar­med. Co­unt Pa­lun­do's for­ce pro­bably can­not get he­re in ti­me - but even if it do­es, it will be co­un­te­red by the fi­ve tho­usand men that Osor­kon is brin­ging down the ri­ver. The ot­her half of Volt­rik's army is al­re­ady on alert, re­ady to re­pel any as­sa­ult you might mo­unt. The gre­at ga­tes of the Ci­ta­del ha­ve be­en re­pa­ired - "</p>
   <p>    "Perhaps," sa­id Ka­di­ya with a grin, "we ha­ve the whe­re­wit­hal to open them. And to de­fe­at yo­ur co­nj­urer as well!"</p>
   <p>    "You are gamb­ling many li­ves on that as­sump­ti­on," Ha­ra­mis po­in­ted out. "Per­haps you do not know that you can no lon­ger co­unt upon the as­sis­tan­ce of the Arc­hi­ma­ge."</p>
   <p>    "Why not?" Ka­di­ya de­man­ded. "She has al­ways as­sis­ted us be­fo­re. Are you trying to tell us that she wo­uld aid Oro­gas­tus in this bat­tle?"</p>
   <p>    "No," Ha­ra­mis sa­id we­arily. "I am trying to tell you that the Arc­hi­ma­ge is de­ad."</p>
   <p>    It was Ani­gel who cri­ed out in dis­may. Ka­di­ya sa­id ang­rily: "How do you know?"</p>
   <p>    "I know be­ca­use I was the­re," Ha­ra­mis sa­id, and then her gri­ef thre­ate­ned to over­co­me her aga­in. As yet she had shed no te­ars for the Arc­hi­ma­ge; but she did not da­re to gi­ve way just now. She for­ced her vo­ice to re­ma­in ste­ady.</p>
   <p>    "I tell you, Oro­gas­tus is wa­iting for you with all the ar­ca­ne we­aponry at his com­mand, and he has cal­led for the lo­cal Gre­en­mi­re Skri­tek to walk. They are con­ver­ging upon Ci­ta­del Knoll, and will harry and de­vo­ur any of yo­ur pe­op­le they can catch! Do you re­al­ly be­li­eve you can fa­ce all that-and Oro­gas­tus's we­apons?"</p>
   <p>    There was a mo­ment of si­len­ce, which se­emed very long to Ha­ra­mis. "You will all be mas­sac­red," she ad­ded qu­i­etly. "Withd­raw, I beg of you. They can't fol­low you in­to the swamps at this ti­me of ye­ar."</p>
   <p>    "No!" Ka­di­ya smas­hed her fist on­to the tab­le. "Oro­gas­tus has be­witc­hed you! That is pla­in to see, for all that you ha­ve usur­ped the clo­ak of the Arc­hi­ma­ge."</p>
   <p>    "Do you re­al­ly think I wan­ted to ta­ke her pla­ce?" Ha­ra­mis de­man­ded. All of her fa­ti­gue, all of her gri­ef for the Arc­hi­ma­ge thre­ate­ned to over­po­wer her aga­in.</p>
   <p>    "Yes, I do," Ka­di­ya dec­la­red hotly. "You ha­ve al­ways be­en gre­edy for po­wer, Ha­ra­mis. You can­not be­ar to think that eit­her Ani or I might ha­ve a plan that is bet­ter than yo­urs."</p>
   <p>    The un­fa­ir­ness of this struck Ha­ra­mis li­ke a blow. She felt as if she wo­uld col­lap­se un­der it. Ka­di­ya sur­ve­yed her ang­rily, but Ani­gel saw the gri­ef in her fa­ce.</p>
   <p>    "I think you are be­ing un­fa­ir, Ka­di," she sa­id. "Let us at le­ast he­ar Ha­ra­mis's plan."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya gla­red at both of them. She sa­id: "What of the Crown, Ha­ra­mis? Will you and Oro­gas­tus sha­re the thro­nes of Ru­wen­da and La­bor­nok, af­ter Volt­rik is dis­po­sed of in this gre­at plan of yo­urs?"</p>
   <p>    "Of co­ur­se not! Ka­di­ya, you simply don't un­ders­tand." Ha­ra­mis was al­most des­pa­iring. How co­uld she ma­ke her sis­ters see?</p>
   <p>    It was lit­tle Jagun who sa­id unex­pec­tedly: "Let the ta­lis­mans pro­ve her true or fal­se, as they did Prin­ce An­tar and his men."</p>
   <p>    Haramis drew her­self to her full he­ight. "As you wish. But if yo­ur ta­lis­mans are anyt­hing li­ke my own, Sis­ters, you had best be very ca­re­ful how you fra­me yo­ur test. For I ha­ve no do­ubt that my ta­lis­man, li­ke yo­urs, is ca­pab­le of kil­ling."</p>
   <p>    "So be it," sa­id Ka­di­ya, as Ani­gel lo­oked from one sis­ter to the ot­her in open dist­ress. The­ir tho­ughts we­re easily re­ad even by the La­bor­no­ki knights and the Uis­gu.</p>
   <p>    "Dearest Ha­ra­mis," Ani­gel sa­id for­lornly, "we want very much to trust you, but we ha­ve <emphasis>se­en</emphasis> you con­sor­ting with Oro­gas­tus." Ani­gel had te­ars in her eyes, but her vo­ice was ste­ady. "We ha­ve no ot­her co­ur­se but to ask if you will gi­ve us le­ave to test you."</p>
   <p>    Haramis re­gar­ded her sis­ter with a be­mu­sed exp­res­si­on. All of the ot­hers in the tent held the­ir bre­ath, and in the stil­lness co­uld be he­ard the first pat­ter of ra­ind­rops from the new storm, and a qu­i­et mur­mur of many vo­ices out­si­de. Anot­her band of rec­ru­its had ar­ri­ved.</p>
   <p>    She sa­id qu­i­etly: "I did not ask to test you, tho­ugh you bro­ught yo­ur Prin­ce he­re." Ani­gel flus­hed as Ha­ra­mis went on. "Let it be as you will." She to­ok her own ta­lis­man and held it be­fo­re her fa­ce. "Test me, then."</p>
   <p>    At that po­int, all of An­tar's knights and the Uis­gu left the tent in pre­ci­pi­ta­te has­te. Only the Prin­ce and Jagun re­ma­ined, and the small Nysso­mu hunts­man sketc­hed the sign of the Black Tril­li­um be­fo­re each sis­ter. Ha­ra­mis han­ded Jagun the Crown; he to­ok it re­ve­rently and knelt in a cor­ner with his he­ad bo­wed.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya and Ani­gel still sto­od si­de by si­de, ta­lis­mans ra­ised. But this ti­me it was the yo­un­gest Prin­cess who spo­ke.</p>
   <p>    "Dear Lords of the Air, ha­ve pity on us three. But al­so show cle­arly to us any dan­ger we might po­se to the gre­at ba­lan­ce of the world."</p>
   <p>    The three ta­lis­mans glo­wed a de­ep crim­son, fil­ling the tent with bril­li­ant light. The three Prin­ces­ses we­re li­ke sta­tu­es, with eyes wi­de and lips slightly par­ted.</p>
   <p>    Then co­ro­net and wand and po­int­less sword to­ok on a spect­ral as­pect; they flew from the­ir ow­ners to a po­int mid­way abo­ve them… and the­re the ta­lis­mans mer­ged. The shaft of the wand slip­ped in­to the three-lo­bed pom­mel, and the co­ro­net, with its monst­ro­us vi­sa­ges be­low the cusps, en­gir­ded the Circ­le and clo­sed; whe­re­upon the three co­nj­o­ined wings with the­ir am­ber cen­ter we­re sud­denly sus­pen­ded wit­hin con­cent­ric rings. A myste­ri­o­us vo­ice spo­ke.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>In this Scept­re of Po­wer is the po­ten­ti­al for per­ma­nent ba­lan­ce, as well as for the ru­in of this world. Con­si­der most judi­ci­o­usly be­fo­re com­man­ding the Scept­re, and re­mem­ber that tho­se who ma­de it we­re in the end af­ra­id to use it…</emphasis></p>
   <p>    The blo­od-red light fa­ded. Each Prin­cess aga­in held her own ta­lis­man.</p>
   <p>    After many si­lent mi­nu­tes, Prin­ce An­tar spo­ke. "Did the ta­lis­mans ans­wer?"</p>
   <p>    Haramis sta­red, un­be­li­eving, but it was Ani­gel who de­man­ded, in the vo­ice of one wa­king from a dre­am: "Did you not see and he­ar?"</p>
   <p>    "Nothing, gra­ci­o­us Lady, sa­ve yo­ur own in­vo­ca­ti­on."</p>
   <p>    The three sis­ters exc­han­ged glan­ces. Wit­ho­ut thin­king, all three ca­me to­get­her in a trip­le emb­ra­ce.</p>
   <p>    "So it se­ems I am exo­ne­ra­ted," Ha­ra­mis whis­pe­red. "Or am I?"</p>
   <p>    "Of co­ur­se you are," Ka­di­ya sa­id sharply, "but we will at­tack the Ci­ta­del no­net­he­less."</p>
   <p>    Haramis frow­ned. "Are you both re­sol­ved on this?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes," sa­id Ani­gel. "If you will not jo­in us, Sis­ter, then at le­ast do not hin­der us, nor gi­ve aid to our ene­mi­es."</p>
   <p>    "I will not," Ha­ra­mis sa­id. "But I must le­ave you. I must go to Ci­ta­del Knoll, and the­re… I do not know what I will do. But I know I must go the­re."</p>
   <p>    Little Jagun had co­me from his pla­ce in the cor­ner, still hol­ding the Crown of Sta­te. "If you wish, Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis, I will ta­ke you in a punt."</p>
   <p>    "I thank you," Ha­ra­mis sa­id. "But be­fo­re I le­ave," she sa­id to her sis­ters, "let me tell you so­met­hing I le­ar­ned du­ring my ti­me with Oro­gas­tus. Much of his so-cal­led 'ma­gic' co­mes from de­vi­ces of the Va­nis­hed Ones, and it is pos­sib­le that yo­ur ta­lis­mans may be used to bre­ak the­se de­vi­ces. When my ta­lis­man to­uc­hed one, the de­vi­ce ce­ased to func­ti­on. This may work with yo­ur ta­lis­mans as well." She hug­ged her sis­ters. "Ka­di­ya, Ani­gel, be ca­re­ful -and may the Lords of the Air pro­tect you!"</p>
   <p>    She to­ok the Crown from Jagun. And then whi­te-clo­aked Ha­ra­mis was go­ne with the Nysso­mu hunts­man, and only An­tar was left with the ot­her two Prin­ces­ses. A grumb­le of thun­der so­un­ded and the ra­in­fall qu­ic­ke­ned.</p>
   <p>    Kadiya frow­ned at the tall yo­ung man in the blue ar­mor. "You re­al­ly saw not­hing? No red light, no mer­ging of the ta­lis­mans? You he­ard no un­can­ny vo­ice?"</p>
   <p>    "Truly not, my Prin­cess," An­tar sa­id.</p>
   <p>    "The vi­si­on was for us, Ka­di," Ani­gel sa­id. "And es­pe­ci­al­ly, I think, for po­or Ha­ra­mis."</p>
   <p>    "Poor?" Ka­di­ya scof­fed. "Why, he­re we stand, out­casts re­ady to go to war-whi­le she, with Crown and clo­ak, cho­oses to watch on the si­de­li­nes!"</p>
   <p>    "If we are ab­le to win out wit­ho­ut the Scept­re, then she will in­de­ed be the luc­ki­est. But if we ne­ed it…"</p>
   <p>    Kadiya threw back her sho­ul­ders, and gras­ped the pom­mel of her ta­lis­man firmly. "It will not co­me to that."</p>
   <p>    And then, spe­aking briskly, she in­vi­ted Prin­ce An­tar to call in aga­in the lo­yal knights and the le­aders of the Folk, so that she might exp­la­in the plan of in­va­si­on to all of them.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Forty-Three</strong></p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    That night Ha­ra­mis slept sa­fe and dry be­ne­ath a tree on the sho­re of the Knoll, in a small park be­si­de the Ci­ta­del Lan­ding. She told her ta­lis­man to con­ce­al her from sight, and a mist ef­fec­ti­vely hid her from the few gu­ards on duty at the docks.</p>
   <p>    In the mor­ning the storm had pas­sed, but the fog lay he­avi­er, enc­lo­sing her wit­hin a soft grey ro­om whe­re the only so­unds we­re the oc­ca­si­onal chirps and squ­e­aks of birds and in­sects, and the slow drip­ping from the mar­gin of the tree ca­nopy. The dock gu­ards, she dis­co­ve­red, had ret­re­ated to the Ci­ta­del. The ro­ad from the Lan­ding led di­rectly to the ma­in ga­te of the fort­ress less than a le­ague away, and she knew that one part of her sis­ter's fo­ol­hardy plan in­vol­ved an at­tack along this most ob­vi­o­us ro­ute.</p>
   <p>    She sat qu­i­etly in me­di­ta­ti­on, and pra­yed for gu­idan­ce. It was dif­fi­cult; ot­her tho­ughts kept int­ru­ding, worry for her sis­ters, gri­ef for the loss of her pa­rents and the Whi­te Lady, an­ger at Ka­di­ya's ac­cu­sa­ti­on that she had usur­ped the Arc­hi­ma­ge's ro­be- <emphasis>as if I even wan­ted it! But who el­se is the­re? Do­es Ka­di­ya think</emphasis> she <emphasis>co­uld be Ar­c­hi­ma­ge</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    As if the tho­ught had sum­mo­ned her, Ha­ra­mis saw the slen­der ima­ge of Bi­nah ap­pe­ar be­fo­re her, ro­bed in her shi­ning whi­te clo­ak with the ho­od hi­ding her fa­ce. But the hands that ro­se slowly to push back the ho­od we­re yo­ung and un­li­ned, and Ha­ra­mis felt a sud­den pang of dre­ad. What wo­uld the fa­ce be? Wo­uld it be Ka­di­ya's - or so­me hor­rib­le de­mon?</p>
   <p>    It was ne­it­her; the fa­ce was Bi­nah's, but it was trans­for­med: ra­di­ant and no lon­ger old. It was as if all that was mor­tal in her had de­par­ted and what re­ma­ined was her spi­rit in pu­re form.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Ha­ra­mis bo­wed her he­ad.</p>
   <p>    A hand se­emed to ca­ress her ha­ir and a cle­ar mu­si­cal vo­ice which was still so­me­how Bi­nah's sa­id, <emphasis>What is it, my da­ug­h­ter</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>My sis­ters</emphasis>, Ha­ra­mis rep­li­ed mi­se­rably. <emphasis>They think I'm in lo­ve with Oro­gas­tus</emphasis> - <emphasis>be­wit­c­hed by him, in fact</emphasis>-<emphasis>and Ka­di­ya ac­tu­al­ly ac­cu­sed me of usur­ping yo­ur clo­ak</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>But you know that is not true</emphasis>, the gent­le vo­ice sa­id. <emphasis>In ti­me they will le­arn it al­so</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Kadiya sa­id I was po­wer hungry.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>And she thinks that is why you we­ar the clo­ak</emphasis>. It was not a qu­es­ti­on. I<emphasis>ga­ve it to you, Ha­ra­mis, but I can­not for­ce you to we­ar it. It is a bur­den, and ot­her pe­op­le, even tho­se who lo­ve you, will ne­ver un­ders­tand why you do this work. It must be do­ne for it­self, not be­ca­use so­me­one el­se wants you to do it, or will pra­ise you for do­ing it</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>The work is well worth do­ing</emphasis>, Bi­nah con­ti­nu­ed. <emphasis>It is al­ways the­re, wa­iting for the one cal­led to do it. So­me­one must ca­re for Ru­wen­da, must ma­ke cer­ta­in that it grows as it sho­uld</emphasis>-<emphasis>or at le­ast that it sur­vi­ves un­til so­me­one stron­ger can pick up the bur­den. The­re is gre­at joy in the la­bor: to see the be­a­uty of the pat­tern and to know that yo­ur ef­forts help to ma­in­ta­in it, to he­ar the vo­ice of the land and its Folk, to fe­el the cycle of the se­asons and the gre­ater cycle of the ages.</emphasis>..</p>
   <p>    Binah's vo­ice fell si­lent, but in that si­len­ce Ha­ra­mis se­emed to he­ar and fe­el Ru­wen­da in a way she ne­ver had be­fo­re. It se­emed as if the land had a pul­se, a he­art­be­at, and Ha­ra­mis felt her own he­art matc­hing the rhythm she he­ard. It se­emed to her that the­re was a song in that pul­se, a song she co­uld al­most he­ar and un­ders­tand - if she co­uld only re­ach out and truly lis­ten…</p>
   <p>    She sat ent­ran­ced for a long ti­me, only dimly awa­re of Bi­nah's de­par­tu­re.</p>
   <p>    Then a me­tal tray ap­pe­ared be­fo­re her, and in­vi­sib­le hands lo­we­red it in­to her lap. On it we­re fo­ur he­arts, ap­pa­rently hu­man, and a pitc­her of sea wa­ter. <emphasis>Wash the­se</emphasis>, a vo­ice com­man­ded. In Ha­ra­mis's dre­am­li­ke sta­te, this se­emed a re­aso­nab­le re­qu­est. She pic­ked up the first he­art. It fit com­for­tably in­to her hand and pul­sed gently with li­fe and warmth. She po­ured the sally wa­ter over and thro­ugh it, and the in­vi­sib­le hand to­ok it from her as she fi­nis­hed. She re­pe­ated the pro­ce­du­re with the se­cond and third he­arts, which se­emed iden­ti­cal to the first. But when she pic­ked up the fo­urth he­art it felt dif­fe­rent, odd. So­met­hing on the bot­tom of it pric­ked her palm, and she tur­ned it over. To her be­wil­der­ment, she saw that it was a de­vi­ce of so­me sort, not a hu­man he­art at all, but me­rely a semb­lan­ce of one. She re­ac­hed for the wa­ter, but the un­se­en hand bloc­ked hers. <emphasis>No</emphasis>, the vo­ice sa­id sadly, <emphasis>that one can­not be was­hed. He has gi­ven up his hu­ma­nity</emphasis>. The mec­ha­ni­cal he­art was re­mo­ved from her hand.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>I don't un­der­s­tand</emphasis>, Ha­ra­mis tho­ught.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>You must be ab­le to en­du­re truth</emphasis>, the vo­ice sa­id.</p>
   <p>    Haramis didn't un­ders­tand that eit­her.</p>
   <p>    Then for a ti­me, she let her mind rest in a dre­am­less sle­ep.</p>
   <p>    When she wo­ke, it was ne­ar dusk. Using the Three-Win­ged Circ­le, she watc­hed the pre­pa­ra­ti­ons go­ing on wit­hin the Ci­ta­del, the war­ri­ors ta­king up po­si­ti­ons to de­fend the fort­ress from as­sa­ult, and the co­mings and go­ings of the knights and of­fi­cers as they re­por­ted to the King. She saw Oro­gas­tus and the Gre­en Vo­ice re­ad­ying the mar­ti­al de­vi­ces of the Va­nis­hed Ones: two mac­hi­nes that sum­mo­ned light­ning; one that wo­uld scre­ech with so overw­hel­ming a so­und that tho­se who­se ears we­re unp­ro­tec­ted wo­uld fall de­afe­ned and ble­eding; two that spra­yed a ha­il of de­adly pel­lets; one that flung gre­at go­uts of fla­me; and anot­her that shot po­iso­ned ne­ed­les. But as Ha­ra­mis watc­hed, it se­emed that a small vo­ice whis­pe­red to her that the­se en­gi­nes of de­ath we­re mo­re su­ited to of­fen­se than de­fen­se, and might ac­tu­al­ly work to the di­sad­van­ta­ge of tho­se who tri­ed to use them in­si­de the fort­ress…</p>
   <p>    She won­de­red what Ka­di­ya and Ani­gel plan­ned to do. The freshly re­pa­ired Ci­ta­del out­works and cur­ta­in­wal­ls co­uld not be sca­led; they we­re ste­ep and over­lo­oked by emb­ra­su­res thro­ugh which cros­sbow­men or the wi­el­ders of the sor­ce­rer's we­apons might sho­ot. Whi­le her sis­ters' ta­lis­mans might shi­eld the­ir fol­lo­wers from the sor­ce­rer's pre­ter­na­tu­ral Sight, Ha­ra­mis was cer­ta­in that in­va­ders wo­uld be qu­ite vi­sib­le to the nor­mal eyes of the La­bor­no­ki de­fen­ders. The new ga­tes we­re too mas­si­ve for any ram to burst. Did her sis­ters think to use the ta­lis­mans to bre­ak in? Pres­sing her wand to her he­art, Ha­ra­mis as­ked, <emphasis>Is this pos­sib­le</emphasis>? And an ans­wer for­med in her mind.</p>
   <p>    <strong>No.</strong></p>
   <p>    Her he­art sank. I <emphasis>will gi­ve them what help I can, but I will not in­ter­fe­re</emphasis>, she told her­self. <emphasis>Nor will I of­fer un­wan­ted ad­vi­ce. They are fol­lo­wing the­ir des­ti­ni­es</emphasis> -<emphasis>and I ha­ve cho­sen mi­ne</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    A gre­at fe­eling of tran­qu­il­lity spre­ad over her. Sit­ting he­re be­ne­ath the tree in the eve­ning mist, she had a fe­eling aga­in of be­ing ro­oted in the very cen­ter of the world, of kno­wing her pla­ce in the gre­ater pat­tern.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>I ha­ve be­co­me what I al­ways knew I co­uld be</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>But will its pri­ce be the de­ath of my sis­ters?</emphasis></p>
   <p>    She held the Circ­le up­right, and as­ked to see them. And when the vi­si­on ca­me she watc­hed for ho­urs, mar­ve­ling.</p>
   <p>    Most of the­ir army, un­der the com­mand of the hu­man Ru­wen­di­ans and An­tar's lo­yal knights, to­ok up a po­si­ti­on in the swamp just ac­ross the ri­ver from her own po­si­ti­on at Ci­ta­del Lan­ding, which was a le­ague down­hill from the fort­ress it­self. Sin­ce this put them al­most di­rectly op­po­si­te her, she lis­te­ned ca­re­ful­ly and lo­oked ac­ross the ri­ver to see if they we­re per­cep­tib­le to nor­mal hu­man sen­ses. Sa­tis­fi­ed that they we­re not, she re­tur­ned her ga­ze to the Circ­le.</p>
   <p>    Apart from the ma­in body of at­tac­kers, a few hund­red Uis­gu and Wyvi­lo figh­ters, led by Ka­di­ya and Ani­gel and Prin­ce An­tar, had ro­wed up the Mu­tar un­til they re­ac­hed that pla­ce whe­re the an­ci­ent wa­ter-inta­ke tun­nel had its ope­ning. Se­cu­red from enemy Sight by the ta­lis­mans, this gro­up had di­sap­pe­ared in­to the cis­tern con­du­it.</p>
   <p>    "By the Flo­wer!" Ha­ra­mis whis­pe­red in ad­mi­ra­ti­on. "If Ka­di­ya and Ani­gel can open the Ci­ta­del ga­tes to the­ir army, then per­haps they <emphasis>do</emphasis> ha­ve a chan­ce to win!"</p>
   <p>    Later, when the Trip­le Mo­ons we­re ri­sing, in­vi­sib­le in the fog, and the fe­ast had its of­fi­ci­al com­men­ce­ment, Ha­ra­mis ma­de her own small ce­re­mony and ate from the bag of pro­vi­si­ons Jagun had left with her. Then Ha­ra­mis as­ked her ta­lis­man whe­re re­in­for­ce­ments of the La­bor-no­ki army might be. The Circ­le sho­wed her a fle­et of over a hund­red flat­bo­ats hurt­ling down the ri­ver with all the spe­ed the oars­men co­uld mus­ter. Even if her sis­ters ma­na­ged to pe­net­ra­te the fort­ress and throw open the ga­tes, they wo­uld be overw­hel­med on­ce this se­cond gro­up of he­avily ar­med La­bor­no­ki war­ri­ors ar­ri­ved.</p>
   <p>    As the pic­tu­re in the Circ­le fa­ded, she wi­ped uns­hed te­ars from her eyes. So be it. Her sis­ters' fa­te wo­uld be as it wo­uld be, and she must get on with her own bu­si­ness.</p>
   <p>    She sum­mo­ned a vi­si­on of Oro­gas­tus. "I ha­ve ma­de my cho­ice," she told him.</p>
   <p>    The sor­ce­rer re­gar­ded her wit­ho­ut exp­res­si­on. "Will you do me the ho­nor of tel­ling me this de­ci­si­on of yo­urs fa­ce to fa­ce? I reg­ret I can­not co­me to you; the lam­mer­ge­i­er you com­man­ded to carry me he­re per­for­med its ser­vi­ce and then di­sap­pe­ared."</p>
   <p>    "Very well," she sa­id. "I shall co­me, to the High To­wer of the ke­ep."</p>
   <p>    "May I me­et you in the so­lar the­re an ho­ur from now, at mid­night?" Oro­gas­tus re­qu­es­ted. "You know, of co­ur­se, that no­ne of us he­re can pos­sibly harm you now that yo­ur ta­lis­man is em­po­we­red."</p>
   <p>    "I know," Ha­ra­mis sa­id simply. "I shall co­me."</p>
   <p>    "Farewell," Oro­gas­tus sa­id, and his hand­so­me fa­ce sof­te­ned in a smi­le. "Fa­re thee very well, Ha­ra­mis, my be­lo­ved." His ima­ge fa­ded from the Circ­le.</p>
   <p>    Haramis be­gan to gat­her up her things by the dim gol­den light of the tril­li­um-amber in­set in her ta­lis­man. The mist be­gan to lift, and a bre­ath of chill wind rust­led the long le­aves of the wydel-tre­es in the park. Among the re­eds and sho­re-brush, not far away, so­me cre­atu­re was splas­hing and scrab­bling in the dark. Ha­ra­mis tho­ught not­hing of this, and was re­ady to call her lam­mer­ge­i­er, when the bus­hes par­ted and two gle­aming gol­den eyes lo­oked out at her.</p>
   <p>    "Princess," a vo­ice his­sed.</p>
   <p>    "By the Flo­wer- <emphasis>Im­mu"</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Haramis drop­ped the bag in which she had pac­ked the Crown and clo­ak, and ran to emb­ra­ce the old Nysso­mu nur­se.</p>
   <p>    "Immu, what are you do­ing he­re?"</p>
   <p>    The lit­tle be­ing scow­led and sho­wed her di­mi­nu­ti­ve fangs. "Do­ing do­ing do­ing! It is a story too over­long to tell now. My bra­ins are all in a fraz­zle be­ca­use I ha­ve be­en has­te­ning to re­j­o­in my dar­ling Prin­cess Ani­gel, and sin­ce no­on­ti­de to­day my Sight has re­fu­sed to show her to me!"</p>
   <p>    Haramis nod­ded. "It is ma­gic en­gen­de­red by her ta­lis­man, hi­ding her from the Sight of her ene­mi­es - and fri­ends as well, it se­ems."</p>
   <p>    "I ca­me to the Knoll, and spi­ed you sit­ting he­re in the park. I co­uld hardly be­li­eve my eyes! Do you know whe­re my Prin­cess is? She <emphasis>ne­eds</emphasis> me!"</p>
   <p>    "Yes, I know whe­re she is. But I do­ubt that she re­qu­ires yo­ur go­od of­fi­ces, Im­mu, for she and Ka­di­ya are at this mo­ment le­ading an army in­to the Ci­ta­del to chal­len­ge King Volt­rik."</p>
   <p>    "Lords of the Air!" Im­mu wa­iled, and her eyes pop­ped audibly. "On such a ven­tu­re, she will ne­ed me mo­re than ever! Tell me how I may re­ach her si­de!"</p>
   <p>    Haramis he­si­ta­ted. "Do you ha­ve a bo­at?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes, a small punt with oars."</p>
   <p>    Haramis pic­ked up her things. "I will ha­ve to show you."</p>
   <p>    They em­bar­ked, and Im­mu ro­wed along qu­i­etly in the dark back­wa­ters of the Mu­tar, fol­lo­wing Ha­ra­mis's gu­idan­ce. Af­ter half an ho­ur, they ca­me to a nar­row mudf­lat with much of its ve­ge­ta­ti­on sub­mer­ged by the ri­sing flo­od. In­land of this was the Knoll slo­pe with a high bank cut in it, and the le­vel gro­und at the ba­se of the bank was thickly overg­rown with thorn-ferns.</p>
   <p>    The mud was ro­iled and pock­mar­ked with a gre­at wel­ter of fo­otp­rints.</p>
   <p>    "Here?" Im­mu was inc­re­du­lo­us. "They've lan­ded <emphasis>he­re</emphasis>? But it is ne­arly two le­agu­es to the Ci­ta­del from this spot, all up­hill and on open gro­und. And I see no tra­ces of them -"</p>
   <p>    "Immu, they ha­ve go­ne in thro­ugh the old cis­tern con­du­it. My sis­ters we­re con­fi­dent that they co­uld shi­eld the­ir for­ce from Oro­gas­tus's Sight at le­ast un­til they ga­ined the lo­wer le­vels of the ke­ep it­self. From the­re they will at­tempt to open the Ma­in Ga­te and the Vic­tu­aler's Ga­te."</p>
   <p>    Immu was gir­ding up her skirts grimly. "How ha­ve they as­cen­ded the cis­tern shaft?"</p>
   <p>    "A ro­pe with a grap­ple-iron was shot up. Af­ter one Uis­gu clim­bed it, he ha­uled many ro­pe lad­ders in­to pla­ce for the ot­hers. The lad­ders are still the­re."</p>
   <p>    "Scry them for me! Tell me if Prin­cess Ani­gel is yet sa­fe!"</p>
   <p>    "No. I will only pray that the Lords of the Air will fight at the­ir si­des."</p>
   <p>    "Very well, then," the lit­tle old nur­se exc­la­imed. "You just pray away. But I'm off!" And she le­aped from the bo­at, splas­hed ac­ross the tramp­led mud, and was so­on lost to sight among the tall ferns.</p>
   <p>    Haramis sig­hed, and mo­ved for­ward to ta­ke the oars. The­re we­re La­bor­no­ki sco­uting pat­rols ran­ging he­re and the­re abo­ut the Knoll, and so­oner or la­ter they wo­uld dis­co­ver this pla­ce of entry and gi­ve the alarm. <emphasis>I co­uld bring down the ri­ver­bank</emphasis>, she tho­ught, <emphasis>bur­ying the ent­ran­ce to the tun­nel</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    She lif­ted the ta­lis­man. The three fol­ded wings as­su­med an open po­si­ti­on wit­hin the Circ­le, and the tril­li­um am­ber sho­ne at the cen­ter whe­re they jo­ined. "Let the earth li­qu­efy and the mud flow to co­ver this pla­ce from hos­ti­le eyes."</p>
   <p>    There was a low rumb­le. The high bank se­emed to rip­ple in the mist, then slid to co­ver the tun­nel ent­ran­ce. Whe­re the ste­ep bank and the fern thic­ket had be­en the­re was now not­hing but a long glis­te­ning muddy chu­te stud­ded with small bo­ul­ders.</p>
   <p>    The bo­at roc­ked gently on the ri­ver. Tend­rils of va­por sto­le abo­ut the sur­fa­ce of the wa­ter li­ke ghostly sna­kes. Far away, she he­ard the drum­ming of fro­ni­al-ho­oves. The La­bor­no­ki ca­valry was pat­rol­ling the ro­ad to Ru­wen­da Mar­ket. A sil­ver trum­pet cal­led fa­intly; anot­her, clo­ser by, ga­ve bri­ef res­pon­se.</p>
   <p>    In Ha­ra­mis's mind, a vo­ice se­emed to say, <emphasis>The po­wer is wit­hin you. And that is the gre­at pe­ril of it</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    She ro­wed away in the slug­gish back­wa­ters un­til she was a go­od dis­tan­ce from the muds­li­de, and then put in aga­in to sho­re. Tying the bag with its va­lu­ab­les to her belt, she cal­led:</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Hiluro!</emphasis></p>
   <p>    The gi­gan­tic bird did not ap­pe­ar at on­ce, but Ha­ra­mis was not per­tur­bed. She sat down on a rock and ga­zed at the dis­tant Ci­ta­del, which had fi­nal­ly emer­ged from the slowly dis­sol­ving fog. Bon­fi­res must ha­ve be­en bur­ning wit­hin the in­ner wards and co­urt­yards, for the gre­at ke­ep and its adj­acent wings we­re brightly il­lu­mi­na­ted. From the flags­taff on the High To­wer flew the hu­ge La­bor­no­ki ban­ner, blo­od-red with three cros­sed gol­den swords. This was now al­so lit by fi­res bur­ning at its ba­se. It was al­most as if Volt­rik we­re sa­ying: <emphasis>He­re I am! Ta­ke back yo­ur cat­tle if you da­re</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    "Let my sis­ters win!" Ha­ra­mis ple­aded, grip­ping her ta­lis­man. "Ple­ase let them win."</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Haramis</emphasis>. She he­ard the fa­mi­li­ar vo­ice of her lam­mer­ge­i­er. <emphasis>I ha­ve se­en a di­re thing</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    Hiluro lan­ded as gently as a dark clo­ud, and she ran to him. "What is it?"</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Climb upon my back and I will show you.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    She did, and the cre­atu­re so­ared up­ward, then flew away along the mar­gin of the Knoll, to whe­re the thick Gre­en­mi­re met the Mu­tar Ri­ver be­yond Ru­wen­da Mar­ket. This re­gi­on was a lo­nely one, de­vo­id of ho­uses, for much of the Knoll in the vi­ci­nity was ba­re rock with only me­ager ve­ge­ta­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    The sky was cle­aring ra­pidly now, and the gro­und-fog al­most en­ti­rely blown away. The Trip­le Mo­ons we­re still thinly ve­iled, but eno­ugh light now re­ac­hed the gro­und that Ha­ra­mis co­uld see be­low myri­ad dark sha­dows emer­ging from the Mi­re in se­ve­ral stre­ams, then con­ver­ging in­to a sing­le mass as they mo­ved in the di­rec­ti­on of the Ci­ta­del ne­arly three le­agu­es away.</p>
   <p>    "But, what can they be? Su­rely the se­cond for­ce of the La­bor­no­ki army can­not ha­ve ar­ri­ved yet - "</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>They are Skri­tek, sum­mo­ned by the sor­ce­rer</emphasis>, the lam­mer­ge­i­er sa­id.</p>
   <p>    "Oh, Tri­une God! Of co­ur­se!"</p>
   <p>    Hiluro des­cen­ded, gli­ding just out of re­ach only a few ells abo­ve the gro­und, and Ha­ra­mis saw the fi­ends of the Mazy Mi­re, his­sing and snap­ping im­po­tently as the gre­at bird pas­sed over­he­ad.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>I can­not let them de­vo­ur my sis­ters' com­ra­des</emphasis>, Ha­ra­mis tho­ught in dis­may. <emphasis>What sho­uld I do</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    A vo­ice in her he­ad sa­id qu­i­etly, <emphasis>You are Lady of all Folk</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>But what do­es that me­an?</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>The Skri­tek are Folk,</emphasis></p>
   <p>    She un­ders­to­od then, and she knew what she must do. She sa­id: "Hi­lu­ro, land in front of them."</p>
   <p>    The bird ban­ked ste­eply and flew back. He set Ha­ra­mis on a mossy rock half a hund­red ells in ad­van­ce of the marc­hing mons­ters and to­ok up a po­si­ti­on be­hind her, gre­at wings outst­retc­hed. She put on the Arc­hi­ma­ge's clo­ak and wa­ited. The night-ke­en eyes of the Skri­tek spot­ted her qu­ickly, and they ca­me das­hing to­ward her how­ling and his­sing, mo­ving at such a pa­ce that she was cer­ta­in she wo­uld be tramp­led.</p>
   <p>    Instead they hal­ted, and fell si­lent, a scant sto­ne's throw away. She lif­ted her ta­lis­man and bes­po­ke them.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Who le­ads?</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Nine or ten of the shamb­ling, sca­led bru­tes ven­tu­red for­ward. The­ir jaws drip­ped stin­king sa­li­va and they clenc­hed and unc­lenc­hed the­ir ta­lons, and she per­ce­ived that the­ir slow bra­ins we­re all in a sta­te of tur­mo­il.</p>
   <p>    She sa­id, <emphasis>Do you know who I am</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>You we­re de­ad! He sa­id it. We knew it!</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>I am al­ways ali­ve, he­re in my co­untry. All Folk are my child­ren, all obey me. But you ha­ve not obe­yed. You fol­lo­wed the sor­ce­rer and went to war, which is for­bid­den.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>You did not spe­ak to us! You lost yo­ur po­wer! He pro­ved that when he cal­led us and you did not for­bid our go­ing!</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>I spe­ak now. Do you he­ar?</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>We do, Whi­te Lady.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    And every one of the gre­at as­semb­la­ge of Skri­tek fell upon the gro­und be­fo­re her, pe­ni­tently.</p>
   <p>    Haramis sa­id to the mons­ters, <emphasis>It was per­mit­ted for you to help the hu­man in­va­ders be­fo­re. But now, it is no lon­ger per­mit­ted. Do you un­der­s­tand</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Yes, Whi­te Lady</emphasis>. The res­pon­se inc­lu­ded many a bes­po­ken gro­an of disg­runt­le­ment, but it was no­net­he­less sin­ce­re.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Before you re­turn to the Mi­re, you will per­form a task for me.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    <emphasis>We are yo­urs to com­mand, Whi­te Lady.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    She exp­la­ined ca­re­ful­ly what they we­re to do, ma­king cer­ta­in that they un­ders­to­od that the­re was to be no wan­ton cru­elty. Alt­ho­ugh this was a ke­en di­sap­po­int­ment to the fi­ends, they we­re so­mew­hat che­ered at the pros­pect of even a lit­tle amu­se­ment, and ag­re­ed to do exactly as she had re­qu­es­ted.</p>
   <p>    Hearing this, she ga­ve them her bles­sing, mo­un­ted Hi­lu­ro, and flew away to me­et Oro­gas­tus at the Ci­ta­del.</p>
   <p>    King Volt­rik was not a comp­le­te fo­ol, and fa­irly early on had re­cog­ni­zed the bre­ach in his de­fen­ses po­sed by the old cis­tern tun­nel. But the La­bor­no­ki en­gi­ne­ers we­re af­ra­id to med­dle with it or with the well it­self, be­ca­use they we­re so­me­how con­nec­ted to the ma­in wa­ter­works of the Ci­ta­del. So Volt­rik co­uld not clo­se the ope­ning. But for ne­arly two we­eks the King had pos­ted sent­ri­es abo­ut the mo­uth of the an­ci­ent cis­tern, and set a re­lay of men all the way down the long se­ri­es of sta­ir­ways le­ading to it, so that word might be pas­sed up­ward ins­tantly if any Ru­wen­di­an in­va­der at­temp­ted to ga­in entry by the sub­ter­ra­ne­an ro­ute.</p>
   <p>    But the well-cham­ber was no­iso­me and glo­omy, in­fes­ted not only with the dis­gus­ting sli­me-dawd­lers but al­so with tho­se win­ged ani­mals of the night who­se ho­oting, warb­ling cri­es we­re so per­sis­tent as to dri­ve men half-crazy. And as the days pas­sed with no hu­man int­ru­ders de­tec­ted (but plenty of ghostly ones se­eming to lurk in the ma­lo­do­ro­us dark among the dec­re­pit pum­ping mac­hi­nery), the squ­ads of La­bor­no­ki sol­di­ers as­sig­ned to gu­ard the cis­tern withd­rew ins­te­ad to the an­ci­ent dun­ge­on one le­vel abo­ve.</p>
   <p>    There they used the­ir torc­hes to burn off the worst of the cre­eping things and in­ci­ne­ra­te the mo­ul­de­ring ske­le­tons; and with the re­ady con­ni­van­ce of the­ir watch-ser­ge­ants bro­ught down sto­ols, and ma­de a tab­le of the old tor­tu­re-bed, and en­li­ve­ned the­ir dre­ary vi­gils by pla­ying cards and qu­af­fing cont­ra­band be­er.</p>
   <p>    As fa­te wo­uld ha­ve it, at the mo­ment when the grap­ple-iron of the first in­va­ding Uis­gu clan­ked and dug in its ho­oks at the cis­tern's lip, a cer­ta­in La­bor­no­ki war­ri­or na­med Krug­dal was de­tec­ted che­ating in the ga­me, and his in­dig­nant com­ra­des to­ok hold of him to gi­ve him a drub­bing. The sol­di­ers' row co­ve­red the small no­ises ma­de by the fi­xing of the Uis­gu ro­pe-lad­ders. By the ti­me the luck­less Krug­dal was de­emed suf­fi­ci­ently pu­nis­hed, ne­arly forty Od­dlings un­der the com­mand of Prin­ce An­tar had swar­med in­to the cis­tern cham­ber and up the nar­row sta­irs.</p>
   <p>    The Prin­ce him­self, at­ti­red in his full knightly pa­noply, en­te­red the dun­ge­on and be­gan to be­ra­te the as­to­un­ded card-pla­yers for neg­lec­ting the­ir du­ti­es. The men we­re dumbst­ruck at se­e­ing the King's son ap­pe­ar as if from now­he­re, and kno­wing not­hing of his sup­po­sed tre­ason sto­od do­ci­le as he ton­gue-las­hed them. When the fi­er­ce Wyvi­lo and Uis­gu war­ri­ors po­ured in­to the ro­om the sol­di­ers we­re too stu­pe­fi­ed to re­sist or even cry out, and so they we­re easily bo­und and gag­ged and thrown in­to the old dun­ge­on cells.</p>
   <p>    Now the two Prin­ces­ses and the bat­tle-le­aders of the Uis­gu and Wyvi­lo com­pa­ni­es had a qu­ick co­un­cil-of-war.</p>
   <p>    It wo­uld ta­ke ti­me for the three hund­red or so in­va­ders to mo­unt the nar­row sta­ir­ways and re­ach the gro­und le­vel of the ke­ep, whe­re they might fight the­ir way to the ga­tes. From the cap­tu­red ser­ge­ant it was le­ar­ned that the re­lay of La­bor­no­ki strung out along the steps had a chan­ging of the gu­ard less than an ho­ur hen­ce.</p>
   <p>    "We must mo­unt the sta­irs be­fo­re this ti­me," Prin­cess Ka­di­ya as­ser­ted. "We shall ha­ve to sub­due the re­lay of fo­emen one at a ti­me, using the ut­most ca­re so that they do not ra­ise the alarm. One sho­ut, and we are un­do­ne."</p>
   <p>    A Uis­gu bat­tle-chi­ef­ta­in na­med Prebb sa­id: "I will ta­ke two of mi­ne. We will go soft as mi­re-mist and use blow­guns to down the foe."</p>
   <p>    "But if you are se­en by even one of them - " Prin­ce An­tar was du­bi­o­us. "You know that the ma­gic of the Prin­ces­ses has shi­el­ded us from the wi­zard's far­se­e­ing eye. But mor­tal men may re­adily see us."</p>
   <p>    Anigel sa­id: "I will ta­ke the darts and sub­due each gu­ard. My ta­lis­man will su­rely ren­der me in­vi­sib­le, as it did be­fo­re when I was in mor­tal dan­ger, so no fo­eman will ha­ve a chan­ce to cry a war­ning."</p>
   <p>    Antar was ag­hast, and tri­ed to for­bid her, as did all the ot­her le­aders. But she was as de­ter­mi­ned to go as she was po­si­ti­ve of her abi­lity to per­form the pe­ri­lo­us task. Ka­di­ya, clad from he­ad to toe in gol­den sca­le ma­il who­se lus­ter was ba­rely dim­med by the mud splas­hed upon it, step­ped for­ward and to­ok her yo­un­ger sis­ter by the hands.</p>
   <p>    "You are right, Ani. The mis­si­on is one you are best su­ited for, and no one shall deny you that which yo­ur co­ura­ge de­mands. Fa­ir for­tu­ne to you, Sis­ter mi­ne, and may no evil to­uch you."</p>
   <p>    Prebb to­ok a ban­do­li­er full of the small darts and dra­ped it over Ani­gel's sho­ul­ders. "You stick dart and le­ave it in pla­ce, man die," he sa­id. "You stick dart and ta­ke it out, man sle­ep for long ti­me but li­ve. But be­wa­re! Do not stick yo­ur­self."</p>
   <p>    "I un­ders­tand," Ani­gel sa­id, her fa­ce calm be­ne­ath the gle­aming co­ro­net.</p>
   <p>    "As you dis­patch each sentry," Ka­di­ya sa­id, "bes­pe­ak me. We will fol­low af­ter in a body, ke­eping far eno­ugh be­low you that no no­ise bet­rays our mo­ve­ments."</p>
   <p>    "My Prin­cess!" cri­ed An­tar, stric­ken. "I be­se­ech you - "</p>
   <p>    "No." She went to him and kis­sed him lightly on the lips, a ca­ress so fle­eting that it was ba­rely a to­uch at all. But it ca­used the Prin­ce's he­art to bla­ze li­ke a fan­ned em­ber, and pa­raly­zed his body so that it was a long mo­ment be­fo­re he co­uld vo­ice his ela­ti­on.</p>
   <p>    But by then Ani­gel was go­ne, and the Od­dling war­ri­ors we­re grin­ning at the Prin­ce, and Ka­di­ya sug­ges­ted rat­her tartly that they had bet­ter see how things fa­red down in the cis­tern cham­ber.</p>
   <p>    Anigel's only pra­yer and com­mand was a whis­pe­red: "Lords of the Air, de­fend me." And then she be­gan the long climb.</p>
   <p>    She ca­me upon the first gu­ard on a lan­ding a hund­red steps abo­ve, a lan­tern at his fe­et and his ar­ba­lest in his hands. He was a tall and well-bu­ilt yo­ung fel­low, clad li­ke most of the La­bor­no­ki men-at-arms in a ste­el-mesh ha­uberk and a pot-hel­met, and ar­med with a short-sword and ma­ce as well as a po­uch full of qu­ar­rels for his bow. He was whist­ling softly to pass the ti­me and ma­king bets with him­self which of two lin­gits cre­eping up the damp wall wo­uld re­ach the ce­iling first.</p>
   <p>    Anigel ca­me so­und­les­sly up to him and lif­ted a po­iso­ned dart with tremb­ling fin­gers. Whe­re sho­uld she stri­ke? He wo­re a he­avy shirt of qu­il­ted le­at­her be­ne­ath his ma­il, and his neck was shi­el­ded by hin­ged pla­tes dang­ling from his hel­met.</p>
   <p>    She told her­self: <emphasis>He will fall, and if he fall upon me or upon the dart, then I may not be ab­le to re­mo­ve it and he will die! Oh, I co­uld not be­ar it if he sho­uld die, for he lo­oks a bra­ve and co­mely yo­uth and is su­rely so­me mot­her's son</emphasis>…</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>And yo­ur mor­tal foe</emphasis>, a ve­xed lit­tle vo­ice se­emed to whis­per wit­hin her. <emphasis>Who wo­uld ra­pe and slay you wit­ho­ut thin­king twi­ce, co­uld he catch sight of you. For even tho­ugh he is not evil him­self, he will fol­low wit­ho­ut qu­es­ti­on the or­ders he has be­en gi­ven by evil men. And tho­se who cho­ose the war­ri­or ro­le must be pre­pa­red to en­du­re the war­ri­or's fa­te</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    Anigel felt her­self crin­ge, and re­ali­zed for the first ti­me that she al­so had cho­sen the war­ri­or's way, no mat­ter how she had tri­ed to con­vin­ce her­self that she wo­uld de­al with the enemy wit­ho­ut blo­ods­hed.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>If I had to kill him in cold blo­od-co­uld I?</emphasis></p>
   <p>    She to­ok a de­ep bre­ath and thrust the dart in­to the back of the man's hand. Pul­ling it out ins­tantly, she drop­ped it and shrank away from him. He ut­te­red a qu­eru­lo­us mur­mur, as of surp­ri­se, and his eyes rol­led in­to his skull and his kne­es fol­ded slowly. The cros­sbow fell and clat­te­red a ways down the slimy steps, and his helm clan­ked as he fell pro­ne on the sto­nes.</p>
   <p>    But he bre­at­hed. Ani­gel ma­de cer­ta­in of that be­fo­re bes­pe­aking Ka­di­ya. Then she hur­ri­ed up­ward to the next sentry, her he­art po­un­ding and her body in­fu­sed with a vi­gor that al­most sha­med her. Her fa­ti­gue and fe­ar fell away li­ke a dis­car­ded gar­ment. The eerie pas­sa­ge thro­ugh the muddy con­du­it and the ver­ti­gi­no­us climb up the swa­ying ro­pe-lad­der we­re for­got­ten. She was back in­si­de the Ci­ta­del, her ho­me, and at war with its des­po­ilers…</p>
   <p>    All in all, she dow­ned eigh­te­en of them. And then at last she re­ac­hed the bre­wery do­or, and lis­te­ned at it for a ti­me (not thin­king to vi­ew be­yond it by me­ans of her Sight), and he­aring not­hing she slip­ped thro­ugh -</p>
   <p>    And ca­me fa­ce to fa­ce with the Gre­en Vo­ice.</p>
   <p>    Naturally, he did not see her. But he did see the do­or open, and he felt the ill-smel­ling ex­ha­la­ti­on from the lo­wer cel­lars. He ut­te­red a co­lor­ful cur­se, and then chuck­led and sa­id:</p>
   <p>    "Yes, co­me ahe­ad, you bog-skip­ping scum, and get what is co­ming to you! Per­haps we can­not descry you, but thanks to my Al­mighty Mas­ter we can <emphasis>he­ar</emphasis> you co­ming very well -and on­ce yo­ur van­gu­ard re­ac­hes the top of the sta­irs, you will me­et the wel­co­me yo­ur rash­ness de­ser­ves!"</p>
   <p>    The Gre­en Vo­ice had his ho­od off, and co­ve­ring his ears we­re two obj­ects li­ke small caps with tiny things stud­ding them, and a band run­ning from one cap to the ot­her ac­ross the top of his skull.</p>
   <p>    But Ani­gel pa­id no at­ten­ti­on to this ma­gi­cal de­vi­ce. What se­ized her at­ten­ti­on was a mac­hi­ne that two sturdy La­bor­no­ki sol­di­ers we­re man­hand­ling in­to po­si­ti­on. It was a he­avy grey box with ro­un­ded cor­ners and comp­lex or­na­men­ta­ti­on on the top and back; and from the front prot­ru­ded a long, slen­der cylin­der of glass with many me­tal rings and rods strap­ped abo­ut it, and at its tip a pe­cu­li­ar thing ma­de of gold. A thick cord of so­me shiny black ma­te­ri­al led from this box to anot­her much lar­ger one, which sat on a whe­el­bar­row be­hind a lar­ge stack of full gra­in sacks six or se­ven ells away.</p>
   <p>    "Be ca­re­ful, fo­ol!" sa­id the Vo­ice to one of the sol­di­ers, who had stag­ge­red un­der the we­ight of the thing and ne­arly ca­used it to fall. "This and one ot­her are the only light­ning ge­ne­ra­tors left wor­king, and if you da­ma­ge it, my Al­mighty Mas­ter will flay the skin from yo­ur worth­less body and de­ep-fry you in se­et­hing oil!"</p>
   <p>    Anigel cho­ked back a hor­ri­fi­ed gasp. The light­ning of Oro­gas­tus ca­me from mac­hi­nes? And now the Gre­en Vo­ice was pre­pa­ring to aim this one down the sta­ir­ca­se whe­re Ka­di­ya and the­ir army we­re clim­bing up-</p>
   <p>    And Prin­ce An­tar.</p>
   <p>    Moving fe­dok-swift, Ani­gel pric­ked each sol­di­er in turn. As they fell, be­aring the we­apon gently to the sto­nes, and the used darts clin­ked down be­si­de them, the Gre­en Vo­ice to­ok alarm. Fa­mi­li­ar with ma­gic, he must ha­ve sen­sed that so­me­one in­vi­sib­le was the­re. He ho­is­ted up his ro­be and ran as fast as his legs co­uld carry him to­ward the lar­ge box on the bar­row.</p>
   <p>    Anigel ra­ced af­ter him and flung her­self upon his back. As he strug­gled to ma­ni­pu­la­te so­me pro­tu­be­ran­ce on the lar­ge box, the Prin­cess clutc­hed a fresh dart and plun­ged it with all her strength in­to the back of his neck.</p>
   <p>    He col­lap­sed atop the ma­gi­cal cont­ri­van­ce, inert as one of the gra­in sacks in the imp­ro­vi­sed bar­ri­ca­de. The stran­ge he­ad­pi­ece fell from his sha­ven he­ad. Slowly, Ani­gel pul­led away from him. She co­uld not ta­ke her eyes from the dart, and at first her hand re­ac­hed out to­ward it, only to fall back. She se­emed to he­ar words spo­ken long, long ago - or was it only fo­ur we­eks sin­ce?-when she and Ka­di­ya and Im­mu and Jagun lo­oked out over a thro­ne ro­om splas­hed with blo­od, and she had de­man­ded in her in­no­cen­ce an exp­la­na­ti­on of evil:</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Gentle folk may not sa­fely res­pond to them gently, be­ca­use evil­do­ers do not know what lo­ve is, mis­ta­king it for we­ak­ness. For this re­ason you, who are a gent­le and lo­ving Prin­ce­sess, must find a ster­ner way of de­aling with such ones…</emphasis></p>
   <p>    "And you are Oro­gas­tus's Vo­ice," she whis­pe­red. And sto­od over him sadly un­til Ka­di­ya and the ot­hers ca­me crow­ding in­to the bre­wery, by which ti­me the Gre­en Vo­ice was de­ad.</p>
   <p>    Then Ani­gel ba­de the Wyvi­lo le­ader Lum­mo­mu-Ko ta­ke his mas­si­ve axe and hack the light­ning-mac­hi­ne in­to pi­eces. When this was do­ne, the lit­tle army ma­de its way up to the gro­und le­vel of the Ci­ta­del, and the re­al bat­tle be­gan.</p>
   <p>    In ti­mes of pe­ace the gi­ant flat­bo­ats ser­ving the tra­ders we­re man­ned by crews of free Ru­wen­di­an oars­men who pri­ded them­sel­ves on the­ir strength and skill, and ear­ned high wa­ges for spe­eding the­ir awk­ward craft up and down the ri­vers. But with the con­qu­est, most ex­pe­ri­en­ced ri­ver­men elo­ped in­to the Mazy Mi­re; and the La­bor­no­ki, fa­ced with the im­mi­nent loss of cru­ci­al trans­port, spe­edily ens­la­ved tho­se who re­ma­ined and pres­sed in­to ser­vi­ce ot­her inex­pe­ri­en­ced Ru­wen­di­ans to fill the empty benc­hes. They we­re cha­ined to the­ir oars, fed po­orly, and whip­ped if they se­emed to shirk. But even at the best of ti­mes, the sla­ve-crews we­re far in­fe­ri­or to tho­se of free men, as both Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil and Lord Osor­kon had dis­co­ve­red on the­ir ill-fa­ted ex­pe­di­ti­on up the Mu­tar.</p>
   <p>    Now, when Osor­kon de­si­red to re­turn to the Ci­ta­del qu­ickly (kno­wing from con­ver­sa­ti­ons with the la­te Red Vo­ice that so­me se­ri­o­us misc­hi­ef was sche­du­led for the Fe­ast of the Three Mo­ons), the gre­at fle­et of bo­ats se­emed to mo­ve along ba­rely fas­ter than the cur­rent. Scan­da­lo­us num­bers of oars­men had di­ed un­der the lash sin­ce they had left the big en­camp­ment just be­low the Thorny Hell, and the rest we­re so mor­tal­ly ex­ha­us­ted that no amo­unt of flog­ging wo­uld spe­ed the­ir stro­ke.</p>
   <p>    Osorkon cal­led for the flags­hip's skip­per to jo­in him in the bows and de­man­ded so­me re­medy; but Pel­lan only sa­id, crin­ging: "My Ge­ne­ral, the ro­wers are do­ne in and col­lap­sing, and not­hing can ma­ke us go any fas­ter -unless you wish to fol­low my ear­li­er sug­ges­ti­on and rep­la­ce the sla­ves with sol­di­ers."</p>
   <p>    "Damn yo­ur so­ul, Pel­lan, we will lo­se even mo­re ti­me if we stop and unc­ha­in the oars­men so that my men can ta­ke the­ir pla­ces! And even then, they will ma­ke a botch of it. They know not­hing of ro­wing."</p>
   <p>    "What can I say?" The scrawny ri­ver­man did not lo­ok up. "The flo­od gi­ves us a fa­ir pa­ce. The­re is na­ught we can do but ri­de it."</p>
   <p>    Osorkon gro­und his te­eth but kept si­lent. He was a less im­pe­tu­o­us man than the la­te Ha­mil, who­se com­mand he had as­su­med, and he knew that Pel­lan told the truth. The flo­til­la wo­uld re­ach the Ci­ta­del even­tu­al­ly even if all the oars we­re stil­led. He cast an eye he­aven­ward, to­ward the bright fuzzy sme­ar that in­di­ca­ted the po­si­ti­on of the clo­ud-ve­iled Three Mo­ons. It was ne­ar to mid­night, and the fe­ast had be­gun at sun­down. Who knew what dark ma­gic the Witch-Prin­cess Ka­di­ya and her Uis­gu mob might be get­ting up to?</p>
   <p>    Turning his back on the ri­ver­man, the of­fi­cer stro­de up to the for­ward ra­il and sto­od the­re with his hands clas­ped be­hind his back. He was clo­aked and warmly dres­sed aga­inst the chill and damp, but had not don­ned his ar­mor. "What is yon ruddy glow in the sky, Ri­ver­man? Can it be that we are ap­pro­ac­hing the Knoll at long last?"</p>
   <p>    "Yes, my Ge­ne­ral. The docks of Ru­wen­da Mar­ket are a le­ague away. But you or­de­red us to pro­ce­ed to the Ci­ta­del Lan­ding it­self, and that is a full three le­agu­es fart­her by wa­ter -"</p>
   <p>    "Yes, yes, I know. How long be­fo­re we ar­ri­ve?"</p>
   <p>    "Less than an ho­ur." Pel­lan had ta­ken up a brass spyglass and now pe­ered thro­ugh it at the black ri­ver ahe­ad. "Stran­ge, the sur­fa­ce is gre­atly ro­iled up the­re. One wo­uld think the gi­ant mi­lin­gal-fish we­re spaw­ning, but it is the wrong ti­me of ye­ar."</p>
   <p>    Osorkon was im­me­di­ately alert. "Is it enemy wa­terc­raft?"</p>
   <p>    "Nay, not­hing of the sort. The­re is eno­ugh skylight for me to be su­re of that… And now the sa­me fer­ment is aff­lic­ting the wa­ters abe­am - <emphasis>Holy Flo­wer! Get back</emphasis>!"</p>
   <p>    A se­ri­es of tre­men­do­us splas­hes, ming­led with ha­ir-ra­ising ro­ars, split the night's calm­ness. Osor­kon saw ri­sing up abo­ve the bo­at's gun­wa­le a hu­ge he­ad with shi­ning oran­ge eyes and a grin­ning mo­uth that se­emed half an ell wi­de, stud­ded with te­eth li­ke whi­te kni­ves. A sto­mach-chur­ning stench smo­te him li­ke a physi­cal blow.</p>
   <p>    "Skritek!" Pel­lan shri­eked at the top of his lungs. But it was the last word he ever ut­te­red. The mons­ter clim­bed nimbly over the low ra­il, to­ok the ri­ver­man in his ta­lons, and snap­ped off his he­ad with a sing­le bi­te of his jaws.</p>
   <p>    Osorkon was be­si­de him­self with fe­ar and ra­ge, se­e­ing what his pu­ta­ti­ve ally had just do­ne. What was wor­se, all up and down the length of the big flo­til­la throngs of the fi­ends we­re bo­ar­ding bo­ats, and the scre­ams of ter­ri­fi­ed tro­ops now ming­led with in­hu­man ro­ars and who­ops.</p>
   <p>    "Stop!" Osor­kon cri­ed. "Hold off, you mis­be­got­ten corn­hol­ders! We are La­bor­no­ki! Yo­ur al­li­es! Yo­ur fri­ends!"</p>
   <p>    The Skri­tek who had de­ca­pi­ta­ted Pel­lan se­emed mo­men­ta­rily flum­mo­xed, as tho­ugh he had just re­cal­led so­met­hing im­por­tant that had slip­ped his mind. He how­led out a phra­se in his own lan­gu­age, to which his com­pat­ri­ots res­pon­ded with di­sap­po­in­ted gro­ans and ho­ots. Then he drop­ped Pel­lan's go­re-spo­uting body, se­ized Lord Osor­kon with par­ti­cu­lar ca­re, and flung him over the si­de.</p>
   <p>    The of­fi­cer sur­fa­ced so­on eno­ugh, co­ug­hing and gag­ging, only to be ne­arly bra­ined by an oar tra­iling limply in the wa­ter. He to­ok hold of it and clung for de­ar li­fe, and watc­hed dum­fo­un­ded as the mons­ters tos­sed each and every La­bor­no­ki in­to the muddy, swift-flo­wing wa­ter. The cha­ined Ru­wen­di­an oars­men they let be. A few ot­her Skri­tek ven­tu­red to nib­ble on the­ir vic­tims, but the­se we­re his­sed and ro­ared at by the­ir fel­lows un­til they de­sis­ted.</p>
   <p>    When all of the fi­ve tho­usand tro­ops we­re flung over­bo­ard, a very tall Skri­tek we­aring a col­lar and belt stud­ded with gold and gems­to­nes rip­ped down the ban­ner of La­bor­nok from its staff at the bow of the flags­hip and be­fo­uled it. All of the ot­her mons­ters how­led with la­ugh­ter, then jum­ped mer­rily in­to the ri­ver and swam away to­ward the Gre­en-mi­re sho­re.</p>
   <p>    When they we­re far dis­tant, Osor­kon cal­led out: "Ho! Do any knights or sol­di­ers of gre­at La­bor­nok yet li­ve?"</p>
   <p>    A few sco­re vo­ices res­pon­ded - so­me fe­ar­ful, ot­hers obs­ce­ne.</p>
   <p>    "Climb back in­to the bo­ats, my lads!" Osor­kon cri­ed. But as he spo­ke the Ru­wen­di­an ro­wers be­gan to sho­ut among them­sel­ves, fi­nal­ly re­ali­zing what had hap­pe­ned. The gre­at swe­eps dug in­to the wa­ter with alac­rity and the bo­ats be­gan to draw away from the flo­ating La­bor­no­ki.</p>
   <p>    Cursing and cho­king, Osor­kon clung li­ke a wa­ter-vart to his oar, we­igh­ting it down, and af­ter a mo­ment it dang­led limp aga­in from the row­lock. Even­tu­al­ly, he was ab­le to ma­ke his way to the ves­sel's si­de and climb back abo­ard, to­get­her with a do­zen or so ot­hers. Ar­ming them­sel­ves, they re­ga­ined cont­rol. Three ot­her bo­ats of the one hund­red and twenty that had left the Tre­vis­ta gar­ri­son we­re re­ta­ken, whi­le the ot­hers va­nis­hed in­to the night. The­se fo­ur craft, car­rying such war­ri­ors as co­uld be res­cu­ed, pul­led in­to the ma­in wharf of Ru­wen­da Mar­ket, whe­re they we­re gre­eted by the La­bor­no­ki dock­mas­ter and the cap­ta­in of the gu­ard.</p>
   <p>    "Fronials!" Lord Osor­kon ra­ged. "Fro­ni­als to carry us to the Ci­ta­del, or you are de­ad men!"</p>
   <p>    Mounts we­re spe­edily pro­cu­red, and Osor­kon led his for­ce off at a he­ad­long gal­lop along the Mar­ket Ro­ad to­ward the Ci­ta­del. Of his ori­gi­nal fi­ve tho­usand men, se­venty-two re­ma­ined.</p>

   <p>    Hiluro flew to the Ci­ta­del's High To­wer and aligh­ted the­re. Dis­mo­un­ting and emb­ra­cing the gre­at he­ad of the bird, Ha­ra­mis sa­id: "I do not know if we will me­et aga­in, but ta­ke my bles­sing with you as you fly away. You ha­ve be­en a true and lo­ving fri­end."</p>
   <p>    The bird inc­li­ned its be­ak al­most to the sto­nes. <emphasis>I am ever at yo­ur ser­vi­ce, Whi­te Lady</emphasis>. Then he so­ared off in­to the sky, whe­re rag­ged clo­uds now ra­ced and a high over­cast on­ce aga­in ve­iled the Trip­le Mo­ons.</p>
   <p>    Haramis lif­ted the trap­do­or, no­ting that it had be­en re­pa­ired sin­ce her de­par­tu­re, and des­cen­ded the lad­der. The­re we­re only a few gu­ards on the to­wer le­vels whe­re the tre­asu­res we­re kept, but they se­emed not to no­ti­ce as she went past. Mo­re sol­di­ers pat­rol­led the cor­ri­dor le­ading to the mid-le­vels of the cent­ral ke­ep, and she al­so ca­me upon a gro­up of fi­ve La­bor­no­ki knights, sta­ring mo­odily out a win­dow that over­lo­oked the ri­ver; but no­ne of the­se men se­emed to see her.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>It is as tho­ugh I we­re a ghost, ha­un­ting my for­mer ho­me</emphasis>, she tho­ught to her­self. <emphasis>Has Oro­gas­tus com­man­ded them all to ig­no­re me, or do­es my ta­lis­man shi­eld me from sight</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Am I to be only a spec­ta­tor in this conf­lict, stan­ding alo­of as the Whi­te Lady al­ways se­emed to do? What is my part in the ful­fil­lment of the prop­hecy?</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Finally, she re­ac­hed the so­lar. The ro­om had be­en pre­pa­red for her. A fi­re bur­ned, and the scon­ces had cand­les lit, and the­re was a fla­gon of wi­ne and crystal gob­lets on a small tab­le next to the open bal­cony win­dows.</p>
   <p>    She went to lo­ok out­si­de, and her he­art sank at the sce­ne that met her eyes. Ran­ged abo­ut the gre­at fo­re­co­urt of the in­ner ward we­re tho­usands of war­ri­ors - men-at-arms wa­iting in or­derly ranks, knights prow­ling among them ins­pec­ting we­aponry or simply stan­ding aro­und the gre­at bon­fi­res that had be­en ligh­ted. Ne­ar the Ma­in Ga­te­ho­use, sto­ut bar­ri­ca­des had be­en erec­ted; and perc­hed upon the cent­ral one was a stran­ge mac­hi­ne ten­ded by black-co­ated mi­ni­ons who ser­ved the sor­ce­rer. On mas­si­ve high plat­forms, flan­king the ent­ran­ce to the ke­ep it­self, we­re fo­ur ot­her mac­hi­nes and the­ir ope­ra­tors. Along the bat­tle­ments of the in­ner and outer wards and the bar­bi­can we­re li­nes of cros­sbow­men, and ca­ta­pult crews we­re re­ady with mis­si­les and en­gi­nes at the bas­ti­ons. The Ci­ta­del Ga­te that ope­ned to the ro­ad out­si­de was now comp­le­tely bloc­ked by a gre­at pi­le of rub­ble that clog­ged its Ga­te­ho­use to the raf­ters.</p>
   <p>    "Hopeless," Ha­ra­mis whis­pe­red. "Ho­pe­less." And she tur­ned away, just as Oro­gas­tus en­te­red the ro­om.</p>
   <p>    He was clad in his sil­ver-and-black vest­ments and a starry sil­ver he­ad­pi­ece; but this mask was dif­fe­rent from that which he had worn to wors­hip the Dark Po­wers, for it enc­lo­sed his en­ti­re he­ad and hid his fa­ce comp­le­tely. Even the eye­ho­les we­re gla­zed over with black glass, and his as­pect was so me­na­cing that she gas­ped alo­ud.</p>
   <p>    The two of them sto­od un­mo­ving, re­gar­ding one anot­her. From so­me de­ep and dis­tant part of the ke­ep, a small so­und aro­se that Ha­ra­mis co­uld not iden­tify.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus un­fas­te­ned his he­ad­pi­ece and to­ok it off, set­ting it and his sil­ver ga­unt­lets on one of the benc­hes next to the fi­re.</p>
   <p>    "You ha­ve ma­de yo­ur cho­ice," he sa­id slowly, "and you ha­ve not cho­sen me."</p>
   <p>    No.</p>
   <p>    "I cho­se my path long ago," he sa­id. "And I can­not now turn away."</p>
   <p>    "I know."</p>
   <p>    From a poc­ket in his ro­be he to­ok a small wo­oden box in­ci­sed with grim car­vings, which he ope­ned, re­ve­aling a gre­en ball. Ha­ra­mis sta­red at this, un­comp­re­hen­ding. She was dimly awa­re that the no­ises that had be­gun shortly be­fo­re we­re now inc­re­asing in vo­lu­me. They we­re the sho­uts and tu­mult of figh­ting go­ing on so­mew­he­re in the lo­wer le­vels of the Ci­ta­del.</p>
   <p>    "This is cal­led the Do­om­ful Eff­lu­vi­um." Oro­gas­tus put the thing away, his exp­res­si­on now uns­mi­ling and imp­la­cab­le. "If I fling it down from on high every so­ul wit­hin the in­ner and outer wards, and even be­yond, will die in uns­pe­akab­le tor­ment. Call upon Ka­di­ya and Ani­gel to sur­ren­der the­ir li­ves and the­ir ta­lis­mans to you. <emphasis>To us!</emphasis>"</p>
   <p>    He se­ized her and kis­sed her with a strength that ne­ared fe­ro­city. Then he snatc­hed up his ga­unt­lets and star-mask and went out, slam­ming the do­or.</p>
   <p>    "No," Ha­ra­mis whis­pe­red. "No!" She was­ted no mo­re ti­me, but to­ok out her ta­lis­man to vi­ew Ka­di­ya and Ani­gel and the­ir in­va­ding for­ce. The Circ­le did not this ti­me grow pe­arly; ins­te­ad it glo­wed and se­emed to ex­pand and en­gulf her wit­hin it - and she se­emed to ho­ver high abo­ve the kitc­hen of the ke­ep, whe­re a mob of tall and hi­de­o­us Wyvi­lo, ur­ged on by Prin­ce An­tar, pres­sed in­to a fal­te­ring for­ce of La­bor­no­ki war­ri­ors and knights. He­wing abo­ut with long-haf­ted axes and inf­lic­ting a fe­ar­ful car­na­ge, the fo­rest Folk de­mo­ra­li­zed the­ir op­po­nents as well as dest­ro­yed them. And as the fo­emen fell or ret­re­ated and the Wyvi­lo cle­ared the way, tiny sca­le-armo­red Uis­gu with crim­son-rin­ged eyes ag­low po­ured forth from the in­ner cor­ri­dors li­ke a ti­de of mol­ten gold, scre­ec­hing and flin­ging spe­ars as so­on as they had ro­om eno­ugh to ma­ne­uver.</p>
   <p>    The in­va­ders pas­sed qu­ickly from the de­mo­lis­hed kitc­hens in­to the ba­kery and the scul­lery, and from the­re be­gan to swarm in­to the open area of the in­ner ward, whe­re the ma­in body of de­fen­ders awa­ited them, yel­ling and bran­dis­hing the­ir we­apons.</p>
   <p>    At first, Ha­ra­mis co­uld not find her sis­ters. But fi­nal­ly she saw Ka­di­ya, a gold-ma­iled fi­gu­re slightly tal­ler than the Uis­gu, ur­ging the small war­ri­ors on and hol­ding her ta­lis­man on high. And then she ma­de out Ani­gel, clad in blue le­at­her, who se­emed to shim­mer in the un­cer­ta­in light, and who sta­yed clo­se to the azu­re-armo­red Prin­ce An­tar. Whe­ne­ver an enemy ca­me at An­tar from be­hind, Ani­gel po­un­ced upon the man and at­tac­ked him with so­me small we­apon, whe­re­upon the luck­less La­bor­no­ki wo­uld drop ins­tantly in his tracks.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Why, Ani­gel is in­vi­sib­le</emphasis>! Ha­ra­mis re­ali­zed. <emphasis>That is why she can at­tack tho­se bru­tes with im­pu­nity. Ka­di­ya must al­so be scre­ened by her ta­lis­man. And they ac­tu­al­ly se­em to be win­ning</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    It was true. But on­ce the in­va­ders emer­ged from the kitc­hen cham­bers in­to the open ward, the ad­van­ta­ge qu­ickly swung the ot­her way. The small for­ce of the figh­ting Prin­ces­ses was out­num­be­red by mo­re than fif­te­en to one, and the sor­ce­rer's lac­keys we­re at that mo­ment wrest­ling with the­ir in­fer­nal de­vi­ces, swin­ging them abo­ut so that they co­uld be­ar upon the area in front of the scul­lery do­or.</p>
   <p>    Haramis snap­ped out of her tran­ce and ran to the bal­cony, whe­re she co­uld lo­ok be­low and see the conf­lict with her own eyes. She bes­po­ke her sis­ters ur­gently thro­ugh her ta­lis­man:</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Kadiya! The Light­ning-mac­hi­ne is on the bar­ri­ca­de ne­arest the Ma­in Ga­te­ho­use! Bre­ak it! Or bet­ter yet, use it to blast thro­ugh the ga­tes, thro­ugh the mo­und of rub­ble that the La­bor­no­ki ha­ve used to block the outer ent­ran­ce to the Ci­ta­del!</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Kadiya ma­de no reply; but Ha­ra­mis saw a sing­le gold-clad fi­gu­re co­me das­hing out from among the mob of Uis­gu, and go sna­king thro­ugh the yel­ling mass of knights with the bon­fi­res gle­aming on her fish-sca­le ar­mor.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Anigel! Ne­ar the ke­ep's ma­in do­or are wo­oden plat­forms</emphasis> -</p>
   <p>    But be­fo­re she co­uld fi­nish, the sor­ce­rer's lac­keys be­gan to use the­ir de­adly we­apons. Gol­den-whi­te balls of fi­re flew from two of the mac­hi­nes in­to the throng of in­va­ders, and whe­re they struck, they clung to skin or ar­mor and inf­lic­ted hor­rib­le burns. From two ot­her de­vi­ces, which ma­de a fe­ar­ful rac­ket, po­ured a ha­il of me­tal pel­lets tra­iling red sparks. The­se pe­net­ra­ted flesh and bo­ne as easily as ske­wers pi­er­ce mush­ro­oms, and tho­se struck by the ter­rib­le things fell mor­tal­ly wo­un­ded, if they we­re not kil­led on the spot.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>I see the we­apons, Ha­ra­mis! I am on my way</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Anigel</emphasis>! Ha­ra­mis bit her lip ner­vo­usly. <emphasis>Be ca­re­ful! Even tho­ugh they can­not see you -</emphasis></p>
   <p>    But at that mo­ment Ha­ra­mis stag­ge­red and was half blin­ded as the light­ning-flin­ger let lo­ose a tre­men­do­us bolt. The thun­de­ring blast ca­used even the ke­ep to tremb­le, and the wi­ne de­can­ter and crystal gob­lets on the tab­le be­hind her fell to the flo­or and smas­hed.</p>
   <p>    When her vi­si­on cle­ared, she lif­ted her ta­lis­man for a vi­ew thro­ugh the dark­ness and the clo­ud of smo­ke and dust. She was ama­zed to see that al­most the en­ti­re gre­at Ga­te­ho­use had be­en blas­ted to bits. What was mo­re, the path of dest­ruc­ti­on had con­ti­nu­ed in a stra­ight li­ne, de­mo­lis­hing the ga­te of the outer ward and that of the bar­bi­can. The mo­und of rub­ble at the ma­in ent­ran­ce of the Ci­ta­del was lar­ger than ever… but the mas­si­ve pi­ers that had sup­por­ted the ga­tes and a fo­ur-ell sec­ti­on of the wall on eit­her si­de we­re crumb­ling to frag­ments as she watc­hed.</p>
   <p>    And Ka­di­ya-</p>
   <p>    "God ha­ve mercy!" Ha­ra­mis cri­ed.</p>
   <p>    Atop the bar­ri­ca­de, the light­ning de­vi­ce was a blac­ke­ned and twis­ted ru­in. Ne­ar to it we­re three smol­de­ring corp­ses that had on­ce be­en the sor­ce­rer's hench­men, and a sing­le small fi­gu­re clad all in gold, lying un­mo­ving among them, a po­int­less sword still grip­ped in one hand. <emphasis>Ka­di­ya must ha­ve dest­ro­yed the de­vi­ce with her ta­lis­man</emphasis>, Ha­ra­mis tho­ught, <emphasis>but I did not re­ali­ze she co­uld be hurt do­ing it! I must warn Ani­gel</emphasis>…</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>The fo­ol</emphasis>! The spe­ech wit­ho­ut words rin­ging in her mind, Ha­ra­mis re­ali­zed, co­uld only be co­ming from Oro­gas­tus. <emphasis>She has used the en­ti­re ca­pa­city of the de­vi­ce in a sing­le stro­ke! The de­fen­ses are down and the enemy is on its way ac­ross the ri­ver</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    Haramis saw him be­low her. He sto­od on a small pa­ra­pet just abo­ve the ke­ep's ent­ran­ce, the sil­ver star­burst of his he­ad­pi­ece flas­hing as the smo­ke cle­ared and the do­zens of small fi­res set by the thun­der­bolt brigh­te­ned in the ri­sing wind. His vo­ice, mag­ni­fi­ed by so­me ma­gic, cal­led out li­ke a trum­pet to the stun­ned La­bor­no­ki war­ri­ors, who had no no­ti­on of what was hap­pe­ning.</p>
   <p>    "Stand fast! Men of La­bor­nok, stand fast!"</p>
   <p>    From be­hind the sor­ce­rer now step­ped King Volt­rik, in his gor­ge­o­us gol­den ar­mor with its awe­so­me fan­ged helm, his long-sword held high. At the sight of him, the tro­ops be­low ut­te­red a gre­at che­er, and the figh­ting bet­we­en them and the in­va­ding Wyvi­lo and UJs­gu, which had bro­ken off ab­ruptly when the gre­at exp­lo­si­on oc­cur­red, now be­gan aga­in.</p>
   <p>    But sud­denly Prin­ce An­tar cal­led out, lo­udly eno­ugh to ra­ise ec­ho­es in the ward.</p>
   <p>    "Men of La­bor­nok, do not lis­ten to that de­mon! I am An­tar, yo­ur Prin­ce! And I say that Oro­gas­tus has be­witc­hed my fat­her and tur­ned him in­to a bra­in­less pup­pet!"</p>
   <p>    A growl aro­se from a tho­usand thro­ats.</p>
   <p>    "Be si­lent, tra­itor!" ro­ared Oro­gas­tus.</p>
   <p>    But ot­her vo­ices we­re sho­uting: "He's right! The Prin­ce is right! Lo­ok how the King just stands the­re!" And one cri­ed: "Why isn't the King out he­re, le­ading us him­self?" And anot­her: "Stand forth, Volt­rik! Spe­ak to us!" The­re we­re mo­re and mo­re sho­uts, un­til Oro­gas­tus lif­ted both his hands, and his eyes fla­red li­ke twin stars.</p>
   <p>    Silence fell.</p>
   <p>    King Volt­rik knew he wo­uld ha­ve to spe­ak. But what co­uld he say? His co­ura­ge was a thing in rags, his gre­at am­bi­ti­ons fled li­ke silly dre­ams. Re­ality was the Ru­wen­di­an army bre­aking in­to the Ci­ta­del in spi­te of all the ma­gic Oro­gas­tus pit­ted aga­inst it. Re­ality was the vo­ices of his own men wa­ve­ring in the­ir lo­yalty. Re­ality was his des­pi­sed son An­tar def­ying him openly. Re­ality, abo­ve all, was the fa­ilu­re of Oro­gas­tus to dest­roy the three Prin­cess-Witc­hes, one of whom was fa­ted to dest­roy him…</p>
   <p>    "Soldiers of La­bor­nok, fight on! Fight, I say!" But the King's vo­ice was mo­re a cro­ak than a cla­ri­on com­mand. "It is my wretc­hed son who is be­witc­hed. Stri­ke down the turn­co­at!"</p>
   <p>    This ut­te­ran­ce of his, far from en­co­ura­ging the knights and men, ca­used them to cla­mor lo­uder than be­fo­re. And Prin­ce An­tar yel­led: "To me, sons of La­bor­nok! Down with the sor­ce­rer! To me, I say!"</p>
   <p>    The figh­ting be­gan aga­in in ear­nest then; and in spi­te of Oro­gas­tus's bo­oming ad­mo­ni­ti­ons, num­bers of the La­bor­no­ki to­re off the­ir scar­let sur­co­ats and ral­li­ed to the si­de of the Prin­ce and his de­ci­ma­ted for­ce.</p>
   <p>    In the con­fu­si­on, hardly an­yo­ne - and cer­ta­inly not the fu­ri­o­us Oro­gas­tus- no­ti­ced that tho­se black-clad men who ope­ra­ted the ter­rib­le fla­me-mac­hi­nes and the pel­let-spe­wing mac­hi­nes had slum­ped down sen­se­less atop the­ir tall plat­forms. Only Ha­ra­mis, open-mo­ut­hed at her lit­tle sis­ter's te­me­rity, saw Ani­gel fling the last dart and be­gin to wrest­le the he­avy mac­hi­nes to the ed­ge of the ne­ar plat­form and top­ple them to the flags­to­nes fi­ve ells be­low, whe­re they smas­hed in­to pi­eces.</p>
   <p>    When Oro­gas­tus re­ali­zed what was hap­pe­ning, he ro­ared for sol­di­ers to climb the se­cond plat­form qu­ickly, and de­fend the aban­do­ned mac­hi­nes the­re with the­ir li­ves. But the men now saw that the sor­ce­rer's hench­men up abo­ve had be­en fel­led by so­me ma­gic, and the self­sa­me ma­gic was ob­vi­o­usly still at work, for in­vi­sib­le be­ings we­re thro­wing things down upon them. So no one wo­uld mo­ve, and Ani­gel con­ti­nu­ed from the first plat­form to the se­cond and fi­nis­hed dest­ro­ying the we­apons that the sor­ce­rer had usur­ped from the Va­nis­hed Ones.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Well do­ne</emphasis>! Ha­ra­mis cong­ra­tu­la­ted her sis­ter. <emphasis>But now we must help Ka­di­ya</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    Anigel was jubi­lant. <emphasis>Was it not mar­ve­lo­us, the way she flung the thun­der­bolt? My ta­lis­man sho­wed me a vi­si­on of our army co­ming as­ho­re at Ci­ta­del Lan­ding even now</emphasis>-<emphasis>and they will ha­ve easy entry thro­ugh the bro­ken wall</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>Anigel, Ka­di­ya?s be­en hurt. Go to her. I am on my way down to help.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Haramis ca­ught up the Crown of Ru­wen­da and the clo­ak of the Arc­hi­ma­ge, and hur­ri­ed down to aid her sis­ters.</p>
   <p>    "There! The­re, my Li­ege -can you not see her?"</p>
   <p>    Orogastus po­in­ted thro­ugh the lu­rid murk to the bar­ri­ca­de be­fo­re the ru­ined Ga­te­ho­use. King Volt­rik stra­ined his eyes, and fi­nal­ly sa­id: "Yes. We­aring so­me kind of gol­den ar­mor, is she?"</p>
   <p>    "Exactly! And knoc­ked sen­se­less by the de­mo­li­ti­on of my light­ning-mac­hi­ne, so that she can­not com­mand the ta­lis­man. Prin­cess Ka­di­ya is no lon­ger in­vi­sib­le and no lon­ger pro­tec­ted! She is in yo­ur po­wer! All you ne­ed do is has­ten the­re and put an end to her be­fo­re she re­co­vers - or is res­cu­ed by her pe­op­le."</p>
   <p>    "I?" The King fal­te­red. "Go down the­re?"</p>
   <p>    "Are you af­ra­id of an un­cons­ci­o­us girl?" The sor­ce­rer's vo­ice be­ca­me sil­ken, per­su­asi­ve. "The­re are no fo­emen anyw­he­re ne­ar her, my King, only yo­ur own tro­ops, who wo­uld be af­ra­id to to­uch her. But you can ma­ke an end of her! Yo­ur gre­atest enemy! Ka­di­ya is the mar­ti­al Prin­cess, the wo­man of the prop­hecy. She slew Ge­ne­ral Ha­mil and ro­uted half our army, and ins­ti­ga­ted this bat­tle. But she has not won! We still ha­ve ne­arly fi­ve tho­usand se­aso­ned tro­ops to co­un­ter the ap­pro­ac­hing rab­ble, and the­ir fe­ma­le ge­ne­ral li­es the­re awa­iting yo­ur sword!"</p>
   <p>    "That's true." Volt­rik drew him­self up. "Much go­od her ma­gic will do her now!"</p>
   <p>    "Go, my Li­ege. Kill her, then or­der yo­ur men to ad­van­ce upon the Ci­ta­del bar­bi­can. Cut down the in­va­ders as they at­tempt to scramb­le over the ru­ins."</p>
   <p>    "The witch shall die!" Volt­rik bel­lo­wed. "And as I hold up her se­ve­red he­ad, you shall an­no­un­ce my de­ed with yo­ur vo­ice of thun­der!"</p>
   <p>    Orogastus step­ped to the pa­ra­pet ed­ge and cri­ed out: "Men of La­bor­nok! Yo­ur King co­mes now to le­ad you to vic­tory! To the bar­bi­can with you! Pre­pa­re for the fi­nal en­co­un­ter with the foe!"</p>
   <p>    There we­re scat­te­red che­ers.</p>
   <p>    "You know, we re­al­ly do se­em to ha­ve ga­ined the up­per hand down the­re." The King grin­ned at the sor­ce­rer. "Most of tho­se sco­und­rels who ca­me up thro­ugh the dun­ge­ons se­em to ha­ve fal­len."</p>
   <p>    "Your tra­ito­ro­us son An­tar is gat­he­ring par­ti­sans whi­le you stand he­re, my King. Go down! Kill Ka­di­ya first, then rally the men."</p>
   <p>    "To vic­tory!" Volt­rik ro­ared. He snap­ped shut the fan­ged vi­sor of his ter­rib­le gol­den helm.</p>
   <p>    "Go," sa­id Oro­gas­tus we­arily. "Go."</p>
   <p>    When the mo­narch fi­nal­ly tram­ped off down the sta­ir­way, the sor­ce­rer ga­ve a gre­at sigh. Re­mo­ving one ga­unt­let, he re­ac­hed in­to an in­ner poc­ket of his ro­be and to­uc­hed the wo­oden box con­ta­ining the de­adly glo­be, at the sa­me ti­nue for­ming an uns­po­ken pra­yer to the Dark Po­wers.</p>
   <p>    Would Volt­rik be ab­le to kill Ka­di­ya? Or wo­uld her ta­lis­man de­al with the King as it had witlh Ha­mil and the Red Vo­ice? The chan­ce was worth ta­king. If Volt­rik. ma­na­ged to suc­ce­ed, then it might not be ne­ces­sary af­ter all to wi­pe tte sla­te cle­an…</p>
   <p>    Orogastus sto­od and sur­ve­yed the ad­van­cing enemy for­ce-which had just be­en aug­men­ted by the he­avily ar­med Ru­wen­di­an bri­ga­des of Co­unt Pa­lun­do. And then lie se­arc­hed the dark­ness of the Ci­ta­del's in­ner ward, se­eking wha­te­ver clu­es the­re might be to the whe­re­abo­uts of the ot­her two Prin­ces­ses.</p>
   <p>    He saw ne­it­her Ani­gel nor Ha­ra­mis, but only a lit­tle old Od­dling wo­man, pic­king her way thro­ugh the tu­mult and the butc­hery as if se­arc­hing for so­me­one.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Forty-Six</strong></p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    Immu stumb­led thro­ugh the bat­tle sce­ne, co­ug­hing from the smo­ke, trip­ping over the de­ad bo­di­es of fri­ends and fo­es, dod­ging aro­und the me­le­es and hand-to-hand com­bat that ma­de of the in­ner ward a hell of blo­od and iron.</p>
   <p>    "Anigel!" she cal­led. "Prin­cess, whe­re are you?"</p>
   <p>    But when she qu­es­ti­oned wo­un­ded Wyvi­lo or Uis­gu abo­ut her ro­yal mist­ress, no­ne of tho­se who had strength to reply knew, for they did not know that Prin­cess Ani­gel fo­ught among them in­vi­sib­le.</p>
   <p>    Immu saw King Volt­rik emer­ge from the ke­ep and call to him­self a body of knights, af­ter which he he­aded al­most stra­ight to­ward her.</p>
   <p>    The figh­ting se­emed sud­denly to fall in­to a lull. Fol­lo­wing the or­ders of Oro­gas­tus and the­ir com­man­ders, most of the La­bor­no­ki we­re now stre­aming to­ward the ru­ined bar­bi­can and the Ci­ta­del Ga­te, reg­ro­uping to re­pel the ad­van­ce of the ma­in in­va­ding for­ce now rus­hing up from the ri­ver.</p>
   <p>    But the King, it se­emed, had anot­her obj­ec­ti­ve in mind.</p>
   <p>    "The witch!" Volt­rik was sho­uting. "With me, men! I must kill the witch!"</p>
   <p>    He had be­si­de him Lord Osor­kon, who had ar­ri­ved just in ti­me for the bat­tle, and Sir Ri­nu­tar, who had co­me to the Ci­ta­del the night be­fo­re with news of the in­va­ders, and two ot­her knights na­med Lo-tha­ron and Sim­ba­lik.</p>
   <p>    The King and the­se fo­ur pus­hed thro­ugh the mo­ving crowd of de­fen­ders, thrust up the­ir vi­sors to see bet­ter in the smoky cha­os, and be­gan to clam­ber awk­wardly up the bar­ri­ca­de to whe­re Prin­cess Ka­di­ya still lay sen­se­less.</p>
   <p>    Immu saw her, too. And with all the agi­lity her old bo­nes co­uld mus­ter, she clim­bed pa­in­ful­ly up the op­po­si­te end of the smo­king struc­tu­re and ran pan­ting along its top to­ward the pla­ce whe­re the gol­den-armo­red form lay.</p>
   <p>    Invisible hands we­re easing off the sca­le-ma­il ho­od from Ka­di­ya's he­ad. And Im­mu cle­arly he­ard a tre­mu­lo­us vo­ice call out: "Ka­di! Ple­ase wa­ke up, Ka­di!"</p>
   <p>    The Nysso­mu wo­man cri­ed out: "Ani­gel! Are you the­re, my dar­ling? "</p>
   <p>    The gol­den-ha­ired Prin­cess ap­pe­ared ab­ruptly as she re­mo­ved her co­ro­net. "Immu! Co­me qu­ickly! Ka­di bre­at­hes, but I fe­ar she is wo­un­ded."</p>
   <p>    "Two of them!" ca­me a harsh sho­ut. "Gre­at Zo­to, both witc­hes are he­re!"</p>
   <p>    King Volt­rik and his fo­ur knights ga­ined the bar­ri­ca­de crest at that ins­tant. Knoc­king Im­mu flat, the mo­narch se­ized Prin­cess Ani­gel by the ha­ir, drag­ging her from her sis­ter's si­de, and ra­ised his sword to her thro­at. Her co­ro­net ta­lis­man spun from her hand, lan­ding on the char­red planks with a dull chi­ming so­und. Im­me­di­ately the glow of its tril­li­um am­ber win­ked out.</p>
   <p>    Simbalik and Lot­ha­ron ha­uled Ka­di­ya up­right. The sword­li­ke obj­ect fell from her flac­cid fin­gers, and its am­ber al­so went dull. But her eyes ope­ned slowly, and met tho­se of her sis­ter.</p>
   <p>    "Men of La­bor­nok!" King Volt­rik sho­uted, in a trans­port of exal­ta­ti­on. "Be­hold! Two of the witc­hes who thre­ate­ned the thro­ne of our gre­at co­untry are in my hands!"</p>
   <p>    A gre­at ro­ar aro­se from the throng of sol­di­ers, and from the pa­ra­pet abo­ve the ke­ep ent­ran­ce Oro­gas­tus's vo­ice bo­omed. "Ha­il, Volt­rik! Ha­il, all-con­qu­ering King! Show us the re­ward of tho­se who wo­uld op­po­se yo­ur ru­le!"</p>
   <p>    During this com­mo­ti­on, Im­mu had be­en cre­eping to­ward Ani­gel's fal­len co­ro­net. Now she po­un­ced on it li­ke a lot­hok and tos­sed it in­to Ani­gel's wa­iting hand a scant mo­ment be­fo­re an­yo­ne saw her. Two men se­ized the old nur­se and pre­pa­red to fling her he­ad­long from the high bar­ri­ca­de.</p>
   <p>    Anigel, still with Volt­rik's sword at her thro­at, cri­ed out lo­udly: "Harm her, and you are de­ad men."</p>
   <p>    The tril­li­um am­ber in the co­ro­net bla­zed li­ke a pitch-brand, and the men hol­ding Im­mu fro­ze. King Volt­rik sa­id fran­ti­cal­ly: "The ot­her ma­gic ta­lis­man! That Dark Sword the­re! Se­ize it!"</p>
   <p>    "Wait!" Osor­kon shri­eked, for he re­cog­ni­zed the obj­ect and the dan­ger in it.</p>
   <p>    But Ri­nu­tar had al­re­ady lo­osed his hold on Im­mu and bent to pick up Ka­di­ya's ta­lis­man. As he did so, Ka­di­ya's hand stretc­hed out and to­uc­hed the hilt an ins­tant be­fo­re the knight did. The Three-Lo­bed Bur­ning Eye ope­ned wi­de and its be­ams sho­ne full on Ri­nu­tar's fa­ce.</p>
   <p>    His ar­mor tur­ned in­can­des­cent. He had not ti­me to cry out or even stra­igh­ten be­fo­re the flesh burnt from his skull, which glo­wed bright as ste­el in a for­ge. As Volt­rik and his men cri­ed out in fe­ar and hor­ror, the bur­ning knight lurc­hed and rol­led to the lip of the bar­ri­ca­de, and fell to the ward pa­ve­ment li­ke a hu­man me­te­or.</p>
   <p>    Now the­re was pan­de­mo­ni­um among tho­se watc­hing. But Volt­rik, to do him cre­dit, had not mo­ved his sword a rin­ger's bre­adth from Ani­gel's thro­at, even tho­ugh cold swe­at stung his eyes, and his he­art thud­ded fit to burst.</p>
   <p>    Anigel tur­ned her he­ad to lo­ok up at him. "Re­le­ase us. You are de­fe­ated. Sur­ren­der and throw yo­ur­self upon our mercy."</p>
   <p>    Voltrik how­led with hyste­ri­cal la­ugh­ter. "Nay, Witch! First yo­ur sis­ter shall die, and then you!"</p>
   <p>    "My King!" Lord Osor­kon po­in­ted down, his fa­ce dis­tor­ted with ter­ror. "The Dark Sword - <emphasis>it mo­ved</emphasis>!"</p>
   <p>    Gaping, Volt­rik and his com­pa­ni­ons watc­hed the Three-Lo­bed Bur­ning Eye ri­se slowly from Ka­di­ya's hand, ho­ve­ring at wa­ist le­vel. Prin­cess Ani­gel se­emed un­per­tur­bed by the sight. She ope­ned her own hand, and the co­ro­net flo­ated away to me­et the po­int­less end of the ot­her ta­lis­man.</p>
   <p><strong><emphasis>"NO!"</emphasis></strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>    The thun­de­ring cry of des­pa­ir ca­me from Oro­gas­tus, on the pa­ra­pet abo­ve. But it was too la­te.</p>
   <p>    Princess Ha­ra­mis be­ca­me vi­sib­le, stan­ding bet­we­en her two pi­ni­oned sis­ters. The Crown of Ru­wen­da on her he­ad spark­led in the fi­re­light and the clo­ak of the Arc­hi­ma­ge bil­lo­wed abo­ut her. Ta­king her own ta­lis­man, she slip­ped the wand in­to a chan­nel in the sword-bla­de, so that the Three-Win­ged Circ­le for­med a me­ri­di­an and equ­ator with the Three-He­aded Mons­ter. Wit­hin this spa­ce the wings ope­ned; and a gre­at Black Tril­li­um in am­ber was at the cen­ter.</p>
   <p>    Orogastus lif­ted high so­met­hing that gle­amed gre­en. Then he flung it with all his strength to­ward the co­urt­yard sto­nes.</p>
   <p>    Haramis po­in­ted the Scept­re of Po­wer - and the flying glo­be of the Do­om­ful Eff­lu­vi­um fla­red and va­nis­hed in a puff of whi­te smo­ke.</p>
   <p>    Now she tur­ned to the two knights hol­ding Ka­di­ya. The girl's dark eyes we­re alert and her musc­les ten­sed for a strug­gle.</p>
   <p>    "Release her!" Ha­ra­mis com­man­ded. But the men he­si­ta­ted.</p>
   <p>    "Let her go, fo­ols!" Osor­kon cri­ed.</p>
   <p>    "No!" King Volt­rik scre­amed. "I for­bid it!"</p>
   <p>    Seeing the two knights stif­fen and stand firm, Ha­ra­mis mo­ved de­li­be­ra­tely, but with re­luc­tan­ce, po­in­ting first at Lot­ha­ron, then at Sim-ba­lik, with the Scept­re.</p>
   <p>    This ti­me the ar­mor did not fla­me. But wit­hin each vi­sor blue-whi­te ra­di­an­ces blo­omed for a split se­cond; and when it fla­red out, each helm was empty, as was the rest of the ar­mor. Two su­its of ste­el clat­te­red in pi­eces to the planks.</p>
   <p>    King Volt­rik ga­ve a thro­at-se­aring shri­ek and drop­ped both Ani­gel and his sword. He fell to his kne­es. "Mercy! Lady, ha­ve mercy!"</p>
   <p>    Haramis po­in­ted the Scept­re at him calmly. "Re­ce­ive as much mercy as you ha­ve ever gi­ven, and let the prop­hecy be ful­fil­led."</p>
   <p>    Glazen-eyed, the kne­eling King re­mo­ved his monst­ro­us hel­met. He bo­wed his he­ad low. As the throng watc­hed in hus­hed awe, Volt­rik's own sword ro­se up, and its po­int thrust de­eply in­to the ba­se of his skull. He fell, with the we­apon pin­ning him to the wo­od be­ne­ath.</p>
   <p>    All over the em­bat­tled Ci­ta­del, a so­und aro­se li­ke a low mur­mur of storm-tos­sed tre­es. On the bar­ri­ca­de, Lord Osor­kon la­id his sword at Ha­ra­mis's fe­et and knelt with ba­red he­ad. Then the­re was <emphasis>a</emphasis>. clat­te­ring and clan­king as, all over the gre­at ward, the knights and sol­di­ers of La­bor­nok threw down the­ir we­apons and sto­od numb, wa­iting to see what wo­uld hap­pen next.</p>
   <p>    Haramis fa­ced Oro­gas­tus ac­ross the wi­de co­urt­yard. He had re­mo­ved his star-mask, and his whi­te ha­ir stre­amed in the ri­sing wind. The smo­ke and dust we­re car­ri­ed off, and tho­se fi­res that still bur­ned bla­zed brigh­ter for the air fan­ning them. Over all, the sky was cle­ared of clo­ud, and the Trip­le Mo­ons sto­od in clo­se co­nj­unc­ti­on mid­way bet­we­en the ze­nith and the wes­tern ho­ri­zon, se­eming to to­uch and form a sing­le Orb with three lo­bes.</p>
   <p>    Haramis lif­ted the Scept­re and po­in­ted it at Oro­gas­tus.</p>
   <p>    "Now let our li­ves and our ser­vi­ce be jud­ged," she sa­id. "Ha­ve we ful­fil­led what was re­qu­ired of us? Ha­ve we do­ne right? Ha­ve we ac­ted to res­to­re the ba­lan­ce? Jud­ge us, and jud­ge him, al­so."</p>
   <p>    Orogastus grip­ped the pa­ra­pet's ed­ge in both hands, and his te­eth we­re set as his eyes aga­in sho­ne star-li­ke with the ter­rib­le bril­li­an­ce of ma­gic. The spec­ta­tors ut­te­red cri­es of fe­ar.</p>
   <p>    Prince An­tar, ap­pe­aring as if from now­he­re, to­ok Prin­cess Ani­gel in his arms. Lit­tle Im­mu sto­od be­si­de Ka­di­ya, the pa­ir of them ste­ad­fast.</p>
   <p>    "Haramis!" Oro­gas­tus sho­uted, his vo­ice still amp­li­fi­ed by wha­te­ver de­vi­ce he was using. "I can dest­roy you yet! I can sum­mon the Dark Po­wers and mo­ve the very earth!"</p>
   <p>    Haramis clo­sed her eyes, hol­ding tight to the Scept­re; but in her mind she still co­uld see his fa­ce. <emphasis>This isn't wor­king</emphasis>, she re­ali­zed. <emphasis>The Scept­re must ne­ed all three of us</emphasis>. "Ka­di­ya, Ani­gel," she sa­id ur­gently, "help me! Ta­ke hold of the Scept­re and con­cent­ra­te!" She felt her sis­ters clo­se in at her si­des and the­ir hands jo­ined hers on the Scept­re.</p>
   <p>    The po­wer in it fla­red sud­denly to full li­fe. It bo­und them all to­get­her: Ha­ra­mis, Ka­di­ya, and Ani­gel at one end, and Oro­gas­tus at the ot­her. It glo­wed with a bright­ness that blin­ded physi­cal eyes, even thro­ugh clo­sed eye­lids; but so­me­how, Ha­ra­mis re­ali­zed, she co­uld still see. Ka­di­ya and Ani­gel we­re at her si­des, so clo­se they se­emed part of her, and Oro­gas­tus conf­ron­ted them along the length of the Scept­re. And in the bright po­wer that held them, all il­lu­si­on was bur­ned away, and they saw them­sel­ves and each ot­her as they truly we­re.</p>
   <p>    It was ter­rif­ying. Ha­ra­mis fo­und her­self awa­re of all the ti­mes she had hurt pe­op­le, even inad­ver­tently, the ti­mes she had lo­oked down on her sis­ters as les­ser cre­atu­res, es­pe­ci­al­ly in cont­rast to the be­a­uty and strength she saw in them now. She co­uld fe­el the sa­me emo­ti­ons in both of them: reg­ret for all the­ir past fa­ilu­res and mis­ta­kes, and awe at what they saw in each ot­her. But aro­und and thro­ugh the tho­ughts and me­mo­ri­es flo­wed the sis­ters' lo­ve for one anot­her. Ha­ra­mis un­ders­to­od now, and she knew that her sis­ters did too; in a cer­ta­in man­ner the three of them ma­de one who­le en­tity, the­ir strengths and we­ak­nes­ses comp­le­men­ting and can­ce­ling out each ot­her's. In spi­te of the­ir in­di­vi­du­al dif­fe­ren­ces - or per­haps be­ca­use of them-they we­re one, and they we­re Ru­wen­da.</p>
   <p>    <emphasis>This must be what Bi­nah me­ant by ba­lan­ce.</emphasis></p>
   <p>    Orogastus was per­cep­tib­le to Ha­ra­mis as well, but the fe­eling was to­tal­ly dif­fe­rent. The clo­se­ness she had felt to him when he had held her in his arms was comp­le­tely go­ne; what she sen­sed now was his iso­la­ti­on - to­tal and ter­rif­ying. He had no con­nec­ti­on with Ru­wen­da or any ot­her land, or with any of the Folk, and - in spi­te of what had pas­sed bet­we­en them - he had no con­nec­ti­on with Ha­ra­mis.</p>
   <p>    He se­emed to be loc­ked in­si­de him­self, ex­pe­ri­en­cing hor­rors that the Prin­ces­ses co­uld only dimly sen­se. Ha­ra­mis hurt for him, even now, and she co­uld fe­el Ani­gel's re­ady com­pas­si­on ex­ten­ding in his di­rec­ti­on as well; but Oro­gas­tus was awa­re of not­hing out­si­de him­self. And his self se­emed to be unen­du­rab­le.</p>
   <p>    Haramis po­in­ted the Scept­re at Oro­gas­tus. "Jud­ge us," she whis­pe­red. "Jud­ge him."</p>
   <p>    Again the Scept­re fla­red.</p>
   <p>    All of them we­re mo­men­ta­rily blin­ded, and so many per­sons scre­amed from the shock that it was many long mi­nu­tes be­fo­re they re­ali­zed that the sor­ce­rer was go­ne.</p>
   <p>    All that re­ma­ined of him was a gre­at black splash li­ke so­ot aga­inst the ke­ep wall whe­re he had sto­od, and on it, high abo­ve the pa­ra­pet, the whi­te sil­ho­u­et­te of a tall man's body.</p>
   <p>    That ye­ar, for the first ti­me, the Fe­ast of the Three Mo­ons was ce­leb­ra­ted three days la­te, post­po­ned so that the inj­ured co­uld be ca­red for and the de­ad re­ce­ive the­ir ri­tes of ho­nor. But on the third eve­ning fol­lo­wing that of the gre­at bat­tle, when the Trip­le Mo­ons in the­ir full co­nj­unc­ti­on ro­se abo­ve the Mazy Mi­re, all of the Folk cam­ped ro­und abo­ut the Knoll, and all of the Ru­wen­di­an and La­bor­no­ki hu­mans as well, ca­me to­get­her on­ce aga­in in the gre­at in­ner ward of the an­ci­ent Ci­ta­del.</p>
   <p>    The Uis­gu marc­hed in first, led by Prin­cess Ka­di­ya, car­rying three-branc­hed torc­hes and sin­ging the­ir an­ci­ent fes­ti­val song; then fol­lo­wed the gent­le Nysso­mu, he­aded by Jagun and Im­mu; and the sur­vi­ving Wyvi­lo, marc­hing be­hind Lum­mo­mu-Ko. Then ca­me the La­bor­no­ki, with the­ir new King, An­tar, wal­king unar­mo­red and car­rying only flo­wers in the­ir hands; and last of all the army of free Ru­wen­di­ans, led by Co­unt Pa­lun­do, who had with him as many knights and nob­les as co­uld be sum­mo­ned by Folk pas­sing the news thro­ugh the Mi­re by me­ans of the spe­ech wit­ho­ut words.</p>
   <p>    Haramis, crow­ned and clo­aked and be­aring the gre­at Scept­re, wel­co­med them. An­tar ca­me for­ward and knelt at her fe­et, to of­fer his na­ti­on's for­mal sur­ren­der.</p>
   <p>    But Ha­ra­mis sa­id: "Ri­se up, King An­tar, for I can­not ac­cept yo­ur ca­pi­tu­la­ti­on." She to­ok from her he­ad the gre­at Crown of Sta­te and held it high. "I who was he­iress to the thro­ne of Ru­wen­da now re­no­un­ce this Crown. I call upon Prin­cess Ka­di­ya, my next yo­un­ger sis­ter, to ac­cept it - for I ha­ve be­en cal­led to a dif­fe­rent ro­le, that of Arc­hi­ma­ge."</p>
   <p>    Kadiya sto­od at the he­ad of the gre­at throng of abo­ri­gi­nes, the tril­li­um emb­lem glo­wing on the bre­ast of her gol­den ma­il, and her auburn ha­ir fal­ling free over her sho­ul­ders. She sa­id:</p>
   <p>    "I al­so re­no­un­ce the Crown, for my des­tiny is not to be a ru­ler of hu­mans, but a le­ader and fri­end to the Folk, who ha­ve be­so­ught me to ser­ve them. I call upon Prin­cess Ani­gel, my yo­un­ger sis­ter, to ac­cept the Crown she has so richly me­ri­ted."</p>
   <p>    Anigel clo­sed her eyes bri­efly, se­e­ing aga­in that stran­ge dre­am vi­si­on of her­self run­ning thro­ugh a fo­rest in pur­su­it of her Mot­her. And ha­ving this ti­me ca­ught up to Qu­e­en Ka­lant­he, she no lon­ger felt ap­pre­hen­si­on as her Mot­her was­hed and dres­sed and pre­pa­red her. That which awa­ited had be­en truly hers from the be­gin­ning.</p>
   <p>    She al­so knew that, of the three, she was the best su­ited to we­ar the Crown. She ope­ned her eyes, wal­ked to Ha­ra­mis, and knelt with her he­ad held high. When the gre­at Crown with its eme­ralds and ru­bi­es and hu­ge drop of tril­li­um am­ber res­ted on her he­ad, she ro­se, tur­ned slowly abo­ut, and sketc­hed the three-lo­bed sign in the air abo­ve tho­se watc­hing.</p>
   <p>    Antar was still stan­ding by, and now knelt to her. "Will you ac­cept my sur­ren­der, Gre­at Qu­e­en?"</p>
   <p>    "But it is mi­ne al­re­ady," she sa­id, smi­ling, "to­get­her, I ho­pe, with yo­ur he­art. And sin­ce I am a Qu­e­en who can­not ru­le wit­ho­ut a King, I pro­po­se that we ru­le our king­doms jo­intly as hus­band and wi­fe, in per­pe­tu­al pe­ace." She to­ok his hands and ma­de him ri­se and stand be­si­de her.</p>
   <p>    "People of Ru­wen­da," sa­id she, "I gi­ve you yo­ur King."</p>
   <p>    And he sa­id: "Pe­op­le of La­bor­nok, I gi­ve you yo­ur Qu­e­en!"</p>
   <p>    A gre­at tu­mult of che­ering and we­eping bro­ke out then, and the Folk sang the­ir hymn aga­in, and gre­at qu­an­ti­ti­es of fo­od and drink we­re bro­ught out; and the re­al ce­leb­ra­ti­on be­gan.</p>
   <p>    Standing clo­se to­get­her, the sis­ters emb­ra­ced. Then Ha­ra­mis to­ok the Scept­re of Po­wer and so­lemnly se­pa­ra­ted it. The po­int­less sword, its Eyes now clo­sed in sle­ep, she ga­ve to Ka­di­ya, who slip­ped it in­to the scab­bard she wo­re and ti­ed it in pla­ce with a lan­yard. The sil­very co­ro­net with the three gro­tes­que vi­sa­ges Ani­gel mo­un­ted in­si­de the Crown of Ru­wen­da, which she then re­set­tled upon her gol­den ha­ir. The wand, with its wings fol­ded and the tril­li­um am­ber glo­wing only dimly, Ha­ra­mis rep­la­ced on the cha­in aro­und her neck.</p>
   <p>    "We we­re One," Ha­ra­mis sa­id, "and now we are aga­in Three. Ple­ase God that the world has be­en re­ba­lan­ced, and the Scept­re of Po­wer will ne­ver be ne­eded aga­in."</p>
   <p>    "By the Flo­wer!" Ka­di­ya grow­led. "I sho­uld ho­pe not! Pe­ace is what we all ne­ed. Just think of how much we three all still ha­ve to le­arn! Ani, the te­di­o­us sta­tec­raft, Ka­ra the ma­gic, and I in­tend to go back to a cer­ta­in Pla­ce of Le­ar­ning and put so­me very im­por­tant qu­es­ti­ons to a be­ing who re­si­des the­re. The­re are knotty prob­lems to be sol­ved con­cer­ning the fu­tu­re re­la­ti­ons bet­we­en Folk and hu­man­kind, and I sus­pect it will ta­ke so­me ti­me to sort out the ans­wers!"</p>
   <p>    Anigel as­ked Ha­ra­mis: "Will you call yo­ur lam­mer­ge­i­er af­ter the fe­ast, Sis­ter, and fly away to li­ve in Noth as the old Whi­te Lady did?"</p>
   <p>    Haramis lo­oked away, and for a mo­ment her ga­ze pas­sed over the pa­ra­pet abo­ve the ent­ran­ce to the ke­ep. "No. That pla­ce fell to dust when Bi­nah di­ed. I shall go to anot­her pla­ce - one that I know of, high in the mo­un­ta­ins."</p>
   <p>    Antar ca­me up to the three then, smi­ling apo­lo­ge­ti­cal­ly as he told Ani­gel that the­ir jo­int as­semb­la­ge of su­bj­ects de­man­ded that the mon-archs le­ad them in fes­ti­ve dan­ce.</p>
   <p>    "The ter­rib­le du­ti­es of so­ve­re­ignty!" Ka­di­ya la­ug­hed. "Go along, Qu­e­en Ani­gel. The Arc­hi­ma­ge and I will con­ti­nue our we­ighty dis­cus­si­ons over fo­od and drink, and when Yo­ur Ma­j­es­ti­es ha­ve dan­ced ho­les in yo­ur sho­es, you can re­j­o­in us."</p>
   <p>    Hand in hand, Ani­gel and An­tar went away; and the mu­sic be­gan.</p>
   <p>    Hurrying ac­ross the twi­lit Knoll me­adow to­ward the Ci­ta­del, the old mu­si­ci­an Uzun he­ard the so­unds of ce­leb­ra­ti­on and qu­ic­ke­ned his pa­ce. He co­uld hardly be­li­eve his ears. Su­rely tho­se we­re the songs of Trip­le Mo­ons! But had not the fes­ti­val ta­ken pla­ce three days ago, whi­le he and the ot­hers on his bo­at we­re stal­led on the ri­ver­si­de re­pa­iring the bro­ken hull? He had mis­sed the gre­at bat­tle; mis­sed the vic­tory; mis­sed se­e­ing his de­ar Prin­cess Ha­ra­mis dest­roy the vil­la­in Oro­gas­tus - mis­sed <emphasis>ever­y­t­hing</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>    Or had he? Oh, if only he we­ren't so in­com­pe­tent at the spe­ech wit­ho­ut words!</p>
   <p>    Those we­re cer­ta­inly the fes­ti­val hymns, and the so­unds of mer­ri­ment flo­ating on the night bre­eze al­most drow­ned out the cal­ling of the swamp cre­atu­res. What a mi­rac­le! He wo­uld be in ti­me af­ter all -</p>
   <p>    Something on the mo­on­lit gro­und ca­ught his eye.</p>
   <p>    He stop­ped, and bent down for a bet­ter lo­ok. The so­il was very damp yet from the early Ra­ins, and all kinds of fresh growth se­emed to ha­ve sprung up, vir­tu­al­ly over­night. But this was so­met­hing dif­fe­rent. So­met­hing he co­uld scar­cely be­li­eve was re­al. So­met­hing ma­gi­cal…</p>
   <p>    Myriad small plants we­re gro­wing in this pla­ce that had on­ce fos­te­red only grass and sed­ge. Plants with small black tri­par­ti­te flo­wers.</p>
   <p>    Uzun the mu­si­ci­an pic­ked one of the Black Tril­li­ums, and held it up to the mo­on­light. Yes! The­re was no do­ubt abo­ut it. The pla­ce was crow­ded with them. They we­re everyw­he­re.</p>
   <p>    Laughing gid­dily, he gat­he­red as many of the flo­wers as he co­uld carry, and ra­ced off to tell the go­od news to the pe­op­le at the Ci­ta­del. Tho­usands mo­re of the tril­li­ums re­ma­ined, spre­ading the­ir pe­tals be­ne­ath the light of the Trip­le Mo­ons.</p>
