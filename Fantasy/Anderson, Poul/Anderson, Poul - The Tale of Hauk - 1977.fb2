   <p>The Tale of Hauk</p>
  </title>
  <section>
   <p>A man called Geirolf dwelt on the Great Fjord in Raumsdal. His father was Bui Hardhand, who owned a farm inland near the Dofra Fell. One year Bui went in viking to Finnmark and brought back a woman he dubbed Gydha. She became the mother of Geirolf. But because Bui al­ready had children by his wife, there would be small inheritance for this by-blow.</p>
   <p>Folk said uncanny things about Gydha. She was fair to see, but spoke little, did no more work than she must, dwelt by herself in a shack out of sight of the garth, and often went for long stridings alone on the upland heaths, heedless of cold, rain, and rovers. Bui did not visit her often. Her son Geirolf did. He too was a moody sort, not much given to playing with others, quick and harsh of temper. Big and strong, he went abroad with his father already when he was twelve, and in the next few years won the name of a mighty though ruthless fighter.</p>
   <p>Then Gydha died. They buried her near her shack, and it was whis­pered that she spooked around it of nights. Soon after, walking home with some men by moonlight from a feast at a neighbor’s, Bui clutched his breast and fell dead. They wondered if Gydha had called him, maybe to accompany her home to Finnmark, for there was no more sight of her.</p>
   <p>Geirolf bargained with his kin and got the price of a ship for himself. Thereafter he gathered a crew, mostly younger sons and a wild lot, and fared west. For a long while he harried Scotland, Ireland, and the coasts south of the Channel, and won much booty. With some of this he bought his farm on the Great Fjord. Meanwhile he courted Thyra, a daughter of the yeoman Sigtryg Einarsson, and got her.</p>
   <p>They had one son early on, Hauk, a bright and lively lad. But there­after five years went by until they had a daughter who lived, Unn, and two years later a boy they called Einar. Geirolf was in viking every sum­mer, and sometimes wintered over in the Westlands. Yet he was a kindly father, whose children were always glad to see him come roaring home. Very tall and broad in the shoulders, he had long red-brown hair and a full beard around a broad blunt-nosed face whose eyes were ice blue and slanted. He liked fine clothes and heavy gold rings, which he also lavished on Thyra.</p>
   <p>Then the time came when Geirolf said he felt poorly and would not fare elsewhere that season. Hauk was fourteen years old and had been wild to go. “I’ll keep my promise to you as well as may be,” Geirolf said, and sent men asking around. The best he could do was get his son a bench on a ship belonging to Ottar the Wide-Faring from Haalogaland in the north, who was trading along the coast and meant to do likewise over­seas.</p>
   <p>Hauk and Ottar took well to each other. In England, the man got the boy prime-signed so he could deal with Christians. Though neither was baptized, what he heard while they wintered there made Hauk thought­ful. Next spring they fared south to trade among the Moors, and did not come home until late fall.</p>
   <p>Ottar was Geirolf’s guest for a while, though he scowled to himself when his host broke into fits of deep coughing. He offered to take Hauk along on his voyages from now on and start the youth toward a good liveli­hood.</p>
   <p>“You a chapman—the son of a viking?” Geirolf sneered. He had grown surly of late.</p>
   <p>Hauk flushed. “You’ve heard what we did to those vikings who set on <emphasis>us,” </emphasis>he answered.</p>
   <p>“Give our son his head,” was Thyra’s smiling rede, “or he’ll take the bit between his teeth.”</p>
   <p>The upshot was that Geirolf grumbled agreement, and Hauk fared off. He did not come back for five years.</p>
   <p>Long were the journeys he took with Ottar. By ship and horse, they made their way to Uppsala in Svithjodh, thence into the wilderness of the Keel after pelts; amber they got on the windy strands of Jutland, salt her­ring along the Sound; seeking beeswax, honey, and tallow, they pushed beyond Holmgard to the fair at Kiev; walrus ivory lured them past North Cape, through bergs and floes to the land of the fur-clad Biarmians; and they bore many goods west. They did not hide that the wish to see what was new to them drove them as hard as any hope of gain.</p>
   <p>In those days King Harald Fairhair went widely about in Norway, bringing all the land under himself. Lesser kings and chieftains must ei­ther plight faith to him or meet his wrath; it crushed whomever would stand fast. When he entered Raumsdal, he sent men from garth to garth as was his wont, to say he wanted oaths and warriors.</p>
   <p>“My older son is abroad,” Geirolf told these, “and my younger still a stripling. As for myself—” He coughed, and blood flecked his beard. The king’s men did not press the matter.</p>
   <p>But now Geirolf’s moods grew ever worse. He snarled at everybody, cuffed his children and housefolk, once drew a dagger and stabbed to death a thrall who chanced to spill some soup on him. When Thyra reproached him for this, he said only, “Let them know I am not altogeth­er hallowed out. I can still wield blade.” And he looked at her so threateningly from beneath his shaggy brows that she, no coward, with­drew in silence.</p>
   <p>A year later, Hauk Geirolfsson returned to visit his parents.</p>
   <p>That was on a chill fall noontide. Whitecaps chopped beneath a whistling wind and cast spindrift salty onto lips. Clifftops on either side of the fjord were lost in mist. Above blew cloud wrack like smoke. Hauk’s ship, a wide-beamed knorr, rolled, pitched, and creaked as it beat its way under sail. The owner stood in the bows, wrapped in a flame-red cloak, an uncommonly big young man, yellow hair tossing around a face akin to his father’s, weatherbeaten though still scant of beard. When he saw the arm of the fjord that he wanted to enter, he pointed with a spear at whose head he had bound a silk pennon. When he saw Disafoss pour­ing in a white stream down the blue-gray stone wall to larboard, and be­yond the waterfall at the end of that arm lay his old home, he shouted for happiness.</p>
   <p>Geirolf had rich holdings. The hall bulked over all else, heavy-timbered, brightly painted, dragon heads arching from rafters and gables. Else­where around the yard were cookhouse, smokehouse, bathhouse, store­houses, workshop, stables, barns, women’s bower. Several cabins for hirelings and their families were strewn beyond. Fishing boats lay on the strand near a shed which held the master’s dragonship. Behind the steading, land sloped sharply upward through a narrow dale, where fields were walled with stones grubbed out of them and now stubbled after harvest. A bronze-leaved oakenshaw stood untouched not far from the buildings; and a mile inland, where hills humped themselves toward the mountains, rose a darkling wall of pinewood.</p>
   <p>Spearheads and helmets glimmered ashore. But men saw it was a sin­gle craft bound their way, white shield on the mast. As the hull slipped alongside the little wharf, they lowered their weapons. Hauk sprang from bow to dock in a single leap and whooped.</p>
   <p>Geirolf trod forth. “Is that you, my son?” he called. His voice was hoarse from coughing; he had grown gaunt and sunken-eyed; the ax that he bore shivered in his hand.</p>
   <p>“Yes, father, yes, home again,” Hauk stammered. He could not hide his shock.</p>
   <p>Maybe this drove Geirolf to anger. Nobody knew; he had become impossible to get along with. “I could well-nigh have hoped otherwise,” he rasped. “An unfriend would give me something better than straw-death.”</p>
   <p>The rest of the men, housecarls and thralls alike, flocked about Hauk to bid him welcome. Among them was a burly, grizzled yeoman whom he knew from aforetime, Leif Egilsson, a neighbor come to dicker for a horse. When he was small, Hauk had often wended his way over a wood­land trail to Leif’s garth to play with the children there.</p>
   <p>He called his crew to him. They were not just Norse, but had among them Danes, Swedes, and English, gathered together over the years as he found them trustworthy. “You brought a mickle for me to feed,” Geirolf said. Luckily, the wind bore his words from all but Hauk. “Where’s your master Ottar?”</p>
   <p>The young man stiffened. “He’s my friend, never my master,” he answered. “This is my own ship, bought with my own earnings. Ottar abides in England this year. The West Saxons have a new king, one Al­fred, whom he wants to get to know.”</p>
   <p>“Time was when it was enough to know how to get sword past a Westman’s shield,” Geirolf grumbled.</p>
   <p>Seeing peace down by the water, women and children hastened from the hall to meet the newcomers. At their head went Thyra. She was tall and deep-bosomed; her gown blew around a form still straight and freely striding. But as she neared, Hauk saw that the gold of her braids was dimmed and sorrow had furrowed her face. Nonetheless she kindled when she knew him. “Oh, thrice welcome, Hauk!” she said low. “How long can you bide with us?”</p>
   <p>After his father’s greeting, it had been in his mind to say he must soon be off. But when he spied who walked behind his mother, he said, “We thought we might be guests here the winter through, if that’s not too much of a burden.”</p>
   <p>“Never—” began Thyra. Then she saw where his gaze had gone, and suddenly she smiled.</p>
   <p>Alfhild Leifsdottir had joined her widowed father on this visit. She was two years younger than Hauk, but they had been glad of each other as playmates. Today she stood a maiden grown, lissome in a blue wadmal gown, heavily crowned with red locks above great green eyes, straight nose, and gently curved mouth. Though he had known many a woman, none struck him as being so fair.</p>
   <p>He grinned at her and let his cloak flap open to show his finery of broidered, fur-lined tunic, linen shirt and breeks, chased leather boots, gold on arms and neck and sword-hilt. She paid them less heed than she did him when they spoke.</p>
   <p>Thus Hauk and his men moved to Geirolf’s hall. He brought plentiful gifts, there was ample food and drink, and their tales of strange lands— their songs, dances, games, jests, manners—made them good housefellows in these lengthening nights.</p>
   <p>Already on the next morning, he walked out with Alfhild. Rain had cleared the air, heaven and fjord sparkled, wavelets chuckled beneath a cool breeze from the woods. Nobody else was on the strand where they went.</p>
   <p>“So you grow mighty as a chapman, Hauk,” Alfhild teased. “Have you never gone in viking…only once, only to please your father?”</p>
   <p>“No,” he answered gravely. “I fail to see what manliness lies in falling on those too weak to defend themselves. We traders must be stronger and more war-skilled than any who may seek to plunder us.” A thick branch of driftwood, bleached and hardened, lay nearby. Hauk picked it up and snapped it between his hands. Two other men would have had trouble doing that. It gladdened him to see Alfhild glow at the sight. “Nobody has tried us twice,” he said.</p>
   <p>They passed the shed where Geirolf’s dragon lay on rollers. Hauk opened the door for a peek at the remembered slim shape. A sharp whiff from the gloom within brought his nose wrinkling. “Whew!” he snorted. “Dry rot.”</p>
   <p>“Poor <emphasis>Fireworm </emphasis>has long lain idle,” Alfhild sighed. “In later years, your father’s illness has gnawed him till he doesn’t even see to the care of his ship. He knows he will never take it a-roving again.”</p>
   <p>“I feared that,” Hauk murmured.</p>
   <p>“We grieve for him on our own garth too,” she said. “In former days, he was a staunch friend to us. Now we bear with his ways, yes, insults that would make my father draw blade on anybody else.”</p>
   <p>“That is dear of you,” Hauk said, staring straight before him. “I’m very thankful.”</p>
   <p>“You have not much cause for that, have you?” she asked. “I mean, you’ve been away so long…Of course, you have your mother. She’s borne the brunt, stood like a shield before your siblings—” She touched her lips. “I talk too much.”</p>
   <p>“You talk as a friend,” he blurted. “May we always be friends.”</p>
   <p>They wandered on, along a path from shore to fields. It went by the shaw. Through boles and boughs and falling leaves, they saw Thor’s image and altar among the trees. “I’ll make offering here for my father’s health,” Hauk said, “though truth to tell, I’ve more faith in my own strength than in any gods.”</p>
   <p>“You have seen lands where strange gods rule,” she nodded.</p>
   <p>“Yes, and there too, they do not steer things well,” he said. “It was in a Christian realm that a huge wolf came raiding flocks, on which no iron would bite. When it took a baby from a hamlet near our camp, I thought I’d be less than a man did I not put an end to it.”</p>
   <p>“What happened?” she asked breathlessly, and caught his arm.</p>
   <p>“I wrestled it barehanded—no foe of mine was ever more fell—and at last broke its neck.” He pulled back a sleeve to show scars of terrible bites. “Dead, it changed into a man they had outlawed that year for his evil deeds. We burned the lich to make sure it would not walk again, and there-after the folk had peace. And ... we had friends, in a country otherwise wary of us.”</p>
   <p>She looked on him in the wonder he had hoped for.</p>
   <p>Erelong she must return with her father. But the way between the garths was just a few miles, and Hauk often rode or skied through the woods. At home, he and his men helped do what work there was, and gave merriment where it had long been little known.</p>
   <p>Thyra owned this to her son, on a snowy day when they were by themselves. They were in the women’s bower, whither they had gone to see a tapestry she was weaving. She wanted to know how it showed against those of the Westlands; he had brought one such, which hung above the benches in the hall. Here, in the wide quiet room, was dusk, for the day outside had become a tumbling whiteness. Breath steamed from lips as the two of them spoke. It smelled sweet; both had drunk mead until they could talk freely.</p>
   <p>“You did better than you knew when you came back,” Thyra said. “You blew like spring into this winter of ours. Einar and Unn were withering; they blossom again in your nearness.”</p>
   <p>“Strangely has our father changed,” Hauk answered sadly. “I remem­ber once when I was small, how he took me by the hand on a frost-clear night, led me forth under the stars, and named for me the pictures in them, Thor’s Wain, Freyja’s Spindle—how wonderful he made them, how his deep slow laughterful voice filled the dark.”</p>
   <p>“A wasting illness draws the soul inward,” his mother said. “He ... has no more manhood…and it tears him like fangs that he will die helpless in bed. He must strike out at someone, and here we are.”</p>
   <p>She was silent a while before she added: “He will not live out the year. Then you must take over.”</p>
   <p>“I must be gone when weather allows,” Hauk warned. “I promised Ottar.”</p>
   <p>“Return as soon as may be,” Thyra said. “We have need of a strong man, the more so now when yonder King Harald would reave their free­hold rights from yeomen.”</p>
   <p>“It would be well to have a hearth of my own.” Hauk stared past her, toward the unseen woods. Her worn face creased in a smile.</p>
   <p>Suddenly they heard yells from the yard below. Hauk ran out onto the gallery and looked down. Geirolf was shambling after an aged carl named Atli. He had a whip in his hand and was lashing it across the white locks and wrinkled cheeks of the man, who could not run fast either and who sobbed.</p>
   <p>“What is this?” broke from Hauk. He swung himself over the rail, hung, and let go. The drop would at least have jarred the wind out of most. He, though, bounced from where he landed, ran behind his father, caught hold of the whip and wrenched it from Geirolf’s grasp. “What are you doing?”</p>
   <p>Geirolf howled and struck his son with a doubled fist. Blood trickled from Hauk’s mouth. He stood fast. Atli sank to hands and knees and fought not to weep.</p>
   <p>“Are you also a heelbiter of mine?” Geirolf bawled.</p>
   <p>“I’d save you from your madness, father,” Hauk said in pain. “Atli followed you to battle ere I was born—he dandled me on his knee—and he’s a free man. What has he done, that you’d bring down on us the anger of his kinfolk?”</p>
   <p>“Harm not the skipper, young man,” Atli begged. “I fled because I’d sooner the than lift hand against my skipper.”</p>
   <p>“Hell swallow you both!” Geirolf would have cursed further, but the coughing came on him. Blood drops flew through the snowflakes, down onto the white earth, where they mingled with the drip from the heads of Hauk and Atli. Doubled over, Geirolf let them half lead, half carry him to his shut-bed. There he closed the panel and lay alone in darkness.</p>
   <p>“What happened between you and him?” Hauk asked.</p>
   <p>“I was fixing to shoe a horse,” Atli said into a ring of gaping onlook­ers. “He came in and wanted to know why I’d not asked his leave. I told him ‘twas plain Kolfaxi needed new shoes. Then he hollered, ‘I’ll show you I’m no log in the woodpile!’ and snatched yon whip off the wall and took after me.” The old man squared his shoulders. “We’ll speak no more of this, you hear?” he ordered the household.</p>
   <p>Nor did Geirolf, when next day he let them bring him some broth.</p>
   <p>For more reasons than this, Hauk came to spend much of his time at Leif’s garth. He would return in such a glow that even the reproachful looks of his young sister and brother, even the sullen or the weary greet­ing of his father, could not dampen it.</p>
   <p>At last, when lengthening days and quickening blood bespoke seafar­ings soon to come, that happened which surprised nobody. Hauk told them in the hall that he wanted to marry Alfhild Leifsdottir, and prayed Geirolf press the suit for him. “What must be, will be,” said his father, a better grace than awaited. Union of the families was clearly good for both.</p>
   <p>Leif Egilsson agreed, and Alfhild had nothing but aye to say. The betrothal feast crowded the whole neighborhood together in cheer. Thyra hid the trouble within her, and Geirolf himself was calm if not blithe.</p>
   <p>Right after, Hauk and his men were busking themselves to fare. Regardless of his doubts about gods, he led in offering for a safe voyage to Thor, Aegir, and St. Michael. But Alfhild found herself a quiet place alone, to cut runes on an ash tree in the name of Freyja.</p>
   <p>When all was ready, she was there with the folk of Geirolf s stead to see the sailors off. That morning was keen, wind roared in trees and skirled between cliffs, waves ran green and white beneath small flying clouds. Unn could not but hug her brother who was going, while Einar gave him a handclasp that shook. Thyra said, “Come home hale and early, my son.” Alfhild mostly stored away the sight of Hauk. Atli and others of the household mumbled this and that.</p>
   <p>Geirolf shuffled forward. The cane on which he leaned rattled among the stones of the beach. He was hunched in a hairy cloak against the sharp air. His locks fell tangled almost to the coal-smoldering eyes. “Father, farewell,” Hauk said, taking his free hand.</p>
   <p>“You mean ‘fare far,’ don’t you?” Geirolf grated. “ ‘Fare far and never come back.’ You’d like that, wouldn’t you? But we will meet again. Oh, yes, we will meet again.”</p>
   <p>Hauk dropped the hand. Geirolf turned and sought the house. The rest behaved as if they had not heard, speaking loudly, amidst yelps of laugh­ter, to overcome those words of foreboding. Soon Hauk called his orders to begone.</p>
   <p>Men scrambled aboard the laden ship. Its sail slatted aloft and filled, the mooring lines were cast loose, the hull stood out to sea. Alfhild waved until it was gone from sight behind the bend where Disafoss fell.</p>
   <p>Tire summer passed—plowing, sowing, lambing, calving, farrowing, hoeing, reaping, flailing, butchering—rain, hail, sun, stars, loves, quarrels, births, deaths—and the season wore toward fall. Alfhild was seldom at Geirolf’s garth, nor was Leif; for Hauk’s father grew steadily worse. After midsummer he could no longer leave his bed. But often he whis­pered, between lung-tearing coughs, to those who tended him, “I would kill you if I could.”</p>
   <p>On a dark day late in the season, when rain roared about the hall and folk and hounds huddled close to fires that hardly lit the gloom around, Geirolf awoke from a heavy sleep. Thyra marked it and came to him. Cold and dankness gnawed their way through her clothes. The fever was in him like a brand. He plucked restlessly at his blanket, where he half sat in his short shut-bed. Though flesh had wasted from the great bones, his fingers still had strength to tear the wool. The mattress rustled under him. “Straw-death, straw-death,” he muttered.</p>
   <p>Thyra laid a palm on his brow. “Be at ease,” she said.</p>
   <p>It dragged from him: “You’ll not be rid ... of me…so fast ... by straw-death.” An icy sweat broke forth and the last struggle began.</p>
   <p>Long it was, Geirolf’s gasps and the sputtering flames the only noises within that room, while rain and wind ramped outside and night drew in. Thyra stood by the bedside to wipe the sweat off her man, blood and spittle from his beard. A while after sunset, he rolled his eyes back and died.</p>
   <p>Thyra called for water and lamps. She cleansed him, clad him in his best, and laid him out. A drawn sword was on his breast.</p>
   <p>In the morning, thralls and carls alike went forth under her orders. A hillock stood in the fields about half a mile inland from the house. They dug a grave chamber in the top of this, lining it well with timber. “Won’t you bury him in his ship?” asked Atli.</p>
   <p>“It is rotten, unworthy of him,” Thyra said. Yet she made them haul it to the barrow, around which she had stones to outline a hull. Meanwhile folk readied a grave-ale, and messengers bade neighbors come.</p>
   <p>When all were there, men of Geirolf’s carried him on a litter to his resting place and put him in, together with weapons and a jar of Southland coins. After beams had roofed the chamber, his friends from aforetime took shovels and covered it well. They replaced the turfs of sere grass, leaving the hillock as it had been save that it was now bigger. Einar Thorolfsson kindled his father’s ship. It burned till dusk, when the horns of the new moon stood over the fjord. Meanwhile folk had gone back down to the garth to feast and drink. Riding home next day, well gifted by Thyra, they told each other that this had been an honorable burial.</p>
   <p>The moon waxed. On the first night that it rose full, Geirolf came again.</p>
   <p>A thrall named Kark had been late in the woods, seeking a strayed sheep. Coming home, he passed near the howe. The moon was barely above the pines; long shivery beams of light ran on the water, lost them­selves in shadows ashore, glinted wanly anew where a bedewed stone wall snaked along a stubblefield. Stars were few. A great stillness lay on the land, not even an owl hooted, until all at once dogs down in the garth began howling. It was not the way they howled at the moon; across the mile between, it sounded ragged and terrified. Kark felt the chill close in around him, and hastened toward home.</p>
   <p>Something heavy trod the earth. He looked around and saw the bulk of a huge man coming across the field from the barrow. “Who’s that?” he called uneasily. No voice replied, but the weight of those footfalls shiv­ered through the ground into his bones. Kark swallowed, gripped his staff, and stood where he was. But then the shape came so near that moonlight picked out the head of Geirolf. Kark screamed, dropped his weapon, and ran.</p>
   <p>Geirolf followed slowly, clumsily behind.</p>
   <p>Down in the garth, light glimmered red as doors opened. Folk saw Kark running, gasping for breath. Atli and Einar led the way out, each with a torch in one hand, a sword in the other. Little could they see beyond the wild flame-gleam. Kark reached them, fell, writhed on the hard-beaten clay of the yard, and wailed.</p>
   <p>“What is it, you lackwit?” Atli snapped, and kicked him. Then Einar pointed his blade.</p>
   <p>“A stranger—” Atli began.</p>
   <p>Geirolf rocked into sight. The mould of the grave clung to him. His eyes stared unblinking, unmoving, blank in the moonlight, out of a gray face whereon the skin crawled. The teeth in his tangled beard were dry. No breath smoked from his nostrils. He held out his arms, crook-fingered.</p>
   <p>“Father!” Einar cried. The torch hissed from his grip, flickered weakly at his feet, and went out. The men at his back jammed the doorway of the hall as they sought its shelter.</p>
   <p>“The skipper’s come again,” Atli quavered. He sheathed his sword, though that was hard when his hand shook, and made himself step for­ward. “Skipper, d’you know your old shipmate Atli?”</p>
   <p>The dead man grabbed him, lifted him, and dashed him to earth. Einar heard bones break. Atli jerked once and lay still. Geirolf trod him and Kark underfoot. There was a sound of cracking and rending. Blood spurted forth.</p>
   <p>Blindly, Einar swung blade. The edge smote but would not bite. A wave of grave-chill passed over him. He whirled and bounded back inside.</p>
   <p>Thyra had seen. “Bar the door,” she bade. The windows were already shuttered against frost. “Men, stand fast. Women, stoke up the fires.”</p>
   <p>They heard the lich groping about the yard. Walls creaked where Geirolf blundered into them. Thyra called through the door, “Why do you wish us ill, your own household?” But only those noises gave answer. The hounds cringed and whined.</p>
   <p>“Lay iron at the doors and under every window,” Thyra commanded. “If it will not cut him, it may keep him out.”</p>
   <p>All that night, then, folk huddled in the hall. Geirolf climbed onto the roof and rode the ridgepole, drumming his heels on the shakes till the whole building boomed. A little before sunrise, it stopped. Peering out by the first dull dawnlight, Thyra saw no mark of her husband but his deep-sunken footprints and the wrecked bodies he had left.</p>
   <p>“He grew so horrible before he died,” Unn wept. “Now he can’t rest, can he?”</p>
   <p>“We’ll make him an offering,” Thyra said through her weariness. “It may be we did not give him enough when we buried him.”</p>
   <p>Few would follow her to the howe. Those who dared, brought along the best horse on the farm. Einar, as the son of the house when Hauk was gone, himself cut its throat after a sturdy man had given the hammer-blow. Carls and wenches butchered the carcass, which Thyra and Unn cooked over a fire in whose wood was blent the charred rest of the dragonship. Nobody cared to eat much of the flesh or broth. Thyra poured what was left over the bones, upon the grave.</p>
   <p>Two ravens circled in sight, waiting for folk to go so they could take the food. “Is that a good sign?” Thyra sighed. “Will Odin fetch Geirolf home?”</p>
   <p>That night everybody who had not fled to neighboring steads gath­ered in the hall. Soon after the moon rose, they heard the footfalls come nearer and nearer. They heard Geirolf break into the storehouse and worry the laid-out bodies of Atli and Kark. They heard him kill cows in the barn. Again he rode the roof.</p>
   <p>In the morning Leif Egilsson arrived, having gotten the news. He found Thyra too tired and shaken to do anything further. “The ghost did not take your offering,” he said, “but maybe the gods will.”</p>
   <p>In the oakenshaw, he led the giving of more beasts. There was talk of a thrall for Odin, but he said that would not help if this did not. Instead, he saw to the proper burial of the slain, and of those kine which nobody would dare eat. That night he abode on the farm.</p>
   <p>And Geirolf came back. Throughout the darkness, he tormented the home which had been his.</p>
   <p>“I will bide here one more day,” Leif said next sunrise. “We all need rest—though ill is it that we must sleep during daylight when we’ve so much readying for winter to do.”</p>
   <p>By that time, some other neighborhood men were also on hand. They spoke loudly of how they would hew the lich asunder.</p>
   <p>“You know not what you boast of,” said aged Grim the Wise. “Einar smote, and he strikes well for a lad, but the iron would not bite. It never will. Ghost-strength is in Geirolf, and all the wrath he could not set free during his life.”</p>
   <p>That night folk waited breathless for moonrise. But when the gnawed shield climbed over the pines, nothing stirred. The dogs, too, no longer seemed cowed. About midnight, Grim murmured into the shadows, “Yes, I thought so. Geirolf walks only when the moon is full.”</p>
   <p>“Then tomorrow we’ll dig him up and burn him!” Leif said.</p>
   <p>“No,” Grim told them. “That would spell the worst of luck for every­body here. Don’t you see, the anger and unpeace which will not let him rest, those would be forever unslaked? They could not but bring doom on the burners.”</p>
   <p>“What then can we do?” Thyra asked dully.</p>
   <p>“Leave this stead,” Grim counselled, “at least when the moon is full.”</p>
   <p>“Hard will that be,” Einar sighed. “Would that my brother Hauk were here.”</p>
   <p>“He should have returned erenow,” Thyra said. “May we in our woe never know that he has come to grief himself.”</p>
   <p>In truth, Hauk had not. His wares proved welcome in Flanders, where he bartered for cloth that he took across to England. There Ottar greeted him, and he met the young King Alfred. At that time there was no war going on with the Danes, who were settling into the Danelaw and thus in need of household goods. Hauk and Ottar did a thriving business among them. This led them to think they might do as well in Iceland, whither Norse folk were moving who liked not King Harald Fairhair. They made a voyage to see. Foul winds hampered them on the way home. Hence fall was well along when Hauk’s ship returned.</p>
   <p>The day was still and cold. Low overcast turned sky and water the hue of iron. A few gulls cruised and mewed, while under them sounded creak and splash of oars, swearing of men, as the knorr was rowed. At the end of the fjord-branch, garth and leaves were tiny splashes of color, lost against rearing cliffs, brown fields, murky wildwood. Straining ahead from afar, Hauk saw that a bare handful of men came down to the shore, moving listlessly more than watchfully. When his craft was unmistakable, though, a few women—no youngsters—sped from the hall as if they could not wait. Their cries came to him more thin than the gulls.</p>
   <p>Hauk lay alongside the dock. Springing forth, he called merrily, “Where is everybody? How fares Alfhild?” His words lost themselves in silence. Fear touched him. “What’s wrong?”</p>
   <p>Thyra trod forth. Years might have gone by during his summer abroad, so changed was she. “You are barely in time,” she said in an unsteady tone. Taking his hands, she told him how things stood.</p>
   <p>Hauk stared long into emptiness. At last, “Oh, no,” he whispered. “What’s to be done?”</p>
   <p>“We hoped you might know that, my son,” Thyra answered. “The moon will be full tomorrow night.”</p>
   <p>His voice stumbled. “I am no wizard. If the gods themselves would not lay this ghost, what can I do?”</p>
   <p>Einar spoke, in the brashness of youth: “We thought you might deal with him as you did with the werewolf.”</p>
   <p>“But that was—No, I cannot!” Hauk croaked. “Never ask me.”</p>
   <p>“Then I fear we must leave,” Thyra said. “For aye. You see how many have already fled, thrall and free alike, though nobody else has a place for them. We’ve not enough left to farm these acres. And who would buy them of us? Poor must we go, helpless as the poor ever are.”</p>
   <p>“Iceland—” Hauk wet his lips. “Well, you shall not want while I live.” Yet he had counted on this homestead, whether to dwell on or sell.</p>
   <p>“Tomorrow we move over to Leif’s garth, for the next three days and nights,” Thyra said.</p>
   <p>Unn shuddered. “I know not if I can come back,” she said. “This whole past month here, I could hardly ever sleep.” Dulled skin and sunken eyes bore her out.</p>
   <p>“What else would you do?” Hauk asked.</p>
   <p>“Whatever I can,” she stammered, and broke into tears. He knew: wedding herself too young to whoever would have her dowryless, poor though the match would be—or making her way to some town to turn whore, his little sister.</p>
   <p>“Let me think on this,” Hauk begged. “Maybe I can hit on something.”</p>
   <p>His crew were also daunted when they heard. At eventide they sat in the hall and gave only a few curt words about what they had done in for­eign parts. Everyone lay down early on bed, bench, or floor, but none slept well.</p>
   <p>Before sunset, Hauk had walked forth alone. First he sought the grave of Atli. “I’m sorry, dear old friend,” he said. Afterward he went to Geirolf’s howe. It loomed yellow-gray with withered grass wherein grinned the skull of the slaughtered horse. At its foot were strewn the charred bits of the ship, inside stones which outlined a greater but unreal hull. Around reached stubblefields and walls, hemmed in by woods on one side and water on the other, rock lifting sheer beyond. The chill and the quiet had deepened.</p>
   <p>Hauk climbed to the top of the barrow and stood there a while, head bent downward. “Oh, father,” he said, “I learned doubt in Christian lands. What’s right for me to do?” There was no answer. He made a slow way back to the dwelling.</p>
   <p>All were up betimes next day. It went slowly over the woodland path to Leif’s, for animals must be herded along. The swine gave more trou­ble than most. Hauk chuckled once, not very merrily, and remarked that at least this took folk’s minds off their sorrows. He raised no mirth.</p>
   <p>But he had Alfhild ahead of him. At the end of the way, he sprinted shouting into the yard. Leif owned less land than Geirolf, his buildings were smaller and fewer, most of his guests must house outdoors in sleep­ing bags. Hauk paid no heed. “Alfhild!” he called. “I’m here!”</p>
   <p>She left the dough she was kneading and sped to him. They hugged each other hard and long, in sight of the whole world. None thought that shame, as things were. At last she said, striving not to weep, “How we’ve longed for you! Now the nightmare can end.”</p>
   <p>He stepped back. “What mean you?” he uttered slowly, knowing full well.</p>
   <p>“Why—” She was bewildered. “Won’t you give him his second death?”</p>
   <p>Hauk gazed past her for some heartbeats before he said: “Come aside with me.”</p>
   <p>Hand in hand, they wandered off. A meadow lay hidden from the garth by a stand of aspen. Elsewhere around, pines speared into a sky that today was bright. Clouds drifted on a nipping breeze. Far off, a stag bugled.</p>
   <p>Hauk spread feet apart, hooked thumbs in belt, and made himself meet her eyes. “You think over-highly of my strength,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Who has more?” she asked. “We kept ourselves going by saying you would come home and make things good again.”</p>
   <p>“What if the drow is too much for me?” His words sounded raw through the hush. Leaves dropped yellow from their boughs.</p>
   <p>She flushed. “Then your name will live.”</p>
   <p>“Yes—” Softly he spoke the words of the High One:</p>

    </stanza>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>“You will do it!” she cried gladly.</p>
   <p>His head shook before it drooped. “No. I will not. I dare not.”</p>
   <p>She stood as if he had clubbed her.</p>
   <p>“Won’t you understand?” he began.</p>
   <p>The wound he had dealt her hopes went too deep. “So you show yourself a nithing!”</p>
   <p>“Hear me,” he said, shaken. “Were the lich anybody else’s—”</p>
   <p>Overwrought beyond reason, she slapped him and choked, “The gods bear witness, I give them my holiest oath, never will I wed you unless you do this thing. See, by my blood I swear.” She whipped out her dag­ger and gashed her wrist. Red rills coursed out and fell in drops on the fallen leaves.</p>
   <p>He was aghast. “You know not what you say. You’re too young, you’ve been too sheltered. <emphasis>Listen.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>She would have fled from him, but he gripped her shoulders and made her stand. “Listen,” went between his teeth. “Geirolf is still my father— my father who begot me, reared me, named the stars for me, weaponed me to make my way in the world. How can I fight him? Did I slay him, what horror would come upon me and mine?”</p>
   <p>“O-o-oh,” broke from Alfhild. She sank to the ground and wept as if to tear loose her ribs.</p>
   <p>He knelt, held her, gave what soothing he could. “Now I know,” she mourned. “Too late.”</p>
   <p>“Never,” he murmured. “We’ll fare abroad if we must, take new land, make new lives together.”</p>
   <p>“No,” she gasped. “Did I not swear? What doom awaits an oath-breaker?”</p>
   <p>Then he was long still. Heedlessly though she had spoken, her blood lay in the earth, which would remember.</p>
   <p>He too was young. He straightened. “I will fight,” he said.</p>
   <p>Now she clung to him and pleaded that he must not. But an iron calm had come over him. “Maybe I will not be cursed,” he said. “Or maybe the curse will be no more than I can bear.”</p>
   <p>“It will be mine too, I who brought it on you,” she plighted herself.</p>
   <p>Hand in hand again, they went back to the garth. Leif spied the hag­gard look on them and half guessed what had happened. “Will you fare to meet the drow, Hauk?” he asked. “Wait till I can have Grim the Wise brought here. His knowledge may help you.”</p>
   <p>“No,” said Hauk. “Waiting would weaken me. I go this night.”</p>
   <p>Wide eyes stared at him—all but Thyra’s; she was too torn.</p>
   <p>Toward evening he busked himself. He took no helm, shield, or byrnie, for the dead man bore no weapons. Some said they would come along, armored themselves well, and offered to be at his side. He told them to follow him, but no farther than to watch what happened. Their iron would be of no help, and he thought they would only get in each other’s way, and his, when he met the over-human might of the drow. He kissed Alfhild, his mother, and his sister, and clasped hands with his brother, bid­ding them stay behind if they loved him.</p>
   <p>Long did the few miles of path seem, and gloomy under the pines. The sun was on the world’s rim when men came out in the open. They looked past fields and barrow down to the empty garth, the fjordside cliffs, the water where the sun lay as half an ember behind a trail of blood. Clouds hurried on a wailing wind through a greenish sky. Cold struck deep. A wolf howled.</p>
   <p>“Wait here,” Hauk said.</p>
   <p>“The gods be with you,” Leif breathed.</p>
   <p>“I’ve naught tonight but my own strength,” Hauk said. “Belike none of us ever had more.”</p>
   <p>His tall form, clad in leather and wadmal, showed black athwart the sunset as he walked from the edge of the woods, out across plowland to­ward the crouching howe. The wind fluttered his locks, a last brightness until the sun went below. Then for a while the evenstar alone had light.</p>
   <p>Hauk reached the mound. He drew sword and leaned on it, waiting. Dusk deepened. Star after star came forth, small and strange. Clouds blowing across them picked up a glow from the still unseen moon.</p>
   <p>It rose at last above the treetops. Its ashen sheen stretched gashes of shadow across earth. The wind loudened.</p>
   <p>The grave groaned. Turves, stones, timbers swung aside. Geirolf shambled out beneath the sky. Hauk felt the ground shudder under his weight. There came a carrion stench, though the only sign of rotting was on the dead man’s clothes. His eyes peered dim, his teeth gnashed dry in a face at once well remembered and hideously changed. When he saw the liv­ing one who waited, he veered and lumbered thitherward.</p>
   <p>“Father,” Hauk called. “It’s I, your eldest son.”</p>
   <p>The drow drew nearer.</p>
   <p>“Halt, I beg you,” Hauk said unsteadily. “What can I do to bring you peace?”</p>
   <p>A cloud passed over the moon. It seemed to be hurtling through heaven. Geirolf reached for his son with fingers that were ready to clutch and tear. “Hold,” Hauk shrilled. “No step farther.”</p>
   <p>He could not see if the gaping mouth grinned. In another stride, the great shape came well-nigh upon him. He lifted his sword and brought it singing down. The edge struck truly, but slid aside. Geirolf’s skin heaved, as if to push the blade away. In one more step, he laid grave-cold hands around Hauk’s neck.</p>
   <p>Before that grip could close, Hauk dropped his useless weapon, brought his wrists up between Geirolf’s, and mightily snapped them apart. Nails left furrows, but he was free. He sprang back, into a wrestler’s stance.</p>
   <p>Geirolf moved in, reaching. Hauk hunched under those arms and himself grabbed waist and thigh. He threw his shoulder against a belly like rock. Any live man would have gone over, but the lich was too heavy.</p>
   <p>Geirolf smote Hauk on the side. The blows drove him to his knees and thundered on his back. A foot lifted to crush him. He rolled off and found his own feet again. Geirolf lurched after him. The hastening moon linked their shadows. The wolf howled anew, but in fear. Watching men gripped spearshafts till their knuckles stood bloodless.</p>
   <p>Hauk braced his legs and snatched for the first hold, around both of Geirolf’s wrists. The drow strained to break loose and could not; but nei­ther could Hauk bring him down. Sweat ran moon-bright over the son’s cheeks and darkened his shirt. The reek of it was at least a living smell in his nostrils. Breath tore at his gullet. Suddenly Geirolf wrenched so hard that his right arm tore from between his foe’s fingers. He brought that hand against Hauk’s throat. Hauk let go and slammed himself backward before he was throttled.</p>
   <p>Geirolf stalked after him. The drow did not move fast. Hauk sped be­hind and pounded on the broad back. He seized an arm of Geirolf’s and twisted it around. But the dead cannot feel pain. Geirolf stood fast. His other hand groped about, got Hauk by the hair, and yanked. Live men can hurt. Hauk stumbled away. Blood ran from his scalp into his eyes and mouth, hot and salt.</p>
   <p>Geirolf turned and followed. He would not tire. Hauk had no long while before strength ebbed. Almost, he fled. Then the moon broke through to shine full on his father. “You…shall not…go on…like that,” Hauk mumbled while he snapped after air.</p>
   <p>The drow reached him. They closed, grappled, swayed, stamped to and fro, in wind and flickery moonlight. Then Hauk hooked an ankle behind Geirolf’s and pushed. With a huge thud, the drow crashed to earth. He dragged Hauk along.</p>
   <p>Hauk’s bones felt how terrible was the grip upon him. He let go his own hold. Instead, he arched his back and pushed himself away. His clothes ripped. But he burst free and reeled to his feet.</p>
   <p>Geirolf turned over and began to crawl up. His back was once more to Hauk. The young man sprang. He got a knee hard in between the shoulderblades, while both his arms closed on the frosty head before him.</p>
   <p>He hauled. With the last and greatest might that was in him, he hauled. Blackness went in tatters before his eyes.</p>
   <p>There came a loud snapping sound. Geirolf ceased pawing behind him. He sprawled limp. His neck was broken, his jawbone wrenched from the skull. Hauk climbed slowly off him, shuddering. Geirolf stirred, rolled, half rose. He lifted a hand toward Hauk. It traced a line through the air and a line growing from beneath that. Then he slumped and lay still.</p>
   <p>Hauk crumpled too.</p>
   <p>“Follow me who dare!” Leif roared, and went forth across the field. One by one, as they saw nothing move ahead of them, the men came after. At last they stood hushed around Geirolf—who was only a harmless dead man now, though the moon shone bright in his eyes—and on Hauk, who had begun to stir.</p>
   <p>“Bear him carefully down to the hall,” Leif said. “Start a fire and tend it well. Most of you, take from the woodpile and come back here. I’ll stand guard meanwhile… though I think there is no need.”</p>
   <p>And so they burned Geirolf there in the field. He walked no more.</p>
   <p>In the morning, they brought Hauk back to Leif’s garth. He moved as if in dreams. The others were too awestruck to speak much. Even when Alfhild ran to meet him, he could only say, “Hold clear of me. I may be under a doom.”</p>
   <p>“Did the drow lay a weird on you?” she asked, spear-stricken.</p>
   <p>“I know not,” he answered. “I think I fell into the dark before he was wholly dead.”</p>
   <p>“What?” Leif well-nigh shouted. “You did not see the sign he drew?”</p>
   <p>“Why, no,” Hauk said. “How did it go?”</p>
   <p>“Thus. Even afar and by moonlight, I knew.” Leif drew it.</p>
   <p>“That is no ill-wishing!” Grim cried. “That’s naught but the Hammer.”</p>
   <p>Life rushed back into Hauk. “Do you mean what I hope?”</p>
   <p>“He blessed you,” Grim said. “You freed him from what he had most dreaded and hated—his straw-death. The madness in him is gone, and he has wended hence to the world beyond.”</p>
   <p>Then Hauk was glad again. He led them all in heaping earth over the ashes of his father, and in setting things right on the farm. That winter, at the feast of Thor, he and Alfhild were wedded. Afterward he became well thought of by King Harald, and rose to great wealth. From him and Alfhild stem many men whose names are still remembered. Here ends the tale of Hauk the Ghost Slayer.</p>
