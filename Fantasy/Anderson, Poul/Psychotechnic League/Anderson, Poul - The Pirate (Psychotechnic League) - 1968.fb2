   <p>Robbing: graveyards is an ancient practice indeed;</p>
   <p>the Pharaohs called down curses on such thieves.</p>
   <p>But never before on this scale . . . !</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>We guard the great Pact; but the young generations, the folk of the star frontier, so often do not understand.</p>
   <p><emphasis>They avail themselves of our ordinary work. (Ship Harpsong of Nerthus, out of Highsky for David's Landing, is long overdue . . . Please forecast the competition which a cybernation venture on Oasis would probably face after the older firms elsewhere learned that a market had been established . . . Bandits reported . . . How shall we deal with this wholly strange race of beings we have come upon? But then we step in their own paths and say, “Thou shalt not.” And suddenly we are the Cordys, the enemy.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The case of the slain world named Good Luck is typical. Now that the Service is ready, after a generation, to let the truth be known, I can tell you about Trevelyan Micah, Murdoch Juan, Smokesmith, Red Faustina, and the rest, that you may judge the rights or wrongs for yourself.</p>
   <p>In those days Trevelyan spent his furloughs on Earth. He said its quiet, its intellectuality, were downright refreshing, and he could get all the rowdiness he wanted elsewhere. But of course his custom put him at the nerve center of the Service, insofar as an organization operating across a fraction of the galaxy can have one. He got a larger picture than most of his colleagues of how it fared with the Pact. This made him more effective. He was a dedicated man.</p>
   <p>I suspect he also wanted to renew his humanity at the wellspring of humankind, he who spent most of his life amidst otherness. Thus he was strengthened in his will to be a faithful guardian.</p>
   <p>Not that he was a prig. He was large and dark, with aquiline features and hard aquamarine eyes, But his smile was ready, his humor was dry, his tunic and culottes were always in the latest mode, he enjoyed every aspect of life.</p>
   <p>When the machine summoned him to the Good Luck affair, he had been living for a while at Laugerie Haute, which is in the middle of the steep, green, altogether beautiful Dordogne country. His girl of the moment had a stone house that was built in the Middle Ages against an overhanging cliff. Its interior renovation did not change its exterior ancientness, which made it seem a part of the hills or they a part of it. But in front grew bushes, covering a site excavated centuries ago, where flint-working reindeer hunters lived for millennia while the glacier covered North Europe. And daily overhead through the bright sky glided a spear that was the Greenland- Algeria carrier; and at night, across the stars where men now traveled, moved sparks that were spaceships lifting out of Earth’s shadow. In few other parts of the planet could you be more fully in the oneness of time.</p>
   <p>“You don’t have to go, not yet,” Braganza Diane said, a little desperately because she cared for him and our trumpeter blows too many “Farewells” each year.</p>
   <p>“ ’Fraid I do,” he said. “The computer didn’t ring me up for fun. In fact, it’s a notoriously sober-sided machine.” When she didn’t answer his grin, he explained; “The data banks show I’m the only person available who’s dealt with, uh, a certain individual before. He’s a slippery beast, with sharp teeth, and experience might make the critical quantum of difference.”</p>
   <p>“It better!” She curbed the tears that could have caused him to think her immature and bent her lips upward. “You will add . . . the rest of this leave ... to your next, and spend it with me. Won’t you?”</p>
   <p>“I’d love to,” he said, carefully making no promises. He kissed her, where they stood in the hay scent of summer. They went back to the house for a while.</p>
   <p>After he packed his kit and phoned good-bye to some neighbors —landholders, friendly folk whose ancestors had dwelt here for generations beyond counting—she flew him to Aerogare Bordeaux. Thence he took a carrier to Port Nevada. The computer had briefed him so well that he could go straight to work, and he wanted to catch Murdoch Juan at ease if possible.</p>
   <p>His timing was good. Sunset was slanting across western North America and turning the mountains purple when he arrived. The city walled him off from that serenity as he entered. It shouldered big square buildings above streets in which traffic clamored; the growl of machines perpetually underlay the shrill of voices; frantically flickering signs drowned out the stars; humans and nonhumans hustled, jostled, chiseled, brawled, clashed, stole, evangelized, grew rich, grew poor, came, went, and were forgotten; beneath a tawdry front was that heedless vigor which the cargo ships bring from their homes to enclaves like this. Trevelyan allowed himself a brief <emphasis>“Phew!”</emphasis> when the stinks rolled around him.</p>
   <p>He knew this town, on a hundred different worlds. He knew how to make inquiries of chance-met drinking companions. Eventually he found one of Murdoch’s crew who could tell him where the boss was this evening. It turned out to be no dive, with the smoke of a dozen drugs stinging the eyes, but the discreet and expensive Altair House.</p>
   <p>There a headwaiter, live though extraterrestrial, would not conduct him to his man. Captain Murdoch had requested privacy for a conference. Captain Murdoch was entitled to— Trevelyan showed his identification. It gave him no legal prerogative; but a while ago the Service had forestalled a war on the headwaiter’s native planet.</p>
   <p>Upstairs, he chimed for admittance to the room. He had been told that Captain Murdoch’s dinner guest had left, seemingly well pleased, while Captain Murdoch and his female companion stayed behind with a fresh order of champagne, vigorator, and other aids to celebration. “‘Come in, come in!” boomed the remembered hearty voice. The door dilated and Trevelyan trod through.</p>
   <p>“Huh? I thought you were . . . Sunblaze! You again!” Murdoch surged to his feet. Briefly he stood motionless, among drapes and paintings, sparkling glassware, drift of music and incense. Then, tiger softly, he came around the table to a fist’s reach of Trevelyan.</p>
   <p>He was as tall, and broader in the shoulders. His features were rugged, deeply weathered, blond hair and a sweeping blond moustache. His clothes were too colorful to be stylish on Earth, but he wore them with such panache that you didn’t notice.</p>
   <p>The woman remained seated. She was as vivid in her way as he in his, superbly formed, the classicism of her face brought to life by the nearly Asian cheekbones; and she owned the rare combination of pure white skin and fox-red hair. Yet she was no toy. When she saw Murdoch thus taken aback, Trevelyan read shock upon her. It was followed by unflinching enmity.</p>
   <p>He bowed to her. “Forgive me if I intrude,” he said.</p>
   <p>Murdoch relaxed in a gust of laughter. “Oh, sure, sure, Mike, you’re forgiven. If you don’t stay too mugthundering long.” He clapped hands on the agent’s shoulders. “How’ve you been, anyway? How many years since last?”</p>
   <p>“Five or six.” Trevelyan tried to smile back. “I’m sorry to bother you, but I understand you’re shipping out day after tomorrow, which no doubt means you’ll be busy for the prior twenty-four hours.”</p>
   <p>“Right, buck,” Murdoch said. “This here tonight is our lift-off party. However, it began with business—lining up a financial backer for later on—so it may as well continue that way a few microseconds.” The tone stayed genial, but the gaze was pale and very steady. “Got to be business, don’t it? You didn’t track me down just to wish an old sparring partner a bony voyage.”</p>
   <p>“Not really,” Trevelyan admitted.</p>
   <p>Murdoch took his arm and led him to the table. “Well, sit yourself and have a glug with us. Faustina, meet Trevelyan Micah of the Stellar Union Coordination Service.”</p>
   <p>“Juan has spoken of you,” the woman said distantly.</p>
   <p>Trevelyan eased into a chair. His muscles relaxed, one by one, that his brain might be undistracted in the coming duel. “I hope he used language suitable to a lady,” he said.</p>
   <p>“I’m from New Mars,” she snapped. “We don’t have time for sex distinctions in our manners.”</p>
   <p>I <emphasis>might have guessed,</emphasis> he thought. There aren’t as many unclaimed planets habitable by man as is popularly believed; so the marginal ones get settled too. He could imagine scarring poverty in her background, and Murdoch Juan as the great merry beloved knight who took her from it and would bear her on his saddlebow to the castle he meant to conquer for them.</p>
   <p>“I did my duty as I saw it, which happened to conflict with Captain Murdoch’s rights as he saw them,” Trevelyan said.</p>
   <p>“I was making a fortune off fur and lumber on Vanaheim,” the other man said.</p>
   <p>“And disrupting the ecology of a continent,” Trevelyan replied.</p>
   <p>“You didn’t have to come in and talk them into changing the laws on me,” Murdoch said without rancor. He rinsed a glass from the water carafe and filled it with champagne. “Hope you don’t mind this being used first by a financier.”</p>
   <p>“No. Thank you.” Trevelyan accepted.</p>
   <p>“And then, when he was honorably engaged as a mercenary—” Faustina’s tone held venom.</p>
   <p>“Bringing modern weapons in against primitives who were no menace,” Trevelyan said. “That’s universally illegal. Almost as illegal as dispossessing autochthons or prior colonists.”</p>
   <p>“Docs your precious Union actually claim jurisdiction over the entire cosmos?”</p>
   <p>“Ease off, Faustina,” Murdoch said.</p>
   <p>“The Union is not a government, although many governments support it,” Trevelyan said to the woman. “This galaxy alone is too big tor any power to control. But we do claim the right to prevent matters from getting out of hand, as far as we’re able. That includes wrongdoing by our own citizens anywhere.”</p>
   <p>“The Cordys never jailed me,” Murdoch said. “They only scuppered my operation. I got away in time and left no usable evidence. No hard feelings.” He raised his glass. Unwillingly, Trevelyan clinked rims with him and drank. “In fact,” Murdoch added, “I’m grateful to you, friend. You showed me the error of my ways. Now I’ve organized a thing that’ll not only make me rich, but so respectable that nobody can belch in my presence without a permit.”</p>
   <p>Faustina ignited a cigarette and smoked in hard puffs.</p>
   <p>“I’ve been asked to verify that,” Trevelyan said.</p>
   <p>“Why, everything’s open and honest,” Murdoch said. “You know it already. I got me a ship, never mind how, and went exploring out Eridanus way. I found a planet, uninhabited but colonizable, and filed for a discoverer’s patent. The Service inspection team verified that Good Luck, as I’m calling it, is an awfully exploitable world. Here I am on Earth, collecting men and equipment for the preliminary work of making a defined area safe for humans. You remember”—his manner grew deliberately patronizing—“check for dangerous organisms and substances in the environment, establish the weather and seismic patterns, et cetera. When we’re finished, I’ll advertise my real estate and my ferry service to it. For the duration of my patent, I can set the terms of immigration, within limits. Most discoverers just charge a fee. But I aim to supply everything—transportation there, a functioning physical community built in advance, whatever people need to make a good start. That’s why I’ve been discussing financial backing.”</p>
   <p>“Your approach has been tried,” Trevelyan warned, “but never paid off. The cost per capita of a prefabricated settlement is more than the average would-be immigrant can afford. So he stays home, and puff goes the profit. Eventually, the entrepreneur is glad to sell out for a millo on the credit.”</p>
   <p>“Not this one,” Murdoch said. “I’ll be charging irresistibly little— about half what it’d cost ’em to buy unimproved land and make their own homes and highways and such out of local materials. They’ll come.” He tossed off the rest of his glass and refilled it. “But why arc you curious, you Cordys? I haven’t told you anything that isn’t on file. If you wanted to snoop, why didn’t you come see me earlier?”</p>
   <p>“Because we have too much else on file,” Trevelyan said bitterly. “Our computer didn’t get around to correlating certain facts until yesterday. We’re trying to keep the galaxy livable, but it’s too much for us, too diverse—”</p>
   <p>“Good!” Faustina said.</p>
   <p>He gave her a grave look. “Be careful, my lady,” he said, “or one day a piece of that diversity may kill you.”</p>
   <p>Murdoch scowled. “That’ll do.” he said. “I’ve been nice, but this is my evening out with my girl and you’re obviously on a fishing expedition. You haven’t got a thing against me, legally, have you? Get out.”</p>
   <p>Trevelyan tensed where he sat.</p>
   <p>“Or goodnight, if you prefer,” Murdoch said in friendlier wise.</p>
   <p>Trevelyan rose, bowed, murmured the polite formulas, and left. Inwardly he felt cold. There had been more than a gloat in his enemy’s manner; there had been the expectation of revenge.</p>
   <p><emphasis>It looks as if I’d better take direct action, he thought.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The <emphasis>Campesino</emphasis> cleared from orbit, ran out of the Solar System on gravs, and went into hyperdrive in the usual fashion. She was a long-range cruiser with boats and gear for a variety of conditions. Aboard were Murdoch, Faustina, half a dozen spacemen and a score of technicians.</p>
   <p>The Service speedster <emphasis>Genji</emphasis> followed, manned by Trevelyan and that being whose humanly unpronounceable name was believed to mean something like Smokesmith. To shadow another vessel is more art than science and more witchcraft than either. <emphasis>Campesino</emphasis> could easily be tracked while in the normal mode—by amplified sight, thermal radiation, radar, neutrinos from the power plant. But once she went over to the tachyon mode, only a weak emission of superlight particles was available. And Murdoch also had detectors, surely kept wide open.</p>
   <p>With skill and luck, <emphasis>Genji</emphasis> could stay at the effective edge of the field she was observing, while it masked her own. For this to be possible, however, she must be much smaller as well as much faster than the other craft. Therefore nothing more formidable could be used. She did have a blast cannon, a couple of heavy slugthrowers, and several one-meter dirigible missiles with low-yield nuclear warheads. But Trevelyan would have been surprised if Murdoch’s people didn’t build huskier weapons en route.</p>
   <p>He sat for hours at the conn, staring into the jeweled blackness of its star simulacrum, while the ship murmured around him and the subliminal beat of drive energies wove into his bones. At last he said, “I think we’ve done it.” He pointed to the instruments. A hunter’s exultation lifted within him. “They are definitely sheering off the Eridanus course.”</p>
   <p>“They may have become aware of us, or they may do so later, and attack,” replied the flat artificial voice of Smokesmith.</p>
   <p>“We take that chance,” Trevelyan agreed. “I can’t quite believe it of Murdoch, though. He plays rough, but I don’t know about any cold-blooded murders he’s done.”</p>
   <p>“Our information concerning his world line is fragmentary, and zero about its future segment. Furthermore, available data indicate that his companions are quite unintegrate.”</p>
   <p>"Hm-m-m, yes, hard cases, none Earth-born, several nonhumans from raptor cultures among them. That was one fact which alerted us.”</p>
   <p>“What else? We departed too hurriedly for me to obtain entire background, I being ignorant of the biological and social nuances among your species.”</p>
   <p>Trevelyan considered his shipmate. Chief Rodionov had had to assign the first and presumably best agent he could, and there were never many nonhumans at Australia Center. Homo sapiens is a wolfish creature; two of him can end with ripping each other apart, on an indefinitely long voyage in as cramped a shell as this. But even when our agents have gentler instincts, we try to make up teams out of diverse breeds. The members must be compatible in their physical requirements but, preferably, different enough in psychologies and abilities that they form a whole which is more than its parts.</p>
   <p>The trouble was, Trevelyan had never before encountered a being from the planet men called Reardon’s. He had heard of them, but space is too full of life for us to remember it all, let alone meet it.</p>
   <p>Smokesmith’s barrellike body stood about one hundred forty centimeters high on four stumpy, clawfooted legs. Four tentacles ringed the top of it, each ending in three boneless fingers whose grip was astonishing. The head was more like a clump of fleshy blue petals than anything else; patterns upon them were the outward signs of sense organs, though Trevelyan didn’t know how these worked. Withal, Smokesmith was handsome in his (?) fashion. Indeed, the mother-of-pearl iridescence on his rugose torso was lovely to watch.</p>
   <p>The man decided on a straightforward approach. “Well,” he said, “the fact that Murdoch is involved was in itself suspicious. He probably came to Earth to outfit, rather than some colonial world where he isn’t known, because he wouldn’t attract attention.”</p>
   <p>“I should extrapolate otherwise, when few commercial ventures originate on Earth.”</p>
   <p>“But the average Terrestrial hasn’t got the average colonist’s lively interest in such matters. The port cities are mostly ignored by the rest of the planet, a regrettable necessity to be kept within proper bounds. Then too, Murdoch would have a better chance of getting substantial but close-mouthed—uh, that means secretive—money help on Earth, which is still the primary banker of the human species. And finally, though it’s true that Service reports from everywhere go to the molecular file at Center . . . that fact makes the data flow so huge that Murdoch might well have completed his business and departed before the continuous search-and- correlation noticed him.”</p>
   <p>“What was smelled, then, to excite suspicion? I do not hypothesize that the initial stimulus was the composition of his crew.”</p>
   <p>“No. We checked that out later. Nor did the economics of his project look especially interesting. Doubtless his ready-built community will be a wretched clutter of hovels; but <emphasis>caveat emptor,</emphasis> he’ll be within the law, and word will soon get around not to buy from him.</p>
   <p>“No, the real anomaly is the equipment he ordered. The report on this Good Luck of his is complete enough that you can fairly well predict what a ground-preparation gang will need. The planet’s smaller than Earth, relatively cold and arid, relatively thin atmosphere. But it has a magnetic field and a weak sun; hence the radiation background is low.”</p>
   <p>“What is required would depend on what race is to colonize.”</p>
   <p>“Sure. Murdoch will sell to humans. Not Earth humans, naturally. Colonial ones, from all over. We won’t be able to monitor every embarkation and debarkation, any except a tiny fraction. Not when we are as few as we are, with so much else to do. And local authorities won’t care. They’ll be too glad to get rid of excess population. Besides, most colonials are anarchic oriented; they won’t stand for official inquiries into their business.” Trevelyan blinked in surprise. “What started me off on that?’</p>
   <p>“Conceivably an element of your mentation has sensed a thought.”</p>
   <p>“If so, it’s a hunch too faint to identify. Well. Why doesn’t he have waterfinding gear with him, drills and explosives to start forming lakes, that kind of stuff? Why does he have a full line of radiation spotters and protective suits? The biological laboratory he’s assembled isn’t right for Good Luck either; it’s meant to study life forms a lot more terrestroid. I could go on, but you get the idea.”</p>
   <p>“And now he has changed course.” Smokesmith considered the indicators with whatever he used to see. “A geodesic, which will bring him in the direction of Scorpius.”</p>
   <p>“Huh? You don’t have to ask the computer? Trouble is, no law says he must go to his announced destination, or tell us why he didn’t.” Trevelyan smiled with shut lips. “Nor does any law say we can’t tail along.”</p>
   <p>A keening broke from Smokesmith, made not with his vocoder but with his own tympani. It wavered up and down the scale; a brief shakenness in his nerves told Trevelyan it entered the subsonic. Odors rolled upon the air, pungencies like blood and burnt sulfur and others men do not know.</p>
   <p>“Good Cosmos, what’re you doing?” he exclaimed.</p>
   <p>“It is an old communication of my infraculture. Of whetted winds, frost, a mountain that is a torch, beneath iron moons, a broken night, and the will to pursue that which has poison fangs . . . Enough.”</p>
   <p>Five hundred and twenty-eight light-years from Sol, the sky ahead suddenly blazed.</p>
   <p>Trevelyan had been meditating upon his philosophy. That, and reading, and listening to music tapes, and tinkering with handicrafts, and physical exercises, had been his refuge from the weary weeks. Smokesmith was a decent being in his way, but too alien for games or conversation. When asked how he passed the time, with no apparent motion save of his endlessly interweaving arms, he replied: “I make my alternate life. Your language lacks the necessary concepts.”</p>
   <p>The blossoming of what had been merely another, slowly waxing blue star, jerked Trevelyan to alertness. He sat up, clenched hands on chair arms, and stared at the simulacrum until his vision seemed to drown in those glittering dark depths. The star climbed in brilliance even as he watched, for <emphasis>Genji</emphasis> passed the wave front of the initial explosion and entered that which had come later. It dominated the whole sky before Trevelyan could shout:</p>
   <p>“Supernova!”</p>
   <p>And still it flamed higher, until its one searing point gave fifty times the light that full Luna does to Earth, ten million times the light of the next most luminous—and nearby—sun. Although the screens throttled down that terrible whiteness, Trevelyan could not look close to it, and his vision was fogged with shining spots for minutes after the glimpse he had first gotten.</p>
   <p>Smokesmith’s claws clicked on the deck of the conn section as the Reardonite entered. Trevelyan caught a hackle-raising whiff from him and knew he was equally awed. Perhaps his expressionless phrasing was a defense:</p>
   <p>“Yes, a supernova of Type II, if the theoretical accounts I have witnessed are correct. They are estimated to occur at the rate of one every fifty-odd years in the galaxy. The remnants of some have been investigated, but to date no outburst has been observed within the range of recorded explorations.”</p>
   <p>“We've gone beyond that range already,” the man whispered. He shook himself. “Is Murdoch headed toward it?”</p>
   <p>“Approximately. No change in course.”</p>
   <p>“Can’t be coincidence. He must have traveled far, looking for game the Cordys wouldn’t take from him, and—” Roughly: “Let’s get some readings.”</p>
   <p>Instruments, astrophysical files carried on every Service vessel, and computation produced a few answers. The star was about one hundred fifty parsecs away, which meant it had died five centuries ago. It had been a blue giant, with a mass of some ten Sols, an intrinsic luminosity of perhaps fifty thousand; but the Scorpian clouds had hidden it from early Terrestrial astronomers, and modern scientists were as yet too busy to come this far afield.</p>
   <p>So wild a burning could not go on for many million years. Instabilities built up until the great star shattered itself. At the peak of its explosion, it flooded forth energy equal to the output of the rest of the galaxy.</p>
   <p>That could last for no more than days, of course. Racing down the light-years, Trevelyan saw the lurid splendor fade. A mistiness began to grow, a nebula born of escaped gases, rich in new nuclei of the heavier elements, destined at last to enter into the formation of new suns and planets. Instruments picked out the core of the star: whitely shining, fiercer still in the X-ray spectrum, lethal to come near. But it collapsed rapidly beneath its own monstrous gravitation, to the size of a dwarf, a Jupiter, an Earth. At the end of megayears it would be so dense that nothing, not even light, could leave; and it would have vanished.</p>
   <p>Trevelyan said with bleak anger: “He didn’t report it. The information that’s already been lost as the wave front swelled—”</p>
   <p>“Shall we return at once?” the Reardonite asked.</p>
   <p>“Well . . . no I suppose not. If we let Murdoch go. Cosmos knows what deviltry might happen. There’ll be other supernovas, but a dead sentience doesn’t come back.”</p>
   <p>“We have a strong indication of his goal.”</p>
   <p>“What?” Trevelyan set down the pipe he had been nervously loading.</p>
   <p>“Examine the photomultiplier screen, and next these.” Finger-tendrils snaked across dial faces. “The star to which I point is an ordinary G3 sun within a hundred light-years of the supernova. Proper motions show that it was somewhat closer at the time of the eruption. Our study object is on an unmistakable intercept track. It is plausible that this is meant to terminate there.”</p>
   <p>“But— No!” Trevelyan protested. “What can he want?”</p>
   <p>“The dosage received by any planet of the lesser sun, through the cosmic rays given off by the larger at its maximum, was in the thousands of roentgens, delivered in a period of days. Atmosphere and magnetic field would have provided some shielding, but the effect must nonetheless have been biologically catastrophic. Presumably, though, most lower forms of life would survive, especially vegetable and marine species. A new ecological balance would soon be struck, doubtless unstable and plagued by a high mutation rate but converging upon stability. Probably the infall of radionuclides, concentrated in certain areas by natural processes, would make caution advisable to the present time. But on the whole, this hypothetical planet could now be salubrious for your race or mine, if it otherwise resembles our homes sufficiently. I might add that it has been conjectured that accidents of this sort were responsible for periods of massive extinction on numerous worlds, including your own home sphere.”</p>
   <p>Trevelyan scarcely heard the flat words. All at once he was confronting horror.</p>
   <p>When the yellow sun was a disk, too lightful for bare eyes but softly winged with corona and zodiacal glow in a stepdown screen: then the supernova nebula, thirty parsecs off, was only an irregular blur, a few minutes across, among the constellations opposite, as if a bit of the Milky Way had drifted free. One had trouble imagining how it had raged in these skies four hundred years ago. Nor did interplanetary space any longer have an unusual background count; nor did the seven attendant worlds that <emphasis>Genji's</emphasis> cameras identified seem in any way extraordinary.</p>
   <p>That was a false impression, Trevelyan knew. Every world is a wilderness of uncountably many uniquenesses. But the third one out, on which his attention focused, resembled Earth.</p>
   <p>He was confined to optical means of study. Beams and probes might be detected aboard <emphasis>Campesino. </emphasis>Murdoch had gone out of hyper into normal mode several millions of kilometers back. His shadowers necessarily followed suit. Then— lest he spot their neutrino emission, as they were now tracking him by his—they stopped the fusion generators and orbited free at their considerable distance, drawing power from the accumulators.</p>
   <p>“The study object is in the final phase of approach to atmosphere of the terrestroid planet,” Smokesmith announced.</p>
   <p>“I’m scarcely surprised,” Trevelyan answered. He looked up from his meters and notes. “Apparently it is as terrestroid as any you’ll ever find, too. Air, irradiation, size, mass as gotten from the satellites—nearly identical. Those are two small, fairly close-in moons, by the way; so the tide patterns must be complicated, but the oceans will be kept from stagnation. Twenty-eight-hour spin, twelve-degree tilt. Mean temperature a touch higher than Earth’s, no polar caps, somewhat less land area ... an interglacial macroclimate, I’d guess. In short, aside from pockets of left-over radioactivity, idyllic.”</p>
   <p>“And possible ecological difficulties,” the Reardonite said.</p>
   <p>Trevelyan winced. “Damn, did you have to remind me?” He left off peering, leaned back in his chair, held his chin and scowled. “Question is, what do we do about Murdoch? He doesn’t seem to have committed any violation except failure to register a discovery. And we probably couldn’t prove this isn’t his own first time here, that he didn’t come this way on impulse. Besides, the offense is trivial.”</p>
   <p>“Do methods not exist of compelling humans to speak truth?”</p>
   <p>“Yes. Electronic brainphasing. Quite harmless. But our species has rules against involuntary selfincrimination. So it’s mainly used to prove the honesty of prosecution witnesses. And as I said, I’ve no case against him.”</p>
   <p>“Need we do more than report back? Authorized expeditions could then be dispatched.”</p>
   <p>“ ‘Back’ is a mighty long ways. What might he do here meanwhile? Of course . . . hm-m-m ... if Murdoch doesn’t suspect we’re on to him, he may proceed leisurely with his preparations, giving us a chance to —”</p>
   <p>“The study object has ceased to emit.”</p>
   <p>“What?” Trevelyan surged from his chair. He abraded his arm on his companion’s integument, so fast did he brush by to look for himself. The indications were subtle, because the normal neutrino count is always high. But this tracer included a computer which identified engine sign amidst noise and put its volume on a single dial. That needle had fallen to zero.</p>
   <p>Chilled, Trevelyan said: “He’s going down on accumulators and aerodynamics. By the time we come in range for a different tracking method, he can be wherever on the surface.”</p>
   <p>Smokesmith’s tone was unchanging, but an acrid odor jetted from him and the petals of his face stirred. “Apparently he does not fear detection from the ground. We observe no trace of atomic energy, hence doubtless no one capable of locating it. The probability is that he desires to remove us and none else from his trail.”</p>
   <p>“Yeh.” Trevelyan began to pace, back and forth between the caging bulkheads. “We half expected he’d tag us somewhere along the line, when I’d already put him on the <emphasis>qui vive</emphasis> in Port Nevada. But why’s he telling us unequivocally that he has?”</p>
   <p>“In my race, messages are always intended as vectors on the world line of the percipient.”</p>
   <p>“In mine, too, sort of.” Trevelyan’s strides lengthened. “What does Murdoch hope to get us to do by thumbing his nose at us? We have two alternatives. We can go straight back, or we can land first for a closer look.”</p>
   <p>“The latter would not add significantly to the interval before we can have returned.”</p>
   <p>“That’s the black deuce of it, my friend. The very nearest Service base where we could originate any kind of investigatory expedition is Lir, I suppose, if they aren’t still too busy with the Storm Queen affair. There are frontier planets closer than that, full of men who’ll gladly swarm here for a chance of striking it rich. And if they can also do the Cordys one in the eye, why, fine.”</p>
   <p>“Furthermore,” Smokesmith pointed out, “we have no clear proof that anything is involved sufficiently important to justify a long-range mission. The supernova, yes. That is a scientific treasure. But here we have merely a seemingly uninhabited planet. Why should a base commander who does not know Murdoch’s past—especially a nonhuman base commander who cannot ingest its significance— assume he has an unlawful purpose? Will he not expect Murdoch to request an inspection team, that a patent of discovery may be issued?”</p>
   <p>Trevelyan nodded. We arc scattered so thinly, we who guard the great Pact. Often we must pass by tracks that may well lead toward a hidden evil, because we <emphasis>know</emphasis> about another beast elsewhere. Or we learn of something that was wrong at the beginning and should have been stopped, but whose amendment now would be a worse wrong. We have Nerthus, for example, always before us: a human colony founded and flourishing, then learning that native intelligent life did exist. We are fortunate that in that case the interests of the two species are reconcilable, with endless difficulty.</p>
   <p>“Does Murdoch wish us to return in alarm bearing data inadequate to provoke prompt official action?” Smokesmith queried. “That seems plausible. Coming as he lately did from the Union’s Scorpian march, he must be better informed than we about current situations there.</p>
   <p>Thus, he might know we can get no help at Lir.”</p>
   <p>“We can . . . we can even commandeer civilian ships and personnel—if yonder planet has sentient beings on it. Clear and present danger of territorial conquest. Or Murdoch might simply be plundering them.”</p>
   <p>“It is improbable that such are alive.”</p>
   <p>“True. If dead—”</p>
   <p>Trevelyan stopped. He looked long outward. Unmagnified, the world was a point of light, a clear and lovely blue. But close in would be mapless immensity. The other crew would have had ample chance to conceal their vessel. They could be anywhere, preparing anything. They surely outnumbered and outgunned him. He hated to imagine big, bluff Murdoch Juan as planning murder. On the other hand, Faustina might, and she had had this entire voyage in which to be the only human female . . .</p>
   <p>Resolution crystallized. “We’re going in,” he said.</p>
   <p>They approached slowly, both to observe in detail and to make certain preparations. Circling in the fringes of atmosphere, they confirmed the thing they had guessed at.</p>
   <p>This had been a peopled world. The people had been slain.</p>
   <p>Were there survivors, there would be evidence of them. Civilization might well have gone under in mass death, panic, anarchy, and famine after crops perished in fields now brushland or desert. But savage descendants of a city-building race would live in villages. <emphasis>Genii's </emphasis>sensors would register their very campfires. Besides, it was more reasonable that some comeback would have been made, however weak. For the sleet of cosmic radiation harmed no buildings, no tools or machines, no books—little, indeed, except what was alive.</p>
   <p>Gazing into a viewscreen, where clouds parted briefly to show high towers by a lake, Trevelyan said: “Populous, which means they had efficient agriculture and transportation, at least in their most advanced regions. I can identify railway lines and the traces of roads. Early industrial, I’d guess, combustion engines, possible limited use of electricity . . . But they had more aesthetic sense, or something, than most cultures at that technological level. They kept beauty around them.” He hauled his thoughts away from what that implied. If he did not stay impersonal, he must weep.</p>
   <p>“Did they succumb to radiation effects alone?” Smokesmith wondered. He appeared to have no trouble maintaining detachment. But then, he did not feel humanlike emotions, as Trevelyan judged the dead beings had. “Shelter was available.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe they didn’t know about radioactivity. Or maybe the escapers were too few, too scattered, too badly mutated. Anyhow, they’re gone—Hold!”</p>
   <p>Trevelyan’s hands danced over the board. <emphasis>Genji</emphasis> swung about, backtracked, and came to hover.</p>
   <p>Atmosphere blurred the magnified view, but beams, detectors, and computer analysis helped. A town stood on an island in a wide river. Thus, despite the bridges that soared from bank to bank, it was not thickly begrown by vegetation. What had entered was largely cleared away: recent work, the rawness identifiable. The job had been done by machines, a couple of which stood openly in a central plaza. Trevelyan couldn’t spot details, but never doubted they were Earth-made robotic types. Several buildings had been blasted, either as too ruinous or as being in the way, and the rubble shoved aside. He got no indications of current activity, but strong electronic resonance suggested that a modern power network was partly completed.</p>
   <p>“Murdoch,” Trevelyan said like a curse.</p>
   <p>“Can you obtain indications of his ship?” the Reardonite asked.</p>
   <p>“No. When he detected us approaching, he must have moved her, and screened as well as camouflaged the hull. Maybe he hoped we wouldn’t chance to notice what he’s been up to, or maybe this is another gibe. Certainly he must’ve gotten busy here the instant he landed, after choosing the site on his first visit.”</p>
   <p>Trevelyan put the speedster back into orbit. For a while the conn held only a humming silence. The planet filled half the sky with clouds, seas, sunrises and sunsets; the other half was stars.</p>
   <p>“No autochthons left,” Smoke- smith mused at last. “Their relics are of limited scientific interest. Will this be adjudged grounds for sending armed craft, that are badly needed elsewhere, to make him stop?’</p>
   <p>“Supposing it is—that’s uncertain, as you say, but supposing it is<emphasis>—can</emphasis> they stop him?” Trevelyan seized the controls again. The power hum deepened. “Prepare for descent.”</p>
   <p>He chose a city near the edge of morning, that he might have a long daylight. A mole jutted from its waterfront into an emerald-and- sapphire bay. Sonic beams declared it to be of reinforced concrete, as firm as the day it was dedicated. He landed there, and presently walked forth. A grav sled would have taken him faster and easier, but part of his aim was to get to know somewhat about those who were departed. His ship, all systems on standby, fell behind him like a coppery cenotaph.</p>
   <p>He didn’t worry about the safety of the environment. Murdoch had proven that for him. What had still to be learned was mere detail: for instance, what imported crops would do well?</p>
   <p>Any number, Trevelyan felt sure. It was a rich and generous planet. No doubt it had been more so before the catastrophe, but it remained wonderful enough, and nature was fast healing the wounds.</p>
   <p>The bay glittered and chuckled between golden-green hills. At its entrance began an ocean; coming down, he had identified fantastically big shoals of marine plants and animals. No birds rode the wind that rumpled his hair. Most, perhaps all vertebrates were extinct. But lower forms had survived the disaster. Insects, or their equivalent, swarmed on delicate wings that often threw back the sunlight in rainbows. Silvery forms leaped from the water. The wind smelled of salt, iodine, and life.</p>
   <p>Overhead wandered some clouds, blue-shadowed in a dazzlingly blue heaven. At this season, the supernova was aloft by day, invisible. Disaster, Trevelyan thought with a shudder. How little had Earth’s ancient astrologers known of how terrible a word they were shaping!</p>
   <p>But the day was sunny, cool, and peaceful. He walked shoreward, looking.</p>
   <p>The watercraft had sunk or drifted free of their rotted lines. However, the shallower water inshore was so clear that he could see a few where they lay, somewhat preserved. The gracious outlines of the sailboats did not astonish him; that demand was imposed by natural law. But his eyes stung to think that the dead had loved sloops and yawls as much as he did. And they had put bronze figureheads on many, whose green-corroded remnants hinted at flowers, wings, flames, anything fair and free. A large ship had drifted aground. It had been iron-hulled and, judging from the stacks, steam-propelled. But it, no, she had also been designed to look like a dancer on the waves.</p>
   <p>He neared the quay. A row of wooden warehouses (?) was partly moldered away, partly buried under vines. Nevertheless he could make out how roofs once swept in high curves that the doorways matched. A rusting machine, probably a crane, was decorated at the end of its lifting arm with a merry animal face.</p>
   <p>He stood for some while before an arch at the head of the mole. Here the dwellers had represented themselves.</p>
   <p>Their art was not photographic. It had a swing of line and mass that woke a pulse in Trevelyan, it was not quite like anything he had ever seen before. But the bipeds with their long slim six-fingered hands, long necks and long-beaked heads, came through to him as if still alive. He almost thought he could hear their stone cloaks flap in the wind.</p>
   <p>Walking further into the city, he began to find their bones.</p>
   <p>Carrion eaters had seldom or never disturbed them. Dust blew in, settled on pavement, became soil; seeds followed, struck frail roots that gradually crumbled brick and concrete; bushes and vines grew over that first carpet and up the walls; those kinds of trees that survived extended their range into the domains of trees that had not, and beyond that into farm and town. But the invasion was slow. The wilderness had all the time in the world. It was in full occupation of the shoreward edges of this city, and reducing the next line, but as yet just a few forerunners and— Trevelyan thought with a hurtful smile—sappers had won this near the waterfront.</p>
   <p>The buildings of granite, marble, and masonry rose tall, washed by rain and sunlight, little damaged by weather, only occasional creepers blurring their outlines. Like the relief sculpture on their walls, they leaped and soared, not as man-built skyscrapers do but in that peculiar rhythm which made their heights seem to fly. They were colonnaded, balustrated, many-windowed, and kept some of the coloring that once softened their austerity.</p>
   <p>Trevelyan wondered at the absence of parks or gardens. His observations from altitude had suggested a deep-reaching love of landscape and care for it. And floral motifs were about the commonest decorations. Well, the dwellers had not been human; it would take long to get some insight into what their race psyche might have been. Maybe they enjoyed the contrast of art and openness. If this place was typical, every city was a delight to live in. At some economic sacrifice, the dwellers had avoided filling their air and water with noise, dirt, and poison. To be sure, they were lucky that no heating was required. But as far as Trevelyan had been able to ascertain, industrial plants were widely scattered outside urban limits, connected by railways. There were no automobiles, though that was probably within the technological capabilities. Instead, he found the depictions, and some bones, of large quadrupeds that served like horses; he also identified the hulks of what appeared to have been public vehicles with primitive electric motors. It was hard to tell after four hundred years, but he at least got the impression that, while theirs was a productive and prosperous civilization, the dwellers had not created overly much trash either. They could have foreseen the problem and taken steps. He’d like to know.</p>
   <p>Not that they were saints. He came upon statues and dimmed murals which showed combat. Twice, above inscriptions he would never interpret, he saw a being dressed in rags bursting chains off himself; no doubt somebody put those chains on in the first place. But most often he found imagery which he read as of affection, gentleness, work, teaching, discovery, or the sheer splendor of being alive.</p>
   <p>He entered courtyards, walked past dried pools and fountains, on into the buildings. Few had elevators, which was suggestive since the culture could have supplied them. He noted that the shafts of the wide circular staircases would easily accommodate grav lifts. The murals indoors were scarcely faded;-their vividness took some of the grief off him. Nevertheless, and although he was not superstitious or even especially religious, he knocked on the first door he came to.</p>
   <p>Every door was sliding or folding, none bore locks or latches, which again implied unusual traits. The majority of apartments had been deserted. Cloth had decayed, metal tarnished, plaster cracked, and dust fallen centimeters thick. But the furnishings remained usable by humans, who were formed quite like the dwellers. Clean and patch up; restore the water supply; make do with the airily-shaped oil lanterns, if need be, and a campstove since the original owners didn’t seem to have cooked anything; throw padding over chairs, divans, beds, intricately grained floors: and you would be altogether comfortable. Soon power would become available, and you could change the place around until it was ideal.</p>
   <p>Early in the game, though, you’d better get rid of those pictures, papers, enigmatic tools, and shelves full of books. They could be disturbing to live with.</p>
   <p>As the hours passed, Trevelyan did find skeletons in a few apartments. Either these individuals had died by surprise, like those he infrequently noticed in the streets, or they desired privacy for their final day. One lay in a kind of chaise longue, with a book upon what had been the lap. Twice he found small skeletons covered by a large one. Did the mother understand that death was coming from the sky? Yes, she could see it up there, a point of radiance too brilliant to look near, surrounded by the auroras it evoked in this atmosphere. Probably she knew that death was everywhere. But she was driven by the instinct of Niobe.</p>
   <p>When he discovered the ossuary, Trevelyan decided there must be several, and this was how the average dweller had elected to go. It was in a large hall—theater? auditorium? temple? The most susceptible must already have died, and radiation sickness be upon the rest. In man it approaches its terminus with nausea, vomiting, hair coming out, internal bleeding, blood from the orifices and eyes, strengthlessness, fever, and delirium. Doubtless it was similar for the dwellers.</p>
   <p>Outside were the remnants of several improvised coal furnaces. Their pipes fed into the sealed hall, carbon monoxide generators. Bones and rusted weapons nearby suggested the operators had finished their task and then themselves. The door was the single tightly fastened one Trevelyan had encountered, but being wooden it yielded to his boot in a cloud of punk. Beyond lay the skeletons of adults, hundreds of them, and many more young, and toys, games, cups, banners, musical instruments—<emphasis>I don’t know what they did at that party,</emphasis> Trevelyan thought, <emphasis>but if we humans had the same guts, we’d tell the children that Carnival came early this year.</emphasis></p>
   <p>He walked back out into the bright quiet. Something like a butterfly went past, though its wings were fairer than anything evolved on Earth. Being a little of an antiquarian, he said aloud: “The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away; I will not bless the name of the Lord. But I will remember. Oh, yes, I will remember.”</p>
   <p>He had not gone much further toward the middle of town when he heard a thunder rumble. Looking up past the towertops, he saw the great shining form of <emphasis>Campesino </emphasis>descend. She came between him and the sun and covered him with her shadow.</p>
   <p>Reflexively, he took shelter in a doorway. One hand dropped to his pistol. With a sour grin at himself, he activated the tiny radio transceiver in his tunic pocket. On the standard band, he heard Murdoch’s voice: “Cordy ahoy! Respond!”</p>
   <p>The empty speedster made no reply. A drone and a quivering went through the air as <emphasis>Campesino</emphasis> balanced on her gravs.</p>
   <p>“You!” Murdoch barked. “We picked up your tachyons halfway to here. We followed you down by your neutrinos. Don’t try bluffing us about having a friend in reserve. You’re alone, and we’ve got a cyclic blast zeroed in, and I want to speak with you.”</p>
   <p>More silence in the receivers. Trevelyan felt the sweat on his ribs, under his arms, and smelled it. He could not foretell what would happen. At best, he had sketched behavior patterns Murdoch might adopt and responses he might make. His plan amounted to creating a situation where he could improvise—whether successfully or not.</p>
   <p>A barely distinguishable background growl: “No one inside, I'd guess. Exploring the city?”</p>
   <p>“Could be,” Murdoch said. “Odd they’d leave their boat unguarded.”</p>
   <p>“A trap?”</p>
   <p>“Well—maybe. Don’t seem Cordy style, but maybe we better keep clear.”</p>
   <p>Trevelyan did in fact wish <emphasis>Campesino</emphasis> to set down elsewhere, making <emphasis>Genji</emphasis> less of a hostage. He decided to push matters, trod forth and shot a flash from his gun into the air. It crackled. Ozone touched his nostrils.</p>
   <p>“Look! Below! You, do you read us?”</p>
   <p>Trevelyan saw no sense in giving away the fact that he could listen. He might gain some slight advantage thereby; and Cosmos knew, with that metal stormcloud hanging above him, he needed whatever help he could get. He waved and jogged off toward the city center, where he had noticed a plaza from above.</p>
   <p>After a conference he couldn’t make out, the others did what he would have done in their place. <emphasis>Campesino</emphasis> opened a hatch and discharged a grav sled wifh a man or two aboard. Not carrying missiles, she could give them no effective armament. But they would hover near <emphasis>Genji</emphasis> and cry warning of anything suspicious. The ship herself dropped behind the towers. When she landed, the ground trembled and echoes boomed slowly from wall to wall.</p>
   <p>Trevelyan switched off his radio speaker, turned on the transmitter, and hastened his trot. Once he accidentally kicked a skull. It rolled aside with a dry clatter. <emphasis>I’m sorry, </emphasis>he thought to it. That being not altogether alien to him had felt this street underfoot, sunwarmth reflected off cataractlike facades, muscle movement, heartbeat, breath. The city had lived around the being, with friends, loves, traffic, music, pleasure . . . did the race laugh? <emphasis>I may be joining you soon</emphasis> he added, and scorned himself for the juvenilism.</p>
   <p>He emerged not on a square but a golden rectangle. Grassy growth was thrusting up and apart those blocks which had paved it, but the rains of four centuries had not quite washed out the grooves worn by generations of feet. The enclosing buildings were lower here. Their lines bespoke tranquility rather than excitement, though three of them held the fragments of dazzling stained-glass windows. Numerous skeletons lay prostrated before one. <emphasis>Campesino</emphasis> rose brutal from the plaza center.</p>
   <p>Several men and not-men waited, guns at the ready. They were a hard-looking gang. Murdoch stood at ease, Faustina tensed beside him. Both wore black coveralls with silver ornamentation. Her hair glowed in the light. Trevelyan approached at a reduced pace, hands well away from his pistol.</p>
   <p>“Mike!” the adventurer bawled. He threw back his head in laughter that made his moustaches vibrate. “Why the chaos didn’t I expect you’d be the one?”</p>
   <p>“Who else with you?” Faustina said.</p>
   <p>Trevelyan shrugged. “Who with you?” he countered.</p>
   <p>“You’ve seen our roster,” Murdoch said. “I figured you’d refuse to board, afraid we’d grab you, so I came out.” He jerked a thumb at the sheer hull behind. “Got a full complement inside at alert stations.”</p>
   <p>Trevelyan achieved a smile. “What makes you expect trouble, Juan?” he asked in his mildest voice.</p>
   <p>Murdoch blinked. “Why . . . you dogged us clear from Earth—”</p>
   <p>“No, think,” Trevelyan said. “Space is free. The Coordination Service investigates where it can, but forbids violence to its agents except under extreme necessity. You know that as well as I do.”</p>
   <p>The guards around shifted stance, muttered among themselves, flicked eyes from side to side. Trevelyan virtually felt the unease in them.</p>
   <p>“For example,” he drawled, “You’re breaking the law here, first by not reporting a discovery—” “We’ve only just made it!’ Faustina said. Red stained the white cheekbones. Her fists were clenched. He studied her for a moment, thinking with compassion: <emphasis>She's afraid I'll take away her glory —her chance to rake in money until she can lose the fear of being poor that was ground into her,</emphasis> and with caution: <emphasis>In an aggressive human personality, fear begets ruthlessness.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Please let me finish,” he said. “I’m not interested in lodging charges, nor would my superiors be. The offense probably occurs hundreds of times a year, and seldom matters. Out of necessity, the Service operates on the old principle that the law should not concern itself with trifles,”</p>
   <p>She stepped back, breathing hard, lips pulled away from teeth, but plainly bemused. Murdoch’s massive features had grown immobile. “Continue,” he said.</p>
   <p>“You’ve committed a more important breach of law by tampering with and destroying material of scientific value.” Trevelyan kept his tone amiable and a faint smile on his mouth. “I refer to that island city. But the planet is such an archaeological and biological Golconda that we’ll overlook your indiscretion, we’ll put it down to an amateur’s forgivable enthusiasm, in exchange for the service you’ve done to civilization by bringing this world to our knowledge. You’ll remember an agent like me has authority to issue pardons in minor cases. I’ll write you one today, if you wish, and recommend you for next year’s Polaris Medal into the bargain.”</p>
   <p>He offered his hand. “Stop worrying,” he said. “Let’s have a drink and go home together.”</p>
   <p>Murdoch did not take the hand. The big man stood for a while, staring, and the silence of the dead grew and grew. He broke it with a whisper: “Are you serious?”</p>
   <p>Trevelyan dropped pretense. He said in a hardened voice, while his nerves felt the surrounding guns: “It’s an honest offer. You already have Good Luck to make your living off. Be content with that.”</p>
   <p>“Good Luck?” Faustina cried. She swept one arm in a taloned arc. “You idiot! <emphasis>This</emphasis> is Good Luck!”</p>
   <p>“I kept hoping it wasn’t,” Trevelyan said low.</p>
   <p>“What do you figure I had in mind?” Murdoch demanded.</p>
   <p>“Obvious,” Trevelyan sighed. “Here was your real discovery. But how to exploit it? You couldn’t get a patent, because the Union would forbid colonization until the scientists finished their researches. Considering the distance, and the shortage of personnel, and the vast amount there is to study, that would take at least a hundred years, probably longer. In fact, the odds are we’d put a secrecy seal on the coordinates for a decade or two, to keep unqualified visitors away until a big enough enterprise got started and the scientists could do their own guarding.”</p>
   <p>“Scientists!” Faustina nearly shrieked.</p>
   <p>“What a means to a fortune, though!” the coordinator said. “You could offer an utterly desirable home, complete with every facility for hundreds of millions of people, at a price the ordinary colonial can afford. You stood to become one of the wealthiest humans that ever lived.</p>
   <p>“Well, you went looking for a world we wouldn’t disallow. What you turned up isn’t particularly good. But it’s no worse than some which have been settled, and at least doesn’t have a population already squeezing its meager resources. People would buy your real estate there, if the preliminary work had been done for them and the cost was not beyond their means.</p>
   <p>“Some you actually would take to the marginal planet—say when an agent like me happened to be around. You’d lose money on them. But it wouldn’t matter, because most would be shipped here, where entire cities cost you practically nothing. They’d write home. Your ships would carry the overjoyed mail, maybe censoring it a wee bit to keep us Cordys from getting wind of your enterprise too soon. Not that we’d be likely to, when we’re run off our feet with urgent cases, and when few people on those thousands of entire worlds give us any active cooperation. You could carry on for a number of years, I’m sure, before the discrepancies got so glaring that we investigated.”</p>
   <p>“What’d you do after you learned?” Murdoch asked.</p>
   <p>“Nothing,” Trevelyan said. “How could we displace tens of thousands, maybe millions of men, women, and children, who’d come in good faith, started a good new life, put down roots, begun bringing forth a new generation? It’d be a political impossibility, a moral one, maybe a physical one. They’d fight for their homes, and we couldn’t bomb them, could we?</p>
   <p>“You personally would be subject to—in theory, confiscation of your properties and imprisonment of your body. In practice, you’d have put both where we couldn’t touch them without more effort and killing than it was worth. You’d have rigged the colonial government and its constitution early in the game to make you something like the Founding Father president of Good Luck. They’d fight for you, too. So, rather than violate its own prohibition on conquest—for the sake of scientific and aesthetic values that’d already been ruined—the Union would accept what you’d done to it.”</p>
   <p>Trevelyan closed his mouth. He felt hoarse and tired and wanted a smoke, but didn’t dare reach for his pipe under those guns.</p>
   <p>Murdoch nodded. “You read me good.” He chuckled. “Thanks for the Founding Father title. I hadn’t thought of that. Sounds like what I need.”</p>
   <p>“I can’t allow it, you know,” Trevelyan said.</p>
   <p>“Why not?” Murdoch grew curiously earnest. “What’s here, really? A worldful of bones. I’m sorry it happened, but dead’s dead. And they were, well, one more race among millions. What can we learn from them that matters? Oh, I suppose you can hope for a new technique or art form or whatever, that’ll revolutionize civilization. But you prob’ly understand better than me how small that chance is. Meanwhile, yonder we’ve got people who’re alive, and hurting, now.”</p>
   <p>“The planet will be opened for settlement, region by region, in due course.”</p>
   <p>“How long is due course? How many’ll die during it, that could’ve lived happier?”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p> <image l:href="#_1.jpg"/></p>
   <p>“Emigrants arc always replaced at home by fresh births. In the long run, the exact time of migration makes no difference.”</p>
   <p>“Forget the long run and think about flesh and blood.”</p>
   <p>Trevelyan’s anger broke his control. “Don’t hand me that guff, Murdoch,” he snapped. “You’re about as altruistic as a blast cannon.”</p>
   <p>“And you,” Faustina spat, “you’re a machine. I look forward to killing you—dismantling you!” “Wait, wait, there," Murdoch said. “Ease off and let’s talk sane.” He regarded the ground for a moment before he straightened, faced Trevelyan squarely, and said: “I’ll tell you how it lies. When we knew we were being dogged, we decided to lead you on, because once the supernova got reported, this sector would be swarmed and somebody else might find our Good Luck.</p>
   <p>“You could’ve skitted for home without landing. If you’d done that, we’d’ve made for the nearest human planets to here. We’d’ve rallied a lot of men, transported ’em free, gotten well dug in before you could raise any action at headquarters. It might’ve been enough to stop you from doing anything.”</p>
   <p>“I assumed that was your plan,” Trevelyan said. “On my way back, I’ll visit every Scorpian world and announce, without specifying location too closely, that this planet is interdicted to preserve cultural values. To come here then, knowingly, will justify and require violence by the Service. We do have to maintain the precedent.”</p>
   <p>“What makes you think you’re going back?” asked Faustina. She grinned with hatred.</p>
   <p>“Ease off,” Murdoch repeated. To Trevelyan: “I did hope you’d land, like you have. Waved a large red flag at you, didn’t I? You see, I knew you must have less beef than my ship. Now I’ve got you.”</p>
   <p>“What will you do with me?” the coordinator replied.</p>
   <p>“Well, uh, I’ll admit some of my mates got a little, uh, vehement,” Murdoch said. “But I don’t see any point in killing you. I sure don’t want to. You’re not a bad osco, Mike, for a Cordy. And they can’t have any idea on Earth which way we headed. I’m not about to return there; I’ve done my credit arranging. If they ask me about you later on, why, I never had any notion you were trying to follow me. You must’ve come to grief somehow, and I’m awful sorry. Maybe I’ll use your boat to fake some clues.”</p>
   <p>His mask of bashfulness fell away. He beamed. “Tell you what, Mike,” he said. “Let’s find you a nice island out in mid-ocean. We’ll leave you tools and supplies and show you what’s safe to eat. You Cordys are supposed to be philosophers. You should be glad of a few years for thinking. If you want, I’ll try to get you a woman. And soon’s I can, I’ll flit you to our spaceport we’ll’ve built. How’s that for a fair proposition?”</p>
   <p>Trevelyan savored the breath he drew, the light he saw, the will rising within him like a physical tide. “Let me be sure I understand you,” he said. “Do you seriously intend to maroon me in order that I won’t report the facts of this case?”</p>
   <p>“Too good for you,” Faustina said. “But if Juan’s that tender- spirited, yes.”</p>
   <p>“Do you realize that this involves grave violations of personal integrity?” Trevelyan asked. “Do you realize that it involves direct interference with an officer of the Union in the performance of his duty?”</p>
   <p>Murdoch flushed. “Your duty!”</p>
   <p>“I demand you let me go back to my spacecraft and depart unmolested,” Trevelyan said.</p>
   <p>Faustina snickered.</p>
   <p>“You will not?” Trevelyan asked. He waited. A breeze whispered.</p>
   <p>“Very well,” he said. “I can now testify under brainphasing that you are guilty of attempted crimes sufficient to justify your arrest. Will you come quietly with me?”</p>
   <p>“Have you lost your orbit?” Murdoch exclaimed.</p>
   <p>“Since you resist arrest in addition,” Trevelyan said, “the necessity of applying force becomes incontestable.”</p>
   <p>The guards jabbered, swore, and brought their weapons to bear. Faustina hissed. Murdoch’s hand streaked to his own pistol.</p>
   <p>Trevelyan ostentatiously folded his arms and said: “If my Service does not respect your rights, civilization is worthless. But civilization has rights of its own. I admit I led your thoughts away from my partner”—he heard a gasp and an oath —“but that scarcely constitutes entrapment. He’s under a roof in this city, on an accumulator-powered grav sled, along with several nuclear missiles. Through a miniradio in my pocket, he’s been listening to our conversation. If you don’t surrender yourselves, he’ll destroy you.”</p>
   <p>He paid scant attention to the uproar of the guards. His focus was entirely on their leaders.</p>
   <p>Murdoch yanked a transceiver from his jacket to speak an order.</p>
   <p>“Give them a demonstration, Smokcsmith,” Trevelyan said.</p>
   <p>No one saw the torpedo rise. It went too fast. Momentarily the sky was bedazzled with hell-colored flame. Concussion smote, not unduly hard from that altitude, but it shook men where they stood and bellowed in their ears. The bones before the temple shuddered.</p>
   <p>“A bit close,” Trevelyan said. He was aware that his own body quivered and went dry in the mouth. A remote part of him decided this was an unintegratc reaction and he needed more training. Speech and reasoning mind, though, were steel cold. “We may want antirad shots. I think you’ll agree, Juan, the next can drop right here. Afterward my</p>
   <p>Reardonite friend won’t have trouble picking off your watchmen.”</p>
   <p>“You’ll be dead, too,” Murdoch groaned.</p>
   <p>“I don’t want to be,” Trevelyan said, “but rather more is at stake than what I want.”</p>
   <p>Faustina whipped around behind Murdoch. She snatched his gun from the holster, flung herself forward and rammed the muzzle into Trevelyan’s belly. “Oof!” he choked. / <emphasis>don't exactly cut a heroic figure, do I?</emphasis> flashed through him. <emphasis>But the beings here only had what dignity they could make for themselves, after heaven's meaningless anger fell on them.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I’ll kill you myself!” she raved.</p>
   <p>He knew tricks for knocking the weapon aside and taking it from her. But others were trained on him. He met her eyes, from which the tears went flooding, and said: “If you do, why should my partner not destroy you?”</p>
   <p>Murdoch wrenched the gun from her. She raked at his face. He knocked her down. Panting, sweat a-river on his skin, he said: “What do you want?”</p>
   <p>“If you know something about Reardonites,” Trevelyan said, and saw that Murdoch did, “you realize it won’t bother Smokcsmith to annihilate me along with you. But he agrees it’s undesirable. So is the destruction of this beautiful plaza. Let’s compromise.”</p>
   <p>“I asked what do you want, you devil?”</p>
   <p>“Safe conduct back to my vessel. Smokesmith will monitor me by radio. Your ship will stay put. At the first sign of any ill faith whatsoever, he shoots. At worst, you see, he must eliminate both ships and hooe this world gets rediscovered by someone who’ll respect it. Once aloft, I’ll quickly drop down again and pick him up, too quickly for you to rise. At that point you’ll be helpless, but have no fears. With a head start and a faster craft, I’ll be on the frontier planets before you, issuing prohibitions. No one’s going to follow you when he knows it’ll bring warships down on him. I suggest you find a place and lie low.”</p>
   <p>Murdoch beat fist into palm, again and again. For a minute he looked old and hollowed out.</p>
   <p>Then his mirth awoke. “You win this ’un too, Mike,” he said. “I’ll escort you to your boat personal. Here.” He offered his pistol. Trevelyan accepted it.</p>
   <p>Faustina sat up. A bruise was spreading on her slim jaw where her lover’s fist had smitten. She looked at them both, through tears and matted locks, and was no longer anything except a bewildered beaten child.</p>
   <p>“Why?” she pleaded. “Why can’t we have a patent—when w-w-we found the supernova for you? You’d do this—wreck everything— for two, three hundred s-s-special-ists ... and their <emphasis>curiosity?”</emphasis></p>
   <p>Trevelyan hunkered down before her. He took both her hands in one of his. The other pointed around, ending at the temple. “No,” he said most gently. “For these. Have they no rights? That someone shall come to know them, and they won’t be lost from us.”</p>
   <p>But she did not understand. We guard the great Pact, which is the heart of civilization, of society, and ultimately of life itself: the unspoken Pact between the living, the dead, and the unborn, that to the best of poor mortal abilities they shall all be kept one in the oneness of time. Without it, nothing would have meaning and it may be that nothing would survive. But the young generations so often do not understand.</p>
