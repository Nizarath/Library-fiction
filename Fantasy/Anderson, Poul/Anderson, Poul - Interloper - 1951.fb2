  <section>
   <p>The spaceboat slipped down, slowly and stealthily on its gravitic beams, toward the sea which rolled restlessly under the moon. For a moment the broken moonlight seemed to spread outward in little ripples of cold fire, then the boat had gone beneath the water surface.</p>
   <p>It struck bottom not far down, for the beach was only half a mile distant, and lay there wrapped in darkness. Briefly, there was no movement or sound. Then the outer airlock valve opened and Beoric swam to the surface.</p>
   <p>The night was vast and dark around him. He saw with complete clarity, in the thin fickle moonlight, but he could not make out any living thing. Sea and sky and the shadowy shoreline — momentarily, the thought of what must be waiting for him was utterly daunting, his heart felt cold in his breast, in all the centuries of his life he had never been so alone. He felt something of the ultimate loneliness of death.</p>
   <p><emphasis>A thought slipped into his mind, cool and unhuman as the sea depths from which it rose: The creature is waiting. He has been waiting for an hour or more, in the shadows under the trees.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Beoric’s answering thought was a reaction of near panic: <emphasis>Don't! They may be able to detect us, after all</emphasis> —</p>
   <p><emphasis>In all the thousands of years, they have given no sign of being responsive to our special wave band. It is, of course, best not to take chances, not to communicate directly with you oftener than necessary. But we will be listening to your thoughts all the time.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>You are not alone.</emphasis> The new thought came from the shore, somewhere behind the line of trees under which the alien waited. <emphasis>We are with you, Beoric.</emphasis></p>
   <p>It heartened him immensely. Whatever came, whatever happened — he was not altogether alone. Though all the powers of the universe be ranged against him, he had a few on his side. But — so few!</p>
   <p>He struck out for the shore, swimming with long easy strokes that seemed to ride the waves. The moon-whitened beach came nearer, until he was wading through the shallows and up onto dry ground.</p>
   <p>The creature who had been waiting stirred in the shadows. Beoric’s night-seeing eyes swept over the gross black bulk of him, and for another moment fear was cold along his own spine. But — it was too late now. Even had he wanted to back our, after the long centuries of which this night might be the culmination, it was too late.</p>
   <p>He ran across the beach and ducked behind a tree, as if he hoped the creature had not seen him. And he sent his thoughts probing forth at the mind of the other, as if he were trying to detect whether the thing were intelligent or nor. If it should be a member of the dominant race here, the next logical step would be to seize control of its brain and —</p>
   <p>The defensive reaction was so swift and savagely strong that Beoric’s own mind reeled. For an instant his head swam, he seemed to be sinking into an illimitable darkness — almost, the thing had control of him! Then his nervous energy surged back, he threw a hard shield about his brain and sent a thought stabbing along the universally detectable wave band:</p>
   <p>“Apparently your race has mastered the secrets of telepathy. If you are that far advanced, you will probably be able to guess my origin.”</p>
   <p>“Not guess — know!” The answering thought shivered violently in his brain. There must be an incredible force housed in that great scaly body. Beoric caught overtones of a dark amusement: “I thought at first you must be one of the natives — your appearance is almost identical — but obviously you are not.”</p>
   <p>“Then — you don’t belong here — either?”</p>
   <p>“Of course not. Wherever you are from, it must be from quite a distance or we would have encountered your people before. But your initial reaction to my presence suggests that you are used to the concept and techniques of visiting someone else’s planet.”</p>
   <p>“I am.” In the closed circle of his private thoughts, Beoric felt a sudden harsh laughter of his own. Indeed he was! “But I had not expected to find other — guests — on this world.”</p>
   <p>He stepped out into the open. The moonlight gleamed coldly on his wet, waterproof tunic and kilts. His strange slant eyes, all cloudy blue without pupil or white, roved into the darkness where the monster still crouched. “Come out,” he invited. “Come out and bid me welcome.”</p>
   <p>“Of course.” The squat, enormously thick creature waddled out and stood under the moon. His blank reptilian eyes glittered as they swept over Beoric. Instinctively, the newcomer cocked his long pointed cars toward the monster, though the words that rolled and boomed in his skull had no sonic origin. “Yes — yes, you look very like a native. Except for those eyes and ears — but dark glasses and a hat will cover it very well. That high-cheeked cast of face, and very white skin, would also be considered unusual, but not so much so as to arouse great comment.”</p>
   <p>“Let me get my facts straight,” thought Beoric. “Just what planet is this? I mean, what is it called?”</p>
   <p>“The natives call it Earth, of course. Don’t all land dwelling races call their world Earth? The pronunciation in the local language — they still speak many separate tongues — is —” The monster thought the sound. “The sun is called Sol by them, and we use that term since it is easy to pronounce and all our names differ. This is Sol III, as you probably know.”</p>
   <p>“I knew it was the third planet, yes. But who are ‘we’? Is there more than one race of— visitors?”</p>
   <p>“Indeed. Indeed.” With sudden suspicion: ’‘But I am answering all the questions. Who are you? Where are you from? Where are your companions? What is your purpose? Why is there no iron in your spaceship? What sort of civilization has your race evolved?”</p>
   <p>“One thing at a time.” Beoric’s answer was taut and wary. “I will not give information away, but I will trade it for what you know. You cannot expect me, on finding a whole new interstellar civilization, to reveal all the secrets of my own until I am convinced of your good intentions.”</p>
   <p>“Fair enough. But who are you, then?”</p>
   <p>“My name, in the spoken language of my race, is Beoric, though that hardly matters. My home star lies clear across the Galaxy, near the periphery; I will not at present be more specific than that. My race, the Alfar, evolved a faster-than-light drive quite a long time ago, several centuries past in fact, and visited the nearer stars. Finally the expedition to which I belong was sent out on a survey which was to swing clear around the Galaxy, investigating stars picked at random so as to get a rough idea of overall conditions. But since we necessarily had to select only a small fraction of suns for study, it is not surprising that we passed right through your civilization without realizing it.”</p>
   <p>“Where is your ship? That little boat in which you landed could only hold one or two.”</p>
   <p>“You cannot expect me to reveal the ship’s orbit. I came down alone in the boat. The presence of cities here indicated intelligent life with some degree of technology, so I landed — secretly, of course — to investigate more thoroughly. Apparently you detected us some distance out.”</p>
   <p>“We spotted your boat, yes, by its gravitic vibrations. But not your ship. What sort of screen do you have for star drive vibrations? We’ve never been able to conceal them that well. And why is your boat chemically powered?”</p>
   <p>“The vibration screen must remain my secret. As for the oil-burning space-boat — well, we have evolved an unusual oil technology on Alfar.With the extreme efficiency of the gravity beam, we just don’t need atomic energy for such a small craft.”</p>
   <p>“I see. But I could detect no iron or silver in your boat — ”</p>
   <p>“Both metals are hard to obtain on Alfar. We manage quite well with alloys and with copper.” Beoric leaned forward, as if suddenly realizing he was giving away too much. “But it is your turn now. Who are you? Why are you here? Why this inquisition, rather than a free welcome?”</p>
   <p>“It is a long story,” thought the monster. “Nor have you been a model of openness. However —welcome to Earth. Perhaps you would like to come to our headquarters — ?”</p>
   <p>“Well — it would certainly be the most convenient starting point — I warn you, if I do not return to my ship within three rotations of this planet, they will be coming down after me — with weapons.”</p>
   <p>“You need have no fear. We are not greedy. Earth has plenty for all.” Beoric stood watching the bony, snouted face of the monster. It seemed to him that he could almost follow the being’s private thoughts:</p>
   <p><emphasis>Wherever this creature is from, whether or not he is telling the truth, he must be alone on this planet. We would have detected any other space vessel landing anywhere. Also, he is cut off from his companions. The inverse square law makes it impossible to send a thought more than a few hundred miles at most, and his ship must be further out or we would detect it. He is alone, unarmed, and incommunicado. In three days we can decide what to do —</emphasis></p>
   <p>“My vocal name is Hraagung. Come, we have a car waiting.”</p>
   <p>“A car — ?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, of course.” Hraagung chuckled, with a certain horrible sardonicism. “I was chosen to meet you, since my own senses could follow the metal of your boat without elaborate instruments. But for obvious reasons, I cannot move about openly on this planet.”</p>
   <p>“I have to get inside before dawn,” thought Beoric. “Alfar’s sun is dim and red, nearly extinct. For that reason, I can see very easily in this moonlight, but cannot endure the glare and the ultraviolet light of a G-type star.”</p>
   <p>“So?” Hraagung paused, and Beoric could almost see him turning this revelation over in his cold brain. It was an admission of weakness, to be sure, but it had to be made. And, to a highly advanced civilization with its screens and protective suits, the handicap was not serious. “What would you have done if you hadn’t met us?”</p>
   <p>“Hidden away by day and slept, of course. The fact that the cities were lighted showed that the natives would be diurnal, which would make my work of spying all the easier.”</p>
   <p>“Yes—to be sure. Well, we haven’t far to go. This way.” The monster lumbered in advance. Beoric wrung the water from his shoulder-length silvery-blond hair and followed.</p>
   <p>They came through the line of trees onto a paved highway. A native automobile was parked there — four-wheeled, enclosed, obviously chemical-powered. As he neared it, Beoric felt the sudden nerve-chill that meant —<emphasis>iron.</emphasis></p>
   <p>He had expected it, but that made it none the easier. Every ingrained instinct screamed at him to come no closer. Iron, iron, iron — touch it and see your hand go up in smoke! Iron, cold iron, crouched there under the moon!</p>
   <p>And he must enter that metal box, and not for an instant must he show the fear that ripped along his shrinking nerves and dinned in his brain. If they knew, if they found the fatal weakness of the Alfar, he was done. A thousand years of slow work and scheming and waiting were done — Earth was done. And it all depended on him.</p>
   <p>For a moment he couldn’t do it. In spite of his resolve, in spite of his many rehearsals, in spite of the bleak fact that he <emphasis>must go</emphasis> through with it — he couldn’t. He couldn’t deny the reflexes that knotted his muscles and locked his will and brought sweat cold and bitter out on his body.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Courage.</emphasis> The thought quivered deep in his brain. It came from the sea, from the fields beyond the road, from the trees that stood whispering in the night wind. <emphasis>Courage</emphasis>, <emphasis>Beoric. You are not alone.</emphasis></p>
   <p>They were sending him more than unspoken words. There was an actual flow of nervous energy into his body, an almost physical force suddenly entering him, bracing him, stilling the wild thunder of his heart and the panic-storm in his brain. Calmness came, and he walked boldly forward.</p>
   <p>A man stood beside the car. No — not a man, not an Earthling, though he looked like one and wore the conventional shirt, trousers, coat, and whatnot else of the planet. He was tall, as tall as Beoric, and the Alf could feel the strength that was in him, coiled in his lean body and his long skull like a great cold snake. The sheer aura of that tremendous intellect and neural force could not be hidden, it forced itself out into the telepathic bands and shouted arrogantly along the nerves of Beoric and Hraagung.</p>
   <p>The stranger had been listening to the conversation on the beach. His thought came slow and — deep — “Welcome, Beoric of Alfar. I trust your stay will be pleasant and mutually profitable. I am — my race has abandoned vocal language altogether. But on this planet I use the spoken name of Adam Kane.” He caught a question in Beoric’s thoughts, the Alf had detected overtones. “Yes, my race is so nearly like the Earthling — outwardly! — that only a little surgery enabled us to pass unquestioned. Someone must act as intermediary between aliens and natives, and so the choice falls on us. Which is very useful — in fact, it is necessary to the enterprises we maintain here.”</p>
   <p>Hraagung crawled into the rear of the car and crouched low so he could not be seen from the outside. His immense body filled the back seat, and the rank reptile smell of him filled the whole vehicle. Kane slid behind the wheel. “Come along,” he thought impatiently.</p>
   <p>Fear was cold in Beoric as he touched the right-hand door handle. It was chrome-plated, safe enough for him, but the near presence of iron shuddered in his nerves. With a convulsive movement, he opened the door and slipped in beside Kane. The car purred into motion.</p>
   <p>“Where are you from?” thought Beoric. “You still haven’t told me.”</p>
   <p>“From various stars hereabouts,” answered Kane. “I come from the most distant.” Beoric recognized Deneb in this thought. “But”—arrogantly — “we Vaettir arrived here first. Somewhat later, other races mastered the secret of faster-than-light travel and came to Sol in the course of their explorations. Hraagung is from — ”Beoric translated the thought-image, in his own private mind, as Sirius. “And so forth. Today a number of planets have vested interests in Earth. Under the leadership of the Vaettir, they have set up a system such that their various enterprises do not conflict.”</p>
   <p>He looked at Beoric. The eyes fairly blazed in his lean face, an intolerable glare which the Alf fought to meet, and his hard thought vibrated like vicious lightning in the other’s brain: “We are not hostile to newcomers who will respect the system. If they wish to open some project here or on some other of our subject planets which does not clash with established interests, they are free to do so under the rules and direction of the Vaettir. But if they violate the code, they will be destroyed.”</p>
   <p>Beoric sat quiescent, trying to think how he should react. After a while, he thought slowly: “That seems fair enough. As a matter of fact, a similar system is not unknown in my civilization. It is possible that our two cultures could have mutually profitable intercourse.”</p>
   <p>“Perhaps!” The answering vibrations lashed back, hard and suspicious.</p>
   <p>“Precisely what forms of exploitation are carried on here?” asked the Alf.</p>
   <p>“Various ones, depending on the race,” said Hraagung. “The Procyonites find Earthlings an excellent source of blood. The Altairians simply want to observe historical processes, as part of their project of mass-action study. The Arcturian economy depends on controlling the productive facilities of a great number of subject planets, skimming the cream off their industry and agriculture. We of Sirius find Earth a convenient military outpost and refueling station — also —” The thought was like a tiger licking its lips — “the natives serve other purposes.”</p>
   <p>Beoric flashed a question at Kane: “What of your race, the — Denebian Vaettir?”</p>
   <p>The answer was steel-hard, with a bleak amusement shimmering over the surface: “We have many interests in this part of the Galaxy.”</p>
   <p>The Alf leaned back and tried to relax. The almost empty land was beginning to show houses here and there, and the horizon ahead was lit with a dull glow. The car sped smoothly, swiftly over the highway, at a pace that an Earthling could hardly have controlled. It was dark inside the body, a thickness of shadows rank with the Sirian reptile stink. The reflected headlights threw a dim luminance on the harsh bony features of Adam Kane, limning them against the darkness in a nightmare tracing of cheekbones and jaw and cruel jutting nose. The nervous force of the Denebian could not be hidden, it swirled and eddied in the car like an atmosphere. Beoric had to fight its overwhelming power.</p>
   <p>“Our headquarters are in the city ahead — New York, it’s called,” thought Hraagung. “We are on Long Island now.”</p>
   <p>“Your spaceships don’t land there, though?” asked Beoric. He did not try to cover his interest, it would only be natural in a traveler from a distant star — nor could he hope to hide any emotional overtones of his thoughts from the blazing intellect of the Denebian.</p>
   <p>“Not in the city, no, though we do have one there for emergency use — in fact, our building is little more than a disguised ship. The actual bases and landing fields are elsewhere — ”</p>
   <p>No matter how he fought to suppress his emotions, Beoric could not keep a shout out of his thoughts. Ye gods — the building was a ship — <emphasis>the building was a ship!</emphasis> Why — that meant —</p>
   <p>He grew aware of the cold Sirian eyes focusing on him. The Denebian’s terrible gaze did not turn from the unwinding road, but Beoric felt his senses — and the gods knew how many uncanny perceptions he had — licking at the Alf’s hard-held mental bloc, tongues of fire that —</p>
   <p>He laughed, a little shakily, and explained: “I was startled. I had never heard of putting up such a construction without the natives knowing about it. How did you manage it?”</p>
   <p>The Denebian’s slow deep thought rolled through his brain: “It was simple. We put up the apartment building as a shell, it was only necessary to control the minds of a few city inspectors, since casual observers would not realize the difference. Then, one stormy night, we brought the ship down into the shell. Our laborers completed the disguise with a roof, interior walls and floors.”</p>
   <p>“You used native labor?”</p>
   <p>“Of course. Even at the time, none of them realized the fact that they were not putting up an ordinary structure.”</p>
   <p>“I see.” Beoric saw indeed, and in spite of knowing most of it beforehand he was utterly shaken. What sort of brains did the Vaettir have, that they could casually supply hundreds of men with false memories, prevent them even during their work from taking conscious notice of incongruities — ? What was the extent of their power?</p>
   <p><emphasis>Tonight, he thought grimly, I'll find out!</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Tonight</emphasis> — <emphasis>indeed!</emphasis> The answering thought, on the Alf band, came from behind the racing car. They must be following, in their own vehicles, and —</p>
   <p>“You must realize,” thought Kane, almost conversationally, “that the exploitation of Earth is quite old. In fact, the first Vaettir arrived here —” he thought of a length of time which Beoric rendered as about four thousand years ago. “We began to colonize extensively about seven centuries ago, at which time the native civilization was less complex and it was very easy to pass oneself off as whatever one desired. Thus our organization is firmly established. Through the corporations we control on Earth, the governments which we influence — or run outright whenever it is necessary, through the old and highly reputable family connections of some of the Vaettir, through a number of other means which you can easily imagine, we can do exactly as we please, under the very noses of the natives.” For a moment his iron features split in a grin. “The only ones who suspect that Earthlings are not their own property are labelled cranks — and generally the label is quite correct.”</p>
   <p>Beoric thought of the ruthlessness he had read in Hraagung’s mind and asked, “Why do you take so much trouble? Why not annex Earth outright?”</p>
   <p>“That would not suit the purposes of the Vaettir.” The cold answer was like a suddenly drawn sword. “It is part of our plan that the directed evolution of Earthly civilization be thought a native project — for some time to come.”</p>
   <p>Beoric nodded. He slumped back in his scat, watching the blurred buildings reel crazily past. It was plain enough who really ran this corner of the Galaxy. The Sirians, for one, would probably like nothing better than to come as conquerors, treating Earthlings frankly as cattle. But if Deneb said “no”, then “no” it was.</p>
   <p><emphasis>And — we are pitting ourselves against — that! We, who could not prevail against —</emphasis></p>
   <p>“You cannot hope to conceal your presence entirely?” he thought.</p>
   <p>“We don’t try,” shrugged Hraagung. “In earlier times, we went about almost openly, and were often seen by natives, thereby giving rise to much legendry — ”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Yes, thought Beoric, within the locked chambers of his own skull. Yes, I know the myths. Frightened glimpses of unhuman beings stalking over the world, of a science from beyond the stars, became trolls, goblins, ifrits, dragons, all the horrors of the old stories were grounded in more horrible fact. What brought on the wave of medieval devil-worship if not the growing influx from outer space? Who was the Satan they worshipped at the Black Mass if not a Denebian or a Sirian or some other monster who found a cull of fanatics useful — and who must often have laughed as he conferred with his brethren highly placed in church and state?</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>They are most of Earth's mythology. But planets have at least a few myths of their own —</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Later," went on the Sirian, “when too obvious evidence of our presence might have led more sophisticated minds to suspect the truth, we resorted to a measure of— precaution. Who knows what goes on in some lonely part of a great cattle ranch — or in his neighbor’s house in a great city? To whom does it occur that the silent partners controlling key industries may not be on Earth at all — ?</p>
   <p>“There are glimpses. Why bother to conceal them? A man who spied me on a dark night would hardly put his own reputation in jeopardy by telling of it — or, if he did, it would be the ravings of delirium, not so? On occasions where someone knows too much, his memories are removable. Almost daily, sign of us is seen — objects in the sky, poltergeist phenomena, vanishings and appearances, all the rest. But who will be able to make anything of such scattered and fragmentary evidence?" Hraagung’s deep vocal chuckle vibrated in the body of the car. “Those few who have collected any sort of coherent proof and tried to deduce the truth, are laughed at as paranoiacs."</p>
   <p>Kane’s wolf-grin flashed out. “The beauty of it is," thought the Denebian, “that almost all such people really are paranoid. It is an obvious sign of instability to attribute the world’s trouble to outside persecutors — even if such an attribution should happen to be correct!"</p>
   <p>The hurtling car was moving more slowly now as it entered frequented streets. Buildings loomed on either side, blotting out the stars, and there was iron, iron everywhere, the city was a cage of steel. For an instant of blind horror, Beoric fought not to scream. Then slowly, shakily, his resolution returned. After all, the metal wouldn’t harm him unless he touched it. And too many centuries depended on him now. And it was too late to back out.</p>
   <p><emphasis>That's right</emphasis>, <emphasis>Beoric.</emphasis> The strong reassuring thoughts beat in the back of his head. <emphasis>We're after you. We're entering the city too</emphasis> —</p>
   <p>For a moment, he savored the realization. He was, at least, a part of his people, they were with him.</p>
   <p>It came to him, not for the first time, that if the Alfar brain structure permitted them to telepath on a wave band undetectable to any other race, then doubtless the Sirians and the others — above all, the Vaettir — could also think on levels unreadable to him. And — what thoughts were flashing back and forth in the night around him?</p>
   <p>If — oh, gods, if the incredible Vaettir really could listen in on his thoughts, if that was the secret of their power, if Kane was simply leading the Alfar into a trap — But the chance had to be taken. Earth itself was a trap.</p>
   <p>He sat in silence. The car wound smoothly through darkened streets where only the dull-yellow lamps and an occasional furtive movement in the shadows and alleys had life. It was near the ebb time of the great city’s life; it slept like a sated beast under the sinking moon.</p>
   <p>The fields and woods, hills and waters and sky, never slept. There was always life, a rustic of wings, a pattering of feet, a gleam of eyes out of the night, there was always the flowing tide of nervous energy, wakeful, alert. Life like a sea beyond the city, and Beoric had never been really alone.</p>
   <p>Until now. But the city slept, and there was nothing wild to run in the fields and leap in the moonlit waters. Beoric’s straining mind sensed a few rodents scuttcring in the ground, a slinking cat or two, the threadlike nervous impulses of insects fluttering around the one-eyed street lamps. Now and again there would be a human thought, someone wakeful —and the thought seemed to echo in the vast hollow silence of the city, it was alone, alone.</p>
   <p>The city slept. Beoric could sense the life force of the sleeping humans, nervous, jagged-feeling, even now. It was like an overwhelming lethargy, a million and a million and a million sleeping bodies with ail their pain and sorrow and longing turned loose to wander in their minds. The Alf locked his brain to the sticky tide, but it rolled around him, it lay like a sweat-dampened cloak over his nervous system.</p>
   <p><emphasis>They are too many. The sheer magnitude of life force of— how many millions? Ten? — is more than we can endure. And yet we dare challenge the rulers of this world.</emphasis></p>
   <p>They were in the outer edges of the decadent zone surrounding the main business district. It was the logical location for the headquarters — not so evilly situated as to be suspect to police, but in a relatively idle area which would be empty of traffic at night. And now — yes, the quiver of life-force up ahead, impulses of a wave-form not quite Earthly, it came from <emphasis>that</emphasis> building.</p>
   <p>Beoric looked at the darkened bulk before which the automobile came to a halt. It was a ten-story apartment building, as drab and dingy as any of its neighbors. A dim light glowed in the door, picking out a sign: NO VACANCY. <emphasis>Of course not.</emphasis> thought Beoric, and suppressed an impulse to hysterical laughter.</p>
   <p>“No one watching,” flashed Kane’s thought. “We can go right in.”</p>
   <p>Hraagung’s unwieldy bulk crossed the sidewalk with surprising speed. The three entered into a hall like that of any other building of this type. Beoric’s sensitive nostrils wrinkled at the odors of dirt and stale cookery, but he had to admit the disguise was complete.</p>
   <p>Even to an elderly human who sat half dozing at the desk. Beoric dipped into his mind for an instant and withdrew with a shudder from the — hollowness.</p>
   <p>But the haughty Vaettir would not trouble to pose as menials. They would need a few authentic natives, to act as janitors and whatever other fronts were necessary. Natives who could pass for normal individuals, but whom their vampire masters had sucked dry of all personality. Flesh-and-blood robots — Kane led the way into an elevator. “This runs directly into the spaceship,” he explained. “You will find more suitable accommodations there.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Such as a coffin, maybe? Or more probably a dissecting table. They'll want to know what I really am.</emphasis></p>
   <p>They emerged into a short corridor lit by coldly gleaming fluorotubes. Kane gestured at a door, which opened to reveal a small, richly furnished room.</p>
   <p>“This is one of the guest quarters we keep for transient visitors to Earth,” thought the Denebian. “I hope you will find it suitable. The furniture adjusts itself to the shape of the user’s body, and you can set temperature, humidity, air pressure, and the rest to whatever is most comfortable for you.”</p>
   <p>The thought of being set in an airtight chamber was not at all to Beoric’s liking. “I am not tired, now, thanks,” he vibrated. “I would be more interested in seeing the other colonists.”</p>
   <p>“This is only headquarters, as I told you,” answered Kane. “But most members of the grand control council for Sol are already here, and I have summoned the rest mentally. They should arrive soon.”</p>
   <p>“All the councillors? That is an honor.”</p>
   <p>Kane skinned his teeth <sup>:</sup>n a humorless smile. “Not too much of an honor for a visitor from so far away,” his thought almost purred. And then, a naked rapier flash: “After all, we have to decide what to do about you!”</p>
   <p>Beoric knew, suddenly and bleakly, that he was not intended to leave the ship still in possession of his own personality. It should not take more than two or three of the Vaettir brains to smash through his mental defenses and get complete control of him. And when they knew all he knew about the Alfar, he he would go as their depersonalized agent to his ship.</p>
   <p>The Alfs fingers touched the sheathed knife strapped under his tunic. He should be able to hold off such an assault long enough to whip out the weapon, and its iron blade would burn through his heart. The Vaettir no doubt had techniques for reviving the dead, but they wouldn’t work on him — in minutes his brain and its knowledge would be crumbled, in hours his rapidly proteolyzed flesh would be dust, even his bones would not last many years. The metabolism which was at once their strength and weakness had at least been the cloak of the Alfar.</p>
   <p>He was no longer afraid of death. He more than half expected it. But he could not control the inward shudder that racked him at the thought that the Vaettir might somehow be able to upset the plan. There was <emphasis>so</emphasis> little that the Alfar knew about them — so horribly little.</p>
   <p>Kane started down the hall. Beoric followed, uneasily aware of Hraagung coming ponderously after. He was between the two monsters, no chance of escape. It lay with the others now, and he didn’t dare call on them.</p>
   <p>They entered a cubicle which shot into sudden motion. Beoric judged that it was carrying them toward the center of the ship. He flashed out an impulse on the Alf band, to guide the others, but there was no answer.</p>
   <p>The ship was silent. He could hear nothing but the purr of the moving cube, the breathing of Hraagung crouched hard and cold beside him. He could feel the surge of inhuman nerve flows, swirling through his own telepathic receptive center like a dark tide, and he could feel the iron frame of the ship, its faint residual magnetism seemed to chill his nerves. Thank all the gods, the metal floor and wall and ceilings were nonferrous. But he was in a cage of iron, a spider web, and the breath choked in his throat.</p>
   <p>The cube stopped, its door opening on a little antechamber. As the three passengers stepped out, another creature flashed into sight on a metal plate and stalked toward the room beyond.</p>
   <p>Beoric started. “What the devil — !” Then, catching himself with the native quick-mindness of his race: “I take it you’ve somehow managed to apply the interstellar drive principle to short distances. But how? Our civilization was never able to use it for other than hops of a light-year or more.”</p>
   <p>“The true minimum distance is about a hundred miles,” answered Kane. “Thus we can summon the whole Solar control council in almost no time. Even the officers from the other planets should be present tonight.”</p>
   <p>“The planets! But — but gods, that’s millions of miles off! How can your thought reach — ?”</p>
   <p>Kane’s intolerably brilliant eyes rested speculatively on the Alf. “The Vaettir have mastered certain principles of telepathy unattainable by lesser races,” he thought haughtily.</p>
   <p><emphasis>And— how much else have they mastered? It’s no wonder they rule their civilization.</emphasis></p>
   <p>They entered the council chamber. It was long and high, and the icy white light shimmering on the metal walls made them seem peculiarly unreal, as if the room were of infinite extent. There was a table near the center, around which, on adjustable couches, sat and lay and squatted the rulers of Earth.</p>
   <p>Beoric’s eyes swept over them, and the shrinking, ingrained fear of all his people’s fugitive generations screamed along his nerves and shouted in his brain. He stood still, fighting for calm, and met their gaze with his own blind blue stare. He knew their races already, though he let Hraagung point out which each of them belonged to.</p>
   <p>There were two each from Sirius, Procyon, Arcturus, and Altair, and five Denebians. Here, if nowhere else, the utter dominance of the Vaettir was open and arrogant. They sat at the head of the table, wrapped in their own pride, and Beoric could not meet the flame of their eyes.</p>
   <p>He looked over the others. Besides the Denebians, only the Sirians seemed really formidable. The Procyonites were wizened little insectile horrors that sucked blood from Earthlings asleep and fed on radiated nervous energy of the wakeful, a completely parasitic species which, though it lowered the energy and intelligence of its victims, did less harm than the vampire legends tracing to its activities suggested. The Arcturians were cunning, ruthless — their muzzled feces even looked vulpine — and highly intelligent, but physically comparatively small and weak. The placid Altairians, coiled in their tentacles and watching the scene with calm cool eyes, were here only as scientific observers. They had no sympathy for the natives, and cooperated willingly enough in the control of Earth, but they did no direct harm.</p>
   <p>He had to reckon with all of them, thought Beoric tautly. But it was the raw imperialism of Sirius and the absolute mastery of Deneb which were the real shadows over Earth.</p>
   <p>Over — the Galaxy? Who knew? Just how far did the shadow empire reach? He grew aware that Kane and Hraagung had taken their places. The council table was full now. And there was no place for him, he had to stand in front of them. They were hardly bothering not to slap him in the face with the knowledge that he was a prisoner.</p>
   <p>“By now all of you know the stranger’s story,” flashed Kane’s thought. “The question before us is what action to take.”</p>
   <p>The slow, almost drowsy, and keenly penetrating thought of an Altairian came: “I would suggest that first we settle whether or not the story is true.”</p>
   <p>“Of course,” answered Kane. Sardonically: “But it would be most discourteous to our guest not to accept it for the time being, at least.”</p>
   <p>“To be sure.” The Altairian’s gray gaze swung to Beoric. “Suppose we simply trade a few questions and answers, to clear up mutual ignorance.”</p>
   <p>“Gladly,” bowed the Alf. Suddenly, he felt almost at home. This was like the court intrigue of the old days, the swift fencing with words, the subtle mockery — if he couldn’t at least hold his own, he didn’t deserve to.</p>
   <p>“I can understand a certain natural suspicion on your part,” he began. “But it does seem a little extreme for a great civilization to be so concerned about one ship.”</p>
   <p>“A ship from a culture of we know not what strength, a ship with at least one magnificent weapon, the vibration screen, of which we know nothing,” flashed Hraagung bluntly. “What word will you carry back to your home sun?”</p>
   <p>“Friendly word, I assure you. What use would it be to conquer on the other side of the Galaxy? What use would Earth be to us, who need armor to venture out on its daylight?”</p>
   <p>“There are plenty <emphasis>of</emphasis> nocturnal races who never see their own sun if they can avoid it,” grunted Hraagung. “You would find Earth’s night perfectly comfortable. However, I assume that you would be after higher stakes than one insignificant planet.”</p>
   <p>“The trouble with you Sirians,” thought an Arcturian sarcastically, “is that you cannot imagine any mentality different from your own. You, who simply conquer planets to loot them, still cannot comprehend the attitude of, say, my race, which deliberately builds up Earth in order to gain thereby. You — why, you are on Earth, you have a military base here, simply because you fear that otherwise we’ll put one up to use against Sirius.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, I suppose they like an occasional snack, too,” jeered a Proevonite. “They like to arrange a disappearance of a native — into their own bellies. They’re good butchers— but they never heard of milking.”</p>
   <p>The Sirians stirred dangerously, and Beoric felt the tide of anger that rose in the room. They hated each other, these rival races. If it weren’t for the steel grip of the Vaettir, they’d be at each other’s throats in a minute.</p>
   <p>A Denebian thought cut through the emotional fog. “That will do.” It was a chill peremptory command, and Beoric could feel the sudden throttling of rage within the others. “We have more important business than simply squabbling. This arrival constitutes a major crisis.”</p>
   <p>“I tell you,” thought Beoric, “we are only peaceful explorers. If you wish to be isolated, the Alfar will be to glad to give your territory a wide berth.”</p>
   <p>“That is not the point,” vibrated Kane. “The very existence of another, comparable civilization is a danger to our plans. To be perfectly frank, the Vaettir intend to expand their activities. Even if the Alfar remained neutral, their suns would constitute foci of resistance for such races as already have the vibratory engine but have not yet had contact with other equal cultures. The history of the Galaxy has been planned carefully in advance, with many developments set to take place of themselves without the supervision of the comparatively small number of Vaettir. We thought we knew all races which had interstellar spaceships. Now the Alfar appear, a totally unforeseen factor. Even with the friendliest intentions, you will upset our calculations.</p>
   <p>“Thus—” the terrible eyes blazed at the Alf—“you see why this emergency council is necessary. So great, indeed, is the emergency that all the Vaettir in the Solar System are here tonight to settle your case.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>All of them! For a moment, utter exultation flamed in Beoric. All of them? Every last damned one! That was as much as we dared hope for.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>And then, in a sudden sickening backwash of dismay: But—if they really only need five to run the Solar System — how colossal are not their powers? What may these five not be able to do tonight?</emphasis></p>
   <p>He grew aware of the eyes on him, of the thoughts and senses probing at him, studying and analyzing and drawing unguessablc conclusions. He laughed, shakily, and thought: “This is quite a surprise. And, naturally, somewhat alarming to me.”</p>
   <p>“You need not fear conquest,” thought Kane almost contemptuously. “The Vaettir permit only certain planets to be taken over outright. The rest, according to our plans, are controlled in more subtle ways. Such as Earth, for instance.”</p>
   <p>Beoric licked his lips. They seemed suddenly dry. “How — many — stars — to date?”</p>
   <p>There was a moment of hesitation, then: “No reason why you should not know,” answered an Altairian. “The civilization — which is to say, the Denebian dominance — covers about five hundred stars so far, and is becoming increasingly influential on a thousand or more other systems. Eventually, of course — ” He shrugged, a sinuous movement of boneless arms.</p>
   <p>“You can’t — expect me — to like the idea.”</p>
   <p>“Not at first,” The Arcturian’s thought was ingratiating. “But actually such civilization can be very beneficial to the subjects.”</p>
   <p>“How — ”</p>
   <p>“Why, take our own activities here on Earth, for instance. The meager natural resources of the Arcturian System have long been almost exhausted, yet our race lives well by building up industry on backward planets like Earth and taking a certain part of the produce. About two hundred years ago we started an industrial revolution here and made its progress as rapid as the Denebians permitted. <emphasis>We</emphasis> controlled the booming industry, through the various fronts of the organization, and as much of what was produced as we needed went to Arcturus. We led native researchers to take the lines leading to success — and they thought they were responsible for it. Workers in say, aircraft factories still don’t know that a number of the parts they make go into Arcturian aircars and ships; all who are in a position to know are misled by carefully arranged records, or simply come under sufficient mental control to be incapable of noticing the discrepancies. Oil, iron, alloys, grain, machine parts — some of it all goes to Arcturus. Not much from any one planet — but there arc many planets.”</p>
   <p>“But — governments — ”</p>
   <p>“Governments!” The foxy face grinned. <emphasis>“We</emphasis> are the governments, or as much of them as necessary. Why, a number of backward nations have been forcibly industrialized by revolutionary governments which we arranged in the first place. If you knew how many dictators and commissioners and industrialists and whatnot else are depersonalized natives with a direct mental link to some extraterrestrial, you would appreciate how completely Earth is in thrall. And — when we are done with them, when some new development is commanded — they go. They are defeated in war, or die, or — fade out of the picture one way or another.</p>
   <p>“And yet —” The thought was swift, persuasive — “yet think how Earth has benefited from it. The population has been approximately doubling every century. The standard of living has gone steadily up. The latent resources of the planet are being put to work. Earthlings are pawns, yes— but very well treated pawns."</p>
   <p><emphasis>I wonder. What about the endless, senseless wars that rack them, what about the pollution of the fair green fields with smoke and waste, what about poverty and misery and the loss of all control over their own destiny? What about the time when the purposes of the Vaettir call for the lash? Call for the — discarding — of the human race? But I’m not supposed to know that.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“There is no need to employ euphemisms," came the icy thought of Kane. “Earthlings receive whatever sort of treatment the particular situation calls for. If an individual native comes to prominence and carries out policies contrary to our desires, he dies. There were presidents of this country, for instance, who would have changed the planned course of events. They died — the bullet of a controlled assassin, the hemorrhage of a focused supersonic beam, whatever means was most convenient. The Vaettir will not tolerate interference with their purposes."</p>
   <p>“Yes — and what are those aims?" Beoric swung to the five grim-faced monsters at the head of the table. His thoughts were tinged with a fear that was not all feigned. “I take it that as the oldest and most powerful mentally of the local races you have established control over them, so that even your supposed equals jump to your bidding. But — why? What do you want? Where is this great plan of yours leading?"</p>
   <p>“That is not for you or anyone else to question," came the bleak reply. “You would not understand the truth anyway. If you said that the Vaettir aimed to rule the attainable universe, it would be an imputation of your own childish motivations to us, for that aim is only a means to an end. If you said that the Vaettir intelligence can draw on the directed minds of whole planets, increasing its own potential correspondingly, and that for this reason it is necessary to direct the history of those planets toward the most useful, easily regimented type of thinking, you would be closer to the truth. Perhaps — " for a base instant, the lightning-like thought sagged under a burden of vast and intolerable weariness, the despair of the ultimately evolved being who has nothing left to achieve — “perhaps, if you said that there is really nothing else to do, except die, you would almost realize the truth. Almost."</p>
   <p><emphasis>Where are they? Where are the others? Gods, why don't they come?</emphasis></p>
   <p>Beoric thought slowly and bitterly: “So that is why there must be war and misery and evolution of slave states. That is why men — why natives of all the planets you rule must be fettered by old mistakes which even they can see are wrong, You say there are still separate nations on this world. But a race capable of understanding the technology I have glimpsed must surely be intelligent enough to realize that only a unified planetary government can end the horrors of their destinies. Yet — they don’t have it. Because it wouldn’t suit the purposes of the Vaettir.”</p>
   <p>“They will have it, eventually,” answered Kane. “But it will be the sort of state <emphasis>we</emphasis> want. And stop wasting sympathy on the natives. Do you feel sorry for your own domestic animals?”</p>
   <p>Suddenly his thought rang out, chill and deadly, overwhelming in its sheer volume of savage energy: “This farce has gone far enough. I think you have trapped yourself sufficiently, and we can begin finding out who you really are.”</p>
   <p>“Eh — <emphasis>huh?"</emphasis> The surprise flashed around the council table. Only the five great Vaettir were in possession of themselves — <emphasis>they</emphasis> had known what was coming.</p>
   <p>“Of course.” Kane’s thought roared and boomed in their skulls. The Alf sagged under that rush of devastating cold fury. “Surely you were not taken in by his story — Yes, you were. And it was not without a certain ingenuity.</p>
   <p>“But how could an obviously inferior race find a way of screening off star-drive vibrations when the Vaettir had vainly sought such a means for millennia? Why was the stranger, who claimed to come from a civilization not unused to this sort of arrangement, so interested in the details of how Earth is run — and so shocked by them? Yet — shocked in the wrong way, at the wrong times. From the moment I met him, I was studying his emotional reactions. They fitted no reasonable pattern if his story were true. He was too interested in some details, too indifferent <emphasis>to</emphasis> others. Only a Denebian might have noticed the anomalies, for he covered up very well, but they were there.</p>
   <p>“There is only one answer.” The terrible vibrations filled the room in a sudden soundless thunder. “<emphasis>There is no interstellar spaceship. There is no planet Alfar. He came from within the Solar System</emphasis>/”</p>
   <p>For an instant there was a silence in which Beoric’s sudden horror spurted numbingly along his spine. Lost, lost, the Vaettir had known after all —</p>
   <p><emphasis>No. They still don't know. The thought was like a strong arm suddenly laid about his sagging body. But we expected that they might deduce this much. And we’re just outside the building now.</emphasis></p>
   <p>For an instant Beoric saw through the eyes of the communicating Alf. A dozen automobiles were parking all around the block. That they were constructed entirely of nonferrous alloys was not evident to the vision, and the beings who tumbled out of them wore conventional native clothes, could pass for human in the vague light. But — they had weapons.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Hold them off, Beoric. Hold their attention for the few minutes it will take us to get to the council chamber and cut off their escape — or their access to their defenses. Keep them from noticing our radiations as we approach.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The hurried message ended. And now the minds of the council were crashing against Beoric’s brain, drowning his own thoughts in a roar of invading energy. His consciousness reeled toward an abysmal darkness — no, he had to keep them occupied, had to.</p>
   <p>“Wait!” he gasped vocally. “Wait — I’ll tell you — ”</p>
   <p>Kane’s mind was like a steel band around his. “Start telling, then. But you won’t save your miserable personality if you let slip even one falsehood.”</p>
   <p>“We — we’re from — Earth itself—” <emphasis>Gods</emphasis>, <emphasis>am I telling? There's no help for it</emphasis> — <emphasis>But if even one councillor manages to get word of this to Deneb</emphasis> —</p>
   <p>“You aren’t Earthlings!”</p>
   <p>“No, we — yes, we are. But not — human Earthlings.”</p>
   <p>“How could you evolve on a planet to which you are so ill adapted?”</p>
   <p>“We aren’t. We are extremely well adapted to Earth’s night. We haven’t yet deduced just how our type of life got started. Obviously it has a common origin with the ordinary sort, but it must lie far back, perhaps in the Archeozoic. Somehow forms of life evolved which could not stand actinic light but which could thrive in darkness, seeing by infra-red waves — In spite of their great differences, which are metabolic rather than chemical, the two types of flesh are mutually digestible, so the nocturnal sort did not lack for food — There was quite a variety of such life forms once, and eventually they even evolved a manlike species — us!”</p>
   <p>“Nonsense!” Beoric gasped with the pain of the Vaettir assault on his brain. “There are no geological or paleontological indications that such forms ever existed.”</p>
   <p>“Of course not.” The Alf’s thoughts flowed frantically. Would they never come? Where were they? What was keeping them? “I said that the nocturnal life’s metabolism is peculiar. The natural balance, involving high rates of both anabolism and catabolism, makes very long life spans possible. I am five hundred years old, and still young. But it means that the body decays very quickly on death. Even the bones are soon oxidized, being organic. No fossil traces would remain at all. Perhaps a few have been preserved by freak accidents, though I doubt it, but they would be very few and human paleontologists simply haven’t chanced <emphasis>to</emphasis> find them. And, of course, there was never any possibility of interbreeding with the dominant forms.”</p>
   <p>“Dominant? But why should the nocturnals have become —”</p>
   <p>“Extinct? Yes, they nearly are. They couldn’t really compete with the other type, which could endure both day and night, and which reproduced much faster. The Alfar have few children in their long lives. Our numbers have been on the wane for centuries, and almost all other animals of our sort are extinct.”</p>
   <p>“That still doesn’t account —”</p>
   <p>“We have other weaknesses, too." <emphasis>There's no harm in telling now</emphasis>. <emphasis>If the others don't come soon</emphasis>, <emphasis>it's all over anyhow.</emphasis> “Certain metals, silver and iron, are fatal to us. They catalyze rapid proteolysis and oxidation of our tissues.” Beoric saw Kane’s eyes widen the tiniest fraction, and knew what icy calculations must be going on in that long skull. He went on, drearily: “Even in neolithic times, humans had the edge on us, and once they had learned metallurgy our doom was scaled. They drove us out of all lands they inhabited and, for religious and superstitious reasons, destroyed most of our cities and other works. The invention of firearms, which we could not duplicate, was simply the last blow. We gave up the fight and retreated into wastelands and into the night, living in hidden dwellings and having little contact with humans. Once in a while, there might be a brief encounter, but the last of these was three hundred years ago, and since then we have lived so remotely that men no longer believe we ever existed.”</p>
   <p>“And yet —” Kane paused. “It is not illogical. If a human, say, were to be told that there are several nonhuman races sharing the planet with him, he would hardly balk at one more. Even if such an extra race were — native!” For a moment he sat quiescent, then: “What is that?”</p>
   <p>His thought lashed like a fist at Beoric, and the other Vaettir hurled their rage with him. The Alf fell to the floor, screaming with the pain of it.</p>
   <p>“Strangers — I feel their vibrations — <emphasis>Strangers in the ship!"</emphasis> Kane made one tigerish bound toward the door, toward escape — or the atomic guns of the vessel.</p>
   <p>An arrow whined, and through blurring eyes Beoric saw the Denebian pitch forward with the feathered shaft through his breast. He saw his fellows, the warriors of the Alfar, coming through the door, and they had cast off their human coats and hats, they wore the golden-shining beryllium-copper helmets and byrnies of the old days, and they carried the old weapons. longbow, spear, sword, ax, and a shrieking fury that clamored between the metal walls, the blood-howl for vengeance.</p>
   <p>The air was thick with the sighing arrows. All were aimed at the Denebians, who fell before their terrible mental force, that might yet have annihilated the invaders, could utter more than a snarl. And now the warriors were on the councillors, ax and sword rising and falling and rising bloodily again.</p>
   <p>“Save one!" cried the king. “Save an Altairian!"</p>
   <p>Beoric sat dizzily up. Strength was flowing back into him, strength and a gasping incredulous realization that he was still alive. That — they had won. The Vaettir were dead.</p>
   <p>“How are you, Beoric?" The anxious voice was close to his ear.</p>
   <p>“I’m all right.” The Alf climbed unsteadily to his feet. “How — is it?”</p>
   <p>“All well. I can’t detect anybody else on the ship. It’s ours,” said the king. He turned to the surviving Altairian, who lay coiled in his tentacles under the spears of the warriors and watched them with calm eyes. “Your people were always the most decent,” thought the king, “and I think you will be the most cooperative. We want you to show us how to run this ship. If you do, we’ll release you on some planet from which you can find your way home.”</p>
   <p>“Agreed,” answered the octopoid. “Would you mind explaining exactly who you are and what is your purpose and how you accomplished all this?”</p>
   <p>“We are the nocturnal equivalent of Earth humankind,” answered Beoric. “We were almost powerless, but being telepathic we did know of the interstellar exploitation which was going on. It menaced us just as much as it did our old human enemies — but it also offered us an opportunity.</p>
   <p>“In time, we learned how to make nonferrous alloys which would substitute for iron and steel. And by telepathic ‘spying’ on the invaders, over a period of centuries, we picked up enough hints to be able to generate gravity beams and, eventually, to build a small spaceboat.</p>
   <p>“We knew we could never enter the Denebian stronghold if they realized our true nature. The remnants of our race would simply be hunted down. But if we could send an agent — myself— to pose as a visitor from some great, formidable civilization beyond their own, they would treat him with respect — for a while, anyway. He could get into one of their ships. And his fellows, whom the aliens would not expect to be on Earth with him, could use the diversion he created to come in after him and take possession of the ship.”</p>
   <p>“And so you have it,” murmured the Altairian’s thought. “And you have wiped out all the Vaettir in the Solar System, completely disorganizing their rule here till they can send someone else. Well done! But — what now?”</p>
   <p>“First,” said the king, “the whole race of the Alfar is leaving the Solar System. This ship should be big enough to carry them all. There are so few of us left — But when we find a planet which suits us, an uninhabited world we can hold without fear, hidden from the Vaettir by the vastness of the Galaxy, we can begin to make our comeback. After that — a warned, roused union of free stars, equipped with ships such as this, can do something about the Vaettir.” His thought was grim. “And I know what something will be.”</p>
   <p>“It’s strange,” mused Beoric. “The aliens knew that they had caused most of the demon-myths of Earth. It did not occur to them that the myths of Faerie might also have an origin in reality. That I might be — an elf! That peris and nixies and kobolds and brownies and fairies and the Sea People and all the rest might, in a way, really exist. ... And so man’s old enemy, the shifty unreliable folk of the night, becomes in the end his saviour. And Alfheim changes from myth to — a real planet.”</p>
   <p>“Aye. And — well done, Beoric,” said King Oberon.</p>
