   <p>“He’s crazy,” they warned her at Okuma Base. “Buried his wife ten years ago and been a hermit since.” They meant Earth years, of course. Under the guise of practicality, did they cling to each possible reminder of the world that few among them would see again, or ever? “Ask any of the pilots who’ve flown there. Don’t go there alone.” You, a woman, they implied.</p>
   <p>“I’m supposed to find out whether support for his re­search should be continued,” Rita Byrne reminded them. “That involves staying a while. You can’t spare two people that long. Also, Ell do better without a third party cluttering the scene.”</p>
   <p>As shorthanded as the scientific enterprise was, and the damned mystics claiming more and more of its scanty resources, nobody argued much with her. Besides, Malchiel Holden was, at the very least, eccentric and irascible; but he’d scarcely get violent, would he? Nonetheless, Byrne felt glad that a flyer’s outfit included a pistol, against the oc­casional carnivore that didn’t know it couldn’t digest hu­man flesh. The caliber was only .22, but the slugs were explosive.</p>
   <p>Wishing to reach Farland fairly early in the morning, she took off about midnight. The mountain bleakness, little relieved by scrub growth and huddled buildings, turned into grandeur as she rose above it, crags, peaks, gorges dappled white by snowfields and glaciers. Nearly full, like a huge tawny moon mysteriously emblazoned, Chujo turned the cloud deck over the lowlands into a sea of milk washed with pale gold.</p>
   <p>After she leveled off, however, it was just to purr along on robot for almost thirty hours, nearly halfway around the globe. She ate a meal and sought her bunk. Always grab a chance to rest. Born and raised on Genji. she handled herself readily enough, but her kind had evolved to weigh two-thirds what it did here.</p>
   <p>Murasaki rose, broad and fulvous. Chujo, already wan­ing, seemed abruptly dim against the sunlight. The com­panion planet fell beneath the horizon. Still the aircraft flew, under a plum-dusky day sky, over the ocean that cov­ered starside. When the hemisphere’s single continent ap­peared, multitudinously yellow, through rifts in the overcast, Byrne had been through a full circadian cycle. She had occupied her waking hours by accessing data on her goal for review, together with background music, and felt entirely. fresh.</p>
   <p>Taking the pilot’s seat, she switched to manual control and slanted downward. Once below the clouds, she com­pared the map display with what she saw. Gray, green, purple, foam-streaked, the waters marched from the west to break in monstrous cascades and geysers on land that here­abouts reared granite cliffs against it Flying on throttled engines, she caught a murmur that was the roar of yonder surf. A canyon, cleaving the shore, made a fjord, protected by outlying skerries. Magnifying in a viewscreen, she spied houses on the heights and vessels tied at a floating dock. Yes, that would be the Gash. Given all the uncertainties still plaguing navigation, her robot had done well. Then Rockridge lay about ninety kilometers south. She swung in its direction.</p>
   <p>Most names on the map had been bestowed by Hol­den over the years—some, Byrne supposed, by his wife before she died. Who better, indeed who else at all, when a handful of people were trying to know an entire world? Certain names were obvious attempts at rendering Ihrdi­zuan ones; others were probably translations into the man’s native English; others might be personal creations, bearing what freight of memories? Suddenly, more sharply than before, Byrne realized how ignorant she was, even of this small and detached undertaking that she was to pass judgment on.</p>
   <p>Ringed by sheer hills, Gunnunggung Bay glimmered sixty kilometers from north to south, forty from west to east. Islands dotted it. There were more in the sea outside, and countless rocks and reefs. White fury churned among them. That, and the narrow strait that was its opening, kept the bay reasonably calm, at least in fair weather. Turbu­lence did roil about its holms, and at the north end where a great brown river emptied. The tide appeared to be just past high, ebbing rapidly. Rock and mud, down which wa­ter foamed, made a rim of darkness under the xanthous vegetation that covered the upper slopes. Wildlife was abundant, wings storming in their thousands above swim­mers that grazed mats of pelagic weed.</p>
   <p>Rockridge Thorp clustered atop the highest hillcrest at the eastern shore. A windbreak of squat trees surrounded a dozen beehive-shaped homes and as many hemicylindrical utility structures. Building materials were stone, brick, tile. Perhaps no fire-resistant wood grew in this part of oxygen-rich Genji; Byrne recognized yet another gap in her infor­mation. The human dwelling was unmistakable, a boxy metal T-shape equipped with air locks and glass ports. Steam vented from the power plant in one crossarm. It stood about a hundred meters outside the settlement. A tar­and-gravel spot nearby must be the landing place.</p>
   <p>As she descended, Byrne glanced west. The coastal range fell away in rolling valleys. She glimpsed roads that connected other communities, plowland, pasture, lakes and marshes devoted to the more important aquaculture, mills and smithies gathered smoky near a rninehead. How many centuries since the first Ihrdizuan explorers discovered Far-land, the first colonists followed? They were still rather isolated and primitive here.</p>
   <p>She came down vertically. The engines hummed to a silence through which beat the noises of the water, a kilo­meter or more distant but carried loud. She unharnessed, fetched her mask, donned it and snugged it tight. This was the newest model. A headband formed the casing of the little motor and contained both pressure-reduction intake and forced-draft exhaler. A retractable rocker arm enabled her to run the unit by hand, should its battery give out and no replacement be available. Air at three bars is inadvisable for humans to breathe. Molecular adhesion along the edges held a self-cleaning blinkie visor and the stiff fabric beneath to her skin, while allowing enough play to leave her mouth free. There she could insert a stopcocked drinking tube or push solid food through a slit whose cling prevented any significant amount of gas from entering.</p>
   <p>Ihrdizu scuttled from the thorp toward the jetplane. Their big, torpedo-shaped, sleekly blue-gray bodies lent a touch of familiarity to the foreignness encompassing her. The four eye sockets around each mouth were telescoped outward and the snorkel trunks pointed straight ahead, as if reaching for maximum sensory input. Both three-digited tentacles waved to and fro. Tail flukes flapped. Excitement, oh, <emphasis>yes.</emphasis></p>
   <p>A servomotor opened the door for her. Outside air gushed in. Her ears twinged for a moment before adapting to the higher volume of sounds. Heat and damp enveloped her, They weren’t too bad, here beside the ocean, and she was used to odors that newcomers found rank. In fact, a clean tang blew off the bay.</p>
   <p>She climbed out. The Ihrdizu arrived. They stopped a short way off and stared. A female waddled forward, to sit upright on hind legs and tail while offering a forepaw. “Welcome.” She coughed. Byrne could barely understand the dialect. “1 am (harsh noise). But to him I am—” Did she really say “Wilhelmina”? She added,—You call us what you want. How can we help?”</p>
   <p>Touched, Byrne shook hands. Clumsy though it felt to her, the paw had enough dexterity to work effectively in conjunction with the tentacles. am Rita,” she replied. They could come closer to voicing that than her surname. She wondered if they perceived any individuality in her. Already she saw their differences from each other, but she had known many Ihrdizu. These were familiar with no human but Holden. The supply pilots came seldom and briefly. Did the Rockridgers identify her as a slender young woman, with black hair and blue eyes, or were all her kind alike to them, except the one?</p>
   <p>She forced forth the best, crude approximation of Gen­jian sounds she could make. “Where is the male who lives here?”</p>
   <p>Wilhelmina followed her better than she had antici­pated. “You are female? Do you seek a mate? That would be good. His is long dead.” A tentacle pointed. Byrne saw a crudely chiseled slab behind the house, doubtless the wife’s headstone. “He has gone to his (whistling noise; must mean “himatids”) as he always does, most days more than once and often at night. You wait.”</p>
   <p>Byrne needed a while to work out what that had meant. Then she couldn’t help laughing. “Is it a match­maker you’d be?” she asked in English. Wilhelmina and the rest stiffened a bit. Maybe they thought she made fun of them. Byrne hastened to stumble on in their language. “No. I do have business with him, I will stay a while, but then I go back.”</p>
   <p>Mate... She’d avoided any real ties so far. For a mo­ment she wished Carlos Villareal were at her side.</p>
   <p>Somebody in the group hooted. “Och-h’ng, he comes,” Wilhelmina exclaimed. “He must have seen your boat and turned back.” It seemed the locals referred to Holden exclusively by the pronoun. In northeastern Nigh-land that was a mark of respect,tut farther south it implied coolness, emotional distance. Which, if either, was it here?</p>
   <p>Holden had evidently been on a trail downhill to the water. The strides were long and quick that bore him up to the ridge. They wasted energy; but they gave outlet to an­ger, Byrne thought. She braced muscles and spirit. If he tried to browbeat her, he’d make a bad mistake.</p>
   <p>When he reached her, he loomed. Shabby coverall and worn deck shoes covered a rawboned height. His pressure container was outmoded, a transparent globe on a collar gasketed to chest, shoulders, upper back. Fitted with wipers, defogger, and sound amplifiers, it had provision for a water tube but none for eating. On the other hand, a long snorkel, now coiled around the rear-mounted pump, allowed him to stay submerged. Gray hair and beard bristled on the head within. The nose was bladelike, eyes bullet-colored, skin furrowed, leathery, but even more mushroom-white than that of most Nordics, Celts, and Slays on Genji.</p>
   <p>Byrne reached out her hand. “How do you do, Dr. Holden,” she said. “I am—”</p>
   <p>He ignored the gesture and snapped her greeting across. “I know. They phoned me you’d arrive this eve­ning. Why didn’t you? I’m not ready.”</p>
   <p>Byrne told herself that she shouldn’t let him anger her. “I’m ,sorry. It happened I completed another mission un­expectedly early. Rather than stay idle forty or fifty hours, I thought you, too, would like me to begin here at once.” She couldn’t refrain from adding, “My services are much in demand, you know. We’ve a great deal to do on moon-side, and not many people to do it.”</p>
   <p>“Well, the result is, you’ll cool your heels till sun­down or later. I’m not about to stop and talk. The research opportunity today comes once in ten or fifteen years.” Doubtless he meant swings of the planets around Murasaki: in other words, about two or<sup>-</sup>three Terrestrial. “All right, get yourself settled in the house. The croakers will unload and store the supplies. You did bring what I ordered, didn’t you?”</p>
   <p>“Yes.” She was sorely tempted to point out that fur­ther shipments might well depend on his conduct toward her. But no. If he’d forgotten what common courtesy was, that ought to be his problem alone. “What are your im­mediate plans... may I ask?”</p>
   <p>“To observe, inquire, and not stand here chattering any longer.” Holden glanced at the Ihrdizu. “Karl, Otto, Friedrich, see to my goods.” He barked it in English. “This person will take care of her things.”</p>
   <p>Impulse burst up and congealed into decision. “One moment,” Byrne said “Why don’t I come with you?”</p>
   <p>Surprise became scorn. “You’re not prepared, that’s why. I tell you, this is an important day. I can’t waste it dragging your weight around. And if you drown or some­thing stupid like that, it’s my ass will be in the teeth.”</p>
   <p>Byrne rejoiced at having reason to put a whiperack in her voice. “For your information, Holden, I’ve retrieved everything you ever put in the main database, I’ve talked with the pilots who’ve flown this route, and my whole ca­reer has been in the Exploration Corps. Did you think they’d send a schoolgirl to evaluate your work? Let me grab some rations for myself, and the two of us can com­mence our mutual business. The sooner begun, the sooner done, correct?”</p>
   <p>For a second he glared. Then, shrugging: “We’ll try it. Bring food for forty-eight hours; we may not get back till after dark. Life jacket. Sleeping bag. Warmer clothes than you’re wearing, and several changes. It’s cold on the water, and you’ll be drenched repeatedly. You’ll have to separate out your stuff when we return. The croakers will put everything in the storerooms. Quick, now!”</p>
   <p>She sought the aircraft and did what was needful in a few minutes. Show that bastard. Strap the pistol back on over the new outfit; opposite it hang a Sony audiovisual recorder the size of her hand. Lash bag to packframe, stuff everything else inside, slip arms through straps, secure the bellyband, step forth again. “Quick enough?”</p>
   <p>Holden stopped pacing. Most of the Ihrdizu were gone. They had work of their own. Three males lingered. “Get busy,” he told them, and set off.</p>
   <p>Byrne took pleasure in matching his pace, burdened as she was. She could spare breath for speech, too. “Aren’t you pretty arrogant with them? And that word ‘croaker’—we don’t consider it polite.”</p>
   <p>“You’re not at Okuma Base, and those aren’t your hangers-on.” Fre didn’t look at her. Admittedly, you’d bet­ter watch your step on a downslope. Carelessness broke a lot of bones. “Here they respect power.”</p>
   <p>Beneath the mask and the tropical air, she felt her cheeks heat. “The power belongs to our administration and council, sir. We do not use it for bullying. A few thousand people on an entire planet, two decades from Earth, can’t afford to antagonize the inhabitants.”</p>
   <p>“Did I ever scream for help? I’ll protect myself.”</p>
   <p>“I’m here, among other things, to find out what kind of relationship you maintain. If nothing else, future gener­ations of us will be dealing with the Farlanders.”</p>
   <p>“God damn it, I don’t abuse them! Did they seem terrified? You don’t know how often I’ve forced myself to stay my hand—But not against the Rockridgers. I tell you, we have a perfectly reasonable arrangement. They’ve come to count on the tools and materials I requisition for them. In exchange, they assist me when I need it. But they are slobs. I have to make it quite clear to them, in as few and simple words as possible, what I want, else nothing would get done right.”</p>
   <p>“English words?”</p>
   <p>“They’ve learned. Why should I ruin my throat man­gling their language? Besides, it’s hopelessly vague and long-winded.”</p>
   <p>“You’d come to know them better.”</p>
   <p>“That isn’t what I’m here for. My purpose is to dis­cover something about the himatids, remember?”</p>
   <p>“You could at least show the Ihrdizu the respect to address them by their proper names.”</p>
   <p>“They don’t mind. My wife bestowed them. She was German. Those were pet names she gave them, and they knew it. She... liked them.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>As you don’t, </emphasis>Byrne thought.</p>
   <p>“We named individual himatids, too, according to a different system, and I’ve continued that,” Holden went on. “Sheer necessity there. How could a human keep a set of clicks and twangs straight in his mind? Not that I believe they have any concept corresponding to anything we’d rec­ognize as nomenclature.”</p>
   <p>“So you’ve reported. But have you considered the possibility that an individual may use a variety of different names according to circumstances, and frequently drop some or adopt new ones? It was the practice in Japan of the Heian period.”</p>
   <p>He gave her a brief regard. “You really have studied my work,” he said slowly, “and thought about it.”</p>
   <p>“How else could I judge what you’re doing?”</p>
   <p><image l:href="#_54.jpg"/></p>
   <p>His voice hardened. “Yes, I tried to analyze my data on the theory you mentioned. Failure. You think the ... Ihrdizu are unlike us. Compared to the himatids; they—and those Chupchup vags—are our kissing cousins. Look sharp, now!”</p>
   <p>Byrne obeyed. They had reached steepness. For a while the trail switchbacked among stiff yellow bushes that rattled in the wind. At high-water mark, the hillside turned into what was nearly a cliff. Only bare rock remained, un­der a blackly gleaming layer of ooze. Seaweed, dead ieh­thyoids, shells, less identifiable debris littered it. Flying creatures strange to her wheeled and whistled in their hun­dreds, landed to feast, flapped off again in alarm. Water ran down every channel. Close to receding sea level, it made a stream, centimeters deep, of the path the Ihrdizu had carved. Unhampered, they could climb freely about, but here they generally carried loads. It was well that they had corrugated the surface. Holden went ahead, often halting, ready to help Byrne. She picked her way cautiously. De­spite the breeze, sweat soon dripped off her skin. Several times she almost fell. Damn if she’d give him the satisfac­tion, though.</p>
   <p>Waves hacked, foam leaped, but there was no surf on the bight. Like the colonists of the Gash, the Rockridgers kept a pontoon dock moored some distance off. They swam to and fro, or used lighters to transfer freight. Several boats were tied up, together with a pair of ships about forty me­ters long. Their rigs were fore-and-aft, gaff-headed; on Genji, you’d best keep your center of action low. Holden’s craft lay closer in, a twelve-meter turbo cruiser with a crane and capstan forward of the deckhouse. When he spoke into a radiophone he took from his pocket, the vessel heaved, its anchor, drew close, and extended a gangplank.</p>
   <p>As she boarded, Byrne noticed corroded bronze letters on the bow: EMMA. She nodded at them. “Your wife’s name?” A possible approach through his hostility.</p>
   <p>“Daughter,” he said. “Died in infancy.”</p>
   <p>“Oh. I’m sorry.”</p>
   <p>“It happens.”</p>
   <p>Too often among humans on Genji, even where med­ical care was available. Sometimes Byrne wondered why they were on the planet, what sense it made. Yes, yes, the historical reasons, science, prestige, politics, superstition: quite a few people came voluntarily, though they knew it would be a one-way trip, hoping for freedom or challenging work or whatever they hoped for; the old reproductive in­stinct whispered, “Under these conditions, children = the fastest means of increasing our numbers = improved chances for bettering our lot”—yes, yes. But were they actually just building new pyramids, waging a new Cru­sade, investing their dreams in a-new cargo cult? Suppose they beamed Home a petition for an end. Suppose Earth was willing to pay the cost of bringing them back.</p>
   <p>What the hell was there for her on Earth?</p>
   <p>Only one grave behind, yonder house. May the small coffin still have been sound when Holden opened the soil for his wife. Genji lacked the right bacteria and worms to reduce a human corpse to clean bones.</p>
   <p>Byrne stowed her gear in the cabin, which was crammed full of apparatus. A locked cabinet held pistol, automatic rifle, and grenade gun. Were there large, danger­ous animals in this vicinity?</p>
   <p>She joined Holden in the ample cockpit. He had taken manual control. The cruiser growled swiftly outward. It rocked and bucked in the chop. Spray flew over the bows. Gunmetal whitecaps ran to the western steeps and the gate between them. Wind skirled, as chilly as he had warned. Clouds swept low and gray upon it. Occasionally a sun­beam struck through and flared off a patch of water. In this weather it was red.</p>
   <p>“You did remember to put on your life jacket,” he grunted.</p>
   <p>She sat down on the starboard bench beside the wheel and drew a long breath. “Why do you act like this?” she demanded. “I’ll try to enter a fair report in spite of your insults, but you could make things easier for both of us.”</p>
   <p>He peered straight ahead. “Should I pretend I’m over­joyed? I’ve lost the knack of pretending. But no, I didn’t mean any insult. I’m only trying to speak frankly and clearly. Don’t be so thin-skinned.”</p>
   <p>She clung to her patience. “I can understand if you’re piqued at having, the value of your work questioned. Well, nobody denies that what you, and your wife accomplished was extraordinary. You pioneered whole new fields of science.”</p>
   <p>He barked a laugh. “Indeed? When you don’t recall her name?”</p>
   <p>“Jesus Christ!—Uh, I’m sorry. It escaped me. Can’t you see what a shipload of information I had to acquire in a short time, if I was to do my job right? They thought about sending a fellow scientist who might better talk your language. But as you yourself remarked, the himatids are so different from the Ihrdizu. Nobody was professionally qualified except maybe Li Yuan, who’s old and frail. All the others have their hands full, anyway. And then, we’re concerned about more than just the science. Relationships with the autochthons, for instance. In the end, they settled on me. I’m ... a kind of generalist.” She waited a little before adding, “We’re stuck with each other. Let’s make the best of it.”</p>
   <p>“Why must they send anybody? What’s the complaint been?”</p>
   <p>“You know perfectly well. No complaint. Certain dis­turbing hints the pilots brought back. A couple of them speak fluent Ihrdizu and managed some conversation with the Rockridgers. Your overbearing attitude. Your outright threats against the community to the north, in the Gash. We want to forestall any possible trouble.”</p>
   <p>“I told you,” he rasped, “I get along with the Rock­ridgers. I don’t fawn on them, as apparently a lot of you moonsiders do on your croakers, but we get along. As for the Gashers, don’t you realize that they still hunt himatids? They gave up enslaving calves two or three generations ago simply because it no longer paid. Instead, they ate them. Not a one left there. They go after wild calves along un­colonized shores and carpet whales at sea.”</p>
   <p>“Is it that important? Oh, I know the arrival of the Ihrdizu was catastrophic for the himatids, but the horrors were phasing out already before humans reached Murasaki.”</p>
   <p>“Not because of any goodness in croaker hearts. En­slavement became uneconomic. It’s easier for the Rock­ridgers to get their local himatids to do odd diving jobs in exchange for cheap iron knives that soon rust away and need replacement. As for whaling, the Rockridgers never were real seafarers; they just trade up and down this coast_ The Gashers.. they are bold sailors. They <emphasis>like </emphasis>hunting, and the meat.”</p>
   <p>“I know. You’ve described it often and bitterly in your reports. But you admit it isn’t a real Gasher industry. They take opportunities, which aren’t common enough to threaten the species. They never hunt in this bay, do they?<sup>–</sup></p>
   <p>“No. I’d blow them out of the water if they tried.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll agree the situation is deplorable. However, we can’t impose our will on beings who do us no harm and outnumber us a rnillionfold and in this case live half a planet away. Besides, Rockridge and the Gash belong to the same society. How would you like it if a foreigner at­tacked neighbors of yours? How well would you cooperate with him afterward?”</p>
   <p>“The Rockridgers would, for the sake of my trade goods. Croakers have rudimentary consciences, if any.”</p>
   <p>Indignation snatched at Byrne. “So you say! I don’t. And certainly, humans care. Especially when we know the Ihrdizu are intelligent beings, and it’s far from proven that the himatids are.”</p>
   <p>“I haven’t done anything,” Holden said sullenly. “Unless you’d forbid me to express outrage.”</p>
   <p>Byrne calmed somewhat. “I’m not accusing you, sir. You asked if there were complaints against you. I listed certain matters that headquarters feels should be cleared up. I’m sure you can do that. Don’t be so thin-skinned.”</p>
   <p>His short-lived grin surprised her. “Ha!”</p>
   <p>“The major question—” Byrne broke off.</p>
   <p>“Ye?—he prompted.</p>
   <p>She sighed. was searching for words. But if you want a moratorium on tact, all right. You know quite well what the problem is. You receive messages as well as send them. Your replies have been... unsatisfactory. Resources for scientific research on Genji are more tight than ever, what with Chujo studies competing. Your<sub>,</sub> station is a sig­nificant drain on them. A single man, true—but he needs food, clothes, medicines, spare parts, new equipment, everything, first produced, then flown around the globe. Plus the hazard. You remember, I hope, how Antonio Si, monetti lost his aircraft and barely escaped with his life on a flight to you. You may not have stopped to think what the rescue operation cost.”</p>
   <p>“Do you mean that what we do should be cost-free?” he gibed. “If so, I have news for you.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, of course the outlays were justified earlier”—she paused for half a second—“when your work was ep­och-making. But what has it become, these last several Earth years? Your reports have grown more and more per­functory, repetitious, concerned with trivial details. Identi­fication of another kind of weed the himatids make rope from. Isolation of another combination of sounds, with clues to suggest it <emphasis>might mean a </emphasis>specific rock at a certain point of ebb tide. Is that sort of thing worth maintaining you, when we could perhaps unravel that wonderful system of kinship among the Flowery Mountain Ihrdizu?”</p>
   <p>“Which you claim matters more than getting to un­derstand an entire different race?” he snapped. “Or is it simply easier?”</p>
   <p>Abrupt, unexpected sympathy touched Byrne. “I re­alize this has been your lifework,” she said. “But you are growing old, Dr. Holden. And maybe you’re at the limits of what one man, even a young man, can discover alone. Maybe your himatids will have to wait for a proper xen­ological team, someday, that’ll build on what you’ve dis­covered. You needn’t rusticate on moonside, you know. There’s never a dearth of problems to tackle.</p>
   <p>“I don’t claim, right now, that that is the case. I’m here to find out what is, and make recommendations. that’s all. Won’t you please help? You’ll find me wide open to whatever you want to say or show.</p>
   <p>“Then pay attention,” he, answered.</p>
   <p>She bit her lip and fell silent, gazing about her. Afar she spied a schooner, if that was the right term, that had rounded the northern headland and was bound in the gate. Tiny at their distance, sails spread like wings before the sea wind. Its deep whittering was well-nigh lost in the rush and boom of water close ahead. There a reef lay near a sparsely begrown islet. Waves broke on both, riptides churned and spouted between. And; yes, two himatids were present. One swam in the channel, visible to her as a ribbon that occa­sionally reared up out of the foam. The other was picking berries on the holm. Byrne’s look sought it eagerly. Hith­erto she had seen the creatures only in visuals.</p>
   <p>This calf must be rather young; perhaps ten Earth years had passed since it came here from ashore and ceased to be a tad. She gauged by size. The body, a few centi­meters thick, was about two meters long and half a meter wide, a sinuous wet obsidian shading to gray-white on the belly where the many tiny mouths were, each with its claw-tooth. Between the fifteen pairs of flexible arms she made out glints off the eyes. The two arms flanking the blunt point to which the ribbon came remained idle; they could grasp things if necessary, but were specialized for making sounds. Farther back, digits held fast to the slippery surface. The last third was submerged, taking up moisture and dis­solved oxygen. That didn’t matter to Byrne; the ends were exactly alike.</p>
   <p>The swimmer lifted itself again and—stared?—in her direction. It was older, twice the size of its companion. After a moment it oscillated toward the boat.</p>
   <p>Holden had set the engine to idle and taken an optical from its case beside the wheel. He peered. “Japheth,” he said. “And, hmm, that’s Ishmael ashore.”</p>
   <p>Byrne recollected that he had his own names for them. “How can you tell?” she asked.</p>
   <p>He cast her a disdainful glance. “Markings, propor­tions, style of motion and body language. It takes experi­ence, patience, time that can’t be accounted for in any properly academic report.” After a moment he added, think that more than half of himatid communication is by signs. The most important half, at that—emotion, art, what’d give us a little insight into their psychology. How am I supposed to learn it from them, let alone talk it with them? If Okuma would send the equipment for decent sim­ulations—But no, they’d rather bitch at me for not produc­ing more reports.”</p>
   <p>“They’ve explained that both the hardware and the program would have to be developed practically from scratch,” Byrne retorted. “If you refuse to believe—Never mind.” Conciliate him. “Yes, you are handicapped. We all are, on Genji. Just the same, you’ve done a remarkable job of getting to know these beings.” Well, it was his obses­sion, his reason for remaining alive. “Seems like that fel­low has something to say to you. Or is it simply curious, or what?”</p>
   <p>She saw how the man tensed. “I hope to find out. Get a hint, anyway. They often wait for me here. At least, I often find some here. I told you this is a special time.”</p>
   <p>Her pulse quickened. “How?”</p>
   <p>“A pod of carpet whale are passing offshore, bound north, after budding. That’s always a great occasion, like a holy day.” Holden made a mouth. “Except that it isn’t superstitious. This epiphany is real.”</p>
   <p>“But how do the calves know? I thought juveniles and adults had nothing to do with each other.”</p>
   <p>Contempt flared. “Carpet whales mate, hermaphrodit­ically, when they’ve built up adequate tissue reserves. There’s no fixed time for that, but after they’ve reached these waters and budded off, the young swim ashore to take up life on land. The calves notice the tads coming in. They’re not stupid, whatever the croakers claim.”</p>
   <p>Byrne flushed hot. She barely controlled her reply. “I’m not stupid either, sir. If you were dumped down in a totally new environment, a fact or two might fail to pop out of your memory at once. Or do you deny that?”</p>
   <p>Was he a trifle mollified? He didn’t apologize, but did say, rather quietly, “1 suspect the cues are more chemical than visual. The new-budded tads are so small, and come in randomly. Himatids give off their wastes through the skin, as liquids and gases, you know; and they appear to sense with their entire bodies. It’s nothing like what you and I experience.”</p>
   <p>No. she thought, absolutely not. The whole cycle—Mindless little thing like a caterpillar, prey for every larger animal, but adding neuronal tissue as well as size till it was too big for existence on land. The tough, wary, lucky, min­uscule minority that survived, seeking out tidewater regions where calves dwelt and coming under their wtelage. No concept of family; but the little ones could hunt and gather in crannies where larger, older individuals could not In exchange they got protection, training, education in what­ever passed for tradition among himatids—It wasn’t any­thing a human would ever really comprehend. Did the effort to do so make him, in the end, unhuman? Byrne thought of a mystic striving to know God. But Holden spat on any such ideas.</p>
   <p>He pointed. “See that trident Japheth’s carrying?” he remarked. “Pure native work, shell, bone, wooden shaft, rawhide lashing. I’ve never seen a calf with metal when the whales are passing by. Ritual, or what?”</p>
   <p>The great form drew alongside and rose above the port rail. Feet braced wide on the swaying cockpit floor, Holden tilted his head back, looking up toward the foremost hands. Byrne had a fleeting fantasy of an ancient savage before some idol, about to make sacrifice. Digits rubbed over tex­tured palms and against each other. Stridulations went loud through wind and water noises. Holden uttered harsh sounds—meant to imitate?—and made gestures. Byrne reached for her recorder.</p>
   <p><image l:href="#_69.jpg"/></p>
   <p>Odors welled from the himatid. They weren’t offen­sive, they were pungent, bittersweet. Dizziness swooped. Byrne gasped. There’d been something buried in the mass of briefing material, yes, narcotic effect on humans: and here she was, less than two meters downwind.</p>
   <p>Holden saw. “Get below!” he yelled. “Quick, before you’re so looped you walk overboard!”</p>
   <p>She scrambled. Having closed the cabin hatch, she stumbled to the bow port, opened it, and breathed deep. Her head cleared. The dose had been slight.</p>
   <p>But she was stuck here till the himatid left. Holden’s air intake held a chemical filter. He must take it for, granted after these many years. His visitor’s need didn’t occur to him. Well, now he’d better not sneer at her for being for­getful. <emphasis>He </emphasis>didn’t have to cram everything into his head in a couple of Genjian days. No, he’d been told to expect her, if not quite this soon, and make things ready. He couldn’t be bothered. The wretch.</p>
   <p>Huddled in racketing gloom, Byrne waited. It seemed long before his voice reached her, faint and dull through the hatch. Nonetheless, she heard the excitement.</p>
   <p>“I’m going off with Japheth. It has ... invited me ... to witness something, I think. Sit tight. Don’t fool with the boat. It’ll keep station by itself.”</p>
   <p>She let fury flare, though she spoke the words under her breath. When she had finished and emerged, she was alone. The berrypicker had filled a woven basket and de­parted. Byrne settled onto a bench and glowered across the whitecaps. The schooner had drawn nearer.</p>
   <p>Time dragged by. The murkiness under the hills grew higher as the enormous tide receded. When the mud flats were exposed, they’d be full of stranded sea life and the Ihrdizu would come down to scavenge. Doubtless they had long since wiped out competing animals. In many respects they resembled humans. Was that why Holden disliked them? He couldn’t reasonably blame them for what their ancestors did to his beloved himatids—to the himatids on which he was fixated.</p>
   <p>Not that the creatures weren’t fascinating. What did they think, feel, dream, create? Had such questions any meaning?</p>
   <p>Once. Byrne had read about a flurry of enthusiasm on Earth a few centuries ago, for a notion that the cetaceans, the big aquatic mammals, possessed intelligence compara­ble to the human. Facts soon killed it. Was Holden similarly deluding himself? Most Ihrdizu who thought about the sub­ject at all maintained to this day that the himatids were merely clever animals. True, they made simple tools; but other beasts made nests, burrows, traps, artifacts often in­tricate, designs cunningly adapted to ambience. Need the himatids be more sentient than, say, <emphasis>Australopithecus </emphasis>was? That would explain why Ihrdizu who tried—whether as slavers or otherwise—never managed to communicate be­yond the most elementary signals, never got more perfor­mance than a skilled trainer could get out of a dog.</p>
   <p>Certainly the himatids had nothing like a brain. How much thinking was possible in that diffuse a nervous system?</p>
   <p>Some Ihrdizu did believe the carpet whales, the sex­ually mature stage, attained mystical insights during their long lives at sea. (How long? Unknown.) What was Hol­den’s opinion? Byrne smiled. She could well imagine. On the other hand, could he plausibly claim that the adults kept anything of calf culture, even of calf sapience? Pasturing on equivalents of krill and plankton, too huge for natural enemies except hypothetical disease germs, synapse paths grown fifty or more meters long, wouldn’t they placidly lose whatever consciousness they once had? In truth, they showed scant wits when Ihrdizuan hunting ships came upon them. Harpooned, held fast, they were cut to pieces. Oc­casionally a seine trapped one in shoal water till the tide went out; then the Ihrdizu began eating it while it was alive.</p>
   <p>Byrne grimaced. She had seen visuals taken from aloft by early explorers. If Holden hated the cruelty, she agreed, and regretted the infeasibility of putting a stop to it. How­ever, she suspected his resentment was of interference with his research. The more himatids for him to study, the better; and their numbers were shrunken.</p>
   <p>Lightning flared among the clouds. A line squall swal­lowed vision as it swept up from the south bay. Byrne re­treated to the cabin. Humans didn’t have Ihrdizuan skins. That rain would be downright painful, striking her. Let Hol­den endure it, since he chose. It roared on the overhead.</p>
   <p>The boat pitched and rolled. She was immune to seasick­ness, but dank chill gnawed through her clothes. How had Holden’s wife enjoyed living, existing, in this environment, year upon year upon year? The record showed the couple seldom taking a vacation among what amenities moonside offered. Well, maybe he wasn’t such a grouch in those days. But he should have seen how Farland was wearing her down. Although no autopsy was done, it was obvious from the laconic statement he entered that her heart gave out. Why hadn’t she quit in time? Didn’t she notice? Did she choose to stay regardless? What for? She’d already lost her child. Did she love Malchiel that much? In God’s name, why?</p>
   <p>When the storm had passed and Byrne went back top­side, the sky was half clear. Murasaki light blazed and shat­tered on waves still high. The wind had lessened and warmed, shifting easterly; now the ship yonder must tack across it. Given a thick atmosphere with a steep density gradient, a large bowl among hills often bred its own weather.. Byrne was hungry. She assembled a sandwich from her rations while she spent a little charge on a bottle battery to make some coffee. Just a little; Genjian wilder­nesses taught frugality. The trick was to flash a small amount of water to its boiling point under this pressure, then use that to extract the essence and heat the rest.</p>
   <p>No sign of Holden yet. Damn him for’ a lead-plated boor. She squinted against the brilliance around her. Some­thing in the west, an extra turmoil,, a dark movement—Decision. She appropriated a length of line, rigged a safety harness, and climbed the crane. Doing that alone wasn’t the best idea in the universe, when the launch reeled through a good fifteen degrees of arc and the acceleration downward was almost as many meters per square second. The hell with it. If Holden caught her, she’d point out that he ha­bitually went partnerless. She had slung his optical around her neck. Raising it to her eyes, she magnified and amplified.</p>
   <p>Yes, a whole school of calves, all sizes up to the one about which the others writhed, dived, made spyhopping­leaps. .. danced? It was much the biggest. Estimating distame as seven klicks, she deemed its length five meters. That was about as large <emphasis>as </emphasis>they got during their thirty-some Earth years of calfhood, she remembered.</p>
   <p>Hold on. Wasn’t a black shape bound away from them, toward her? A wake roiled behind its swiftness. That wouldn’t ordinarily happen, as smoothly as himatids moved. A metallic gleam. Uh-huh. The great Dr. Holden deigned to return. Byrne clambered back down and waited for him. Her back felt stiff enough to ache between the shoulder blades.</p>
   <p>The swimmer, half again the man’s length, gripped his belt with six rear arms and towed him. For the most part he was submerged, but his snorkel stuck erect. Thus equipped, he could stay under more deeply than an Ihrdizu. His time must be limited by heat loss, if nothing else, but as he neared she saw that he had changed into a wet suit while she was below. He probably kept it in a locker under a bench, wanting to be prepared for a dive on short notice, and had left his coverall there. Byrne had seen scuba gear <emphasis>in </emphasis>the cabin. With this kind of help, he’d rarely need it. His reports never mentioned such details. They were altogether impersonal. “It was observed that—”</p>
   <p>At the hull, the himatid let go. Treading water, Holden raised an arm. “Thanks, Joshua,” she heard. So he was capable of gestures toward that species, if not his own. A ripple passed through the broad thinness; a response? Byrne noticed spots of somewhat lighter black scattered along it. By such marks, among other tokens, Holden told his indi­viduals apart. Joshua didn’t turn around. Double-ended, it headed straight back toward the commotion among its kind.</p>
   <p>Holden came up the Jacob’s ladder amidships. Water ran off him into the cockpit. The launch absorbed it in the pores of its fabric and spewed it off. Byrne tried for po­liteness. “How did your excursion go?”</p>
   <p><sup>–</sup>It’s just begun,<sup>–</sup> he said, no less brusquely than be­fore. “Now, I have to peel this thing off me.”</p>
   <p>Byrne grinned. “I’m not shy. If you prefer, I’ll turn my back.”</p>
   <p>He acted indifferent. That might well mean he’d rather not display an aging, knobbly frame to a young woman who had no sexual interest in him. Byrne looked outward. Sunlight and cloud shadows swept over the whitecaps. “Would you like me to heat you some soup?” she ven­tured. It was all the food he could take in that helmet of his.</p>
   <p>“No. No time. I’ll lose too much as is, letting you off.”</p>
   <p>Her fingers closed on the coaming. “What?”</p>
   <p>“I’ll transfer you to yonder ship. I know it, a coast­wise packet, it’ll take you ashore. I need to speak with the captain anyway.”</p>
   <p>Almost, Byrne swung around and glared. She curbed herself. “Why? Where are you bound?”</p>
   <p>“To sea. A piece of serious work ahead. Can’t have an outsider underfoot.”</p>
   <p>Byrne clenched her<sup>;</sup>jaws before she said, “For your information, I’ve been on eleven xenological expeditions, four of them to littorals. You know who Elena Sarbiewski is, I trust. She recommended me for this job. In fact, she talked me into it. I will not get in your way. I may well be of help. Do you want me to enter an honest, complete report on your activities and what they’re worth, or don’t you?”</p>
   <p>For the first time, she caught hesitation in his tone. “I didn’t foresee ... what this situation would prove to be. Things may get ... a bit dangerous. No, I don’t question your courage or competence.” Was that reluctance, or was she being unfair? The wet suit smacked on the floor. She heard a locker opened and brisk toweling. “But I am the only man alive who’s got any fractional familiarity with what’s here. Would you want me along in the jungles of Southland when you knew things were about to go critical?”</p>
   <p>“Will you explain to me what you mean?”</p>
   <p>“It’s—complicated. I’ve learned that this is a special occasion indeed. Call it sacred if you choose. I, well, I’ll have trouble enough avoiding, uh, faux pas. You know nothing about their, their mores.”</p>
   <p>Byrne relaxed very slightly. “A point. I can stay well inboard, though.”</p>
   <p>“No, no. It’s ... too subtle. That’s part of the reason my reports have grown, uh, brief. What I’m beginning to discover—the language of science doesn’t reach to that sort of thing.”</p>
   <p>Byrne nodded. “I can empathize. Among the Ihrdizu, too, we get into areas where all we have is intuition, for whatever little it is worth.”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” he said eagerly. “That’s what I meant. You wait ashore. When I get back we can talk at leisure.”</p>
   <p>She couldn’t argue. Somehow she didn’t feel he was quite sincere. Hermits got scant practice in lying. However, what could she do? She stared west, marshaling her thoughts.</p>
   <p>“I’m ready,” Holden said. She joined him at the wheel. Again he was coveralled. He opened the engine up and steered for the ship. Athwart wild silvery clouds his head, inside the helmet, lifted like a brush-bristling crag. Wind skirled, sharp with salt. Waves crashed.</p>
   <p>“Can you tell me anything of what this is about?” Byrne asked.</p>
   <p>He scowled forward awhile. When he answered, each word was chosen beforehand. “I suppose you’ve met Christians. But do you know what their faith really is—originally was? Not milksop goodwill and vague self-de­lusions about some pink-and-white hereafter. It was, as stern a religion as Earth ever saw. What it dealt with was death, judgment, and transfiguration.” The majestic phrases rolled off his tongue:—<emphasis>For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>A hand chopped air. “Men lived and died by that for centuries before they learned better. Now what if it were true?”</p>
   <p>He glanced at her. “I don’t say the himatids have any—thing we’d call a religion. What do we mean by that noise, anyway? But they do know transfiguration, not as some­thing a preacher tells them, not as metaphysical gabble, but a fact. The calf becomes a whale and moves from the tide­water to the deep sea. It is never heard from again, seldom and barely glimpsed. But from it arises the new, blind life, which gains awareness among the calves. What further comes, once the creature swims beyond the horizon? We’ve read our anthropology, you and I. Can you imagine how it must be not to need myths, because life itself is the myth?”</p>
   <p>Her skin tingled. “Rite, of passage,” she whispered.</p>
   <p>He nodded. Once more his voice came hoarse and dry. “Solomon, the oldest of them, is going out. It’s not quite so big yet that it can no longer live in the bay, but it soon will be. And today the carpet whales are passing by, bound for the arctic—which the calves know only is a mystery somewhere northward. Solomon will join them. It is dying as a calf, being born as a whale. Because that is happening right after the tads came ashore, Solomon is—especially blessed. I doubt we have any concept that fits.</p>
   <p>“They’ll let me escort him to the pod.”</p>
   <p>The wind shrilled.</p>
   <p>Byrne’s mind leaped. “Your chance to make contact with the whales?”</p>
   <p>“You do catch on fast,” he granted. “Not that I haven’t tried before.”</p>
   <p>“I know. You’d go out, and signal them according to what you’d learned from the calves. They ignored you.”</p>
   <p>“Correct. My guess is that the personality, the lan­guage, changes even more than the body. They ... put childish things behind. My attempts at communication mean nothing to them. If I could find one or two that, used to live in Gunnunggung Bay, individuals who actually knew me—that may not be too many years ago for them to remember and be interested. But I never have. A pod keeps moving, and it’s widely dispersed over an enormous area. Long before I get close to more than a few, my fuel runs low and I’ve got to turn back. Today I’ll be with Solomon. I don’t know what difference that will make. Maybe none. But at least I’ll see something I never did before, and, and Solomon may come ... say hello to me in my boat, when it returns here.”</p>
   <p>“Revelations aren’t common in science,” Byrne said. “I envy you this possibility.” She wished she meant that a hundred percent.—It wasn’t his unpleasant character, she told herself. Well, it shouldn’t be. But he was hiding some­thing from her.</p>
   <p>The cruiser met the schooner and matched speed, three meters off. Holden shouted. An Ihrdizu who must be the skipper pushed through several crewfolk at the rail and re­plied. The cries went back and forth. Byrne saw Holden’s fingers whiten on the wheel spokes. What news had he received? What reply did he give? She realized that he could form those sounds better than she when he cared to. Between her own unfamiliarity with the dialect and the noise from sea, wind, creaking tackle, she caught no more than fragments.</p>
   <p>He turned to her. “All right,” he said. “They’ll take you. Can you get aboard in a sling?” Grimly, she declined to resent that. “Fetch your pack. I’ll transfer it first. Settle yourself in ashore.”</p>
   <p>Power-operated, the crane lowered her to the other deck. Nonetheless, she needed agility when everything swung and jerked under Genjian weight. She waved at Hol­den. He sheered off without response. Maybe he hadn’t noticed. His propeller left a white tumult aft as he made for the himatids.</p>
   <p>The Rockridge sailors were friendly, excitedly curious. In the three hours that followed, Byrne struggled toward communication with them. Those pilots who had talked more easily in the past knew the patois from which this derived. She did not. Near the end, she had acquired suf­ficient vocabulary that she could ask questions. “What did you tell the male of my kind?” The captain broke in, belch­ing and gobbling words strange to her. Slang? The crew hesitated a moment. Then, oh, yes, they would be delighted to show her around.</p>
   <p>She didn’t believe they had misunderstood her. But what was the use? Holden had ordered them to keep mum. They probably didn’t know why. That the trade goods came through him gave him ample authority. Besides, otherwise humans were essentially an unknown quantity. Discretion was the better part of valor.</p>
   <p>The differences from moonside vessels made her tour interesting, though the cargo of salt ichthyoid smelled like a sewage processor in Okuma. Meanwhile, Holden’s craft disappeared out the gate.</p>
   <p>The ship lay to at the dock. Two sailors brought her ashore in a dinghy. Well, not quite. Twin outriggers sta­bilized it against waves that traveled faster and struck harder than on Earth. Ihrdizu were ill-suited to rowing; one took the helm, the other walked a treadmill that drove small paddlewheels.</p>
   <p>The climb to the heights was long, stiff, wet below and hot above. She reached the house very ready to put her feet up near a cup of coffee with a shot of whiskey in it. Later she’d find her things among the shipment boxes. Bringing them into the living quarters would require several tedious depressurizations in the lock.</p>
   <p>To take off her, mask and breathe cool, odorless, Earth-type air was like a benediction. She spent a minute savoring it before she rummaged about. While the coffee brewed she investigated further. Snooping? No, she’d be here a while, she needed to scout the territory.</p>
   <p>Nothing private came to light. The main , room in­cluded the kitchenette. Behind it were a lesser chamber with a double bed, a bath cubicle that promised her <emphasis>a </emphasis>shower, and a laboratory equipped for basic biological, chemical, and geological work. She could spread her pad and sleeping bag there. Holden wouldn’t likely offer her the bed.. She’d decline if he did. His wife had shared it, and a crib must once have stood close by.</p>
   <p>Should he make a pass, he’d be sorry. Byrne held a black belt. She felt certain he had no such intention. If nothing else, he’d never willingly reveal that much vulner­ability to her.</p>
   <p>She reentered the main room. It was as impersonal as a cell. Whatever decoration his wife put in, he had re­moved. Maybe he didn’t care to watch it gather dust and decay, year by year. His desk stood equally devoid of everything nonfunctional. Audiovisuals of people and past scenes must be in his database, along with recreational reading, shows, music, and, to be sure, his references and files. Yielding to an impulse, she keyed the computer. It required a password. She suspected it was programmed to wipe its entire contents in case of any other entry mode.</p>
   <p>She lingered at the phone. How about calling HQ? No.</p>
   <p>They knew she’d arrived safely, and she had no hard in­formation for them. When might she? When Holden gave her some cooperation, damn it. Couldn’t he see how he damaged his cause? He was no fool. Could they be right and he actually cracked?</p>
   <p>The reason he gave for not taking her along to sea was ... paranoid. He had no cause to suppose her incapable of discretion, tact—assuming he knew what the words meant! If somehow she did jeopardize his mission, he was the cap­tain, he could order her below and she was legally bound to obey. Instead, he left her on that ship, after getting some news from its crew and laying silence about it on them.</p>
   <p>Byrne frowned. The fortified coffee comforted her mouth and cleared weariness from her mind. Let her think.</p>
   <p>She’d taken him more or less unawares. That he car­ried on as planned, on this special day for his himatids, was understandable. But did the invitation to accompany Solo­mon out catch him quite by surprise? Hardly. Again and again and again, his reports had dwelt on the difficulty of communication. He believed the whole basis of language—not the kind of signals, but their semantics, their structure—was unlike the human, the Ihrdizuan, or, probably, the Chujoan. That was plausible, as alien as the himatids were. In fact, it was grounds for closing down the project. If he couldn’t really talk after all this time, if he couldn’t even prove the creatures were fully intelligent, then hadn’t he gone past the point of diminishing returns?</p>
   <p>A sideline question. Byrne hauled her attention back to the main issue. Supposing that Holden was not merely reading into their behavior what he wanted to find and that the himatids did possess minds, then they could <emphasis>not </emphasis>sud­denly have sprung their proposal on him. He must have angled a long while for something of the kind, they striving to grasp what it was he meant, Probably there was never any breakthrough of comprehension. This simply became the day when the plan was finally agreed on.</p>
   <p>What was in it for the calves? Could the original re­quest have been theirs? They might see an opportunity to learn something about those beings whom they only knew were their elders and parents—like Christians given a chance to send a living emissary to the afterworld—</p>
   <p>What if he came back and told them the ancient Ro­mans had been right and the departed were feeble-minded shades? What if the carpet whales lost sapience? Another sideline question.</p>
   <p>It still didn’t make sense that Holden dismissed Byrne. She would in fact have been a genuine, perhaps vital help, as crew, assistant, independent observer. Did he want to hog the entire credit? No, that was crazy; everybody would know how subordinate her role had been, and he could well hope for a glowing encomium from her. Was he crazier yet, unable to see plain logic? In either case, he had no business out there.</p>
   <p>Or perhaps</p>
   <p>Byrne snatched a breath. A spurt of coffee flew along. She dropped the cup in her lap, choked, sputtered, dabbled futilely at the mess.</p>
   <p>Somehow that became a<sub>s</sub>sign unto her. Nobody is per­fectly competent, completely sane. We need to watch over each other. She had the capability; therefore, she had the duty.</p>
   <p>Hours had passed. Holden had traveled far. Neverthe­less, Byrne went through the drill step by conscious step. The least failure of preparation might kill her, or more than her.</p>
   <p>When she went forth, Murasaki burned close to noon­day height. Windless heat baked acrid odors from the soil. Leaves on shrubs and low trees hung <emphasis>as </emphasis>if cut from brass. Few clouds remained overhead, but in the west, above the ocean, they raised a darkling rampart where lightning flick­ered and, faintly across distance, thunder mumbled. Near the thorp, half a dozen Ihrdizu stared her way. She knew by their stance how uneasy they were. Well, she too. She crawled into her aircraft, sealed it, depressurized the cabin, slipped her mask off, strapped in. Her fingers roved the controls. Engines droned. She lifted.</p>
   <p>Gain altitude. If nothing untoward was going on, she didn’t wish to disturb Holden’s subjects, his work. Get in­visibly high.</p>
   <p>The bay dwindled to a mercury pool between golden and dun contours. Outside it stretched arrays of rock and white chaos, a dangerous passage for a man to dare. Be­yond, the planet curved vastly westward, sea gleaming wrinkled, until the storm front raised its wall. Byrne saw it white above, blue-black and flameful below.</p>
   <p>Close by—yes! Byrne set the robot to fly slowly in a circle and activated her main viewscreen. Magnified, the scene leaped at her.</p>
   <p>A score of carpet whales swam within a reach of sev­eral square kilometers. The titanic black forms—the largest easily a hundred meters long, twenty-five broad—flowed on the waves; she saw how each billowed up and back down, in different sectors, as the surges passed beneath. Windblown scud hazed the sight, but she also made out their own long undulations, which drove them ever north­ward. The pace was as slow, a few knots. It never slack­ened, though, it went on and on, it would march like the tides or the days and nights or a Bach fugue until the giants were home in their waters around the pole. Abrupt tears stung her eyes. She had seen visuals, but here she met the elemental reality.</p>
   <p>And Holden was down there amidst it. She thought that now she might begin to comprehend him.</p>
   <p>Holden. Where was he? She reduced magnification, broadening the field. Yonder? She redirected the instrument and magnified afresh. “No!” ripped out of her.</p>
   <p>Blood made a spreading inkblot across the gray, green, white stampede that was the sea. A whale writhed to and fro at the middle. In her mind she heard wind-hoot, wave-rush, the crash when that body heaved and fell back. Through the cold she tasted salt and blood in spindrift, smelled agony in the air. A ship lay by. Its sails were furled except for a jib and a main reefed to the last point Masts swayed wildly. They slammed to a halt at one end of their arc, as the harpoon lines binding hull to prey drew taut.</p>
   <p>Humans would be mad to make thus fast in such weather. Ihrdizu could swim ashore, come worse to worst. Holden had called the Gash folk bold sailors.</p>
   <p>Holden, Holden. She turned the dials in frantic search.</p>
   <p>A second ship appeared. Its mainmast floated in a tangle of rigging, to batter at planks already chewed. Flames licked over the deck, smoke blew off in rags. The ship listed ever more heavily to starboard. The sea must be pour­ing in through some hole such as a launched high-explosive grenade would blast.</p>
   <p>Holden’s cruiser roiled water; bound for the first whaler she had seen. It was tiny in the viewfield, a horrible toy. Stop it, stop it.</p>
   <p>Byrne drew breath after breath. She willed steadiness. Slow the, pulse, cool the heart, sharpen the eyes, quicken the brain. After a minute she took over control and dived.</p>
   <p>No use radioing. He was on deck, the murderous lu­natic, at the wheel, at his guns. Put the fear of the Lord into him. Her engines drummed, louder than the nearing thunders. Ocean swelled till she could have counted every maned crest and cavernous trough.</p>
   <p>The screen had locked onto the cruiser. Beneath her Holden turned into a human figure. And there came an Ihr­dizu. He (?) must have jumped from the doomed ship while Holden lay close and fired on it. Behind him swam two more. Their tentacles held knife, ax, boat hook—weapons. Oh, the brave idiots! The leader intercepted the boat. As it rolled to port, he reached up a forepaw, caught the rail, started to pull himself aboard.</p>
   <p>Holden saw. He drew his pistol and shot. The Ihrdizu fell back into the sea. Holden left the others in his wake.</p>
   <p>The aircraft raged toward him. He looked aloft. Byrne stabbed touch pads. Sight dimmed when acceleration dragged blood downward. A hundred meters high, the flyer swung back heavenward.</p>
   <p>Panting; she leveled off at one klick, circled about, and peered. He was still clear in the screen. His left hand gripped the wheel. He raised his right fist and shook it.</p>
   <p>“You son of a bitch!” she screamed uselessly into the transmitter. “Get away! Return! Next time my jets will make a cinder of you!”</p>
   <p>He, increased power. The launch skimmed over wave tops, tore through their masses, onward. A fountain spouted at either bow.</p>
   <p>Vomit rose bitter in Byrne’s gullet. She swallowed it but could not altogether quell tears. Her threat was not only unheard, it was empty. Safe herself, she couldn’t loose her sole weapon, because it was lethal. She’d go on trial for manslaughter at least Not that her hands would obey, did she command them to attack. And Holden knew it. Did he laugh aloud, into the oncoming storm?</p>
   <p>“All right,” she gulped. “For your information, sir, in case you’ve forgotten, the law makes killing of any sa­pient, human or nonhuman, the same. It’s got to, or we’d soon be hated and overwhelmed. We have no jurisdiction over what aliens do to each other, but we have over our own kind. You’ve committed murder, Holden.”</p>
   <p>A faint hope fluttered. She kept her altitude and cir­cled, waiting. Back and forth she swept the viewfield.</p>
   <p>The cruiser lanced toward the first ship. Byrne found its deck and magnified. “Thanks, thanks,” she gasped. She must, though there be nobody to say it to. That crew was casting loose from the whale. A second jib and the mizzen were going up.</p>
   <p>Clouds had boiled eastward across the sky. Rain ca­taracted from them. Byrne tossed about in blind, lightning-riven <emphasis>gray. </emphasis>Hailstones banged on metal.</p>
   <p>When the squall had passed, the main storm hulked very near. Byrne saw the Gasher ship close-hauled, beating north. Holden trailed at a distance. So he didn’t intend to sink it. He’d<sub>,</sub> just make sure it went home, bearing its story. His fanaticism recognized some limit. But how many sail­ors from the foundered vessel would reach land alive?</p>
   <p>Byrne focused on the wounded whale. Two of its fel­lows had swum to its side. She wondered what passed around the herd—those sounds traveled tens of kilome­ters—and what it meant. Pledge of help? Consolation for the dying? She didn’t know whether the creature was mor­tally hurt or not. Nor did she know whether the clicks and thrums and boomings were aught but animal noises. Sil­verbucks, fenrises, skyrangers, and more rallied to their dis­tressed kindred. Documentaries from Earth told of apes, wolves, dolphins, and their big cousins, Instinct. Some con­sciousness, too, yes, but dim, unreasoning.</p>
   <p>“I hope you survive,” she whispered.</p>
   <p>The storm was almost upon her. She must either run from it or rise above it; else it might break her wings and dash her into the sea. A well-found watercraft could better ride it out. Nevertheless, Holden was crazy reckless to keep dogging the ship.</p>
   <p>Maybe best would be if he sank. Byrne winced. She brought her aircraft about and fled east.</p>
   <p>Land. Make the vehicle secure. Genjian winds were usually slow, but density gave monstrous momentum. Get inside.</p>
   <p>While the weather brawled around, she paced, lashed by her thoughts. What to tell them at Okuma? A police squad couldn’t arrive till well after Holden had probably returned here. Of course, she could leave before then.</p>
   <p>She wouldn’t. She’d come to do a job. Too much was unexplained, unfinished. Holden should keep sense enough not to menace her, unless he had turned into a homicidal maniac. If he had, she expected she could cope.</p>
   <p>In any event, the information needn’t perish with her. She didn’t want to divulge it, not yet. That would take matters out of her hands. The authorities themselves would have little choice. There were depths and subtleties here, and maybe a hermit’s stubborn pride to placate. There were issues larger than one man’s fate, or one woman’s. She needed to explore them.</p>
   <p>In the end, she made a satellite relay call to Carlos Villareal. He was out; she got his machine, which was a disappointment. Some talk, private jokes, pet names would have been welcome in this wanly lit, chilly room where walls trembled under the wind. However, she would have concluded regardless by logging an encrypted message, putting him on his honor not to decode for fifty hours and to wipe it if she called back sooner.</p>
   <p>Thereafter it was a matter of waiting. She helped her­self from the cupboards and cooked a meal. Holden ate adequately but dully. She napped. When the storm had passed, she went out, brought her things from the store­rooms, and arranged them in the house. She had another meal. She resumed her mask and strolled to the thorp, where she talked with the natives, bit by bit mastering their dialect.</p>
   <p>Either they shied from saying much about Holden or they didn’t know much, after these many years. His concern was with the himatids, they said. A himatid could catch tasty ichthyoids, reap useful sea vines, search for glow-pearls, if you gave it a knife or something like that; but it was stupid. Making clear to it what you wanted was hard work, and possible only for simple tasks. No wonder the forebears had quit catching and training them. Why <emphasis>he </emphasis>cared, well, who knew what goes on in the bellies of you <emphasis>io-hyumanai? </emphasis>Yes, he often ranted against the Gashers. Might he want the carpet whales to multiply freely for eventual harvesting by his own kind? No? Well, doubtless you fathom him. We are content to give him help now and then in exchange for rotproof cloth, rustproof steel, such things ... That was as far as Byrne got before exhaustion overwhelmed her.</p>
   <p>She slept. She made breakfast. She prowled. Murasaki stood about twenty degrees above the western ocean when Holden returned.</p>
   <p>She glimpsed his cruiser through a port. Externally, her preparations were scarcely more than securing her pistol to her hip before she masked and went out. Most were within herself.</p>
   <p>The tide was flowing, the bay rising. It glared steely beneath a cloudless slate-colored sky. Shadows were long in the yellow of the hills, bringing forth their folded and scarred intricacy. Air steamed. As if they sensed something amiss, the Rockridgers had withdrawn from sight. Byrne stood on the path where the hillside bent sharply down­ward, so he would see her from afar. She kept her hands clear of her weapon. As he trudged upward, she saw he wasn’t armed.</p>
   <p>He reached her and stopped. The features inside the helmet were hueless, sunken, a mesh of lines and creases; his eyes laired in dark hollows. Shoulders slumped. His coverall hung stiff with salt.</p>
   <p>Pity smote. “Come inside,” she said gently. “I’ve got a pot of coffee on. Or there’s your whiskey, and I can rustle some food if you like.”</p>
   <p>He nodded. She stepped aside. A slight, crawling cau­tion told her to let him go first.</p>
   <p>They cycled through and removed their headgear. “Sit down,<sup>–</sup> she proposed. He sagged onto a threadbare lounger. She poured the coffee and set it on a table beside him, adding the bottle and a shot glass. He picked up the mug and sipped noisily. She smelled the old sweat on him.</p>
   <p>Standing in front, she asked, “Would you rather sleep first?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, no.” The gray head lifted. A bit of life entered the words.”1 let the cruiser take me back while I bunked down. We should settle what’s between us right away.”</p>
   <p>“As you wish. I’ve entered a report, but under seal unless I don’t call in again. Talk as freely as you want. Be warned, though, I’ll decide what I pass on to headquarters.”</p>
   <p>He nodded. “Fair enough. You’re honest.” Stillness, until: “And maybe you aren’t the officious bungler I sup­posed. To me, headquarters is mostly complaints, demands, and begrudging me my necessities.”</p>
   <p>“Your isolation has cost you your perspective. We have two planets to think about. Three, if you count Earth.”</p>
   <p>“Therefore you wonder whether my work is still worth supporting.” He sighed. “I would need long to ex­plain why. Quite likely I can’t. I’m not a poet.”</p>
   <p>“What you shall have to show,” she told him. is that your work, is important enough to justify murder.”</p>
   <p>His visage went empty. For a moment he seemed help­less. Resolution welled into him. His voice stayed low, but the tone strengthened. “No, you saw me preventing mur­der. Doesn’t the law permit that?</p>
   <p>Memory whetted her reply. “I saw you’d started a ship to the bottom. I saw you shoot a crewbeing who tried to climb aboard your boat.”</p>
   <p>“Self-defense. They would have killed me.”</p>
   <p>“For cause,” she clipped. “What about Ihrdizu that didn’t live’ through the storm and the surf, to get ashore?”</p>
   <p>“They brought it on themselves. You must have seen. They were out to slaughter sapient’ creatures.”</p>
   <p>“Indeed? They surely didn’t think so. What proof have you?”</p>
   <p>A fist knotted on his thigh. Blue veins bulged among white hairs. “Were you an intelligent being as a child,” he grated, “and are you a dumb animal now?”</p>
   <p>“The calves are... controversial.”</p>
   <p>“Because of the language problem. Entirely because of it. Civilized humans on Earth, in the age of discovery, they found other humans who were in the Stone Age, but they could soon talk together. Look at the himatid tools. Think how in the water they can’t have fire, houses—Think how remarkable it is they make as much as they do. If we could talk with them, there’d be no doubt.</p>
   <p>“I can’t teach you what little I’ve learned of their lan­guage. You’d need years of the same experience. I myself, I haven’t gotten much further than the fact that it is a lan­guage, and this is something I know more in my guts than my brain, the way I know how to walk.</p>
   <p>“Byrne, have you never read the linguists, the school of linguists who trace back to Chomslcy? Our ways of per­ceiving and describing the world are hard-wired into us. We were led astray by the accident that the croakers are wired pretty similarly. Maybe the Chupchups are, too; we don’t know yet. But the himatids certainly are not. That’s the barrier between them and us.”</p>
   <p>He was harmless now, save perhaps to himself. Byrne felt the physical alertness unwind in her. A deeper tension took its place. She poured a shot, drew a chair opposite him, and sat down. The whiskey smoked warm across her tongue. Into the haggardness she said: “Maybe. As far as the calves are concerned. Did they want you to go halt the whaling? If so, how did they know about it?”</p>
   <p>Startled, he took a moment to answer, slowly, “They may well not have. There was a ... a feeling that it’d be good if I accompanied Solomon out. More than that I can’t say. Give me another ten Earth years, and maybe I can.”</p>
   <p>Keep him on the defensive. “Your motives for going. then?”</p>
   <p>“Why, to see what Solomon did yonder, and the pod did, and take advantage of any opportunity that might come up.”</p>
   <p>“But you already suspected Gashers were in the vi­cinity,” she flung at him. “You’d have caught word, a rumor, from the Rockridgers. In spite of your threats, you’d never taken action against whalers; they wouldn’t expect you to. That’s why you got rid of me. You thought you might do so. The ship you unloaded me on, its crew con­firmed the rumor.”</p>
   <p>He stared at his feet. “True. I ... preferred no wit­nesses. All I meant to do was escort Solomon, keep it safe till it had joined its fellows, and... and possibly start mak­ing friends at last. But if ‘I had to fire a shot or two for that, well—</p>
   <p>“You were ready to kill sapients—you did, it turned out—for the benefit of what?”</p>
   <p>He looked up, almost bewildered. “Why, other sap­ients. I told you. The carpet whales.”</p>
   <p>“Whose intelligence is even less proven than the calves’. If they’re smart, why don’t they protect themselves against the hunters?”</p>
   <p>“I can’t say for sure. I can guess. Given their size, they aren’t able to go far below the surface. Cross-currents would ripple them out of control, and pressure derange the whole thin body. Also, they can’t swim as fast as a ship can sail with a fair wind. And they’re naive. They’re gentle philosophers who haven’t realized the world is full of pred­ators. The calves know it is, but the adults forget. They have no natural enemies any more, and they have their con­templation to do.”</p>
   <p>“Ha! I thought you despised mysticism.”</p>
   <p>Holden bridled. “I didn’t call them mystics. I said the carpet whales spend their long, peaceful lives thinking. Compared to their’oldest and wisest, those Chupchups that everybody slavers over nowadays are morons or­Aargh!” His mouth contorted.</p>
   <p>“So you believe,” Byrne said. “Can you prove it?”</p>
   <p>The response was bleak as his dwelling. “Of course not. Can you prove to me that you have consciousness? It’s the hypothesis that best fits the facts. Give me a chance to learn more.”</p>
   <p>“What about the hypothesis that the whales gradually lose whatever intelligence they may have had as calves?” There passed through the back of Byrne’s mind: An inter­esting moral question. How human is a brain-decayed <emphasis>Homo sapiens? </emphasis>What rights has he? Why shouldn’t an alert animal have the same?</p>
   <p>The unkempt head shook. “Doesn’t make sense. The whales beget the young. How could the species stay sapient if there weren’t selection for sapience among the breeders? Nature puts no more pressure on them, as big as they are. The selection must be internal to the species, sexual, what­ever. The poets, musicians, storytellers, philosophers get the mates. Look, <emphasis>Australopithecus </emphasis>or <emphasis>Homo erectus </emphasis>on Earth were already pretty successful. They had no serious natural enemies left. What do you suppose pushed their brains onward?”</p>
   <p>She had seen the argument among his reports. She had never before heard it uttered. The force of it rang.</p>
   <p>Yet—“You took the law into your own hands, on the basis of your pet theory,” Byrne said. “Whaling has gone on for centuries. You hated it, but this was the first time you actually did anything about it. Why?” She raised a hand as lips parted in the beard. “Yes, you were escorting Solomon. The Gashers wouldn’t have come near you, would they? They must have known how you felt and what weapons you commanded. There was no threat to Solomon.”</p>
   <p>“There was,” Holden declared. “My fuel was limited. I’d soon have to turn back, unless one or more of the whales stopped to ... have an exchange with me. That would not happen if the rest were being pursued.”</p>
   <p>“Which they often were, when their migration took them by.” Byrne leaned forward. “The only difference this time was that you companioned a single calf, some­thing you might very well do again in the future when conditions were more favorable. How, then—since you have not proved the carpet whales, or even the calves, are sapient,”—have <emphasis>souls? </emphasis>gibed a childhood half-memory­“how do you justify attacking those poor sailors?”</p>
   <p>He rose. His shadow fell huge between her and the light. The gray mane was a cloud around a half-seen face. “Joseph,” he said.</p>
   <p>She must needs also rise. They stood confronted. “Joseph?”</p>
   <p>“What I called it in its calfhood. A distinctive mark­ing on the back identifies it. Solomon led me straight there. Scent? Suddenly, here were two of them I knew. And Joseph remembered. It curled its front end over my deck and made the old music we’d worked out together. I had my opening, my foothold I’d always hoped for. But yonder came the Gasher ships and commenced their butchery.</p>
   <p>“I had to stop it. Fuel wouldn’t let me follow the second ship far, but the crew wouldn’t know that. I lay out till the pod must be well past their fjord. With luck, the hunters will accept that this stretch of coast is interdicted to them; and Solomon and Joseph and I can meet again. Otherwise I’ll do whatever is necessary, <emphasis>as </emphasis>often as nec­essary, till the sanctuary is established. If your damned smug politicians and bureaucrats will allow.”</p>
   <p>Byrne’s throat tightened until she could barely get out, “That, for the sake of research?”</p>
   <p>“For the sake of humanity,” he growled.</p>
   <p>She blinked. “What?”</p>
   <p>A rusty clang of defiance: “Or philosophy, or the next stage of civilization, or whatever you choose to call it. Grandiose? Well, ask yourself what kind of megalo­maniac it would take to seriously claim our species is in no need of improvement. But for that we’ll have to un­derstand ourselves, and we never will till we can get out­side ourselves.</p>
   <p>“What are we, besides animals? Our language. Sym­bols, arts, sciences, hopes, fears, everything that makes us human is in language. And it isn’t a set of arbitrary con­ventions. The basis of it is biological.</p>
   <p>“Gliders theorem. Nothing can completely describe or account for itself. We can’t reason about the basis of language except in a metalanguage. For that, we’ve first got to compare at least one other language totally different from ours, different right down in the genes, and see what our own built-in premises are. Between us and the himatids—”</p>
   <p>Holden’s fist struck the table. The sound went small through stillness. “Oh, hell,” he said. She heard how he could no longer fight off the weariness. “Let my advocate make the fine speeches in court.” Seeking her eyes: “But could we spend a while together before then, you and me, while I try to show you what I mean? Maybe you’ll put in a good word afterward. Maybe they’ll let me continue here. Or else somebody new.”</p>
   <p>For a space she heard only, remotely, the wind and the sea. At last he muttered, “You look puzzled. Well, I guess I didn’t make myself clear.”</p>
   <p>Byrne shook herself. The chill that had gathered while he talked still stirred beneath her skin. It wasn’t from fear or shock or even pity. She had felt it before, a few times, when a bugle blew at sunset in memoriam, when under­standing of the cosmological equation opened up to her, when “No, I think I followed you,” she breathed. “And yes, I think I will argue for... for leniency. You did wrong today, but your cause is... tremendous.”</p>
   <p>The dulled voice and drained countenance became ear­nest. “Do you really see, already?” he asked. “You agree I couldn’t abandon it?”</p>
   <p>The deaths came back to crowd the future out of her. <emphasis>“We </emphasis>can’t,” she corrected him. “We humans, that is. You were too impatient. We’ve got generations ahead of us to pursue this.”</p>
   <p>“You won’t, unless I nail your attention fast to it,” he replied. “And I will, whatever the cost.”</p>
   <p>She wondered how sane he in truth was. She wondered what sanity was.</p>
   <p>He went to the computer on the desk. A big, knuckly hand worked its keyboard. Byrne saw just his back, like a stooping darkness. He accessed a visual. The woman had been plain, middle-aged, but she kept a young smile.</p>
   <p>“This was her idea,” Holden said. “What she lived for.”</p>
   <p>He switched off, turned around, and spoke curtly of practical matters.</p>
