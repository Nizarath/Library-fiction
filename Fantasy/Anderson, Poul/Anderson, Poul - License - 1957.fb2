   <p><emphasis>The fertile mind of Poul Anderson keeps spawning worlds—worlds of scientific development, worlds of alien life, alternate worlds of If-history, worlds of fantasy and magic—each of them self-consistent and logically developed. The strange world which he creates this time for our pleasure is a sociological world of If-This-Goes-On, in which organized crime has swallowed up the organizations of labor and business, and in which a toughly idealistic young man may be a professional gangster with the highest ethical motives. . . </emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>I LANDED AT WOLD-CHAMBERLAIN, ON the edge of Twincity. It was mid­afternoon, but the air was mild— the summer here doesn’t really get started till about July, and this was early June. There were the usual taxis waiting for rocket passengers, just inside the crimeless area. I walked down the line till I found one whose polished armor and obviously well-oiled gun turret indicated a driver who knew his business. He jumped to open the door for me: I was wearing my union badge, and we’re all supposed to be good tippers.</p>
   <p>“YMCA,” I said, entering. In the summers I usually lived at the Y; it’s nothing fancy, but it’s cheap and clean and there are some pretty decent guys around. Most important, you’re safe inside.</p>
   <p>My cab nosed onto the fourth-level freeway and went on automatic. The driver leaned back and struck a cigaret. “Working?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“Not yet,” I said.</p>
   <p>“You will be,” he predicted. “It’s been a lively year so far.” He jerked his thumb at the framed bootlegging and procurement licenses. “Business is good, you know. I wonder how come the crime rate jumps in boom times and drops in bad times. Sh’d think it’d be the other way around.”</p>
   <p>“There are psychological reasons,” I told him. “You can explain part of it by pointing to all the money floating about—hectic atmosphere and so forth, high living, eat, drink, and be merry. In a slump, you think about eating.”</p>
   <p>“You don’t talk like a gangster,” he said.</p>
   <p>“I’m only one in summer,” I admitted. “The rest of the year I’m working for my Phd. at Harvard. Got to pay my expenses somehow.”</p>
   <p>He grew less friendly, associating me with college kids, I suppose. I didn’t bother explaining that my panty-raiding days were long past and that graduate students are still expected to earn their degree. It had been fun once, but I think maturity consists largely in a shift of the pleasure principle: to me, at the ripe old age of 24, there was delight in a psycho­dynamic equation and merely boredom in the thought of breaking down doors and toting a squealing coed into the bushes.</p>
   <p>We passed a new school, steel and chrome and plastic leaping 80 stories into the sky, and I noticed a gym class having some machine- gun practice on the playground. The range was pathetically over­crowded—where the hell are they going to put all the new children?</p>
   <p>“Y’oughta be here in fall,” said the driver, “We got a great team this year.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t care much for football, to tell the truth,” I replied. “I see enough bloodshed without paying to watch somebody’s face messed up with spiked knuckledusters.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, the Big Ten are using goggles now—no more blindings. Though there’s talk of legalizing switchblades. Here we are, doc.”</p>
   <p>I got out on the ramp. The meter showed $250, which was not unreasonable, but I disliked adding the 25% tip expected of me. People think a gangster sleeps on money mattresses; well, he does get fat fees, but it’s sporadic work and he has heavy expenses too.</p>
   <p>After I had been frisked and had checked my weapons—I told you the Y is safe—I went over to the desk. Joe Green was there and said hello. “How’s things back east?” he added.</p>
   <p>“As usual,” I said.</p>
   <p>“How about that airport bombing?”</p>
   <p>“You know I only hold a job summers. I hear the unions and the cops between them got the bastards in a few days, but it was no affair of mine.” I said that because I didn’t care to make conversation; actually, I had been as outraged as anyone else. Unlicensed murder, and illegal weapons such as bombs —in this case, there were twenty innocent casualties—are an offense to all the rules of human behavior. Without law, we might as well go back to the caves.</p>
   <p>“What kind of place you want?” asked Green. “We’ve added a new wing: some nice three-room—”</p>
   <p>“I’m trying to save money. Single with bath will do.”</p>
   <p>“OK. 2773, then. Want a girl?”</p>
   <p>“Not just yet, thanks. I want to take off my shoes and relax. When you get off duty, maybe we can go out for dinner and stuff.”</p>
   <p>I picked up a fifth at the news­stand and looked for a book, but there was nothing worth reading. I don’t care about their covers, but these impurgated editions annoy me; nobody has a right to put clinical descriptions into <emphasis>Romeo and Juliet</emphasis> or provide Captain Ahab with a mistress. Oh, well.</p>
   <p>I took the elevator up, entered my place, and checked the meters. Local water ration was 30 gallons a day: Minnesota still has plenty. After the grimy east, it was going to be good to bathe daily. While the tub was filling, I took my fifth over for a look out the window. The downtown area is new and spectacular, from the austere lines of the Retailers’ Union skyscraper to the humorous fantasy of the Hamm’s Building, shaped like a beer bottle. But I was high enough to see the gray miles of housing projects reaching beyond the horizon. They had expanded since last year, and I could understand why the cab driver had said this was a lively time. Unless we psychodyna- micists come up with an answer, the curve of liveliness is going to keep on rising.</p>
   <p>I didn’t call union HQ till I was cleaned up. The face in the screen was unfamiliar. “Hello, brother,” I said. “Charles Andrew Rheinbogen checking in.”</p>
   <p>“Hello, brother Rheinbogen,” he nodded. “You’re playing in luck. All the boys out, and a large job just come.”</p>
   <p>I sighed, having hoped for at least a day’s relaxation. But you don’t turn down an offer. “OK, I’ll be right along. But what happened to Sam?”</p>
   <p>“Oh . . . brother Jeffreys, you mean? He got his a week ago.”</p>
   <p>“Hey, he was too old for anything but switchboard work.”</p>
   <p>“This was a private murder. Somebody cooled him for personal reasons.”</p>
   <p>“Damn! I liked him. Anything we can do about it?”</p>
   <p>“ ’Fraid not. Advance notification of intent was filed, the deed’s been registered and the weregild will be paid on schedule.”</p>
   <p>Well, he’d had a full life, and the union would look after his family. But I was going to miss Sam. He had lived through the Smash-up as a young man and, unlike most, always been willing to talk about it. Some of his stories would curdle your plasma, but he had kept his sense of humor too.</p>
   <p>I slipped on clean pajamas and shoes and went downstairs. In the lobby I bought a foodbar to keep going on; benzedrine I always carry. After getting my guns back I took the slideway over to HQ on third-level Nicollet. The new operator had not lied about a big job; I was shown into the executive secretary’s office at once.</p>
   <p>Tom Swanson is a very high-class labor chief, managing not only the local and its benefit funds, but also its banks, stores, factories, and other business. He hasn’t much formal education, but he looks like a middle-aged professor; that’s due to plastic surgery, when he decided a mild, scholarly face was disarming and therefore useful. He shook hands with me and introduced me to the client: “Mr. James Hardy, this is Mr. Rheinbogen—one of our best.”</p>
   <p>“Urn,” grunted Hardy, “Rather young, ain’t he?”</p>
   <p>I do have the misfortune—which will be an asset in about twenty years, if I live—to look like a slender blond sophomore. Maybe that was why I took a dislike to this customer. Or maybe it was his broad, carefully barbered and massaged face, or the overly elaborate hairdo. He made me think of a shark at some Friendly Loan Company where they make you put up your wife’s services for a year to borrow a thousand. A bit of investigation next day was to confirm my hunch. However, a job is a job, so I merely sat down and waited,</p>
   <p>“Suppose you explain the situation yourself, Mr, Hardy,” suggested Swanson.</p>
   <p>“Well . . . all right. If you guarantee this boy—”</p>
   <p>“The union guarantees nothing except an honest effort to fulfill the mission,” said Swanson gently. “If we lose our men on it, you’ll need a fresh contract to try again,”</p>
   <p>“Unless,” I said nastily, “you want to try for yourself.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t give me that,” snorted Hardy, “I’m a businessman—vice-chairman of the board, Teamsters’ Union, Inc. I don’t do my own kidnapings any more than I do my own cooking in one bf our restaurants.” It was a proper come­uppance for me, but I didn’t enjoy his tone—arrogance ought to be more courteous, a principle they understood back in the Renaissance.</p>
   <p>“So it’s to be a snatch,” I said<sub>: </sub>“The season ... no, wait, kidnaping season did open yesterday, didn’t it? OK, who’s the goat?”</p>
   <p>“A Miss Marie Dulac,” he answered. “You’ve heard of the Dulac family—head of the chemicals union trust. They have a summer home out at Lake Minnetonka and are there now.”</p>
   <p>I suppressed an impulse to whistle—yanking a girl from the house of her trillionaire father! But there must be a chance of doing it, or Swanson wouldn’t have me here. “Seems I’ve heard of the wench,” I said. “But we can’t lift her; she’s a minor.”</p>
   <p>“Turned twenty-one last month,” said Swanson. “I checked the public records myself. She hasn’t taken out first-class citizenship, so she’s immune to murder, beating, or criminal assault; but anything else goes.”</p>
   <p>“How come you want her?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“Business reasons,” said Hardy.</p>
   <p>“I have to know why,” I explained. “I'll need the whole picture. Professional confidence applies, of course.”</p>
   <p>“All right,” grumbled Hardy. “A simple matter of pressure on her old man. Both our unions are trying to merge with the Federated Nuclear Scientists, If I hold his daughter, he’ll back out and let me have them.”</p>
   <p>That was a very big picture indeed, and I felt more and more cold as I realized how well that house must be guarded. “Any details on the girl herself?” I queried.</p>
   <p>“Not too much,” said Swanson. “I can’t say how she’ll react, Charlie, so you’d better handle with care and this side up. The Dulacs are French Canadian, her mother died years ago, and she’s been raised in a convent way to hell-and-gone in Quebec. Only sprung last month, and her debut is going to be pretty soon.”</p>
   <p>Good. The confusion of preparing an orgy would help me. But old Frederic Dulac hadn’t gotten where he was without some hard and shrewd fighting. He was known to be a fair, even gentle boss, but when his goons had to shoot they only intended to shoot once.</p>
   <p>Hardy produced the license, and I scanned it carefully to make sure everything was in order. It certified that on payment of the usual (high) fees and filing of the usual notice of intent, he was hereby authorized to kidnap Marie Tamara Dulac within a period of not more than six weeks from date and to hold said person for a period of not more than one year from date, and was further authorized to use such force as necessary and legal on condition of paying the proper were-gild for all damage done . . . etc., etc., etc. They had changed the form since I last saw one; there was now a boldface notice that breach of the regulations governing any capital-crime license meant full outlawry—anyone could kill you without penalty, and if the cops didn’t get you first the gangsters would for the sake of their own good name.</p>
   <p>Hardy had already made a contract with our local. Now he signed the license over to me and I was committed. The fee, I knew, would be terrific, but I wondered what use money is to a dead man,</p>
   <p>“You have my card,” said Hardy, “You can deliver her to my New Chicago office.”</p>
   <p>“Nothing doing,” said Swanson. “We’ll keep her.”</p>
   <p>“What? But—”</p>
   <p>“If you haven’t read the union code, Mr, Hardy, it’s your own fault. In a case like this, we retain the victim to make sure no harm comes to her. Otherwise we’d occasionally find ourselves accessories to something illegal—torture or white slavery, say.”</p>
   <p>I was pleased to see Hardy looking apoplectic. It was going to inconvenience him: old Dulac might just be tough enough to wait a year till we had to release his girl. No— it would depend on how tough she was; if her father <emphasis>knew</emphasis> she could stand a year’s comfortable arrest . . .</p>
   <p>We got rid of our client after a while and settled down for a drink, smoke, and talk. Everybody knew that Dulac employed the American Freebooters’ Labor union. It’s practically a mirror image of our own Criminal Industries Organization. I’ve bought drinks for many of their boys off duty, and some people wonder why the crooks don’t merge. But then attack-defense- riposte would become impossible; you wouldn’t fight your own brothers, would you? Dulac had to have his chance to guard or recover his daughter. Competition is the life­blood of American free enterprise.</p>
   <p>A job like this takes information, planning, and rehearsal, and the plan must be imaginative. Some locals rely on games theory computers, but there’s still no good substitute for the skilled human brain. A machine can’t <emphasis>enjoy</emphasis> thinking.</p>
   <p>A week later we had our scheme fairly well rigged. Axel Nygard and I made reservations at a lake­side hotel and drove down; the rest of our boys had been trickling into the area for days, under various names and faces. We ourselves didn’t bother with surgery, because Intelligence had told us the Dulac goons rarely went scouting. The old man relied on his fortress-like estate, where you didn’t get in without a retinal scan and a frisking. Just to add to his confidence, we’d sent a squad that made a deliberately bungled attempt on his home. No casualties except some flesh wounds on our side: if I had been in charge of Dulac’s defenses, that would have made me suspicious, but Swanson said his chief goon had an honest, straightforward mind. Both of them were prominent Rotarians, so he ought to know.</p>
   <p>It was a pleasant drive once we got past the housing projects. Nygard is a big, burly chap, but he shuddered a trifle as we zoomed through. The tenements rose up on either side of the freeway, they seemed to have faces in every window, and the pedestrian levels below us were like a disturbed anthill.</p>
   <p>“Christ!” he muttered. “Can people really live like this?”</p>
   <p>“Sure, they’re doing it,” I told him. “They’ve got to. Isn’t much space left in the world. They’re still eating, at least, and there are amusements provided.”</p>
   <p>“But the crowding—how many people to a room?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, not more than three or four. It’s normal for them; they don’t know anything else. I grew up in a housing project myself, and it really isn’t so bad. Of course, my father had a very good job—technician in a rocket factory: for twenty hours a week he was alone in a big roomy building with only a dozen other men. So he was a peaceful sort, didn’t even take out a crime license. Our neighbors were the usual working stiffs, and beguiled their leisure by robbing each other. Nice people—ever since then, I’ve wanted to do something constructive for them and their kind.”</p>
   <p>“It sounds like perpetual motion,” said Nygard suspiciously. He was new to gangster work. “Bill robs Joe who robs Pete who robs Bill . . . but dammit, money represents material goods and services. Transferring it that way is just lost energy.”</p>
   <p>We went by a protein factory, processing the algae from Lake Superior. “Not so,” I said. “Work in places like that keeps the belly satisfied. But what makes you a man, instead of another machine, is what you do off duty. The Chinese failed to make the adjustment to the present phase of history, overpopulation <emphasis>cum</emphasis> technics, and are huddled up like hogs in a pen. The Russians spend all their time bickering between a hundred religious cults. The South Africans march around with their rifles, knowing the Peace Authority won’t let them go beyond their own borders and taking it out on any white person they happen to find.” At a distance I glimpsed a man talking to a woman —an obvious hetaera—on an upper-level ramp, while a boy picked his pocket. All three were smiling. “I think we’ve got it better.”</p>
   <p>We got out of the city and had only a short drive to Minnetonka. It’s a fair-sized lake, and by piping their water from elsewhere they’ve kept it that way. That’s expensive and so are the several acres of trees and the fish they keep the lake stocked with; so it’s a high-priced resort, the banks lined solid with hotels and summer cottages and fun houses. Coming in to Dirty Joe’s Lodge, we passed the Dulac estate: a fabulous five acres between high walls, the house underground except for a sundeck. Little more than that was known about it, but Dulac had filed intent to shoot down any aircraft besides police or Peace Authority that went over his place, so he must have added guided missiles to his other defenses.</p>
   <p>Dirty Joe’s was about a mile further down the lake. We turned our car and a $500 tip over to the uniformed attendant and strolled into the lobby to register. The lodge lives up to its name with a back-woods, logging-camp atmosphere —plastic knottypine paneling, only one casino, the girls in the bar putting on their clothes to the accompaniment of folk ballads, and so forth. We were posing as young executives from the politician’s union —my studies make me talk like one, and Nygard was taciturn. The bell­hop showed us to a 20th-floor room and asked if we wanted girls right away. “Later,” I said, testing the taps. The scotch faucet yielded a brand about as good as one can expect since the last of the great distilleries was wrecked in those clan feuds.</p>
   <p>“Swanson won’t like what the local fillies are gonna do to the expense account,” said Nygard when we were alone.</p>
   <p>“Well, we have to maintain our character for a day or two while we case the joint,” I laughed.</p>
   <p>Which we did and had a fine time in the process. There was an undercurrent of tension, naturally, a watchfulness and an awareness that in a short while we might be just another three hundred pounds of material for the fertilizer plants. But once you get used to it, once your apprenticeship has scrubbed off nervousness and youth, you are seldom so much alive as when preparing a job. When I got my doctorate, I was going to hang up my guns—another phase of life out­grown—but I’d not be sorry I had worn them.</p>
   <p>The rest of our band was else­where in the area; we saw them from time to time and exchanged a few quiet signals. It was on a Wednesday morning that I set the machine going with a single call,</p>
   <p>As we’d been doing, Nygard and I hired a boat to go out on the lake fishing. We had seen that Marie Dulac went for a swim each day before noon. There were guards in her craft and another boatful next to it, and they never went far from their private beach—nor did they allow anyone else within a hundred feet. The old man was careful, all right; but it seemed unfair to pit artists against him.</p>
   <p>The lake was as crowded as usual with boats, their wakes creaming its carefully blued waters, and with swimmers. Overhead there was always the maximum permissible number of rented copters. Today, I knew, one of them was ours—that had taken substantial bribes to arrange—and not at all what it seemed to be.</p>
   <p>Nygard and I steered to within fifty yards of the Dulac party and let our motor idle. Marie stood up in the bow of her vessel and peeled off her clothes. She was a tall slim girl with a vivid, tilted face, merry dark eyes, blue-black hair falling below her ears—from afar, I had seen her laughing and decided I liked her. She hit the water in a clean dive and came up whooping, happy just to exist.</p>
   <p>“Now?” asked Nygard.</p>
   <p>I took a small swallow of whisky, a good relaxer, and nodded. “Have fun,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Same to you.” I was already stripped, and went over the side. We were trailing a net full of cold beer, but there was an additional package in it. Working fast under­water, I got out the aqua equipment, adjusted it to my face, and breathed gratefully. Then I strapped the tank on my shoulders, slipped the paddles on my feet, and buckled a two-gun belt around my waist: a .30 automatic and a sonic stunner. We had to assume nobody would notice I didn’t come up again after my dive,</p>
   <p>I swam easily, untensed, not allowing myself to think the job might go sour. The water was clear, I could see the boats wavering against sun-dazzle above me. Another aquaman glided by, nodding to me. I felt a pulsing as Nygard steered away. His task was to divert attention by having a minor crackup with some other vessel. Then he was to head for the timber before Dulac’s men started serious investigations; they would not be gentle if they caught him or any of us.</p>
   <p>Now! I saw the two craft, like whales basking. The splintered sunlight made a roof immediately overhead, I slipped upward, a few feet below the surface. Through the water I felt as much as heard the blunt shock of Nygard’s colli­sion. There would be angry voices raised for a minute, until urbanity returned with the recollection that a man can always take out a shooting license, and people would be watching—</p>
   <p>She trod water, head and shoulders invisible to me, the rest graceful and faintly unreal. I drew my stunner and pulled her down with my free hand. She got a shock dose good for about half an hour and I let the gun sink, having too much else to do. My hands closed off her mouth and nose to keep water out—the metabolism is lowered by sonic so you can go several minutes without breathing—and my feet kicked us toward the middle of the lake.</p>
   <p>With luck, I’d have done it quietly enough so that her disappearance wouldn’t be observed for several seconds. Without luck . . . but it was pointless to think about that. I worked my legs hard, trying to keep all muscles not concerned at ease, trying to keep my mind calm. The girl’s body was cooling fast in my arms, I could feel the chill creep through it, her eyes were open and blank. She wasn’t hurt, but I felt guilty, somehow. I told myself that this was the price you paid for being wealthy and having five landscaped acres to roam about in, but she looked pathetically young and murdered.</p>
   <p>Here—I stuck my head out of the water, keeping Marie below, and looked around. There was an uproar a hundred yards back, the Duke boats circling with engines ahowl, goons threshing the lake and cursing, people spilling out of the housegates. The boys in our copter had been watching through binoculars and saw me emerge. They swooped low, churning die water with the airwash, and snaked down a rope. I raised Marie’s head into the air, transferred one hand to the cord, and hung on.</p>
   <p>A winch pulled me up as the copter mounted skyward. I swung like a bellclapper, seeing brief crazy images below me, gaping faces, a guard shaking his fist but not daring to shoot, I heard a siren begin its clamor, then I was drawn up with my cargo and the hatch clanged shut behind me.</p>
   <p>That was a special copter. It shed its rotors and a false rear end the moment I was aboard. I hoped they wouldn’t do any damage as they fell; it would be a proud record for me if I could pull an important job without having to pay any claims. Our concealed jet- pipe was now free and acceleration tugged at me as we got going.</p>
   <p>There were two men here, a pilot and a doctor. The latter bent over Marie and started artificial respiration in case she’d swallowed the lake after all. I shed my aqua stuff, jumped into the gun turret, and peered back. Two copters were lumbering up from the Dulac estate, but now that we were a jet we could show them our heels. What we had to do was shake any radar there might be, then streak for the hideout where Marie was to be kept.</p>
   <p>“Nice job.” The doctor poked his head into my turret as Minnetonka vanished. “Very neat. I’ve given her a reviver shot and put some clothes on her. She’s fine.”</p>
   <p>I shivered. “I could use some clothes and a shot too,” I said, “though maybe not the same kind of shot.”</p>
   <p>He took the gun while I obtained the necessary. Marie was strapped into a bunk. She was wearing a coverall which gave her an even younger look, like somebody’s kid sister. There was a touch of color in her cheeks and I could see her breathe.</p>
   <p>“We’re going to stop outside Duluth and transfer to another plane,” said the doctor as I resumed my post. “Three gets you five old Dulac has a description and a reward offer broadcast inside half an hour.”</p>
   <p>“Better not make such odds if you don’t have a crooked-gambling license,” I grinned.</p>
   <p>We were flying illegally low to avoid radar, though of course we had a temporary permit to break traffic rules. Now and then a tree or a building whisked past us. I relaxed, feeling the alcohol glow within me, and fumbled out a smoke.</p>
   <p>When I looked through the bubble again, I nearly swallowed the cigaret. There was a regular jet after us, a Delta-wing job with the Dulac colors. “Judas priest!” I yelped. “What happened?”</p>
   <p>Our pilot cursed and opened up his engine. That buggy could fly rings around us. But where did it come from? There wasn’t a run­way long enough for it in—</p>
   <p>It neared, I could hear it whistle down the sky, and I made out a hook attachment. The old man had been more careful than we realized; there’d been a mother ship up in the stratosphere above his place, piggybacking this one.</p>
   <p>Our communicator beeped and the pilot switched it on. I couldn’t see the screen from where I was, but the voice came clearly: “You there in that phony! Land or I open fire!”</p>
   <p>“Oh . . . it’s you, Bob,” said my pilot. “How’s every little thing?”</p>
   <p>“Pretty good, Jack.” I gathered our opponent was an off-duty friend of his from the other union, in Dulac’s pay. “Damn nice try you made there, but not quite nice enough. Land and turn over the girl, and we’ll call it quits; I’d hate to make Martha a widow.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, I’m not married to her right now,” said my pilot. He was being pleasant, stalling for time as we whined northward at 500 per. I knew he must be operating the call button for all he was worth and HQ would be aware of our plight. But it would take time for our interceptors to scramble at Twincity and get here.</p>
   <p>The jet walked around us and gave us a burst through the roof. I fired back without hitting anything. “Just a warning, Jack,” said the radioed voice.</p>
   <p>“Crack us up, and the girl goes too,” warned my pilot. “It’d be a shame to hurt her, and I don’t think her old man would appreciate your zeal.”</p>
   <p>“I always liked to take chances,” said Bob, “I think I got a way to force you down. But it’s dangerous.”</p>
   <p>“Go ahead and try, then,” said my pilot. “I’m a poor man and I need my success bonus.”</p>
   <p>The jet snarled around in a bone­cracking loop and came at us from the rear. I saw the tracer stream hosing from it, reaching for our control surfaces. It had to pull up in a few seconds, crossing over us, and I gave it a burst in the belly as it passed. My stomach muscles were knotted tight, and I breathed deep and told them to relax. The jet came back for another try. That one chewed up our tail-pipe a little, we lost speed and began to wobble in the air.</p>
   <p>“The guy’s good,” said the doctor. “Maybe you better call it a day, Jack.”</p>
   <p>“You’re the boss, Chuck,” said the pilot to me.</p>
   <p>I looked out, considering. We were on the fringe of the roadless area that reaches north of Lake Superior into Canada; we’d been flying longer than I realized. Most of it is second growth now, having burned off during the Smashup when people were too busy staying alive to fight forest fires, but it’s still one of the biggest parks left on this continent.</p>
   <p>The other man could disable us and force a landing, just as he claimed; thereafter, unless our re­inforcements arrived before Dulac’s—which was improbable—we’d have to give up, since it would be illegal to use Marie for a shield. Prolonged resistance endangered everyone’s life to no obvious purpose, and there was no disgrace to surrendering before these odds. On the other hand, the success bonus would put me through a good many months of school, and success itself under difficult conditions would raise the fees I could charge. I am no altruist—I want to be well-to-do, see my family grow up with room to breathe—but perhaps I also thought of funds for the psychody­namic research this poor crazy torn-up world so badly needs.</p>
   <p>“If you two are willing,” I said, “I have an idea.” Conversation was delayed while the jet made another pass at us. That time I was lucky and ripped up his rudder; he was still a tiger compared to us, but handled awkwardly now.</p>
   <p>“I thought of doing our snatch in reverse,” I said. “Skim each of these lakes as we go by. Pretty good tactics anyhow: at his speed, he’ll have to pull up sharp if he doesn’t want a dunk in the drink. On one of those skims, I’ll bail out with the girl. You lead him on for a while, then land if you want to. You’ll have nothing to conceal, and our planes’ll be along before he or his buddies can get rough with you. Nobody’s going to dogfight over an object of search which has disappeared.”</p>
   <p>“And how about you, Chuck?” asked the doctor, looking worried.</p>
   <p>“Lots of hotels around here,” I said. “If you play it right, the Dulac gang will think we already transferred the kid somehow and were just decoying them; I shouldn’t be molested. I can hoof it to one of the hotels and call HQ to send a plane after us.”</p>
   <p>“It sounds kind of impossible.”</p>
   <p>“A man might try,” I said. "Take the gun.”</p>
   <p>I went down into the body and stuffed my pockets with foodbars. Boots for me and the girl I hung around my neck. She was warm again to the touch, breathing slowly and easily. I unstrapped her and dragged her over to the hatch and squatted there with her in my arms. Every time we swooped or swerved, she was flung against me, which was not at all unpleasant. Even when a line of holes was stitched across the wall, I rather enjoyed myself.</p>
   <p>Choosing the third downward rush at random, I eased the hatch open. The water looked cold and brown; I thought it was filthy till I realized nobody had put bluing in it. A chill shriek of air buffeted up at us. Marie stirred and mumbled, her eyelids fluttering.</p>
   <p>When we were a yard above the lake, I stepped out.</p>
   <p>We went under like a dropped stone. I clawed my way back to the surface and raised Marie’s head. She began to squirm as consciousness returned. I shook the water from my eyes and stared out over the lake. It seemed horribly desolate, rimmed in with pine and spruce, no trace of man except the two planes vanishing over the treetops. We’d been dropped close to shore and not seen: the op­posing pilot had enough to think about, maneuvering his lame ship and crippling ours without killing our prisoner.</p>
   <p>A few strokes brought the muddy bottom under my feet. I waded to shore and dropped Marie Dulac on a dense brown carpet of needles. She choked, sputtered, and sat up.</p>
   <p>“Here,” I said, extracting a pocket flask.</p>
   <p>She took it, shakily, and got down a gulp. Her eyes widened, and she was white and shivering, but I liked the fact that she didn’t scream.</p>
   <p>“Better get those wet clothes off,” I suggested. “They’ll dry pretty fast with this breeze, but you might catch cold from it.”</p>
   <p>“I’ve been immunized,” she said in a small hard voice. She sat for a while looking across the choppy dark bareness of the lake. “Where are we?”</p>
   <p>I shrugged. “Somewhere in the Arrowhead.”</p>
   <p>“I’ve been kidnaped, yes?” She had a faint, charming hint of Canuck accent.</p>
   <p>I bowed. “Charles Rheinbogen, at your service, miss. Now if you’ll excuse me—” I slipped off my garments. After a moment she did the same thing. Even at close range and without cosmetics, she was good-looking.</p>
   <p>“Do you have a cigaret?” she asked.</p>
   <p>“Mmmm . . . we’re not supposed to smoke here, you know; it’s summer and these trees haven’t been fireproofed.”</p>
   <p>“Please. I’ll be careful.”</p>
   <p>Swanson was always harping on the need for courtesy, among other professional standards. “Very well,” I smiled, and groped in my jacket where it lay. She moved closer. Her hand shot out and yanked my gun from its holster, I caught the movement in time to snatch it away from her. Her features blazed at me. I laughed, put the weapon aside, and got out the cigarets. “Still want that smoke?” I queried.</p>
   <p>“Y . , . y-yes.” I struck it for her and she inhaled raggedly and coughed. She had probably just been introduced to the vice. Holy Hermes, patron of thieves, she must still be a virgin!</p>
   <p>“Look, Miss Dulac,” I said, “you have nothing to fear. You’re under the protection of the law and of my union, All we’re going to do is keep you for a while in a certain place with an adequate staff and all facilities. I’m sorry to put you to this indignity, but there was no choice.” I told her how the job had been carried out, “And I wouldn’t advise your trying to escape,” I finished. “It would be more trouble for you to do so than it would be for me to find you again. As far as that goes, if you haven’t had a good deal of practice, a pistol is an awkward weapon and you’d be lucky to hit a whale broadside on.”</p>
   <p>She sat thinking for a while, her cheeks flushed and her dark head bent down. Somewhere a bird began chirping. There were big puffy clouds over us, the sun walking between them.</p>
   <p>“Why have you done this?” she asked finally.</p>
   <p>“Nothing personal about it, I was hired.”</p>
   <p>“By whom?”</p>
   <p>“I can’t tell you that. Professional ethics.”</p>
   <p>“Ethics!” she spat. Her eyes lifted and challenged me.</p>
   <p>“Certainly. And be glad we have them, too. Otherwise anything could happen to you. As it is—”</p>
   <p>“I know!” She stood up and looked at me as if I’d crawled from beneath some abandoned garbage grinder. “It’s ethical to knock me out, and humiliate me, and endanger my life. It’s ethical to let my father worry himself sick—<emphasis>ugh!"</emphasis></p>
   <p>I said in my best persuasive tone: “Back in the old days, before the Smashup and the reconstruction, there were people who used to kidnap rich men’s children— minors, even babies—for ransom. But being amateurs, they often panicked and murdered the victim. Now . . . well, if you and your father can both stand your being detained for less than a year, you’ll go free, unharmed, and he won’t have to yield a thing.”</p>
   <p>She looked thoughtful. “May I write him?” she asked.</p>
   <p>I was surprised. She actually, automatically talked of writing a letter instead of making a call. That convent must be a pretty old-fashioned sort of school; I’ll bet it even insisted all the kids learn to spell the same way. “Sorry, no,” I answered.</p>
   <p>“But you don’t understand. I’ve hardly seen him, except on holidays, till last month. He’ll be ill with worry . . . about how I take this ... if I could write and let him know I can stand it without mental damage—”</p>
   <p>“Exactly,” I said. “There’d be no point in snatching you if it didn’t bring pressure to bear on him. After all—”</p>
   <p>“Oh, be still!” she snarled, and turned her back.</p>
   <p>I hunkered on the soft brown needles and squinted across the lake and tried to figure her. She wasn’t reacting like others I’d heisted. Women, especially—either hysterical or “Goodness gracious, how thrilling!” Marie was concerned about her father and just plain boiling-over mad about herself.</p>
   <p>After a while the neolon was dry, and we resumed our clothes and chewed a couple of foodbars. It was an effort for me to follow her casual example and drink from the lake . . . sure, un­polluted, but <emphasis>untreated</emphasis>. I had a queasy feeling afterward. The water tasted wild.</p>
   <p>“Well,” she said scornfully, “now what?”</p>
   <p>“I guess we strike out till we find a hotel or ranger station,” I decided. “We’ll head due north by the sun. Bound to find something.” As a bold bad bandit, I seemed to be cutting a rather lame figure.</p>
   <p>She nodded and we started walking. The trees were high and grave about us; the forest floor, springy and open, muffled our boots; sunlight was spattered through the branches. Once I saw a live squirrel scoot up a tree. I nudged Marie and pointed it out. She nodded again, frigidly.</p>
   <p>To hell with her.</p>
   <p>The sun finally sank, molten gold behind the woods. There was a wind that snickered in the pines. “Don’t tell me well have to sleep out,” I groaned.</p>
   <p>“It seems that way.” Did I catch a bare overtone of gloat ?</p>
   <p>Our majestic trees began to look like black misshapen witches, much too tall and thin. “Perhaps I made a mistake,” I said. “We could have waited where we were. My own people would probably have backtracked, looking for us, after they’d gotten rid of yours.”</p>
   <p>A smile curved her lips. “I thought of that,” she said.</p>
   <p>“Then for God’s sake why didn’t you tell me?”</p>
   <p>“You’re in charge, aren’t you?” I have never heard so demure a voice.</p>
   <p>Despite tire law, I wanted to build a fire for the night. I’d have been glad to attract a ranger and pay the fine; at the very least, there would have been warmth. After some futile fumbling with green twigs, it was getting so dark that I had to quit. Marie had put her time to better use, cutting off slender spruce boughs with my pocketknife and making herself a bed. Now she stretched out on it, a blur in the dusk.</p>
   <p>“Hadn’t you better put that heap on top of you?” I asked. “It’s going to be cold.”</p>
   <p>“If you have only one cover, sleeping out, it works best beneath you. I have often been camping. You will learn.”</p>
   <p>“Hm,” I said. “Frankly, I thought you’d spent all your time in the chilly cloisters.”</p>
   <p>She fairly threw at me: “It was like old days up there—a little village, honorable men who lived off the land, a few people who really cared to know things and knew learning means work. The sisters and the villagers were more human than you are, Mr. Rheinbogenl"</p>
   <p>I think I surprised her by taking no offense. “I realize that,” I said with a dim sadness. ‘‘They were ... are ... the lucky ones.”</p>
   <p>“Then why do you live by—by killing and stealing and—”</p>
   <p>“I’m afraid I wasn’t born to be a child of nature. And I have my own work to do, you know.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Your work!"</emphasis></p>
   <p>That was all the goodnight I got.</p>
   <p>There was no danger that I would sleep so unwarily well that she could turn the tables. Not with the ground cold and damp and hard beneath me. I swore to myself and shifted position and counted up my separate aches. Ye gods— this was the natural life?</p>
   <p>Sometime after midnight, the monotonous clatter of my teeth must have lulled me. I was wakened from a fitful doze by a bang that shuddered in the earth. Fire burst over the sky, and then God opened the taps up there.</p>
   <p>We scrambled to what shelter we could find, under the heavy branches of a low spruce. The rain sheeted, blown on a skirl of wind, roaring in the needles, runneling off the ground. The flickering white lightning lit all the world, a moment’s sharp reality and then clamping darkness again, on and off, on and off; thunder went booming down endless hollow wastes.</p>
   <p>Marie huddled against me, not scared but seeking warmth. In a moment’s blue-white lividness I saw that she was smiling. And after a while I felt the same grin on my mouth. This was a wonder, it was the real cosmos breaking loose and roistering across the sky; I could not only realize intellectually, but <emphasis>feel,</emphasis> what ants we were, crawling over our mudball planet in a raw blaze of stars, and the knowledge was not terrifying but a sort of drunkenness.</p>
   <p>Presently the thunderstorm rolled beyond us and we stood in a slackening rain. It felt strangely gentle and soothing after that heavenly hooraw. We were wet and cold and rather hungry, but the show had been, so good that we didn’t mind much.</p>
   <p>“You know,” I said, “now I really understand what they mean when they talk about man being a forest animal. Ultimately all our art must go back to . . . this.”</p>
   <p>Marie’s voice came quizzical out of shadow, above the rain-plash: “You don’t talk like a gangster.”</p>
   <p>“How should I talk?” I chuckled. “We’re professional men, not walking cliches.”</p>
   <p>“Well”—surprisingly, she laughed—“you do seem to have more interests.”</p>
   <p>I explained that I was only a hood as a means of putting myself through school. “Someday I’m going to be a peaceful psychodynamics research man, looking for a scheme to reconcile the fact that three and a half billion people on the Solar System’s single habitable planet need technology to stay alive, with the fact that technology requires them to live under conditions for which they aren’t biologically fitted. A better scheme than any we now have, I mean.” I looked out into the running gloom. “It can’t go on this way forever. The present system is frankly meant as a stopgap.”</p>
   <p>“My father . ..” She hesitated.</p>
   <p>“Yes?”</p>
   <p>“My father said something like that a few days ago. He felt it was not right that we should have three separate houses while his workers were cooped into one room per family; and yet he would go crazy if he did not have space, and be unable to direct the chemicals union, and so there might be no artificial fertilizers and the workers would starve.”</p>
   <p>“Your father is a wise man,” I said.</p>
   <p>“But it’s so unfair!”</p>
   <p>“The universe never signed a contract with man requiring it to be fair. The old Jews knew that— read the Book of Job. Even you Christians don’t imagine the wrong will be redressed in this life.”</p>
   <p>She made no answer. We stood there while the rain ended and the clouds broke up and grayness became full sunrise. Then we had a bite to eat and started north again.</p>
   <p>My unaccustomed body was tired, sore, and chilled. But that disappeared as we walked through the morning. I breathed unfouled air and saw no swirl of gaping faces around me; a Canada jay was a vivid streak of blue against the dark spruce-green, a brook belled its way over mossy stones, some­thing which Marie called a thrush whistled liquidly, unseen.</p>
   <p>“It makes me wonder what possessed man to stop hunting and grub his food out of plowed dirt,” I said.</p>
   <p>Marie looked at me. We had not spoken for hours, but it had not been an altogether hostile silence. “The food was more secure . , . more certain,” she ventured.</p>
   <p>“Only in bad hunting territory,” I answered. “Which, of course, was where agricultural civilization was invented—of necessity.” I like to hear myself talk, and in any event I wanted to make a good impression on this girl, justify myself if possible.</p>
   <p>“Oh, there were reasons to become civilized, yes,” I continued. “The power, the gadgets . . . Nevertheless, for almost a million years man was a hunter. He’s still evolved for it, biologically and psychologically. His eyes are most sensitive in the yellow-green, the color of sunlight filtered through leaves. His feet are meant for a yielding surface, it’s pavement which flattens them. His body wants to sleep when it’s eaten a full meal, and otherwise run around freely. His soul wants the excitement of the chase and the kill, it wants a feast afterward, rejoicing, the intimacy of a tribe . . . and the chance to be alone, too, sometimes. All this is instinctive.</p>
   <p>“None of him wants to be crowded together, and chained to one tiny spot of the earth’s surface, and be an anonymous unit, bossed and herded and jammed into an iron desert of a city, subordinating food and sleep and digestion and love and play to a single monotonous job. He’s not built for it, his whole organism revolts against it. And yet nowadays we haven’t any choice, we can’t go back.”</p>
   <p>“Go back to the happy savage?” she jeered.</p>
   <p>“I’m not a Rousseauist,” I said. “The savage does have an impoverished, frightened, hard-working, and short life. Civilization does have fantastically wonderful potentialities, if only we can realize them. But it has drawbacks tool”</p>
   <p>We went on in silence for a bit. Then she shook her head. The breeze ruffled her short black hair.</p>
   <p>“What you call civilization isn’t,” she said. “You seem to think it means killing and stealing and tyranny.”</p>
   <p>“But it does,” I answered. “Civilization is an objective concept referring to a certain level of technology and a certain type of social organization. It has very good results—medical science, for example. It also has toxic by-products, the ones you mentioned.”</p>
   <p>“It doesn’t have to.”</p>
   <p>“I’m afraid it does. Read your history. By and large, it’s one long agony—now isn’t it?</p>
   <p>“It’s a matter of scientific record that those primitive peoples who survived long enough to be studied were, on the whole, much more decent than any civilized race. If war existed at all, it was a game rather than a butchery contest. Theft, murder, rape, sadism, in­sanity, were rare. Their morality may not have been that of the Decalogue, but they stuck closer to it than we’ve managed to stick to our own codes.”</p>
   <p>“And so you think the Ten Commandments are wrong?” asked Marie.</p>
   <p>“Not at all,” I said. “An admirable ideal, but so far only workable for primitives. Being civilized, we’re too full of tensions and hatreds to abide by it without a real effort—too great an effort for most people to make consistently. From petty chicanery and backyard malice, up to world war and the Almighty State, civilized man has to hurt his neighbor.”</p>
   <p>We came out on the shores of another lake. Squinting against the sunlight sharded on the water, I saw a building on the farther side, a long low thing of tinted plastic. I felt a sagging within myself . . . the adventure had ended. That lodge seemed like blasphemy, standing there blatant in the woods.</p>
   <p>Well . . .</p>
   <p>“We’ll go and call my HQ for transport,” I said. “Please don’t make it necessary for me to confine you while I do.”</p>
   <p>Marie’s lips clamped together again. She went unspeaking by my side as we started around the lake.</p>
   <p>“Take us a while to get there,” I said inanely. “It’s been a pleasant trip, hasn’t it?”</p>
   <p>No answer. “Look,” I said, “I’m only an agent. I’m terribly sorry to cause you this trouble. But it’s not much different from being a cop and giving you a ticket for speeding, is it?”</p>
   <p>Her voice was hard and remote: “The policeman is protecting us. You’re preying on us.”</p>
   <p>“Believe it or not,” I said, “I’m upholding the law. I exist for the public safety.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, you’re very smug about it,” she cried. “You have your license, you keep your greasy paws off me . . . thanks for that much!”</p>
   <p>“If it weren’t for the likes of me,” I said, “you could well have been snatched by someone who would not feel bound to keep his paws off you. Or let’s think about the Peace Authority.”</p>
   <p>Her cheeks burned, but instead of swinging at me she couldn’t help arguing. In some ways she was too intelligent for her own good—but a man would never be bored in her company. “The Smashup was too much,” she said. “People finally had it knocked into their heads what war means, and the Wastelands are still there to remind them. Don’t you go taking credit for the Authority!”</p>
   <p>“Oh, but I do. Consider, as merely one example, German history <emphasis>after</emphasis> the Thirty Years’ War, People never learn. Ruins, Wastelands, historical records, memoirs, warnings, mean nothing. The Peace Authority is possible only because we’ve found a better outlet than war, at least a less harmful one, for the evil in man.”</p>
   <p>“But man is not evil,” protested Marie. “He’s born to sin, yes, but he has the possibility of grace.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe ‘evil’ was the wrong word,” I agreed. “Let’s say, rather, the hatred in him which comes from being civilized.</p>
   <p>“Just before the Smashup, psychodynamics had developed to the point where this could be shown to be a fact—that most men, if not all, hate their civilization, subconsciously but intensely; and that the hatred must be vented somehow. The old-time professional soldier, like the modern professional gangster, was usually a kind, friendly man because his tensions were discharged in wartime. But society can’t afford war any longer.</p>
   <p>“It was too late to prevent the Smashup, and civilization was lucky to survive. The destruction, chaos, and suffering of it vented so much wrath that people were fairly peaceable for a decade afterward. That made it possible to institute legalized, regulated crime, as the necessary safety valve. It also, incidentally, abolished such cold­blooded wasteful fiendishness as locking sound men into cages for one mistake—and, through the institution of outlawry, has begun slowly to eliminate the incredible fatheadedness of turning congenital psychopaths loose on parole. But that’s minor. Even the fun involved—and it <emphasis>is</emphasis> fun—is secondary.</p>
   <p>“You seem to be more at peace with yourself than most, Marie; you could live happily in a crimeless, warless world. But very few people can. So we give them crime, and a touch of freedom and color and adventure in their lives, instead of war.</p>
   <p>“Therefore I insist, Marie, that in my own way, I’m upholding the law and making the world a little safer, a little cleaner. And someday I can have a hand in finding a better answer than this.”</p>
   <p>I stopped, quite hoarse from my oration. There was a summery quietness, and we walked through it for a mile or so. We rounded the lake and found a path leading to the lodge.</p>
   <p>“You may be right,” said Marie at last, very softly.</p>
   <p>My heart gave an irrational jump. It shouldn’t matter what a victim thought of me, but in this case it did.</p>
   <p>Her eyes turned somberly up toward mine. “But I have a right too,” she said, “and my father does.”</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry for him,” I replied sincerely, “and for you. But aristocracy has always had its penalties as well as its privileges.”</p>
   <p>“You . . . you’re not the sort I imagined you were . , . not the sort to cause needless pain. You could let me go—”</p>
   <p>I bit my lip. “I could. But I won’t.”</p>
   <p>“Why not? If it’s the money, you’ll he paid ten times over; I swear it.”</p>
   <p>“No. It’s a matter of—” I laughed, rather sadly. “Honor. May I use that word? I undertook to do a job, and my brothers are depending on me to do it. I can’t blacken their name. It’s socially important, too—-I want to see more and more people delegate their crimes to us pros. We can do it less messily, more considerately; and it helps get our customers out of the habit of violence.”</p>
   <p>“But—you would work for that <emphasis>cochon?”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“The fellow who hired me? I don’t like him one little bit. I wish to God your father had hired me against him. But yes, having given my word, I’ll do his job to the best of my ability.”</p>
   <p>Gravel scrunched underfoot.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry,” I said.</p>
   <p>“If he could know how it is—!”</p>
   <p>“I’ll gladly take a crack at him after this episode is over.”</p>
   <p>“After he has gotten what he wants from my father, and is on his guard—” She turned her face. I saw her stiffen.</p>
   <p>I walked on in anguish. It wasn’t right, it wasn’t fair. She was too much alive to be penned away for months; she would come out of it with her own tensions built up, already I could see it happening, another civilized creature with civilized hate to discharge on someone else. Wasn’t I trying to build a society where no one loathed his fellow man, where folk worked together not because they were told to but because it was their free will? I had a member of that future right here, beside me, and I was going to ruin her for the sake of that same future. It didn’t make sense.</p>
   <p>We came up to the lodge. Its wealthy guests stared at our sun­burnt griminess from their lounging chairs and their cocktail terrace. I wanted to stuff every fat belly in the place with lead.</p>
   <p>Shifting my gun conspicuously near my hand, I took Marie into the lobby. “I’m on a job,” I said to the clerk. “Want to make a call from here.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, sir, yessir, rightthiswaysir!” He jumped to it. I was disappointed, needing an excuse to bully someone. We were shown into the office and left in privacy.</p>
   <p>I didn’t dial HQ—our lines were undoubtedly tapped by Dulac’s goons—but a laundry in Duluth. Our agent there relayed the call through a scrambler to Twincity. It took a minute or two to raise the operator at that end.</p>
   <p>Waiting, I lit a cigaret and slumped. “We’ll have a plane here for you in half an hour,” I said. “That’ll finish my part of the job.”</p>
   <p>She didn’t reply, but stood behind me. I could hear how fast she breathed.</p>
   <p>“You’ll doubtless say no,” I went on, “and I’ll not blame you . . . but may I come see you in the hideout, now and then?” When she still made no answer, I smiled on one side of my mouth. “At least let me buy you a proper breakfast here. It’s all on the expense account.”</p>
   <p>The screen lit up before she could respond. I was put through to Swanson at once, and told him briefly what had happened.</p>
   <p>“Good boy!” he said warmly. “That was a beaut you pulled— it’ll go down in the annals, believe me. We’ll get a plane up there right away.”</p>
   <p>“No hurry,” I said without tone. “No hurry at all.”</p>
   <p>“Ah ... so. How well I understand.” Swanson bowed in the screen. “Miss Dulac, my deepest apologies. I assure you—”</p>
   <p>“Never mind that.” She drew a long breath and leaned over my shoulder, brushing me. Maybe it was just hunger, but I felt a little dizzy at that. Her voice was crisp tight, with a bare hint of laughter. “Let me say something first.”</p>
   <p>“By all means, Miss Dulac. We aim to please.”</p>
   <p>“I have a job for you myself. I want a kidnaping done.”</p>
   <p>I distinctly heard my jaw click against my Adam’s apple.</p>
   <p>“What?” Swanson recovered himself and sputtered: “But this isn’t—it’s never been—”</p>
   <p>“I insist on my civil rights,” snapped Marie. “Merely being a prisoner hasn’t removed them. I have as much light to take out a license and sign a contract as anyone else.”</p>
   <p>“Ah ... to be sure . . . but—”</p>
   <p>“We can settle it right here when your man comes. I want you to kidnap the one who had me kidnaped.”</p>
   <p>“But we can’t—we’re <emphasis>working </emphasis>for him!”</p>
   <p>“Are you, now? You contracted to do one task for him. You have done it. Aren’t you now free to—”</p>
   <p>“Well ... let me think . . . yes, Chuck is under his contract and therefore can’t operate against him till it expires. But anyone else in the union—Wait a minute!” The sparkle faded in Swanson’s eyes, “You can’t sign a John Doe warrant, you know. You have to name the person you want heisted, and we can’t tell you who he is.”</p>
   <p>She made an impatient gesture. “My father is no fool. When the notice of intent was served on me, I asked him who might be responsible and he explained how his affairs stood, Let’s say, then, that I want the—what you call it— snatch put on one James Hardy of New Chicago. The ransom requirement will be that he, ah, arrange my release.” She paused, frowning. “And, yes, that he pay your fees for this job.”</p>
   <p>Swanson leaned back in his chair and gasped with laughter.</p>
   <p>We sat on the cocktail terrace, watching sunset smolder into the lake. There was a muted buzz of conversation, clink of glasses, whisper of music around us. I didn’t mind, indeed I felt quite kindly toward my fellow guests.</p>
   <p>I raised my own glass. “To success,” I said.</p>
   <p>Marie nodded and touched mine with hers. Our shysters had pushed the license, notice, and contract through in a hurry, and we were now awaiting news. Under the circumstances, I had declared that this lodge fulfilled the conditions of a hideout and that we could just as well detain the girl here as elsewhere. It had been a good, three days; I’d never had better ones.</p>
   <p>“You’re a strange man, Charles,” she murmured. “The soul of honor about your profession, yes, but you helped me with a great deal of legal hairsplitting.”</p>
   <p>“I had to see that everything was drawn up in proper form,” I said virtuously. “It’s the duty of all citizens to respect the law.”</p>
   <p>“The letter of the law, anyhow,” she grinned. “But you were wearing such shining armor when we first met.”</p>
   <p>“Armor is not very comfortable,” I said. “I’d only wear it for someone like you.”</p>
   <p>Her eyes darkened and she shivered. “It is bad to think that you could be killed next time.”</p>
   <p>“I have to make a living. Several years to go yet before I can make it doing research.”</p>
   <p>“My father . . .”</p>
   <p>“Yes?”</p>
   <p>“When I tell him how it was . . . He likes a clean fighter. He would be glad to offer you a summer position, one that paid well.”</p>
   <p>“Sorry. He employs our friendly rivals. I couldn’t fight my own brothers.”</p>
   <p>The waiter oozed up with a phone extension and laid it on the table. “Call for you, sir.” I lowered the privacy hood; in order to see the little screen under it, Marie and I had to have our heads together.</p>
   <p>Swanson looked minutely out at us. “All done, boy,” he said. “Hardy was still in town. He’d figured Dulac himself put the bee on him, and wasn’t looking for trouble from us. We lifted him right out of his hotel room, and you should have heard him squawk! He’s met the terms, though—had to, if his enterprises weren’t to go to pot in his absence. You can take Miss Dulac home now.”</p>
   <p>“Shucks,” I grinned, above a certain desolation, “You needn’t have been in that kind of a hurry.”</p>
   <p>Swanson shook his head. “It’s an unprecedented business, this,” he muttered. “It never happened before that a gang union acted against somebody who was employing one of its own members. There are going to be ICC hearings, and lawsuits, and—Lord knows what’ll come of it.”</p>
   <p>“That,” I said, “is one reason why it’s fun to be alive. I can rent a copter here—never mind sending a plane for us. Cheerio.”</p>
   <p>The hood lifted. Marie and I regarded each other for a long while. “I hope you’ll at least stay for dinner,” I said.</p>
   <p>“Oh, yes. I should forego a genuine charcoal-broiled yeast mignon?” She laughed joyously and rose. “I’ll just call my father now— be back at once, <emphasis>mon ami!’</emphasis></p>
   <p>I had time for some moody and lonesome thoughts while she was gone, there in the twilight under the Japanese lanterns. She found me a poor companion on her return. “But what is wrong?” she asked.</p>
   <p>“Never mind,” I said. “Or ... Oh, the deuce with it. I was just thinking that I’ll take you home in a couple of hours, and I can’t accept that job you offered me, and there’s an end of it.”</p>
   <p>“But who said anything about a gunman’s position?” she asked in surprise. “Your psychodynamics has its uses in industry, no? You know enough already to hold down a well-paid summer job, and . . Her voice trailed off, “If you wish to cease being a gangster,” she concluded uncertainly.</p>
   <p>I twirled the glass in my hands. It was no easy choice. I hadn’t counted on hanging up my guns for years. I needed enough hunting to satisfy my instincts for the rest of an uneventful life—</p>
   <p>But hell! Wasn’t research a hunt? Had Newton or Darwin or Einstein ever felt the need to kill and steal? Hardly. They were after bigger game.</p>
   <p>I lifted the glass and finished my drink.</p>
