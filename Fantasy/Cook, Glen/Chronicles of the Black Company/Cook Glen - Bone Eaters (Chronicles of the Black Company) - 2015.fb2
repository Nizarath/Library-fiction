  <section>
   <p>Whittle and Fall Woo led the trigger gang: four unreliable brothers with a decrepit, covered goat cart, two broke-down mules, a moth-eaten burro dragging an open cart, plus some refugee slatterns and associated brats.</p>
   <p>Out of sight behind, the Company stretched for miles along a track locals called a road, crossing stony hills whiskered with brush and scraggly young pines. Wildfire had passed through, years back. Charred adult tree corpses still tilted drunkenly.</p>
   <p>I rode with the hidden guard posse supporting the scouts.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The brigands were new to the trade. Only one was mounted, aboard a nag that might not last another month. The rest were kids armed with rusty knives and farm tools.</p>
   <p>The barefoot boy on horseback gobbled a stanza of “Stand and deliver!” in the local dialect. Another waved a sharp-ended stick and pranced. The rest approved with less enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>A brown something materialized beside the rider’s ear. He squealed. The thing looked like a monkey with too many legs, each tipped with a claw like a pruning knife. It had too many yellow eyes, too.</p>
   <p>Hiding in the goat cart was that nasty toad of a wizard, Goblin, who loved crafting revolting illusions.</p>
   <p>Whittle disarmed six youngsters, injuring two. The boy on the horse galloped off, squalling.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Ranging ahead, I caught up first—and saw nothing to elevate my esteem for humanity.</p>
   <p>Whittle had left the captives with Rusty and Robin. Rusty was a waste of meat, a coward, a bully, a shirker, and a scrounge. Only Robin liked him. Everybody thought somebody ought to put Rusty down.</p>
   <p>Whittle left Rusty in charge because he wanted to be rid of dead weight. He lacked the imagination to see a potential problem in leaving Rusty self-supervised.</p>
   <p>Rusty had a bandit bent over a boulder. Both had their trousers down. Rusty was having no joy. Little Rusty was not interested. Robin sprawled nearby, aching in body and soul, tangled up with a couple of bound, gagged, and extremely agitated male captives. He had tried to interfere. He met my eye, gasped, “Croaker! Please! Help her.”</p>
   <p>I spurred my mount.</p>
   <p>Rusty stayed lucky. A low branch ambushed me as my valiant steed lunged forward. Over her tail I went.</p>
   <p>Pants held up left-handed, Rusty gave me a case of boot rash while letting the world know that he had had it with my holier-than-thou, candy-ass whining. “Croaker, grow a set! Act like a godsdamned real soldier.”</p>
   <p>Hoofbeats approached.</p>
   <p>Rusty went white behind his freckles.</p>
   <p>His victim moaned and tried to crawl away.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Darling and the sorcerer Silent dismounted. Silent fixed Rusty with a venomous glare. Rusty saved the excuses. He always had some but knew they would be wasted today. Darling always knew the smell of bullshit. Rusty would fool himself before he fooled her.</p>
   <p>Darling’s sad disdain was palpable. Rusty wilted. Darling was no longer younger, was never pretty and never available, was ice hard outside but suffered from a soft heart. We all love her. And her good regard is precious even to the worst of us.</p>
   <p>Was Rusty smart enough to realize how lucky he was, having Darling show up before anyone else? Even in a situation so similar to her own first brush with the Company, back in another age? Death had stalked him for months already. Only Hell’s luck and Darling’s grace had kept him on the weather side of the grass this long.</p>
   <p>Silent’s evil eyes said he would happily give Rusty a painful nudge along the downward road, were Darling not there to stay him. His sorcery will not work around Darling. No sorcery will. The Lady herself would have no recourse but mind and muscle in Darling’s presence.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Darling set me on the girl. I brushed auburn hair aside. The kid was pretty under the grunge. I saw no physical damage. Darling tapped her own forehead, belly, and signed. Silent shrugged. He could not tell from inside the magical null.</p>
   <p>Darling feared the girl might be pregnant, not thanks to Rusty, who had suffered another of his life’s numerous disappointments.</p>
   <p>She had me check Robin and the male prisoners next.</p>
   <p>Robin would heal. That idiot kid was more worried about Rusty than about himself. Some friendships just never make sense.</p>
   <p>Rusty now had his arms wrapped around his knees, his head tucked. He rocked slowly, knowing he was well and truly screwed—and probably did not understand why.</p>
   <p>No captive was smart enough to speak a language any of us knew. Talking loud or slow did not help.</p>
   <p>More Company men arrived. Rusty rocked faster.</p>
   <p>His behavior had not been extreme. Rape was weather. War weather. And good men do not join the Company. His big problem was, he was “that asshole Rusty” that everybody loved to hate.</p>
   <p>Darling held Robin’s hand briefly. The kid took that as a divine dispensation. Then she made a round of the prisoners. One boy met her eye stubbornly, not defiant but definitely determined. He kept an eye on the pretty girl always.</p>
   <p>They would be siblings. Maybe twins. They were of a size and looked enough alike.</p>
   <p>His glances toward Rusty were not kind.</p>
   <p>Rusty rocked.</p>
   <p>Robin moved the bandit girl without touching her, distancing her from the scene of her embarrassment. I stayed close. She was scared but neither defiant nor resigned. She observed, calculated, abided her time.</p>
   <p>Then she groaned, clutched herself as though kicked in the gut, and puked.</p>
   <p>Darling had come close enough to touch her.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Bandit girl was not knocked up despite having run with an all-male gang.</p>
   <p>Sporadically, randomly, unpredictably, I am intuitive. She was a witch. A menarche-onset wild talent who did not yet understand what she was. She would not respond to Darling so violently, otherwise.</p>
   <p>Wild talents seldom prosper. They scare the mud out of people. Evil sorcerers begin as local nuisances who grow to become regional afflictions. The worst then begin raising wicked armies and putting up dark towers. So why not burn them before they set the earth to shaking?</p>
   <p>Me, I reckon any pretty young sociopath can create chaos without injecting magic into the mix.</p>
   <p>Darling flurried signs at Silent, telling him to teach and protect the girl and make her keep her distance. When the girl hurt because Darling was close Darling hurt because the girl was close. Darling had me spread the word that the girl was not to be touched even if she sprinted through camp bare-ass begging for male attention.</p>
   <p>The girl and her friends became not quite prisoners who were not quite guests. Silent sloughed their care and feeding off onto Robin. The girl seemed comfortable with him.</p>
   <p>Rusty got busy being an invisible man. He stayed far away from the girl.</p>
   <p>Some of our tagalong refugees spoke a dialect related to that of the bandits. Darling offered the bandits an opportunity to participate in our great adventure. They would be expected to pull their weight, of course.</p>
   <p>They owed us for several meals before they fully understood the peril they had put themselves into. Our one-time employer, now our great enemy, the near-goddess the Lady, was a traveler’s tale in these parts. Her hunting dog sorceress, the Taken Whisper, was a complete unknown. Too late the newcomers learned that our pursuers were determined to convert us all into acres of feasts for ravens, flies, and scavengers.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The girl’s name was Chasing Midnight. She was scary smart. She picked up enough language to get by in just a week. Though officially Silent’s problem, she stuck to Robin till she learned that I was educated enough to be Company physician and Annalist. Literacy is sorcery itself in the hinterland. Plus, smelly old Croaker looked easy prey for pretty girl manipulation.</p>
   <p>She definitely had an unconscious talent, proven by her having run untouched with that gang of boys. It explained Rusty’s disappointment, too. Males who got close could not sustain an interest.</p>
   <p>Darling had a similar aura.</p>
   <p>Midnight’s twin brother was Chasing Moonlight, not so bright but loyal to a lethal fault. She was twelve minutes older. Their story was familiar. Bad weather, pests, poor crops, relentless tax collectors. Many of us played a turn in a similar drama once upon a time.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“They fear me,” Midnight complained. She was underfoot all the time, now, two weeks on. She meant the refugees traveling with us.</p>
   <p>“They think you’re a witch. They lost everything because of a witch.”</p>
   <p>“Stupid thinking.”</p>
   <p>“Never any shortage of stupid, girl.”</p>
   <p>She muttered something in her own language, which I was having trouble picking up. She was no help, of course. As long as only she and her boys spoke the tongue, they could share secrets. She was their leader now.</p>
   <p>The cavalier who ran from Goblin’s devil was an older brother, now first on her contemptibles list. He had wakened her keep-off-me talent. His fierce cowardice was sugar on the biscuit. She only hinted at the ugly. I did not pursue it. That is not done in this tribe.</p>
   <p>I did press her on her personal habits. I want clean, neat, healthy people around me. She considered the pressure absurdist humor. “Why bother? You do not expect to escape your Whispering Doom.” She meant Whisper, who certainly planned to be our doom.</p>
   <p>“The Company has faith in Darling.”</p>
   <p>“The black man that does not talk. He is dangerous?”</p>
   <p>“Only if you’re a threat to Darling.”</p>
   <p>“Not I.”</p>
   <p>I shrugged. She could be the Lady’s plant. The old terror would not scruple against using a child. “He’s our strongest wizard.” She had not yet met Goblin or One-Eye. One-Eye had been missing for more than a month. “Just don’t make him worry about Darling.”</p>
   <p>Moonlight and pals rolled up. They were FNGs with attitude now. No longer hungry, they objected to having to do shit jobs just because they were new. They wanted Midnight to wiggle her ass and get them easier jobs.</p>
   <p>People. Saints and philosophers tell us to love them. No doubt anchorites who never suffered the everyday mob. I seldom see anyone actually deserving of brotherly love.</p>
   <p>But I have been here in the Company most of my adult life.</p>
   <p>I do hope that karma is the keystone of the universe—even if I have to come back as a banana slug myself.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nerves frayed. This was the Company on the long run, a flight already years in duration. We had luck out the wazoo, every day, like it was going out of style, and most of it was bad. Which we expected.</p>
   <p>Only . . . Whisper’s scouts faded away, which made no sense. They ought to be pressing harder than ever, to repay the hurt we had done them not so long ago. But they lost interest instead. Or they lost the trail.</p>
   <p>Our flight slowed. Some days we moved only a mile or three. Other days we did not move at all.</p>
   <p>The villages we skirted became less bristly. We paid for supplies rather than make new enemies. Some villages adopted the less repugnant of our female hangers-on. I did not mind. I would not miss having all those children underfoot.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>My apprentices were exasperating. They were competing to see who was laziest.</p>
   <p>“One of you is going back to the ranks at the end of the week.” That got their attention. “Midnight, who is showing some actual interest, will take his place.”</p>
   <p>She had overtaken them in the last month. She did not evade fatigue details. She worked hard, wanted to learn, never complained. And she was killer cute, a skill with which no boy can compete.</p>
   <p>I looked Joro in the eye, he being the most useless. “Since Moonlight and his gang left us there are openings in human-waste management.” Of which I was lord and arbiter. I do not get my own paws dirty. I do decide who does.</p>
   <p>Midnight’s friends had vanished one night, several back. Nobody missed their whining. Only Midnight’s feelings were hurt. I wondered why they had not taken her along.</p>
   <p>I wondered to Darling, the Lieutenant, Silent, and Elmo. Elmo and the Lieutenant did not care. Darling would see no evil till it bit her. Cynical Silent figured Midnight was behind the desertion even though she stuck with us herself.</p>
   <p>By being helpful and pliable she became increasingly suspect to Silent. His reasoning was impossible to follow.</p>
   <p>Then One-Eye turned up, which complicated things considerably.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“The Lady called them off,” One-Eye reported. “For their own safety.” He was tired and hungry. The rest of us thought he needed a bath, something he would not undertake voluntarily. “Two Taken were killed when Whisper attacked that castle. She and the other Taken got hurt, too, but our luck held. She didn’t die. She’s <emphasis>almost</emphasis> dead, but we’ll eventually see her back with the last ounce of mercy boiled out. Her troops, after fighting us and suffering what I’ve been putting them through, are used up.”</p>
   <p>He meant their fighting spirit was gone, not that their number had been exhausted. There is never any shortage of men willing to take the Lady’s coin. She is a reliable paymaster—who purchases your soul and conscience as well as your time.</p>
   <p>So with the surviving Imperial sorcerers concentrating on staying above ground, our less potent wizards could serve their minions misery in epic portions.</p>
   <p>“You shoulda been with me,” One-Eye told Silent. “I ain’t never had so much fun since . . . Since before buzzkill Croaker signed up! Mice in a barrel!” He grinned, flashing terrible teeth, trying to flirt with Midnight, who had come along to get a look at a living legend. Said legend was older than dirt, often hard to distinguish from dirt, and when not engaged in criminal activities, about as ambitious as dirt. It was a certainty that he had lined his pockets somehow during his independent venture.</p>
   <p>He held a cherished position on every brother’s shit list but never soared up where he might be at risk like Rusty. He did occasionally make himself useful. He could do amazing things if the notion took him.</p>
   <p>Midnight hunched deeper into my shadow, pressed her fists against my back like she was terrified and needed protection. All contrived. She was raw but definitely an actress, all the world her stage.</p>
   <p>Nothing like a hundred-and-some-year-old, shriveled-up little black wizard making eyes at a pubescent girl to get the boys sneering.</p>
   <p>One-Eye was calculating himself, of course. His world is a stage, too, his life performance art.</p>
   <p>He gave the remnants of his disgusting old black hat a quarter turn, winked again. “I’m in love. You want to sell me that one, Croaker?”</p>
   <p>Midnight’s squeak might have indicated real concern.</p>
   <p>Darling signed almost too fast to follow. Had One-Eye not been as dark and wrinkled as a worn out-boot, he might have turned pale.</p>
   <p>Ages have flown since the Company rescued child Darling from some Rebel Rustys when she was years younger than Midnight now. Many who were with us then have gone on to darker worlds. But Darling remembers. Darling does not suffer anyone making light of horrors she endured herself.</p>
   <p>She was grimly uncomfortable, anyway, with so many sorcerers so close by.</p>
   <p>Midnight was uncomfortable, herself, but stubbornly insisted on slaking her curiosity.</p>
   <p>One-Eye said, “Here’s the story. The Lady told them to back off, rest up, and get healthy. She’ll keep the Eye on us. She’ll send new Taken if Whisper can’t get healthy. She’ll come out here herself if she has to.” He winked at me, pumped his left thumb between the first two fingers of that hand.</p>
   <p>I was once a captive in the Tower, while the Company was in the Lady’s service. She turned me loose eventually. I have been taunted about being the old horror’s bed buddy ever since.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Customers awaited me at the clinic. “Twiller, my man, tell me, how does a guy get the clap in the middle of a godsdamn desert?”</p>
   <p>True desert it was not, just dry scrubland that went on and on and on.</p>
   <p>“Never mind. I know. You got it from some woman who got it from Swain who got it from some other woman who got it from you the last time you had it.”</p>
   <p>Twiller had the grace to look sheepish. His behavior would not change, though. He was still that young, and none too bright.</p>
   <p>Robin was my other customer. His ailment was one no physician has ever cured. Sometimes Midnight seemed interested back. Her stay-off-me aura weakened when he was around.</p>
   <p>The kid was the gentle soul that Rusty could never be, which did not serve him well with a girl. He needed more push.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Midnight mused, “The old black man did not tell us everything.”</p>
   <p>“No.” I had seen the tells. One-Eye was shifty. If a potential score was out there we might hear nothing solid till the fallout set in. If it touched on the safety of the Company, though, he would be whispering with Darling and the Lieutenant now.</p>
   <p>I asked, “You know anything about what’s ahead of us?” I had a suspicion about why the Lady had leashed her hounds.</p>
   <p>“We approach the bounds of fable already.”</p>
   <p>We had covered little more than a hundred miles since her ambush. With no pressure on we slowed despite a consensus that we ought to grab all the separation we could.</p>
   <p>“You can’t be that ignorant. The bounds of fable sounds like something somebody avoiding the subject would blat. Meaning somebody had something she didn’t want to talk about. But that wouldn’t make sense. She’d be strutting into the shit storm with the rest of us.”</p>
   <p>“I know fairy tales. Only fairy tales. I never heard of anybody who ever actually saw the Village of Hungry Ghosts.” She paused. I said nothing. The vacuum moved her to fill it. “My da would say that was because nobody who did ever came back.”</p>
   <p>Her words for Village of Hungry Ghosts were unfamiliar, but the concept was not. I had encountered it long ago, while we served the Lady in the east reaches of the Empire.</p>
   <p>Hungry ghosts are not regular spooks, the spirits of dead folks that cannot move on. Legend described hungry ghosts as being more like vampire phantoms. They would possess the living and consume them slowly from within. They would never move on to heaven or hell or wherever because their earthly business was never done. They would migrate from host to host till something somehow annihilated them.</p>
   <p>Where did they come from? The stories do not explain. Like monkeys and crows, they are. Likely an ancient sorcerer was involved, or a cruel, mischievous dawn-time god.</p>
   <p>Great communal sorcery was required to effect a migration from a dying body to a fresh one, at least in the hungry ghost stories I had heard.</p>
   <p>I told Midnight. She shrugged. She had nothing to add. My information fit with what she knew.</p>
   <p>I left her to Robin, went to talk it over with those in charge.</p>
   <p>Fantastic as a village of hungry ghosts seemed, the behavior of our enemies made more sense in that context.</p>
   <p>We should expect an occasional Imperial nudge intended to keep us hopping toward disaster.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>I am destined to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when shit happens. I turned up while Rusty was trying to plug Midnight. Then . . .</p>
   <p>I was two rods from the latrine when someone inside squealed in surprise, pain, and terror. The moon’s light showed me nothing because Darling insisted that the pits be masked by canvas to preserve the modesty of the females among us.</p>
   <p>I hollered as I charged.</p>
   <p>Two kids came out to see about the noise. Both had deserted with Chasing Moonlight. They owned no combat skills. I laid them out as quick as it takes to tell it.</p>
   <p>Canvas did not mask the latrine from the eye of the sky. The half moon shed light enough to show me what I expected: Midnight’s brother and friends swarming Rusty, who was in serious trouble, having been caught seated on logs with his trousers down.</p>
   <p>Punch! Grab! Sling! Prod, poke, and jab! Punch! I am no master infighter, but I have stayed in one piece for years. And the idiot kids had not posted a lookout, or said lookout had been unable to resist joining in on the fun.</p>
   <p>Give them this: they hit their man at the exact perfect moment. But we need to knock off points for not having brought the tools to make quick work of the job.</p>
   <p>My yells brought help fast. Quick response is something we do well, our lessons learned in a brutal school. There is still a Company.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nobody got dead. Not even Rusty, though he might wish for worse luck when he woke up and began to enjoy the pain. His chances would be iffy for a while. He lost a lot of blood, one weeping shallow wound at a time. The boys cut him a lot, inside a shithouse. Sepsis was almost certain. Also, in time, a spider’s web collection of thin new scars.</p>
   <p>Only a double handful of cuts needed stitching. The rest I cleaned with alcohol and swabbed with an astringent. I made Midnight assist though I was sure she had had nothing to do with the attack. The lesson was that medicine and surgery leave no space for personal feelings.</p>
   <p>I know. I make exceptions. I am dumb enough to have recorded a few in these Annals. Sic a lawyer on me. I will borrow some black on his hair-splitting ass, too.</p>
   <p>So. Do as I say, child, not as I do.</p>
   <p>She amazed me. Rusty naked and painted with dried or jellied blood troubled her very little. She did not interfere with his hunger for breath. She might have considered elevating him to eunuch status but let that go, too. She followed instructions precisely. Scary, a kid her age having that much control. What next? Conquering armies and new dark towers?</p>
   <p>I was halfway in love when we finished, not with the girly girl but with the unflappable surgeon’s assistant.</p>
   <p>All the others did was keep Robin away while Midnight and I fixed Rusty. Then, tired as she was, she took over wrangling Rusty’s only living friend.</p>
   <p>During that was when Chasing Midnight finally admitted to herself that she might be the wild talent the rest of us said. She began flirting with all of our wizards. They all, Silent included, took her on as a kind of smart, pretty pet.</p>
   <p>She started winning the hearts and minds of the soldiers, too. She recruited herself a platoon’s worth of adopted, protective big brothers.</p>
   <p>Definitely a menace to tomorrow, this Chasing Midnight.</p>
   <p>Darling got a little jealous.</p>
   <p>She never had any competition before.</p>
   <p>I stretched out aboard a cot a parallel yard from Rusty’s and fell asleep halfway hoping I had not gotten every wound completely clean. The regular guy suppressed by the physician wished “that asshole Rusty” all the joys and complications of protracted gangrene.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Darling’s judgments were neither harsh nor unpopular. Moonlight’s boys got extra duty. Moonlight himself got extra extra for fomenting. Darling overlooked their desertion completely.</p>
   <p>Oh. The boys had to carry Rusty’s litter when we were on the move. That pained them more than any other punishment could.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“We have a problem,” the Lieutenant told the assembled officers. Darling sat to one side, leaving it all to him. She washed me in disapproval. I had brought Midnight. She wondered if something untoward was going on with us. Croaker might be a good man, generally, but he <emphasis>was</emphasis> a man.</p>
   <p>My thinking was, the kid ought to start learning now because she could end up running the show someday. She had that much going on.</p>
   <p>Silent disapproved, too, but only because Darling was hurting. He agreed with my long-range assessment despite what having a sorceress in charge might mean.</p>
   <p>“We have fallen under a glamour,” the Lieutenant told us. “It keeps us from going the direction we want.” No secret, that. Whatever we tried, come sundown the sun would be directly ahead. Come sunrise it would be directly behind. Darling’s talent was too localized to resist any sorcery beyond a hundred feet. Those she could not shield shambled on like zombies.</p>
   <p>Our wizards would fight it but still had to trudge on along with the other hundreds.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>So there it was. The Village of Hungry Ghosts, where immortal souls, perhaps once human, lived on in old but epic squalor. I was reminded of a bat cave occupied for ten thousand years. The immortality of the hungry ghosts produced neither prosperity nor any form of sanitation. A commentary on the essential wickedness of willful circumvention of natural order.</p>
   <p>Our wizards sat in a row, inches separating their shoulders. They stared at ruins so ancient they were barely recognizable as recollections of human construction. Midnight rested on her knees behind the gap between Goblin and One-Eye, determined to observe and learn. The rest of the Company were supposed to be setting camp a half mile away, beyond a narrow defile of a dry wash, beside a bitter pool fed by a marginally less bitter spring that once must have served the village. Remnants of an aqueduct ran to the memory of a town. Darling made herself an anti-magic plug in the defile, at a point where she could both watch and protect the handful of us who had assistants who could set up our part of the camp for us while we did something we found more interesting.</p>
   <p>I was inside Darling’s null, barely, feeling the siren call of the village, which was as relentless as gravity itself. Whatever our efforts, sooner or later somebody was going to break down and go sprinting in.</p>
   <p>Goblin said, “They’re bound here. They can’t leave without a body to carry them. But if they do leave and their host dies, they’ll die, too.”</p>
   <p>One-Eye said, “They do generate one hell of a siren call, don’t they? We can barely handle it.”</p>
   <p>“The Lady knew,” I told the Lieutenant, who relayed my comment to Darling.</p>
   <p>She nodded. She seemed unconcerned, there inside her null, keeping scores from marching toward personality death. Did she not get the horror?</p>
   <p>Of course she did. She was Darling. Darling always understood, better than any of us.</p>
   <p>Silent signed that he sensed six hungry ghosts but thought there might be more so long separated from flesh that they had become undetectable. He warned that those would be more dangerous than those that he could sense. They would be the hungriest. They would be able to seize living flesh. Elaborate ceremonies were necessary only for abandoning used-up flesh, not for taking new bone.</p>
   <p>Silent seemed remarkably well informed. I did not ask. He would tell us if he thought we needed to know.</p>
   <p>Goblin and One-Eye muttered. Silent signed. Midnight watched and listened. She read sign well enough now to eavesdrop on Silent’s dancing fingers. She was not good at signing herself, yet, though.</p>
   <p>She would learn. You have to sign to deal with Darling or Silent. Darling is deaf and dumb. Silent is bone stubborn about not talking. And signing is handy when we are sneaking around on people we mean to hurt or who plan on hurting us.</p>
   <p>Darling beckoned. I needed to fall back to where she blocked the defile, restraining glassy-eyed, confused shamblers who wanted to go make love with the hungry ghosts.</p>
   <p>Sometimes our most potent resources conflict. Darling’s null, though, never spread out enough for general use in battle. We employed her in ambushes and where sorcery-capable antagonists were unaware of what they faced.</p>
   <p>Our antagonist here was hunger incarnate, or would-be incarnate. The hungry ghosts had no other drive. Normally they did not need to be anything else. Lure a victim with the siren call, devour him from within, slowly, while the flesh withered, then find another host, always where there were fellow incarnates to help with timely migrations.</p>
   <p>Speaking of. If these ghosts snagged enough Company people they could migrate physically, collectively, the lot of them, somewhere with a rich supply of replacement flesh.</p>
   <p>Did anyone else realize that? “Are any of them still incarnate?”</p>
   <p>Silent raised three fingers and flurried signs that said something about asses.</p>
   <p>Goblin translated. “There is one old woman and two wild asses.”</p>
   <p>“They possess animals, too?” I conjured an image of possessed killer box tortoises. Tortoises were common in this almost desert.</p>
   <p>“Higher order vertebrates.”</p>
   <p>“What do we do now?” Midnight asked. Very young, untrained, yet confident that she belonged to a “we” that included only her and the men she knelt behind, not our broader gang.</p>
   <p>Chasing Midnight never lacked confidence or self-esteem. Neither did she own an inflated notion of who and what she might be.</p>
   <p>No one but the Annalist, who worries about secret meanings hidden within words, studied her question. The Annalist relayed his curiosity to Darling. Darling was in a mood because people kept piling up and jostling her as they tried to see what was going on out front. She signed back, “Is it possible to kill the hungry ghosts?”</p>
   <p>Unsentimental and pragmatic, our Darling, in the hard places—especially where somebody was preying on weaker folks. She disdained painful revenge but lacked all qualms about cutting throats she deemed in need of cutting.</p>
   <p>Rusty had that in mind back when he was doing all that rocking. He had it in mind, still. He was putting in his longest streak of good behavior ever.</p>
   <p>I relayed Darling’s question aloud. Maybe because of the “first do no harm” oath from when I was too young not to have a caul of idealism across my eyes, I do have one of the softer hearts in the Company.</p>
   <p>They tell me it will get me killed. No doubt they are right.</p>
   <p>Once again Silent had the answer. “Yes.”</p>
   <p>Darling signed, “Then get killing. I cannot block this path forever.”</p>
   <p>The null is part of her, always. When it goes active against sorcery it sucks the energy out of her the same as the sorcery sucks it out of the sorcerer.</p>
   <p>It was obvious immediately that there was a sad gap between knowing that a hungry ghost could be killed and knowing how the killing could be managed. Even Silent had no suggestions.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Sweet Billi Afi!” One-Eye blurted, in a flat voice. “I guess it had to happen.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Four people oozed toward the Village of Hungry Ghosts. They had circumvented Darling by clambering over a ferociously rocky barrier hill between the ruins and the bitter oasis. All four had bloodied themselves during the crossing. Two were refugee kids. One was a mildly retarded cook’s helper named Thorodd Asgeir who had been with the Company for years without capturing the attention of the Annalist. The last was one of the Chasings’ boy bandits.</p>
   <p>I shouted. Goblin and One-Eye shouted. Silent gripped Midnight’s arm and kept her from charging her doomed cousin. None of the four heard a word. They walked faster as they got closer to the village. Their expressions said they were marching straight on into heaven.</p>
   <p>Goblin and One-Eye groaned. One-Eye began a muttered countdown. Silent shivered, angered by all the stupid. Midnight mostly looked puzzled. Unlike the old men she had no idea what was about to happen.</p>
   <p>She had not yet seen the true bleakness of the world. Hunger, cold, and human bad behavior were the only ugliness she knew.</p>
   <p>“Two, one, and . . .” Seconds passed. One-Eye was not quite in rhythm today. “And there she goes.”</p>
   <p>The screaming started as a dense and intense shimmer enveloped the four. One refugee kid’s head exploded. All four came apart in tiny, bloody fragments. The insanely hungry ghosts knew no restraint.</p>
   <p>The shimmer intensified as ropes of twisted light streaked into the bloody scrum.</p>
   <p>One-Eye told Silent, “There were more dormant ones than you thought.”</p>
   <p>Silent grunted, which proved how rattled he was.</p>
   <p>Midnight gasped once, then just watched. Her face lapsed into the grim hostility that had shone there whenever she looked at Rusty back on that first day. She was scary, there, for a while.</p>
   <p>Meantime, One-Eye declared this shit to be all Croaker’s fault because he disappointed his honey in the Tower so bad that she wanted him and his friends hooked up with horrible deaths.</p>
   <p>I called across, “I would sincerely appreciate you giving that crap a rest.”</p>
   <p>He grinned a grin full of nasty teeth and gave that foul hat of his a full half turn. He was thrilled. He had gotten under unflappable Croaker’s skin.</p>
   <p>I said, “I guess we can assume we were pushed to these hungry ghosts. But might there be more to it than just trying to put the hurt on us?”</p>
   <p>The wizard crew looked up in militarily precise cadence as a shadow rippled across the ground. I looked up, too, in time to see a smaller vulture join a pair already circling. A young one, not long out of the nest, now an apprentice to mom and dad in the carrion clean-up business.</p>
   <p>“Suppose the Lady can control hungry ghosts once they occupy somebody’s body?”</p>
   <p>“She might see this as a kind of Taking?” Goblin asked. “She could get control of the Company?”</p>
   <p>“Just thinking out loud.”</p>
   <p>“It would friggin’ fit!” One-Eye bellowed. “For the gods’ sake, Croaker, you sure can pick them!”</p>
   <p>I had some trouble keeping my temper. “What happened to those four idiots maybe says I’m all wet, but she <emphasis>is</emphasis> a long ways away. Maybe she don’t know how starved these hungry ghosts are.”</p>
   <p>Darling’s hands danced. I relayed. “The call is getting weaker and confused. The feeding frenzy broke their concentration.”</p>
   <p>Chasing Midnight now sat between Silent and One-Eye, with Goblin moved to the apex of a triangle. The girl did all the talking. Filthy old gray heads bobbed. Then Silent headed my way.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Silent and Darling may be soul mates at the heart of the romantic tragedy of our age. They are what they are, doomed never to touch, but all their years of yearning have narrowed the distance they have to keep between them. They can stay close for hours sometimes, so long as they do not touch or make eye contact.</p>
   <p>They manage, however painful that must be. To quote our fallen Captain, “You do what you got to do.”</p>
   <p>Darling and Silent would cuddle up as much as nature allowed. They denied that any such thing was going on, of course, but even dim thug Rusty saw the untruth in that.</p>
   <p>Which signified only because Silent approached Darling close and signed in a blur, presenting a suggestion on behalf of Chasing Midnight. At the same time he offered arguments against Darling subjecting herself to the risks.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Darling entered the Village of Hungry Ghosts in measured steps, that dumb-ass Company Annalist Croaker beside her on her right. He carried a seldom-seen bow that had been a gift from the Lady on his release from the Tower. He was pretty good with that bow.</p>
   <p>Along for the stroll was my favorite sergeant, Elmo, and two old soldiers named Otto and Hagop. Also with us, at Darling’s behest, speaking in tongues with terror, was Rusty.</p>
   <p>There was no popular support for his presence, but Darling insisted. He needed a chance for redemption. Even he understood, but, still, he looked like hammered shit as we headed into the ruins.</p>
   <p>We were about to execute a scheme bought instantly by Darling when Midnight proposed it. Darling had us drafted and rolling as quick as it took the buzzard family to complete a couple circles around the sky.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Darling eased through the ruins, each step careful. We saw some dressed stones still topping other dressed stones, but I suspected that the original structures would have been mostly mud brick. Rain would not be a frequent problem here.</p>
   <p>We smelled decay and saw some bones, but nothing like what I had worked myself up to expect.</p>
   <p>Hagop grumbled, “This reminds me of someplace we used to be.”</p>
   <p>Otto bobbed his head. “Aloe, five, six years ago.”</p>
   <p>I recalled, “That country was flatter. And civilized. There were people. Mostly nice people.”</p>
   <p>Hagop said, “It had the same feel, though. All the time like the shit was gonna come down any minute.”</p>
   <p>Yes. True. There was a sense of imminence. I became shakier. Hard not to suffer the heebie-jeebies when what looked like snakes of water slithered and splashed in the air on all the fringes of Darling’s tightened null. They would strike instantly if any crack opened.</p>
   <p>She grew more bold. That crack would not develop. She <emphasis>was</emphasis> the null. It did not turn on and off, though she could control its range and intensity a little. A very little.</p>
   <p>Looked like she knew where she wanted to go.</p>
   <p>The advancing null scared up a skeleton ass draped in mangy, saggy hide. It shambled out of a dark place, set out to put distance between us and it.</p>
   <p>Darling made an impatient gesture my way. Why was I just standing there, gawking?</p>
   <p>“Hungry ghosts,” I reminded myself. There was no moral ambiguity.</p>
   <p>The black arrow hit the air immediately. The frightened animal inside this being with a capacity for moral anxiety <emphasis>could</emphasis> get things done. Better to be alive tomorrow to whimper about what got done today.</p>
   <p>The arrow wobbled through the fuzzy bounds of the null. The spells on it took life. It struck behind the animal’s head, skipped off bone into brain. Rusty charged. Otto and Elmo yelled at him to hold up, it was too dangerous to get so far ahead. But nothing happened. When we got there Rusty was jabbing his spear into the carcass repeatedly.</p>
   <p>Otto stepped up with his big ax and removed the wild ass’s head, after which good buddy Hagop began trying to recover my arrow for me.</p>
   <p>Darling signed, “The brat was right.” Not entirely pleased to admit that. “That was a crippling shock to the monsters. Let us move on quickly while they are panicked.” She walked on, again looking like she knew where she wanted to go.</p>
   <p>We took our places, Rusty now seeming all twitchy. There was a long difference between bullying and cold killing.</p>
   <p>The watery ropes around us were fewer and more randomly behaved. They stuck with us out of inertia, not purpose.</p>
   <p>Darling’s confidence soared. Her step quickened. Thirty yards onward a long, sad moan of despair from under a stone slab brought us to a halt. Shaking, Rusty took a knee, looked underneath. “It’s hollowed out under here. Somebody is in here.”</p>
   <p>Elmo, Hagop, and Otto took hold of the slab and heaved. Three men were not enough. Rusty and I joined them. Darling stood by, shielding us from the raging mad terror of the discorporate hungry ghosts.</p>
   <p>The hidden woman had been unable to keep quiet when the null touched her. She was not old in years lived, she was just starved to where her bones were brittle and her weight had shrunk to nothing. Were she not possessed, she would be dead already.</p>
   <p>We looked to Darling. Somebody had to act. She should pick.</p>
   <p>Ticking and twitching, Rusty started to step up but then thought better. Darling might figure he was sucking up.</p>
   <p>Darling used Otto’s ax to do it herself. She was muscular, but that ax was heavy. She damaged the blade badly.</p>
   <p>Was I alone in seeing the moment of human terror and pleading in the woman’s eyes as the ax fell? I did not ask. Something else we do not talk about with our brothers.</p>
   <p>The head rolled away. The body jerked once and stopped moving forever. Not much blood got loose. What did smelled diseased.</p>
   <p>The impact was instant. Insanely despairing emotion soaked into the null. The siren call collapsed completely. The rest of the Company picked up the next phase of Midnight’s plan, which began slowly because people had to shake the wool out of their heads before they could understand.</p>
   <p>Our intrepid band pressed on, looking for the wild ass being worn by the last incarnate hungry ghost.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>That hungry ghost did not want to get caught. It wanted to stay out of sight till we messed up and exposed some of our people to seizure.</p>
   <p>A few of our idiots tried, but Midnight, with stubborn help from Goblin, One-Eye, and Silent, kept the suicidal stupidity in check.</p>
   <p>The discorporate hungry ghosts never recovered enough to regenerate their call. Midnight kept their madness boiling by having livestock paraded outside the confining boundary. All reason fled the ghosts. Midnight and the wizards began to expose livestock carefully. The animals fought, futilely. They calmed instantly once a hungry ghost got inside.</p>
   <p>I asked Silent, “Can you keep track of which ones are infected?”</p>
   <p>Staring into nothing, in the general direction of where Robin and Rusty were watching, he signed, “I can. We can.”</p>
   <p>Those animals would be slaughtered and eaten first.</p>
   <p>Practical, pragmatic Darling and Chasing Midnight! Darling’s harshness did not trouble me. I had seen it for years. I was comfortable with how her head worked. Chasing Midnight, though, did worry me. She had so much potential and was still so young. She might make bad decisions. She might be nudged onto the shadowed path by another’s bad behavior. She could end up a victim of her own adolescent humors.</p>
   <p>Darling smirked when I mentioned that. “Smitten, are we?”</p>
   <p>“No! Not that way. But I do like the kid. In a fatherly way. She’s brilliant. I don’t want to see that wasted.”</p>
   <p>Darling nodded, reflected, most likely the only member of the Company who would not serve me a ration of shit about incest. She signed, “You fuss too much. She is fourteen. She is already who she is going to be. All you can do is set an example that she will want to follow.”</p>
   <p>Parenting advice from somebody twenty years my junior.</p>
   <p>“All right. I’ll try.” But I had my reservations. I feared that there was a shadow inside Midnight that she had kept well hidden.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>I went walking in the ruins, thinking they would be choked with loneliness and silence. I reexamined recent events repeatedly, sure that I was missing something.</p>
   <p>The ruins were neither quiet nor lonely. The hungry ghosts had been replaced by every vulture and carrion eater in nearby creation, all squabbling over the remains of two wild asses and one old woman whose dying eyes I could not get out of my head.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It did not come together for weeks, during our talks with the Magistrates of Rue, who wanted to pay us to discourage the predatory behavior of their neighbors, the Dank. Both sides had heard wildly exaggerated tales of our work for the Lady, years ago.</p>
   <p>What I finally noticed, like a sudden slap to the back of my head, was that now always twitchy Rusty hung around Midnight more than Robin did. And Midnight put up with that dickhead.</p>
   <p>The last piece clicked. Rusty was no longer an asshole. Since the Village of Hungry Ghosts he had stopped being true to his nature. He had become, in fact, almost Chasing Midnight’s dog. And Midnight appeared to have no problems with him anymore.</p>
   <p>The same could not be said for her brother and the other surviving bandits. Moonlight still got that look when his gaze chanced upon Rusty.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The Magistrates argued almost not at all before they made a deal. That guaranteed that they would double-cross us as soon as they felt safe from the Dank. We understood. It was nothing new. Evil in its own time. Meanwhile, we could take a break from traveling, in a place where people did not know us.</p>
   <p>I set up my clinic inside an actual building. We handled a few cuts, scrapes, and malingerers looking to get out of work. Caught up, I told Midnight, “Go fetch Rusty for me. I want to take a look at him.”</p>
   <p>She pouted prettily, not pleased. “Robin says he has been having stomach troubles. So, I guess, yes. You should check him out.” She left.</p>
   <p>I waited, appreciating my new digs. They were part of a small barracks. I might stay warm and well-fed all winter. Fingers crossed. Let us stretch out the war with the Dank.</p>
   <p>Rusty arrived. Twitchy, pale, watery-eyed Rusty, not at all pleased to be so close to the Company sawbones. I said, “Have a seat here.”</p>
   <p>“What’s up?”</p>
   <p>“I’ve noticed . . .” and I explained my professional interest.</p>
   <p>Where was Midnight? I heard Robin talking in the waiting area. Maybe she was out there with him.</p>
   <p>Rusty began to relax. This was all routine. Yeah. He was having trouble with his guts. Maybe he got himself a ulcer. He had an uncle once; he got him a ulcer. Uncle used to puke up blood sometimes.</p>
   <p>I got behind Rusty, rested my hands on his shoulders, leaned, whispered, “I know you’re in there. And everyone else knows, too.”</p>
   <p>Rusty lapsed into the worst twitches, ticks, and shakes yet.</p>
   <p>The hungry ghost had him only under partial control.</p>
   <p>I would start checking local sources right away. There might be an exorcism that could save the man—even though haunted Rusty was better liked than Rusty his own self ever was before.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>I never saw Chasing Midnight again. She, Moonlight, and their friends stepped off the face of the earth. Not so difficult in a city. Darling would not let me waste time and energy looking for someone who did not want to be found. Darling wanted to be our unchallenged princess. Moreover, we had soldier business to handle.</p>
   <p>The skirmishes with the Dank all ended badly for them. Local fighters on both sides were amateurs of abysmal quality led by fat old men who got their jobs because they were the sons of privilege. And we had Silent, Goblin, and One-Eye to give us that extra edge.</p>
   <p>Rusty disappeared a week after Midnight did. Robin did not vanish with him. That boy went half crazy with worry. Nobody else cared. Rusty carried a hungry ghost that could not migrate unless he found another colony. The tacit popular choice was to let nature run its course.</p>
   <p>One winter night a partially recovered Whisper slipped into Rue to hand the senior Magistrates a plain directive from the Lady concerning the Black Company. The Magistrates agreed to her terms but failed to execute their promised treachery because clever One-Eye had rat spies keeping watch on all of Rue’s most important men.</p>
   <p>We did considerable selective damage before we left town with pockets sagging.</p>
   <p>I got the final word on Rusty as we cleared Rue’s eastern gate. His mutilated corpse had been found in the mud and water along the edge of the river that ran through Rue. The rats and crayfish had been at him, but they had not done a tenth of the damage that he suffered at human hands before what was left of him was dumped.</p>
   <p>I knew then, for sure, why I had grown ever more uneasy with sweet, pretty little Chasing Midnight.</p>
   <p>Maybe there will be those new grim armies and fresh dark towers someday, after all.</p>
